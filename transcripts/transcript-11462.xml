<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what do you think of the centre?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What do I think of the centre? I think it's a terrific example of what you can do when you get some warm-hearted, public-spirited people and a great welfare organisation together. And I've just talked to some of the women who've been helped over the last year and been given some wonderful stories of how they've been able to put their lives together again. And it does provide a special environment and a special facility for women and I think that's very important, particularly women who've suffered domestic violence. They do need the comfort and support and security of the company of other women to help them rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask what happened to the National Homeless Strategy from the 1999 Budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's still going strongly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much has been spent so far?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know off-hand. I didn't bring that figure in my head, but it's still going very strongly. In fact it was renewed after the last election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard will you be changing the wording of the Government's reconciliation documentation to include an apology to the aboriginal community?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Our position is that although we are very sorry and we greatly regret injustices in the past we don't believe that the present generation should accept responsibility for the mistakes of earlier generations.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard who wrote that document?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Council.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did Kevan Gosper make a mistake in letting his daughter run first, do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I think there's been enough about that. It's been dealt with extensively. I just think we ought to move on to the positive things about the Olympic Games. I think we run the danger in this country of becoming hooked on gaffes in relation to the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But there seems to be so many..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look I want the Olympic Games to be a success. I admire the dignity of the other girl. I think she's behaved wonderfully - the Greek-Australian girl - I think she's behaved magnificently. But look can't we just sort of move on? Do we have to all the time get focussed on these things rather then that a tremendous uplifting event the Olympic games is going to be.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, should Dr Wooldridge stand aside on the...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Mr Beazley's budget response. What is your response again to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well my response to Mr Beazley's response, well he did not offer an alternative. I mean can we have one example please Mr Beazley of where you are going to roll back? I mean, we've got a policy that comes into operation on the 1st of July. We won an election on the basis of it. It's there - warts and all - for people to see and it will come into operation. We've endured a great deal of political pain to bring about something that we think is good for Australia and all Mr Beazley can give us is generalised waffle. A political leader has a responsibility to do more than spend half an hour in rhetorical waffle. I mean he's the alternative Prime Minister of Australia and in our political system the Leader of the Opposition has responsibilities as well the Prime Minister and if it's good enough for the Prime Minister to say what he's going to do and be held accountable for it, then it's good enough for the Leader of the Opposition. Please Mr Beazley can we just have one example of roll back?</p>
