EMBARGO: 8.30 p. m. ,4,,, USRALIA&amp;<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE -SYDNEY<br />
NOVEMBER 1976<br />
I was delighted to be able to accept your invitation to address this<br />
distinguished gathering.<br />
I welcome this opportunity to examine some of the basic problems we<br />
have to face in securing economic recovery, and to set out for you the<br />
approach, and the reasons for that approach, that we have adopted in<br />
Australia. You will all be aware that by 1975 Australia was facing particularly<br />
severe problems of inflation, unemployment, high interest rates and a<br />
record government deficit.<br />
Australia was not alone in confronting these problems, they were familiar<br />
throughout the OECD countries, but Australia suffered particularly<br />
and unnecessarily, for domestic reasons.<br />
The core of the problem, in our assessment, was the role of Government<br />
in the economy in the years 1973 to 1975.<br />
The experience of the last few years has forced a fundamental rethinking<br />
about economic processes, and the role and capacity of government in<br />
economic management.<br />
We have just emerged from a period in which governments aroused excessive<br />
expectations about what government could do.<br />
Moveover, over a long period governments also aroused excessive<br />
expectations about future incomes, and about the rights to future<br />
incomes divorced from the responsibility to work. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Governments have available four main arms of policy in guiding and<br />
encouraging economic activity. These ares are budgetary, monetary,<br />
external and wages policy.<br />
Tonight I would like to examine how Government has used each of these<br />
arms of policy in recent years and how this government has sought to<br />
balance them in securing economic recovery.<br />
To understand the way in which these four arms are being used in<br />
Australia at the present time, it is necessary to understand what has<br />
happened in Australia in the previous three years.<br />
The emphasis as between the various arms of policy varies from time to<br />
time, but there must be a reasonable balance between these different<br />
arms of policy if serious inequities and distortions in the economy<br />
are not to occur.<br />
When we review the experience of the last few years several outstanding<br />
facts become obvious.<br />
One was the complete collapse, for a period, of a r ational budgetary<br />
policy. Another was the adoption of wages and prices policies whose<br />
effect was disastrous for business profitability and hence for employment<br />
opportunities. A third was the pursuit of unsettling monetary and<br />
external policies.<br />
On the budgetary side a large expansion of government spending occurred<br />
in 1973 when private demand pressures were already becoming excessive.<br />
As unemployment rose in 1974 an effort was made, on so-called inappropriate<br />
keynesian doctrine, to stimulate the economy further by even greater<br />
public spending. In one year there was a 46% increase in federal<br />
government spending. In one year federal budget outlays increased from<br />
24% to 30% of GDP.<br />
It is hardly necessary to recallnow that this massive so-called<br />
" stimulation" exacerbated unemployment, which increased by<br />
some 180,000 in one year. A significant leap forward in inflation also<br />
took place. </p>
<p>On the wages side, the role of the government actually compounded the<br />
problem. For quite some time large wage increases were actually<br />
encouraged and supported by the Commonwealth Government before the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The share of GDP going to<br />
wages rose substantially while the share going to profits fell..<br />
High unemployment combined with high inflation were inevitable<br />
consequences. It is an extraordinary fact that despite an increase in<br />
the number of people seeking employment between 1973 1975 of almost<br />
400,000 there were no more people employed in the private sector than<br />
there had been three years earlier.<br />
The total net increase in persons employed had occurred in the government<br />
sector. On the monetary side the excessive growth in government spending fed into<br />
excessive liquidity. This in turn meant that unreasonable weight<br />
had to be placed on monetary policy, leading to a damaging squeeze<br />
on credit. Later still there was a resurgence of monetary growth,<br />
as a direct consequence of excessive government spending.<br />
On the external side, there was an attempt to redress the inflationary<br />
pressures fed by domestic policy.<br />
The 25% across-the-board tariff cut was in part an effort to curb<br />
inflationary pressures by subjecting Australian industry to a strong<br />
burst of international competition.<br />
These policies contributed to domestic uncertainty and unemployment.<br />
When it was elected to office in December 1975 the Government faced<br />
a situation in which unemployment had risen to a level not recorded<br />
in this country since the 1930' s.<br />
Gross non-farm product in the December quarter of 1975 was still almost<br />
per cent below its peak level recorded two years earlier.<br />
The Government seemed unconcerned about the desperate situation in the<br />
farm sector. The share of company profits in national income remained<br />
despressed at around three quarters of its long run norm. </p>
<p>Real business fixed investment had fallen in the December quarter to its<br />
lowest level for almost 3 years. And, last but not least,' the consumer<br />
price index in the December quarter was 14 per cent above a year earlier<br />
and showed no real prospect of a sustained move down.<br />
In these circumstances the Government was confronted by a situation<br />
where we had to restore a responsible balance between the major arms<br />
of policy, using each arm to the maximum extent possible in combatting<br />
inflation. The principal task in fighting both inflation and unemployment was to<br />
establish a sustainable government role.<br />
This was not merely a matter of taking appropriate ac'tion in relation<br />
to matters under the direct control of the Government.<br />
It was also a matter of encouraging a realistic set of expectations<br />
in the community about what Government could achieve.<br />
The community must accept that there are limits to what governments shoul<br />
do and what they can do. There are also limits to the rate of growth<br />
in living standards which any country can provide. This realisation<br />
has spread considerably in recent times in this country and in many<br />
others. There is, I believe, a growing recognition that increasing public<br />
sector demand on resources, excessive monetary expansion, and<br />
generally growing gove-rnment involvement and interference in the<br />
economic process, have been building up unsustainable pressures that<br />
can no longer be tolerated if we are to retain a free society.<br />
It is now clear that the feasible and appropriate role of government<br />
isto provide the framework, or environment, for stable, non-inflationary,<br />
growth through the pursuit of responsible economic policies.<br />
The managing director of the international monetary fund, Mr. Witteveen,<br />
whom I found to be stimulating, frank and open in economic discussion,<br />
put it thus: " An important lesson of recent experience is that nothing<br />
could be gained by combatting unemployment through expansionary policies </p>
<p>that would intensify inflationary expectations... restoration of a<br />
reasonable degree of price stability will be necessary to establish<br />
a durable basis for better economic performance."<br />
As the Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr. Van Lennep, has said:<br />
" Except in the very short run, lower unemployment cannot be bought<br />
at the cost of ever higher rates of inflation... what is required is<br />
relatively cautious demand management policy, aimed at achieving<br />
a moderate but sustained expansion"<br />
Unrealistic expectations, built up over a long period, are not easily<br />
or quickly changed.<br />
Even with growing community understanding we cannot expect quickly<br />
to restore growth and rising unemployment opportunities. There now<br />
appears to be a general acceptance among countries that the restoration<br />
of full employment and normal levels of capacity utilisation will take<br />
a considerable period.<br />
There are still those who find this prospect " unacceptable", who<br />
think we should move more rapidly, particularly in alleviating the<br />
problem of unemployment. On that I would like to turn to<br />
Mr. Witteveen again, because I think he simed up the position accurately<br />
when he recently said: " There is a danger that the sense of<br />
repugnance we all feel for the social injustice of unemployment might<br />
engender political pressures that will work for a more rapid absorption<br />
of spare capacity than can be achieved without producing a renewed<br />
acceleiation of price increases"<br />
Those who really want to help the unemployed might reflect on that.<br />
The most positive policies to resolve the problem of unemployment are<br />
those we have adopted. These are policies designed to reassert a<br />
responsible balance between budgetary, monetary, external and wages<br />
policy. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
On the budgetary side, we have reduced the rate of growth in government<br />
spending from 23% to 11% in this year's budget and intend to see that<br />
that reduction is realised in practice.<br />
Significant personal and company tax reforms have been introduced and<br />
a range of specific encouragements offered private investment.<br />
The deficit has been significantly reduced and equally, if not more<br />
important, the structure of the deficit has been altered.<br />
It is now a deficit which reflects the adoption of specific measures<br />
designed to help individuals and businesses not one produced by a<br />
government determined to devour even more of the nation' s resources.<br />
Indeed, without specific personal tax reforms and business incentives<br />
introduced by the Government this year, the deficit would have<br />
been $ 1.4 billion.<br />
We will be pressing ahead on the budgetary side in the coming year.<br />
No one has suggested that we should be pursuing a harder budgetary line.<br />
There are, however, those who, refusing to learn from the past, urge us<br />
to once again further expand government spending to stimulate the economy<br />
The Leader of the Opposition recently urged measures which would have<br />
the effect of increasing the budget deficit by another $ 1 billion.<br />
These proposals are simply the re-emergence in another guise oftI.<br />
policies rejected by the country at the last election.<br />
Any relaxation of the budgetary arm would mean a higher deficit, with<br />
the consequent problems of financing that deficit.<br />
It would put greater pressure on the other arms of policy. We have<br />
seen the consequences of that.<br />
Neither printing money nor excessively high interest rates are<br />
attractive alternatives where the top priority is the eradication of<br />
inflation. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Those who ask for an increased deficit would do well to look at<br />
the other side of the ledger.<br />
On the wages side, the Commonwealth Government has strongly argued<br />
throughout this year before the Arbitration Commission that there<br />
must be restraint in wage increases.<br />
We are currently arguing before the Commission that economic conditions<br />
do not justify any further increase in award wages and salaries at<br />
the present time or at most very small increase.<br />
Clearly a balance must be struck between what is economically desirable<br />
and what is industrially possible.<br />
The Government intends to continue to take a strong stand against wage<br />
and salary increases which cannot be justified by economic conditions.<br />
We place great weight on the commonsense of the Australian people in<br />
these matters. We do not believe their views are in any way<br />
reflected in the statement of a few extreme militant union leaders.<br />
We will continue to emphasise the responsibility of the trade union<br />
movement, along with other sections of the communi y, for assisting<br />
in the reduction of costs and in the expansion of job opportunities.<br />
With widespread support in the community, we have already achieved<br />
some success in this area and we do not intend to let up.<br />
In monetary policy the recent measures underscore our determination<br />
to persist with our announced strategy of achieving an appropriate<br />
rate of growth in the money supply.<br />
These measures are in no sense whatever a squeeze on credit.<br />
They constitute a technical adjustment whose significance has been<br />
grossly overplayed.<br />
They will not reduce money forwoithwhile projects but will assist the<br />
Government to take up some of the slack created by the seasonal deficit<br />
early in the year related to tax collections. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
They will assist in avoiding an undue tightness later in the year<br />
when company tax payments fall due.<br />
The measures stress the seriousness with which we intend to persist<br />
in our anti-inflation strategy.<br />
On the fourth arm of policy, external policy, our whole approach<br />
has been, and remains, to create an environment where businesses can<br />
plan ahead confident there will be no sudden large changes in<br />
tariffs, Australian industry will be protected. We have a rational<br />
approach to foreign investment.<br />
There has been a great deal of unnecessary focus in recent months on<br />
movements in our international reserves. Our reserves are there for a<br />
purpose to meet fluctuations in our external payments position.<br />
They are Australia's " cash in the till". If reserves cannot be<br />
used without causing concern then reserves are of little use.<br />
Our credit is good and government borrowing while other policies are<br />
working should be taken as a sign of strength.<br />
We have given great importance to following consistent and known<br />
policies in the attack on inflation.<br />
There is good evidence that those policies are<br />
succeeding. The consumer price index increased by 2.2 percent in the<br />
September quarter, the lowest quarterly increase, with the<br />
exception of the medibank quarter, since the March quarter 1973.<br />
There will be an apparent break in this improving trend in the December<br />
quarter, when the Medibank changes will again affect the C. P. I. We<br />
should not let one index obscure the clearly continuing trend towards<br />
lower rates of inflation. </p>
<p>Success in the fightagainst inflation will in turn make possible a<br />
significant decline in unemployment.<br />
Indeed, our concern with unemployment is a major reason why we<br />
are pressing the attack on inflation so strongly.<br />
In giving priority to inflation we are giving priority to unemployment.<br />
The attack on one is an attack on the other. Short-term palliatives<br />
will not, cannot, work. They will not be pursued.<br />
Unfortunately it is just not possible to put everything right at once.<br />
An economy must be steered gently not subject to sudden reversals<br />
and shifts. Problems which have developed have to be worked out of the<br />
sytem. They cannot be abolished by Government fiat or magic wand.<br />
The Government is very conscious that many groups in the community<br />
have been unjustly penalised by the failure to maintain a balance<br />
in policies in the last few years.<br />
Unless all arms of policy, budgetary, monetary, external and wages<br />
policy are pursued in a balanced and appropriate way, grave inequities<br />
will occur between the major sectors of the economy.<br />
Gross increases in government spending and wages produced inflation and<br />
unemployment, and created appalling inequities between different groups<br />
in the community.<br />
Businesses found profits destroyed and as a consequence investment<br />
was curtailed and many thrown out of work or unable to find jobs.<br />
Rising costs damaged farmers and exporters.<br />
In overcoming inflation there are also costs to be borne. These<br />
costs are exaggerated for certain groups when some sections of the<br />
community are largely insulated from inflation.<br />
Wage earners have had significant protection through indexation,<br />
Personions have pensions indexed to the C. P. I. Public servants have had<br />
secure employment.<br />
By contrast, the poor, .' ie unemployed, the retired drawing on thei* Lr<br />
own savings, superannuants, young people wanting to bLL' homes, </p>
<p>those whose incomes have not been indexed, have all suffered<br />
severely from inflation.<br />
Because of the problems in the economy it has only been possible to move<br />
in graduated steps towards the achievement of our objectives.<br />
In giving top priority to the eradication of inflation the Government<br />
cannot turn away from any effort to assist those who have suffered most.<br />
As far as possible consistent with our principal objective we have<br />
sought to mitigate the inequities caused by inflation.<br />
The family allowances scheme was a major step forward in assisting<br />
families in poverty. For similar reasons we have indexed pensions<br />
to the C. P. I.<br />
We intend to act further, for. ' example, in the area of taxation<br />
when circumstances permit. The Hayden reforms of last year left<br />
many inequities. These reforms in effect abolished concessional<br />
deductions for many people, and consequently incentives to undertake<br />
certain worthwhile expenditures.<br />
We did not touch these in the last budget because we considered that<br />
priority should be given to the introduction of personal income tax<br />
indexation. We intend to undertake further reforms in this area<br />
when circumstances permit.<br />
We have also taken action to lighten the burdens on those who want to<br />
develop Australia's natural resources. In the budget we announced<br />
significant taxation concessions for petroleum and mineral exploration.<br />
We eliminated the crude oil levy on new discoveries and began the<br />
phasing out of the coal export duty.<br />
We have also removed uncertainty from foreign investors through<br />
new foreign investment guidelines. Some 700 applications have already<br />
been approved this year. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
We have taken the view that responsible action to treat the economy<br />
as a whole need not be inconsistent with action to assist those<br />
particularly disadvantaged by inflation.<br />
This said, of course, it must be emphasised that, getting back to a<br />
fully satisfactory basis of economic policy won't be possible until<br />
inflation is beaten.<br />
Compared to other countries in the OECD Australia made a late start<br />
in over-coming inflation.<br />
The process is now well under way and already there are signs<br />
of success.<br />
We intend to be unrelenting in our anti-inflation policy.<br />
The progress by which governments have fueled unrealistic expectations<br />
and squeezed out enterprise and opportunity must end.<br />
We have to achieve a balance between expectations and what Government<br />
can perform.<br />
There must be a new recognition that it is through enterprise,<br />
imagination and work, that the standard of life of every person can be<br />
increased. That is, and will continue to be, our guiding perspective in restoring<br />
prosperity to Australia.<br />
