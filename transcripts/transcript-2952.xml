AUSTRALIA TRANSFERS LAND TO PEOPLE<br />
OF THE NEW HEBRIDES<br />
The Australian Government has agreed to relinquish<br />
Australian land holdings in the New Hebrides to enable them to<br />
be used by the people of the New Hebrides.<br />
Announcing this today, the Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, released the following agreed<br />
joint communique by the Australian and British Governments:<br />
" The Australian and British Governments have agreed in<br />
principle that Australian lands in the New Hebrides known as the<br />
' Commonwealth Lands' should be transferred to a Land Trust Board<br />
to be set up by the British Resident Commissioner in the New Hebrides<br />
under Queen's Regulations.<br />
As part of a contract made in 1902 between the Australian<br />
Government and Burns Philp and Co Ltd, Burns Philp transferred<br />
the right of disposal of approximately 25,000 acres of land in<br />
the New Hebrides, to which it held claims, to the Australian<br />
Minister for External ( now Foreign) Affairs, in return for an<br />
increase in shipping subsidy. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Mcst of the land is registered in Burns Philp's name<br />
and the company has continued to act as agents for the<br />
Australian Government in dealing with the land.<br />
It will be the duty of the Land Trust Board to further<br />
the use of the land vested in it from time to time for the<br />
benefit of the neople of the New Hebrides.<br />
The ' Commonwealth Lands, with some possible exceptions O<br />
to be agreed between the British Resident Commissioner and the<br />
Australian authorities, will be vested in the Board.<br />
In reaching this agreement the Australian and British<br />
Governments have had very much in mind the interests of the<br />
New Hebrideans. Detailed discussions and negotiations consequential<br />
upon the agreement will be held as soon as possible between the<br />
British Residency in Vila and the Australian authorities." Ah </p>
