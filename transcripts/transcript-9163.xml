PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J KEATING MP<br />
THE ECONOMIST ROUNDTABLE<br />
Today I met and held discussions with Bill Emmott, the Editor of The<br />
Economist and host of the magazine's Roundtable with the Australian<br />
Government.<br />
The Roundtable consists of a dialogue between Ministers and other<br />
Australian public figures on the one hand, and an audience of senior local<br />
and international business representatives on the other. I shall speak at the<br />
closing session of the Economist's Roundtable on 24 March.<br />
The Roundtable is taking place at a very opportune time. The Australian<br />
economy is recovering strongly from recession, with one of the highest<br />
growth rates in the OECD.<br />
Four factors point to the potential for this growth to be sustainable:<br />
the low inflation rate, and low inflationary expectations;<br />
the increasing coupling of the Australian economy to those of the high<br />
growth countries of the Asia-Pacific region;<br />
the ongoing program of microeconomic reform, which will continue to<br />
raise productivity and the growth potential through the 1990s; and<br />
the continuing diversification of Australia's exports, with rapid growth in<br />
manufacturing and services exports reducing our susceptibility to the<br />
fluctuations of commodity prices.<br />
. These factors,-. together with Australia's advantages as a place to live and<br />
work, make this country an excellent location for international companies<br />
seeking to do business in this region. </p>
<p>2<br />
These themes are developed further in Australia in the World, a publication<br />
released to coincide with the Roundtable. The document contains an<br />
assessment not only of the comprehensive reform program undertaken to<br />
date, but also of the future agenda for economic, political and social<br />
development. CANBERRA<br />
