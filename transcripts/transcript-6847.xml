    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>2 March 1986</strong></p>
<p>Her Majesty the Queen today signed the Proclamation to bring theÂ Australia Act 1986 into operation. The Act will commenceÂ tomorrow at 4.00 pm, Eastern Summer Time, simultaneously with theÂ Australia Act 1986 which was recently enacted by the UnitedÂ Kingdom Parliament at the request of the Commonwealth ParliamentÂ and all the State Parliaments.</p>
<p>Following the signing of the Proclamation, Her Majesty presentedÂ the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, with a copy of the Act passed byÂ the United Kingdom Parliament. That Act will be framed andÂ displayed publicly in the new Parliament House, along with theÂ Act of the Australian Parliament and the Proclamation which theÂ Queen signed today.</p>
<p>The two Australia Acts remove the outmoded links betweenÂ Australia and the United Kingdom parliamentary, government andÂ judicial systems. They reflect Australia's status as anÂ independent and sovereign nation. Her Majesty's position as<br />Queen of Australia is in no way affected.</p>
<p>Commencement of the Acts represents the culmination of extensiveÂ negotiations between the Commonwealth, the States and the UnitedÂ Kingdom.</p>
<p>The major features of the Acts include:</p>
<ul><li>An end to appeals from Australian courts of law to the PrivyÂ Council, making the High Court of Australia the final courtÂ of appeal for Australian courts on all matters.</li>
<li>An end to the powers of the United Kingdom Parliament andÂ Government over the States.</li>
<li>An end to United Kingdom legislation, such as the ColonialÂ Laws Validity Act 1865, restricting the legislative powers ofÂ the States to repeal or update old Imperial laws stillÂ applying to them.</li>
</ul><p>An outline of the residual constitutional links abolished by theÂ legislation is attached.</p>
<p><strong>RESIDUAL CONSTITUTIONAL LINKS</strong></p>
<p>The following is an outline of the constitutional links ended byÂ the Australia Acts:</p>
<p><strong>Legislative </strong></p>
<ul><li>Power of the United Kingdom Parliament to enact legislationÂ having effect as part of Australian law.</li>
<li>The Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and the " repugnancy" rule (ieÂ the rule that State legislation inconsistent withÂ United Kingdom laws extending to the States is invalid toÂ that extent).</li>
<li>Possible implied limitations on powers of State Parliaments,Â deriving from their former colonial status.</li>
<li>Merchant Shipping Act 1894 ( limitations on State powers toÂ regulate merchant shipping).</li>
<li>Queen's power to withhold assent from, or disallow, StateÂ laws on the advice of United Kingdom Ministers.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Executive </strong></p>
<ul><li>Residual executive responsibilities of United KingdomÂ Government with respect to a State, which derived from theÂ States' former status as colonies: for example, the need, in Â the appointment of a State Governor, for a Premier to provideÂ advice to the Queen through United Kingdom Ministers.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Judicial </strong></p>
<ul><li>Appeals to the Privy Council from State Courts.</li>
</ul><p>Other sections of the Australia Acts</p>
<ul><li>provide that the powers and functions of the Queen withÂ respect to any State, other than the power to appoint andÂ dismiss the Governor, shall be exercisable only by theÂ Governor ( except when the Queen is personally present in theÂ State, when she may exercise powers and functions pursuant toÂ a mutual and prior agreement between her and the Premier);</li>
<li>provide for the appointment and dismissal of State GovernorsÂ by the Queen on the direct advice of the Premiers;</li>
<li>contain the provisions concerning the manner and form ofÂ future State laws amending State Constitutions;</li>
<li>contain provisions precluding any legal requirements forÂ Governors to withhold assent to Bills or to reserve them forÂ the Queen's pleasure.</li>
</ul><p>Further sections directly amend the Constitutions of WesternÂ Australia and Queensland by removing references to United KingdomÂ Ministers in the provisions relating to the Governors.</p>
