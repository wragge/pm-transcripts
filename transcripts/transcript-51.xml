CONFE2RENCE WIITH STATE PREMIERS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister<br />
The dates for the forthcoming Premiers' Conference<br />
would remain unchanged, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Menzies) said<br />
to-day. The conference will begin in Canberra on March 4,<br />
and is expected to last for three days.<br />
Mr. Menzies said, " W1e have considered suggestions<br />
that the date of the conference should be changed because three<br />
State elections will take place in March.<br />
" However, the conference will have some matters of<br />
urgency before it the position of the claimant States, for<br />
instance, cannot be too long deferred.<br />
" O0ther matters, such as finance for roads, need to<br />
be considered as soon as possible so that arrangements flowing<br />
from policy decisions made at the conference can be worked out<br />
before the end of the financial year.<br />
" For these reasons we have decided it would be<br />
impossible to postpone the conference until after the three<br />
State elections have been held.<br />
" In effect, this would have meant postponing the<br />
conference until about the end of April, as we would have to allow<br />
time for newly-elected Premiers to brief themselves on their<br />
State financial affairs.<br />
" I should add that I have not received a request<br />
from any of the Premiers for a postponement."<br />
