PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT SUNDAY, 1, JULY 1979<br />
SUNDAY REPORT<br />
Question: Prime Minister, you've just spent the last couple of days in<br />
negotiations with the Premiers of the various States, what will<br />
be the outcome of these negotiations, do you think, affecting<br />
the people who might be watching this programme tonight?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it depends on the area you're talking about. In the local<br />
Governing areas there's some good news. I have an election<br />
commitment to move their share of income tax collections up to<br />
Well, we're doing a substantial amount of that in this<br />
particular time, the rest of it will have to come next year. That<br />
will assist local Government. That can have an impact on ratepayers.<br />
They can either get better services or maybe the rise in<br />
rates can be held. Their own people can make decisions about that.<br />
The commitment to local Government is certainly being fulfilled in<br />
a very fair way. When you get into wider areas, a lot of the<br />
payments just go on being made whether it's for roads or other<br />
areas of activity that are important to people. I think at<br />
first sight, some people might be concerned about the apparent<br />
reductions in housing or loans programmes and wonder if that's<br />
going to affect people's home ownership, affect the more needy<br />
people in the community. We're going to have discussions, or<br />
Mr Green's going to have discussions with his State Housing<br />
counterparts because we want more of that housing money to go to<br />
pensioners housing. We want more of it to go to house Aborigines.<br />
These are amongst the neediest groups in the Australian<br />
community..-There's -one point that I think we need to<br />
understand and that is that we had to get to an overall result.<br />
We can't go on as Governments, State and Federal anymore than you<br />
can as a person or families can, go on spending more money than we<br />
earn, year after year. So we have to be restrained and that has<br />
to be shared with State Governments. Now we are commited by law<br />
to -a very large increase in revenue funds to the States, 13%-14%.<br />
The' States can spend that any way they like. If they want t~ o<br />
spend that on housing, or other public works of interest to their<br />
own people, they can and we hope they will., but because we had to<br />
restrain the overall amount of money, it meant we had to reduce in<br />
the areas where we could reduce and that was in the capital<br />
programmes.* In a sense that was unfortunate but the only alternative, in<br />
the way the arrangements have worked out, would be to make the<br />
total payments much too high and more than we can afford. So, if<br />
the States transfer their excess of the revenue funds and housing<br />
and capital works, I believe very strongly that these arrangements<br />
will contribute to economic recovery into the movement forward of<br />
the Australian economy and dire predictions of Premiers, I think,<br />
well, I think they're groundless but they won't have the dire impact<br />
that they're suggesting.<br />
Question: In New South Wales, at least, there was a great deal of concern<br />
because there was a lot of speculation, in fact a State Goverment / 2<br />
I </p>
<p>-2-<br />
announcement that many small hospitals would have to close down if<br />
the Commonwealth did not come up with more money. Is that going<br />
to happen?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't believe that will happen, it may well be that some<br />
hospital wards will close but if that's so, I think it's something<br />
that ought to happen, because the bed occupancy is, in many<br />
hospitals, under 70%. That means the hospital is staffed as<br />
though patients were in every bed but the average occupancy is such that<br />
only 6 or 7 out of every 10 beds has got a patient in it. In many<br />
countries there are much better rates than that, better utilization<br />
of the facilities and the cost to New South Wales I think is<br />
something like between $ 160 or $ 180 per day. It's one of the<br />
high cost States. We've Just got to restrain this area of<br />
Government expenditure and we want and are going to have, an<br />
inquiry into hospitals that we don't control--the States do, but<br />
we help fund them--to get to a situation where hospital facilities<br />
are going to be used rationally and sensibly. A number of<br />
states have come to me and said good luck to you in that, we think<br />
this is necessary, we think we're all spending more money than is<br />
necessary on hospitals for good health care. Now New South Wales<br />
conducted a scare campaign, they, I think, got in touch with all<br />
hospital managements and said, the terrible Commonwealth, they're<br />
not giving us enough money, you might have to shut. Well, that's<br />
grossly irresponsible, it's scare tactics and I would have thought<br />
that it should be possible for Governments to co-operate in a<br />
matter that is important, where we are spending your dollars and<br />
tax-payers dollars generally and try and seek a way of providing<br />
the best possible service at a reasonable cost, instead of an<br />
exorbitant cost.<br />
Question: On the matter of petrol prices the OPEC Ministers have just put up<br />
the price of petrol and I believe your Government has calculated<br />
that this will put up the price of our petrol by 3 or 4 or 5 cents<br />
per litre. I suppose a lot of people will be wondering now is this<br />
ever going to end?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, I hope it's going to end, that the OPEC countries are very<br />
unpredictable. I think what-' s happened in the current oil crisis<br />
is most unfortunate because inflation is going to get much worse in<br />
Europe, it will get worse in North America and it certainly won't<br />
help in Australia that our inflation is under theirs and we have a<br />
( inaudible) and control I think for much of Europe and ( inaudible)<br />
control in North America right at this time and it's our intention<br />
to keep it that way. I1 can't predict what the OPEC countries are<br />
going to do. But what we certainly have to do is try and use<br />
alternatives better. If we're using fuel oil, can we use coal? If<br />
we're using petrol cars, can we use gas-fired cars? A lot of taxis<br />
in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne are already on gas and future<br />
purchases of Commonwealth Government cars are going to be gas<br />
except for ones which are going to have to go out into areas where<br />
you can only buy petrol and that'll be a very large market. We've<br />
suggested the States do the same with their car fleets and if private<br />
individuals can also buy gas-fired cars instead of petrol, this will<br />
help to reduce our dependance on fuel oil. We've taken the sales ./ 3 </p>
<p>f -3-<br />
tax off, so it's a bit cheaper to convert, and we're hoping to be<br />
able to persuade the companies to have a gas production line so you<br />
can buy gas power for new and not have to get it converted.<br />
Question: Did that have a possibility in the near future?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think that is a very real possibility and this is why we made the<br />
decision to go to gas-powered cars, once our current contracts are<br />
wound up, which will be in about 12 month's time and we'll certainly<br />
be seeking consultations with the major companies in Australia to<br />
get them to do just that.<br />
Question: Did you offer them any incentive to do that?<br />
Prime minister:<br />
I think the real incentive for this is the type of gas fuel as<br />
opposed to petrol. I'm told in Melbourne a taxi will work out<br />
the cost, $ 600-$ 700 of conversion in 6-7 months-and after that it's<br />
all pure gain. Now that's a very, very great saving.<br />
Question: So, you think possibly a customer demand will force the big<br />
manufacturers to look at producing gas cars.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, we've already got one of the largest customers, the<br />
Commonwealth and if the States follow, there are going to be some<br />
very large customers indeed wanting a substantial number of cars each<br />
year and light commercial vehicles, who are going to say, look WE!<br />
want it gas-fired and if we do this and if a number of private<br />
individuals do, then I haven't got the slightest doubt that the<br />
fleet owners, the big companies if they follow our lead, and I<br />
think that in their interest and in Australia' s interest they ought<br />
to, then I've got no doubts that the motor companies will have a<br />
gas production line. 000---</p>
