CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN ALP WOMEN'S POLICY COMMITTEE<br />
ADELAIDE 21 MAY 1989<br />
South Australian women have always held a special place in<br />
the history of women's struggle for equality of opportunity<br />
in this country.<br />
In 1894 ninety five years ago the women of South<br />
Australia became the first in this nation and, after New<br />
Zealanders,. the first in the world, to win the right to<br />
vote. Today we celebrate a more recent anniversary, but one which<br />
in its way is also of great significance to the women of<br />
this State: the tenth anniversary of the establishement of<br />
the South Australian ALP Women's Policy Committee.<br />
For the last decade this Committee has encouraged women to<br />
voice their concerns to exercise their rights to get<br />
involved in policy development to work for the enhanced<br />
status of all women and to achieve their legitimate<br />
expectations for social justice and for equality of<br />
opportunity.<br />
No one looking at South Australia today no one looking at<br />
this audience today could deny the outstanding<br />
contributions to political life being made by South<br />
Australian women.<br />
With three women in the Cabinet, one of them having been the<br />
first woman President of the Legislative Council, and a<br />
dynamic contingent of women in the Party, South Australia<br />
provides a model of what can be achieved where there is the<br />
will and the capacity to do so.<br />
I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those women<br />
who have worked towards these goals over the last decade on<br />
the South Australian ALP Women's Policy Committee and in<br />
particular I recognise Rosemary Crowley for her major role<br />
over the years both as a member of the Committee and, more<br />
recently but no less effectively, as a member of the<br />
Australian Senate,.<br />
Labor of course has a proud record of encouraging the<br />
aspirations of individual women to contribute to the<br />
political process.<br />
19 52 </p>
<p>We can all be proud that when, last Thursday, Premiers and<br />
Chief Ministers from around Australia gathered in Canberra<br />
for the annual Premiers, Conference, there was for the first<br />
time a woman among them Rosemary Follett, Labor's Chief<br />
Minister in the new ACT Government.<br />
In Victoria, the Cain Government is the first in Australia<br />
to have appointed a women as its deputy leader Joan<br />
Ki rner.<br />
And in Canberra, the Government I have the honour of leading<br />
has been immeasurably strengthened by the contribution of<br />
women serving at Cabinet and Ministry level Susan Ryan,<br />
and now Ros Kelly and Margaret Reynolds, who is my Minister<br />
Assisting on the Status of Women.<br />
Indeed throughout the Labor Party, at Government level and<br />
right through to the branches, women are actively and<br />
constructively involved in every aspect of policy making.<br />
But in a sense more important than the role in the Labor<br />
party of individual women is the commitment of the Labor<br />
Party to all women to their equality of opportunity and to<br />
their economic security.<br />
The progress we have made at a Federal level over the past<br />
six years in raising the economic and social status of women<br />
has been unprecedented.<br />
We have striven to create an Australia which offers social<br />
justice for all.<br />
we have improved the status of women by enhancing economic<br />
security and independence, social justice, freedom from<br />
discrimination and equality of opportunity in all spheres of<br />
activity. Most of all, we have recognised that the best way towards<br />
improving the lot of women begins by listening to them.<br />
We have based our policies and programs on the needs which<br />
have been expressed to us from women around the country<br />
the young and the elderly, the healthy and the disabled,<br />
urban women, rural women, women in the paid workforce and<br />
women at home, women of Aboriginal and immigrant<br />
backgrounds. The Government's National Agenda for Women -our blueprint<br />
for raising the status of Australian women to the year 2000<br />
has been based on more than two years of consultation with<br />
some 25,000 women around the country. The National Agenda<br />
is by far the most comprehensive and progressive strategy<br />
for women ever produced by an Australian Goverriment or<br />
political party. 69 53 </p>
<p>Indeed, because we are the first Government to have<br />
developed a comprehensive policy document based on the<br />
United Nations' Forward Looking Strategies for Women, we can<br />
claim our National Agenda puts us in the first rank of<br />
nations acting on the status of women.<br />
This Government has had to face difficult economic times.<br />
That's a fact. And we have been prepared to make the tough<br />
decisions necessary to start turning that situation around.<br />
It is not surprising that during such a period of economic<br />
adjustment, Australian women have taken an increasing<br />
interest in economic issues.<br />
I am pleased to be able to say that in spite of the<br />
difficulties of our times, the position of women has<br />
improved considerably under this Government.<br />
Let me give you the proof of that.<br />
First, over the six years we have been in office we have<br />
created some 1.4 million new jobs, and we have cut the<br />
unemployment rate to a seven-year low of 6.1 per cent.<br />
Around 60 per cent of those 1.4 million new jobs created<br />
under Labor have gone to women that means around 750,000<br />
jobs.<br />
Women's unemployment rate has dropped from 10.4 per cent to<br />
6.7 per cent over the same period.<br />
The latest labour force figures show that just over half<br />
50.5 per cent of all women are now participating in the<br />
Australian labour force, a stark comparison with the 44.5<br />
per cent participation rate when we came to office.<br />
At the same time, we have been concerned with improving the<br />
quality of employment prospects and conditions for women.<br />
we have enacted three major pieces of legislation for<br />
affirmative action and equal employment opportunity<br />
programs, giving women equal opportunity and greater freedom<br />
from discrimination in employment.<br />
I comment in passing how disappointed I was to see that the<br />
new opposition front bench appointed by Andrew Peacock<br />
failed to find room for Senator Peter Baume. Senator Baume,<br />
I am sure you recall, resigned from the front bench in 1987<br />
over the Opposition's decision not to support a vital part<br />
of our equal employment opportunity legislation. In<br />
crossing the floor to support the Government, Peter Baume<br />
made a very important protest in defence of a vital<br />
principle and his exclusion from the Shadow Ministry shows<br />
he is still paying a very high price for that action.<br />
Second, this Government is proud of its achievements in<br />
increasing the access to and quality of education and<br />
training for women.<br />
G9r) 4 </p>
<p>we have dramatically lifted the number of schoolboys and<br />
girls who stay on at school to Year 12. Where fewer than<br />
four in ten girls were completing Year 12 before we came to<br />
office, now more than six in ten do so, and this level<br />
continues to rise.<br />
Under the National Policy for the Education of Girls, the<br />
first such national education policy, all Commonwealth,<br />
State and private educational institutions are following<br />
specified objectives to improve the performance of girls at<br />
school.<br />
we have also taken innovative steps to increase the access<br />
of young women to vocational training. The proportion of<br />
women enrolled in vocational and preparatory courses in TAFE<br />
has increased from 39 per cent in 1981 to 47 per cent in<br />
1986. More than 70 per cent of those participating in the<br />
Australian traineeship system are young women.<br />
The Government places a very high priority on measures to<br />
assist women to achieve economic independence. In a new<br />
approach, the Jobs, Education and Training ( JET) initiative<br />
provides sole parents, the majority of whom are women, with<br />
the opportunity to gain the skills necessary for successful<br />
workforce entry.<br />
Third, and inextricably linked to the economic independence<br />
of women, is the issue of childcare. Again, we have a proud<br />
story to tell.<br />
Fulfilling the commitment set in the National Agenda for<br />
women, we are committed to the provision of quality and<br />
affordable child care. in any given week, some 132,000<br />
Australian families benefit from our child care services.<br />
The National Child Care Strategy we announced in the last<br />
Budget will provide 30,000 new child care places over the<br />
next three years.<br />
The strategy includes incentives to encourage industry to<br />
invest in the provision of child care for their employees.<br />
I am pleased to announce today that my Government and John<br />
Bannon's have just reached an agreement to provide more<br />
child care places in South Australia.<br />
It's a three year agreement that will provide nearly 2,500<br />
new child care places in the State most of them providing<br />
care outside school-hours, providing real assistance to<br />
working parents of school children.<br />
By 1992, a total of 98,000 additional childcarv places will<br />
have been funded by this Government a trebling of places<br />
since we took office in 1983.<br />
Fourth, we have extended unprecedented assistance to women<br />
on low incomes. 1 </p>
<p>The Government has offered relief to women on pensions and<br />
benefits or earning low incomes through the historic Family<br />
Allowance Supplement; the establishment of the Child Support<br />
Agency and, of course, the package of measures announced in<br />
the Treasurer's April Statement.<br />
Tax cuts, particularly the reduction of the lower rates,<br />
will benefit many women workers. Dramatic increases in<br />
Family Allowance payments, additional payments for families<br />
in receipt of the Family Allowance Supplement and further<br />
assistance for one income families will all contribute to<br />
the improvement in lifestyle of a large number of Australian<br />
women. Finally, let me touch on two recent initiatives to improve<br />
the status of women.<br />
Early last month I launched Domestic violence Awareness<br />
Month. The Government has allocated $ 1.6 million over three<br />
years to change community attitudes towards this tragic and<br />
inexcusable blight on our society.<br />
Also in April I launched the National women's Health Policy,<br />
developed after consultation with more than one million<br />
Australian women. Good health and safety are fundamental<br />
elements of any woman's well being.<br />
I have given a personal commitment that the National Women's<br />
Health Policy will receive very close and sympathetic<br />
attention from Federal Cabinet in the 1989-90 Budget<br />
process. Both these April initiatives are of major importance in the<br />
Government's overall strategy for women.<br />
Having outlined today the breadth of this Government's<br />
achievements for women, may I conclude by reaffirming this<br />
vital fact. Measures adopted to improve the standing of<br />
women, as important as they are to the women who directly<br />
receive them, also benefit, in an essential and concrete<br />
fashion, the entire population. In particular they benefit<br />
Australian families..<br />
Lifting the status of Australian women, widening their<br />
opportunities in the workforce, improving their conditions<br />
at home, affording them better health and better access to<br />
services, is the sensible approach for this country.<br />
It's in a real sense the only approach for this country.<br />
And let me assure you that the achievements of the past in<br />
no way obscure our recognition of the hard work that still<br />
needs to be done. We cannot afford to be complacent or to<br />
ignore the injustices and obstacles that Australian women<br />
confront every day.<br />
our goal is clear. Every Australian woman deserves a say, a<br />
choice and a fair go.<br />
G1) 19 1 </p>
<p>The tireless work of organisations such as the ALP Women's<br />
Policy Committee in South Australia will ensure that Labor<br />
Governments, on a State and Federal level will keep in touch<br />
with, and respond to, the needs of Australian women. f; 15' 7 </p>
