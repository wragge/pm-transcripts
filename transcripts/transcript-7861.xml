PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 DECEMBER 1989<br />
I am delighted that the Dalai Lama's long-standing and<br />
peaceful attempts to improve the lot of the Tibetan<br />
people have been recognised by the award of the Nobel<br />
Peace Prize.<br />
I join many other members of the international community<br />
in offering my congratulations to the Dalai Lama. The<br />
Australian Government hopes that the award will<br />
contribote to reducing tensions in Tibet and will help<br />
the Tibetan people achieve the universal standards of<br />
human rights they are entitled to expect.<br />
Australia acknowledges that Tibet is part of China. But<br />
we consider it important that universally accepted<br />
standards of human rights are observed there, including<br />
the right of Tibetans to practice their cultural and<br />
religio" s traditions. We are particularly concerned<br />
about reports from Tibet of detentions of people engaged<br />
in peaceful demonstrations, ill treatment of prisoners<br />
and harsh sentences for dissidents.<br />
We have conveyed to the Chinese Government on a number<br />
of occasions our concerns over the human rights<br />
situation in Tibet. We will continue to do so whenever<br />
necessary. 1Vf1Z) Q'_' 7 V-14D no. 000 r. VZ </p>
