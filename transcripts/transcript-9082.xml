TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MID<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
16 DECEMBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: Well, the Uruguay Round of the GAT -T,_ long in the making, has finally<br />
come to a conclusion. And, for those of us who have been talking about it for<br />
so long, and participating in it for so long, one would have to say, it is well<br />
worth the wait. And it has been well worth the wait.<br />
Because the Government has had an approach to trade, to multi laterali sm,<br />
and to open markets right through its history, from 1983, and the changes of<br />
which we have made in opening Australia up and in reducing tariff protection,<br />
and abolishing'quotas on the 1 960s, all of those things were predicated upon<br />
us having an open trading opportunity in the GATT Round, of the likelihood of<br />
the GATT actually coming to some conclusion.<br />
Now, as a consequence, we have built Australia's policy expressly on the<br />
GATT Round. And the GATT Round has now come to fruition and as a result<br />
there will be at least conservatively $ 2.5 billion worth of benefits for Australia,<br />
including $ 1 billion of benefits from an agreement on agriculture. And they<br />
mean that there will be cuts in subsidised export volumes of 21 per cent by<br />
the end of the 6 year period, the elimination of non tariff barriers by<br />
conversion to more transparent tariffs, -an average cut-in agricultural tariffs of<br />
36 per cent, a 20 per cent cut in trade sorting domestic subsidies for farm<br />
production and incomes.<br />
Across Australia's key agricultural exports this could see an extra $ 340<br />
million per annumn in beef exports, $ 200 $ 250 million in wheat exports, $ 125<br />
million in dairy, $ 90 million in coarse grains, $ 40 million in sugar, and<br />
million to rice growers. So, this is, in a nut shell, a very substantial outcome<br />
which could only, in agriculture, be achieved by a multilateral trade<br />
agreement. And, of course, in agriculture it wouldn't have been achieved<br />
without Australia injecting agriculture into the Round, in putting the Cairns<br />
Group together, and in fighting the agriculture issue right down to the end. </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
Now, what it will mean is that in terms of the US and EC subsidised export<br />
sale of wheat, which will give an indication, there wilt be 50 million tonnes<br />
less subsidised wheat and flour over world markets over a six year period.<br />
US and EC subsidised wheat exports are likely to be--down by a third by the<br />
year 2000 compared to current levels. But because it was expected that EC<br />
and US subsidised wheat exports would grow, the outcome will now actually<br />
b~ e about a half the expected level. It is a third off the current level, but about<br />
half the expected level of wh~ ere it would be by the year 2000.<br />
So, this is a fairly remarkable change. And other important breakthroughs<br />
have been In other key agricultural markets; in the US there will be a 25 per<br />
cent increase in access for Australian beef in 1995 compared with the level in<br />
prospect for 1994. In Japan the rice ban will be lifted and rice imports will<br />
grow to around 800,000 tonnes by the year 2000 that is around twice<br />
Australia's total current rice export and tariffs on beef, dairy and sugar will<br />
be reduced. In the European community area access will improve for<br />
Australian exports of meat, milk, powder, butter and cheese. And we have<br />
also continued the European assurance not to sell subsidised beef exports to<br />
key Asian markets which has undefined growth in Australian exports to these<br />
markets of 200 per cent since 1985.<br />
So, that's the picture in respect of agriculture. I will just say something in<br />
respect of manufacturing on industrial goods we expect average tariff cuts<br />
on the products of interest to us to be over 50 per cent, as closely as we can<br />
calculate it to be about 53 per cent. Now, that is the tariffs of other countries<br />
which we are facing in terms of our products, including key product areas<br />
such as, non ferrous metals, medical and scientific equipment,<br />
pharmaceuticals, chemicals and beer. The United States, and the European<br />
community, and Japanese offers represent tariff cuts of around 60 per cent,<br />
and alone cover Australian exports totalling $ 18 billion. So, $ 18 billion of our<br />
exports now will be dealt with by this reduction of tariff cuts in the US and<br />
European community, and Japan, of over 60 per cent.<br />
The new GATT agreement on services ensures Australian service exporters<br />
can compete on an equal footing in the fastest growing area of world trade,<br />
and that, as you know, is growing very rapidly for us.<br />
So, I might also add that Senator Cook has over night obtained an agreement<br />
from the United States that it will not export subsidised rice to the Japanese<br />
and Korean rice markets, so our farmers will be competing on a level playing<br />
field there.<br />
There has been much, can I just say on the question of the export<br />
enhancement program, which has been an issue in Australia with the United<br />
States. I just can't put my hand on the figure but there is a substantial<br />
reduction in the impact of that, from about $ 1 billion of subsidised product to<br />
about $ 3.40 million over the six year period. So, all in all, I think this has been<br />
a remarkable outcome. Its the largest ever world trade deal and an<br />
enormous shot in the arm for the world economy. At a time when economies<br />
r1EL2: .3an. 94 12: 30 No. 006 P. 03 </p>
<p>TEL: 3<br />
have been struggling to grow, that we are seeing growth of ourselves, the<br />
United States growing, Japan still finding itself in recession, Germany the<br />
same, this will be a huge boost to confidence. Apart from the financial effects<br />
and commercial effects this will be a huge boost to cor-fidence.<br />
The OECD has estimated that for agricultural and industrial products alone, it<br />
will result in an increase in global economic activity of up to $ 418 billion by<br />
the year 2002. And, as I have said, that translates to us at about $ 2.5 billion<br />
per year. More recent assessments by the Industry Commission suggest<br />
there may be as much as $ 5 billion increase in exports and a $ 3.7 billion<br />
increase in Australian GDP.<br />
So, it's a tremendously important outcome and could I say that a statement<br />
issued today by the Trade Negotiations Advisory Group, by Geoff Allen... it<br />
said, ' The Australian business community is delighted with the achievement<br />
of a meaningful result in the Uruguay Round; we will not get all we want but<br />
the result will be overwhelmingly positive for all Australians. In this eighth<br />
round of negotiations under the GATT there has been unprecedented<br />
cooperation between government and the business sectors, it has<br />
represented a model for close government/ business collaboration in<br />
international affairs."'<br />
So, I'd like to, again, record my appreciation for the work which has been<br />
done jointly by Australian business, with the government. But, again, I signal<br />
that what has happened here is a very definite view, by the government, of<br />
the kind of society and country it wanted Australia to be. And that was an<br />
efficient, open, exporting country. And that's changed from the day we<br />
removed exchange controls in 1983 and started reducing tariffs in 1988.<br />
And, as a consequence, we're now set up to face the world but it wanted, in<br />
our terms, to be a world which was open and more free. This we've achieved<br />
under the GATT and, of course, where the GATT leaves off APEC will take<br />
over in the Asia-Pacific where we can do other things of the trade facilitating<br />
kind which are not part of the general reductions in protection under the<br />
GATT. So, Australia has been turned into a competitive,. open,. trading economyby<br />
a Labor government and then we have set in place structures; by<br />
putting together the Cairns Group in the Uruguay Round and getting<br />
agriculture into the round... set in place structures which will also help now<br />
with APEC to complement, again, the work of the GATT. So, in all, Australia<br />
should be well placed to grow its commercial sectors as our economy picks<br />
up and our competitiveness is now so strong. And, I think, as a leader of the<br />
Cairns Group we have, at the same time, played a role for those countries in<br />
the Cairns Group of countries and, not just played a role but kept faith on the<br />
big issues which are important to them.<br />
I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Peter Cook and his negotiating<br />
team in Geneva on the effort that they have led in the last week, but most<br />
particularly in the last year. I'd also like to thank those who have been<br />
T1E2L:. 3an. 94 12: 30 No. 006 P. 04 </p>
<p>TEU; 4<br />
involved in this over such a long time seven years. In the first place, the<br />
Treasurer who was then Minister for Trade and who put the Cairns Group<br />
together, John Dawkins, followed by Michael Duffy who pl5-yed a -very<br />
important role at a key time in the round, as also did.-Weal Bleweti and John<br />
Kerin. This has occupied the time of many ministers and many officials, I<br />
might say, who have had to endure those many nights locked up in hotel<br />
rooms and conference rooms arguing over these points. One of those people<br />
is with us today, Peter Field, and I'd like to pay a tribute to Peter's work as<br />
Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ( DFAT) who<br />
had the principal carriage of this responsibility for most of the period and<br />
other people of DFAT who were involved in it throughout the period.<br />
So, could I wrap up my remarks by saying it's a tip-top outcome for Australia,<br />
well worth the wait, the largest world trade deal ever done, a great thing for<br />
the world economy, a bull point for markets around the world and giving<br />
Australia the trading environment it could only have dreamed of seven years<br />
ago. J: Can you bring all these billions home to average Australia? What's it<br />
going to mean to workers, to families, to young people?<br />
PM: Well, it's going to mean a pick-up in employment the best we can<br />
estimate this at quickly is around 50,000 jobs which is a very large<br />
complement. It's going to add another $ 3.5 billion to Australia's GDP<br />
which is an Important addition. And what it means is that we'll have<br />
the confidence that as we grow these markets and commodities of<br />
ours, we'll be growing them into markets where we have access. So,<br />
the confidence that Australians and their children will have jobs and<br />
that they'll be able to trade Into this area, into these markets, will, I<br />
think, be very high.<br />
The GATT Round, the GATT outcome is largely an employment and<br />
wealth outcome. And, I said recently, GATT equals growth equals jobs<br />
I'd repeat that and say this is a place where Australia's view of itself<br />
and Australian diplomacy has played a really important role.<br />
J: When do you think that Australia will actually start seeing some of<br />
these benefits flow through? The implementation period on most of<br />
these doesn't start until 1995 but do you expect any immediate<br />
benefit?<br />
PM: Well, that's when it does start. I th ink that it's going to flow through<br />
earlier because, like all of these things like the time we announced<br />
tariff reductions behaviour changes almost Instantaneously before<br />
the actual changes take place. And I think this will be true here<br />
you'll see a change in the way countries approach markets. When<br />
they know protection Is coming down and they know they're going to<br />
have to earn their keep in these markets they start changing their<br />
E': 12. Jan. 934 1 e3V </p>
<p>TEL,<br />
habits and I think, as a consequence, it will start to pay off for us much<br />
earlier rather than later.<br />
J: Do you think we'll get an even better outcome' with the negotiations<br />
that Peter Cook's still going on with in Geneva?<br />
PM: Well, I think it's a case of watching the bouncing ball. Obviously, in<br />
particularly some commodities, these things are changing by the hour<br />
and that's why you have to be on the spot, you have to be in there for<br />
your chop and arguing your case. And Peter Cook, who has rung me<br />
a couple of times since the weekend, has been in there arguing his<br />
case on these particular things. Arid, I might just say, he just turned up<br />
another one on rice, by getting that assurance from the United States<br />
that they will not be exporting subsidised rice to those two markets<br />
which I mentioned Japan and Korea.<br />
J: Are there any further details about that rice assurance from the<br />
Americans?<br />
PM: We've got officials here and you're welcome to talk to them after I'm<br />
finished, if you like.<br />
J: The United States has been fairly generous with its market access<br />
package but the European Community doesn't seem to have been,<br />
does that disappoint you?<br />
PM: Well, I think the Europeans will pay a price for holding onto the tenets<br />
of protectionism in some of these areas and I think this is going to be<br />
an expensive lesson that you can't hope to give Europeans the<br />
living standards that they wish and the income and employment levels<br />
that they wish if a large part of their product is being funnelled into<br />
subsidies for agriculture. And while it may suit a particular political<br />
need at the time I don't think, over time, it's going to help. A couple of<br />
key things have happened in the United States that are well worth<br />
recording... one is the very deliberative vote of the American Congress<br />
in favour of NAFTA -which is a-trade liberalising--decision-. and -now. the<br />
support through three administrations Reagan, Bush and the Clinton<br />
administration for the GATT round and open trade and the fact that<br />
they have held on to the Blair House. Sure, the impact will come a<br />
little later rather than earlier, but it is largely held there I think speaks<br />
volumes for the United States view of open multi-lateral trade. This is<br />
not the view of the European community, It is the view of some<br />
members of the European community, but it is not the view of some<br />
countries and as a consequence the rest of us will have a higher<br />
standard of living and better incomes relatively speaking than will<br />
Europe as a consequence. T1EL2:. Jan. 94 12: 30 No. 006 P. 06 </p>
<p>TEL: 6<br />
J* Prime Minister, there was one area that the United States specifically<br />
wanted us to open our markets on and that was access to their<br />
television and film material. Have we given any ground on that?<br />
PM: No, we value substantially the maintenance of our capacity to produce<br />
cultural material here which reflects our own culture and our own<br />
needs and while we see value in general trade in these particular<br />
commodities and there is, as you know, Australian audio visual<br />
services take a lot of American product, we still have a cultural product<br />
to protect and we have argued that case. I think what has happened<br />
so too has the French and others and there has been an agreement to<br />
disagree on the part of the United States and European community on<br />
this question. So audio visual has effectively fallen out of the Round<br />
and with it falls away any need for a commitment by Australia.<br />
J: Is it possible to spell out what changes we will have to make to our<br />
own rules as a result of this sort of zero, zero agreements and other..<br />
PM: I think you can ask the officials Tim ( Dodd) and they would be glad to<br />
tell you.<br />
J, With the boost that this will give business competence, what effect for<br />
the European, American economies and recoveries and then what<br />
effect for ours?<br />
PM: There has been a very large change in the United States economy as<br />
there has in Australia, a lot of de leveraging by companies, essentially<br />
the accounts of most companies are now in better shape as you know.<br />
In this country our profit share Is very high; we are starting to see<br />
investment take off again; we have seen very strong profit<br />
performances and therefore a strong stock market performance, a lot<br />
of capital has been raised; a lot of capital has been marshalled. I think<br />
a decision like this, an outcome like this just adds to that aura of<br />
confidence which is developing around the motor economies and<br />
those which still have troubles which are still going through de<br />
leveraging in the case of Japan. and -the problems -of. integration. in the<br />
case of Germany that is the integration with East Germany, the GDR.<br />
Those things have been real inhibitions for those economies taking off,<br />
but this is just such an obviously good outcome world wide that it must<br />
be a tremendous bull point in markets.<br />
J: What does this deal mean in terms of future government policy. Do<br />
you see it taking away from protectionism accelerated in the next few<br />
years?<br />
PM;-I don't think so because we have already had it when I say the trend<br />
away it will be a maintenance of the trend towards lower levels of<br />
protection which we have in place on a trend basis, a trend decline in<br />
protection. We removed all quotas from our markets in the late 1 980s<br />

and now with tariffication, tariffs in this country being the only effective<br />
protective devices those travelling down to 5 per cent by 1996-97 and<br />
in some cases a little higher. I think what this means is tat all of this<br />
has proven to us that we were correct in the. first place in following<br />
through on a strategy of multi lateral trade, support for an open multi<br />
lateral trading system and every effort even though it has been<br />
laborious that we put into the GATT Round is worth it in the end not<br />
to see the world break up into trading blocs and I think that now won't<br />
happen. And the Europeans will make a choice when they look at the<br />
Asia-Pacific and the growth of the Asia-Pacific and the lift in incomes<br />
and employment in the Asia-Pacific now that the world is not going into<br />
three blocs, but there is a general GATT back drop, but two trading<br />
areas Europe and the Asia-Pacific the Europeans will have to<br />
decide whether they want to be at the cutting edge of all this or<br />
whether they want to try and hide behind protective barriers or do<br />
trade distorting things, because, in the end it catches up with you and<br />
it will catch up with them.<br />
So, there is great competition in Europe going to come from the Asia-<br />
Pacific and they can be in the competition by having open product<br />
markets or they can try to resist it.<br />
J: Does this mean the outcome then that you can increase the pace of<br />
APEC's development. Do you now have any specific initiatives that<br />
you would like to see APEC.<br />
PM: I have always talked of APEC as a GATT plus outfit that is, it did<br />
GATT plus things. These things become part of the back~ drop, the<br />
GATT becomes part of the back drop, but in the things which the<br />
GAIT is not doing and can't do, that is in trade facilitating type things,<br />
this is going to be one of the strengths of APEC. rhat is, in things like<br />
investment agreements, in things like company law, in things like<br />
consumer product standards, all of these kinds of things are things an<br />
organisation like APEC can do, but the GATT can't do. So, that is why<br />
I think if we make a choice in this part of the world for faster growth<br />
and a higher velocity of -trade and investment we -could facilitate it<br />
through APEC. So too can the Europeans, through the European<br />
community, but they have got to want to do the same things and I don't<br />
know whether they will. Before APEC we didn't have such a structure.<br />
With APEC we do have now such a structure and happily it will build<br />
upon the GATT and there will be no question of it replacing the GAIT<br />
or doing something with APEC that might have needed to be done in<br />
the event the GAIT Round failed.<br />
So, it will be basically GAIT plus things, things will enhance the<br />
outcome and make it better for all of us.<br />
J: that you like the senior officials to adopt..<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 12. Jan. 94 12: 30 No. 006 P. 09<br />
PM: The last lot was a very large speech I gave in California which outlined<br />
some of the directions we think APEC should go and we articulated<br />
some of those at the ministerial meeting in Seattle.<br />
J: One of the things which was one of our highest priorities in the Round<br />
was to ask our Asian friends to reduce their tariff barriers to<br />
manufactured products from Australia they had tariff escalation of<br />
low tariffs on raw materials, high tariffs on finished products, Are you<br />
happy with the success we have..<br />
PM: It is 53 per cent across the board of the countries we deal with on the<br />
weighting of the products we handle, so that one has to say is a<br />
spectacular change from any multi lateral trade round. There is no<br />
doubt whatever people do with this, looking at it and turning up this<br />
leave and having a look at that point, it is by far and away the most<br />
spectacular outcome from a multi lateral trading round that we have<br />
ever had. I wouldn't be surprised to say likely to have, but certainly<br />
that we have ever had it to this point. Thank you..<br />
