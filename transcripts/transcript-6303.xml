AUS'Tl IA LLADDRESS<br />
TO LUNCHEON GIVEN BY THE FIVE PRINCIPAL JAPANESE<br />
ECONOMIC ORGANISATIONS, TOKYO, 1 FEBRUARY 1984<br />
I AM DELIGHTED. TO 12E YOJR GUEST ON THIS, ' MY F. IRST VISIT<br />
TO JAPAN AS AUS RALIA'S'PR! M-1M1INISTER,<br />
MY* VISIT* COME* S AT A T I ME WHEN BOTH AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN<br />
ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO ~ i RECONOMY. C TIMES THAN 11E HAVE<br />
KNOWN IN TINE RECENT P AS-11<br />
AUSTRALIA S ECONOMY* IS PERFORMING BETTER THAN OUR. MORE<br />
OPTIMISTIC FOIRECASTERS THOUGHT POSSIBLE EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO.<br />
SOME' RECENT STRAINS IN. AUSTRALIA' S TRADING RELATIONS WITH<br />
JAPAN HAVE RESULT. ED FROM RECESSIOtil,* AND WILL BE EASED BY<br />
THE RETURN TO ' BETTER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,<br />
A MORE OPTIMISTIC ECONOMlIC OUTLOOK ALSO PROVIDJES A B3ETTER<br />
ENVIRONMENT FOR EACHOF US TO ADDRESS STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS'<br />
THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF DEVELOPING A MObRE BROADLY-BASED<br />
AND COMPLEMENTARY TRADING RELATIONSHIP,<br />
BOTH AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN ALSO HAVE MUCH TO GAIN FROM<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK OF NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES<br />
IN THE PACIFIC REGION, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, CANADA,<br />
AND THE WESTERN PACIFIC DEVELOPING CCUNTRIESi SOME OF WHICH<br />
I 14ILL BE VISITING OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. </p>
<p>21<br />
I BUT THE INTERNATIONAL RECOVERY IS NOT YE' WIDELY BASEOJ<br />
AND THE WORLD ECONOMY IS STILL FACING SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES<br />
-AND UNCERTAINTY.<br />
TODAY, I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THREE MAJOR ISSUES,<br />
FIRST, THE ' PERFORMANCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY AND THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO USING THIS RECOVERY<br />
AS A SPRINGBOARD FROM WHICH TO REACH FOR SUSTAINED<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH PERFORMANCE.<br />
SECOND, SOME ISSUES IN AUSTRALIA S ECONOMIC RELATIONS<br />
WITH JAPAN AT THIS TURNING POINT IN CUR ECONOMIC. FORTUNES.<br />
THIRD, I WILL OFFER SOME VIEWS FROM AN AUSTRALIAN<br />
PERSPECTIVE ON CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF THE WIDER<br />
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN RECOVERY<br />
FROM LATE 1981 UNTIL THE JUNE QUARTER OF THIS YEAR<br />
AUSTRALIA EXPERIENCED PARTICULARLY SHARP AND DEEP RECESSION,<br />
THE RECESSION IN AUSTRALIA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A<br />
DISASTROUS DECLINE IN EMPLOYMENT AND RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
DESPITE THE RECESSION, INFLATION WAS OVER 11 PER CENT IN<br />
THE YEAR PRIOR TO MY GOVERNMENT TAKING OFFICE IN MARCH.<br />
LAST YEAR TWICE THE RATE IN MOST MAJOR OECD COUNTRIES, i </p>
<p>3.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE CHARCED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
S OF INCREASING EMPLOYMENT AND REDUCING INFLATION AT THE<br />
-i SAME TIME.<br />
AT THE CENTRE OF MY GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO MEETING THIS<br />
RESPONSIBILITY WAS OUR BELIEF THAT CLOSE CO-OPERATION WAS<br />
REQUIRED AMONG ALL PARTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY,<br />
THIS BELIEF WAS REFLECTED FIRST IN AN ACCORD BETW1EEN MY<br />
. PARTY,, THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, AND THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL<br />
OF TRADE UNIONS.<br />
THIS PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD INVOLVES:<br />
A COMMITMENT FROM THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT TO FIRM WAGE<br />
RESTRAINT WITHIN THE CENTRALISED WAGE-SETTING FRAMEWORK<br />
THAT IS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL LIFE<br />
A COMMITMENT ' FROM THE LABOR GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT ASERIES<br />
OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIES, INCLUDING<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN ACCESS TO MEDICAL AND SOME OTHER SERVICES<br />
A COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO CONSULT THE TRADE<br />
UNION MOVEMENT ON MAJOR ECONOMIC POLICY MATTERS<br />
AFFECTING ORGANIZED LABOUR,<br />
AT THE HEART OF THE ACCORD IS THE SEARCH FOR COMMUNITY<br />
CONSENSUS AND A MORE CO-OPERATIVE, LESS COMBATIVE MEANS OF<br />
DETERMINING WAGE AND INCOME LEVELS. </p>
<p>14<br />
THAT SEARCH'FOR CONSENSUS WAS TAKEN FURTHER WHEN MY<br />
GOVERNMENT CONVENED A NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE<br />
WITIMN NTHOFTAK( ING OFFICE, IN APRIL LAST YEAR,,<br />
PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED RRPRESENTATI\' ES OF 5MMAL,: STATt-AM) LOZAl-<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN AUSTRALIA, ALL MEMB~ ERS OF THE EXECUTIVE OF<br />
* THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS AND<br />
BUSINESS LEADERS.<br />
THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE HAS LAID THE BASIS FOR ACHIEVING<br />
* LONG-TERM CO-OPERATJON AMO,, 1NG THE VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMLMUNITYI<br />
WE I N AUSTRALIA ARE WORKING TOWARD~ A CLIMATE OF NATIONAL<br />
UNITY, NATIONAL RECONCILI. ATION, NATIONAL PURPOSE.<br />
THE IMPORTANCE OF SEARCHING FOR CONSENSUS WOULD NOT* BE<br />
LOST ON* THIS AUDIENCE. t<br />
HERE IN JAPAN THERE IS A KEEN. APPRECIATrION OF THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF DRAWING IN ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, OF<br />
ACHIEVING A COMMON PURPOSE, OF REACHING A CONSENSUS$<br />
WE IN AUSTRALIA, WITHIN A VERY DIFFERENT CULTURAL AND<br />
INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, ARE NOW ENDEAVOURING TO ACHIEVE<br />
SOMETHING OF THAT SAME APPROACH. I. o 5/ 1. </p>
<p>INDEED MY GOVERNMENT HfiS ElhJ3AR1ED ON-' A FUNDAMENTALLY<br />
DIFFERENT STYLE OF NATIO. NAL EC. OiNOMIXC MANAGEMENTI<br />
NEW STRUCTURES AND MECHANISMS OF ECONOf-4C DECISION-MAKING<br />
HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACED*<br />
THEY. ARE NOT ON LY CONTRIB3UTING TO THE POLICXES NEEDED TO<br />
DEAL I ITH CURRENT. C IRCUtSTANCE; S, BUT ARE Al.-SO FUNDAMENTALLY<br />
CHANGING T HE MANNER IN WHICH AUSTRALXANS THINK ABlOUT<br />
ECONOMIC ISSUES AND THE FUTUPRE D IR EC I ON OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY.<br />
-A CLIMATE~ OF COINFI DfaCE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHEDO<br />
SINCE THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC* SUMMIT CONFEREN7JCE, WE HAVE<br />
* DEVELOPED THE PRACTICE OF CONSULTAT. ION ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL<br />
POLICY THROUGH A NEW ECONOMIC PLANNING ADVISORY COUNCIL<br />
* AND THROUGH A-1WIDE . RANGE OF CLOSE BUT LESS FORMAL PROCESSESI<br />
WHILE WE CANNOT EXPECT COMPLETE AGREEM4ENT ON ECONOMIC<br />
POLICY IN A DEMOCRACY, THERE IS WIDE AND STRONG SUPPORT<br />
FOR THE MAIN ELEMENTS. OF OUR ECONOMIC POLICY$<br />
WE HAVE PURSUED FIRM BUT NOT TIGHT MONETARY POLICIES,<br />
DESIGNED TO ALLOW STRONG GROWTH, BUT NOT TO FUEL INFLATION.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN ALMOST UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE BY AUSTRALIAN<br />
TRADE UNIONS OF THE WAGE RESTRAINT REQUIRED BY THE PRICES<br />
AND INCOMES ACCORD. Ie 1 6 </p>
<p>WITHIN THE ACCOR' 1,, tNOST AUSTRALI/ N' VORlK'ERS RECEIVf'ED A<br />
WAGE INCREASE or-4,3 PSR. CENT IN 193), INCREASES IN 19304<br />
ARE-NOT LIKELY TO B~ E SIGNIFICANTLY Gr,, EA'TERc<br />
THESE* INCREASES ARE VERY SMALL COM1PARED WITH AUSTRALIAN<br />
EXPERIENCE IN THE YEARS PRECEDING HlY GOVERNIMENT S TAKING<br />
IN PREPARING OUR FIRST BUDGI: ET,. WE JUDGED IT APPROPPIATE<br />
TO PURSUE EXPANSIONARY FISCAL FOLICIE$;. THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
' GOVERNMENT. S FISCAL DEFICiT IN TH62 CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR<br />
* WI 111 E AROUND FOUR AND A HALF PER CENT O f GROSS DOMESTIC<br />
PRODUCTO<br />
OUR POLICIES HAVE-POSITIONED AUSTRALIA WELL TO T A E<br />
ADVANTrAGE OF THE STIMULUS PROVIDED BY THE ENDING OF A<br />
DEBILITATING DROUGHT AND THE BEGINNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
THE ECONOMIC DECLINE ENDED SHARPLY, AND TURNED INTO STRONG<br />
RECOVERY IN THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER LAST YEAR.<br />
REAL GROWTH IN THAT QUARTER WAS OVER 4 PER CENT, HALF COMING<br />
FROM THE FARM AND HALF FROM THE NON-FARM SECTOR.<br />
A WIDE RANGE OF INDICATORS POINT TO THE CONTINUATION OF<br />
STRONG GROWTH SINCE THEN. 9 97/ </p>
<p>WE ARE GRATIFIED ' fHA ' rMI LOY1IL~ NT HAS RESPOND) ED OUICK( LY<br />
TO THE REN2WAI. Or-GROV17h. b WITHf~ JOBS . EXPAND: ING BY TW-, O AND<br />

LAST YEAR. SEASONALLY ADJJUSTED UiNEMPLOYMENT FELL FROM<br />
13PER CENT lylAlP RIL TO 9,2 PER CFNT AT. THE END OF THE YEAR0<br />
WE HAVE ALSO MADE SOME PR~ OGRESS IN. BRING1ING DO0WN INF~ LATION<br />
FROM 11-PER CENT IN 1912 70 8.6 PER CENT IN 19830<br />
WE LOOK FORWARD TO GROWTH IN TOTAL GROSS DOM1ESTIC PRODUCT<br />
OF AROUND. 8 PER CENT AND IN NONFflPOUCOFAON 6<br />
* PER CENT THROUGH~ THE CUrcrihENT FXNANCIAL YEAR48 AND THE<br />
* CONTINUATION OF STRONG GlI3WTH IN J11-L85. 11E ARF, ALSO<br />
CONFIDENT THAT THE I N F LPkTN RATE W ILL AGA IN FALL,<br />
THE MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE TASK IS FOR THE GOVERNMENT<br />
TO BROADEN THE RECOVERY INTO AREAS THAT REMAIN WEAK<br />
INCLUDING PRIVATE INVESTMENT.# AND TO SUSTAIN THE RECOVERY<br />
INTO THE FUTURE.<br />
THIS WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED INCOMES RESTRAINT WITHIN THE<br />
FRAMEWORK OF THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD.<br />
IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE US TO AVOID EXCESSIVE PRESSURE IN<br />
FINANCIAL MARKETS, BY ENSURING THAT THE SETTING OF NEXT<br />
YEAR IS BUDGET DEFICIT TAKES FULL ACCOUNT OF TH E TNCREASED<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR BORROW4ING REQUIREMENTS TO FINANCE HIGHER<br />
LEVELS OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT. </p>
<p>WE ARE CONFIDE'NT THAT TH: SE. TrO NIECUIREMENTS CAN BE NiET,<br />
MY GOVERNMENT BELXEVES THAT 7Tl; NEW\ APPROACH-1S TO MACROECONOM1<br />
1C MANAGEMiENT THAT IE ' HAVE I MPLEMENTED SINCE TAKING<br />
OFFICE ARE NECESSARY NOT ONLY FOR RECOVERY FROM RECESSION,<br />
BUT ALSO FOR LONG-TERM GRO1WTHO<br />
BUT SUSTAINING STRONG GROi, lTHl OVER LONG PERIODS WILL<br />
REQUIRE NEW ATTITUDES AND POLICIES IN OTHER AREAS AS WELLo<br />
IT WILL REQUIRE HIGH' LEVELS OF INVESTMENT FROM hME AND ABROADD<br />
AUSTRALIA'S HIGH RATE OF SAVINGS OUT OF INCOMES, WHILE NOT<br />
AS HIGH AS JAPAN ' S PROVIIDES A GOOD BASIS FOR HIGH LEVELS OF<br />
DOMESTIC INVESTMENT.<br />
DOMESTIC SAVINGS WILL NEED TO BE COMPLEMENTED BY INVESTMENT'<br />
FROM ABROAD, MY GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY CONFIRMED THE.<br />
MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE POLICIES ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT WHICH<br />
HAVE HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SINCE THEY WERE INTRODUCED<br />
IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE WHITLAM LABOR GOVERNMENT IN 1975.<br />
UNDER THESE POLICIES WE HAVE WELCOMED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS<br />
OF JAPANESE INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES. 9/, </p>

HIGH LEVELS OF ECONOMIC GRONTH WILL REQUIRE MORE CO-OPERAT, rv-<br />
LESS COMBATIVE P/. TtERNS OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THAN<br />
AUSTRALIA'EXPERIENCED IN THE* YEARS PRECEDING MY GOVERNMENT s<br />
TAKING OFFICE&amp;<br />
YeHILE THE RECESSIO-N HAS f.!, 03 PLAYED A PART IN RE UCiNG<br />
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTA TION, . WE PElJEVr; THAT OUR N EW' CON S 1 ITA TIV/ E<br />
PROCEDURES AND THE PRICES AND I NCOMES ACCORD HAVE MADESUBSTANTIAL<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS TO IMPROV'ED INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
OVER THE PAST TEN MONTHS.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S RECENT INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RECORD IS INDEED'<br />
QUITE REMARKABLE. IN THE TWELVE MONTHS TO OCTOBER LAST<br />
YEAR -THE LATEST PERIOD FOR WHICH DATA ARE AVAILABLE -THE<br />
NUMBER OF WORKING DAYS LOST THROUGH INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES<br />
WAS THE LOWEST FOR FIFTEEN YEARS, AND LESS THAN HALF OF THAT'<br />
FOR THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1982. 114 THE MINING AND MARITIME<br />
INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO JAPANj THE<br />
IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BlEEN EVEN GREATER, WORKING DAYS LOST IN<br />
THE MINING INDUSTRY IN THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1983 DROPPED<br />
BY 64 PER CENT FROM THE LEVEL IN THE PRECEDING YEAR, l </p>

STILL FURTHE~ R, IN A SPEECH TO THE ANNUAL JOINT MEETING<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIA-JAPAN AND'JAPAN' iSTRALIA BUS. INESS<br />
CO-OPERATION COMMITTEES IN MELBOURNE ON 26 OCTOBER LAST YEAR,<br />
I MENTIONED THE GOVERNMENT S CONCERN AT THE LONG-STANDING~<br />
PROBLEMS OF INDUSTRIAL RELA0IONS IN THE PILBARA REGION IN<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA, THE JAPANESE STEEL YNDUSTR3Y DRAWS<br />
A VERY LARGE PART OF. ITS IRON Oma REOUIREMENTS FROM THAT A R EJA<br />
I SAID VHEN THAT THE ESTAflLI $ 1MENT OF AN IRON ORE INDUSTRY<br />
CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL INVOLVING STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTSP<br />
UNIONS AND EM4PLOYERS WOULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION<br />
TC IMPROVED INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE PILBARA.<br />
SINCE THEN.. THERE HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS INVOLVING<br />
ALL RELEVANT UNIONSi COMPANIES AND THE TWO LEVELS OF<br />
GOVERNMENT IN WHICH ALL PARTIES HAVE GIVEN-THEIR SUPPORT<br />
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENTr OF SUCH A CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL. IT<br />
IS EXPECTED FORMALLY TO BE CONSTITUTED IN MARCH THIS YEAR,-<br />
AFTER WHICH IT WILL ASSESS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF<br />
REGULATING INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE REGION.<br />
TO SUSTAIN STRONG GROWTH, AUSTRALIA AS A SOCIETY AND ECONOMY<br />
WILL, UNDER THE LABOR GOVERNMENT, BE MORF CAREFUL THAN IN<br />
THE PAST TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO THEIR MOST FRODUCTIVE USES. </p>

AT THE BEGINNING Ojr-THIS YEAR., WE REPLACED QUOTAS ON STEE-' L<br />
IMPORTS BY BOUNTIES ON CERTAIN TY/ PES OF STEEL PRODUCTION.<br />
THIS OCCURRED WIITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A STEEL INDUSRY PLAN<br />
INCORPORATING STRONG UNION AND B~ USINESS COMMITMENTS TO<br />
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH1 AND HAS STRENGTHENED THIS INDUSTRY<br />
WHILE KEEPING IT MORE OPEN TO INTERNATIONAL. MARKET DISCIPLINES.<br />
MORE GENERALLY, OUR INDUSTRY POLICIES ARE BEING DESIGNED<br />
TO PROMOTE THE EXPANSION OF OUR MOST PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRIES,.<br />
AND STRONG GROWTH IN PRODUCTIVITY IN ALL OUR INDUSTRIES.<br />
WE ARE VERY MUCH AWARE THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS WITH WHICH<br />
WE USE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, BOTH IN NEW AND OLD INDUSTRIES,<br />
