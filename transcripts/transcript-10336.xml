8 May 1997 ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
AUSTRALIA-ASIA SOCIETY<br />
" AUSTRALIA AND ASIA: AN ENDURING ENGAGEMENT"<br />
E O E<br />
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen<br />
It is a great honour to be asked to open the AustralAsia Centre of the Asia Society. I<br />
am grateful for the opportunity to speak tonight on a subject of great importance.<br />
Australia's relations with the nations of Asia.<br />
The AustralAsia Centre<br />
The Asia Society is the pre-eminent American non-government institution promoting<br />
contacts with Asia. For 30 years it has played a leading role in highlighting the extent<br />
of US interests in Asia.<br />
The AustralAsia Centre will help improve dialogue on Asia between the United States<br />
and Australia. Through its link with the Asia Society it underlines both the long<br />
history and the current relevance of Australia's cooperation with the United States in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Like President Clinton's visit to Australia last year it demonstrates the continuing<br />
importance of Australia's partnership with the United States and our common destiny<br />
in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The Centre will draw also on the experience of the Asia Society to strengthen<br />
understanding in Australia of Asia. It will complement the efforts of existing<br />
Australian institutions like the Asia Australia Institute, Asia Link and the regional<br />
studies centres in our universities and Asia 2000 in New Zealand. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
1 congratulate Mr Hugh Morgan and Mr Nick Platt for their initiative and energy in<br />
bringing the AustralAsia Centre into existence.<br />
Mr Morgan recently accompanied me with a group of business leaders on my visit to<br />
China and has a strong interest in Asia. I am pleased that his interest has been widely<br />
supported by the private sector, which has funded the establishment of the Centre.<br />
Under the direction of Mr Richard Woolcott, a distinguished diplomat with many<br />
years' experience in Asia, I have little doubt that the Centre will be a great success.<br />
Australia's future<br />
The AustralAsia Centre is formed at an important time in the history of Australia's<br />
engagement with the countries of Asia.<br />
We are living through a period of economic transformation that has not been equalled<br />
in relative terms since the Industrial Revolution over two centuries ago.<br />
Economic globalisation, technological advance and more open trading arrangements<br />
are transforming patterns of production, employment and opportunity around the<br />
world. It is a transformation from which no modern economy is, or can be, immune.<br />
Australia is equipping itself as a nation to meet the challenges and seize the<br />
opportunities of the 2 1st century.<br />
There can be no argument that a principal task of my government is the continued<br />
pursuit of economic reform. Those who say that the reform process has gone too far<br />
are not only wrong but their nostrums, if accepted, would condemn Australia to a<br />
bleak and fearful future.<br />
The task of modern government is to maintain the momentum for the changes which<br />
are necessary whilst to the extent possible cushioning the personal and social<br />
consequences of that change.<br />
That is why the Coalition's focus in government will continue to be on standing up for<br />
Australia in a world where the competition for investment, growth and jobs is<br />
increasingly fierce.<br />
Our focus will continue to be on improving Australia's capacity to compete<br />
internationally through a comprehensive economic and social policy reform<br />
programme. Our focus will continue to be on increasing our national savings and the<br />
competitiveness of our industries and enterprises.<br />
Our focus will continue to be on helping families and small businesses.<br />
Our focus will continue to be on expanding opportunities for younger Australians and<br />
providing greater security for older Australians. </p>
<p>That is the course my government has charted and on which it will continue to lead.<br />
Australia and Asia<br />
Australia's engagement in her region plays a vital part in my government's strategy.<br />
In discussing that engagement I am going to make no apology for raising first and<br />
foremost economic factors.<br />
If Australians are going to enjoy better living standards and if we are going to create<br />
the jobs we need, economic growth is essential.<br />
Given the size of Australia's domestic market, exports are vital to our growth. In the<br />
past year, our exports grew more than twice as fast as our economy as a whole.<br />
Moreover, surveys of small companies and exporters show that those which export are<br />
more likely to be hiring employees and pay higher wages.<br />
The markets of Asia are growing fast. During the past decade more than half the<br />
world's economic growth has come from East Asia. In the next few years, it will<br />
continue to grow at least twice as fast as the rest of the world.<br />
Already nearly 60 per cent of our exports now go to East Asia. Seven of our top ten<br />
export markets are in East Asia.<br />
It follows that one of the most decisive influences on our standard of living and the<br />
capacity of our economy to provide worthwhile jobs for our children will be our<br />
success in exporting our goods and services to Asian countries.<br />
In the first place that will require us to produce high-quality products that are<br />
internationally competitive and to maintain a reputation as a reliable supplier.<br />
Success will also depend on improving our knowledge of our region, our<br />
understanding of its markets and our capacity to operate in them.<br />
We are indeed fortunate that more and more Australians particularly young<br />
Australians are studying Asian languages and are learning about the history, culture<br />
and economies of our neighbours.<br />
Our ties cannot just be economic. As our economy becomes more integrated with our<br />
neighbours', our stake in their security rises and our mutual understanding must<br />
grow. Moreover, the pursuit of our economic interests in the region cannot be divorced from<br />
acceptance by the countries of our region that we are worthwhile partners.<br />
That means making a commitment a national commitment to developing closer ties<br />
with our region. </p>
<p>It means welcoming visitors and investment from Asian nations.<br />
It means valuing our migrant communities.<br />
It is impossible to imagine a prosperous and successful Australia which is not deeply<br />
engaged with Asia.<br />
Those who propose putting up the shutters could not be more wrong.<br />
Pressures of change<br />
Against this background, let me say a few words about some of the propositions put by<br />
the member for Oxley.<br />
Like any other Australian citizen, she has a right to be heard.<br />
Personal attacks and mindless drowning out of her views only feed sympathy for her.<br />
But she has to be prepared to have her views tested, their accuracy assessed and their<br />
substance analysed.<br />
She cannot have it both ways. She enjoys freedom to express her views. Equally, she<br />
has to be accountable for her views. She cannot evade responsibility for the<br />
consequences of her statements. This is all the more so because she now claims to lead<br />
a political party.<br />
She is wrong when she suggests that Aboriginals are not disadvantaged.<br />
She is wrong when she says that Australia is in danger of being swamped by Asians.<br />
She is wrong to seek scapegoats for society's problems.<br />
She is wrong when she denigrates foreign investment, because its withdrawal would<br />
cost jobs.<br />
She is wrong when she claims that Australia is headed for civil war.<br />
Why has she not distanced herself from supporters who have made irresponsible calls<br />
for the legalisation of the type of weapon that Martin Bryant used to murder<br />
Australians? The political campaign mounted by the member for Oxley seeks to exploit fear and<br />
instability without offering solutions or hope.<br />
As best I can discern them, her policies do not provide a positive response to the<br />
challenge of boosting Jobs and growth, of revitalising our regions, of strengthening<br />
families, of reducing our national debt and of providing greater security in people's<br />
lives. </p>
<p>They have nothing to do with meeting the challenge as our parents and grandparents<br />
before us did of passing on to the next generation of Australians an even better,<br />
stronger and more united Australian society than was handed on to us.<br />
None of these goals will be achieved through empty populism or cheap sloganeering.<br />
None will be achieved through bitter and divisive recriminations. They will only be<br />
achieved through constructive and consistent purpose and through adjusting to new<br />
realities in ways that reflect what is best in Australia's past.<br />
I want to make clear that, under my government, Australia's future will be built on<br />
hope, openness, confidence, and Australian values not a sour, bitter, narrow-minded<br />
view of our past and future.<br />
In responding to the views of the member for Oxley, it would be a serious mistake to<br />
attack those who are apparently attracted to her as bigoted, narrow-minded and racist.<br />
A few, no doubt, are. Most, however, are not.<br />
The fact is that Australia is a deeply tolerant, fair-minded and generous society.<br />
Discrimination on the basis of a person's racial or ethnic origin is offensive to all<br />
decent Australians.<br />
Every Australian, regardless of colour, race or creed, is entitled to walk our streets,<br />
ride our buses and trains, play sport on our fields and pursue their work with<br />
confidence utterly free of discrimination, vilification or insult. Every Australian,<br />
regardless of background, is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity.<br />
All decent Australians agree with that, and find repulsive any violation of that code of<br />
national tolerance.<br />
The appeal the member for Oxley has temporarily achieved lies not so much in the<br />
belief that she articulates alternatives for Australia clearly she does not.<br />
Rather, she echoes concerns about the pace of change and the pressures that parts of<br />
our community are under. These concerns deserve the most sensitive understanding.<br />
The government is committed to giving them a serious and effective response.<br />
She also echoes long-smouldering resentments about attitudes which have been<br />
imposed upon the majority of the Australian community without that majority feeling it<br />
has even had an opportunity of debating those issues.<br />
In part, the 1996 federal election result represented a repudiation of the stultifying<br />
political correctness which had afflicted so many areas of the Australian polity during<br />
the previous decade.<br />
Many Australians resent the negative view of our history and the Australian<br />
achievement which has become so standard in recent years. </p>
<p>Those same Australians resent the constant claim that our history is little more than a<br />
litany of racism, sexism and imperial triumphalism.<br />
Those same Australians resent the plaintive way in which so many encourage us to<br />
approach our association with the nations of the Asia-Pacific region. They resent the<br />
suggestion that Australia has to change its identity in order to play a part in our region.<br />
The truth is that we go to that association as contributors as well as beneficiaries.<br />
I know why some Australians have stopped to listen to the member for Oxley. I say to<br />
them, however, she has no answers to your problems. The Hanson cure would be<br />
worse than the disease.<br />
The government's approach to our region<br />
It is worth reminding both Australians and the people of the region of two striking<br />
features about Australia's engagement with our region.<br />
First, it has been a two-way street. We do not come as a supplicant to the regional<br />
association. We have brought much to it.<br />
Australia has been a dependable friend and an important economic and security partner<br />
to many countries in the region.<br />
One has only to mention the Colombo Plan and APEC to recall the continuity and scale<br />
of Australia's contribution. Australian exports of energy and raw materials helped<br />
make possible Japan's dramatic industrial take-off.<br />
Australia's record for tolerance and acceptance is regarded as an example to the world.<br />
Under Malcolm Fraser's government, Australia accepted more Indochinese refugees<br />
on a per capita basis than any other country in the world.<br />
I would also make the point that Australia's willingness to take in people from all over<br />
the world, including Asia, has been richly repaid by the contribution these immigrants<br />
and refugees have subsequently made to Australia.<br />
The second striking feature of our engagement, as these examples show, is its<br />
longevity and continuity.<br />
The motives for that engagement have changed with the times. Each government has<br />
naturally operated in the context of its own domestic and regional circumstances.<br />
But the importance of engagement with our region has been a consistent theme of<br />
Australian governments since the Second World War, if not before. This has been true<br />
for governments from both sides of politics.<br />
My government is continuing this tradition. It is committed to advancing Australia's<br />
national interests in our region. There will, however, be some important differences<br />
from our predecessors. </p>
<p>My government, for example, will be prepared to listen to what people in the region<br />
are saying to us.<br />
During his recent visit to Australia, the Japanese prime minister, Mr Hashimoto, made<br />
some important proposals to advance Australia's relationship with Japan and to<br />
highlight Australia's role in the region.<br />
This is a healthy and welcome development. We will have the confidence to welcome<br />
and respond to an initiative from a friend like Japan-as well as from others. We do not<br />
think that the only good initiatives have to come from us.<br />
On the issue of human rights, Australia will always stand up for her beliefs and values.<br />
As prime minister I will never do less. But I do not see that public hectoring or<br />
lecturing other countries about their shortcomings or differences from us is appropriate<br />
behaviour for a neighbour or indeed likely to promote our interests or values.<br />
Equally, Australia herself does not expect to be on the receiving end of lectures. We<br />
have the same right to have our values and sensitivities respected. Mutual respect has<br />
to be two-way.<br />
The impression that was sometimes conveyed that, in order to get on with our region,<br />
Australia would denigrate its associations with countries outside the region is one that<br />
I and many Australians found objectionable.<br />
My government has put considerable effort into pursuing Australia's interests in the<br />
region. My own role in this has been to try to establish good working relationships<br />
with my counterparts in some of the countries of most importance to Australia. We<br />
have made good progress in improving the frameworks within which Australia and<br />
the business community in particular might better pursue her goals.<br />
My first bilateral visit was to Indonesia, our largest neighbour, an important and<br />
growing market for Australia, and a partner with which we share many economic and<br />
strategic interests as is reflected in our close cooperation in APEC and our security<br />
agreement. I made clear to President Soeharto my commitment to strengthening our relationship.<br />
His response was very positive.<br />
I have already mentioned the good developments that are taking place in our<br />
relationship with Japan, which I also visited last year. Both Mr Hashimoto and I are<br />
committed to ensuring that our partnership becomes ever more effective in the region.<br />
In Manila last year at the APEC leaders meeting, I reaffirmed Australia's commitment<br />
to the economic goals of APEC.<br />
In China recently, I proposed we form a partnership in growth. Australia has an<br />
important role to play in supplying China with the resources and energy to fuiel its </p>
<p>growth. Australia can play in China a similar role to the one we have played in the<br />
growth of Japan and Korea.<br />
Australia can also provide the financial, legal and other services for which China has a<br />
growing need as its economy modernises and becomes more sophisticated.<br />
The seniority of the business leaders who came with me sent a very strong signal that<br />
the Australian government and business community want to work closely together in<br />
building our economic links with China.<br />
The Chinese premier, Li Peng, and I agreed to have regular summits in order to ensure<br />
that Australia and China have good and direct communications at a political level. I<br />
also proposed that we upgrade and broaden the scope of our ministerial dialogue on<br />
economic issues.<br />
Since my meeting, Australia has welcomed visits from a number of very senior Chinese<br />
leaders. You will be pleased to hear that China's vice premier, Zhu Rongji, will visit<br />
later this month.<br />
My talks with Goh Chok Tong have confirmed the vitality of our links with Singapore.<br />
I hope also this year to be able to visit India and Malaysia, and next year Korea.<br />
My contacts in the region have left me optimistic about Australia's prospects in our<br />
region. Regional prosperity and stability<br />
I am also optimistic about the prospects for the region as a whole.<br />
Asia's economic growth is good for the people of the region, good for Australia and<br />
good for the world. It is true that this same growth is producing major changes in the<br />
strategic outlook of our region. Potential sources of conflict remain over Taiwan and<br />
on the Korean peninsula.<br />
But greater prosperity has for the most part improved the prospects of stability within<br />
countries of the region. It has benefited our security by raising everyone's stake in the<br />
stability of the region.<br />
The question is how does the region ensure that this state of affairs continues.<br />
A part of the answer lies in doing what we can to remove the constraints on continued<br />
growth. This is why Australia's role as a supplier of resources, services, technology<br />
and finance is important. This is why the work of APEC in bringing down barriers to<br />
trade and investment and helping remove bottlenecks in infrastructure, capital flows,<br />
and human resources is important.<br />
A second part of the answer lies in doing what we can to maintain the region's<br />
stability. Stability is necessary if countries of the region are to be able to devote their </p>
<p>energies to meeting the common challenges of education, economic reform and raising<br />
the living standards of their people.<br />
My government has been active in this regard. We are committed to maintaining the<br />
Australian Defence Force's capabilities and improving its effectiveness.<br />
My government has reinvigorated our alliance with the United States. Our alliance,<br />
along with those of Japan and Korea, support the engagement of the United States in<br />
our region and are therefore vital to regional stability.<br />
We are committed to maintaining effective security links with our neighbours through<br />
the Five Power arrangements with Malaysia and Singapore, the security agreement<br />
with Indonesia and other bilateral arrangements.<br />
Australia is also playing a prominent role in the development of sturdier regional<br />
frameworks to promote regional dialogue and understanding on security matters, in<br />
particular the ASEAN Regional Forum.<br />
These activities do not reflect a fear on the government's part of any particular threat.<br />
I especially want to emphasise that it is in no-one's interests to treat China as a threat.<br />
We want to see China fully involved in regional and global institutions. It is also in<br />
China's interests to see these strengthened. China too needs to assure itself of open<br />
markets and a stable international trading system if its economy is to keep growing. It<br />
has an interest in the countries of the region being confident about future stability.<br />
The government believes its policies will contribute to our region's strategic resilience.<br />
They will help provide us and our neighbours with greater confidence that we can<br />
navigate safely a period of great economic, political and strategic change. They will<br />
help ensure that the economic progress of the past 10 or 20 years is not disrupted.<br />
Australia, the region and the world<br />
Attempts to define Asia, Asianness and Australia's place in it are interesting, but they<br />
tend to produce more heat than light in the media. Worse, they have left a degree of<br />
confusion or even resentment among many in our community about issues on which<br />
there need be no confusion.<br />
I do not want to get into definitions tonight. Rather, I would like to finish by<br />
reiterating that our links with our region will be vital to Australia's political and<br />
economic future.<br />
In building those links, Australia does not have to choose between her geography and<br />
her history. Our history and our links with the West make a unique contribution to our<br />
region. The recent advances we have made in our relationships with Japan, China, Indonesia<br />
and the United States demonstrate this. As do visits to Australia in the past six months </p>
<p>by President Clinton, Mr Hashimoto, Chancellor Kohl and shortly the Chinese vice<br />
premier, Zhu Rongji.<br />
Australia can be confident about its place in our region. We bring many strengths to<br />
bear. Australia has economically, politically and strategically an important role to<br />
play. We are a stable democracy. We are located near a major source of the world's<br />
economic growth. The size of our economy, our vast resources, and our technological<br />
capabilities make us a very attractive economic partner. Our high levels of education<br />
and our innovativeness give us the capacity to use our assets effectively.<br />
We enjoy the security inherent in being an island continent and from having an effective<br />
defence force. Our stability, alliances and defence links with our neighbours contribute<br />
to our region's security. Our credibility makes us an effective actor in international<br />
forums. Our cultural and ethnic diversity gives us a great opportunity to consolidate our<br />
personal ties with the countries of our region.<br />
As we go into the next century, my government is committed to using these strengths<br />
to build on a long history of honourable participation by Australia in our region. </p>
