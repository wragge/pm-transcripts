FIGHTING IN THE MIDDLE EAST<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr hitlam, said today that the Australian Government deplored<br />
Lhe resumption of fighting in the Middle East.<br />
Australia hoped that the present hostilities would<br />
be brought to an end at the earliest possible moment and an<br />
effective ceasefire established.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the fighting which was now going<br />
on underlined once again the urgent need for a just and durable<br />
settlement of the Middle East problem.<br />
The Australian Government would continue to support<br />
all efforts to bring such a settlement about. It believed<br />
that Security Council Resolution No. 242 of 1967 provided<br />
a sound equitable basis for a settlement. </p>
