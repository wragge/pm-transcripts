23 NOVEMBER 1996 ADDRESS BY THE PRI M MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MIP<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAIMEW ZEALAND<br />
CHAMER OF COMMERCE F UNCTION<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Nr Kupa, Mr Wallis, Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister of<br />
Australia, Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I'm delighted to be back in the Philippines, I haven't been here for seven or eight<br />
years. I'm particularly delighted to be here at the meeting of the leaders of the APEC<br />
Forum, Mr Wallis spoke about the links between Australia and the nations of the Asia-Pacific<br />
region. I've just come from a meeting with the President of Korea, I've not met him<br />
before. Korea is Australia's second best export market after Japan. In the course of<br />
my exchange with him I reflected upon the fact that within my own electorate of<br />
Bennelong in Sydney there's a suburb called Eastwood that has within it a very<br />
sizeable and vibrant and very successful Korean business community. And that<br />
reflection in the discussion that I had with the Korean President can be mirrored in<br />
bilateral discussions that one has all around the region and it is a remi nder, as<br />
Mr Wallis said, of the for all time association of Australia with the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The genius of the APEC arrangement is that it brings together such a diverse group of<br />
nations that have a number of things in common and what they have in conunon is of<br />
course a fink to the Asia-Pacific region. They also have in common a commitment to<br />
trade liberalisation. Trade liberalisation is easily stated, easily aspired to, not always<br />
easily achieved.<br />
lIn democracies trade liberalisation involves bringing domestic constituencies along<br />
with the decisions taken by government. Trade liberalisation involves the process of<br />
persuading one section of the community that change which may have a short-term<br />
negative impact on that section of the community is needed in the longer term interests<br />
of the nation as a whole. And the process of trade liberalisation must go on and the<br />
goals that can be achieved if the APEC ideal of trade liberalisation in relation to the<br />
developed countries by the year 2010 and the developing countries by the year 2020, if </p>
<p>that ideal can be achieved then this generation of political leaders in the region. this<br />
generation of men and women in business in the region will have made a very great<br />
contribution to the living standards and the prosperity of the nations of the region.<br />
I want especially to thank the Vice-President of the Philippines who was here early this<br />
evening. I want to join Mr Wallis in paying tribute to President Ramos for the<br />
democratic leadership that he has given to this country, the way in which the<br />
institutions and the economy of the Philippines have been strengthened under his<br />
leadership, He is a good friend to Australia, he has close family links in Australia. We<br />
received him as a visitor to our country only last year and I do enjoy very much the<br />
opportunity of being a recipient of his hospitality.<br />
I want to thank the companies that are investing in the Philippines. I want to thank the<br />
personnel associated with those companies for the job they are doing, not only for their<br />
own companies but also the job they are doing in a sense as ambassadors of Australia<br />
to this part of the world.<br />
I'd also like to take the opportunity of thanking people associated with the Australian<br />
mission in Manila, with the activities of AusAID and there are a number of<br />
representatives of the mission, apart from the Ambassador and representatives of<br />
AusAfl) who axe here. Because Australia's association with the Philippines with the<br />
APEC region is a diverse one it is not just a question of facilitating the flows of trade<br />
and investment it is also a question of building the people, the people links. Of<br />
intelligently applying our aid, of encouraging the flows of people.<br />
Earlier this afternoon I saw the Prime Minister of Malaysia and we reflected upon the<br />
fact that something like a 130,000 Malaysians were educated in Australia. It's an<br />
association that's very important in buttressing the bilateral relationships between our<br />
two countries and that particular link is something that we regard in Australia as being<br />
very important. One could go on all evening in talking about the diversity and the<br />
complexity of the relationship that does exist between Australia and the region.<br />
We have just had the opportunity in Australia of hosting a visit from the President of<br />
the United States, IS&amp; Clinton. And both of us in our public comments talked about<br />
the importance of the future together we share in this part of the world and it is a<br />
fuiture to which my government is very strongly committed. It's a fulture which I<br />
believe Australia can make a very positive contribution towards. It is a future which<br />
has as its goal an ideal of peace, an ideal higher of living standards and idea of a free<br />
flow between the peoples of the various nations of the region and also an ideal of<br />
mutual respect of recognising that one of the great strengths of the APEC association<br />
as indeed one of the great strengths of the Australian nation is the cultural diversity<br />
that we have. The fact that there are so many people in Australian who were born in<br />
the region is one of the things that makes it better and easier for us to relate to the<br />
region. So ladies and gentlemen can I say again how delighted I am to be here tonight. I wish<br />
all of you the very best of good corporate fortune. I thank the Chamber and the other<br />
organisations for having me here tonight. </p>
<p>I celebrate the fact that it is very much an Australian week here at the Hotel and the<br />
very pleasant drop of white that I was savouring a moment ago, and to which I &amp; m.<br />
anxious to return is a nice reminder of the distinctive capacities that Australia in the<br />
area of food and wine brings to the region. I mean there is nothing quite like a<br />
reminder of the quality of the food arnd wine that our nation produces.<br />
It's an enormous privilege can I finally say to travel through this region as the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia because I travel as the leader of a nation that has a very rich<br />
history of involvement in the region, a nation that is whole-hearted about its<br />
association with the people and the countries of the region and also a nation which is<br />
very proud of its own traditions, its own distinctive character. And I think the essence<br />
of any mutual association between nations as is the essence of any mutual association<br />
between people is an acceptance of the things that we have in common and also a<br />
recognition that from time to time we may be different and we may disagree on things.<br />
But if good will exi* sts in the long term our association can be a very strong and a very<br />
deep one.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen thank you very much, it's a great pleasure to be here and I wish<br />
you all well. Thank you. </p>
