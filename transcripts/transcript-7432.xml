THE SIR RICHARD KIRBY INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS INAUGURAL LECTURE<br />
KIRBY: THE PRECURSOR OF CONSENSUS<br />
MELBOURNE 16 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
The last five and a half years have seen the most dramatic<br />
change, for the better, in the industrial relations<br />
environment in Australia's peace time history.<br />
This is a large claim, but it is not, to use the jargon with<br />
which you are familiar, an ambit claim. Its validity is<br />
easily established and I will do so.<br />
But I make the point at the outset, not because of<br />
justifiable pride in having had something to do with that<br />
achievement but because the achievement has something to do<br />
with Dick Kirby indeed it has a great deal to do with him.<br />
I can think of no-one from whom I learned more about<br />
industrial relations than Dick Kirby. But industrial<br />
relations is not some easily compartmentalised category of<br />
law and/ or economics, despite the best endeavours of some so<br />
to define it. These definitions have occupied chapters, but<br />
my offering as to what industrial relations is about is<br />
brief. It is about what are the conditions, in the industrial<br />
scene,-for optimising behaviour between individuals and<br />
groups in terms of achieving their legitimate aspirations<br />
against the essential backdrop of the broader national<br />
interests. So it is about law, it is about economics and it<br />
is, profoundly, ab 5iit human nature.-<br />
I don't know whether Sir Richard would claim to have taught<br />
me any law and I doubt that he would claim to have taught me<br />
any economics. But whether he realises it or not he was for<br />
me a tutor, par excellence, in the subtle, mysterious,<br />
complex of emotions and motivations that go to make up the<br />
patterns of human behaviour.<br />
And, for me perhaps most important out of all this, he was<br />
and is an optimist. Despite the almost daily evidence,<br />
with which he was confronted, of our propensity for<br />
stupidity, provocation, pig-headedness and worse, he<br />
remained supremely confident of the capacity of the human<br />
spirit ultimately to triumph in decent and intelligent<br />
outcomes. 3476 </p>
<p>Whenever I listen to the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth<br />
Symphony based on Schiller's " Ode to joy" the most<br />
majestic affirmation of this spirit I think of good men<br />
and women whose lives have been such an affirmation. I<br />
think often then of Dick Kirby.<br />
So it is no mere formality when I say that it is a great<br />
honour to be invited to give the inaugural Sir Richard Kirby<br />
Industrial Relations Lecture on the occasion of Sir<br />
Richard's retirement as Patron of the industrial Relations<br />
Society of Victoria and of the Society's Silver Jubilee.<br />
And it is a pleasure to be given the opportunity of paying<br />
tribute to an eminent Australian who presided over one of<br />
our most important national institutions for 17 years, and<br />
to a man I have known and admired since I first appeared<br />
before the Commission as ACTU advocate in 1959.<br />
Before his appointment to the Arbitration Court Bench in<br />
1947, Kirby had already made his mark in other spheres: he<br />
was appointed to the District Court in 1944; he served on<br />
three Royal Commissions and on the Australian war Crimes<br />
Commission; and especially noteworthy was the role he<br />
performed as Australian representative on the United Nations<br />
Security Council's Committee of Good offices on the<br />
Indonesian Question and the crucial part this played in the<br />
development of our relationship with Indonesia.<br />
But it is on the period of his Presidency of the Australian<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ( 1956-1973) that I<br />
wish mainly to dwell.<br />
That period saw a series of wage decisions of national<br />
importance; a major battle over indexation; and the<br />
evolution of the concept of the total wage. It also saw two<br />
landmark decisions of great long term social significance:<br />
the Aboriginal stockmen case, and the case for equal pay for<br />
women. Everyone knows that not all of those wage decisions were<br />
welcomed by the ACTU. Indeed the 1965 decision was seen as<br />
disastrous and I was totally committed to seeing it<br />
overturned. It is also a matter of public record that the<br />
Full Bench was not always of one view on these matters and<br />
that Kirby on some important occasions notably. 1965. was<br />
in a minority.<br />
Yet the influ'ence of Kirby as President of the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission was profound in a sense beyond<br />
measure not only in influencing, by argument and example,<br />
the attitudes and approach of his colleagues at the time,<br />
but also in developing an approach which others would follow<br />
and build on in the future. 3477 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Kirby had many notable qualities and strengths: his<br />
readiness to listen to new arguments, and the integrity and<br />
courage to change positions previously taken publicly; his<br />
willingness to foster reform ( and his desire to reform<br />
Fosteri); his humanity and keen sense of social justice; his<br />
determination to maintain the Commission's authority and<br />
independence against outside influence or pressure; his<br />
sense of humour; and finally but certainly not least his<br />
great skills as a negotiator and msediator which were evident<br />
throughout his career.<br />
He had a fundamental belief in the value of consultation and<br />
his door was always open for informal talks.<br />
He strove hard to identify areas of common ground between<br />
the parties and to establish the potential for compromise<br />
and co-operation.<br />
He had a full appreciation of a basic truth that the<br />
prospects of a lasting resolution of a dispute are greatly<br />
improved when all parties believe they have gained from, or<br />
have not been unfairly disadvantaged by, the terms of the<br />
settlement.<br />
Looking back over the Kirby years, several decisions are<br />
worthy of special mention in view of their long term impact.<br />
The 1959 Basic wage Case had a special significance for me<br />
as my first case and one in which we had to tackle the<br />
fundamental issue of the ground lost through the 1953<br />
abandonment of automatic quarterly cost of living<br />
adjustments. My approach as advoca * te in this case was not unambitious.<br />
Not to put to fine a point on it, I attacked the 1953<br />
decision as being unsound in its law, perverse in its<br />
economics, sociologically inept and an industrial relations<br />
disaster. That I was heard through to a successful conclusion was<br />
regarded by some as a minor miracle. with appropriate<br />
modesty I can claim some small credit', for a brash talent and<br />
tenacity of purpose. But the greater credit belongs to a<br />
Dick Kirby who was big enough to make allowance for the<br />
exuberance of youth and to harness the niggling of his<br />
brethren on the Bench. He was determined that arguments,<br />
however, in some senses, offensively they may have been put<br />
should be heard and judged on their merits. And he was big<br />
enough to make that judgement in a way which involved a<br />
movement away from his own previously enunciated positions.<br />
That we were substantially successful in 1959 in making up<br />
that ground lost, in amount and in argument, since 1953 was<br />
a matter of considerable pleasure to me as advocate.<br />

I have never since lost that faittho. ndi., ti. that ,. in; any:. way,<br />

due -to Sir Richard Kirby:.. nr c ; i<br />
The' 1959 judgement paved the. way for the more important 1961<br />
Decision;-g<br />
That decision was a major reform. Although it did not<br />
reinstate automatic adjustments,,;. it clearly signalled that<br />
the Commission would i. n futureadjust; the, basicwage for,<br />
price rises unless, it found unusual cir. cumstances: otained,.<br />
While this principle was subsequently abandoned by the<br />
majority 1965 decision, it was indeed soon resurrected and<br />
found its echo in the Commission'. s 1983 Wage Principles.<br />
In 1966, in the Cattle Station. Industry Case, the Commission<br />
reached an historic judgement when it declared, " There must<br />
be one industrial law, similarly applied, to all<br />
Australians, Aboriginal or not". and ruled in favour of equal<br />
pay for Aboriginal stockmen.<br />
Kirby's vision and commitment to a society of equal<br />
opportunity were again evident in April 1967 when the<br />
margins Bench announced, " It seems to us to be industrially<br />
unjust that women performing the same work as men would be<br />
paid a lower margin". That pronouncement, and the<br />
invitation extended by. the national wage bench the next<br />
month to the parties to study the question of equal pay,<br />
together with an offer of the Commission's services to<br />
arbitrate, led directly to the Equal Pay Case later in the<br />
year. Kirby's belief in justice for. the ordinary working man and<br />
woman was demonstrated throughout his career. Equally<br />
evident, I think, was. a sense that the best prospect for<br />
resolving conflict and moving forward lies through a process<br />
of discussion and consultation and determined effort to<br />
identify common goals and: shared interests.<br />
After his retirement from the Commission, Kirby was active<br />
in arguing the case for. more co-operation and dialogue<br />
between management and employees at all levels and for<br />
establishing a joint. body'-to . promote goodwil-in industry.<br />
The general political : climate. during the. years of his<br />
Presidency was not, to. say the . least, always conducive to a<br />
consensus approach. -In : any evnt,-the, re are clear limits to<br />
the role the Commission can perform. But his approach was a<br />
model for those who worked in the industrial arena. 3479 </p>
<p>The deep respect I developed, as advocate, for Sir Richard<br />
was further enhanced during the last three years of his<br />
Presidency of the Commission and the simultaneous first<br />
three years of my Presidency of the Australian Council of<br />
Trade Unions. His commitment to exhaust the processes of<br />
honourable negotiation with myself and the employers without<br />
ever bringing into question the integrity of his office<br />
continuously served this country well. That tradition of<br />
Kirby was continued by his successor, friend and long<br />
serving colleague, John Moore.<br />
My relations with Dick Kirby remained close for the decade<br />
after his retirement from the Commission in 1973. He was<br />
for me a constant source of advice, assistance and, although<br />
some may say it was superfluous, a spur to reasonable<br />
ambition. Ladies and gentlemen, you can see therefore that when I<br />
became Prime minister of our country in 1983 the influence<br />
upon me of Sir Richard had been, indeed, profound. My own<br />
philosophy had been enl arged and strengthened by his wisdom<br />
and by his compassion.<br />
And, therefore., as I speak now of achievements in the last<br />
five and a-half years, it is for that reason, in part the<br />
story of Sir Richard Kirby. I hope, Dick, you will see that<br />
not as a cross to bear but a pride to share.<br />
when the Labor Government came to office in March 1983, we<br />
faced an economic crisis the worst Australia had suffered<br />
since the 1930s. We were confronted with the task,<br />
unprecedented in the post-World War II period, of having to<br />
combat the problems of historically high unemployment<br />
coupled with a high level of inflation.<br />
Among the problems which had helped create this economic<br />
crisis were an over-valued and unresponsive exchange rate;<br />
an antiquated financial system; an over-protected and inward<br />
looking manufacturing sector; a wages system which<br />
perpetuated inflationary pressures; an industrial relations<br />
system locked into expensive and futife confrontation; and<br />
an education system failing to meet the needs of our most<br />
potentially productive workers.<br />
The central challenge in front of'us was to restore the<br />
economy to a state of sustained economic growth. we<br />
believed that an essential precondition for achieving this<br />
was the creation of an atmosphere of constructive<br />
co-operation among the various groups within our community.<br />
Put simply, as I have often said before, it was a matter of<br />
making workers understand that their legitimate aspirations<br />
for improved standards, and employers' equally legitimate<br />
aspirations for growth, were both more likely to be achieved<br />
by such constructive co-operation than by a confrontationist<br />
tunnel-visioned pursuit of their own objectives.<br />
3480 </p>
<p>Too often, in the immediately preceding years, Australians<br />
had been set against Australians. There was a lega-cy of<br />
conflict and division rather than of determination to work<br />
together to achieve common goals.<br />
The progress we have made since then in achieving our<br />
objectives is a matter of record. it can be traced in large<br />
part to the implementation of the Prices and Incomes Accord<br />
with the trade union movement. The processes of<br />
consultation were not limited, however, to the union<br />
movement. We were concerned also to involve industry and<br />
community groups and this was done through the National<br />
Economic Summit and other tripartite mechanisms.<br />
This approach produced sustained economic growth;<br />
outstanding employment growth which so far has produced more<br />
than 1.1 million new jobs; a substantial increase in<br />
competitiveness; a remarkable drop in the level of<br />
industrial disputation; increases in the social wage<br />
especially for low income earners; and improved working<br />
conditions for example, through Government action on<br />
occupational health and safety, affirmative action, equal<br />
employment opportunity and occupational superannuation.<br />
In the difficult economic times of recent years, the Accord<br />
has proved a viable and particularly effective mechanism for<br />
change. Without it, the adjustment process would have been<br />
more traumatic and damaging, with much higher levels of<br />
unemployment and industrial conflict. Instead, adjustment<br />
has been achieved in a socially acceptable way, with<br />
protection for low income groups.<br />
Let me give you one measure of this. During the<br />
Fraser-Howard years, when workplace relations were<br />
characterised by a confrontationist approach fuelled in so<br />
many ways by the words and actions of the Government, there<br />
was an annual average of around 590 working days lost per<br />
thousand employees. Under my Government, this has fallen to<br />
239 a drop of 60 per cent.<br />
Results from recent empirical studies, reported in the<br />
Journal of this Society and elsewhere, offer compelling<br />
confirmation of this turnaround. They find that the<br />
decrease in Australia's strike activity since 1983 is<br />
dramatic, and has been substantially greater than comparable<br />
industrialised countries. The evidence is that<br />
consensus-based incomes policies do deliver more favourable<br />
labour market. outcomes than the alternatives.<br />
But I stress that such evidence is merely the measure of the<br />
improvement in the industrial relations environment. The<br />
meaning of that improvement is far broader.<br />
For many years, Australia was seen by our trading partners<br />
as an unreliable trading partner because of our industrial<br />
disputes record. But our record now compares very<br />
favourably with other OECD nati ' ons. Our reputation as a<br />
reliable supplier is being rebuilt with consequent<br />
improvements in our external accounts. 3481 </p>
<p>In other words, Australians are, through working together,<br />
achieving greater goals than-they could achieve by working<br />
separately. That fundamental truth is the meaning of the<br />
Accord. It is a truth recently acknowledged by the Managing Director<br />
of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Michel Camdessus, and<br />
also by the Secretary-General of the Organisation for<br />
Economic Cooperation and Development, Mr Jean-Claude Paye.<br />
Mr Camdessus, when he was in Australia in may this year,<br />
pointed to the crucial role of the Accord as an additional<br />
dimension of macroeconomic and structural policies aimed at<br />
overcoming severe balance of payments, inflation and<br />
external debt problems. Specifically,-he noted the<br />
impressive results from a policy of dialogue which has<br />
facilitated national cohesion, and allowed wage restraint<br />
and exceptional employment growth at three times that of the<br />
OECD average. At the same time the balance of payments<br />
deficit has been progressively reduced. He concluded that<br />
the world has a good deal to learn from what is now<br />
occurring In Australia.<br />
Mr Paye, the head of the OECD, when he visited Australia in<br />
June, publicly affirmed the Accord wages policy as a<br />
watershed in policy making, involving a consensual approach<br />
to industrial relations which was to be preferred to<br />
polarisation. Mr Paye described it as a very sensible wages<br />
policy that had assisted in the improvement of the<br />
Australian economy and contributed to the restoration of<br />
confidence. He considered that Australia as a result was a<br />
more dynamic, less rigid and less sclerotic economy.<br />
You may recall that, initially,-there were those who doubted<br />
that the Accord-would stand the test of time. There were<br />
others who-professed to see danger in the-cooperative<br />
approach developed between the industrial and political<br />
wings of the labour movement. And there was also a certain<br />
amount of nonsense spoken about the dangers of a corporate<br />
state The critics saw the Accord as an arrangement which would<br />
essentially act to protect vested interests, a conservative<br />
force which would be resistant to change-especially<br />
necessary structural change.<br />
Nothing could have been further from the truth. The last<br />
five and a half years have been a period of the most wide<br />
ranging reform, and the Accord has amply demonstrated its<br />
ability to respond flexibly to a rapidly changing<br />
environment.* I do not need to give a comprehensive run down of the<br />
changes which . have occurred to underline this point : the<br />
floating of the dollar, the deregulation of the financial<br />
system, the cut in tariffs, the new era of industrial<br />
harmony and the sensible cooperation being achieved through<br />
a series of industry plans.<br />
34 g 2 </p>
<p>As far as the labour market was concerned, our first<br />
priority was to put in place an effective wages policy which<br />
generated a responsible overall wages outcome. The<br />
magnificent cooperation which Australian working men and<br />
women, through the union movement, were prepared to give in<br />
exercising sensible restraint, and the acceptance of the<br />
short term need for a decline in real wages, were central to<br />
the economic recovery.<br />
We were, however, also very conscious of other reforms<br />
needed to improve productivity. To tackle outmoded work and<br />
management practices we convened a tripartite conference in<br />
September 1986 which paved the way for the two tier wage<br />
system introduced the following March. That decision by the<br />
Commission provided a vital stimulus for workplace reform,<br />
yielding tangible benefits as well as further enhancing the<br />
degree of underitanding of mutual interests between workers<br />
and management.<br />
These then are the immediate and enduring-fruits of the<br />
Accord and its underlying consensus approach to industrial<br />
relations and economic management.<br />
I gave this lecture the title " Kirby The Precursor of<br />
Consensus" to emphasise my belief that the vision,<br />
intelligence and generosity of spirit that Dick Kirby<br />
displayed during his years of active involvement in<br />
Australian industrial relations laid the foundations for the<br />
broad acceptance by the Australian community, and in<br />
particular by industrialrelations practitioners, of that<br />
consensus approach.<br />
Tonight, I do not in any way suggest that we have exhausted<br />
the benefits of consensus in industrial relations. The<br />
contrary is true. Having spoken so far of the years leading<br />
up to the current climate in industrial relations, and of<br />
the five and a half years during which the Accord has<br />
dominated that environment, I want now to turn to the<br />
future. I assert that we are on the verge of a new era in industrial<br />
relations which will, if the consensus model is maintained,<br />
yield massive benefits to the economy and to the Australian<br />
community. It is perhaps not surprising, given what I have said of<br />
Kirby's lasting influence on the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission, that the last National wage Case<br />
handed down by the Commission should have put award<br />
restructuring at the top of the industrial relations agenda.<br />
For award restructuring is the key to this new era. The<br />
beginnings have been modest but the opportunities in front<br />
of us are very large indeed. 3' 483 </p>

In effect, a much greater degree of labour market peo0 P<br />
flexibility will have been achieved without the costs<br />
inherent in the approach favoured by those who advocate 1Einawholesale<br />

hard won gains of recent years. Australia simply cannot<br />
afford to abandon a system which delivers an economically The I<br />

Support for this crucial reform process will be provided by enhai<br />

<p>Further, if the changing skill requirements of the economy<br />
are to be met, then adequate education, training and<br />
retraining arrangements will be essential. No one was more<br />
aware of this than Dick Kirby an early advocate of<br />
correcting the imbalance in Australia's skilled workforce,<br />
particularly by improved training of apprentices. Much<br />
greater attention is now being given to training and<br />
retraining opportunities at all levels, not just to increase<br />
the volume of training, but also to improve the capacity of<br />
the training system itself to produce sufficient numbers of<br />
people with relevant skills.<br />
Vinally, the Government has overhauled the legislative<br />
framework to ensure major reforms can be achieved.<br />
The Industrial Relations Act 1988 is the outcome of the A<br />
tripartite Hancock Committee of Review which we set -up when<br />
we came to office.<br />
The Act updates the federal ' system's institutions and<br />
streamlines its processes. The Commission over which Dick<br />
Kirby presided now adopts the simpler and more accurate<br />
title of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In<br />
particular the Act encourages union amalgamation and<br />
provides opportunities for flexibility through the provision<br />
of certified agreements.<br />
with over 300 registered trade unions, many of which are<br />
small and craft-based, Australia's trade union structure is<br />
clearly in need of considerable reform. In both Australia<br />
Reconstructed and Future Strategies for the Trade Union<br />
Movement, thec ACTU expressed support for the processes of<br />
A move to larger industry-based unions offers substantial<br />
benefits, including a reduction in the potential for<br />
demarcation disputes, more efficient use of union resources,<br />
and a reduction in the number of unions with which employers<br />
have to negotiate.<br />
The Act's provisions for certified agreements, which have<br />
perhaps attracted less attention, are important because they<br />
inject the potential for greater flexibility into the<br />
present wage setting system.<br />
There will now be considerable scope for developing<br />
arrangements to reflect the particular requirements of an<br />
individual employer or enterprise. Agreements will provide<br />
some certainty to individual employers in relation to the<br />
labour costs which will apply during the set period of an<br />
agreement, and will have considerable potential for<br />
enhancing workplace productivity.<br />
The essential point is that the settlements embodied in<br />
these agreements may provide outcomes which differ somewhat<br />
from those generally prevailing, provided a Full Bench of<br />
the Commission is satisfied that to certify such terms in<br />
the agreement would not be contrary to the public interest. </p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
In advocating this form of integrated approach to labour<br />
market reform, the Government enjoys the support of the<br />
ACTJ, a number of key national employer groups and<br />
individual-omployers, all of whom recognise the link bet-ween<br />
award restructuring, work practices and training.<br />
The ACTU and CAT have produced a Joint Statement on<br />
Participative Practices. Such a statement presents a<br />
framework for the further development of a more cooperative<br />
and constructive approach to industrial relations at the<br />
w'orkplace level. The ACTU and CAI are to be congratulated<br />
for what is in many respects an historic achievement.<br />
Such initiatives to improve the competitiveness of their<br />
industries are reminiscent of, because ultimately they arise<br />
from, processes advocated by Sir Richard Kirby over many<br />
years. His desire to see joint employer/ union bodies may<br />
now be starting gradually to take form.<br />
Throughout, my Government has facilitated the process of<br />
change : change based on mutual respect and cooperation<br />
between the parties. we believe that the potential benefits<br />
of the award reviews are great. Whether they are realised<br />
will depend on the vision and level of commitment brought to<br />
the negotiating process. It is now up to the practitioners<br />
to ensure that the most is made of this historic opportunity<br />
within Australia's industrial relations system.<br />
So let me end tonight with a plea to industrial relations<br />
practitioners. I am sure Sir Richard will support me in<br />
this regard. what I have outlined tonight is not the end of<br />
our labour market reform program, it is a continuing<br />
process, it is a challenging process the very future of<br />
our country will be affected by our success in meeting that<br />
challenge. Our greatest tribute to Sir Richard K( irby will be if we as<br />
practitioners in the fields of indus -trial relations and of<br />
politics show ourselves capable of ri'sing to this challenge.<br />
He would want us, I am sure, as individ~ uals, as groups and<br />
as a society to do what I have recently urged: that is, to<br />
put on our -bi-focals and see the immediate foreground of<br />
contention in the longer term perspective of the national<br />
