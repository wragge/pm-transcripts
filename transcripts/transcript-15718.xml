    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with great sadness that I pass on my condolences to the family and friends of Sir Edmund Hillary.</p>
<p>The thoughts of many Australians are today with this great hero of our times.</p>
<p>The very name, Edmund Hillary, has become synonymous with daring and achievement. He was a man with a big dream and he made that dream come true.</p>
<p>He was one of New Zealand's giants and someone of whom they were so rightly proud.</p>
<p>He devoted much of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan trust, which he founded.</p>
<p>He was also a man that experienced great tragedy in his own life when his wife Louise Mary Rose and his daughter Belinda were killed in a plane crash in 1975.   </p>
<p>Sir Edmund Hillary led an extraordinary and historic life. Today as a nation we honour the contributions that this great man made in the modern world.</p>
