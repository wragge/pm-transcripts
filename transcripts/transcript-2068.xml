FOR PRESS P. M. No. 48;, 1969<br />
NUCLEAR POWER<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The Federal Government has invited New South Wales to<br />
collaborate in a study of the feasibility of the establishment of a Commonwealth-<br />
owned and controlled 500 megawatt nuclear power station. It is<br />
also inviting all State Governments to work with the Commonwealth on a<br />
National Consultative Committee on Nuclear Energy.<br />
Announcing this today, the Prime Minister ( Mr Gorton)<br />
said that the Commonwealth would prefer the station, which would be a<br />
pilot project for Australia, to be sited in the Australian Capital Territory<br />
or the Commonwealth Territory at Jervis Bay, although this would be<br />
subject to technical considerations. Mr Gorton emphasised that at this<br />
stage the Commonwealth is only prcposing a feasibility study and had not<br />
yet made a decision to build a reactor.<br />
If the project were to go ahead, all States would be invited<br />
to send teams of officers to gain experience in pre-construction procedures,<br />
construction, and commissioning of the station. Power surplus to the<br />
needs of the Commonwealth Territories would be sold to New South Wales<br />
on agreed terms. Mr Gorton said that the proposal for a National<br />
Consultative Committee on Nuclear Energy followed recent discussions<br />
between the Minister for National Development ( Mr Fairbairn) and State<br />
Ministers responsible for power and that it would consider such matters<br />
as The use of indigenous fuel in Australian reactors<br />
* Licensing reactors<br />
* International obligations on safeguards on nuclear<br />
materials<br />
* Disposal of radio-active waste<br />
* Liability for injury to civilians in nuclear accidents<br />
" The Government has taken the initiative to establish such a joint<br />
Commonwealth, State consultative organisation because we feel that this<br />
is the time to lay the foundations for a sound administrative and legal<br />
framework for the introduction of nuclear energy in the power generation<br />
field, Mr Gorton said. " Other countries have found that the building of<br />
such a framework takes years and a late start can hamper the establishment<br />
of a nuclear industry.<br />
