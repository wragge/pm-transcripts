FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 20/ 1969<br />
VISIT TO CANADA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I have been delighted to accept an invitation from<br />
Mr. Trudeau to make a visit to Canada on Thursday, 3 April,<br />
after my meeting with President Nixon in Washington.<br />
I am looking forward to this opportunity for an<br />
exchange of views with another Commonwealth country which<br />
has an increasing interest in the Pacific region.<br />
CANBERRA 19 February 1969<br />
Background Note: The Prime Minister begins his Washington talks<br />
on Monday, 31 March, and will probably travel to Ottawa on<br />
Wednesday, 2 April. No itinerary beyond 3 April is yet available for<br />
Mr. Gorton. </p>
