FOR MEDIA 23 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANTARCTIC POLICY<br />
In August last year, together with the Prime Minister of<br />
France, I lau~ nched an initiative within the Antarctic Treaty<br />
System to promote the protection of the Antarctic<br />
environment. We proposed that Australia and France work<br />
together to ban mining and to achieve a Comprehensive<br />
Environment Protection Convention which would preserve<br />
forever Antarctica as a nature reserve and a land of<br />
science. The thirty-eight nations of the Antarctic Treaty System are<br />
currently neg~ otiating in Vina del Mar, Chile, on the future<br />
of Antarctica at a Special Consultative Meeting of Antarctic<br />
Treaty PartiE's. We cannot expect that all our objectives<br />
will be met at this one meeting. But the mere fact that<br />
Treaty Parties have embraced the need for a meeting devoted<br />
to environmen~ tal matters is a mark of progress.<br />
The decision my Government took in May last year not to sign<br />
the Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral<br />
Resources Activities was a bold one. Not only was it made<br />
in the face of almost total opposition from other nations of<br />
the Antarctic Treaty System, it also presented us with a<br />
challenge to develop an acceptable alternative for the longterm<br />
environmental management of the Antarctic region.<br />
We made this difficult decision because, at the end of the<br />
day, we identified a fundamental flaw in the Minerals<br />
Convention the fallacy that ' safe mining' was an option in<br />
the Antarctic.<br />
In fact, the Minerals Convention provided an incentive to<br />
mine, and to that we responded with a resounding the<br />
risks to the Antarctic environment are too great and too<br />
unpredictable. In short, the Minerals Convention was based<br />
on an illusion the illusion of human infallibility in a<br />
region which hosts the most delicate and fragile ecosystems<br />
in the world. </p>
<p>In place of this illusion, our aim is to make a reality of<br />
plans for an internationally binding agreement to protect<br />
the fragile continent against the threat of mining forever.<br />
And it is already becoming clear that we have greater reason<br />
for confidence than ever before that our efforts will<br />
succeed. Those who continue to hold to the hope that some form of<br />
exploitative minerals regime will be established are now a<br />
fast dwindlin~ g minority.<br />
The concept that mining will be prohibited, at least for the<br />
foreseeable future, now has common currency amongst Treaty<br />
Antarctic Par-ties. Support for a permanent ban is growing.<br />
But this is oinly half of our achievement so far. Together<br />
with the idea. of a mining ban, Australia recognised that a<br />
comprehensive regime for environmental protection was also<br />
needed. When Australian and French negotiators put this<br />
proposal to Antarctic Treaty Parties in October last year,<br />
it was met with steely opposition. Now, as Antarctic Treaty<br />
Parties meet again, the need for a new international<br />
agreement to deal with Antarctica's environment has near<br />
universal acceptance.<br />
Not only do we have agreement to the Australia-France<br />
proposal from Belgium and Italy, others such as Sweden,<br />
India, Poland., Finland, Denmark, the EC, Greece, Romania<br />
and New Zealand have adopted positions very close to our<br />
own. Indeed, even among those countries which we expected<br />
would provide the staunchest opposition to our position such<br />
as the United. States and the Soviet Union, there is now<br />
ready agreement with many of our views.<br />
The United States administration has declared its support<br />
for a new environmental instrument, and legislation<br />
prohibiting mining in Antarctica by U. S. citizens has now<br />
passed through Congress, and become law in the United<br />
States. In the Soviet Union, President Gorbachev has given<br />
support to the protection of the Antarctic as a wilderness<br />
preserve. This support reflects the impact that our ideas are having<br />
in other countries, and the level of support which the<br />
preservation of Antarctica has within these other<br />
communities. The world wide environment movement not<br />
least the WWF has played a large part in this success, and<br />
I pay tribute here to their substantial role.<br />
That does not mean, however, that securing agreements which<br />
fully satisfy our aspirations will be easily or readily<br />
achieved. As I said at the outset, when Prime Minister Rocard and I<br />
launched our joint initiative we did so in the full<br />
realisation that we had a considerable task ahead. </p>
<p>The speed with which we have been able to achieve this<br />
significant turn-round of world opinion is a testimony not<br />
only to the priority which we have accorded our goal, but<br />
the absolute correctness of our views, and the growing<br />
international sympathy for an environmentally sound future.<br />
Nevertheless, in spite of the inherent good sense of our<br />
proposals, some continue to have misconceptions about<br />
elements of our position. Some have asserted that our<br />
initiative may undermine the special role science has in the<br />
Antarctic region.<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
The Antarctic: is a global scientific laboratory. Its near<br />
pristine condition provides a baseline against which we can<br />
measure environmental effects on other continents, including<br />
our own.<br />
Our proposal to make Antarctica a ' nature reserve land of<br />
science' encapsulates the symbiotic relationship between<br />
science and environmental protection that we envisage for<br />
the continent. The draft convention that we and France have<br />
proposed places science in a pre-eminent position over all<br />
other activities in Antarctica.<br />
Because of Antarctica's vulnerability, its importance to<br />
science in a pristine condition, and its wilderness<br />
qualities, few now question the need for careful<br />
environmental management. The challenge that we face today<br />
is to develop, within the existing Treaty System, a new and<br />
comprehensive regime to manage human activity in the region.<br />
Some have mistakenly painted this ambition to find a new<br />
approach as a challenge to the Treaty System itself. Let me<br />
re-affirm that our intention and our expectation for the<br />
initiative are that it will strengthen and enhance the<br />
Treaty System.<br />
The record of the Treaty is a proud one.<br />
Since the time when the continent challenged men like<br />
Amunsden, Scott, Shackleton and our own Sir Douglas Mawson<br />
to discover its secrets, Antarctica demanded an unrivalled<br />
level of international cooperation. This has become the<br />
hallmark of the continent, and the special international<br />
regime which has evolved to manage activity there.<br />
Emerging as it did in an era of cold-war hostilities, and<br />
covering a wide spectrum of interests including developed<br />
and developing countries, aligned and non-aligned, North and<br />
South alike, the Treaty System has provided a firm<br />
foundation for the coordination of scientific and other<br />
activities on the continent, and the framework for stability<br />
and peace in the region. With its assurances of peaceful<br />
activity in the Antarctic and freedom of scientific<br />
research, the: Treaty is an agreement in which Australia has<br />
much at stake. </p>
<p>It is with this in mind that I wish to make absolutely clear<br />
that the maintenance of the Treaty System is an essential<br />
element in the proposal that Australia and France are<br />
pursuing. But we must niot lose sight of the fact that the Antarctic<br />
Treaty was developed in an era vastly different from our<br />
own. Many of the environmental problems that we now face<br />
were simply unheard of in the 1950s. The Treaty itself<br />
makes no reference to environmental protection or to the<br />
challenges that mineral resource exploitation of the region<br />
would bring. Our aim, therefore, is to improve the Treaty<br />
System by add~ ing comprehensive environmental protection to<br />
its already impressive list of achievements.<br />
There are encouraging signs of a growing understanding of<br />
the need to protect Antarctica.<br />
What we aim t~ o achieve at this first meeting in Chile is<br />
agreement to a process of negotiation, a process which will<br />
lead to agreement on rules which will protect Antarctica<br />
forever, an agreement in solemn, legal form governing all<br />
activity in Antarctica by all nations and all their<br />
citizens. We do not pretend that this process will be uncomplicated.<br />
We will naturally need to take into consideration the views<br />
of others. But I want to make absolutely clear at the<br />
outset that cur basic aims for the protection of this<br />
special environment will not be compromised.<br />
These aims embrace the following fundamental pillars:<br />
First, no package for protection of Antarctica's environment<br />
would be acceptable which does not include a prohibition on<br />
mining a prohibition which is effective, which is<br />
comprehensive, and which ensures that mining will never<br />
occur. The logical corollary of this requirement is that<br />
the Minerals Convention cannot be part of the outcome. it<br />
is simply illogical and unrealistic to try to outlaw mining<br />
in a mining treaty.<br />
Second, any new arrangements for the protection of the<br />
Antarctic must be comprehensive. The uniqueness of<br />
Antarctica and its importance to the global environment make<br />
fragmented and informal approaches to environmental<br />
management inadequate. Any agreement must ensure the<br />
protection of the environment against the whole range of<br />
activities which may threaten it. A piecemeal approach,<br />
taking in only selected threats to the environment is not<br />
enough. Nor can we accept any approach which would provide<br />
a nebulous framework, but leave the essential measures for<br />
environmental protection for later agreement. Any agreement<br />
must provide protection immediately on its entry into force,<br />
and across the gamut of foreseeable activity. </p>
<p>The protection we seek must be rgorous. We must be certain<br />
that it will allow no activity which would in any way<br />
jeopardise the fragile ecosystems of the continent. The<br />
standards adopted must afford Antarctica the highest levels<br />
of protection.<br />
Finally, for these measures to take effect, we need<br />
oraanisational arrangements that will work effectively and<br />
efficiently. Measures must be legally binding, they must<br />
enshrine the principle of prior impact assessment, and there<br />
must be a capacity to modify and, if necessary, halt harmful<br />
activity. Where an accident occurs, there must be provision<br />
for emergency response and effective remedial action, and<br />
liability for damage to the environment. A permanent<br />
institution, or some means by which ongoing monitoring of<br />
Antarctic activity is ensured, is also a necessity.<br />
By taking these steps, the Treaty System will demonstrate<br />
its ability t~ o adapt to the challenges that environmental<br />
problems bring, and will promote its credibility in the<br />
effective management of activity in Antarctica. If and only<br />
if it can meet the challenges that environmental awareness<br />
brings with it, the Treaty System will demonstrate its<br />
continued relevance and ensure its survival into the twentyfirst<br />
century.<br />
A great strength of the Treaty System is its consensus<br />
approach to issues. Australia does not seek to change this.<br />
At the same time all of us should be concerned if calls for<br />
consensus are used as a smokescreen to avoid an open-minded<br />
examination of issues and to disguise an unwillingness to<br />
take account of major changes in community and international<br />
concern. We trust that, with goodwill on all sides, the next steps<br />
toward our goal will be achieved without drawn-out argument,<br />
and that the Chile meeting will be a success. I want to<br />
make clear, however, that we will not be prepared to<br />
sacrifice principle for the sake of a short term solution.<br />
We are not afraid of finding ourselves again in the<br />
minority, if others fail to see the need for progress.<br />
Central to this effort to pursue the Australia/ France<br />
initiative over the coming months is the need to generate<br />
informed debate about our proposal and to promote a wider<br />
understanding of the importance of the Antarctic region and<br />
its preservation.<br />
It is with these objectives in mind that I wish to outline<br />
today details of the establishment of a new Antarctic<br />
Foundation to be based in Hobart. I announced the proposal<br />
in February, and $ 1 million was allocated in this year's<br />
budget for this purpose.<br />
It has long been recognised that Hobart is a world-renowned<br />
centre of Antarctic expertise. The Foundation will enhance<br />
this role, and complement the activities pursued there by<br />
the Antarctic: Division, the Secretariat of the Convention </p>
<p>6.<br />
for the Conseirvation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources,<br />
the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies at the<br />
University of Tasmania, and the Fisheries and Oceanography<br />
Division of the CSIRO.<br />
The Foundation will underline Australia's deep commitment to<br />
Antarctica, a~ nd will promote the importance of the Antarctic<br />
environment. It will underscore the special relationship we<br />
have with Antarctica, forged by the ties of history and<br />
proximity, and cement the already strong affinity that<br />
Australians feel for the continent. It will ensure that<br />
Australia's interests in the continent receive specific<br />
funding and conspicuous attention. Further, it will<br />
demonstrate t~ o the world our commitment to fulfil our<br />
special responsibility for the Antarctic region and its<br />
ongoing protection. Consistent with these aims, the<br />
Government has in mind that among the first tasks of the<br />
Foundation would be the development in consultation with<br />
the Antarctic Division of the Department of Arts, Sport,<br />
Environment, Tourism and Territories of a Conservation<br />
Strategy for the Australian Antarctic Territory.<br />
I am very pleased to announce that the Foundation will be<br />
chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen. He will bring to the<br />
organisation his considerable energy, intellect and<br />
environmental conviction. This role will complement his<br />
invaluable efforts as Ambassador for the Environment. And<br />
he will be assisted in it by a Board of the new Foundation<br />
which will reflect the involvement in Antarctica of both the<br />
Federal and Tasmanian Governments, as well as the broad<br />
community interest in the continent.<br />
Antarctica has long fascinated and excited. Not only is it<br />
the world's last great wilderness and a unique sanctuary for<br />
millions of seals, whales, penguins and sea-birds, its<br />
awesome size and dramatic beauty are unparalleled.<br />
Antarctica is a land of extremes and one of the most<br />
inhospitable -places on the earth. The world's coldest,<br />
driest and windiest continent and yet its most vulnerable.<br />
As we renew our efforts to protect Antarctica, I am fully<br />
aware of the debt the community owes to our new pioneers<br />
pioneers not of new lands but of new ideas. The World Wide<br />
Fund for Nature has been at the forefront of the new<br />
environmental consciousness which is the hallmark of this<br />
decade. To you, as environmentalists, I extend my<br />
congratulations and my best wishes for your continuing<br />
endeavours. </p>
