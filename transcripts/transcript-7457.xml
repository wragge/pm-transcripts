NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE 19 JANUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, is there any chance of a<br />
national housing summit as proposed by the Australian<br />
Democrats? PM: No, I don't think there's any purpose in holding such a<br />
summit. JOURNALIST: You don't think there's a housing crisis?<br />
PM: Well for those people who are having difficulty in<br />
acquiring houses, for each person there is a personal<br />
crisis, a desire to obtain housing. But this Government<br />
since we've been in office has tackled the problem of<br />
housing in a comprehensive way. We've brought in the First<br />
Home Owner Scheme which is recognised by the industry and by<br />
the recipients as the most imaginative scheme that's been<br />
ever brought in by any federal government to provide the<br />
opportunity for people to acquire their own homes. we've<br />
provided record sums of money, record real increases in<br />
funds for public housing and we will continue to do what we<br />
can to assist the acquisition of homes by the people of<br />
Australia. We've also taken the initiative as you know in<br />
approaching by letter directly from myself to all the State<br />
Premiers to take imaginative action in the area of making<br />
more land available, more public land available for housing.<br />
And in that area we are ourselves examining the capacity<br />
that the Commonwealth has to make more land available. so<br />
in these ways we have been over the last six years directing<br />
our attention to this issue and we'll continue to do so. At<br />
the moment of course there is a relatively tight monetary<br />
policy which is necessary to deal with the overall economic<br />
situation confronting this country. What you've got to<br />
understand is that the problem that this Government has to<br />
deal with is the problem of an economy which is, if<br />
anything, operating at too strong, too high a level of<br />
activity. I have noticed some observations which suggest<br />
that we are relying solely upon monetary policy. Well like<br />
so many observations that are made in certain areas of the<br />
media, that is a nonsense. Monetary policy in a sense is<br />
the swing instrument of policy. We have in place very very<br />
firm fiscal policy which is evidenced by the fact that we<br />
have budgeted for and will obtain a surplus of at least five<br />
and a half billion dollars in 1988/ 89 and there will be zero<br />
public sector borrowing requirement. So there is very firm<br />
fiscal policy in place, it will continue, and we have a firm </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM ( cont): wages policy in place. But the problem of<br />
course at the moment is that at the high level of activity<br />
that is taking place you have imports coming in at quite a<br />
high level which is adding to the problem of our external<br />
accounts. But I'd make the observation in regard to that<br />
area of Australia's affairs that capital imports are running<br />
in the last 12 months at about double the rate of other<br />
imports, which is a reflection of the high level of<br />
investment that is taking place in this country. In fact,<br />
in 1988/ 89, as I think the Treasury release yesterday<br />
indicated, we will have the highest ratio of investment to<br />
GDP in 35 years in this country. At the same time as that<br />
is taking place in creating a stronger economic base for the<br />
future we have a quite strong performance in the export side<br />
in both services and manufactures. In regard to services,<br />
if you look at the figures over the last two years, we've<br />
had, in the last two years in regard to services, increases<br />
of 9.4 and 13.9%, and in the export of manufactures in the<br />
last two years of 32.5% and of So if you look at the<br />
structure of the problem with which we're dealing, while it<br />
is true that there can be no complacency about the external<br />
situation there are elements of it which should give us<br />
confidence for the longer term both on the imports and the<br />
exports side. On the import side, as I repeat, capital<br />
goods imports running at double the level of consumer<br />
imports over the last 12 months which will be creating a<br />
stronger economic base for the future. We are seeing a<br />
significant performance on the export front. I've referred<br />
to the significant increases in the exports of services and<br />
of manufactures. We shouldn't overlook the fact that in the<br />
12 months from July to December as well, there's been a<br />
increase in the volume of rural exports. Part of the<br />
problem we've had in the first six months of this financial<br />
year of course is that we've had fairly low levels of stocks<br />
as far as primary products are concerned, but now it looks<br />
as though we're starting to see the end of that problem.<br />
We're hopeful that in the second part of the financial year<br />
we will continue to get a strong export performance. So I<br />
give all that background to make the point that where you<br />
talk about the relatively high level of interest rates that<br />
is a necessary part of the proper conduct of economic<br />
management for Australia but it is not a situation where the<br />
Government is in any sense relying solely on monetary<br />
policy. It is necessarily tight but it is a part of an<br />
overall strategy of economic management which, as I say,<br />
sees as well very strong and tight fiscal policy management,<br />
and also in the area of wages.<br />
JOURNALIST: If as you say the economy is, if anything, too<br />
strong, do you agree with Senator Button's comments of<br />
yesterday that if demand remains to buoyant interest rates<br />
will have to be even higher?<br />
PM: He said, as I saw of the paper, that you might have to<br />
look at that but I don't see any need for that at this<br />
point because, as I say, it's not a case of the Government<br />
relying solely on monetary policy. If you were in a<br />
situation where that's all we had to rely on then you may </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM ( cont): see more immediacy about some need for tighter<br />
monetary policy. But you've got to understand, as I repeat,<br />
that monetary policy is associated with very tight fiscal<br />
policy, the achievement of a significant surplus, the first<br />
time this has been done for a very very long period of time<br />
and also in the context of a responsible and tight wages<br />
policy. I think the most interesting thing of course at the<br />
moment in this area are the observations that are being made<br />
by the Opposition. I'd certainly recommend to the people of<br />
Western Australia that they should take account, as they go<br />
up to an election on 4 February, of what the Opposition in<br />
this country is saying about what should be done. You have<br />
the remarkable combination of Professor Hewson who says to<br />
go ahead with tax cuts would be madness. Certainly he says<br />
in the absence of strong expenditure cuts. So the people of<br />
Western Australia ought to know that the spokesman for the<br />
Liberal Party is saying that tax cuts ought to be out the<br />
window, at least in the absence of very very strong<br />
expenditure cuts so they ought to be asking the<br />
spokespersons for the Liberal Party where are the<br />
expenditure cuts going to be made, where abouts in health,<br />
housing, education and so on are the Libs going to be<br />
advocating the sort of expenditure cuts as a condition of<br />
tax cuts. And from the National Party we have the<br />
multi-millionaire McGauran coming up with the magnificent<br />
proposition now that what we should have is tax cuts on<br />
interest earned from household savings. Well isn't that a<br />
lovely proposition from the multi-millionaire McGarran and<br />
his rich mates. The most regressive proposition you could<br />
imagine tax cuts for them on interest from household<br />
savings. Well for the ordinary person in Australia today<br />
that's not offering much but it's certainly offering an<br />
enormous handout, as I say, to the multi-millionaires, the<br />
National Party and their mates. That's the alternative<br />
economic policy that you've got from the Opposition in this<br />
country. It's the sort of thing that ought to be taken into<br />
account and I'm sure will be taken into account by the<br />
electors in Western Australia on 4 February.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was Mr Kerin right this morning when he said<br />
that the current account deficit would come in at around 12<br />
billion dollars?<br />
PM: Neither John Kerin nor I can be precise, obviously, as<br />
to where the current account deficit will come in. All we<br />
can say is that of course the figure that we talked about at<br />
budget time of nine and a half billion will be exceeded.<br />
There's no doubt about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given that Mr Hawke, can we still afford tax<br />
cuts on 1 July?<br />
PM: Yes we can afford tax cuts and they will be delivered.<br />
They will be delivered by this Government because the<br />
capacitor has the capacity to deliver them, because it is in<br />
possession of, and it is the sole political party in this<br />
country in possession of the range of economic policies<br />
which can make responsible tax cuts possible. We can do </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM ( cont): that because as distinct from the wordsmiths of<br />
the conservatives who talk about responsible fiscal policy<br />
and so on, we've delivered. They simply had a continuing<br />
deficit in their handling of the public accounts. We have<br />
by successive, responsible and relevant expenditure cuts<br />
created a situation now of significant surplus. So we've<br />
budgeted for a surplus of five and a half billion that<br />
will be achieved. And because we've done that and because<br />
the Labor Party alone in this country can conduct a<br />
responsible and relevant wages policy, we therefore have the<br />
instruments, the range of instruments in the conduct of<br />
economic management within which we can deliver responsible<br />
tax cuts. Let me again make the contrast between Labor and<br />
what it will do and what's being offered now by the<br />
Opposition. The Opposition, the only way they talk about<br />
tax cuts is to say tax cuts generally out but tax cuts for<br />
the rich in terms of tax cuts on interest. Well that's all<br />
right for the conservatives who want to look after the rich.<br />
We will bring in tax cuts on 1 July and they will be<br />
targeted at the lower and middle income Australians who need<br />
and deserve the tax cuts and we'll be able to deliver them<br />
responsibly because they will be delivered within the<br />
framework, as I say, of an overall economic policy directed<br />
towards the interests of this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you rule out any further spending<br />
cuts if the current account deficits remain high?<br />
PM: What we have said, I've said it, Paul Keating has said<br />
it, is that the action of this Government over six years now<br />
where we have successively in Budgets and May statements cut<br />
back in the expenditure areas, brought a situation where<br />
there is not much room left now for significant cuts. Any<br />
major cuts in expenditures would cut into to the services<br />
provided for ordinary Australians. Now that's neither<br />
economically or socially responsible. There may be some<br />
room for some further savings, minor savings, but not of the<br />
sort of order that we've been talking about in the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: May Mini Budget, nothing as big as the May<br />
Mini Budget, but perhaps some cuts announced before the<br />
Budget? PM: Well we have not believed to this point that you need<br />
to have a May statement sort of approach which has, in the<br />
past, involved significant cuts on the expenditure side.<br />
It's quite clear that we are going to have to be announcing,<br />
at about that time, what we'll be doing in the area of tax<br />
cuts. We'll be announcing them at around that period, we'll<br />
be having discussions now with the trade unions, with the<br />
business community which will deal with the issue of wages<br />
and at all times we've made it clear. There has never been<br />
any question about this. We've made it clear that the<br />
question of tax cuts will involve a wage tax trade off and<br />
so we will be watching what happens to wages. We're fairly<br />
confident that there will be responsible attitudes adopted<br />
in the area of wages and if that happens then we will be<br />
announcing, as I say, about that time the tax cuts which </p>
<p>PM ( cont): will come into effect from 1 July. Now at this<br />
stage, as I've said, neither Paul nor I have thought that it<br />
would be necessary to put that within an overall package of<br />
significant expenditure cuts. But what the conduct of<br />
economic policy by this Government has shown over the six<br />
years now nearly that we've been in office, that we continue<br />
constantly to monitor the economic situation and we will<br />
continue to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: On wages policy Mr Hawke, do you share Mr<br />
Morris' concern which he expressed yesterday about the<br />
possibility of a wages breakout because of the spate of<br />
increases in executive salaries?<br />
PM: You've got to be concerned about this. In the private<br />
sector, there is no doubt that there has been a fair bit of<br />
evidence of significant increases in executive salaries.<br />
And this is a matter which has been raised strongly on the<br />
Economic Planning Advisory Council, both by the ACTU and by<br />
the Government and, to be fair to the representatives of the<br />
business community there, they acknowledge the problem that<br />
does exist. They would argue, they do argue, that generally<br />
speaking the increases that have taken place have been, as<br />
they would put it, competitively necessary but they do<br />
acknowledge that where the trade union movement sees fairly<br />
significant increases in executive salaries in the private<br />
sector, that that does create some pressure. But<br />
nevertheless, having said that, if you look at the record of<br />
the period we've been in Government and look at the attitude<br />
of the ACTU, it is beyond arguing that the trade union<br />
movement of this country has been responsible. How<br />
otherwise could you have a situation in which there has been<br />
the cut in real wages that's taken place. It's only because<br />
of the restraint that the trade unions have exercised that<br />
we've been able to create over one and a quarter million new<br />
jobs and have a rate of job creation which is more than<br />
twice as good as the rest of the world. So that is an area<br />
of trade off in the past, there has been a trade off of wage<br />
increases against higher employment growth and I'm sure the<br />
trade union movement will continue to see the validity of<br />
that approach. Having said that, I repeat what I had put<br />
last year and I take this first opportunity in 1989 to<br />
repeat it. During 1988/ 89, the financial year 1988/ 89,<br />
there will be wage increases associated with the principles<br />
that have been laid down by the Commission which will mean<br />
that in combination with the reduction in the inflation rate<br />
which will characterise 1988/ 89, that there will be a<br />
maintenance of living standards for Australian workers and<br />
their dependents. Then it means that when you take into<br />
account the continuing fall in the rate of inflation that<br />
will go on into 1989/ 90 and the wage increases that will<br />
take place and the tax cuts that will take place, targetted<br />
most particularly at lower and middle income groups that you<br />
will see, as a result of the policies of this Government, an<br />
improvement in the living standards of the Australian<br />
people. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the timing for any cut in the top<br />
rate? PM: Well, that's a matter to be decided. What we've made<br />
clear is that our overwhelming priority will be the lower<br />
and the middle income groups. I've stated that, Paul<br />
Keating has stated that and that remains the position of the<br />
Government and that will be unchanged. The question I<br />
believe that we will have to consider will be this, as to<br />
whether there will be any cut for the top rate at the time<br />
of those other cuts which will operate from 1 July or an<br />
indication of later cuts. So there is need for cuts in the<br />
top rates at an appropriate time and the appropriate time is<br />
something that we will decide during the early months of<br />
this year as we address this whole question of tax cuts.<br />
But I repeat our primary emphasis will be for the lower and<br />
middle income earners of this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you personally seen any of the US<br />
Government's intelligence about the breached chemical<br />
weapons factory<br />
PM: No I haven't had the opportunity of seeing that<br />
material myself yet. I will be seeing the material that's<br />
been made available to Mr Duffy in his capacity as acting<br />
Foreign Minister, but I have total confidence in the<br />
assessment that's been made by Mr Duffy on this issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are visiting four countries in Asia in the<br />
next few weeks.<br />
PM: Yes<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be raising the chemical weapons issue<br />
with any of those countries, or in one of those countries<br />
specifically there is an allegation that one of those<br />
countries is manufacturing chemical weapons<br />
PM: Yes, I'll be raising it in all the countries that I<br />
visit because following the initiative that I announced in<br />
New York in the middle of last year, our diplomatic<br />
representatives in the region have raised with all<br />
Governments our concern on this matter. Let me make it<br />
clear that what we wanted to do is to raise the<br />
consciousness of Governments in this region generally of the<br />
need to pursue an effective policy calculated to bring an<br />
end to the manufacture and the possible use of chemical<br />
weapons so that's been done already in all these areas by my<br />
diplomatic representatives following the initiative that I<br />
announced in New York last year. I will take the<br />
opportunity personally of pursuing that initiative. Let me<br />
make the final point on that, that at all points from when I<br />
raised that, this was not seen as a substitute for work that<br />
needs to be done on the general international basis and<br />
Australia will continue to play a leading role in the moves<br />
that thankfully seem to be gathering momentum<br />
internationally to move to a new convention in this area. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe the wages forecast in the Budget<br />
will be met?<br />
PM: Substantially I think it's possible that it might be<br />
slightly over the Budget forecast, but the important point: I<br />
believe is that the trade unions are seized of the<br />
importance of a continuing restraint in this area. But<br />
consistent with the sort of scenario that I have put and<br />
that is in this financial year a maintenance of real<br />
standards and a move then as we move through ' 89 to an<br />
improvement in standards. Now we have always said that<br />
there would be wage increases associated with the whole<br />
restructuring process. That is going to be something that<br />
we're seeing really in Australia substantially for the first<br />
time that the whole concept of wage increases are going to<br />
be associated with moves to increase productivity in this<br />
country. In that process it may be that the outcome for<br />
1988/ 89 will see the wages movement slightly above the<br />
forecast for the Budget but not in a way which will in any<br />
sense undermine the strategy of the Budget.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke has your office completed its<br />
re-examination of Mr Sarich's proposal and what's your<br />
feeling about it? Are you inclined to<br />
PM: No well the various Departmental people have been<br />
looking at this. I haven't at this stage received the<br />
report of their consideration. In this area what we want to<br />
achieve if it's possible is a position where Mr Sarich will<br />
manufacture in this country. We have already as you know<br />
provided a considerable amount of assistance and you've got<br />
to strike the right balance between how far you can go in<br />
providing assistance to private enterprise in this way. For<br />
the purpose of maintaining in the country, you're maximising<br />
in this country a manufacturing investment, but without<br />
creating a situation where you're going to unjustifiably<br />
subsidise some private operator. Now I'm waiting to get the<br />
report. we'll make a decision on the basis of that report.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you've talked about the private<br />
executive salaries but is the Government concerned about<br />
PM: Well let's look at the situation there with the OTC<br />
story you know. Where the most publicity as I understand it<br />
recently has been about Australia Post and that basically if<br />
I may say so has been a beat-up. In this period of<br />
December/ January no-one's to blame in the media but it's a<br />
quiet time and you get beat-ups as you know. I find most of<br />
them pretty amusing actually. In the case of Australia Post<br />
what has basically been happening there is that there has<br />
been a legitimate office restructuring, some new positions<br />
have been created and some people have been promoted into<br />
those new positions and increases in salary have been<br />
associated with those promotions but basically the pay<br />
levels in Australia Post are very much related to the APS<br />
and I don't see any movements there that are going to create<br />
undue strains. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What about the judges salary?<br />
PM: Well the judges salaries as I've said all along, you've<br />
got, with judges you've got a very difficult situation.<br />
We're not going to allow the decisions we take in that area<br />
to upset the restraint that we want to see exercised in the<br />
general area of wage fixing in this country and judges have<br />
to understand that, that they can't be treated in isolation<br />
from the general area of wage fixation. They would argue<br />
perhaps and I could understand it, that there area special<br />
considerations applying to them and in some senses there<br />
are. We can't ignore the fact and we will not ignore the<br />
fact that at the level of the Federal Court there has, over<br />
recent years, been some difficulty in attracting people from<br />
the Bar to the Bench because of the very high levels of<br />
remuneration which are available to legal professsion. Some<br />
of the salaries which they earn are almost mind boggling if<br />
I may say so. But nevertheless that does create a problem.<br />
Now we've got to take that into account and we will. But I<br />
can assure both the judges that on the side of the judges<br />
that we will try and get an outcome which meets some of<br />
their legitimate concerns and I can also say to workers<br />
generally in this country that we will attempt to handle<br />
this is a way which they can see is just.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you making a decision on this before the<br />
end of the wages negotiations<br />
PM: The actual timing of the decision as to the judges<br />
salaries, I couldn't give you that now but we will be going<br />
into discussions with the trade union movement and I repeat<br />
also with employers as we talk about the wages round in the<br />
very near future. So it will at least be the case that<br />
before we've made a decision in regard to the judges we will<br />
have started some of the discussions with the trade unions<br />
and the business community.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident that Mr Hand's administration<br />
of Aboriginal Affairs due to report the Inquiry is due<br />
to report next month?<br />
PM: Yes I've indicated on the floor of the Parliament and<br />
outside of the Parliament that I have confidence in Mr Hand.<br />
Let me make it clear. I think that Mr Hand is one of the<br />
truly outstanding Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs that this<br />
country has seen. He has the level and type of compassion<br />
which is appropriate for this portfolio but it's not a blind<br />
or a soft compassion. He has and I've seen the evidence of<br />
it, he has a capacity to be tough where toughness is what's<br />
required. You've got to understand in my judgement at<br />
least that when you're dealing with the question of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs, when you're dealing with the question of<br />
dispensation of very substantial amounts of money around<br />
Australia for so many organisations and individuals in the<br />
Aboriginal community, there are going to be pressures and<br />
difficulties. You can't always apply exactly the same sorts<br />
of standards of accountability or involvement that you may </p>
<p>-9-<br />
PM ( cont): in other areas. That doesn't mean that you just<br />
have an open slather and Mr hand certainly hasn't done that.<br />
We have shown as a Government that we've got nothing to<br />
hide. We want to have every possible inquiry into any<br />
allegations that have been made and the various instruments<br />
that I have established for this purpose will go about their<br />
business and we'll receive reports. If out of those reports<br />
there is a need to adopt some changes in approach to funding<br />
then we will of course do that. As to Mr Hand himself I<br />
have total confidence in him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you anticipate any Ministerial changes<br />
before the next election? Specifically do you think Mr<br />
Holding will remain a Minister this year and when's the<br />
election going to be?<br />
PM: I don't anticipate any further changes at this stage.<br />
I have nothing on the plate. Yes I think Mr Holding will<br />
remain a Minister. And when will the election be? Well I<br />
can say to you what I think I've said it publicly before<br />
that really you're looking at a sort of period of the latter<br />
part of this year through to May of next year. That's<br />
essentially the period within which an election can most<br />
properly be held. It is the case that you could have the<br />
House of Representatives going up until November of 1990.<br />
But that means you would have to have a half Senate election<br />
by the middle of the year and then a House of<br />
Representatives election. It would be a pretty bold Prime<br />
Minister that would try and pull that one off and I'm bold<br />
and aggressive but I don't think I'm that silly. So that<br />
really means that the outer limit is about May of next year<br />
than the earlier limit of, say, the latter part of this<br />
year. JOURNALIST: Are you still confident that you can conclude a<br />
treaty negotiations with the Aboriginal community by that<br />
time?<br />
PM: I have never asserted, said that is what will be done.<br />
I've said that is an objective. Now the important thing is<br />
process. I believe that the interests of this and future<br />
generations of Australia will be very well served if we can<br />
get a treaty or compact the word has never worried me<br />
but a basis of understanding between the Aborigines of this<br />
country and the non-Aboriginal population. I am absolutely<br />
convinced that the best interests of everyone, both<br />
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, would be served by the<br />
achievement of that outcome. There is no point in rushing<br />
it or trying to force it upon people, particularly in a<br />
situation where you have such may I say vicious<br />
misrepresentation by our conservative opponents about the<br />
nature of such an agreement. Now what needs to be done is<br />
to allow the processes within the Aboriginal community which<br />
are going on, we want them to say to us what sorts of things<br />
that they would like to see covered by such an<br />
understanding. Then, in the relatively near future, I think<br />
Mr Hand will be coming to me with recommendations as to how<br />
we should develop the process within the non-Aboriginal </p>
<p>-1 0-<br />
PM ( cont): community of discussions about this issue. Now<br />
it would be nice if those processes could comfortably<br />
produce an outcome of such an agreement within the life of<br />
this Parliament. That's certainly what the Government would<br />
like to see, I understand it's what the churches would like<br />
to see, who've concerned themselves with this issue and if<br />
it can be done well I certainly would be very proud to be<br />
associated with it. The important thing is to do it in a<br />
way which is going to mean that the people of Australia<br />
both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal are content and secure<br />
and happy about the process. If it takes longer than the<br />
life of this Parliament so be it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister while George Bush has got a<br />
fairly tough economic decisions to make early in his<br />
Administration, what's your measure of the impact or the<br />
potential impact on us of the decisions he has to make?<br />
PM: Let me put it this way. There is no doubt that within<br />
the United States and in the rest of the world there is a<br />
developing understanding of the need for the United States<br />
to tackle the twin deficit problem and until that is done<br />
then you are going have a distorted interest rate and trade<br />
pattern internationally which can adversely effect us. Now<br />
the important thing is that that is clearly understood and I<br />
know from personal correspondence that I've had with<br />
President-elect George Bush that he is aware of this. I<br />
believe that he's going to address the issue in a way which<br />
is more than simply a confection or superficial I think he<br />
will handle it in a way calculated to deal effectively with<br />
the problems. Now let me say only one thing beyond that and<br />
it's this that some people historically have argued that if<br />
the incoming Administration in conjunction with the Congress<br />
was to tackle the budget deficit seriously that that could<br />
lead to a significant decline in the economic activity in<br />
the United States as they brought the budget deficit down.<br />
I have never believed that that simplistic analysis is<br />
accurate because I would think that if both the business<br />
community within the United States and internationally<br />
formed the judgement that the incoming Administration was<br />
serious about dealing with that problem then let's give very<br />
very considerable boost to confidence. So my judgement is<br />
that the interests of Australia are very much served by the<br />
incoming President effectively tackling these problems and I<br />
have reason to believe that he will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you know when you'll meet him?<br />
PM: Sometime this year. I can't be certain at this stage<br />
but we have a very, very good personal relationship as you<br />
know, we're in communication with one another and will<br />
continue to be so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Bond's comments regarding support for<br />
Premier Dowding and also liking Premier Dowding to Margaret<br />
Thatcher. How damaging have they been to this State Party<br />
and in particular your Party? </p>
<p>-11-<br />
PM: Well I hadn't found them damaging to my Party<br />
federally. As far as the State of Western Australia is<br />
concerned let me say this. It's crystal clear that if you<br />
look at the range of issues which have to be dealt with by a<br />
State Government then the interests of the people of Western<br />
Australia will be significantly better served by the return<br />
of the Dowding Government than by a resort to a disorganised<br />
confrontationist group who form the Opposition over there.<br />
In what has already been a fairly brief campaign they've<br />
demonstrated overwhelmingly their incapacity to work<br />
together. They are at odds on fundamental issues. For<br />
instance in the area of industrial relations you've had the<br />
humiliating prospect of the National Party coming out and<br />
saying what their policy would be and then a public brawl<br />
and scrap between the National Party and the Liberals with<br />
the National Party having to partly pull back but with the<br />
loaded gun up there over the Public Service in that State.<br />
So they have shown a total incapacity to offer any cohesion<br />
in that area and now in the very area which they've said was<br />
going to be their heavy artillery against Labor in the area<br />
of the Development Corporation, a total conflict between<br />
them with the Liberals saying " we're going to scrap it" and<br />
" oh no, no, no we're not. We're going to keep it". Now<br />
they chose the ground. They said the issue of the future of<br />
the Development Corporation was central, the central issue<br />
for the people of Western Australia to make up their mind on<br />
and they can't make up their own minds about it. They are<br />
fighting one another with the Nationals saying " we'll keep<br />
it", the Liberals saying " no we won't". Now the fact that<br />
Mr Bond has made the obviously correct observation with the<br />
best interests of Western Australia could be served by<br />
continuing Labor than resorting to this into this mish-mash<br />
of uncoordinated unsophisticates is not surprising. You<br />
would expect him to state the obvious and I'm confident that<br />
the West Australian people will come to the same conclusion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what did you think of the cricket?<br />
PM: Now this is the last one. I think the first item on<br />
the next Cabinet meeting will have to be consideration of<br />
proposals for new rules for rain interrupted one day games.<br />
The present situation is entirely unacceptable.<br />
ends </p>
