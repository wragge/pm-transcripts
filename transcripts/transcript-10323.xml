THE DEPARTMENT OF<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET I<br />
1/<br />
K-'<br />
WIK TASK FORCE<br />
The Prime Minister released the following statement to the media on 1 May 1997.<br />
WIK 10 POINT PLAN<br />
Following discussions with the government members' Aboriginal Affairs Committee<br />
today I am pleased to publicly release my 10 Point Plan in response to the High<br />
Court's Wik decision.<br />
The issues thrown up by the Wik decision are difficult and complex. I believe that<br />
this plan offers the one fair, practical response which, and importantly, provides<br />
certainty to pastoralists and miners, but respects native title.<br />
I have spent a great deal of personal time and effort in seeking a solution.<br />
I will continue to discuss aspects of my plan with all interested parties as well as the<br />
government members' committee and the party room. </p>
<p>KEY LEGISLATIVE ELEMENTS OF THE PACKAGE<br />
1. Validation of acts/ grants between 1/ 1/ 94 and 23/ 12/ 96<br />
Legislative action will be taken to ensure that the validity of any acts or grants<br />
made in relation to non-vacant crown land in the period between passage of the<br />
Native Title Act and the Wik decision is put beyond doubt.<br />
2. Confirmation of extinguishment of native title on ' exclusive' tenures<br />
States and Territories would be able to confirm that ' exclusive' tenures such as<br />
freehold, residential, commnercial and public works in existence on or before<br />
1 January 1994 extinguish native title. Agricultural leases would also be<br />
covered to the extent that it can reasonably be said that by reason of the grant<br />
or the nature of the permnitted use of the land, exclusive possession must have<br />
been intended.<br />
3. Provision of government services<br />
Impediments to the provision of government services in relation to land on<br />
which native title may exist would be removed.<br />
4. Native title and pastoral leases<br />
As provided in the Wik decision, native title rights over current or former<br />
pastoral leases and any agricultural leases not covered under 2 above would be<br />
permanently extinguished to the extent that those rights are inconsistent with<br />
those of the pastoralist.<br />
All activities pursuant to, or incidental to, ' primary production'' would be<br />
allowed on pastoral leases including farmstay tourism, even if native title<br />
exists, provided the dominant purpose of the use of the land is primary<br />
production. However, future govenrment action such as the upgrading of title<br />
to perpetual or ' exclusive' leases or freehold, would necessitate the acquisition<br />
of any native title rights proven to exist and the application of the regime<br />
described in 7 below ( except where this is unnecessary because the pastoralist<br />
has an existing legally enforceable right to upgrade).<br />
Statutory access rights<br />
Where registered claimants can demonstrate that they Currently have physical<br />
access to pastoral lease land, their continued access will be legislatively<br />
confi rmed until the native title claim is determnined. This would not affect<br />
existing access rights established by state or territory legislation.<br />
6. Future mining activity<br />
* For mining on vacant crown land there would be a higher registration test for<br />
claimants seeking the right to negotiate, no negotiations on exploration, and<br />
only one right to negotiate per project. As currently provided in the NTA,<br />
This will be based on the definition in the Income Tax Assessnent Act 1936. a copy' of which is<br />
attached. </p>
<p>states and territories would be able to put in place alternate regimes with<br />
similar right to negotiate provisions.<br />
For mining on other ' non-exclusive' tenures such as current or former<br />
pastoral leasehold land and national parks, the right to negotiate would<br />
continue to apply in a state or territory unless and until that state or territory<br />
provided a statutory regime acceptable to the Commonwealth which<br />
included procedural rights at least equivalent to other parties with an interest<br />
in the land the holder of the pastoral lease) and compensation which<br />
can take account of the nature of co-existing native title rights ( where they<br />
are proven to exist).<br />
7. Future government and commercial development<br />
On vacant crown land outside towns and cities there would be a higher<br />
registration test to access the right to negotiate, but the right to negotiate<br />
would be removed in relation to the acquisition of native title rights for third<br />
par-ties for the purpose of governiment-type infr-astr-ucture. As Currently<br />
provided in the NTA, states and territories would be able to put in place<br />
alternate regimes with similar right to negotiate provisions.<br />
For compulsory acquisition of native title rights on other ' non-exclusive'<br />
tenures such as current or former pastoral leasehold land and national parks,<br />
the right to negotiate would continue to apply in a state or territory unless<br />
and until that state or territory provided a statutory regime acceptable to the<br />
Commonwealth which included procedural rights at least equivalent to other<br />
parties with an interest in the land the holder of the pastoral lease) and<br />
compensation which can take account of the nature of co-existing native title<br />
rights ( where they are proven to exist).<br />
The right to negotiate would be removed in relation to the acquisition of land<br />
for third parties in towns and cities, although native title holders would gain<br />
the same procedural and compensation rights as other landholders.<br />
Future actions for the management of any existing national park or forest<br />
reserve would be allowed.<br />
A regime to authorise activities such as the taking of timber or gravel on<br />
pastoral leases, would be provided.<br />
8. Management of water resources and airspace<br />
The ability of governments to regulate and manage surface and subsurface<br />
water, off-shore resources and airspace, and the rights of those with interests<br />
under any such regulatory or management regime would be put beyond doubt.<br />
9. Management of claims<br />
* In relation to new and existing native title claims, there would be a higher<br />
registration test to access the right to negotiate, amendments to speed up </p>
<p>handling of claims, and measures to encourage the States to manage claims<br />
within their own systems.<br />
SA sunset clause within which new claims would have to be made would be<br />
introduced. Agreements<br />
Measures would be introduced to facilitate the negotiation of voluntary but<br />
binding agreements as an alternative to more formal native title machinery.<br />
DEFINITION OF ' PRIMARY PRODUCTION'<br />

the cultivation of land;<br />
