    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will attend this yearâs World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The WEFâs annual Davos meeting brings together some 2,500 business and political leaders to discuss key global issues.</p>
<p>It will be an opportunity to showcase Australia and the Governmentâs reform agenda to international political and business leaders.</p>
<p>I will meet with Heads of Government in attendance, host Australiaâs B20 delegation of business leaders and deliver a keynote address to outline Australiaâs approach to the Presidency of the G20.</p>
<p>Chairing the G20 this year gives our country a unique chance to influence the international economic debate.</p>
<p>We should make the most of our G20 Presidency to help provide economic leadership to the wider world and promote our attractiveness as an investment destination.</p>
<p>The Hon Warren Truss MP will be Acting Prime Minister in my absence.</p>
