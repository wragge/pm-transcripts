PRIME MINISTER 55/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS, THE<br />
HON SENATOR BOB COLLINS MP<br />
PAY TV<br />
The Government has opened the way for a competitive new<br />
industry in subscription broadcasting.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and<br />
Communications, Senator Bob Collins, today announced a<br />
package of legislation which will enable a diverse range<br />
of operators, and technologies to develop programming and<br />
programming services for Australians.<br />
There will be no exclusivity attached to programming and<br />
all licences will be able to compete fully.<br />
The Government has decided to allow from the-outset the<br />
widest possible range of services using a variety of<br />
technologies, including satellite, cable and microwave,<br />
Senator Collins said.<br />
Over the next few years, the establishment of Pay TV<br />
should see some 4000 new jobs created. Australian<br />
manufacturing and service industries will directly<br />
benefit. Australian content rules will ensure the film and<br />
television production industries gain a new outlet for<br />
creative programming.<br />
All satellite subscription television licensees will be<br />
required to spend at least 10 per cent of their annual<br />
programming expenditure on any predominantly drama<br />
channel, such as a movie channel, on new Australian drama<br />
programs.<br />
A four-transponder satellite service is expected to be<br />
available within two years, delivered by an Optus<br />
satellite. </p>
<p>The Government will use a competitive, price-based<br />
process later this year to allocate a licence for this<br />
service. Licences to use the other two available Pay TV<br />
transponders will be sold individually within one year of<br />
the sale of the first licence.<br />
A year's breathing space on other satellite services<br />
gives the multi-channel operator a chance to establish<br />
itself in the marketplace.<br />
A number of ownership conditions will apply to the fourtransponder<br />
service which will ensure the emergence of a<br />
new force in the Australian broadcasting industry.<br />
There will be no free-to-air television equity allowed.<br />
Telecommunications carriers and large newspaper groups<br />
will also be excluded.<br />
Foreign ownership will be restricted to 35% aggregate<br />
with a 20% limit on any individual.<br />
Licensees operating on the fifth and sixth transponders<br />
will also be subject to the 20/ 35% foreign equity<br />
constraint. However, the networks, the national broadcasters such as<br />
the ABC and telecommunications carriers such as AOTC will<br />
be able to bid without restriction.<br />
No one will be able to control more than one satellite<br />
licence. This will mean that the licensees of the fifth and sixth<br />
transponders will be in a position to compete sensibly<br />
with the initial licensee and be in a position to develop<br />
cable technology as it becomes available.<br />
To ensure that the ABC can participate in the bidding,<br />
the Government is willing to fund part of its equity<br />
commitment in any consortia. The Commonwealth will do<br />
this only when it is satisfied with the overall level of<br />
Commonwealth liability involved.<br />
The Government has also agreed to investigate ways of<br />
improving and expanding free-to-air services in regional<br />
and remote areas where early access to Pay TV will be<br />
difficult. CANBERRA 3 June 1992 </p>
