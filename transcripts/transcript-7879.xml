TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH NEVILLE OLIVER, ABC RADIO,<br />
AUCKLAND 1 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
OLIVER: just joined us in our Commonwealth Games<br />
studio here in Auckland, the Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
Bob Hawke. Welcome Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thanks Neville. Can I just say at the outset,<br />
congratulations for your coverage. I mean it's been<br />
fantastic. So very well received in Australia I can tell<br />
you. OLIVER: Thank you very much. How has the Australian<br />
performance been received in Australia?<br />
PM: Everyone's very very proud. You know we started off<br />
before the Games started and there was a bit of adverse<br />
publicity about, y'know, a little bit of behaviour. A<br />
lot of headlines about that. But I was very confident<br />
once the business end of the proceedings started that our<br />
people would get down to it. And they have. Australians<br />
are tremendously proud of them.<br />
OLIVER: What's been your special moment of the Games?<br />
PM: Special moment? Well I suppose one of our<br />
competitors that I felt very very pleased for was<br />
Clarkey. I mean he really has been, over a long period<br />
of time, a battler. He's always been on the edge of,<br />
y'know, a medal. I was very pleased for him in the 400<br />
metres. It was<br />
OLIVER: And of course then there's young Hayley Lewis.<br />
I mean Australia has always had an expectation of having<br />
good swimmers.<br />
PM: Yes, well tremendous performance. And I must say<br />
one of the things that was a highlight for me at the<br />
Australian end was I was up in Brisbane last week, I was<br />
out in Caboolture, and someone said to me ' you know young<br />
van Wirdum's dad might be around out here'. And I said<br />
oh is that right. I got out there to Caboolture and<br />
there was this little bloke, old pair of shorts, old<br />
shirt, and you've never seen anyone so proud as he was.<br />
He was a lovely bloke. He was just bursting with pride<br />
about Karen's performance. He said ' I'm a single parent,<br />
brought her up myself'. That was very touching. I </p>
<p>suppose if I had to have sort of one moment in terms of<br />
what it meant for a family I just saw that very proud<br />
dad, Bob van Wirdum. He'd brought this kid up himself.<br />
OLIVER: Fantastic.<br />
PM: Great.<br />
OLIVER: That's what it's all about really isn't it.<br />
PM: Isn't it. Yes.<br />
OLIVER: The AIS. I've been taking particular notice of<br />
their performances. I can remember when it was set up<br />
after the disaster of.' 76. The AIS as an initiative<br />
what are your views on it now?<br />
PM: I think it's marvellous. I mean there's been a lot<br />
of sort of navel-gazing about it by a lot of people. As<br />
you know you're in the media a lot of the media tends<br />
to want to look just at the down side of things and not<br />
be terribly constructive and positive. But what we're<br />
seeing here with that national anthem of ours being<br />
played 43 times in these Games is the reflection of that<br />
good investment in the Australian Institute of Sport.<br />
And it's not only at the level of athletics. But you<br />
know we've got the cricket aspect of it with the cricket<br />
academy in Adelaide. In that match that I had yesterday,<br />
the Prime Minsiter's XI against Pakistan, there was about<br />
five or six of my side, young blokes, coming through the<br />
academy. You can see it now, the standard of Australian<br />
cricket. That pool of talent we've got there is better<br />
than anything we've had before I think.<br />
OLIVER: What about the relevance of the Commonwealth<br />
Games? Edinburgh was an absolute disaster in terms of<br />
the black African boycott. If the black Africans turn<br />
up, it is a meaningful event, is it not?<br />
PM: Very meaningful. I mean you look at the sort of<br />
standards that are being achieved here. You've got to<br />
remember the Commonwealth covers such a representative of<br />
the nations of the world. A third of the population,<br />
approximately a third of the population I think. It<br />
ranges from the second largest in India, 800 million<br />
people, down to the tiniest. All colours, creeds. It is<br />
a very very representative, if you like, body of nations<br />
of the world with very special characteristics. I think<br />
it's a very worthwhile institution.<br />
OLIVER: Could I ask you Prime Minister if Hazel elbowed<br />
you out of the way to present Lisa with a gold medal?<br />
Lisa Martin. That happened just a little while ago<br />
folks. I was just wondering whether she pulled rank on<br />
you. </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: No she didn't. They'd asked me and it just occurred<br />
to someone ' well what about Hazel?'. I never stand in<br />
Hazel's road in these things. She does a tremendous job<br />
for Australia here and overseas and I thought it was just<br />
beaut that she did it.<br />
OLIVER: Are you going to have time with all your other<br />
engagements to fit a bit of golf in?<br />
PM: The major event of the Games is on Saturday morning<br />
at nine o'clock. A head-on between Australia and New<br />
Zealand.<br />
OLIVER: What's the form like?<br />
PM: Well I'm playing him off the stick. They tell me<br />
he's spent a lot of time, Geoffrey, over the<br />
Christmas/ New Year break practising. But I just had a<br />
couple of games myself. The head to head contest stands<br />
two-one Australian favour at the moment.<br />
OLIVER: Good. With the way we've gone in the Games<br />
you've got a bit of tradition to uphold now.<br />
PM: Bloody oath.<br />
OLIVER: Can I just be cheeky enough before we go. We've<br />
just heard the news from Australia about the balance of<br />
payments. Is that a gold medal performance?<br />
PM: Is that a-<br />
OLIVER: Am I allowed to ask you that?<br />
PM: Is that a sporting question? Oh well, broadly<br />
defined a sporting question. It was very good. It came<br />
in on the low side of expectations. It confirms what we<br />
had been hoping to see. Things are slowing down a bit<br />
while still having growth. But slowing down to a<br />
sustainable level and it validates the action that was<br />
taken, beginning to take in the area of monetary<br />
policy. OLIVER: So 43 gold medals and I'll award the Government<br />
one for that eh.<br />
PM: Thanks mate.<br />
OLIVER: Good to have you in Prime Minister.<br />
PM: And could I say again congratulations to you all.<br />
You've done Australia proud.<br />
OLIVER: Thank you very much. It's terrific that you're<br />
so accessible to us. Thanks for dropping in.<br />
ends </p>
