PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT MONDAY, MARCH 16 1981<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE. THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PREMIER<br />
FOR QUEENSLAND ( BRISBANE)<br />
Premier: just an interesting discussion, exchanging views on<br />
quite a different number of subjects.<br />
Question: Which particular subjects?<br />
Premier: Well, no end of subjects. We talked about our hospitals,<br />
State/ Commonwealth relationships and problems there<br />
We have given a clear indication of our views which I<br />
am sure will be taken into account. On irrigation matters<br />
we discussed details there in Bundaberg and elsewhere.<br />
These sort of things.<br />
Question: Did you discuss tax?<br />
Premier: Yes we did, but we have both got very definite views on<br />
tax. I know your views on it you think you pay too much.<br />
Question: So, you didn't agree with the Prime Minister?<br />
Premier:<br />
Well, we didn't really have any discussion on tax.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We have had that discussion.<br />
Question: Did you discuss the possibility of the Federal Government<br />
cutting Queensland's share of the tax inaudible..?<br />
Premier: That was mentioned. Yes, that was mentioned also. Here<br />
egain, I don't know that there is anything intended in<br />
this regard by the Commonwealth. I didn't get that impression<br />
from our discussions. Naturally we told the Prime Minister<br />
our views in that regard, but again, I think a lot of that<br />
was just views expressed by one or two of the Federal Ministers. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Question:<br />
Mr Fraser, just what is your view in that area?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think all governments should be as lean as they possibly<br />
can be and save-tax payers dollars.<br />
Question: -* tt for tat arrangement whereby Queensland is getting<br />
a bit of resources tax or through the resources tax, therefore<br />
they should get less federal money. Did you<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That is not really something you should put that question<br />
to the Grants Commission, because the Grants Commission at<br />
the moment is doing an examination of the relativity between<br />
all the States. That report won't be available, I don't<br />
think, Premier, until about the middle of June. They will<br />
then be assessing the proportions of the total tax pool<br />
that now goes to the States to see how much each. State<br />
ought to get. It is up to governments to decide what they<br />
do with that report. Since the proportions were first<br />
established, many years ago, there have obviously been<br />
very great changes in the relative wealth of different<br />
States. All the Premiers in the Commonwealth agreed about<br />
two or three years ago that there ought to be an examination<br />
of this. Now, how it comes out I have no idea at all, but the<br />
report will be available in June -and we will be looking<br />
at it. I think it is also worth noting of course, that<br />
because-of the problems of large States such as Queensland<br />
and Western Australia, and also the problems of States such<br />
as Tasmania, the Commonwealth payments to Western Australia,<br />
Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia on a per capita<br />
basis has been very, very much greater than it would have<br />
been to Victoria or New South Wales. That isthe historical<br />
reason, and it really needs to be kept in your mind when<br />
you are asking the kind of question you did about taxes<br />
on ; resources.<br />
Question: So you are sort:-, of laying the groundworks there for a suggestion<br />
that there should be a reduction in moneys to those two States?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, I am not laying the groundwork for anything. I am giving<br />
an historic background, and indicating quite plainly that<br />
the Grants Commission, at the request of all the Premiers<br />
and the Commonwealth, have been looking at this. When we<br />
get their report we will examine it.<br />
Question: What option will you favour, Mr Prime Minister? / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
How would I know when I haven't seen the report?<br />
What I do favour, and I have said very plainly, and will<br />
go on saying, that all governments should be as restrainedL<br />
in their own expenditure as possible, because that is the<br />
only way that you can really reduce taxes.<br />
Question: Ir<br />
Mr Premier, you have said in the past that you just won't<br />
have a bar of that. Have you changed your tune?<br />
Premier: . I<br />
No, no. I indicated, naturally, to the Prime Minister<br />
exactly what I thought of any such suggestion, that we<br />
certainly wouldn't go along with it. No, but let's cross<br />
that bridge when we come to it. I don't think we will<br />
come to that. I am sure the--Prime Minister appreciates<br />
our position. wait and see.<br />
Question: L<br />
Has he given you an assurance of that?<br />
Premier: No, he hasn't given me assurance. He wouldn't do that.<br />
You don't do those sort of things in politics.<br />
Question: L<br />
What makes you think it won't come to it<br />
Premier: I think he would respect our wishes.<br />
Question: . inaudible<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We have to have a look at the reports so I think we both<br />
agree with that.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, you have expressed concern at the growth in<br />
the State public service. Did you express those views today?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, we'were talking about' a whole range of issues, and only<br />
very passing references to tax. But, I have said that often<br />
it is right across the board. But it is just part of the<br />
general proposition that if tax cuts are to be real, government<br />
must be restrained in their expenditure. We can't spend the<br />
same dollar twice. You can't spend it out of your pocket, and </p>
<p>Prime Min ister: ( cont.)<br />
and neither can the Government spend it again on top of that.<br />
If taxes are to be reduced, governments must be restrained<br />
in their expenditure. I didn't say it today because we were<br />
really talking about other things, but I have made the point<br />
that State and local governments spend a little over<br />
of the final dollars spent by governments, and therefore,<br />
in the interests of lower taxation, the expenditure of<br />
State governments is obviously relevant, just as the<br />
expenditure of the Federal Government.<br />
Question: Mr Premier, as a result of what you have heard today,<br />
are you in for an especially tough time next month?<br />
Premier: No, I am not. I expect a good time next month, because I think<br />
I have done some ground work, too. I think it is a matter<br />
of waiting to see. Things change from day to day in politics.<br />
You never know quite what is going to happen and what is<br />
around the corner. So, when that day comes, we will assess<br />
it and the propositions that are put forward at that time,<br />
I don't think the Prime Minister would have anything firm<br />
in his mind as to what the attitude would be toa particular<br />
State, or States generally. Perhaps to an extent he would,<br />
but on the other hand, we will worry about that later<br />
when we get there.<br />
Question: Mr Fraser said he would work out his ground work, and<br />
you say you have worked out your groundwork. What is your<br />
groundwork? Premier: My groundwork is just to get a fair deal for Queensland,<br />
nothing else. If we by good management may eVen have been<br />
able to get tremendous growth and development where people<br />
come from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia,<br />
as they do in New Zealand all the time by some thousands<br />
every month, that indicates a good solid State where it is<br />
good to live, and everybody knows that. But that shouldn't<br />
detract from what our entitlemehts are. That should actually<br />
add to it because the Commonwealth will get much more taxation<br />
as , a consequence of the development here in Queensland.<br />
Question: What were some of the other things you discussed today?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We discussed some matters relating to the establishment ofr<br />
national parks in Queensland which invc~ lves the transfer<br />
of Commonwealth held land to the State. We discussed<br />
in very broad terms Aboriginal questions. The Commonwealth Games </p>
<p>Prime Minister: ( cont.)<br />
we discussed at quite some length. I think most of them have<br />
been mentioned hospital and hospital cost sharing.<br />
Question: On the Commonwealth Games, did you discuss the possibility<br />
of ' a-boycott at all by African nations?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't really think that that will happen, you know.[<br />
Australia is well regarded and I think African nations<br />
are probably more concerned at events outside Australia<br />
inielation to the Commonwealth Games. The British<br />
Lions Tour of Africa, I think, did a good deal of harm.<br />
They are concerned, I know, about the Springbok Tour<br />
of New Zealand, and Mr Muldoon has said he is opposed<br />
to that tour, but it still looks as though it will<br />
take place. These are the sorts of things which have<br />
disturbed the African nations in relation to the GleneaglesL<br />
agreement which I helped to negotiated, three or four years<br />
ago. Mr Ordia ., from Nigeria will be out here shortly<br />
and will be having discussions with people here. But,<br />
I believe the general respect with which Australia<br />
has held will assist Queensland in relation to the r<br />
Commonwealth Games. But having said that, it is, and can<br />
be a very emotional issue. I think you would understand<br />
the reasons for that, and events outside Australia, events<br />
in which Australia is not involved, would be capable<br />
of making that a very difficult issue.<br />
Question: The Australian Security and Intelligence Service is that<br />
bugging foreign embassies in Australia? r<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We don't talk about the work that ASIO does. The Leader<br />
of the opposition is briefed quite regularly on the work<br />
of ASIO, and the reforms recommended by Mr Justice Hope<br />
have been implemented as a new legislative charter for<br />
ASIO. Under Mr Justice Woodward, I have no doubt that the<br />
both have the total confidence in the work that the organisation<br />
is doing.<br />
Question: . inaudible..?<br />
I thought the question was asked about ASIO/<br />
Question: AS IS. r </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, we don't answer questions about ASIS, or any of the<br />
security organisations. But in terms of the briefings that<br />
are available to the Leader of the Opposition, that would<br />
apply in relation to ASIS, just as much as to ASIO.<br />
Question: What, of the discussions you had today, to you, was the<br />
major thing to come out of those talks?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It is very useful to be in Queensland, and useful to<br />
have discussions in a relaxed way with the Premier and<br />
the Deputy Premier. I think that fact alone -quite<br />
apart from the substance of the discussions . So . often<br />
during the period of:. the Premiers' Conference or the<br />
times the Premier is in Canberra, there is other business<br />
around, and time is pressed. At the* iPremiers' Conference,<br />
there are other Premiers pressing their claims just as<br />
Mr Petersen presses claims for the State of Queensland.<br />
Just to be able to be here and to discuss a number of issues<br />
in a relaxed way, and to set in train some processes and<br />
procedures which I think will enable us to settle a number<br />
of outstanding issues, I would hope, quite quickly in the<br />
next few weeks.<br />
Premier: gives you a good feeling to be in Queensland, does it, L<br />
Mr Fraser?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It always does. It gives me a good feeling to be in Australia.<br />
Question: Do you intend to have similar discussions with Mr Wran?<br />
Prime Minister: I<br />
If he wanted those discussions, I am very easy to I am<br />
much closer than Brisbane, and I am in Sydney very often.<br />
Quite obviously. Mr Wran and I have discussions on a number<br />
of issues and sometimes come to joint views, as we did in<br />
relation to that Expo in Sydney.<br />
Question: On that Commonwealth Games problem, did you also discuss<br />
expediting the upgrading of Brisbane Airport to cope with the<br />
Commonwealth Games?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I am not aware that there is a particular problem in relation<br />
to that. There is no way that the new works can be completed<br />
in relatio~ n to the Games. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Question: I gather there is a temporary upgrading though, to somehow<br />
cope with the..?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well that matter was not raised. if there is a problem<br />
there, we will certainly look at it.<br />
Question: . put on the hospitals issue and the inaudible..<br />
Aborigine inaudible. What was the discussion?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We discussed the consequeces of the Premier's intention<br />
inirelation to Queensland Acts, and there will be ongoing<br />
discussions in relation to that at the request of the<br />
Premier and myself. In relation to hospitals, without<br />
going into any of the details, we discussed the manner<br />
in-which the Commonwealth would make continued payments<br />
in support of hospitals.<br />
Question: inaudible<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I wouldn't have any idea, Michelle. L<br />
Question:<br />
Mr Fraser, how do you intend to inaudible..<br />
to restrain its expenditure?<br />
Prime Minister:.<br />
That is entirely a decision for the State of Queensland<br />
and for the government of Queensland.<br />
Question: inaudible.._____<br />
Prime minister:<br />
I suppose the money that the Commonwealth in its generosity<br />
ultimately makes available to States is solely a decision<br />
for the Commonwealth to make, as the Premier, and other<br />
Premiers would know. It is our legislation.<br />
Question: that the criticisms of Queensland's export coal rail<br />
freight policy are to quote, ill-informed and unsupportable..<br />
Would you agree with him, or would you agree with.. inaudible..? </p>
<p>6<br />
-8-<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
What are the criticisms?<br />
Question: The criticisms of the export rail freight charges are that<br />
this is a way of imposing a pseudo resources tax of a<br />
kind that is only distributed to people of Queensland<br />
rather than perhaps the people of the nation.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Dr Edwards explained Queensland's approach to it and I am<br />
not going to be arguing dt. a State that manages to run<br />
a railway at a pirof it. I would much sooner those States<br />
that run Iheir railways at a vast loss were able to reduce<br />
their losses, because what you ascribe the charges to lead<br />
to that situation, wellthat is another part of the question.<br />
But I think the total public transport losses of various<br />
State authorities is something like $ 1,200 million.<br />
In New South Wales I think it is something like $ 500 million<br />
a year, and quite obviously, if there were no public<br />
transport deficits, no State would have any financial<br />
problems and people could have lower taxes too.<br />
Question: F<br />
Did you discuss infra structure for Gladstone at all?<br />
Premier: It was one of the ones of the list that we have given6<br />
a submission to the Prime Minister on, and it was one<br />
ofithose that we didn't get a great deal of opportunity<br />
to discuss in depth. But I have a submission again which<br />
I have already sent to the Prime Minister some months<br />
ago. It is a very inaudible.. that we are trying to<br />
clear up. </p>
