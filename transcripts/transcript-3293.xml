PRIME MINISTER 11 June 1974<br />
Press Statement No. 265<br />
NEW MINISTRY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said that since<br />
the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party had re-elected the<br />
whole ministry, he had proposed to the Governor-General<br />
that the Ministry continue in office with only such<br />
changes as were necessary to take account of the defeat<br />
of the Minister for Immigration, Mr Grassby, and changes<br />
in administrative arrangements.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he had seen the<br />
Governor-General and that with his agreement he was now<br />
making known details of the Ministry and of administrative<br />
changes which would be submitted to the Governor-General<br />
tomorrow. The Ministry changes will be<br />
Dr. Cairns becomes Deputy Prime Minister as well<br />
as Minister for Overseas Trade<br />
Senator Wriedt becomes Minister for Agriculture<br />
instead of Minister for Primary Industry<br />
Mr. Cameron becomes Minister for Labor and<br />
Immigration instead of Minister for Labour<br />
Senator Wheeldon becomes Minister for Repatriation<br />
and'-Compensation<br />
Mr Bishop becomes Postmaster-General<br />
Mr Enderby becomes Minister for Manufacturing<br />
Industry, instead of Minister for Secondary<br />
Industry and Minister for Supply.<br />
There are no specific responsibilities attaching<br />
to the position of Deputy Prime Minister. However, the<br />
Prime Minister said that in recognition of the special<br />
interests of Dr. Cairns in the economic area, the Priorities<br />
Review Staff would in future report to him and the proposed<br />
Adjustment Assistance Agency would be responsible to him.<br />

Senator Wriedt becomes Minister for Agriculture<br />
rather than Minister for Primary Industry at his own<br />
specific request. The functions of his Department will<br />
remain unaltered but the change in name recognises<br />
practice overseas and in most Australian States. Mr Ives<br />
will continue to be Secretary of the Department.<br />
Mr Cameron will hold the new portfolio of Labor and<br />
Immigration. To his existing functions as Minister for<br />
Labour will be added control of assisted migration.<br />
In this way, it will be possible to ensure that migrants<br />
are brought to Australia only when suitable jobs are<br />
available and in a way that will ensure welcome and<br />
understanding from unions and management. Other Immigration<br />
functions will also be undertaken for the time being<br />
by Mr Cameron but will later be transferred to such<br />
Departments as Foreign Affairs, Education and Social<br />
Security. Mr Whitlam recalled that Mr Cameron had served as<br />
Opposition Shadow Minister for Immigration.<br />
Dr Ian Sharp, Secretary to the Department of Labour,<br />
will become Secretary to the new Department. Mr R. E. Armstrong,<br />
Secretary to the Department of Immigration, will become<br />
special adviser to the Minister and the new Department on<br />
immigration matters.<br />
Following his election as the only new Minister,<br />
Senator Wheeldon becomes Minister for Repatriation and<br />
Compensation. As such, his functions will be wider than<br />
those of the former Minister for Repatriation in that<br />
this function is now seen as part of a wider total function<br />
of compensation for deserving groups in the community.<br />
The purpose of creating the new Department is to<br />
transform the old Department of Repatriation into a more<br />
comprehensive whole. There is no question of abolishing<br />
the Department: it will be expanded, and there will be<br />
no diminution in the care and concern for returned servicemen<br />
only extension of the functions of the Department to cover<br />
all aspects of compensation.<br />
The Repatriation Commission will continue to operate<br />
as at present, under the Chairmanship of Mr Kingsland, who<br />
will be appointed head of the new Department of Repatriation<br />
and Compensation. The compensation function will include<br />
such matters as Commonwealth employees compensation,<br />
seamen's compensation, natural disasters, air accidents,<br />
the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and Defence Service<br />
Homes Loans Insurance and the proposed Australian Government<br />
Insurance Office. </p>
<p>r .7 -3-<br />
A new responsibility of the Minister and his<br />
Department will be to co-ordinate action needed to put into<br />
effect the recommendations of the Woodhouse Committee on<br />
National Rehabilitation and Compensation. The report of<br />
the Committee is expected by the end of the month.<br />
Senator Bishop will become the new Postmaster-General.<br />
He takes this portfolio from Mr Bowen and will be responsible<br />
for presiding over the establishment of the two new Commissions<br />
the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications Commission<br />
proposed by the Royal Commission on the Post Office under<br />
Sir James Vernon.<br />
Mr Enderby becomes Minister for Manufacturing<br />
Industry in place of his former portfolios of Secondary<br />
Industry and Supply. The new name given to this Ministry<br />
reflects the addition to it of the manufacturing functions<br />
of the Department of Supply.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the new head of the<br />
Department of Manufacturing Industry would be Mr N. S. Currie,<br />
at present head of the Department of Supply. The<br />
Department of Supply will be abolished and most of its<br />
functions will be included in the new Department of<br />
Manufacturing Industry.<br />
Responsibility for the proposed Australian Government<br />
Purchasing Commission, which will be set up following<br />
recommendations to this effect from the Committee on<br />
Government Procurement under the Chairmanship of<br />
Sir Walter Scott, will be with the Special Minister of<br />
State, Mr Bowen. </p>
