PARLIAMENT.<br />
REPRESENTATION-AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY.<br />
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The question of according representation in Parliament to residents<br />
of the Australian Capital Territory was considered by the Commonwealth<br />
Government in September, 1944, and the decision was<br />
deferred, the then Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) indicating that the<br />
matter would be approached again after the war and after the taking<br />
of the census. A deputation from the Citizens Rights League of<br />
Canberra has since waited on me and renewed the request that residents<br />
of the Australian Capital Territory be accorded representation in<br />
Parliament. 2565.-2 </p>
<p>Cabinet to-day decided to make a recommendation to the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Labour party that the Australian Capital Territory<br />
should be given representation in the House of Representatives on the<br />
same lines as is accorded to the Northern Territory."<br />
REPRESENTATION-INCREASED MEMBERSHIP, BILL<br />
INTRODUCED:<br />
In Parliament.-On 16th April, 1943, the Attorney-General ( Dr.<br />
Evatt) introduced the Representation Bill. Dr. Evatt said-<br />
The purpose of this bill is to enlarge the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
During the first ha] f century of Australia's history as a nation,<br />
its population has more than doubled. During these years there has<br />
been a great expansion, under the stimulus especially of t-wo world wars<br />
and a world depression, of the responsibilities borne by this Parliament.<br />
The purpose of the bill is to enlarge both Houses of the Parliament so<br />
that its numbers will be more in keeping with these fundamental<br />
iwtors in our political life.<br />
' 1To function efficiently, a democracy must devise a system of representaslon<br />
of the people in which the diverse views and interests of the<br />
community can find expression. This cannot be achieved if the number<br />
orepresentatives is too small. There is no automatic scale of numbers<br />
of areas for securing the best democratic results. Nevertheless, it is<br />
clear that Australia has altogether outgrown. the small Parliamentary<br />
bodies with which the federation was equipped in 1900. How small<br />
numerically is the Commonwealth Parliament, in comparison with some<br />
of the State legislatures, can be seen from the following figures:<br />
Legislative Legisative<br />
Cnujcl. Assemnbly.<br />
New South Wales 60<br />
Victoria 34<br />
Senate. Representatives.<br />
Commonwealth 36 74<br />
" The Constitution empowers Parliament to increase the size of the<br />
Parliament if it thinks fit, but, : ys down certain conditions which must<br />
b'e observed. The most -important of these conditions is that the number<br />
of members of the House of Representatives must always -be as nearly<br />
as practicable twice the number of senators. If, therefore, the number<br />
of representatives is to be increased there must of necessity be a<br />
correlative increase in the number of senators. Accordingly, this bill<br />
effects an increase of the number of senators, with the appropriate<br />
correlative increase of the number of members of the House.<br />
The bill provides that there shall be ten senators for each State<br />
instead of six. Thus, the total number of senators will be increased<br />
from 36 to 60. Authority for the proposals contained in the ' bill is<br />
provided by the Constitution which sets out that the Parliament may<br />
make laws increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each<br />
State, but so that equal representation of the several original States </p>
<p>shall be maintained, and further, that whenever the number of -senators<br />
lb increased, the Parliament may make such provisions for the vacating<br />
of the places of senators as it deems necessary to maintain regularity<br />
in the rotation.<br />
The Constitution lays down that the number of members of the<br />
House of Representatives shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the<br />
number of senators. Therefore, if the number of senators is in-creased,<br />
as provided in the till now presented, the number of members of the<br />
House of Representatives must be correspondingly raised to a number,<br />
as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators. The actual<br />
number will probably be 121.<br />
Pursuant to the Constitution, and the Representation Act, the<br />
actual increase of the number of members of the House of Representatives<br />
which will follow the passing of this bill will be from 74 to 121.<br />
There will be no change in Tasmania, but in the other States the<br />
numbers will increase as follows-<br />
New South Wales-from 28 to 47.<br />
Victoria-from 20 to 33.<br />
Queensland-from 10 to 18.<br />
South Australia-from 6 to<br />
Western Australia-from 5 to 8.<br />
" Since the establishment of the Commonwealth the population of<br />
Australia has more than doubled. It has increased from 3,765,339<br />
in 1900 to 7,580,820 in 1947. At the 1903 Senate elections 1,893,586<br />
electors were enrolled. To-day the number is 4,780,334, or more than<br />
two and a half times as many. In 1903, in the aggregate there was one<br />
senator for each 52,596 electors. To-day the ratio is one senator for each<br />
132,787 electors. If the number of senators is increased to 60, the<br />
ratio at the next elections will be one senator to each 83,000 electors<br />
approximately, which is less, proportionately, than in 1903.<br />
In 1903, each member of the House of Representatives represented,<br />
on an average, 25,247 electors. To-day, the average is 64,599, whilst<br />
if Tasmania is omitted, and allowance made for the expected rise in<br />
enrolment in the meantime, the average for the mainland divisions<br />
towards the end of this Parliament will be about 69,000 electors. However,<br />
if the number of members of the House of Representatives be<br />
increased. to 121, the average number of electors per member at the<br />
time of the next elections will be reduced to approximately 41,300, or,<br />
omitting Tasmania, 41,680.<br />
" It is proposed to bring the Senate up to the full strength of<br />
senators as from the day of the first meeting of the Parliament after<br />
the next dissolution of the Rouse of Representatives. This will be<br />
necessary in order that membership of the Senate shall, from that date,<br />
be approximately half of that of the House of Representatives as is<br />
provided in the Constitution. Accordingly, the bill provides that apart<br />
from any long casual vacancies that may have to be filled, seven senators<br />
shall be chosen in each State at the next elections. </p>
<p>Four of the new senators elected in each State will take office<br />
as from the date of the first meeting of the Parliament after the<br />
elections, and, according to the order of their election, will continue<br />
in office until 30th June, 1956, or 30th June, 1953. The 4: 2 new<br />
senators, together with the eighteen who will not retire for a further<br />
three -years, will bring the Senate membership up to<br />
" Under the present system, three senators will be elected for the<br />
ordinary six-year period of office which will commence as from 1st<br />
July following; that leaves four more to be elected. At each subsequent<br />
election of senators, five senators will normally be elected in each State,<br />
making 30 to -be elected at each periodical election." [ The bill was passed.<br />

ELECTORAL ACT-PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION,<br />
SENATE, BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.-On 16th April, 1948, Dr. Evatt introduced the<br />
Commonwealth Electoral Bill. Dr. Evatt said-<br />
The purpose of the bill1 is to make provision for the application<br />
of proportional representation to the election of senators. Before<br />
1918, senators were elected by what is termed the first past the post<br />
method. Each voter was required to place a cross in the square opposite<br />
the names of the candidates for whom he desired to vote, the number<br />
of crosses permitted being confined to the exact number of senators to<br />
be elected. Thus where three senators were required the three<br />
candidates with the greatest number of crosses were chosen, and as<br />
was usually the case the three elected were candidates of the same<br />
party. " In 19418, the ' preferential block majority' system was introduced<br />
in respect of Senate elections. This system continued the principle<br />
of the old ' first past the post' system in that under it all seats in a<br />
State generally go to the party, or combination of parties, favoured<br />
at the time by a bare, or simple majority of the electors. It might<br />
he described as the all or none system, either all or none of a party's<br />
candidates being elected. The system used since 1918 may he considered<br />
an improvement on the old system only to the extent that it ensures<br />
majority representation as against possible minority representation.<br />
The great defect, from the representation aspect, of both the<br />
first past the post and the block majority'I system is that at an<br />
election, generally all seats in a State have been won by candidates<br />
of the one party, leaving a minority of between 40 to 50 per cent.<br />
of the electors without any representation at all in the Senate. For<br />
many years there has been a demand that the Parliament should<br />
provide a system of electing senators which would give more equitable<br />
results and enable the electorate to be more truly represented in the </p>
<p>7<br />
Senate. The Government has decided that, in relation to the election<br />
of senators, where each State votes as one electorate, the fairest system<br />
and the one most likely to enhance the status of the Senate is that of<br />
proportional representation.<br />
The bill sets out in detail the method of counting to be adopted<br />
in respect of future elections of senators. The method is generally in<br />
accord with the practice laid down by the Proportional Representation<br />
Society. All I need say about the principle is that the name of the<br />
system indicates the result intended to be achieved, that the electors<br />
will be represented, in the number . of those elected, approximately<br />
proportionately to their expression of opinion. For example, if five<br />
are to be elected and one party's candidates poll 55 per cent. of the<br />
total votes, the result would ' be that that party would have three<br />
candidates elected, and the remaining two elected, assuming that only<br />
two parties contested the poll, would be candidates of the opposing<br />
party and they would represent 40 per cent. of the electors. This<br />
system follows closely the provisions contained in the Proportional<br />
Representation Bill 1912 ( Great Britain) and the system employed in<br />
respect of municipal elections in Britain and South Africa. It is<br />
virtually identical with the method used in the election of the<br />
Parliament of Eire and is similar to the system employed in respect<br />
of parliamentary elections for the New South Wales Legislative<br />
Assembly from 1920 to 1925. In principle, the method proposed is<br />
the same as that used in Tasmania although for reasons of workability<br />
and simplicity it differs slightly in its practical application.<br />
It is not proposed to alter the existing style of Senate ballot-paper<br />
nor the provision that candidates may be grouped thereon with their<br />
names in such order within the group as they desire. Nor is it intended<br />
to vary the requirement that voters must indicate the order of their<br />
preference for all the candidates. Whilst this latter requirement might<br />
have the effect of continuing to produce a fairly high informal vote,<br />
it definitely precludes the possibly greater evil of exhausted votesthat<br />
is, votes which become exhausted in the process of transfer. If<br />
a voter were to indicate his preference for only three of, say, seven<br />
candidates, his vote would be effective up to the number of preferences<br />
shown on his ballot-paper and after that it would be effective nd longe'r.<br />
At that stage, the vote would be said to be exhausted. In Tasmaniaa,<br />
the elector need not vote for all candidates and therefore on occasions<br />
a fairly high percentage of votes becomes exhausted in the process of<br />
transferring the votes of a lower candidate or the surplus of a higher<br />
candidate to the next candidate in order of preference. One result of<br />
a system which does not require the electors to vote for all candidates<br />
whose names appear on the ballot-paper is that a candidate may be<br />
declared elected although the total number of votes credited to hifm<br />
falls, shot of the required quota. At the parliamentary elections in<br />
New South Wales in 1922 and 1925, the exhausted votes, which far<br />
outnumbered the informal votes, were the cause of much dissatisfaction<br />
and disputation.<br />
2565.-3 </p>
<p>" The bill prescribes the manner in which the several vacancies<br />
shall be filled. As hitherto, the count will be carried out under the<br />
direction of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State concerned<br />
in thc offices of the respective Divisional Returning Officers. For<br />
instance, in New South Wales, where there are 47 divisions, there -will<br />
be 47 points at which the count will be carried out. This will ensure<br />
completion of count with the greatest safety, The maximum of speed<br />
and the minimum of cost. When the Commonwealth Electoral Officer<br />
has received the final results of the count of first preference votes from<br />
all returning officers and has totalled them, he will determine a quota<br />
by dividing the total number bf first preference votes by one more<br />
than the number of candidates required to be elected and by increasing<br />
the quotient so obtained by'one. That appears to be complicated, but<br />
if in New South Wales, for example, there were 1,600,00 valid votes<br />
and seven senators had to be elected, the total number would be divided,<br />
not by seven, but by eight, giving a quotient of 200,000. This would<br />
give a quota of 200,000 plus one.<br />
This formula for determining a quota, which, in effect, produces<br />
the lowest number which, when multiplied by the number of candidates<br />
to be elected, leaves a remainder of votes less than that lowest number,<br />
is the one recommended by the Proportional Representation Society<br />
and is used in Tasmania, in Fire, and generally in all places in British<br />
communities where proportional representation has been applied. Any<br />
candidate who, either on the count of the first preference votes or at any<br />
subsequent stage, obtains a number of votes equal to or greater than<br />
the quota shall be elected, and until all vacancies have been filled, the<br />
surplus votes-that is, any number in excess of the quota-of such<br />
elected candidate will be transferred in the manner set out in the bill<br />
to the continuing candidates in strict proportion to. the voters' next<br />
preferences. " The method of disposing of an elected candidate's surplus votes<br />
prescribed in the bill is the one recommended by the Proportional<br />
Representation Society and is precisely the same as that used in Fire<br />
and in municipal'elections in Britain and South Africa, and it is similar<br />
to the method employed in oonnexlon with the parliamentary elections<br />
in New South Wales in the early nineteen-twenties. It differs from the<br />
Tasmanian practice in that whereas in Tasmania all the votes of the<br />
elected candidate are transferred at a fractional value so that every<br />
single paper is looked at under the proposed method only such number<br />
of votes as equals the surplus, taken in strict proportion to the preferences<br />
on the whole of the votes of the elected candidate, are transferred.<br />
No doubt that provision will require some consideration in<br />
committee. It is thought that the Tasmanian system, while suitable<br />
where the number of votes is comparatively small and all such votes<br />
are concentrated at one centre, is not readily capable of being efficiently<br />
worked by too remote a control. Consequently, to employ that system<br />
at a Senate election, it would first be necessary to assemble the whole of </p>
<p>the ballot-papers for the State at one centre. Not only would this delay<br />
completion, involve risks of loss in transit, and increase costs heavily,<br />
but also in the larger States the Commonwealth Electoral Officer would<br />
be faced with the almost insuperable task of securing for a period of<br />
several weeks the extensive accommodation, equipment and staff needed.<br />
" While it might be claimed that the Tasmanian system is mathematically<br />
more exact, tests that have been made reveal that a similar<br />
result is obtained by the employment of the method proposed. As an<br />
illustration, I shall state a hypothetical case in New South Wales and<br />
for this purpose I shall assume for the moment that a Labour candidate<br />
has received 900,000 votes of the total number of 1,600,000. The quota<br />
being 200,000, he has a surplus of 700,000 votes for distribution. This<br />
would usually result in three full quotas being obtained for other candidates<br />
on the list. The proposal embodied in the bill is that the officers<br />
will not look at all of the votes. They will take the surplus available<br />
and will assume that the No. 2 vote, which would be the effective vote<br />
in the first instance, would reproduce a proportion in respect of the<br />
surplus of 700,000 that would be true of the total of 900,000. Tests<br />
have shown that the result would be the same as if all of the 900,000<br />
votes were scrutinized. Questioned as to the likelihood of difference,<br />
eminent mathematicians advised the Proportional Representation<br />
Society of England that-<br />
Whenever a considerable number of votes is in play the element of chance<br />
involved is so small as to be negligible.<br />
" Dealing with the point in its comprehensive report on electoral<br />
systems, the British royal commission of 1908 said-<br />
The chance of the result being affected is too small to be seriously considered.<br />
We agree with the Proportional Representation Society that the additional<br />
labour involved ( in the Tasmanian system) is greater than it is worth.<br />
The bill further provides that if after the count of the first preference<br />
votes or after the transfer of the surplus votes of an elected<br />
candidate at any stage, no candidate or less than the number required<br />
to be elected has or have obtained the quota, then the candidate with<br />
the fewest votes shall be excluded and the whole of his ballot-papers<br />
transferred to the continuing candidates; and if thereupon no candidate<br />
has yet reached the quota, the process of excluding the candidate with<br />
the fewest votes and the transferring of his ballot-papers will continue<br />
until a continuing candidate has received a number of votes equal to<br />
the quota or in respect of the last vacancy a majority of the votes.<br />
Where candidates are elected at the same time, the order of their election<br />
shall be determined to the extent of their surplus votes. The candidate<br />
with the largest surplus shall be the first elected and so on. The same<br />
principle will apply in relation to the transfer of surplus votes. The<br />
largest surplus will be transferred first and so on. If on any count two<br />
or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them has<br />
to be excluded the Commonwealth Electoral Officer shall decide the<br />
candidate to be excluded, or if two or more candidates are elected with<br />
an equal number of votes the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will </p>
<p>decide the order of their election and the transfer of their votes, or if<br />
in the final count for the filling of the last vacancy two candidates have<br />
an equal number of votes, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will<br />
decide which shall be elected but that except as so provided the Coinimonwealth<br />
Electoral Officer shall not vote at the election. That is<br />
really the last resort. The chances against its happening in a Senate<br />
election are enormous.<br />
The result of the system is clear. There will be two major groups<br />
of political parties, and seven senators will be elected, in the absence<br />
of any casual vacancies, in each State. The party which secures 53<br />
per cent. or .55 per cent. of the aggregate votes will, provided the party<br />
ticket is followed, have four of the seven candidates to be returned.<br />
The three remaining seats will be filled by the candidate from the other<br />
party which secured 47 per cent. of the votes. That is certain".<br />

CANBERRA.<br />
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.<br />
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" In ' September, 1947, the Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson)<br />
arranged for a committee consisting of representatives of the Public<br />
Service Board, Departments of the Treasury, Works and Housing and<br />
Interior, to discuss proposals for the future development of Canberra.<br />
Cabinet to-day considered the committee's report and made the following<br />
decisions:-<br />
ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENTS.-The first stage of from one to three years involving<br />
the transfer of 882 officers to Canberra; the second stage of three to five<br />
years involving the transfer of 1,703 officers of the Departments of Repatriation,<br />
Social Services, Labour, Civil Aviation, Transport, Works and jHousing, the<br />
Office of Education, the War Service Land Settlement Division, the Public Relations<br />
Division, and the Re-establishment Division of the Department of Postwar<br />
Reconstruction: the third stage of five to seven years involving 772 officers<br />
of the Postmaster-General's Department, the Meteorological Division of the<br />
Department of the Interior, the Grants Commission and Tariff Board; the fourth<br />
stage of seven to ten years involving 3,670 officers of the Departments of Defence,<br />
Navy, Army, Air, Munitions, Supply and Shipping, Secondary Industries Division<br />
of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction and the Defence Division of<br />
the Treasury.<br />
ADLINISTATIVE BUILDINo.-The question of a second building to house additional<br />
departments to be transferred and to cope with the extension of permanent<br />
departments ( on lines similar to the one already approved) will be considered<br />
by the Cabinet sub-committee appointed to deal with the dispersal of Government<br />
buildings.<br />
CLUB HOUSE.-A Club House to be erected by the Government to cater for the<br />
needs of young male and female officers living in boarding houses and the like.<br />
The club to be run by a committee of the officers. It may be possible to extend<br />
facilities of the club to young persons not employed by the government.<br />
JEBvIS BATY.-Cabinet had already decided that this area should be developed<br />
as a tourist resort and that a short route trunk road between Canberra and<br />
Jervis Bay will be taken up with the New South Wales Government.<br />
NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE AND CIVIC<br />
BRANCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOI:.-T'i'? organization to accelerate<br />
the work of the committee is under consideration. </p>
<p>Civic MANAGEMENT.-An inter-departmental committee considered the constitution<br />
and powers of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council and<br />
the appointment to various boards and committees of non-official persons. If a<br />
suitable person can be found an appointment will be made so that an investigation<br />
could be carried out into the present system of management in Canberra.<br />
MOUNTAIN AND SEASIDE RESORTS AND TOURIST FAOILITIE.-A suitably qualified<br />
person will be obtained to report on this matter and also on the question<br />
of development of facilities to attract tourists.<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF INDUSTRY.-This matter will be referred to the Secondary<br />
Industries Commission for advice."<br />
WAR WITH JAPAN.<br />
OCCUPATION FORCE-COMMITTEE'S INQUIRY.<br />
On 5th April, 1948, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Chambers)<br />
announced that a committee of investigation had been appointed to inquire<br />
into allegations of immorality and black marketing among<br />
British Commonwealth Occupation Forces troops in Japan. The party<br />
included Chaplains-General the Revs. T. McCarthy ( Roman Catholic),<br />
A. H. Stewart ( Presbyterian), A. Brooke ( United Churches), Major-<br />
General C. E. M. Lloyd, and Mr. J. M. Stanley.<br />
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY.<br />
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
In December, 1946, after considering a report on the publishing<br />
industry prepared by the Tariff Board, Cabinet appointed a subcommittee<br />
consisting of the Ministers for Post-war Reconstruction<br />
( Mr. Dedman), Information ( Mr. Calwell) and Health ( Senator<br />
McKenna) to consider and advise on means of assisting this industry<br />
other than those means coming within the province of the Department<br />
of Customs. In March, 1948, a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee, with the<br />
Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice) attending, examined a report<br />
made by an inter-departmental committee on the subject.<br />
" Cabinet decided to-day that a committee comprising the Director<br />
of Education ( Professor R. C. Mills), the National Librarian ( Mr.<br />
H. White) and Mr. A. J. Day of the Department of Commerce, to<br />
investigate and recommend to Cabinet on suitable means of assisting<br />
this industry. The Department of Customs will provide an executive<br />
officer for the committee." WESTERN AUSTRALIA.<br />
WATER . SOHEME.<br />
On the 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that the Commonwealth Government should<br />
provide assistance towards the cost of a scheme to reticulate water to<br />
certain rural areas of Western Australia, to towns along the Great<br />
Southern Railway and to increase the supply to the eastern gold-fields<br />
areas. This proposal has been the subject of representations by the<br />
present and previous Western Australian Governments. </p>
<p>The estimated cost is œ 4,300,000 spread over a six years' period<br />
and the Commonwealth proposes to meet half the capital cost, flue to<br />
shortages of -plant and materials, it may not hbe possible to commence the<br />
work for some time." ANTARCTI CA.<br />
POLAR RESEARCH INSTITUTE.<br />
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
In 1913, the Scott Polar Research Institute was established at<br />
London in memory of the late Captain R. F. Scott to promote polar<br />
research work and -exploration. Recently, the institute asked the<br />
British Treasury for a further grant to increase its income. Cabinet<br />
decided to-day that a grant of œ E500 be made to the institute, continuation<br />
of the grant to be reviewed after a year."<br />
AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITION-PROGRESS.<br />
On 5th April, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
"' Cabinet to-day considered a report on the progress of the Australian<br />
antarctic expedition.<br />
" Cabinet decided that the scientific and meteorological bases successfully<br />
established at Heard and Macquarie Islands in December,<br />
1947, and February, 1948, be maintained in accordance with original<br />
plans. The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) indicated that<br />
the development of a full programme ( including the establishment and<br />
maintenance of a permanent base on the A-ntarctic Continent itself)<br />
would involve the acquisition of a new ship in addition to the vessel<br />
Wyatt . Earp at present being used.<br />
Reviewing the finances of the expedition, Cabinet approved of<br />
an expenditure of œ 327,000 for the current financial year's activities.<br />
This includes the establishment of fixed instalments at Heard and Macquarie<br />
Islands and considerable supplies of technical equipment for<br />
the parties there also for the scientific activities carried out by the<br />
Wyatt Earp. A sum of œ 200,000 h. as been set aside for operations in<br />
1948-49. Cabinet agreed that further consideration should * be given to the<br />
exploitation of sea elephants on Heard and Macquarie Islands if this<br />
should be proved commercially profitable.<br />
" An inter-departmental committee consisting of representatives of<br />
the Departments of the Treasury, Public Service Board, External<br />
Affairs, External Territories, Commerce, and Council for Scientific and<br />
Industrial Research will he set up to make recommendations regarding<br />
future administrative arrangements for Australia's antarctic work."<br />
AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITION-ADM IN ISTRATITON.<br />
On 4th May, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Cabinet to-day adopted the recommendations of an inter-departmental<br />
committee set up to consider an appropriate organization for<br />
the future administration of the Antarctic Expedition. This will be </p>
<p>done by the organization of an Antarctic section within the. Department<br />
of External Affairs which will be temporarily located at Melbourne.<br />
In addition, a committee will be established as an advisory<br />
body to the Department and the Antarctic section on matters connected<br />
with exploration, scientific research, development and the like of the<br />
Antarctic Territory. This committee will replace the existing advisory<br />
commnittee. The facilities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial<br />
Research will be used as much as possible in the planning of scientific<br />
research in the Territory and in the collation and distribution of the<br />
resulting information." RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
WORLD ORGANIZATION-UNITED NATIONS DAY.<br />
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that 24th October be officially proclaimed<br />
United Nations Day'I and appropriate celebrations over the radio and<br />
in the schools -be arranged with the assistance of the Australian National<br />
Committee of the United Nations. The United Nations' flag will be<br />
flown on all Commonwealth buildings and State governments will be<br />
asked to do likewise."<br />
WORLD ORGANIZATION-FREEDOM OF INFORMATION.<br />
On 18th April, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)<br />
said-The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information has<br />
reached important conclusions. It recommends to all countries positive<br />
measures to spread factual information on international affairs and<br />
it condemns all propaganda designed or likely to provoke or encourage<br />
any threat to the peace. Unanimity between the eastern and western<br />
nations of Europe was obtained and this is, in itself, one step forward<br />
in the positive effort to prevent World War III.<br />
The part played by Australia has been notable. Our delegation's<br />
imitiative has been widely and favorably commented on. Australia<br />
succeeded in securing the acceptance of one of the main resolutions.<br />
The chairman of the conference paid a special tribute to Auitralia,<br />
rebuffing the defeatist attitude of a tiny section of Australians who, in<br />
spite of the bitter lessons of the Pacific war, are opposed to the active<br />
participation of their country in international affairs.<br />
One of the greatest contributions to peace which can be made is<br />
to discourage propaganda and distorted reporting, which represents<br />
a real danger in times of international tension. The best way of<br />
preventing war-mongering propaganda is not any form of censorship,<br />
but fair and accurate reporting of the facts. The most effective way<br />
to handle war-mongers is not ' by suppression, but by free reporting.<br />
" This Geneva success, following the General Assembly resolution,<br />
demonstrates that middle Powers like Australia can play a major<br />
role in composing differences between the great Powers, and in helping<br />
to ' prevent the world from crystallizing into rigid and opposing blocs. </p>
<p>14<br />
" It is not enough to criticize war-mongering. Friendly relations<br />
between countries must be encouraged. Positive means of co-operation<br />
and assistance will soon arrest any ' drift towards war."<br />

In Parliament.-On 7th April, 1948, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
( Mr. Menzies) moved the following motion:<br />
That in the opinion of this House<br />
Communist activities in Australia are subversive.<br />
( b Communists in Australia have fomented widespread stoppages of<br />
employment, sought to weaken the authority of the industrial law,<br />
and inflicted misery and loss upon thousands of citizens.<br />
There is good reason to believe that Australian Communists act in<br />
the interests of a foreign power.<br />
Recent events in Europe have p roved that Conmmunist minorities in<br />
counitries outside the Soviet Union are organized so as to overthrow<br />
hy force majority rule in those countries.<br />
The Governnient has failed to take any adequate steps to attack<br />
Communist activities in Australia, or to prevent the employment<br />
of Communists by the Commonwealth.<br />
And that by reason of the above the Government deserves the censure of this<br />
House. Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Mr. Menzies has made what purports to be a denunciation of a<br />
great social evil in this community, but, in a speech of more than<br />
minutes' duration, he did not make one suggestion as to how that evil<br />
should be cured. The press has done him a grave injustice. The press,<br />
for some weeks now, has carried announcements that at last he has </p>
<p>been weaned or forced--I presume forced-from his previous views<br />
in regard to communism. One would, accordingly, have expected him<br />
to-day to have taken the high jump at the suggestion of the Australian<br />
Country party, and plump for the banning of the Communist party;<br />
but he did not do so. In a speech lasting for more than 40 minutes<br />
he did not say one word about banning communism, nor did he make<br />
one single suggestion as to how Communists should be dealt with.<br />
" Unfortunately, a flood of communism has swept Europe. Communism<br />
is rife not only in countries that are under Communist domination<br />
but also in the countries that are still democratic. That is the fruit of<br />
hundreds and hundreds of years in which 80 per cent. of the people<br />
lived in the direst poverty. That is why the world has to suffer<br />
communism to-day. The soil in which communism has flourished was<br />
fertilized by people without any idea of democracy. From one extreme<br />
the people have swung to the other. In most countries there are<br />
Communist elements. Twenty-five years ago the Communists were<br />
supposed to be confined to common people, manual labourers and people<br />
of that character, but to-day communism has become something in the<br />
nature of a religion and has drawn into its ranks many intellectuals.<br />
They are classed as Communists, fellow travellers, and crypto-<br />
Communists by those who see in the movement, as I do, the grave<br />
menace to democracy that communism presents. But the evil will not<br />
be cured or the blight on the world removed by the sort of loose talk<br />
that goes on in Australia and other countries. I cast my mind back<br />
to five years ago, when, as Treasurer, I said to the then Prime Minister,<br />
the late Mr. John Curtin-<br />
War or no war, I believe that every government has to stand up to the task<br />
of ensuring social security to the people, because, if it does not, I fear that,<br />
with the end of the war, the great mass of the people will be gravely dissatisfied<br />
and wonder what the war was fought for if they are left with only poverty and<br />
misery and no security.<br />
" With the help and advice of my colleagues in the Australian<br />
Labour movement, I launched the system of social security that we<br />
enjoy to-day. In the previous 40 years, when for most of the time,<br />
the anti-Labour parties were in power-the Labour party had few<br />
years in office-not one piece of social legislation was passed by the<br />
Australian Parliament. I mention that because the only way in which<br />
to defeat communism is for the democracies of the world to be readily<br />
democratic. " Much has been said about the suppression of minorities. According<br />
to press reports, Mr. Menzies made some rather scathing comments<br />
about my statement that the Australian Labour party would not lend<br />
itself to the banning of a political party, because it held a certain<br />
political philosophy. The Australian Labour party is entirely opposed<br />
to the principles of communism, including its economic theories for<br />
the management of a country, and its attitude towards religion. I<br />
speak for the Government as well as for myself when I say that we<br />
completely abhor the principles of communism for the attainment<br />
of the party's objectives. However, I shall never support any policy </p>
<p>I; 16<br />
which is designed to deprive minorities of the right of expression<br />
unless-I qualify that statement-those expressions are subversive,<br />
seditious or in some way detrimental to the safety of the country.<br />
" I remind opposition members that not one English-speaking<br />
country, with the exception of Canada and Australia in war-time,<br />
has placed a ban on the activities, political or otherwise, of the<br />
Communists.<br />
J " I propose to place on record the statement of the Prime Minister<br />
of Britain ( Mr. Attlee) from the Hansard report of the House of<br />
Commons, dated 15th March, 1948-<br />
1 desire to mnake a statement in regard to certain matters of employment in<br />
the Civil Service.<br />
In answers to questions on the subject of the transfer or dismissal of certain<br />
Government servants, I have said that there are 4certain duties of such secrecy<br />
that the State is not justified in employing in connexion with them any one<br />
whose reliability is in doubt.<br />
Experience, both in this country and elsewhere, has shown that membership<br />
of, and other forms of continuing association with, the Communist party nmkay<br />
involve the acceptance of the individual of a loyalty, which in certain circumstances<br />
can he inimical to the State.<br />
It is not suggested that in matters affecting the security of the State, all<br />
those who adhiere to the Communist party would oallow themselves thus to forget<br />
their primary loyalty to the State. But there is no way of distinguishing such<br />
people from those wvho, if opportunity offered, would he prepared to endanger<br />
the security of the State in the interests of another Power. The Government<br />
has, therefore, reached the conclusion that the only prudent course to adopt is<br />
to ensure that no one who is known to be a member of the Communist party, Or<br />
to be associated with it in such a way as to raise legitimate doubts about his or<br />
her reliability, is employed in connexion with work, the natuie of which is vital<br />
to the security of the State.<br />
Thie same rutle will govern the einploynient of those who are known to be<br />
actively associated with fascist organizations.<br />
I should emphasize that this actioii is being takeii solely on security grounds.<br />
The State is not concerned with the political views, as such, of its servants,<br />
and as far as possible alternative employment on the wide range of non-secret<br />
government work will be found for those who are deemed for the reason indicated<br />
to he unsuitable for secret work. It may, however, happen that it is impossible<br />
to find suitable employment elsewhere in the Civil Service for individuals with<br />
specialist qualifications.<br />
And in such cases there may he no0 alternative to refusal of employment or<br />
dismissal. I do not propose to read all the questions which members of the<br />
House of Commons directed to the Prime Minister in the course of this<br />
statement, but I do desire to read a question by Sir Ian Fraser, whose<br />
loyalty nobody doubts. Sir Ian asked-<br />
In applying the restriction in the Government service, and as far as it affects<br />
the British Broadcasting Corporation and the country generally, will the right<br />
honorable gentlem~ an advise that it shall he kept within the very narrow limits<br />
related strictly to security. Otherwise, does he not think that it is an unaccusturned<br />
and difficult course on which lie may he embarking?<br />
I invite Opposition members to listen carefully to Mr. Attlee's<br />
reply-I think I made it abundantly clear in my statememit that this wvas restricted<br />
to very narrow limits where security matters were of importance.<br />
I have been asked to explain what action the Government is taking<br />
against the Communists. The Government has not waited for this<br />
clamour and for what I may describe as this wave of hysteria which is </p>
<p>17<br />
sweeping through the world and which could lead to the grave consequences<br />
of war, when a little cool-headedness may avoid it. The Government<br />
has always considered that, in mat ' ters involving security, all<br />
persons entering the Public Service should he checked; and all members<br />
of the Public Service, even though they may not have been engaged in<br />
security work, have been subject to close scrutiny. I give to the country<br />
a complete assurance that so far as the Commonwealth Investigation<br />
Service and the State police forces can detect, no person whom Mr.<br />
Attlee's description fits, is engaged in vital security work. The Government<br />
did not wait for the present clamour, which has been raised in<br />
the press, or any other agitation before taking steps to safeguard the<br />
country. " The Australian Labour party is completely opposed to the principles<br />
of communism. Let us he quite honest about this matter and<br />
admit that within the ranks of every political party there are people<br />
out on the wings who are extremely radical in their views. That,<br />
incidentally, is the only reason why there is a Labour party to-day.<br />
There would never have been a Labour party if there had not been in<br />
the community radicals-democratic radicals-who loved their country<br />
and fought for what they believed to be in the interests of the majority<br />
of the people. The men who formed the Australian Labour party had<br />
to contend with the bitterest opposition, with talk of socialism and<br />
the red tiger' 1, and it was even alleged by their opponents that they<br />
advocated the breaking of the marriage tie. However, in the face of<br />
all that opposition they triumphed, and the history of the Parliament,<br />
and particularly that of the last six years, proves that. When this<br />
country was confronted by the gravest peril in its history-and I ask<br />
members of the Opposition to turn this one over in their minds-the<br />
people of Australia entrusted the administration of the country's<br />
affairs, not to a conservative party, but to the Australian Labour party,<br />
which represented the people. If any political party was ever condemned<br />
at the throne of judgment in its country's hour of trial it was<br />
the conservative parties opposite. Tens of thousands of people who had<br />
never voted for a Labour candidate in their lives voted Labour. They<br />
said, in effect, ' In a great crisis these are the only people who can do the<br />
job effectively ', and the people of Australia virtually expressed the<br />
same opinion when they voted at the last general elections.<br />
Members of the political party to which I belong have as much<br />
love for this country and the safety of its people as the members of<br />
any other political party. Opposition members should not think that<br />
they possess a monopoly of love of country. Members, of the Australian<br />
Labour party have always been independent in their regard for the<br />
welfare of the people. We have consistently advocated changes designed<br />
to improve the lot of the mass of the people of this country, and I think<br />
that that is proved by our political record.<br />
" I do not intend to weary the House by reading the text of resolutions<br />
adopted by the federal executive of the Australian Labour party,<br />
but year after year that body has expressed, on behalf of the Labour </p>
<p>18<br />
movement in Australia, its strongest opposition to the Communist<br />
party. As I said previously, it is true that in every political party,<br />
including the Australian Labour party, there are radicals and militants.<br />
However, many of those people are perfectly honest and quite sincere<br />
and have no association with Communists. Opposition members cannot<br />
blame the Australian Labour party for tbat. Behind the Opposition<br />
political parties are objectionable people, people whom Opposition<br />
mlembers would disown and whomn Mr. Menzies would disown. In the<br />
same way there are on the edge of the Australian Labour party men<br />
wvho are quite sincere, but quite radical and militant, and the views<br />
which they express can easily be misinterpreted as expressions of<br />
disloyalty. I have seen a great deal inside the industrial and political Labour<br />
movement, and I have read some history. I have never known of any<br />
minority movement in history that has not grown stronger by repressive<br />
aFction. Let me emphasize this never is liberty more easily lost than<br />
when we think we are defending it. My recollection embraces the<br />
history of quite a few minority movements. Some were religious, some<br />
were political and others were national in aim. Strenuous efforts were<br />
mnade to repress many of then], but in almost every case they grew<br />
stronger by repression. I have said in this House before that the people<br />
wvill not finially accept brutal, repressive action. We can only overcome<br />
communism in one way. Comm unism. can only be beaten by improving<br />
the conditions of the people bad conditions are the soil in which it<br />
thrives. There is talk of gaining political advantage or positions in<br />
Parliament, but to me liberty is far more important than that. I<br />
should not be a member of this Parliament if some tolerance had been<br />
extended to the men who took part in the strike of 1917. All that<br />
harsh oppressive treatment did, as far as I was concerned, was to transform<br />
me, with the assistance of my colleagues, from an ordinary<br />
common engine-driver to the Prime Minister of this country. If an<br />
example of what harshness can do is required, my presence in this<br />
Parliament should be sufficient.<br />
This Government will leave no stone unturned in its efforts to<br />
encourage the trade unions to prevent their control by Communists.<br />
The unions have got to do that themselves it is their task. From the<br />
political and defence point of view, the Government will do everything<br />
possible to provide that neither Communists nor fascists are associated<br />
with the work of ensuring the security of Australia. We shall not<br />
begin to chase shadows. If a ban is imposed on the Communist party,<br />
it will merely change its name, as it did in Canada, and go on in<br />
exactly the same way. We are going to fight Communism in the open.<br />
If there are persons in this country who are seditious, treasonable or<br />
subversive, there are laws by whichi they canl be dealt with, and this<br />
Government wil] deal with them [ T'he motion was defeated. </p>

UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br />
On 7th April, 1948, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway) said<br />
that the demand for labour in Australia reached a new record high<br />
level in February, 1948. Unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service numbered 58,300 for males and 36,800 for females,<br />
the. total of 95,100 being nearly 3,000 greater than the previous record<br />
high level. Unemployment, although practically negligible for months<br />
in. all States, except Queensland, had fallen even further. Recipients. of<br />
unemployment benefit ( including re-employment allowance) numbered<br />
6,410 males and 209 females. During February, 1948, the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service had referred 27,200 males and, 8,100,<br />
females to employers, and had given advice and information on. various<br />
matters to 28,500 males and 6,400 females.<br />

will, in due course, be presented to His Majesty for approval.?"<br />
On 29th April, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
The following appointments have been made to the Commonwealth<br />
staff dealing with the visit of Their Majesties the King. and Queen and<br />
The Princess Margaret to Australia in 1949:<br />
The Reception Officer, Prime Minister's Department ( Mr. J. S.<br />

Minister's Press Secretary ( Mr. D. K. Rodgers)." </p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT.<br />
REOONSTITUTION BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.-On 14th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br />
Chifley) introduced the Supply and Development Bill. Mr. Chifley<br />
said-In Britain, the services essential to the armed forces are provided<br />
by the Ministry of . Supply, and in the ' United ' States by the Munitions<br />
Board. The Australian Government has decided that there must be<br />
a complementary body in the Commonwealth and has re-instituted the<br />
Department of Supply and Development. Under an act of 1939, a<br />
Department of Supply and Development was set up to be concerned with<br />
the procurement and manufacture of supplies and munitions for the<br />
armed services and to develop the resources of the Commonwealth so<br />
that we might be prepared in the event of war. On the outbreak of war<br />
the department was concerned with the procurement of war supplies and<br />
with the production of munitions and aircraft, but a separate Ministry<br />
of Munitions was set up in 1940, and, in 1941, a further Ministry of<br />
Aircraft Production was established. Meanwhile the Department of<br />
Supply was merged in a Department of Supply and Shipping.<br />
With the end of the war, the departments took up an active policy<br />
of reconversion to peace-time conditions in industry and a stage has<br />
now been reached at which they can merge again in a combined Department<br />
of , Supply and Development with functions similar to those which<br />
obtained before the war. The principal change to be made in the act<br />
is the substitution of the expression war materiel for munitions'<br />
wherever the latter occurs. The expression has a much wider meaning<br />
than munitions and is so used in the British and United States<br />
forces. It may be defined as including everything used in war except<br />
the personnel. The intention of the amendment is that the responsibility<br />
for provision of the needs of warfare, except man-power, shall be<br />
placed upon the new department.<br />
The general organization of the department contemplates that<br />
there shall be boards responsible for the management and administration<br />
of the following four main groups of undertakings:-<br />
Munitions production, including arms and ammunition factories; aircraft<br />
production factories; long-range weapons research and experimental establishment;<br />
ship construction and repairs.<br />
There will be branches concerned with procurement of supplies<br />
from industry for the services, including a Contract Board, mineral<br />
resources development, including geophysical and geological surveys,<br />
stores and transport services for the Commonwealth departments, and<br />
scientific research and technical advice for defence purposes and for<br />
assistance to industry generally.<br />
Provision is made in the act to ensure the safety of the public in<br />
connexion with the operations of the long-range weapons range and to<br />
acknowledge the possibility of compensation should accidents unfortunately<br />
happen. Provision is made for secrecy on the part of persons </p>
<p>employed on the operations, and for the steps neccessary to prevent<br />
enitry of unauthorized persons on secret defence undertakings and for<br />
search of suspected persons in such areas, particularly in respect of<br />
dangerous inflammable materials or explosive substances.<br />
" The bill provides for continuity of service in regard to the technical<br />
staff and employees transferred from other departments during<br />
the war or engaged specially under regulations of the National Security<br />
Act, so that such rights and privileges as they may have acquired as<br />
a result of their service under the ! Commonwealth may be continued.<br />
Opportunity is being taken to amend the act so that those salaried<br />
employees formerly exempt from the operation of the Public Service<br />
Act will be transferred to the Commonwealth Public Service and be<br />
governed by the Public Service Act." [ The bill was passed.<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br />
RABBIT SKINS-EXPORT LEVY.<br />
On 15th April, 1948, the Minister for rCommerce ( Mr. Pollard)<br />
announced that the exemption of rabbit skins shipments from export<br />
levy would be continued until 31st May, 1948. The exemption was<br />
due to expire on 30th April, 1948.<br />

PRICES.<br />
GOODS " DECLARED "-LAMB, REVOCATION.<br />
On 16th April, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)<br />
announced that lamb would be removed from price control from 19th<br />
April, 1948. The good season with the prospect of another wool clip<br />
at a high price had encouraged graziers to hold stock, with the result<br />
that a shortage of lamb could be expected during the coming winter.<br />
Although there would be no general shortage of meat the shortage of<br />
lamb created conditions favorable to the blackmarketer against<br />
whose competition reputable traders could not carry on except at a<br />
heavy loss. NEW ZEALAND.<br />
VISIT OF NEW ZEALAND GOVERNOR-GENERAL.<br />
On 19th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General ( Mr. McKell), on behalf<br />
of the Commonwealth Government, extended an invitation to the<br />
Governor-General of New Zealand ( Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard<br />
Freyberg) and Lady Freyberg to pay a visit to Australia. Their<br />
Excellencies have accepted the invitation and propose to arrive in<br />
Auztralia some time in November, 1948." </p>
<p>DEFENCE.<br />
COUNCIL OF DEFENCE-MEETING.<br />
On 20th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
At the meeting of the Council of Defence to-day, the normal<br />
review of the basis of Australian post-war defence policy was made<br />
before the council proceeded to the detailed discussion of other subjects.<br />
Among the items dealt with were the foll-owing:<br />
Consideration was given to matters relating to the scientific<br />
aspect of defence policy arising from the conclusions and recommendations<br />
of the 1947 meeting at London of the British Commonwealth<br />
Advisory Committee on Defence Science and from the first<br />
report of the Defence Scientific Advisory Committee.<br />
The progress of the joint United Kingdom-Australian long range<br />
weapons project was considered.<br />
Decisions were taken on the organization for the executive of<br />
defence research and development.<br />
" Another meeting of the council will be held next week at which<br />
the progress of the defence programme will be reviewed, following<br />
which a statement will be made by the Minister for Defence ( Mr.<br />
Dedman) in Parliament." TRADE MARKS.<br />
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.<br />
On 20th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) reported to Cabinet to-day<br />
that a licence by a proprietor of a trade mark to another to use the<br />
trade mark on goods other than those of the proprietor of the trade<br />
mark is a form of deception which invalidates the registration of the<br />
mark. This rule applies when the proprietor of a mark owns and<br />
controls the other party to whom the licence is given. Consequently,<br />
a parent company cannot license a subsidiary company. In Britain,<br />
legislation has been passed whereby a person, other than a proprietor<br />
of a trade mark may be registered as a registered user of the mark.<br />
Conditions of registration are laid down and provision is made against<br />
I trafficking." Cabinet decided to-day that the Trade Marks Act should be amended<br />
along the lines of the British Act to provide for permitted users of<br />
trade marks and assignment of trade marks without assignment of<br />
goodwill. It has been pointed out that many Australian companies<br />
have subsidiary companies operating in different States, and if any of<br />
these separate legal entities uses the registered trade mark of the<br />
parent company the registration of the mark is invalidated. Further,<br />
many overseas manufacturers desire to make arrangements with Australian<br />
companies for the local manufacture of goods formierly manufactured<br />
overseas and sold under well-known trade marks. The<br />
proposed amendment of the act will help in the industrial development<br />
of Australia and the establishment of new industries." </p>

INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.<br />
BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament On 22nd April, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture<br />
( Mr. Pollard) introduced the International Wheat Agreement Bill.<br />
Mr. Pollard said-<br />
The object of this bill is to ratify the international wheat agreement<br />
drawn up in Washington in March, 1948, by the representatives<br />
of the governments of 36 countries. The agreement is subject to<br />
ratification, or formal acceptance, by the governments concerned by<br />
1st July, 1948.<br />
" At the outbreak of war in September, 1939, the f. o. b. Australian<br />
export price of wheat was around 2s. Australian currency a bushel.<br />
Some transactions took place at about is. 10d. a bushel at this time.<br />
Two years previously the average f. o. b. price was around 5s., Australian<br />
currency. For some years into the war, accumulated supplies and<br />
harvests were such that prices rose very slowly. At the end of 1943<br />
the Australian Wheat Board's export price was 4s. lid. bulk,<br />
for sales west of Suez and 4s. 7td. for sales east of Suez. At the close<br />
of the recent war there was a world-wide food shortage. There was<br />
a delay in getting European wheat countries back into production.<br />
Prices obtainable by exporters rose to record heights until in November,<br />
1947, the price on the Chicago market for the shortest term futures<br />
rose to 3 dollars 20 cents, the export equivalent for shipments from<br />
Gulf of Mexico ports being 3 dollars 30 cents, or 20s. 9d. Australian.<br />
At this time and for some weeks afterwards Australia was obtaining<br />
19s. 6d. a bushel for its wheat. Later, the Australian Wheat Board<br />
increased its price to 20s. 6d. a bushel.<br />
It is difficult to say precisely what world prices are, and it is clear<br />
that there is no world price in the pre-war sense. In normal times,<br />
wheat was traded freely at exchanges in Winnipeg, Liverpool, the<br />
Baltic, in London, and at Chicago and Minneapolis. Now Liverpool<br />
and Winnipeg are closed, and Chicago and Minneapolis deal largely<br />
with the huge American domestic consumption-a figure exceeding the<br />
Canadian and Australian production put together. At the end of<br />
January, 1948, when negotiations for the agreement opened, Canada<br />
had a contract, entered into in 1946, to sell a substantial proportion of<br />
its exportable surplus to Britain up to the end of July, 1950. The<br />
price for deliveries during the year, 1st August, 19-17, to 31st July,<br />
1948, was fixed at 1.55 dollars or 9s. 8d. Australian a bushel in store<br />
Fort William/ Port Arthur. For deliveries during 1948-49, the price<br />
is to be 2 dollars or 12s. 5d. Australian a bushel. In January, Canada<br />
was selling to other countries at prices around 3.25 dollars-about<br />
œ 1 Australian-a bushel, which were comparable with the United States<br />
export price. Australia had negotiated contracts with Britain and<br />
India for the sale of 105,000,000 bushels, at prices of 17s., equivalent<br />
to about 2.7 dollars a bushel, in the case of Britain and of 18s. 6d.,<br />
equivalent to about 3 dollars a bushel, in the case of India. The </p>
<p>' Wheat Board's export price at the end of January was 20s. 6d. a bushel.<br />
The Argentine was selling at about 5 dollars or over 30s. a bushel.<br />
With all these varying prices, and with so little wheat being sold<br />
on a freemarket, it is clearly unsound to refer to a ' world price<br />
" A world price of course means competition between suppliers.<br />
Now no competition exists. Where there is competition it must be<br />
expressed in comparable * prices in the buying markets, whether these<br />
prices are brought back to f. o. b. for quotation or left c. i. f. Where a<br />
supplying country, Australia is an example, has one f. o. b. quote for all<br />
countries it is evident that there is no world price, since it means that<br />
each country is paying a different landed price for Australian wheat<br />
because of the difference in cost of freight. The Chicago market has<br />
been assumed by some to give world prices, but it is clear that this is<br />
not so when Argentina can obtain prices much higher than the export<br />
equivalent of the Chicago price. However, it can be said on the following<br />
reasoning that Chicago prices give a good indication of the trend of<br />
the market. Chicago prices, in the mnain, over a period are influenced<br />
by the quantity of wheat the United States Government takes off the<br />
domestic market. If a slackening in demand on American export wheat<br />
reduces pressure on Chicago, prices fall there and American wheat for<br />
export falls correspondingly. As soon as there is sufficient whea~ t<br />
coming from other countries to cause an exporter to offer wheat in the<br />
same market as America, competition will arise. A world price will<br />
then he quotable, and in the different supplying countries quotes will<br />
be based on competitive landed prices in importing countries.<br />
" Following an exchange of views between their govern-ments,<br />
officials of Argentina, Australia, Canada, the United States and<br />
Britain met in Washington in July, 1941. A preliminary report was<br />
submitted in August, 1941, in which the principles of acreage control,<br />
price ranges and export quotas were again put forward. The Governmnents<br />
agreed that their representatives should meet again to work over<br />
the details of the proposed agreement. The conference was resumed in<br />
October, 1941, and met at various dates up to April, 1942, when a<br />
memorandum of agreement, to which was attached a draft convention,<br />
was drawn up and accepted by the Governments of Australia, Argentina,<br />
Canada, the United States and Britain. This memorandum indicated<br />
agreement among the four principal exporters on quotas. On the basis<br />
ef aggregate exports of 500,000,000 bushels, the percentages were,<br />
Canada 40 px_ nt., Argentina 25 per cent., Australia 19 per cent.,<br />
and United States 16 per cent.<br />
From 1943 to 1946, frequent attempts were made to reach an<br />
agreemient on price ranges for incorporation in an agreement for the<br />
stabilization of trade during the war and early post-war years. The<br />
stumbling block was a'lways the price ranges, Britain being unable to<br />
mneet the views of the exporters. By 1943, the Australian Wheat Board<br />
was in existence. It was constantly consulted by the department on<br />
details. </p>
<p>' I 26<br />
" At the conference in London in March, 1947, it was made clear<br />
that Argentina would not be a participant, and a new approach was<br />
attempted, the new feature introduced -being guarantees by individual<br />
importers to take specified-quantities. Though agreement was not<br />
reacahed on all details, the principles stated in 1947 were used as the<br />
basis of negotiations at the recent conference in Washington at which<br />
full agreement was reached.<br />
" The quantity of wheat covered by the agreement is 500,000,000<br />
bushels, of which. Australia's share is 85,000,000. Australia is bound to<br />
supply this quantity if it possibly can. If it cannot provide 85,000,0%,<br />
bushels, the United States anid Canada wvill be first asked to make up the<br />
discrepancy. If they cannot do so, then Australia is released from: its<br />
obligations, provided that its failure is due to crop losses and is not due,<br />
for example, to having made large sales outside the agreement. If<br />
Australia has more than 85,000,000 bushels to sell, it may sell-additional<br />
wheat outside the agreement, either to countries not in the agreement,<br />
or by making increased sales to countries within the agreement. From<br />
conversations not yet on a formal -basis, it is apparent that Britain<br />
together with the colonies for which Britain has assumed responsibility<br />
in thc agreement, will require more than the quantity provided for it in<br />
the agreement-180,000,000 bushels. Some of this extra quantity will<br />
certainly be drawn from Australia outside the agreement.<br />
The 85,000,000 bushels is considered to be adequate. In fact, it<br />
was not considered that Australia would be justified, under the terms: of<br />
the agreement, in seeking a higher -figure. It is estimated that. this will<br />
require an average harvest over the five years of about 170,000,000<br />
bushels, and that an average of .180,000,000 bushels would not be an<br />
embarrassment. In the first year of the agreement it is certain that<br />
we will be able to sell all our excess over the 85,000,000, and it is<br />
almost certain that we shall do so in the second year-August, 1949, to<br />
July, 1950-and that we shall enter into the third year of the agreement<br />
with a low carry-over. Even with heavy harvests, therefore, some<br />
increase of carry-over in the later years of the agreement could be<br />
accepted without difficulty.<br />
" No provision is made in the agreement for restriction of production,<br />
but if supplying countries produced more than their quota, and<br />
other quantities they could sell outside the agreement, they might be<br />
forced to limit output. However, it should not be necessary for Australia<br />
to contemplate restriction of production during the course of the<br />
agreement. " In selecting a price range many bases were considered,' but rather<br />
early in the negotiations-in 1941-42, in fact-Canadian sales were<br />
adopted as a basis, with equivalents to be worked out for Australian<br />
and United States sales. Although this basis was reviewed at different<br />
times, it was ultimately adopted. The views of Australia in regard to<br />
the treatment of sales to ' nearly markets were accepted and given<br />
effect in the formula set out ini the agreement. This formula means, in </p>
<p>A. i? 27<br />
effect, that in. sales for delivery to Britain when prices are at the top of<br />
Sthe range, Australia will charge the same c. i. f. as Canada, subject to<br />
any agreement for a difference on account of quality between Canadian<br />
and Australian wheat. As freight between Australia and Britain is<br />
greater than that between Canada and Britain, on the same c. i. f. price<br />
Australia would get a lower f. o. b. return than Canada.. On present<br />
freights, Canada would receive the maximum of 2 dollars or 12s.<br />
Australian, and Australia would receive 12s. The same price would<br />
apply to such European countries as Holland, Belgium and France.<br />
We might call this category A.<br />
" In the case of India, and the British purchases for delivery to<br />
Ceylon and Malaya, the Canadian c. i. f. price would be much higher<br />
than the Australian consequently, when the Canadian f. o. b.<br />
equivalent was the basic price of 2 dollars ( 12s. the Australian<br />
f. o. b. equivalent would be much higher-perhaps 14s. 5d. In this case,<br />
under the agreed formula, Australia will charge 12s. 5d., the basic f. o. b.<br />
maximum. Canada cannot compete in these ' nearby markets' because<br />
its c. i. f. quote would be much higher than the c. i. f. equivalent of<br />
Australia's 12s, 5d. Thus, in; sales to these countries Australia's maximum<br />
f. o. b. price will be a straight conversion from the Canadian fLo. b.<br />
to the same figure in Australian currency. This group of countries<br />
might be called category B.<br />
It follows that, over the whole of our exports, the return Australia<br />
will get on exports under the agreement will depend on the proportion of<br />
category A to category B. A fair estimate is one -third A and two-third<br />
B. On present freight charges and rates of exchange, this would give<br />
12s. 3d. as an equivalent of the 2 dollars. If a quality differential of,<br />
say, 6d. were agreed to in the case of sales to Britain-there will -be no<br />
quality differential for sales to nearby countries-the average would be<br />
about 12s. In the case of the minimum, much the same principles will<br />
apply, although in certain circumstances the Australian f. o. b. price<br />
for sales to ' nearby markets' would come down to the minimum f. o. b.<br />
price for sales to Britain.<br />
" In the case of markets equidistant from Canada and Australia-<br />
Shanghai for example, when Canada is shipping out of Vancouver-it<br />
would be necessary for us to be able t&amp; come down to such a price in<br />
order to compete with Canada on a c. i. f. basis in those markets. However,<br />
where countries such as India, New Zealand, Java, Ceylon and<br />
Malaya want wheat, or flour, they will naturally come to Australia for<br />
it and pay the Canadian f. o. b. prices-converted, of course, to Australian<br />
currency. Here, again, the actual minimum return overall<br />
would depend on the proportions of the 85,000,000 bushels that go to the<br />
different destinations. A fair estimate would be that, if prices fel<br />
heavily and reached the minimum of 1 dollar 20 cents throughout the<br />
fourth year, the average return would be about 7s., and that, if they<br />
went to the minimum of I dollar 10 cents in the fifth year, the average<br />
return would be about 6s. 4d. The calculations which have been used in<br />
arriving at these figures are conservative. ' I<br />
9! </p>
<p>28<br />
" Alterations of freight rates would affect sales in category A. If'<br />
freights fell, our f. o. b. return would increase. If they rose, the reverse<br />
would be the case. Alterations in exchange would also affect these<br />
equivalents if such alterations affected the relationship between Australian<br />
currency and the Canadian dollar. A special clause in the<br />
agreement provides that, if the Canadian dollar depreciates on the<br />
American dollar, there will be no change in the basic prices.<br />
" There is no commitment under the agreement that wheat shall -bepreferred<br />
to flour. In practice, Australian mills should be able to sell<br />
their full output. The British allotment under the agreement covers<br />
flour for Britain, Ceylon, Malaya and British commitments in respect<br />
of other colonies. The Netherlands quota inceludes flour for the Netherlands<br />
East Indies. These, with the requirements of the Pacific Islands,<br />
should keep our mills going.<br />
" It is true, of course, that in the first year Australian growers will<br />
make a monetary sacrifice; they will receive less under the agreemient<br />
than if there were no agreemeut. This position might obtain also in<br />
the second year. It could even continue further. As time goes on,<br />
however, the risks the grower takes with no assured minimum become.<br />
greater. When the slump comes-and all close observers say it will<br />
come sooner or later-the consumer will be the loser and the producer<br />
will gain. But no one can say what the severity or duration of the<br />
slump will be. Summed up, the agreement seems to strike a fair balance<br />
between the early contributions of the producer and the later contributions<br />
of the consumer. However, with heavy crops in all wheat<br />
countries, it could be a real boon to the producer. To my mind, its real<br />
service to the Australian wheat-grower is that it gives him security.<br />
While enjoying good returns, he may look forward for five years-I<br />
personally hope the agreement will be reniewed long before the expiration<br />
of five years-with onlfidence-confidence that he will not have to<br />
face disastrous price falls such as the wheat-growers of Australia have<br />
experienced in past years." [ The bill wuas passed.<br />

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.<br />
AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.<br />
In Parliament.-On 26th April, 1948, the Minister for the Navy<br />
( Mr. Riord an) said-<br />
The overall plan announced by the Minister for Defence ( Mr.<br />
Dedman) on 4th June, 1947, envisaged the purchase by Australia of<br />
two aircraft carriers. The first of these ships will be commissioned in<br />
October, 1948, and will arrive in Australia early in 1949. The captain<br />
and some of the senior officers have already left Australia for England,<br />
where they arc doing certain courses. The remainder of the crew of<br />
600 will leave Australia in May, 1948, on Kanimbla, and will undergo<br />
certain training before the ship is commissioned. </p>
<p>29<br />
The Government still intends to Purchase the second aircraft car-<br />
7-ier, which should be commissioned towards the end of 1949 or in 1950.<br />
The reason why I cannot give any definite date at the moment is that<br />
-the Australian Government is endeavouring to have these aircraft carriers<br />
so constructed that they will be modern at the moment when they<br />
are commissioned. That is one of the reasons why the first aircraft<br />
carrier will not be commissioned on 24th June, 1948, as was first<br />
thought possible. I am not able to give the date or even the month<br />
when the second aircraft cardier will be commissioned, because modern<br />
improvements are being effected while the ship is being constructed.<br />
As to whether the armament will be obsolete, it was only recently<br />
that an order was placed for the purchase of aircraft. The reason for<br />
the delay was that the Australian Government wanted to be certain that<br />
these ships would be equipped with the most efficient and up-to-date<br />
aircraft available for service on a carrier. Jet-propelled aircraft may<br />
be issued to the American navy some time this year. We are now<br />
examining whether it is possible, even by a delay of a few months, to<br />
secure jet-propelled aircraft for the two ships."<br />

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.<br />
RESERVE.<br />
On 27th April, 1948, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford)<br />
. announccd conditions of the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve as<br />
follows: PERMANENT AIR FORCE RESERVE ( OR ACTIVE RESERVE).<br />
To conmprise personnel immediately available for mobilization in an emergency<br />
to bring existing unite to war strength * and to man additional units<br />
required on the outbreak of war.<br />
To be established, in the first instance, from personnel who have served dur-<br />
Ing World War 11. and able and willing to undertake such annual or periodic<br />
training as the Royal Australian Air Force might, from time to time, require.<br />
In the initial stages, training to be confined to alectures, films, and distribution<br />
of training pamphlets to be made available at centres. Subsequently, the reserve<br />
to be maintained primarily from personnel completing engagements in the permanent<br />
and citizen forces.<br />
Conditions of service to be engagement for five years and further re-engagements<br />
each of five years; applicants to volunteer for service andi be accepted<br />
for enlistment in the reserve, to possess honorable discharges; to be medically<br />
fit; and to report annually, notifying addresses or change of addresses, and<br />
other particulars required.<br />
Personnel appointed to the reservc to be appointed in the temporary rank<br />
previously held.<br />
Retirement from the reserve to be governed by the same retiring ages as<br />
applicable to the permanent air force. 0<br />
CITIZEN AIR FORCE RESERVE.<br />
To consist of personnel possessing qualifications required for service in the<br />
various branches of a modern air force.<br />
To be constituted initially from trained personnel, including the Royal Australian<br />
Air Force Nursing Service and the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air<br />
Force who served. during World War II.<br />
To be maintained partly fromi personnel trained in the active citizen air<br />
force, and partly from persons in civil life possessing qualifications required<br />
by the service. </p>
<p>Personnel not to be obliged to undertake any form of annual training butto<br />
be required to give an undertaking that, in the event of a national emergency,<br />
their services to be readily available to the Royal Australian Air Force..<br />
Conditions Of service to be: Volunteers with previous service to be entered<br />
It in their last substantive or higaher temporary rank; no time qualification in<br />
I regard-to service, and personnel might withdraw on giving due notice; personnel<br />
to be retired at the equivalent retiring ages for the p~ rmanent force;<br />
persons desiring to enrol must undertake to report for duty when called on<br />
in an emergency.<br />
H AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.<br />
DIRIECTOR-GENERAL OF MEDICAL SERVICES.<br />
On 28th April, 1948, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Chambers)<br />
announced that Dr. F. K. Norris had been appointed Director-General<br />
of Medical Services. MIGRATION.<br />
GOVERNMENT POLICY-BRITISH MIGRANTS.<br />
On 29th April, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Caiwell)<br />
said-The ' open door' of Australia is no empty phrase when applied to<br />
our kinsfolk from the British Isles. The Oovernment and the people<br />
of Australia are determined to preserve the predominantly British<br />
character of the Australian nation -by insisting that the highest possible<br />
proportion of our population gain through immigration should be from<br />
Britain. Australia's immigration figures for 1947 show that the number<br />
of Britishers who came to Australia was twenty times as great as that<br />
from the next highest source ( America), and three times as great as<br />
that from all other world sources put together. Of 31,950 new arrivals<br />
in 1947, Australia received 23,499 from Britain, 1,137 from the United<br />
States, 843 from displaced persons camps in Europe, and 6,471 from<br />
all other sources. This three to one overall ratio in favour of British<br />
migrants will be maintained.<br />
Would-be migrants in Britain may be assured that, wherever the<br />
Australian Government has any influence in the allocation of berths on<br />
ships ailing from Britain, no foreign national will be granted a passage<br />
at the expense of a waiting Britisher. No ships that can be obtained<br />
by the Australian Government will be allocated to the carriage of<br />
non-British migrants while British migrants await transport."<br />
RUSSIA.<br />
EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS.<br />
On 30th April, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)<br />
announced that the first Soviet Ambassador to Australia would be<br />
Mr. N. M. ifanov and the first Australian Ambassador to Russia<br />
would be Mr. A. Watt. The appointments wvere in accordance with </p>
<p>the recent mutual agreement between the Australian and Soviet Governments<br />
to raise the status of their legations at Canberra and Moscow<br />
to that of embassies.<br />
Similar exchanges had been agreed to with France and China and<br />
when those appointments were completed, Australia would be represented<br />
on an ambassadorial level in the countries of all permanent<br />
members of the United Nations Security Council.<br />
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS.<br />
PROPOSED CONFERENCE.<br />
In Parliament.-On 30th April, 1948, the Prime -Minister ( Mr.<br />
Chifley) said-<br />
No suggestion, either official or unofficial, has been made that a<br />
conference of Empire Prime Ministers should be held. I realize, of<br />
course, that on the economic side a very grave position has developed.<br />
I realize how delicate is the position, and that it affects not only<br />
Britain but ourselves and other countries with which Britain is associated.<br />
It may be necessary for me or some other Minister conversant<br />
with the economic aspects of the affairs of the Empire to visit London;<br />
but no suggestion has yet * been received that such a visit should be<br />
arranged.'' ( ror earlier reference, please see No. 134, page<br />

On 2nd May, 1948, the ' Minister for Health ( Senator Mc~ enna)<br />
broadcast over the national network. Senator McKenna said-<br />
" In 1947, the Government repealed acts of 1944 * and 1945, and<br />
passed an entirely new act to enable pharmaceutical benefits to be<br />
provided. Since then the Government has concluded discussions with<br />
the Federal Council of the British Medical Association, the Federated<br />
Pharmaceutical Service Guild, the Friendly Societies Dispensaries and<br />
nearly all States.<br />
Administrative arrangements bave been completed and regulations<br />
under the act will come into force within the next few days. The<br />
scheme will come into operation on 1st June, 1948.<br />
The ' benefits are listed in the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical<br />
formulary which will be published in book form. The Government<br />
had at its disposal in the preparation of the formulary the best specialist<br />
advice from the medical, pharmaceutical and pharmacological fields.<br />
The benefits in-clude such modern drugs as those of the ' sulpha' group,<br />
preparations of penicillin, vaccines, serums, anti-toxins and other<br />
biological products such as insulin, The range of medication covered<br />
by the. formulary includes preparations. nder more than 40 headings<br />
ranging from ear, eye and nose drops to, children's requirements, </p>
<p>32<br />
vit-amin solutions and sundry medical materials and applications..<br />
Altogether, about 600 items are listed in formulary, but this gives<br />
no idea of its scope since provision has been made for ingredients of<br />
formulae to be omitted, reduced and in some cases increased. Provision<br />
has been-made for certain drugs to be added to mixtures and.<br />
other preparations. These provisions give great flexibility to the<br />
formulary and permit of so many variations as to extend its range to.<br />
hundreds of thousands of prescriptions.<br />
" These benefits can be made available only on ' a prescription<br />
written by a registered medical practitioner. The Government feels<br />
that, having regard to the high standards of the medical profession,.<br />
the risk of unnecessary prescribing is negligible. This arrangement<br />
will provide a safeguard against unnecessary demands from patients,.<br />
since they must consult their doctors as a preliminary to receipt of<br />
pharmaceutical benefits.<br />
There is no compulsion of any kind upon a doctor to co-operate<br />
in the scheme. ' When a doctor does take part he is not bound in any<br />
way to confine his prescribing to the formulary. If there should be<br />
some particular drug or compound which he considers more appropriate<br />
to, his patient's need than any contained in the formulary then he<br />
will of course prescribe it, but in that case the patient himself must<br />
pay for the prescription, the Government accepting full responsibility<br />
for its omission from the formulary.<br />
After a doctor has studied the contents of the formulary and its<br />
flexibility I am sure that his decision regarding co-operation in the<br />
scheme will be determined by his medical judgment, his humanity<br />
and his good citzenship, and by no other consideration.<br />
The act provides for the establishment of a formulary committee.<br />
Its function will be to advise on the revision of the formuilary in the<br />
light of experience, and of the latest developments in medical science.<br />
The Government provided in the 1947 act, at the request of the Federal<br />
Council of the British Medical Association, that the personnel of this<br />
committee should be predominantly medical in character. This constitutes<br />
one of the important points of difference between the original<br />
scheme and the one now about to be launched.<br />
" A second point of difference lies in the fact that whereas in the.<br />
1944 scheme a penalty in the form of a fine, in default three months"<br />
imprisonment, was imposed for doctors who prescribed unnecessarily,<br />
this provision was wholly omitted from the 1947 act. This was done<br />
at the request of the Federal Council of the British Medical Association.<br />
The regulations embody a code specifying what constitutes proper<br />
prescribing., This is based on a code submitted by the council. No<br />
penalty or sanction whatsoever for -breach of the code has been provided.<br />
The Government places its trust in the honour of the profession to<br />
observe the code and has intimated to the council that should theconduct<br />
of some few medical practitioners demonstrate the need for<br />
something of that nature it wvill consult the council as to the form of'<br />
sanction that would be appropriate. </p>
<p>33<br />
" The patient's part in the scheme is very simple. Where his<br />
-doctor prescribes a pharmaceutical benefit he will hand the prescriptionto<br />
the patient in duplicate. The patient will then take the prescription<br />
to any approved chemist or approved friendly society dispensary. He<br />
will hand both copies -of the prescription to the pharmacist who will<br />
supply the benefit without charge to the patient. ' Where the doctor has<br />
ordered a prescription to be repeated, the patient will still hand both<br />
copies of the prescription to the pharmacist who, in addition to supplying<br />
the benefit will hand to him a repeat authorization form with the<br />
duplicate of the prescription; these documents will enable him to<br />
secure a repeat supply of the benefit from any -approved pharmacist.<br />
" In chronic cases, for instance in the case of diabetics who are in<br />
constant need of insulin, a doctor may, at one consultation, prescribe a<br />
supply that will be adequate for up to 91 da~ a.<br />
Special provision has also been made to meet the plight of persons<br />
living in outback areas beyond the reach of the dispensing doctor or<br />
chemist. " A doctor may prescribe a benefit without a Commonwealth form<br />
in any case of emergency -but is required to supply the prescription<br />
on -a proper form at a later date to enable the chemist supplying the<br />
benefit to collect payment from the Commonwealth.<br />
" Where a chemist is asked to d * ispense a prescription after usual<br />
trading hours he is entitled to payement from the patient of a late<br />
fee of is. In the case of a prescription endorsed by a doctor as urgent'I<br />
the chemist is obliged to supply the benefit as soon as practicable<br />
provided the prescription is presented at the premises of the approved<br />
* chemist. Should it be necessary for the chemist to deliver any pharmaceutical<br />
benefit he may make a charge equal to the actual cost of the<br />
delivery. There is a prohibition against any doctor, chemist or hospital<br />
dispenser parting with possession of or destroying any of the official<br />
forms or publications issued to him except in accordance with the act.<br />
As these documents are the basis of entitlement to receipt of and<br />
payment for costly and dangerous drugs, this provision is essential for<br />
the security of the community and for the proper protection of Commonwealth<br />
funds.<br />
All medicines needed by a patient occupying a public' bed in a<br />
public ward are already provided for under the Commonwealth Hospital<br />
Benefits Scheme and do not come within the ambit of the act.<br />
Provision is being made by arrangement with the various States so<br />
that out-patients will receive pharmaceutical benefits without cha rge<br />
when the scheme comes into operation. Special arrangements will be<br />
made to meet the needs of patients in private hospitals or in inter-<br />
-mediate and private wards of public hospitals. These arrangements<br />
will vary according to whether the hospital has or has not a pharmacist<br />
on its premises."~ </p>

On 4th May, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" Cabinet to-day decided that the Australian Broadcasting Commission<br />
be authorized to spend, during the three months ending September<br />
1948, an amount equivalent to an amount on the same basis as<br />
during the current financial year plus such inescapable expenditure as<br />
would enable the Commission to meet additional costs to which it is<br />

WAR SERVICE MORATORIUM-EXTENSION.<br />
On 4th May, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" A discharged member of the forces remains a ' protected person'<br />
for three years after being discharged or ceasing to -be engaged on war<br />
service. The protection of female dependants and parents of discharged<br />
members of the forces also exists for a similar period of three years.<br />
The period was originally six months but was increased from time to<br />
time so that it is now three years.. In many cases the three years'<br />
period from discharge has recently expired or will expire in the near<br />
future, and, unless the period is extended, there may be a considerable<br />
number of evictions of ex-servicemen.<br />
" The Re-establishment and Employment Act provides that land<br />
owned by a member of the forces shall not be required compulsorily<br />
without the prior consent of the Attorney-General. The Act provided<br />
that the protection afforded should continue for a period of twelve<br />
months after the date of discharge of the number or the period of the<br />
length of the member's service whichever was the shorter period. As a<br />
result of representations made last year by various organizations of<br />
ex-servicemen, the period of twelve months was extended to two years,<br />
so that ex-servi-cemen might not be deprived of land on which they<br />
L_ 2 </p>
<p>hoped to , build homes. In view of the present building difficulties, the<br />
Direetor , of the Legal Service Bureau has expressed the opinion that it<br />
is desirable to extend the period of protection . from two years to three<br />
years. Representations have also been made by organizations of exservicemen<br />
to the same effect.<br />
Cabinet to-day decided that the period of protection under the<br />
War Service Moratorium Regulations to discharged members of the<br />
forces and -their dependants be extended from three years to four years;<br />
and that the period of protection under the Re-establishment and<br />
Employment Act to discharged members of the Forces be extended from<br />
two years to four years." SERVICE -PAY RATES.<br />
PERMANENT FORCES-RETIREMENT SCHEME, BILL<br />
INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.--On 5th . May, 1948, the Minister for Defence :( Mr.<br />
D. edman) introduced the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Bill. Mr.<br />
Dedman said-<br />
The bill proposes to establish a scheme for improved retirement<br />
benefits on a uniform basis for members of the Permanent Defence<br />
Forces. The existing provisions for retirement benefits -are deficient.<br />
In particular, they lack uniformity as between the three services. ' This<br />
is no longer justifiable since comparable standards of pay and -service<br />
conditions have been provided for all three services. Moreover, it<br />
would be impossible under the existing retirement provision to deal<br />
adequately with the peculiarly difficult problem created by the practice,<br />
now common to all services, of retirement at comparatively early ages.<br />
Early retirement of members of the forces has been made necessary by<br />
the requirements of a modern defence system. It is now the rule in the<br />
British armed forces and the other British Commonwealth countries.<br />
In view of our special needs for defence forces of the highest efficiency<br />
under conditions of present warfare, we cannot afford to lag behind in<br />
this vital matter.<br />
Nevertheless, the practice creates a problem which is intensely<br />
human, and has an important practical bearing on our ability to recruit<br />
and retain men of the requisite calibre for the services. The practice<br />
means that men will in many cases come to the end of their service<br />
careers while still in the early middle years of their lives. In the Air<br />
Force, retirement of officers commence at the age of 41, in the Navy, at<br />
the age of 45 and, in the Army, at the age of 47. Men who leave the<br />
services at such ages have before them the acute personal problem of<br />
finding new occupations in civil life. Since the exigencies of the defence<br />
system impose these conditions of retirement, the Government has a<br />
clear obligation to provide a special scheme of retiring benefits, which<br />
should be sufficient to tide the member over the period of readjustment<br />
and to supplement substantially his earnings in his civil occupation.<br />
Similar considerations apply into a perhaps somewhat lesser degree to ii </p>
<p>S 36<br />
I: men who retire from more senior service positions at a rather higher<br />
but still relatively early age. On the practical side, it has to be<br />
considered that unless provision of this kind is made, the prospect of<br />
early retirement will act as a discouragement to men contemplating<br />
careers in the services.<br />
" I outline existing retirement provisions for the forces. Naval<br />
personnel are credited with deferred pay, payable on the retirement<br />
of the member, or to his estate if death occurs during service. For<br />
officers serving to the full retiring age of their ranks, the cumulative<br />
deferred pay would amount to approximately œ 4,000 for lieutenantcommanders<br />
rising to approximately œ 6,500 for captains. Permanent<br />
personnel of Army are contributors to the Commonwealth Superannuation<br />
Fund and have the same pension cover for themselves and their<br />
dependants as have members of the Commonwealth Public Serv-ice.<br />
" Before the amendment of the Superannuation Act in 1947, the<br />
maximum pension obtainable by any officer at the age of 60 was œ 416<br />
per annum. Under the amendments to the Superannuation Act, there<br />
was a general increase by 23 per cent. of the pensions of all officers and<br />
other ranks, and officers were enabled, according to their rate of salary,<br />
to contribute for a muaximum. pension of œ 345 per annum at the age of<br />
The general effect was that 60 per cent. -of the cost of all pensions<br />
would he provided by the Commonwealth. The Air Force provisions<br />
are not in line with those of either the Navy or the Army. Permanent<br />
Air Force personnel -below officer rank are contributors to the Superannuation<br />
Fund under -conditions similar to those obtaining in the Army.<br />
Air Force officers contribute to the Superannuation Fund to provide<br />
for benefits on death or invalidity during service. The major retirement<br />
provision for these officers is a system of deferred pay which is a<br />
benefit paid to the member on retirement or to his estate if death occurs<br />
during service. The rates of deferred pay are substantially less than<br />
those of Naval personnel of equivalent rank. The review of these<br />
provisions led to the following conclusions-<br />
First-Wide disparities exist between the different schemes.<br />
Secondly-In view of the recent red uction of retiring ages for Army officers<br />
from 55 or 60 to ages ranging fioin 47 years upwards, and even lower retiring<br />
ages in the other services, it is necessary to provide a scheme of pension for<br />
retirements at age 40 or later.<br />
Thirdly-A deferred pay scheme makes inadequate provision for the officer<br />
or his dependants in the event of death or invalidity in the early stage of his<br />
career. Fourtbly-Payn~ ent of deferred pay in a lunmp suni on retirement may lead<br />
to an unwise or unfortunate investment resulting-in the loss of the retirement<br />
benefit. Fifthly-Now that comparable ranks in each service receive generally the<br />
same rates of pay and allowances, it is most desirable that a uniform system of<br />
retirement benefits for all services should be adopted.<br />
" An exhaustive investigation of all aspects of the problem was<br />
made, and recommendations subscribed to by representatives of the<br />
I. three service boards form the basis of the bill. </p>
<p>IIœ 3; The bi provides for a scale o: f pensions to officers rising from<br />
annum for majors, and equivalent ranks in the other services,<br />
up to a maximum of œ 845 per annum. for lieutenant-generals, and equivalent<br />
ranks in the other services, who serve until retirement at age<br />
The maximum pension of œ 845 is also the maximum pension payable<br />
to a member of the Commonwealth Public Service.<br />
" The pension provision in the case of other ranks is based on<br />
twenty years' service after the age 0f twenty, and the rates range from<br />
per annum for able seamen, private or aircraftman, 1st class, to<br />
œ 155 per annuma for a chief artificer, warrant officer 1. ( Army) or<br />
warrant officer ( Air). For service beyond twenty years, the annual<br />
rate of pension increases by œ 6 to œ 8 for each additional year of completed<br />
service. Provision is made in the bill for the payment of a half<br />
pension to the widow, and allowances to the children, on lines similar to<br />
the Superannuation Act. After retirement of the member, the rate<br />
of widows' pension is related to the pension previously payable to the<br />
ex-member. " The existing deferred pay and superannuation schemes cover only<br />
permanent members of the forces. This bill extends pension benefits to<br />
personnel on long-term engagements. Those who do not serve for a<br />
sufficient period to qualify for a pension will be entitled to a refund<br />
of their contributions if their period of service is less than ten years,<br />
although throughout this period they will be covered against death<br />
or invalidity. Where the term of service is in excess of ten years, but<br />
less than twenty years, the member will be entitled to a refund of his<br />
contribution, -plus a gratuity equal to one and a half times the amount<br />
he has contributed. Provision has been made for certain officers who,<br />
because of their late age on entry, cannot complete twenty years' service<br />
for pension before reaching the retiring age for the rank held, to receive<br />
a pension on a reduced scale after the completion of fifteen years' service.<br />
" Naval, Army and Air Force cadets, and all personnel under the<br />
age of eighteen years, will be covered ' by the scheme, but will not be<br />
required to contribute to the fund until attaining the age of eighteen<br />
years. They will not be pensionable until reaching the age of 40 years.<br />
" The existing deferred pay entitlements of Naval and Air Force<br />
members presented particularly difficult problems. These have been<br />
met by granting these members the option to become contributors to<br />
the Defence Forces Retirement Fund, or, alternatively, to retain their<br />
existing rights. The deferred pay of those members who elect to<br />
Ibecome contributors to the fund will be transferred to the new fund<br />
to be established under this act, and the amount so transferred will be<br />
used to reduce their future contributions for pension entitlement. Army<br />
personnel, who are contributors under the Superannuation Act, will be<br />
transferred to the new defence forces retirement scheme on the same<br />
trms and conditions as regard benefits and contibutions as those to<br />
which they are entitled under the Superannuation Act. The reserve<br />
values held on their behalf will be transferred from the Superannuation<br />
Fund to the new fund, and will be available to meet part of the cost </p>
<p>38<br />
of the benefits they will ultimately receive. The contributions of memhbers<br />
of the services will be precisely the same as in the case of the Commonwealth<br />
Public Scrvice, and relate to a member'sa rate of pay, and<br />
the age at which he becomes a contributor or obtains pay increases.<br />
" To finance a scale of pensions such as is proposed for early retirements<br />
in the defence forces wvill entail a much greater government contribution<br />
than in the case of the Commonwealth Public Service superannuation<br />
scheme,' where retirements occur at age 60 or 65. The subsidy<br />
under the Superannuation Fund, namely, 60 per cent. of the cost<br />
of pensions, is inadequate for the retirement fund. On the average,<br />
because of early retirement benefits, the Commonwealth will have to<br />
pay much more than 60 per cent., but because of the impossibility of<br />
forecasting retirement rates, no precise statement can be made of what<br />
the percentage is likely to be. The Commonwealth undertakes to meet<br />
the deficiency between the value of benfits payable and the accumulated<br />
value of the members' contributions. The method followed is similar<br />
to that under the Superannuation Fund. The Commonwealth meets its<br />
liability in respect of each payment of pension or gratuity as it arises.<br />
" No precise information is at present available as to the ultimate<br />
cost of the defence forces retirement scheme, but, based on the present<br />
approved strength of the forces, it is estimated that the annual commitment<br />
may reach œ 2,000,000 in fifteen years' time, and increase comparatively<br />
slowly thereafter. This commitment is much in excess of the<br />
present liability of the Commonwealth in respect of deferred pay andl<br />
superannuation for the forces.<br />
" Provision is made to establish a defence forces retiremeut fund,<br />
administered by a board comprised of the president of the Commonwealth<br />
Superannuation Fund, the Commonwealth Actuary, a representative<br />
of the Treasury, and one from each of the three services. They<br />
will hold office for two years.<br />
" The bill provides for the control and investmnent of the fund under<br />
the direction of the board along lines similar to those provided in the<br />
Superannuation Act. It also -provides that the fund shall be audited<br />
by the Commonwealth Auditor-General; that it shall be valued by the<br />
Commonwealth Actuary every five years, and that the annual report<br />
of the board's operations and a statement of accounts shall be published.<br />

CONSTITUTION.<br />
AMENDMENT-REFERENDUM, PRICES.<br />
On 10th May, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) broadcast<br />
over the national network. Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Fellow citizens,<br />
On Saturday, 29th May, you will be asked to record a simple vote,<br />
either Yes or No at a referendum to indicate whether the Australian<br />
Constitution should be amended to give the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
power to control rents and prices ( including charges).<br />
It is my purp ose to-night to put to you squarely the matter which<br />
you should take into consideration when making your decision.<br />
This is not a matter of politics. This is a matter which affects your<br />
pocket and the welfare of the people and, particularly, of the less<br />
favoured section of the people.<br />
First I will tell you why this referendum is being taken and, secondly,<br />
1 will indicate why the Government thinks that the only efficient method<br />
of operating price control is through the Federal % Government on a<br />
uniform'basis. Thirdly, Il will give you an indication of what I believe<br />
will happen if this referendum is not carried and it is held that the<br />
Commonwealth Government cannot exercise price control.<br />
As you know, price control was first exercised under the compelling<br />
necessity of war and the power was, and is still, exercised uinder the<br />
Defence powers of the Commonwealth. Price control was introduced<br />
because it was realized that rapidly rising prices would throw our<br />
economy completely out of gear and reduce our capacity to make a full<br />
war effort. Price control was then, and is now, a brake on inflation.<br />
The power, as I have mentioned, was exercised under the Defence<br />
power. That power is liable, because the war has ended, to be successfully<br />
challenged. Should such a successful challenge be made, the<br />
whole price-fixing structure would vanish and the people would imme.-<br />
diately be at the mercy of those who are prepared to charge any price<br />
for goods in short supply. To say that the States could pick up the<br />
task of fixing prices is a deliberate attempt to mislead you. The States<br />
have neither the staff, the experience, nor the machinery to undertake<br />
this task. In fact, only two have legislation on the subject.<br />
It was realized after the cessation of hostilities that the price firing<br />
power which was operated under Commonwealth control could be in<br />
danger. Consultations were held with the State Premiers-comp rising both<br />
Labour and conservative Premiers. They agreed unanimously that it<br />
was necessary to continue ' price control. They were anxious to avoid<br />
the ' boom and bust' policy which followed World War IL and which<br />
caused so much unemployment, misery, hardship and degradation in<br />
this country. </p>
<p>In 1946, the Premiers unanimously agreed-subject to their parliaments'<br />
concurrence-to pass legislation which would enable price control<br />
powers to be exercised -by the Commonwealth Government for as long<br />
as shortages of commodities persisted. But hostile legislative councils--<br />
bodies not elected by the people--blocked that effort in some of the<br />
States. Here, briefly, is what h-appened to the Economic Stability<br />
Bill in the various State parliaments-<br />
New South Wales.-The act expires on 31st December next.<br />
Victoria.-The act expired last June, the Legislativ-e Council refusing to<br />
extend it past then.<br />
Queensland-The act continues until a date to be proclaimed.<br />
South Australia.-The act expired l-ast December.<br />
Western Australia.-The act expires next December.<br />
Tasmania-The act expires next month, the Legislative Council refusing to<br />
extend it beyond then.<br />
Without the concurrence of all State parliaments the promise was<br />
nullified. The Queensland and New South Wales Governments were<br />
prepared to give effect to this promise. I believe all the Premiers<br />
were prepared to carry out the promise they made but in some States<br />
the parliaments refused to endorse the promise. Had the States done<br />
their job and provided you with complete insurance -against rising<br />
prices and the grave danger of inflation there would have been no<br />
need for a referendum. Having-tried to give you protection in that<br />
way and failed, the Commonwealth Government is now faced with the<br />
national responsibility of asking you to give it the power to protect<br />
your interest and the national economy.<br />
H I now-come to the second point. Any intelligent Australian will<br />
realize that price control must be operated on a Commonwealth basis<br />
if there is to be uniformity. To have six price-fixing authorities fixing<br />
prices on goods that are manufactured in one State and distributed<br />
into all the other States must appear to any thinking person as<br />
ludicrous. No effective control of prices can be exercised on prices<br />
of goods by a State when those goods have been brought from another<br />
State. A State would have no powver to investigate the cost of producing<br />
such goods. Here is another instance. If one State did not fix the<br />
price of a commodity in its cown State, any other State into which<br />
such a type of goods was sent would not have any guide as to what<br />
price should be fixed.<br />
I have already mentioned that, apart from this difficulty, the States<br />
have neither the experience nor the machinery to undertake the task.<br />
My third point is that if this referendum is not carried and the<br />
power now carried on under the Defence Power is successfully challenged,<br />
there can only be one result-inflationary prices and immediate<br />
demands -by workers for increased wages to overtake the increased cost<br />
of living. And out of all that would he chaos.<br />
There is another aspect of price control I place before you-an<br />
aspect vital in maintaining a stable economy. Without price control<br />
the Commonwealth Government could not continue fully its system<br />
of subsidies that is keeping down the price of a wide range of everyday<br />
commodities. The Commonwealth meets part of the cost of every </p>
<p>pound of butter, tea, potatoes and of every pint of milk purchased by<br />
the Australian consumer. The price of all Australian made woollen<br />
goads and most other items of clothing is much lower because of these<br />
subsidies. I give yrou a few examples of what these consumer subsidies mean<br />
to the family budget and living costs generally. If the Commonwealth<br />
Government were forced to abandon its subsidy plan, the price of tea<br />
would overnight rise by 2s. 6d. to 5s. 3d. per lb.; butter would go up<br />
by Sid. per lb.; milk by Jd. a quart and the price of potatoes would<br />
nearly double. An ordinary three-piece suit would cost another<br />
shoes would go up by 2s. a pair and those who prefer kid shoes would<br />
have to pay 6s. more a pair.<br />
The subsidy of œ 5,500,000 being paid on textiles other than wool is<br />
saving consumers about œ 8,000,000 a year on their clothing bill.-<br />
The farmer would have to pay nearly 50 per cent. more for his<br />
superphosphate. The Commonwealth Government is also paying subsidies on such<br />
items as coal -and coastal shipping freights. These are indirectly<br />
keeping down living costs.<br />
At present the Commonwealth is spending about œ 40,000,000 a year<br />
on these consumer subsidies. The Government has announced that its<br />
object is to remove or reduce many of these subsidies when circumnstances<br />
permit, but in a world of great economic difficulty and inflated<br />
prices, they are being retained for the time being to ease the burden<br />
of consumers. People must realize, however, that if the Commonwealth's power<br />
to control prices failed many of these subsidies would have to be<br />
terminated. The Commonwealth could scarcely accept a position in<br />
which State -authorities had control over the factors which determined<br />
the effectiveness or otherwise of Commonwealth subsidies costing more<br />
than œ C40,000,000 a year.<br />
Some -opponents of the Commonwealth's request that -you vote ' yes'<br />
on May 29th, try to make you believe that the States can themselves<br />
do the job when the Commonwealth's war-time powers run out.<br />
Any wise Australian will realize very quickly that price control<br />
must -be exercised on a Commonwealth-wide basis and could not be<br />
carried out effectively by individual States with separate and differing<br />
systems. As to the catch-cry about Canberra bureaucrats', Commonwealth<br />
price control is decentralized to such a degree that 90 per cent, of the<br />
decisions are made in the States; the whole work being co-ordinated<br />
by the Prices Commissioner at Canberra, where only 12 per cent. of the<br />
total prices staff is stationed. As a matter of interest, Commonwealth<br />
price control costs each Australian exactly one half-penny a week.<br />
I turn now to give you a warning-a warning of what can happen<br />
if Commonwealth control of prices ends. Unhappily, we have a firsthand<br />
example in what has occurred in the United States. </p>
<p>42<br />
I will now give you a picture in figures of what has happened since<br />
V. P. Day. In Australia, the price rise has gone from 22.86 per cent.<br />
on V. P. Day to 86 per cent, to-day. In Britain, where price control is<br />
maintained, the increase has been only from 80.4 per cent. on V. P.<br />
Day to 33.3 per cent. in December, 1947. But in Canada, where<br />
considerable decontrol has -been forced by the proximity of the United<br />
States, the rise has been from 19 per cent, to 42 per cent., and in<br />
the United States from 30 per cent. to the astonishing figure of 66<br />
per cent. Here is what happened in the United States:<br />
Price control, which had been effectively handled during the war<br />
years, was extended until 30th June, 1946. A clamnour was set up to<br />
abolish the system. President Truman decided to lift price control.<br />
In the following 25 days, food prices rose by 25 per cent!<br />
The President put controls back on July 25th, 1946, but pressure<br />
groups maintained their activity and in the following November all<br />
controls were lifted except those on rents, sugar and rice. Some of the<br />
actual price rises since price control lapsed are roast beef from 2s. 1d.<br />
per lb. to 4s. 2d. butter from 3s. 10d. per lb. to 5s. Sjd. cheese froin<br />
2s. 7d. per lb. to 4s. id.; -bacon from 2s. 7d. per lb. to 4s9. 1id.; eggs<br />
from 2s. lid, to 4s. 2d. a dozen.<br />
Food prices in the United States in December last year were 118<br />
per cent. higher than in September, 1930-more than double.<br />
In this talk, I have explained why the referendum on 29th May<br />
became necessary. I have shown that the States cannot, of themselves,<br />
provide Australia with an efficient system. The dangers confronting<br />
Australia have been clearly put to yrou.<br />
I now give you the same assurance as was given to the Australian<br />
Parliament when the bill to enable this referendum to be held was<br />
introduced in November last. The Government does not consider that<br />
it will be necessary to operate price control indefinitely, or to operate<br />
it in the detailed arid complete form to which we have become<br />
accustomed in recent years. Price control is that form is necessary<br />
only in a period of general excess of demand over supply; a condition<br />
which is being steadily removed. As shortages disappear, so can price<br />
control disappear until it will become a reserve power, operating only<br />
when and where it is for the well-being of the national economy.<br />
It would -be utterly impossible for the Federal Government, once<br />
given this direct power to control prices, to use that power to socialize<br />
anything-as is being alleged by anti-price control elements, flow<br />
could price control be used to socialize industry? Only by fixing unpayable<br />
prices which would drive private enterprise out of production.<br />
What then? The Commonwealth Government cannot, under the Constitution,<br />
operate any form of primary or secondary production, except<br />
such things * as munitions and uniforms for its own use. It cannot<br />
engage generally in wholesale or retail trading. </p>
<p>43<br />
So far, in this talk with you, I have dealt almost entirely with<br />
prices as such. Included in the question upon which you are asked to<br />
vote Yes or No on 29th May, is Commonwealth control of rents<br />
and charges.<br />
The power over rents would cover the fixing or pegging of rents<br />
and would include power to provide for the determination of fair<br />
rents and to protect tenants against eviction.<br />
The power would -also apply to rents of goods as well as rents of<br />
land and buildings. It would enable the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
to control and regulate the prices at which property of any kind, including<br />
commodities, are sold.<br />
Charges are specifically mentioned as included in prices to remove<br />
any doubt about charges which are in the nature of prices or rents, but,<br />
in relation to which, the term prices " or " rent may not be<br />
ordinarily used. Examples are the charges for hairdressing or for<br />
board and lodging. Another example would be the charges for the<br />
use of money, or in other wards, interest.<br />
It may be said that the State Governments could control rents.<br />
But it is unlikely that the States would do so at the same time and in<br />
the same way. That was the case after World War I. Under Commonwealth<br />
control, rents rose only 1 per cent. between 1914 and 1918.<br />
But after World War I. ended and Commonwealth control ceased,<br />
rents went up by nearly 50 per cent. -between 1918 and 1929. The<br />
States did not control rents then and it is dangerous to risk another<br />
failure by the States now.<br />
In any event, if rents were allowed to rise in one State, but not in<br />
others, wages would rise in that State above the general level. With<br />
wages, many other costs and prices would rise as well. As a result, the<br />
whole Australian economy would be thrown off balance. In practical<br />
terms, in safe terms, unified control of rents can be secured only<br />
through the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
I will deal with one other misleading argument advanced by<br />
opponents of a Yes vote on 29th May. It is claimed that, if the<br />
referendum is carried, the Commonwealth would have power to fix<br />
wages and to conscript labour.<br />
The simple answer to that argument is that the Commonwealth has<br />
no industrial power under the Constitution and there is no possibility<br />
whatever that the High Court would regard power over prices<br />
as a power to regulate wages and employment.<br />
Throughout this talk, I have stressed that this. is a simple issue,<br />
arising because of the simple fact that the State Parliaments failed to<br />
carry out the Premiers' undertakings. This is not even a political<br />
issue. Party politics do not enter into it. The State Premiers who<br />
gave the undertaking I have mentioned were a mixture of Labour<br />
and anti-Labour leaders. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Menzies), </p>
<p>Ar<br />
it .44<br />
who is leader of the Liberal party in the Commonwealth Parliament,<br />
is pledged to Commonwealth control of prices. Here is what he said<br />
in giving you his policy at the last Commonwealth elections-<br />
We shall unhesitatingly maintain price control as a means of preventing<br />
inflation during the period in which production is inadequate to meet the demand<br />
for goods which arises from the enormously increased purchasing power of the<br />
people. Mr. Menzies went on to say-<br />
Leot me, speaking for the government which introduced price control within<br />
a week of the outbreak of war, give the lie to those whisperers who tell you that<br />
a Liberal victory will mean an upward leap -in prices. We stand for con-trolled<br />
prices. I make those two quotations to show you that Mr. Menzies and the<br />
Government are of one and the same mind on this question.<br />
I sound one warning note before closing. In the world to-day<br />
peace has yet to be won. The awful cost of war has not yet been aii<br />
The democracies face enormous problems; the peoples of the world who<br />
gave their all to win a little happiness, a better way of life, face grim<br />
prospects. Britain poured out all she had in a war to the bitter end.<br />
To-day, her economic wounds are still bleeding. Australia is determined<br />
to play her part as a member of the British Commonwealth<br />
in the economic struggle now going on. Australia cannot carry out<br />
her part if she be weakened internally. A breakdown in the Australian<br />
economy would be another setback for Britain. I ask you to maintain<br />
Australia's economic stability. I ask you to vote Yes" on 29th May<br />
for your security; for the economic welfare of yourself and your<br />
children.<br />
