PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 19 FEBRUARY 1977<br />
REGIONAL LIBERAL PARTY CONVENTION ALBURY-WODONGA<br />
We have been having an interesting week in Canberra. The Labor<br />
Opposition, as usual, revived during the Christmas recess and<br />
expired on the first day of sitting. But it must be said that<br />
they worked hard over Christmas just before Parliament<br />
resumed, they put forward a new plan.<br />
If Labor has done nothing else, they have earned their<br />
self proclaimed label as the party of planners. On the economic<br />
side, we have had the Hawke plan, the Whitlam plan, the<br />
Wran plan and just a few days before the opening of Parliament,<br />
the Hurford Plan was unveiled.<br />
A plan in which the Shadow Treasurer promised to cure the ills<br />
his party had brought upon Australia by repeating all of the<br />
mistakes of the Labor years.<br />
At least he had the good grace to tell everyone that his plan<br />
threatened to prolong inflation.<br />
Mr Whitlam told us in a television interview 11 days ago that<br />
the Labor Government panicked in 1974.<br />
" Of course we panicked," he said. " The Cabinet panicked, the Caucus<br />
did. They did in the last three months of 1974."<br />
Why did they panic? It was because of the tragic effects of the<br />
1974 budget the budget which contributed so greatly 1: o present<br />
inflation and unemployment.<br />
Labor's solution then was to spend up big Government outlays<br />
rose by 46 percent in a single year. The deficit rose by $ 293 million<br />
to $ 2,600 million a nine-fold increase. Unemployment more than<br />
trebled.<br />
The Hurford plan now put forward makes precisely the same errors<br />
agaLn. Government spending would rise; the deficit would rise;<br />
inflation would rise; unemployment would rise. Clearly Labor<br />
is panicking again.<br />
The Government is determined to break the inflationary spiral.<br />
In this fight, which closely affects every Australian, we are<br />
going to stick to our guns. </p>
<p>Inflation hits all sections of the community, but none harder<br />
than the rural producer who must pay increased prices while<br />
having little or no influence on prices he receives.<br />
He has been caught in the vice of rapidly rising costs, and often<br />
diffi. cult or depressed markets combined with adverse seasonal<br />
conditions. In the three years ended 30 June 1976, prices paid by farmers<br />
rose by 76 percent. During the same period, prices received<br />
rose by only 7 percent. The solution to this problem lies in<br />
a combination of factors: the resources, skill, initiative<br />
and stamina of the producer himself; improved prices in external<br />
markets; sympathetic government action, and favourable seasonal<br />
conditions.<br />
You all remember the so-called rural policy of the last Government,<br />
Labor attacked the rural sector on all fronts. There was the<br />
Coombs Task force, the abolition of the bounty on superphosphate,<br />
and the attempted reduction of the wool reserve price by<br />
percent.<br />
Yet the then Prime Minister had the gall to tell the audience<br />
at an agricultural show in February 1974 " You have never had<br />
it so good."<br />
As Alan Reid, in his book " The Whitlam Venture" aptly<br />
summed up the position: " Country dwellers were given<br />
justification for believing that Whitlam's advisers, and among<br />
them advisers on whom he leaned heavily, were not only indifferent<br />
but hostile to the rural sector."<br />
The policies of the present Government stand in sharp contrast<br />
to those of Labor. The Government has formulated policies for<br />
the benefit of the whole of our community, recognising the<br />
close interdependence between the urban and rural communities.<br />
Let us look briefly at some of those policies that have particularly<br />
affected the rural sector.<br />
1. Income Equalisations Deposit Scheme<br />
This ' scheme supplements the existing provisions for averaging<br />
incomes. It should greatly assist primary producers by providing<br />
a flexible method of evening out fluctuations in farm incomes.<br />
The scheme will enable them better to withstand natural disasters<br />
and years of unusually poor returns. The aim of I. E. D.' s is to<br />
allowt primary producers in those years in which return are<br />
higher than expected because of unusual seasonal or market<br />
circu: mstances to put aside income for the years when adverse<br />
circu-mstances apply.<br />
The s'cheme is particuarly helpful when a producer receives<br />
unusivally high income at one time from forced sales and insurance<br />
procceeds arising from a natural disaster like that recently<br />
expe-rienced in Victoria. / 3 </p>
<p>The scheme was ' recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
and 3hould prove of substantial assistance to a great number<br />
of primary producers.<br />
Yet, despite the fact that the report originiated from the [ 1AC,<br />
Mr Whitlam in Parliament last Tuesday scornfully dismiss3e d<br />
the scheme as " the latest lurk for Pitt and Collins Street<br />
farmars". Mr Whitlam's view of the rural community, it is<br />
clear, remains unaltered.<br />
The Dther recommendations of the IAG regarding averaging of<br />
incomes have not been rejected by the Government and remain under<br />
revi ew.<br />
2. Dther Taxation Reforms<br />
A number of other taxation and duty reforms have been introduced<br />
which should substantially benefit the primary producer.<br />
Tax indexation is an historic reform. All taxpayers will benefit<br />
saving this year a total of $ 1050 million. Next year the amount<br />
of tax foregone by the Government will be even greater.<br />
To the rural producer tax indexation constitutes a significant<br />
boost to after-tax income. The investment allowances provided<br />
a much needed boost to private investment. The requirement for<br />
distribution of profits by private companies has been eased.<br />
Estate duty relief has been introduced for cases where an interest<br />
in an estate passes to a surviving spouse.<br />
3. Devaluation<br />
Our decision to devalue on 28 November last year helped primary<br />
producers considerably. 55 percent of primary production is<br />
exported; devaluation helped regain our competitiveness<br />
on world markets and will boost farm incomes.<br />
Devaluation also brought forward some major resource projects<br />
and greatly assisted the mining industry, particularly those producers<br />
whose sales contracts are written in United States dollars.<br />
The advantages of devaluation are many and can bring great<br />
rewards, but there are also dangers if the other arms of economic<br />
policy are relaxed. We intend to retain the benefits of devaluation<br />
by making the appropriate adjustments in other arms of policy to<br />
ensure that our overriding commitment to attain a fall in inflation<br />
is achieved.<br />
There have also been a substantial number of initiative! s<br />
madE! in particular rural industries.<br />
Today I shall mention just three.<br />
The beef industry has been facing extremely difficult times.<br />
The plight oT many beef growers is recognised by the Government<br />
in its provision in the Clast budget of a further $ 15 million to<br />
be made available for carry-on loan assistance to be jointly<br />
financed with the States. Conditions of these loans have been<br />
liberalised to enable producers who had already obtained finance<br />
t~ o apply oneco agLiin. / 4 </p>
<p>The Government has also suspended the meat export inspection<br />
charge and is contributing in excess of $ 10 million for the<br />
tuberculosis and burcellosis eradication campaign.<br />
The best indicator for future prosperity in this industry<br />
is the number of ' recent breakthroughs made in achieving<br />
market access, particularly in Japan,-the the<br />
the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc.<br />
The recent Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee meeting in<br />
Tokyo resulted in a supplementary quota of 15,000 tonnes for the<br />
second half ' of this fiscal year; a special additional quota<br />
of 5,000 tonnes boiled beef and beef for Japan's school lunch<br />
programme; an undertaking by the Japanese officials to<br />
endeavour to announce the quota for the next six months as<br />
soon as'possible after 1 April.<br />
Negotiations have also led to an increase of 9,000 tonnes<br />
in our entitlement in the U. S. market for 1977, and a probable<br />
sale of about 100,000 tonnes of beef to the Soviet Union.<br />
The prospects this year are for record meat sales. The abbatoirs<br />
will be at or near full capacity and we look to the meat employee<br />
unions to ensure that the abbatoirs are worked at full capacity.<br />
Wheat growers have had a less difficult period, although total<br />
production this year will be slightly down. The first advance<br />
on wheat for 1976/ 77 has been increased 20 percent to $ 66 per tonne.<br />
The home consumption price for wheat has been increased by<br />
$ 6 per tonne.<br />
For the 1976/ 77 season for wool the Government initially<br />
guaranteed a minimum reserve price for 234 cents per kilogram clean<br />
clip average, a rise of 14 percent. At that time the Government<br />
also undertook to retain not less than such minimum price throughout<br />
the 1977/ 78 season.<br />
This has given a greater measure of stability to the industry<br />
andhas facilitated forward planning and investment decisions.<br />
After the devaluation in November, the minimum reserve price was<br />
raised to 284 cents to give growers the full benefit of devaluation.<br />
There has been continued strength in the wool market and the present<br />
price of 322 cents is well above the reserve price.<br />
These are but a few of the initiatives introduced by the Government<br />
since taking office. They are indicative of the deep concern felt<br />
by the Government at the shoddy treatment given to rural<br />
producers by the Labor Government, and the steps taken to correct<br />
the distortions which had occurred under Labor.<br />
Further initiatives concerning the rural sector are under consideratic<br />
at the moment.<br />
For example, thc Government is committed to the establishment of<br />
a rural bank to provide long term finance and specialist services<br />
to the rural community.<br />
The Government has already accepted a broadening of the role oE<br />
the River MNurray Commission with regard to water quality in the<br />
Murray, and with. the three states concerned,-will examine proposals </p>
<p>to be put forward by the Commission for increasing its -role<br />
in the management of the Murray system.<br />
The Liberal Party Federal Rural Committee and the Government<br />
Backbench Rural Committee greatly assist us in our continual<br />
review of policies for the rural sector.<br />
I take this opportunity to commend the work of my colleague<br />
Wal Fife, the Member for Farrer, who is an active member of<br />
both those committees.<br />
Two other matters of importance were announced this weekthe<br />
referenda to amend the Constitution and the redistribution.<br />
Bills are now before Parliament which seek to make four amendments<br />
to the Australian Constitution. All four arise out of decisions<br />
reached at the Hobart Constitutional Convention.<br />
These proposals are: that Senate elections be held at the same time<br />
as elections for the House of Representatives. That any casual<br />
vacancy in the Senate be filled by a person of the same political<br />
party as the Senator originally elected and for the balance<br />
of his term. That there be a retirement age for judges of all<br />
Federal courts, and that voters in the Territories be entitled<br />
to vote at -referendums to alter the Constitution.<br />
All four bills passed the House of Representatives<br />
this week without a single dissenting voice.<br />
Assuming the bills are passed by the Senate, referendums will be<br />
held on 21 May to seek voters? approval for these changes. It appears<br />
that-each of the proposals will enjoy the support of all parties.<br />
If members of the Liberal Party actively support these fair and<br />
equitable constitutional amendments as I am sure you will<br />
I am confident that the referendums will be successful.<br />
The Government is also taking the opportunity to enable the<br />
Australian voters to choose a new national song. In view of<br />
the prolonged debate over the relative merits of " God Save The<br />
Queen", " Waltzing Matilda", " Song of Australia", and " Advance<br />
Australia Fair", this approach seems to me to be the only fair<br />
method of resolving this matter once and for all.<br />
The Government has made it clear, however, that " God Save The Queen"<br />
will be retained for all Regal and Vice-Regal occasions.<br />
The redistribution which was announced this week has become<br />
necessary at this time, because of the grave imbhalance in<br />
numbers of voters between differing electorates, and bEcause<br />
of the need to implement recent High Court decisions.<br />
The coalition parties, to the great chagrin of Labor, quickly<br />
reached agreement on this issue. The present provisions whereby<br />
enrolments in electorates may not vary by more than 10 percent from<br />
the quota will be retained. The Government was concerned to avoid<br />
the inequity of very large electorates having more voters than<br />
small city electorates. / 6 </p>
<p>Thle redistribution which was proposed by Labor in 1975 and<br />
rejected by the Senate did so provide the proposed seat of<br />
Doncaster Templestowe was to have had 59,000 voters whereas<br />
the huge electorate of Mallee was to have had 66,000 electors<br />
on the roll.<br />
The greater difficulty for a member of Parliament in adequately<br />
serving a very large electorate is self-evident. In order<br />
to avoid this inequity, the relevant legislation will be<br />
amended to provide that rno electorate of more than<br />
5000 square kilometres can have more voters than an electorate<br />
of less than 5000 kilometres.<br />
The rapid agreement reached between the Liberal and National<br />
Country Parties is a good example of harmonious relationships<br />
at work within the coalition and is a triumph for common sense.<br />
Mr Chairman, I am delighted to have had an opportunity to speak<br />
to this Convention today in Albury-Wodonga. This is a centre<br />
which,, as the results of the last census indicate, is growing<br />
rapidly. Over the past five years, Albu'ry-Wodonga has increased<br />
in size by over 8,000 people or 18.1 percent.<br />
This can be compared with Sydney and Melbourne which only grew<br />
by 2.9 percent and 4.1 percent respectively over the same period.<br />
The Government has confirmed its commitment to the development<br />
of Albury-Wodonga by making available a further $ 6 million to<br />
the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation in addition to the<br />
initial allocation of $ 15 million in the last budget.<br />
We now look to private investors, and to the two state governments<br />
to show an equal commitment. If such a commitment is forthcoming, thE<br />
future of Albury-Wodonga seems assured.<br />
Not only the rural community but the entire community has been throug.-<br />
a most difficult period. When we were elected, we said it would<br />
take three years to sort out the economic mess we inherited<br />
from Labor. There are now signs of recovery, encouraging signs.<br />
But there is more to be done and more will be done by the<br />
Government to ensure that full recovery is achieved. In this<br />
we need your' full support. I know you will not let us down.<br />
I am confident that the Government will not let you down.<br />
