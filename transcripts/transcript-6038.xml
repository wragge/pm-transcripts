1jAUSTKAU. A*<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 1 MARCH 1983<br />
LABOR'S ECONOMIC POLICY<br />
It is not only the Government that is condemning Labor's<br />
irresponsible economic policies.<br />
This is what the economic commentators and editorials<br />
have to say.<br />
" The ALP programme is on all fours with the disastrous<br />
economic programe introduced by the Mitterand Government<br />
in France". ( Max Newton)<br />
" We believe that the path he has chosen is the road<br />
to recklessness". ( Editorial, The Australian)<br />
" There are so many contradictions in this document<br />
( National Recovery and Reconstruction Plan) that the<br />
economy could hardly survive its implementation"<br />
( Des Keegan)<br />
" Indeed the extreme case might give Australia its<br />
very first experience of what might be called the<br />
Argentine option : deep recession with accelerating<br />
inflation". ( Editorial, Financial Review)<br />
" A Hawke-led Government would be about BIG government.<br />
It will be big in terms of expenditure the immediate<br />
and later promises will take the Government spending<br />
share of the national cake above 40%. And it will be<br />
big in terms of deficits it does not need an<br />
economics degree to appreciate what these numbers would<br />
do to interest rates or inflation if Hawke, PM,<br />
decided to run the printing presses rather than borrow"<br />
( Terry McCann)<br />
" Remember, it's your wallet they're going to raid."<br />
( Des Keegan) </p>
