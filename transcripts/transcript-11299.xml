   I reject completely Mr Beazley's claim in his speech to the New South Wales<br />
   ALP conference that I have been "fishing for a poll-driven formula"<br />
   on East Timor.</p>
<p>  This is the biggest military operation in which Australia has been involved<br />
   for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>  As Prime Minister I have an obligation to explain the Government's decision<br />
   to the Australian people, to keep them well-informed of what is occurring<br />
   and to answer their questions.</p>
<p>  It is the right thing to do and I will go on doing it.</p>
<p>  When Mr Beazley's mentor Bob Hawke committed Australian forces to participate<br />
   in the Gulf War - with the full support of the then Opposition - he rightly<br />
   went to great lengths to explain the decision to the Australian people.</p>
<p>  Important though the Gulf commitment was, our involvement in East Timor<br />
   is on a much larger scale, it is closer to home and we are exercising the<br />
   leadership role. The obligation, therefore, to properly explain to the Australian<br />
   people the basis for our engagement is all the greater still.</p>
<p>  Unlike my predecessor, as Prime Minister, I do not believe that foreign<br />
   policy should be handed down to the Australian people like a tablet from<br />
   the mountain.</p>
<p>  Australians have a right to know what is being done in their name overseas,<br />
   and why it is being done.</p>
<p>  Mr Beazley has made the equally absurd claim that I have not done enough<br />
   to encourage other countries to contribute to the multinational force. This<br />
   is totally disproved by the variety of contributions from many nations.<br />
   Apart from Australia, at least twelve other nations are either involved<br />
   or committed to contributing, including Britain, Korea, Canada, Malaysia,<br />
   New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.</p>
<p>  I have been personally involved in discussions with the leaders of many<br />
   of these countries regarding the commitment of their forces.</p>
<p>  The Leader of the Opposition has falsely claimed that I had represented<br />
   that Australia's involvement in East Timor was an exclusively Australian<br />
   exercise, for Australian purposes.</p>
<p>  This also is disproved by the active steps to secure the involvement of<br />
   others, and my initial determination to ensure that there would be no involvement<br />
   by Australia without both the approval of the United Nations and the agreement<br />
   of the Indonesian Government.</p>
<p>  I was encouraged to note that in his speech, Mr Beazley described the deployment<br />
   of Australian troops in East Timor as "a new expression of a self-confident<br />
   and independent Australia on the threshold of its second century - confident<br />
   to be involved in this mission as a proud member of the international community."</p>
<p>  These are sentiments I totally share, but how they sit with his other criticisms<br />
   of the Government's conduct of foreign policy is something for Mr Beazley,<br />
   and not me, to explain.</p>
