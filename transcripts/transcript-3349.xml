The Premiers' Conference decided today on the<br />

Governments might be taken in order to restrain<br />
inflationary pressures.<br />

penalties on excessive wage incroases.<br />
Government Teiidering Procedures<br />
A working party of officials from the Australian<br />
Department of Housing and Construction and their equivalents<br />
in each State will report on the practicality of drawing up<br />
firm rules on the maximum increases in costs acceptable under<br />
Government tenders, including limits on the movements in<br />
wages under rise and fall clauses in continuing con-tracts.<br />
Industrial Tribunals A working party of officials from the Australian<br />
Department of Labor and Immigration and State Departments of<br />
Labour will draw up proposals on practical steps to reduce the<br />
0/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
multiplicity of wage fixing tribunals and the problems in<br />
respect of the fixation of wages and working conditions<br />
that this gives rise to.<br />
Action to Limit Wage Increases<br />
A working party of officials from the Australian<br />
Department of Labor and Immigration and State-Departments<br />
of Labour will examine, in the light of the proceedings<br />
which have been taking place in the Moore Conference last<br />
week, the practicability of the seven Governments making a<br />
joint application to the Australian Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission, -to limit wage increases to an<br />
indexed amount related to cost of living increases, with some<br />
provision to deal with anomalies. The working party will<br />
also examine the practicality of legislation by the Australian<br />
Government and -the States to ensure that this principle is<br />
observed by State wage and salary fixing tribunals.<br />
Prices Justification Tribunal<br />
A working party of Australian and State Government<br />
officials will explore the practicality of legislation by the<br />
States to extend the jurisdiction of the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal. A purpose of this legislation would be to allow<br />
the Tribunal to disregard, as a justificatior4 for price<br />
increases, increases in wage costs in excess of wage<br />
movements resulting from indexation and the correction of<br />
anomalies. The working party will also consider the-possibility<br />
of legislation to regulate fees for professional and other<br />
services.<br />
Taxation A working party of Australian and State Government<br />
Taxation officials will examine the practicality of measures<br />
to impose penalties, through company and payroll taxes, on<br />
companies which grant excessive wage increases..<br />
The Premiers referred to the budget difficulties<br />
all States are facing in 1974-75, and sought additional<br />
general revenue assistance from the Australian Government.<br />
The Prime Minister recognised that since -the June 1974<br />
Premiers' Conference the States had taken actio'n to improve * 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
their budget situations by way of an increase in the rate<br />
of payroll tax and increases in other taxes and charges.<br />
The Australian Government put the view that the<br />
remaining budgetary " gaps" must be closed by the States<br />
themselves, in ways they individually think best and that<br />
the present financial assistance grants arrangements should<br />
be allowed to run their course. However, the Prime Minister<br />
undertook to look at the problems of the States within the<br />
context of the examination next week of the Australian<br />
Government's overall budgetary situation.<br />
