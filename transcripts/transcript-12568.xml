    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Zimbabwe</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, as you know the meeting of the Commonwealth heads of government at Coolum in Australia last month authorised myself and President Mbeki of South Africa and President Obasanjo of Nigeria, in discussion with the Commonwealth Secretary General after the conduct of the elections in Zimbabwe, to assess and respond to the report of the Commonwealth Observers Group, having regard to the Harare principles and the Millbrook action plan.  </p>
<p>The committee met today, here at Marlborough House, and noted that the observer group, led by General Abubakar of Nigeria, had concluded that the presidential election was marred by a high level of politically motivated violence and that the conditions - I'm quoting here from the report - in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow for a free expression of will by the electors.  In other words, the committee accepted the conclusions of the Commonwealth Observers Group.  They deemed that these conclusions, together with other aspects of the report of the observer group, to be an adverse reflection on the electoral process requiring an appropriate Commonwealth response.</p>
<p>The committee took note of the various recommendations contained in the Commonwealth Observer Group report.  It also received a report from the Commonwealth secretary general on his consultations with other Commonwealth leaders.  All of us expressed a determination to promote reconciliation in Zimbabwe between the main political parties.  We are conscious of the parlous state of the economy and, to this end, the committee strongly supported the initiatives of the President of Nigeria and the President of South Africa in encouraging a climate of reconciliation between the main political parties in Zimbabwe - which they considered essential to address the issues of food shortages, economic recovery, the restoration of political stability, the rule of law and the conduct of future elections.</p>
<p>The committee calls upon the international community to respond to the desperate situation currently in Zimbabwe, especially the food shortages.  The committee noted the reference in the Commonwealth Observer Group report to national reconciliation being a priority and that the Commonwealth should assist in this process, and requested the President of Nigeria and the President of South Africa to continue to actively promote the process of reconciliation in Zimbabwe between the main political parties.</p>
<p>The committee has decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect.  This issue will be revisited in twelve months time, having regard to progress in Zimbabwe, based on the Commonwealth Harare principles and reports from the Commonwealth Secretary General.  The committee mandated the Secretary General to engage the government of Zimbabwe to ensure that the specific recommendations from the Commonwealth Observer Group report, notably on the management of future elections in Zimbabwe, are implemented.  And in line with the Abuja agreement and the Coolum statement, the committee stated that land is at the core of the crisis in Zimbabwe and cannot be separated from other issues of concern - and the Commonwealth will be ready to assist Zimbabwe to address the land issue and to help in its economic recovery in co-operation with other international agencies.  The committee asks the Commonwealth Secretary General to remain actively involved with the United Nations development programme in promoting transparent, equitable and sustainable measures for land reform in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The committee, or troika,  will actively promote the implementation of all the goals contained in this statement in consultation with the Commonwealth Secretary General and will meet at the request of the Commonwealth's chairman in office.  </p>
<p>Before taking questions, can I simply record my gratitude to my colleagues from Nigeria and South Africa and also the Commonwealth Secretary General for the constructive way in which we have dealt today with a difficult and challenging issue.  The most important thing about Zimbabwe is, of course, the future of its people.  There is a desperate food shortage in that country at present.  There is, of course, a substantial breakdown of trust within the community.  We have looked carefully at the Commonwealth Observer Group report.  We accept its conclusions and we have acted accordingly in accordance with the Harare principles and the Millbrook declaration.  I hope that the international community responds in a humanitarian way to the difficulties in Zimbabwe.  </p>
<p>For Australia's part, I am pleased to announce that we will increase our humanitarian aid to Zimbabwe by an additional two million dollars, and I believe that the series of measures that we have announced today are an appropriate and balanced response.  I believe they will meet the legitimate expectations of people within the Commonwealth, that there should be a consistency of treatment in relation to the application of the Harare principles, having regard to earlier situations covering countries such as FijI and Pakistan.  We look for change and progress in Zimbabwe.  We know it will be difficult.  Our expectations should be measured and balanced.  I think the announcements today maintain the principles laid down in the Harare declaration, offer incentives and a way forward in Zimbabwe.  And can I simply repeat that the efforts of my two colleagues will be very important.  They will have my active and enthusiastic support and, as chairman in office and working in consultation with my two colleagues, we will play an active role in monitoring the pursuit of the goals that have been outlined in this statement.  Are there any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could you explain what exactly the sanction of suspension for one year actually means in practice?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It means in practice that Zimbabwe, like countries such as Fiji and Pakistan, are denied access to any of the councils of the Commonwealth.  And that is one of the measures that are available under the Millbrook action plan.  It is, might I say, of the range of options that were available to us, and within the authority that we were given by the Coolum meeting, it is at the more severe end, if I can put it that way, of the actions that were available to us.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you think that Robert Mugabe will care that Zimbabwe is suspended from the Commonwealth?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The question of his own personal reaction, of course, is a matter for him.  I have noted in the lead-up to this meeting that people have said repeatedly - including many people from organisations that are represented in this room this afternoon - that this is a test for the Commonwealth as to whether it's going to be consistent in its treatment.  Now of course I believe we have been consistent in our treatment.  It can't be said, if you look at the terms of the suspension, it is for a period of a year, but that issue will be revisited and that revisiting will take place against the background of what has happened in Zimbabwe and applying the Harare principles.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, does that mean that you do not believe Mr Mugabe is the legitimate elected president of Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What we have said in this statement is that we accept the findings of the Commonwealth Observer Group and the Commonwealth Observer Group report had a very strong view about the conduct of the elections, and we accept its findings.  If we hadn't accepted its findings, we wouldn't have taken a decision in relation to suspension.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This may be a question for your African colleagues.  The opposition in Zimbabwe is asking for a re-run for the election.  Are you asking for that as well, and if that was a possibility, would the Commonwealth be ready to assist in a re-run.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Certainly the Commonwealth would be ready to assist in relation to any future elections.  Of course we would.  And if you look at this statement carefully, you will see it provides a plan, a path for engagement by the Commonwealth.  I understand that that engagement by the Secretary General will start very soon.  Speaking as the chairman of the group, we have laid down a plan of action and I think it provides the opportunity.  Once again, if you read the statement, you will see that the three of us are committed to the implementation of all the electoral reforms recommended by the Commonwealth Observers Group.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Commonwealth observation group concluded the election had been deeply flawed, there had been intimidation.  I want to ask you and your two colleagues, do you now accept that Robert Mugabe can be the legitimate leader of Zimbabwe in those circumstances?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I, and I'm speaking on behalf of myself and my two colleagues, what I will say today is that we accept the findings of the Commonwealth Observers Group and we specifically in the statement say that conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow for a free expression of will by the electors.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would that be a question of (inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would certainly hope that within a year's time the concerns that were held by the Commonwealth Observer Group would have been either removed or progress have been substantially made towards their removal.  The question of Zimbabwe's future position within the Commonwealth in a year's time will be determined according to what has happened.  It is stated explicitly that the measurement of that will be against the background of the Harare principles.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, could you just be a bit more specific?  What do you expect to happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's impossible for me to be any more specific than I have.  Once again, if you readâ¦well after a year, Zimbabwe is suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth for a year, in a year's time the three of us will revisit that issue and her future position in relation to suspension will be determined by what has happened over the last year, having regard to the Harare principles.  I don't think I can be more explicit than that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) another election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course, I would like to see a free, fair, open, totally democratic, transparent election held as soon as possible.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) South Africa: there have been statements out of the Commonwealth in recent weeks and opinions in the media that the way that the Commonwealth deals with Mr Mugabe's action in the elections and so forth will impact on the future of the new partnership for Africa's development.  The Commonwealth, being a body that has a large component of African members, has now taken a position which implies certainly a decisive degree of peer review.  How do you think that this will impact on the future of the partnership and the support that will come from the northern hemisphere members of the Commonwealth and from the G 8 industrialised nations and from the north.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my view is that, if the Commonwealth had not taken the action that's been outlined today, I think that failure would have had a negative effect.  I don't presume to speak for the northern hemisphere countries or for the European Union, certainly not.  But I think it's fair to say that the balanced approach that's been taken today is positive for that partnership but that will be for people more directly involved in the partnership to speak of.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could we ask president Mbeki a question?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The arrangement is that I'll take all the questions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could you tell us, was there any debate, what were the differences of opinion during the day, particularly with reference to president Mbeki whose deputy, I understand, had explicitly said that the election of Robert Mugabe was legitimate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We had a meeting.  It was a fruitful meeting.  We have produced a result.  I don't intend to go into the nuances of the various exchanges.  I mean, we've produced, I think, a sensible result.  And I think it's a result that maintains the Commonwealth's credibility.  It maintains its consistency of action in relation to electoral processes that fall short of the Harare principles.  And specifically, I remind you again, it's accepted the findings of the Commonwealth Observers Group.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I want to talk to you now of consideration by individual countries, including Australia, of imposing sancitons during that twelve month suspension?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Speaking from Australia's point of view, I would not see us implementing any sanctions in the near term.  I certainly wouldn't.  And I would imagine, given the decision taken to suspend, that I would not expect other countries to do it either.  But that is a matter for them.  It's a matter for individual countries to make decisions.   But, speaking as Prime Minister of Australia as well as chairman in office, I believe that the approach that's been adopted, the decision to apply the Millbrook action plan, to accept the Commonwealth Observer Group report, removes, certainly in the near term, the basis and the justification for the implementation of any sanctions, bearing in mind there is always a danger with sanctions that they do damage to people at the bottom of the economic scale.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Before today's meeting there have been a lot of suggestion that white industrialised western nations in the Commonwealth were taking a different stance from black African leaders who appeared initially to support an African brother in crisis, so to speak.  So again, how difficult was it reaching a consensus which is seen as cutting across the racial divide, so that the credibility of the Commonwealth is maintained?  How difficult was it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to over-estimate or under-estimate the degree of difficulty.  I do want to pay tribute to the very constructive approach that has been taken by the President and the President, I really do.  And I had the opportunity of getting to know each of them better at Coolum.  One of the reasons I think why we've had a successful outcome today is that I spent some time with both of them at Coolum and the President of Nigeria was kind enough to pay a bilateral visit to Australia beforehand.  I think we have got a good outcome and it does rather fly in the face of those who seek to use old labels to define the Commonwealth.  It's a difficult issue for my colleagues.  Their history, their experience is utterly different from mine, and that of my country.  But that hasn't stopped us trying to bring a very constructive...  In fact, I'll just have two more questions.  Then we'd better go.  The lady here.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I just wanted to ask if accepting the findings of the Commonwealth election observer group means that South Africa is changing its stance towards South Africa and what they have said towards Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it means what it says.  </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Leading up to the CHOGM meeting, are you heralding this as some sort of personal victory in pushing the combined view of Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada and New Zealand on to some African nations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I just say, with great respect Nigel, that is a simplistic view.  The idea that I've been pushingâ¦. I haven't been anybody's proxy in these discussions.  I've been the Prime Minister of Australia and putting an Australian view and I've been the chairman in office and I've worked with two colleagues and we've found a constructive outcome.  I'm not claiming any personal credit for that.  If there's any credit, it's a shared credit and I want to also thank the Commonwealth Secretary General.  I think it is a good outcome for the Commonwealth and I want it to be seen as a good outcome for the Commonwealth, not a good outcome for John Howard or any individual, and I think I speak for my two colleagues in saying that.  I think that probably wraps it up.  Thank you very much.</p>
