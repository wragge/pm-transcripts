I would like to thank Eric Ripper for his service to Western Australia and Australia.</p>
<p>He has served on the front bench of WA's parliamentary Labor Party for more than 20 years, including as a loyal and effective Deputy Premier in a two-term Labor Government.</p>
<p>During eight years as Treasurer from 2001 to 2008, Eric inherited an economy in recession and went on to deliver eight budget surpluses.</p>
<p>He served in a range of portfolios, including Energy, State Development and Public Sector management, and he was instrumental in reforming the State's energy market - attracting investment and creating jobs.</p>
<p>Eric's contribution as the Minister responsible for Native Title is unrivalled. He won and held the confidence of stakeholders, including miners and pastoralists, and led the reform and improvement of land access processes. His achievements included Native Title agreements that have underpinned the expansion of the Ord River agricultural area (Ord Stage 2). During his time as Minister, Native Title was determined over 800,000 square kilometres of Western Australia - an outcome unmatched anywhere in Australia.</p>
<p>Following the defeat of Labor in 2008, Eric accepted the role as Party Leader at his colleagues' request. For three years, he has led the WA Labor Party through turbulent times, fostering unity and purpose at a time when both could have been in short supply.</p>
<p>Eric is a proud West Australian and a true believer in the Labor cause. He has supported and assisted the development of WA's next generation of Labor politicians, and I know his commitment to the Party has never wavered.</p>
<p>I understand that the WA Party will meet next week to elect a new leader, and I look forward to working closely with them in the interests of Western Australia and the nation. </p>
