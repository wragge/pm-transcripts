    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, the Government launches the <em>Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience</em>, a special travelling exhibition which will visit 23 locations across Australia throughout the Centenary of Anzac period.</p>
<p>The <em>Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience</em> is a partnership between the Australian Government and the Australian War Memorial, generously supported by the Commonwealth Bank and by Telstra.</p>
<p>It is the flagship community event of the national programme.</p>
<p>From September this year, communities around Australia will have the opportunity to become immersed in Australia’s First World War story.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians, particularly young Australians understand the service and sacrifice of the members of our armed forces.</p>
<p>While the Australian War Memorial in Canberra holds a wonderful collection commemorating the First World War, this new travelling exhibition will allow Australians right around the country to see first-hand an extensive collection of military artefacts and interpretive materials.</p>
<p>One of the most important legacies that can come from the Anzac Centenary national programme is to improve community understanding and awareness of our wartime history, particularly by younger Australians.</p>
<p>The Government thanks the Commonwealth Bank and Telstra whose generous support has helped to make this travelling exhibition a reality.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Bank and Telstra have both had a long connection with our troops.</p>
<p>It was the Commonwealth Bank who managed the pay of soldiers on the front line during the First World War and it was the Postmaster-General’s Office which managed the communications between the front line and the home front.</p>
<p>Former Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Tim Fischer AC, has been appointed as the Envoy for the exhibition<em>.</em></p>
<p>Working with the Australian War Memorial, creative agency, <em>Imagination</em>, has developed the exhibition as a vehicle to share stories of the Australian war experience, ensuring that the legacy of Australian service personnel is carried into the next century.</p>
