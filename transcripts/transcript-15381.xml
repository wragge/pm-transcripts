    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will contribute up to $10 million towards a pipeline to improve water supply security in Bega Shire. The 20 kilometre pipeline will be used to transfer water from borefields near the lower Bega River to the Yellow Pinch Dam for use in dry times.</p>
<p>This announcement recognises the need to provide secure water supplies for growing regional areas while reducing the stress on our river systems. The Special Minister of State and Federal Member for Eden-Monaro, the Hon Gary Nairn MP, has been a strong proponent of the project.</p>
<p>The pipeline is expected to cost $20 million with the Bega Valley Shire Council funding the balance of the project. Towns that will benefit from the pipeline include Merimbula, Pambula and Candelo.</p>
<p>The project will help protect the environment by drawing water during times of high flow for transfer to the Yellow Pinch Dam for later use. This will supplement water drawn from the Tantawanglo Creek and reduce extractions from the creek during times of low flow.</p>
<p>To ensure these outcomes are generated, Australian Government funding is conditional on the Bega Valley Shire Council demonstrating that the work designs and pipeline will deliver improved environmental flows through the reduction of pumping during times of low flow.</p>
<p>The project is also dependent upon confirmation from the New South Wales Government that the proposed works are compliant with the environmental flow requirements of water sharing plans that are under development in the region.  </p>
