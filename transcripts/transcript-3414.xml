PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH N. B. C.' S " MEET THE PRESS",<br />
WASHINGTON, 6 OCTOBER, 1974<br />
ANEL<br />
Mr Lawrence E. Spivak Moderator<br />
Mr Bernard Gwertzman Chief Diplomatic Correspondent<br />
of the New York Times<br />
Mr Carl T. S. Rowan Chicago Daily News, Syndicated<br />
Columnist and Television Radio<br />
Commentator<br />
Mr Henry Brandon Washington Correspondent of<br />
the London Sunday Times<br />
Mr Robert Goralski N. B. C. News<br />
SPIVAK: Our guest today. on " Meet the Press" is the Prime Minister<br />
of Australia, E. Gough Whitlam, who is in this country on a. visit.<br />
Elected in 1972, he is Australia's first Labor Party Prime Minister<br />
since 1949. We will have the first question-now from<br />
Mr Robert Goralski of N. B. C. News.<br />
GORALSKI: Mr Prime Minister, no nation has been spared the agony<br />
of runaway inflation. Is there any kind of collective international<br />
action that can be taken to alleviate the situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: None of us have thought one up ~ yt. But it is. clear<br />
that it affects all of us and we have to try to work out solutions<br />
together. GORALSKI: The other day at the United Nations you talked to nations<br />
of the world, and talked about " sheer folly" in terms of possible<br />
military action. Is that a real possibility in your mind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so. I don't believe any head of<br />
government would resort to it. There have of course been comments<br />
that it was in contemplation.<br />
GORALSKI: Are you basically hopeful that some solution can be<br />
devised before the world does fall apart financially?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
GORALSKI: What kinds of steps, sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that we will come to a better balance<br />
between the needs of the developing countries and of the developed<br />
countries. We won't see the system disrupted so suddenly as it<br />
has been in recent months; but we accept the fact that there will<br />
have to be changes that the great disparities between nations will<br />
have to be reduced. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
SPIVAK: You ha ' l just met Robert Goraiski of N. B. C. Ne * ws. The<br />
other questioncrs on our Panel today are Bernard Gwertzman of the<br />
-New York Times; Carl T. Rowan of the Chicago Daily News and<br />
Henry Brandon of the London Sunday Times. We will continue the<br />
questions now with Mr Gwetzman.<br />
GWERTZMAN: Mr Prime Minister, in your speech to the United Nations<br />
you talked about world events beginning to sour and a sense of<br />
drift setting in. In your opinion is it more necessary now to<br />
strengthen security in your part of the world, or have tensions<br />
been reduced as you said when you took office a-couple of years ago?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think the big problem so far as we in<br />
Australia are concerned is security in our region. What does worry<br />
us is the proliferation of armaments and particularly nuclear<br />
armaments. We are worried that the high hopes which attended the<br />
inauguration of the non-proliferation treaty should be now so<br />
oftendisappointed. We have done all we can. We hope and this<br />
is largely why I was at the United Nations to get more joint<br />
action; to realise the objectives of that treaty.<br />
GWERTZMAN: Dr Kissinger spoke about this danger in his speech also.<br />
Do you think there will be a concerted effort to strengthen the<br />
safeguards on the spread of nuclear weapons?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can only hope so.<br />
GERTZMAN: One more security matter. In this country the United States<br />
has been concerned about perhaps a break up of SEATO. Do you<br />
think SEATO is still necessary?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it is still useful. There was a useful<br />
meeting of all the participants last week. And they 11 seemed<br />
to be happy with it. It has changed its character. Is is no longer<br />
designed to contain China. It is quite useful as a group to<br />
discuss problems regularly.<br />
ROWAN: Mr Prime Minister. Shortly after taking office you opened<br />
diplomatic relations with Peking, you pulled Australian troops out<br />
of Viet N. im, opened relations with Hanoi, gave money to the Viet Cong,<br />
opened relations with North Korea. Are you trying to make Australia<br />
neutral or a sort of Sweden of the Pacific?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, but we did want to dissociate ourselves<br />
promptly with the activities in which we had participated in<br />
Viet Nam and in Cambodia. I don't agree that we have given money<br />
to the Viet Long. We haven't. And we have only just established<br />
di. plomatic relations with North Korea. The other matters that you<br />
mentioned, Mr Rowan were done promptly. It was time to do them.<br />
F-TNN: Now recently in debates in your country your Foreign Minister<br />
Willesee said this: " The policies of the former Government were<br />
geared to a colonial era in which Australia dared take no action<br />
unless either Britain or the United States moved first". Do you<br />
share Senator Willesee' s view, that the previo2s Government made<br />
Australia " the laughing stock of the world"? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I agree with all that you have quoted my<br />
. Foreign Minister as saying. But, I don't necessarily want to<br />
pursue any factional or partisan attitudes while I am in your country.<br />
I think it's enough to say there will be no going back to the<br />
attitudes that our predecessors pursued. I believe that they accept<br />
the inevitability and propriety of those things which we have<br />
initiated. ROWAN: Mr Prime Minister is it simply a matter of your having<br />
concluded that some of the interests of the United States and Great<br />
Britain in the Pacific area are now inimical to the interests of<br />
Australia? PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't believe that. But we have helped<br />
the change in attitudes of the United States. The United States<br />
doesn't take the same attitude towards matters in the Pacific that<br />
it was taking in the 1960' s. America has changed.<br />
BRANDON: Mr Prime Minister. Australia, earlier-' this year I think,<br />
joined the International Bauxite Association which will control*<br />
about two-thirds of the world supplies. We have heard a lot about<br />
oil cartels. I was just wondering whether the Bauxite Assocation<br />
will create similar financial difficulties to the industrial world.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would think not. We certainly have joined the<br />
International Bauxite Association. The Association very largely<br />
stems from suggestions I made in North America fourteen months ago.<br />
But we have spelt out in the guidelines for the Association the<br />
fact that we want to see that the consumers of bauxite are assured<br />
of regular supplies, on fair conditions.<br />
BRANDON: Biut there was some talk about fair prices for the producers<br />
and that raises the question whether there won't be some price<br />
gouging. PRIME MINISTER: I know that there has been some talk of this as<br />
there has been in respect of any commodity agreement whateve~ r,<br />
agricultural or mineral. But Australia, I believe under previous<br />
governments as well as under my Government has a good record<br />
for wanting to have commodity agreements. And we naturally<br />
understand the attitude that the other bauxite producing countries<br />
have in that their prices for their sole export, in most cases<br />
bauxite, hasn't kept pace with the prices they have to pay for<br />
their necessary imports. There ought to be some relation between it.<br />
We share that view.<br />
BRANDON: Let me come back to the earlier debate about Australia's<br />
security. I think there are three theories. One is based on the<br />
forward strategy from which Australia seems to have withdrawn;<br />
then there is the fortress Australia strategy; and then there are<br />
those politicians in Australia who say that Australia really doesn't<br />
need much of a defence. I was just wondering where you stand. 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well 1. wouldn't be in any of the three categories<br />
You chose. There is the other one that the best arrangements are<br />
regional or collective ones. Some necessarily have to be global.<br />
We must be worried for instance if India, or further afield Israel<br />
and Egypt, acquire a nuclear weapons capacity. That concerns us.<br />
It concerns everyone in the world. But also in our own particular<br />
neighbourhood it is necessary that there should be a lack of<br />
tensions. We ought to play our part in reducing them and eliminating<br />
them. And we are doing that. We aren't waiting for initiatives by<br />
Britain or the United States. We are establishing good relations<br />
with our neighbours, ourselves, directly.<br />
SPIVAK: Mr Prime Minister, there are some people in this country<br />
who are puzzled by your sixteen day visit to the United States<br />
and Canada at this time when Australia has so many domestic<br />
problems of its own. Is this just a pleasure trip or is there some<br />
special reason for your trip?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The trip is a pleasure. I make no bones about that,<br />
in America,-Canada, or at home. But the matters we have mentioned<br />
such as non proliferation, or commodities, or resources are*<br />
important to Australia always will be not least now; and they<br />
can be dealt with in many cases only on a visit like this. On top<br />
of my visit to the United Nations, there was the fact that I thought<br />
it appropriate to become acquainted with the new President in the<br />
United States and to be in touch, as I always am when in North<br />
America, with the Prime Minister of Canada who has just been re-elected,<br />
as I have.<br />
SPIVAK: Mr Prime Minister, we have had reports in this country*<br />
that over the past few months at least that your position towards<br />
the United States is not as friendly as Australia's position has<br />
been in the past. Can you tell us in your own words how you now<br />
view our present relationship?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My attitude towards the United States has always<br />
been friendly. That of my party has been friendly, but as I said<br />
in answer to one of the panel earlier, nations do change their<br />
policies. America has changed her policy since the 1960' s, and if<br />
we recognise Peking instead of Taipei, that is not to be wondered at.<br />
It is not resented by America. If we get out Qf Viet Nam or Cambodia<br />
we are doing what America is doing. May I add that there are some<br />
countries, such as Japan and Indonesia noteably, with which our<br />
policies tally very effectively with America's interests too.<br />
SPIVAK: Are you saying this then, that although for a great many<br />
years Australian security depended on its firm ties with the United<br />
States, that's no longer true?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I think that in the ultimate circumstances<br />
Australia's security is tied with America. In the case of a world<br />
war there is no question where Australia's interest would lie.<br />
GORALSKI: Mr Prime Minister, how has Australia benefited from its<br />
relations with mainland China, with East Germany, North Korea,<br />
North Viet Nam. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: If one is to have relations with other-countries<br />
then one has to !. ave relations with them on the diplomatic level.<br />
' Now I don't know how much further you want me to go on this. The<br />
fact is that the relations which my Government has established<br />
with these other countries which you have mentioned will be continued<br />
by any Australian Government; and to take East Germany, the United<br />
States has now established diplomatic relations with East Germany.<br />
I don't think that if there is a change of administration in the<br />
United States those relations will be severed, as you will ultimately,<br />
obviously, also establish diplomatic relations with the Peoples'<br />
Republic of China. You have very meaningful liaison already with<br />
the Republic and you will also establish diplomatic relations with<br />
North Korea as well as with South Korea. That is taking sides<br />
in the case of these divided countries no longer serves any national<br />
or world purpose.<br />
GORALSKI: I think the point I am getting to, Mr Prime Minister,<br />
that charting a new foreign policy, a more independent foreign<br />
policy as you have, where do American and Australian foreign<br />
interests not coincide.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well one could give instances in the past. I<br />
would believe that America over-reacted between Korea and the Paris<br />
agreements to events in East Asia. Now I am very happy to see<br />
America's attitude has changed there. We have collaborated in<br />
that change. In many ways we have made it easier for the change<br />
to be made..<br />
GWERTZMAN: Mr Prime Minister, I would like to ask you about a<br />
problem which has bothered some Americans. It was your decision<br />
to recognise Soviet de jure sovereignty over the Baltic States.'<br />
As you know-it caused some concern among Americans of-. those<br />
nationalities as well as in your country. Could you tell us how<br />
you decided to do this? What was the motivation for it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We just wanted to faceup to the facts. We believed<br />
it is a delusion worse it is a deception to suggest that Estonia,<br />
Latvia and Lithuania will again be independent sovereign political.<br />
entities as they were only between the two world wars.-<br />
GWERTZMAN: Do you find an-inconsistency with this position with<br />
your othe;. well know position of urging humnan rights and ending of<br />
exploitations of other people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ' There are some cases ' where you can do something<br />
about human rights in a country with which you have diplomatic<br />
relations, where you can't with a country which you don't have them<br />
w . ith. For instance with Chile we have been able to do some things<br />
with Chile by recognising the new regime, that we couldn't have<br />
dor-if we had not recognised it.<br />
ROWAN: Mr Prime Minister, I think it is known that in the past<br />
Australia was thought of as European all her ties to Europe. Are<br />
you consciously trying to make Australia look more Asian? / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTTi No, we are obviously a European nation and we,<br />
. as far ahead a. ne can see, will be a European nation. Nevertheless<br />
it is clear that geographically and economically we must recognise<br />
the fact that we are right on the opposite side of the world from<br />
Europe. ROWAN: Well with regard to the racial implications there, you got<br />
a lot of publicity as the man who set out to right the wrongs that<br />
had been committed against Australia's aborigineds. Reports now come<br />
out that you may be caving into a white backlash. Is there any<br />
validity to this.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not, nor I believe are any of my colleagues.<br />
It is very difficult to get overall satisfaction with new policies<br />
particularly where they are policies which are reversing policies<br />
which have been pursued for some generations. But the hopeful thing<br />
is that the aboriginal people in Australia, under my Government,<br />
now have sufficient confidence to express their dissatisfaction.<br />
If they are dissatisfied with my Government they will let us know,<br />
and that is a necessary aspect of any self respect or emancipationthat<br />
people will speak up and act where they think that their<br />
interests are being harmed.<br />
ROWAN: Might I ask what your polJicies ewith regard to who<br />
can migrate to Australia. Will the door now be open to colouredsto<br />
blacks?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If coloured have blacks have close dependent<br />
relatives in Australi-a they ca. i c~ ome i n pretty well automatically.<br />
If they have skills but have no relatives they can also come in,<br />
but there i s some waiting list. But there is no discrimination now,<br />
whatever, in those who can come in to stay, or to vigit, on the<br />
grounds of race or colour.<br />
BRANDON: There is a strong group on the left of you, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, in the Cabinet and I gather in the Party Caucus<br />
that sometimes is very difficult for you to control, and. I was<br />
wondering whether there is a danger that they might oust you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They would be cutting their own throats.<br />
BRANDON: Why would they be cutting their own-throats?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:. Well I you come from England don't you?<br />
BRANDON: Yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well you know perfectly well that this is the<br />
stock-in-trade of any criticism of any Labor Government that it is<br />
faction ridden, that the right and the left are at arms length and<br />
the Leader is about to topple; well it doesn't apply.<br />
BRANDON: You have been quoted I think off and on that you have<br />
certain policies that you would like to pursue but have difficulty<br />
in getting through your Cabinet or the party machine. ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I get through whatever I set my heart on, and all<br />
, the matters that have been mentioned to me in your questions today<br />
have produced no resistance or resentment whatever.<br />
SPIVAK: Mr Prime Minister, . you have-been critical -of United States.<br />
-plans to strengthen naval facilities in the Indian Ocean island<br />
of Diego Garcia. Do you think it is unnecessary for the United<br />
States to do that in order to meet increased naval pressure in that<br />
area? PRIME MINISTER: As I said when I was asked at a press conference<br />
at the United Nations only three days ago, there is no nation around<br />
the Indian Ocean which welcomes the build-up on this uninhabited<br />
British group of islands.<br />
SPIVAK: Would you like to see the United States withdraw entirely<br />
from the Indian Ocean regardless of what the Russians do?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, certainly not'. Russia and-Almerica-are the.-<br />
world's great naval powers they can sail wherever they choosethat's<br />
clear. But we don't want a proliferation of armaments in<br />
the Indian Ocean which up till now has been-freest of all the world's<br />
oceans, of this American-Soviet confrontation.<br />
GORALSKI: Mr Prime Minister. The United States and Australia have<br />
a similar petroleum problem. I believe we have both produced<br />
about 70 per cent of our petroleum requirements and import about<br />
per cent. Do you feel that you can go along with an<br />
independent foreign policy, without being pro-Arab, to ensure the<br />
percent flow of oil from the Arab States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't stress independent foreign pc~ licy so much<br />
as inter-dependent foreign policy. Now as far as we are concerned,<br />
we aren't strong in oil but we are strong in other energy sources,<br />
such as coal and uranium and natural gas, and we are very anxious to<br />
see that energy sources in the world are not disrupted. But at<br />
the same time we want to see that other countries which have energy<br />
sources, like Australia, get a fair price for them.<br />
GWERTZMAN: Mr Prime Minister, you said your Government depends on<br />
the United States in case of a big war. Do you intend to permit the United<br />
States to retain its intelligence gathering and comrmunications facilities in<br />
Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My Government knows wiat the United States is doing<br />
in Australia,. and we know that nothing the United States does in<br />
Australia will be done except with our full knowledge and our<br />
full concurrence.<br />
ROWAN: Do you share the view of some of your countrymen that<br />
Australia's economic future depends more on Japan than any other<br />
single country?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: More than any single country,' yes. That would be<br />
true. ./ 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
ROWAN: In that case do you intend to give Japan long-term access<br />
to Australia's minerals and other resources?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, we are doing that. We don't want to see that<br />
Japan is driven to desperation again as she was in 1940. We want<br />
to see that she has dependable access to markets and resources.<br />
We are playing our part in that.<br />
BRANDON: You have imposed a ban on uranium exports. I wondered<br />
what the reason for it is?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, there are two things that we want to achieve<br />
and one is that we want to see that there is a proper return for<br />
these exports. Secondly we want to see, if we can, that we have<br />
some say in the processing of this mineral, of which we possess<br />
about one-fifth of the known reserves. But there have been some<br />
legislative difficulties in Australia which have delayed the solution<br />
of this matter.<br />
SPIVAK: Mr Prime Minister, it has been reported in this country<br />
that you are steadily severing the cord between Australia and Britain..<br />
Is that true?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not at all. Australia would have closer<br />
sentimental or personal ties with Britain than with any country<br />
including the United States.<br />
SPIVAK: Why does Australia remain in the British Commonwealth<br />
at all? Why don't you become an independent republic?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Being in the Commonwealth is not inconsistent<br />
with independence. We are completely independent, but like the<br />
three dozen members of the Commonwealth, we see advantage in<br />
belonging to a body which is very diverse racially, economically,<br />
politically, but wheie there is such complete freedom in<br />
exchanging views. There is no-one who wants to get out of the<br />
Commonwealth. GORALSKI: I was going to ask you very briefly Mr Prime Ministeryou<br />
were very critical of Mr Nixon when he was President, particularly<br />
aspects of foreign policy. What is your view now of Mr Ford's<br />
administration? PRIME MINISTER: I criticised privately some of the things that<br />
Mr Nixon was doing at the time that we came into office Hanoi,<br />
Haiphong and so on. But I met Mr Ford for the first time. He is<br />
a good man. He will get on well. </p>
