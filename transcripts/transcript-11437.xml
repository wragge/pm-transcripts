<p> PRIME MINISTER OBUCHI:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard and I have just finished our discussion. And</p>
<p> first I would like to briefly share my impressions with you. First</p>
<p> of all, I am very pleased to welcome Prime Minister Howard as an official</p>
<p> guest to the Government of Japan and to have had extremely meaningful</p>
<p> discussion with him today.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard and I had frank exchange of views on a wide</p>
<p> range of subject matters including our bilateral relations, issues</p>
<p> concerning the Asia Pacific region and international affairs. Our</p>
<p> fruitful discussion on the future vision for Japan/Australia cooperation</p>
<p> into the 21st century is perhaps the most significant outcome</p>
<p> of our meeting today. Coming out of the meeting with Prime Minister</p>
<p> Howard I am left with a strong impression that Japan and Australia</p>
<p> have indeed become true partners in the Asia Pacific and that we should</p>
<p> continue to build wider and stronger relationship of cooperation as</p>
<p> global partners.</p>
<p>I am happy to announce that on the occasion of the visit by Prime</p>
<p> Minister Howard we agreed to issue a joint statement on electronic</p>
<p> commerce. I also note with satisfaction that Prime Minister Howard</p>
<p> and I have agreed to cooperate closely so that we may bring to reality</p>
<p> initiatives symbolising our bilateral cooperation in the 21st</p>
<p> century such as launching of Australian satellite on Japanese rocket</p>
<p> and convening of Japan/Australia millennium conference.</p>
<p>This has been my second meeting with Prime Minister Howard and I look</p>
<p> forward to building stronger ties through close dialogue between us</p>
<p> such as we had today. Thank you and I now invite Prime Minister Howard</p>
<p> to speak.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much Prime Minister. It has been a very good</p>
<p> discussion. We covered a lot of ground - the bilateral relationship</p>
<p> is in very good shape. We have no better customer in the world than</p>
<p> Japan and we have no more broadly based association in our region</p>
<p> than the association we have with Japan and with the Japanese people.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that we both agreed on how important it was that</p>
<p> the next round within the World Trade Organisation was successful</p>
<p> and that that round should be comprehensive covering all sectors.</p>
<p> We both agreed on the importance of working through APEC to ensure</p>
<p> that there was maximum encouragement for that outcome and both of</p>
<p> us agreed on the importance of continuing steps to include.improve</p>
<p> rather, the financial architecture in the region.</p>
<p>We both also agreed on the importance of close association and improvement</p>
<p> of relations between China and the United States and the importance</p>
<p> of the admission of China into the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Like the Prime Minister of Japan, I welcome the agreement on electronic</p>
<p> commerce and also the involvement in the satellite project by Japan.</p>
<p> I was also most encouraged by the Prime Minister's enthusiastic response</p>
<p> to my proposal for the staging of a millennium conference regarding</p>
<p> the bilateral relationship involving not only members of the two governments</p>
<p> but also the business communities of our two nations and also academics</p>
<p> from our two countries.</p>
<p>We briefly.we also discussed the situation in Indonesia and East Timor</p>
<p> and both agreed on the importance of an improved security situation</p>
<p> in East Timor and also the importance of there being a free and open</p>
<p> vote to determine the future status of that territory.</p>
<p>And finally I thank the Prime Minister for the efforts that have already</p>
<p> been made by Japan to bring about the release of the two Australian</p>
<p> aid workers, Pratt and Wallace. I know that the Japanese Government</p>
<p> will continue to be active in this area and I am most grateful and</p>
<p> I know the Australian people are most grateful for activity in that</p>
<p> area.</p>
<p>And may I conclude by saying that I have greatly enjoyed the hospitality</p>
<p> so far extended to me and my party. The relationship is in very good</p>
<p> condition, it is a treasured relationship to the Australian Government</p>
<p> and the Australian people. And to you, Mr Obuchi, I warmly appreciate</p>
<p> the personal friendship you have displayed towards me and the hospitality</p>
<p> that you have extended. Thank you.</p>
