    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p> Well, thank you very much Martin, to John Olsen, the Premier</p>
<p>   of South Australia, to Cory Bernardi, recently elected as the new</p>
<p>   President of the South Australian Division, and I extend my warm</p>
<p>   congratulations to you and I look forward to a continuation of the</p>
<p>   very close cooperation between the federal parliamentary party and</p>
<p>   the organisation here in South Australia. I would, as this is his</p>
<p>   last State Council Meeting as President, I would like to record</p>
<p>   my thanks and gratitude to Martin Cameron for the leadership he</p>
<p>   has given to the Division over the last three years. I have found</p>
<p>   him an excellent President to work with, I thank him for the leadership</p>
<p>   that he has given and I thank him for the cooperation that he has</p>
<p>   extended to the federal parliamentary party.</p>
<p>Can I also say, on a personal note, how very sorry</p>
<p>   I am in one sense, but of course completely understanding in another,</p>
<p>   of Ian McLachlan's decision not to recontest the seat of Barker</p>
<p>   at the next federal election. Ian has been a good friend. He has</p>
<p>   been an outstanding Defence Minister, he has been a great leader</p>
<p>   of rural Australia and he has made a very find contribution as a</p>
<p>   senior Cabinet Minister from South Australia. And I want at the</p>
<p>   beginning of my address to this annual meeting to record the thanks</p>
<p>   of his colleagues for the contribution that he has made to public</p>
<p>   life in this country.</p>
<p>South Australia has made an immense contribution</p>
<p>   to national politics over the years. But its contribution to the</p>
<p>   higher councils of the Government has never been greater than it</p>
<p>   has been since the Coalition was elected in March of 1996. The third-most</p>
<p>   senior Liberal in Australia, Robert Hill, the Leader of the Government</p>
<p>   in the Senate, other Cabinet Ministers and Ministers make up a very</p>
<p>   powerful team. And on top of that, there is a record federal parliamentary</p>
<p>   representation from South Australia and I want to, in their own</p>
<p>   ways, thank each of the South Australian Ministers for their contribution.</p>
<p>   Alexander Downer's contribution as Foreign Minister has, I</p>
<p>   believe particularly over the last 12 months been characterised</p>
<p>   by a high degree of personal commitment, integrity and professionalism.</p>
<p>   To see and witness, as I did a few weeks ago, the ease and familiarity</p>
<p>   and the obvious mutually reposed confidences that he shares with</p>
<p>   the most powerful woman, politically in the world, Madeleine Albright,</p>
<p>   was a reminder to me of the immensely professional and praiseworthy</p>
<p>   job that he is doing on behalf of our country as Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>We have in Nick Minchin somebody who had probably</p>
<p>   one of the most difficult jobs in the country in recent months and</p>
<p>   he has had day to day stewardship of the Native Title legislation</p>
<p>   and played a very major role in bringing that very, very difficult</p>
<p>   issue to a very, very positive conclusion.</p>
<p>Robert's leadership in the Senate has been</p>
<p>   quite outstanding in very difficult circumstances. It is difficult</p>
<p>   sometimes to convey to our own supporters, let alone the general</p>
<p>   public, the sense of frustration one sometimes experiences when</p>
<p>   you have got a 44 seat majority in the House of Representatives,</p>
<p>   but you don't control the Senate. And people say, well that's</p>
<p>   your problem, don't come and talk to me about it, just fix</p>
<p>   it. And it's largely left to Robert to fix it. And he normally</p>
<p>   does, and he fixes it very, very well. And I thank him very, very</p>
<p>   warmly.</p>
<p>And, of course, there's the Skase chaser too.</p>
<p>   She is doing an absolutely tremendous job and I want to thank Amanda</p>
<p>   for the very committed and dedicated contribution that she has made.</p>
<p>And, of course, Neil Andrew, as the Chief Government</p>
<p>   Whip, Trish Worth as a Parliamentary Secretary, and to all of my</p>
<p>   colleagues from South Australia, I am very grateful, and I have</p>
<p>   taken and few moments to mention them because we do have a very</p>
<p>   talented group of men and women in the federal Parliament from South</p>
<p>   Australia. And I don't incidentally think there is a state</p>
<p>   in Australia on our side of politics that has a higher representation</p>
<p>   of women in the federal Parliament than does the state of South</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>So at every score you have a lot to be proud of,</p>
<p>   and a lot to be thankful for so far as the quality of your representation</p>
<p>   is concerned. And to all of my South Australian colleagues I send</p>
<p>   my thanks and gratitude for the loyalty and support you have given</p>
<p>   in popular and less popular times over the last two and a bit years.</p>
<p>In the past few days, of course, the news been</p>
<p>   has dominated by the release of the Government's plan to reform</p>
<p>   Australia's taxation system. And the real breadth and scope</p>
<p>   of this plan is only understood if it is seen as a continuum of</p>
<p>   what the Government has sought to do since it was elected in 1996.</p>
<p>   It is not some one-off aberration. It is not some kind of odd, disconnected</p>
<p>   tax revolution. Rather, it is the next logical, sensible thing that</p>
<p>   we must do to make Australia stronger and more competitive as we</p>
<p>   move into the 21st century.</p>
<p>It must be seen as all of a piece with the other</p>
<p>   things that we have done. We inherited a budget deficit of $10.5</p>
<p>   billion and that was Mr Beazley's deficit as much as anybody</p>
<p>   else's. And he should never, ever be allowed to forget it.</p>
<p>   And in the space of just two years, 12 months ahead of schedule,</p>
<p>   we have converted that into a surplus of $2.7 billion. And that</p>
<p>   really is a remarkable achievement, and it has given us a sense</p>
<p>   of strength and independence and vitality and a capacity to look</p>
<p>   the rest of the world in the eye that simply wouldn't have</p>
<p>   been there if we had left that unattended.</p>
<p>And we have delivered the lowest interest rates</p>
<p>   this country has experienced for 30 years - both in the housing</p>
<p>   area and in the small business area. I went to a gathering in the</p>
<p>   western suburbs of Sydney and couple of weeks ago and it was attended</p>
<p>   by some of the most successful businessmen of Italian and Lebanese</p>
<p>   and Greek descent who had come to this country after the War and</p>
<p>   have made a massive contribution to post War Australia. And they</p>
<p>   said to me with immense enthusiasm and pride, and all of them were</p>
<p>   in the building and construction industry, and they said that we</p>
<p>   haven't had interest rates like this since we first started</p>
<p>   in business. Please don't do anything to alter it. And I said,</p>
<p>   well that's simple - just vote Liberal at the next election.</p>
<p>But the impact of those lower interest rates are</p>
<p>   enormously important, not only to people who are paying off a home,</p>
<p>   but also to people in small business. And we have generated over</p>
<p>   300,000 new jobs in just over two years. We have reformed Australia's</p>
<p>   industrial relations system, and we have done that without ushering</p>
<p>   in an era of industrial disputes and strikes. Remember we were told</p>
<p>   before the last election that there would be riots, there would</p>
<p>   be blood on the streets, there would be national disputes and stoppages.</p>
<p>   In fact, we have had the best industrial record since 1913, the</p>
<p>   year before World War I started. We have ushered in not only industrial</p>
<p>   relations reform, we have also given an unprecedented era of industrial</p>
<p>   relations peace. And we have also undertaken one of the most successful</p>
<p>   privatisation campaigns that any government has undertaken. And</p>
<p>   we remain committed to an intelligent continuation of that programme</p>
<p>   because the long history in this country is that governments are</p>
<p>   normally not terribly flash when they try to run commercial undertakings.</p>
<p>   And there is a wealth of experience here in this state, in Victoria,</p>
<p>   in Western Australia, and at a federal level to underwrite and to</p>
<p>   validate that proposition.</p>
<p>So what we are doing in relation to the tax system,</p>
<p>   is to continue the process of building and strengthening the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. And it is because Asia has gone bad that we need to reform</p>
<p>   the tax system. The fact that Asia has gone bad is not a reason</p>
<p>   not to reform the tax system. That couldn't be more wrong.</p>
<p>   It is when you have faced difficulty abroad that the need for further</p>
<p>   reform is even more essential. What was unveiled on Thursday is</p>
<p>   not just the biggest personal income tax reduction and restructuring</p>
<p>   in thirty years, it's not just a fundamental reform of Australia's</p>
<p>   ramshackle, old fashioned, indirect tax system, it's not just</p>
<p>   the greatest reform in Commonwealth/State financial relations since</p>
<p>   before World War II, it's not just an enormous boost to rural</p>
<p>   Australia, to the Australian bush, and it's not just of particular</p>
<p>   benefit to a manufacturing State as South Australia. It's more</p>
<p>   than all of those things.</p>
<p>It represents a plan and a vision for the way in</p>
<p>   which this country should operate economically into the 21st</p>
<p>   century. And the big contrast that will now exist in Australian</p>
<p>   politics is between the Coalition that has a plan and a vision for</p>
<p>   Australia into the 21st century and the Labor Party who</p>
<p>   simply says no to everything and others who blame everybody else</p>
<p>   for their own difficulties.</p>
<p>And that is a very stark contrast. I have always</p>
<p>   believed in politics, Mr President, that the best way to beat other</p>
<p>   people politically is to offer the Australian public something better.</p>
<p>   And when I spoke to the Western Australian Division of the Party</p>
<p>   three weeks ago at their annual conference I said then that what</p>
<p>   we had to do was to offer the Australian public something better</p>
<p>   than our political opponents, whether they are our conventional</p>
<p>   political opponents in the Australian Labor Party or they are our</p>
<p>   opponents in the minor parties that are now touting for support</p>
<p>   within the Australian community.</p>
<p>When you look at our record, you see that we have</p>
<p>   offered better performance and better achievements in so many of</p>
<p>   those areas and now with our tax plan, we are offering to the Australian</p>
<p>   people a sense of direction and hope and guidance and encouragement</p>
<p>   as we go into the next century.</p>
<p>More than ever, Australia must trade well if it</p>
<p>   is to do well in a world beset with a lot of competition. This tax</p>
<p>   plan will reduce the cost of Australian exports by four thousand</p>
<p>   five hundred million dollars a year. This tax plan will take ten</p>
<p>   thousand million dollars of costs annually off the production of</p>
<p>   goods in Australia. It represents the biggest-single cost reduction</p>
<p>   for Australian business any government has ever offered because</p>
<p>   the great virtue of this plan is that it will reduce the input costs</p>
<p>   of the manufacture of goods in this country and by being able to</p>
<p>   sell them abroad free of a goods and services tax, our exporters</p>
<p>   will be more competitive than they have ever been before. By reforming</p>
<p>   the indirect tax system, and let me stress again, that the goods</p>
<p>   and services tax will completely replace the wholesale sales tax</p>
<p>   and on top of that, nine other State and Territory taxes including</p>
<p>   the financial institutions duty and the bank account debits tax.</p>
<p>It will also remove State taxes on share transactions</p>
<p>   and let me dwell for a moment on the enormous implications of that</p>
<p>   decision and the removal of the financial institutions duty and</p>
<p>   the bank account debits tax on the attractiveness of Australia as</p>
<p>   a financial centre in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>We have now completed the check list to make this</p>
<p>   country the most attractive location as a financial centre anywhere</p>
<p>   in the Asia Pacific region. We have now removed the financial institutions</p>
<p>   duty, bank account debits tax, stamp duty on shares, we have a stable</p>
<p>   political system, we have one of the most well regulated and prudentially</p>
<p>   supervised banking systems in the world Â not just in the Asia</p>
<p>   Pacific region Â we have the lowest inflation in the western</p>
<p>   world, we have a high level of business investment, we have a legal</p>
<p>   system that has world respect and world repute, and we speak the</p>
<p>   English language.</p>
<p>Now you put all of those things together and you</p>
<p>   can't get a better location for financial activity anywhere</p>
<p>   in the region Â and probably anywhere in the world, and in</p>
<p>   an age of borderless capital movements and of seamless capital transactions,</p>
<p>   that is a marvellous asset for our country to have. And we will</p>
<p>   be able to go around the world, particularly our region and say</p>
<p>   to companies, you come and set up your headquarters in Australia</p>
<p>   and you choose from any number of attractive capital city locations</p>
<p>   to establish your financial headquarters.</p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about this tax plan</p>
<p>   is that as the days go by we find new nuggets which make it attractive</p>
<p>   and this is the first time I've specifically drawn attention</p>
<p>   to what it will do to make Australia an attractive financial centre.</p>
<p>   I've been too busy dealing with other aspects of it over the</p>
<p>   last 48 hours Â such as the fact that 81 percent of Australians</p>
<p>   under this plan will have full tax deductibility of their private</p>
<p>   health insurance premiums and that we're going to abolish provisional</p>
<p>   tax, which I think will get a mildly positive reception in the bush</p>
<p>   and a mildly positive reception from a lot of self-funded retirees,</p>
<p>   and we're also going to bring in something that sounds terribly</p>
<p>   complicated but those who get the benefit of it know exactly what</p>
<p>   it is and that is fully refundable imputation credits.. That means</p>
<p>   that if you've got some shares and your tax rate is lower than</p>
<p>   the tax paid at the company level of 36 per cent, now you lose the</p>
<p>   difference. Under our plan you'll get the difference paid to</p>
<p>   you from a cheque from the tax office.</p>
<p>It is a plan that is a comprehensive response to</p>
<p>   Australia's taxation weaknesses and it will help lay the basis</p>
<p>   of a stronger and better Australian economy into the next century.</p>
<p>And it is, of course, particularly good for South</p>
<p>   Australia. If ever there was a State that depended quite heavily</p>
<p>   on manufacturing industry, it's South Australia. And in government</p>
<p>   we haven't forgotten the needs of South Australian manufacturing.</p>
<p>   We had them uppermost in our mind when we took the decision on the</p>
<p>   motor vehicle manufacturing industry and the decision we took on</p>
<p>   that issue was not only right for Australia, it was particularly</p>
<p>   right for South Australia.</p>
<p>I also take the opportunity of observing that the</p>
<p>   new taxation arrangements we propose in relation to the wine industry</p>
<p>   substantially correspond with the views that were put to us by the</p>
<p>   Premier, John Olsen, and by the leadership of the wine industry</p>
<p>   here in South Australia. Not surprisingly, the benefits for the</p>
<p>   bush, for country Australians, have bulked very large in the tax</p>
<p>   package. The changes we are making in relation to fuel taxes will</p>
<p>   reduce by $3.5 billion fuel costs throughout our country. And that</p>
<p>   will be of tremendous benefit to rural Australians because of the</p>
<p>   heavy component of fuel in their business costs. But let me remind</p>
<p>   you of something perhaps other business men and women in non rural</p>
<p>   areas don't understand and that is because of the changes we</p>
<p>   have made to the taxation of fuel, every litre of fuel used by somebody</p>
<p>   to run their business will after the introduction of this plan be</p>
<p>   seven cents a litre cheaper than what it is now. Because what we</p>
<p>   are doing is bringing the level of excise down to the extent necessary</p>
<p>   to accommodate the introduction of the GST so that there will be</p>
<p>   no increase in the price of fuel at the pump for any consumer. And</p>
<p>   because the GST is fully rebatable that means that every business</p>
<p>   operator, forget about whether you are in the bush or in the city,</p>
<p>   every business operator will find that their fuel for business purposes</p>
<p>   is seven cents a litre cheaper than what it is at present. </p>
<p>And of course the price at the pump for the ordinary</p>
<p>   Australian motorist will not go up at all. And in the context of</p>
<p>   what we have done for the bush, can I particularly thank and record</p>
<p>   the contribution of South Australian rural members, people like</p>
<p>   Neil Andrew and Alan Ferguson and Barry Wakelin who have worked</p>
<p>   so very hard to make certain that this package contains a proper</p>
<p>   recognition of the interests of country Australia. Because we've</p>
<p>   sought to make it a balanced package in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>   Not only balanced in the way in which it addresses the inadequacies</p>
<p>   of the present system and the way in which it looks after the interests</p>
<p>   of different family groupings in Australia but also balanced in</p>
<p>   the sense that it looks after the interests of country people as</p>
<p>   well as people who live in the big cities of Australia.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it does represent an historic</p>
<p>   change in the way in which our taxation system will operate. It</p>
<p>   represents the effort of a Government that is prepared to have a</p>
<p>   go to solve Australia's problems. We are not a Government that</p>
<p>   spends its time endlessly debating the theory of something. We are</p>
<p>   not a Government that spends its time indulging in issue politics</p>
<p>   or personality politics. We are a Government that from day one has</p>
<p>   sought to find solutions to Australia's problems. We inherited</p>
<p>   a financial mess and we have fixed it despite the obstruction of</p>
<p>   the Senate and the hostility of the Labor Party and sections of</p>
<p>   the media. We found an inadequate industrial relations system and</p>
<p>   we fixed that. We found an interest rate structure that was shutting</p>
<p>   young people out of buying their first home and we have fixed that.</p>
<p>   We have generated 300,000 new jobs, there is still more to be done</p>
<p>   on that front, but we are heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>But everyone in Australia knows, including Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   and Mr Evans that we can't go on forever with our present taxation</p>
<p>   system. In a couple of weeks time Mr Beazley is going to stand up</p>
<p>   and say, he has a plan. He is going to stand up and say, I couldn't</p>
<p>   find one in 13 years, but two weeks after the Liberals have produced</p>
<p>   theirs I have found a plan.</p>
<p>That's a great punch line. I mean, somebody</p>
<p>   who was at the senior levels of government for 13 years. I mean,</p>
<p>   he boasts about the fact that he has been a Minister longer than</p>
<p>   I was. All he is doing by that statement is reminding people of</p>
<p>   his inaction over 13 years. I mean Mr Beazley in 1985 supported</p>
<p>   the Keating 12.5 per cent consumption tax because he knew then,</p>
<p>   in a moment of Ministerial honesty, he knew then that it was the</p>
<p>   right thing to try and reform the system. But when Bob Hawke and</p>
<p>   Bill Kelty and Simon Crean pulled the rug under Keating's feet</p>
<p>   at the tax summit in 1985, Beazley obediently fell into line with</p>
<p>   Hawke and said, oh no, it's a terrible idea.</p>
<p>He knows, as we all know, that your supreme responsibility</p>
<p>   when you hold political power in this country is to use it for the</p>
<p>   good of your nation, and not for your own personal, political advantage.</p>
<p>   I know there are risks involved in unveiling a sweeping tax plan</p>
<p>   before an election. We all know that. But what is the point of holding</p>
<p>   office, what is the point of being Prime Minister unless you are</p>
<p>   prepared to use the authority of your office to do something that</p>
<p>   is good for the long term future of Australia.</p>
<p>So when Mr Beazley stand up in two or three weeks</p>
<p>   time and says, look you can have some goodies but you don't</p>
<p>   have to have any reform, deep down he won't believe it either,</p>
<p>   because he has been around long enough and he has seen enough of</p>
<p>   it at the top to know, that if you are really serious about taxation</p>
<p>   reform in this country, you have got to grab hold of the whole system</p>
<p>   and give it a proper shake and replace it with one that is fundamentally</p>
<p>   more efficient and fundamentally fairer. And one that reduces the</p>
<p>   costs of manufacturing, the costs of producing things in this country.</p>
<p>We are a great trading nation. We face a very hostile</p>
<p>   world environment. Asia is very difficult. It is economically ugly</p>
<p>   in many respects. And we have examples, look at Japan, eight or</p>
<p>   nine years ago. Japan knew it had to fix its banking system. And</p>
<p>   because it hasn't fixed its banking system, it is now regarded</p>
<p>   with concern by other countries that previously saw it as indisputably</p>
<p>   the second most powerful economy in the world. In a globalised world</p>
<p>   economy you cannot sit forever on your hands and ignore the need</p>
<p>   for economic reform, you don't have that option because the</p>
<p>   rest of the world will find you out. And Mr Beazley and his friends</p>
<p>   had 13 years to fix the Australian taxation system, and they left</p>
<p>   it in a real mess when we came to power. </p>
<p>Now we've had the courage and the guts and</p>
<p>   the vision to do something about it and we have done it in an integrated</p>
<p>   fashion. We have done it in a way that is fair. We will end forever</p>
<p>   with this new scheme the unseemly annual spectacle of Prime Ministers</p>
<p>   and Treasurers and Premiers never being able to agree. And of all</p>
<p>   the things that I have experienced in public life, there is nothing</p>
<p>   in a sense more debilitating than those mindless arguments we have</p>
<p>   every year. And we are all to blame and we therefore have a collective</p>
<p>   responsibility to do something about it. Now we have talked about</p>
<p>   it for years. But this Government is the first federal Government</p>
<p>   to invite the states in, back into the Federation financially. And</p>
<p>   that's what we are doing. The states have been shut out of</p>
<p>   the Federation for years financially. And now we are inviting them</p>
<p>   back in. And this is a historical reinvigorating and remaking of</p>
<p>   the Australian Federation.</p>
<p>And it is fitting that we should do so on the eve</p>
<p>   on the Centenary of the Australian Federation. We will celebrate</p>
<p>   that centenary on the 1st of January 2001. Six months</p>
<p>   earlier on the very eve of that we will implement a plan that will</p>
<p>   financially reinvigorate the Federation in a way that has been badly</p>
<p>   needed since the onset of uniform taxation during the War in 1942.</p>
<p>There are many things about this plan that give</p>
<p>   to me and to my colleagues an immense sense of conviction and excitement.</p>
<p>   We are doing something that is really important and is really good</p>
<p>   for our country. And that is the greatest thing about this plan.</p>
<p>   That particular description of the plan and what it represents is</p>
<p>   far more important than the individual bits of it. It is a plan</p>
<p>   for the 21st century; it is a plan that invests great</p>
<p>   faith in the Australian people. And it is a plan that will deliver</p>
<p>   to all Australians a better and a more secure and a more prosperous</p>
<p>   future. Thank you.</p>
