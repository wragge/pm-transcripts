CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER ACTU CONGRESS<br />
SYDNEY 12 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
Mr President, Delegates,<br />
Let me first, take this earliest opportunity to<br />
congratulate your President-elect on his election as<br />
leader of the great Australian trade union movement.<br />
I do that, first, Simon most sincerely, in the personal<br />
sense. But as one who had the privilege of being one of your<br />
predecessors, I do it with a deep sense of both the<br />
honour and the responsibility your colleagues have<br />
conferred upon you. And I know you share my view that<br />
the responsibilities involved in this office cannot be<br />
limited to the trade union movement alone; but,<br />
precisely because of the fundamental role of the union<br />
movement in the very fabric of this nation, must extend<br />
to the welfare of the Australian people as a whole.<br />
And I congratulate you, as Prime Minister of Australia<br />
and as leader of the Australian Labor Party; and in<br />
doing so, I reaffirm, without inhibition, with pride in<br />
the unique history, tradition and achievement of the<br />
Australian Labor movement, the solidarity between<br />
political Labor and industrial labor.<br />
And I believe that solidarity has never stood on firmer<br />
ground than it does today.<br />
Even more important, never in our movement's long<br />
' history has the un~ ity of purpose be: 3.. 9Ltical and<br />
industrial Labor been used so effectively, so<br />
constructively and so successfully in the interests of<br />
the Australian economy, the Australian people, and the<br />
Australian nation. </p>
<p>And in that achievement what we have achieved together<br />
over the last two and a half years no-one has played a<br />
more important part than your retiring President,<br />
Cliff Dolan.<br />
It was under his leadership of the ACTU that the Accord<br />
was developed and brought into being.<br />
It has been under his leadership that the Accord has<br />
worked sqmething our opponents and the scoffers and<br />
the cynics said could never happen.<br />
And it has worked because, under Cliff Dolan's<br />
leadership, the Australian trade union movement has<br />
honoured the undertakings he gave on its behalf, and has<br />
exercised the restraint and responsibility so essential<br />
for the purposes of the Accord and that too is<br />
something our opponents and the scoffers and the cynics<br />
said would never happen; and, of course in truth, was<br />
the last thing they ever wanted to happen.<br />
And the final week of his presidency has seen the<br />
renewal of the Accord.<br />
Cliff, this ' union movement you have served so long<br />
stands in your debt. The Labor Government is in your<br />
debt. Australia is in your debt.<br />
And let me say delegates, when the dust has settled and<br />
when the people of Australia come to look back at the<br />
events of the past week, it will not be that charade in<br />
Canberra the liberal leadership fiasco they will see<br />
as most important or relevant to their welfare, their<br />
families, their country.,<br />
It will be the renewal of the Accord the guarantee we<br />
have given them together, that we will continue to work<br />
together, and with the business community, and all<br />
sections of the Australian community, to sustain the,<br />
recovery, to maintain growth and fight inflation.<br />
Delegates, I emphasise the point I made to you at your<br />
1983 Congress the first time I acidressed'you as Prime<br />
Minister. I s ! i4 thcr-that it was not t' f*'-ctiJor. ef the Lh-or<br />
Government to be the handmaiden of the tradie union<br />
movem~ ent that our overriding~ rl s;-cr,. sibilities vreto<br />
the people of Australia as a whole.<br />
And that is how our relationship has been conducted in<br />
the past two years on the basis of co-operation,<br />
mutual respect, but never subservience. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Now delegates,<br />
We've heard a great deal about the relationship between<br />
the Australian Labor Government and the Australian union<br />
movement.<br />
With the lurch of the Liberal leadership to the<br />
reactionary Right, we are going to hear a great deal<br />
more nonsense about it.<br />
As I said) Defore, I make no apology for the solidarity<br />
of political and industrial Labor. It is an historic<br />
partnership that is now better than ever, working for<br />
the good of Australia.<br />
But for the moment setting that aside setting aside,<br />
for the sake of the argument, the most important single<br />
fact in Australian political history the fact is,<br />
delegates, that every Australian Government, Liberal as<br />
much as Labor, must have, of inescapable necessity, a<br />
relationship with the trade union movement.<br />
That is not a matter of choice.<br />
The only choice is what sort of relationship it is going<br />
to be.<br />
It is a choice of whether the relationship is to be<br />
positive or negative, constructive or destructive a<br />
choice between co-operation or confrontation.<br />
You know from experience delegates and the people of<br />
Australia know the difference that choice makes.<br />
And it's not only a difference in economic terms the<br />
difference between record growth or record unemployment.<br />
It's not only a difference in terms of industrial<br />
relations the deliberate fomentation of disputes Under<br />
the Fraser/ Howard approach and our achievement of<br />
record low industrial disputation.<br />
it is a difference that goes to the very fabric of the<br />
Australian society the difference between the<br />
deliberate setting of group against group, Australian<br />
Australian, or the CfrLwe s~ vs tained for<br />
more than two years to get Australians working together.<br />
And let one thing be made clear from the very beginning<br />
of this so-called new leadership and that is simply:<br />
there is nothing new about it.<br />
There is nothing new except the clarity with which we<br />
can see their real intentions: to cut waqes anO cut<br />
: sof all Australians. </p>
<p>-t<br />
In all its essentials, what is offered is a return to<br />
" their discredited past" all the worst and most<br />
disastrous aspects of the policies, which created<br />
Australia's worst economic crisis for fifty years.<br />
I repeat: the nostrums the snakeoil remedies, as<br />
Peter -Robinson put it in the Sun-Herald being trotted<br />
out under the' guise of a new Liberal leadership are<br />
not new.<br />
It is the regipe as before the methods and policies of<br />
the seven ye~ rs before March 1983.<br />
And at the heart of those policies lay the confrontation<br />
with the trade union movement, the attack on the<br />
arbitration system, the denigration of the Arbitration<br />
Commission and decisively and disastrously in July<br />
1981 the enforced abandonment of effective central<br />
wage fixing.<br />
And that is the precise approach being advocated by the<br />
new leadership, so-called.<br />
And what was the result? Another wage explosion,<br />
followed inevitably by a new bout of inflation, then<br />
the worst recession and the highest unemployment for<br />
fifty years culminating in a unique double:<br />
simultaneously, double-digit inflation and double-digit<br />
unemployment.<br />
No, delegates, they did better than that they scored<br />
the trifecta: double-digit inflation, double-digit<br />
unemployment, and zero growth.<br />
Or even better the quadrella: zero growth, record<br />
inflation, record unemployment and record industrial<br />
disputation. This was the magnificent result of policies which are<br />
now being revived as something new.<br />
As your President before 1980,' I had pleaded with them<br />
not to take that couirse and warned them of the<br />
inevitable consequences that without a system of wage<br />
indexation through. 1 central fixation there was no<br />
Possibility of cv:: iu tr&gt;.<br />
These people are not iust the Bourbo;, s of Australian<br />
politics; they are even more stupid.<br />
For if the Bourbons learnt nothing and forgot nothing,<br />
our opponents have learnt nothing and forgotten<br />
everything. </p>
<p>Well delegates, the people of Australia have learnt, and<br />
they have not forgotten.<br />
They know and remember that in the year before we came<br />
to government, 160,000 Australian jobs disappeared and<br />
unemployment increased by over one-quarter of a million.<br />
They remember that inflation reached more than twice the<br />
OECD average in the same period.<br />
Contrast this with the approach and performance of the<br />
Labor Government, a performance which has generated<br />
410,000, npw jobs.<br />
The central thrust of our approach has consistently been<br />
to develop policies based on a shared appreciation of<br />
our problems and of the way ahead to get Australians<br />
working together for the good of all Australians.<br />
Right from the outset we all were convinced that an<br />
effective prices and incomes policy was an essential<br />
condition for achieving sustained non-inflationary<br />
economic recovery. That was the basis of the Summit<br />
agreement between governments, business and unions.<br />
And, underpinned by the Accord and its associated<br />
machinery and policies, the extent of the recovery has<br />
exceeded the expectations of some of the most optimistic<br />
observers at the time.<br />
Our success to date far exceeds these expectations and<br />
amply demonstrates the manifest correctness of the<br />
Government's economic policy approach an approach<br />
based firmly on our Accord.<br />
During our period in office, Australia has experienced<br />
one of the strongest recoveries of all the OECD<br />
countries already over 12 percent growth through our<br />
first two years.<br />
In only three years we shall have achieved more real<br />
growth than our conservative predecessors did in their<br />
full seven years in office.<br />
Australia's strong growth has been the-key to the<br />
410,000 net:. jobs created since the Economic Summit in<br />
April 1983. In 27/ months we have created 70,000 more<br />
jobs than our pri._ i2e: SSOZ'S managed in their entire term<br />
in office a dismal 88 months. </p>
<p>And now we are moving confidently towards our goal of<br />
creating 500,000 jobs during our first three years of<br />
office. We are well on target.<br />
But delegates, let us at all times acknowledge and<br />
emphasis this:<br />
The Accord-goes far beyond being simply a unique and<br />
uniquely Australian method of controlling inflation<br />
and reducing unemployment. It is a complex of<br />
agreementrand understandings about economic and social<br />
goals for~. this nation the goals which are fundamental<br />
to Labor's vision for Australia.<br />
And it is this aspect of the Accord which makes our<br />
common commitment as a government, as a union movement<br />
so fundamental to Labor's cause. We reject a narrow<br />
commitment to growth for growth's sake. We embrace<br />
growth as the means to build a better, fairer Australia.<br />
The extent of our commitment was convincingly<br />
demonstrated again this week.<br />
I am, of course referring to the historic understanding<br />
reached last week following discussions between the<br />
Government and the ACTU wage negotiating committee over<br />
the agreed policy response to ensuring continued<br />
economic growth and maximising the jobs dividend from<br />
depreciation. I congratulate the trade union movement for your<br />
moderation and responsibility. You have shown your<br />
willingness to respond to the new policy challenges<br />
created by our dynamic economy. Clearly our prices and<br />
incomes Accord is both durable and flexible.<br />
I strongly commend your ratification of the Government's<br />
agreement with your ACTU wage negotiating committee.<br />
our agreement is hist oric in showing the flexibility<br />
inherent in the Accord an Accord which is able to deal<br />
with changed economic circumstances. And this manifest<br />
flexibility is a direct repudiation of those Jere* niahs<br />
who claimed that this Government's unique relationship<br />
with, the . ani-) ns was going to founder on the dollar's<br />
Inst -ad tni-,' enrcn and t-he union movement ' have agi<br />
demonstrated our shared commitment to responsible<br />
economic policies that lay the basis for sustained<br />
economic growth and jobs into the future. We have<br />
Australia's future uppermost in our minds. </p>
<p>Now that we have agreed on a way to handle the adverse<br />
effects of depreciation of the Australian dollar, we can<br />
take advantage of the golden opportunity that it<br />
provides to end the patterns produced by past poor<br />
competitiveness.<br />
This Agreement means two things above all else.<br />
First, it means that the economic recovery can continue.<br />
That means continued expansion in jobs on the pattern of<br />
the past two years.<br />
And in addition, it gi. ves our export and import<br />
competing industries a golden opportunity to benefit<br />
from the depreciation. Our manufacturing industries can<br />
increase their exports, and also the share of the<br />
domestic market that they supply. This alone could mean<br />
100,000 new jobs over time.<br />
Only with competitive industry can we Australians be<br />
sure that those now in jobs will be able to enjoy job<br />
security into the future.<br />
This is surely the fundamental objective of the Iabor<br />
movement the Labor Government and the trade, unions.<br />
You are aware that our agreement includes the provision<br />
that in April 1986 the cost of living adjustments to<br />
wages be reduced by some two percent to take account of<br />
depreciation-induced price rises.<br />
But we are not asking for a cut in real living<br />
standards. We will be supporting, before the<br />
Arbitration Commission, a claim for a three percent<br />
increase in remuneration in the coming productivity<br />
case, with that increase to be paid in the form of<br />
occupational superannuation over the two years from mid-<br />
1986. In addition and assuming that the remainder of the<br />
package is in place the government has agreed to<br />
modify its tax reform package. Income tax deductions<br />
suff:. ient to compensate workers for the two percent<br />
waae increase they have foregone will take effect from 1<br />
Se~.~ ber1986.<br />
Our new acreement avoids the inflationary consequences<br />
of 6c:: eciation an6 preserves our new competitive<br />
advantage. As part of our new agreement, the Government supports<br />
the extension of superannuation on an industry by<br />
industry or an occupation by occupation basis.<br />
_ E </p>
<p>8-<br />
We are agreed that such improvement will be offset<br />
against national productivity.<br />
The Government is committed to the establishment of<br />
genuine superannuation, and intend, after consultation<br />
with employers and unions, to establish a set of<br />
guide * lines covering the necessary features of genuine<br />
superannuation.<br />
These provisions will be the basis on which taxation<br />
concessions are provided for occupational superannuation<br />
and will be-' announced well before July 1986.<br />
Consistent with our commitment under the Accord the<br />
Government will legislate to establish a national safety<br />
net superannuation scheme. We shall provide for<br />
superannuation changes consistent with the productivity<br />
case outcome to our own employees.<br />
In seeking further restraint in the community, my<br />
Government is concerned that the burden of restraint<br />
should be spread equitably. For our part we will be<br />
seeking price restraint consistent with the wage<br />
restraint being sought from the trade union movement by<br />
our new agreement.<br />
As a counterpart to the continued adherence to the<br />
principle of no extra claims by the union movement that<br />
my Government expects, we will not support price<br />
increases which exceed general movements in costs. We<br />
will be instructing the Prices Surveillance Authority<br />
accordingly.<br />
A further part of the new agreement is the support by<br />
both parties to amendments to the current wage fixing<br />
principles in respect of:<br />
allowing claims for the reduction of standard hours,<br />
to 38 to be arbitrated; and<br />
a special review of the problems associated with<br />
the difference between paid rates and minimum rates<br />
awards, including zhe issues of supplementary<br />
payments and the ma-ing of paid rate awards.<br />
We expect to make appropriate submissions on these<br />
matters in the r( tv~ etw of Principles case in due course. </p>
<p>9-<br />
The continuing success of my Government in achieving the<br />
shared goals of continued economic growth and continual<br />
improvements in living standards for all Australians<br />
will depend crucially on a continuation of the cooperative<br />
and constructive relationship that exists<br />
between us.<br />
A crucial element of this process will be to ensure that<br />
our industries remain competitive in both domestic and<br />
world markets.<br />
We have already taken major initiatives in respect of<br />
the steel industry and the financial sector. Our<br />
policies will continue to ensure that we can continue<br />
this process of improving the efficiency of our<br />
industries through policies based on a clear<br />
understanding of common interests, of employee and<br />
employer.<br />
The success that has been achieved so far in economic<br />
recovery and social change is the clearest indication of<br />
what we can continue to achieve if we continue to work<br />
together and maintain our commitment to the Accord.<br />
Delegates, There has perhaps never been a juncture in our history<br />
when the need for a strong Labor Government and a strong<br />
trade union movement was so vital to the progress and<br />
prosperity of Australia.<br />
It follows therefore, that anything which detracts from<br />
the strength and standing of the trade union movement<br />
diminishes not only the strength and standing of the<br />
Labor Government but Australia's prospects for progress<br />
and prosperity.<br />
It is true that our political opponents have<br />
specifically announced their intention to weaken, if not<br />
indeed to destroy, that strength and that standing.<br />
And it is also true that the greatest source of the<br />
strength of the Australian union movement is its<br />
standing and reputation in the community and the support<br />
derived from the people of Australia, whether or not<br />
Ltiey are j: jic7i. eb ers.<br />
And all of us as unionists have a responsibility to be<br />
vigilant at all times to protect the reputation and<br />
standing of the trade union movement as a whole.<br />
In his address to you Cliff Dolan correctly touched upon<br />
some of the sources, actual and potential, of anti-<br />
. u-niIsr in tlis country. </p>
<p>10<br />
And it is one of the great paradoxes of our age that at<br />
a time when the Australian trade union movement has<br />
demonstrated in the clearest possible way its capacity<br />
for restraint and responsibility and at a time when that<br />
restraint and responsibility has produced great benefits<br />
for the whole nation, the union movement should be the<br />
target of such tactics.<br />
But let me say frankly delegates, as one whose whole<br />
career is inextricably linked with this movement and its<br />
great cause, it is not the Howards and the Bjelke-<br />
Petersens tltat we have to fear for the reputation and<br />
standing of the trade union movement, in the eyes of the<br />
people of Australia.<br />
The thing which is most calculated to discredit the<br />
whole union movement and weaken public support for<br />
unionism that public support which is so necessary for<br />
the movement's success and survival is the intrusion<br />
of the tactics of intimidation and even violence. They<br />
are tactics which of their very nature are anti-union<br />
and anti-worker. They have no place in the Australian<br />
union movement.<br />
And this Labor Government makes no apology for acting as<br />
it has done to root out violence and intimidation and to<br />
protect the reputation, the standing, the solidarity, of<br />
this great Labor movement of Australia.<br />
But the really important thing dele gates, is that as a<br />
Government and a movement we must not permit ourselves<br />
to be diverted from the great tasks ahead neither by<br />
the disruptive tactics of mavericks, or the diversionary<br />
tactics of our opponents.<br />
Your Congress this week has made a magnificent<br />
contribution to the reputation, standing and solidarity<br />
of the Labor movement.<br />
You have overwhelmingly endorsed the renewal of the<br />
Accord. That is the most resounding reply you could have given<br />
to the cynics and scoffers who said that the Accord<br />
wouliJ never work, that it cannot last, and that the<br />
tral? n,., vement w~ ould be incaoahlle, in the long<br />
haul, of the foresight and responsibility involved in<br />
making~ the P. ccord work.<br />
And you have given a resounding rebuff to our political<br />
opponents who have placed the destruction of the Accord<br />
and the principles which underpin it at the very head of<br />
their own agenda. </p>
<p>11'-<br />
But far more important delegates, you have said to the<br />
people of Australia in the clearest terms, that this<br />
great union movement will continue to make the maximum<br />
contribution to the sustained economic recovery and will<br />
continue to play its part in the fight against<br />
inflation.<br />
Delegates, It is exactly ten years to the day that I spoke to you<br />
at your Congress, as your President, in these terms:<br />
I say to.' Oyou that our affiliates must<br />
recognisd the full implications of their<br />
actions. It is essential that the selfinterest<br />
of particular groups be balanced<br />
against the interests of workers as a whole.<br />
That, after all, is what trade unionism is<br />
finally about. And there is no doubt that<br />
their paramount interests are to be protected<br />
from rising unemployment and high inflation.<br />
As responsible leaders we are bound to provide<br />
that protection. No rhetoric, or perceived<br />
provocation, should divert us from the basic<br />
duty.<br />
Delegates,<br />
Your renewal of the Accord this week stands as testimony<br />
that those words of mine ten years ago expressed the<br />
true spirit of this great Australian union movement.<br />
And those words remain as true and relevant today as<br />
they were ten years ago, despite the tremendous changes<br />
since then and the transformation in Australia's<br />
prospects. By following the principles I stated then, as you have<br />
done so constructively for the past two and a half years<br />
and as this Congress has undertaken to continue, you<br />
have not only served the best interests of the working<br />
men and women of Australia you represent, but the grEat<br />
cause of the Australian Labor mo~ vement, which, in thE<br />
final analysis, is the cause of the people of Austrii </p>
