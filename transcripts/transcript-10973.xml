<p>Mr Kim Beazley the Leader of the Opposition, my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues, your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Only an Irish President could still the guns of political battle in the middle of an Australian election campaign. And bring the leader of the Liberal Party and the leader of the Australian Labor Party together in a spontaneous expression of welcome and affection to the President of a country held in deep and affectionate regard by all Australians.</p>
<p>It is not true to say that Ireland and Irish men and women have influenced Australia. Rather, it is true to say that Ireland and Irish values and Irish habits and Irish people have been part of the Australian story and have played a formative role in shaping the modern Australia from the very beginning of European settlement more than 200 years ago.</p>
<p>I don't intend today to list all of those great Australians of Irish decent who have made a contribution to our country. In a sense that would be doing injustice to the role that Ireland has played and the parts that the Irish influence has [inaudible] in the Australian story. Because every part of Australian life and every part of Australian culture, every part of Australian politics, Australian religion and Australian values have been influenced and fashioned and tempered and led and guided and in some areas dominated by the Irish tradition and by Irish habits.</p>
<p>Irish traditions have brought a sentimentality, they've brought</p>
<p>a passion, they've brought a sense of conflict, they've</p>
<p>also brought a sense of unity and a sense of striving and a sense</p>
<p>of achieving to the Australian story. Indeed, in that great work the</p>
<p>Australian historian, Patrick O'Farrell, on the Irish in Australia</p>
<p>I thought spoke very eloquently of the history of the interaction</p>
<p>between the various groups who originally comprise European Australia.</p>
<p>When he wrote of the contest between Irish oriented minority and English</p>
<p>oriented majority, far from being divisive, became the main unifying</p>
<p>principle of Australian history. What held this country's people</p>
<p>together in a constructive and productive social and political relationship</p>
<p>was a continuing debate always vigorous, often bitter and sometimes</p>
<p>even violent about what kind of country this should be. The tension</p>
<p>and conflict between minority and majority was not in its essence</p>
<p>or effects a fundamentally destructive one but a creative exchange</p>
<p>which compelled Australia's inhabitants of all kinds and all</p>
<p>persuasions to take stock of the nature of their society.</p>
<p>So Madam President, you come to this country as really part of the</p>
<p>family. You come to this country as the President of a nation that</p>
<p>has contributed so much to the history of Australia and to the development</p>
<p>of Australia and is held in continuing affectionate regard. You also</p>
<p>come to this country as a very talented and successful person who</p>
<p>has reached the highest office in Ireland. A person whose distinguished</p>
<p>legal and academic career pays tribute to your innate intelligence,</p>
<p>your sense of justice and your patriotic commitment. You also bring</p>
<p>particular characteristics to the Presidency of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>You are, I understand, the first person born in Northern Ireland to</p>
<p>be elected President of the Republic of Ireland. You told me earlier</p>
<p>during our discussions that you grew up in the Shankhill Road district</p>
<p>of Belfast being a member of the only Catholic family in the street</p>
<p>and you related some of the mixed experiences that were metered out</p>
<p>to your family when you were growing up  the good as well as</p>
<p>the bad.</p>
<p>I hope you find on this your first visit to Australia the most influential</p>
<p>representation of the Irish Diaspora anywhere in the world. One of</p>
<p>the pursuits, of course, of many Australians is to reflect increasingly</p>
<p>now because we are getting a lot more interested in our history and</p>
<p>our heritage. We reflect a lot more on our background now than we</p>
<p>used to. I think about a third of Australians claim Irish decent or</p>
<p>a connection with Ireland. And not, of course, to be left out of it</p>
<p>and I might remind you Madam President that my maternal great grandmother,</p>
<p>Theresa Carey, was born in county Westmeath in the Irish Republic.</p>
<p>And before getting too carried away with that let me remind you that</p>
<p>my paternal great grandfather, Christopher Jackson, was born in Portadown</p>
<p>county Armagh, north of the border.</p>
<p>It is true that the people of Irish decent in this country in earlier</p>
<p>days, because they were a minority, did suffer a level of discrimination</p>
<p>and a level of bigotry which is now, thankfully, long behind us. Sectarian</p>
<p>bigotry in Australia was a live thing, I think, until the 1960s when</p>
<p>in a remarkable way in a very short period of time it collapsed very,</p>
<p>very rapidly. I think it was the influence of the second Vatican Council</p>
<p>and of Pope John. I like to believe it was a common belief that it</p>
<p>was no longer Christian to be bigoted against those who also professed</p>
<p>your religion. And I also recognise the very significant role played</p>
<p>in the breaking down of that sectarian divide in Australia by the</p>
<p>ending in the early 1960s of the 100-year prohibition on the provision</p>
<p>of government assistance to independent schools. Because of all the</p>
<p>swords that divided Irish Catholic Australia from the rest of the</p>
<p>Australian population it was the sense of injustice that Catholics</p>
<p>properly felt, Irish Catholics in the main they were then, properly</p>
<p>felt about the denial of State aid. And I am particularly proud as</p>
<p>the Leader of the Liberal Party in 1998 that it was that self-described</p>
<p>humble Presbyterian Robert Gordon Menzies, of good Scottish stock</p>
<p>who played such a major role in providing government assistance to</p>
<p>independent schools in the 1960s. The influence of Irish Australians</p>
<p>on our politics has been immense. It has probably been historically</p>
<p>deeper on the Australian Labor Party and I won't presume as my</p>
<p>colleague, Kim Beazley, is here today to speak at length on that.</p>
<p>I recollected a moment ago to some friends that I joined the Liberal</p>
<p>Party in 1958 and the Liberal Party that I joined in 1958 was a profoundly</p>
<p>Protestant party, yet the Liberal Party I led into Government in 1996</p>
<p>represented in the most complete sense all sections of the Australian</p>
<p>community. And the thing that I rejoice in is that those old divides</p>
<p>are gone and that we learnt as Australians because of the experience</p>
<p>of living in this vast continent of the need to work with each other</p>
<p>and to find common ground with each other perhaps earlier than some</p>
<p>other countries have been able to do.</p>
<p>Madam President, you carry with you to this visit of course a reminder</p>
<p>of the tremendous strides that have been made towards achieving a</p>
<p>lasting peace in Northern Ireland. I want to take the opportunity</p>
<p>of congratulating the Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland, Bertie</p>
<p>Ahern, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, for the</p>
<p>way in which they have worked together tirelessly over the last couple</p>
<p>of years to bring about a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>What has occurred in that troubled province over the last 30 years</p>
<p>of course has been appalling. It comes on top of long years of injustice</p>
<p>and unfairness, and we've long passed the time when we seek to</p>
<p>apportion blame on one side or the other. There are evil men and women</p>
<p>on both sides of that argument. Those who perpetrated the terrible</p>
<p>deaths of those three young children, and those who perpetrated the</p>
<p>bomb outrage at Omagh, stand equally condemned in the eyes of the</p>
<p>civilised world. No amount of tribal history or division and no amount</p>
<p>of past injustice can justify such current abominations and atrocities</p>
<p>and out of those terrible deeds one is comforted, if you can be comforted,</p>
<p>by the hope that perhaps there is at last a realisation that the only</p>
<p>path forward is down the road of peace. And the evident goodwill that</p>
<p>is being displayed by both the British and Irish governments, the</p>
<p>determination of religious leaders, both Catholic and Protestant within</p>
<p>the whole of Ireland to emphasise the brotherhood of man, rather than</p>
<p>old sectarian divisions. The warm good wishes you have from your friends</p>
<p>all around the world, and I acknowledge the contribution of my predecessor,</p>
<p>Mr Keating, when he was Prime Minister in pledging some $7 million</p>
<p>to the fund to help build better community relations in Northern Ireland,</p>
<p>a pledge that I was very pleased as then Opposition Leader to support.</p>
<p>There are many Australians who want lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>We want it because we see it as a piece of sort of unfinished, I suppose,</p>
<p>family business. We also want it because it will be a source of hope</p>
<p>and inspiration to the rest of the world, that long tribal discord</p>
<p>can finally be put behind even in the most acrimonious of circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, I want to take this opportunity of very strongly reaffirming</p>
<p>on behalf of the Australian Government our commitment to the peace</p>
<p>process. But I also want to say that on a personal level, that I do</p>
<p>hope, Madam President, that you and your husband greatly enjoy your</p>
<p>visit to Australia. You will find warmth, you will find affection,</p>
<p>you will find a spontaneity of welcome that I don't think would</p>
<p>be extended to any other Head of State of another country.</p>
<p>You also of course, come in the lead up to a great Australian festival</p>
<p> not the federal election on the 3rd of October </p>
<p>but rather a festival that takes place a week before that, and the</p>
<p>last weekend in September in Australia is a great football festival,</p>
<p>in which we play out the Australian Rules Grand Final, and of course,</p>
<p>Australian Rules has much of its antecedents, not all of it, in Gaelic</p>
<p>football, and of course we also play out the Grand Final of Rugby</p>
<p>League. And both of those codes, both in terms of the derivatives,</p>
<p>the origins of Australian Rules, and I think in relation to Rugby</p>
<p>League historically the participation levels, both of those codes</p>
<p>have very very strong Irish connections and very very strong Irish</p>
<p>antecedents.</p>
<p>Madam, you are very welcome. We send through you our affectionate</p>
<p>good wishes to the people of Ireland, and it is a special relationship.</p>
<p>It cannot properly be categorised in terms of influence or tabulations</p>
<p>of Australians with Irish names. It is part of what we are. It is</p>
<p>part of our essence and our being and for that reason we are particularly</p>
<p>happy to have you amongst us, and invite Kim Beazley the Leader of</p>
<p>the Opposition, to support my remarks.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
