8 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP BEFORE ADDRESS TO ASIA SOCIETY SYDNEY<br />
E O E<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't comment on the direction of interest rates, never,<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you happy to see the recovery in the employment....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The employment figures are good, they are very strong. Based on those figures we<br />
have created about 122 000 jobs since being elected in March of last year. So based<br />
on the month, they are very nice, they are very strong figures and they show a very<br />
pleasing rise in employment, particularly for women.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard how concerned are you that the National Party can...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They can't, it's the Government's plan.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it can't be defeated if the Government endorses it and the Government has<br />
endorsed it and I'm sure it will be supported in the partyroom. Can I just make it very<br />
clear that I have no intention of backing off this ten point plan. The fact that it is<br />
being attacked from all sides proves how fair it is. You always know when you've got<br />
it right when all of the people involved have a bit of a grizzle. What's happened on<br />
this occasion is that I've struck a fair balance between the need to respect native title<br />
and also the need to give certainty and security to the farmers and pastoralists of<br />
Australia. JOURNALIST: Does your plan allow for extinguishment as some members of the National Party are<br />
claiming? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
My plan has always allowed for extinguishment of native title in circumstances where<br />
the High Court says it is extinguished.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about pastoral leases though?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pastoral leases under my plan do not extinguish native title unless those pastoral leases<br />
confer exclusive possession and that is what the law has always been and that is what<br />
the law was as declared by the High Court.. But could I just make it very clear, the<br />
change that was made to the wording of the plan did not add anything at all. All it did<br />
was to make exclusive what was already implicit. And any suggestion by any<br />
suggestion by anybody that in some way there was a huge change made, or indeed any<br />
change, is nonsense. I think what you have at the moment is that some people are<br />
playing word games in order to explain away their behaviour and explain away their<br />
conduct. But I haven't given any grounds in relation to the 10 Point Plan. But I do<br />
want to make it clear that I don't need to because it gives the pastoralists all the<br />
security and all the protection and all the guarantees that they reasonably need and<br />
reasonably require.<br />
JOURNALIST: So when the National Party says that you've made major changes, they're wrong?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Absolutely wrong. I don't hear Mr Fischer saying that and as far as I'm concerned Mr<br />
Fischer is the National Party. I should make it clear that we listen to our party </p>
<p>organisations but the Liberal and National parties at the end of the day the<br />
parliamentary parties decide what has happened.. . what happens. And Tim Fischer and<br />
I are completely in agreement on this.<br />
JOURNALIST: But isn't Mr Fischer ( inaudible) position? One day he says that he rejects the 10 Point<br />
Plan, the next minute he's forced to endorse it as a member of Cabinet.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think Tim Fischer has tried to put a point of view on behalf of his party and many of<br />
the points that have been put on behalf of his party have always been part and parcel of<br />
our intentions. The only major difference is on the question of blanket extinguishment<br />
and I have said all along that is not part of our plan. It never has been part of our plan.<br />
It is not part of our plan. It would cost the Australian taxpayer enormous amounts of<br />
money. It would produce constitutional challenges. It would tie individual properties<br />
up in the courts for years and they are some of the reasons why they haven't been<br />
included. But our plan will protect the rights of pastoralists. It has not been altered.<br />
It won't be altered. And it remains the embodiment of the best and fairest way of<br />
handling this, admittedly, very difficult issue.<br />
ends </p>
