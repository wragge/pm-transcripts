CHECK AGAINST DrLIVF. RY-BEFOE 11 A ( EST)<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
OFFICIAL OPEHIN~ G OF THE CRITICAL FACILITY AT THE<br />
ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION,<br />
LUCAS HEIGHTS, SYDNEY<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Pt. Hon. William McMahon,<br />
CH, T-P 19 JU11E 1972<br />
Twelve years ago, my distinguished friend and<br />
colleague, Sir Robert Menzies, spoke here on a similar occasion.<br />
And he said he helieved Lucas H~ eights was a significant event in<br />
our national development. And he went on to forecast that this<br />
establishment would produce many practical results for Australia.<br />
Sir Robert was, of course, referring particularly to the role of<br />
Lucas Heights in developing the technical experience we will need<br />
when the time comes for Australia to embark on a commercial<br />
nuclear power nrrrumm.<br />
It is pretty well accepted now that by the end of<br />
the seventies, one or more of our State generating authorities<br />
will be building a nuclear power plant. Thereafter, more will<br />
follow. It is not too much to say that if events develop as<br />
predicted, Australia could be involved in a ver * y large capital<br />
investment in nuclear power plants before the end of the century.<br />
DHany of you are well aware of how essential it will<br />
be that we go into such a programme equipped with sound technical<br />
advice about the efficiency and safety of reactors and other<br />
nuclear facilities. This critical facility is, I am told, a powerful tool<br />
for making studies directly related to this objective. The machine<br />
was built by a French engineering~ firm, , working with Australian<br />
industry and the Commission's scientists and engineers.<br />
Our recent agreemaent with Japan will also be important<br />
to our understanding of the future application of atomic energy<br />
for peaceful purooses. We also co-operate with the United Kingdom,<br />
the United States and Canada.<br />
It will be seen, therefore, that the leading nations<br />
of the world in the extraordinarily complex field of nuclear<br />
energy have been willing to share the benefits of their work with<br />
US. ./ 2 </p>
<p>We occupy a seat on the Board of Governors of the<br />
International Atomic E~ nergy Agency as the nation most advanced in<br />
atomic energy in the South-East Asia and the Pacific region. But<br />
we do not have the technical nor financial resources even to attempt<br />
to take a place in the forefront of nuclear reactor development,<br />
and if I may be allowed to emphasise it here, today, there is no<br />
reason why we should seek to dIO so.<br />
But we do make our contribution to the pool of<br />
atomic energy knowledgre, and we do help our Asian and Pacific<br />
neighbours through the loan of technical ex ' perts and equipment. We<br />
also receive Agency and Colomnbo Plan fellows for training and<br />
experience in nuclear matters.<br />
This new facility will both contribute to our<br />
objectives and extend our ability to collaborate with other<br />
countries. For these reasons I am glad to have the opportunity<br />
to open it today. My colleague, Sir Reginald Swartz, has already<br />
reminded us of the benefits which are flowing to the community from<br />
this centre. In the years to come, nuclear energy will help ease<br />
our power problems. Most industrially advanced countries are now<br />
either building nuclear power stations, or preparing to do so.<br />
More than 100 plants are already in service and about twice as<br />
many are being built or are on order.<br />
We can expect nuclear Dower in the 1980' s'and<br />
to account for an increasing proportion of Australia's new<br />
generating capacity. On a per capita basis, we have one of the<br />
fastest rising power demands in the world. one estimate that has<br />
been given to me is that by the end of this century, one-third of<br />
our electricity could come from nuclear stations. It is claimed<br />
that by that time more than 50 per cent of the world's electricity<br />
could Le so supplied. Such predictions have major implications in such<br />
diverse fields as foreign affairs, finance, industry and commerce.<br />
Within the Atomic Energy Comrmission, we have the experts to advise<br />
on all technical aspects of nuclear power. They have done wideranging<br />
research into all aspects of the control of radiation from<br />
nuclear installations. And over a long period, they have made<br />
close and careful investigations of possible effects on the environment,<br />
including on marine life, and on flora and fauna.<br />
But uranium is not only an industrial material. It<br />
is a strategic material of high importance that involves the Commonwealth<br />
in certain obligations. Every country in the world which<br />
produces or uses fissile material imposes Government control for<br />
considerations of national security, and to honour international<br />
obligations, Australia must do likewise. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Before our first uower station is built, there<br />
must be a necessary framework of regulations and administrative<br />
practices to provide such controls. We arc working constructively<br />
with the States to achieve thes~ e objectives. Thcre can be no<br />
better means of ensuring thait nuclear power will be introduced to<br />
Australia on a safe, economic and responsible basis.<br />
it is clear from what I have said that Australia's<br />
role in nuclear energy is concerned with its peaceful uses. The<br />
harnessing of this great force of energy for the benefit of mankind<br />
is one of the areatest challenges of this generation.<br />
The task is twofold: We must learn to use the<br />
technology in peaceful pursuits, and we must contain and eventually<br />
dissuaqe its potential uses for warfare and destruction.<br />
it is difficult for some people to accept that in<br />
the modern world even in cases where there arise differences on<br />
certain major issues there can still be co-operation on others.<br />
For example, the United States and the Soviet Union hold basic<br />
differences on many great international issues. Yet President<br />
Nixon and Mr Brezhnev were able last month to make a major step<br />
forward in the vital field of world disarmament.<br />
They have slowed down the nuclear arms race, and<br />
they have done it in the cnntext-%. of maintaining a balance of<br />
strategic interests. I sent a message of warm congratulation to<br />
Mr Nixon for this achievement.<br />
I would like to go back a little on Australia's<br />
record in these matters, because this is an area in which I very<br />
sincerely regret to say that France has failed to respond, despite<br />
our co-operation in other areas.<br />
Many years ago, in 1963, a partial nuclear test<br />
ban treaty was concluded. Australia took its stand when it ratified<br />
that treaty. It specifically bans tests in the atmosphere, outer<br />
space and under water. It is unmistakeably clear that our present<br />
attitude is not a nev, one.<br />
Our attitude at the Plenary Session at Stockholm<br />
was in accordance with long-existing policy. When the Australian<br />
Government ratified the partial test ban treaty, it was strongly<br />
opposed to the conduct of tests of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere,<br />
wherever they occurred. This remains our strong policy. It is<br />
therefore completely wrong to say that a new policy was developed<br />
at Stockholm. In line with our long-standing policy, we have<br />
repeatedly conveyed to the French Government, as you, Your<br />
Excellency, have repeated and confirmed, through the proper channels<br />
and in the most unequivocal terms the firm opposition of the<br />
Australian Government and peonple to the French nuclear tests in<br />
the Pacific. / 4 </p>
<p>Australia was the first country to protest against<br />
these tests in 1972. AMnd we have repeated those protests. We<br />
will continue to do so, by whatever means are properly avajable to<br />
us to exert whatever pressures we can to bring about a cessation<br />
of these tests and all atmospheric nuclear tests for all time.<br />
The Austialian Government is dedicated to upholding<br />
the partial nuclear test ban treaty. That is our policy; it has<br />
not changed. We will continue to work within the framework of<br />
international negotiation and consultation with the United States<br />
and others so vitally concerned with the difficult technical issues<br />
underlying questions of world peace, including a more comprehensive<br />
treaty. But central to our policy is a clear and frank<br />
unqualified opposition to atmospheric testing. Let there be no<br />
misunderstanding on this score. I and my Government want the<br />
present tests abandoned. Further, we have taken every reasonable step we<br />
can to persuade our French friends to cease them. You will be<br />
aware, Mr Ambassador, that I have already conveyed personally to<br />
the President of France the views that I have now expressed.<br />
And I want to confirm to yo~ u that none of the<br />
explanations you have given would in any way, in any shape at<br />
all, change my, or my Government's attitude, or the Australian<br />
people's attitude, to the atmospheric testing by any country.<br />
And I say this, notwithdranding the comments you have made about<br />
the protests that have been made by my Government to your<br />
Government itself. This Facility I am opening today is, I emphasise,<br />
designed for peaceful purposes. It will assist our researchers<br />
to develo in co-operation with the States, our capacity to use<br />
nuclear energy for the generation of electric power.<br />
So I am glad to have the opportunity of officially<br />
opening this Facility, and at the same time to be able to set out<br />
the Government's reasons for building it. It will undoubtedly be<br />
an essential tool for our research workers, and I have now much<br />
pleasure in declaring it open. </p>
