VCHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY PRIME MINISTER TO BUSINESS<br />
PERSONS' LUNCH<br />
ADELAIDE FESTIVAL CENTRE 18 APRIL 1984<br />
When the Federal Labor Government was elected a little over<br />
a year ago, the central challenge vie faced was the challenge<br />
of economic recovery.<br />
Looking back over the past year, tie are clearly entitled to<br />
claim that outstanding progress has already been made.<br />
But to appreciate fully that progress you have to cast your<br />
minds back to the appalling economic legacy we inherited.<br />
Twelve months ago Australia was in a grip of what can only<br />
be described as an economic crisis.<br />
Unemployment had risen by a quarter of a million in the<br />
previous year.<br />
The economy was experiencing negative economic growth for<br />
the first time in 30 years.<br />
Australia was in the grip of the worst recession for<br />
y ea rs<br />
That was our legacy.<br />
But now, twelve months later, there has been an<br />
extraordinary turnaround by any Standards.<br />
The economic recovery<br />
The national economy, which contracted in the first half of<br />
last year, grew remarkably in the s3econd half of 1983.<br />
This resurgence of economic growth has brought with it<br />
renewed growth in job opportunitie! 3.<br />
Indeed employment levels have risen by 210,0010 since April<br />
last year, compared with a fall of nearly 200,000 over the<br />
previous year.<br />
I </p>
<p>The unemployment rate has dropped from its peak level of<br />
10.4 per cent to 9.3 per cent in March.<br />
Inflation is falling, profits are picking up and business<br />
confidence is returning.<br />
The economic recovery has begun.<br />
And that's not just the Government's view.<br />
It is now the consensus right around Australia..<br />
What is also clear is that South Australia has performed<br />
particularly well in the national recovery.<br />
South Australia has seen a welcome lift in consumer<br />
confidence and retail sales, a much needed recovery in the<br />
State's rural sector and the strongest recovery in the<br />
housing industry of any State.<br />
The economic recovery, both here in South Australia and<br />
nationally, has been due to a combination of factors.<br />
The improvement in the United States' economy and the<br />
breaking of the drought have played a part.<br />
But no reasonable person now doubts3 the contribution to the<br />
recovery made by the economic policies of the Federal<br />
Government. Our budgetary policies have given -the Australian economy a<br />
much needed, but carefully controlled, economic stimulus.<br />
Our wages policy, centred on the Prices and Incomes Accord,<br />
has given business the firm prospect of long term wages<br />
moderation. Our housing policies have played a major role in the housing<br />
recovery. And we have brought back to economic policy the vital<br />
ingredients of stability and continuity ingredients so<br />
lacking under our predecessors.<br />
But it is one thing to get the economic recovery underway.<br />
It is quite another to sustain it and to sustain it not<br />
just for 6 or 12 months but year after year.<br />
The Government does not for a moment underestimate how<br />
difficult that task is going to be.<br />
All our policies will be directed, above all, to that<br />
o b jec t ive<br />
A balanced, responsible fiscal policy is g] oing to be very<br />
important. </p>
<p>So too will be a coherent, workable wages policy.<br />
In fact wages policy will be critical.<br />
The last thing Australia needs is a wages surge that will<br />
choke off the economic recovery.<br />
However, that's what the Opposition has effectively proposed<br />
for Australia with their wages policy released on Monday.<br />
That wages policy would promote a wages explosion led by the<br />
best organised sections of the labour movement and at the<br />
same time threaten the living standards of more, vulnerable<br />
workers. The Opposition's wages policy would divide Australia.<br />
It would return this country to the politics of<br />
confrontation, the politics of division which they inflicted<br />
on the people of Australia in government.<br />
If you need any proof of this, you only have to consider Mr<br />
Macphee's admission on Monday that initially their wages<br />
policy could provoke an increase in industrial strife in<br />
Australia. Is there anything more ridiculous than an Industrial<br />
Relations Shadow Minister proclaiming policies that could<br />
provoke more strikes, especially at a time when we are<br />
seeking to develop a stable framework for medium and<br />
longer-term growth?<br />
Last year under this Government Australia had the lowest<br />
level of strikes for 16 years.<br />
But the Opposition want to throw all that away.<br />
For * years we heard Liberal and National Party Ministers call<br />
upon the unions to accept the umpire's decision.<br />
Now they want to mug the umpire.<br />
They want to abolish the Arbitration Commission.<br />
They want to undermine the Arbitration system.<br />
They want to throw consensus and cooperation out the window.<br />
And they're prepared to attack the very fabric of our<br />
society to do it.<br />
This country has had enough of confrontation.<br />
It's had enough of divisiveness.<br />
What Australia needs is what we've given it a wages policy<br />
that puts the mistakes of the past behind US and looks to<br />
the future. </p>
<p>Our wages policy has put Australia on the path of recovery.<br />
This recovery simply could not survive the wages explosion<br />
and industrial disputation that would inevitably follow any<br />
attempt to implement the Opposition's policies.<br />
The IndustrialChallenge<br />
There is a further matter of policy that in the long term is<br />
going to be as vital as any other.<br />
That is the requirement for a rational, forward-looking<br />
industry policy.<br />
For a decade there has been widespread concern about<br />
deep-seated problems in Australia's manufocturing industry.<br />
The general economic recovery is taking pressure off much of<br />
Australian manufacturing industry but underlying weaknesses<br />
remain.<br />
Manufacturing is not providing the growith opportunities that<br />
it should.<br />
It is not providing the export opportunities that it should.<br />
It is not providing the job opportunities that it should.<br />
But if that is particularly true of manufacturing it is also<br />
true to a greater or lesser extent of the rest of the<br />
economy as well.<br />
For years indeed decades the Australian economy has not<br />
been able to take advantage of the opportunities for<br />
sustained, high level growth that have been open to us.<br />
And Australia has been very much the worse: for it.<br />
Over the last two or three decades Australia's per capita<br />
economic growth has been significantly below the average of<br />
OECD countries.<br />
In 1960 Australia was in 7th place among OECD countries in<br />
terms of per capita GDP.<br />
In 1975 we were in 10th Place.<br />
By 1980 we were fifteenth.<br />
Our relative economic performance has not been impressive.<br />
This is despite our enormous natural resources, despite our<br />
highly skilled labour force and despite the adva2ntages of<br />
our geographic location in the Western Pacific region, the<br />
most dynamic part of the world trading system. </p>
<p>The OECD has estimated that economic grovith in 1984 in<br />
Australia will be stronger than in any other OECD country.<br />
Wie have begun to reverse the slide but what is needed is an<br />
improved performance over a long period.<br />
Clearly we as a nation have not been good at seizing<br />
opportunities. We have not been good at managing the future.<br />
And nowhere is this clearer than in the type of industrial<br />
structures that we have allowed to develop over.-the years.<br />
With notable exceptions much Australian industry, including<br />
manufacturing industry, has been passive, defensive,<br />
inwiard-looking and generally not attuned to the<br />
opportunities for growth that have been opening up around<br />
US. However, this legacy of the past is also a challenge for the<br />
future.<br />
That challenge is:<br />
to transform our industrial structures over the<br />
coming years and decades and<br />
to make Australian industry, including<br />
manufacturing industry, more dynamic, flexible and<br />
o u tward -1001
Rather than turning our backs on change and clinging to the<br />
past, we as a nation need to face up to change and make our<br />
own future.<br />
And Australia's future lies very much in this part of the<br />
worl~ d the Asia Pacific Region, the most economically<br />
dynamic, fastest-growing part of the world.<br />
We need to progressively open up our naticinaleconomy and to<br />
link ourselves more and more with the dynamic economic<br />
growth that is occurring around us.<br />
We also need an industry policy framework that will help<br />
achieve this, that will foster an expanding, competitive,<br />
export-orientated industrial base.<br />
The First Steps<br />
Australia, Of Course, cannot switch paths overnight.<br />
The Federal Government sees its initial task as fostering a<br />
dialogue on change and creating a climate for a new approach<br />
to industry policy. </p>
<p>The community as a whole needs to be part of this ongoing<br />
dialogue. As the community comes to appreciate the reed for change the<br />
Government will be able to move more quickly to manage<br />
change. The Federal Government has already begun the task of<br />
redirecting industry policy.<br />
The Government has established a Special Group of Ministers<br />
to coordinate work in areas relevant to structural change in<br />
the economy.<br />
These areas include trade, education, training, science and<br />
technology, employment and industrial relations and defence<br />
support. The Group is chaired b~ y the Minister for Industry and<br />
Commerce, Senator Button. Other Ministers are Mr Bowen, Mr<br />
Willis, Senator Ryan, Mr Jones and Mr Howe.<br />
The Group is receiving strong backing from a study group of<br />
senior officials established to facilitate its work.<br />
These officials have been chosen not as dejartmental<br />
representatives but because of their special skills and<br />
experience. I envisage the work of the Group of Minist3rs will form an<br />
important element in policies to revitalize Australian<br />
industry. The Government has also initiated highly constructive<br />
discussions of industry policy in the Economic Planning<br />
Advisory Council ( EPAC).<br />
Following its meeting on 12 March this year, EPAC issued a<br />
statement on medium to long-term economic policy.<br />
In that statement EPAC called for an active industry<br />
development strategy for Australia.<br />
That strategy, EPAC said, should:<br />
give encouragement and opportunities to plan and<br />
invest to industries or enterprises involved in<br />
expansion of competitive production<br />
improve and provide more efficiently the<br />
infrastructure for industry development and<br />
give workers and business the opportunity to adjust<br />
to change within stable programs that are known in<br />
advance. </p>
<p>EPAC stated: need to accept and plan for faster rates of<br />
change, which are consistent with our objectives.<br />
In particular on protection, consistent with the<br />
shared understanding that change must occur if<br />
growth is to ensue, policy must be applied in a<br />
manner which facilitates change while minimising<br />
the hardship associated with such change".<br />
The Federal Government, of course, totally agrees with this.<br />
EPAC has also decided to prepare annually detailed<br />
medium-term assessments of the economy.<br />
Those assessments will aid consideration of industry policy<br />
and structural adjustment.<br />
The first such assessment will be released within the next<br />
ye ar<br />
W! hen I was in Japan in February I held very useful talks on<br />
Japan's industry policy experience with Mr Amaya, a former<br />
Vice-Minister of the Ministry for International Trade and<br />
Industry.<br />
Mr Amaya has now come to Australia at my invitation to meet<br />
with representatives of the unions, business, government and<br />
the media.<br />
Yesterday he participated in an extremely valuable meeting<br />
of EPAC.<br />
Mr Amaya is also addressing meetings and seminars in<br />
Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.<br />
I believe his visit is a welcome international contribution<br />
to discussion of approaches to industry policy in Australia.<br />
The Federal Government believes greater Australian<br />
participation in world trade must form part of an active<br />
industry development strategy.<br />
Last November in Bangkok I proposed that the countries of<br />
this region develop a concerted approach to a new round of<br />
global trade negotiations.<br />
This proposal drew a warm response overseas.<br />
All the countries we have approached in our region,<br />
including all the ASEAN countries have agreed to participate<br />
in a senior officials' meeting in Bali at the end of this<br />
month </p>
<p>This meeting will help identify regional interests in a new<br />
round and consider how best to focus attention on those<br />
interests. But the Federal Government has gone beyond promoting a<br />
dialogue on change, gone beyond simply advocating change.<br />
In the case of Australia's vitally important steel industry<br />
we have acted.<br />
The historic Steel Industry Plan, which this Government put<br />
in place last year, is a model for how Aus~ tralia should be<br />
going about industry change.<br />
The Steel Plan is a co-. operative effort.<br />
All parties government, unions, business -have given<br />
undertakings to make the plan work.<br />
All the parties have a sense of commitment to make the plan<br />
work.<br />
And it is working.<br />
The Steel Plan has put the industry firmly on the path of<br />
higher productivity, lower protection and improved<br />
international competitiveness.<br />
And this has been done in a way that enhances the viability<br />
of the industry and promotes job security not the reverse.<br />
When I visited Newcastle last week I was struck by the<br />
extremely positive reaction of both employees and employers<br />
to the Plan.<br />
It was not simply their support for the Plan but their<br />
over~ whelming determination to work together to make the Plan<br />
work. This spirit of co-operation, this new attitude is indeed<br />
welcome. The success of the Steel Plan augurs well for the prospects<br />
of adjustment in other industries.<br />
Like the steel industry, the motor vehicle industry is an<br />
area requiring careful attention.<br />
The previous Government announced the assistance<br />
arrangements it proposed to apply to the industry after 1984<br />
when the present arrangements expire.<br />
The Federal Government accepts many elements of our<br />
predecessors' proposals.<br />
However, we believe other elements nre not consistent with<br />
the type of motor vehicle industry Austral ia should he<br />
fostering over the coming years and decades. </p>
<p>Accordingly the Government is reviewing assistance<br />
arrangements for the industry after 1984.<br />
This review will be assisted by the report of the Car<br />
Industry Council and the IAC Report on Assistance for Light<br />
Commercial Vehicle Production.<br />
We expect to announce revised arrangements for the industry<br />
next month.<br />
In making our decisions we will take account of the views of<br />
all parties.<br />
We will be guided by our desire to foster a via~ ile,<br />
efficient, outward-looking motor vehicle industry.<br />
Vie will be seeking gradual but consistent changes within a<br />
stated policy environment that will allow all parties to<br />
plan for the future with confidence.<br />
We belive that there are opportunities fo: 7 substantially<br />
reducing the costs of producing motor vehicles in Australia.<br />
These, if utilised effectively, can make gradual reductions<br />
in protection over the longer term consistent with the<br />
emergence of a stronger, more dynamic industry, offering<br />
more secure investment and employment opportunities to<br />
Australians. Coping with Change<br />
Successive Australian Governments have failed to come to<br />
terms with the whole area of industry policy.<br />
They have put these problems in the too-hard basket.<br />
This is not surprising.<br />
For a start the pressures on any Government tackling the<br />
question of long term industrial reconstruction can be<br />
formidable.<br />
But it is absolutely clear that we will not achieve<br />
sustained economic growth over the remainder of this Century<br />
without substantial structural changes in the Australian<br />
economy and Australian industry.<br />
Failure to face that reality will mean lower living<br />
standards, fewer jobs and lost opportunities.<br />
We must not turn our back on the enormous potential open to<br />
Australia. And this Government is not about to do go.<br />
Rift in dealing with the question of industry restructuring,<br />
we will be guided] by three vital. considerations. </p>
<p>First, our approach to industry adjustment will be a gradual<br />
one, as it must be.<br />
W1e are not about sudden or precipitous po: licy changes.<br />
W~ hat we are talking about is change over the medium to<br />
long-term and how best to increase job opportunities over<br />
that time.<br />
Second, consultation is crucial in the area of industry<br />
adjustment. Nothing is going to be done simply by government directive.<br />
Vie will be talking very closely with those who may be<br />
affected by government policy decisions.<br />
In doing so we will be recognising that in the end it is not<br />
for the Government to underwrite particular firms and<br />
industries. Rather Australia's industrial structure should emerge from<br />
private decisions within a general policy environment that<br />
favours efficient expansion.<br />
Third, this Government believes you can't consider industry<br />
adjustment in isolation from other policies.<br />
It has to be seen as part of a whole. It has to be<br />
integrated with other policies.<br />
These policies include the right macroeconomic policy<br />
framework. They also include appropriate education, training and<br />
retraining policies so we can have a well-trained, highly<br />
skilled, flexible workforce capable of meeting the demands<br />
of a changing world.<br />
In the tight budgetary environment of 1984-85, these and<br />
other areas of expenditure bearing on our long-term<br />
industrial growth performance will he given high priority,<br />
alongside the desirability of income tax cuts and some<br />
social security improvement for Australians in greatest<br />
n ee d.<br />
The central point about the Government's approach to<br />
industry restructuring is this: if' the chan ges needed to<br />
the structure of Australia's industry are to occur, then<br />
they must be accepted and, ultimately, supported by the<br />
community. They cannot simply be imposed on people.<br />
This Government accepts its responsibility to persuade the<br />
community as clearly as we can why change is needed and, in<br />
addition, to lay the groundwork for that change to occur.<br />
I </p>
<p>I believe we can make no greater contribution to creating a<br />
more receptive climate for change than in addressing the<br />
central challenge of economic recovery.<br />
The Australian people will be much more receptive to change:<br />
if the economy is growing<br />
if business confidence is returning and<br />
if new job opportunities are opening up again.<br />
That's the challenge this Government is facing.<br />
And I believe we are meeting that challenge.<br />
We have, to a considerable degree, been able to do this<br />
because within our policy of dialogue and consultation, we<br />
have received the constructive support of you people in<br />
industry and the trade union movement.<br />
I thank you for the spirit and fact of that co-operation.<br />
Together we can continue to meet thlis challenge for South<br />
Australia and for the nation as a whole. </p>
