ELECTORATE RELEASE 12 JULY 1979<br />
1979/ 80 WOOL FLOOR PRICE<br />
The Prime Minister and Member for Wannon, Malcolm Fraser,<br />
has welcomed the increase of 7 percent in the 1979/ 80<br />
wool floor price. " It will certainly give producers added<br />
confidence in the wool market for the next season", he said.<br />
Mr Fraser said the floor price of 318 cents/ kg clean in<br />
terms of the market indicator in the 1979/ 80 season is the<br />
level recommended strongly to the Government by the<br />
Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Industry<br />
Conference. " Woolgrower representatives recently discussed prospects for<br />
1979/ 80 with overseas textile manufacturers and reported<br />
that demand for Australian wool was expected to be strong, with<br />
the wool market well able to support the increase recommended<br />
by the industry", he said.<br />
He pointed out that developing Asian countries are expanding<br />
wool textile exports and are an increasingly important<br />
market for the Australian wool industry in addition to<br />
traditional markets in USSR, Europe and Japan.<br />
" Wool producers can now plan ahead for 1979/ 80 with<br />
a good deal of confidence.<br />
" Seasonal conditions are, generally good, the floor price<br />
has been significantly increased and the Wool Corporation<br />
is in a very sound financial position, with a low stockpile<br />
and strong financial reserves.<br />
" Also, the market for lamb, mutton and live sheep is strong,<br />
enabling sheep producers to continue the national trend<br />
of expanding flocks in the knowledge that there is a good<br />
market for both wool and sheep meats".<br />
Mr. Fraser said the Government's commitment that the floor<br />
price scheme will be continued in 1980/ 81 at not less than<br />
318 cents will assist long-term industry planning. " It is<br />
a further recognition of the fundamentally sound outlook<br />
for the industry", he said. 000---</p>
