FOR PRESS P. M. No. 15/ 1967<br />
VISIT BY PRINCESS ALEXANDRA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
It has been announced in London that Princess Alexandra<br />
and her husband, Mr. Angus Ogilvy, will make a private visit to Australia<br />
beginning on 24th February and lasting for about a week. In the course of<br />
the visit, Mr. Ogilvy will be attending to business interests in Australia.<br />
Princess Alexandra and Mr. Ogilvy will already have made an official visit<br />
to Burma before coming to Australia.<br />
Although Princess Alexandra's visit will be private in<br />
character, the Australian people, with their very happy recollections of<br />
her earlier visit, will welcome her back to Australia. The idea that she<br />
will spend what will be a virtual holiday here will give its own pleasure<br />
to the Australian people.<br />
Princess Alexandra and Mr. Ogilvy will begin their visit<br />
in Canberra and will stay with the British High Commissioner and his wife,<br />
Sir Charles and Lady Johnston, who are family friends of many years.<br />
Later they will move to Sydney where they will stay at Kirribilli House as<br />
guests of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
Although the visit is private and will therefore be without<br />
a list of formal engagements, I hope that Princess Alexandra will find<br />
opportunities to move about. I am sure this would be her wish as well as<br />
ours. CANBERRA, January, 1967. </p>
