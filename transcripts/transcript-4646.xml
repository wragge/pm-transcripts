PRIME MRIISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 15 MARCH 1978<br />
BALTIC STATES 60TH ANNIVERSARY RECEPTION, CANBERRA<br />
I welcome this opportunity to join with you in celebrating the<br />
Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of Latvia,<br />
Estonia and Lithuania. This is a most important occasion<br />
for the Australian Baltic community.<br />
Sixty years ago, the leaders of these three nations proclaimed<br />
a Declaration of Independence which restored a sovereignty that<br />
they had enjoyed in earlier times. Unfortunately, this<br />
independence was to be short-lived.<br />
It was one of the first steps taken by my Government on coming<br />
to office in December 1975 to withdraw de jure recognition of<br />
the incorporation of the Baltic states into the USSR.<br />
The tragi,-events which put an end to the independence which<br />
you are tonight celebrating and which have occurred since<br />
that time have led tens of thousands of Latvians, Estonians<br />
and Lithuanians to seek freedom in other countries.<br />
You have made Australia your new homeland. Australia has offered<br />
new hope to many who have fled oppressive authoritarian regimes<br />
new freedom to achieve and create, new opportunity to retain<br />
and nourish distinct cultural religious and ethnic traditions.<br />
Your communities have seized this opportunity, and it is to your<br />
great credit that you have succeeded in maintaining your<br />
identity, preserving your languages and cultures.<br />
Australia is not a country whose culture and traditions are<br />
drawn from one source alone. We are a multicultural society,<br />
and we are all the richer for it.<br />
You are not a large community in Australia, yet you have<br />
contributed to all fields of endeavour out of all proportion t~ o<br />
your numbers. Sir Arvi Parbo, a leader in our business community;<br />
John and Ilsa Konrads, olympic champions both; Eddie Palubinskas,<br />
the record breaking basketballer of the Montreal Olympics;<br />
Tom Raudonikis, former captain of the Australian Rugby League Team;<br />
Olegas Truchanas, famous naturalist and photographer; and man~ y<br />
others, all have distinguished themselves in the community. / 2 </p>
<p>It is the Government's aim to encourage the increasing<br />
contribution of ethnic communities to every aspect of<br />
Australian life academic, cultural, professional,<br />
business and sport.<br />
To this end, we are working actively to improve Government<br />
services to all our ethnic communities, particularly to<br />
migrants who have recently arrived and who have not acquired<br />
a command of English.<br />
We also aim to expand the ethnic broadcasting service, and<br />
establish an ethnic television service.<br />
We recognise that the success of the Government's ethnic<br />
affairs policies depends very much upon the cooperation of<br />
the ethnic communities themselves.<br />
I commend the Baltic Council of Australia for bringing together<br />
the members of three communities which, whilst sharing many<br />
common ideals and attributes, have very individual cultures<br />
and identities.<br />
I look to you to play a most active role in helping with the<br />
Government to improve community services available to migrants<br />
in need of assistance and in helping to make our country a<br />
great country to live for all Australians.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, will you join with me in a toast to<br />
Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. </p>
