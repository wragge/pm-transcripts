FOR PRESS P. M. No.-43Z1965<br />
ADDITIONS TO THE NATIONAL ART COLLECTION<br />
Statement by thePrjme Minister; the Rt. on. Si Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that, on the advice<br />
of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board the Commonwealth had<br />
recently acquired a number of important paintings for the<br />
National Collection. The first of these comprise the considerable collection<br />
of Australian paintings which belonged to the late Mr. Richard<br />
Paul of Sydney* The Commonwealth has been able to acquire this<br />
important collection through the generosity of the beneficiary<br />
of his estate and the co-operation of his executorsi the<br />
Perpetual Trustee Company. The result is that for very much<br />
less than market values the Commonwealth has acquired fine<br />
examples of the work of Tom Roberts ( 1856-1931), Sir Arthur<br />
Streeton ( 1867-1943), Elioth Gruner ( 1882-1939) and George<br />
Lambert ( 1873-1930) as well as many other noted Australian<br />
artists. The Prime Minister also gave details of other purchases<br />
which resulted from a great deal of research in i'ngland and<br />
France leading to the location of some important works by the<br />
expatriate Australian painter John Peter Russell ( 1858-1931).<br />
Russell was a fellow student and friend of Van Gogh, Toulouse-<br />
Lautrec, Seurat and other noted French artists of the French<br />
Impressionist era. As a result of subsequent negotiations, the<br />
Commonwealth has acquired four of Russel's oil paintings:<br />
" Paysans a Monte Cassino", " View of the Alpes Maritimes"<br />
" Le Pont de Pecq" and " Bougeval near Paris", and three ol his<br />
watercolours " Cliffs at Goulphar", " Piazza Lerici 1910" and<br />
" Breton Fisherman;. The ? rime Minister pointed out that in addition to<br />
acquiring these important works by noted artists of an earlier<br />
period in our history, the Art Advisory Board is constantly<br />
adding examples of the work of contemporary Australian artists<br />
to the National Collection which it is hoped will ultimately<br />
be housed in a National Art Gallery in Canberra. In the<br />
meantime, many of the paintings acquired for the National<br />
Collection are hanging in our Embassies abroad and others are<br />
included in travelling exhibitions such as those now in<br />
Europe and New Zealand.<br />
