FOR PRESS 30. OCTOBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE. TALK<br />
Australians go to the polls this December to vote for a Government<br />
to lead Australia in the years ahead.<br />
Voters face a clear choice. It is a choice between the kind of<br />
Government and the kind of economic management that Australia<br />
requires to keep Australia's steady recovery on course. It is<br />
not just a choice between two different policy documents. It is<br />
a very real and fundamental choice about the kind of Australia<br />
we want.<br />
Do we want big Government control and socialist policies or do<br />
we want a Goverment that cherishes and understands the place of<br />
the individual-i-n-the. -cmmunity? What I am saying is that<br />
ultimately, this election is all about deciding on the kind of<br />
Australia we want to live in in the years ahead.<br />
During the coming weeks, Australians will hear and read a great<br />
deal about unemployment, inflation, other econbmic mXatters, and<br />
industrial relations. There is no doubt that the management of<br />
Australia's economy will be a key issue in the weeks leading up<br />
to December 10. I and the Government team face the electorate<br />
squarely in the face. We have an outstanding record of achievement<br />
in our fight against inflation.<br />
Australia's inflation rate is now at around 9% and is continuing<br />
to steadily fall. Let us never forget that we have reduced inflation<br />
to this level from Labor's disastrous peak of 19.3% just three<br />
years ago. We have more than halved Labor's rate. As inflation<br />
comes down and it is not coincidental there are clear and<br />
positive -s: gns-. of-a-major-. lif-t-in-pzi-vate-investment plans just<br />
ahead. This is good news for Australia. It is good news for<br />
those seeking jobs. On top of that, we have been seeing for<br />
several weeks now the early stages of what could be a substantial<br />
and sustained fall in interest rates.<br />
In short, in two years we have laid the foundation from which longterm<br />
prosperity will develop. It is absolutely vital for Australia<br />
that current policies are continued. It is vital that Australian<br />
and overseas businesses know that for at least several years ahead<br />
we will have stable Government and continuing sound economic<br />
management. Alt is </p>
<p>-2<br />
It is importan t thatinflation should keep falling, that interest<br />
rates keep coming down, that consumption rises, and that investment<br />
spending continues in a climate of certainty. The reason<br />
these conditions are required is that it is the only way to have<br />
higher employment, and lower unemployment.<br />
Unemployment is a severe problem. Too many Australians who want<br />
to work cannot get jobs. The reasons are complex. What is clear,<br />
however, is that Governments need to develop a sympathetic and<br />
sensitive response to the problem. Money alone the ' cash to<br />
splash' disease will not solve the problem. Look what happened<br />
when Labor increased Government expenditure by 46% in one year<br />
unemployment went up by almost 200,000.<br />
We have shown sensitivity and concern for unemployed Australians.<br />
Not only have we dramatically reduced Australia's annual rate of<br />
inflation and given business an incentive to employ, but we have<br />
also set up or expanded a number of imaginative manpower training<br />
programmes. All told, the Budget provides $ 102.7 million for employment<br />
training programmes this year, which is an increase of 33% over<br />
last year.. More will be spent if necessary, because no eligible<br />
unemployed person will be refused assistance under these programmes.<br />
Already over 122,000 people mainly young Australians -have<br />
benefitted from these programmes.<br />
We have faced up to our responsibilities. We will continue to show<br />
concern for Australians who cannot find jobs. We will continue with<br />
practical policies that demonstrate tha-E concern. At the same time<br />
we will continue. . to.. devxe lop policies that encourage Australian<br />
industry and business to create new jobs. There is no doubt our<br />
policies will create conditions where more Australians who want to<br />
work will find jobs. From February onwards, unemployment in<br />
Australia will fall in a steady and sustained way.<br />
I am certain that Australians do prefer the path of sound economic<br />
management, the path of steady progress. That is what we have given.<br />
That is what we offer. We have demonstrated our ability to come to<br />
grips with the economic problems that were a tragic legacy of the<br />
Labor experiment.<br />
Labor's so-called. economic management-brought Australia to the<br />
brink of bankruptcy., It split city and country with repercussions<br />
thrat will take years to mend. It eroded the fabric of our society.<br />
Aus-tralians-will-ne-ver again risk the Government of their country<br />
to the men i3n the . Labar Party-who almost wrecked it. </p>
