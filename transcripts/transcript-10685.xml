<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, an amazing set of economic statistics - profit</p>
<p>   share of GDP goes up, growth in real wages and salaries, salaries</p>
<p>   have increased nearly 10% after inflation, domestic inflation less</p>
<p>   than 1%. These are extraordinary results but are you worried about</p>
<p>   the level of debt?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, I'd be more worried about the level of foreign debt</p>
<p>   if our capacity to re-pay it were not much stronger than it was</p>
<p>   a few years ago. I mean, one can afford a large loan on one's</p>
<p>   house if one has the capacity to re-pay the loan but if one doesn't</p>
<p>   have the capacity to re-pay the loan then one can't afford</p>
<p>   such a big loan. Now, our capacity to re-pay is much better than</p>
<p>   it was a few years ago because our economy is going a lot better,</p>
<p>   it's more productive. And the other point I'd make about</p>
<p>   the foreign debt is that a lot of it is a direct result of our exchange</p>
<p>   rate having gone down. When that changes over time some of that</p>
<p>   debt will disappear. But it is a very manageable foreign debt and,</p>
<p>   of course, what makes it even better is that we have such a strong</p>
<p>   domestic budget surplus. And the Treasurer will be announcing the</p>
<p>   mid-year economic, or releasing the mid-year economic review later</p>
<p>   today. And that will show just how strong the Australian economy</p>
<p>   is and how we have put the fat on the bones of the Australian economy</p>
<p>   so that even if there were not such a good picture in some parts</p>
<p>   of the world next year then the Australian economy would continue</p>
<p>   to function very well. This is a very strong economy. It is the</p>
<p>   strongest it has been for more than 30 years. </p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And when you were Treasurer to Prime Minister Fraser you never</p>
<p>   ever used the word debt because there was none Â 21 billion,</p>
<p>   I think - now, 233 billion. At what point do we get confused? The</p>
<p>   maxim then was, if you got your debt to 5% of GDP someone would</p>
<p>   knock on your door. There's talk that next year, for at least</p>
<p>   six months, it could be 6%, is that a worry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well that's the current account which is a different thing.</p>
<p>   Well, Alan, a current account deficit of 6% would be a worry if</p>
<p>   we had a budget deficit and we had high and rising interest rates</p>
<p>   and we had high and rising inflation. But if you have record, or</p>
<p>   almost record low inflation, very low interest rates, you have a</p>
<p>   budget in surplus, you have an economy growing very strongly, then</p>
<p>   a 6% current account deficit for a period of time Â and I'm</p>
<p>   not sure that we'll reach that figure Â is imminently</p>
<p>   manageable.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>All right. Let me just go to a thing Â and I don't want</p>
<p>   to canvass that anyway with you in detail this morning because it's</p>
<p>   the wrong time of the year Â but I did want to canvass with</p>
<p>   you, as you know, this Christmas story, the awful conundrum about</p>
<p>   employment, Austral Pacific, Australia's largest bus builder.</p>
<p>   I might just canvass again the issues. It has 65% of the local market.</p>
<p>   It's collapsed with debts of $50 million. Seven hundred people</p>
<p>   around the country to be out of work for Christmas but no long service</p>
<p>   leave, no annual leave, no sick leave, no superannuation. How can</p>
<p>   workers put aside part of their wage for these things, sick leave,</p>
<p>   holiday pay, long service leave and super, and then when this happens</p>
<p>   get absolutely nothing, they just get unapologetically dudded?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that shouldn't happen and that particular case is being</p>
<p>   investigated right now by the Department of Employment and Workplace</p>
<p>   Relations. I understand and agree with your expressions of anger</p>
<p>   about workers being dudded. I don't want any workers to be</p>
<p>   dudded and that is why, for example, we encouraged the Australian</p>
<p>   Securities Commission to pursue the company that had been responsible</p>
<p>   for Ashanti. And, might I say, 85% of their entitlements have now</p>
<p>   been recovered.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Sure, should have been 100.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, sure, but 85% is better than zero. And I want to say</p>
<p>   that there is no excuse and people who are responsible for dudding</p>
<p>   workers in the way that you have described won't get any sympathy</p>
<p>   at all from this Government. In the meantime those workers, let</p>
<p>   me confirm, are entitled, if they meet the normal criteria, to unemployment</p>
<p>   benefits.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I know. It's no consolation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is no consolation.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Let me just tell you that employees Â I'm now talking</p>
<p>   to you, really, with all the authority of the prime ministership</p>
<p>   Â employees at Revesby of this company have been informed by</p>
<p>   their superannuation trustee that the superannuation guarantee charge</p>
<p>   payments are five months in arrears, the voluntary contributions</p>
<p>   deducted from the employees after tax earnings have not been paid</p>
<p>   into the super fund for the last three months. Now, everyone would</p>
<p>   have thought that employee entitlements from superannuation are</p>
<p>   sacrosanct. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And, of course, this company as I am advised was trading quite</p>
<p>   profitably.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And so, but Alan, I repeat that there is an investigation being</p>
<p>   carried out. I understand the results of one part of the investigation</p>
<p>   will be available on the 23rd of this month, which is</p>
<p>   two days before Christmas. I am very much aware of the sense of</p>
<p>   injustice a lot of people feel about it and quite properly so. And</p>
<p>   I can assure you that the laws that are applicable in this area</p>
<p>   will be fully enforced.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But maybe, Prime Minister, the laws aren't adequate. Why shouldn't</p>
<p>   company directors be made liable at law for any deductions made</p>
<p>   from an employee's wage for superannuation, health funds or</p>
<p>   whatever that don't find their way into the employee's</p>
<p>   pocket? If the money then is used for other purposes that's</p>
<p>   theft. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, where fraud occurs they are already liable at law. I'd</p>
<p>   like to just take on notice, as it were, your suggestion of personal</p>
<p>   liability in all the cases you have cited because that might involve</p>
<p>   some removal of the principle of limited liability which lies at</p>
<p>   the heart of our corporation law.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But just go back to the first principle. You know that millions</p>
<p>   of Australian workers do say: well listen, I'll take $400 a</p>
<p>   week, I could have got $500 but I'll take $400 because the</p>
<p>   rest of it you'll make up in long service leave and all the</p>
<p>   rest of it. Now, even at Ashanti they are only getting 85 per cent</p>
<p>   when their entitlement is 100. And this lot...now, I had the</p>
<p>   Manager at Revesby who are, in fact, viable and they are telling</p>
<p>   me that their profits are being transferred around Australia and</p>
<p>   he's tried to say to me, thank you Mr Jones, have a happy Christmas</p>
<p>   and then burst into tears on this programme. I mean, why should</p>
<p>   people have to cop this at Christmas time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you shouldn't. And, Alan, let me say this that we have</p>
<p>   got an investigation being carried out at the present time and I</p>
<p>   hope out of that justice is delivered to the employees. If there</p>
<p>   are further changes to the law that are needed well of course the</p>
<p>   Government will have a look at that. I don't have an inflexible</p>
<p>   view on it but I just can't on the run say: yes, we'll</p>
<p>   change the law and do this and do that. I want to understand all</p>
<p>   the ramifications of it. But, in answer to your question is an Australian</p>
<p>   worker who has something like a superannuation provision deducted</p>
<p>   from his salary, is he entitled to feel that that will be safely</p>
<p>   dealt with and if it's not those responsible for fraudulently</p>
<p>   dealing with this will be punished. The answer to that question</p>
<p>   is, yes he is entitled to feel secure and yes he is entitled to</p>
<p>   feel that if somebody behaves in a fraudulent fashion they'll</p>
<p>   be dealt with.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, I am told that the health fund contributions have</p>
<p>   not been paid into the health fund.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is unacceptable, completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Should any company funds, just in principle, should any company</p>
<p>   funds or any profits be allowed to go anywhere until all obligations</p>
<p>   to an employee have been proven to have been met?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if you are asking me should money deducted to make provision</p>
<p>   for employees be exclusively dealt with in that way the answer is</p>
<p>   yes. I am just not quite sure of all, off hand, of all of the ramifications</p>
<p>   of saying yes to your exact question. Alan, you are a very good</p>
<p>   cross-examiner which is your job - fair enough. But I have also</p>
<p>   got to be, you know, I can't just say a flick yes or no to</p>
<p>   everything because there may be implications.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I understand that. We need to check whether the law is.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I respond in goodwill.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Thank you, I understand that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I respond in complete goodwill to what you are saying. It is an</p>
<p>   outrageous position. I do understand and sympathise with the workers,</p>
<p>   they have every right to feel as though they have been dudded. And</p>
<p>   we are having it investigated and if there are changes that should</p>
<p>   be made to the law they will be made.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay. Well, you won't mind if we keep.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't, I don't mind.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>.....because there's 700 people and it's an awful</p>
<p>   predicament. Just a couple of quick ones. Delegates from all over</p>
<p>   Australia at great expense met for a constitutional convention.</p>
<p>   You said that whatever resolution was reached at that convention</p>
<p>   would go to a referendum.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>What do you say to those people now who know that that referendum</p>
<p>   couldn't possibly succeed and want to change the proposal before</p>
<p>   it goes to the referendum? Will the Prime Minister be saying to</p>
<p>   the nation: listen, we have the convention, this is the proposal</p>
<p>   it will go to the referendum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, I am honour bound to do that because that's what</p>
<p>   I told the Australian people.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I don't intend to depart from the commitment that I made</p>
<p>   at the convention. I said I would....I made one commitment at</p>
<p>   the end of the convention and to fulfil the commitment I made at</p>
<p>   the beginning. And that was that if a clear consensus emerged around</p>
<p>   a particular model then that is the model that would be put. Whether</p>
<p>   I agreed with it or not is beside the point. I mean, I made my own</p>
<p>   position clear. I believe our present constitution works very well</p>
<p>   and that remains my view. But there are a lot of people who don't</p>
<p>   have that view and we had an election promise before 1996 that we'd</p>
<p>   have a convention and if a clear consensus emerged I'd put</p>
<p>   that to the Australian public. Now, I intend to keep that promise.....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>The proposal which emerged from the convention will go to the referendum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. I am not going to alter it along the way because I'd</p>
<p>   be breaking the commitment I made.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, you have just saved a million and one headlines and a few</p>
<p>   trees can stay in the ground and not be cut out because there is</p>
<p>   a powerful force out there on the republican side who seems to suggest</p>
<p>   that because they know what they then approved may not win the support</p>
<p>   of the Australian electorate, that somehow along the line between</p>
<p>   now and the referendum that can be changed. You're saying it</p>
<p>   won't be.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, what I am saying is that the model that emerged from the convention</p>
<p>   will be put to the Australian people and they'll be asked to</p>
<p>   vote yes or no to that because that's the commitment I made.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And there can't be any mucking around with that.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No backsliding?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there can't be because I made a commitment, I made it</p>
<p>   to a convention at great expense as you say these people were gathered</p>
<p>   from everywhere. I expressed my own view, there are people in my</p>
<p>   party who have a different view from me on that. That is fair enough,</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party in accordance with its tradition on issues like</p>
<p>   this is allowing a free vote because we are mature enough to handle</p>
<p>   a free vote on something like this. My own view is known. I have</p>
<p>   promised the Australian people I will put that model, and I am not</p>
<p>   going to change the model, but I am going to put it to the people</p>
<p>   as I promised I would.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. Have a good Christmas to you and your family</p>
<p>   and a happy new year. </p>
