    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit Papua New Guinea from 20 to 23 March at the invitation of Prime Minister Peter O’Neill.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea is Australia’s nearest neighbour. We share historical links, democratic values and an interest in promoting a secure and prosperous region.</p>
<p>Australia’s relationship with Papua New Guinea is strong and wide-ranging. We cooperate closely on business, trade, aid, security and defence issues. Importantly, Papua New Guinea is a vital partner in our determination to tackle people smuggling and stop the boats.</p>
<p>As part of my visit, I will be accompanied by a senior Australian business delegation.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea is already an important commercial partner for Australia, with two-way trade between our two countries valued at $5.7 billion in 2012-13. Deepening our economic ties will be a key focus of my visit.</p>
<p>I will join Prime Minister O’Neill for a one-on-one meeting before participating in a meeting with Papua New Guinea’s Cabinet.</p>
<p>During the visit, I will open Australian aid-funded facilities at a Port Moresby school, visit an Australian aid-funded vocational training programme at Port Moresby City Mission, meet with AFP officers working alongside the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary and lay a wreath at the Bomana War Cemetery.</p>
