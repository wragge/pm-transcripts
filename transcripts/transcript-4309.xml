FOR PRESS 2 FEBRUARY 1.977<br />
APPOINTMENT O? MR. K. C. 0. SHANN, CBE, AS CHAIRMAN OF THE<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, announced tcday that the<br />
Government had appointed Mr. K. C. 0. Shann, CBE, as Chairman or<br />
the Public Service Board.<br />
Mr. Shann is currently the Australian Ambassador in Tokyo and his<br />
appointment as High Commissioner in London was announced in<br />
October 1976.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that Mr. Shann had had a long and distinguished<br />
career in service to Australia. He had been Australia's Ambassadcr<br />
in Japan since 1974 and prior to that held the position of Deputy<br />
Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs. He had also been<br />
Ambassador in Indonesia and the Philippines and had been a senior<br />
member of the Australian delegations to numerous United Nations and<br />
other international conferences.<br />
Mr. Shann had held appointments in the Treasury and in the former<br />
Department of Labor and National Service before joining the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs. He joined the Public Service<br />
in 1939.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that the British Government had been informed<br />
in advance of the Government's intention to appoint Mr. Shann as<br />
Chairman of the Public Service Board. The Prime Minister stressed<br />
that the Government's decision was based entirely on Mr. Shann's<br />
suitability for the position of Chairman of the Public Service<br />
Board to which he would bring the expertise, judgement and capacity<br />
for management which had so marked his public service career at<br />
home and abroad.<br />
The Prime Minister said that Mr. Shann's appointment in no way<br />
reflected on the importance the Australian Government attached to<br />
its relations with the United Kingdom. The change of plan with<br />
respect to Mr. Shann's appointment as High Comnmissioner to the<br />
United Kingdom had only arisen through the decision of Sir Alan<br />
Cooley to accept appointment as Secretary to r. he Department of<br />
Productivity and in no way implied any discourtesy to the British<br />
Government. Mr. Shann's appointment will take effect from 28 March.<br />
