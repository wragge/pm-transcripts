SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER$<br />
\ THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM. M. P,,<br />
FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TARCOOLA TO ALICE SPRINGS RAILWAY,<br />
SPORT AUGUSTA, SA,, 11 APRIL 1975<br />
THERE COULD BE NO BETTER PLACE TO PROPOSE<br />
A TOAST TO THE RAILWAYS OF AUSTRALIA THAN HERE IN PORT<br />
AUGUSTA, THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT RAIL TOWNS IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
A GREAT RAIL JUNCTION, THE CENTRE OF A COMMUNITY WHOSE<br />
HISTORY AND PROSPERITY ARE CLOSELY LINKED WITH THE PROGRESS<br />
OF AUSTRALIA'S RAILWAYS, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE POSTWAR<br />
IMMIGRATION PROGRAM, WORKERS FROM MANY COUNTRIES HAVE<br />
ENRICHED THIS DISTRICT AND MADE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION NOT ONLY<br />
TO THE RAILWAYS OF THIS COUNTRY, BUT TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY<br />
WHICH HAS PROVIDED MUCH OF THE TRACK AND ROLLING STOCK ON<br />
WHICH THE RAILWAYS DEPEND,<br />
THE OPENING OF A NEW RAILWAY IS A RARE<br />
EVENT IN AUSTRALIA. APART FROM THE STANDARD GAUGE LINK<br />
BETWEEN ALBURY AND MELBOURNE,' OPENED IN 1962. THE TARCOOLA<br />
TO ALICE SPRINGS RAILWAY WILL BE THE FIRST MAJOR RAIL LINK<br />
TO BE ESTABLISHED ON THIS CONTINENT SINCE THE TRANSCONTINENTAL<br />
RAILWAY IN 1917. ALMOST HALF A CENTURY HAS PASSED SINCE<br />
WE LAST MADE A SIGNIFICANT EXTENSION TO THE RAILWAY SERVICES OF<br />
THIS COUNTRY* FOR A NATION OF SUCH VAST SIZE, WITH SUCH<br />
SCATTERED RESOURCES, WITH SUCH A WIDELY DISPERSED, THOUGH<br />
BY NO MEANS DECENTRALISED, POPULATION, IT IS CURIOUS<br />
THAT THE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED FOR SO LONG, CURIOUS,<br />
BUT NOT ALTOGETHER INEXPLICABLE. FEDERATION, FAR FROM<br />
DRAWING TOGETHER THE DIFFERENT CITIES AND REGIONS OF THE<br />
CONTINENT, TENDED TO ENFORCE THEIR SEPARATION. S,/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
FOR GENERATIONS THE RAILWAYS HAVE LANGUISHED IN A<br />
MIASMA OF INTERSTATE RIVALRY, CONSTITUTIONAL DIFFICULTIES,<br />
IMPOVERISHED STATE BUDGETS AND SHEER INERTIA ON THE PART<br />
OF STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS.<br />
IN NO AREA OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY IS<br />
THERE A GREATER NEED FOR MODERNISATION AND REFORM. IN<br />
NO AREA ARE THERE GREATER CONSTITUTIONAL AND<br />
S ADMINISTRATIVE bBSTACLES TO SUCH REFORM. IN NO AREA IS THE<br />
COST TO THE PUBLIC OF OUR-PRESENT ADMINISTRATIVE CONFUSION<br />
AND PHYSICAL DILAPIDATION GREATER AND MORE ENTRENCHED.<br />
OUR TRANSPORT SYSTEMS ARE OUTDATED, INEFFICIENT AND<br />
UNECONOMICAL. RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM IS FRAGMENTED<br />
AND VAGUELY DEFINED. TRANSPORT IS THE CINDERELLA SERVICE<br />
OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE RAILWAYS ARE THE<br />
CINDERELLA OF OUR TRANSPORT SERVICES.<br />
IN RECENT YEARS THE IMPORTANCE OF MODERN<br />
RAILWAYS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY RECOGNISED. THEY ARE<br />
EASILY THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF TRANSPORTING BULK<br />
GOODS OVER LONG DISTANCES, BUT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO<br />
HAVE ADEQUATE STATE SERVICES. AN EFFICIENT RAILWAY<br />
SYSTEM MUST BE AN EFFICIENT NATIONAL SYSTEM. IT MUST BE<br />
ORGANISED TO MEET NATIONAL NEEDS AND PRIORITIES. THAT IS<br />
THE APPROACH OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. THE PROBLEMS<br />
OF INTERSTATE RAIL TRANSPORT ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM<br />
THOSE OF URBAN TRANSPORT, 4 </p>
<p>URBAN TRANSPORT CAN PROPERLY BE LEFT TO THE STATES, THOUGH<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS ACTIVELY ASSISTING THEM IN<br />
THIS-FIELD. INTERSTATE TRANSPORT, MUST BE TACKLED FROM<br />
A NATIONAL VIEWPOINT. WE ALL KNOW . THE NOTORIOUS BORDEN THAT OUR<br />
RAILWAYS HAVE INHERITED FROM A COLONIAL PAST. THE<br />
NATION IS STILL PAYING A HEAVY PRICE FOR RAILWAY SYSTEMS<br />
CENTRALISED ON STATE CAPITALS AND CONSTRUCTED ON<br />
INCOMPATIBLE GAUGES. THE POWER OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PARLIAMENT TO LEGISLATE ON TRANSPORT IS ILL-DEFINED.<br />
APART FROM A GENERAL POWERs-TO LEGISLATE IN'RESPECT OF<br />
THE TERRITORIES, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PROVISION IN THE<br />
CONSTITUTION GIVING THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT POWER IN<br />
RELATION* TO ROADS OR ROAD TRANSPORT, FORTUNATELY THE<br />
CONSTITUTION IS MORE SPECIFIC IN RELATION TO RAILWAYS,<br />
THE PROSPECT OF A NATIONAL RAILWAY SYSTEM WAS-FIRMLY IN<br />
MIND WHEN THE CONSTITUTION WAS DRAFTED. SECTION 51-ALLOWSe<br />
THE PARLIAMENT TO MAKE LAWS, WITH THE CONSENT OF A STATE,<br />
FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ANY STATE RAILWAYS ON TERMS ARRANGED N<br />
BETWEEN THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE STATE. FOR MANY YEARS THE<br />
STATE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN AN INSUPPORTABLE BURDEN ON STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS; DISTORTING THEIR BUDGETS AND DEPLETING THEIR<br />
RESOURCES AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
ALL FORMS OF TRANSPORT URBAN, RURAL AND INTERSTATE HAVE<br />
, FALLEN DEEPER INTO DEBT AND OBSOLESCENCE. WHILE THE<br />
STATES HAVE LACKED THE FUNDS TO PROVIDE MODERN TRANSPORT,<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH IN GENERAL HAS LACKED THE POWERS, ON<br />
TOP OF THAT WE HAVE A MULTIPLICITY OF TRANSPORT UNIONS,<br />
ORGANISED ON A FRAGMENTED FEDERAL BAS. IS, TENDING TO<br />
REINFORCE THE INEFFICIENCIES ENGENDERED BY INTERSTATE<br />
RIVALRY. SOUTH AUSTRALIA IS LEADING THE WAY IN<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE ECONOMIC AND EFFICIENT RAILWAY<br />
SERVICES. IN 1972 -IN ONE OF THE FIRST ACTS OF THE<br />
NEW GOVERNMENT-I OFFERED TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR<br />
THE RAILWAYS OF ANY STATE PREPARED TO OFFER THEM.<br />
VICTORIA AND QUEENSLAND REFUSED EVEN TO DISCUSS THE<br />
OFFER, A WEEK AGO MR DUNSTAN AND I ANNOUNCED THE<br />
AGREEMENT OF OUR GOVERNMENTS TO TRANSFER THE NON-METROPOLITAN<br />
RAILWAY SYSTEM OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT. THIS MEANS THAT THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL BE RELIEVED OF THE BURDEN OF MUCH OF THE<br />
RAILWAYS: DEFICIT. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OTHER STATES'HAVE<br />
BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME. IN ADDITION TO THE NEW LINE<br />
FROM TARCOOLA TO ALICE SPRINGS, AN AGREEMENT HASBEEN<br />
SIGNED WITH SOUTH AUSTRALIA TO CONNECT ADELAIDE TO THE<br />
EAST-WEST STANDARD GAUGE LINE AT CRYSTAL BROOK, THE<br />
COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL MEAN THAT ALL MAINLAND<br />
CAPITAL CITIES WILL BE CONNECTED TO STANDARD GUAGE, </p>
<p>IN RECENT WEEKS WE HAVE TAKEN TWO OTHER<br />
MAJOR INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIA'S RAILWAYS,<br />
ONE -F OUR GREAT INSTRUMENTS FOR THE REFORM AND<br />
COORDINATION OF NATIONAL TRANSPORT WILL BE THE<br />
INTER-STATE COMMISSION. LAST MONDAY I ANNOUNCED THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO INTRODUCE -LEGISLATION TO<br />
ESTABLISH THE COMMISSION. IN MY 1972 POLICY SPEECH<br />
I SAID: " THE INTER-STATE COMMISSION WAS INTENDED TO<br />
END THE CENTRALISM FOSTERED BY ALL THE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS THROUGH THEIR RAILWAY SYSTEMS. IT<br />
SHOULD NOW PROVIDE NOT ONLY FOR THE<br />
COORDINATION OF OUR SIX MAINLAND RAILWAY SYSTEMS<br />
AND OUR MAJOR PORTS IN THE PERIOD BEFORE THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH, LIKE OTHER FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS,<br />
INEVITABLY TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR RAILWAYS<br />
AND PORTS; IT IS ALSO THE IDEAL INSTRUMENT FOR<br />
CORODINATING OUR MAJOR ROADS AND SHIPPING A<br />
LINES AND AIRLINES AND PIPELINES...<br />
" A FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT WILL PROMPTLY<br />
RESTORE THE MACHINERY THE CONSTITUTION INTENDED<br />
AND VEST IT WITH THE COMMONWEALTH'S FULL<br />
MODERN MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE STATES."<br />
7-</p>
<p>-6-<br />
OUR OTHER IMPORTANT MEASURE HAS BEEN TO<br />
INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO CREATE THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
NATIONAL RAILWAYS COMMISSION. THIS WILL ' PROVIDE FOR THE.'.<br />
INCREASINGLY WIDER FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE<br />
PRESENT COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS. THE COMMISSION WILL HAVE<br />
THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONAL'POWERS<br />
NECESSARY TO CONSOLIDATE THE STATE AND AUSTRALIAN<br />
RAILWAYS INTO THE SINGLE SYSTEM ENVISAGED UNDER THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S RAIL TRANSFER PROGRAM,<br />
MY. COLLEAGUE THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT<br />
GAVE A VIVID INDICATION OF THE SCALE OF THE TASK<br />
BEFORE US WHEN HE INTRODUCED THE LEGISLATION FOR THE<br />
COMMISSION ON 20 FEBRUARY. HE POINTED OUT THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA'S RAILWAYS ON THE WHOLE ARE IN A PITIFUL<br />
CONDITION. FOR YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN STARVED OF THE CAPITAL<br />
FUNDS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO KEEP ABREAST OF ADVANCES<br />
IN RAILWAY TECHNOLOGY AND MEET THE TRANSPORT DEMANDS PLACE2<br />
UPON THEM BY A GROWING ECONOMY, FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE THE<br />
RIDICULOUS SITUATION WHERE STATE RAILWAY DEFICITS ARE<br />
INCREASLNG AT AN ALARMING RATE, YET THE RAILWAYS HAVE HAD<br />
TO TURN AWAY BUSINESS. RAILWAYS AT PRESENT NEED OVER<br />
3200 EXTRA'WAGONS-FOR INTER-SYSTEM TRAFFICALONE. IT HAS<br />
BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THE VICTORIAN, SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES AND COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS LOST OVER<br />
$ 66 MILLION IN POSSIBLE REVENUE IN 1972-73 BECAUSE THEY<br />
WERE NOT ABLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF ! NTER-SYSTEM TRAFFIC, 717 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT WAS QUICK TO REACT TO THE PROBLEM AND<br />
IN THE 1974 BUDGET ANNOUNCED A CONTINUING ROLLING STOCK<br />
PURCHASING PROGRAM WHICH OVER THE NEXT 2 YEARS WILL<br />
PROVIDE SOME 1300 MODERN BOGIE WAGONS FOR INTER-SYSTEM<br />
USE. THESE WAGONS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR LEASE TO THE<br />
STATES. TOMORROW I SHALL HAVE GREAT PLEASURE<br />
S IN INAUGURATING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW LINE FROM<br />
TARCOOLA TO ALICE SPRINGS. : I HOPE THE LINE WILL COME TO<br />
SYMBOLISE OUR COMMITMENT TO BETTER RAILWAYS IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
IT WILL BE THE L6NGEST RAILWAY BUILT IN AUSTRALIA SINCE<br />
THE TRANSCONTINENTAL LINK BETWEEN THIS CITY AND<br />
KALGOORLIE. IT WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 830 KILOMETRES<br />
LONG. . IT WILL BE BUILT THROUGH SOME OF THE MOST<br />
INHOSPITABLE DESERT COUNTRY IN AUSTRALIA. WHEN COMPLETED<br />
IT WILL PROVIDE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AUSTRALIA . WITH A<br />
RAILWAY OF WORLD CLASS AND FREE FROM THE RISK OF<br />
FLOODING. IT WILL GIVE THE PEOPLE OF CENTRAL AUSTRALIA<br />
A FAST AND RELIABLE SERVICE, OF IMMEASURABLE BENEFIT<br />
TO THE CATTLE AND MINING INDUSTRIES AND TO TOURISM. : 7l </p>
<p>S w -8-<br />
A NEW RAILWAY HAS ALWAYS CARRIED WITH IT<br />
AN AURA OF ROMANCE# A SPIRIT OF PIONEERING. NOTHING<br />
SUGGESTS MORE VIVIDLY THE DETERMINATION OF A VIGOROUS<br />
SOCIETY TO DEVELOP ITS RESOURCES AND IMPROVE ITS<br />
COMMUNICATIONS, SOMETHING WAS MISSING FROM OUR<br />
NATIONAL LIFE DURING THE LONG YEARS WHEN THE RAILWAYS<br />
WERE ALLOWED TO DECLINE. MEN AND FAMILIES WHO HAD<br />
GIVEN A LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO THE RAILWAYS WERE<br />
0 ENCOURAGED TO LOSE FAITH IN'THE IMPORTANCE AND FUTURE OF<br />
A GREAT INDUSTRY. , I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT WE ARE<br />
0 SEEING TONIGHT, THE REBIRTH OF THE RAILWAYS IN THIS<br />
COUNTRY, THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA OF GROWTH AND<br />
DEVELOPMENT, YOU CAN BE SURE THAT MY GOVERNMENT WILL DO<br />
ITS UTMOST TO SEE THE RAILWAYS PROSPER AND RESUME THEIR<br />
RIGHTFUL, THEIR HISTORIC ROLE AS THE BASIS OF AN EFFICIENT,<br />
MODERN AND ECONOMICAL TRANSPORT SYSTEM. PROSPEROUS AND<br />
EFFICIENT RAILWAYS ARE AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF A<br />
PROSPEROUS AND EFFICIENT NATION.<br />
