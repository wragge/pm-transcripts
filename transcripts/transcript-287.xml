Speech given by the Rt. Hon. ReG. Menzies at the Wool<br />
Industries' " search Association on 21/ 22 March, 1961<br />
Chairman, ay Lord Mayor, my Lord, ladies and gentlemen, I have<br />
now successfully performed the first part of my duty. You don't know how<br />
lucky you are, because sometimes when you invite a politically-inclined fellow<br />
like me to come to open something and to unveil a tablet, he's liable to forget<br />
to unveil the tablet. Which, of course, means that what he was doing remains<br />
veiled in decent obscurity. So I've developed rather a prudent habit nowadays<br />
of unveiling it first, so that, at any rate, you will all know what it's<br />
about and whatever I may say.<br />
" Now you have been told I've already dealt with two audiences today I<br />
rather suspect that some of you were in the earlier ones this is a form of<br />
torture which exists only in English-speaking countries. But at any rate,<br />
this afternoon I'm back on the home ground; because it can't be too difficult<br />
to speak about wool if you are an Australian, or even if you're a politician.<br />
So your've been properly reminded that this is the greatest of Australian<br />
industries. When the price of wool goes up, everybody smiles, the balance<br />
of payments problem diminishes in intensity, treasurers beoome genial, you can<br />
get a little more money for the universities, and if you have an election,<br />
you wing " If the price of wool goes down, faces become long, Governments have to<br />
do unpopular things, and you avoid having an election for as long as you<br />
possibly oan So that, from my point of view, in that horrible sense, wool<br />
is tremendously important. But, of course, to the whole national economy<br />
of Australia, it means so much. And to the economy of your country, the<br />
country of most of you, it means so much. And I suppose one of the troubles<br />
that we have all been suffering from is this very fluctuation in the cost of wool,<br />
which may, in some ways, be related to a fluctuating demand for wool. And the<br />
makers of artificial fibres have an advantage, because the price of their raw<br />
material doesn't fluctuate within the same violent fashion and they can<br />
therefore attend to their costing a great deal more simply. We are familiar<br />
with these problems; and, of course we are also familiar with some of the<br />
oddities that bemuse political people and administrators. For a long time<br />
Australian wool which, after all, is a very different proposition from<br />
home-grown United States' wool, as everybody knows has been met at the<br />
Customs' barrier in the United States by a high duty. Why? Nominally to<br />
protect the native woolgrower. And if I may say so, quite bluntly, to<br />
relieve him of the necessity of becoming a little more up-to-date, as a<br />
woolgrower and as a wool-marketer. But in reality, of course, the effect<br />
of the duty is to give a comfortable protection to the makers of artificial<br />
fibres. " And these are matters that have to be attended to steadily so far as we<br />
can on the political level by persuasion and otherwise. But in reality what<br />
we have all begun to see more and more in modern times is this that wool<br />
must not simply remain something that we proudly refer to as the greatest<br />
of all fibres, but that it should meet the challenge of other things by the<br />
most persistent research into its quality, into its use, into its treatment,<br />
so that when it does meet competition, it will continue year by year to meet<br />
it at an advantage, and not at a disadvantage*<br />
" You know, there wasn't much said about research when I was a boy, it<br />
was regarded as some mysterious ( I can always be relied upon to do that)<br />
/ knooked over microphone/, some mysterious and rather malodorous operation<br />
conducted in universities. It's only in my own time that the world of<br />
industry, the world of business, has become aware of research, of the<br />
pressing need for it, of the fact that without it no great industry will develop. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I reumawber during the war, just about the time I was give the livery of the<br />
Clothworkers' Compan~ y,, going over a great and world-famous motor engine<br />
establishment it needs no advertisement from me and into their research<br />
establishment, with hundreds of poeple employed, a vast series of factories<br />
and workshops, all engaged on research not engaged in the production of<br />
a single thing for sale at the time that's waht we were looking at as a<br />
possible development for 1944. So that we think: ' If it comes out might be<br />
coming right in 194 You kcnow, this kind of thing. And the result of this<br />
enormous vision and concentration on research in today,, it stands pre-eminent<br />
in the world. It is the first with the latest and the bent all the result<br />
of spending, what I'm sure some people thought, a waste of money,, so mowe<br />
years ago,<br />
" Well. gradually we are beginning to approach these things in the right<br />
way. And it is comforting to me to know that in the case of wool there is<br />
this approach at, I think, all stages in the industry. You go down to a sheep<br />
station in the Western District of Victoria and you stay for a weekend with<br />
a man and whose name is 9, famous name ( Oh, dear) / knocked over niicrophone/<br />
S ( Leave it out these modern inventions). You do down to one of these plaoes,<br />
Wthe present owner has a name that has, for a hundred years, been connected with<br />
that property it might be supposed that he has inherited the fruits of the<br />
earth, and that he can have a good time and not worry too mch. TMe after<br />
time the first thing he wants to tell you about is how imuch he has increased<br />
the yield,, how many' pounds he has put into the fleeoe, what he has been<br />
doing in the way of breeding and development, what he has been doing in<br />
pasture improvement. All these things go on at that level, and have, of<br />
course, enormously increased production of the cawitry.<br />
" The great thing ( you refer, Sir, to perhaps one of the great<br />
dramatic things is, of course as you know, was the treatment of our friend<br />
the rabbit with myxomatosis. After this brutal business some people said,<br />
there were others who complained that you could no longer prudently buy a<br />
rabbit for a rabbit pie and admittedly that was a defamation but the<br />
estimates that have been made as to what zg-momatosis with its successful<br />
war on the rabbit it has meant to the Australian wool industry, are of course<br />
as you know, fabulous.<br />
" I believe that but for that, but for the attack on the rabbits, but<br />
for this scientific approach to what had become a great national economic<br />
problem, we wouldn' t have anything like the number of e1eep we have today,<br />
and nothing like the quantity of wool production that we have today. People,<br />
with modesty, estimate the difference that has been made at least Å“ 50 million<br />
a year pounds, money, a year. And therefore on that side of research with the<br />
kind of work that is done by on the field, so to speak,, the effects<br />
have been enormous. But then, of course, C. S. I. R. O. has been working in<br />
other fields. For a long time now we have been vaguely aware of the work<br />
done by devoted scientists to discuss the problems of shrinkage in wool,<br />
the problem of getting a pair of trousers for a humble decent citizen that<br />
won't get baggy at the knees in side two or three days, permanent creasing<br />
( These are not permanently creased, but the other pair I've got with me, out<br />
in the bag, they're permanently creased). A very great advantage. And then,<br />
Sir,, you are devoting a great deal of time and an enormous volume of ability and<br />
knowledge to the-problems of the processing of wool at its various stages in the<br />
course of manufacture. And whn all that is done, then we have to take the end<br />
products of all these thingsm, we have to present them to the world attractively,,<br />
have to add to their variety, to their qualitfl % e have to make them appeal not<br />
only to rugged, masculine characters in the country, but to finely drawn women<br />
in the cities who~ want a find, delicate, shizmmering piece of woollen material<br />
that looks as if it almost might be silk. This is it. This is the problem<br />
we have. And I am delighted, uiself, as the more or less temporary head of the<br />
Aus~ tralian Governmnt, I'm delighted to ome once more into contact with an<br />
aspect of this enormous task. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
" Interestingly enough, you know, when you try to do something for a<br />
particular industry, it says: ' Yes, that's a very good idea you pay for it<br />
you, the Government, you, busy bodies, you butt in on this matter, you find the<br />
money'. In the case of wool, I must say for the wool people in Australia they<br />
have shown at all times a very enlightened approach to this matter. They have<br />
subjected themselves to levies, they have raised large sums of money for<br />
research; they are aware of this problem, because they know that bnless this<br />
problem is dealt with progressively, then the future of their industry, and<br />
of the country, may be adversely affected. Now I was almost tempted, for a<br />
moment, to says ' When these problems are solved'. I don't want to enco age<br />
you into a belief that you have had a species of professional inmortality,<br />
but I think you have; because I don't think that the problems will ever be<br />
completely solved. These will be new problems arising every year; there<br />
will be new aspedts of competition in the world which will arise; these will<br />
be new things created in the world, that are a competitive kind. And therefore<br />
the problems of wool will never be completely solved, anymore that the problems<br />
of. human happiness and human health and human political satisfaction, will ever<br />
be solved. This is a continuing thing. But the great beauty of it is that I<br />
think we awake to it today; I think we are conscious of this problem, and<br />
conscious of it as a continuing problem. And to me it is a wonderful thing<br />
to recall that not only on sheep stations in Australia, in scientific<br />
laboratories in Australia, but here in Leeds here in Great Britain somewhere<br />
else in the field of presentation, all around the world people who are<br />
concerned with wool are realising that their task is not a defensive one, but<br />
is an agressive one. It's attacking something done. This is the very dynamic<br />
exercise so far as the qoonomy of Australia is concerned and, I venture to<br />
believe, in the long run in its various aspects so far as the economy of<br />
this acient country is concerned.<br />
We are never to become defensive. You know, people talk about Breat Britain<br />
as " the old country" well, if somebody in Australia, like myself, refers to the<br />
" old country" that's a glancing reference to the fact that Gran-Papa came from<br />
there, you see, and Gran-mama that's very interesting s it's the old country.<br />
( And I speak quite freely about my grandparents they went out quite freely,<br />
themselves). But what you must feel troubled about is when people talk about<br />
Great Britain aa " an old country" not as " the old country", but as " an old<br />
country". Ah well so to speak they are old, tired they've had itl I've<br />
heard it said, you know, quite a bit around the world. I don't believe it.<br />
If anybody wanted disproof of it, he would need only to come here today. But<br />
at the same time, it will become an old country, and heaven help many of us<br />
W around the world if it does, it will become an old country, if it assumes a<br />
sort of static position on various matters. If it forgets that the whole source<br />
of its greatness was the dynamo that was in it right through the 19th century,<br />
in particular, and before that. And therefore this must be kept alive, the<br />
spirit of research; the spirit of looking for quality, the spirit of meeting<br />
the world and meeting all compettion with the certain feeling that " these goods<br />
are the best". And, in the long run, the best goods will defeat the secondclass<br />
in the judgment of people who matter. I always remember that I had a<br />
remote relative who was old enough to me my uncle and was then, I thought,<br />
an imense age I think that he was probably a shade younger than I am now,<br />
but he seemed to me to be incredibly venerable at this time and I said to<br />
him " Where do you get your clothes Where do you get your suits built?" you see<br />
he lived in Melbourne. He named the most expensive tailors in Collins Street<br />
and he added, with a wry smile: " You know, Bob, I'm much too poor to afford<br />
to have an clothes built anywhere else". Now you can broaden that out; this<br />
is what we said about wool.<br />
" We must persuade the world and we will, if we maintain quality, if we<br />
raise quality and if we solve all these problems of the kind to which you are<br />
directing yourselves. And therefore, if this goes on, Great Britain becomes<br />
greater, Australia becomes greater in fact, you might become so great, you<br />
people who are Englishmen, you never know that in due course, you might win a<br />
Test Match against Australia at Heddingly. Sir, if I'm not occupying your<br />
ftL sw </p>
<p>0.4 as<br />
tim too long, might I before I conclude what has been an over-serious<br />
addes, perhaps by giving you one simple reminiscence of a Test match<br />
at Heddingly in 1948. This was an introduction to a new aspect of English<br />
character to me. There we all were I was sitting with the great; I was<br />
sitting with the Lord Mayor ( not you, Madam, but your then predcessor)<br />
and the people sat behind these little low ropes. ( We keep people outside<br />
the pickets in Australia, you see). There is no argument then as to whether<br />
it is a four or not you hear a crack or rattle on the pickets, you see.<br />
But hen the poeple sit down 8 or 10 rows deep right down both sides of the<br />
ground, there can be an argument occasionally, I suppose, as to whether it's<br />
a 4 or it's a 6. Of course, we never argue and the last people in the world<br />
to argue about cricket would be Yorkshiremen, of coursel) But one of our<br />
fellows one of the Australian players hit a noble, towering 6 mid-wicket<br />
( and it seemed to me to almst kill somebody three rows back) but it wasn't<br />
clear to the uqpirewho was a celebrated Chester, who had as you know<br />
lost an arm, and thereforehad a sleeve flapping. He was/ ficturesque, rather<br />
dramatic character. And he went across in his long white coat unpires in<br />
Australia use short ones, but they're cotton so it doesn't matterl He went<br />
across and conducted a coronial enquiry among the people in that section of the<br />
crowd t was really wonderful. I think he called witnesses and finally<br />
decided it was for 6. But he wasn't going to signal 6 from the boundary<br />
not on your life he went walking with great dignity right back to the<br />
umpire's position and then signalled his 6. It could only happen herel<br />
Don' t know what would have happened to him in Melbourne, but I know what<br />
would have happened to him in Sydney! </p>
