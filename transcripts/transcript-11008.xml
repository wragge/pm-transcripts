    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE............</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Surely the lamb issue came up, what did you say?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it did. The President and I had a one-on-one meeting before lunch.</p>
<p> We talked about lamb mainly during that discussion and I made it plain</p>
<p> to him that that issue had caused a greater adverse reaction in Australia</p>
<p> on a trade matter than any other trade issue that I could remember.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You are really furious about it aren't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are very unhappy, very unhappy. And we made it very plain</p>
<p> that the thing that particularly upset us was the imposition of a</p>
<p> tariff on the in-quota area. I raised with him the difficulty of the</p>
<p> transitional impact of the decision and our officials have agreed</p>
<p> to work on that. I pointed out that we would pursue our remedies in</p>
<p> the World Trade Organisation and that we would be providing compensation</p>
<p> to the Australian lamb producers who have been adversely affected</p>
<p> by this decision. Both of us agreed that our differences on lamb notwithstanding,</p>
<p> we had to work together to achieve freer trade goals within the confines</p>
<p> of the World Trade Organisation. We are both going to work very hard</p>
<p> on getting a Leaders' Declaration out of the APEC meeting in New Zealand</p>
<p> directed towards ensuring that we have a good result at the World</p>
<p> Trade Organisation when the comprehensive trade round commences which</p>
<p> we both very strongly support.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How did the President respond on lamb?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the President understood that we were very angered about it</p>
<p> and very upset about it. He indicated that there were domestic considerations</p>
<p> that he took into account and that he believed that taking in account</p>
<p> of those considerations was important to the broader goals he felt</p>
<p> that he had in relation to trade. I mean, I really think they are</p>
<p> questions that have to be directed to him. I mean, I put a view, I</p>
<p> put a view publicly, I put a view privately, I am repeating it here</p>
<p> today. Everybody knows our position. We are upset at the decision</p>
<p> but it's not going to be changed. I understand that. It doesn't make</p>
<p> it any easier for us. We don't agree with the decision but equally</p>
<p> we can't allow it to contaminate a broader relationship -- certainly</p>
<p> not the security aspects of that relationship.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has it not already affected the relationship?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's caused the most adverse reaction of any trade decision</p>
<p> the United States has taken in recent times. I can't think of one</p>
<p> that's caused a more adverse reaction in Australia. Now, I told the</p>
<p> President that. I told those who were at the lunch that. Now, that</p>
<p> doesn't mean that you are allowed to contaminate other aspects of</p>
<p> a very broad, a very deep relationship. Somebody asked me about the</p>
<p> aid workers. I discussed their fate at length last night with the</p>
<p> Secretary of State. I raised their position with the President and</p>
<p> others during the luncheon today and they both indicated that they</p>
<p> would do all they could over the days and weeks ahead to build the</p>
<p> pressure to secure their release. We remain very concerned about their</p>
<p> situation and we certainly appreciate the efforts that have been made</p>
<p> by a lot of people and we'll, of course, continue to make our own</p>
<p> efforts to bring about their release.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what about Indonesia and Timor, Prime Minister,.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we discussed Indonesia and Timor at very great length over lunch.</p>
<p> I said that Indonesia deserved from the world perhaps a little more</p>
<p> credit and a little more praise and understanding for the transition</p>
<p> that was occurring in that country towards a more democratic system</p>
<p> of government. We remain very strongly committed to a clean and open</p>
<p> ballot in East Timor to determine the fate of that territory. I said</p>
<p> that it was important to keep things in proportion. There are 950,000</p>
<p> people in East Timor, there are 211 million people in the whole of</p>
<p> Indonesia and it's important that the rest of the world understand</p>
<p> that proportionality and the pressures that are on Indonesia in relation</p>
<p> to the whole of the country and not just East Timor.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Sir, is there anything the President can do to make up to Australia,</p>
<p> to compensate in some other area?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, it's not a question of making up or compensating in other</p>
<p> areas; it's a question of dealing with the merits of individual issues.</p>
<p> When you have a relationship which is as old as ours and is as close</p>
<p> as ours you can talk very frankly and very directly when you are upset</p>
<p> about something in perhaps a way you can't when you have a relationship</p>
<p> with another country. Now, we are very upset about this particular</p>
<p> issue and there's no point in mincing words about it. But on other</p>
<p> issues, of course, we'll continue to work very closely together and</p>
<p> I think it's a question of moving on to ensure as best we can together</p>
<p> to get good outcomes from the World Trade Organisation. I think that</p>
<p> would be a good goal for both countries to set themselves but that's</p>
<p> not going to alter our sense of disappointment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you want the WTO to do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I want the WTO to do something more to free up trade in agriculture,</p>
<p> for example. Because that's something that we are very good at and</p>
<p> we think the rules on agriculture now are loaded against countries</p>
<p> like Australia and we have just seen an example of it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The US wants an early harvest on agriculture, they want agriculture..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we wall want that. Everybody wants an early harvest. Some get</p>
<p> it and some don't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The American Farm Bureau is saying that's detrimental to agriculture,</p>
<p> they want a singular undertaking so that agriculture will get the</p>
<p> full benefits..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as a very efficient agricultural exporting nation Australia</p>
<p> has an unambiguous national interest in having as liberal a trading</p>
<p> environment in agriculture as possible. That has always been our position</p>
<p> and that is why, of course, we are very disappointed and upset and</p>
<p> cranky about the US lamb decision.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, did you raise the issue of China joining the WTO..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, yes. The President indicated to me that he is very strongly in</p>
<p> favour of China joining the World Trade Organisation. We discussed</p>
<p> that at very considerable length and we'll be working together to</p>
<p> bring that about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about your concerns about the relationship between the US and</p>
<p> China after the bombing in Belgrade?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he raised that. I mean, it's self-evident that that has been</p>
<p> a setback to US/China relations. I think that's a matter for the American</p>
<p> administration to talk about rather than me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Given the performance on lamb how can you be confident that Mr Clinton</p>
<p> will show a leadership role at the WTO..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think on this, as in all other political things, you have</p>
<p> to react to what people do and give praise where it is due and criticise</p>
<p> where you don't agree with what's being done. I mean, as I said, we</p>
<p> have a very broad relationship with the United States. We are unhappy</p>
<p> about one aspect of it at the present time but there are a lot of</p>
<p> other things that we are not unhappy about. The President's reaffirmed</p>
<p> his commitment to the importance of APEC. He understands, as I do,</p>
<p> the importance of the APEC leaders coming out very strongly in favour</p>
<p> of an effective world trade round. We both want to have an effective</p>
<p> World Trade Organisation round. We want it to be comprehensive, we</p>
<p> want everything on the table. We both said today to each other that</p>
<p> we want to work together on that. Well, let's see what happens. I</p>
<p> think in six months you come and ask me the same question and I'll</p>
<p> give you my reaction.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's outcomes that count.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Outcomes always count in politics. They are far more important than</p>
<p> rhetoric. It's outcomes that matter and it's outcomes that electorates</p>
<p> either in the United States or in Australia respond to. Thank you.</p>
