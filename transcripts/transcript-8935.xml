PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH B! THE PRIME MINISTER, TEE HON P J KEATING MP, TO<br />
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY DINNER,<br />
CANBERRA, 13 AUGUST 1993<br />
When I first arrived in Canberra as a young opposition<br />
backbencher John Gorton was Prime Minister and this great<br />
library was well on the way to completion.<br />
So it is very pleasing tonight to come here and see that<br />
we are all still standing.<br />
Not that it was a surprise the National Library and Sir<br />
John both have about them the same timeless,<br />
indestructible quality.<br />
The building of the National Library spanned something of<br />
a sea change in our history. Sir Robert Menzies laid the<br />
foundation stone. Sir John Gorton opened it.<br />
That was a considerable political shift.<br />
For without intending the slightest disrespect to his<br />
illustrious predecessor, Sir John was a bit of a<br />
revelation to those of us who had really only known one<br />
Australian Prime Minister.<br />
I know there are some who look back and see it as perfect<br />
peace I saw it through different eyes, and so did many<br />
of my generation. We saw it by the mid-1960s in the<br />
doldrums.<br />
With Sir John there was a difference in both style and<br />
substance. It was Sir John, for example, who declared Commonwealth<br />
control over the coast to the high water mark and over<br />
coastal waterways and so preserved national<br />
responsibility for the environmental and resource issues<br />
which these areas presented.<br />
In this and in other ways -like his support for an<br />
Australian film industry -Sir John demonstrated that the<br />
conservative parties were capable of change and vigour<br />
and, dare I say, a rather more unqualified Australian<br />
demeanour. ~ j97<br />
L </p>
<p>2<br />
But despite sporadic outbreaks of resistance from some of<br />
his successors, the change continued: the powers that he<br />
insisted should be the Commonwealth's have been invoked<br />
in the interests of the environment and the nation; the<br />
film industry has flourished magnificently; and the not<br />
unrelated question of Australia's independent identity<br />
has become a central element in a national debate which<br />
may yet yield an Australian republic by the end of the<br />
century. So I hope Sir John sometimes allows himself the thought<br />
that he was a visionary.<br />
With the luxury of hindsight, we begin to get a<br />
perspective on the nature of the battle in those years<br />
and in the twenty-five since.<br />
In some respects it was a generational shift in values;<br />
yet I think the battles John Golton fought were of a kind<br />
to be found throughout ouir history between different<br />
concepts of Australia's nationhood and identity which<br />
emerged in the nineteenth century and have been alive<br />
ever since.<br />
In time I expect someone will write the history of these<br />
last twenty-five years.<br />
I know " From Gorton to Keating" has a funny sort of a<br />
ring about it, but under a different title it would be a<br />
rewarding project there is that consistent theme of<br />
change attempted and change denied.<br />
Change, let me say, has won a resounding victory and, for<br />
all the certainties which characterised the sixties, this<br />
is a much better Australia because change has won.<br />
We have seen the remarkable growth of tolerant, creative<br />
cultural pluralism and all the riches this has brought<br />
Australia. We have seen our attitude to the region in which we live<br />
change dramatically and today we are seeing the pace of<br />
change accelerate.<br />
The xenophobia has largely gone.<br />
We have seen the culture of the workplace change<br />
fundamentally from an assumption of opposing interests<br />
to one of shared interests.<br />
The shape of the Australian economy has changed: for<br />
instance, we are seeing Australia become an exporter of<br />
manufactures high tech goods as well as raw materials<br />
and agricultural products.<br />
And we have seen Australians come to the understanding<br />
that these are things we must do if we are to secure our<br />
future. 998 </p>
<p>That has probably been the most profound change of all<br />
and our greatest achievement, our willingness to change,<br />
to recognise that the world is changing, and the way we<br />
do things and conceive of ourselves must change to<br />
accommodate it.<br />
Yet far more than other comparable countries which have<br />
attempted the same kind of economic change, we have kept<br />
faith with our traditions of democracy and social<br />
justice. Like other countries we have a severe unemployment<br />
problem. But other countries do not have our health system. They<br />
do not have an Accord between unions and the government.<br />
They do not have the best record in the world on<br />
legislation to expand the status and rights of women.<br />
Few countries have such a secure social safety net.<br />
We have considerable difficulties. There are all sorts<br />
of imperfections.<br />
But at the end of a decade of the most profound economic<br />
change in our history, and at the end of a generation of<br />
equally profound cultural change, Australia remains among<br />
the very freest and fairest societies in the world.<br />
That is not to be complacent it is to recognise<br />
achievement and re-affirm our commitment to these<br />
principles. So this last twenty-five years makes a great story.<br />
And if someone does decide to write it there is one thing<br />
we can be sure of: we can be sure that the greater part<br />
of the research will be done here in the National<br />
Library. For this is where the national story is contained. Like<br />
the Library of Congress and the British Library and the<br />
Bibliotheque Nationale, the National Library of Australia<br />
conserves the materials from which the story can be told<br />
the story which will tell future generations who they<br />
are and how their country came to be.<br />
Ultimately it will tell them whether this generation<br />
cared enough about Australia: whether they had enough wit<br />
to imagine Australia's future and enough courage to do<br />
what was necessary.<br />
The National Library holds the materials by which we will<br />
be judged.<br />
This audience scarcely needs me to tell them why we<br />
should celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the<br />
National Library why it is one of Australia's greatest<br />
and most cherished institutions. 199 </p>
<p>But as one who every day has his history written with an<br />
air of definitive authority in a dozen newspapers across<br />
the country, and served up on three commercial and two<br />
public television networks, and on countless radio<br />
stations where the public are also invited to join in the<br />
feeding frenzy perhaps I can offer a politician's<br />
perspective on national stories.<br />
I don't mean to offer the gratuitous advice that you<br />
shouldn't believe what you read in the newspapers: but it<br />
goes without saying that every one of those dozen<br />
newspapers may have, to a greater or lesser extent, a<br />
different account either of what was said or what was<br />
meant, and the television grabs can be equally as various<br />
as can the radio commentary.<br />
Knowing that these are as much basic sources for<br />
historians as the writings of politicians and bureaucrats<br />
with necessarily defective and selective memories;<br />
knowing that the historian will have to read or speak to<br />
people who are absolute artists at covering their tracks:<br />
knowing this, and that most documents can be read in more<br />
than one way, and are deceptive if not meaningless<br />
without detailed knowledge of the context in which they<br />
are created; and knowing that every writer brings his or<br />
her own perspective and prejudice to the task that like<br />
journalists they frequently have an axe to grind:<br />
knowi * ng all this, I wonder how historians can presume to<br />
write the story at all.<br />
That is the second thing we can be sure of when the story<br />
of the last twenty-five years is told many people will<br />
say it is not the real story. They will say it is not a<br />
true story.<br />
They will be right, of course. There will never be one<br />
true story of Australia and I think we should all be glad<br />
of that.<br />
There are any number of people -Isuppose some better<br />
qualified than others who will tell you that the<br />
greatest work to be substantially researched in this<br />
Library is terribly flawed or even quite wrong.<br />
But I don't think there are many people who would say<br />
that Manning Clark's six volume History of Australia does<br />
not contain fundamental truths about Australia, or that<br />
it has not greatly enriched our understanding of<br />
ourselves and entertained us. He made our lives more<br />
interesting by weaving them into a tapestry.<br />
I'm sure that Manning Clark never intended his history to<br />
be the definitive story of Australia, any more than all<br />
those other works on Australian society are the last word<br />
on their subjects.<br />
1000 </p>
<p>Clark's work was the product of one Australian's view,<br />
one Australian's passion for the place. I think it can<br />
be said that Manning Clark's great contribution was that<br />
he encouraged us to believe that our history was worth<br />
writing and knowing. In doing that he encouraged<br />
academics, teachers and students to think about the<br />
issues and the drama of the Australian experience and<br />
encouraged all of us to think about what we could become.<br />
When you look at the works which have been researched and<br />
written in this library, it is probably true to say that<br />
many of them were directly or indirectly inspired by<br />
Clark's labour.<br />
Perhaps more than any other Australian writer, he<br />
elevated Australian history to the point where all of us<br />
could say that the story of Australia was part of the<br />
universal story uniquely Australian, but at every stage<br />
connected to the world beyond.<br />
I would not want to suggest a parallel between Manning<br />
Clark's history and its great themes and the Labor<br />
government and my role in it.<br />
Politics is too much concerned with the day to day to<br />
discern a pattern. A politician's energy is so often<br />
expended on combating necessities which in the longer run<br />
seem petty and even inconsequential.<br />
We are also required to fight on fronts which historians<br />
of the Manning Clark variety are inclined to think of as<br />
pedestrian and even philistine. Reform of the taxation<br />
system and changes to the regulations affecting banking<br />
these things were not exactly grist to Manning's mill.<br />
Nor do historians have to live out the daily grind of<br />
beating back one's political opponents.<br />
For all these reasons it is often very difficult for<br />
politicians to hang on to the long view the wvision<br />
thing" as someone called it. But let me say that the<br />
Manning Clarks of the world, the historians who work on a<br />
big canvas, can help them do it.<br />
Because, buried beneath the weight of daily necessity and<br />
all the words necessary to meet it, there is something of<br />
an affinity between we politicians and the historians.<br />
For, in truth, politicians who believe in their cause are<br />
always conscious that they have a story to tell. Indeed<br />
the telling of it is an essential ingredient of success.<br />
When a government cannot convey a story a consistent<br />
story the people lose faith in the government.<br />
It is one of the meanings of that expression for disaster<br />
" losing the plot". 1001 </p>
<p>The other meaning of the story in politics is that same<br />
vision thing, one's ambition for the country and a<br />
notion of how it might be realised.<br />
We in the Labor Party take the view that we have the<br />
vehicle the only suitable and reliable vehicle which<br />
can change Australia as necessity and ambition demand.<br />
In the 1970s some of us in the Labor Party formed the<br />
view that if Australia was to realise its great potential<br />
and meet the challenges it faced, the Party needed to be<br />
rid of its traditional phobias.<br />
Labor had to rid itself of prejudice which narrowed the<br />
possibility of change, and which in fact stood in the way<br />
of its great ideals.<br />
It had to embrace the pluralist reality of Australia. It<br />
had to make a virtue of it, extend it, celebrate it.<br />
It had to recognise and accept that, for all their<br />
collectivist traditions, Australians believed in free<br />
enterprise and that they were right to believe in it<br />
because, without question, it delivers more freedom and<br />
more wealth and, in the end, more social justice than any<br />
other.<br />
~ Labor had to open itself up to reality, to the world.<br />
It had to recognise that, perhaps as never before, the<br />
story of Australia was bound to be part of the world<br />
story.<br />
And through Labor, Australia itself could become<br />
phobia-free, conscious and proud of its best traditions<br />
and its capacity to adapt, a modern social democracy and<br />
a substantial and creative player in the world.<br />
For ten years now, despite the political machinations and<br />
the stumbles, despite all the interventions of forces<br />
within and beyond our control, this is essentially the<br />
story the Labor Government has been telling.<br />
The point of the last decade is change and improvement:<br />
to change the culture and the structure, to build on our<br />
material and human strengths and give ourselves a chance<br />
in the world.<br />
This is not the time or place to tell you why I think we<br />
now have that chance. But in the emergence of<br />
unprecedented opportunities in the Asia-Pacific, and in<br />
the fundamental changes in the Australian economy and our<br />
business and industrial culture, the chance is there. It<br />
is a better chance, I believe, than Australia has ever<br />
had before.<br />
And when the history is written, I think it will be seen<br />
that it was in these two decades that we grasped the<br />
1002 </p>
<p>chance and set Australia up for the twenty-first<br />
century. The danger is always, I think, that a country's story<br />
or the story of a political party should ossify.<br />
In our national life there are things we should hold<br />
sacred, things which no generation should be allowed to<br />
forget.<br />
Among these I would number our commitment to democracy,<br />
freedom, justice, fairness, our love of the land and our<br />
best institutions and traditions.<br />
We should keep these values forever in the foreground and<br />
of course we should honour all those in peace and war who<br />
have defended them.<br />
But, because it is anathema to those very traditions, we<br />
should resist the temptation to say that one individual<br />
or group has a monopoly on these things.<br />
I can vouch for the temptation to do this in the Labor<br />
Party. I venture to say Sir John Gorton can vouch for it<br />
in the Liberal Party.<br />
Legends give a nation strength. They give us coherence,<br />
confidence and belief. But they also have the capacity<br />
to freeze us in our tracks. They have the capacity to<br />
exclude new generations. They can underpin democracy and<br />
they can undermine it.<br />
Last year was the 50th anniversary of a number of major<br />
battles fought by Australians in defence of their<br />
country. They were as significant as any fought by<br />
Australians in a sense, more significant, because they<br />
were fought in defence of this country and the life that<br />
Australians had made here.<br />
They were fought by men and women of my parents'<br />
generation. It seemed to me that they had not been spoken for as the<br />
soldiers of the First World War had been, because they<br />
were not there at the birth of the legend of Anzac.<br />
It seemed to me appropriate last year to speak for them.<br />
And it also seemed to me that there had to be lessons to<br />
learn from these events in our region, and that we should<br />
not be afraid to confront the controversy which has long<br />
surrounded some of them.<br />
There were some who took offence at what I had to say;<br />
there were others, including veterans of the battles, who<br />
supported me. 1003 </p>
<p>My point was that in paying the respect that was due, it<br />
was necessary to recognise that the Australian military<br />
tradition like every other tradition does not belong<br />
to anyone except the Australian people.<br />
It is not the basis of a political party, interest group,<br />
religion or sect.<br />
It is not the preserve of one generation if it is<br />
allowed to become so it will die.<br />
What is more, it can most certainly withstand re-thinking<br />
and re-interpretation, just as it can withstand the<br />
addition to it of neglected episodes in our history<br />
like the Sandakan death marches, or Vietnam. In the past<br />
twelve months I have been present at the inauguration of<br />
memorials to both.<br />
My point is that if we don't question we can't imagine.<br />
It is bit like the gift an historian must have to see<br />
beyond the received wisdom and what has been set in<br />
stone.<br />
An historian has to have an imagination.<br />
So does a nation so does a government.<br />
If we can't imagine we can't determine our future, we<br />
can't act, we can't change. And we'll fall behind.<br />
That is the point about honouring our legends and<br />
traditions. We fail ourselves, we fail future<br />
generations and we fail those whose memory we are<br />
honouring if we do not re-think the meaning of received<br />
wisdom in the light of contemporary need.<br />
It seems to me the same with political parties.<br />
In the Labor Party we honour our heroes. We make much of<br />
our history and traditions.<br />
But it would be fundamentally silly to live by the letter<br />
of their thought.<br />
I have no doubt that, confronted with the necessities of<br />
this era, Ben Chifley and John Curtin would have<br />
responded with measures quite different to those they<br />
thought appropriate to the forties.<br />
And while I-know my opponents are outraged when I venture<br />
on their territory, I have to say the same is obviously<br />
true of Menzies.<br />
I mean, in recent years three historians have written<br />
books based on the Menzies papers held in the National<br />
Library's manuscripts-collection. Yet Allan Martin,<br />
Judith Brett and David Day have reached very different<br />
1004 </p>
<p>conclusions about Menzies, about what he stood for and<br />
what he means to us now.<br />
This seems to me to say not only that it is impossible to<br />
arrive at the one true story, that it depends on one's<br />
perspective; but that it is foolish to conceive of one's<br />
heroes as bearers of the Holy Grail. Or to let the ' ir<br />
life and times determine ours, or what the future will<br />
be. It is one thing to honour heroes and heroic acts, and to<br />
memorialise and see the lessons they teach. But it is<br />
another thing entirely to let them hold up the progress<br />
of succeeding generations.<br />
Let me conclude by drawing a parallel with Mabo. Just<br />
under two weeks ago, I spoke at the opening of a memorial<br />
in Sydney to the men who died in what was surely among<br />
the worst episodes in our history the death by torture,<br />
execution and disease of nearly 2000 Australians at<br />
Sandakan in Borneo.<br />
No Australian would for a moment question the propriety<br />
and historic justice in the erection of the Sandakan<br />
memorial or in the very moving ceremony that was<br />
conducted there.<br />
Yet there are people who will say that the memory of<br />
death by massacre, torture and disease, when it was<br />
inflicted on Aboriginal Australians, should be expunged.<br />
That to pay tribute to their memory is an exercise in<br />
guilt. That one memory is legitimate, the other the<br />
product of a guilt industry.<br />
I say we can't be so selective. I say that we must pay<br />
tribute to the good and the bad in our history and that<br />
when we honestly do that we are not held up but given the<br />
strength to make progress.<br />
I spoke earlier about the daily machinations,<br />
misinterpretations and accusations which are the daily<br />
stuff of politics, and which sometimes make it very<br />
difficult to keep a grip on the story.<br />
With Mabo, it is essential that we do.<br />
With Mabo, I am prepared to wear short term politics for<br />
the long term result. Mabo is part of the big story and<br />
it can't be left to short term expediency and cynical<br />
compromise. Mabo demands a mature national response. We need to see<br />
Ribo -not as a problem but as an opportunity to solve the<br />
problem. A mature national response demands honesty and<br />
imagination. Honesty because we can't build this country<br />
on a lie. </p>
<p>We need imagination because we need to imagine an<br />
Australia without the blight of Aboriginal dispossession<br />
and disadvantage.<br />
We need also the capacity to imagine what our failure<br />
would mean. What it would mean to the self-esteem of this<br />
and future generations. What it would mean to our<br />
reputation in the world. What it would mean to a future<br />
generation who, on coming to the National Library, saw in<br />
the documents here that we once had an opportunity to<br />
solve our oldest and deepest problem and we did not care<br />
enough to grasp it.<br />
