<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>Australia is experiencing the longest unbroken period of economic expansion in its history.</p>
<p>There are more people in work than ever before and business - both big and small - remain optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>While not everyone is enjoying the benefits of our current prosperity, the economic outlook is very positive. </p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund yesterday handed down a special report on the Australian economy describing it amongst the very best in the world.</p>
<p>Despite this, I believe we can do better.</p>
<p>I believe that Australia can have a full-employment economy - where anyone who wants a job and is able to work -  has a job.</p>
<p>And not just any job, but one that leads to a lasting career.</p>
<p>The Labor Party - by reversing the Government's workplace reforms - would make a full-employment economy an unattainable goal.</p>
<p>Their plan to abolish laws that encourage small business to take on more staff would have a damaging impact on the job market and lead to higher unemployment.</p>
<p>The Coalition has a plan to maintain Australia's prosperity - Labor has a plan to wreck it.  </p>
