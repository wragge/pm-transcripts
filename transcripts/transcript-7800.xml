PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH WAYNE GOSS, MOUNT<br />
ISA CIVIC CENTRE, B NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, were you embarrassed by the actions of<br />
the Mount Isa TLC?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: for supporting the pilots?<br />
PM: If I'd thought that the Mount Isa TLC had come out in<br />
support of the pilots I would be eabarrassed to some extent,<br />
but as the Mount Isa TLC hasn't cone out in such support then<br />
I'm not embarrassed. What has happened is that you've had a<br />
ass eeting of six people and that decision has been<br />
repudiated by everyone that's spoken to me as being totally<br />
unrepresentative of the view of the unions and workers here<br />
in Mount Isa and I so regard it.<br />
JOURNALISTt The<br />
meeting, are you<br />
it incorrect? President says there were<br />
saying that the President 13 people at the<br />
of the TLC has got<br />
PM: I'm saying the Secretary told me last night there were<br />
six.<br />
JOURNALIST: President. So you believe the Secretary but not the<br />
PM: I haven't spoken to the President.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you expect him to go after that?<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you expect him to<br />
PR: Well, that's a matter for the TLC. I didn't, Wayne and<br />
I didn't come here to tell the TLC how to run their internal<br />
affairs. That's for them.<br />
0 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Goss, do you agree with the Prime Minister's<br />
industrial relations action On the pilots?<br />
GOSS: Well, I mean, let's face the facto. The pilots'<br />
strike put the Prime Minister and the Federal Government in a<br />
no win situation. I think people would have been ripping<br />
the Government apart and the economy would have been falling<br />
apart if we'd had a 30 percent wage jump for the pilots, it<br />
would have been followed right around the country. I can't<br />
see that that could have been good for the country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have the TLC embarrassed you by that action?<br />
GOSS: No, not at all. The coments that I've had from<br />
people in Mount Isa since I got here is exactly the same am<br />
what people have said to Bob. That is that at a meeting of<br />
half a dozen, or at the most 13, people and from what I<br />
understand Mr Byrne is right out of step with his own Union,<br />
the Metal Worker. Union. I understand that the Metal Worker.<br />
union put up the original proposition to the ? CTU and they<br />
have stated their position. Mr Byrne is a metal worker and<br />
he is way out of step with his own Union. I think he's<br />
pretty such out on his own.<br />
JOURNALIST: There's a split in the TLC though and that<br />
doesn't augur well for the Labor Party in this<br />
GOSS: Anybody wants to put money on MoGrady, money against<br />
Mcorady rather, I'll see them after Look a. I understand<br />
it, if there'. halt a dozen or, at most, a dozen people at a<br />
meeting it's not representative. The person who put it up is<br />
out of step with his own Union. It's not a matter of concern<br />
or embarrassment to me in the slightest.<br />
JOURNLIST: Would you endorse him being rolled by the TLC<br />
tomorrow? GOSS: I have no interest in the matter. It's up to the TLC<br />
however they resolve it privately.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed at all that on this trip to<br />
Mount Isa where you're campaigning the focus remains on<br />
State issues, that a Federal issue like this dominated your<br />
visit? GOSS: No, not at all. The state campaign is going very<br />
well, this tour is going very yell. We had a tremendous<br />
response in North Queensland yesterday the response today so<br />
far has been great and I think we're right on track and we'll<br />
stay on track.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will you be doing any campaigning for<br />
Kr Goes in Queensland during the election campaign? </p>
<p>PM: That's what I've been doing in the last 24 hours and as<br />
far as I can 5eeg it's boen pretty effective. If there's<br />
another chance of getting up here I will. We've got a tight<br />
program, I've got to travel all around Australia and there's<br />
Federal Parliament, but if there's a chance of getting up<br />
again I will.<br />
JOURNALISTt ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Welli I didn't say at the time he warn down there<br />
and I had breakfast at the Lodge with Wayne, we had a very<br />
congenial discussion there. We share one thing absolutely in<br />
coon that this is an issue about politics in Queensland,<br />
about State politics. You're not going to divert, in my<br />
judgement, the people's attention in Queensland away friom the<br />
fact that they have now suffered for a generation and more<br />
from the worst Government in Australia, the most corruapt<br />
Government. The Government with diverse resources from the<br />
many to the fewv, to the cronies. Those are the overwhelming<br />
S issues in this campaign and Wayne Goss is absolutely right in<br />
wanting to ensure that the concentration of the peo pIs of<br />
Queensland is honed in on those things. In the period that<br />
I've been here, in the last 24 hours, that's what I've been<br />
talking about. The simple issue. That is there is only one<br />
way, only one way the people of Queensland are going to clean<br />
Government in Queensland and that's by electing a Goes Labor<br />
Government because what they must never forget is that for<br />
the overwhelming majority of this period of darkness in<br />
Queensland politics, the Liberals have been part of it. You<br />
can't cleanse Government in Queesiland other than by the<br />
election of Goss and Labor and Wayne is absolutely right to<br />
be concentrating on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: so you didn't take it as a personal snub-<br />
PH: There was no personal snub, there wasn't any.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mfr Hawke, how much emphasis do you put on the<br />
0 State election with a Federal election looming?<br />
PM: I would put it this way, I would obviously as far as you<br />
want to talk about the Federal scene, I would obviously<br />
prefer a Goens Labor Government in Queensland and some<br />
continuation of the darkness of the conservatives. That<br />
would be better for the people of Queensland to have Goss<br />
Labor in. It would be better for us federally, but that's<br />
not the way in which I'm viewing it. I mean, this is about<br />
the Government of Queensland.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Labor opposition here in Queensland going<br />
to be hampered by your interest rates J </p>
<p>PM: The people Of Queen. 1&amp; fd would be hampered if we'd had a<br />
position where we'd said we'll just slacken policy and have a<br />
situation where demand would just go through the roof. If<br />
you'd had that the economy would have collapsed. I mean,<br />
I'm a very, very attuned politician. I haven't got interest<br />
rates high because I like it. They're there because they are<br />
necessary to keep the level of activity down. But that's not<br />
basically the issue of concern here because-State Governments<br />
don't set the level of interest rates they can set their<br />
views and so on, they will and obviously when Wayne Goan<br />
become the Premier of Queensland we'll listen very closely<br />
to what he has to say about the issues of Queensland<br />
generally. But however much you or anyone else in the<br />
conservative parties may want to have diversionary tactics,<br />
the simple fact in thisf that it'. had the Nationals and the<br />
Liberal Party running Queensland in this corrupt, unclean<br />
manner for over a generation. If you're going to change<br />
that, then you've got to change the Government and elect Goes<br />
Labor. That's the issue, there's no other.<br />
JOURXALIST: It was maid in a newspaper yesterday, I think<br />
the Australian, that South Australia and perhaps even<br />
Queensland do you put that sort of weight on most<br />
elections? As far as you're concerned, must Labor take those<br />
two elections for the safety of your Government?<br />
PM% No, no, not at all. I mean, what will decide the<br />
election federally, when we have it, will be the<br />
consideration by the Australian people of our policies<br />
against the policie, of the conservatives. We'll. win that<br />
election and win it comfortably. Now, as I said qite<br />
honestly, I mean, I don't muck around on these things. I'll<br />
be much happier from the general political point of view when<br />
Bannon is re-elected, as he will be, and when Goes gets<br />
elected.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PN: Just a minute, let me finish. I mean, obviously that's<br />
the outcome that we would prefer. It's the one I think we'll<br />
get. JOURNALIST: But were you saying at the start of your answer<br />
that you could afford to lose those </p>
<p>PM: No. I mean, I'm fascinated by this Press conference.<br />
The tortured way, I mean, I really an fascinated. You ought<br />
to read the transcript. The tortured way in which so many of<br />
you are trying to avoid what the issue is. I mean, let's<br />
understand out there what ordinary Queenslanders are about.<br />
They are about a question of whether they are going to have<br />
any more of the corrupt, unclean State Government of<br />
Queensland provided by the National Party and the Libs. You<br />
can torture yourself not for very much longer because, you<br />
know, I'm not going to put up with it much longer, I've got<br />
to go to catch a plans to Xelbourne you can torture this<br />
issue an much a. you like about other issues. About whether<br />
a bloke here at the Trades and Labour Council of mount Isa<br />
has upset this campaign remarkable, we've had ten<br />
minutes of that. Go for your life. The simple issue is the<br />
one I've put and it's the one I think which will mean that<br />
Wayne Goes will be elected as the Labor Premier in<br />
Queensland. JOURNALIST: Country Task Force submission since July,<br />
when can we expect<br />
PM: These things will be, obviously, looked at in the Budget<br />
context. I've had the opportunity of representations from my<br />
friend Tony NcGrady here on that and others. I've given then<br />
a straightforward answer. We'll look at those things in the<br />
Budget context. You don't come up and make an announcement<br />
here about those sorts of things.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Mawke, the raising of homosexuality has been<br />
raised in the state election. Do you see that as a sign of<br />
desperation or a real issue?<br />
PM: A sign of massive desperation. I mean, I've been in<br />
public life now for 30 year. and in public life you get used<br />
to it. It's hypocrisy. But I wrack my brain as sku h as<br />
I can. I can't think of a greater exaple of hypocrisy in<br />
the post War history of pol itics in this country in that this<br />
mob, the Nationals, are talking about public morality. They<br />
have debased and debauched moral standards in public life in<br />
a way never before seen in the history of politics in this<br />
country. For those people to be talking about moral issues<br />
is laughable in the extreme and will be so regarded by the<br />
electors of Queensland, in my judgement.<br />
