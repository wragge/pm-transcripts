    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce a major upgrade of the Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Cairns as part of our 2020 plan for Australia's Transport Future, with a major focus on North Queensland between Sarina and Cairns.</p>
<p>This upgrade will deliver flood immunity, more overtaking lanes and improved intersections along the length of the Bruce Highway, while also upgrading the quality of the road.</p>
<p>The Bruce Highway is the main artery connecting North Queensland to Brisbane and the rest of the nation.  The Australian Government has long been committed to upgrading this vital link.  Over the current five years from 2004/05 to 2008/9 the Australian Government is investing $800 million to improve the Bruce Highway, but we recognise more must be done.  </p>
<p>The Australian Government will significantly increase its investment by $2 billion for the five years from 2009, with further investment to follow by 2020. North Queensland will receive the majority of the funding for the Bruce Highway, with Sarina to Cairns receiving $800 million over the five years to 2014 with priorities to include:</p>
<p>   * Providing, by no later than 2020, flood immunity to the standard recommended by the Queensland Government (Q50) i.e. no more than 48 hours cut in a 1 in 50 years flood, with minimal closure during other major floods i.e. less than 6 hours.  Flood plains to be targeted include the Burdekin, Herbert, Tully, North Johnstone and Mulgrave Rivers.<br />
   * The Cardwell Range crossing upgrade,<br />
   * Rehabilitation of bridges, including the Burdekin River Bridge,<br />
   * Increased overtaking lanes and passing opportunities,<br />
   * Pavement upgrades and renewal, including widening and strengthening, and<br />
   * Improved intersections and urban links.</p>
<p>This builds on the current Australian Government commitment to the Bruce Highway, which includes in North Queensland:</p>
<p>   * $220 million improving the overall condition of the Bruce Highway between Townsville and Cairns.  These funds are to enable a range of improvements to be undertaken, including pavement upgrades, widening, extra overtaking lanes, upgrading of flood immunity, improvements to intersections and the Mt Low Parkway project.<br />
   * $148 million the flood works on the Bruce Highway near Tully.<br />
   * These funds are in Queensland's bank account waiting to be spent.</p>
<p>The balance of the funds will be allocated on a priority basis for works between Sarina and Brisbane.  This will include $450 million to upgrade the highway between Sarina and Gympie, more overtaking lanes and safer intersections including the interchange between the Bruce and Dawson Highways, safer southern highway access to Gin Gin and upgrades to the failing bitumen on the Sunshine Coast section of the highway.</p>
<p>This $2 billion investment by the Australian Government will bring the total funding since 2004/05 on the Bruce Highway to $2.8 billion.  The onus is now on the Queensland Government.  I have been disappointed that they have not delivered previous upgrades on the ground in a timely fashion and within budget.  </p>
<p>As a result of the strong economy and our healthy budget, the Australian Government is able to invest in important road projects such as the Bruce Highway upgrade.  </p>
