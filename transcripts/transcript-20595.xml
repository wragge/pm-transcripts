    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the list of awardees for the Centenary Medal has been finalised and recipients will shortly receive their medals. Their names can be found on the website "<a href="http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au">www.itsanhonour.gov.au</a>".</p>
<p> The Centenary Medal was created to recognise the achievements of a cross-section of the Australian community at the time of the centenary of federation and to prepare for the challenges of the new century by honouring persons who have contributed to Australian society or government. This is an important medal and it is desirable that contributions made during the centenary year especially by those who helped make it a memorable time in the life of the nation be recognised.</p>
<p> Nominations in the General List were brought forward during 2002 by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and parliamentarians. These were assessed by an independent Council chaired by Professor Geoffrey Blainey AC. The Centenary Medal also recognises Australians born in 1901 or earlier who were alive on 1 January 2001 ('centenarians').</p>
<p> The total number of medals approved is 15,500 and they represent a cross-section of service to the nation both geographically and by type of service. The contribution may have been to the local com-munity, a region, a particular activity or profession. Many who are being recognised have served selflessly and without regard for personal recognition for lengthy periods on a voluntary basis through, amongst other activities, the elderly, youth, rural fire service and emergency services, veterans and their families and indigenous Australians. The medal is also being awarded to those whose achievements have made a national or international impact through science, research or the arts.</p>
<p> In Queensland, the Northern Territory and Canberra, medals are being mailed to awardees direct. They will subsequently be invited to Vice-Regal functions to affirm and celebrate their medals. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, federal members have been invited to hold medal presentations. Where this will not occur, medals are being mailed to awardees.</p>
<p>Australia, by recognising this remarkable group, reminds itself of the values that we as a society hold dear. We are inspired by their example. On behalf of the whole nation I thank and congratulate all recipients of the Centenary Medal. </p>
