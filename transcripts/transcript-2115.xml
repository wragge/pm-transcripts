COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALl I ,1<br />
SPEECH<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
COMMONWEALTH AND QUEENSLAND SUGAR<br />
AG REEMENT<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates, 25 September 1969]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-The negotiations between the<br />
Commonwealth and Queensland governments<br />
for a new sugar agreement have<br />
been satisfactorily concluded and the basis<br />
on which that formal agreement can now<br />
be drafted has been arranged. The agreement<br />
between the two governments will be<br />
the most recent in a very long line of agreements<br />
which go back to the 1 920s. They<br />
assumed their present form in 1934. The<br />
basic objectives which the sugar agreements<br />
were designed to serve had been endorsed<br />
by every Commonwealth government, and<br />
no less by the present Government. These<br />
were to regulate the marketing of sugar<br />
in the interests of both sugar producers and<br />
consumers. The agreement which has now been<br />
negotiated will be substantially the same as<br />
the one it replaces. It will run for 5 years,<br />
during which the Commonwealth has agreed<br />
that it will continue the present embargo<br />
on the import of sugar and sugar products,<br />
and the Queensland Government will control<br />
raw sugar production and meet Australian<br />
needs for refined sugar and sugar<br />
products at agreed maximum prices as a<br />
first priority. The assurance of supplies for<br />
relatively long periods at fixed prices for<br />
a stable commodity is of inestimable benefit<br />
22650/ 69 to both sugar producers and domestic consumers.<br />
Australian domestic prices have<br />
remained constant from 1960 to 1967<br />
despite very wide fluctuations in world<br />
prices. The domestic sugar rebate scheme, which<br />
has been a feature of sugar agreements for<br />
a very long period, will be continued in the<br />
new agreement but the rate of rebate will<br />
be increased from $ 10 to $ 15 per ton from<br />
1st July 1969 to bring it back towards the<br />
position it held before the 1967 sugar price<br />
increase of S25 per ton. This will be the<br />
only change of any substance in the new<br />
agreement. To finance the increased rate<br />
it has been agreed that the funds made<br />
available by the State, on behalf of the<br />
raw sugar industry, to pay the domestic<br />
rebate will be increased to $ 924,000 a year.<br />
Although on the face of things it might<br />
appear that this imposes an additional<br />
burden on the raw sugar industry, this is<br />
far from the case. The sugar industry's<br />
interests are best served when consumption<br />
in the domestic market-its best marketis<br />
maximised. The increase in the domestic<br />
rebate is designed to serve the interests of<br />
both the fruit processing industry and the<br />
raw sugar industry. In the case of the<br />
former industry, this assistance takes the<br />
form. of the provision of an additional </p>
<p>incentive to processors to purchase fruit for<br />
processing at reasonable prices. In the case<br />
of the sugar industry, the advantage of<br />
maximising domestic consumption is<br />
patently clear when it is realised that the<br />
alternative to domestic usage is exports at<br />
the vagaries of the world market price.<br />
The maximum wholesale domestic prices<br />
for sugar and sugar products, which are<br />
prescribed in the existing agreement, will<br />
remain unaltered in the new agreement.<br />
The export sugar rebate arrangements,<br />
which had also been a conspicuous feature<br />
of past agreements, will continue to apply.<br />
This rebate ensures that exporters of products<br />
in which sugar has been used will<br />
obtain their requirements at prices related<br />
broadly to the Australian import parity<br />
price or, in other words, what they would<br />
have paid had there been no embargo on<br />
the importation of sugar. This will continue<br />
to ensure that the unique position granted<br />
to the local sugar industry did not react<br />
to the detriment of exporters and is in keeping<br />
with the Government's policy to do<br />
everything possible to encourage the<br />
maximum exports of both the products<br />
using sugar and, as a consequence, the<br />
sugar contained in those exports. Since the<br />
export of sugar in manufactured products<br />
is not a charge against Australia's quota<br />
under the International Sugar Agreement,<br />
the maximum utilisation of sugar in<br />
exported manufactured products is of vital<br />
interest and great benefit to sugar producers.<br />
Experience in operating the provisions of<br />
the existing agreement, since the last major<br />
review in 1962, has indicated that some<br />
changes can make it more effective in its<br />
operation and clearer in its expression.<br />
During the drafting of the new agreement<br />
the opportunity will be taken to effect these adjustments, which are largely of a technical<br />
or drafting nature and will have no<br />
bearing on the principles on which the<br />
agreement is based. This, as previously<br />
indicated, will follow the traditional lines<br />
of previous agreements. Action is in hand<br />
to prepare a formal new agreement and the<br />
two governments have agreed to extend the<br />
operation of the present agreement to give<br />
time for this work to be completed. They<br />
have also agreed that the new agreement<br />
will have retrospective effect from 1st July<br />
1969. Since it is not possible to bring the new<br />
sugar agreement before the Parliament in<br />
its present session, and since it was agreed<br />
by both the Commonwealth and the State<br />
of Queensland that it is in the interests of<br />
both producers and consumers that it<br />
should be brought into operation as soon<br />
as possible, it has been agreed that it will<br />
come into full force and effect upon its<br />
signing in order that the benefits could commence<br />
to flow without delay. The new<br />
agreement would need to be brought before<br />
the new Parliament early in its life.<br />
I am confident that Australian sugar producers<br />
and domestic consumers will find<br />
the terms of the new agreement acceptable<br />
and in their long term interests. In the<br />
case of sugar producers, it gives them the<br />
assurance of sole access, at remunerative<br />
prices, to their largest single market for a<br />
reasonable period. Domestic consumers are<br />
assured of constant supplies at stable prices.<br />
In conclusion, it has been agreed between<br />
the parties that, since Commonwealth<br />
parliamentary debate on this agreement is<br />
not possible this session, printed copies of<br />
the formal agreement, when signed, would<br />
be prepared by the Commonwealth for distribution<br />
to interested parties.<br />
