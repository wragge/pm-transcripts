<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, welcome.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Any tips for other leaders on how to weather a financial crisis?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can only speak from the Australian experience. We got our</p>
<p> domestic economic house in order. We cut a big budget deficit we inherited.</p>
<p> It was $10.5 billion three years ago. It's now in surplus. We</p>
<p> have allowed a sensible management, an open management of our exchange</p>
<p> rate. We have reformed our labour markets, although we still have</p>
<p> distance to go in that area. We've kept inflation down. And we've</p>
<p> got a strong competition policy. And, very importantly, we have won</p>
<p> the support of the Australian people but not yet the full Parliament</p>
<p> to reform our taxation system.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Well, talking about that taxation system, it is finding a lot of problems</p>
<p> getting through the Parliament. How are you planning to continue to</p>
<p> push that through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the final vote will be taken in our Upper House, our Senate,</p>
<p> by the 30th of June. We had an election in which this was</p>
<p> the main issue and that was five months ago and the Australian people</p>
<p> returned my Government with a very comfortable majority. So we'll</p>
<p> be continuing to say to the Senate, listen to the verdict of the Australian</p>
<p> people. We need tax reform. The message I give repeatedly to the Australian</p>
<p> people and, indeed, to anybody else is that the reform process is</p>
<p> never finished. Countries that imagine they've got it made by</p>
<p> having maintained strong growth for a period of time are deluding</p>
<p> themselves. You must always keep finding new ways to further strengthen</p>
<p> your economy. And if you don't do that the gains of the past</p>
<p> will be dissipated through the laziness of the future.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Well, we'll come back to that in a little bit. I just want to</p>
<p> ask you about the economy's strength. A lot of the economy's</p>
<p> strength has been due to exporters' ability to buy new markets headed</p>
<p> by a lower Australian dollar. Now that the Aussie dollar has rebounded</p>
<p> from that all-time low it reached last year and is showing signs of</p>
<p> strength, does that mean Australian exporters are going to have trouble?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I don't respond to those sort of questions because whatever</p>
<p> I say might be misconstrued as some observation about where I think</p>
<p> the dollar is going. You either have a flexible exchange rate or you</p>
<p> don't. We have a flexible exchange rate. There's very strong</p>
<p> support to maintain a floating exchange rate in Australia and the</p>
<p> Reserve Bank has run exchange rate policy very well. And the Australian</p>
<p> dollar, like the Australian economy, has responded to changed circumstances.</p>
<p> The best thing we are doing for Australian exporters is to change</p>
<p> the tax system. Because if you have a broad-based, indirect tax replacing</p>
<p> rather discriminatory indirect taxes you take, in Australian terms,</p>
<p> about $4.5 billion a year off the cost of our exports and that is</p>
<p> a huge injection of support for Australian exporters.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>You and your Cabinet are about to consider proposals to encourage</p>
<p> international financial institutions to choose Australia as their</p>
<p> base, in the Asia-Pacific region, other countries such as Singapore</p>
<p> and Hong Kong. So far no Australian leader's been able to offer</p>
<p> the incentive that people in financial industries seem to think are</p>
<p> necessary. How will your approach be different to trying to get these</p>
<p> incentives here in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've already made a number of changes. And our tax plan</p>
<p> contains massive incentives for the building of Australia as a financial</p>
<p> system. And we're going to take, as part of the package, we're</p>
<p> going to take some taxes off banking and other financial transactions.</p>
<p> We're going to take taxation off share transfers. And we really</p>
<p> are going to make it far more attractive to trade securities and shares</p>
<p> and like instruments in Australia through taxation and other changes</p>
<p> than it is now. And when you add those to the fundamental strengths</p>
<p> of the Australian economy and the fact that cities like Sydney now</p>
<p> are, despite their size and cosmopolitan character, cheaper in many</p>
<p> respects than places like Hong Kong and Singapore, you've got</p>
<p> a very powerful cocktail making Australia most attractive as an international</p>
<p> financial centre.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Are you, in person, planning any trip offshore to actually sell this</p>
<p> message?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I have a number of travel plans that are being worked out at</p>
<p> the present time and obviously if they were to take me to Japan and</p>
<p> the United States, that would be very helpful. But just at the moment,</p>
<p> for obvious diplomatic and courtesy reasons, I can't really say</p>
<p> any more.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>So any idea about possible timing if that was to take place?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not at this stage, it really is dependent upon a number of factors</p>
<p> and I really can't say any more at the present time. But obviously</p>
<p> prime ministerial visits are important but, in the end, people make</p>
<p> decisions based on how you perform. And if our economy continues to</p>
<p> perform well, if we continue to have low cost, low inflation, if we</p>
<p> can reform our tax system and we can get those reforms that the public</p>
<p> voted for through the Parliament then they will strike a very heavy</p>
<p> further blow in favour of Australia as a financial centre, particularly</p>
<p> in the Asian Pacific region.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>And are those the sort of things that you will tell leaders of other</p>
<p> countries as an incentive, and businesses of other countries, as an</p>
<p> incentive to plant their bases in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely, but I've been doing it on a very regular basis. And,</p>
<p> of course, leaders of other countries are advised as to how other</p>
<p> countries are performing but if it's reinforced at a head of</p>
<p> Government level that obviously helps.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>You've said you want to reduce the company tax rate to 30% from</p>
<p> 36%. How vital is business taxation reform for the wellbeing of Australian</p>
<p> companies and what will it mean for company profits?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, company profits in Australia at the moment are very good, although</p>
<p> some companies in the resource and commodities area are not doing</p>
<p> as well because commodity prices are low. And even though the Australian</p>
<p> economy is very strong, I acknowledge that in the weakness of commodity</p>
<p> prices that is having an adverse affect on some of our more efficient</p>
<p> operators despite their best efforts. We have a review of business</p>
<p> taxation being conducted at the moment by John Ralph, a very prominent</p>
<p> and respected Australian businessman. And one of the options he's</p>
<p> laid out is that you could take the Australian company tax rate down</p>
<p> from 36% to 30% for everybody, but you would have to pay for that</p>
<p> by withdrawing concessions in the Taxation Act that benefit only a</p>
<p> section of the corporate community. And we've got to make a judgement</p>
<p> as we debate these issues, and it's out in the public for debate</p>
<p> now, we've got to make a judgement as to whether we want everybody</p>
<p> to have a company tax rate of 30% at the price of some people who</p>
<p> now have concessions like accelerated depreciation losing some or</p>
<p> all of those concessions. Now it's an interesting debate and</p>
<p> I've got an open mind. I want to hear the arguments. Obviously</p>
<p> we all like to have a like to have a low tax rate but we also want</p>
<p> to hear argument about the impact of that. So it's a debate that</p>
<p> has commenced and it will go on for some months.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Mr Ralph has also said the national economy is at a cross-road. It</p>
<p> can continue as a commodity based capital intensive economy </p>
<p> the old image of Australia as the world's quarry  or it</p>
<p> can move to becoming a modern service based industry. Which way will</p>
<p> the Government steer the economy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's never an ideal world. I mean we could always depend</p>
<p> quite heavily on commodities because we are efficient farmers and</p>
<p> we are efficient miners. And we are also quite efficient manufacturers</p>
<p> in many areas. But new opportunities are opening up and the goal of</p>
<p> good policy is to give everybody the maximum opportunity. And the</p>
<p> other goal of good policy is to have a flexibly run economy so that</p>
<p> when area goes down your instruments of policy are flexible enough</p>
<p> to allow other areas to go up unimpeded.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Your Government oversaw one of the most successful public share offers</p>
<p> when it sold a third of the State owned telecommunications company</p>
<p> Telstra. Still as we touched on before, there are problems in the</p>
<p> Parliament, you were unable to get that legislation through Parliament</p>
<p> to sell the rest of it. In the face of strong resistance from opposition</p>
<p> parties and the general public, do you believe the Australian Government</p>
<p> can achieve its plan to sell another 16% of Telstra to investors this</p>
<p> year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're going to keep trying. We're hopeful that we can</p>
<p> get that legislation through. We now have 40% of the Australian public</p>
<p> owning shares. We're one of the great share owning democracies</p>
<p> in the world and people who bought shares in the one-third float of</p>
<p> the capital of Telstra have done very well. And we are encouraged</p>
<p> to keep trying. These things are on-going debates and what you have</p>
<p> to do in public life if you don't always succeed the first time</p>
<p> is to keep coming back. And I'm going to keep coming back on</p>
<p> the issue of privatisation because I believe in it. I believe that</p>
<p> we'll have a more efficient Telstra and we'll have a more</p>
<p> open and competitive telecommunications system in our country. We'll</p>
<p> be able to take on the world more effectively if we have a more open</p>
<p> system and that means full privatisation. And I know some people try</p>
<p> and whip up fear campaigns about it but I don't believe that</p>
<p> they have any substance and we remain very strongly committed in trying</p>
<p> to achieve these outcomes.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Well it brings us back to the question of the Upper House with the</p>
<p> balance of power in the Senate changing as a result of the October....election</p>
<p> last October. From July this year the minority Australian Democrats</p>
<p> will hold sway and they've made it clear that they don't</p>
<p> support many of the changes your Government has proposed such as tax</p>
<p> reform, the Telstra sale and labour reforms which you said are necessary</p>
<p> to reduce the unemployment rate. How will you avoid those deadlocks</p>
<p> in the new Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you've got to take each piece of legislation as it comes.</p>
<p> You don't lay down some blanket approach. You don't see</p>
<p> the Democrats getting the full balance of power until the 1st</p>
<p> of July this year. There's a bit of water to flow under the bridge</p>
<p> and there are a few votes to be taken before then. I'm optimistic</p>
<p> that when the vote is taken on the taxation legislation the minor</p>
<p> party and independents in the Senate will remember that we had an</p>
<p> election on the 3rd of October last year. The main issue</p>
<p> was our tax plan. We were open and honest and candid and forthright</p>
<p> with the Australian people and we would like them to listen, if not</p>
<p> to us, to the verdict of the Australian people.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>So you're going to have a busy next few months?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're always busy if you are in the business of further strengthening</p>
<p> your economy and not resting on laurels. We've done well, we're</p>
<p> doing well. But no country can remain completely unaffected and we</p>
<p> have to keep making changes to strengthen the Australian economy so</p>
<p> that we can keep taking advantage of the strengths that we've</p>
<p> built up over the past few years.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>On a different note here Prime Minister, Australian businesses are</p>
<p> expected to spend about A$10 billion to fix the problem with the so-called</p>
<p> millenium bug. How ready are Australian companies to deal with the</p>
<p> glitch?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well so far the general scene is very positive and we've put</p>
<p> a lot of resources in at a Government level, and we've passed</p>
<p> some good Samaritan legislation recently. So we're pretty strongly</p>
<p> of the view that a lot is being done but as always with these things</p>
<p> some countries and some sections of the community are complacent.</p>
<p> The message we are giving out is that nobody can be complacent. It's</p>
<p> one of those issues where you get a variety of expert opinion although</p>
<p> the strong balance seems to be very much in favour of the need which</p>
<p> we support for people both in the public and the private sectors of</p>
<p> the economy to take all the precautions they can.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Your Communications Minister Richard Alston says he's invited</p>
<p> you to spend New Year's Eve 1999 with him flying in the cockpit</p>
<p> of a plane. Will you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've received many invitations on New Year's Eve but</p>
<p> if Richard deems that necessary well I'll give it serious consideration.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just a few quick issues overseas. Late last week pro-Indonesian</p>
<p> East Timorese armed militia leaders threatened to kill Australian</p>
<p> diplomats or journalist in East Timor because of the Government's</p>
<p> policy on East Timor. How great a concern is this threat?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the situation in East Timor is obviously a quite fluid and unstable.</p>
<p> Our position is very clear. We want the voice of the East Timorese</p>
<p> people to be listened to. We would prefer that in the short term at</p>
<p> least there be autonomy within the Indonesian State because if there's</p>
<p> too rapid a transition to full independence then what could be left</p>
<p> behind could be very unstable and pragmatic and can lead to potential</p>
<p> not only bloodshed but economic breakdown. Australia is prepared to</p>
<p> play her part and play it fully irrespective of the outcome. But we</p>
<p> want others to share the responsibility including the Europeans and</p>
<p> the Americans and of course Indonesia who has after all exercised</p>
<p> sovereignity over East Timor for 24 years and have that exercise of</p>
<p> sovereignty recognised by the world including Australia. Indonesia</p>
<p> has the responsibilities as well. We remain naturally concerned about</p>
<p> the safety of our own people and that will be uppermost in our minds,</p>
<p> and that of the Government's.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Has Indonesia, as far as you're concerned, indicated that it</p>
<p> is going to take up that responsibility as far as East Timor's</p>
<p> future goes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The talks we've had with Indonesia within the last week or so</p>
<p> have been very constructive and my Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer,</p>
<p> who's done a quite outstanding job particularly over the last</p>
<p> week in relation to East Timor, has had very good discussions with</p>
<p> the Indonesian Foreign Minister. He has also been in Lisbon, he went</p>
<p> through London on the way home and he got back to Australia this morning.</p>
<p> And what we are trying to do on a broad-based diplomatic front is</p>
<p> to impress upon the whole world the importance of everybody making</p>
<p> a contribution. Obviously some have a greater responsibility than</p>
<p> others  Portugal as a former metropolitan power, Indonesia as</p>
<p> the country with autonomy at present and Australia as a near neighbour</p>
<p> and longstanding friend of both Indonesia and the people of East Timor.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Well, [inaudible] to rock various parts of the rest of Indonesia ahead</p>
<p> of elections this year. Does that instability affect Australia as</p>
<p> a close neighbour?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't directly affect us. We are concerned, we remain</p>
<p> very committed to a close relationship between our country and Indonesia.</p>
<p> We were able to help Indonesia economically and politically last year.</p>
<p> President Habibie and his Government face a very, very difficult situation.</p>
<p> It's a very large country, it's been devastated by the Asian</p>
<p> economic downturn and one can understand the unrest that is occurring</p>
<p> and on top of that there's a very strong drive to a more open,</p>
<p> democratic society and there are elections in June. And we see those</p>
<p> as an opportunity for renewal in Indonesia and the involvement of</p>
<p> more of the Indonesian people in shaping that country's future.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>One final question Prime Minister. Australia is moving towards becoming</p>
<p> a republic, losing Queen Elizabeth II and England as its head of State,</p>
<p> there's going to be a public vote on this issue this November,</p>
<p> which way do you think it's going to go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. I think it's too early to make a judgement.</p>
<p> There are a lot of people who think the republican system of government</p>
<p> would be better, there are many others who believe that the present</p>
<p> system has served Australia remarkably well, that Australia for all</p>
<p> practical purposes has been an independent country for 70 to 100 years.</p>
<p> I don't think anybody has any doubt that there's a distinctive</p>
<p> Australian identity. That's been self-evident for a very long</p>
<p> time indeed. I don't know how the referendum will go and there</p>
<p> are some who argue that if we are to become a republic then we should</p>
<p> have a completely different system of government. And all of those</p>
<p> are going to be thrown into the mix and it will be very interesting</p>
<p> to see the outcome. And within the Government parties there's</p>
<p> a free or open vote, there's no firm Government line. Different</p>
<p> members of the Government have different views and I am allowing a</p>
<p> free or open vote.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>With all those different aspects thrown into mix is it going to be</p>
<p> quite complicated for people to give a straight yes or no whether........</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it's complicated at all. I think the Australian</p>
<p> people are perfectly capable of making up their own minds one way</p>
<p> or another. If they vote yes, well we will change on the 1st</p>
<p> of January in the year 2001 which is the Centenary of our Federation.</p>
<p> If we vote no we won't change. Either way, Australia will go</p>
<p> on regardless. We are a free, open, independent, distinctive society</p>
<p> which is composed of people from all around the world. And we have</p>
<p> our own character and our own values and our own traditions and they</p>
<p> will endure unimpaired, untouched, irrespective of the outcome of</p>
<p> the referendum. I don't think it's really going to make</p>
<p> an enormous difference either way.</p>
<p>SAVAGE:</p>
<p>Right. Mr Howard, thank you very much for your time.</p>
