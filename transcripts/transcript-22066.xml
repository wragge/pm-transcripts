    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was particularly saddened to learn of the death earlier today of former Senator and Labor Government Minister Peter Cook.</p>
<p>He courageously fought the cancer which ultimately claimed his life. To his wife Barbara and other members of his family I extend the sympathy of myself, my wife Janette and Members of the Government.</p>
<p>Peter Cook had a very successful, varied and accomplished career both in the Trade Union Movement and the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>The highlights of his career were his service as a Minister in different portfolios within the Labor Governments of the Hawke-Keating period.</p>
<p>For the time that he was Minister for Industrial Relations I was his opposite number. He held tenaciously to his beliefs on issues within this portfolio. I respected him both for this and the strength of advocacy of his position.</p>
<p> Mr Cook's widow Barbara has indicated that she and the family will accept the Government's offer of a State Funeral.   </p>
