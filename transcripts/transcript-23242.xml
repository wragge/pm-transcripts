    <content><![CDATA[<p>When Prime Minister Keating made his famous Redfern speech in 1992, I was an opposition staffer.</p>
<p>My job was to disagree with everything he said.</p>
<p>While I could quibble with aspects of that speech, I couldn’t disagree with its central point: that our failures towards Australia’s first people were a stain on our soul.</p>
<p>That was a watershed moment for me, as for others.</p>
<p>Many of us have been on a long journey.</p>
<p>I can’t say that I have always been where I am now.</p>
<p>The further this journey has gone, the more, for me, Aboriginal policy has become personal rather than just political.</p>
<p>It has become a personal mission to help my fellow Australians to open their hearts, as much as to change their minds, on Aboriginal policy.</p>
<p>We are a great country – I firmly believe the best on Earth.</p>
<p>But we will never be all that we should be until we do better in this.</p>
<p>There is no country on Earth where people are made more welcome.</p>
<p>There is no country on Earth whose people have more innate generosity to others.</p>
<p>Yet for two centuries – with fragrant exceptions, of course – Australians had collectively failed to show to Aboriginal people the personal generosity and warmth of welcome that we have habitually extended to the stranger in our midst.</p>
<p>Even as things began to change, a generation or two back, our tendency was to work “for” Aboriginal people rather than “with” them.</p>
<p>We objectified Aboriginal issues rather than personalised them.</p>
<p>We saw problems to be solved rather than people to be engaged with.</p>
<p>If that hardness of heart was ever really to melt, I thought, that change had to include me.</p>
<p>Because you can’t expect of others what you won’t demand of yourself.</p>
<p>So as a backbencher, I spent a few days every year in central Australia and always included a dinner with Charlie Perkins.</p>
<p>As a minister, I tried to spend a few days every year in remote Aboriginal communities – especially in Cape York and later in the APY lands for which my portfolios had particular responsibilities.</p>
<p>Yet after 14 years in the parliament, I found that I had visited dozens of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander places and not spent more than 12 hours in any one of them.</p>
<p>As shadow minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I asked Noel Pearson if he would help me to spend some serious time in individual communities where I could be useful – rather than just another seagull, as Aboriginal people so often called officious visitors.</p>
<p>So I spent three weeks in 2008 as a teacher’s aide in Coen; 10 days in 2009 as a truancy helper in Aurukun; four days in 2011 doing bush carpentry near Hopevale; and another four days in 2012 helping to renovate the Aurukun school library.</p>
<p>Later this year, as Prime Minister, I will spend a week in East Arnhem Land along with enough officials to make it, if only for a few days, the focus of our national government.</p>
<p>After 226 years of intermittent interest at most, why shouldn’t Aboriginal people finally have the Prime Minister’s undivided attention for seven days!</p>
<p>None of this makes me more worthy or less fallible than any of my predecessors – but it does demonstrate that this Government is serious about Aboriginal policy.</p>
<p>No less serious than it is about stopping the boats, fixing the budget, and building the roads of the 21st century.</p>
<p>I pay tribute to former prime minister John Howard for first proposing to recognise indigenous people in the constitution.</p>
<p>I pay tribute to former prime minister Kevin Rudd for the national apology.</p>
<p>I commend former prime minister Julia Gillard for continuing these annual Closing the Gap statements to focus the parliament’s attention on problems that might otherwise be neglected or glossed over.</p>
<p>I thank Kirstie Parker and Mick Gooda and members of the Closing the Gap steering committee.</p>
<p>I welcome the presence today of Warren Mundine and other members of the Prime Minister’s advisory council.</p>
<p>I welcome the presence of Andrew Forrest and others working on indigenous employment.</p>
<p>I especially welcome Fred Chaney, a former minister for Aboriginal affairs and mentor to me, whom I have often described as a distinguished elder – and who is now officially recognised as Senior Australian of the Year.</p>
<p>And I acknowledge the Australian of the Year, Adam Goodes, who has personally demonstrated, when bitter offence could have been taken, the “better angels of our natures”.</p>
<p>I welcome the first indigenous Member of the House of Representatives, Ken Wyatt, and the first indigenous woman member of this parliament, Senator Nova Peris – and I look forward to the day when the parliamentary representation gap is finally closed.</p>
<p>Most of all I welcome everyone the length and breadth of this great land who wants tomorrow to be better than today.</p>
<p>I can report that our country is on track to achieve some of the Closing the Gap targets.</p>
<p>The target to halve the gap in child mortality within a decade is on track to be met.</p>
<p>We are already close to meeting the target to have 95 per cent of remote children enrolled for pre-school – and should soon know what percentage are actually attending as well as just enrolled.</p>
<p>And the target to halve the gap in Year 12 attainment by 2020 is also on track to be met.</p>
<p>That’s the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news is that there’s almost no progress in closing the life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and other Australians – which is still about a decade.</p>
<p>There’s been very little improvement towards halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy.</p>
<p>And indigenous employment has, if anything, slipped backwards over the past few years.</p>
<p>We are not on track to achieve the more important and meaningful targets.</p>
<p>Because it’s hard to be literate and numerate without attending school; it’s hard to find work without a basic education; and it’s hard to live well without a job.</p>
<p>We are all passionate to Close the Gap.</p>
<p>We may be doomed to fail – I fear – until we achieve the most basic target of all: the expectation that every child will attend school every day.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the more remote the school, the more excuses are made for poor attendance.</p>
<p>Last year, in metropolitan areas, only 81 per cent of indigenous Year 9 students met the National Minimum Standards for reading.</p>
<p>In very remote areas, just 31 per cent of indigenous students reached the same minimum standard.</p>
<p>Yet it’s being demonstrated in places like Aurukun that a strong education in traditional culture is actually helped by a good education in English.</p>
<p>Right around our country, it should be possible to be proudly Aboriginal and a full participant in modern Australia.</p>
<p>That doesn’t just mean <em>access</em> to a good education in cities, towns and remote settlements – it means actually going to school.</p>
<p>So I propose to add a new target to our existing Closing the Gap targets: namely to end the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous school attendance within five years.</p>
<p>I hope I am here long enough to be judged on its achievement.</p>
<p>We will know that this gap has been all-but-closed when schools achieve 90 per cent plus attendance regardless of their percentage of Aboriginal students.</p>
<p>This was the strong consensus of my indigenous advisory council’s first meeting: that no one ever received a good education by not going to school.</p>
<p>Every day, in every school, the roll is taken.</p>
<p>Every school knows its attendance rates.</p>
<p>Every education department knows the attendance rate for every school.</p>
<p>The lower the attendance rate, the more likely it is that a school has problems.</p>
<p>The lower the attendance rate, the more likely it is that a school is failing its students.</p>
<p>It’s the duty of every teacher and every education department to try to ensure that every child attends school unless there’s a very good reason.</p>
<p>One of the worst forms of neglect is failing to give children the education they need for a decent life.</p>
<p>That’s why every state and territory has anti-truancy laws.</p>
<p>That’s why the former government, to its credit, tried to quarantine welfare payments for families whose children weren’t at school.</p>
<p>That’s why, at my first COAG meeting, every state and territory agreed with the Commonwealth on the need to publish attendance data from every school.</p>
<p>And that’s why, at 40 remote schools, the Commonwealth is already funding new anti-truancy measures that, on day one of the 2014 school year, in some communities, seem to have boosted attendance from under 60 per cent to over 90 per cent.</p>
<p>Our job is to break the tyranny of low expectations.</p>
<p>That’s why indigenous school attendance data will be part of the next Closing the Gap report and all subsequent reports under this Government.</p>
<p>The parliament will be brought up-to-date on the relative success or failure of Aboriginal education because a good education is fundamental to a good start in life.</p>
<p>Future Closing the Gap reports should also include data on work programme participation and data on communities without a police presence.</p>
<p>These reports, after all, should be less about what government is doing and more about how people are living.</p>
<p>We will know that Aboriginal people are living better when children go to school, adults go to work and the ordinary law of the land is respected and enforced.</p>
<p>The first Aboriginal member of this parliament, Senator Neville Bonner, once warned his colleagues that history would judge us all.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t have to wait for the judgment of history and, thanks to these Closing the Gap statements, we don’t have to.</p>
<p>A fair go for Aboriginal people is far too important to be put off to the judgment of history.</p>
<p>We have to provide it now – or as soon as we reasonably can.</p>
<p>I am confident of this: amidst all the mistakes, disappointment and uncertain starts, the one failure that has mostly been avoided is lack of goodwill.</p>
<p>Australians are now as proud of our indigenous heritage as we are of all our other traditions.</p>
<p>The challenge is to turn good intentions into better outcomes.</p>
<p>I am confident that, these days at least, for every one step backwards we are also taking two steps forward.</p>
<p>To give just one example: on every ministerial visit to the APY lands, I used to complain that there were just eight police for 3000 people spread over an area the size of Scotland – and that none of them lived in any of the places where they were needed.</p>
<p>Six years later, these are hardly model communities, but every substantial settlement has a permanent police presence – thanks to the good work of the South Australian Labor government – because this was an objective beyond politics.</p>
<p>As Fred Chaney has just said, reflecting on a lifetime of work with Aboriginal people: there is so much left to do but – in this area – these really are the very best of times.</p>
<p>There is probably no aspect of public policy on which there is more unity of purpose and readiness to give others the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>On this subject, at least, our parliament is at its best.</p>
<p>Our duty is to make the most of this precious moment.</p>
