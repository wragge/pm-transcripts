NAURU, 10 AUGUST, 193<br />
E&amp; OI, PROOF COPY<br />
Your Extcellency, the President of Nauru, other distiiauished Nauruant guests, and<br />
ladkio and sentlemen.<br />
I am vceiy please that President Dowayogo and I have been able to tign today theft<br />
three inter-related agr" eemnt whtich makce up the Compact of Settlement betwccnt<br />
Australia and Nauru.<br />
hoe are solemnn and binding comnitments, and I think it is lWr to say they define a<br />
now phaic of coopardou between Australia and Nauru.<br />
The terms of x-tticniciii were made public yesterday and I am heai tened that the<br />
Compact of Settlemnent Wa becen warmly ueleonad int both countries. That 13 what the<br />
President reliably tells Me, ajnd I am sure that is true in Australia as well.<br />
There is a wide recoontion in 1501,1 countries that AuStraia and Nauru arc lungstanding<br />
fdends arnd partners. Theiic is reief, I think. that an issue which has divided<br />
us has been resolved, well I think both amicably and reaRsonably, and honourably, to the<br />
satisfaction of both partes.<br />
Timw reaction of ourirners in the South Pacils; Fonrm was also positive, and a<br />
number of members of the Forum I re-came up to both Of wtq crtainly to mysclf,<br />
saying thial they were pleAscd to see that countric3 within the Forum could resolve<br />
diffcrcricci, dad that paritilArly some of the larger doinor countries who have<br />
boncfited from t rade and commerce with the area could also make such ant<br />
arrangement. I iihink This wax very comforting to them,<br />
They wclvomc the diemonstraion thAt Australia and Naur. u are able to work together<br />
to settle our differvacczi awd solve prohiems as neighbours and friendzi, making the<br />
obvious point that such pi " esses should al1so be able to take place btworn ourselvest<br />
and themselves. </p>
<p>This is called, of course in this part of the world, the Pacific way, and if this is the<br />
Pacific way obviously it works.<br />
On the Australian side negotiatiorns were C. onducted by my colleague, Gordon Bilney,<br />
the Minister for Developmnt, Cooperation and Pacific island Affairs, and I should like<br />
to note publicly my appreciation of the skill and care with which he has handled this<br />
sensitive task.<br />
The Foreigni Minister Wad to him, how come you can do this, Gordon, when I wasn't<br />
able to? And a lot of the rest of us knew the answer but I won't ( inaudible).<br />
At any rate this is a feather in Gordon's cap, and I am sure that the relationship he has<br />
developed with the people of Nawsu will be one of long-standing, one which there is, I<br />
am sure, repect on both sides which will now obtain for many yearm and in this<br />
important post, particularly in the Pacific Island Affairs this is, I think, a very solid<br />
tbundation for Gordon reprsemin$ the Government to have in its relations with<br />
Nauu Mr President, the agreements we have signed today not only record an amicable out of<br />
court settlemntd of the IC) case, they also set out a frame work for the future conduct<br />
of Australian-Nauru relations.<br />
r<br />
The joint declaration of principles coven3 a large number of field where Australia and<br />
Nauru are already oooperating, and where we lave scope to develop fRther our<br />
partnership. All these fields are significant, but there is one I should particularly underline, at<br />
paragraph 20 in the document it says this. " Both Governments recognise both the<br />
challenge presented by rehabilitating the worked out phosphate lands on Nauru and the<br />
fragility of Nauru's ecosystems, and will work together to facilitate the progressive<br />
rehabilitation of Nauru and the protection of NaWUs environment."<br />
This is an important commitment and one which the Australian side takes very<br />
seiously. and already the President and I had some substantial discussions a day ago<br />
about how and which ways that might be addressed and progressed.<br />
So we should like to see the proposed rehabilitation and development cooperation<br />
4reement contribute in a real way to the process of rehabilitation on Nauru, where the<br />
' people of the country feel they have a very tangible stake in this settlemnent, and where<br />
there are tangible and obvious benefits for them.<br />
I<br />
so, Mr President, I anm pleased to have the opportunity to visit Nauru and attend the<br />
South Pacific Forum. Could I take the opportunity of congratulating you and the<br />
Government for hosting the Forum and for the way in which it has been organised. It<br />
is a diffcult thing to host a Forum like this, for any country, particularly when you are<br />
not doing it often, and to do it so well, and of course chairing the proceedings as you<br />
have done today with great aplomb and dexterity and smoothness, I think attest to the<br />
decision which was taken a year or so ago for Namu to be the host. </p>
<p>I am especially happy that during this visit it has provided an historic opportunity to<br />
sign this historic Compact Of Settlement, as well as attend the Summit, Can I say I<br />
was also very pleased to lay a wreath on the Cenotaph yesterday in remembrance of<br />
the sacrifice which Australians and Nauruans had made together as long ago as the<br />
Second World War, again underpinning and underlining the strength and depth of the<br />
Australia-Nauru relationship.<br />
As I said, our relationship is unique and it is one to which we acre committed on a long.<br />
term basis and I hope that this historic settlement, the statement of principles, which<br />
for the first time Austrai has written down a set of principles which will govern the<br />
relationship that it has with another country, and the general warmth of the relationship<br />
between Australians and Nauruans on this occasion at this signing and at this point of<br />
the Forum of your host, your hosting of the Forum, this should be I think, let's may, a<br />
milestone, another mnilestone, in Australian-Nauru relations.<br />
So could I again congratulate the President on agreeing to this settlemet, and again<br />
congratulate Gordon Bilney on negotiating for the Australian side. But more<br />
particularly, on behalf of the Nauruan people for a stake in their fuzture development<br />
and rehabilitation, which I think this agreement does and in so doing underlining this<br />
partnership with Australi.<br />
Thank you. </p>
