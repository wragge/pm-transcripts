    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce $20 million in grants under Tough on Drugs</p>
<p> for community organisations to provide treatment, rehabilitation</p>
<p> and support for those affected by drugs.</p>
<p>The funding is part of $290 million committed to the Tough on Drugs</p>
<p> plan, and will go to more than 50 voluntary and community agencies</p>
<p> to run community based services.</p>
<p>I commend the work of the community organisations involved in providing</p>
<p> treatment and support services. They are playing their role in helping</p>
<p> to build a social coalition to address the grave social problem of</p>
<p> illicit drugs.</p>
<p>The key to the Tough on Drugs strategy lies in its partnership</p>
<p> between voluntary and community agencies, churches, schools, parents,</p>
<p> local communities, health professionals, law enforcement officials</p>
<p> and government.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to this partnership and to working harder</p>
<p> than ever to tackle the drug problem on all fronts.</p>
<p>True leadership which responds to community values demands that we</p>
<p> stand up to drugs like never before.</p>
<p>The successful projects include:</p>
<p>- Youth Off The Streets, Ultimo, New South Wales which receives</p>
<p> $750,000 for an intensive 2-4 week residential service for young</p>
<p> adults who have a history of drug abuse.</p>
<p>- The Salvation Army, Adelaide, which receives $375,000 to employ</p>
<p> two Aboriginal workers for a 25 bed sobering up unit for Aboriginal</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>- Anglicare in Lilydale, Victoria, which receives $474,000 to</p>
<p> support drug users and their families.</p>
<p>Many of the agencies receiving this funding will use it to set up</p>
<p> treatment and support services where gaps or special needs exist in</p>
<p> local communities.</p>
<p> The projects announced today build on the $30 million allocated</p>
<p> in August last year to 68 community agencies for treatment, and to</p>
<p> 24 local communities for initiatives such as training and resource</p>
<p> centres.</p>
<p>Tough on Drugs is the largest single initiative ever undertaken</p>
<p> in Australia to respond to the drug problem.</p>
<p>The Government has set aside $150 million so that our law enforcement</p>
<p> agencies have the resources needed to protect our borders and our</p>
<p> streets from the drug menace.</p>
<p>A major education and community information programme is being implemented</p>
<p> with around $40 million committed to school and community education</p>
<p> efforts based on zero tolerance of drugs in schools.</p>
<p>We are sending the strongest possible message to our children to resist</p>
<p> drugs.</p>
<p>At the same time we are extending help to those who need it. Backed</p>
<p> by a $60 million commitment to treatment and rehabilitation, the Government</p>
<p> wants to see all those who have a drug problem, or who are placed</p>
<p> at risk, able to get access to treatment and support.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government is also supporting research, particularly</p>
<p> the important work aimed at finding new ways to treat addiction, while</p>
<p> maintaining its determined stand against risky heroin trials. There</p>
<p> are now 18 medical trials taking place with the aim of finding alternatives</p>
<p> to heroin. These trials are testing LAAM, buprenorphine, naltrexone</p>
<p> and slow -release oral morphine with the aim of helping people break</p>
<p> their addiction.</p>
<p>Although we have made much progress over the past 18 months in tackling</p>
<p> Australia's drug problem, there remains no quick or easy solutions</p>
<p> to illicit drug abuse.</p>
<p>Importantly, the treatment and rehabilitation projects announced today</p>
<p> will extend the reach of treatment services currently available. Those</p>
<p> affected by drug abuse will have more assistance and support available</p>
<p> to help them recover from their addiction and resume a normal healthy</p>
<p> life.</p>
<p>I wish to thank the Australian National Council on Drugs for their</p>
<p> guidance and advice on the implementation of the Tough on Drugs</p>
<p> strategy.</p>
