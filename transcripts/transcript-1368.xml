    <content><![CDATA[<p>
S) pech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt,<br />
at the Higains Electorate Dinner July, 1966.<br />
Alan and my friends from Higgins:<br />
This is a very memorable night for Zara and myself.<br />
indeed it is made the more mnemorabl e for us because Alan, with<br />
that genius for organisation which you possess, you've selected<br />
for this celebration the room hallowed by the fact that we held<br />
our wedding celebration here nearly twenty years ago. And, as<br />
I have very happ recollections of that occasion, obviously<br />
ha ' ppily consoliffted as you look at the beaming spectacle of my<br />
dear wife here, then this will be another memory to add to that<br />
rich store of the past.<br />
But wherever we held this gathering it would have been a<br />
notable occasion for the stalwarts who have been, as I look around<br />
this room, what I might call my thick-and-thinners; those who<br />
have stuck with me through good times and through bad. You've<br />
mentioned the troubles of the early 1960' s. Well, be it everlastingly<br />
to the credit of Higgins that they wjere with their<br />
Member all the way. ( Laughter and applause). And I'm e~ ad<br />
you feel we succeeded in laying I beleve we did the base of<br />
a sound economy, one of the soundest economies to be found<br />
anywhere in the world today.<br />
Now I thought, Alan, that up to this point you'd proved<br />
yourself a very good and staunch friend. But when you labelled<br />
me to deliver an address I wasn't so sure about that. I thought<br />
that this was one of these pleasant, relaxed, convivial evenings<br />
in which we manifested our friendship with one another by<br />
consuming a quite inordinate amount of delightful food and even<br />
more titillating beverage. But you've throwin on me at this late<br />
hour of the night this responsibility, and where do I begin?<br />
I begin, I suppose, at the 26th of January this year,<br />
because, by a happy combination of circumstances, it was on<br />
Australids Nati onal Day that I assumed the responsibility of<br />
office. So I can't forget my anniversary, next Tuesday I think<br />
I complete my first six months of office. It seems more like<br />
six years frankly, when you look back on what has been compressed<br />
into that period of six months. Surely, putting the personalities<br />
on one side, it must be accounted one of the most remarkable<br />
periods in the history of the Australian nation.<br />
I asked my very able Press Secretary, Tony Eggleton, to<br />
select the highlights for me of the things we'd done in thcse six<br />
months. I thougt I might have been able to give you the<br />
highlights on an occasion such as this. I took one look at the<br />
list and I felt completely exhausted. I couldn't credit that<br />
we'd done so much in so short a space of time. But there have<br />
been some quite remarkable developments in that period. Now,<br />
this perhaps is one of the most conspicuous features of the<br />
changeover which has occurred. We have not merely had a<br />
transition from a very distinguished leadership which carried<br />
Australia through the most notable period of propess in its<br />
history, but from that leadership we have moved into what can be<br />
seen as a new era of Australian historic progress. It's not a<br />
change of personalities that brings this about, it is the result<br />
of historical forces, the circums~ tances of events around the<br />
world which has been producing these changes here in Australia. </p>
<p>Whether Sir Robert Menzies had been here or not would not<br />
have altered the fact that the British Minister for Defence was<br />
with us in the first months of the year to discuss with Australia<br />
the pattern of British defence in this area of the world in the<br />
1970' s and indeed, into the 1990That itself was a quite<br />
historic development because for understandable reasons with<br />
which we can all sympathise, the United Kingdom had found it<br />
necessary to reduce its commitments around the world and one of<br />
the places in which it had to review its cormitments was in<br />
various military bases established in this theatre of the world<br />
in South East Asia and East of Suez generally. And we discussed<br />
this very earnestly because it clearly had an important bearing<br />
on our own planning. It was made clear to us at that time that<br />
if it was found untenable to hold British forces in Singapore,<br />
for example, then unless they had some other base to go to in<br />
this area of the world and that meant Australia then they<br />
would have to go home.<br />
de urged that Great Britain should maintain a presence in<br />
that part of the world for as long as it found it possible to do<br />
so for the very good reason that British character and British<br />
influence do exert a moderating, stabilising influence in this<br />
area of the world. You have comparatively weak countries, as<br />
to their military strength and, indeed, in the case of some of<br />
them, their economic strength, and the British influence and<br />
presence not a colonial imposition or anything of that sort<br />
has this moderating, stabilising influeuce. This was what we<br />
were wanting to preserve. And they saw the force of that<br />
argument. They felt that we were a little more optimistic<br />
than they were about their capacity to hold on in these places<br />
with regard to a certain amount of restlessness that occurs there.<br />
But we believe from our contacts in the area that the people<br />
there would welcome a continued British participation, and<br />
I believe that still to be so.<br />
I merely mention this as an illustration of the sort of<br />
change in circumstance with which we have had to cope, and we<br />
have had quite dramatic confirnation in the last few hours<br />
literally that Great Britain has felt the pressure of these<br />
burdens and responsibilities and has been forced into drastic<br />
economic action in order to meet them. Now, we for our part,<br />
have given our support to Great Britain and the sterling area<br />
generally in that most of Australia's overseas earnings are<br />
held in the reserves of the United Kingdom, in sterling reserves.<br />
And this is a considerable support to the strength of sterling<br />
and their own economic viability in their external accounts.<br />
*; e've been able to discuss quite realistically together the need<br />
for Australia to go on earning overseas as much as we can;<br />
we've been helped to do this in the years since the war by a<br />
great influx of British capital and a considerable body of<br />
British migrants.<br />
Now we know that the migrants will continue to come,<br />
perhaps they will even increase as a result of the difficulties<br />
in the United Kingdom. But as to the influx of capital, we<br />
would hope that the British Government and people would see<br />
that in the growth of Australia, in the build-up of its own<br />
export income, is a further strengthening of the British<br />
position in the world. We can do more in this area of the<br />
world, we can do more in the way of international aid, we can<br />
provide a larger defence establishment for the security of the<br />
area as our own economy grows, as our national development<br />
progresses. And these are matters of the character that I've<br />
been discussing recently with Mr. Wilson in London. </p>
<p>You've made some very charming references to Zara, Alan.<br />
She, of course, is my secretweapon and I think it's not so<br />
secret now, it's emerged publicly. Indeed, for some years<br />
when I was Deputy Leader to Sir Robert Menzies I used to say in<br />
all frankness that I was deputy leader also in my own household.<br />
And this fact is gradually seeping around the world to the<br />
knowledge of other people. However, it doesn't seem to do me<br />
any harm. It builds a certain amount of respect and indeed,<br />
warmth with others to know that I must have qualities, perhaps<br />
undiscernible to them, which have attracted this very notable<br />
lady. And my credit enhances accordingly. ( Applause).<br />
She only caused me one serious passage of embarrassment<br />
while we were away, and that, of course was over the regrettable<br />
incident of the white mice. ( Laughter). I don't know how<br />
many of you read about the white mice, but in London, when the<br />
press were asking her what she'd been doing, of course they<br />
pressed her as to whether she'd been doing some shopping. And<br />
my wife, being a very wise woman, knows that there is nothing<br />
in election year more damaging to a politician's standing than<br />
to have his wife doing a lot of expensive shopping abroad. You<br />
remember there was that lady in Africa who bought the gold bed<br />
and got into it ( Laughter). Anyhow, my wife settled for a<br />
couple of white mice and I was able later to point out to the<br />
press how important it is to avoid international misunderstandings;<br />
that there should be full and adeuate reporting of these matters<br />
because the press here merely carried a reference to the white<br />
mice and this set in train some involved deparmental cabling.<br />
i~-hoever acdministers the quarantine arrangements sent a rather<br />
frenzied cable to London to the effect that the importation of<br />
white mice was prohibited. It would be very embarrassing if<br />
the wife of the Prime Minister brought them in, and they had to<br />
be publicly destroyed, or something to that effect. You see the<br />
really critical reference that had been omitted from the report<br />
was that these were china white mice for our grandchildren:.<br />
We seem to have featured with the rice because while I was<br />
spending the night at Chequers it was a wonderful experience<br />
for us to be invited to spend the Sunday night in this historic<br />
residence of the British Prime Ministers we were shown around<br />
by Mr. and li'rs. :' ilson. He pointed out to us the picture of<br />
Rembrandt of the Aesop Fable of the Lion and the MIouse, and it<br />
was a magnificent pice of painting. But he went on to tell us<br />
tht-ren ' inston Churchill was the occupant of Chequers, he used<br />
to study this picture and finally he could stand it no longer<br />
and he said " I cannot see the mouse". So he painted in the<br />
mouse and the Rembrandt at Chequers is now Rembrandt plus<br />
Churchill. ( Laughter).<br />
This was the story I employed at the '; hite House in<br />
Washington because the moral of the Aesop Fable, of course, is<br />
that little friends can prove great friends and, in this sense,<br />
Australia I believe can prove a great friend both to the United<br />
States and to the United Kingdom. It's through the collaboration<br />
of these two great democracies that a great deal of the strength<br />
of the world, its prospect for peace, hopes for progress, still<br />
rest even in these times. Despite the relative weaknesses<br />
today of the British economic position, British character,<br />
British influence, British leadership, still account heavily<br />
around the world, free or communist world, and we don't underestimate<br />
that. Nor, I assure you, is it under-estimated by<br />
the President of the United States. And I was glad to have the<br />
opportunity of my second visit with him. Harold Wilson knew,<br />
of course, that I was going to see him again; we'd discussed </p>
<p>4.<br />
this together in some detail in three hours--of talks at Cheauers.<br />
Ihope that That I was able to say both in Londan and-in Amdrica<br />
proved, helpful to that association.<br />
There are ways, and particularly out in this area of' the<br />
world, in -which Australia can be of help, quite important help.<br />
Let me just give you an illustration of how the mouse as a great<br />
friend at times can work out. You've all heard of the Colombo<br />
Plan, but it's not so widely known that the Colombo Plan which has<br />
brought aid and technical assistance to the countries of Asia and<br />
South East Asia in particular, was pioneered by Australia and by a<br />
particular Australian prominently associated with the work in its<br />
early days. And its one of the ironies of life's circumnstances<br />
that the man who is being abused in some quarters around the world<br />
at thig time, because in the exercise of an honest jUd~ pent he<br />
gave his decision in a particular way, our own Sir Percy Spender<br />
was the man who gave the drive, the impetus and the inspiration<br />
to what later became the Colombo Plan.<br />
Now Australia has provided under that plan what is for our<br />
size of population a respectable total of 130 million Australian<br />
dollars. The United States has provided 15 thousand million dollars<br />
under the Colombo Plan, And here is an illustration of the way<br />
in which an initiative we were able to take and get something<br />
moving, had the effect of being of benefit on this scale to the<br />
p eople of this area. I mention that because, for me, one of the<br />
highlights perhaps the highlight of my recent journey overseas<br />
was to find that, having put vigorously in the United States the<br />
view that the press cover being given there didn't reveal to the<br />
American public how much was being achieved by the people of South<br />
East Asia, under the protection of the American shield they have<br />
been able to go forward with their own progress and able to cooperate<br />
more closely together for Veaceful purposes, for trade<br />
purposes and for mutual strengthening of each other's security<br />
position, Now this wasn't being told, I felt, fairly and<br />
adequately in the American press, and I kept on saying so until<br />
we did get some notice taken of it. And what is more, we got<br />
from the President himself a quite historic declaration of American<br />
attitude. This has now been recognised in American as a significant<br />
development in their foreign policy, the attitude of the President<br />
to American responsibilities and possibilities in this area of the<br />
world. They were encouraged by the evidence which has been<br />
accumulating of co-operation be tveen those countries vihich have<br />
been protected by an American presence in South Viet Nam from<br />
corrmunist aggression. Those of us who have enjoyed this<br />
Protection have nowr been co-operating more closely together.<br />
There were ten countries which met recently at Seoul in South<br />
Korea, not one of the major powers amongst them, except in the<br />
sense that Japan can be classified as a mjaor power -it certainly<br />
is in an industrial sense but not a military sense -but it was<br />
one of the significant developments of recent times I would. think,<br />
looking back over the six mnths, the point at which I viould say<br />
perhaps the most significant development had occurred for me,<br />
external to the events inside this country, w-as the moment when<br />
I was invited by the Prime 1vinister of Thailand to go and sit<br />
the first foreigner in history in the Cabinet of the Government<br />
of Thailand. This was to me a symptom of the newr spirit that is<br />
emerging around these countries of Asia, a setting aside of the<br />
past Prejudices, past failures in co-operation. And this is one<br />
of the real dividends that has been secured for us by American<br />
resolution and determination in South Viet N~ am, assisted by what<br />
the United Kingdom has been doing with other Commnonwealth forces in<br />
Malaysia and in resisting Indonesian confrontation policies in Borneo.<br />
Now these are just illustrations which I give you of the<br />
sort of thing that has been crop'Ang up through the year. Its<br />
been a year crow-, ded with incidents and developments of this sort<br />
and these are to touch on some of the external matters. </p>
<p>Internally we've had the changeover quite an historic<br />
changeover to a decinal currency system. And lest anybody<br />
think us freakish in this matter, New Zealand will be moving into<br />
decinls next year, the United Kingdom will be followving in due<br />
course, and most, therefore, of the countries and peoples around<br />
the world will be operating under a decimal system of currency.<br />
Inside Australia, the sort of change we have to contend<br />
with these days is that the electorate no longer respects the<br />
division of power betveen the Comonwealth and the States. I am<br />
sure it would suit John Bloomfield, it would certainly suit us<br />
and our respective colleagues in our governments, if he<br />
electorate would allo, us to go ahead as the constitution<br />
intended us to go. He is, of course, an authority these days<br />
in the field of education. But this doesn't prevent the<br />
electorate from demanding that the Comnonwealth also come into<br />
the field of education and the provision which ve, through our<br />
Budget, and the State Governments, through their Budgets, need<br />
to make in order to meet what has been described as an education<br />
explos ion, is almost capaole of wrecking the stable assembly<br />
of a Budget for all the other purposes of government at this time.<br />
These things are occurring while we're coping in the Federal<br />
sphere with a record provision for defence, and increasing<br />
provision for internctional aid, which the electorate also is<br />
pressing for these days. And, taking them together, the<br />
Comonwealth and State Governments are almost at their wits end<br />
literally to find how, without zo imposing burdens upon the<br />
conaunity that incentive becomes damaged, they can make ends meet<br />
and sustain a stable economic situation in respect of their own<br />
administrations. Ue've just been grappling w., ith thais problem<br />
in Canberra. I came back from overseas over the weekend to run<br />
into a gathering of the representatives of industry on Monday, and<br />
on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday had the full 1vUnistry meeting<br />
on the problems of our own Budget in Canberra.<br />
And so, Alan, you will see that the fruits of office,<br />
while they look alright on the plate, sometimes prove both costly<br />
and difficult of attainment. I've been greatly stimulated by<br />
this six months of office, but I never thought I'd have to work<br />
so hard in my life. I felt that the Tru.' surer of the Conmorriealth<br />
was the hardest working man; I've been miaintaining that theory<br />
not for 8 years, heaven forbid, but for 7 years as the former<br />
encumbont of that high office. I know that Sir Robert Menzies<br />
used to work very hard. I'm quite convinced that he wasn't<br />
wrked as hard in his life as I have been in these last 6 months.<br />
However, he might argue that. But I think I can claim that<br />
because it is a changing world; it is a turbulent, restless<br />
world. How many of us of my generation when we were boys used to<br />
know much about what went on north of this country. Most of us<br />
if we got as far as getting a collection of the postage stamps<br />
of the countries concerned would have become about as well-informed<br />
as the average Australian statesman of those days on what went on<br />
in our north. Our eyes were turned to the British Isles and<br />
Europe. We hardly had an awareness of their existence there<br />
was a funny little country called Indo China we didn't know much<br />
about. The relations between Singapore and Ilaya were also<br />
mysteries to us. But over recent years these have become facts<br />
life for us. </p>
<p>S6.<br />
Now I don't want to imply and some of the things I've<br />
been saying lately might lead to that impression-that ve don't<br />
have a future in relation to the rest of the world, that our<br />
future is all in Asia. That would be quite silly because, apart<br />
from questions of international policy, two thirds of our trade<br />
is still outside the Asian area. The significant thing is that,<br />
even while we've been in office, and I go back now to the beginning<br />
of Sir Robert's long period of leadership, the percentage of<br />
Australian trade in this area of the world has moved up from<br />
to 33%, and the trend is steadily in that direction. We're<br />
dealing now with a billion and a half people and this is more than<br />
half the human race, and as the years go on their proportion of<br />
the total population of the human race will tend to increase more<br />
than that of the rest of the world because not are they no less<br />
fertile than the rest of the world, but improving public health<br />
measures are keeping more of them alive beyond the point of low<br />
life expectancy which was their lot in earlier years.<br />
Now these are some of the factors which lie ahead for the<br />
policy-maker of this country; they help to contribute to the<br />
judgment which Lord Slim recently expressed to me when he wrote<br />
saying what a fascinating time to be Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
Well, it is a fascinating time, because, not only are there<br />
challenges and opportunities outside Australia but inside we are<br />
embarked on one of the most exciting phases of national development<br />
which measure up in excitement and promise to the rich days of<br />
the gold finds in Australia of earlier years. Here in a year in<br />
which we've had to contend with the most serious drought in the<br />
last 20 years, the economy has moved on steadily for most people<br />
almost without fluctuation. We've got a much broader base to<br />
the whole economy; we have been able to continue in strength<br />
through all these difficulties.<br />
Now, we meet here tonight as supporters of a Liberal<br />
candidate in a Liberal electorate, and, indeed, I have the honour<br />
to be the Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party.<br />
And I think we can claim that Australia's strength inside Australia<br />
and around the world is in no small degree attributable to the<br />
basic principles that we stand by in our Liberal faith and the<br />
brilliant exposition of those principles by the man who was Prime<br />
Minister of this country for 16 consecutive years. It is my<br />
honour to succeed him and I can tell you and I think this<br />
ought to be mentioned seeing that I'm laying emphasis on the<br />
Liberal element inside the policy formation that through those<br />
years we have operated with a coalition; its boen a friendly<br />
coalition and has worked effectively and happily; and what I'm<br />
sure will interest all in this room tonight to know is that the<br />
relations which existed with Sir Robert's leadership of cordial<br />
collaboration have continued with no lessening of wan-th or<br />
effectiveness of co-operation in the coalition which I have the<br />
honour to lead. ( Applause). And this means strength for<br />
Australia. We can present to the world the picture of a strong<br />
government; our opponents are in disarray; its hard to find these<br />
days a serious political discussion as between the Government<br />
Parties and those of the Opposition. You pick up odd items about<br />
Sthe rightwing asking the D. L. P. to give them some sort of<br />
protection or the left wing saying if there is a big enough loss<br />
of seats at the next election then the left wing will be able to<br />
take control. Well, if this is the way they want to argue it,<br />
or discuss it, let them do so. We carry the responsibility of<br />
national leadership and in these days, with the sombre tasks still<br />
ahead of us in South Viet Nam and elsewhere, those are weighty<br />
enough responsibilities indeed. We have no lack of advisers<br />
from a variety of sections of the community. But, finally, here<br />
L </p>
<p>7.<br />
as in the united States and in the United Kingdom, a responsibility<br />
for leadership has to be taken by the democratically elected<br />
government of the day. And in that weighty task and responsibility<br />
its a great encouragement to me personally to know that my ov'M base<br />
is so strong and that heiearound me I find those who are helping<br />
to keep the fortess of Hig. ins staunch, firm and strong.<br />
Well, ladies and gentlemen, Alan spoke of an address.<br />
It's been a lengthier one perhaps than even he might have bargained<br />
for. But these are just a selection of the matters which have<br />
been actively engaging the attention of the busiest Government in<br />
the history of the Comronwrealth of Australia. I hope that in the<br />
period which lies ahead and the rest of this year, we'll prove it<br />
one of the most effective years in the history of the nation and<br />
that, given the support which we at least feel to be our just due,<br />
we'll go on from strength to strength in the year's ahead. And<br />
may you be with me all that Thank you. </p>
