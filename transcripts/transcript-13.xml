<p>PEACE.<br />
-JAPAN-MINISTER'S STATEMENT, FEBRUARY, 1948.<br />
-On 3rd February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br />
Evatt) said:<br />
" Australia is concerned over the consequences following the breakdown<br />
in the Council of Foreign Ministers at London in December,<br />
1947, and the inability of the major Powers to reach an agreement<br />
on the European settlement. These consequences are far-reaching,<br />
and have serious repercussions on the whole United Nations Organization,<br />
which was established on the assumption that there would be<br />
early peace settlements and that the unanimity of the malor Powers<br />
would be continued after the wvar. Another adverse result is that the<br />
Japanese peace settlement is held up. Once again it is being<br />
demonstrated by somewhat bitter experience that in international<br />
affairs peace and justice are indivisible.<br />
" The Australian Government believes in greater participation by<br />
all those countries which actually participated in war and made a<br />
substantial contribution to victory. It will be one of the main objects<br />
of the discussions to, see how such participation can be most appropriately<br />
effected in the interests of -world peace. Firsthand information<br />
on the general situation from the Australian missions abroad, together<br />
with the personal experience of the officers mentioned, should<br />
be of great assistance in defining the scope and methods of Australia's<br />
participation." ( ror earlier references, please see No. 108, page 40; No. 124, page 26;<br />
No. 127, page 35; No. 129, page 9.)<br />
On 4th February, 1948, Dr. Evatt said:<br />
The Australian Government has kept the United States Government<br />
continuously informed of its views on the Japanese settlement and<br />
the procedure which should be followed in formulating the peace treaty.<br />
After the British Commonwealth Conference at Canberra in August,<br />
1947, I visited the United States and discussed Japan with President<br />
Truman, the Secretary of State ( Mr. Marshall) and other American<br />
leaders and officials. Further talks on Japan have taken place at<br />
Washington since my return.<br />
" Throug-hout, the Australian Government has emphasized the need<br />
for a just and lasting peace based on the principles of the United<br />
Nations Charter and -contributing to the security and welfare of all<br />
the peoples of Eastern Asia and the Pacific. Australia has stressed<br />
the urgency of reaching a definite settlement-an urgency to which<br />
General MacArthuir and the Canberra Conference have also drawn<br />
attenltion. Australia, because of her war effort and her position in the<br />
Pacific, is entitled to be a party principal in these negotiations, and<br />
our constant consultations with the United States Government are an<br />
indication that our position has been recognized in the talks that have<br />
so far taken place. </p>
<p>" The delay in formulating a treaty for Japan is most unsatisfactory.<br />
The uncertainty as to the future of Japan is impeding the<br />
attainment of stability in the Far East, and preventing the formation<br />
of long-term plans by the countries of that area, including Australia.<br />
The chief disagreement concerns the membership and system of voting<br />
for the -peace conference. But the broad lines of the settlement itself<br />
have been indicated by the agreements made at Cairo, Yalta and<br />
Potsdam, and by the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.<br />
Therefore, the Australian Government does not accept the present<br />
impasse as being in dny way final, and is taking every practicable<br />
diplomatic step to overcome the deadlock and bring -about a conference<br />
that will secure the agreement of all Powers which contributed<br />
directly to the defeat of Japan."<br />
JAPAN-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT, FEBRUARY,<br />
1948.<br />
Ine Parliament.-On 19th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br />
Chifley) said:<br />
" I regret that is not possible to announce a date for the assembling<br />
of the conference to draw up the Japanese peace treaty. A deadlock<br />
has been reached in regard to this matter. I believe that the Soviet<br />
Government takes the view that the treaty should be dealt with in the<br />
first place by the foreign ministers of the four major Powers. Of<br />
course, that is not acceptable to Australia, and I believe that it is not<br />
acceptable to a number of other nations. It is generally considered<br />
that all nations which participated in the war against Japan in the<br />
Pacific area should take part in the peace conference. Every endeavour<br />
has been made to over-come the present deadlock, but I -cannot say<br />
xhether the suggestions made are acceptable or not."<br />
AUSTRALIAN POLICY-MINISTER'S STATEMENT,<br />
MARCH, 1948.<br />
On 21st March, 1948, Dr. Evatt said:<br />
" The present situation can be described only as a ' drift' towards<br />
war. In other words, no one wants war, no one can afford to suffer the<br />
further losses of war and reduce living conditions even further-yet<br />
nations can ' drift' to war. It is almost as though nations were<br />
inanimate objects being carried inevitably down a stream, instead of<br />
being human beings, with feelings, hopes and ideal;, with full control<br />
through their responsible leaders of their destiny. The present condition<br />
of drift is, therefore, a challenge to all responsible leaders. War<br />
can come only as a result of absence of leadership in world affairs.<br />
The United Nations is the main hope for peace and improved<br />
living conditions throughout the world. The best positive help citizens<br />
of goodwill can give in world affairs to-day is to throw their weight<br />
behind the United Nations. The United Nations has its faults of<br />
1860-2 </p>
<p>procedure; but attacks made upon it now are reminescent of attacks<br />
made on the League of Nations by those who found it expedient to<br />
side-step the League and act independently of it, -and who contributed<br />
to its weakening and to World War II.<br />
The peoples of the world are entitled to a peace-a peace based<br />
on justice. It is sheer defeatism to accept the pessimistic and sometimes<br />
evil prognostications of those who light-heartedly anticipate a<br />
third world war and the consequent destruction of civilization. Loyal<br />
and consistent support for the United Nations offers a way out, providing<br />
its machinery is employed to achieve settlements based on justice<br />
and not on power. Australia has always taken, and will continue to<br />
take, a lead in advocating this view. The United Nations, and it alone,<br />
can arrest the drift towards war. This drift is now being welcomed<br />
by the deadly enemies of the Allies of the war not yet concluded by<br />
peace treaties-the open and secret followers of Ritlerism and<br />
Fascism. Nothing that can be done should be left undone so far as Australia<br />
is concerned to prevent the utter catastrophe of another war. The<br />
people of Australia who still suffer from the terrible losses of human<br />
life of World W-ar II., who still remember the cruel anxieties and fears<br />
which accompanied the war, and who are now successfully restoring<br />
in an economy of full employment the human and material losses of<br />
the war, will welcome the constitution of a National Committee for<br />
the United Nations in Australia, for it is only through the United<br />
Nations that peace can be achieved.<br />
There is no problem or dispute in the world which -cannot be<br />
settled in terms of peace and justice. But the way to settlement is<br />
through the United Nations, and not along the lines of power politics,<br />
w. hich have no regard to the facts and justice of each dispute. We<br />
rmust, at all costs, arrest the drift towards war, which is wanted by no<br />
responsible human being in the world. In this high endeavour, Australia<br />
and Australians can take as prominent a part as they did in the<br />
long and still unfinished fight against Hitlerism and Fascism."<br />

<p>PERMANENT FORGES-RETIREMENT SCHEME.<br />
On 16th March, 1948, the Minister for Defence ( Mr. Dedman)<br />
said-" Cabinet decided to-day that legislation be prepared for submission<br />
to the Federal Parliamentary Labour party to provide a<br />
uniform scheme of retirement benefits for members of the permanent<br />
naval, military and air forces.<br />
" At present, the retirement provisions for the permanent forces<br />
differ in the respective service, the provision for naval personnel and<br />
air force officers being a system of deferred pay, while airmen below<br />
commissioned rank and members of the permanent military forces contribute<br />
to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. The deferred pay<br />
system has unsatisfactory features, particularly in that it makes inadequate<br />
provision for a member's dependants in the event of death or<br />
invalidity. The recent reduction of the retiring ages of army officers<br />
renders the public service superannuation scheme inappropriate for<br />
application in their case.<br />
In the formulation of the proposed uniform retirement scheme<br />
regard has been paid to the retirement benefits provided for the forces<br />
of Britain and other Dominions.<br />
The scheme will be contributory, providing a rate of pension<br />
appropriate to each rank. Pensions will be payable on retirement or<br />
discharge, subject to the member's having completed not less than<br />
twenty years' service after age twenty and, in the case of officers, to the<br />
member's having reached the retiring age of his particular rank. To<br />
cater for officers who enter the services some years later than the normal<br />
ages of entry, pensions at reduced rates will be provided for officers who<br />
reach the retiring age for their rank after completing at least fifteen<br />
years but less than twenty years' service. Officers with ten years, but<br />
less than fifteen years' service, from age twenty on retirement or discharge<br />
will receive a refund of their contributions to the fund, plus a<br />
gratuity equal to 150 per cent, of their contributions. The scale of<br />
contributions will be same as under the Commonwealth Public Service<br />
Superannuation Scheme, and the maximum pension will also be the<br />
same. " The proposed scale of retirement pensions for officers ranges from<br />
Å. 275 a year for an army captain and equivalent navy and air force<br />
ranks retiring at or about age 45 to Å E845 a year for a lieutenantgeneral<br />
and equivalent ranks retiring at age 60. The basic pensions<br />
proposed for members below commissioned rank who are discharged<br />
after age 40 after serving not less than twenty years range from<br />
a year for a private -and equivalent navy and air force ranks, to Å 155<br />
a year for a Warrant Officer, Class and equivalent ranks. Additional<br />
amounts of pension ( from Å 6 a year for private to Å 8 a year for<br />
warrant officer will be provided for each year of service beyond<br />
twenty years' service for pension after age twenty, under definite<br />
engagement. Pensions for naval warrant officers and officers commissioned<br />
from warrant rank, and for army quartermasters, will range </p>
<p>from Å 300 a year for warrant officer ( navy) and lieutenant and quartermaster<br />
( army), to Å 450 a year for lieutenant-commander ex-warrant<br />
officer ( navy) and major and quartermaster ( army). The pension for<br />
a naval commander ex-warrant officer wvill be Å 550 a year. Due to the<br />
early retiring ages of members of the services as compared with civil<br />
servants, payment of the pensions proposed will involve a substantially'<br />
greater Commonwealth subsidy than is required in the case of the public<br />
service superannuation scheme.<br />
" The scheme provides that a member below commissioned -rank<br />
who is not re-enlisted ou completion of his current engagement and who<br />
has not qualified for pension will receive a refund of -his contribution<br />
to the fund, plus a gratuity equal to 150 per cent. of the refund. The<br />
gratuity will not be less than a sum calculated at the rate of Å 30 for<br />
each completed year of service, subject to a proviso that the gratuity<br />
payable to a member who retires before completion of twelve years'<br />
service shall not exceed Å 120.<br />
The scheme provides that where a member dies in the service, his<br />
widow will receive one-half of the full pension which would be payable<br />
at age 60 in respect of the contributions being paid by the member<br />
prior to his death. On the death of a pensioned member, his widow<br />
will receive a pension at one-half the rate which was paid to the<br />
pensioner while alive. In cases of total permanent incapacity, it is<br />
proposed that the member will receive a pension on the same basis as<br />
would be payable in such circumstances to a contributor to the Commonwealth<br />
Superannuation Fund. Where the degree of incapacity is<br />
less than 60 per cent, benefits will be adjusted accordingly.<br />
" It is proposed that all future appointees or enlistees to the<br />
permanent forces ( except other ranks, initially engaged for less than<br />
six years) will be compulsory contributors to the Defence Forces Retirement<br />
Fund. Members already contributing to the Commonwealth<br />
Superannuation Fund will transfer their existing rights to the Defence<br />
Forces Retirement Fund. Deferred pay standing to the credit of members<br />
of the naval forces and air force oficers will be utilized to purchase<br />
full units of pension, and such members will contribute for the balance<br />
of unit elements appropriate to the pay received. In the case of<br />
present serving members of naval and air forces who may consider that<br />
the existing deferred pay scheme is more advantageous may, at their<br />
option, stay out of the scheme and accept one of the following<br />
alternatives: To retain deferred pay at p~ resent at credit: this amiount to he paid with<br />
interest at 31 per cent, on death or retirement. Member to contribute for<br />
additional unit elements not covered by deferred pay and to receive ro rata<br />
benefits only.<br />
To continue uinder existing deferred pay scheme and make no contributions<br />
to the Defence Forces Retirement Fuind.<br />
" The advantages of the new scheme are so substantial that it is<br />
anticipated that most members will elect to participate in it.<br />
" Eligibility for full pension rights under the proposed scheme will<br />
be subject to the member agreeing, if required by the service, to serve<br />
on the reserve list maintained by the service of which he was a member.<br />
1860-3 </p>
<p>" The scheme now approved has been framed having regard to the<br />
necessity of providing attractive conditions of service in all ranks, and<br />
should ensure that those who makc service in the armed forces their<br />
career are adequately provided for when their term of service has heen<br />
completed." CITIZEN MILITARY FORCE S-CONDITIONS.<br />
On 5th March, 1948, Mr. Chambers announced conditions of service<br />
for officers and other ranks of the Citizen Military Forces. Officers<br />
would he selected firstly from those who were on the reserve of officers<br />
and who served during World War II., secondly from persons who<br />
served as other ranks during World War II., and in the case of<br />
technical arms and services, from persons who possessed the necessary<br />
civilian professional, technical or academic qualifications. An officer<br />
appointed from the reserve of officers would he permitted to accept an<br />
appointment in the Citizen Military Forces in a rank lower than that<br />
held by him on the reserve. Other ranks would he enlisted hetween<br />
the ages of 18 and 35 for the Citizen Military Forces field force, and<br />
between the ages of 18 and 45 for Citizen Military Forces fixed establishiments<br />
on the mainland; the ages of discharge being 40 and 48<br />
respectively. INDUSTRIAL.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br />
On 4th February, 1948, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)<br />
said that at 31st December, 1947, unfilled vacancies held by the Commionwealth<br />
Employment Service numbered 43,000 for males and 30,000<br />
for females, compared with 90,900 at 30th November, 1947. Recipients<br />
of unemployment benefits were 2,797 males and 68 females. During<br />
December, the Commonwealth Employment Service had referred<br />
14,500 males and 4,800 females to employers, and had given advice<br />
and information on various matters to 23,600 males and 5,400 females.<br />
On 7th February, 1948, Mr. Holloway said that at 31st January,<br />
1948, 3,823 males and 118 females were in receipt of unemployment<br />
benefit or re-employment allowance. The total was nearly 1,100 higher<br />
than that recorded at December, 1947, but the rise was more than<br />
aecounted for by the normal seasonal movement in Queensland.<br />
At 31st January, 1948, unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service numbered 55,300 for males and 36,900 for females.<br />
The total was 19,200 greater than at December, 1947.<br />
NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.<br />
POLICY-MEDIATION.<br />
On 4th February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br />
Evatt) said-<br />
" Following the recent truce agreement, negotiations between the<br />
Dutch and Indonesians are continuing, but no result will be announced<br />
until after the Committee of Good Offices has reported to the Security </p>
<p>Council. The conmittee has arrived at -New York. It is possible that<br />
the council, after considering the report, will ask the committee to<br />
remain in the Netherlands East Indies for a further period.<br />
The sending, of fourteen Australian military officers to Java is to<br />
assist in the carrying cut of the cease fire plan which includes an<br />
agreement for the demilitarization of a certain area between areas held<br />
by the Dutch and indonesian forces. The committee has called on the<br />
Governments of Belgium, the United States and Australia to supply<br />
personnel to carry out the dctails of the plan. The main task is to I<br />
supervise the transfer of certain groups of Indonesian troops through<br />
the demilitarized zone to their own area. The officers will be carrying<br />
out a non-military function, but it is thought preferable to use military<br />
men for such a task.<br />
" Relations of the Australian representatives in Java with both the<br />
Dutch and Indonesians arc excellent and Dutch Government representatives<br />
at The Hague and Indonesian leaders have expressed appreciation<br />
of their work<br />
( ror earlier references, please see I-T. 128, page 32; No. 129, page 17; No. 130,<br />
page 8.)<br />
BANKING CONTROL.<br />
LEGISLAT1ON-NATIONALIZATION, COURT REARING.<br />
On 7th February, 194S, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" In view of the importance of the Banking Act case before the High<br />
Court of Australia. the A ttorney-Gen eral ( Dr. Evatt) will lead for the<br />
Commonwealth and the other defendants. Dr. Evatt and the Solicitor-<br />
General ( Professor K. H. Bailey) will appear in their official capacities<br />
for the defendants PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br />
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-LONG-TERM CONTRACTS, EGGS,<br />
EXTENSION.<br />
On 9th February, 194S, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard)<br />
announced that an agreement had been reached between the British<br />
Ministry of Food and the Commonwealth for the purchase of Australian<br />
eggs in shell, frozen egg pulp, and egg, powder. The existing contract,<br />
which was to have been effective until 30th June, 1950, would terminate<br />
on 30th June, 1948, and the new contract would commence with the<br />
season 1948-49 and extend up to and including the season 1952-53.<br />
The new contract envisaged that yearly progressive increases in production<br />
and export should commence in .1948-49, the objective being to<br />
a-chieve an export target of 105,000,0,00 dozens a season, in all forms.<br />
In the event of Australian exports not expanding sufficiently to provide<br />
a total shipment during 1949-50 and 1950-51 of the equivalent of<br />
4,500,000 cases, the British Ministry would have the right to call in<br />
January, 1951, for a review or revision of the quantities which it was<br />
committed to accept from Australia for the balance of the contract<br />
period. </p>
<p>To achieve before 1952-53 the full increase in egg exports as desired<br />
by the British Ministry, Australian egg production must be increased<br />
from its present level of 124,000,000 dozen eggs a year to about<br />
180,000,000 dozen. That would mean an increase of 5,500,000 birds in<br />
poultry flocks by 1952-53.<br />
Prices to apply for 1948-49, 1949-50 and 1950-51 were-<br />
Eggs in shell: 2s. 4d. a dozen; frozen whole egg ( egg pulp) Is. 8.9d. a lb.;<br />
dried sugared egg: 5s. Id. a lb.; dried whole egg: 7s. a lb.<br />
( These prices are for the 15 lb. pack: and prices for heavier or lighter packs<br />
will be adjusted pro rata.)<br />
Prices for 1951-52 and 1953 would be determined by further negotiation<br />
not less than sixteen months before the season to which they applied<br />
-at the beginning of the hatching season, which would substantially<br />
determine the size of flocks for the season in question.<br />
Oiling of shell eggs for export had been proved beneficial, and all<br />
prices fixed for shell eggs included allowance to cover the cost of oil<br />
processing. Maximum possible quantities were to be processed in<br />
1948-49, and thereafter all eggs in shell would be oiled.<br />
Only eggs which had not been washed may be included in the shell<br />
egg pack. Packing of shell eggs must take place during the period 1st<br />
June to 24th December in each year.<br />
The British Ministry would be given first preference for all shell<br />
eggs of export quality packed in Australia in the weight grades acceptable-<br />
13 lb. to 17 lb. a long hundred-and Australian exports of shell<br />
eggs in those grades to destinations other than Britain during the<br />
period January to June in each year, shall not exceed 2j per cent. of<br />
Australia's shell egg shipments to Britain during the preceding June-<br />
December period.<br />
AGRICULTURAL . COUNCIL MEETING-DECISIONS.<br />
On 9th February, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br />
said that a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council had been<br />
held. Decisions were-<br />
BRlTISH FOOD MIssIoN.-Council adopted a report from the Standing Comimittee<br />
on Agriculture expressing the view that the possibility existed for an<br />
expansion of food production in the Commonwealth to the mutual benefit of<br />
Britain and Australia, and that all available resources necessary to achieve this<br />
objective should be devoted to it by Commonwealth and State authorities.<br />
Council, which would confer with members of the mission, accepted the committee's<br />
view that it may be necessary, after the detailed objectives of the<br />
ission had been clarified and its proposals further developed, to arrange a<br />
special meeting to consider measures required to achieve increased production.<br />
EXPORT OF FEED GRAIns.-Council considered the export of feed grains other<br />
than wheat ( oats, feed barley, sorghum, imaize, millets and rye), and was of<br />
opinion that they should be held in Australia in sufficient quantity to meet<br />
the reasonable demands of the live-stock industry. Council considered that<br />
export of established surpluses of such grains should be permitted and that each<br />
kind of coarse grains should make its contribution to the live-stock feeding<br />
programmes. Council was of the opinion that producers of those grains should<br />
have the opportunity to share in both the domestic and export markets. Council<br />
was of the opinion that the possibilities'he urgently examined of setting up a<br />
coarse grains export authority to ensure equitable treatment to the individual<br />
States and to producers of the various types of coarse grains in relation to the<br />
exportation of those grains from the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>TOBACCO PRODUCrTIN.-Council considered the urgent necessity to increase<br />
production of tobacco leaf in Australia, in view of limitations imposed on the<br />
importation of tobacco from dollar areas. Council recommended that further<br />
consultations take place between Commonwealth and State representatives and<br />
technical officers to evolve definite plans for increased production of tobacco leaf<br />
of suitable quality, and that appropriate consultation take place with the<br />
Australian Tobacco Board.<br />
ToBAcco MARKTING.--Council considered the position in States directly concerned<br />
regarding uniform State legislation on the marketing of tobacco. All<br />
tobacco-producing States were not in favour of the introduction of the necessary<br />
legislation, and Council was of the opinion that, after the present season,<br />
any stabilized marketing of tobacco leaf must be entirely dependent on action<br />
taken by the respective States. Council recommended that representatives of<br />
the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, the Australian Tobacco Board,<br />
the Prices Commissioner and the four State Departments of Agriculture concerned<br />
should meet to devise plans to achieve some form of stability for sub-<br />
Lmission to Ministers and consideration at the next meeting of Council.<br />
POTATO MARIKETING.-Council noted that the functions of the Australian<br />
JPotato Committee had been continued to cover the 1947-48 crop, but the comnmittee<br />
could not continue to function. If organized marketing were to continue,<br />
a State action would be essential in the near future and for effective action coordination<br />
of the activities of the State organizations was necessary. Growers'<br />
organizations had approached the Commonwealth requesting continuance of<br />
Commonwealth guaranteed prices for potatoes. The Commonwealth would be<br />
prepared to consider such a request, but would need to be assured that marketing<br />
was organized on a basis that would ensure supplies being spread over the<br />
season; give a fair allocation of available supplies throughout the Commonwealth;<br />
and prevent over-supply to markets and depressed prices.<br />
EGc INiDUsTRY.-Council noted that from the surplus funds of the Commonwealth<br />
Egg Control, which would probably amount finally to between Å 700,000<br />
and Å 750,000, the Commonwealth Government had already agreed to the distribution<br />
of Å 300,000 between State Egg Boards on the basis of recorded<br />
production in each State during the period of Commonwealth control up to<br />
June, 1947. Council was informed the Commonwealth Government considered<br />
that it should be reimbursed from surplus funds for losses directly incurred<br />
in connexion with egg-drying plans since their introduction in the war period.<br />
Council decided that this be agreed to up to a maximum of Å 100,000. As regards<br />
the balance of the money, Council recommended that It be distributed to State<br />
' ga Boards pro rata to contributions to the control fund.<br />
POULTRY Co xEcEN.--Council decided to accept an invitation from the<br />
Danish Government to be represented at the Eighth World Congress of Poultry<br />
Breeders at Copeuhagen in August, 1948. The Principal of the Animal Health<br />
and Nutrition Laboratory of the West Australian Department of Agriculture<br />
( Dr. H. W. Bennetts), and the veterinary officer of the New South Wales<br />
Department of Agriculture ( Mr. G. L. McClymont) would be in Britain at that<br />
time, and an approach would be made to the Commonwealth Government to<br />
include those officers in the Australian delegation. The Commonwealth Dairy<br />
Officer at London ( Mr. A. D. Allanson) would attend the Congress.<br />
SuprpnEiPosSATE.-Council noted that National Security ( Superphosphate<br />
Industry) Regulations, which incorporated the Superphosphate Industry Committee,<br />
were discontinued from 1st anuary, 1948, and that the Minister for<br />
Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) had approved of the committee continuing to function<br />
a an advisory body. EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-RICE.<br />
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that the Australian rice crop of 32,000<br />
tons should be allocated to essential needs in Australia ( hospitals,<br />
invalids, Asiatics and the like); to New Guinea, Papua and Pacific<br />
Islands; to Malaya and other rice-deficient countries; with a shipment<br />
to Britain." </p>
<p>WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.<br />
POST1WAR-CONTINUANCE, MINISTERS' CONFEREN( XkE.<br />
On 11th February, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br />
said that Commonwealth and State Ministers for Agriculture had<br />
considered stabilization of the wheat industry. The amended plan of<br />
the Commonwealth Government was the basis of the discussion. Conference<br />
also received a submission from the Australian Wheatgrowers'<br />
Federation setting out its views. He had indicated to State Ministe,<br />
that he would submit to Cabinet a suggestion that the period of the<br />
plan be extended for one year to take in the 1952-53 harvest, thus<br />
making the initial period of operation of the plan eight years from the<br />
1945-46 harvest. He had indicated that if the findings of the Wheat<br />
Industry Costs Committee proved that it was impracticable to have an<br />
index formula for adjusting costs movements, or if application of itb<br />
findings proved impracticable, the Government would make periodi?!<br />
review of costs movements. The Government would determine the period<br />
of review and the machinery of review at the appropriate time. He<br />
had undertaken to recommend to Cabinet that a properly constituted<br />
authority be set up to provide for and determine any refund to wheatgrowers<br />
who had an equity in the Wheat Stabilization Fund if for an. N<br />
reason they were arbitarily forced to cease wheat growing.<br />
On some other points State Ministers were not prepared to commit<br />
their Government, but considered it necessary to have further consultation<br />
with them. That applied particularly to the federation's request<br />
that a ballot on wheat stabilization legislation should be tak,-en of all<br />
whcatgrowers of the Commonwealth who were registered and had sown<br />
acres or more to wheat.<br />
It was agreed that the matter would be discussed if desired after<br />
State Governments had considered the matter further and determined<br />
their policy on fundamental features of the plan.<br />

POST-WAR-CONTINIANCE, EXTENSION.<br />
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Cabinet to-day decided that the wheat stabilization plan be extended<br />
by one season to cover five seasons after 1947-48.<br />
Cabinet also approved the principle of setting aside up to half<br />
the annual interest earned by the wheat stabilization fund to repay<br />
approved eases in which a refund of tax payments is merited. The<br />
latter decision covers ' hard luck cases. Further consideration will be<br />
given to the constitution of an outhority to deal with these cases.".<br />
BRITAIN.<br />
FINANCIAL POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT,<br />
FEBRUARY, 19,48.<br />
On 11th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" The fall in values of shares on Australian stock exchanges may<br />
be attributed to various factors. These include the fall in overseas </p>
<p>prices for grain; President Truman's various statements that something<br />
must be done to retard rising prices and costs; and Britain's difficult<br />
economic position because the drain on . gold reserves has not been<br />
reduced as hoped. Speeches and statements by the British Chancellor<br />
of the Exchequer ( Sir Stafford Cripps), backed by facts, have made<br />
it clear that the going will be difficult. As a consequence, profits are<br />
not being reaped as they were before.<br />
" What happens on Australian stock exchanges is a reflection of what<br />
has happened in Britain and the United States, where there is every<br />
indication that a recession is coming.<br />
There is nothing more in it as far as Australia is concerned except<br />
in regard to prices for primary products, although these are mainly<br />
safeguarded by firm contracts. The second factor in Australia is<br />
concern as to rising costs. Opportunities offering to Australia for<br />
expansion and development are the greatest in history, and I am confident<br />
that that will take place even allowing for an overseas recession.".<br />
TAXATION.<br />
COMPANY TAX-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br />
On 12th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said:<br />
During the war, and since its conclusion, a good deal of adverse<br />
criticism has been directed against the incidence of income taxation<br />
on companies. Numerous published reports of annual meetings of<br />
companies have contained references to the crushing burden of taxation,<br />
its stifling effect on enterprise and the generally adverse economic<br />
effects of the Government's taxation policy.<br />
" Such comments have appeared so frequently that I am sure that,<br />
by force of sheer repetition, they are accepted as representing the facts<br />
of the position. So far as I am aware, no one has bothered to analyse<br />
the burden of taxation on companies and to relate that burden to company<br />
income levels. Obviously, taxation has increased as a result of the<br />
war; but the incomes out of which that taxation has been paid have not<br />
remained static, but have increased. The important factor is the relationship<br />
between the incomes remaining to companies after payment<br />
of taxation in the periods prior to, during, and subsequent to the war.<br />
Australia's participation in the recent war necessitated that every<br />
section of the community should bear a share of the tremendous cost<br />
associated with the war. It was determined at an early date that as far<br />
as possible Australia should, as a policy, attempt to meet war costs from<br />
current income and so reduce borrowing to a minimum. Accordingly,<br />
the rates and scope of all existing taxes were increased and new taxes<br />
imposed so as to ensure as far as possible that equality of sacrifice<br />
was achieved between the various components of the community. Row<br />
successful this policy proved has now become part and parcel of the<br />
financial history of the Commonwealth.<br />
It was realized that the primary and most flexible source of war<br />
revenue was income tax, since by a graduated income tax there is<br />
achieved the maximum degree of equity between individual taxpayers </p>
<p>and equality of sacrifice. The rates of individual income tax wore<br />
increased in 1940, 1941, and again in 1943, when they reached their<br />
peak. Companies, in their turn, were called upon to make some contribution<br />
to the cost of the war.<br />
" Immediately before the outbreak of war companies were liable,<br />
for Commonwealth purposes, to normal tax, imposed at a fiat rate of<br />
is. 1. Sd. in the Å 1 on each Å 1 of their taxable income. A private<br />
company, which mnay be broadly defined as a company which is under<br />
the control of not more than seven persons and whiceh is not a company<br />
in which the public is substantially interested, was liable for the additional<br />
tax which would have been payable by its shareholders if the<br />
undistributed amount had been distributed. In addition, companies<br />
were liable to various income taxes imposed by the States.<br />
" According to the Commonwealth Year Book ( Vol. 36, p. 745)<br />
collections from companies in the financial year 1938-1939 were as<br />
follows Commonwealth collections 4,300,0001<br />
State collections 11,498,000 15,798,000<br />
" Reference to the ' Twenty-second Report of the Commissioner of<br />
Taxation shows that, for Commonwealth purposes, companies derived<br />
a taxable income of Å 81,456,000 during the in-come year 1937-1938,<br />
the year to which collections for the financial year 1938-1939 are<br />
related. The variations between the States and the Commonwealth in the<br />
manner of ascertaining taxable income would raise the total taxable<br />
income to about Å 89,000,000 for all companies. Collections of<br />
Å 15,800,000 on this taxable income represent an overall effective rate<br />
of tax of 43.61d. or approximately 3s. Sd. in the For the year in<br />
question, therefore, companies, after payment of tax, had a total<br />
amount of profit available either for distribution or to place to reserves<br />
of Å 73,200,000. For the financial years 1939-1940 and 1940-1941 the rates of<br />
normal tax were increased to 2s. in the and in 1941-1942 the rate<br />
was increased to 4s. in the In 1942-1943, -with the introduction<br />
of uniform taxation, -companies were no longer subject to State income<br />
tax. To compensate for suspension of State tax, the rate of normal<br />
Commonwealth tax was increased from 4s. in the Å 1 to 6s. in the as<br />
the average rate of tax imposed on companies by the States was about<br />
2s. in the This point is frequently overlooked by critics who claim<br />
that the Commonwealth rate of normal company tax has increased by<br />
4s. 10.4d. ( that is, from Is. 1.8d. to whereas in reality, the rate has<br />
increased by only 2s. 10.4d.<br />
" Companies were, of course, subjected to other imposts in addition<br />
to an in-crease in the rate of normal company tax. </p>
<p>" Private companies continued throug hout the war and to the<br />
present time to be subject to the additional tax paid under' Division<br />
7 of the Income Tax A-ssessment Act. The amount of this tax is<br />
determined by reference to the amount of additional tax which would<br />
have been payable by the shareholders of the company if the company<br />
had paid the undistributed portion as a dividend. These assessments,<br />
as a consequence, reflected the rates of tax payable by individuals,<br />
which, as mentioned above, reached their peak in the financial year<br />
1943-1944.<br />
Much has been made of the incidence of this tax, it being claimed<br />
that it involves very high rates of tax. This view has arisen primarily<br />
because the Division 7 tax has been related to the undistributed amount<br />
and not to the taxable income, which is the true haze.<br />
The Twenty-sixth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Taxation<br />
( page 12) shows that for the financial year 1943-1944 private<br />
companies were assessed to Å 8,650,000 Division 7 tax on an undistributed<br />
income of Å 12,560,000. The average rate of Division 7 tax<br />
was therefore 165.3d. for each Å 1 of the undistributed amount. However,<br />
the taxable income of private companies in that year was.<br />
Å 51,486,000, so that the total Division 7 tax of Å 9,730,000 ( comprising<br />
Å 8,650,000 actually assessed and Å 1,080,000 estimated to be assessed)<br />
represents an average rate on the taxable income of 45.5d. in the Å 1.<br />
Although it may be considered that even the average rate -of<br />
45.5d. for Division 7 tax is high, it must be remembered that where<br />
a dividend is paid by a private company out of profits which have borne<br />
tax under Division 7 that dividend is virtually tax free in the hands of<br />
the shareholders, as they are entitled to a rebate of the tax -attributable<br />
to the inclusion of the dividend in the taxable income. No precise<br />
figures are available as to the amount of such tax free dividends, but<br />
some indication of their volume may be derived from the fact that in<br />
the income year 1943-1944 resident private companies paid dividends<br />
amounting to just over Å 19,000,000, the major portion of -which may<br />
be assumed to have been paid from funds which had borne Division<br />
7 tax. Non-private companies were also required to contribute their<br />
share to the rising costs of the war. As from the financial year<br />
1940-1941, non-private companies became liable for a super tax of<br />
is. in the Å 1 on that part of their taxable income in excess of Å 5,000.<br />
A super-tax rebate is allowed to avoid the dual payment of super-tax<br />
on income derived by a company and on dividends paid by that<br />
company to another company out of income on which super tax has.<br />
been paid or is payable.<br />
" From the financial year 1940-1941, non-private companies have<br />
also been liable to a further tax of 2s. in the Å 1 on that portion of their<br />
taxable income which has not been distributed as dividends. The yield<br />
from this further tax has never exceeded Å-2,000,000 annually.<br />
War-time ( Company) Tax was also imposed on non-private companies<br />
for the financial year 1940-1941 et seq. This tax differed from. </p>
<p>the war-time profits tax imposed during World War I. and the British<br />
Excess Profits Tax. These latter taxes adopted a standard of pre-war<br />
profits and sought to drain off any profits in excess of this standard as<br />
being attributable to excess war profits. The War-time ( Company)<br />
Tax, however, was designed to levy tax on the basis of the percentage<br />
of the taxable profit to the capital employed.<br />
The number of companies which have been assessed to Wartime<br />
( Company) Tax has never been large-in fact, only 757 companies<br />
were so assessed for the financial year 1944-1945. These 757<br />
companies were assessed to Å 4,390,000 on a taxable profit of<br />
Å 28,500,000. The total taxable income of the companies concerned<br />
amounted to Å 45,400,000, the War-time ( Company) Tax therefore<br />
being imposed at an effective average rate of only some 23s. 2d. If the<br />
total taxable income of all public companies, Å 98,621.000, is taken<br />
into account in weighing the effect of War-time ( Company) Tax,<br />
the effective average rate is only 10.7d. in the Å 1.<br />
" In considering the incidence of War-time ( Company) Tax, it<br />
should be remembered that, in determining the amount of War-time<br />
( Company) Tax payable, the amount of super tax payable by the<br />
company is allowed as a rebate from the War-time ( Company) Tax<br />
otherwise payable. The allowance of the rebate has the practical<br />
effect of rendering many companies non-taxable for the purposes of<br />
War-time (' Company) Tax.<br />
Having briefly surveyed the existing taxes on companies and<br />
commented on their individual incidence, it may be of interest to set<br />
out, as accurately as available statistics permit, the total weight of<br />
taxation on both private and non-private companies. The main source<br />
of these statistics are the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of<br />
Taxation. " In the financial year 1944-1945 private companies were<br />
assessed to the following taxes on a total taxable income of Å 55,500,000,<br />
which was derived during the year ended June 30, 1944-<br />
Normal tax at Gs. in the Å 1 15.690.000<br />
Division 7 tax actually assessed to 30th June, 1946 2,289,000<br />
Estimated to be assessed after 30th June, 1946 1,342,000 3,631,000<br />
19,321,000<br />
Thus, for the financial year 1944-1945, private companies paid<br />
on their total taxable income, an average rate of 83.5d. in the Å 1.<br />
" It must, however, be observed that the Division 7 tax payable<br />
in respect of the financial year 1944-1945 was reduced by 75 per cent.<br />
as a result of the introduction of the system of pay-as-you-earn.<br />
Consequently, the ' average rate of tax arrived at above is not representative<br />
of all years.<br />
" The Division 7 tax payable in respect of the financial year<br />
1943-44 ( in which year the peak war-time rates were first operative) </p>
<p>amuounted to Å 9,743,000 on a taxable income of Å 51,486,000 representing<br />
the levy of Division 7 tax at an average rate of 45.5d. in'the E1.<br />
If this rate is accepted as typical of the Division 7 tax payable when<br />
rates were at their peak, the overall rate of 194445 would have been<br />
113.3d., if the 75 per cent. rebate had not been granted.<br />
Preliminary figures for the financial year 1945-1946 tend to<br />
confirm this overall average rate, the tentative 1945-19-48 figure being<br />
115.8d. It can be said then that the overall average rate of tax paid by<br />
private companies when rates -of tax were at their highest approximated<br />
9.6d. in the Å 1.<br />
" For the financial year 1944-1945 ( income year 1943-1944), the<br />
taxable income of public companies amounted to Å 98,621,000. These<br />
companies were assessed to the following taxes:<br />
Normal tax at Gs. in the Å 1 26,780,000<br />
Super tax 3,803,000<br />
Part lIIIA:<br />
Actually assessed to 30th June, 1946 1,989,000<br />
Estimated to be assessed after 30thl June,<br />
1946 110,000 2,099,000<br />
War-time ( Conipany) Tax -4,390,000 37,072,000<br />
" The overall average rate of tax paid by public companies for the<br />
financial year 1944-1945 was therefore 90.2d.<br />
" Although public companies appear to have an advantage over<br />
private companies in that the overall average rate of tax paid by them<br />
is less than that paid by private companies, any dividends paid by<br />
public companies are, in the generality of cases, fully taxable in the<br />
bands of the individual recipient. On the other hand, dividends paid<br />
by private companies out of funds which have borne tax under Division<br />
7 may be regarded for all practical purposes, as exempt in the hands<br />
of the shareholder.<br />
11I think that it is, therefore, fair to say that the effective rate<br />
of tax imposed on all companies over the war years would approximate<br />
in the Li-or 7s. 6d. in the In the light of the sacrifices<br />
and demands made upon other sections of the community, I do not<br />
think that companies have been unfairly treated by the incidence of<br />
income taxation, -In fact, when compared with the weight of company<br />
taxation in other countries, companies in Australia have escaped lightly<br />
over the war years.<br />
But what has been the general effect on companies of the in-creased<br />
rates of taxation? In 1938-1939, the combined collections from company<br />
income tax by the Commonwealth and the States were nearly<br />
Å 16,000,000; 1944-1945, Commonwealth collections from companies<br />
amounted to Å 60,000,000. The initial reaction is that during the war<br />
years, the profits avail-able to companies after payment Of tax must<br />
have diminished considerably in order to meet the additional taxes<br />
of some Å 44,000,000. But such has not been the case. Since 1938-1939, </p>
<p>the national income has increased by some 64 per cent., and companies<br />
have enjoyed a similar increase in their taxabte incomes. The net<br />
result h-as been that, despite the burden of war taxation, companies<br />
have had more available, either for distribution to shareholders or to<br />
place to reserve, than they had in pre-war years. This I regard as at<br />
tribute to the manner in which my Government has financed the war<br />
and created conditions of relative economic prosperity.<br />
The extent to which net company profits have increased over the<br />
war years is apparent from the following table which is based uponL<br />

" From column it is apparent that companies, over the war<br />
-years, have obtained practically a constant share of the national<br />
income, so that they have benefited from the increased activity resulting<br />
from the favorable economic conditions resulting from the policy.<br />
of my Government during the war. More sig-nificant still is the fact<br />
that despite the increase in taxes paid by companies ( Column the<br />

have never fallen below the 1938-1939 level, and had, in fact, by<br />
1946-1947, increased by nearly 40 per cent. Further, the undistributed<br />
profits accruing to residents have at least been maintained over the<br />
war year-s and are now displaying an upward trend.<br />
" In the ligrht of these facts, I hope that the belief that the weight<br />
of company tax has ruined companies and retarded economic progress,<br />
will uow be scotched for all time. Companies% have, along with other<br />
sections of the community, received the benefit of the Government's<br />
policy of full employment, resulting in an expansion of all forms of<br />
economic activity.<br />
" That my Government is alive to the-important influence which<br />
companies have on the economic life of the community is evidenced by<br />
the fact that since the end of the war, the taxation of both private<br />
Creceiavnde ndon -private companies has been reduced. Private companies have<br />
the benefit of the greatly reduced rates of tax payable by<br />
individuals in their Division 7 assessments. Non-private companies9<br />
are no longer subject to War-time ( Company) Tax, a fact which should<br />
prove of great benefit to newly established and expanding businesses."~<br />
On 23rd February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
There has been some criticism of my recent statement on company<br />
taxation. Most of the comment is extraneous to the main issue, being<br />
directed at the weight of all taxation, the level of Government expenditure<br />
and the extent of Governmental control. A statement on the<br />
incidence of company taxation is not the appropriate place to deal with<br />
such comment which will be replied to at the appropriate time and<br />
place. " Other critics appear to have overlooked the fact that the statement<br />
dealt only with the incidence of income tax on companies. at<br />
has been argued, for instance, that because a rebate of company tax<br />
isq not now allowed to shareholders on dividends;, companies are paying<br />
more tax than pre-war. These critics appear to have found it necessary<br />
to bolster their case by taking into account the tax paid by individuals-<br />
a factor which is not relevant to the issue.<br />
Another critic has pointed out that net company income ( that<br />
is, after payment of taxes) as a percentage of national income has<br />
declined from 9.1 per cent. in 1938-39 to 6.8 per cent, in 1946-47.<br />
This comparison of percentages merely tends to obscure the real issue.<br />
The fact that must constantly he borne in mind is that the actual level<br />
of net company income, after payment of tax, has increased from<br />
Å 73,000,000 in 1938-39 to Å 87,000,000 in 1946-47-an increase of<br />
Å 14,000,000 or nearly 20 per cent.<br />
Some of the criticism, however, calls for some reply. For instance,<br />
it has been stated that companies are now unable to, pursue a policy<br />
of development and expansion because undistributed profitb available<br />
to companies in 1946-47 were only Å 5,000,000 higher at Å 39,000,000<br />
than they were in 1938-39. It is claimed that this increase is inadequate<br />
to meet present day costs of acquiring equipment and plant. </p>
<p>" In my opinion, the criticism overlooks certain important factors.<br />
In the first place, undistributed profits are not the only source of<br />
funds for development and expansion of companies. Secondly, the<br />
undistributed profits available to companies during the war years never<br />
fell below the 1938-39 level and actually rose as high as Å 42,000,000.<br />
The Government has shown companies sympathetic consideration in<br />
allowing them to retain these undistributed profits during the war.<br />
It is certain that individual taxpayers did not have the same opportunity<br />
of building up similar reserves during the period when individual<br />
rates of tax were at their peak.<br />
The total of undistributed profits accruing to companies during<br />
and immediately after the war, amounted to some Å 180,000,000.<br />
Shortages of man-power and materials have, up to the present, largely<br />
precluded expenditure of these reserves on replacement or development<br />
work. A reasonably large proportion of this accumulation should<br />
now be available for this purpose.<br />
Obsolete and outworn plant, and the like, are normally replaced<br />
by means of a depreciation reserve which is built up over the life of<br />
the plaiw. Thus a considerable proportion of the capital necessary<br />
to replace existing plant and equipment should already be in the hand<br />
of companies. In addition, they rould have recourse to their accumulated<br />
undistributed profits.<br />
" Further, the purchase of new, and replacement of obsolete plant<br />
and equipment is encouraged by special depreciation provisions in the<br />
Income Tax A. ssessment Act. These provide an initial depreciation<br />
allowance of 20 per cent. ( in addition to normal depreciation) on<br />
all depreciable assets acquired during the five years ended 30th June,<br />
1950. The combined effect of all these factors is largely if not completely<br />
to offset the higher cost of new machinery and equipment.<br />
It has also been suggested that the average rates of tax payable<br />
by companies, as calculated in my original statement, over the war<br />
yei: rs are misleading, because some companies paid more and some less<br />
tlian the average rate. This is inherent in all averages, but the average<br />
rate of 7s. 6d. in the Å 1 paid by companies does indicate that the great<br />
proportion of companies paid either this rate or less on the whole of<br />
their taxable income.<br />
None of the critics has been able to refute the facts contained in<br />
my statement or to deny that as compared with other sections of the<br />
community ( and with other countries), companies have received fair<br />
treatment from the taxation viewpoint."<br />
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH.<br />
PROPOSED CONFERENCE.<br />
On 13th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Nothing can be gained by holding a British Commonwealth Conference<br />
at the moment. I cannot say what the future holds, as something<br />
is taking place all the time. We understand the position on<br />
finance and on the question of a production drive. First of all. production<br />
is aimed at providing food for Britain. The more we enrouraqe </p>
<p>increased production the closer we are to the solution of all difficulties.<br />
The fundamental thing is to get the best possible production to solve<br />
the dollar crisis, our own shortages and the need for food. But at the<br />
moment, on the informaticn available to us, there is nothing to be<br />
gained by a special conference. What the future holds will be determined<br />
in the light of circumstances.".<br />
VISIT OF KING AND QUEEN TO AUSTRALIAANNOUNCEMENT.<br />
On 6th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley broadcast over the national network.<br />
Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Men and women of Australia,<br />
It is my most happy duty and privilege to make an announcement<br />
to the people of Australia.<br />
" His Majesty the King has commanded His Excellency the<br />
r Governor-General to authorize me to make public the following bulletin<br />
which His Excellency has received from Buckingham Palace, London-<br />
In response to a suggestion made by his Prime Ministers in New Zealand<br />
and Australia, the King has graciously consented to visit these countries in the<br />
early part of 1949. His Majesty will be accompanied by the Queen and the<br />
Princess Margaret.<br />
" I know that the knowledge that Their Majesties and the Princess<br />
Margaret will, at a comparatively early date, visit us will give the<br />
greatest satisfaction to all Australians and I have asked the Governor-<br />
General to express our gratitude to His Majesty. All will look forwar]<br />
eagerly to the opportunity of showing here in Australia the feelings<br />
of pride and affection we have for the Royal Family.<br />
The Government of the Commonwealth will gladly join with the<br />
Governments of the States and with public and private bodies in<br />
ensuring that a fitting welcome be given to our Royal guests.'".<br />
On 9th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
" The Minister for Munitions ( Senator Armstrong) will he<br />
Minister-in-charge of the Royal Visit to Australia in 1949."<br />

CONVERSION LOAN.<br />
LONDON OPERATION, JANUARY, 1948, SUCCESS.<br />
On 13th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />

South Wales 5{ per cent. loan, has closed with applications amounting<br />
to Å 10,420,300. This leaves Å 2,450,000 to be taken up by the underwriters. </p>
<p>22<br />
" This result is regarded as satisfactory in view of the adverse<br />
factors which affected the market after the lists were opened. Since<br />
the loan closed the securities have been quoted at a premium."<br />
OLYMPIC GAMES.<br />
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said<br />

On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" The Board of Business Administration ceased to, function on<br />
December 31, 1947, with the expiry of Defence ( Transitional) Act<br />
Regulations. The board, which. operated with the Defence Division of<br />
the Treasury, was responsible for the review of proposals by Service<br />
Departments for works and supplies, for inspections and investigations<br />
of financial and accounting matters and for co-ordination of matters<br />
from a joint-services aspect.<br />
" In November, 1947, Cabinet approved a procedure for review and<br />
approval of works proposals, involving a review by a sub-committee of<br />
Cabinet, assisted by an inter-departmental committee.<br />
" With regard to matters other than works and to maintain the<br />
established principle of review with modifications suitable to existing<br />
circumstances. I arranged for discussions between the Treasury and<br />
the Departments of Defence, Navy, Army and Air. </p>

Matters to be referred for review will be-<br />
Programme and st teiuits of requirements for annual Estimates purposes<br />
under the defence plan and in respect of war commitments.<br />
Any variations from the above required to be implemented during the year<br />
in anticipation of next year's Estimates. ( This will include increases in numbers<br />
of personnel as irovided for respective ranks in annual Estimates.)<br />
Variations in the approved bases of provisioning; or the authorized equipment<br />
tables. Any proposition not covered by the foregoing involving the purs,<br />
chase of plant, equipment, motor transport, spare parts and supplies where the<br />
expenditure involved would exceed Å 5.000.<br />
r Questions involvinl variations in standards of issue of clothing and rations<br />
and in standards of furniture, office equipment and departmental services<br />
generally. Pay and conditions of service of members of the forces.<br />
Any other expenditure proposals having a joint-service aspect.<br />
Systems in relation to financial and store accounts.<br />
HEALTH.<br />
RADIOLOGY.<br />
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said--<br />
Cabinet to-day approved, on the recommendation of the Minister<br />
for Health ( Senator McKenna), of the establishment of a physical<br />
service in radiology at Perth. to be a branch of the Commonwealth<br />
X-ray and Radium Laboratory at Melbourne. The new project will<br />
serve a useful purpose in standardizing diagnostic and therapeutic<br />
x-ray equipment; the working conditions of persons engaged in x-ray<br />
occupations, radium and other electro-medical equipment; and in the<br />
distribution of radon. RESEARCH GRANT.<br />
On 19th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
The Government has agreed to contribute, through the National<br />
Health and Medical Research Council, Å 20,000 towards the cost of<br />
biophysical equipment to be installed at Melbourne at the Walter and<br />
Eliza Hall Institute of Research in Pathology and Medicine. This<br />
amount is in addition to the annual grant made to the institute by the<br />
council from funds provided by the Commonwealth Government, and<br />
amounting in the current year to Å 15,000.<br />
This Commonwealth contribution will allow of adequate physicochemical<br />
studies of viruses, enzymes and proteins, by the use of the<br />
most modern analytical ultra-centrifuge and electrophoresis apparatus </p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION.<br />
REVENUE FROM LICENCES.<br />
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" Cabinet decided to-day to approve expenditure by the Australian<br />
Broadcasting Commission, during the three months ending 30th June.<br />
1948, of an amount not exceeding one-quarter of the Commission's<br />
estimated expenditure of Å. 1,304,500 for 1947-48; namely, Å 326,125<br />
On the 16th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Cabinet to-day decided that the Australian Broadcasting Commission<br />
lie authorized to expend during the present financial year, in addition<br />
to Å 1,304,000 already approved, an amount not exceeding Å 20,000<br />
to enable the commission to mreet additional costs involved in the application<br />
by the Public Service Arbitrator of marginal increases to the<br />
staff of the com~ mission".'<br />

INQUIRY-REPORT.<br />
Onl 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chitley) said-<br />
" Cabinet to-day received the report of a committee, comprising<br />
Messrs. A. A. Fitzgerald, chairman, E. G. Bonney and W. T. Harris,<br />
who were appointed to consider the administration and financial<br />
organization of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to report<br />
whether the powers, functions and obligations of the commission, as<br />
prescribed in the Australian Broadcasting Act, are being discharged<br />
with maximum efficiency, adequate control and due economy of expenditure<br />
and whether any changes are desirable.<br />
" Cabinet decided that the report be referred to the Cabinet subcommittee<br />
on Broadcasting, comprising the Minister for Supply ( Senator<br />
Ashley), the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron) and the<br />
Minister for Information ( Mr. Calwell). The Cabinet sub-committee<br />
will report further to Cabinet.<br />
The committee has formed the opinion that generally the present<br />
administration, control and organization of the commission is satisfactory;<br />
that the financial and accounting procedures are well-designed<br />
and effectively carried out; and that although some economies could be<br />
effected, it would not be practicable for the commission to be financially<br />
self-supporting unless revenue is substantially increased or activities<br />
substantially curtailed SOCIAL SECURITY.<br />
TUBERCULOSIS-CABINET DECISION.<br />
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" Cabinet to-day considered recommendations for a plan to wage<br />
war on tuberculosis, designed to reduce tuberculosis to a problem of<br />
min-or importance within twenty years. Apart from its toll in human<br />
misery and distress, tuberculosis involves vast economic loss to the<br />
nation through loss of mnan-power hours in industry, lowering of the </p>
<p>birth rate and the expenditure of millions of pounds on treatment, convalescence<br />
and social benefits. The disease demands national concern<br />
both because its incidence fails very heavily on young adults in their<br />
most productive and reproductive years but also because, being<br />
infectious, it is a source of real danger to every person in the community.<br />
If detected early it can usually be arrested and the patient<br />
returned to useful citizenship.<br />
he Federal Health Council, the National Health and Medical<br />
Research Council and medical bodies have been advocating for many<br />
years a vigorous attack on tuberculosis under Commonwealth leadership<br />
and with adequate Commonwealth financial backing. The power conferred<br />
on the Commonwealth Parliament at the last referendum to provide<br />
medical services has opened the way to Commonwealth entry into<br />
the field as well as imposing a high responsibility on the Commonwealth.<br />
Principles and methods to be applied to the control of tuberculosis are<br />
well established and have been effectively applied in other parts of the<br />
world-notably in Scandanavian countries, Canada ( particularly<br />
Ontario and Saskatchewan) and in most of the United States.<br />
The recently appointed Commonwealth Director of Tuberculosis<br />
H. W. Wunderly) has completed a survey of the facilities and<br />
needs in each State in relation to this disease which, it is estimated,<br />
atiects from 30,000 to 40,000 persons.<br />
Cabinet authorized the Minister for Health ( Senator McKenna)<br />
to draft legislation to effect necessary amendments to the Tuberculosis<br />
Act. Senator McKenna stressed that no housing problem was of greater<br />
urgency than that of housing in isolation in suitably equipped buildings<br />
sufferers who: as well as needing to be saved from the disease, are a<br />
nenace to the health and lives of their fellows unless precautionary<br />
measures are strictly observed.<br />
The co-operation of the . States will be sought in making a uniform<br />
approach to the problem. Subject to agreement between the States and<br />
the Commonwealth as to a general plan of campaign evolved in consultation,<br />
the Commonwealth will provide the necessary money for new<br />
buildings and equipment and will be prepared to provide a substantial<br />
proportion of maintenance involved.<br />
Dr. Wunderly's report will be circulated to the States as a basis<br />
for discussion and Dr. Wunderly will argair visit all States in the near<br />
future. A very brief summary of Dr. Wunderly's report shows that an<br />
important element in an attack on tuberculosis is the education of the<br />
, public to prevent the spread of the disease. In this, the Government<br />
invites the co-operation of the press, the radio, the newsreels and<br />
voluntary bodies who, with limited finances and facilities, have done<br />
splendid work in combating the disease and making the public conscious<br />
of tuhbrculosis. I am confident that this co-operation will be forthcoming.<br />
The full co-operation of medical schools, teaching hospitals<br />
and o. ther institutions is also desired. It is estimated that the Commonwalrh<br />
will, from an early sage of the campaign, be involved in consi!<br />
crable expendcture. Thli will in in addition to the amounts now being </p>
<p>expended annually by State governments. The Government is anxious<br />
that there should be an immediate, vigorous and efficient approach to<br />
the treatment, prevention and control of tuberculosis in this country".<br />

PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED PERSONS.<br />
On 16th February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
In 1945, Cabinet approved the development of an interim scheme<br />
of rehabilitation under the Re-establishment and Employment Act to<br />
cover ex-servicemen not eligible for medical benefits under the<br />
Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and directed that a committee,<br />
representative of the Treasury, the Department of Post-war Reconstruction<br />
and the Department of Social Services should prepare a report on a<br />
permanent scheme for the general community.<br />
" Cabinet to-day approved the committee's recommendations as<br />
follows:-Establishment of a rehabilitation scheme for the general community, providing<br />
medical treatment and vocational training.<br />
Persons from certain groups at present to be brought into the schemedisabled<br />
ex-members of the forces covered by Part IV. of the Re-establishment and<br />
Employment Act as at time of the commencement of the general scheme for the<br />
rehabilitation of disabled persons; invalid pensioners or claimants for the invalid<br />
pension; those receivinl or claiming unemployment or sickness benefits who may<br />
become unemployed unl ss rehabilitation assistance is given.<br />
A report to be presented within twelve months on the practicability and<br />
desirability of including adolescents.<br />
Adoption of the plrinciple of inclusion ultimately of recognized industrial<br />
diseases groups within the scheme.<br />
Eligibility to be restricted to cases drawn from the groups set out above<br />
where the disability has already lasted thirteen weeks at the time of application,<br />
appears likely to last at least a further thirteen weeks ( making 26 weeks<br />
in all) and to he a substantial handicap to the person in securing suitable<br />
employment; yet is remediable and allows of reasonable prospects of employ.<br />
ability within two years.<br />
During medical treatment, the pensioner should continue to receive his social<br />
services benefit and also the actual cost of fares where he is required to travel<br />
for treatment. The fares paid are not to be regarded as ' income' under the<br />
Social Services Consolidation Act.<br />
During vocational training, the trainee should receive a benefit at the rate<br />
of, and subject to, a means test similar to that for invalid pensions, plus a<br />
training allowance of 20s. a week, the actual cost of fares where he is required<br />
to travel regularly for training, and a living away from home allowance as<br />
outlined above.<br />
Medical examination to determine eligibility to be free. Cost of medical<br />
treatment to be borne by the Commonwealth only to the extent to which the<br />
patient is unable to meet he expense. Medical appliances, and also books and<br />
tools of trade supplied on the successful completion of training, to be a charge<br />
to the patient on a basis to be fixed by the Department of Social Services and<br />
the Treasury.<br />
A bill to be prepared for submission to the Federal Parliamentary Labour<br />
party. Pending the passing of legislation, the Government authorize the commencement<br />
of the scheme as outlined to operate from 1st January, 1948, to permit of<br />
continuity of the treatment and training of ex-service personnel accepted under<br />
Part IV. of the Re-establishment and Employment Act as at 31st December,<br />
1947 </p>
<p>27<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT-QUEENSLAND.<br />
On 25th February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
In connexion with the payment of unemployment benefit to persons<br />
involved in or affected by the present Queensland industrial dispute,<br />
the Social Services Consolidation Act provides that benefit is not<br />
payable to an applicant whose unemployment is due to him being a<br />
direct participant in a strike.<br />
In relation to other persons involved in or affected by an industrial<br />
dispute, the Minister for Social Services has issued instructions which<br />
are being observed by the Department of Social Services in Queensland<br />
at present and throughout the Commonwealth. These instructions are<br />
the outcome of a full consideration of the relevant parts of the Act of a<br />
Cabinet sub-committee early in 1947. In brief, the instructions embody<br />
the following principles:--<br />
In respect of unions on strike and unions sponsoring a strike of its members in<br />
key positions, member'. of these unions, whether directly participating in the<br />
strike, or unemployed as a direct or indirect consequence of the strike, are not to<br />
be regarded as eligible to receive unemployment benefit.<br />
In respect of union not on strike. or apparently having no members on strike,<br />
members of these unions are to he regarded as eligible to receive unemployment<br />
benefit. A ersoin i-nit to be disquiialificd for iiieminployinmet benefit by reason only<br />
of his refusal to undertake work available through a strike or lockout.<br />
Persons eligible under these principles for benefit will, of course,<br />
have to satisfy the other eligibility provisions in the Act<br />
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS.<br />
OVERSEAS REPRESENTATION.<br />
On 16th February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br />
Evatt) said-<br />
The Government is taking steps to raise the status of the Australian<br />
missions in Russia, France and China. The fact that these three countries<br />
have seen fit to accord the increased status to Australia is tangible<br />
recognition of the increased role which Australia has come to play<br />
in international affairs in recent years.<br />
The status of the Australian mission in the United States was<br />
raised from that of Minister to Ambassador in June, 1946, and this last<br />
action, covering the remaining permanent members of the Security<br />
Council, is in accordance with a decision taken in principle by the<br />
Government at that time.<br />
" The change, while not increasing either the size of staffs or<br />
financial commitments, is largely to indicate the importance which each<br />
country attaches to the other with which it has diplomatic relations,<br />
and it is related to the seniority of the particular representative and<br />
the facilities to be made available to him in the country to wnich he is<br />
accredited ii </p>

PARLIAMENT.<br />
INCREASED MEMBERSHIP.<br />
On 17th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said--<br />
The Federal Parliamentary Labour party to-day approved of legislation<br />
to increase the number of senators from each State by four with<br />
a corresponding increase, as provided in the Constitution, in the membership<br />
of the House of Representatives.<br />
The Federal Parliamentary Labour party approved of the principle<br />
of the proportional representation system of voting being applied<br />
to the Senate MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.<br />
UTILIZATION OF PLANT-FURTHER SALES.<br />
On 21st February, 1948, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br />
( Mr. Dedman) announced the following decisions:-<br />
Munitions annexe at Lane Cove sold to Robert Corbett<br />
Pty. Ltd., for the manufacture of chemicals.<br />
Commonwealth annexe at Lidcombe leased to Australian<br />
Forge and Engineering Pty. Ltd., of Lidcombe, for the manufacture<br />
of forged axles and automotive spare parts.<br />
Munitions factory at Tamworth sold to Amalgamated<br />
Wireless ( A/ asia.) Ltd.<br />
Munitions factory at St. Marys leases to Aldaco<br />

Hill; Howletts Industries Pty. Ltd.; H. S. Kirkwood; K. H. Freeman;<br />
Druco Tool and Engineering Co. Pty. Ltd.; J. Thurling.<br />
JAPAN.<br />
TRADE-PRIVATE TRADING.<br />
On 22nd February, 1948, the Prime Minister) said-<br />
Arrangements have now been completed with the Supreme Command<br />
of the Allied Powers in Japan to permit the early resumption<br />
of two-way trade on a limited scale between Australia and Japan<br />
within the general framework of the Interim Sterling Payments Agreement<br />
recently negotiated with Supreme Command Allied Powers by the<br />
British authorities.<br />
" The agreement provides for all private trade between Japan and<br />
the sterling area ( excluding Hong Kong) to be financed in sterling<br />
through special sterling accounts established in the name of Supreme<br />
Command Allied Powers with British banks. The agreement to which<br />
Australia is a party was concluded in November, 1947, but the necessary<br />
banking arrangements have only recently been completed.<br />
" One of the clauses of the agreement provides that unused balances<br />
held in Supreme Command Allied Power's sterling accounts may be<br />
innverted into dollars at six monthly intervals. Because of this clause </p>
<p>29<br />
it has been necessary to treat Japan as virtually a ' dollar' country<br />
for import licensing purposes and up to the present no licences have<br />
been granted for the private importation of Japanese goods.<br />
" Arrangements have now been made with Supreme Command<br />
Allied Powers which will, to some extent, overcome the difficulties<br />
created by the convertibility ejause and will permit two-way trade to<br />
be revived on a limited scale. The basis of the arrangement is that<br />
the Commonwealth Government will authorize the issue of licences<br />
for the importation by private traders of certain essential goods from<br />
Japan thus providing Supreme Command Allied Powers with funds for<br />
the purchase of Australian wool and other products.<br />
Stocks of wool in Japan are very low and exports of Australian<br />
wool to Japan since the cessation of hostilities have been limited to a<br />
single shipment of about 7,500 bales. Further purchases have not been<br />
possible because Japan has not been able to finance them. As payment<br />
is miade for Australian imports of Japanese goods under the arrangenient<br />
now concluded Supreme Command Allied Powers will be in a<br />
position to resume purchases of Australian wool through agents at the<br />
auctions. An undertaking, has been g-iveni ly Supreme Command Allied<br />
1Powers that the whole of the proceeds of permitted imports into Australia<br />
from Japan will be used for the purchase of Australian wool and<br />
other prodlucts and no question of conversion of marginal amounts into<br />
dollars will therefore arise.<br />
Cotton textiles and cotton yarn are excluded from the arrangement<br />
because they are at present available only against dollar payments but<br />
impiort lienfes will be granted for Japanese raw silk, rayon yarn,<br />
milling silk and certain essential utility types of rayon textiles."<br />
( ror earlier references, please see No. 128, page 24; No. 132, page 3.)<br />
On 24th February, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator<br />
(' nurtice) said that since the cessation of hostilities, cotton textiles,<br />
rayon yarn and raw silk had been purchased by the Commonwealth<br />
Government from Japan, but it was not expected that further Government<br />
cash purchases would be undertaken. Licences will be issued for<br />
raw silk and rayon yarn direct to users, while licences for milling silk<br />
would be issued to importers who had been obtaining their requirements<br />
from other sources. Licences would be granted for suitable types of<br />
porcelain insulators and. it was intended to restrict the issue of those<br />
licences to electric light and power undertakings. Regarding cotton<br />
piece goods, the occupation authorities still required dollars in payment<br />
and import licences would not be issued.<br />
INCOME TAX.<br />
BOARD OF REVIEW.<br />
On 23rd February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Mr. G. J. J. O'Sullivan has been appointed a member of the<br />
Taxation Board of Review at Sydney for seven years as from 1st<br />

<p>REPARATIONS.<br />
' GERMANY-SCIENTIFIC PERSONNEL.<br />
On 24th February, 1948, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br />
( Mr. Dedman) announced that arrangements has been made for the<br />
admission of more German scientists to Australia to assist in research<br />
and production problems associated with industrial development.<br />
Before allotment to specific tasks, the Government would make the<br />
experts available to industrialists for general consultation. They<br />
included-Dr. R. Hoffnan. who specialized in the treatment of metal surfaces<br />
especially for the electrical industry ( including the preparation of surfaces<br />
anti-ccrrosive alluys, anodising electro-plating and sherardising) and the<br />
technical application of electro-osmosis.<br />
Dr. F. O. Weinert, who would advise on processes concerning the extracting<br />
of salts from German potash deposits, new compounds for seed treatment, dyestuffs<br />
and intermediates, tlerinclhemistry of iron from ores, magnesium and<br />
production of intermediates.<br />
Dr. J. Unterzaucher, a micro-analyst.<br />
Dr. H. Ritter and a technical assistant, who were experts in the designing<br />
and manufacturing of scientific instruments relating to nmasurement technique,<br />
including those for geodetic, astronomic, optic and inter-ferometric purposes.<br />
On 13th March, 1948, Mr. Dedman announced that arrangements<br />
had been made for the admission of more German scientists to Australia<br />
during March, 1948. They were-<br />
Dr. A. Gross, chemist, qualified in research and manufacture of artificial<br />
resins; Dr. T. Feuerriegel, expert on optical and similar instruments; Messrs.<br />
H. Hock, specialist in design and production of machine tools; T. Schobel,<br />
leading designer of electric meters, test equipment, motors; A. Seyler, expert<br />
in radio, television, and telecommunications; Fieguth, leading engineer in<br />
electro-technical and high frequency engineering.<br />

RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
WORLD ORGANIZATION-TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT<br />
AGREEMENT.<br />
In Parliamen.-On 26th February, 1948, the Minister for Postwar<br />
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-<br />
I lay on the table the following paper:-<br />
United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment-Memorandum<br />
showing alteration of Tariff duties,<br />
in substitution for the paper tabled on 18th November, 1947, by the<br />
Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. This document, while including<br />
all the information contained in the previous document, gives additional<br />
information and should be of greater assistance to the House<br />
when studying the tariff alterations resulting from the International<br />
Conference on Trade and Employment."<br />
( For earlier references, please see No. 132, page 3.)<br />
In Parliament.-On 26th February, 1948, the Prime Minister<br />
( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The great struggle which democracy is having to-day to combat<br />
the inroads of communism is due to the fact that the conservative<br />
interests of the world have fertilized the soil in which communism has </p>
<p>grown over the centuries. The Labour party is just as concerned about<br />
production as is any other party. It is actuated not so much by<br />
political motives as by a desire to satisfy the need of the great mass<br />
of the people of Australia for essential goods and to make the utmost<br />
possible contribution to the welfare of other peoples of the world, many<br />
of whom are starving. That is not a political creed; it is a humanitarian<br />
creed.<br />
" One has to cast one's mind back over events of recent years to<br />
realize the source from which the Geneva trade agreement and other<br />
matters have sprung. I recall the state of affairs in 1941-42, when the<br />
people of Britain were standing -almost alone. Some method had to be<br />
devised to secure help from the United States, and I think the idea<br />
developed in the mind of President Roosevelt ' himself. It had to be<br />
something which, to use the vernacular, he knew he would be able to<br />
sell to the American people. Out of this idea grew at various times the<br />
Atlantic Charter, the Mutual Aid Agreement, and the Lend-Lease<br />
Agreement. I. am able to realize the very difficult position in which<br />
Britain was situated and in which Mr. Churchill, the then British<br />
leader, found himself in fighting for the preservation of his country.<br />
Unless Britain and the Dominions had been able to obtain large quantities<br />
of arms and goods from the United States and to take advantage<br />
of the great industrial, financial, and man-power resources of that<br />
country, it is very doubtful whether we could have won the war.<br />
Civilization itself might have been destroyed. The Atlantic Charter,<br />
the Mutual Aid Agreement, the Lend-Lease Agreement and Article<br />
VII. of the trade charter, all arose in the first place from discussions<br />
between President Roosevelt, one of the great men of history, and Mr.<br />
-Churchill. " I do not believe that Mr. -Churchill was ever anxious to have<br />
included in Article VII. any proposals for revision of tariffs.. He<br />
knew that the United States had always looked with strong disfavour<br />
on Imperial preferences, and he knew also that Canada had never been<br />
keen on -contractual Imperial preference obligations. I think I may<br />
thus interpret the utterances of the Prime Minister of Canada, who<br />
has been the leader of that country for a l-ong time, without committing<br />
a political libel. I do not say that he did not believe in some sort of<br />
preference, but it is evident that he has never been enthusiastic about<br />
being bound by contractual obligations.<br />
" President Roosevelt had great political problems in his own<br />
country at that time. For a long time, the policy of a great majority<br />
of the people of the U nited States had been to, ' keep out of Europe<br />
not to engage in any conflict on that continent, either militarily or<br />
otherwise. Therefore, President Roosevelt had to offer to his people<br />
something in return for what was one of the most generous gestures<br />
in history-the provisions of the Lend-tease Agreement and the Mutual<br />
Aid Agreement. On the other side of the bargain, we had a great<br />
leader in Mr. Churchill, who realized the desperate straits of his<br />
country. Re knew that Britain had been selling its foreign securities<br />
to obtain credits, and that this reserve was becoming rapidly depleted. </p>
<p>32<br />
Indeed, Britain had to make its purchases abroad on a cash-and-carry<br />
basis. Mr. Churchill knew that if this situation continued there could.<br />
be only one end-that Britain could not carry on the war. It was very<br />
doubtful at that time whether 60 per cent. of the American people were<br />
in favour of participation in a European conflict. Confronted with<br />
these tremendous problems, Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt agreed to<br />
insert into the Lend-Lease Agreement the conditions contained in<br />
Article VII. which provided that consideration was to be given after the<br />
war to a general reduction of tariff barriers. No doubt Mr. Churchill.<br />
agreed to that provision reluctantly. At that time Australia was in a<br />
most desperate position, and it had no alternative but to join in the<br />
undertaking given to the United States by Britain. At that time<br />
Britain could not help us because physically it was incapable of doing<br />
so, and it was only because of the volume of aid supplied by the United<br />
States in the form of personnel, aircraft, equipment and services that<br />
Australia was not invaded.<br />
" In the circumstances prevailing at the time the action taken by the<br />
Australian Government was completely justified. Of course, if the<br />
matter had been left to us, we should not have initiated a conference<br />
to discuss the reduction of world tariff barriers, but, as I said<br />
previously, we were bound by a contractual obligation. Moreover,<br />
other factors entered into the matter. Britain desperately needed a<br />
reduction of world trade barriers if its economy were to survive in the<br />
aftermath of war. The Australian Government realized fully the<br />
position of Britain, and because of that, and because of our. contractual<br />
obligation-or, should I say, moral obligation-we agreed to the provisions<br />
of Article VII. of the Lend-Lease Agreement. In any event, the<br />
point of view of some of the other Dominions were opposed to ours.<br />
Canada, for example, was most anxious that a conference to discuss<br />
Empire trade preference should be convened. At that time, responsiblepeople<br />
in Britain, irrespective of their political beliefs, did not believe<br />
that Britain could survive economically after the war unless it could<br />
export more goods into dollar areas; tariff barriers would have to be<br />
lowered to enable it to export to countries outside the Empire so as to<br />
compensate for the loss of its investments. It must be realized that<br />
during the war Britain lost a large number of its overseas investments,<br />
and was importing 50 per cent. of its imports from ' hard' currency,<br />
or dollar, areas. Furthermore, I think that members of the British<br />
Government believe that unless Britain received something similar<br />
to the American loan, which was later granted to it, it would not be<br />
possible to maintain even the lowered standard of living endured by<br />
its people during the war. At that time, it was idle to speculate on<br />
what Canada or South Africa might do after the war; the plain<br />
fact was that unless Britain was to receive a loan such as that made to,<br />
it later, its position would be unthinkable. The terms of the American<br />
loan were not ungenerous. Certainly, they contained provisions with<br />
regard to ' non-discrimination', but it must be remembered that the<br />
President, the Government of the United States and particularly the<br />
.1:<br />
' K1 </p>
<p>33<br />
Department of State, had to ' sell the Anglo-American loan to the<br />
American Congress. That loan had also to be approved by the United<br />
States Senate; approval which could not easily be obtained.<br />
" Had that legislation not been passed, I dread to think of the<br />
position in which Britain would be placed to-day, more so when one<br />
remembers the tremendous task of rehabilitation wvhich confronts that<br />
country, and, indeed, the whole of Europe. I go further, and without<br />
wishing to arouse any panic or unnecessary anxiety, I say that if the<br />
legislation to implement the Marshall aid plans' is not enacted the<br />
economic position of Britain will be most difficult before the end of the<br />
present year.<br />
" Australia participated in the International Conference on Trade<br />
and Employment for three main reasons. In the first place, we were<br />
morally obliged to do so because of Article VII. of the Lend-Lease Agreement,<br />
* and in any event, we wanted the benefit of the favorable provisions<br />
of that article. Secondly, the British Government was convinced<br />
that an agreement, such as was eventually reached at the<br />
conference, was absolutely essential to its economic existence, and<br />
finally we had our own privileges to preserve.<br />
I pay tribute to the members of the delegation which represented<br />
Australia at that conference. I am convinced that our representatives<br />
accomplished something really worth while, something at least comparable<br />
with the achievement of the British delegation. It was no easy<br />
task to assist the United States Government to convince its people<br />
that it was justified in doing things for other countries. Australia<br />
has suffered no, real loss as a result of the agreements or the tariff<br />
schedules that will be discussed later. It has played its part in world<br />
affairs and has contributed to the assistance of Britain.<br />
The fact of the matter is that American production to-d-ay is<br />
enormous; it amounts, I understand, to 55 per cent. of the total<br />
secondary production of the world. Because the United States sold<br />
three times as much as it bought, the dollars with which to purchase<br />
the goods it produces are not possessed by other countries. We may<br />
talk of our personal problems, hut it should be realized that the future<br />
welfare' of the masses of the people of this and other countries is to<br />
a large extent wrapped up in the solution of this world economic<br />
problem. Australia can play -only a small part; it can only show<br />
complete willingness to do all it can do to help. It is -all very well<br />
to scoff at theorists and idealists, but many ideas of great benefit to<br />
the world were conceived by people with ideal.<br />
The fact that there seems to be an almost insurmountable barrier<br />
to overcome is no reason why those who lead nations should not attempt<br />
to surmount it. I realize the present situation of Britain probably<br />
as well as any one in Australia, and I know the extent of the economic<br />
i[: ssistance that is needed from * thE. United States. I have an appreciation<br />
of the great difficulties confronting those who govern the rnited<br />
Sotates, which is a country in which there are many conflicting interests<br />
and many pressure groups. Human nature being what it is, there is </p>
<p>f<br />
i 34<br />
much difficulty in obtaining approval to measures such as the Anglo-<br />
American loan agreement and the Marshall plan. In this world one<br />
cannot take all and give nothing. We have not given very much<br />
materially, although we have contributed a great deal through the<br />
industry and ability of our representatives at international<br />
conferences." NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.<br />
VICE-CHANCELLOR.<br />
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Cabinet to-day approved of the recommendation of the Interim<br />
Council of the Australian National University that the Australian<br />
Minister to China ( Professor D. B. Copland) be appointed Vice-Chancellor<br />
for a period of five years. The appointment is considered<br />
urgent as Sir Howard Florey, Professor M. Oliphant, Professor W. K.<br />
Hancock and Professor R. Firth, who, it is hoped, will be the directors<br />
of the John Curtin School of Medical Research and of the Research<br />
Schools of Physics, Social Sciences and Pacific Studies respectively,<br />
will be in Australia in March, 1948, to confer with the Interim<br />
Council and the Vice-Chancellor with respect to the establishment of<br />
the Research Schools." WHEAT POOLS PAYMENTS.<br />
No. 10 POOL-FOURTH ADVANCE.<br />
On 2nd March, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br />
announced that a fourth advance of Is. a bushel on bulk wheat and<br />
Is. 3d. a bag on bagged had been approved on 1946-47 crop wheat<br />
in No. 10 Pool. The advance brought the payments in the pool to<br />
7s. 7d. a bushel less freight for bulk wheat and 8s. Id. a bushel less<br />
freight for bagged wheat. SHIPBUILDING.<br />
DIESEL ENGINES.<br />
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" The Commonwealth Government marine engine works at Port<br />
Melbourne ( Victoria) and Brisbane ( Queensland) were set up during<br />
the war under the Australian Shipbuilding Board for the construction<br />
of marine steam engines. Recently the Minister for Munitions<br />
(. Senator Armstrong) approved of the two works being placed under<br />
the General Manager of the Government Ordnance Factories so that<br />
they might have access to a wider range of manufactures, including<br />
the construction of diesel engines.<br />
Cabinet to-day approved of the Department of Munitions, in<br />
consultation with the Australian . Shipbuilding Board, undertaking<br />
immediately the construction of six 3,000 horse-power marine diesel<br />
engines, of which two are required in 1949 and the remainder at<br />
intervals as may be required by the Board. A sum of Å 750,000 will<br />
be allocated for the purpose. The Munitions Department will open </p>
<p>negotiations for the purchase of manufacturing information and use<br />
of the patents of William Doxford and Sons Limited, of Sunderland,<br />
England. The Munitions Department, in conjunction with the Board, will<br />
arrange for the manufacture of standardized auxiliary machinery at a<br />
value of Å 250,000. Auxiliary machinery includes small power plants<br />
for lighting and ventilating, winches and hoists, steering gear, pumps<br />
and the like." AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.<br />
AWARDS FOR GALLANTRY.<br />
On 5th March, 1948, the Governor-General announced the following<br />
awards:-Associate of the Royal Red Gross-Lieutenants K. 1. A. Parker<br />
and M. J. Anderson.<br />
INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.<br />
On 7th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" For some weeks past, a special meeting of the International<br />
Wheat Council has been engaged at Washington in the negotiation of<br />
an International Wheat Agreement and advice has now been received<br />
from the Australian representative that agreement has jbeen reached<br />
among the partic ipating countries for submission to governments. The<br />
main proposals of the agreement are-<br />
" The agreement will he for five years commencing from 1st August,<br />
1948. The range of prices will he from a maximum of two dollars a<br />
bushel to a minimum of one dollar ten cent in ' the fifth year of the<br />
agreement. The minimum in the first year will he one dollar fifty<br />
cents, the second year one dollar forty cents, the third year one dollar<br />
thirty cents, and the fourth year one dollar twenty cents. All prices are<br />
on the basis of in store Fort William, Canada.<br />
" Sales will be made between the maximum of two dollars, which<br />
will operate for the whole of the agreement, and the minimumn applying<br />
to each particular year. The Australian equivalents will vary<br />
according to freight rates and whether sales from Australia are made<br />
to nearby or distant markets.<br />
" Under present conditions it is estimated that the Australian<br />
equivalents are: maximum lie. 6d. to 12s. a bushel and minimum<br />
from 6s. to 6s. 6d. a bushel in the last year of the agreement.<br />
" The total quantities covered in the agreement are 500,000,000<br />
bushels per annum, of which Australia's share will be 85,000,000<br />
bushels annually; the other participating exporters being Canada and<br />
the United States with shares of 230,000,00% and 185,000,000 bushels<br />
respectively. Importing countries represented at the conference<br />
numbered 33 and included Britain, India, France, Belgium, the<br />
Netherlands and China. </p>
<p>36<br />
Any wheat which exporters can make available above their share<br />
Sof the 500,000,000 bushels can be sold outside the agreement at any<br />
price which they can obtain on the market.<br />
" The proposals will be placed before the Commonwealth Government<br />
for approval at a very early date, as my information is to the<br />
effect that several of the major importing countries, including Britain,<br />
have already intimated that their governments have agreed and will sign<br />
j the agreement immediately, while other delegates have recommended<br />
acceptance of the agreement to their governments.<br />
When it comes into operation the agreement will assure stability<br />
to wheat-growers for five years ahead."<br />
On 16th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that the Australian Ambassador at<br />
Washington be ' authorized to notify approval of the International<br />
Wheat Agreement, subject to ratification by the Commonwealth Government."<br />
CIVIL AVIATION.<br />
AELO-A'UTICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL.<br />
On 9th March, 194S, the Minister in charge of Scientific and Industrial<br />
Research ( Mr. Dedman) announced that an Aeronautical<br />
Research Conference, attended by representatives of the British Commonwealth,<br />
would be held in Australia in April, 1948. The conference<br />
would be the first formal meeting of the British Commonwealth<br />
Advisory Aeronautical Research Council which was set up by Britain<br />
and the various Dominion Governments following a meeting of aeronautical<br />
research workers at London in 1946. The council would<br />
co-ordinate research programmes throughout the British Commonwealth<br />
and plan collaborative programmes. It would act as a central<br />
liaison agency for the dissemination of scientific information on aeronautics,<br />
and the interchange and secondment of scientific staff. The<br />
Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at Sydney University ( Professor<br />
A. V. Stephens) would be chairman of the conference. The<br />
Australian delegates would be-<br />
The Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance of the R. A. A. F. ( Air<br />
Vice-Marshal E. C. Wackett), 3Mr. MI. B. Wnodlfill, of thie Division of Aircraft<br />
Production, the Chief of thie Division of Aero mautics of the Comncil for Scientific<br />
and Industrial Research ( Mr. L. IP. Coombesi.<br />
AERO CLUBS.<br />
On 16th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
In November, 1945, Cabinet approved assistance to aero clubs<br />
b. ubject to review after twelve months' operations.<br />
Cabinet to-day approved of recommendations for assistance for a<br />
period of four years and five months from February 1, 1947, to June<br />
1951, on terms and conditions to be determined by Mr. Drakeford<br />
and to be based generally on conditions originally -approved by<br />
Cabinet.".<br />
i. </p>
<p>37<br />
On 23rd March, 1948, the Minister for Civil Aviation ( Mr.<br />
Drakeford) announced details of increased subsidies to aero clubs.<br />
The scheme would operate from February, 1947, to June, 1951, and<br />
would cost Å 40,000 a year. It was designed to subsidize clubs at a rate<br />
of Å 1 14s. 6d. for every hour flown. That would be achieved as<br />
follows MlAINT1ENAZNcE GRAN-.-Increase from los. to Å 1 anll our for each hour flown.<br />
Previous limit of 200 hours an aircraft was removed, but there would be safeguards<br />
to prevent individual club members from enjoying unlimited pleasure<br />
flying at government expense. For flying away from home base, clubs would<br />
receive 30s. an hour South Australian and Tasmanian clubs would receive<br />
an hour for all flying until 30th June, 1948.<br />
Issua BoNus.-For each new pupil trained to " All licence standard, the<br />
bonus would he increased from Å 50 to For pupils trained in country<br />
centres ( away from base) thre bonus would be raised from Å 60 to Å 90.<br />
B RENEWVAL BoNus.-For each licence renewed an club aircraft, the renewal<br />
bonus would be unchangaed at Å 10 for home base flying and Å 12 109. away from<br />
home base.<br />
RESERVE FOR BRPLACM[ ENT OF AxacmRrF.-The Government would accept a<br />
contingent liability to contribute at the rate of 10s. an hour towards the cost<br />
of replacement aircraft. Clubs would be required to build uip funds for thst<br />
: 1 purpose. ( ror earlier reference, please see No. 108, page 51.)<br />
COMMONWEALTH BANK.<br />
POLICY-ADVANCES.<br />
In Parlia-ment-On 10th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br />
N Chifley) said-<br />
" The need to restrict the activities of non-essential enterprises must<br />
be apparent. In view of the shortage of labour and materials, it would<br />
hardly be proper to permit the erection of unnecessary structures such<br />
as picture theatres and amusement parks, thus diverting building<br />
materials from more undertakings such as housing. Actually there has<br />
been a substantial increase of bank advances in this country, as I shall<br />
show later by quoting figures. Let me first make this point clear: The<br />
instructions relating to advance policy have been issued at the instance<br />
of the Commonwealth Bank, but I say at once that they have the<br />
endorsement of the Government.<br />
" Cabinet does not interfere with the policy of the Commonwealth<br />
Bank. When the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank put the posituated<br />
by excessive advances, I, as Treasurer, intimated on behalf of<br />
teGovernment that I endorsed the proposal. I say that the instructios<br />
wreissued with the full approval of the Governor of the CommonwalthBank;<br />
that they were discussed with him; and that on<br />
behalf of the Government I agreed with the bank's decision. With<br />
more than 200,000 people required to do essential work throughout<br />
this country, it would be highly undesirable for the Commonwealth<br />
Bank, through the private banks, to facilitate the expenditure of large<br />
sums of money on non-essential enterprises. The aim of the instructions<br />
is to ensure that the increased money being made available in<br />
bank advances shall be directed into -channels which will provide the<br />
greatest benefit to the community. </p>
<p>NT ~ 38<br />
" The fact is that general advances have increased from<br />
Å 200,000,000 to Å 320,000,000 in two and a half years. Since June,<br />
1946, about nineteen months ago, the total has increased by<br />
Å 113,000,000. I emphasize that many trading companies want to carry<br />
on their businesses on bank advances instead of going to the public<br />
and getting the capital necessary for expansion. This is because interest<br />
rates are much lower than they were, and because companies<br />
can secure bank advances more cheaply than they can raise funds in<br />
other ways. There has been a tendency on the part of many firms<br />
to use bank advances even for the purpose of financing capital expenditure,<br />
which ought to be financed by calling up capital from the great<br />
amount of surplus money which is available in the community. There<br />
can be no question that there is an inflationary spiral, not a deflationary<br />
spiral, in the community.<br />
" There has been a great and expanding spiral of advances in this<br />
country. There can he only one ultimate result to such a process if the<br />
money is used for purposes other than the legitimate expansion of<br />
production. An increasing amount of new credit is being made available.<br />
Whether it is made available by the Commonwealth Bank or<br />
by private banks does not matter; the effect with the community is<br />
precisely the same. The instructions were issued in the belief that<br />
the most disastrous thing that could happen to Australia to-day would<br />
he an inflation such as is occurring, in other countries. Inflation is<br />
almost as bad as deflation, because finally it brings about an economic<br />
collapse. Unless the national bank of any country exercises some<br />
control in periods of inflationary trends as well as in periods of deflationary<br />
trends, it does not do justice to the community. It must<br />
take steps to ensure that any unduly inflationary or deflationary movement<br />
is corrected.<br />
The Opposition cannot have it both ways by saying on one day<br />
that there should not be political interference with the banks and then,<br />
on another day, saying that directions as to the administrative policy<br />
of the Commonwealth Bank should come from this Parliament.<br />
The national income for 1947-48 is estimated at Å 200,000,000<br />
more than for 1946-47. The gross value of rural production is estimated<br />
this year at Å 537,000,000, an increase of Å 157,000,000 over the<br />
total of 1946-47. I need not go into details of wage earnings, hilt<br />
their rate is 20 per cent. above the rate for 1945-46. By the end of<br />
IDecember, 1948, it is likely to be 35 per cent. above the rate for 1945-46.<br />
Export prices in December, 1947, were 200 per cent. above the average<br />
level for the period 1936-39. There has been an increase of 44 per<br />
cent, since December, 1946. Wool prices in January, 1948, were 220<br />
per cent. above the 1936-39 level and were even 79 per cent. above the<br />
level which prevailed in January, 1947. Wheat prices in January,<br />
1948, were 400 per cent, above the 1936-39 level and were 94 per cent.<br />
above the January, 1947, level.<br />
" These facts prove that a vast accumulation of money is flowing<br />
into the community. Whether this money comes in the form of wages,<br />
ieturns to wheat-rowers, or in other ways, it is clear that a great </p>
<p>number of. people in the community, instead of engaging in further<br />
speculative business, should be paying off some of the advances, made to<br />
them when there was not so much ready money available in the cornmunity<br />
as there is now. What we are faced with in Australia now is<br />
the opposite of deflation. That is proved by the fact that bank advances<br />
haeincreased by atotal of Å 200,000,000 in two and ahalf<br />
years. As I have often said, control of the Commonwealth Bank, or of<br />
any national bank, subject to over-all government policy, must be exercised<br />
to a fair degree by those persons who are responsible for its<br />
functions. They are in possession of the facts and figures necessary<br />
.1 for their guidance. I have cited some of those figures to-day, and I<br />
consider that what has been done by the bank is very wise in the light<br />
of existing economic circumstances."<br />

On 16th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The Bureau of Mineral Resources -has carried out investigations<br />
for some time of beach sands along the coasts of northern New South<br />
Wales and -southern Queensland to assess their value as a potential<br />
source of radio-active minerals. Several companies have been engaged<br />
in processing the sands.<br />
" Cabinet decided to-day that the bureau be authorized to carry<br />
out expenditure to conserve thorium-bearing minerals."<br />
MIGRATION.<br />
ALLIED SERVICEMEN, ASSISTED PAS-SAGES.<br />
On 16th March, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)<br />
said-Ex-service personnel, with their dependants, who served during<br />
World War II. in the armed forces or merchant navies or resistande<br />
movements of Holland, Belgium, France, Norway and Denmark will<br />
subject to the usual immigration -requirements and security checks, be<br />
eligible for assisted passages. Nationals of Holland, Belgium, France,<br />
Nor-way and Denmark, with their dependants, who served during<br />
World War II. in the armed forces or merchant navies of British<br />
Empire countries or the United States will be included.<br />
Under the scheme, the Commonwealth Government will contributeup<br />
to 40 per cent. of the tourist class fare or Å stg. 30 towards the cost </p>
<p>of the fares of adult migrants and amounts ranging from 45 to 100 per<br />
cent. ( with a minimum of Å 17 10s. and a maximum -of E35) towards<br />
the fares of dependent children."<br />
GOVERNMENT POLICY-ITALY, ROUMANIA, BULGARIA,<br />
IHUNGARY.<br />
On 24th March, 1948, Mr. Calwell announced that, following the<br />
ratification of peace treaties with Italy, Roumania, Bulgaria and Rungary,<br />
it had been decided to modify the policy governing the entry of<br />
nationals of those countries into Australia. At present, only persons<br />
who were the wives, unmarried daughters or minor unmarried sons of<br />
residents of Australia were eligible for admission. Under the modified<br />
policy, Italians, Roumanians, Bulgarians and Hungarians might be<br />
admitted if skilled in undernamed trades or professions, or suited for<br />
and would engage in occupations in which there was a definite shortage<br />
of labour, and came within certain age limits. A system of priorities<br />
would operate-<br />
Persons classed as essential workers, nominated and to be found accommodation<br />
by residents in Australia.<br />
Persons nominated find to be found accommodation by Australian residents,<br />
and to engage in employment which was undermanned.<br />
Single persons without noiiators in Australia, who would engage in<br />
essential employment and for whom accommodation could readily be found.<br />
Certain preferences would apply within the priorities. First preference<br />
would go to migrants who were suited for, and engage in,<br />
rural work such as farm labourers, cane cutters, timber cutters.<br />
Second preference would be granted to those who would be employed in<br />
occupations which would help to relieve the housing shortage such<br />
as the production of building materials and housing construction<br />
projects. Third preference would go to those who would engage in<br />
work connected with national undertakings in rural districts such as<br />
water conservation, electricity projects, road and rail construction.<br />
It would be a condition of admission in every case that the migrant<br />
would engage in the class of work for which he was nominated and<br />
would remain in the dietrict to w~ hich -he was assigned for two years.<br />
At the end of that period, those who proved themselves satisfactory<br />
migrants would be allowed to remain permanently. Any who did not<br />
observe the conditions would be liable to summary deportation.<br />
* DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY AND SHIPPING.<br />
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.<br />
On 16th March, 1913, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" The Supply and Development Act of 1939 constituted the Department<br />
of Supply and Development, its functions being the provision or<br />
supply of munitions; the manufacture or assembly of aircraft or<br />
parts thereof; extension of industries for purposes of defence;<br />
acquisition, maintenance and disposal -of stocks of goods in connexion<br />
with defence; and surveys of Australian industrial capacity and the </p>
<p>investigation and development of Australian sources of supply of goods<br />
necessary for the economic security of the Commonwealth in time of<br />
war. " In 1940, munitions and aircraft production activities were transferred<br />
by National Security ( Munitions) Regulations to a new Department<br />
of Munitions. In 1942, the shipping and associated functions of<br />
the Departments of Labour * and National Service, Commerce and<br />
Agriculture, and Trade and Customs were transferred to the Department<br />
of Supply and Development, the title being altered to that of<br />
Supply and Shipping.<br />
" Cabinet decidcd to-day that legislation be prepared -to amend the<br />
Supply and Development Act to repeal the National Security<br />
( Munitions) Regulations, the effect being to restore the Supply w~<br />
Development ' Act to the position it originally held in 1939."<br />
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.<br />
AWARDS FOR GALLANTRY.<br />
On 17th March, 1943, the Governor-General announced the award<br />
of the Distinguished Service Order to Air Vice-Marshal W. D. Bostock.<br />
NATIONALITY,<br />
UNIFORMITY-PROPOSED LEGISLATION.<br />
On 18th March, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)<br />
announced that legislation would be prepared to confer on Australians<br />
the status of Australian citizenship in addition to, and not as distinct<br />
from, the general status of British subject. The British Government<br />
had introduced the British Nationality Bill in February, 1948, givingeffect<br />
to the principle that the people of each of the self-governing<br />
countries within the British Commonwealth should have both a<br />
particular status as citizens of their own country and a common status<br />
as members of the wider association of peoples comprising the Commonwealth.<br />
In 1946, the Canadian Government had enacted legislation<br />
which came into operation on 1st January, 1947, to provide for the<br />
grant of Canadian citizenship, combined with the maintenance of the<br />
status of British subject. NEW ZEALAND.<br />
VISIT OF NEW ZEALAIND GOVERNOR-GENERAL.<br />
On. 19th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" I have extended an invitation, through the Governor-General ( Mr-<br />
Mc~ ell), to the Prime Minister of New Zealand ( Mr. Fraser) for the<br />
Governor-General of New Zealand ( General Sir Bernard Frayberg,<br />
to visit Australia later this year </p>
<p>42<br />
PRICES.<br />
GOODS " DECLARED "-SERVICES, REVOCATION.<br />
On 19th March, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)<br />
announced that services supplied or carried on by certain nonproprietary<br />
organizations not conducted for private gain had been<br />
removed from price control. These were-<br />
Services supplied or carried on by a society or association, not being a society<br />
or association carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to the individual<br />
members thereof:-<br />
Registered under the law of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth<br />
relating to friendly societies;<br />
Being a trade union or an association of employers or employees<br />
registered under any Act of the Commonwealth or a State or any<br />
O rdinance of a Territory of the Commonwealth relating to the settlement<br />
of industrial disputes;<br />
Established to promote the development of aviation or of the agricultural<br />
or viticultural or industrial resources of Australia;<br />
Established for musical purposes, or for the encouragement of music,<br />
art or literature;<br />
Established for the purposes of any athletic game or sport, or for the<br />
encouragement or control of any athletic game or sport.<br />
One effcect of the decision would be to remove from control admission<br />
charges to many sporting events, musical shows and other entertainment<br />
and functions but would apply only to events conducted purely for the<br />
encouragement or control of the sport or art. Charges for boxing<br />
matches, cinema and theatrical shows and horse, dog and motor racing,<br />
if run for commercial gain, would still be subject to control.<br />
PALESTI NE.<br />
UNITED NATIONS DECISION-MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br />
On 22nd March, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br />
Evatt) said-<br />
" Decision of a competent international conference should be<br />
accepted after there has been full inquiry and fair debate and a just<br />
settlement has been reached. Accordingly, any setting aside of the<br />
United Nations Assembly decision on Palestine must be closely<br />
scrutinized. It is impossible to examine the new plan in detail because nothing<br />
definite is known about it. It is said that trusteeship will be the new<br />
solution. But the word itself is ambiguous. What does it mean?<br />
It certainly seems to imply that the peoples to be placed under trusteeship<br />
are not sufficiently advanced for self-government. Such a<br />
suggestion would seem to be untenable in relation either to the<br />
Palestinian Arabs or to the Palestinian Jews.<br />
If, however, what is now proposed is a temporary United Nations<br />
trusteeship merely to carry out the Assembly's decisions, it would be a<br />
very different matter. But is that intended?<br />
" The final decision was reached in December, 1947, after two<br />
General Assemblies had dealt most carefully and exhaustively with the<br />
Y matter, after all parties were heard, and after a special commission </p>
<p>43<br />
involving very heavy United Nations expenditure had visited Palestine<br />
and reported in favour of the principle of the plan ultimately adopted in<br />
the Assembly. The plan adopted is inappropriately labelled partition'<br />
because it involves four separate points: first, economic union of the<br />
whole of Palestine under the control of an authority with a majority<br />
of ' United Nations membership; second, political division of Palestine<br />
into two new States, Jewish and Arab; third, United Nations trusteeship<br />
over Jerusalem and Bethlehem; fourth, four safeguards for the<br />
holy places and especially for the Christian churches throughout -the<br />
whole of Palestine.<br />
" The only alternative plan suggested to the Assembly was to<br />
establish a unitary State under Arab domination with no a dequat<br />
safeguards for the protection either of the Jewish peoples or of th'.<br />
Jewish churches. This alternative was plainly inadmissible and was<br />
rejected by an overwhelming majority. The United Nations decision<br />
was reached by more than a two-thirds majority, the only dissentients<br />
being the Arab States and certain nations very closely associated with<br />
them. The decision was just and impartial and must not be lightly set<br />
aside. The United Nations did not intermeddle in the Palestine matter.<br />
It intervened only after the British Government had specially requested<br />
the United Nations Assembly to handle the matter as all previous efforts<br />
at reconciliation between the Arabs and Jews had entirely failed. At<br />
the United Nations, the British Government did not itself propose any<br />
solution and announced it would accept the United Nations decision.<br />
In the circumstances, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New<br />
Zealand all supported the proposal finally adopted. After all that has<br />
occurred, to throxv the solution into the melting pot again may be very<br />
damaging to the authority of the United Nations.<br />
It has been contended that the enforcement of the Assembly's<br />
decision is not possible. Had the great powers who supported the proposal<br />
at Lake Success, New York, adhered firmly to it, there probably<br />
would have been little difficulty. In any event, under the Assembly's<br />
decision, the new Jewish State and the new Arab States were each to be<br />
entitled to establish its own militia forces for the defence of the new<br />
territories, and this decision clearly carried with it the right of Jews<br />
as well as Arabs to import arms and equipment for the purposes of<br />
defence. It is impossible to pass final judgment on the new proposal because<br />
no one has explained it as yet.<br />
I was chairman of the committee which worked assiduously to<br />
obtain a just solution. The committee repeatedly modified its proposals<br />
at the suggestion of the mandatory power in order that Britain should<br />
be able to withdraw its forces after its long, its thankless, but on the<br />
whole successful development of the Palestine area since it was captured<br />
from the Turks by British and Australian forces in 1918. </p>
<p>44<br />
" In my opinion, the United Nations decision has been graduallyundermined<br />
by intrigues directed against the Jewish people. It would<br />
be little short of a tragedy if the fundamental right of self-government<br />
were to be denied to the Jews and Arabs, as it is guaranteed to them.<br />
under the Assembly decision just as religious freedom is also guaranteed<br />
td the Christian Church throughout Palestine.<br />
The only considerations that influenced the United Nations<br />
Assembly were those of justice and fair dealing to all concerned. It<br />
would be most disturbing if mere consideration of power politics orexpediency<br />
were allowed to detroy the decision. However, if a special<br />
-United Nations Assembly is called, it is hardly likely to accept any new<br />
? Ian which involved a repudiation of the previous decision, unless new<br />
facts of overwhelming cogency are proved to exist. I need hardly add'<br />
that, under the United Nations Charter, the Security Council seem's to<br />
have no power whatever to overrule the recommendation of the-<br />
Assembly ( For earlier reference, please see No. 130, page 37.)<br />
