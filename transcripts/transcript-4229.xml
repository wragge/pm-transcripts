FOR PRESS SEPTEMBER 17, 1976<br />

NEW SOUTH WALES LIBERAL PARTY CONVENTION<br />
This last year has been an epic year for the Liberal Party..<br />
The New South Wales Party made a major contribution to the<br />
victory in the Federal election.<br />
One of the great qualities of the Liberal Party, which has been<br />
demonstrated again and again in both state and federal politics,<br />
is its capacity for regeneration for the rekindling<br />
of enthusiasm for its rededication to the ideals for which<br />
the Party stands.<br />
I have no doubt that the Liberal Party in New-South Wales<br />
will return to office with -renewed vigour after this period<br />
in'Opposition.<br />
In the Federal sphere the decision of the people last December<br />
marked a turning point in Australia's history.<br />
That decision of the Australian people placed an enormous<br />
responsibility on the Liberal Party both federal and state.<br />
For three years, the Labor Party had tried to impose its<br />
social. ist philosophy of Government domination and centralised<br />
power on Australia.<br />
As a result it was getting more and more difficult to find a<br />
job: prices were rising constantly: taxes getting higher<br />
and higher: government and bureaucracy growing bigger and bigger.<br />
Socialist incompetence and weekly scandals were ruining Australia.<br />
Big Government was exaggerated to the point of caricature and<br />
its costs became obvious to everyone. The consequences of Labor's<br />
view that they knew best how everyone should live their lives<br />
became more and more evident.. It could be seen in Labor' s<br />
authoritarian legislation; in their economic incompetence;<br />
in their attempts to evade the Constitution in the loans affair;<br />
in their attempt to govern without Parliamentary appropriation<br />
of money; in their attempt to breach the law and coerce the banks<br />
to provide funds illegally after the Parliament cut off money;<br />
and the attempt of Mr Whitlam and his friends to involve the<br />
Iraqi Government in an Australian election campaign.<br />
The decision of last November was a massive rejection of Labor's<br />
approach in Australia. </p>
<p>The Australian people recognised on 13th December that Australia<br />
needed a profound change of direction. Australia needed a<br />
government which believed that people deserved incentives to<br />
achieve their best in all areas of life, which would encourage<br />
productive private enterprise to provide jobs, which would give<br />
genuine assistance to the disadvantaged, which would protect people<br />
against every-rising taxes, and which would govern not by dogma<br />
but by consultation.<br />
Australia needed a government which would reverse the drift<br />
of power to Canberra.<br />
We undertook to provide that kind of Government.<br />
W~ e undertook to give Australia a government which respected the<br />
right of people to build thei~ r own lives without being told what<br />
to do by a few people who claimed to know what was good for<br />
everyone. In November last year, to achieve this objective, we placed<br />
before the Australian people one of ithe most far-reaching programmes<br />
ever proposed by a major party in Australia.<br />
This programme encompassed: major -reforms to the federal system<br />
a radical reassertion of the relevance of federalism.; tax reforms<br />
which would have a lasting effect on the whole system of<br />
government financing; a new approach to social security and<br />
welfare which stressed the importance of directing assistance<br />
to those in genuine need; one of the most detailed economic<br />
programmes ever put before the electorate to control Labor's<br />
inflation, revive private enterprise expand job opportunities,<br />
and get Australia moving forward again; a foreign policy and<br />
defence approach based on a realistic appreciation of Australia's<br />
security needs.<br />
This programme had two great merits. It reaffirmed the vitality<br />
of the Liberal Party's philosophy and it established the<br />
relevance of that philosophy to the needs of Australia.<br />
It was an entirely practic ' al programme.:' It was designed not only<br />
to revive the faith and confidence of people in Australia but<br />
also to create the conditions in which Labor would not again be<br />
able-to damage Australia as it had in the past.<br />
Our programm'e to restore a freer and more decent life for all.<br />
Australians was not one that could be implemented overnight.<br />
Success in the attack on inflation is essential. to the achievement<br />
of a number of important objectives, including a much more rapid<br />
expansion of job opportunities.<br />
The budget is not just an economic documrent-concerned with<br />
narrow economic objectives.<br />
It is an essential part of our social strategy to restore<br />
opportunity and economic growth in Australia. ./ 2A </p>
<p>2A.<br />
In the period since the federal election we have: brought<br />
Federal Government spending under control after two years of<br />
utterly irresponsible growth. and we have reduced the size of the<br />
Federal Public Service. Under guidelines now established the Public<br />
Service by June next year will be 26,000-less than. the levels<br />
projected under the Labor guidelines for 1975-76.<br />
These measures have made possible the major tax reforms which will<br />
have a lasting impact, a number of vital measures of assistance<br />
to industry and significant improvements in social security<br />
provision. They have made possible: the full indexation of personal income<br />
tax for inflation; a start to the introduction of trading stock<br />
valuation adjustments for business, at not less than 50% in this<br />
. year; increases in the retention allowance for private companies;<br />
the 40% investment allowance; tax deductions for oil and mineral<br />
exploration; removal of the crude oil levy and the phasing out of<br />
the coal export duty. .1/ 3 </p>
<p>We have also introduced a number of measures to aid rural<br />
industry including an increased reserve price for wool and<br />
an income equalisation deposit scheme.<br />
These measures would not have been possible if government<br />
spending had gone on at the same mnad pace as before.<br />
They are part of our programmes to shift resources away fromi<br />
government back to individuals and companies.<br />
There is growing evidence that the Government's policies are<br />
working. In the last six months national production has grown significantly<br />
after falling in the previous six months.<br />
Business spending on plant and equipment has picked up substantially.<br />
In the last half year businesses have proposed major investment<br />
projects . totalling almost $ 3 billion.<br />
Consumer spending revived in the June quarter after being very<br />
restrained in the previous three quarters.<br />
Exports have continued to grow to record levels.<br />
The time has come to put away the doubts about Australia's future.<br />
The budget strategy is receiving greater support from<br />
business and omuiythan any budget I can remember.<br />
There is surely a message here for business itself. This is the<br />
time to express that growing confidence in new plans to give<br />
further heart to recovery.<br />
There are still problems: inflation, while less, is still too<br />
high, unemployment is still too high.<br />
Let iie make a few comments on the unemployment situation.<br />
It is an appalling fact that at the time of the federal election<br />
last year private enterprise was employing no more people than it<br />
had been three years earlier, even though during that period the<br />
labour force had expanded by about 370,000.<br />
This was a direct result of the mismanagement of the labour years.<br />
It is because of our determination to secure a soundly based expansioe<br />
of job opportunities that we are pursuing the policies we have<br />
announced.<br />
Unfortunately, substantial reductions in unemployment always lag<br />
behind the recovery in output. A reduction in the number of<br />
job seekers is never one of the early signs of economic recovery.<br />
Initially, increased production is always generated mainly by a more<br />
intensive use of existing labour.<br />
What does tend to increase first is overtime and overtime in<br />
fact rose over 60% from last June to this June. </p>
<p>Not until existing capacity of both men and machines has picked<br />
up, does the demand for unemployed labour strengthen.<br />
There is another factor also to take into account: as job<br />
opportunities expand more people tend to come into the workforce<br />
in expectation of finding work. This is turn can lead to the<br />
number of people in jobs and the number out of work rising at the<br />
same time.<br />
For example, in America, where recovery has gone much further<br />
than in Australia unemployment increased in June and July.<br />
This occurrred because strong growth in employment in those<br />
months was more tha matched by growth in the workforce. Much<br />
of this was due to people re-entering the workforce.<br />
Wage restraint is a pre-requisit for maintaining the expansion<br />
of job opportunities.<br />
The level of real wages Jn 1974 rose by an amount equal to three years<br />
normal growth in productivity.<br />
Wage increases have also adversely affected our international<br />
competitiveness over the last five years, the U. S. rates of<br />
earnings have increased by 24%, in Australian currency'*: terms<br />
Australia's have increased by a frightening 83%.<br />
The resulting depressed share of national income going to businesses<br />
halted investment and destroyed jobs.<br />
That is why we have argued as we have in all three quarterly<br />
wage cases since we.-came to office.<br />
Those who argue for undue wage increases at present are simply<br />
arguing whether they know it or not for an increase in<br />
unemployment. Every wage increase granted today means that the<br />
chance of creating a new job tomorrow is diminished.<br />
The New South Wales Premier has made remarks which show no<br />
recognition of this fact. He has argued for maximum increases<br />
in wages on the one hand and for more jobs on the other.<br />
It should be remembered that since the election there, New South<br />
Wales which has only 36% of the Australian labour force, has<br />
accounted for 64% of the increase in Australia's unemployment.<br />
Of the 46., 000 people who have become unemployed in the last<br />
four months, 29', 000 are in New South Walesalone what a record<br />
for Mr Wran.<br />
If the N. S. W. Government intends to act to improve the employment<br />
situation, it should discard the socialist " dream" policies that<br />
Mr Whitlam pursued policies which created an economic<br />
nightmare. We all have responsibilities in overcoming inflation.<br />
Trade unions have a particular responsibility in the reduction<br />
of inflation and the creation of jobs.<br />
Union leaders who sanction political strikes are acting against<br />
the Australian community's interests in a sound and prosperous<br />
economy. </p>
<p>The Australian people are not going to be held to ransom by a<br />
few extreme left-wing militant union leaders. Our secret ballot<br />
legislation, already in force, will give rank and file members an<br />
opportunity to state their view.. Other industrial legislation<br />
is foreshadowed.<br />
Given that there is reasonable restraint in wage and salary<br />
demands unemployment can be brought down more rapidly.<br />
To ease the problems of finding work in the short term the<br />
Government is taking a number of measures and has others under<br />
consideration. We are looking at terms of refcrence for a far reaching enquiry<br />
into the Commonwealth Employment Service. The Government believes<br />
it is now time for the operation and procedures of the C. E. S. to<br />
be completely reviewed.<br />
The Goverment has received many reports of firms being unable to<br />
fill vacancies in areas of high unemployment. Clearly thc C. E. S.<br />
must be geared to help solve this problem in the best possible way.<br />
To assist those who cannot find suitable work where they live and<br />
who wish to move to where work is available we have announced a<br />
major scheme of relocation assistance.<br />
This is one of the most enlightened measures of unemployment<br />
assistance introduced anywhere. It is entirely voluntary.<br />
It is wider than the scheme we foreshadowed in our election<br />
programme last year. It is a new scheme which will take time to<br />
get into operation. The Government will be monitoring it closely<br />
tD see how the scheme is working.<br />
The Government has particular concern for the school leavers who<br />
will be looking for jobs in the coming months. Of the 230,000<br />
young persons who left school last year the great majority have<br />
now found jobs. But 12,7000 were still unemployed at the end of<br />
J uly.<br />
The Government w i1l shortly be announcing measuires to help<br />
school leavers who have been unemployed for some time.<br />
The difficulty a number of young people have found in getting jobs<br />
has greatly concerned the Government.<br />
Last week I annouinced that we were establis hina a<br />
Committee of Inquiry into Education an" Training. This Inquiry<br />
will consider a very broad range of miatters relating to education.<br />
Among these it will undertake the first major inquiry of its kind<br />
into the relationship between education and the labour market.<br />
In the course of its inquiry the Committee will examine both<br />
secondary and post secondary education. This of course looks to<br />
the medium and longer term.<br />
But oveirall our economic strategy is designed to achieve a<br />
reduction in unemployment by mid 1977, and it offers the best hope<br />
for a soundly based expansion of job opportunities.<br />
Bearing in mind the grevious state of the economy, some governments<br />
would be content to focus exclusively on economic issues.<br />
This Government has shown that it is possible to combine effective<br />
economic action with major reforms. </p>
<p>In November, we committed ourselves to protect spending on<br />
essential education programmes against inflation.<br />
Despite severe' budgetary restraints, we have increa~ sed -real<br />
spending on education and re-estab~ lished triennial education<br />
planning. WE! committed ourselves to making the most significant reform of<br />
federalism since federation. A reform-which would provide state and<br />
and federal governments with a sound basis of financial<br />
independence.<br />
We have begun to implement these reforms.<br />
State and local government will be given access to a percentage<br />
of personal income tax revenue.<br />
These reforms will achieve a devolution of power which will<br />
enable decisions affecting the citizen to be taken at an<br />
appropriate level.<br />
In our policy speech, we said that the weak, the poor, the<br />
unorganised, the people wanting to buy homes, had been fobbed<br />
off with words instead of real assistance.<br />
We have acted decisively in these areas.<br />
We committed ourselves to protecting the real value of pensions.<br />
We are introducing legislatioii to brotect Pensions. by adjusting<br />
them automatically half yearly in accordance with changes in the C. P. I<br />
We committed ourselves to helping the aged. We have acted by<br />
introducing a 3 year $ 225 million programme to provide homes for<br />
the aged.<br />
We committed ourselves to helping the disadvantaged in ways<br />
leaving them the greatest scope for independence. We have<br />
acted by introducing our family allowance scheme. This has been<br />
recognised as the single most important reform in the Australian<br />
social welfare system since federation.<br />
It ended a system which discriminated against the children of<br />
the poor, because their parents did not have sufficient taxable<br />
income to qualify for the children's tax rebate.<br />
Over 300,000 families and 800,000 children who were debarred wholly<br />
or partly from benefiting from the rebate system, are -now being<br />
assisted by the family allowance. It is of particular help to<br />
aborigines.<br />
The family allowance scheme does not add to bureaucratic overheads,<br />
and it places money in the hands of people.-<br />
it is a scheme which both assists the disadvantaged and increases<br />
their independence.<br />
We committed ourselves to further help in the housing area. / 7 </p>
<p>We have acted by initiating a housing voucher allowanice<br />
e.-zperiment. This experiment, if successful will<br />
provide a new mechanism to make welfare housing sensitive to the<br />
needs of the users rather than those of the planners. It recognises<br />
the principle supported by the Poverty Inquiry that assistance should<br />
be linked to the person, not the house.<br />
Beyond the welfare area we said that home ownership should be<br />
a national objective and we committed ourselves to introducing<br />
a new home savings grant system. We have introduced a home<br />
savings grant with more generous provisions than the ones we<br />
announced. We committed ourselves to retaining Medibank and making it more<br />
efficient. We have not only retained Medibank but extended its<br />
operation. It was necessary to introduce changes to Medibank<br />
because Medibank had to be paid for we are not trying to hide<br />
the fact that Medibank must be paid for.<br />
Under our Medibank proposals: health cover is universal everyone<br />
is included in comprehensive and high quality medical and health<br />
insurance, pensioners and those on the lowest incomes pay no levy,<br />
and there will be choice of medical health insurance.<br />
Medibank is now so good that the President of the Australian Labor<br />
Party rushed to become a member of Medibank Private. Under the<br />
Labor Party's scheme hie had to be a mnember of a private fund<br />
for similar benefits.<br />
When we said we would retain and improve Medibank -we meant it.<br />
The new scheme is so good the Victorian ALP even wants to become<br />
an agent.<br />
But there is a perfectly simple way for families to cover themselves<br />
and get high quality health care this is by paying the levy<br />
which has a ceiling on it: this requires no action.<br />
The Labor approach did not permit chioce the Labor Party and the<br />
opponents of our Medibank reforms want to impose uniformity on<br />
the Australian people to eliminate choice and impose their<br />
views on the people of Australia.<br />
In our term of office we have undertaken an active programme to<br />
expand opportunities and protect the disadvantaged. Our Government<br />
is a Government os social reform.<br />
we are increasing funds for education. We have restored triennial<br />
planning. We are reforming the federal system and giving the states greater<br />
financial independence.<br />
We are strengthening the capacities of local councils.<br />
We are retaining and improving Medibank.<br />
We are securing homes for the aged. </p>
<p>We are protccting the real value of the pension by automatic<br />
adj ustmnents.<br />
We have argued in the Arbitration Commission to protect those<br />
on lowest incomes.<br />
We have greatly increased assistance to handicapped persons.<br />
We have introduced the historic family allowance scheme.<br />
We are exploring a housing voucher allowance scheme.<br />
We have established a major new home savings grant scheme.<br />
We are setting a new course for Australia.<br />
We recognise that the strength of Australia is the initiative,<br />
the imagination, the enterprise of its citizens and that the<br />
role of the government is to expand the freedom and the<br />
opportunities for Australians not tie the nation up in<br />
bureaucratic regulation and government domination.<br />
We recognise that needed reforms do not have to mean massive<br />
new programmes of government spending we believe they should<br />
be reforms which protect and expand people's capacity to control<br />
their own lives without domination by others.<br />
We believe our philosophy of freedom and concern is in harmony<br />
with the real needs of Australia and will produce a better life<br />
for all Australians.<br />
We believe the vast majority of people want to work together to<br />
make Australia the great country it can be.<br />
What we have done so far is a beginning.<br />
Every effort needs to be made to get a broad public appreciation<br />
of the Government's policies.<br />
Now it is up to the Liberal Party and to every branch and<br />
every member of * the Party everywhere in Australia to show the<br />
vitality of Australian democracy and make Australia an example<br />
to the world. </p>
