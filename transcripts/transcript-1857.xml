VISIT TO, THE U. S. 1968<br />
WASHINGTCN<br />
EXCHA-NGE CF TCASTS BETWEEN PRESIDENT JOHNSON<br />
AND PRIME MINISTER GORTON IN STATE DINING ROOM<br />
OF WH-ITlE HOUSE 27 MAY 1968<br />
THE PRESID~ ENT<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Go: 2-ton, Secretary and Mrs. Katzenbach,<br />
Ambassador and Mrs. Wailer, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen: Mr. Prime Minister, I have a confession to make tonight...<br />
I have been talking quite privately to your wife. I hope and I believe this<br />
was not a violation of protocol. But I needed advice. Two years ago,<br />
your predecessor--our late and beloved friend, Harold Holt--made a<br />
promise to me. During our visit prior to the Manila Conference, in the<br />
cool of the evening over a mint julep, he very generously said that if<br />
things ever went wrong here in the United States, I would always have<br />
a political future in Australia. Mr. Prime Minister, I have been somewhat<br />
curious to know whether that might still be true.<br />
Bettina, as you know, Mr. Prime Minister, is a daughter<br />
of New England. She said, " Mr. President, you will always be welcome.<br />
But Australians are a lot like you Texans--you are never as bad as they<br />
say you are when they're mad and you are never as good as they say<br />
you are when they love you. Mr. Frime Minister, let me assure you<br />
tonight that I do not intend-I may reassess that a little later-I do not<br />
intend to stand for office in Canberra. This is a considerable sacrifice,<br />
since I can truthfully say there is no place outside my own native land<br />
where I really feel more at home.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Gorton, I hope that you will<br />
feel equally at home here in America and I hope that you will come to<br />
visit us often. Lady Bird and I are pleased and honoured that we should<br />
have this opportunity to be the first to welcome you to our country as Prime<br />
Minister. The friendship that joins our two countries is a vital force<br />
in the struggle to transform the world's hopes into tomorrow's realities.<br />
It is a partnership which grows stronger and deeper with the passage of<br />
time. It extends from trade and mutual defence to man's newest frontierthe<br />
exploration of outer space. Right now that partnership is being tested--<br />
tested in the hardest way that the ties between nations can be tested, and<br />
that is by the commitment of our men to combat. Tonight we are in a<br />
decisive phase of the struggle for peace and order in South East Asia.<br />
Talks have begun, but the other side is forcing the pace of battle; it is<br />
pouring men and supplies into South Vietnam at an unprecedented rate.<br />
Let me tell you this<br />
-in Paris we shall remain patient but firm in the quest for an<br />
honourable peace. Ambassador Vance will be here in the morning<br />
to report to me and the security council, and to report to you,<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, on the developments there. / 2 </p>
<p>-In Vietnam tonight your men and ours--and the gallant South<br />
Vietnamese, the South Koreans and the Thais who have fought<br />
so long for the right of self -determination--and all of our allieswill<br />
turn back this offensive.<br />
-In time;--and I pray it may be soon--the other side will turn<br />
from fantasy to reality; from violence to genuine peacemaking.<br />
I know there are some in Asia and elsewhere who are<br />
wondering tonight whether the United States will maintain its commitments<br />
in Asia; who are wondering tonight whether the strains of this struggle<br />
will lead us to withdraw and leave two-thirds of humanity to its fate<br />
without American assistance or American support. As you so well know,<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, with your years in political life, I cannot speak for<br />
my successor, but I can speak for myself, and the answer is no; we will<br />
not withdraw until there is an honourable peace. I do not think that my<br />
country will permit us to do otherwise.<br />
If you look back over the years since 1941, you will see<br />
how steady the performance of the American nation has been. We must<br />
put aside the Senate speeches that have been made and the debates that<br />
have gone on and you will see that from one Administration to anotherfrom<br />
Republican to Democrat--the United States of America and its<br />
people has steadily understood its interests in Asia and has acted on them.<br />
I deeply believe that this will be true in the future as it has in the past.<br />
All the energy and influence that I can command will be in that direction.<br />
I think, Mr. Prime Minister, it will be true for a very simple reason:<br />
every year that passes brings us closer to Asia and brings us closer<br />
really to the other regions of the world; closer in terms of military<br />
technology; closer in terms of communications; closer in economic ties;<br />
and closer in terms of simple human friendships.<br />
If I may depart, Mr. Prime Minister, I think you will be<br />
interested to know that this afternoon I saw a report that on the list of<br />
choices for R and R--rest and recreation--in Vietnam, Australia was the<br />
first choice of the American fighting man. I think you will also be pleased<br />
to know that of the thousands who have gone there, who have been taken into<br />
your homes, and they have been entertained as if they were their own sons,<br />
that so far as we have been able to ascertain, there has not been one, single<br />
misunderstanding or violation of your hospitality or your courtesy--and<br />
that is saying something of Vietnam fighting men who are on rest and<br />
recreation in Australia. In the years ahead, we hope that the new Asia that is being<br />
born will be increasingly organized to shape its own destiny. It should be<br />
able to do more for itself and rely less on the United States. But I have no<br />
doubt that there will be no return here to isolation. I have no doubt that<br />
America will remain the partner of Australia, and I have no doubt that<br />
Australia will continue to give leadership to the new Asia and the free<br />
Asia as far ahead as any of us can see. One of the comforting and pleasirg<br />
developments of the last few years has been to see the leadership that the<br />
Government of Australia has given to this huge population that makes up<br />
two-thirds of the world; that this little country, through its leaders, has<br />
gone out and met with them, visited with them, exchanged views with them,<br />
and let them know that we are one and that we are trying to build toward a<br />
better day where we can fight the enemies of hunger, disease and poverty<br />
that are rampant in that area. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, your presence tonight is proof that<br />
this partnership is still vital and still growing. We are so pleased that<br />
you could bring your Maine lady with you and join us on the boat last<br />
night and that we could find all the differences that we had and solve most<br />
of them before the dinner tonight. We think this visit of yours, so soon<br />
after you have taken over the responsibilities of the Prime Ministership,<br />
will be of great help to us and will endear you to this country.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, we hope that your visit here--and<br />
you will be visiting other parts of our country--will give you an insight<br />
into the affection that the American people hold for the Australian people.<br />
In sunshine and in sorrow, we have stood side by side. Alt hough Ed and<br />
Ann Clark found it so pleasant out there that they dared not take more<br />
than two years of it we are sending you some other Texans who we hope<br />
will be representative of this country and be concerned with the future of<br />
Australia. The young Ambassador said to me, Mr. Prime Minister,<br />
when I talked to him about two or three countries, " Why are we so high<br />
on Australia?" I said, " If I could be Ambassador--and I am not sure I<br />
can under the next Administration-if I could be, the one country that I<br />
would want to be Ambassador to is Australia. That is when he made<br />
his choice. That is when he decided he wanted to go to Australia.<br />
So, Mr. Prime Minister, we welcome you and your party.<br />
We know that our talks will be fruitful. We assure you of our continuing<br />
co-operation and friendship. We now ask you to join us in a toast to the<br />
great lady who symbolizes our common heritage.. Her Majesty, The<br />
Queen. PRIME MINISTER<br />
Mr. President, Mrs. Johnson, Members of the Diplomatic Corps.,<br />
Distinguished Guests:-I must first of all thank you, Sir, for extending such a..<br />
warm welcome to myself and to my Maine lady--that is spelled with an<br />
You know, Sir, you have spoken tonight of a number of matters<br />
which beset us today. But in doing so, you have mentioned other matters<br />
which beset us in the past and which you will remember because you came<br />
to Australia at the time when these things were threatening then.<br />
You went on missions over Papua and New Guinea in the<br />
defence of Australia at the time these things were threatening. I flew<br />
at that stage in company with pilots of the United States Air Force who<br />
had come to see what was threatening then did not prevail--and it did not<br />
prevail. These difficulties, these problems, are borne on me tonight<br />
more than they ever have been before, because I stand here in a historic<br />
residence and my mind goes back to the time when, for example, one<br />
former President sat here and mourned the loss of more Americans in<br />
conflict than have been lost in all the wars since between 1860 and 1865,<br />
and exercised will and exercised judgment in order to see that a nation<br />
due to become great did become great, and did not become split. I can<br />
imagine well--because you showed me today upstairs, the room in which<br />
this great man slept--what those five years or six years, however long<br />
it was that man sat there, beset not only by an enemy across the potomacand<br />
I am bound to say that I speak as a convinced confederate; at least<br />
/ 4<br />
I </p>
<p>I would have been then--but not only by an enemy across the potomac, but<br />
by the cooperheads inside the union, by the riots taking place in New York<br />
so that regiments had to be brought back from the army of the potomac<br />
to put it down by the vilification and attacks of Horace Greeley and the<br />
newspapers--and newspapers are now much the same as they were then--<br />
and through it all, because the end was an end that was good, he saw<br />
that whatever was required to be done was done, and it was. If it had not<br />
so been done, then there would not now be a United States of America.<br />
Things don't change that much. I know that at one subsequent<br />
stage, part of the house in which I stand apparently inadvertently caught<br />
fire. But that has, of course, nothing to do with Australia, Sir. I dare<br />
say that people responsible for it eventually finished up in Botany Bay as<br />
transportees. I don't think that I should, on this occasion--which is a<br />
happy and a festive occasion--for too long talk about matters that are too<br />
serioust I tried this morning to set forth what Australians think about<br />
what you are doing in the United States. When you speak of leadership<br />
that we give, we give that leadership, if we do, and we try to because we<br />
are protected and shielded by a gr. eater power. We will give greater<br />
leadership in the future because we will have in the past been protected<br />
and shielded by a greater power. * rhe coat of arms of my own country,<br />
Sir, is borne on one side by a kangnroo and on the other by an emu.<br />
Ileither one of these creatures, so tile botanists tell me, is physically<br />
able to move backwards; they can only move forward. We will and we<br />
have. There is little time for figures to be presented to a meeting<br />
such as this, but at least in the last decade one can say that the grosE<br />
national product of my country has doubled at an average rate of five and<br />
a half per cent; that the expenditure on foreign aid has doubled; that the<br />
expenditure on defence has trebled; that our population has increased by<br />
one third. But that is all in the past. I remember, Sir, if I may translate<br />
it a little later into idiom, something which struck my mind when I was<br />
young. All of the past is prelude, which means " You ain't seen nothing<br />
yet". But still we, like you, do have to contribute more than we<br />
would wish to to the protection of other peoples against attack, to the<br />
building up of a region which you could have said, which was once said<br />
by a British Prime Minister, was a faraway region of which we know<br />
nothing, but which, as far as we are concerned, is a close region of which<br />
we know much. We have to contribute to that because unless it happens,<br />
unless the people living there have a greater chance to improve their<br />
living standards to be able to live a reasonable and decent life, then in<br />
the future there is little hope for a reduction in that money necessary,<br />
but in one sense wasted for defence.<br />
So, we have to do it, and you make it possible for us to do<br />
it. But if this is achieved, if it is possible to beat the swords into plowshares,<br />
if it is possible to translate the aircraft into factories, if it is possible to<br />
take people out of uniform to be productive, then we can see in that area of<br />
the world something growing, something growing not only for their own<br />
benefit, but for our own because we will sell them things, for your own,<br />
because you will sell them things, for our own, because we will buy from<br />
them that which they peculiarly can produce. And we may-who knows,<br />
becaus~ e man is born to travel as the sparks fly upward--but we may achieve<br />
an era nearer to a time when men can live in peace, when men can live in<br />
peace throughout the world, when these great political schisms which, for </p>
<p>so long as I can remember, have torn the world to pieces may become<br />
muted and instead of people saying... " I will run through facism all the<br />
people of the world" or " I will run through communism all the people in<br />
the world", we may have instead a brotherhood of men. Who knows?<br />
I don't, but I am sure that what you are doing and what we are trying to<br />
help you do in a minor way is the only method by which this shining goal<br />
might eventually be achieved.<br />
Sc I do not, as I say, wish tonight to make too serious a<br />
speech, but I would like to repeat a tribute that I made this morning, and<br />
that is..... that the power inside this country, utilized as it is being<br />
utilized by this country, is to me the only sure--not sure--the only<br />
hopeful beacon, not only for this country, or for mine, but for the<br />
peoples generally of the world. Well, the " Maine Lady" of whom you<br />
spoke, long ago said to me something which she said I was to remember<br />
on any occasion when I spoke to a gathering of people. It is a little<br />
quatrain. It " I love the finished speaker, I really truly do. I<br />
don't mean one who is polished, I just mean one who is through".<br />
Mr. President, though I could for an hour go on expressing<br />
the same feelings that you have expressed, I think it is unnecessary<br />
because I think between friends short exchanges are understood and<br />
detailed explanations are not required.<br />
Therefore, I am through. </p>
