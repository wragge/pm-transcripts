PRIME MINISTER 144/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
OCEANS POLICY<br />
The Government has agreed to a proposal for the development of a coordinated national<br />
policy on the management of Australia's marine resource. Given the importance of this<br />
issue and that it crosses many areas of Government activity, I have asked my Department<br />
to coordinate development of the oceans policy. Extensive consultation will take place in<br />
1996 to ensure that the views and interests of all parts of the community are considered.<br />
An integrated oceans policy for Australia will assist in dealing with problems in the marine<br />
environment, taking the opportunities offered by our marine areas, and meeting our<br />
obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for our Exclusive<br />
Economic Zone ( EEZ).<br />
The opportunities provided by Australia's marine environment are likely to increase<br />
considerably as technology advances. We need to position ourselves to take these<br />
opportunities in the EEZ as they arise, as well as ensuring that current uses of marine<br />
resources are efficient and sustainable. The overall goal of the policy should be to provide<br />
the vision that will promote the efficient, sustainable use of Australia's marine resources in<br />
the EEZ while conserving the biological base of those resources. It will also need to<br />
consider the needs of indigenous people in marine resource use and management.<br />
This is an important issue that will benefit from the input from scientists at today's meeting<br />
of my Science and Engineering Council ( PMSEC).<br />
The discussion at the PMSEC meeting was a significant contribution to our approach to<br />
marine science. At the meeting, an expert group of scientists presented a paper titled<br />
Australia's Ocean Age: Science and Technology for Managing our Ocean Territory. They<br />
argued that innovative and sustainable use of marine resources is increasingly likely to<br />
make a significant contribution to Australia's economic prosperity.<br />
