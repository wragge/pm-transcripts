PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN AND HEATHER EWART, 23<br />
SJANUARY 1987. ONAIRCRAFTBETWEEN SYDNEY AND SINGAPORE<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: what do you thinfk youwill ' be ab-leto achiev~ e_<br />
out of it on behalf of Australian?<br />
PM: Let's get the first point. I read in all the papers that<br />
I have this passion to visit Israel as Prime Minister. It is true<br />
that I have wanted to visit Israel but as part of a visit to the<br />
Middle East. I believe that the Middle East remains one of the<br />
f laih points of possible world conflict. And therefore Australia,<br />
as well as having an altruistic concern in trying 46 JV<br />
of some peaceful settlement there has taken the people concerned<br />
also as a country involved in the search for a more stable world.<br />
wants to know what is happening there, to take the opportunity<br />
of listening to the leaders of these three important countries.<br />
And I repeat in particular, I don't go there in the role of a<br />
mediator nor do I go there with any inflated expectations of what<br />
we can do. We go there as a nation of good will, accepted and<br />
respected by the countries concerned. If they believe that there<br />
is anything at all that we can do to help the processes, of course<br />
we stand ready to do itL.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect any difficulties at all in maintaining<br />
the Australian Government's even-handed approach in this region<br />
so far?<br />
PM: I have had no difficulty since I have been Prime Minister<br />
in putting within Australia, and in all relevant forums, the<br />
fundamentals of Australia's position in the Middle East. That<br />
is firstly, our insistence on the right of Israel to exist behind<br />
secure and recognised borders and at the same the recognition of<br />
the rights of the Palestinians. That is a view I had long<br />
before I became Prime Minister. It is now reflected in the attitude<br />
of the Government and of myself as Prime Minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: M1r Hawke, why is there no time for you or why a re<br />
you not going to visit the West Bank or the Gaza Strip?<br />
PM: It hasn't been regarded as essential. I am going to be seeing<br />
the King of Jordan who speaks with considerable authority and<br />
knowledge of that sector. I will be meeting with Palestinians<br />
in Jerusalem. I will have a full capacity to be informed, I believe,<br />
by those with an interest in the welfare of the residents of that<br />
region. .14 AUS Ll </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: But if you are determined to demonstrate a genuine<br />
even-handedness, you are not taken at all by the import of a gesture<br />
where you would go to one of the major Palestinian settlements.<br />
particularly one under Israeli military rule?<br />
PM: No. I don't think that it is necessary and it hasn't been<br />
put to me as being. I don't, myself, regard it as necessary.<br />
Let's got this thing right. We are not going to say look, we<br />
are even-handed, I am now undertaking a visit here to prove evenhandedness.<br />
That is an absurd perception. The world knows, and<br />
the countries in the region know, the integrity of Australia's<br />
position. So I don't have to go over there and organise an<br />
Sitinerary to prove something that is already known.<br />
JOURNALIST: But do you think you are as familiar with the suffering<br />
and the plight of Pales-tinians--as -you-have been--over--the-years--<br />
with that of the Israelis?<br />
PM: Yes, I am aware of it. I -have-had-the-opportunity of-studying.<br />
and listening to people. I met Mayor Freij in my office in Canberra.<br />
And I think he speaks with authority about this issue. He is<br />
certainly regarded as a person who speaks with authority.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did President Reagan offer you any advice<br />
about this trip when he telephoned you?<br />
PM: No, he didn't. He wished me well on the trip. He was very<br />
interested to know I was undertaking it. But no, he tendered no<br />
advice. JOURNALIST: Would you expect that any advice might be offered<br />
from other quarters?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: On what basis has Australia rpjected the right of a<br />
representative of the PLO to attend a delegation in Australia later<br />
in the year?<br />
PM: I have just had a brief discussion with the Foreign Minister<br />
earlier this week. And he expressed the view that it was probably<br />
not appropriate to do it this year. I haven't gone into lengthy<br />
discussions with him about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: But even on the basis of brief discussions, on what<br />
basis does hie have that view and do you agree with him?<br />
PM: There is no necessity in his view to conduct this conference<br />
here at this time. As I understand it. and I don't pretend to<br />
know all the background, but as I understand it, there are conferences<br />
of a similar nature being held in other areas and that being the<br />
case, the view was put, and I agree with it, that no particular<br />
purpose would be served by replicating that in Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: It is a United Nations sponsored conference though,<br />
would there really have been much harm in having it in Australia?<br />
PM: talk about great harm. There are many United Nations<br />
conferencesall over the world. Just because a conference is sponsored<br />
by the United Nations there is no conclusion that follows logically<br />
from that. 4 </p>
