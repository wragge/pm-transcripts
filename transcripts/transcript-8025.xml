PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 16 MAY<br />
1990<br />
9 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, how are you feeling, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I'm feeling very well indeed and I'm very pleased to<br />
report that my specialist and physician report that I'm<br />
in excellent health and I'm just going to go and have<br />
this routine operation which 15 a subject which has<br />
caused a certain amount of ribaldry, if I may say so,<br />
amongst my staff who are showing in these matters even<br />
less discipline than Ministers and they are putting up<br />
alternatives as to whether it requires the, as they put<br />
it, the introduction of a Private Member's Bill or,<br />
alternatively, the suspension of Standing Orders. So the<br />
talk such as this I find should be kept of f the record,<br />
but there's no chance of that is there? Now, OK, I'm<br />
afraid I'll be back amongst you even more vibrant than<br />
ever before.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how many lives does Senator<br />
Button have to have?<br />
PM: Does he have to have? Now that assumes that there<br />
is-<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, I think he is like all of us. He only has the<br />
one. I had reason to have a yarn to John last night and<br />
I believe that he will adhere to injunctions I gave and<br />
issued and that we won't be having any further public<br />
airing of the differences that had occurred between him<br />
and the Treasurer.<br />
JOURNALIST: But nevertheless he's guilty though, Prime<br />
Minister, of telling truths not lies. Things aren't,<br />
things aren't too good.<br />
PM: Well none of us have tried to say that things, inthe<br />
economic sense, are perfect. But if we, if we go<br />
into the question of the state of the economy, just let<br />
me make a few points about that. Two issues of course,<br />
which are properly concerning all of us and not only in<br />
Government, but amongst the commentators, are current </p>
<p>rmmo, or rzcc C~ 4 TCL' oi-oorz-rvzvrz 0 VZP 9 Vo v Nooo f-oz<br />

account situation and inflationary pressures. Now you've<br />
got to understand that there are certain fundamentals<br />
against which those questions have to be considered and<br />
those are that in recent years, 88 both the Treasurer and<br />
I have been stressing, we've been seeing record<br />
investment levels, we've seen the public account..<br />
public sector in surplus and we've seen a very<br />
significant decline in real unit labour costs. Now those<br />
fundamentals reflect the strategy that we have been<br />
pursuing and also another factor which both Paul and I<br />
have been referring to, we made the paint before and<br />
during the campaign, is the very significant increase in<br />
Australian investment overseas which has gone as, I think<br />
I recall the figures precisely, some $ 7 billion when we<br />
came to office and have gone up to $ 49 billion. Now, of<br />
course, if that hadn't taken, taken account, hadn't<br />
occurred, the impact upon the current account figures<br />
would be and our debt situation would be very, very<br />
different. But I'm making the point that if you're<br />
saying things aren't good and particularly that's in<br />
terms of inflationary pressures and the current account<br />
situation, those observations need to be against the<br />
background of those formidably impressive and favourable<br />
circumstances. And let me say this, that we in fact<br />
believe and not only do we believe but the OECD<br />
observations that have been made about the Australian<br />
economy, we expect this situation to improve. The OECD,<br />
for instance, has made these observations it's said in<br />
respect of the savings investment imbalance, which is at<br />
the heart of the current account problem, said firstly in<br />
regard to housing that you could have a situation in<br />
Australia where housing investment as a proportion of GDP<br />
could fall in Australia and still meet your underlying<br />
demand and they've also recently said that our, our<br />
capital stock could continue to grow faster than GDP. In<br />
other words, have a significant addition to your capital<br />
stock, but with lower business investment figures than we<br />
have had in relation to GDP at the present time. Also,<br />
looking to the savings situation, let me say that as a<br />
result of two factors, we expect the private saving<br />
situation to improve in the period ahead. Firstly<br />
because of the impact of the changes that we've made in<br />
regard to superannuation and I and the Treasurer have<br />
spelt those out in considerable detail before and we also<br />
expect there'll be a more sober use of credit in the<br />
years ahead. So, when you take into account the fact<br />
that we are going to see continued public sector<br />
restraint, we believe that the current account has<br />
considerable scope for improvement in the period ahead.<br />
You've got to remember that, as I've said, that the<br />
public sector is in surplus compared with what has<br />
historically been something like two and a half percent<br />
of GDP demand upon community savings and that fundamental<br />
shift in the public sector, of course, has fundamental<br />
significance for-the current account deficit. So I<br />
apologise, in a sense, for taking so long, David, in<br />
going to what you're saying but it's not a question, in<br />
other words, of Senator Button having a view that things </p>
<p>r. n. 3 rMICOV OrrICzC CMlNO TCL-0 V~ TZZ 3<br />
are tough and others not acknowledging that fact. I am<br />
saying that this Government has a strategy to deal with<br />
the two fundamentals of the current account and inflation<br />
and we believe that that strategy is going to work and<br />
that has, of course, implications for us presently. It<br />
means that we, if we are going to continue to be able to<br />
claim the benefit of those circumstances, there's the<br />
obligation which is upon us now to ensure that in this<br />
period ahead fiscal policy remains tight. And, of<br />
course, that's the very period we're getting into now as<br />
we begin the preparatory processes for the Budget and I<br />
can assure you that fiscal restraint will be continued.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you find it surprising that Mr Keating<br />
did not consult with you before launching his attack on<br />
Senator Button<br />
PM: No<br />
JOURNALIST: And what was the explanation if you didn't<br />
find it surprising, why not..<br />
PM: Well, I didn't regard it as an odd thing to do.<br />
Paul and I have a very, very close and, I believe,<br />
effective working relationship which has been<br />
demonstrated particularly in the area of economic<br />
management over the seven years that we have been in<br />
office and it wasn't as though we haven't had discussions<br />
about these sort of issues more generally and I felt that<br />
he was entitled to make the observations that he did and<br />
I've said that before I'm not now saying something new<br />
but it having happened I've tried to make clear to all<br />
of the Ministers in terms of what I said in the Caucus,<br />
Michelle, that I think the time has come for an end to<br />
this public airing of differences of emphasis.<br />
JOURNALIST: get back to Warwick's question. If<br />
Senator Button is again publicly critical of the<br />
Government's performance or policy, will he stay in the<br />
Ministry? PM: I would think that the Senator understands full well<br />
that there is to be no repeat.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect to be in your Ministry at<br />
the end of the year, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Yes, I would expect so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke,<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Rand Corporation report in the Telegraph<br />
this morning. Would your Government be prepared to speak<br />
with the United States Government on possible relocation<br />
of equipment and personnel to Australia 10 1 VU 1' Q no. ouzo r. oo </p>
<p>r-r-m ortI-zc Vr~ unD YC-V* V7 4<br />
PM: Well, I notice, Amanda, that your paper headlined<br />
the story today as though they'd found something new and<br />
exclusive and I with the great respect which I mean<br />
that I have for your paper, I must point out and I hope<br />
it's done gently and is a bit of a down that not only<br />
am I aware of the report, but I'm advised that that Rand<br />
report is more than a year old and has been available<br />
publicly since last December.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, no but nor however is it quite entitled to<br />
receive the, the exclusivity of a scoop that was<br />
suggested by today's headlines. Let me just make these<br />
points about it before going directly to answer your<br />
question, Amanda. Let me make the point, the obvious<br />
point that the Rand Corporation is, of course, a private<br />
organisation and it doesn't, can't speak for the* United<br />
States Government and in any case the report does not<br />
identify Australia as a preferred option, but it<br />
dominates Australia as a number, as one of a number of<br />
possibilities. But the fact is this, Amanda, that there<br />
have not been any approaches to the Australian Government<br />
by the United States Government on the issues raised in<br />
the report, No approaches at all and the negotiations<br />
between the United States and the Philippines Government<br />
are at 8 very, very early stage of discussion. There is<br />
no reason to believe at this point, no reason to believe<br />
at this point, that they won't lead to a conclusion that<br />
would mean a continuation of agreement for United States<br />
bases in the Philippines beyond 1991. But this is a<br />
totally hypothetical question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you accept the OECD's view that<br />
Australians spend too much on their houses?<br />
PM: Well, the, from the OECD perspective I can<br />
understand that because Australians have a, as those of<br />
you and that includes all of you who have travelled to<br />
Europe will have noticed we have a quite different<br />
perspective about housing. We essentially have been<br />
brought up on the tradition of the separate quarter acre<br />
block and, by definition, that involves expenditures and<br />
outlays greater than a pattern of housing which is more<br />
of a medium density type. N4ow I don't think it's a<br />
question really of saying for the OECD to say we<br />
spend too much, but I have said before as you know, I'm<br />
on the record, so are some of my other Ministers as<br />
saying it makes a lot of sense, I believe, for Australia<br />
to examine whether we should so automatically almost be<br />
locked into the traditional housing approach. Now we've<br />
gone further than to say it's a sensible thing to look at<br />
it. We, in discussion with the States and Local<br />
Government who share that view with us, have initiated<br />
processes whereby we will be testing out In Australia the<br />
acceptability for people of more medium density housing.<br />
This has obvious advantages of placing people closer to<br />
places of employment and closer to places of recreation<br />
10 1 V-0 ZIV IV.; 70 no. ov: 7 r,. V, 4 </p>
<p>and entertainment. Now I don't mean by that that for<br />
those for whom this is the, the only acceptable form of<br />
housing that it won't be the way for them, but I think if<br />
there's one thing that's certain, it is that in the<br />
period ahead in Australia the rest of this century and<br />
as we go into the next you will see a change in the, in<br />
the pattern of housing. You'll still have separate<br />
quarter acre blocks, but I think you'll have more medium<br />
density, density housing.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are reported as having told Caucus<br />
yesterday that because you didn't kick heads, this was<br />
not to be seen as a sign of weakness. Would you say that<br />
that was the case and why you felt the need to say it?<br />
PM: Yes, I've examined with a great deal of amusement,<br />
particularly of course in the Financial Review whose<br />
writer in particular has a propensity to raise this issue<br />
about leadership more often than others, been doing it,<br />
people have been doing it for seven years. But this<br />
gazing at the entrails picking over the words, now why<br />
did he say that? Why this amuses me, but I, when I<br />
go into Caucus usually have a few notes prepared. Notes<br />
that were prepared had nothing on this subject I just<br />
scribbled a couple of things on the bottom of that myself<br />
as a, just thought prompters to lead me to say a few<br />
words to the Caucus at the end of my comments on the<br />
economy. Now that was it, you know, just a couple of<br />
notes. There was no premeditation in making the<br />
observation about my style of leadership. It was just in<br />
the course of making what I thought was required of me as<br />
leader in talking to my Caucus somne observations about<br />
recent events. And I just wanted all of the Caucus,<br />
including Ministers, to understand in the course of<br />
making that point that although, as was now well<br />
established after seven years, I am not a person who is a<br />
martinet, I don't try and get the best out of my<br />
0 aMbionuits tetrhsis ini stshuaet anwady , t hante vpeerotphleel esssh outlhda t knIo ww. a s Ncoown cetrhnate'ds<br />
the beginning and the end of it, but I suppose anything<br />
for a headline and anything for a story.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the bases question, Mr Hawke, is the<br />
Government open to approaches from the United States on<br />
the upgrading of military facilities here or relocation<br />
of facilities..<br />
PM: Look we have a very close relationship with the<br />
United States. They can raise any matter with us they<br />
like, they can raise any matter they like, but on this<br />
issue just let me make the obvious point if you are<br />
talking about bases just one obvious point apart from<br />
anything else because I don't think the issue will arise.<br />
Let me make that quite clear. I don't think there will<br />
be any suggestion of the United States approaching us.<br />
But if they want to raise any question, the nature of our<br />
relationship is that they can and should raise any<br />
question on it. I don't think they will, I don't think </p>
<p>r-. rn ' a I-rMcv orIcc CnIND TCL. V 0 Z 0 0i~'~ 0 PO. o 0<br />

the question of bases in Australia will arise. Let me<br />
make one obvious point that our adherence to the South<br />
Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty would preclude, as you<br />
would appreciate, the stationing of nuclear armaments on,<br />
on Australian soil.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one of the unfortunate<br />
aspects of Monday's slapping-down of John Button by Paul<br />
Keating is that in saying that the Minister has failed<br />
with his car plan he's really saying that the Government<br />
itself has failed in this key area of mlicroeconomic<br />
reform. PM: Well, no, Paul if you're going to say that you've<br />
got to look at everything that Paul Keating said, both at<br />
that conference and what he said subsequently. On the<br />
Monday itself Mr Keating went out of his way admittedly<br />
it was on the third page of the transcript and not the<br />
first, but nevertheless it wa there in the same<br />
conference he went out of his way to be laudatory of<br />
Senator Button's achievements, including in the car<br />
industry and in industry generally. And of course as you<br />
know in the Parliament yesterday he went further. So<br />
there has been significant achievements in the car<br />
industry. You'll recall the figures that the Treasurer<br />
used yesterday that when we came to of fice effective<br />
protection in the motor vehicle industry was 250% and<br />
we've brought that down from 250% to under 100%. I think<br />
it's about 80-odd per cent. Now you can't have that<br />
massive reduction and talk about a lack of achievement.<br />
But the important point for the future is that all of us<br />
recognise, not only Paul and myself but Senator Button<br />
and the rest of the Cabinet, that more has to be done.<br />
And more will be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: you haven't spoken to Senator Walsh in<br />
the same as you've spoken to Senator Button, why is<br />
that given the<br />
PM: A very simple reason. Senator Button is a Minister.<br />
Senator Walsh is not.<br />
JOURNALIST: But he made some very damaging comments<br />
about.. PM: You do understand that there is a certain thing<br />
called Cabinet solidarity and so on and Cabinet<br />
responsibilities which by definition don't have the same<br />
application as someone who's not a member of the Cabinet<br />
or the Ministry. I've had a discussion with Senator<br />
Walsh and I made clear at the time that discussion, as<br />
far as I'm concerned, is private. I said to Senator<br />
Walsh the things that I thought were appropriate to be<br />
said to Senator Walsh.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you satisfied that Mr Keating<br />
understands that distinction too, Cabinet solidarity and<br />
all that? 10 1 V; 2 9 Vo ID-Do N0.00D r-00 </p>
<p>n 3 rmav oOrr xfz c vnrqv rT-L. i v r-v = r 7<br />
PM: Indeed. If you want to look at Mr Keating's record,<br />
Mr Keating's record I think is impeccable in the seven<br />
years of this Government in terms of confidentiality<br />
about proceedings of Cabinet and of public as well as<br />
private commitment to the decisions of the Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST:* But you acknowledge that he breached Cabinet<br />
solidarity on Monday.<br />
PM: You can describe it that way if you wish. I'm<br />
saying that, as I sald before, I understood the<br />
circumstances in which, confronted with what he was<br />
confronted with, he felt it necessary to make a<br />
rejoinder. I've said that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you concede that all this cou ld have been<br />
prevented if you'd stepped in earlier and silenced your<br />
Ministers? PM: Well, if I'd attempted to impose in the first,<br />
second, third, now into the fourth Hawke Government some<br />
trappist, vow of trappist silence, if I'd attempted to do<br />
that it was open to me to attempt to do that but it's<br />
simply not my style of leadership. I believe that it's<br />
appropriate for ministers to be able to speak. But I've<br />
tried to impress upon them that they should essentially<br />
it's not always the case but essentially they should<br />
adhere to their own area of responsibility. I simply say<br />
here now as I go into my eighth year of Prime<br />
Ministership that I'll stand on the record of how that<br />
has worked. it has worked well in terms of the processes<br />
of decision-making, the actual decisions themselves, and<br />
generally speaking the commnunication of those decisions<br />
to the public. Obviously you can always do better in<br />
communications than you have actually done. There's<br />
always room for improvement. But over the seven years<br />
it's, I think, been remarkably successful. And may I say<br />
basically there's been a remarkable cohesion in the<br />
Cabinet. Importantly that'. not only my judgement but<br />
it's the judgement of your comrades. in fact if you read<br />
the press in the last day or so they are saying really<br />
why this sticks out at the moment is because it's against<br />
the background of a remarkable degree of cohesion in the<br />
period of the Hawke Government, and it stands out the<br />
more. Now it having been a strength in the past, I'm not<br />
going to see that strength dissipated. Enough is enough<br />
and I've made it clear and I won't tolerate any egregious<br />
breaking of the injunction that I've given to my<br />
ministers. JOURNALIST:-Why do you think it has happened at this..<br />
Prime Minister? Why do you think this lack of discipline<br />
has occurred?<br />
PM: Well as I said, we're now going into the, as I put<br />
it * to the Caucus, the unchartered waters of a fourth<br />
successive government. I don't know whether some<br />
IQ I VU 9VV 1; NO VV__ 7 r or </p>
<p>1eOP0.50 1~ 55a NO. 005 P. 0e<br />
a<br />
Ministers may have felt that there was an invincibility<br />
about us or that now we didn't have to exeroise the same<br />
sort of disciplines we had in the past. it may have just<br />
been the post-election let down probably the answer<br />
more then anything else. But it's not going to be<br />
accepted by me, it's got to come to an end.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are you going to do if the wool<br />
Industry decides to leave the exactly where it is<br />
PM: Well I would hope Paul that the wool industry will<br />
understand that they have a responsibility to the whole<br />
of their members and to this country and that they have<br />
got to be making decisions which are valid for the medium<br />
and to long term. That's what underlies the approach<br />
that we've taken in decisions we made and which I<br />
understand that the Opposition now supports. Mr Icerin<br />
will be talking with the industry and I would rather at<br />
this stage assume that they are going to see good sense<br />
in this matter. if they don't well then we'll have to<br />
consider it at that time. But I would hope that when<br />
they're confronted, as I understand they will now<br />
situation of a common Government and Opposition position<br />
that they will understand what needs to be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Post-election, did you offer Senator Button<br />
the position of High Commissioner to London and is that<br />
offer still open?<br />
PM: The answer to that is, very simply, Whatever<br />
discussions I have with my Ministers on this or any other<br />
sort of matter is confidential between the Minister and<br />
myself. JOURNALIST: Returning medical.<br />
PM: Oh yes, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Very often when these reminders of our<br />
mortality come to us we take a longer term perspective.<br />
Now you are committed to what will be tan years in the<br />
Lodge. PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: It's a long time, hard yakka. You've got an<br />
able replacement Time for a rethink<br />
PM: No not at all. I'm thrilled actually with the<br />
diagnosis that's been made of me by the gentlemen who are<br />
professional and expert in this matter and<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you talking about doctors here or<br />
politicians? PM: I'm referring to the guts, if I may say so, of your<br />
question. It's a matter of pride to me the diagnosis<br />

they made of my physical condition. Modesty forbids me<br />
from telling you exactly, either in the general or in the<br />
specifics, about their diagnosis. But I'm ani<br />
extraordinarily fit 60 year old. So there is not only no<br />
reason, medical reason for rethink, but on the contrary<br />
the analysis that they've made of my physical condition<br />
gives me cause to, if anything, to think of longer<br />
reflective.. But not necessarily in The Lodge.<br />
JOURNALIST: don't have any spine problems<br />
P14: No, they discovered one and they thought it was in<br />
very very sound condition.<br />
JOURNALIST: stay full term.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />

PM: Amanda, these things get somewhat delicate, and you<br />
know I have a long record of delicacy. Let me put it<br />
this way. There was one very very crowded function where<br />
I couldn't give them my immediate attention. I needed a<br />
little bit of relief before I was able to concentrate<br />
fully upon them.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: It was at a hospital. It was at the Repat Hospital<br />
in Sydney...<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have any advice to Paul Keating as to<br />
how to handle the of Acting Prime Minister?<br />
PM: s I think low-key is what well did he not act low-0<br />
keexyc. e lleIn mt ealno w-hkee'ys djoonbe whiit leo ncIe waasn d reIp rtehsiennkt ihneg ditdh ean<br />
country in Gallipoli. I would imagine that he would, I<br />
would be very surprised if he wasn't low-key actually.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it going to be possible for the<br />
Government to living standards generally and real<br />
wages in particular in this next three years and you<br />
find any specific point that Senator Button made over the<br />
weekend objectionable?<br />
PM; I'm not just going to the last part of your<br />
question first I'm not reviving the weekend's events<br />
It would be a very unintelligent thing for me to do.<br />
But as to the first part of your question, what you've<br />
got to understand is that as far as the question of<br />
living standards is concerned, they are determined by<br />
essentially these matters. They are determined by<br />
employment whether you've got a job or not. Secondly<br />
by wages. Thirdly by taxes. Fourthly by pattern of<br />
Social service expenditures. If you look therefore in </p>
<p>r rl. rtMCOV Orr I CC CrMr' TCL_ 1 1* VZrz<br />
respect of those in employment, we are in the midst of<br />
the ' 89-90 wage-tax deal and so with the cobination of<br />
the wage increases that will flow out of that and the<br />
reduction in taxes for those in employment and given the<br />
assumptions about prices, which is of course the other<br />
element in real living standards, one can mee some<br />
marginal real improvements taking wage movements, tax<br />
movements, prices together. Now if you therefore want to<br />
move to the next step and try and get come sort of<br />
aggregate figure you've got to ask yourself what is going<br />
to happen to employment. Well obviously there is going<br />
to be a slowdown in the rate of employment growth. We<br />
had a situation 12 months ago where employment was<br />
growing at five per cent per annum. That's not.<br />
sustainable. The 12 months to April figure are 2.7%.<br />
That's the latest annualised rate of growth. So it's<br />
still a significant rate of growth and is consistent of<br />
course with the analysis that I and the Treasurer are<br />
making of how we see the soft landing outcome. That is<br />
consistent with some marginal increase in the<br />
unemployment rate. You can't in the end be dogmatic<br />
about that because it depends, you know, the bit variable<br />
in that is the participation rate which is quite a<br />
volatile figure and which is currently at a very high<br />
level. So those in employment, you would see a marginal<br />
improvement in living standards. And of course as for as<br />
the rest of the community is concerned, you are aware of<br />
what we have in inflation terms of the significant<br />
improvements over the past in the value and then the<br />
maintenance of the value and the real benefits of those<br />
entitlements. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the changing pattern in housing<br />
that you mentioned, over what period do you see this<br />
happening and do you foresee redevelopment in areas?<br />
PM: That's in fact going on and I referred to decisions<br />
that we've made with the State Governments actually to<br />
fund pilot projects of that sort. Now this is in fact<br />
happening and the interesting thing from my point of view<br />
is that there has been a positive response both from<br />
State Governments and Local Governments to the need to<br />
make the changes necessary to facilitate this sort of<br />
development. Barriers to it in the past have been<br />
regulations of Local Government and some attitudes of<br />
State Governments. But there is an acceptance of the<br />
need for change in that area and there is cooperation<br />
with State and Local Governments in the development of<br />
these pilot projects. Now my assumption Is that as pilot<br />
projects come into being and are seen to be successful, I<br />
think you will see a growth in this movement. Now to try<br />
and put a precise figure on the rate of change is not<br />
sensible other than to say I'm sure that it will move in<br />
the direction that I've been talking about.<br />

PM: That question's already been asked and answered.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do the recent comments by Senator<br />
Button and any number of other Ministers reflect a<br />
growing uncertainty or loss of faith in the Cabinet about<br />
the effectiveness of the Government's economic policy?<br />
PM: No, I don't believe so. Let me say that, a I think<br />
I indicated before, Julie, that there is no doubt that<br />
the country faces the sorts of problems that I talked<br />
about which essentially come under the headings of the<br />
current account problem and the inflationary pressure<br />
problem. I think Ministers are aware that it's a bit<br />
disconcerting to them that it is the case but they are<br />
aware of the fact, I think, that we face in this upcoming<br />
Budget round some more difficult decisions in expenditure<br />
restraint. It is the case that they get harder each time<br />
by definition and we've done the relatively easy<br />
expenditure cutting in the early years and so each year<br />
you get on and you've got to do some more, it gets harder<br />
and I think they find that a little bit upsetting and<br />
disconcerting. But I think there is a basic faith in the<br />
members of the Cabinet and indeed of the Caucus that the<br />
essential strategy that we've got is right and we're just<br />
going to have to have the courage to keep on making the<br />
necessary decisions in the current period to sustain that<br />
strategy and an essential part of that is a maintained<br />
fiscal restraint, and we'll do it. We'll require it of<br />
ourselves and of the States.<br />
JOURNALIST: Not including fiscal restraint.<br />
PM: Continuing fiscal restraint.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean a Budget surplus of more than<br />
the current<br />
PM: it means a significant Budget surplus.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think you've out Senator Walsh<br />
in that process?<br />
PM: If you've got a question about Senator Walsh's<br />
physical condition then you should address the question<br />
to him.<br />

getting more of an airing is the<br />

this country about immigration. Probably more than any </p>

one in this Parliament, I have been associated with the<br />
development of Australia's immigration policy. I sy<br />
that on the basis of the fact to my earliest days of the<br />
ACTU as 8 research officer then as president. I was very<br />
much involved with the trade union movement, in<br />
cooperation with the then conservative governments, in<br />
trying to have a bipartisan policy. I did a lot of work<br />
both as research officer end then as president of the<br />
ACTU in ensuring that the labour movement, in its broader<br />
sense, would be supportive of an expansionary immigration<br />
Policy. I played an important role in that and as you've<br />
heard me may before, indeed one of the things that<br />
impelled me into joining the Labor Party back in 1947, my<br />
first year at university, was the sense of excitement<br />
that I had as a young man then in what the then Labor<br />
Government was doing in undertaking that vast immigration<br />
policy. I saw it as something in which was going to be<br />
fundamental to the future of this country. So more than<br />
anyone in this Parliament I have a commitment to<br />
immigration and what it has meant for this country. But<br />
that doesn't mean that I think that there is a sacredness<br />
about this issue which precludes debate that this is<br />
merely a matter for the Govern ' ment on high saying here's<br />
what the figure is, all the rest of you people accept it.<br />
On the contrary it's because I understand what the<br />
importance of immigration has been to the very nature and<br />
quality of Australia that I welcome discussion and<br />
informed and non prejudiced debate in the community. I<br />
will expect my Minister to come to the Cabinet with<br />
detailed proposals about next targets and I look forward<br />
at the end of the year, it's in November, to the<br />
conference which is being organised by the research unit<br />
of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. We<br />
can only as a country, in my judgemnent, be improved as a<br />
society if, a8 a society, we discuss this issue,<br />
understand what the contribution of immigration has been<br />
in the past to Australia, to understand that that<br />
contribution has been not merely economic but it's been<br />
social, it has gone to the whole question of what sort of<br />
country we are. We are a richer, more diverse, better<br />
country now because of the fact that we have been a<br />
country of large immigration. Now we've got to ask<br />
ourselves what's the best way on that magnificent basis<br />
that we've built in now getting on for half a century of<br />
this sort of approach, what' 8 the sort of decision that<br />
is best called for now and always in that debate economic<br />
considerations are going to be important. From the very<br />
beginning when the concept of massive post-war<br />
immigration was conceived by the Curtin end Chifley Labor<br />
Governments, economic capacities and economic<br />
implications were at the very centrality of their<br />
consideration and they must remain so. There is<br />
legitimate room for difference about the economic<br />
implications of immigration both in the immediate term<br />
and in the medium and the longer term, very legitimate<br />
grounds for differences of opinion as to economic<br />
implications. We'll be better off as a society if we<br />
have these discussions out in the open without rancour<br />

and with respect to the opinions of one another, there i-s<br />
only one factor in which I will no discuasion and<br />
that, as far as I'm concerned, and that is any<br />
proposition based upon racism. Any proposition, any~<br />
element in the debate that some people, some group of<br />
people are second class or third class human beings.<br />
That element of the debate as far as I'm concerned will<br />
not be tolerated. Everything else is legitimately and<br />
properly on the table and I will encourage it.<br />
JOURNALIST: How well informed and unprejudiced is the<br />
current level of debate?<br />
PM: I think generally speaking it is unprejudiced. I<br />
think those who have a racial prejudice are in a minority<br />
in the country. In the area of economic debate, there's<br />
always room for improvement and indeed it is the case<br />
simply that economists are divided upon the issue and<br />
that's why as far as I'm concerned the more debate, the<br />
better about this.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the second part of Amanda's<br />
question when she apparent influence of the ethnic<br />
lobby? PM: I'm sorry, yes I overlooked that. No I don't think<br />
they have an undue influence. It Is appropriate that<br />
governments and oppositions as they have in this period<br />
which is now nearly half a century old in this<br />
country, I think governments and oppositions have always<br />
listened to what representatives of their community have<br />
got to say, I think that's a proper part of the<br />
democratic process and indeed this should be of special<br />
encouragement to our newer citizens to make them know<br />
that we want to hear what they've got to Bay. But as far<br />
as I'm concerned they won't have an undue influence. I<br />
and my Minister will want to hear what they've got to<br />
say. In the end their voice will be one of several in us<br />
coming to our final decision. I must go I'm sorry.<br />
