F 76 / 178<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS AUGUST 26, 1976<br />
BUDGET DEBATE<br />
The Leader of the Opposition delivered the Labor Party's<br />
response to the Budget on Tuesday. His speech displayed<br />
the same frame of mind, the same disregard for reality that so<br />
damaged Australia during Labor's three years of government.<br />
As most economic commentators have said, he is living in the<br />
past. I regret to say that he was not in top form.<br />
I regret to. say it because he has told everyone that he<br />
gets " terribly distressed" when people say he is not.<br />
Unfortunately it must be said: he wasn't. But one does<br />
have to admit that he has raised self deception to an art form.<br />
He claimed that under Labor " unemployment was falling"-<br />
this from a man whose government trebled unemployment in one year.<br />
He claimed that under Labor " inflation was falling"<br />
this from a man whose government in its three years in office<br />
trebled the rate of inflation.<br />
He claimed that under Labor " the incomes of Australians were<br />
protected against rises in the cost of living" this from the<br />
leader of a government whose excesses destroyed the savings<br />
of tens-of thousands of retired, whose inflation harmed<br />
the weak, the poor and the aged most of all.<br />
He claimed that under the Labor government there was<br />
" irestraint on Government expenditure" this from a man whose<br />
budgets increased Government expenditure 115%. whose<br />
accumulated, budget deficits during his period in office<br />
approached $ 6,000 million.<br />
In just three years his Government reduced one of the world's<br />
most prosperous nations to one in keep recession and stagnation.<br />
There was no section of the Australian community that escaped<br />
unscathed from his plans for Australia's future.<br />
And the leader of the Opposit. io. n is unrepentant he told us<br />
on Tuesday he would do it again if he had the chance.<br />
Well he won't get it. The people of Australia won't have him.<br />
Bob Hawke knows it. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Still, I am sure that he is taking some comfort from<br />
this fact as he said in London: he is more loved as<br />
Leader of the Opposition than he ever was as Prime Minister.<br />
I think that is true so far as the Australian people are<br />
concerned never bei-. re in Australian history was a Leader<br />
of the Opposition czocsen by such a massive landslide.<br />
But I should add that his own Party probably loves him as<br />
much in Opposition as they did in Government. The<br />
irrepressible Bob Hawke, kindly Kim Beazley, Sir John Egerton,<br />
and all have expressed their feelings clearly and unmistakably.<br />
Sir John Egerton " I could never trust-Whitlam again nor could<br />
Australia" ( The Australian, 28 July 1976)<br />
Kim Beazley " I would resign if I was in his position"<br />
(, Melbourne Herald, 16 March 1976)<br />
Dr. Cairns " The first thing the Party has to do is to get<br />
rid of Mr Whitlam as Leader". ( Brisbane<br />
Courier Mail, S January 1976)<br />
Bob Hawke " The ALP doesn't belong to Whitlam ( or Barnard)<br />
Whitlam seens to think he has an inherent right<br />
derived from God to make a decision to put the<br />
Party in such a dangerous situation."<br />
( The Australian, 5 June 1975)<br />
Mr Speaker: I do not want to mislead the House. I am not going<br />
to accuse the Leader of the Opposition of putting forward an<br />
economic policy. To do so would be quite unfair because as he<br />
has said he is not much interested in econbmics.<br />
The Government is. We have put forward a clear and consistent<br />
economic strategy. The Budget we put forward combines economic<br />
responsibility with social reform. It was a Budget for people.<br />
Because it will continue to move Australia out of the economic decline<br />
caused by the Labor Party.<br />
Our central concern has been to attack inflation because this is<br />
the only way that sound growth can be restored and employment<br />
opportunities expanded. No aspect of the Budget demonstrates our<br />
concern for people more than the attack on inflation.<br />
Unless inflation is seen to be coming under control, there will be:<br />
no increase in confidence in Australia's future; no increased<br />
investment; no sustainable increase in consumption and no sustainable<br />
increase in employment.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has-understood nothing. He cannot see<br />
that in present circumstances, inflation and unemployment are<br />
inextricably linked. He cannot understand that there cannot be<br />
any sustained improvement in unemployment until inflation begins<br />
to be curbed and inflationary expectations dispelled. .3/<br />
7-</p>
<p>His third Treasurer understood this last year. In the Budget speech<br />
last year he said:<br />
inflation is this nation's most menacing enemy....... if we<br />
fail to-control inflation, unemployment will get worse." 1<br />
This has now been forgotten by the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
The present Governme-n: has also recognised that excessive wage<br />
increases are damaging Australia's economic prospects.<br />
As the first of La'D=' s ephemeral Treasurers finally acknowledgcd,<br />
" One man's pay pack-et!-is another man's job".<br />
Even the present Leader of the Opposition once fleetingly on<br />
January 1975, grasped this point. He said:<br />
" Simply the fact is, that for every excessive increase in incomes,<br />
the job of another man is taken". He soon lost his grip of this<br />
unpleasant fact.<br />
This government recognises the unpopular but inescapable fact that<br />
in present circumstances,. rising wage costs add to unemployment.<br />
We have put it to the Arbitration Commission and to the community.<br />
We submitted before the Arbitration Commission that full wage<br />
indexation locks the economy into double digit inflation.<br />
The consequence of full wage indexation is to prevent sustained<br />
economic recovery or a return to full employment. The Commission<br />
is beginning to accept this. Increasingly, the trade union member<br />
is beginning to accept this.<br />
There is a growing recognition that excessive wage increases are not<br />
only illusory but damaging to the Australian economy and to the<br />
interests of workers. The trade union movement has a vital role in<br />
determining whether the economic recovery continues and employment<br />
opportunities expand.<br />
Those few militant officials who inflict senseless strikes on the<br />
co-mmunity are undermining recovery and restricting job opportunities.<br />
They are imposing hardship on all Australians in an effort to advance<br />
their own interests.<br />
Strikes such as the container dispute involving rolling strikes by<br />
several unions on the water front, the 48-hour S. E. C. strike in<br />
Victoria, and the Medibank strike have cost Australia millions of<br />
dollars in lost production, lost wages and lost jobs.<br />
It is estimated that the S. E. C. strike will cost Australia $ 70 million<br />
in lost production; $ 12 million in lost wages; 300,000 employees will<br />
be stood down.<br />
It is estimated that the Medibank national strike cost Australia<br />
$ 100 million in lost wages, $ 300 million in lost production.<br />
They have harmed all Australianys; they have harmed the unemployed<br />
most of all.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has understood nothing; he persists<br />
with the virulent anti-business mentality which his party translated<br />
into policy when in government. 4/ </p>
<p>The Leader of the Opposition has understood nothing he<br />
persists with the virulent anti-business mentality which<br />
his Party translated into policy when in government.<br />
This irrational dislike for business was one of the factors<br />
which undermined busin--ess confidence and investment. It is<br />
no accident that private fixed investment in 1975/ 76 was almost<br />
ten percent less in real terms than in 1973/ 74. It is<br />
no accident that in 7: he Labor years the private secotr which<br />
usually'. employs three quarters of the workforce -took up none<br />
of the increase in the workforce. It is no accident that under<br />
Labor billions-of dollars of minerals and energy projects<br />
were deferred.<br />
When he attacks business and business profits,. the. Leader of the<br />
Opposition is attacking jobs. He is attacking the hundreds<br />
o f thousands of small businesses which suffered disastrously under<br />
his policies and which this Government in this Budget<br />
has moved decisively to help.<br />
Our decision to ease the distribution requirements for private<br />
comapnies will be a significant assistance to many small businesses.<br />
Our decisions on trading stock valuation adjustment will for the<br />
first time, put a brake on the erosion of the capital base of<br />
private enterprise erosion by inflation. The incentives we<br />
have given to mining and oil exploration will get these vital<br />
industries moving again, as they were before growth was halted.<br />
by the doctrinaire approach of the Labor Party.<br />
By attacking inflation and by offering industry tax<br />
incentives, this Government has shown that it wishes to re-establish<br />
a vigorous and prosperous business sector.<br />
Only if there is business recovery will there by national<br />
prosperity and employment for all who want to work.<br />
The private sector employs three, quarters of the workforce Australia<br />
needs a vigorous private secto ' r if more job opportunites are<br />
to be created. New investment. must take place to forestall<br />
supply bottlenecks as the economy gathers momentum New<br />
investment in the private sector and the increased productivity<br />
will make a major contribution to raising the living standards<br />
of all Australians.<br />
The Opposition would obviously have budgeted for a much larger increaso<br />
outlay and a much larger deficit..<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has shown that his only strategy is<br />
to spend. He has learnt nothing. He doesn't understand that<br />
his approach simply leads to more inflation, more unemployment.<br />
He has an insatiable desire to throw money at problems an approach<br />
which not only undermines the economy, but exacerbates the problems<br />
the expenditure purports to solve. He has tried that approach..<br />
He has failed. In Australia and overseas the lesson is clear.<br />
Governments cannot spend their way out of recession when inflation<br />
is running as it has been recently. To attempt to do so is<br />
apt to lead, perhaps after a short burst of activity to a<br />
deepening of the recession and worsening of unemployment. </p>
<p>There can be no better demonstration of the inappropriateness<br />
of the traditional " pump-priming" approach in periods of rapid<br />
inflation than to look at Labor's record. In 1974/ 75 Bud get<br />
expenditures increased by 46 percent and the deficit rose<br />
by almost $ 2,300 million.<br />
In 1975/ 76 there was a further increase in expenditure of<br />
23 percent and the deficit rose by a further $ 1,000 million<br />
to $ 3,585 million it would have been much greater if it<br />
hadn't been for the measures we took.<br />
Over this period prices increased by more than 30 percent.<br />
Yet over this same period there was negligible growth in real<br />
output and unemployment increased by over 200,000.<br />
Let me turn to the question of unemployment.<br />
Opposition spokesmen have tried to create the impression that the<br />
Budget will give rise to a massive increase in unemploymentfigures<br />
of 500,000 unemployed by the end of the year have been<br />
wildly bandied about.<br />
What hypocrisy from the men who made unemployment a major problem<br />
for the first time since the thirties. As part of this reckless<br />
and mischievous campaign some have even gone so far as to<br />
assert that the budget documents themselves imply a rise in<br />
unemployment over the course of 1976/ 77.<br />
Neither statement No. 2 attached to the budget speech nor any<br />
other budget document implies an increase in the level of<br />
unemployment over the course of 1976/ 77.<br />
With employment growth expected to be more than 2 percent<br />
and labour force growth 2 percent at most, the statement in fact<br />
foreshadows some reduction in the level of unemployment during the<br />
course of the year as a whole.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition and others have taken out and dusted<br />
down the worn-out slogan that this Government is not interested<br />
in reducing the level of unemployment: indeed, that it is<br />
deliberately maintaining a so-called" pool" of unemployment as<br />
means of inducing wage restraint on the part of the trade union<br />
movement. First, it is argued that by curtailing the -rate of growth<br />
of budgetary spending the Government will be depriving the<br />
private sector of much-needed demand for its output. This<br />
demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the Government's<br />
economic strategy.<br />
Neither I, nor the Treasurer, nor any other iMinister have<br />
suggested that curtailing the rate of growth of Government spending<br />
will not have some short-term impact on those parts of the private<br />
sector previously supplying that Government demand.<br />
But what those who argue along those lines conveniently overlook<br />
is that this is only part of the total picture. The curtailment<br />
of spending has enabled the Government to take a number of<br />
measures which will provide a direct boost to private sector activity. / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
These have included tax cuts for both businesses and individuals.<br />
What the A. L. P. cannot comprehend is the effect of these measures<br />
on consumer and business confidence confidence which is<br />
growing because of the belief that this Government will successfully<br />
combat inflation and get the economy moving again.<br />
These boosts to the private sector will mean that far from<br />
causing a reduction in employment opportunities the budget will<br />
result overall in an expansion of such opportunities.<br />
An expansion which will be a sustainable expansion not a short-term<br />
and unsustainable one that results from attacking the symptoms<br />
of the problem rather than the cause.<br />
To say that a budget that seeks to rein back inflation is designed<br />
to create unemployment is simply to fail to recognise that unless<br />
inflation is reined back there can be no sustained reduction<br />
in unemployment.<br />
The other ground for charging the Government with attempting<br />
to maintain a " pool" of unemployed is that the call for a<br />
reduction in real wages until the present wage/ profit imbalance is<br />
rectified, will lead to reduced spending by consumers and, in turn,<br />
lower production and employment opportunities.<br />
Thus the Leader of the Opposition criticises the Government for<br />
attempting to curb excessive wage increases. In a Whitlambsque<br />
economic analysis, he argues that only if real disposable incomes<br />
are increased will consumer spending be increased.<br />
Here again, there is a. failure both to understand quite basic<br />
propositions and, clearly, to learn anything from past events.-<br />
It should be clear by now from experience in Australia and overseas<br />
that under present inflationary circumstances you do not boost<br />
consumption merely by increasing wages.<br />
In the present inflationary situation wage increases are likely to<br />
have the opposite effect. They fuel inflation, increase<br />
unemployment and reduce spending.<br />
In 1974 between the March and December quarters, real average<br />
earnings increased by 10 percent inflation increased by 13 percent.<br />
Consumption went up by less -than 1 percent.<br />
The wage increases accelerated inflation. Accelerating inflation<br />
increased uncertainty and insecurity amongst consumers.<br />
Consumers accordingly spent less.<br />
-Employers were forced to lay off workers. Employment fell, and<br />
unemployment rose. This strengthened the vicious circle savings<br />
rose further. Only in recent months has consumption increased<br />
as wage restraint has given people more confidence that inflation<br />
can be reduced. 2 ,7. </p>
<p>This Government is greatly concerned at the high level<br />
of unemployment unemployment we inherited from those who now<br />
sit opposite.<br />
Our policies will, in ime, lead to a sustainable reduction<br />
in the number unemployed. What the Leader of the Opposition<br />
refuses to concede if indeed he realises is that it will<br />
not be possible to rectify overnight the grave damage done<br />
to the economy by his Government.<br />
The nature of economies is -such that, unfortunately, there is<br />
no such thing as a " quick fix". As we have said all along,<br />
the job ahead of us will take time. They key to how quickly<br />
we progress depends on what happens to inflation in the period ahead.<br />
It used to be that the Leader of the Opposition sought scapegroats<br />
for Labor's disasters now he denies that there ever were<br />
disasters or scandals.<br />
Rather than honestly evaulating their real performance in the past<br />
and supporting a co-ordinated approach to restoring confidence,<br />
activity and jobs Labor persists with distorting the past and<br />
falsifying the present. The Labor Party's approach is calculated<br />
to delay recovery and the creation of jobs for those they<br />
belatedly profess to care for.<br />
The Leader of the Oppos ' ition seeks to deny that recovery is<br />
underway. Recent eventfs strengthen the Government' s view<br />
that recovery is proceeding.<br />
In particular, national accounts estimates for the June quarter have<br />
become available since Budget night. Among other things,<br />
these show * that gross non-farm product rose again in -real terms<br />
in the June quarter following an increase of 3.2 percent in the<br />
March quarter; non-farm product in the first half of 1976<br />
was more than 3 percent above its level in the preceding<br />
half year. More importantly the sources of growth in the June<br />
quarter indicate that the recovery has been consolidating.<br />
Whereas the March quarter increase in non-farm product stemmed<br />
largely from a turnaround in stocks, the June quarter increase<br />
reflected strengthening private final demand. Private consumption<br />
expenditure is estimated to have increased by 2.7 percent in the June<br />
quarter following very sluggish behaviour during the preceding<br />
three quarters. Investment in dwellings continued at a healthy<br />
rate. Investment in plant and equipment consolidated the strong<br />
rise recorded in the March quarter. In addition, exports have<br />
continued to grow to record levels.<br />
But the ODposition does not want to be confused with any of these<br />
facts.<br />
Some people have expressed disappointement that the budget, for<br />
them lacked excitement although conceding that it was proper and<br />
responsible. It is true that by the standards of recent years this budget lacks<br />
the element of theatre so characteristic of the Leader of the<br />
Opposition. / 8 </p>
<p>An increase of only 11 percent in the rate at which this<br />
Government proposes to spend taxpayers money in the year ahead has a<br />
certain lack of panache compared to the 46 percent<br />
increase of only two years ago, or even the 23 percent increase<br />
of last year.<br />
A proposed deficit of only $ 2,600 million shows, in the minds<br />
of some, a certain lack of. imagination compared with the<br />
prospective figure of about $ 4,500 million or more with which<br />
we were confronted at the time we took office.<br />
It is true that by contrast with, say, last year<br />
we have not sought to levy an additional $ 750 million's worth<br />
of indirect taxes.<br />
In fact, we have taken the very dull course of not raising<br />
any major tax at all.<br />
This is just one more aspect of the Budget's concern for people.<br />
Anyone in touch wvith what is -happening in Australia will know<br />
that taxation has become a major problem for individuals,<br />
families and business. This Government is committed as we have<br />
already demonstrated, to a continuing programme of major tax reform.<br />
We have introduced full indexation of personal income taxes. We<br />
have begun the implementation of reforms in the area of business<br />
taxation. Our concern' in this area will be a continuing one.<br />
The reforms already introduced by this Government extend far<br />
beyond the vital area of taxation. We have had particular regard<br />
to the damage the. Whitlam policies did to the weakest sections<br />
of our community. Our approach has been to increasingly concentrate<br />
assistance on those most in need. The family allowance scheme<br />
has been the greatest single reform since Federation to assist<br />
families in poverty. Pensions and benefit adjustments for<br />
inflation will now be automatic. A more equitable income test<br />
has been introduced for pensions. Medibank has been reformed<br />
to contain costs and provide choice. A,. newv home savings grant has been<br />
introduced. Real expenditure on educational programmes has been<br />
increased. An imaginative experimental scheme to provide greater<br />
housing choice to those on low incomes will be undertaken.<br />
Handicapped children's allowances have been increased by to<br />
This has been made possible by our economies in other areas.<br />
Triennial funding for universities has been restored.<br />
Beyond these measures we have acted to end one and for all the<br />
drift of all power to the Federal Government by our historic<br />
Federalism reforms.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition simply does not understand that a<br />
nation is weakened, not strengthened by a central Government which<br />
seeks, to dictate in every area of national life.<br />
Australians are facing an enormous challenge. The Whitlam Government's<br />
policies for the public sector set back the chance of building a<br />
decent life for Australians by years. 9 </p>
<p>Myth was more important than reality, words took the place<br />
of action., posruring for the hard slogging work ' of providing<br />
effective ( Cnvernment. Not only did Government fail to achieve its-objectives<br />
under'Labor. It positively hindered individual .; Australians<br />
from achieving theirs. Families struggled to afford a place to<br />
live, to meet the rising costs of education, to find and keep<br />
a job, to afford the pri! ces at~ the supermarket, to prote~ ct<br />
the value of their savings.<br />
This Government is not a-mbiguous about the role of the public sector.<br />
An effective public sector is an essential condition for the building<br />
of the kind of country where every Australian rich and poor<br />
can live with dignity and self respect. An effective public<br />
sector is one which encourages productivity and investment which<br />
encourages enterprise to increase the nation's wealth. I and<br />
cxpand opportunities. An effective public sector is one which gives<br />
taxpayers value for the money they are rquired'to spend on it.<br />
An ef fective public sector is one which can devise programmes<br />
which work, and enables Australians to be more effective in<br />
achieving their goals, me eting their needs. An effective public<br />
sector is one which acts to improve the position of the poor and<br />
disadvantaged not undermine it. It must expand people's<br />
capacities, not trample them underfoot.<br />
Of course, Government expenditure on roads, transport, education,<br />
hospitals, is vital. This is trite and obvious. It is not<br />
some profound new discovery of the Leader of the Opposition. It was<br />
not even new in 1972. All Australians are agreed on this.<br />
Unquestionably, some worthwhile programmes have had to be<br />
curtailed. There is much more that can, shouldl, and will be done<br />
in many areas of need. For Labor, constant reiteration of need<br />
in these areas about which there is no argutient had become<br />
a substitute for facing up to any of the really difficult questions.<br />
Responsible Government must have the courage to set priorities, to<br />
choose to tell people frankly and openly what is possible and<br />
what is not.<br />
The Government must set priorities in public spending -applause<br />
for limitless promises is dearly bought as we have seen.<br />
Government must weigh increases in Government against private<br />
spending by individuals, families and private enterprise.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition acknowledged in passing that private<br />
incomes were important. He does not see or does not care<br />
that an excessive tax burden not only erodes incentives,<br />
it makes Australian families increasingly dependent on what<br />
politicians choose to provide. The simple fact is that he<br />
prefers his plans to theirs. Australians had to surrender their<br />
priorities to his.<br />
The sad, the tragic fact is that both Government programmes and the<br />
hopes, expectations and plans of individuals, have had to<br />
be curtailed because our national resources have actually been<br />
diminishing rather than expanding. </p>
<p>Because for three years we had a government which had neither the<br />
commonsense nor the courage to set and keep to responsible<br />
priorities. This budget has beerr a reforming document which will set<br />
Australia firmly towards prosperity.<br />
It provides jobs, restrains taxes, encourages enterprise<br />
and helps those in need.<br />
It is the kind of budget which as many commentators have<br />
recognised Australians voted for last December.<br />
It is the kind of Budget which will help build the kind of<br />
Australia we all want to see. 000ooo000 </p>
