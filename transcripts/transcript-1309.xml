PRIM~ E MINISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASI<br />
Statement issued by the Prime Minister. Mr.<br />
Harr' 4d Holt. on arrival in Sing~ apore 29TH APRIL, 1966<br />
As I explained when I passed through Singapore last<br />
week, my visit here is part of a comprehensive tou~ r to the countries<br />
of South-East Asia where Australian Forces are station,, d Viet Nam,<br />
Thailand, Yeayalsia, and Singapore.<br />
Australia, as a fellow member of the Commonwealth, has<br />
been followin, with interest the developments here since Singapore<br />
became an independent member. This is the first occasion on which<br />
the Prixae Minister of Australia has officially visited Singapore<br />
since it assumed its new status.<br />
The Singapore 31overnment has recently announced that it<br />
will send a senior official as High Commissioner to Canberra. It<br />
is gratifying that Canberra should be included in the initial<br />
overseas appointments made by the Singapore Jovernment. This is a<br />
recognition of the friendship and the many mutual interests between<br />
our two countries in defence and security and in economic and other<br />
affairs. Australia, of course, has maintained a substantial official<br />
representation in Singapore for many years.<br />
I look forward to discussions with Sigapore Ministers.<br />
As was done in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, I expect to give them an<br />
account of my visit to Viet Nam. There will also be exchanges of<br />
views on the various regional questions of concern to both<br />
Governments. Australia has observed with close attention the<br />
systematic and constructive efforts of Singapore to develop its<br />
economy and to create new employment opportunities through<br />
industrialisation and expanding trade. This requires peace,<br />
stability and assured security. If these conditions exist, sound<br />
forward planning and the efficient and rational use of resources<br />
can be accomplished. Through the combined arrangements in -the defence field,<br />
Australia is able to add its efforts to those of other Commonwealth<br />
countries to preserve the conditions of security and stability.<br />
Australia and Singapore enjoy positive benefits as<br />
good neighbours. </p>
<p>2-<br />
Increasingly useful relationships are growing in trade<br />
and business, in education and in professional and technical<br />
training. Cqntacts between our two people in these and other<br />
fields, such as tourism, are multiplying with the development of<br />
rapid communications. Australia is a country with an expanding Industrial<br />
base and an increasing technology.<br />
Further areas ) f co-operation will undoubtedly arise<br />
between our two countries as Sing apore develops along similar<br />
paths. </p>
