SPEECH FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE NATIONAL LANGUAGES INSTITUTE OF AUSTRALIA<br />
NATIONAL GALLERY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
MELBOURNE 21 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
The worlds of economic, social, cultural and artistic<br />
knowledge are concealed by a door. The key to that door is<br />
language. It is very apt that the National Gallery of Victoria, a<br />
major storehouse and show-case for our heritage and for our<br />
cultural achievements, should be the location for the launch<br />
of the National Languages Institute of Australia.<br />
And it is gratifying to see the Government's commitment to<br />
language training complemented by the presence of such a<br />
large and diverse group of people today.<br />
At the outset let me congratulate Joseph Lo Bianco on his<br />
appointment as Director of the Institute. As the author of<br />
the National Policy on Languages, which the Government has<br />
been implementing since 1987, Joe brings to the job a<br />
dedication and wealth of experience recognised nationally<br />
and, increasingly, internationally.<br />
The National Policy on Languages provides a sound and<br />
far-sighted framework for the Institute's work.<br />
Its four basic goals are:<br />
the ability of all Australians to speak and write<br />
English support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
languages the acquisition by all Australians of a language other<br />
than English, and<br />
equitable and widespread language services.<br />
One of Australia's great resources is the fact that thanks<br />
to the accident of history that saw Captain Cook arrive on<br />
the east coast of our continent a few days ahead of La<br />
Perouse we are part of the English-speaking world.<br />
3418 </p>
<p>2.<br />
I don't seek to enter into any argument about the relative<br />
merits of Shakespeare and Milton over Racine and Voltaire.<br />
That would be interesting, but beside the point.<br />
Less controversial and more relevant is the consequence of<br />
Captain Cook's speedier arrival.<br />
For much of our subsequent history our British heritage,<br />
including having English as our first language, underpinned<br />
the access of Australian producers to the vast markets of<br />
the former British Empire.<br />
Today, English is still the key to our trading links with<br />
the United Kingdom, the United States, and the wider<br />
English-apeaking world. More than 30 per cent of our<br />
exports go to countries where English is the principal<br />
trading language; and such countries provide more than<br />
per cent of our imports.<br />
Even beyond the English-speaking world, English remains the<br />
most international of languages. It is truly one of the<br />
great glabal trading languages.<br />
However the more recent internationalisation of trade and<br />
industry has left Australia with a major challenge: the need<br />
to improve the way we interact with markets where languages<br />
other than English are spoken.<br />
In our international business dealings we have too often<br />
been unprepared to venture into the unfamiliar territory of<br />
foreign languages and cultures. We haven't devoted the<br />
effort we perhaps should have to the mind-expanding and<br />
business-expanding education offered by new language skills.<br />
With the; inevitable emergence into the global economy of the<br />
countries that once formed a bloc of centrally planned<br />
nations the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe<br />
Australians will need to ensure we can compete in these new<br />
markets on their linguistic terms.<br />
And new language skills are particularly important as we<br />
seek to enmesh ourselves in the dynamism of the Asia-Pacific<br />
region. We earn an increasingly large part of our export dollar from<br />
countries that do not speak English as their first language<br />
including, of course Japan, our major trading partner.<br />
IncreasiLngly, Australians are rising to the challenge. I<br />
was particularly pleased on my recent visit to Japan to tell<br />
my Japanese audiences this striking fact: Australia has more<br />
students per capita learning the Japanese language in<br />
primary, secondary and tertiary education then any other<br />
country outside Japan.<br />
Do not assume from any of this, however, that my Government<br />
sees any value in the false distinction between ' trading<br />
languages' and ' community languages'. 3 419 </p>

When I launched the National Agenda for a Multicultural<br />
Australia in July 1989, 1 gave a commitment on the part of<br />
my Government to the languages and cultures of all<br />
Australians. By building on the linguistic and cultural heritages of all<br />
communities within Australia, we can help to unlock barriers<br />
to equal participation and provide access to the diverse<br />
abilities and skills of our entire population.<br />
Language can help us not only overcome barriers to trade; it<br />
can also help us improve our cultural understanding.<br />
Let us never forget this basic fact. Thanks to our<br />
Immigration policies policies that have brought to our<br />
shores people from more than 130 nations and thanks too to<br />
our deliberate adoption of policies that foster pride in our<br />
multicultural diversity, Australia is uniquely endowed with<br />
the riches of many languages.<br />
We are a vast storehouse of knowledge, due to the diversity<br />
of languages spoken in the community and to our experience<br />
in the teaching of languages of national, international and<br />
social significance.<br />
And we have built on that resource. We have led the world<br />
in the teaching of English as a second language and we have<br />
been far-sighted in recognising the advantages of a truly<br />
national language policy for social, economic and national<br />
purposes. My Friends<br />
Many countries in the world have an institute created by<br />
government to research and develop language issues.<br />
Some are ancient academies devoted to the cultivation or<br />
purification of the national language. Others are charged<br />
with the responsibility for developing a national language<br />
to replace a language inherited from the nation's former<br />
status as a colony.<br />
Still others are for conducting research, for teaching, or<br />
for public education on an aspect of language which is<br />
important in particular contexts.<br />
Such bodies reflect the priorities and the circumstances of<br />
their society. In Australia we now have our own National<br />
Languages Institute of Australia and it, naturally, reflects<br />
the issues of importance to our country.<br />
Australia has already achieved much in the field of language<br />
training. Too often, however, this effort has been<br />
uncoordinated. The Institute will have an invaluable role<br />
to play in he. lping to provide the focus needed in our<br />
national training effort.<br />
3420 </p>
<p>4.<br />
The InstiLtute, which started work in June this year, has the<br />
aim of conducting the research and teaching necessary to<br />
develop t: he whole spectrum of language education in<br />
Australia. Its mandate is Australia-wide and so too is its structure.<br />
First, it has already commenced an inquiry into the Teaching<br />
of Modern Languages in Higher Education and set up a study<br />
on Estimates of Language Teacher Employment and Supply.<br />
The findiLngs of these two projects will shape the agenda of<br />
work for the Institute for several years to come, and will<br />
also hellp determine the number of teachers we train in the<br />
appropriate languages and with the appropriate skills.<br />
Second, the Institute will run Language Testing Centres, a<br />
national data base and clearing house on languages, and four<br />
Research and Development Centres. These Centres will<br />
provide world class expertise in examining the areas of<br />
Language Acquisition Research; Language and Society;<br />
Language and Technology; and Workplace Communication.<br />
Finally, Teaching and Curriculum Centres will investigate<br />
the appropriate use of technology in language study and will<br />
enhance -the professional development of teachers, provide<br />
informatton and advisory services, administer overseas<br />
scholarships, and conduct teaching programs.<br />
There are also plans to establish an Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait I: 3lander Centre.<br />
Aboriginal languages are a priceless heritage which we are<br />
in danger of losing. When Captain Cook sailed into Botany<br />
Bay, approximately 250 languages were spoken by the original<br />
inhabitants of this country. It is estimated now that only<br />
fifty may still be spoken by children into the next century.<br />
So the Institute will contribute substantially to the growth<br />
of Austraslia as a truly multilingual nation, capable of<br />
playing -B more constructive and more closely enmeshed role<br />
in our region and the world.<br />
I congratulate and commend Mr La Bianco, his academic<br />
colleagues and all those concerned in the establishment of<br />
the Institute. I have much pleasure in formally opening the<br />
National Languages Institute of Australia and I wish it well<br />
in its endeavours. 14 2 1 </p>
