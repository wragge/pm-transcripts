ADDRESS BY THE ACTING PRIME MiNISTER, THE RT. HON. J. D. ANTHONY,<br />
M. P. AT THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE QIN SHIHUANG<br />
EXHIBITION, NATIONAL ART GALLEY OF VICTORIA, MELBOURNE, 21<br />
DECEMBER, 1983.<br />
Sir Andrew Grimwade, representatives of the ' Government of<br />
the People's Republic of China, Mr. Mathews, Mr. Kennett, Lord<br />
Mayor, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. I am very<br />
pleased to be here tonight and to have the privilege I believe<br />
it is a very real privilege of officially opening this unique<br />
exhibition. It is one of the most important staged in Australia. And it<br />
will, I am certain, have enormous impact on those who come to see<br />
it, here in Melbourne and in the other cities to which the<br />
exhibition will travel.<br />
I think very few people could fail to be stirred by the<br />
glimpse this exhibition provides of life in China 2,000 years<br />
ago, under one of the most remarkable figures of Chinese history<br />
the emperor Qin Shihuang. The exhibition vividly brings to life<br />
the culture of that period in China's history, its richness, its<br />
individuality and its artistic skill and development. Through<br />
this exhibition, we are able to learn something of a great<br />
Emperor, and a great period in China's history. In addition, we<br />
can see, in the life-size terra cotta statues that are the<br />
centrepiece of this exhibition, the faces of the people of China<br />
at that time because the faces were modelled on those of<br />
individual soldiers throughout the empire.<br />
The discovery from which this exhibition comes is one of the<br />
most remarkable in the history of archaeology. This is the first<br />
exhibition devoted exclusively to the find to travel outside<br />
China, and to allow such an important exhibition to come here is<br />
a most generous gesture by the Government of the People's<br />
Republic of China.<br />
It is most fitting, also, that this exhibition should<br />
coincide with the 10th anniversary of the establishment of<br />
diplomatic relations between Australia and China. Ten years ago,<br />
there was virtually no contact between our two countries, either<br />
at the political or private level. Our knowledge and<br />
understanding of China and the Chinese people were extremely<br />
limited. The estabiishitcent of diplomatic relations was, in a<br />
very real way, the start of a change in our perception of China<br />
and its place in the orld. To the gcod fortune of both our<br />
peoples, I think, it also came at a time when China itself was </p>
<p>z.<br />
looking to end its isolation, and assume a more active role in<br />
Sworld affairs.<br />
Today, we have significant and broadly-based relations with<br />
China. Trade is substantial, and can be expected to grow. There<br />
has been a steady growth of contracts and exchanges between<br />
Australia and China in many fields. These include agriculture,<br />
technology, science, the arts, education, journalism, legal<br />
studies, health and sport. Politically, the relationship has<br />
developed to a point where we now share many common views on<br />
important international and regional issues.<br />
Our Prime Minister has paid two visits to China, and I have<br />
also been there, in 1979. When our Prime Minister was last in<br />
Peking, he invited the Chinese Premier to visit Australia, and I<br />
am delighted that the Premicr has been able to accept. We look<br />
forward to extending a warm welcome to him when he arrives as a<br />
guest of the Australian Government next April, and I believe his<br />
visit will mark an important stage in the development of<br />
Srelations between our two countries.<br />
The process of developing those relations is also furthered<br />
by this exhibition. Two earlier Chinese exhibitions the<br />
archaeological exhibition of 1976 and last year's exhibition of<br />
Chinese classical paintings have already been highly acclaimed<br />
in Australia. I am sure this exhibition, indemnified by the<br />
Australian Government for $ 21.4 million, will win an equally warm<br />
and broad reception.<br />
Again, I thank the Government of the People's Republic of<br />
China for allowing the 10th anniversary of the establishment of<br />
diplomatic relations between our two countries to be celebrated<br />
in this way. I thank all those who have been involved in<br />
bringing this exhibition to Australia. My thanks go particularly<br />
to Mr. Jim Leslie, Chairman of the International Culture<br />
Corporation, for the corporation's role in : anaging this<br />
exhibition. They go also to Mr. George Pusack, Chairman and<br />
Managing Director of Mobil Oil Australia, which is the sole<br />
sponsor of this exhibition, as it was for the 1976 exhibition.<br />
I now have pleasure in declaring this exhibition officially<br />
open. </p>
