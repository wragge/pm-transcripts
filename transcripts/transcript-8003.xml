FOR MEDIA 17 APRIL 1990<br />
I met today with the President of the Australian Medical<br />
Association, Dr Bryce Phillips; and Sir Dennis Paterson,<br />
Head of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Adelaide<br />
Children's Hospital; and other members of the AMA to<br />
discuss the next steps in the development of the National<br />
Road Trauma Advisory Council ( NRTAC).<br />
The Council's proposal, which has the strong support of<br />
my Government and has also now received expressions of<br />
support from the States and Territories, was originally<br />
put forward to me last year by Sir Dennis. It was the<br />
subject of detailed discussion and subsequently received<br />
AMA policy endorsement as the result of Dr Phillips'<br />
efforts. The Council will have as its principal role the<br />
initiation of research and reports on means to reduce<br />
road injuries and death by improving vehicle and road<br />
safety standards, driver education and improved<br />
licensing. It will report direct to me. Its reports<br />
will be tabled in Parliament. My Government views it as<br />
an integral means of encouraging the States to adopt<br />
nationally consistent road laws, which we have put<br />
forward as part of our ' black spots' program.<br />
Dr Phillips, Sir Dennis and I have agreed that I will<br />
write to the Premiers seeking their views on the detailed<br />
workings of the Council. I will be seeking a response<br />
from Premiers in sufficient time to enable a fully<br />
developed proposal to be put on the table at the next<br />
meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council<br />
( ATAC) Ministerial meeting in late May and a meeting of<br />
Health Ministers in June. </p>
