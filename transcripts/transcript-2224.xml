COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
CAMBODIA<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
lFrom the ' Parliamentary Debates', 5 May 1970]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins Prime<br />
Minister)-by leave-For some years<br />
North Vietnamese regular forces, and other<br />
forces controlled by North Vietnam, have<br />
been withdrawing across the Cambodian<br />
border after battles in South Vietnam. The<br />
North Vietnamese have built, in Cambodia,<br />
base camps in which their forces could rest,<br />
refit, regroup, and be prepared for further<br />
military action against allied troops in<br />
South Vietnam.<br />
This military disadvantage was endured<br />
with great forbearance by United States<br />
and South Vietnamese forces-for even<br />
though the neutrality of Cambodia was<br />
being violated by the Communists, the<br />
Allies continued to hope that the protests<br />
of the Cambodian Government might lead<br />
to a cessation of the North Vietnamese<br />
invasion. This was a vain hope and since<br />
the displacement of the Sihanouk Government<br />
by the Lon Nol Government in<br />
Cambodia, North Vietnamese and forces<br />
controlled by them have extended and<br />
expanded their invasion of Cambodia's<br />
neutrality. There has been a gradually increasing<br />
violation of this neutrality-a violation<br />
which was grossly wrong in itself-which<br />
was carried out by a nation which had<br />
signed the Geneva Agreement to respect<br />
Cambodia's neutrality-and which increasingly<br />
gave a military advantage to the<br />
enemy and posed growing military danger<br />
to Allied forces in South Vietnamn.<br />
15622170 The North Vietnamese have extended<br />
westward from the bases they had been<br />
occupying. They have attacked, in<br />
Cambodia, administration centres, communications<br />
and populated areas in Eastern<br />
and South Eastern Cambodia. And along<br />
with this increasingly cynical and increasingly<br />
overt invasion, they have taken steps<br />
desiganed to create a zone in Cambodia,<br />
occupied by them, along virtually the entire<br />
length of the South Vietnamese border with<br />
Cambodia. As President Nixon pointed out,<br />
they have embarked on a programme to<br />
make Cambodia a vast enemy staging area,<br />
and a springboard for attacks on South<br />
Vietnam along 600 miles of frontier.<br />
Thzy have in fact begun a wider invasion,<br />
and embarked on a course which poses<br />
greater military dangers to Allied forces<br />
than before. This new military threat,<br />
increased in gravity, has led to South Vietnamese<br />
and United States forces taking<br />
action to protect themselves by crossing the<br />
bordcr into Cambodian Territory occupied<br />
by thc North Vietnamese. The idecision,<br />
reached by the President of the United<br />
States, was taken on operational military<br />
grounds and was designed to protect the<br />
lives of Allied servicemen.<br />
Those who condemn this decision, as the<br />
Government does not, must either argue<br />
that there has not been an increased threat<br />
to Allied forces as a result of North Vietnamese<br />
action-and this is scarcely arguable<br />
or tenable-or they must hold that it </p>
<p>does not matter whether there has been an<br />
increased threat or not-that regardless of<br />
increased danger Allied forces should be left<br />
in that danger from the flank and should<br />
not try to prevent it. We do not accept this.<br />
Our own Australian forces are not engaged<br />
in this operation and I see no prospect<br />
that they will be. But the effect of the operation<br />
could well be to make all Allied forces<br />
in South Vietnam, including our own, more<br />
safe. Our own objective for Cambodia is<br />
known. We wish to see a neutral Cambodia<br />
-a country which is not used by anyone<br />
as a base or a battleground; a country<br />
which enjoys in truth that freedom from<br />
interference, that real neutrality which it<br />
was guaranteed under the Geneva Agreement<br />
and which was breached by North<br />
Vietnam. We will try by diplomatic means to bring<br />
this about-and to bring about a method<br />
of international inspection designed to<br />
ensure that respect for the neutrality of<br />
Cambodia is real and is continuing. For let<br />
me make this clear. We do seek a Cambodia<br />
whose neutrality is respected in fact and<br />
in truth. We do not seek a Cambodia which<br />
is called neutral but which is occupied in<br />
greater or lesser part by North Vietnam.<br />
For this would be a continuance of the<br />
pretence which has prevailed. It would not<br />
mean that the neutrality of Cambodia was<br />
real. And it would mean that South Vietnam<br />
was endangered.<br />
In the Government's view this is the<br />
situation. The neutrality of Cambodia has<br />
been consistently and progressively violated<br />
by North Vietnam. The increasing tempo<br />
of the violation has posed an increasingly<br />
grave military threat to the lives of Allied<br />
servicemen. It has also, by widening and<br />
escalating the war, threatened to prolong it,<br />
and to delay vietnamisation and to delay<br />
the time when Allied forces could be<br />
withdrawn. The action taken by the United States<br />
and South Vietnam was action to protect<br />
the servicemen against attack by an enemy<br />
which was increasingly occupying a neutral<br />
nation. We understand the reason for their<br />
action and we find it odd that the Leader<br />
of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) should, on<br />
behalf of his Party, viciously criticise that<br />
action. It is worth noting, Mr Speaker, that so far as I know not one member of the<br />
Opposition, at any time, has criticised the<br />
violation of Cambodian neutrality during<br />
the last 5 years by the North Vietnamese.<br />
( Honourable members interjecting)--<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! I ask honourable<br />
members on both sides of the House<br />
to come to order. This is an important<br />
statement and I believe that the Prime<br />
Minister should be given the courtesy of<br />
being heard without interruption.<br />
Mr GORTON-There have been no<br />
claims that these Communist actions were<br />
' fatefully widening the war' or that their<br />
increasing invasion of Cambodia ought to<br />
be condemned. There were no fulminations<br />
from the Opposition against that violation<br />
of neutrality. Those were Communist<br />
actions and immune to criticism from the<br />
Opposition. But now that counter action<br />
has occurred, our Allies are criticised in<br />
the Opposition-they, we are told, have<br />
widened the war; they, we are told, have<br />
engaged in escalation; they are in the wrong<br />
now that this has happened.<br />
Sir, such comments I believe are support<br />
for the theory that Communist forces should<br />
be allowed to operate as and when they<br />
like; that they should be excused for<br />
invading and occupying neutral countries;<br />
and that it is wrong for action to be taken<br />
to stop them and that such comments by<br />
giving that support, to me, Sir, show a<br />
willingness, even a desire, to accept defeat<br />
or surrender of Allied forces in South<br />
Vietnam. I can understand-though strongly disagree<br />
with but I can understand-those who<br />
wish to surrender in Vietnam, and abandon<br />
the South Vietnamese, and let aggression<br />
succeed. But I cannot understand those who,<br />
while the struggle continues, are prepared<br />
to subject Allied forces to military threat<br />
and to endanger the lives of soldiers in<br />
action. We entirely reject this attitude. We<br />
will continue to work for a truly neutral<br />
Cambodia by all means we can. But we will<br />
not excuse our enemies and attack our<br />
Allies in our joint endeavours to bring<br />
peace and self-government to South Vietname<br />
in the way the Opposition has done.<br />
I present the following paper:<br />
