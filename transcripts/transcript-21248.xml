    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit the United States on 2-4 June, the United Kingdom on 5 June and France on 6 June. The visit will be an important opportunity to consult on major international issues such as the war against terrorism and Iraq.  In the United States I will also lobby key Congressional leaders for early passage through Congress of the Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>  In Washington, I will meet President Bush and senior members of his Cabinet. A key focus of our discussions will be on our shared commitment to the future of Iraq with   less than one month to go before the transfer of sovereignty there. I will also consult on the challenges ahead as we confront together the threat of global terrorism.</p>
<p> With key Congressional votes on our Free Trade Agreement with the United States likely in June, I will meet senior Congressional leaders to advocate the strong mutual gains from the enhanced integration of our two economies which result from the Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p> Following my meetings in Washington, I will make a short visit to London to hold discussions with Prime Minister Blair over a working lunch on Saturday 5 June.</p>
<p> I will then travel to Normandy at the invitation of President Chirac to take part in the official commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings.  I will be joined there by a small group of Australian veterans who contributed personally to those historic events which marked the beginning of the end of the Second World War.  The ceremonies will be attended by a wide range of international leaders, including from Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Russia, as well as from France, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Her Majesty The Queen will also attend.   </p>
