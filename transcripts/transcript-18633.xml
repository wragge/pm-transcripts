PM: Thank you very much, and it is a great pleasure to join President Lee and colleagues and friends for this very special event.</p>
<p>Australia is here because we share a vision of a world where growth can be greener, where we continue to see economic growth, and see the benefits of prosperity, but where we no longer have to see economic growth at the price of more and more carbon and more and more pollution and degradation of our environment.</p>
<p>I'm also here because we are a good friend of Korea, and I wanted to pay a special tribute to the leadership of President Lee that has brought us to this moment.</p>
<p>Without his leadership, passion and enthusiasm for this project, we would not be here.</p>
<p>This has been brought together very carefully, but also very quickly.</p>
<p>An organisation that has started to function, now becoming an international organisation today.</p>
<p>President Lee is a good friend of my country, but I believe, in initiating this Global Green Growth Initiative, he will be remembered as a friend of the entire world.</p>
<p>This is a major legacy from his presidency of Korea, and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him.</p>
<p>It's been a pleasure to be involved in the start of this organisation, and I look forward to Australia being involved as it goes from strength to strength.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
