PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE: BLAIR HOUSE<br />
WASHINGTON Prime Minister<br />
I would like to say at the outset that there have been very useful and<br />
productive discussions with the President, with Secretary of State Vance,<br />
and Deputy Secretary of Defence. Those discussion. I believe have shown<br />
the remarkable identity of view and of interest in the recent events that have<br />
emerged in Afghanistan and in relation to Iran..<br />
Australia believes that this does represent a very serious and a very<br />
dangerous situation. We believe that there is a long haul ahead of all<br />
independently-minded countries, of which the United States of course is in the<br />
lead and foremost, and that there is a long haul ahead of us that could extend<br />
over a number of years. We are in a different environment. Maybe what has<br />
happened in Afghanistan has made us all see the Soviet Union in its aggressive<br />
acts more plainly than was the case before. In this new environment it is our<br />
view that we need a collective determination on the part of as many independentlyminded<br />
countries as possible to make sure that a recurrence of the kind of<br />
events that have occurred in Afghanistan will not be with us. These are matters<br />
of great and fundamental importance. That of course is why I am here, with the<br />
full authority of the Australian Cabinet, to discuss these matters with the<br />
President, to go on for discussions in the United Kingdom, in Bonn and in Paris.<br />
I believe that it is important for a country such as Australia to have the<br />
clearest possible understanding of the views of the major countries7 and of this<br />
country in particular-as an assistance, and a necessary ingredient, in our own<br />
future policy determination. I must say that I am delighted with what I have<br />
seen in the United States, of United States intentions in what has happened<br />
in recent weeks.<br />
Wecioi. Australia, from our perspective, believe that it is very important that<br />
the United States stand against agression and in this case, take a very strong<br />
position against what the Soviet Union has done in Afghanistan. That has occurred.<br />
The United States actions stand clear. The President has made a necessary and<br />
enormously important statement in the State of the Union message which spelt out<br />
in clear terms the interests and intentions of the United States. Now that<br />
has provided a lead to many other countries, and it has given confidence to many<br />
other countries. This again, I believe, will help in establishing a collective<br />
will, a collective determination, which will establish an environment which<br />
will be designed to deter the Soviets from pursuing any further Aighanistans.<br />
In the Australian view, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan does establish a more<br />
dangerous situation than that-. which prevailed in Berlin, or Cuba, or Korea, in<br />
earlier times. All of those challenges ' to~ ithe. Western world were important. They<br />
represented an ideological challenge. They were also events of great regional<br />
significance. Those ingredients are very much present in the circumstances of<br />
Afghanistan. But beyond that, in Afghanistan there is a further ingredient:<br />
possession of A'fghanistan by the Soviet Union, the presence of their forces there,<br />
is likely to open up opportunities in the future for a move through Iran, perhaps,<br />
gaining an influence or a control over a part of Middle East oil. If that were to<br />

Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
occur, the Soviet Union would gain an enormous weapon which could severely<br />
damage or even destroy many advanced industrial economies, many economies,<br />
right around the world. That is an added ingredient that was not present<br />
in relation to the Berlin blockade, the Korean War, or the Cuban missile incident.<br />
For these reasons, Australia takes a very serious view about it indeed.<br />
Quite plainly, what 14 million people can do in these circumstances is limited.<br />
But we take the view that if a country has a view, as we have, we ought to state<br />
it, and to the extent that we can, we ought to act upon it. We take the view<br />
that it is not good enough to sit back and wait until everyone else has acted,<br />
because if every nation does that nobody will act. The United States which has,<br />
could well be left standing alone. Leadership of the independent nations of<br />
the world is an awesome responsibility. I believe that the Presidency of this<br />
nation, of the United States, is clearly the toughest and the hardest job in the<br />
world, that there must be many times when it was also the loneliest job in the<br />
world. I would believe on these occasions that not only the United States' President,<br />
but the American people might like to know that there are other governments and<br />
people that have a very similar view to their own about the importance of<br />
certain events. I do carry that message from my own Cabinet, and from the vast<br />
majority of the Australian people, who would share with the people of this<br />
nation. a very common concern about events in Afghanistan.<br />
There are other elements of course, in that particular invasion. it was a<br />
non-aligned country. : That offers something of a warning to many nations around<br />
the world who might have thought that the position of a non-aligned status<br />
would give them immunity from this kind of aggression. It, of course, is the<br />
first time there has been an invasion outside the accepted area of the Soviet power<br />
bloc. Those are also two additional reasons which cause us to re-assess the<br />
circumstances and the strategic environment in which we live.<br />
In addition to these matters, the'Ptesident of course has had to deal in a firm<br />
way with the enormously difficult and tragic problem of the hostages in Iran.<br />
I would like to, on this public occasion, extend to the President not only my<br />
own sympathy and the sympathy of the Government and the Australian people. but<br />
extend that sympathy to all the people of the United States for what they have' had<br />
to endure during the period in which some of their own citizens have been held<br />
hostage. We are obviously delighted, as everyone must be, that a small number<br />
of hostages have been able to get out of Iran and that Canada has been able to<br />
help and be of assistance in that. I think that was wonderful news. We will all<br />
be looking forward to the day when all those hostages are released safely, just as<br />
eagerly I believe, as will the people of the United States. Our sympathy and<br />
support goes to the President the United States people in that particular instance.<br />
We have taken a number of decisions on our own account, of which I informed the<br />
President today. I said that I thought that we were now in a changed strategic<br />
environment. That has some consequences. A little while ago we offered to the<br />
United States to take on greater responsibilities for patrolling and surveillance<br />
in the Indian Ocean. That has been very warmly accepted by the United States.<br />
Officials of our defence departments and defence forces will be consulting together<br />
quite urgently to work out the best way in which that can be encompassed. ./ 3 </p>
<p>PRESS CONFERENCE: BLAIR HOUSE -3-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
It is likely that there will be a requirement for greater use of staging<br />
facilities through Australia. It is likely that there will be a requirement<br />
for greater joint exercises between United States and Australian forces.<br />
We will be looking forward to doing everything we can to assist in those<br />
particular measures if the need arises.<br />
We have already authorised a review of our own defence expenditure. I can only<br />
say in.-the circumstances it is highly likely that the Government will accept<br />
an increased requirement for additional defence in Australia.<br />
We have also made a decision to offer to consult with and provide additional<br />
co-operation with our regional partners in relation to some of these matters,<br />
but that is something that we would need to discuss very closely with them.<br />
We are going to provide additional civil aid in the South Pacific. There are<br />
a number of small and fragile economies in the South Pacific, new nations,<br />
island states, and I think it is important that collectively we do what we<br />
can to achieve a greater rate of advancement in their own economies. This,<br />
again, is in part a response to the changed environment that we are in.<br />
Over the last three years our civil aid to countries of the Pacific has grown<br />
very greatly, but we had made a decision in principle a week or two ago to provide<br />
additional support and additional aid. I informed the President of that.<br />
We expect there will be early discussions between defence personnel of the<br />
United States and of Australia to work out the defence matters between us. We<br />
also discussed a greater co-operation in coal and shale oil technology. Both<br />
of us will be reviewing the opportunities for more co-operation in those areas<br />
which are of an obvious importance in the current energy crisis.<br />
We also jointly agreed that there is a need to seek by all means of which we<br />
are capable, to do more to assist the economic take -off in third world economies.<br />
That represents a continuing and pressing problem which must be of concern to<br />
many nations. In the environment, aswe move florward through the 809, 1 think it will<br />
be important to try and achieve a greater rate of progress than might have occurred<br />
in past years.<br />
It is now open to you for questions. 4 </p>

PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT THURSDAY, 31 JANUARY 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER' S PRESS CONFERENCE: BLAIR HOUSE<br />
QUESTIONS Question Prime Minister, the State Department told us that Australia has been helpful<br />
to the Americans in the case of the hostages in Tehran. Can you reveal what<br />
Australia has done, what Australia is doing to help the Americans?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. We have not been part of the release of the hostages which were assisted<br />
through the Canadian Embassy. I am not saying we would not have been helpful,<br />
but the plain fact remains that was something which was arranged by the<br />
United States and the Canadians.<br />
Question Is Australia taking part in negotiations perhaps on behalf of the Americans,<br />
with the Revolutionary Council of the Iranian Government?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
On the geseral question of hostages, we have sought to be helpful, and if through<br />
exchanges in communications there is anything that we can do, of course<br />
we will. I had thought that your question was related to the release of the<br />
six hostages. I might have misunderstood it in the first instance. But I<br />
cannot go into the details of the way in which Australia from time to time might<br />
be a channel of communication in that particular matter.<br />
Question Can you say whether. our Ambassador is involved?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. I do not think it would be helpful to pursue it.<br />
Question Prime Minister, could you explain at all your mention of a larger role for<br />
Australia in the IndianO~ ean. When will the talks on what you are going to<br />
do begin, and will you actually put ships into the Indian Okean? </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
Well, we have ships in the Indian Ocean and we have our Orion maritime<br />
surveillance aircraft patrolling around Australia. They obviously now<br />
patrol some aspects of the Indian Ocean. What we have said is that we<br />
are prepared to do more, and that might involve ships. It could involve<br />
aircraft. It could involve ship visits. our defence people have to work<br />
out the best way our increased effort can be accommodated within the total<br />
overall objective. Now, I hope they will both get down to it. and do it as quickly<br />
as possible, but we are prepared to act upon it just as soon as our defence<br />
people can come to their decisions about the best way of doing it.<br />
Question What is the size of your naval presence there now?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh, it would vary. It is obviously small compared to your navy. We have<br />
established a major new naval facility on the coast of Western Australia<br />
which would have, the capacity ' of being used much more than has been the case.<br />
When I was Defence Minister ten years ago we agreed that that facility<br />
would be available for the use of United States ships if they wanted it.,<br />
as they have used other Australian facilities from time to time.<br />
The numbers of ships that we would have in the Indian Ocean varies, but we<br />
have obligations in South East Asia and also in the Pacific. It is not only<br />
an Indian Ocean matter that we look at.<br />
Quest ion<br />
Where-.-. are the facilities sir?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
At Cockburn Sound, south ' of Perth, Western : Australia. It is A major new naval<br />
facility that has been constructed over recent years.<br />
Question<br />
Was-the question of providing home base facilities for the American Navy<br />
discussed at all?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is too early to go into details of what might happen, what sort of facilities<br />
might be required. What is most likely is staging facilities for onward transport<br />
through Australia to other parts. The United States, I understand, is firming up<br />
its own requirement over the next few weeks and after that would be able to<br />
speak to us with more precision than they were able to do today.<br />
Question Prime Minister, on the question of the hostages, just to clear that up, are<br />
we channelling coimunications from the United States to the,. Iranian Government?<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh~ look, there have been some communications as I understand it. If we can<br />
be helpful because we have our Embassy in Tehran, we would certainly want to be.<br />
But I do not really want to say more than that.<br />
Question Prime Minister, did you discuss the Westinghouse Case and the application of<br />
anti-trust laws?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. We did not discuss bilateral matters of that kind.<br />
Question Prime Minister, did you seek anything specific from the President? Did you<br />
ask him, for example, to take tougher sanctions against the Russians, or did<br />
you specifically seek a greater American presence in the Indian Ocean?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is no need to seek a greater American presence in the Indian Ocean,<br />
because that greater presence is there. That decision has been made. What<br />
we how have to do is to seek to accommodate a greater effort by Australia<br />
into that and work out the best way it can contribute to a total effort.. In addition,<br />
of course, the United States is undertaking long-term planning and so must we.<br />
That is where the review of our own expenditures would be highly relevant.<br />
Quest ion<br />
What about the question of further economic sanctions against the Soviet Union?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. That question did not arise. In talks with Secretary Vance, I mentioned<br />
the fact that we had frozen the exports of some materials, raw materials, to the<br />
Soviet Union, pending an examination of the matter by the Australian Government.<br />
our officials will be discussing what is called the COCOM list, which is broadly<br />
a high-technology list of exports which European countries and the United States<br />
broadly refrain from exporting to the Soviet Union. But it also has some<br />
strategic materials on that list. Our officials will be consulting together<br />
to see whether it is possible to get to an agreed position in relation to it.<br />
That would obviously seem to make much more sense. Now, those discussions will<br />
take place and there will be a report to the Government as a result.<br />
Question Prime Minister, one more question from me. There ire-still four U. S. Embassy<br />
people unaccounted for in Tehran. Is there any possibility that they are at<br />
our Embassy or that we know anything about them?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have absolutely no knowlege of that whatsoever. / 17 </p>
<p>PRESS CONFERENCE: BLAIR HOUSE -7-<br />
Question Prime Minister, in relationship to your statement on the great collective<br />
effort in the region around Australia, does this imply that you might be<br />
thinking of re-fashioningci..-alliances such as ANZUS, SEATO, or<br />
even encouraging talks with NATO powers to create a new form of defence alliance<br />
independently of the United States?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do not think it is a question of forming new defence alliances. Recent<br />
events have re-established in stark terms the relevance of the ANZUS alliance,<br />
and that is obviously important so far as we are concerned. But when I<br />
meant collective determination I was not talking just about our own region. I<br />
believe there needs to be a collective determination amongst all those nations<br />
that have a concern for the* independence of nations, for the right of nations<br />
to govern themselves. Unless we can exhibit that collective determiination,<br />
I believe we face a difficult and serious time ahead of us, for reasons which<br />
I would have made plain to you. This . can-' emerge, and I would hope will emerge,<br />
through the decisions of nations, through the attitudes they take, through their<br />
own determination and through their own will. This is what it is really all<br />
about, the will and the determation.<br />
Question On the Olympic Games, if President Carter does announce on the 20th or 21st<br />
of February that the United States will not participate in the Moscow Olympics,<br />
will the Australian Government follow suit by boycotting the Games and take necessary<br />
measures to ensure that Australian sportsmen do not participate in<br />
the Moscow Games?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Our own position at this point is I thiink identical with that of the United<br />
States. Our own -Olympic Comm~ ittee has undertaken to put our view to the<br />
International Olympic Committee and after that there will obviously be discussions<br />
between the Olympic Committee and the Australian Government. But let me only say<br />
I believe an effective boycott of the Olympic Games is one thing that would bring<br />
home to the Soviet Union and to the Russian people, more starkly than anything<br />
else, the determination of the world outside the Soviet influence to demonstrate<br />
their opposition and abhorrence of their invasion of Afghanistan. It is Possible<br />
for the Russian Government to hide the impact of sanctions from-their own people<br />
for quite some time. But it is not possible for them to hide the impact of<br />
an effective boycott of the Olympic Games. They plainly want the Olympic Games<br />
to be a major public relations success within the Soviet Union, with the athletes<br />
of all countries going to Moscow and as it were, paying homage to the Soviet Ufiion<br />
through their presence at the Olympic Games. ' It is the strong view of the<br />
Australian Government that this is not the appropriate time for athletes of the<br />
free world, of the independent world, to be doing that.* It is all very well for<br />
people to say that politics and sport shouild be kept separate. But the Soviet<br />
Union does not do that. For a very, very long while, there have been a number of<br />
governments that have virtually made sport, and for that matter cultural affairs<br />
an extension of their own government's personality. They involve the two together. </p>
<p>PRESS CONFERENCE: BLAIR HOUSE -8-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
In other areas, South Africa introduced apartheid into sport, introduced<br />
political elements into sporting events. It is no good now people, after that,<br />
coming and saying that politics and sport should be kept separate. There was<br />
an attempt made to do that years ago. It proved quite impossible. The<br />
Government has also expressed the view in the longer term that the best way<br />
of preserving the spirit and the ideal of the Olympic Games, which is important,<br />
and free from political influence, might well be to have a permanent Olympic<br />
centre established in Greece.<br />
Question Prime Minister, can I followup on the previoust question about regional co-operation.<br />
you referred to the necessity for consultations about greater co-operation<br />
with our regional partners, can you say which countries you particularly have<br />
in mind, and.. what sort of level those conversations will be at, anid what<br />
sort of areas for greater co-operation you envisage.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The consultations will bei~ th Australia's traditional regional partners.<br />
in South East Asia; Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines,<br />
are the traditional five, in a sense. But we have very close relationships<br />
with Papua New Guinea as well, and other countries close to us.<br />
Qu! est-ion<br />
New Zealand?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Consultations with New Zealand are always very close. The relationship is<br />
as one would expect. We co-operate and consult on all important matters between<br />
us. Consultations will be taking place on an official level. Then we will see<br />
whether some decisions are necessary.<br />
Quest ion<br />
Prime Minister, is Australia trying to convince other nations to join the<br />
boycott, and what are the prospects that the number will grow?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, the number seems to be growing. There seems to me to be greater international<br />
support for the boycott almost daily. Our Foreign K4nister, Andrew-Peacock, has<br />
been travelling through the five ASEAN countries and India and Pakistan and<br />
discussing with them Australian concerns with current problems. Just as I<br />
am discussing these matters with the President here, and with-Prime Minister Thatcher,<br />
and in France and Germany, so too, he is having a full exchange of views with<br />
those other countries. Then we will be as best advised as we can be from our<br />
regional partners and friends, as well as from the nations which are the major<br />
determinants of what happens. in these matters. That of course, in current<br />
circumstances, I regard as quite vital. in the formation of our own future policies.<br />
9 </p>
<p>PRESS CONFERENCE: BLAIR HOUSE -9-<br />
Qu! estion<br />
Prime Minister, did you and the President discuss Australia as a possible<br />
site for an alternative Games?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. We did not.<br />
Quston Do you feel that the grain embargo has been an effective tool against the<br />
Soviet Union?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think there are some signs that it is being an effective tool, and I certainly<br />
would hope that it is. Australia, as you know, is co-operating in that, and in<br />
a number of other measures. Senator Glenn made a statement in the Senate<br />
yesterday commuenting upon the decisions that Australia has made up to this<br />
point. It might be worthwhile getting a copy of his remarks in the Congressional<br />
Record. Question Piime Minister, what sort of strategic assessments did the President give you<br />
of the consequences South West Asia of the Soviet invasion. In particular,<br />
did he give you any hard intelligence or other information that might suggest<br />
that the Soviet Mhion has designs on Iran or other countries in the region?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is.: a full exchange of intelligence information and views between the<br />
United States and Australia. : That goes on on a continuing basis. I believe that<br />
the assessments of the importance of what has happened are-very similar; the<br />
assessment in the United States and the assessment in Australia. I do not think<br />
there are any significant differences between them. I have said in Australia that<br />
I do not believe there is a grand design by the Soviet Union in terms Of<br />
having made a decision to move ' a fixed timetable; to do one thing and then<br />
to take a second step six months or twelve months later. But I have always believed<br />
that, motivated by their coimmunist ideology, that the Soviet Union will take<br />
advantage of an opportunity if an opportunity arises, or if an opportunity can<br />
be created. That, of course, is the danger of the Soviet presence in Afghanistan,<br />
because opportunities could arise in relation to fran or Ikkistan, or could be<br />
created in relation to one or the other or to both. That creates a new and<br />
sensitive, and highly dangerous situation. The President's Staste of the Union<br />
message was very much needed. I also believe that it was a statement of great<br />
strength which deserves the respect and support of countries such as Australia,<br />
indeed of all nations that are concerned for their own independence. </p>
<p>PRESS CONFERENCE: BLAIR HOUSE 10<br />
QuestLion So you are really relying largely on supposition-as to what the Soviet'.:<br />
intentions might be rather than any intelligence or<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. We are not relying on supposition at all. We are relying on the total<br />
and long history of communist expansion. That gives you very good empirical<br />
evidence. The pattern of their behaviour in the past has been demonstrated<br />
in recent weeks to be the pattern of their behaviour in the present. We have<br />
no evidence of any kind to indicate that their ' pattern of behaviour in the<br />
future is likely to change into more peaceful directions.<br />
QuestLion How long do you think it will be before the Australian Olympic Committee reaches<br />
a decision on a boycott. Are you concerned that a decision has not already been taken?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would have preferred that they had made the kind of decision that the United<br />
States Olympic Committee has. They, I know, respect the Government's view<br />
in relation to this, and I believe will argue the Governiment's view strongly<br />
when they present that to the International Olympic Committee. So let's wait<br />
and see what happens after that.<br />
Quest ion<br />
Prime Minister, you came half around the world to today's talks. What would you<br />
say you have accomplished of importance?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think they have demonstrated in this instance, a very Close identity of interest<br />
between the United States and Australia. They have identified a pretty common<br />
assessment of the dangers that are faced, and they have clarified the kinds of<br />
things that we can do in our own region.. in~ broad general support of the initiatives<br />
that the United States has taken. They have certainly given Mr. MacKellar<br />
is with me and the'ciffidials and myself a much better insight into United States<br />
thinking-than you can achieve through normal cables and reporting, through<br />
normal official channels. Being able to talk with your counterparts is always<br />
highly relevant and I believe vastly important.<br />
Question<br />
Wbea you itnounced.? your-inte! ntibn. to comechere*,' you-were reported as intending to<br />
put pressure on President Carter to take a tougher stand. Sjnqe then, the purpose<br />
of the visit appears to have changed to a display of moral support and an explanation<br />
of Australia's actions. Were you accurately reported initially, and if so, what<br />
has happened in the meantime to change the purpose of the visit?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, if I commented on every speculative report I would never stop commenting.<br />
w </p>
<p>000---<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE: BLAIR HOUSE 11<br />
Question The report wasrfbased on. highly-Llaced sources.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It appears that some of your colleagues know what that term sometimes means.<br />
" Highly-placed sources' is an interpretation. It does not really say what<br />
those sources are. No. It would have been impertinent to suggest that I was<br />
coming here to put pressure on the President of the United States. I stated<br />
from the outset quite plainly There was no need for interpretation because<br />
I stated what the purpose was: to have an exchange of views on matters of<br />
great importance to Australia and of great importance to other countries; to<br />
put my government in the best possible position to take the most responsible<br />
and sensible decisions in the future about our own Australian and regional<br />
security. Now the discussions here do not need any other purpose than that.<br />
That was the purpose and that has been fulfilled, as I believe in a very adequqte<br />
way. in the discussions~ that have taken place this morning and this afternoon.<br />
Question As a result of these talks, do you hope that in future the adminstration<br />
will be more sympathetic to the Australian Government's viewpoint on issues such<br />
as the Westinghouse Case.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They are legal matters. I think you need to go to lawyers for that sort<br />
of thing. </p>
