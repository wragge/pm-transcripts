FOR PRESS BRAR<br />
P. M. No. 59/ 1967<br />
MIDDLE EAST<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. John McEwen<br />
Australia, in common with practically the whole world,<br />
welcomes the action which the Security Council has now unanimously<br />
taken in calling for a cessation of all warlike activities in the Middle<br />
East. We earnestly hope that it will now become possible for<br />
the United Nations to take an active and effective part in bringing about<br />
an enduring settlement of the problems of the region and ensure the<br />
freedom and security of the member states of the United Nations, which<br />
have been involved.<br />
CANBERRA, 7th June, 1967. </p>
