NEW GUINEA TOUR 1970<br />
NEW STEPS TOWARDS SELF -GOVERNrMENTr IN PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA<br />
peech y the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
at Papua Hotel, Port Moresby<br />
S6 JULY 1970<br />
"~ 4fYo onour, Members of the Administrator's Executive Council,<br />
Distinguishd guests, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I think that the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and the other islan 1i<br />
which at the moment make up the whole, faces a most difficult period in its evolution<br />
towards: self-government in the future and towards independence. We have reacael<br />
a stage of political development inside the Territory at which there are vocal dem'nds<br />
for progress, or at least demands for changes in various fields. But such changes<br />
are probably more difficult in this Territory than in . ay other area of which I can<br />
think. We have here in Papua and New Guinea and then across areas of sea<br />
other islands which, as I said, at the moment make ui a whole, We have ' 7erritory<br />
composed of what are virtually different races, with different languages, with<br />
different district loyalties and we have aTerritory in which some areas are<br />
clamouring for quicker advancement towards self-government and ind-ependence and<br />
other areas are fearful that the advance is already too swift. And we have a<br />
Territory, and I look to the future, which of its very nature is liable to be suoLwct<br />
to the dangers of fragmentation.<br />
Those dangers stem partly from different languages, partly from different<br />
outlook, partly from different stages of development. They can be reinforced by<br />
fallacious argument that if some part of Territory is fortunate enough to discover,<br />
for example, a copper mine then it would be better off by itself. And if this<br />
fallacious argument, and I believe it is a fallacious argument, is accepted thien at<br />
some stage there would be that fragmentation. If oil were discovered in Pap la<br />
there could be a danger of fragmentation there, and so it would go on ultimately,<br />
I am sure, to the detriment of all the people of the Territory which we would like<br />
to see advance as a unit towards nationhood. Talking of advancing as a unit<br />
towards nationhood there have been, sir, as you have said I think, great advances<br />
made economically and politically in the Territory since the Second World War.<br />
I think the time has come for further advances to be made alona tr at<br />
road. I do not speak of self-government in 1972 or in any calendar year that you<br />
may care to mention, because you are on a road towards sell-government. You<br />
have started on it. There will necessarily be progress along it step by step and<br />
anyone who seeks to say that at a given month at a given year a period will have<br />
been reached when that can be achieved is, I think, dangerously simplifying the<br />
problem and is acting to the detriment of the people for the future. / 2 </p>
<p>But there are further steps now short of self-government but towards<br />
self-government which I feel should be made and these I wish to outline to you<br />
tonight. We believe that the time has come when less should be referred to<br />
Canberra for decision and more should be retained for decision by the Administrator's<br />
Executive Council and by the Ministerial Members who for the most part make up<br />
that Council. What we suggest is this that there should be negotiated between the<br />
Australian Government and the Government here, a sum of money for recurrent<br />
expenses and for minor works inside the Territory. And, speaking for the Australian<br />
Government, we would expect that there would be more effort on the part of the<br />
local peoples to raise revenue inside this Territory, as years go by for the purpose<br />
of this recurrent expenditure and these minor works. But once this sum of money<br />
had been negotiated, made up partly by local revenue, partly by what we will call a<br />
grant-in-aid for these purposes from the Commonwealth, then that sum of money,<br />
we believe, should be divided by the Administrator's Executive Council among the<br />
various Ministries up here which will put in claims in the way Ministers put in<br />
claims to the Cabinet in Canberra.<br />
So there will be a claim from the Minister of Education, there will be a<br />
claim from the Minister of Health, there will be a claim from the Minister of<br />
Public Works, and the Administrator's Executive Coun~ cil within the sum of money<br />
available to it will apportion to these various Ministers the Sums that they can<br />
spend. When that has been done, when a Minister, let us say, of Education, has<br />
received a sum within the total limits then we believe that he should have authority<br />
as to how that money should be spenit in the Territory, should be able to make<br />
decisions here which now require reference to Canberra before they can be made.<br />
If h&amp; has a new programme, he will need to get the agreement of the<br />
Administrator's Executive Council. If, as is not unknown inpuclitical circles in<br />
Canberra, he wishes to get more money in the course of the year for his own<br />
portfolio at the expense of somebody else's portfolio and that is the only way he<br />
will get it, he won't get -i* t by additional grant from Australia then the<br />
Administrator s &amp; ecutive Council car, listen to the pleas of th-e two Ministers<br />
concerned and, as a council, can decide what should be done.<br />
This, I think, will be a great transference, not so much of power, but<br />
of administrative power to the elected Members who are Ministerial ! rnzbers in<br />
this Teiritory and to the Administrator's Executive Council. As there is to be this<br />
transference of power and in future, no doubt, other transf,-erences of power, so<br />
concomitant with it will there need to be an assumption of res-ponsib ility by the<br />
Ministerial Members and the House of Assembly in Papua and New Guinea. If<br />
there is a requirement for more money to be provided than has been provided by<br />
the existing level of local taxes, and vwhat the Australian Government is prepared<br />
to provide by a grant-in-aid, then that's fine. It can be provided if the House of<br />
Assembly up here is prepared to impose the taxes required to raise it in the same<br />
way as the Government of Australia has to impose the taxes required to provide<br />
what it wants to do. I hope you won't read into what I have just said any suggestion<br />
that Australian aid will cease for Papua and New Guinea. Of course it won't,<br />
but I hope you will read into it a realisation that as power is transferred so also<br />
must responsibility be transferred and these two things go hand in hand.<br />
That is the first proposition we will make. We will have in the<br />
Australian B udget a negotiated a mount of money for the Territory called a / 3 </p>
<p>" tgrant-in-aid" added to the sum of money raised by the decision of the local House<br />
in tL~ e number of taxes they propose to impose, and the rate off taxes they propose<br />
to impose, and that will be left to division among the Ministries by the Administrator's<br />
Executive Council and for spending by the Ministerial Members concerned.<br />
We will have also in the Australian Budget a development grant. That<br />
development grant for the general development of Papua and New Guinea Territories<br />
will remain with, and be negotited, of course, by the Australian Government and<br />
the Government up here, but its expenditure, since it will be provided entirely by<br />
the Australian taxpayer, virtually entirely, will remain the responsibility of the<br />
Australian Government. In other words, we will want to see that a general<br />
development grant is expended on those projects for which it is voted, and we<br />
will want to overseee that it is properly expended on those projects.<br />
We propose, this is just a mater I suppose of presentation too, that<br />
in future we would have on our Australian Budget an item which is to pay all the<br />
overseas allowances of expatriate and overseas officers so that everyone can see<br />
that this comes from the Australian taxpayer and from what Is provided inside<br />
Australia, and not from what is provided in the Territory. The base rates of<br />
jiublic oervants from the Territory and from Australia can of course be the same,<br />
but I think it is essential that people should know that the additional allowances paid<br />
do come from the Australian taxpayer, are shown in the Australian Budget and<br />
are paid to expatriate officers.<br />
We have had it brought to our attention that there Is fear in the<br />
Territory amongst responsible people that key public servants may be lost to the<br />
future service of this Territory because, if they are expatriate officers, they have<br />
an insecurity of tenure. A man of 40 or 45 may reach a point where he has a<br />
family to educate, responsibilities to take on, and where he says to himself<br />
" Should I remain in the Service of the Territory, either as a Member of the<br />
New Guiuea/ Papua service or as a contract oficer? Should I continue in this or<br />
should 1, because I do not know what the future holds for me in case self-government<br />
or independence comes, should I at this stage begin to carve some new career for<br />
myself". And it has been put to us that a number of key public servants, I mean<br />
d istrict officers, professional officers, sub-professional oYfficers and technical<br />
officers, either have resigned or may in the future resign because they do not<br />
know what would happen to them when self-government or independence comes.<br />
It has been put to us that this poses a danger to the future development<br />
of Papua and New Guinea. because these people and their accumulated experience<br />
are going to be required when self-government comes or independence comes.<br />
And so we have decided to do this. In order to encourage selected key overseas<br />
officers to remain in the service of Papua and New Guinea for the present and<br />
future good of the Territory, we propose that those who are permanent officers<br />
of the Papua and New Guinea Public Service, some of those who are permanent<br />
officers of the Papua and New Guinea Public Service, and some of those who are<br />
contract officers, will be offered enlistment in a new Australian-based service.<br />
Offers of engagements in this new service ( and it will be a selective serv ice),<br />
offers of engagement now and in the future will be made to the selected key<br />
Administrative officers of whom I have spoken, but acceptance of such an offer<br />
will be entirely woluntary on the part of any such officers and offers of selection<br />
will be decided by the Administration. 4 / 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
At the moment we believe the ceiling of this new Commonwealth based<br />
service should be approximately 1, 000. It will be additional to the existing<br />
arrange~ aents under which officers serve in the permanent service here or in<br />
which they serve as contract officers. That is to say permanent officers who<br />
are riot appointed to the new service will continue as they are at present, losing<br />
nothing of what they have achieved. Contract officers who are not offered<br />
appointment will continue on their existing contracts. But appointments to the<br />
new Service will carry a guarantee by the Australian Government that a memier<br />
appointed will be assured of continued employment in the Public Service of Papua<br />
and New Guinea or in the event that he is transferred from that, or displaced from<br />
that, in the future, there will be a guarantee that the Commonwealth Government<br />
will place him in permanent employment in a like field on a comparable salary.<br />
This, we hope, will enable many officers to resolve the dilemmna in which perhaps<br />
they are at present placed, and will enable them to decide to make their accumulated<br />
experience available to the Government of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea<br />
while at the same time retaining full confidence in their ownM future and in their<br />
own future employment. Before the details of this approach are settled, overseas<br />
officers themselves will be consulted throughout the Territory, as will the Public<br />
Service Association. But that is another step which we propose to make which we<br />
think will be of assistance to the development of this country i the future and<br />
which so many people in this Territory have urged us in one way or another to do.<br />
We propose that the Administrator's Executive Council, as a result<br />
of the new responsibilities which it assumes, will have a spokesman for that<br />
Council appointed in the House of Assembly to answer questions as to what the<br />
Administrator's Executive Council has done and why it has done it. And we also<br />
propose that the Parliament of Australia will not exercise its veto power in<br />
relation to ordinances if those ordinances affect the actual res-, onsibilities handed<br />
over to Ministerial Members,<br />
Now let me indicate to you the kinds of areas in which we feel<br />
responsibility shotild be taken by Ministerial Members here and the kinds of areas<br />
in which we feel the Commonwealth of Australia should continue to exercise its<br />
present authority. There will be delivered later by my colleague, the Minister<br />
for Eaernal Territories, in more detail but for the moment the subjects on which<br />
we thin-k that authority to take decisions should reside in the Ministerial Members<br />
or the Administrator's Executive Council are educatio; r. l primary, secondary,<br />
technical, but not tertiary public health, tourism, co-operatives, business<br />
advisory services, workers' compensation, industrial training, posts and<br />
telegraphs, Territory revenue including taxation ( for inherent in what I have<br />
said is the need foc the House of Assembly to take greater responsibility in the<br />
levying of revenue in this Territory), price control, coastal shipping, civil defence,<br />
corrective institutions ( that's prisons in case anybody's wondering), registration<br />
of customary land, land use, leasing of land and town planning and urban<br />
development. The areas in which we wish and must at this stage retain final authority<br />
are the judiciary, the enfor cement of law and order, internal security, external<br />
affairs, external trade and large scale development projects in agriculture, in<br />
transport, forestry, in those things in the five-year development plan which we<br />
are now some half-way through and which will for the most part be financed by the<br />
Australian taxpayer and therefore overseen by the representatives of the Australian<br />
taxpayer rather than the representatives of the Territory. </p>
<p>I may say that other matters such as civil aviation and defence will,<br />
as they are at present, be paid forand controlled directly by the Commonwealth<br />
Departments concerned.<br />
In the Adiitao's Executive Council, when, decision~ s are being<br />
arrived at as to proposals put forward by Ministerial Members for authority to<br />
spend on this or that, the official Members will sit in the Administrator's Council,<br />
as they sit at present, and they will offer advice to that Council and they will offer<br />
their experience to that Council. They will not take part in any vote that Council<br />
may have as to what it finally does. I suggest that these are very significant steps<br />
fo ' rward along the road to transferring power to the representative Members of the<br />
Territory and to transferring responsibility to the representative Members of<br />
the Territory. But I emphasise again that the total sum available fIor recurrent and<br />
minor works will be a total sum, only able to be added to, if thre House of Assembly<br />
wishes. to find some new avenue of expenditure, by imposing taxation to raise the<br />
revenue for that new expenditure because as a Territory progress es towards the<br />
ability to exercise greater power, so it must accept the greater responsibility for<br />
financing the decisions which it make..<br />
Even when in the future self-government comes or independence comes,<br />
there will be continuing Australian assistance for this Territory, but the amount of<br />
recurrent assistance provided will, to a great extent, depend on the amount of<br />
self-help which the Territory is prepared to impose upon itself. The developmental<br />
sums made available for development here will continue., but if, as I hope, the<br />
Territory develops and has an increased taxabla~ capacity because of such things as<br />
the Bougainville copper mining or oil, which may be found in Papua or elsewhere,<br />
the industrial development if that happens, then we would expect greater responsibility<br />
still to be accepted by the people of Papua and New Guinea, because when you boil<br />
it all down I believe that this is the position as far as the Australian people are<br />
concerned. We feel we have an obligation and a responsibility. I don't talk about a<br />
technical obligation at the moment under the trusteeship council feel we have an<br />
obligation and responsibility to help the development of this country to a stage where<br />
it could not only govern itself politically but govern itself economically, and we<br />
will accept that responsibility and this may go on for years.<br />
But I don't think we would want to accept the position where in years to<br />
come people from the Territory came to us and said " These are our needs, these<br />
are our requirements, we don't want to accept the responsibility for taxing to meet<br />
them you tax, you provide them'". At some stage the Australians would say:<br />
" Sorry"'. But if we continue to provide the assistance we are providing and intend<br />
to provide in the future, then at some stage there would be no need for the people<br />
of the Territory to come to us because, by a joint efi~ ort, we would have been able<br />
to raise the economic capacity of this country to a stage where the companies that<br />
have come in would be taxed, where wealth that flows to individuals would be taxed,<br />
where developments that have already taken place would lead to developments still<br />
in the future, and where the Territory of Papua and New Guinea could probably<br />
look after itself. / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
But for the present and in the foreseeable future vie intend to provide<br />
that assistance at least which we provide now. And for the present we propose<br />
tais new step forward towards self-government and responsibility, which I know<br />
in Fome areas of the Territory will be thought to be going too far, which I know<br />
in other areas of the Territory will be thought to be going not far enough, but which<br />
looked at from either end are, I think, necessary steps towards a future which must,<br />
at some time, hold full internal self-government and full inde-pendence.<br />
This is as far as we feel we should now go, arnd I finish as I began by<br />
saying that I believe it against all logic and all sense to put a timetable on this.<br />
We don't want to remain in the Territory one week against the wishes cf the<br />
majority of its people. We don't think we ought to get out of the Territory against<br />
the wish of the majority of its people. We don't want to rule any peoples without<br />
their consent. We don't think it proper to move out and possibly help a vocal<br />
minority rule a majority without that majority's consent, and one can't put a<br />
timetable on this but one..: can say these are steps towards the time when this<br />
Territory; will be self-governing and when its people will express their views.<br />
And we will take account of those views instead of imposing our views on them as<br />
to a date for self-government and independence.<br />
Your Honour and Members of the Administrator'S. Executive Council,<br />
I hope you will agree that these are significant steps and I hope with all my heart<br />
that the people of the Territory and the Members of the House of Assembly and<br />
the Members of the Administrator's Executive Council will make the fullest<br />
possible use of the opportunities now~ offered for the advancement of this<br />
Territory and the assumption of the responsibilities which must go with them.<br />
Thank you. </p>
