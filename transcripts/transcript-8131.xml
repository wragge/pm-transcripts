TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH JOHN RALPH AND<br />
CATHY FREEMAN, NEW TAKANAWA PRINCE HOTEL, TOKYO<br />
18 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how did it go?<br />
PM: Well, we're a bit biased I guess but I've never been<br />
prouder of Australia. It was great.<br />
JOURNALIST: Successful bid?<br />
PM: Great, great, great. Everyone was well we can't<br />
tell. You can't say you're successful until the result.<br />
But I can simply say this, that no-one I think could have<br />
done a better job than the team that was there. They<br />
were magnificent.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, you sound moved by the presentation.<br />
PM: Everyone was. Everyone was. There are not many dry<br />
eyes anywhere I don't think.<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of things did the delegates want<br />
to know?<br />
PM: Well we only got asked one question.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what was it?<br />
PM: About the detail of the other venues and the<br />
question of accommodation and assistance and<br />
accommodation. JOURNALIST: inaudible)<br />
PM: It was brilliantly answered.<br />
RALPH: Our young Olympians were the stars.<br />
PM: Yes, and our young girl where is she? Cathy,<br />
Cathy, come here.<br />
FREEMAN: And Michelle.<br />
PM: I tell you what. She's a bloody good runner but<br />
she's even a better ambassador. T </p>
<p>4 6 2<br />
JOURNALIST: What did you think of it Cathy?<br />
PM: It was, it was beautiful. It was just absolutely<br />
beautiful. There was something in there that just<br />
touched the hearts of everybody in that room I think.<br />
Beautiful. PM: We owe a great debt of gratitude to John Ralph as<br />
the leader of the team. He introduced it and he<br />
organised the team. It was great John.<br />
JOURNALIST: John, your reaction.<br />
PM: I'm very pleased. It couldn't have gone better. We<br />
got a very positive response from all of the members in<br />
the room and afterwards. There was a great deal of<br />
enthusiasm as we came out. I couldn't have wished for it<br />
to be better. It was perfect.<br />
JOURNALIST: Went of f without a hitch?<br />
RALPH: Yes. No hitches at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: So how do you rate your chances now?<br />
RALPH: I think our chances must have improved as a<br />
result of that because<br />
JOURNALIST: Is one question a good sign or a bad sign?<br />
RALPH: I think it was a very good sign. They were all<br />
satisfied with it and they were reacting very positively.<br />
There was just a question that Prince Albert asked<br />
because he said some of the members may not have been<br />
there and he would just like the ones who weren't there<br />
to have the benefit of what he had seen when he was in<br />
Melbourne. JOURNALIST: You sound very confident.<br />
RALPH: I think my confidence has gone up. I've been<br />
fairly confident all along but we won't know till the<br />
vote. JOURNALIST: Good luckc.<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
