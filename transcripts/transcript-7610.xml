PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 23 MAY 1989<br />
ASSISTANCE FOR AMAZON RAINFOREST PROTECTION<br />
The Australian Government has agreed to make a substantial<br />
donation towards the protection of the Amazon rainforests.<br />
The Government will donate $ 250,000 to the Fundacao Mata<br />
Virgem The Rainforest Foundation in support of its<br />
efforts to establish a 180,000 square kilometre ecological<br />
reserve in the Xingu region of the Amazon Basin.<br />
The Australian donation only the second by a national<br />
government will be a major boost to the campaign, which is<br />
designed to finance demarcation and management of large<br />
extensions to the existing Xingu National Park.<br />
The Foundation estimates that it will cost $ 4.5 million to<br />
demarcate the large area of rainforest, in co-operation with<br />
the Brazilian Government, and create a successful management<br />
regime for the reserve.<br />
The request for assistance was made by a delegation<br />
travelling the world to raise money for the new reserve,<br />
which would protect not only the rainforest but the 17<br />
Amazonian Indian nations which rely on it for food and<br />
shelter. The delegation included rock singer and conservationist<br />
Sting; film-maker Jean-Pierre Dutilleux; tribal leader of<br />
the Kayapo nation, Raoni, and the director of the existing<br />
Xingu National Park, Megaron; and American Indian Red Crow.<br />
The fate of the Amazon rainforests is a matter of<br />
international importance; it is a global issue. Their<br />
destruction is contributing to the global problem of the<br />
greenhouse effect.<br />
The Government of Brazil should not be expected alone to<br />
bear the financial btwrden-of-preserving these rainforests.<br />
I commend Sting, Raoni, Jean-Pierre, Megaron and their<br />
colleagues for their international efforts, covering some 17<br />
countries, and I am pleased that the Australian Government<br />
can play a part in this most worthy and vitally important<br />
cause. </p>
<p>I hope the Australian donation will encourage other<br />
countries and individuals to take a global approach to the<br />
problem of rainforest destruction, and support the Fundacao<br />
Mata Virgem in its efforts to preserve areas of the Amazon<br />
rainforest. </p>
