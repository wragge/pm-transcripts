CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
CANBERRA 5 MARCH 1986<br />
I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT, AND THROUGH YOU, THE NATIONAL<br />
PRESS CLUB, FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ONCE AGAIN, TO REPORT TO THE<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA THROUGH THIS MOST IMPORTANT FORUM.<br />
THIS IS IN EVERY WAY AN APPROPRIATE PLACE AND OCCASION TO<br />
MARK THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF MY GOVERNMENT'S ELECTION IN<br />
THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN THE CHRONICLERS<br />
OF THOSE THREE YEARS.<br />
AND LET ME SAY AT ONCE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE OCCASION,<br />
MAGNANIMOUS IN VICTORY YOU HAVE CARRIED OUT THE TASK<br />
RESPONSIBLY, OBJECTIVELY, IMPARTIALLY AND, IT ALMOST GOES<br />
WITHOUT SAYING, WITH TOTAL ACCURACY AT ALL TIMES.<br />
HAVING SAID THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I NOW PROCEED TO THE<br />
TASK IN HAND.<br />
I<br />
IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE CATALOGUE OF<br />
THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST THREE YEARS. AND I'M SURE<br />
YOU'LL BE RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT.<br />
FAR MORE IMPORTANT IS WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE NEXT THREE<br />
YEARS, AND BEYOND WHERE AUSTRALIA IS HEADING AND THE<br />
CHALLENGES WHICH FACE US NOT CHALLENGES FOR THE GOVERNMENT<br />
ALONE, BUT CHALLENGES FOR US ALL, AS AUSTRALIA ENTERS ITS<br />
THIRD CENTURY.<br />
IN ONE SENSE, THE THREE YEARS FROM 5 MARCH 1983 HAVE BEEN<br />
FOUNDATION YEARS.<br />
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ONLY YEARS OF ACHIEVEMENT IN THEMSELVES,<br />
BUT YEARS IN WHICH MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP<br />
FIRMLY IN VIEW THE LONGER TERM RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE TO BUILD A STRONGER ECONOMY AND A<br />
FAIRER SOCIETY.<br />
AT THE OUTSET, THERE IS A POINT OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE WHICH<br />
I MUST EMPHASISE. IT IS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL TO MY<br />
PHILOSOPHY AND FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PARTY<br />
AND GOVERNMENT I LEAD. </p>
<p>IT IS TRUE THAT FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS THE PROBLEMS OF<br />
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR<br />
CONCERNS. THAT WAS INEVITABLE GIVEN OUR INHERITANCE OF AN<br />
ECONOMY IN DEEP CRISIS ON 5 MARCH 1983.<br />
IT IS TRUE THAT THE RESTORATION OF GROWTH AND THE CREATION<br />
OF JOBS HAVE BEEN AMONG OUR MOST CONSPICUOUS SUCCESSES. AND<br />
THE PURSUIT OF SOUND RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT WILL<br />
REMAIN DOMINANT IN OUR POLICY CONSIDERATION.<br />
BUT I EMPHASISE THAT THE LONGER TERM OBJECTIVE OF OUR<br />
ECONOMIIC POLICIES IS TO USE THE FRUITS OF GROWTH TO CREATE<br />
NOT ONLY A MORE PROSPEROUS SOCIETY BUT A MORE EQUITABLE<br />
SOCIETY.<br />
AND THAT IS THE WIDER MEASURE BY WHICH OUR RECORD OF THE<br />
PAST THREE YEARS AND OUR PERFORMANCE AS A LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
IN THE YEARS TO COME MUST ULTIMATELY BE JUDGED.<br />
WE ARE CERTAINLY PREPARED TO BE JUDGED ON OUR ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGEMENT AND OUR ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENT.<br />
WE WILL MORE THAN CHEERFULLY BE JUDGED ON OUR RECORD AND OUR<br />
POLICIES AGAINST THE ALTERNATIVE THE DISASTERS THEY<br />
WROUGHT AND THE DISASTERS THEY PROPOSE.<br />
BUT THOSE ARE NOT THE ONLY STANDARDS BY WHICH WE WOULD<br />
CHOOSE TO BE JUDGED. WE WISH ALSO TO BE JUDGED BY THE<br />
STANDARDS OF ACHIEVEMENT WHICH OUR PHILOSOPHY, OUR<br />
OBJECTIVES, OUR ASPIRATIONS SET FOR US AS A LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT. TO PUT IT IN SPORTING TERMS, WE WANT TO BE JUDGED ULTIMATELY<br />
AGAINST OUR PERSONAL BEST THE BEST LABOR STANDARDS, THE<br />
BEST LABOR TRADITIONS, THE BEST LABOR ASPIRATIONS.<br />
I! HERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE GREATEST SINGLE<br />
ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PAST THREE YEARS.<br />
THREE YEARS AGO I MADE, ON BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
PARTY, A COMMITMENT TO THE CREATION OF 500,000 JOBS IN OUR<br />
FIRST THREE YEARS. THAT WAS AS IMPORTANT AND FUNDAMENTAL AN<br />
UNDERTAKING AS HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN BY ANY LABOR LEADER<br />
SEEKING ELECTION.<br />
WE HAVE IN FACT BETTERED OUR COMMITMENT. SINCE APRIL 1983,<br />
OVER 600,000 NEW JOBS 608,300 TO BE PRECISE HAVE BEEN<br />
CREATED IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S A REAL CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION, NOT JUST<br />
FOR A LABOR GOVERNMENT ON ITS THIRD ANNIVERSARY, BUT FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS. BUT ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT RAS BEEN ACHIEVED IS THE WAY<br />
IT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED.<br />
IT HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED BY SETTING OFF A NEW SPIRAL OF<br />
INFLATION, BY GOING FOR EXCESSIVE FISCAL STIMULUS. </p>
<p>ON THE CONTRARY, WE HAVE MORE THAN HALVED THE BUDGET DEFICIT<br />
BEQUEATHED TO US BY OUR PREDECESSORS AND HAVE NOW SET<br />
INFLATION FIRMLY ON A DOWNWARD PATH, DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT<br />
UPWARD PRESSURES STEMMING FROM LAST YEAR'S DEPRECIATION.<br />
WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF PURCHASING TEMPORARY<br />
POLITICAL GAIN AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR LONGER TERM ECONOMIC<br />
AND SOCIAL OBJECTIVES.<br />
FOR US, THE CREATION OF JOBS HAS NOT ONLY BEEN A CENTRAL<br />
OBJECTIVE OF OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES, IT IS CENTRAL TO OUR<br />
SOCIAL OBJECTIVES OUR OBJECTIVES OF GREATER EQUITY, NOT<br />
ONLY FOR THOSE ABLE TO TAKE PART IN THE PRODUCTIVE PROCESSES<br />
DIRECTLY, BUT FOR THOSE OF OUR FELLOW AUSTRALIANS WHO DEPEND<br />
UPON A COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY IF THEY ARE TO SHARE EQUITABLY<br />
IN THE FRUITS OF GROWTH.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT ITSELF IS ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE SINGLE MOST<br />
IMPORTANT CAUSE OF POVERTY IN AUSTRALIA. CLEARLY,<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT CAN BE LOWERED PERMANENTLY ONLY THROUGH<br />
SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH.<br />
SIMILARLY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CAPACITY OF SOCIETY<br />
PROGRESSIVELY TO REDISTRIBUTE INCOME IN FAVOUR OF THE<br />
POOREST IS GREATER IN A GROWING ECONOMY. AND ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH CAN BE MAXIMISED ONLY THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF ECONOMIC<br />
EFFICIENCY. I WANT TO DISPEL UTTERLY THE ILLUSION, FOSTERED SO<br />
ASSIDUOUSLY, AND INSIDIOUSLY IN CERTAIN QUARTERS, THAT FOR A<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT, THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOUND ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGEMENT AND OUR HIGHER SOCIAL OBJECTIVES ARE<br />
INCOMPATIBLE. THERE IS NO CONFLICT BETWEEN EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY.<br />
ON THE CONTRARY IN TODAY'S WORLD, IN TODAY'S ECONOMY, THERE<br />
CAN BE NO EQUITY WITHOUT EFFICIENCY.<br />
WHILE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY CANNOT OF ITSELF GUARANTEE GREATER<br />
EQUITY, IT IS CERTAINLY A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE<br />
CREATION OF A FAIRER SOCIETY.<br />
IT JUST STATES PART OF OUR CASE TO SAY THAT ONLY A LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT POSSESSES THE WILL TO PURSUE THE TWIN GOALS OF<br />
EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY SIMULTANEOUSLY AS WE HAVE DONE FOR<br />
THE PAST THREE YEARS.<br />
CERTAINLY, GREATER EQUITY, A FAIRER SOCIETY, IS NOT AND HAS<br />
NEVER BEEN ON THE AGENDA OF OUR OPPONENTS.<br />
BUT NEITHER IS ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY.<br />
FOR PROOF OF THAT, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO BACK TO THEIR<br />
PERFORMANCE IN THE YEARS BEFORE 1983.<br />
THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR, UNDER THEIR CURRENT LEADERSHIP,<br />
THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO THE ABANDONMENT OF THE VERY </p>
<p>CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST THREE<br />
YEARS HAVE BEEN SECURED, AND UPON WHICH THE NATION'S<br />
PROSPECTS FOR SUSTAINED AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH CHIEFLY REST.<br />
A STRIKING PARADOX OF OUR AGE IS THAT THE CONSERVATIVES WHO<br />
PROFESS SOME CONCERN FOR HISTORY APPEAR INCAPABLE OF EVER<br />
LEARNING THE LESSONS OF HISTORY.<br />
AND HISTORY SHOWS US CLEARLY THAT ECONOMIC PROGRESS IS<br />
FASTEST WHEN THE COMMUNITY SHARES COMMON GOALS AND HAS<br />
AGREED PRIORITIES.<br />
THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO BE THE CASE WHEN ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE<br />
SURE THAT THE FRUITS OF GROWTH ARE TO BE FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED.<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS NOW WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT THE ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERIES OF THE SEVENTIES PROVED SHORT-LIVED, BECAUSE<br />
DISPUTES OVER INCOME CLAIMS COULD ONLY BE RECONCILED AT THE<br />
PRICE OF GROWTH-DESTROYING INFLATION.<br />
FURTHER, IT IS ALSO PLAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING TO<br />
ACCEPT STRUCTURAL CHANGES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THEM<br />
IN THE SHORT TERM, BUT WHICH ARE ULTIMATELY DIRECTED AT<br />
PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH, IF THEY BELIEVE THAT BENEFITS OF<br />
THAT HIGHER GROWTH PERFORMANCE ARE TO BE SHARED EQUITABLY.<br />
AND OF COURSE, OUR RECOGNITION OF THESE PRINCIPLES HAS BEEN<br />
AT THE HEART OF OUR APPROACH FROM DAY ONE FROM THE DAY WE<br />
SET ABOUT THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, RECOVERY<br />
AND RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
IT IS AN APPROACH WHICH HAS FOUND ITS MOST EFFECTIVE<br />
EXPRESSION IN THE ACCORD -NOT JUST THE DOCUMENT CALLED THE<br />
PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD -BUT IN ITS ACTUAL OPERATION.<br />
THERE IS NOTHING MORE CURIOUS IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL SCENE<br />
AND LET ME SAY, NOTHING MORE SPURIOUS THAN THE LINE<br />
PEDDLED, CHIEFLY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY BY OUR OPPONENTS, THAT<br />
THIS LABOR GOVERNMENT IS TOO CLOSE TO BUSINESS AND TOO CLOSE<br />
TO THE UNIONS.<br />
LET ME MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT I MAKE NO APOLOGY<br />
WHATSOEVER FOR THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO<br />
ESTABLISH WITH THE KEY ECONOMIC GROUPINGS IN THE COMMUNITY<br />
AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT COMMON GOALS,<br />
PRIORITIES AND PROBLEMS.<br />
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR A PROCESS AND AN APPROACH THROUGH<br />
WHICH 600,000 JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THREE YEARS.<br />
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR A PROCESS WHICH HAS REDUCED INDUSTRIAL<br />
DISPUTATION TO THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR SIXTEEN YEARS.<br />
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR AN APPROACH WHICH HAS LED TO THE<br />
RESTORATION OF THE PROFIT SHARE AND THE CORRESPONDING<br />
DECLINE IN REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS TO THE LEVELS OF THE LATE<br />
1960' S AND EARLY 19701S.<br />
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR THE FACT THAT OUR INTERNATIONAL </p>
<p>COMPETITIVENESS HAS NOW BEEN RESTORED TO THE LEVELS OF<br />
YEARS AGO AND THAT THAT IMPROVEMENT IS EXPECTED<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY TO BE RETAINED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ACCORD<br />
MARK II.<br />
AND I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR AN APPROACH WHICH HAS CREATED<br />
THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY A NEW AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE OF<br />
THE NEED FOR FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF KEY SECTORS OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, NOW UNDER WAY.<br />
AND IF CLOSENESS MEANS OUR CAPACITY TO CONSULT AND<br />
CO-OPERATE, TO AN EXTENT UNMATCHED BY ANY PREVIOUS<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR THAT EITHER.<br />
THIS HAS BEEN AN APPROACH WHICH IS SERVING AUSTRALIA WELL.<br />
IT MUST CONTINUE.<br />
AND TWO THINGS HAVE TO BE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE ACCORD, IN<br />
ITS WIDEST MEANING.<br />
FIRST, IT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK OF CERTAINTY AND<br />
PREDICTABILITY, YET AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH<br />
TO COPE WITH UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
AND SECONDLY, THE ACCORD GOES FAR BEYOND BEING A UNIQUELY<br />
SUCCESSFUL METHOD OF INCREASING EMPLOYMENT, REDUCING<br />
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTATION AND CONTROLLING INFLATION. IT IS A<br />
COMPLEX OF AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT ECONOMIC AND<br />
SOCIAL GOALS FOR THIS NATION THE GOALS WHICH ARE<br />
FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS LABOR GOVERNMENT'S VISION FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
BUT WE COULD NOT HAVE MOVED SO FIRMLY AND SUCCESSFULLY<br />
TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THOSE GOALS IF SUPPORT FOR THEM<br />
HAD BEEN CONFINED TO THOSE GROUPS AND INTERESTS<br />
TRADITIONALLY DEFINED AS LABOR.<br />
WYEN WE UNDERTOOK THREE YEARS AGO TO TURN THE ECONOMY<br />
AROUND, LABOR PRESENTED AUSTRALIA WITH A NEW APPROACH<br />
DESIGNED TO ENLIST THE WIDEST POSSIBLE COMMUNITY SUPPORT.<br />
THE ACCORD WAS PART OF THE APPROACH. SO WAS THE SUMMIT.<br />
AND LET ME REMIND YOU THAT THE SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE REPRESENTED<br />
WIDE AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC GOALS.<br />
MANY COMMENTATORS WERE SCEPTICAL OF OUR APPROACH.<br />
NOW OF COURSE NOBODY HERE WAS AMONG THE RANKS OF THE CYNICS.<br />
IN PARTICULAR THERE WERE THOSE WHO WERE SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE<br />
ABILITY OF THE ACCORD TO ENDURE AND TO SECURE SUSTAINED<br />
GROWTH WITHOUT A RE-EMERGENCE OF UNCONTROLLED INFLATION.<br />
THE RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. IT REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL<br />
DOWNPAYMENT ON OUR PROMISE TO DELIVER LONG-TERM GROWTH. BUT<br />
A DOWNPAYMENT IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE SET ABOUT CASTING<br />
ASIDE THE MANY OBSTACLES TO GROWTH LEFT ALONG THE TRACK BY<br />
PREVIOUS COALITION GOVERNMENTS. </p>
<p>WE HAVE ENCOURAGED INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE TO BECOME MORE<br />
ROBUST AND INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE, MORE<br />
EXPORT-ORIENTED, MORE WILLING TO SEEK OUT MARKET<br />
OPPORTUNITIES, MORE READY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DEVELOPMENTS<br />
IN TECHNOLOGY AND MODERN BUSINESS PRACTICE, AND LESS RELIANT<br />
ON GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND INTERVENTION.<br />
WAGE RESTRAINT THROUGH THE ACCORD, STRONG PRODUCTIVITY<br />
GROWTH, AND THE SIGNIFICANT DEPRECIATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
DOLLAR IN 1985, HAVE MADE OUR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES MORE<br />
INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE THAN THEY HAVE BEEN FOR AT LEAST<br />
FIFTEEN YEARS.<br />
AND IT IS HEARTENING TO SEE THAT THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS<br />
RESPONDING TO THAT OPPORTUNITY. THERE IS FIRM EVIDENCE OF<br />
INCREASING MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT AND RISING PRODUCTIVITY,<br />
TOGETHER WITH GREATER TECHNOLOGICAL AWARENESS, AND A MORE<br />
CO-OPERATIVE APPROACH BETWEEN EMPLOYERS, UNIONS AND<br />
GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT'S CAREFULLY CO-ORDINATED, WIDE-RANGING<br />
PROGRAM OF POLICY INITIATIVES FOR AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY HAS<br />
CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY TO THIS NEW-FOUND VIGOUR.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED SPECIAL<br />
SECTORAL PLANS FOR ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS FACING CERTAIN<br />
LARGE AND PREVIOUSLY AILING INDUSTRIES SUCH AS STEEL AND<br />
MOTOR VEHICLES.<br />
AND WE HAVE PROMOTED AN UPGRADING OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
CAPACITY OF MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY BY BRINGING ABOUT A<br />
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE R D EFFORT OF PRIVATE<br />
INDUSTRY, BETTER LINKING INDUSTRY TO THE PUBLIC RESEARCH<br />
INSTITUTIONS, AND PROVIDING A BETTER BASIS FOR NEW PRODUCTS,<br />
PROCESSES AND ENTERPRISES UPON WHICH FUTURE GROWTH DEPENDS.<br />
I1 ADDITION WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SUBSTANTIAL STEPS TO<br />
REMOVE UNNECESSARY OR OUTMODED REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS<br />
ESPECIALLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR.<br />
IN EACH CASE OUR OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO SECURE FOR AUSTRALIA<br />
AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH WILL PERMIT AND ENCOURAGE EFFICIENT,<br />
COMPETITIVE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR FULL<br />
POTENTIAL TO INCREASING AND SUSTAINING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN<br />
AUSTRALIA. THE SAME APPROACH HAS CHARACTERISED THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
RESPONSE TO THE DIFFICULTIES FACED BY THE RURAL SECTOR.<br />
WE ARE SEEKING DOMESTICALLY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF<br />
ESCALATING FARM COSTS ON OUR RURAL PRODUCERS. THE RECENT<br />
GOVERNMENT DECISION ON FUEL COSTS IS EVIDENCE OF THIS.<br />
WE HAVE SOUGHT AT THE SAME TIME TO PROMOTE MORE EFFICIENT<br />
M4ARKETING AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES WITHIN THE RURAL SECTOR.<br />
THE REFORMS WE HAVE INTRODUCED IN PRIMARY INDUSTRY STATUTORY<br />
M4ARKETING AUTHORITIES, AND THE PLANS WE HAVE DEVELOPED FOR<br />
THE DAIRY AND SUGAR INDUSTRIES, TESTIFY TO OUR COMMITMENT TO </p>
<p>SEEING AUSTRALIAN RURAL INDUSTRIES SURVIVE AND PROSPER.<br />
FINALLY, WE ARE WORKING TO SECURE A REVERSAL OF THE POLICIES<br />
OF OTHERS, WHICH ARE CORRUPTING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.<br />
DURING THE PERIOD WE HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE WE HAVE<br />
CONSISTENTLY MADE CLEAR TO THE EEC OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE<br />
DISASTROUS EFFECTS OF ITS COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ON<br />
WORLD TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. MORE RECENTLY WE<br />
HAVE EXPRESSED OUR CONCERN TO SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE UNITED<br />
STATES ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS ABOUT THE FURTHER ADVERSE<br />
CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR RURAL PRODUCERS OF THEIR EXPORT<br />
ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM.<br />
IN EACH CASE THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HESITATED TO PUT ITS<br />
VIEWS STRONGLY TO THE EEC AND THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE,<br />
DESPITE OUR CLOSE FOREIGN POLICY AND HISTORICAL TIES WITH<br />
THESE COUNTRIES, WE WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY WHILE THEIR<br />
AGRICULTURAL POLICIES AND PROGRAMS DAMAGE OUR VITAL RURAL<br />
SECTOR. I AM, THEREFORE, PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT I HAVE<br />
RECEIVED A POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM PRESIDENT REAGAN FOR AN<br />
EARLY MEETING WITH HIM AND WITH OTHER SENIOR MEMBERS OF HIS<br />
ADMINISTRATION. THEY HAVE SUGGESTED, AND WE HAVE AGREED,<br />
THAT THESE MEETINGS SHOULD TAKE PLACE ON 17 APRIL. ON THIS<br />
VISIT I WOULD ALSO EXPECT TO MEET WITH SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL<br />
LEADERS. THESE MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON WILL DISCUSS WAYS OF ENSURING<br />
THAT THE EXPORT ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE<br />
IMPACT ON OUR RURAL SECTOR, AND HOW BEST TO PROMOTE A MORE<br />
RATIONAL INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM IN AGRICULTURAL<br />
PRODUCTS AT THE FORTHCOMING ECONOMIC SUMMIT OF THE HEADS OF<br />
GOVERNMENT OF THE LEADING INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES.<br />
14ADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
AT THIS POINT I WISH TO REVERT TO MY BASIC THEME AND TO<br />
EMPHASISE AGAIN THAT FOR THIS LABOR GOVERNMENT THE GOALS OF<br />
GREATER EFFICIENCY AND GREATER EQUITY ARE INDISSOLUBLY<br />
LINKED.<br />
CENTRAL TO OUR POLICIES IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ONLY A<br />
GROWING ECONOMY CAN FULFILL THE LEGITIMATE ASPIRATIONS OF<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS ENGAGED IN PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY TO IMPROVED<br />
LIVING STANDARDS AND A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE.<br />
BUT IT IS EQUALLY TRUE THAT AN EXPANDING ECONOMY CAN BEST<br />
PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SATISFY ASPIRATIONS OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS TO CARE FOR THE NEEDY AND THOSE LESS ABLE TO<br />
CARE FOR THEMSELVES.<br />
OUR WELFARE INITIATIVES HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THOSE IN<br />
GREATEST NEED THE UNEMPLOYED, LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH<br />
CHILDREN AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFICIARIES RENTING<br />
PRIVATELY. INDEED THE IMPACT OF THESE INITIATIVES HAS BEEN TO INCREASE </p>
<p>THE REAL DISPOSABLE INCOME OF PEOPLE ON SOCIAL SECURITY BY<br />
UP To 20 PER CENT SINCE 1983. DESPITE THE SHARP DROP IN<br />
THEIR REAL INCOMES IN THE YEARS 1976-77 TO 1982-83, ALMOST<br />
EVERYONE ON A FULL PENSION NOW HAS A HIGHER DISPOSABLE<br />
INCOME THAN THEY DID A DECADE AGO, SOME BY UP TO 10 PER<br />
CENT. A MORE GENERAL INDICATOR OF OUR WILLINGNESS TO RE-ORDER<br />
PRIORITIES TO ASSIST THE NEEDY IS THE FACT THAT THE SHARE OF<br />
COMMONWEALTH OUTLAYS ( EXCLUDING PUBLIC DEBT INTEREST)<br />
DIRECTED TO HEALTH, WELFARE AND HOUSING HAS RISEN STEADILY<br />
IN EACH OF OUR BUDGETS, AND IS NOW OVER 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS<br />
HIGHER THAN IN THE 1982-83 BUDGET.<br />
THE SWEEPING TAXATION REFORMS WE HAVE ANNOUNCED WILL ENHANCE<br />
SOCIAL EQUITY THROUGH THE MEASURES TO REDUCE POVERTY TRAPS<br />
AND THROUGH THE CLOSURE OF TAX SHELTERS. AND THE REFORMS<br />
WILL CONTRIBUTE TO GROWTH BY PROVIDING GREATER INCENTIVE TO<br />
UNDERTAKE PRODUCTIVE WORK.<br />
OUR POLICIES IN THE CRITICAL FIELD OF EDUCATION ARE DIRECTED<br />
TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND RELEVANCE OF EDUCATION,<br />
ENSURING EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY AND ENCOURAGING STUDENTS TO<br />
REMAIN LONGER IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING.<br />
WE HAVE DONE SO IN RECOGNITION NOT ONLY OF THE MAJOR<br />
ECONOMIC BENEFITS WHICH WOULD FLOW-FROM A MORE ADAPTABLE,<br />
MORE HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE BUT ALSO-IN RECOGNITION OF THE<br />
INESTIMABLE VALUE TO INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS OF A MORE RELEVANT<br />
EDUCATION. INDEED, A HIGH PRIORITY HAS BEEN ACCORDED TO INTRODUCING A<br />
PHASED PROGRAM TO RATIONALISE AND ENHANCE YOUTH INCOME<br />
SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE<br />
MORE INCENTIVE TO CONTINUE IN EDUCATION RATHER THAN OPT OUT<br />
INFO. UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
THIS WAS PART OF A PACKAGE OF INTEGRATED MEASURES<br />
IMPLEMENTED IN THE 1985-86 BUDGET PRIORITY ONE THAT<br />
ESTABLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME, A COHERENT SET OF POLICIES<br />
AND PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE GREATLY ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE TO CONTINUE EDUCATION, TO ACQUIRE SKILLS AND TO<br />
UNDERTAKE PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT.<br />
A CENTRAL ELEMENT OF PRIORITY ONE IS THE TRAINEESHIP SCHEME<br />
WHICH WILL PROVIDE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IN<br />
VOCATIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND ESPECIALLY IN THEIR<br />
TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK.<br />
AND LET ME HERE MAKE THIS POINT AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN<br />
THE WORKING OF PRIORITY ONE IS THE NEED FOR UNIONS,<br />
EMPLOYERS AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO GET BEHIND<br />
IT. IT IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH IN THE<br />
FINAL ANALYSIS, THE FULL SUCCESS OF OUR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL<br />
INITIATIVES REQUIRES COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND C0OMUNITY<br />
CO-OPERATION, IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ACCORD ITSELF.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. </p>
<p>A BALANCED ACCOUNT OF THE PAST THREE YEARS MUST, OF COURSE,<br />
INCLUDE REFERENCE TO AUSTRALIA'S ENHANCED INTERNATIONAL<br />
STANDING AS REFLECTED IN THE RECORD VOTE WE RECEIVED IN<br />
1984 FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY<br />
COUNCIL. WE HAVE TAKEN AS OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES THE<br />
IMPERATIVE OF AUSTRALIA'S INDEPENDENCE AND NATIONAL<br />
SECURITY; THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE TO LIVE<br />
IN A WORLD FREE OF THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR; AND THE<br />
STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC FACTS OF AUSTRALIA'S POSITION IN THE<br />
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.<br />
FACED BY THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE<br />
UNITED STATES AND NEW ZEALAND, WE HAVE WORKED SUCCESSFULLY<br />
TO ENSURE THE CONTINUING STRENGTH OF OUR SECURITY<br />
ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE UNITED STATES UNDER ANZUS. AT THE<br />
SAME TIME, WE HAVE STRIVEN TO ENSURE THAT OUR CLOSE<br />
RELATIONSHIPS WITH NEW ZEALAND, INCLUDING THE DEFENCE<br />
RELATIONSHIP, IS IN NO WAY DIMINISHED.<br />
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE WHATEVER CONSTRUCTIVE CONTRIBUTION<br />
WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE THE RESTORATION OF TRILATERAL<br />
CO-OPERATION UNDER ANZUS, AND AT ALL EVENTS TO ENSURE THAT<br />
OUR TWO-WAY COMMITMENTS TO AND WITH THE UNITED STATES REMAIN<br />
FULLY OPERABLE AND IN FORCE.<br />
AUSTRALIA SHARED WITH MOST OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD<br />
A GREAT SENSE OF RELIEF WHEN THE SUPER-POWERS RESUMED<br />
SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS ON ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT. WE<br />
SHOULD NOT, HOWEVER, UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH<br />
LIE ON THE PATH TO AGREEMENT. NOR SHALL WE IN ANY WAY RELAX<br />
OUR OWN EFFORTS IN THIS AREA.<br />
OUR MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT IN THE ARMS CONTROL AREA IS OUR<br />
INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP THROUGH THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM THE<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE TREATY. THE CONCLUSION OF<br />
TIHE TREATY SIGNALS OUR DETERMINATION TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN<br />
IN THE FIELD OF ARMS CONTROL. IT ALSO EXEMPLIFIES THE<br />
PRIORITY WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN TO AUSTRALIA'S OWN PART OF THE<br />
WORLD, THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.<br />
FROM THE OUTSET OF ITS TIME IN OFFICE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
INVESTED THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE ENERGY AND RESOURCES TO THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH ALL ITS<br />
NEIGHBOURS. THE FRUITS OF THESE EFFORTS CAN BE SEEN IN MANY<br />
WAYS. I WOULD MENTION ONLY ON THIS OCCASION THE CONSTRUCTIVE<br />
DISCUSSIONS WHICH BILL HAYDEN HAS JUST HAD WITH INDONESIA<br />
LEADERS ON A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS, INCLUDING THE SEA BED<br />
BOUNDARY; THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE RELATIONSHIP<br />
W4ITH CHINA, WHICH I LOOK FORWARD TO VISITING AGAIN IN MAY;<br />
AND OUR RESPONSE TO THE DEVELOPING SITUATION IN THE<br />
PHILIPPINES, AS A RESULT OF WHICH I WOULD SUGGEST THAT NO<br />
COUNTRY IS BETTER PLACED THAN AUSTRALIA TO ESTABLISH A<br />
CO-OPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT<br />
AQUINO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, </p>
<p>IN THIS NECESSARILY VERY GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE PAST THREE<br />
YEARS I HAVE TRIED TO PLACE OUR ACHIEVEMENTS FIRMLY IN THE<br />
CONTEXT OF OUR GOALS OF GREATER EFFICIENCY AND GREATER<br />
EQUITY.<br />
THIS DISCUSSION OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS IS NOT TO DENY THAT IN<br />
M4ANY RESPECTS THE KEY ECONOMIC DECISIONS WE MUST NOW MAKE<br />
ARE MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX THAN THOSE THAT FACED THE<br />
GOVERNMENT IN 1983.<br />
THE IMMEDIATE GOALS OF A GOVERNMENT ELECTED, AS WE WERE, TO<br />
DEAL WITH THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS FOR FIFTY YEARS, WERE<br />
RELATIVELY SIMPLE, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS CERTAINLY NOTHING<br />
SIMPLE OR EASY-ABOUT THE MEANS BY WHICH THAT CRISIS COULD BE<br />
BROUGHT TO AN END AND SUSTAINED RECOVERY COULD BE ACHIEVED.<br />
IN A SENSE, THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC ISSUES WE MUST NOW<br />
ADDRESS ARE IN FACT THE PRICE WE PAY FOR THE VERY SUCCESS OF<br />
OUR POLICIES, AND THE STRENGTH OF THE GROWTH THAT HAS BEEN<br />
ACHIEVED IN THE ECONOMY.<br />
IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES WE MUST ACCEPT THAT THE WORLD<br />
DOES NOT OWE US A LIVING. WE CANNOT EXPECT TO RAISE<br />
AUSTRALIA'S LIVING STANDARDS JUST BY CALLING TO AN EVER<br />
GROWING EXTENT ON THE WORLD'S SAVINGS.<br />
AUSTRALIA MUST TO BE PREPARED TO LOOK CLOSELY AT ITS<br />
INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES AND BE PREPARED TO EMBRACE CHANGES<br />
WHICH WILL INCREASE OUR POTENTIAL TO COMPETE.<br />
WE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO UNDERTAKE THE INVESTMENT NECESSARY<br />
TO LIFT OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND PRODUCE GOODS AND SERVICES OF<br />
THE KIND AND QUALITY WHICH IS DEMANDED IN WORLD TRADE.<br />
INCREASINGLY SUCH DECISIONS ARE LIKELY TO REQUIRE A<br />
WILLINGNESS ON OUR PART TO EXAMINE CLOSELY WHERE OUR<br />
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE LIES IN WORLD TRADE, AND TO SEEK TO<br />
SHIFT RESOURCES OUT OF AREAS WHERE OUR ADVANTAGES ARE LEAST<br />
INTO THOSE AREAS WHICH WILL MAXIMIZE OUR CHANCES TO SELL IN<br />
OUR REGION.<br />
AND, NOW AS MUCH AS ANYTIME IN THE PAST THREE YEARS,<br />
AUSTRALIA NEEDS THE SAME HIGH QUALITY OF ECONOMIC<br />
DECISION-MAKING, AND THE SAME COMMITMENT TO FISCAL AND<br />
MONETARY DISCIPLINE, AND THE SAME ACCORD-BASED APPROACH TO<br />
INCOMES POLICY TO ENSURE NON-INFLATIONARY LONG-TERM GROWTH<br />
AS HAS SERVED US SO WELL OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.<br />
WE WILL-NOT BE DIVERTED FROM OUR TASK OF RESPONSIBLE<br />
MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. OUR INCOMES POLICY HAS BEEN<br />
SECURED FOR A FURTHER TWO YEARS. OUR COMMITMENT TO THE<br />
TRILOGY OF FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY IS FIRM. AND OUR MONETARY<br />
POLICY WILL BE FIRM BUT ACCOMMODATING TO A RATE OF ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH LOW INFLATION.<br />
WE WILL CONTINUE TO REMOVE PROGRESSIVELY THE REMAINING<br />
OBSTACLES TO GROWTH AT A PACE WHICH CAN BALANCE THE<br />
COMPETING [ NTERESTS OF THOSE DIRECTLY AFFECTED. </p>
<p>THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY AHEAD WILL<br />
CALL FOR CAREFUL, DIFFICULT AND SOMETIMES TOUGH DECISIONS.<br />
THOSE DECISIONS WILL REFLECT OUR CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO<br />
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SOCIAL PROGRESS, REFORM AND EQUITY<br />
THROUGH SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS,<br />
THOSE DECISIONS ARE THE ULTIMATE AND INESCAPABLE<br />
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA. WE<br />
ACCEPT THAT RESPONSIBILITY UNRESERVEDLY.<br />
YET, JUST AS THE SUCCESS OF THE PAST THREE YEARS COULD NOT<br />
HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE WORK AND CO-OPERATION OF ALL<br />
SECTIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY, AND JUST AS THOSE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS ARE, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, SO IN THE YEARS AHEAD OUR SUCCESS AS<br />
A NATION WILL BE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY.<br />
SUCCESS IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY GUARANTEED TO ANY NATION, EVEN<br />
ONE SO FUNDAMENTALLY FORTUNATE AS OURS. NOW MORE THAN EVER,<br />
IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE WORKED AT AND WORKED FOR,<br />
UNREMITTINGLY NOT ONLY BY GOVERNMENTS, BUT BY THE WHOLE<br />
COMMUNITY. I AM PROUD TO BE AT THE HEAD OF SUCH A GOVERNMENT, AS I AM<br />
IMMENSELY PROUD TO BE AT THE HEAD OF SUCH A PEOPLE AND SUCH<br />
A NATION DURING THESE THREE GREAT YEARS AND THE EVEN<br />
GREATER YEARS OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR AUSTRALIA TO COME.<br />
YET LET ME SAY THIS IN CONCLUSION: THE THREE YEARS DURING<br />
WHICH I HAVE HAD THIS HIGHEST OF PRIVILEGES OF LEADING THIS<br />
GREAT COUNTRY HAVE CONFIRMED, MONTH BY MONTH AND YEAR BY<br />
YEAR, MY DEEPEST CONVICTION THAT IF THE SUCCESS WE ALL SO<br />
DEEPLY DESIRE FOR OUR COUNTRY IS TO BE SECURED FOR THIS AND<br />
FUTURE GENERATIONS, THEN IT WILL BE ONLY UNDER THE<br />
LEADERSHIP OF A LABOR GOVERNMENT, ACTING ON TRUE LABOR<br />
PRINCIPLES IN THE AUTHENTIC LABOR TRADITION. </p>
