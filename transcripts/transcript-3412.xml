PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT THE UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK<br />
TUESDAY, 1 OCTOBER 1974<br />
QUESTION: We had a report from your country that the Shah of Iran<br />
mentioned a possible exchange agreement of oil and Australian<br />
uranium. Could you tell us something about this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would be putting it too simply to say an<br />
exchange of oil and uranium. The Trade Agreement which Australia<br />
has made with Iran doesn't mention oil. It is not, I understand,<br />
ot the Iranian practice to mention oil in her Trade Agreement with<br />
other countries. The Shah is very interested in obtaining regular<br />
supplies from Australia of those resources which Australia is fortunately<br />
situated. Uranium, of course, iron ore and the like. The suggestion<br />
is that no arrangements have been completed of course the Iranian<br />
Government could take in some of the Australian instrumentalities in<br />
this field such as the Australian Industries Development Corporation<br />
or the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. This would be a way of<br />
preserving Australian ownership and control of these basic Australian<br />
resources and at the same time guaranteeing a certain share of the<br />
resources for the purchaser.<br />
QUESTION: Can you just give us an idea of the'amount of uranium<br />
they want?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, there has been nothitig so specific as that.<br />
All the discussions we had last week were to produce a climate in<br />
which we can then get down to the details of the arrangements. But<br />
we were very pleased with the discussions and got to understand each<br />
other very well. The sort of resources the Shah would like to obtain<br />
from Australia, and also, of course, he emphasises his preference<br />
for Government-to Government arrangements in respect to resources<br />
and to operate through state corporations.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, one of the American newsagencies today reports from<br />
Australia that the climate of your Government and you personally<br />
are becoming recently more friendly to the United States since<br />
Mr NiXon. Can you say anything about your present relations with<br />
the United States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe our relations with the U. S. have been<br />
friendly along. I don't want to personalise these relatio..<br />
I would thi. % k that relations between the United States and Australia<br />
would be satisfactory whatever the Government was in Australia or<br />
the United States. There is a basic community of interests.<br />
QUESTION: I was intrigued by your opening lines in your speech where<br />
you r-zferred to the fact that you are the first Head of an Australian<br />
Sdemocratic Government to speak at the United Nations. I have<br />
a d your philosophies carefully so I have some conception of<br />
what changes you have brought. My question is designed to clarify what<br />
a social democratic government means in terms, of course, internally,<br />
and what does it mean in terms of foreign policy? I didn't was---<br />
to ask you what it means in terms, idealogically, because I want to<br />
avoid that and I want to spare you that? / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Don't spare me. Let me cite what I would regard<br />
as the social democrat governments at the moment or in recent years.<br />
There would be the Scandinavian countries, West Germi-ny, Austria,<br />
Britain, New Zealand, Australia. Those countries in particular would<br />
have what we call Democratic Socialist Labor Governments. Well,<br />
there are others one could add, the Netherlands. Now you can see<br />
from those other countries I have mentioned what would be the<br />
general attitude of an Australian Labor Government in international<br />
affairs. We would probably place particular emphasis on the United<br />
Nations. The other side in politics would be inclined to say that<br />
we would take a starry-eyed attitude towards the United Nations.<br />
Internally there would be particular emphasis by social democratic<br />
governments on government initiatives in social and as well as in<br />
economic directions. The last question I was asked regarding resources<br />
you can see as an illustration. In Australia our Government would<br />
be wanting to promote or create those public institutions for the<br />
discovery, the development, the marketing of natural resources such<br />
as the Petroleum and Minerals Authority and the Australian Industries<br />
Development Corporation.<br />
QUESTION: Can I follow this through with a supplementary question<br />
on that in light of the fact that the Foreign Minister of Malaysia<br />
referred to the organisation of South East Asiak in a regional phase<br />
as a region of peace and neutrality. Now, does the social democratic<br />
government concept, as you would apply it regionally, mean that you<br />
in effect and I know that you are working very closely in South<br />
East Asia with your neighbours that the region is gearing-itself<br />
to join the non aligned concept of the world?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My Government supports the ASEAN concept which<br />
you quote as being expressed by the Foreign Minister of Malaysia.<br />
Australia and Malaysia follow a very closely similar line in all<br />
foreign affairs matters in South East Asia and in the Indian Ocean.<br />
I'm not particularly anxious to adopt a nomenclature aligned or<br />
non-aligned. As I said in my speech to the Plenary yesterday we<br />
are aligned in some traditional ways for which we don't apologise.<br />
Nevertheless, we want to avoid a polarisation in the Indian Ocean,<br />
for instance, between the two superpowers.<br />
QUESTION: I have two other questions. The first one concerns the<br />
five nation agreement which you have among Australia, New Zealand,<br />
Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And Britain.<br />
QUESTION: Yes. What is Australia's view regarding the continued<br />
validity and effectiveness of this agreement, in particular the<br />
stationing of ASEAN Forces in Singapore? My second question is<br />
regarding the Australian Immigration policy which has caused some<br />
concern to South East Asian Governments including that of Singapore in<br />
that it has led to a brain drain from these particular countries. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Australia supports the framework of con~ sultation which<br />
the Five Power Agreement provides. I'm not sure tha' all -the<br />
correspondents would be familiar with the Five Power ,. grt; ement. It<br />
is an arrangement between Singapore, Malaysia, Britain, Australia<br />
and New Zealand. We do not believe, however, that it is necessary to<br />
have troops from Australia, or for that matter from Britain and New<br />
Zealand, stationed in Singapore, or for that matter in Malaysia,<br />
in order to preserve the advantages of consultation undX! r the Five<br />
Power Agreement. Australia no longer has soldiers in Singapore.<br />
It does have some aircraft in Malaysia and we are bv * y to have those<br />
* aircraft in Malaysia as long as they serve the purpo-! s of Malaysia<br />
as well as Australia. In effect, Malaysia at this stage does not have<br />
adequate fighter protection. She has for many years depended on<br />
Australia to provide it.<br />
You mention as your second question the position of<br />
students from South East Asia in Australia. There have-been for the<br />
last 25 years many thousands of students from South East Asia studying<br />
at Australian universities and also at technical colleges or at<br />
boarding schools. Australia believes that this is a contribution which<br />
she can make to providing skills for her neighbours, in particular<br />
areas where at this stage they do not have sufficient educational<br />
institutions themselves. There is no objective by Australia to entice<br />
bright students from her neighbours to carry on their careers in<br />
Australia. Australia is, however, very happy to make places<br />
available in her own quite crowded educationa institutions for<br />
students from ' her neighbours where they can't get thc.., e forms of<br />
training at home.<br />
QUESTION: I'm not only taling about the students but the professional<br />
people, some of whom have emigrated to Australia from developing<br />
countries like'the Philippines and Singapore.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it's not that so many people have come<br />
from the neighbour countries to practise their professions in<br />
Australia but that many who have gained professional qualifications<br />
in Australia have chosen or sought to remain in Australia. If, for<br />
instance, we were not to allow those students from South East Asia who<br />
had acquired university degrees, namely medicine or engineering, to<br />
stay in Australia we would then be accused of pursuing a raci. 1t<br />
policy. My Government, which came to office 22 months ago tomorrow,<br />
has taken the attitude that if people have quali-fications which are<br />
needed in Australia, they can come to Australia or stay in Australia<br />
irrespective of their racial or religious beliefs and, accordingly,<br />
there are, it is true, quite a number of. doctors in particular who<br />
were born in South East Asia and who are now practising in Australia.<br />
We can do with many more doctors in Australia than we have. 1 ould<br />
be, we believe, an infringement of human rights to say th .~ can't<br />
stay in Australia if they want to. Obviously, thei; qual... 1io ns<br />
are acceptable, if they were gained in Australia. 1 4 th'il' aE<br />
caused some misgivings among some of our neighbours '-hat zjiCy sent to<br />
the expense of providing their primary and secondary edu-We<br />
provided their tertiary education and then you have the iare<br />
you to say that they are not to practise their prf.~ in<br />
Australia. That they have to go home? That was said by the previous<br />
Australian Government. Some of the students, doctors generally, didn't<br />
want to go back to the countries of birth so they went to Canada<br />
instead. Now that didn't serve Australia. It didn't serve our<br />
neighbours. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
QUESTION: like to follow up the question about resources.<br />
You said jA your speech " Yet there remains for the future one of<br />
the oldest' of all the causes of war the threat of war for the<br />
possession of resources." Well, in my book, l~ ind is a resource and<br />
a very valuable one and you have about the biggest per capita<br />
possession of land in the world. Living space has been a cause of<br />
wars for some time as you well remember. What is your policy about<br />
* letting people, not qualified, not educated but Chinese, Japanese,<br />
Indian, who want a place to settle because they're hungry and there<br />
isn't enough room where they are?<br />
* PRIME MINISTER: It is true that Australia has a very large land<br />
mass. It would be one of the, what I suppose, five largest members<br />
of the United Nations territorially. Nevertheless, it is the driest<br />
country in the world. The average rainfall over the whole of<br />
Australia would be lower than that over any comparable land mass in<br />
the world. It would just not be possible to readily pvt under<br />
cultivation those parts of Australia which are not already under<br />
cultivation. It would not be possible regularly to~ pasture animals.<br />
in those parts of Australia where animals are not pastured already.<br />
I don't say fhat there are not very large tracts in Australia which.<br />
could not be used for agriculture or pasture.. I do point out,<br />
however, that it would require a very much larger capital expenditure<br />
to make them fertile, fruitful, dependable than pretty well any other<br />
part of the w~ orld-The parts of Australia which are already used for<br />
agriculture or pasture are those parts which are comparable to the<br />
other parts of the world which are used for . agriculture or-pasture.<br />
People who come to Australia don't want to settle on the land<br />
* generally. The people who come to Australia in general want to settle<br />
in the two very large cities of Sydney and Melbourne.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, on the question of oil, I understand that your<br />
Government was not consulted by the Gnited Nations when they opened<br />
the campaign here with President Ford's speech. Do you think that<br />
the strategy was good, or do you think that they got off on ti",,<br />
wrong foot, with this-question, what has been-your feeling sii~ ce<br />
you've been here about the reactions to the American campaign to get<br />
oil prices down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't been long enough-in the United Si ~ zes t,.<br />
comment appropriately or affectively on the matters you roire.<br />
Perhaps I can say that Australia is not serio~ usly aff&amp;_<br />
the oil d. wvelopments of the last 12 months as are, say, soitle<br />
industrialised countries such as Germany or France or BritriLL,,<br />
believe also that while the United State's oil reserves are,~<br />
and Australia's are quite small, in practise wp pnAudct2<br />
oil a larger percentage of the oil we use thanx does the United<br />
States. Australia produces about 70 per-cent of the oil she consu.'.-s<br />
and she will be able to produce that percentage for another ten yea -S.<br />
That's the limiting factor, the ten years, and the oil in which wo<br />
are deficient is largely the heavy oil, the lubricating fuel oil .' id<br />
so on. We are much more fortunately situated in other energy sources<br />
than we are in oil. The other point I might make is that Australia<br />
is naturally sensitive to the attitude of the developing countri(" s in<br />
the use of their resources. Geographically, we bear their attiZ.:" 1C23i<br />
in mind. Geographically,* we are not in Western Europe or North<br />
America. We are not in the North Atlantic context geographically, we<br />
are more akin therefore economically as well as geographically to </p>
<p>other countries, many of them developing countries. We share<br />
their aspirations to have a fair price for our produ'ts. We would<br />
wafit to see the price we got for our primary and natu... al products<br />
was indexed to what we happened to pay for our necessary imports.<br />
QUESTION: Yesterday, you expressed considerable concern on the<br />
question of non-poliferation or poliferation and enumerated certain<br />
agreements and initiatives that your Government favoured. You did<br />
not perhaps inadvertently or otherwise, mention the Pakistan<br />
South Asian Nuclear Free Zone. Could you tell me wh . ther your<br />
concern and support extended to the Pakistan initiative and if so<br />
does it extend strongly enough for you to vote for the item if it<br />
comes up in the General Assembly?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Our attitude towards the Pakistan proposal is the<br />
same as our attitude to the other proposals I listed. I didn't<br />
purport to make an exhaustive list. We support the gen * eral concept.<br />
We support the Pakistan proposal as well as those other ones which<br />
I did in fact mention.<br />
QUESTION: Mr-Whitlam, you were reported in Australia today as<br />
saying that the Australian representative in t ' he Security Council<br />
voted for South Africa's expulsion from the United Nations. A<br />
spokesman for Senator Willesee has been reported as saying that<br />
we have no final position. Could you reconcile the two õ tatements?<br />
PRIME MINISTER.: I don't think that I've made any pronouncement on<br />
this. I think it would be premature for me to express a view on it.<br />
We did of course, as you know, and nearly everybody else did too<br />
suppose, vote for this matter to be considered by the Security<br />
Council. We are a member of the Security Council. I wouldn't want<br />
to pre-empt the discussions on the-Security Council in which ofcourse<br />
we shall have to take part.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Whitlam, in your speech yesterday, fairly well down,<br />
you mentioned any attempt by any State to bring about political<br />
or economic change through clandestine or corrupt methods. You<br />
also mentioned about even the most powerful nations can't do this.<br />
In this country at the moment Chile is a big story. Were you<br />
referring to the United States and what has happened in Chile with<br />
the C. I. A.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know what the C. I. A. did in Chile or if they<br />
did it. I believe there have been instances over the years in which<br />
the Soviet Union as well as the United States have sought to guide<br />
events in other countries. I hope that that guidance is counterproductive<br />
and it is realised to be so.<br />
QUESTION: Will it continue to be your Government's 0izyto<br />
yield to the K. G. B. and return defectors who seek asylan in Australia<br />
as you returned the musical genius Mr Ermolenko last August.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We refused to detain Mr Ermolenko agair. c4-hius will.<br />
QUESTION: You allowed him to be with Mr Kabalevsky for 4 hours<br />
alone -during which time it-is all-eged-he changed his mind. ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTbi Mr Ermolenko was for very many hours in'the company<br />
of people. AuL'. ralians, people who were not Russians, Russian<br />
officials or Russian private citizens. There is no question that<br />
Mr Ermolenko wanted to go home. He did express apparently to a<br />
couple of Australians the view that he would like to remain in<br />
Australia. A day later, no longer, he changed his mind and he kept<br />
resolutely for several days to his wish to go home. In those<br />
circumstances it would have been a gross infringement of his rights<br />
to detain him. No man should be detained against his will.<br />
QUESTION: I apoligise if you have already been asked and answered.<br />
this question I couldn't come on time.' Iran has made some rather<br />
sweeping suggestions about the Indian Ocean and asked for Australia's<br />
cooperation, what is your reaction<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not sure what proposals or reports you have in<br />
mind. The Shah of Iran spent 8 days in Australia. He left last<br />
Friday. There were wide-ranging discussions between him and his<br />
Ministers and me and mine. We welcome the interest that the Shah has<br />
shown in the countries to the east of Iran and the countries around<br />
the Indian Ocean including our own which is diagonally across it<br />
from his country. We believe that this interest by Iran, which has<br />
become a very considerable nation under the present Shah, will be<br />
beneficial for many other countries around the Indian Ocean.<br />
QUESTION: Have you mentioned in particular the American potential<br />
base in Diego Garcia and what is your view -on that possibility of<br />
a base there? Do you oppose it, are you in favour of it, or do<br />
you have no opinion on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I know of no country around the Indian Ocean which<br />
has welcomed it.<br />
* QUSTION:. Just across the street facing this building Ihere w7as<br />
a very large demonstration the other day. The leaflet that<br />
distributed I have here which says your recognition of the<br />
incorporation of the Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania<br />
Into the Soviet Union. It goes on to say that the elected<br />
representatives, the Senate, in your country has denounced -hat<br />
decision. Do you care to comment on your reaction and trl) the<br />
Senate.. rdaction to it?<br />
PRIME MI-ISTER: You said a very large demonstration. I-was<br />
there was going to be one but I had to look very hard yesterday to<br />
see anyone. Perhaps I should point out that in Australia the Senate<br />
doesn't have the status that it has, for instance, in the United<br />
States. In Australia we have a system inherited from Great Britaint~<br />
v Parliament of Westminster. Accordingly the Government is composed<br />
'~ that party or those parties which have a majority in the House<br />
Representatives, which we call ours, just as the British<br />
wvernment is composed of that party or parties with a majority in<br />
the House of Commons. Foreign policy is determined in Australia,<br />
as in Britain or Canada or New Zealand or India other countries<br />
which have the British Parliamentary system by the Governments.<br />
It is not determined by-the Parliament, still less by the Sena.',-in<br />
our case, the House of Lords in Britain' s case. Accordingly, the<br />
a/ </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Government determines matters of foreign policy and the Government<br />
in Australia the Australian Labor Party which has a majority<br />
in the House of Representatives. Now what my Govern ent has done<br />
is to re-cognise the de jure, the incorporation of the Republics of<br />
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the Soviet Union. The historical<br />
fact is that these three countries have been, except for the<br />
years between the First and Second World Wars, parts of Russia.<br />
Lithuania has, except for those years between the two wars, been part<br />
of Russia since Catherine the Great. Estonia and Latvia have, except<br />
those years between the two world. wars, been'parts ol Russia since Peter<br />
the Great. And, before that, they were parts of Sweden since the days<br />
of Gustavus Adolphus. Now I know that in Australi-, to a certain<br />
extent, as in North America, both the U. S. and Canada, that there<br />
are migrants from those countries who pursue-the proposition that<br />
they should be separate independent states. They won't become<br />
separate independent states unless there is a world war which the<br />
Soviet Union lost. Now there are two particular points I would<br />
like to make about this. It produces unnecessary tensions in<br />
Australia, maybe also in the United States or in Canada, for people<br />
to pursue this mirage of a separate statehood independent<br />
sovereign statehood for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Some people<br />
pursue the same attitude in Australia about Croatia. Now the fact<br />
is that in the case of Croatia all of us have recognised Yugoslavia<br />
ever since 1918. None of us have ever recognised a separate state<br />
of Croatia except Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy in 1941, 42, 4<br />
and 44. Now so much for the attitude of people who have settled<br />
overseas in countries like Australia. It is a divisive policy<br />
to encourage the belief that there may be separateo. states again.<br />
I come to the attitude of people in those countries themselves. It<br />
maybe that some would again like them to be independent sovereign<br />
states. I bear in mind, however, that there was a great deal of<br />
encouragement by radio, particularly, and maybe by pamphlets,<br />
stirring up people who wanted to have a change of Government in<br />
East Germany or in Poland or Hungary or in Czechoslovakia, and there<br />
were a very great number of disappointed persons afterwards as a<br />
result of the riots in Stettin or Warsaw or Budapest in the early<br />
and middle fifties, or in Czechoslovakia in the time of Dubjeck in<br />
1969. It:-is a deception to believe that countries which could not:<br />
assist East Germany or Poland or Hungary or Czechoslovakia in the<br />
early or middle fifties or in 1969, would lift a finger to hc-lp in<br />
Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania. There are also some humanitarian<br />
considerations which led to the recognition de jure of the<br />
incorporation. Russia is a federal state. As long as Australia had<br />
diplomatic relations with Moscow on the basis of the pre or the<br />
inter-war boundaries, Australia could only make representations on<br />
behalf of people living in Australia to the Federal Government '. n<br />
Moscow. It could not make representations on what in thc 13. F r<br />
Australia would be called state matters. It couldn't mr<br />
representations to the republic governments in Estz i c and<br />
Lithuania about matters which fall within their ju. sqi,' t.<br />
QUESTION: Australia had been until last year a staunch ; upnorter<br />
of South Korea on the Korean question in the United Nati since<br />
then you have established diplomatic relations with Not. Krea.<br />
I wonder what your position would be this year? </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: At the General Assembly a year ago there was<br />
a consensus to defer consideration of the Korean question. For the<br />
first time the Assembly was not forced to a vote on this question.<br />
The general view seemed to be that it would be desirable to encourage<br />
the two governments in the Korean Peninsula to settle their<br />
differences and to give away the prospect of confrontation. The<br />
Australian Government applauded this change of attitude. It therefore<br />
worked Very patiently but steadily towards the situation where we<br />
could have diplomatic relations with both those governments. Of<br />
course, we don't presume to say what our attitude is territorially<br />
on the claims by the two governments. We don't do that in Germany,<br />
* we don't do it in Vietnam, we don't do it in Korea, but we believe<br />
these governments are both securely in power. It is therefore<br />
desirable for us to have diplomatic relations with both of them.<br />
Australia now has diplomatic relations with all the governments<br />
between Australia dnd the North Pole all of them. By diplomatic<br />
relations we don't say that we approve the nature of any government,<br />
we merely say we accept its credentials, we believe it proper to<br />
have official relations with them. We naturally hope that the<br />
relations between the two governments in the Korean Peninsula<br />
will become less strident than they have often been.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Whitlam, can you explain why you-are going to Nashville?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Come along with me and see. </p>
