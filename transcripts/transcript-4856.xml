IN'] ERVIEW WITH ' THE PRIIMIE MIISTIER AND SIR GiARLES ( flURI PER'IH, 21 OCTOBER 1978<br />
PRDbE MIS15TER: . very useful discussion. We have been assessing where<br />
we see Australia and Western Australia moving as we get into the<br />
1980' s. The meeting that will held the Loan Council in only<br />
a few days time now about infra-structure financing proposals is<br />
going to be a very historic meeting between the Premiers and the<br />
Commonwealth because it is going to make it possible for the States<br />
to borrow overseas in a way which will assist major resource projects and<br />
enable development to take place which might otherwise be held up.<br />
That is going to mean a good deal for activity it will help to<br />
make Australia more competitive, I believe it will make Australia more<br />
attractive as a centre for major resource development in a world which<br />
tends to become increasingly competitive. Australia has got an edgethis<br />
will give us a better edge.<br />
In this State the Premier has got a number of projects which are<br />
moving forward to the stage where the real activity is going to takd<br />
place and in other States also a number of proposals have been<br />
put to us which could lead to a good deal more activity and help build<br />
up the resources and infra-structure and the basic strength of Australia.<br />
The initiative for this originally came from Sir Charles, and it is<br />
a matter on which there has been a great deal of work undertaken<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States and I believe it should lead<br />
to more activity of a very real kind. The Commonwealth welcomes it<br />
in particular because it will give projects access to overseas funds<br />
in a way which doesn't fall on our Budget and doesn't make our<br />
deficit financing problems worse might otherwise be the case, and<br />
therefore the proposals are particularly welcome from that point of<br />
view. We discussed a number of matters, but the other thing that I would<br />
like to draw to attention again is that with inflation falling in<br />
Australia we are getting to a situation where Australian industries<br />
are becoming, and will continue, to become increasingly co mpetitive.<br />
They are going to get a larger share of the domestic-market, and<br />
now for the first time, for a long while, Australian industries are<br />
moving out into the export field in a very imaginative way.<br />
In this State, fishing vessels designed and built entirely in<br />
Western Australia are being exported to a number of countries overseas.<br />
This sort of thing is happening right around Australia, and again<br />
I believe augurs well for the future development of Australian industry,<br />
and getting back to something which concerns all of us to<br />
establishing more jobs so that Australians who want to work are<br />
not going to be in the difficulty which we know quite well a number<br />
are at the moment.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Premier, with regard to the Infra-structure financing<br />
what projects in particular are likely to benefit from that?<br />
PREMIER: The most important one of course, from the national and<br />
the State point of view is the pipeline from the north to : Ãµ outh<br />
it is a major undertaking by anybody's standards it is quite a<br />
dramatic thing to have a pipeline of 1000 miles built in any<br />
generation and whilst we don't need to have the money inmmediately<br />
we have to know very clearly that we will be able to borrow at the<br />
right time in the overseas market. This together, with the other<br />
projects such as the griding of the power scheme in the Pilbarra </p>
<p>and the assistance with backup for the Aiwest project are* thetype<br />
of things that will be resolved on the 1 November. I felt it was<br />
a good time to have a talk to the Prime Minister while he was<br />
here to make sure that the particular needs, the particular reasons<br />
that the State has in the scheme would be understood by him personally<br />
because we have found that his personal knowledge and intervention<br />
carries a fair bit of weight.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister, you have mentioned the fishing boat<br />
export industry here. Is it possible that the Federal Government<br />
consider using West Australian built boats for coastal surveillance<br />
and minor Defence functions as has been argued by one of our<br />
boat builders?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I know they have. The patrol boats that are<br />
being developed in Australia at the moment are being built by<br />
an Australian firm they are not being imported. So here it is<br />
a question of one Australian constructor as opposed to another.<br />
That particular Defence contract did go to a north Queensland<br />
boat builder in Cairns, but let me only say that for future<br />
Defence contracts, as that is the area that this falls in, that<br />
we will be examining any tender in Western Australia very closely.<br />
They cannot be commitments to one State in relation to that, you<br />
have got to look at all tenders on a fair basis. We certainly<br />
do intend to spend as much as the Defence equipment vote<br />
in Australian industry as possible indeed that is the policy in the<br />
total area of Government spending on capital equipment. Ina<br />
number of instance we give quite a substantial preference to<br />
Australian industry as against the imported product. I think that<br />
is the way it ought to be but it used not to be that way.<br />
We introduce d that policy when we came into office.<br />
QUESTION: It could be some years before industry recovers enough<br />
to alleviate the unemployment problem. Is it possible that the<br />
Government will introduce some interim spending measures of its<br />
own as a stop-gap measure?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This point needs to be very clearly understood.<br />
We are doing a great deal to help the unemployed at the moment.<br />
110,000 Australians, many of them young Australians, are in<br />
various training programmes, specifically helped by the Commonwealth<br />
Government, a number of them working in cooperation with States<br />
and with State resources. These programmes are monitored, they<br />
are examined, they are extended, they will be improved and that<br />
process goes on indeed, Tony Street has a major review of the<br />
programmes underway at the moment in a routine way and we will be<br />
looking at that in a few weeks time. These programmes are there,<br />
a very large number are being helped 110,000 right at this<br />
moment, and many tens of thousands have gone through the programmes<br />
and are in permanent work as a result. We ask ourselves, can these<br />
programmes be imroved, can they be extended. Ifthey can be improved,<br />
they certainly will be. / 3 </p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, you said will be have special<br />
spending programmes designed to create jobs we want to avoid the<br />
problems that a number of European countries have fallen into to,<br />
where they have subsidised jobs in particular industries and<br />
then capital, and labour and management have got locked into<br />
industries which are not competitive, which have required ever more<br />
subsidies to stay alive. Ou r programmes are quite different<br />
from that, I think they help just as many people, maybe more<br />
people, and I don't believe the sorts of employment creating<br />
schemes that Europe has pursued really end up with more people<br />
having jobs. We have found, from Australia's own experience, that<br />
Government spending runs away, if you have got more people on a<br />
Government payroll it can end up by more people being out of work<br />
because of the greater Government expenditure adds to inflation, and<br />
that disheartens private industry and they employ less.<br />
The preminent example of this was in 1973-74, when Government<br />
expenditure when up by 46%~ in one year. Obviously with many<br />
more on the Goverment payroll, but the total numbers unemployed<br />
in that one year rose by 200, 000.<br />
PREMIER: I think Mr Prime Minister, if I might mention another<br />
matter which is relevant to this employment thing on the positive<br />
side that we did discuss the programme that is being developed<br />
in connection with Yalliri, because people get the idea that all<br />
the uranium is in the Northern Territory in point of fact, of course,<br />
of the known uranium in the world is at Yalliri. This is only<br />
beginning, and I wanted to make sure that the Prime Minister<br />
understood the programme we are following, which is unchanged.<br />
We want to get on with a pilot plant, starting in January, and<br />
get that built, get it into work, and then still working on the<br />
programme, of being able to export yellow-cake from Yalliri by<br />
mid-1984. This is another side of the programme which is important<br />
to the rest of the world, because if there is any hesitancy about<br />
the Ranger uranium, we want the world to know that there are other<br />
sources of uranium in Australia and they will be developed.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Commonwealth certainly supports that.<br />
Of course, the infra-structure proposals themselves will lead to<br />
more activity, and real activity, related to real productive<br />
enterprises. They are the sorts of jobs we need in Australia for<br />
Australians. QUESTION: The Government has been criticised for its failure to<br />
spend to create work, and its popularity has slumped as a result.<br />
That is what I was trying to get at earlier, Mr Prime Minister.<br />
interim government expenditure in industry, not in the long-term<br />
not to lock industry into it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The training programmes do much of this, and<br />
the sums provided for the training programmes have increased by<br />
tens and tens of millions of dollars in this year's Budget. Much of<br />
this does help industry. But it is aquestion of where the<br />
training programmes are. If industry is prepared to provide positions,<br />
they get support under the programmes. Therefore, that is a very real<br />
and that sort of assistance will continue. What we seek to avoid,<br />
is specific subsidies to specific industries, whether it is a<br />
permanent subsidy for the labour or whatever, which locks people in in<br />
an unreal way. But again, let me get back for a moment to the total 91 4 </p>
<p>position. You can look at a particular industry in that one<br />
question, but when you look at the Commonwealth's total Budget<br />
you sometimes have to take a different view. We have a deficit<br />
and we have to fund that deficit either by your borrowing prog'rammeif<br />
the Government wants to borrow more, it tends to put up the<br />
rate of interest. If it puts up the rate of interest that is<br />
bad for industry, it is bad for home builders, we want the rate of<br />
interest to go down.<br />
We don't want the Government's borrowing requirements to be too<br />
large. If you don't want to raise it by borrowing, you have got<br />
to raise it by increased taxes perhaps. People don't like paying<br />
increased taxes and there are many people who argue that taxes<br />
are too high. Your third way of funding it is just by printing<br />
money and that, of course, is highly inflationary.<br />
There are unfortunate consequences from whichever way you seek to,<br />
fund a larger deficit there are unfortunate consequences from<br />
it, and we want to avoid those consequences because we believe they<br />
would be bad for the Australian economy, bad for activity in private<br />
industry, and especially small businesses, amongst the home building<br />
industry, which is stifled sometimes by high interest rates.<br />
Therefore the policy of getting inflation down, of getting interest<br />
rates down is a very real one and a very important one and it is.<br />
one that we intend to pursue. We don't want policies to be<br />
introduced that will cut across getting interest rates down and<br />
getting inflation down.<br />
QUESTION: Are you saying that the Government's unpopularity will<br />
have an adverse effect on business and on public confidence in the<br />
Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the business world understand the basis of<br />
our policies and they know that we are providing the sound economic<br />
base and the stability in the economic climate which will . enable<br />
them to plan for the future. I don't really believe, because every<br />
one knew that we had a difficult job at the time of the last<br />
Budget, but I think, by and large, when people stop to think<br />
there are many Australians who have given the Government credit, for<br />
having the courage to introduce what they know is a responsible<br />
Budget. I know people don't like particular items in the Budget<br />
but at the same time I am quite certain that an overwhelming majority<br />
of Australians wanted a Government that was prepared to introduce the<br />
right Budget for getting Australia right, as opposed to a Budget<br />
that would have some immediate impact on the opinion polls.<br />
There is only one poll that I am really interested in and that is the<br />
one poll that I am really interested in and that is the one that<br />
will be conducted on the date of the next Federal election.<br />
QUESTION: exports, you agree that they will go ahead in<br />
1984, even if Ranger hasn't gone-previous to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don' t want to say much about that because there are<br />
discussion taking place and it might be a little bit premature.<br />
But it is our intention that uranium mining will proceed we made.<br />
that decision and that applies obviously to Commonwealth areas,<br />
but we also want the developments to go ahead in Western Australia,<br />
if there is anything that we can do, therefore, to support Sir Charles </p>
<p>in the development of Yalliri, we would want to do.<br />
QUESTION: that particular priority Sir, it is just whichever<br />
is ready first?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We believe that Ranger should go first and I suspect<br />
that it still will. If it doesn't Sir Charles goes first.<br />
PREMIER: The market is going to need the lot. 1985 is a crucial<br />
year, when everything that your Ranger can produce, everything that<br />
we can produce, and some other places can produce will have a<br />
market. PRIME MINISTER: It is worth noting that a very socialist government<br />
in Sweden has just been reelected, a socialist government reelected, they<br />
threw out their opposition, and the main point in the election was<br />
the development of nuclear power. The socialist government wassaying<br />
nuclear power has got to be developed further Sweden has got to<br />
be preminently dependent upon nuclear power because nothing else<br />
is available. On that, they won the election.<br />
I think there was a vote also on the development of nuclear power as<br />
a separate referendum issue and Sweden voted 2-1 in favour of the<br />
further development of nuclear power, which is an interesting<br />
side-light on the attitude that some members of the Labor Party<br />
take in Australia.<br />
PREMIER: If they went to Europe today they would find that the<br />
unionmovement is right behind nuclear energy, because they have<br />
got the simply slogan no energy, no jobs.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The British Labor Government is desperately wanting<br />
to sign contracts with us.<br />
QUESTION: Sir Charles, one other point on the talks this morning.<br />
Can you give a time-scale for the introduction for any of-these<br />
other State projects you mentioned.<br />
PREMIER: Wagerup was announced this week. We will have the<br />
answers on Aiwest within a very short time now. The pipeline<br />
thing is locked into the timetable so the gas comes ashore in 1985,<br />
so you have got to come back from that point. That is where the<br />
whole of the sales and negotiation, the whole of the infra-structure<br />
are all regulated by the deadline date to bring the gas ashore and<br />
exporting it as LNG. You work back from that date. If it takes<br />
you three years for the pipeline to be constructured on land, which<br />
will be much quicker than the one in the sea of course and the<br />
platforms in the sea, then naturally this dictates the time when you<br />
want the money. Noone borrows the money and this is what I can't<br />
seem to get across to some people in Australia noone borrows the<br />
money before they want to use it,.. because you are paying interest<br />
on it from the date you start to draw. We have got to know that<br />
when the time comes we can have this money. I emphasise it is<br />
not a question of wanting to draw it immdiately, it is a question<br />
of drawing it to fit in with the construction timetable.<br />
I would be the last one to borrow it a day before I have to.<br />
QUESTION: Can we take it then that the North-West Shelfi is going<br />
ahead? / 6 </p>
<p>PREMIER: I have got no doubts in my mind. Everything is<br />
running on time. The $ 55m final evaluation programme with<br />
design and finance and marketing negotiations is right on time,, and<br />
I have no qualms about it at all.<br />
QUESTION: Have you had any indication from the companies that they<br />
will proceed?<br />
PREMIER: When I went away abroad in May and June it was to talk<br />
to all the top people in the consortium we keep in touch all the<br />
time. The timetable is right on time, and put it this way, there<br />
is not the slightest suggestion ever been made to me, nor canlI<br />
see it on the horizon, which is adverse to the project.<br />
QUESTION: The companies are still reluctant to say<br />
PREMIER: They are very wisely reluctant to say. They have until<br />
the end of September. I am hoping that they will make the<br />
announcement on the 29 September 1979 it happens to be two things:<br />
it is the 150th anniversary, and it is my birthday.<br />
I am not suggesting that is why we fixed the date 30 September<br />
for the final announcement, but it would be alovely conincidence.<br />
QUESTION: On the overseas borrowings. will: the Commonwealth retain<br />
the right of veto despite the fact that all States might agree...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think if all States were agreeing on a project<br />
it would be unusual for the Commonwealth not to support it.<br />
It was recognised that the present voting procedures were introduced<br />
on a trial basis and also, against the background that the Commonwealth<br />
does retain ultimate responsibility for monetary control and<br />
overall financial management.<br />
PREMIER: We-accepted this on the basis that first of all-we are<br />
breaking the 50 years of history, and secondly on the trial basis<br />
so you have got to go step by step and we accepted it as being<br />
a sensible way to break the ice.<br />
QUESTION: You are quite happy now with the guidelines?<br />
PREMIER; Some aspects of it we will never be happy with, but we<br />
did accept the fact, as a matter of good sense, after 50 years<br />
you couldn't expect to throw the doors wide open and we agreed<br />
that provided there was a genuine undertaking for a review after a<br />
trial period we were satisfied to go along with it, and that<br />
makes good sense to me.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the proof of it will be in performance.<br />
QUESTION: Apparently in 1929 there was a referendum where the<br />
Commonwealth had to come a bail out the States because of overseas<br />
borrowings. PREMIER: In 1927 the Loan Council was set up and that is an historic<br />
date and that is why I say 50 years.<br />
