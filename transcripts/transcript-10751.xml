    <content><![CDATA[<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister how are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Richard. Now I know a good project that will generate</p>
<p>   jobs for Australians when I see it. That is why we supported it.</p>
<p>   This is not anything other than a fund designed to support really</p>
<p>   long-term infrastructure that will help the country. And this will</p>
<p>   help Western Australia enormously because it will support the oil</p>
<p>   and gas industry, it will support the ship building industry, it</p>
<p>   will provide a lot of additional skills and it will generate jobs.</p>
<p>   And the unions are supporting it, the Labor Party is supporting</p>
<p>   it. You don't get many things that draws that kind of unity</p>
<p>   front.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Have you been to Jervoise Bay before, down there? Have you been</p>
<p>   down there before?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think I had specifically been to that part of it before,</p>
<p>   but I certainly know that area well.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>What did you think about the amount of ship building and ferry</p>
<p>   building that was going on down there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am very conscious of the contribution that it has made to the</p>
<p>   economy of the State and I am also aware that there was some debate</p>
<p>   about the bounty. I should remind you that that bounty has been</p>
<p>   retained, and I should also tell your listeners, that we are reviewing</p>
<p>   that bounty to make certain that we remain competitive with the</p>
<p>   rest of the world. And I just want to say to the ship building industry,</p>
<p>   there is no way we are going to allow it to become uncompetitive.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Any less competitive? You will keep it at least as competitive....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are not going to let it fall behind.</p>
<p>PREMIER COURT:</p>
<p>I think that was all the industry was asking for.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>That is right, yes.</p>
<p>PREMIER COURT:</p>
<p>The industry for years was a highly protected industry, I think</p>
<p>   their protection levels were up over 30 per cent at one stage.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Only 5 now.</p>
<p>PREMIER COURT:</p>
<p>It has now dropped down to a very [inaudible]..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They had a perfectly legitimate argument, we listened to it, we</p>
<p>   changed it and we are not going to make that, we are not going to</p>
<p>   sort of recreate the problem that was concerning them.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>A lot of people down there, if they are listening, clapping at</p>
<p>   the moment because they were a bit on tenter hooks for a while.</p>
<p>PREMIER COURT:</p>
<p>I think what is exciting about, when you see where these vessels</p>
<p>   are going to, some to China, the Middle East, to the Mediterranean,</p>
<p>   to Scandinavian countries and the fact that we have built, not just</p>
<p>   the ability to construct them, but the ability to design them it</p>
<p>   really has become a high-tech industry. And we just want to thank</p>
<p>   the Federal Government for their financial support in relation to</p>
<p>   the Jervoise Bay infrastructure. Because that takes us into a whole</p>
<p>   new field and that is, not only servicing the off-shore oil and</p>
<p>   gas industry but the downstream processing that is taking place.</p>
<p>   And I gave the example yesterday of the HPI plant at Port Hedland,</p>
<p>   it is a $2 billion investment and the modules are being built in</p>
<p>   different parts of the world and then being assembled on site. We</p>
<p>   will now have the opportunity to win more of those contracts and</p>
<p>   the challenge really goes back out to the private sector now. The</p>
<p>   Government, the Federal and State Governments are putting that infrastructure</p>
<p>   in place and we want them to now tender aggressively and it really</p>
<p>   will become a great long-term employment generator.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well that is it for you Premier.</p>
<p>PREMIER COURT:</p>
<p>Just a quick one Mr Prime Minister. Did you enjoy the OZ Concert</p>
<p>   yesterday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Terrific. It is a great, I had not been to that entertainment centre,</p>
<p>   but it was a terrific centre. And the concert, the quality and variety</p>
<p>   it was terrific. It is a great event, really a great, happy, harmonious,</p>
<p>   everybody together sort of event.</p>
<p>PREMIER COURT:</p>
<p>Well you are in the best State at the best time. Time for me to</p>
<p>   leave.</p>
<p>[COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Australia is my guest in the studio and good</p>
<p>   to see him here in Western Australia. He was supposed to be here</p>
<p>   last year but he got put down with a bout, not put down but, and</p>
<p>   by a bout of pneumonia. How did you pull up after that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am in great shape. And I have spent the Australia Day weekend</p>
<p>   here in Perth and it has been great. The Australian of the Year</p>
<p>   announced on Sunday. And it is the first Australia Day I have been</p>
<p>   able to spend in Perth and it really is a great thing that the announcement</p>
<p>   of the Australian of the Year now goes around the country and is</p>
<p>   not done always in Sydney, as used to be the case before.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well I told you, I said you have got to spend more time here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well indeed I do, I have. Over the years I have a very, very good</p>
<p>   record of regularly visiting Western Australia and it is great to</p>
<p>   be here.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Big announcement yesterday, for Western Australia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very big.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Lots of jobs, you must be feeling pretty warm and fuzzy about it,</p>
<p>   I feel an election coming on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No there's no election coming on. The next election is not</p>
<p>   due until March of next year. That announcement is a quality commitment</p>
<p>   of $80 million to something that is going to help industry, it is</p>
<p>   going to build infrastructure, it is going to generate jobs and</p>
<p>   it is coming out of a Federation Fund of $1 billion that is designed</p>
<p>   to fund long-term beneficial infrastructure for the benefit of Australia</p>
<p>   and to generate jobs. We need as a nation to renew our infrastructure</p>
<p>   as we go into the 21st Century. And I can't think of anything</p>
<p>   better in Western Australia than an infrastructure that will support</p>
<p>   the oil and gas industry, the ship building industry, provide high-tech</p>
<p>   skills, additional training. I mean, it is a win-win for everybody.</p>
<p>   It is being supported by the unions, supported by both Governments,</p>
<p>   it will generate a lot of jobs in the construction phase and several</p>
<p>   thousand direct and indirect jobs in the long-term operating phase.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Virtually no government in Australia has actually won the unemployment</p>
<p>   battle for almost two decades now, if you are seen to be doing that</p>
<p>   people are going to support you at the polls, you know that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Howard, we are determined to do everything we can to get unemployment</p>
<p>   down because it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I mean if you got it down a couple of per cent you would be in</p>
<p>   for as long as you like.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard I want to get it down as much as I can for the benefit it</p>
<p>   gives to giving people jobs. If there is an electoral consequence,</p>
<p>   either way so be it. But we have a commitment to strengthen the</p>
<p>   economy to generate jobs. And the only way you generate jobs is</p>
<p>   you have a faster growing economy and that is why all of our economic</p>
<p>   policies have been to that end and that will continue to be the</p>
<p>   case. That is why we are committed to things like taxation reform</p>
<p>   because it will produce a faster growing, a stronger economy. That</p>
<p>   is why we reduced the budget deficit, and thank God we did. We inherited</p>
<p>   a $10.5 billion deficit from Kim Beazley and if we had left it we</p>
<p>   would now have been knocked around a lot more by what has happened</p>
<p>   in Asia. I mean, just imagine where we would have been now, in relation</p>
<p>   to what happened in Asia, if we had taken the Beazley advice and</p>
<p>   done nothing to fix the deficit. Not only did he leave us with the</p>
<p>   problem he then tried to hinder us fixing it. It is like lighting</p>
<p>   the fire in the building and then when the fire brigade arrives</p>
<p>   chopping off the hoses. I mean that is basically what they tried</p>
<p>   to do.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But it is going to effect Australia's growth, the Asian economic</p>
<p>   dilema, it must have some effect?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, the effect has been very significantly reduced.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But how much?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is too early to make judgements about particular impacts in</p>
<p>   particular areas. But the clear message out of all of this, is that</p>
<p>   we are strong, we have been made stronger by the actions of the</p>
<p>   Government over the last 22 months. And it means that we have been</p>
<p>   able to withstand the impact, we haven't seen confidence levels</p>
<p>   effected.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But the reason (inaudible) it is not going to bite in immediately.</p>
<p>   It will be the end of the year won't it? Most of the economists,</p>
<p>   in fact today are saying, round the end of 1998 is when we are really</p>
<p>   going to start to feel it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Those same economists are pointing a very...painting, a very strong</p>
<p>   and positive picture about the domestic economy. They are pointing</p>
<p>   to very strong growth. They are pointing to things like industrial</p>
<p>   harmony. I mean, I learnt yesterday that in 1996 the level of industrial</p>
<p>   disputes fell to the lowest level it had been in Australia since</p>
<p>   1940, that is 56 years ago and the indications are that the figures</p>
<p>   in 1997 are going to continue that trend.</p>
<p>Now remember, before we were elected, we were told by the Labor</p>
<p>   Party, by Bill Kelty and all of the doomsayers, that if we introduced</p>
<p>   our industrial relations reforms there would be mayhem, there would</p>
<p>   be industrial disputation. But you have got the remarkable situation</p>
<p>   where we have changed for the better, the industrial relations system,</p>
<p>   despite Labor Party suggestions to the contrary. There are fewer</p>
<p>   industrial disputes in Australia now than at any time since 1940</p>
<p>   and that was at the darkest times of World War II. Now that is a</p>
<p>   measure of the success of those industrial relations.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>There is another reason to go to the polls.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, the timing of the election is something that is not in</p>
<p>   my mind at present. I would like, ideally, to go the full three</p>
<p>   years. Now the question of when, precisely...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You are going to maximise your chances...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, I am not going to exchange banter with any commentator</p>
<p>   in Australia about when the next election is going to be.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, well, what is your prediction on interest rates, when</p>
<p>   are they going to rise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't accept that they are going to rise. I don't accept</p>
<p>   that for a moment.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>What..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>..I can't talk about 100 years from now.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I am talking about within one year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, this is what I will say and this is the only thing I will</p>
<p>   say about interest rates, is that we created the conditions whereby</p>
<p>   interest rates have fallen by 2.5 to 3 per cent and our management</p>
<p>   of the economy has given us the lowest interest rate climate in</p>
<p>   Australia for 25 years. Housing interest rates in Australia now</p>
<p>   are lower than what they have been at any time since the late 1960s.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No one disagrees with that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it is very important...and I see no circumstances</p>
<p>   before me at the present time which suggests that that is going</p>
<p>   to...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>...Bond rates are rising aren't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But Howard, look that...I deal in current reality.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, but you have got to plan for the future.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am and we are planning to further strengthen the Australian economy</p>
<p>   against any adverse circumstances from the rest of the world. That</p>
<p>   is why we need a new tax system. That is why we can't go into</p>
<p>   the 21st century with the present tax system.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you reading my script here are you? Because I was going to</p>
<p>   talk to you about the tax.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am not reading anything. I am talking about the future of</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Now let's talk about tax. Can you clarify for the</p>
<p>   listeners of this programme, who are some of your electors, whether</p>
<p>   or not there will be a proposition for a goods and services tax</p>
<p>   in the tax reform package you offer to us?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'll tell you what I can say to your listeners, is that we</p>
<p>   will offer a comprehensive tax reform plan to the Australian public</p>
<p>   before the next election, that will address the weaknesses of the</p>
<p>   present system. And the two weaknesses are:</p>
<p>   * We have a ramshackle wholesale tax system where you tax orange</p>
<p> juice but you don't tax caviar.</p>
<p>   * You tax the family motor car at a very high rate but you don't</p>
<p> tax lear jets.</p>
<p>You have got to do something about that and you also have a situation</p>
<p>   whereby the year 2000 the top marginal rate of tax will apply at</p>
<p>   1.2 times average weekly earnings, whereas, in the mid 1950s, it</p>
<p>   applied at 19 times, 19 times average weekly earnings. Now you can't</p>
<p>   go on forever with a tax system like that. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>That could be all put aside with a straight out goods and services</p>
<p>   tax.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, we are going to offer an integrated plan.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But not a complicated one.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it won't be complicated it will be very simple. It will</p>
<p>   offer people lower personal tax and it will offer a system that</p>
<p>   is harder to rort. There will be people...the only people that will</p>
<p>   be hurt under my tax plan will be the tax cheats, they will get</p>
<p>   hurt because they won't be able to evade their tax liabilities.</p>
<p>   And one of the advantages of reforming the tax system is that you</p>
<p>   get at the cash economy and we are not going to, in our tax reform</p>
<p>   plans, we are not going to, of course, to tolerate arrangements</p>
<p>   whereby just some people can evade their liabilities and others,</p>
<p>   the ordinary PAYE tax payer, is obliged to pay their full obligation.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Will you compensate people on social security who may see their</p>
<p>   basic essentials costs go up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Ok. So that will be included in things like....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...Oh yes. I have made that clear at the very outset that people</p>
<p>   who are entitled to compensatory adjustments...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Would that be a rise in their pension?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, there are a variety of ways in the things we are doing and</p>
<p>   I am...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>(Inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...Well several ways. But I can say to those people that no person</p>
<p>   on fixed incomes, no pensioner, will be disadvantaged, in fact,</p>
<p>   they will find they will be advantaged by the changes we have in</p>
<p>   mind.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>There are "sorry" books being sent all round the country</p>
<p>   at the moment. Will you be signing one?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have already said...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You haven't got one there have you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I just want to...I am glad you asked me that question. I mean</p>
<p>   there is a lot of nonsense being talked about my position on this.</p>
<p>   I just would like your listeners to hear, this is what I said in</p>
<p>   May of last year: </p>
<p>"let me make this clear, personally I feel deep sorrow for</p>
<p>   those of my fellow Australians who suffered injustices under the</p>
<p>   practices of past generations towards indigenous people. Equally,</p>
<p>   I am sorry for the hurt and trauma many people here today continue</p>
<p>   to feel as a consequence of those practices".</p>
<p>Now that was a genuine spontaneous expression of my own view. So</p>
<p>   when people say to me why don't you say sorry, I have already</p>
<p>   done so. And I have repeated that and I repeat it on your program</p>
<p>   this morning.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You said personally didn't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course. The deeds that occurred at that particular time were</p>
<p>   deeds that were authorised by the law of the country, the law of</p>
<p>   the states mainly - at that particular time - and they were based</p>
<p>   upon what was regarded as the right thing to do in those particular</p>
<p>   circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, I think the notion of a formal apology by this generation,</p>
<p>   this Government, in relation to the acts of earlier generations,</p>
<p>   I don't think that is appropriate. It is very easy and some</p>
<p>   people might even see it as insincere, of a current government to</p>
<p>   say look we will apologise for what other governments did. I mean,</p>
<p>   normally, I mean the really strong thing to do is to apologise when</p>
<p>   you, yourself, make a mistake. It is easy to apologise for other</p>
<p>   people's mistakes. It is a lot harder to apologise for your</p>
<p>   own.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Do you think a formal government apology would be followed by compensation</p>
<p>   claims?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have no doubt, that as occurred in Canada, that a formal</p>
<p>   government apology would not be accepted as the end of the matter.</p>
<p>   I have no doubt that if a formal government apology were made some</p>
<p>   people would then say well if it is good enough to make a formal</p>
<p>   apology then it is good enough to pay compensation. And let me remind</p>
<p>   your listeners that the Labor Party, when it was in power, despite</p>
<p>   what it is now saying, trenchantly opposed payment of compensation</p>
<p>   when the stolen children case was taken to the High Court they strongly</p>
<p>   and comprehensively and trenchantly opposed it. </p>
<p>Now, I think a lot of Australians listening to your programme would</p>
<p>   think there was something rather hypocritical about a government</p>
<p>   saying: well, we're going to give a formal apology on behalf</p>
<p>   of an earlier government, but don't ask us to entertain the</p>
<p>   idea of compensation. How sincere is that? If you really are prepared</p>
<p>   to assume the collective responsibility of the deeds of an earlier</p>
<p>   government and you are prepared to say that it was comprehensively</p>
<p>   wrong and then you turn around and say no compensation. I think</p>
<p>   that is the height of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Do you think the Âsorry' books were a stunt?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, it's a free society.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Hazel Hawke was on this programme, the former wife of the former</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, saying - on this programme: perhaps we shouldn't</p>
<p>   be saying sorry, perhaps we should be saying regret because if we</p>
<p>   say sorry formally, that means that we are admitting responsibility.</p>
<p>   And then she went ahead and signed the book.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But I mean, exactly. I mean, this is my point. I mean, let us be</p>
<p>   sincere...I mean, I am sincerely sorry for the maltreatment of any</p>
<p>   child in Australia in any generation...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Including those who were dragged out from England...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In any set of circumstances, of course. But this idea that you</p>
<p>   can some-how or other solve a problem by a government in 1998 saying,</p>
<p>   well, I'm going to formally apologise for what happened decades</p>
<p>   ago. I mean, I played no part in that and many of the people who</p>
<p>   were involved in those practises thought they were doing the right</p>
<p>   thing.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How did you vote in 1967? Did you vote...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I voted in favour of the change. Of course I did.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All of us did, didn't we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course. It had a huge level of support. Of course I voted in</p>
<p>   favour of the change. And the best way to help is to remedy current</p>
<p>   disadvantage and look to the future.</p>
<p>[COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I have the Prime Minister of Australia here. He's been here</p>
<p>   for how long, three days, four days?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed, three days. I'm going to Adelaide this afternoon.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know, good luck to you. Stick around if you want</p>
<p>   to. You like cricket, don't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I do.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>What about Adam Gilchrist?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very, very impressive. Very good performance. And it'll be</p>
<p>   a great day today.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You just missed him. We had him on with the Premier...change rooms</p>
<p>   and I told him it's fifty or nothing for him again today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was a very good performance.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Now, the republican convention. What do you hope comes out of it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I hope a clear view, a clear majority emerges for a republican</p>
<p>   alternative.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Do you really?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hang on, hang on. So that that alternative can be put to the Australian</p>
<p>   people in a referendum. I think this issue has got to be resolved.</p>
<p>   I am a supporter of the present system, not because I'm sort</p>
<p>   of infatuated by any of the trappings of it, but I think it has</p>
<p>   worked very well. And I haven't been persuaded yet that the</p>
<p>   alternatives on offer would be better. And of all the alternatives...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But can you be persuaded?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, I am an open-minded person. None of the alternatives</p>
<p>   on offer that I've seen are better. Therefore I don't</p>
<p>   think I can be.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Why do we need a President?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think you do need somebody to perform the ceremonial part of</p>
<p>   government.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. And that is the advantage of the present system.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So not another tier of government.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, you don't need another tier of government and that is</p>
<p>   the danger of having an elected presidency, a popularly elected</p>
<p>   president. Because he or she would get delusions of grandeur. He</p>
<p>   or she would believe that they'd become an alternative power</p>
<p>   centre to that of the Prime Minister. Now, I'm not saying that</p>
<p>   now just because I'm the current Prime Minister. It's</p>
<p>   the system of government that counts. And if you have a parliamentary</p>
<p>   system of government and you elect members of Parliament, they choose</p>
<p>   a cabinet, the cabinet's headed up by the Prime Minister and</p>
<p>   then you also elect a President, given the political culture of</p>
<p>   Australia you will create division, rivalry, contestability and</p>
<p>   you'll end up with...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So if it was going to be a republic you'd have a President</p>
<p>   who didn't have the power to sack the Government, is that right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no. I would...look, if you have a republic you need as</p>
<p>   closely as possible to mirror the present system. Now, I'm</p>
<p>   not arguing for a republic, let me make that clear, I'm not.</p>
<p>   I'm against it. I mean, I voted for anti-republican candidates</p>
<p>   in the convention ballot. But I think it's my responsibility</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister to make this convention work. I'm not trying</p>
<p>   to be negative. I'm not trying to trip people up. I accept</p>
<p>   there is a strong push in this country to change the present system</p>
<p>   and I want...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, we just want to grow up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't feel juvenile, but...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>If you were an English citizen and your ultimate head of State</p>
<p>   resided in Canberra, how would you feel about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it would depend upon the historical circumstances behind</p>
<p>   it. I mean, I can only speak as I feel and I don't feel that</p>
<p>   my country is less independent than any other country.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But our ultimate head of State is a foreigner.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm just saying how I feel. I mean, these things are...we</p>
<p>   all have our feelings and I understand, as I said in my speech in</p>
<p>   Melbourne, I understand the feelings of people who want to change.</p>
<p>   I accept that. And what I'm trying to do is play a constructive</p>
<p>   role at the convention.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But you don't want it to turn into a bun fight.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't want it to turn into a bun fight about people</p>
<p>   who support the present system and people who oppose it. In a sense,</p>
<p>   you're never going to solve that. I mean, you're not going</p>
<p>   to turn Bruce Ruxton into a republican and you're not going</p>
<p>   to turn Malcolm Turnbull into a monarchist. So let us not even try.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But should Bruce Ruxton and people of like mind be over there in</p>
<p>   Canberra working towards bringing forward a model?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, they should. But equally the Malcolm Turnbulls and the Ted</p>
<p>   Macks and all the other people who want to change, they should understand</p>
<p>   that those who support the present system are not lesser Australians</p>
<p>   and that those who support the present system do so in the main</p>
<p>   because it's brought enormous stability and cohesion into our</p>
<p>   society. So what we should do at the convention is to try and agree</p>
<p>   on what the alternative should be if we decide to change and then</p>
<p>   we can put it to the people.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>When do you think the people of Australia should have a vote?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have promised that they will have a vote before the year</p>
<p>   2000 so that if they do vote for change, that change can be inaugurated</p>
<p>   at the beginning of the centenary of federation.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Now, that will be January 1, 2001.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, obviously with that date coming up, if there is to be a change,</p>
<p>   then that would be a suitable time for it to occur, if there's</p>
<p>   to be a change. Now, equally, if there's not to be a change</p>
<p>   then I think it's something that ought to be off the agenda</p>
<p>   when we celebrate our centenary.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Now, if there's to be a change should that become our national</p>
<p>   day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a hard one. The problem with the 1st of January, quite</p>
<p>   apart from anything else, is that it will end up getting lost with</p>
<p>   New Years Day and New Years Eve and that's one of the difficulties.</p>
<p>   But the day in Australia's history that still evokes the deepest</p>
<p>   emotion is Anzac Day. Now, I know there are fewer and fewer people</p>
<p>   who were involved in the war and I accept all of that</p>
