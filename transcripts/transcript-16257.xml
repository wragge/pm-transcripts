    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today announced $45 500 in funding assistance for the Lima based Sisters of Mercy Family Health Service.</p>
<p>Before attending the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, the Prime Minister visited the Service and said the new funding would significantly improve the quality of healthcare provided by the Australian-based Sisters of Mercy Congregation.</p>
<p>The Sisters will purchase their first x-ray machine with the new funds. This machine will mainly be used for chest x-rays due to the high incidence of tuberculosis in the local area. </p>
<p>The Australian Government has also funded some additional medical equipment including two centrifuges and a fetal heart monitor.</p>
<p>The Mercy Family Health Service, directed by Joan Doyle, was established in 2002.</p>
<p>In the last 12 and half years the Sisters have worked closely with the local people to establish three women's houses and two childcare centres in addition to this medical service.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister looks forward to seeing the future achievements of the Sisters of Mercy as they continue to devote their life's work to this most important cause.</p>
