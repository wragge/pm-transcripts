    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased to announce that the Governor-General, as Chancellor of the Order of Australia, has approved, for conferral today, awards to a number of outstanding Australian civilians and military personnel who have served with distinction in Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Neil Mules has been appointed an Officer in the Order of Australia for his outstanding service as Australia';s representative in Iraq.  Mr Mules has worked tirelessly to ensure that we have a strong and effective Australian presence in Iraq and he has been instrumental in advancing Australia';s significant commercial, security, political and humanitarian interests in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>Ms Heidi Venamore and Mr Chris McNicol have each been awarded a Public Service Medal in recognition of their achievements in furthering Australia';s interests in Iraq under difficult and challenging circumstances.  Ms Venamore is the Deputy Head and Mr McNicol is the Director, Political and Economic in the Australian Representative Office in Iraq.</p>
<p>It is always a pleasure and as Prime Minister I am extremely proud to also have the opportunity of acknowledging the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have served this country so magnificently and successfully in this campaign in Iraq.  Today we recognise, with the award of the Australian Active Service Medal, a representative group of our military personnel who have been engaged in military operations and who have served with distinction in this campaign.</p>
<p>There are many others who will be recognised with this award in the months ahead but today';s ceremony in Baghdad gives us all an opportunity to reflect upon the contribution of our military services and to honour those servicemen and women who have selflessly responded to the challenges facing our world today.  All those honoured today have been working under difficult and challenging conditions and it is appropriate that the awards are made at this time as it is uncertain when they will be in Australia to receive their awards.</p>
<p>On behalf of the nation I thank all those who have served with such distinction in Iraq.  </p>
