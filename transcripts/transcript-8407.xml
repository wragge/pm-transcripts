PRIME MINISTER 15/ 92<br />
FOR MEDIA<br />
FEBRUARY ECONOMIC STATEMENT LOCK-UP DETAILS<br />
The Economic Statement will be delivered by the Prime<br />
Minister in Parliament at 7.30pm, Wednesday, February 26.<br />
Lock-up arrangements will revert to the old Budget-style<br />
lock-ups.<br />
There will be three lock-ups one in Parliament House,<br />
Canberra and one each in Sydney and Melbourne. These will<br />
commence from 2.00pm on February 26.<br />
All venues will be ' media only' lock-ups.<br />
The Parliament House venue will centre around the Main<br />
Committee Room. One committee room will be set aside for the<br />
PM's press conference to be held during the lock-up,<br />
probably about 5.00pm<br />
Access arrangements to the Parliament House Committee Rooms<br />
( including for installation and testing of equipment etc.)<br />
will be the responsibility of individual attendees and/ or<br />
organisations. Access will generally be available from<br />
Tuesday, February 25, 1992.<br />
Access to Sydney and Melbourne lock-ups will be similar.<br />
Media are reminded of the terms and conditions for entry to<br />
the lock-up. A sample Form of Undertaking is attached for<br />
information. Any breach of the undertaking may result in the<br />
journalist and/ or organisation being banned from future<br />
lock-ups.<br />
A note will be posted on the Press Gallery notice board.<br />
Organisations should nominate those seeking access to the<br />
lock-ups, which venue they wish to attend. This note will<br />
be collected every few days. </p>
<p>Those unable to advise in this manner can contact Peter<br />
Jackson on ( 06) 271 5328. All names of those intending to<br />
attend the lock-up must be received by February<br />
Normal telephone equipment for use at the end of the lock-up<br />
will be arranged locally if requested. Specialised equipment<br />
will need to be initiated by individuals/ organisations<br />
direct with Telecom ( after details have been cleared through<br />
the relevant Government official).<br />
Further to this note, I have written directly to major media<br />
organisations about more technical details.<br />
For the Canberra venue, a plan of the Committee Rooms with<br />
designated space allocation will be displayed in the press<br />
gallery as soon as possible.<br />
Attendees should make their own arrangements for<br />
refreshments. For any gencal information about lock-up arrangements<br />

Cabinet) on ( 06). 271 5328.<br />
