SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTEA,", THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES AT CENTRAL METHODIST MISSION ON SUNDAY,<br />
6TH SEPTEMER, _ 9D<br />
I was reminded and kindly, by a newspaper yesterday<br />
that this will be the 26th appearance of mine in this rostrum,<br />
in this pulpit that's a long time isn't it?<br />
When I bagan my second chapter of these appearames<br />
about 14 or 15 years ago, Dr. Benson used to preteqyilchat I<br />
came here to say something about the anniversary oi the second<br />
lar but since then, in the last few years, he's become rather<br />
" Father's day" minded. I don't mind telling you that I had no<br />
idea it was Father's Day until just before lunch when three<br />
turbulent grandsons, and one turbulent grand-daughter, arrived<br />
to have lunch with us, and each of them, with that magnificent<br />
gesture of generosity that has been hinted at by Dr. Benson,<br />
presented me with the noblest of all gifts: a bag of peanuts<br />
in the shell. I got a great kick out of it. They all ceme in,<br />
one after the other and said: " Hellos Grandpa, Father's Day<br />
present". And of course you know what young grand-children<br />
are like at least some of you do. Having presented you with a<br />
bag of something edible, they stand around expectantly and so a<br />
good time was had by all ( Laughter).<br />
In spite of it being Father's Day I still like, when I<br />
come here, to say something about the state of the world. It is<br />
ful of problems. I had the great good fortune earlier this year<br />
to go around the world and to have long talks, and intimate and<br />
friendly talks with no less than ten heads of Government. This<br />
is, of course, always a very illuminating experience.<br />
Each year one imagines that one understands what the<br />
problems are for the next 12 months, or two years, but it never<br />
quite works out like that. Today's red hot problem is out of<br />
the news in six weeks, because some other problem has taken its<br />
place. You just look back a little and remember that it isn't<br />
so long ago that we were reading anxiously about matters affecLing<br />
Quemoy and the Matsu Islands off the Chinese coast, with<br />
Formosa in the background, and wondering how this might blow up<br />
trouble in the world trouble not very remote from us because<br />
we have had a faculty, and a very proper one, of becoming involved<br />
in the world's problems, right through the lifetimes of<br />
all of us. And then that just dropped out of the news, though<br />
it didn't drop out of existence, and we began to read about Laos<br />
and the great troubles they are having in that small, but not so<br />
very remote country in South East Asia. Just as that matter<br />
was beginning to lodge in the minds of a great number of thoughtful<br />
people, there was trouble on the border between India and<br />
Tibet and my distinguished friend, Mr. Nehru, found himself<br />
compelled to say things and to contemplate things that he had<br />
hoped never to say, or to contemplate.<br />
So the world is shifting and changing in detail all<br />
the time, and somebody who understands these problems, or hcpes<br />
that he does, today, may, unless he takes care to pursue thcm,<br />
find that he knows nothing about them in 12 months' time.<br />
I mention that to you because I want to establish thr.<br />
this is a very strange, shifting, uncertain, uneasy sort o<br />
world. But if life is strange and shifting and uneasy it doosn C<br />
make us enjoy it any the less. Uhat we need to do is to Lahvc a<br />
look occasionally at the things that are not changing or shift,.<br />
ing, so that we may get our sense of balance when we ccntor&gt; . t<br />
world affairs. And therefore today Imrnrt going zo ta. 1k to -c<br />
in particular, but I want to talk to you a little in the. bro√∏ d<br />
about some of these matters.<br />
I remember, Dr. Benson, that during the war h-hun T<br />
the not unhappy task of being Leader of the Opposition., hc mg<br />
been Prime Minister a post which. no doubt, if I rea2-</p>
<p>I will once more occupy some day and I well remember at that<br />
time a very earnest man from America being in Canberra. He was<br />
one of those men you have occasionally met them whose earnestness<br />
overwhelms their sense of proportion, who are wishful<br />
thinkers, who feel that whatever happens next must be good and<br />
right and, therefore, it will happen. And he said to me: " What<br />
would you think would be the state of affairs in the world<br />
years after peace?" and I admit that somewhat lightheartedly, I<br />
said to him: " Well I would think that ten years after the war I<br />
would think that Nationalism would have grown greatly at the<br />
expense of Internationalism. I would think that freedom would be<br />
enjoyed by rather fewer people and I would think that on the<br />
d. hole tariff barriers would be higher". He almost collapsed.<br />
He said to me: " What a dreadful series of remarks to make." And<br />
I said, " W4ell, I thought you wanted to know what I believed; if<br />
you only want to know what Ithtink will please you, of course,<br />
all that is wrong",<br />
I mention that because we will not properly understand<br />
this world that we are living in, this world in which we in<br />
Australia are a small and highly exposed unit, unless we face up<br />
to the facts of what has happened since the war. It was a war<br />
to defend freedom and a very just war to defend froedom, and it<br />
was a war to defend it ag-ainst one of the most wickeC. 1 dictators<br />
that the world has yet produced.<br />
But since the war hundreds of millions of people in<br />
this world have become members of dictator countries, largely<br />
against their own will. You think of countries like Poland and<br />
Czechoslovakia, to a lesser degree perhaps Yugoslavia, countries<br />
right up through the middle band of Europe, countries which were,<br />
you know, historically, t'he homes of freedom, and today they are<br />
satellites of the most powerful dictatorship in the world, not<br />
by their own choice, but by force and conquest. At that time<br />
before the war the people of China were not, peri-aps, the pcoplp'<br />
of a PAation, because it is a great error to think that because a<br />
country is a vast area, geographically on the map, it is in<br />
consequence a Nation. No, China, continental China., was a group<br />
of communities with individual War Lords occasionally warring<br />
with eacti other. It wasn't a concentrated nation with a concerted<br />
national mind a. nd national feeling as ours is. But at<br />
any rate it preserved the ancient culture. It had a faith. It<br />
lived, so to speak, its own life, And today, it, with all its<br />
hundreds of millions of people, is governed by a dictatorship.<br />
You see what I mean, that we are not to suppose that<br />
the world has not changed since the war, or that all the changes<br />
have been for the better. The fact is that there are hundreds<br />
of millions of people who once felt that they were free, who<br />
now know that they are not. And if we shut our eyes to that<br />
fact we do badly, if we are to have a balanced view of the<br />
world. There is a socond aspect to this that I would like to<br />
say a little about : Nationalism. You know really, a lot of us<br />
thought didn't we -in the course of t'. ae war, that' when, it was<br />
over there would be a new, international organization and that<br />
we would become all rather less national, and a little more<br />
international, a little less insistent upon our own. rights and a<br />
little more concerned with the rights of the community of men<br />
and women around the world. Yet since the war we have found,<br />
haven't we, in various parts of the world, a new, insurgent<br />
nationalism w; hich has secured independence, which has, not infrequently<br />
produced dictatorships, which has, in itso1f, the<br />
spirit of aggression. With all the work done by the United<br />
Nations I would very greatly doubt whether there has been any<br />
period of ten years in my lifetime in which there has been a<br />
more insistent demand for independent, separate nationalism on<br />
the part of the people of a score of countries in the world.<br />
There it is; that's one of the facts of life and we must face it. </p>
<p>Well, how do we go about facing these things? One of<br />
the ideas, most prevalent has been that you must follow all<br />
these movements; wherver there is a movement for independent<br />
nationalism you present the people of that country 4ith independence,<br />
and we've done it. Nobody can doubt that whatever may<br />
be said about colonialism in this world, the history of British<br />
colonialism in this century has been one of glory and intelligence,<br />
because the whole process has been to say to people:<br />
" Very well, you have your freedom; you govern yourselves".<br />
But there again, ro can easily go wrong. * o are not to assume<br />
either that people are all equally competent to govern themselves<br />
or that our system of Government is the right one for them.<br />
Now I will say nothing about the first because it is<br />
self-evident. But I want to talk to you a little, this afternoon,<br />
about whether we ought to be so smugly satisfied that our<br />
system of Government is the right one for Indonesia, or Malaya,<br />
or Singapore or India, or Pakistan, or Ceylon, or Ghana, or<br />
Nigeria, or the Vest Indies. Are we so right? Are we wise to<br />
push down the throats of other people our ideas of how a country<br />
ought to govern itself, just because they are our ideas? I don't<br />
think we are. I think nothing could be more foolish. I think<br />
we ought to pay a little more regard to other peoples' history<br />
and hackground and religion and culture and leave it to them to<br />
, rork out a system of Government which suits them, because it<br />
suits them and not just because it suits us.<br />
Do you ever think about our system of Government? I<br />
know that I've been in the middle of our system of Goverrmpnt<br />
now, believe it or not, man and boy, for 30 years, and I know ail<br />
the noises that our system of Govcrnment makes and I know that<br />
there are people who take a broad view of Government and a broad<br />
view of national policy, and there are others who take a smaller<br />
view and say: " What will it cost me?" and one becomes accustomed<br />
to all this. But at the base of it I beg of you all to remember that<br />
I am a Prime Minister of Australia and there is a national<br />
parliament in Australia, and there is a parliament in each State<br />
c&amp; pital, and a Premier and Ministers, because hundreds of years<br />
ago our forefathers in Groat Br: train sat under the villne oak<br />
tree and lerned how to manage their own affairs, their own<br />
public affairs, their own local government. Step by stop, over<br />
centuries the position was achieved in which there was a Parliament<br />
elected freely by all the adult people in the country<br />
without r. gard to wealth or privilege. That didn't happen<br />
over night. It was only in the nineteenth century, that the<br />
Parliament at Jestminster, which had fought and won its battle<br />
with despotic monarchy over 200 years before, found itself by<br />
successive reform acts, voted for by a wider and wider constituency<br />
until adult men all had a vote by the end of the<br />
century. It was only in the lifetime of a great number of<br />
relatively young people that women had a vote in Groat Britain.<br />
This process of self-government, of parliamentary<br />
self-government of ours, has grown slowly and somctimes painfully<br />
over a period of contuies. We all have it in our bloo<. it="" is=""></.>
part of our history. It is something wo learned about from our<br />
father or our mother and that they in their turn learned about<br />
from those wtho went before them something that we've read,<br />
something that we've come to understand, something that we've<br />
felt. That is why I always maintain that in Australia we<br />
understand just as much about democratic, parliamentary selfgovernment<br />
as any other country in the world. Vc are in the<br />
forefront of that historic development. But it has taken<br />
centuries. Do you suppose that you can take a community of many<br />
millions of people, not bred in our tradition, not with that<br />
fusion that has gone on for so many centuries with us, between </p>
<p>4.<br />
the principles of Christianity and the principles of representative<br />
Government, bred in some strange creed, from our point of<br />
view, with notable cultures going back into their own history,<br />
but incapable of being understood by us, or by many of us, at<br />
any rate. You can't take a fully grown plant, like our parliamentary<br />
democracy, and put it down in an alien soil and expect<br />
it to flourish and grow and bear its fruit as if it had been<br />
there all its life. It is a very great mistake for . well-meaning<br />
people to insist that our system of governing ourselves must be<br />
right because it suits us it is right for us and then say:<br />
" Well all we have to do is to present this, fully grown, to some<br />
other community and say, ' Well, there you are boys, you all have<br />
a vote, you will all have a Parliament, now just go ahead and<br />
govern yourselves'". Life doesn't happen that way.<br />
And I am saying that to you because ory now and then<br />
you will read in the newspapers of some head of a neo Government.<br />
whether it's in Africa or in Asia, who has done something<br />
which, from our point of view, is quite dictatorial. And we<br />
say, " But that's a terrible thing to do; this is a dictator's<br />
action". Don't become too excited about that. There are<br />
quite a few so-called dictatorships in these new countries which<br />
will, in the course of years, mellow down until they develop<br />
their own form of popular Government, and when they do it will<br />
be their own form and they will understand it. Don't be too<br />
severe in judgrent about what goes on in Ghana, or what goes on<br />
in Karachi, or what goes on somewhere else. Don't be too<br />
severe about it. You don't expect other people to be able to<br />
adopt systems of Government which we understand instantly so<br />
that everybody knows them and everybody responds to them just as<br />
readily as those whose great, great, great, grand, grand-parents<br />
saw the developments of these things in British countries.<br />
And therefore don't let's force our views, and, above<br />
all, don't let's be intolerant about Ihat goes on in these<br />
countries. I'm not defending dictatorship. Dictatorship has<br />
brought horrors to the world. lle will never have one in<br />
Australia. But there may be countries which, in their early<br />
stages of development in independent Government may need to<br />
give much more power to their central rulers than wre world dream<br />
of doing, so that order may be established and grac' rl-administrative<br />
procedures can be worked out and put into operation.<br />
Now the only other thing that I want to say a word to<br />
you about is this: we think, and I think we are right, that we<br />
understand our system of Government, though there are some<br />
people who think that it is a system of Government by pressure<br />
groups, or by threats, or by something of that kind, but we<br />
know better than that. ' o know that by and large, over the<br />
years, we have been able to throw out Governments which have<br />
honestly tried to serve the interests of the community, And we<br />
understand that. But we are a little bit inclined to assume,<br />
aren't we, that our system of Government is just the same as<br />
the system of Government in other democratic countries.<br />
It has been my task and, of course, frorr time to time<br />
my pleasure, to attend dinners in the United States, in Groat<br />
Britain and in Australia in which glory has been attributed to<br />
the relations between the United States and ourselves, the<br />
United States and Great Britain, and in that genial mood, men<br />
at least get into after a good dinner, people eliminate all the<br />
difficulties, They talk about us being the same people, the<br />
same language. Almost, they pursuade themselves that we are of<br />
the same blood we are just completely identified people and<br />
then they wake up next day and find there is a frightful brawl<br />
going on between Washington and ihitehall, and they say: " I<br />
don't understand how that happened; how coulc it happen?".<br />
Silly enough thing to say, anyhow because my experience, when I<br />
was a lawyer was that the most bitter of all litigation was<br />
between members of families. But anyhow lot that pass. They<br />
assume that we are the same in our system of Government, </p>
<p>0<br />
0 </p>
<p>Some day I hope somebody, if I haven't got the time<br />
myself, will write something about the basic differences between<br />
Ameiican self-government and our own, and if it is written, then<br />
we will not quarrel with the United States from time to time. We<br />
will understand what these differences are, they u; ill understand<br />
what the differences are, and with an understanding of our<br />
differences we have a much firmer foundation than we have by<br />
talking rather vapidly about our unities and forgetting about<br />
our differences. I give you one example.<br />
In London, in Canberra, if we want to work out what<br />
our policy is in some great international matter, vie don't,<br />
contrary to what you may have thought, ask other people to talk<br />
about it. We go into the Cabinet Room and we talk about it<br />
ourselves, and we do a lot of reading and thinking about it,<br />
and finally we say: " Well that is uhat our policy is to be in<br />
relation to this matter", whether it's to be in relation to some<br />
near territory like New Guinea or South East Asia or the United<br />
States, Whatever it may be, when it emerges and is stated it is<br />
our policy. And there it is. And people in the rest of the<br />
world, reading it, being so advised by our Ambassadors and our<br />
Ministers, are able to say: " Well we know where Australia stands<br />
on this matter" which is very useful.<br />
But in the United States, policies are today, to a<br />
remarkable extent, thrashed out by Committees of Congress, not<br />
one member of which is a Minister, because, as some of you will<br />
know, Ministers, as we would call them, in the Cabinet, as we<br />
would call it, of the President of the United States, not only<br />
don't sit in Congress but they are not allowed to. They a-c<br />
completely separate from Parliament I'll give up calling it<br />
Congress for the sake of clarity and call it Parliament. So<br />
there's a Parliament, House of Representatives, Senate, at<br />
: ashington, not a Minister allowed to sit in it and Ministers<br />
are up somewhere else discussing their problems among th. eseve-<br />
On a few occasions the Minister may have had parliamentary experience<br />
but on most occasions he has never had any. He has<br />
been selected because of his capacity in his particular field,<br />
which is of course, to that extent, a great advantage. And the<br />
result is that Congress has established a series of committees.<br />
They have, for example, a Foreign Relations Committee of the<br />
Senate and a Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Pepresentatives<br />
and they occasionally sit together.<br />
If the Secretary of State, the late Foster Dulles or<br />
today, Mr. Hea-ter, the most important Minister in the United<br />
States, is engaged in international negotiations of some kind<br />
can be, and is, called before a committee of Congress, and crossexamined,<br />
perhaps all day, about how his mind is working, what h<br />
thinks may be the result of his thoughts. ' Tell it i. s very<br />
interesting. It is all done in the presence of the Press and<br />
frequently with Television. It is very interesting. But it<br />
seems to us to be an odd way of evolving a policy because here is<br />
the Minister " tho hasn't been able to work out what his policy is.<br />
to completion, and he is being asked to analyse his own mind in<br />
the presence of the public. And therefore, like any other man<br />
appearing before a committeeo, he will think aloud, He will say:<br />
" Well, of course, that's one way we might deal with it" and then<br />
later on he sayd: " That's another way we might deal with it" and<br />
these little bits and pieces come out to the world and get on to<br />
the cables and people in London and people in Melbourne and<br />
Canberra say: " What sort of a man is this? He doesn't seem to<br />
know his own mind".<br />
This was said about John Foster Dulles, you know. It<br />
was wickedly untrue. If ever I knew a man who knew his own<br />
mind, it was John Foster Dulles. But before a committee he might<br />
express ten minds in the course of ten hours of questioning, all<br />
in the process of making up, ultimately, his own mind, </p>
<p>6.<br />
You see I hope you follow what I'm moaning by this<br />
that means it is easy for us to misjudge what's going on in the<br />
United States. It is easy for us to got false ideas about<br />
American policy, or about American standards, terribly easy,<br />
disastrously easy, unless wo understand that their system of<br />
Government, and their system of policy-making, is completely unlike<br />
ours because we have a Cabinet Government, with Cabinet<br />
sitting in the Prliament. and directly responsible to Parliament<br />
on the floor of Parliament. These are two utterly different<br />
systems. I prefer ours, if I may say so. They prefer theirs.<br />
They are a very great country, with a great number of extraordinarily<br />
able men and women and they arc well entitled to<br />
prefer their system. All I amasking is that we shouldn't go<br />
blundering along assuming that our system of GovernAent is the<br />
same as the system in any other democracy.<br />
So that you see that there are two parts to this little<br />
lay sermon of mine: firstly, don't assume, when we talk about<br />
the democracies of the world that we all have the same machinery<br />
of democracy, because if you do, , we will fall into misunderstandings<br />
every few months. Secondly, don't let us fall into<br />
the error of thinking that we can say to millions and millions of<br />
people who have emerged, or are emerging, from an entirely different<br />
state of life, that our system of government is necessarily<br />
the best for them.<br />
All these things, all these international problems,<br />
call for a degree of tolerance, a degree of intelligent understanding,<br />
ahich, so far, we haven't achieved nnd it is because I<br />
kno how important understanding and tolerance are in the world,<br />
that I am always delighted when I see that the head of some<br />
Government has talked to the heads of other Governments.<br />
I know there are people in Australia who are inclined<br />
to regard these personal contacts as a jaunt or a dcscrtion of<br />
duty. On the contrary, they are the performance of the highest<br />
form of duty. It will be a sad day for Australia rhen the heed<br />
of the Government of this country cannot go and be a knom and<br />
recognised friend and intimate of the leaders of the major Governments<br />
of the world a very sad day.<br />
And now that the President has come anay from the<br />
' hitohouse, and has been travelling in London, in Bonn, in Paris,<br />
I am delighted. And perhaps the way to sum it up is to say that<br />
I am most of all delighted because I think it is rather sad that<br />
in a world of human beings contacts between the most prominent<br />
human beings should be regarded as the exception rather tian the<br />
rule. I would like them to happen every few, weeks, without<br />
brass bands, or trumpets, or television sets or all the other<br />
impedimenta of publicity. I would like them to happen just as<br />
matter of normality so that we Till all know each other better<br />
and bettor, Lnd particularly these great men in the world, kao<br />
each other better and better and better, because and hee . Ls<br />
the great and closing comfort the more the ordinary people anA.<br />
the extraordinary people of the world know each other and arfriendly<br />
with each other, the less dense will be the cloud o,<br />
possible war, the greater will be the chances of a-" nvrirpeace.<br />
