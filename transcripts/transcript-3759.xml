, S ,~ 4SoEMBARGO: 5 P. M. SUNDAY<br />
QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO. 11<br />
REDISTRIBUTION I JUNE 1975<br />
THIS WEEK WE HAVE SEEN A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THE<br />
COUNTRY PARTY'S CONTEMPT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM<br />
AND THEIR ABILITY TO STAND OVER THEIR COALITION<br />
PARTNERS, THE LIBERALS. Two WEEKS AGO, WE INTRODUCED<br />
IN' THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT PROPOSALS TO ALTER THE<br />
BOUNDARIES OF FEDERAL ELECTORATES. THESE<br />
REDISTRIBUTIONS ARE NECESSARY FROM TIME TO TIME<br />
BECAUSE OF INEVITABLE CHANGiES IN THE PATTERN OF<br />
' POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT. EXCEPT FOR SOME<br />
CHANGES IN W! ESTERN AUSTRALIA, THERE HASN'T BEEN A<br />
REDISTRIBUTION IN THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT SINCE<br />
1968, THE LAST THREE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
ELECTIONS WERE ALL HELD ON BOUN~ DARIES DETERMINED<br />
SEVEN YEARS AGO. YET GREAT POPULATION MOVEMENTS<br />
HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THEN. ANOTHER REDISTRIBUTION<br />
IS OVERDUE AND URGENT. IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO PUT<br />
IT OFF ANY LONGER, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
W'HEN WE FIRST BROUGHT THE REDISTRIBUTION<br />
PPOPCSALS BEFORE PARLIAMENT TWO WEEKS AGO, THE<br />
OPPOSITION IN THE SENIATE, UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE<br />
COUNTRY PARTY, REJECTED THEM; THEY REJECTED THEM<br />
IN EVERY ONE OF THE FIVE STATES CONCERNED. THEY<br />
DIDN'fT ARGUE THEIR MERITS; THEY JUST BLINDLY<br />
TURNED THEM DOWN. THEY EVEN REJECTED THEM IN THOSE<br />
STATES SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA WHERE THE<br />
COUNTRY PARTY HAS NO MEMBERS AT ALL IN THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES.. THERE WAS NO POINT IN OUR GETTING<br />
THE PROPOSALS REDRAWN, BECAUSE THE COUNTRY PARTY<br />
HAD MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WOULD OPPOSE ANY<br />
REDISTRIBUTION AT ALL. THAT WAS THEIR ATTITUDE.<br />
SO WE DECIDED TO BRING THE PROPOSALS FORWARD AGAIN<br />
IN THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL FORM OF LEGISLATION IN<br />
THIS WAY, SHOULD THE SENATE PERSIST IN ITS OBSTRUCTION.-<br />
WE CAN ADD THESE PROPOSALS TO THE GROWING LIST OF<br />
MEASURES WHICH THE SENATE HAS BLOCKED AND PUT THEM<br />
BEFORE THE PEOPLE AT THE NEXT ELECTION. THE PEOPLE<br />
THEMSELVES WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PASS JUDGMENT<br />
ON THE NEW BOUNDARIES, WHATEVER THE SENATE MAY DO. 11/ 7 </p>
<p>OF COURSE IT'S N-ATURAL. FOR POLITICANS-TO BE<br />
WIARY OF CHANGES IN FLECTORAL EOUNDA-RIES THEY GO<br />
TO0 THE IliART OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, BuT LET's<br />
BE CLEAR ABOUT TIS: THIS IS NOTl OUR REDISTRBUTI ON,<br />
TIHESE ' HT LABOR PARTY PROPOSAL. S. THEY Iv. IFRI<br />
DRAW ! N UP BY INDEPENDENT AND EXPERT COMN1ISSION 1: 1) S WJHOSE<br />
INTEGRITY AND EXPERIENCE ARE BEYOND QUESTION.<br />
THE R: YSULTS ARE SCRUPULOUSLY FAIR AND NO ONE<br />
HAS SUGGESTED OTHER'W'ISE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE<br />
MY WORD FOR IT, FlR MALCOLM rIACKERRAS, AN ACKNOWLEDGED<br />
ELECTORAL ANALYSTI SAID THIS OF THE COMMilISSIONER S<br />
PROPOSALS: " IN OVERALL POLITICAL TERMS, THE 1975<br />
REDIS'TiRIBUTION IS THE FAIREST sET OF PROPOSED<br />
BOUND4ARIES EVER TO BE PRESENED TO ANY AUSTRALIN<br />
PARLAINIEN1 IN MY LIFETIM. T* i-HE COMM ISSI ONERS IAVE<br />
BEH1iT OVER BACKWARDS TO AVOID ANY SUGGESTION OF<br />
GERRYMANDERING. THEY HAVE SET OIT TO DRAW<br />
BOUDArI: ES SO PATENTLY FAIR THAT REJECTION BY T HE<br />
SENATLE 10, OULD REFLECT DISCREDIT ON THE SENATEI N'OT<br />
ON THE COM ISSIONERS." / 11 </p>
<p>-ITrwvr's<br />
WHAT ONE EXPERT HAD TO SAY, SO VIP<br />
MAY WELL A,' 3K\ WHY THE OPPOSITION IS REJECTING THiE<br />
NLEWV BOUNJDARI ES OUT OF HAND. IT I S NOT AS THOUGH r [ j<br />
LJDj-: NAL PARTY IS LIKELY TO SUFFER UNDULY. IN sA<br />
R[ rSPErCTS THEIR POSITION WILL ' BE STRENGTHENED AND THE<br />
LAB-OR V'-APTY POSITION WILL BE W'EAI( LNED THAT WILL<br />
CEIRTAINLY BE THE CASE IN QUEENSLAND. SO WHY THE FUSS,<br />
WHY THE BLIND OBSTRUCTION? WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK<br />
VERY FAR FOR THE ANSW'ER, THE COUNTl-lRY PARTY THE<br />
N~ ATIOINAL COUNTRY PARTY AS THEY NOW CALL THEMSELVESWANT<br />
TO PRE-SERVE THE-PRIVIL. EGEUD POSITION THEY HOLD<br />
BEiCAUSET-OF HUGE VARIATIONS BETWN TE IE F IY N<br />
RURAL SEATS, THEY WIANT TO KEEP THE SYSTEM RIGGED<br />
IN THEIR FAVOUR.<br />
I OUGHT TO ' EXPLAIN THAT U" NTIL LAST YEAR, THIE<br />
LAW A'LLOWED TllE ELECTORAL COMMI 35S1O NERS, WHEN<br />
DRW~ IGUP tlEtt r-0UNDA'RIES, TO WAESOME SEATS VERY<br />
MUCH LA42" GFR THAN OTHERS, THE NEROF VOTrERS IN ANY<br />
ONE SEAT COUL-D 2nU2A0B% OV E OR DELOW THE AVERAGE<br />
NIJMPE) R OF VOTERS IN ALL THE SEATS OF THE STATE CONCERINED.<br />
THAT TOLERANCE, TOGETHER WITH NATURAL MOVEMENTS OF<br />
PO PU0LAT 10N1. HAS MEANT THAT IH NOST STATES THERFE ARE NOW<br />
SfEATS V I TH UP To 70. NORE \' IL: RS THANITES<br />
U E N SLA'IlD rHE LA" RGEST SEAT HAS NORE THAN TWvICE AS MANY<br />
V'OTERS TAil THE SMALLEST. IN OTHER WORDS, SGOME PEOPLE'Is<br />
VOT'ES'' AIRE WORTH MIORE THAN'-TWICE AS fMUCjH AS, OTHER PE-oP!. E'S,<br />
SO W-' E BROUGHT IN LEGISLATION To REDUCE THE P ERM ITT ED<br />
VAI" IATION FRoli 20Z TO THERE'LL STILL BE A<br />
DI F2ER'NCE; AN" D IT WI LL GROW A POPULAT IONS CHAjNG; 7E<br />
BUT A 10" M-1ARC IN WVOULD 13 E A MUCH FAIRER START ING P0 [ NT<br />
11I1JCH CLOSER TO THE IALOF' LU-A! . TY, </p>
<p>OUR LEGISLATION FOR THAT 10% DIFFERENCE WAS FOUGHT<br />
TOOTHi AND NAIL BY THE COUNTRY PARTY;<br />
IT WAS ONE OF THE BILLS THAT FORMED THE BASIS OF<br />
THE DOUBLE DISSOLUTION GRANTED LAST YEAR; IT WAS<br />
SPECIFICALLY PUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE AT THE ELECTION<br />
LAST MAY. THE PEOPI. E ENDORSED I-F THE PRINCIPLE<br />
OF EQUAL REPRESENTATION, THE BILL WAS PASSED BY<br />
THE PARLIAMENT AT ITS JOINT SITTING IN AUGUST,<br />
THE NEW MARGIN OF 10o IS NOW THE LAW OF THE LAND.<br />
BY REJECTING THE NEW REDISTRIBUTION, BASED ON THAT<br />
LAW, THE COUNTRY PARTY IS REJECTING A PRINCIPLE<br />
SPECIFICALLY APPROVED BY THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.<br />
PUT SIMPLY, WE BELIEVE IN THE SIMPLE, ANCIENT<br />
RULE OF ONE VOTE ONE VALUE, OUR LEGISLATION, AND<br />
THE REDISTRIBUTION BASED UPON IT, A REDISTRIBUTION<br />
DRAWN UP BY INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONERS, BROUGHT US CLOSER<br />
TO THAT IDEAL. THERE'S NO MYSTERY ABOUT IT, W. E THINK<br />
EVERYONE'S VOTE SHOULD BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THE<br />
SAME AS EVERY OTHER PERSON'S. ALL THE PHONY ARGUMENTS<br />
IN THE WORLD CAN'T EVADE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY<br />
MAN S VOTE, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, SHOULD BE OF EQUAL VALUE-,<br />
IN QUEENSLAND, UNDER THE EXISTING DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL<br />
SEATS, THE SIZE OF ELECTORATES DOESN'T JUST FLAUNT THE<br />
NEW LIMIT OF 10%; FOUR OF THE ELECTORATES ARE WELL<br />
OVER THE OLD LIMIT OF 20%. THE ENROLMENT OF THE<br />
LARGEST AND SMALLEST ELECTORATES VARIES BY 43,000 VOTERS.<br />
IT IS THE LARGEST VARIATION OF ANY STATE IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
TiIS IS A DENIAL OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF DEMOCRACY, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
YOU CONSTANTLY HEAR THE ARGUMENT FROM COUN'TRY<br />
PARTY POLITICIANS THAT COUNTRY SEATS MUST HAVE<br />
FEWER VOTERS THAN CITY SEATS BECAUSE OF THE<br />
DIFFICULTIES OF REPRESENTING SPRAWLING RURAL<br />
ELECTORATES COVERING THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES.<br />
THis IS A SPECIOUS ARGUMENT. WE ALREADY ALLOW<br />
A DIFFERENCE OF 10%. EVEN IF WE ALLOWED A<br />
DIFFERENCE OF 50% OR 100%, RURAL SEATS WOULD<br />
STILL BE VAST IN AREA BY COMPARISON WITH CROWDED'<br />
CITY SEATS, SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE DISTRIBUTION<br />
OF POPULATION, THIS IS NOT, AND CAN NEVER BE, AN<br />
ARGUMENT FOR DENYING DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS TO THE<br />
MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS, THE BEST WAY TO LOOK AFTER<br />
THE NEEDS OF RURAL ELECTORATES 1S TO GIVE BETTER<br />
FACILITIES TO MEMBERS REPRESENTING REMOTE AREAS,<br />
TO 0! PROVE COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT IN THESE<br />
AREAS. NE WON ' T DO IT BY RIGGING THE ELECTORAL<br />
SYSTEM IN FAVOUR OF ONE PARTICULAR PARTY. , i A/ </p>
<p>-7-<br />
FOR YEARS IN QUEENSLAND YOU HAVE HAD<br />
ABUiNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE RESULTS OF COUNTRY PARTY<br />
GERRYMANDERING, FOR YEARS THEY REMAINED IN POWER<br />
WITH 20% OF THE POPULAR VOTE, THE ELECTORAL LAWS<br />
ARE RIGGED AS MUCH AGAINST THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
AS THEY ARE AGAINST LABOR. IN MARCH 1971 EIGHT<br />
LIBERAL MEMBERS CROSSED THE FLOOR OF THE<br />
QUEENSLAND PARLIAMENT TO VOTE WITH THE A, L. P.<br />
AGAINST ONE OF THE MOST DISGRACEFUL GERRYMANDERS<br />
EVER PROPOSED, THE COUNTRY PARTY ARE PAST MASTERS<br />
OF THIS DIRTY GAME. THEY SEE THEIR FUTURE THREATENED,<br />
THEIR SUPPORT WANING IN RURAL AREAS, AND THEY ARE<br />
DESPERATE TO MAINTAIN IT. THEY BLOCKED A FEDERAL<br />
REDISTRIBUTION IN 1962 FOR THE VERY SAME REASON.<br />
THEYI' SIMPLY WON'T PLAY BY THE RULES, I HOLD PO BRIEF<br />
WITH THE LIBERALS, BUT I SOMETIMES WISH THEY HAD THE<br />
GUTS TO RESIST THE PRESSURE OF THEIR COALITION PARTNERS.<br />
AT LEAST SIR CHARLES COURT IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
HAS SEEN THE FOLLY OF KNUCKLING UNDER TO COUNTRY<br />
PARTY BLACKMAIL. I'M AFRAID THAT IN THE NATIONAL<br />
PARLIAMENT THE COUNTRY PARTY TAIL STILL WAGS THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY DOG. THE REJECTION OF THESE PROPOSALS<br />
THIS OVERDUE AND EMINENTLY FAIR REDISTRIBUTION<br />
WILL BENEFIT NO ONE BUT THE COUNTRY PARTY. IT WILL<br />
BE AN UTTER REPUDIATION OF THE PEOPLE'S WILL EXPRESSED<br />
AT THE LAST ELECTION, A SETBACK TO EVERY PRINCIPLE<br />
OF DEMOCRACY AND TO AUSTRALIA'S REPUTATION AS A<br />
DFMOCRATIC NATION. 3It 1?<br />
