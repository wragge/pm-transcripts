Jj&gt; AUSTRAL IA t<br />
EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FINANCIAL REVIEW DINNER SYDNEY 21 AUGUST 1985<br />
This is the third year in which I have had the pleasure<br />
to address the Financial Review's Post-Budget dinner.<br />
The pleasure is twofold. First, of course, is the<br />
opportunity which it presents to renew acquaintances<br />
with so many friends.<br />
But just as important is the fact that on each occasion<br />
I have had the privilege to report steady progress in<br />
achieving the Government's policy aims, due in no small<br />
part to a consistently applied budgetary strategy to<br />
promote a more prosperous, fairer Australia.<br />
The Budget which Paul Keating presented last night on<br />
behalf of the Government continues in that proud<br />
tradition.<br />
Like our first two Budgets, it is a Budget for jobs and<br />
growth jobs for today and jobs for the long term.<br />
It is a Budget with a clear direction, consistent with<br />
our overall economic strategy.<br />
This is a Budget of reform in particular, but not<br />
exclusively, reform of our programs for young people so<br />
as to address the m~ ajor economic and social issue of our<br />
time youth unemployment and disillusionment.<br />
And the Budget achieves this result while fulfilling<br />
handsomely the stringent trilogy of fiscal commitments<br />
made in the last election campaign.<br />
Commitments which no other Government has ever had the<br />
confidence to make; commitments which the sceptics said<br />
could not be fulfilled. </p>
<p>2<br />
In pledging that we would not increase tax revenue, and<br />
would reduce spending and the deficit, in proportion to<br />
GDP, we set ourselves conditions which have only been<br />
met twice before in the past quarter century but we<br />
met them.<br />
In adding to these commitments the further undertaking<br />
to reduce the deficit in money terms for 1985-86, we set<br />
ourselves conditions which had not been met for sixteen<br />
years but we met them.<br />
It is worth recalling the rationale for that<br />
unprecedented set of commitments and the economic policy<br />
context in which they are set.<br />
Cast your mind back ot the early months on 1983.<br />
Australia had endured seven long years of Government<br />
based on confrontation and division which reaped a<br />
whirlwind of industrial dislocation and a debilitating<br />
wage-price spiral, culminating in a combination of<br />
double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment<br />
unprecedented in Australian history.<br />
Real unit labour costs rose sharply and drove the profit<br />
share, in the second half of 1982, down to a record low<br />
of less than 12 per cent.<br />
Over the 7 years before the Labor Government took<br />
office, non-farm GDP averaged growth of only 2.4 per<br />
cent per annum. Employment crept up at an average rate<br />
well below the growth in the labour force. As a result,<br />
unemployment rose inexorably. In early 1983, most<br />
commentators thought that there was little prospect of<br />
achieving sustained growth at a pace fast enough to stop<br />
the rise of unemployment, let alone to reduce the dole<br />
queues.<br />
We promised in 1983 to seek reconciliation and consensus<br />
to get Australians working together again.<br />
We set ourselves several inter-related goals to create<br />
half a million jobs in our first three years; to reduce<br />
unemployment and inflation simultaneously; permanently<br />
to improve our long-term growth performance by<br />
correcting structural weaknesses; and progressively to<br />
achieve a more just, more equitable society.<br />
Our approach and in particular the emphasis which we<br />
placed on the Prices and Incomes Accord was framed in<br />
recognition of the environment within which any<br />
Australian Government would have to work. </p>
<p>And I believe that Australians can be proud of the fact<br />
that, together, we have made so much progress towards<br />
achieving these goals.<br />
Australia has experienced one of the strongest<br />
recoveries of all the OECD countries already 10 per<br />
cent growth in two years.<br />
And we are looking to a further five per cent real<br />
non-farm growth in 1985-86 five per cent growth in<br />
Australia while the OECD is only expecting about 3 per<br />
cent for the world's major industrial countries.<br />
Over three years we will have achieved more real growth<br />
than our conservative predecessors achieved over their<br />
full seven years in office.<br />
The strong growth has been the key to the 410,000 new<br />
jobs that have been created in Australia since the<br />
National Economic Summit in April, 1983.<br />
We -have created 70,000 more jobs in 27 months since the<br />
Summit than our predecessors managed in 88 months. Our<br />
three year target of 500,000 is now comfortably within<br />
reach.<br />
And the unemployment rate, which has already fallen by 2<br />
percentage points, is expected to fall further this year<br />
to 7-1/ 2 or, at worst, 8 per cent.<br />
We recognise that, while fiscal pump priming was<br />
appropriate while economic activity in the private<br />
sector was weak, it is no longer necessary or<br />
appropriate for the public sector to shoulder so much<br />
responsibility.<br />
Consistent with our fiscal trilogy we have, in this<br />
Budget, reduced the share of Commonwealth outlays in GDP<br />
by a full percentage point. As the May measures amply<br />
demonstrate, this is the result of rigorous expenditure<br />
pruning and firm control over new programs.<br />
There has been no lower growth in nominal outlays this<br />
side of 1968-69. In this Budget we have reduced the<br />
growth of real outlays to 1.3 per cent, the lowest in 6<br />
years. </p>
<p>On this same occasion a year ago at the Financial<br />
Review Budget Dinner, last year in Melbourne, I<br />
foreshadowed changes in our procedures for formulating<br />
the annual budget, to allow more effective control of<br />
expenditure within Government priorities. I said then:<br />
" Following the experience of two Budgets, I am<br />
firmly of the view that we must review our<br />
traditional procedures of Budget formation with a<br />
view to utilisinig fully the opportunities for<br />
financing new and expanded programs while<br />
continuing substantially to reduce the Budget<br />
deficit.<br />
When Budget decisons are taken on the eve of or<br />
even after the commencement of a new financial<br />
year, a Government's options for securing major<br />
savings without disruption and waste are severely<br />
truncated. In future Budgets, we must seek to<br />
extend the lead times in preparation of the<br />
expenditure side of the Budget, and in implementing<br />
expenditure decisions, and to improve on the<br />
traditional practice which we have inherited."<br />
Following those comments a year ago, the Government<br />
brought forward the timetable for consideration of the<br />
1985-86 Budget, culminating in this year's May Statement<br />
and the results that were unveiled last night.<br />
With no increase in tax revenues as a proportion of GDP<br />
we have, in this Budget, reduced the deficit to $ 4.9<br />
billion a cut of $ 1.8 billion. If the Government's<br />
position on wages is accepted by the Arbitration<br />
Commission, the deficit could be $ 350 million higher.<br />
With the lower deficit, the gross bond sales to the<br />
private sector this year are expected to amount to only<br />
billion, compared to $ 7.6 billion last year. And<br />
that $ 5 billion includes $ 3 billion of refinancing of<br />
matur ing securities.<br />
In conjunction with the cutback in State Authorities'<br />
borrowing programs negotiated with the Premiers in May,<br />
this Budget will permit a sharp reduction in the public<br />
sector borrowing requirement in 1985-86.<br />
Such a reduction will help to reduce pressures on real<br />
interest rates from this source and help to bring<br />
monetary and fiscal policy into better balance.<br />
44 </p>
<p>This reduction will help to underpin domestic investment<br />
and credit-sensitive consumption expenditures, within<br />
the context of monetary policy firmly directed to<br />
supporting strong growth but not any resurgence of<br />
inflation. ( I said more about our firm monetary policy<br />
in a speech to the New South Wales Economic Society on<br />
July).<br />
Let me expand upon the strength of recovery in the last<br />
year, and the factors which will shape our growth<br />
prospects through this year and beyond.<br />
A pleasing feature of the economic outcome in 1984-85<br />
was the consistent growth in private sector activity<br />
achieved through the course of the year.<br />
Real private consumption expenditure grew at an annual<br />
rate of 5.5 per cent in the second half of 1984-5, up<br />
from 3.7 per cent in the first half. Business<br />
investment grew steadily at an annual rate of 4 per<br />
cent.<br />
Most pleasing of all was the huge private sector<br />
contribution to employment growth.<br />
Some 90 per cent of the growth in employment which<br />
occurred in the year to the March quarter ( the latest<br />
for which the disaggregated data are available) was<br />
private sector employment.<br />
1985-86 is forecast to be another buoyant year for the<br />
private sector, underpinned by solid growth in private<br />
consumption and faster growth in business investment.<br />
Partly reflecting the strength of sales, the official<br />
forecasts assume that business inventories do not make<br />
much contribution to growth in 1985-86. But stocks are<br />
now very low relative to sales, in historical terms, and<br />
there is a chance that we will do better than the<br />
forecasts on this point.<br />
A significant factor in the outlook for 1985-86 and<br />
beyond is the recent depreciation of the Australian<br />
dollar. we, as a community, have a real chance to make<br />
a decisive break with the consequences of past poor<br />
competitiveness. Our manufacturing industries now have a real chance<br />
substantially to increase their shares of domestic<br />
demand. </p>
<p>And our manufacturing, rural, mining and service<br />
industries now are well placed to do much better on<br />
export markets.<br />
I have suggested before that we could create 100,000 new<br />
jobs for Australians if we retain and utilise our newly<br />
strengthened competitiveness.<br />
But the same increases in the prices of imported goods<br />
which have already strengthened the competitiveness of<br />
domestic producers are raising consumer prices. If<br />
these increases flow right through to all our costs we<br />
will have lost our advantage.<br />
For this and related reasons, the Government will be<br />
arguing for discounting of the CPI for the price effects<br />
of depreciation at the next two national wage hearings.<br />
We will be meeting employers and unions before the next<br />
case to discuss the Government's approach. As the<br />
Treasurer ' indicated last night, we will be exploring<br />
with the ACTU, within the framework of the Accord, means<br />
by which any temporary loss in real income can be fully<br />
restored, over time, without damaging the economy.<br />
As a further indication of the scale of benefits which<br />
can be achieved if only the real depreciation can be<br />
preserved, the OECD has estimated that net exports could<br />
contribute 1.4 percentage points to growth in 1985-86.<br />
The Budget forecasts incorporate a slightly more<br />
conservative estimate of one and a quarter points.<br />
And while circumstances may vary, across industries,<br />
much of Australian manufacturing certainly has the<br />
capacity to respond to the business opportunities which<br />
are emerging.<br />
But whether those opportunities will be present in 1986-<br />
87 and beyond depends very much on how successful we are<br />
at containing inflationary pressures in the aftermath of<br />
depreciation. In addition to strengthening the foundations of economic<br />
growth, our third Budget, like its two predecessors, is<br />
a Budget of reform in an even wider sense.<br />
We have focused strongly on the major economic and<br />
social concern of our time the position of young<br />
people. </p>
<p>As I said in my address on Sunday night, we must nurture<br />
the talents of young Australians. Their enthusiasm,<br />
their brains, their vision can lift this country to the<br />
front line of the world's industrial powers.<br />
But so often when we have spoken to young people we have<br />
detected a sense of frustration and anger because a<br />
disturbing number feel that they have not been given a<br />
chance. In this Budget my Government has given effect to a<br />
co-ordinated strategy to give young people that chance.<br />
Especially young people from financially poor or<br />
otherwise disadvantaged backgrounds.<br />
A better trained and motivated workforce means a<br />
workforce which is more flexible and better able to<br />
respond to the challenges which lie ahead of us.<br />
With this in mind we have revitalised arrangements for<br />
youth income support and put in place an imaginative new<br />
approach to youth training programs an approach<br />
modelled closely on the recommendations of the Kirby<br />
Report, involving a mix of both on and off-the-job<br />
structured training and education.<br />
We will be devoting substantial additional budgetary<br />
resources to this task. Resources to provide an<br />
adequate level of income support; to provide 20,500<br />
additional tertiary places over the current triennium;<br />
to sponsor training places in the public sector: and to<br />
ensure the success of traineeships in the private<br />
sector.<br />
The consultations which we have had while formulating<br />
our proposals were both fruitful and encouraging. They<br />
show considerable goodwill to improve the prospects of<br />
our young people, especially those who for whatever<br />
reason leave school earlier than year 12. These people<br />
are frequently from financially poor backgrounds and<br />
frequently are condemned to prolonged unemployment, or<br />
locked in forever to low skill jobs.<br />
The major initial focus will be on training in the<br />
finance, retail and hospitality industries: industries<br />
well represented at this gathering. I ask, on behalf of<br />
the young, that all concerned with industry bear their<br />
social responsibilities in mind in applying the<br />
traineeships proposal to their organisations. </p>
<p>Froin the first days of this Government, we have worked<br />
to remove structural impediments to improvement of<br />
Australia's long-term growth performance, alongside<br />
macro-economic policies for recovery and reforms to<br />
promote equity. We have seen policies in these three<br />
areas as being mutually reinforcing. The youth<br />
policies, with their focus on education and training,<br />
are important both to long-term growth and to social<br />
justice.<br />
But the Budget makes provision for substantial reform in<br />
other areas as well: the increased deductions for<br />
research and development expenditure in Australia;<br />
expanded support for research and development within the<br />
motor vehicle plan; and restructuring of our<br />
international trade promotion and marketing efforts.<br />
There are substantial initiatives to reduce farm costs<br />
in ways that promote economic efficiency. These include<br />
the complete removal of the excise on fuel for eligible<br />
primary producers and the replacement of the tariff on<br />
grain harvesters by bounties on local production.<br />
In relation to social security, we have built upon the<br />
substantial real improvements in benefits provided in<br />
previous Budgets to provide more adequately for our most<br />
needy fellow Australians.<br />
In our first two budgets we introduced Medicare, the<br />
highly successful Community Employment Program, and the<br />
widely acclaimed first home owners' scheme.<br />
We renegotiated the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement<br />
and provided over 60 per cent more funding.<br />
We reordered welfare programs as necessary to target<br />
substantial real improvements in pensions and benefits<br />
for those most in need of assistance.<br />
This year, we have introduced a supplementary payment of<br />
per week for long term unemployment beneficiaries<br />
who rent privately, and we have further increased the<br />
additional benefits paid to certain low income families<br />
with children.<br />
As it is necessary for all of our social and economic<br />
objectives, this is above all a Budget to underwrite a<br />
third year of strong growth<br />
A third year of growth which further defies and, I<br />
trust, shall defeat the pessimism about growth that<br />
descended upon Australia in the mid-seventies. </p>
<p>9-<br />
A third year of growth for Australians to learn<br />
again the huge rewards for all Australians, to be<br />
won by community co-operation within a well-crafted<br />
strategy for national recovery and reconstruction.<br />
In his speech last night Paul Keating described this<br />
Budget as " Historic" and he was certainly entitled to<br />
do so.<br />
Specifically, he drew attention to the Budget's central<br />
achievement the honouring in full of the commitment I<br />
made on behalf of the Government at the last elections<br />
the trilogy of budgetary commitments.<br />
No previous Prime Minister and no previous Australian<br />
Government had ever given so clear and firm a commitment<br />
on budgetary policy.<br />
There were, as usual, the sceptics and the knockers.<br />
I even seem to remember some comments by a former<br />
Secretary to the Treasury who compared the feasibility<br />
of the trilogy to the likelihood of what he called " airborne<br />
pigs".<br />
Yet the requirements of the trilogy this historic<br />
commitment have been met; and more than met; and, as<br />
Mr Keating said last night, have been met by achieving a<br />
budgetary discipline unmatched in any budget for at<br />
least the last sixteen years.<br />
The fulfilment of the trilogy would of itself justify<br />
the description of the Budget as " Historic"<br />
But there is much more to it than that.<br />
I profoundly believe that if the Australian people and<br />
in particular, Australian business and Australian trade<br />
unions respond to the opportunities this budget<br />
offers, then the 1985-86 budget can be a watershed in<br />
our history.<br />
And I say that for this reason:<br />
For too long, the budget-making process in<br />
Australia lacked consistency, purpose, and<br />
direction. Until 1983, Budget after Budget failed<br />
to provide any coherent framework within which<br />
business could plan or in which the trade union<br />
movement could fulfil its responsibilities or in<br />
which the Australian community as a whole could see<br />
with confidence the future directions of Australian<br />
economic and social policy. </p>
<p>10<br />
This Budget, even more than its two immediate<br />
predecessors, and certainly in a way never attempted in<br />
the Budgets of the sixties and seventies, does establish<br />
that framework a framework of confidence and<br />
consistency, of direction and purpose that will serve<br />
and strengthen the Australian economy and the Australian<br />
society not merely this financial year, but for many<br />
years to come.<br />
And let me conclude in this way. I mentioned before the<br />
scepticism from certain quarters about the feasibility<br />
of our Government's commitment to the trilogy.<br />
But the economic debate in Australia since the mid<br />
seventies has been marked by a wider scepticism.<br />
For example, scepticism about the workability of a<br />
policy designed to attack unemployment and inflation<br />
simultaneously... scepticism about the achievement of a<br />
workable Prices and Incomes Accord about the capacity<br />
of the trade union movement to exercise restraint and<br />
responsibility.., about the ability of a Labor<br />
Government to achieve co-operation from the business<br />
community and scepticism about Australia's capacity<br />
to achieve sustained economic growth without its<br />
benefits being aborted by a new bout of high inflation.<br />
Yet all these things have in fact been achieved.<br />
But underlying much of that scepticism was not just<br />
doubt about the ability of the Government the Labor<br />
Government to achieve these results.<br />
In a deeper sense, the scepticism expressed a kind of<br />
doubt about Australia's own capacity, as a community, as<br />
a society, as a nation, as a people.<br />
I would be very unwilling that this Budget, this<br />
document, should be made to bear more than it properly<br />
can. But may I say at least this much: this Budget, I<br />
believe, does give us the opportunity an opportunity<br />
given by the combined efforts of Government and people<br />
to break the chain of scepticism about our capacity<br />
not just of this or any other Australian Government but<br />
of the Australian nation to succeed, to grow, to<br />
maintain Australia's historic commitment to a fairer and<br />
better society and to succeed in a way and to an<br />
extent unexcelled by any nation on earth. </p>
