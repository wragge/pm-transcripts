<p>All promotions of odds by gambling companies and commentators will be banned during the broadcast of live sports matches, under new rules.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has demanded that Australia's broadcasters amend their broadcasting codes in the following ways to ensure a reduction in the promotion and advertising of gambling during sport:</p>
<p> * 	All promotion of betting odds on broadcast media will be prohibited during live sports matches. This includes by gambling companies and commentators.</p>
<p> * 	All generic gambling broadcast advertisements will be banned during play. Advertisements of this sort would only be allowed before or after a game; or during a scheduled break in play, such as quarter-time and half-time.</p>
<p> * 	Banner adverts, sponsorship logos, and other broadcast promotions must not appear during play.</p>
<p> * 	When crossed to, representatives of gambling companies must not be at or around the venue. They also must not appear with the commentary team at any time and must be clearly identified as a gambling representative.</p>
<p> * 	The Government will monitor the intensity of generic gambling advertisements within the allowed periods. If it is found to go beyond reasonable levels, the Government will impose a total advertising ban.</p>
<p>The public have had enough of odds and betting promotions being shoved down their throats while listening to and watching sport.</p>
<p>Younger Australians, in particular, should continue to talk about which is the best football team, best netball team, or best rugby team, not which team is at the shortest odds to win a game.</p>
<p>These measures ensure that the watching of sport and the promotion of gambling is kept separate.</p>
<p>The Government expects that the broadcasting industry will submit a revised code to the Australian Communications and Media Authority that reflects this position as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Government expects the ACMA to consider these revised codes promptly.</p>
<p>Should the industry elect not to do this, the Government will fast-track legislation to enshrine these standards in this term of Parliament.</p>
