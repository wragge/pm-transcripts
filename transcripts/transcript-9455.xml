PRIME MINISTER 113/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
WOODCHIP EXPORTS<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Government is to implement a firm<br />
program under which Australia's native forests will be properly protected and<br />
preserved. Under the program, the amount of woodchips exported from native forests not<br />
covered by Regional Forest Agreements will be reduced by about 20 per cent<br />
per year to nil in the Year 2000.<br />
The decisions I am announcing today are calculated to meet our obligations<br />
to the environment and at the same time, protect the interests of communities<br />
which presently depend on forest industries.<br />
For 1996, the maximum permissible level for export will be 5 million tonnes,<br />
about one million tonnes less than 1995. In 1997, the figure will be around 4<br />
million tonnes and declining, except where the conditions outlined in this<br />
statement are met in respect of Regional Forest Agreements and domestic<br />
downstream processing.<br />
By the year 2000 the Government will ban the export of woodchips from those<br />
areas of Australia's native forests which are not covered by Regional Forest<br />
Agreements incorporating a reserve system that comprehensively represents<br />
all forest types.<br />
The decisions taken by the Minister for Resources in relation to the 1995<br />
woodchip licences are legally binding and irrevocable. But the conditions<br />
in the licences which protect the environment those relating to the national<br />
estate and endangered species, for example will be rigorously enforced.<br />
Importantly, the Government is considering rescheduling existing logging<br />
operations in some situations to protect environmental values and broaden<br />
the options for future reservation of forests. </p>
<p>2<br />
The Tasmanian proposal referred to the Minister for Environment, Sport and<br />
Territories for environmental impact assessment for the export of up to<br />
700,000 tonnes is not included in, and will not be added to, the base figure<br />
for 1995<br />
Export woodchip licences in future will only be granted in relation to areas<br />
where there has been significant progress towards, or the completion of, both<br />
a Regional Forest Agreement ( RFA), as required under the National Forest<br />
Policy Statement ( NFPS), and the establishment of a comprehensive,<br />
adequate and representative reserve system. The Regional Forest<br />
Agreement will include appropriate environmental protection measures to<br />
ensure ecologically sustainable development. In these areas companies<br />
which increase their domestic downstream processing capacity, or have a<br />
demonstrable commitment to doing so, will have this taken into account when<br />
the Government is determining export licence quotas from 1996 2000.<br />
Under the current policy, the Commonwealth is required to be invited by a<br />
State or Territory Government to participate in an RFA. However, in the two<br />
years since the NFPS was finalised, no formal requests have been received<br />
by the Commonwealth and so no agreements have been reached.<br />
A strict timetable will now be developed for each Regional Forest Agreement.<br />
These agreements will be developed on the basis of scientific and technical<br />
assessments of the values of all forests, particularly old growth and<br />
wilderness. The Government is aware of the possible regional economic and social<br />
effects of these measures, and will consider helping industry make the<br />
transition to greater use and development of plantation and re-growth<br />
timbers. The woodchip export phase-out will not apply to plantations.<br />
These policies represent a significant step towards a sustainable forest<br />
products industry by the end of the century. That industry will operate within<br />
a framework of agreements which protect environmental values and at the<br />
same time maintains an active value-added wood products industry.<br />
The Government is to alter the process for considering the terms, conditions<br />
and size of woodchip exports. In future, the process for advising the Minister<br />
for Resources will be coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister<br />
and Cabinet. The Minister for Resources will formally consult me before<br />
making his decision.<br />
Reaching the Government's goal on woodchip exports will require an orderly<br />
transitional process. The Government recognises that all parties must be<br />
provided with incentives to work together. </p>
<p>3<br />
The Government will also consider measures to improve administrative<br />
arrangements available to the Commonwealth to undertake Regional Forest<br />
Agreements. Today's announcements move us significantly closer to a regime under which<br />
Australia's native forests will be. protected forever; and it should leave us in<br />
no doubt that with goodwill on all sides we will take the final steps by the year<br />
2000. CANBERRA 22 DECEMBER 1994 </p>
