THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM4 McF'AT[ ON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister of Australia<br />
IS ON CAMERA WITH<br />
ROBERT MOORE, ABC Executive Producer and Programme Anchorman<br />
ALLAN BARNES Canberra Correspondent of " The Age"<br />
RICHARD CARLETON Canberra Correspondent of " This Day Tonight"<br />
DAVID SOLOMON Political Correspondent of " The Canberra Times"<br />
ROBERT MOORE: The Right Honourable William Yc~ 4ahon, Prime minister<br />
of Australia. Mr. McMahon was elected Leader of the Liberal Party<br />
in March of this year. He's been a Member of Parliament since<br />
1949.<br />
Tonight, on MONDAY CONFERENCE, the PRIDTE MINISTER.<br />
Good evening. Next year, some time, there'll be a<br />
general election. M~ any people have an opinion about when it will<br />
be and what the result will be, but the man whose opinion really<br />
matters is of course the Prime Minister. fir. flci~ ahon will have the<br />
final say as to when the election will be held and it will be his<br />
judgement, more than anybody else's, which will be vindicated or<br />
not by the result. M4r. M cMahon has recently returned from<br />
discussinns on foreign affairs and related matters in the United<br />
States and Britain, and last week his Government survived a vote<br />
of no-confidence on its handling of the economy. Wlell those two<br />
subjects, foreign affairs and the economy, are very much bound up<br />
with the next election.<br />
To question the Prime Minister:<br />
Allan Barnes, Chief Political Correspondent of " The Age";<br />
Richard Carleton, Canberra Correspondent of " This Day Tonight"; and<br />
David Solomon, Political Correspondent of " The Canberra Times".<br />
Prime Ifinister, on Monday Conference at the end of October, Senator<br />
Gair said that the economy would bo the paramount issue at the next<br />
election. Last Week, as I've said, there was a no-confidence motion<br />
in your Government's handling of the economy, and in the last few<br />
days you've been subjected to a very strong attack in a number of<br />
newspaper editorials about the economy. In the light of this, do<br />
you see the next election being fought on the economy? </p>
<p>PRIPE MINISTER: No I don't. I think there are a number of issues on<br />
which we'll fight the elction. The basic one, I believe, will be<br />
defence and security. Then of course there will be the economy, there<br />
will be the problem of industrial law and oublic order. There'll<br />
be the problem relating to our immigration programme and many other<br />
problems of a similar kind.<br />
MOORE: Prime Minister, could I ask you this then? Are you<br />
suggesting that one reason why the election won't be fought on the<br />
state of the economy is that you will delay an election until the<br />
economy is in a much healthier state?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'm not going to give you any help at all as<br />
to when the election will be held, but I can assure you your gess<br />
isn't right.<br />
MOORE: Could it be in March?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It could be later than March. I haven't made up my<br />
mind, so that it's not much use you probing me as to date. You<br />
won't get any help.<br />
ALLAN BARNES: Prime Ministerr M1r. Snedden on this programme some...<br />
a couple of months ago, said that he thought the economy would not<br />
be an issue against the Government if the election was held at its<br />
normal time, the end of the year, implying that he thought the Budget<br />
strategy would work through and the economy would settle down. You<br />
seem to be taking a similar line. Would that be appropriate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not taking any line about the date of the election,<br />
and I told Mr. Moore that and I'm not going to help you either.<br />
RICHARD CARLETON: Prime Minister, what sorry.<br />
PRIME IMlINISTER: The simple look, I wonder if I could finish,<br />
because if I am asked a question I think there's a responsibility<br />
to let me answer the question in full, rather than get interrupted<br />
half way round. So if I want to answer your question completely I<br />
agree with what Mr. Snedden said about the date of the election if<br />
it were held late the economic issue would not be a real one. But<br />
after all I feel confident about the way the economy is going now,<br />
and the way in which we were able to virtually annihilate the<br />
Opposition on Wednesday, as you well know, was a clear indication<br />
that we're handling the economy pretty well by world standards too,<br />
and I think we'll go on handling it exactly the same way between now<br />
and the time we hold an election, no matter when it might be.<br />
BARNES: The day after you annihilated the Opposition in that censure<br />
motionhowever, you did take measures to correct the unemployment<br />
situation in the country. Does this indicate there may be more<br />
measures in the pipeline?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we took those the decision had been taken<br />
beforehand but I couldn't I felt first of all it was inappropriate<br />
to mention the measures during a no-confidence motion, and secondly<br />
I had to let some of the States or virtually all of the State<br />
Premiers know first. / 3 </p>
<p>So that was the reason why I didn'tmentionit then but I've made<br />
clear over and over again that if we find there is some difficulty<br />
emerging then we will take action to either prevent it or to<br />
introduce remedial measures. WAe won't hesitate. Tie did it in the<br />
case of nursing home attention, we did it in the case of rural<br />
unemployment, and we'll do it whenever else we think that a need<br />
has arisen which we feel demands or requires action.<br />
BARNES: The question of unemployment is however one of the primary<br />
ones worrying you at the moment, surely?<br />
PRI'VE MINISTER: Yes, it is. It is one of the primary ones. But I<br />
don't want you to forget for one moment that the dominant one is<br />
inflationery p~ ressures, due fundamentally to the wage-cost squeeze.<br />
So they are two, but they are virtually the same because unless we<br />
solve the inflation pressure then in the long term we create great<br />
troubles for ourselves in unemployment.<br />
HOORE. Prime Minister, could I sorry interrupt just for<br />
a moment. In the short run, on this very point, does the Government's<br />
attack on inflation depend on the-P being less than full employment?<br />
In the short run.<br />
PRIME MIINISTER: Not necessarily, no. our policy is one of combating<br />
inflation, at the same time getting a fairly good growth rate and<br />
I hope you'll ask me questions about this later and at the same<br />
time keeping unemployment to a minimum. Those are our goals and I<br />
think we've got reasonably good prospects of keeping them.<br />
BARNES: How would you define a minimum, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I wonder if I could get a little bit of coherence<br />
rather than everyone coming in and stopping mo from giving a complete<br />
answer. That's what I want to do, because there are a lot of vie:: wers<br />
and they're entitled to get the full answer, so please, which one is<br />
the next one?<br />
CARLETON: Mr. McMahon, let me ask you what are the factors that are<br />
going to weigh in your mind in deciding in favour of an early<br />
election or putting the election of f until the say the end of<br />
next year?<br />
PRIME I-INISTER: I've answered that already Mir. Carleton.<br />
CARLETON: You haven't mentioned the factors.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes I've would I give away whatever advantages I<br />
had of surprise? Would I commit myself at this early stage? Of<br />
course I wouldn't, and I won't do so.<br />
CARLETON: Well, I think it's fair to ask you Sir<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I don't think it is; well it might be fair, but<br />
it's not reasonable. When I feel that an election should be held<br />
and is in the interests of this country then I'll make my mind up,<br />
but at the present time I haven't made up my mind and consequently<br />
I feel that this is not an occasion when I could give you a finite<br />
answer to the question you've put to me. </p>
<p>CARLETON: Well what's the attitude of the Country Party towards an<br />
early election?<br />
PRIPM MINISTER-. They haven't discussed it with me.<br />
DAVID SOLOMON: Prime Minister, on the question of the economy, could<br />
you give us an indication of how high you expect unemployment to<br />
go in the next few months, when school leavers will be a real<br />
problem.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I couldn't give an answer to that question, but<br />
what I can say is the numbers today are just a little above the<br />
-year average. But we have certain problems we have to deal<br />
with and the main one is that over the next few months, in fact<br />
from the last two weeks in November right through to January, we<br />
have 190 thousand school leavers, and people who've passed their<br />
tertiary education 190 thousand; and under the economic conditions<br />
in which we live, particularly the matter of overseas... problems<br />
of overseas parities in the international exchanges, the difficulties<br />
associated with the rural economy, industrial indiscipline, we have<br />
a set of circumstances that we've not previously had to face, so<br />
anyone wanting to make up his mind and give precise figures is, I<br />
think, looking into the crystal ball and not being realistic.<br />
SOLOMON: Sir, some of the ecomomic conaitions are those of the<br />
Government's making, in terms of the last Budget the restriction<br />
on public service employment for example; the limitation on the<br />
amount of money that the Commonwealth was making available for works.<br />
Are you convinced that these are the right measures at this time.?<br />
PRIM-E MINISTER: I've said that I believe that whenever it is necessary<br />
for us to take any remedial or preventive action, we will do so<br />
so of course to deal with the first vart of your question, when I<br />
saw that Public Service recruitment was not as high as the approval<br />
we'd given for the whole of the Budget year, I asked that it be<br />
corrected and that we adopt a liberal policy about it. Similarly<br />
too, I took other action, so far -as it related to the rural unemployment.<br />
Just prior to that as you know, before I went away, went<br />
overseas, I had a look at the interest rate policy, and on bonds<br />
we reduced interest rates over the whole range.<br />
Those were but just some of the measures that we took and of course<br />
we look at other lines of action that we feel may be helpful and<br />
when we think~ a change is necessary, I can assure again I assure<br />
you we'll take the measures.<br />
MOORE: Prime Minister would you see the state of our primary industries<br />
as being the most permanent weakness in our economy at present?<br />
PRIME MI14ISTER: It depends which part of the primary industries you're<br />
talkingabout, and if you're looking at the problems of wool, I<br />
think that this is a long term problem that we have to handle and<br />
if I can make this one comment, a commendatory comment the fact<br />
that we've had a growth rate this year, or will1 have a growth rate<br />
of something like five por cent, despite the fact that the price of<br />
wool has fallen so dramatically and sharply, is I think, a tribute<br />
to the resilience of the Australian economy, and I believe the<br />
energy and the industry of the Australian people.<br />
MO0ORE: Does the Government have a long term strategy to get those<br />
farmers who must leave the land of f the land Are you working<br />
on it at that level: </p>
<p>PRIME MIINISTER: We had an immediatte and~ then a long term problem.<br />
The immediate Droblem was this, that because no-one could forecast<br />
what the price of wool would be at the opening or during the season,<br />
and because we had to keep up the income flow during this year, we<br />
had to take immediate steps; first of all to give as it were<br />
subsidy to the wool producer, and secondly to permit the Commis! õ ion<br />
to buy in wool if it was thought necessary to sustain the price.<br />
But evcn at t-he last Budget time we had a look at the long term<br />
prospects as, for example, taking people off the land, giving long<br />
term finance and farm reconstruction, and now we have appointed a<br />
committee under Sir Richard RAndall, the former permanent Head of<br />
the Treasury, who will be able to recruit a large proportion of<br />
his own staff, and will be assisted by senior representatives of<br />
other Government departments, and we hope he'll put up long term<br />
answers to us, or recommendations to us, by the end of March next<br />
year.<br />
M4OORE: Do you in fact see a lot of people leaving the wool industry<br />
in Australia<br />
PRIM4E 1M1INISTER: Yes, I do, I do; and in fact when we first looked at<br />
it at Budget time this year, we thought that there were at least<br />
between eleven thousand and fourteen thousand who should be withdrawn<br />
from the industry.<br />
CARLETON: Prime~ Minister, have you made an in-principle decision not<br />
to continue thei wool subsidy in next year's Budgct<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not an in-principlc decision, no, but we have said we<br />
will not again give open-end commitments, either to the deficiency<br />
paymonts, or and that is of coursel the subsidy nor will we give<br />
unlimited authority to the Commission to buy in wool. But everything<br />
will depend upon... first of all upon the facts as presented to us<br />
by the Randall Committee and our analysis of conditions as they<br />
exist at the time we have: to make the decision.<br />
SOLOM4ON: In last year's Budget, Sir, your Government gave a t~ irtv<br />
million dollar grant for special aid for woolgrowers which was<br />
going to be for one year only, and this year the budgeted amount<br />
for spocial assistance on a one-year scheme was sixty-million, and<br />
it looks as though that'll probably be 120 or 150 million. Could<br />
you give us soma indication of the -amount of money that the Government<br />
would be prepared to commit in future years 7<br />
PRIISE MINISTER: No, I couldn't give that. We haven't thought of it<br />
yet because, as I said to you, we've just a ppointed the Randall<br />
Committee, and I think it'd be wise for us to wait until the<br />
Randall Committee has submitted its roport before we make up our<br />
minds.<br />
BARNES: On the general economic question, Prime minister, your predecessor,<br />
MR Gorton, in speaking in the censure motion last week,<br />
suggested some form of variation of a wages and prices freeze.<br />
Does this appeal to you<br />
PRI14E MINISTER: Not very much, n, because I don't think it's practicablc<br />
in Australia. We have no constitutional power to control<br />
prices. Under thle arbitration pirt of the Constitution, that part<br />
of the law of the Constitution, it is the Arbitration Commission<br />
that has the power to d, terzmino official awards and consequently<br />
sets the pattern for wage rates throughout Australia. We haven't<br />
got that power. </p>
<p>BARNES: On ' the short.... I'm sorry Sir.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No in the long run. On any run. But in any event<br />
one of those parts of the recommendations of the group of ten who<br />
the ten economists who made some recommendations to us last week<br />
I think the one part that I would agree with was that in Australia<br />
an attempt to control wages, prices, is a pretty difficult proposition<br />
and is rather apt to lead to a misappropriation of resources<br />
and create bottlenecks rather than find real solutions.<br />
BARNES-, President Mixon applied this only for three months the<br />
Ninety Day Freeze. Couldn't you do the same thing by using your<br />
taxing powers without the necessity for a Constitutional<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I doubt it, I doubt it, but in any avent that would<br />
be a very long term measure to introduce taxing powers. Nixon<br />
fortunately had the power to do it, but I wonder even in his case,<br />
I wonder how long it'll be successful for, and in any event our<br />
problems arc nowhere near as serious as theirs.<br />
BARNES: The problem as I see I'm sorry, I just wanted to follow<br />
this the problem as I see it is that the Commonwealth will<br />
go before the Arbitration Commission and either recommend no<br />
increase whatsoever in the National Wage Case, or a mtinimium increase,<br />
and.., but you leave yourself open to thce criticism that you're not<br />
doing anything about profits or prices. Surely this shows up an<br />
inconsistency zand surely the Governmcnt needs to use some powers<br />
to balance the picture in the minds of the workers<br />
PRI17. MINISTER: Well on the facts, and the facts are important, let's<br />
establish them; I think you'll find that average earnings went up<br />
between thirteen and... well'about thirteen per cent in the corresponding<br />
period of last year, and that was mainly due to Arbitration<br />
awards, but... not ' awards, but agreements that were made outside the<br />
Commission, and that was the basic cause of our problem. But<br />
profits did not go up substantially at all. In fact they went up<br />
to a minimal extent and they have slightly increased in the<br />
corresponding pcr-iod of this year as compared with last year ; so<br />
we haven't got the problem of profits rising in a way that is<br />
completely unacceptable. But that doesn't touch the basic problem;<br />
the basic problem is how to be successful, and I doubt whether<br />
under Australian conditions we would be able to introduce a system<br />
of income controls, whether it was on wages or on profits. But<br />
there are two ways in which we c,-ngo about this. The first one<br />
relates to the Arbitration Commission. THere of course we were<br />
willing to intervene in the Metal Trades case, but an agreement was<br />
made outside the Commission and we were not able to put arguments.<br />
But we did intervene in the carpenters' case, we did in the annual<br />
leave case, and we did, as you know, also intervcne in the national<br />
wage case. Secondly, if we felt that we really wanted to take<br />
action so far as profits are concerned, we've got the taxation<br />
mechanism, and when we looked at profits we realised that wasn't<br />
an angle that needed immediate attention. So we can do something,<br />
but I don't think it is the answer to the problem. The real answer<br />
to the problem of inflation is trying to dampen down the conditions<br />
that arc favourable to inflation and that is create conditions when<br />
people can write into thcir prices any awards that might take place,<br />
or over-award payments, or the losses that can occur because of<br />
industrial indiscipline.<br />
MOORE: Prime Minister, do you read into Sir Richard Kirby's report on<br />
the Arbitration Commission a warning against the Government taking<br />
stronger action in industrial relations o./ 7o </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: No, bu ' t you put me in a very difficult position<br />
here because Sir Richard has written to the Government over the<br />
last few days protesting about the way in which his report had been<br />
presented to the public, so that on Tuesday either the Minister for<br />
Labour and National Service, or myself I hope the Minister for<br />
Labour and National Service would in one way or other have to read<br />
out the protest of Sir Richard. I think it's a pity, a great pity<br />
that he's been misrepresented in the way he has been.<br />
MOORE: Does the Government in fact intend to adopt a tougher industrial<br />
relations policy?<br />
PRIM1E MINISTER: Could I go back -first of all to Sir Richard because<br />
I think he is as I said he has been misrepresented. I've known<br />
Sir Richard for a long, long time. I was Minister for Labour and<br />
National Service for eight years and I knew him before then and I<br />
know he would never be critical of a Government for what it did in<br />
its legislation. He thinks of himself as there to administer that<br />
legislation and to have the arbitration in the legislative context<br />
and wouldn't present a view of the kind that he's been represented<br />
as presenting. Then the other part of your question<br />
MOORE: Well, does the Government intend to adopt a tougher industrial<br />
relations policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Again, it's been made plain that my colleague, the<br />
Minister for Labour and National Service, will be making a statement<br />
next week on the Government proposals relating to arbitration. It<br />
will be a comprehensive review of the whole of the Arbitration<br />
processes and procedures. We've been working on it now, I believe,<br />
for very nearly seven months, and we completed our final review of<br />
it on Thursday of this week. I don't want to, as it were, get into<br />
his jurisdiction. I think it's appropriate and proper that I leave<br />
him to explain his own case on Tuesday or Wednesday. But this I can<br />
say to you. It is a thorough-going review, it is one that will<br />
cover many aspects of arbitration, and we will not introduce a Bill<br />
on this occasion, but we will put down a paper that will open up the<br />
way for others to see what we propose, and so that they will be able<br />
to present their arguments, whether it's the the trade<br />
unions, whether it is the industrialists or the commercial interests,<br />
they'll be able to say well look we don't like this, we think a<br />
different sort of an approach should be made. So we hope for widespread<br />
debates, widespread discussion, but we do hope it'll be the<br />
beginning of a process that we can have another look and a better<br />
look at industrial law.<br />
MOORE: So there won't be legislation<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no, it'll only he a statement and the legislation<br />
will not be brought in, a Bill will not be brought in, until the<br />
next session.<br />
SOLOMON: Sir does Sir Richard's statement, in this letter, counter his<br />
own statement in his report that he thought that improvements in<br />
industrial relations are more likely to arise from changed attitudes<br />
from the employers and the trade unions, than mere Acts of<br />
Parliament? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Look there are several points on which he' made a<br />
complaint at least six, and probably more. I don't think that<br />
one is isolated by him, and I don't think it is referred to, but I<br />
couldn't be sure.<br />
SOLOMON: No, he put that as a very strong view in his report.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, well, I too believe that one of the remedies<br />
is better relationships between employer and employee. To that<br />
extent I do agree with him.<br />
M. IOORE: Can we turn to foreign affairs , I'm sorry can we move<br />
on to foreign affairs now for a while, and I we do have to begin<br />
with the conflict between India and Pakistan for the moment anyway.<br />
how serious do you see that conflict?<br />
PRIME MINISTER. Very serious, and very regrettable because I don't<br />
think either country can really afford to get involved in a war of<br />
this kind and of course there can be too great a loss of life that<br />
was avoidable. I did write, or make diplomatic representations to<br />
Yahya Xhan, President of Pakistan on at least four occasions; I<br />
spoke to Madame Gandhi's representatives, and I wrote to her too.<br />
I just feel it's something that we all hoped we could avoid,.<br />
particularly amongst two members of the Commonwealth; but they've<br />
declared war now, it's in the hands of the United Nations I believe,<br />
and my colleague, the M-inister for Foreign Affairs, has made a<br />
statement and again, this is within his jurisdiction and I don't<br />
want to add anything to it tonight.<br />
MOORE: Prime Minister, I'm sorry, could I<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, you can.<br />
MOORE:. Could I ask you, what did President Yahya Xhan say in his<br />
replies to your letter?,<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He didn't give one.<br />
MOORE: He didn't give you a reply?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
BARNES: There was a suggestion<br />
MOORE: Are you disappointed in that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, very disappointed. other countries have done<br />
exactly the same. Some have got a rather sharp response, an<br />
unfortunately sharp response. We hope that there can bo an agreed<br />
solution, but it is n extrenely difficult problem and the big<br />
nations, the more powerful nations, must all gct together to see<br />
if they can try and get an agreed solution between the two.<br />
MOORE: Do you see it possible for Australia to play significant<br />
and s, 3ecial role in this kind of conflict? / 9 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: No I don't. I think this is will be basically<br />
between India and Pakistan, and I only hope that thyl see the<br />
light and that they'll start to negotiate now. B3ut I don't see an<br />
immediate prospect of that happening. But I don't think the great<br />
powers either would be able to influence them to any great extent.<br />
BARNES. There were reports from New York when you wore there Sir,<br />
that you were contemp* la ting actually going to India and Pakistan on<br />
your way home from London, and then later it appeared that you'd<br />
either abandoned it or been dissuaded by your talks over there. Is<br />
that correct?<br />
PRI. ME ! INISTER: I didn't know of any reports whilst I -was in either<br />
Washington, New York or London. ' But before I left, some of the Press<br />
Gallery in Canberra suggested. to ma that I should go to Pakistan<br />
and to Ncw Delhi. I knew I could not go -to New Delhi because Mrs.<br />
Gandlhi would be in Washington at thc same time as I was there and if<br />
I went to Rawalpindi, if I went to Pakistan first and then didn't<br />
go to India, I think it could create greater troubles than * I wanted.<br />
And in any event I also decided whilst I was in ' Washington that I<br />
would write another letter to the Presidcnt of Pakistan. We did all<br />
we could, and other nations, particularly the United States and the<br />
United Kingdom, have done all they could, in order to minimise, even<br />
to avoid, a war breakirna out between the two countries. They feel<br />
the same as we do about it.<br />
BARNES: Prime Minister, could I move the discussion a little further<br />
south. The main area of dobate recently has been regarding the<br />
Indian Ocean, in Australia. How seriously do you view the presence<br />
of some Russian ships in the Indian Ocean, from Australia's Point of<br />
view?<br />
PRIIME M4INISTER: Not at the omont very seriously. The real problem<br />
arises from the fact and this hasn't been made clear before but<br />
the real problem arises from the fact that now, the Soviet has taken<br />
an interest in the Indian Oceapn. Until a few years ago she'd had<br />
no interest whatsoever. The second important fact is that at least<br />
at the mo-ment her naval forces are concentrated in the west and the<br />
north, mainly around the Suez Canal., R~ ed Sea and the Gulf area, and<br />
secondly, they are able to mobiliso and to add to their naval<br />
presence very quickly. It is this that is the cause of worry to us,<br />
and of course, none of us know what the future is likely to hold,<br />
particularly the relationship between the People's Republic of China<br />
and of the Soviet, so we must remain constantly aware of the~ ' thnqers,<br />
we must be ready to build up our own defence capabilities steadily<br />
build up our defence capability and try and ensure that our allies<br />
have the same approach to the problem of the Indian Ocean as we have.<br />
BARNES: Haven't the Americans in fact played it down in rather low<br />
key? I tL-hink in your report to Parliament you said that Mr. Laird,<br />
particularly in your talks with him, had indicated that America<br />
didn't see it as any sort of a threat whatsoever. There seems to be<br />
some conflict between the attitude taken in the Australian<br />
Parliament and by our major allies. 0/ 10 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't think you could put it in quite that language<br />
because in my talks with Mr. Laird ho recognised the difficulties in<br />
the ability to build up for the soviet to build up its naval<br />
pres ncn fairly rcrpi1?. But they havc problems, not only with the<br />
Administral-jon but the prubipmms they have with their Senate Foreign<br />
Relations Committee, so they're not prepared to be too outspoken<br />
about this probleyp, but they understand the Problem in exactly the<br />
same way as we do. They've indicated that they will use, if it's<br />
necessary, Learmonth and Cockburn, that's the naval base at Cockburn<br />
thtwe're building; they're establishing a signal station at Diego<br />
Garcia; they've indicated clearly that they will have voyages there,<br />
missions there by naval presence, and as you know only recently they<br />
had a carrier and a support crew, support ships, travelling around<br />
the Indian Ocean. They know the difficulties. But just as importantly<br />
the British know the difficulties that exist too, and whilst I was in<br />
London, Mr. Heath gave me the clear assurance that what he said in<br />
Singapore about Britain maintaining a presence in the Indian Ocean<br />
would be confirmed, and it was confirmed. They are interested in the<br />
Indian Ocean as a great trading area, as an area that is necessary<br />
for them to live by, and they'll keeD a presence there too.<br />
BARNES: Is it worthwhile us spending eight hundred million on a fleet<br />
of ships to patrol the Indian Ocean the light aircraft carriers, the<br />
light destroyers I'm talking of now.<br />
PRIMYE MINISTER: Up until the -moment I have no proposals before me from<br />
the defence machine as to the size of the presence they would like<br />
in the Indian Ocean. Until I get a submission from them I couldn't<br />
give you an answer to your question.<br />
MOORE: Prime rinister I'm sorry what has happened to the study<br />
group that was set up at the Commonwealth Conference in Singapore at<br />
the beginning of the year?<br />
PRIME -MINISTER: It's wasted away.<br />
M4ORFE: It's wasted? Well are you sorry about that, or glad to see it<br />
go?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I think it would have been a failure. When I was<br />
in Singapore I felt it would not succeed and it hasn't succeeded.<br />
We have said we were willing to participate if necessary, or to give<br />
whatever help was necessary, but we also believe that political<br />
problems would intrude and would superimpose themselves on the<br />
analysis, and it was only analysis that was to be attempted. I think<br />
each country itself has got to make up its mind what the problem is,<br />
and take whatever action it thinks is in its best interests.<br />
CARLETON: Prime Minister, can I take you up to Vietnam. The<br />
Government's position seems to be that -the position in Vietnam has<br />
improved to the degree that we can now withdraw all our troops. If<br />
the situation in Vietnam was to deteriorate next year, could our<br />
troops go back?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I stated in the House we have no intention of sending<br />
troops back to South Vietnam. I stand on that statement. 0../ 1 1 </p>
<p>11.<br />
CARLETON: No matter how much it deteriorates?<br />
PRI14E MINISTER: I would not commit myself.-on-a hypothetical question<br />
as to what might happen if thcere-were completely changed circumstances,<br />
-but-I-belie've, and I state this as a belief, that the probability, or<br />
the possibility, of sending any troops back is extremely remote.<br />
SOLOMON: Sir are you concerned that the Democratic Labor Party has not<br />
seen great merit in your statements on your return to Australia,<br />
regarding defence?<br />
PRIME, MINISTER: The Democratic Labor Party is also a political party,<br />
and of course it has to play the game politically, in the way it<br />
thinks suits its best interests. That doesn't moan to say that they've<br />
got necessarily grave doubts about our defence posture, and what we<br />
intend to do. What it does indicate is they'd like to see us doing<br />
much more because that is the kind of policy on which the Demoncratic<br />
Party must succeed.<br />
SOLOMON: Are you going to accede to their demands?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will riot ma-ke any forecasts about future policy.<br />
I respect the Democratic Labor Party but that doesn't necessarily<br />
mean that . because I'm asked a question at a conference, however<br />
ikLLgortant this one might be, when I'm askcd a question I immediately<br />
give an answer on what is a high level political and policy decision.<br />
BARNES: You were to the Defence Minister, Mr. Fairbairn, was to<br />
have made a statement to the House during this session he's now<br />
said it won't be made why have you postponed this if defence is so<br />
important to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I gave instructions that I wanted a White Paper<br />
prepared because we first of all had a strategic appreciation that<br />
gives the global picture of the dangers of warfare, whether of a<br />
general kind, a limited kind, or insurgency or subversion. It was<br />
pretty reassuring and said we couldn't expect global or even limited<br />
types of warfare during the next decade; but I pointed out at that<br />
time that I felt that we also needed, based upon that strategic<br />
review, something to do with the size, the structure, the disposition<br />
and role of the Australian military forces, and I asked that a White<br />
Paper be prepared for presentation to the House. The Dafence<br />
machine tell me they can't do it in time, that you can't make instant<br />
coffee decisions and we have to wait till somewheile about February.<br />
Regrettably I have to wait. I'm sorry about it, ut that's the<br />
answer.<br />
BARNES: I thought the idea of Mr. Fairbairn wanting to put down a<br />
statement, during this session, was to give these defence planners a<br />
bit of time to work out their priorities, instead of the usual<br />
scramble for money in a pre-Budget period, when everyone's in for,<br />
whatever, guns and boats. Aren't you defeating this by not giving<br />
them some quidance now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, it was my oai idea and I believe it's based upon<br />
normal Cabinet or Government practice. I wanted a document setting<br />
out the role, composition and size of -the forces, and therefore the<br />
way in which they should be equipped and manned. ./ 12 </p>
<p>12.<br />
But they told me Mr Fairbairn himself told me that they could<br />
not do it in-time.. That is the reason, there isn't any other one.<br />
MOORE: Prime M4inister, how close are we to recognising China?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can't tell you because it's in the hands of the<br />
Chinese.<br />
MOORE: Why do you say that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Because we opened up, or wanted to open up a dialogue<br />
with them. So far as we're concerned we permit our people to freely<br />
go to China and to come back. Subject to security requirements, any<br />
Chinese can conme to Australia. We trade with them freely, other than<br />
in strategic goods. We welcome cultural and scientific exchanges,<br />
and I did say, I think you know one of the first speeches I made as<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, largely as a result of my own<br />
initiatives, that we would want to open up a dialogue with China as<br />
soon as we could. And we thought, quite frankly, that we were on the<br />
way to some sort of success, but the Chinese act in their own<br />
inscrutable ways, and suddenly they cut off, ' without rhyme, without<br />
reason, and we don't know when they're likely to resume them again.<br />
MOORE: In your Departmcnt's discussions, does the Government of Taiwan<br />
still claim to be the Government of China, or has it recognised<br />
reality?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can't anssQ -that on bohalf of the Taiwan Government,<br />
but our attitude is a clear one. The de facto control of continental<br />
China resides in the Peking Government, that's the Pcople's Republic.<br />
De facto control and jurisdiction in T'aiwan resides in the hands of<br />
the Taiwanese Government. So consequently we don't recognise the<br />
claim that is made by Taiwan to jurisdiction over co-ntinental China.<br />
MOORE: Can we turn, just back to defence for a moment. What again<br />
what is the present status of the Jervis Bay nuclear powcr station?<br />
Is that<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's postponed for the time being. I haven't heard<br />
of it since the statement was made by my colleague, the Minister for<br />
National Development.<br />
MOORE: But in principle, do you see the n~ eed for Alistralia to be<br />
prepared to be able to make nuclear weapons if it needed to?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thatis a question I as you know I couldn't answer,<br />
because as you know, we have signed, or we have initialled I'm sorry,<br />
not signed, the document of the united Nations relating<br />
to nuclear weapons and while we haven't ratified it we've kept that<br />
in abeyance because other countries haven't ratified it either yet<br />
we are keeping well up with nuclear developments, particularly in the<br />
industrial world, and that of course would help us if ever in the<br />
future we had to make up our minds which way we wanted to go.<br />
MOORE: But you don't soce it as a matter or urgency?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't. / 13 </p>
<p>BARNES: Prime Minister, could I open up the area of politics,<br />
domestic politics? Mr. Killen, your ' former Minister, the former<br />
Minister for the Navy, gave notice I think a couple of months ago<br />
that he wanted a special meeting of the Parliamentary Liberal Party<br />
this session to decide the issue of an elected ministry or otherwise.<br />
Do you intend to held that meeting this week?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will hold it as soon as I can, probably this week.<br />
BARNES: What is your attitude towards an elected Ministry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'll reserve my statement about an elected Ministry<br />
until I have to discuss it in the Party room, and I will listen to<br />
what they have to say, but hitherto I've been Qpposed to an elected<br />
Ministry.<br />
BARNES: Are you concerned about Mr. Killen's approach to this as<br />
maybe damaging your position as Prime Minister, the traditional role<br />
of ai Liberal Prime Minister of being able to choose his own MinistersZ<br />
Does it concern you that this may be damaged by the adoption of an<br />
elected Ministry?<br />
PRIME M4INISTER: No I don't think that, but in any event, because I want<br />
to discuss it in my Party room first, I believe that's the place<br />
where my opinion must be expressed, and I think that it would be<br />
imprudent for me to openly discuss it before I lot my Party knew<br />
what I thought.<br />
SOLOMON: Sir are you concerned about criticism which Mr. K~ illen has<br />
been making of you and the way you've been handling yourself as<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will not discuss Any of my colleagues publicly. I've<br />
stated over and over again that I believe in fighting on issues and<br />
on policies, and relying* on : the public approval for what we do andthe<br />
way we comport ourselves, and I will not under any circumstances<br />
discuss Mr. Killen or his views, or for'that mattert any other of my<br />
colleagues and their views.<br />
SOLOMON: Do you think that things which people say within your Party<br />
can be of political damage to the Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think they can be of political damage. Yes of<br />
course they can be. But I think if you look at the recent Gallup<br />
ratings, includin~ g the one in " The Age", " Sydney Morning Herald",<br />
I think you can see that our rating's going up nicely and I think<br />
better than most people would have predicted, and in any event I<br />
believe that there's been too much exaggeration about the extent Of<br />
the difficulties within my Party, and particularly the state of my<br />
Party today. I don't think the public have been effectively presented<br />
with the state of the Party as it now exists.<br />
BARNES: Do you think this has been a misinterpretation? Do you think<br />
the Press has mishandled the reporting of the state of the Liberal<br />
P arty? / 14 </p>
<p>that we'are prepared to act, not only in thc interests of those<br />
people in need and defence and othor avenues, but wherever we feel<br />
it's necessary we'll act, and we won't be bound by precedent and we'll<br />
not hesitate to take action when we think it's necessary.<br />
BARNES: You mentioned social services, sir. In Melbourne, on Friday,<br />
you promised a war on poverty. The economists, whom you mentioned<br />
earlier, suggested that the first shot in this war could be fired by<br />
imcreasing unemployment benefits and pensions, as a way of<br />
stimulating demand. Does this appeal to you?<br />
PRIDT MINISTER: I think you know that at the last Budget we gave the<br />
biggest increase, single increase in the pensicn that had been granted,<br />
and that followed one, a mid-term increase of a half a dollar; added<br />
together they were pretty big increases, and accepted as such by the<br />
Australian people; because I've heard less comment about the pension<br />
increase this year than in the twenty-one years that I've been in<br />
Parliament. I doubt whether that is the way to stimulate demand.<br />
The way we are going about it now, and I'd have to repeat this, but<br />
I might have even made it clear before; I think you know though I'd<br />
better make this as a preface but there is a potential for very<br />
much in very great growth-in demand becausG savings are at an a~ l<br />
time high, and if the economy starts to gather speed, and it can do<br />
that fairly quickly, then we could have demand inflation superim~ posing<br />
itself on cost inflati~ on, and that would create great damage -nd great<br />
problems for the community. But what we've done I'll mention them<br />
ene by one to you. We gave help for, I thought, the area of grqatest<br />
need and that was nursing homes and nursing attention. We then<br />
intervened on interest rates. We took action so far as migration was<br />
concerned, to cut it down, particularly over the Christmas period.<br />
And I announced what we would do, on Thursday, about rural<br />
unemployment. So you'll see here a Government anxious and willing<br />
tC? take action when the need arises. But you asked me another<br />
question, and that was the question of w~ here we'd gone wrong. I don't<br />
think we've gone wrong anywhere and I'd like somebody to tell me<br />
where we'ye gone wrong, and if they can, I'll give them the answer,<br />
the answer from my Government's point of view.<br />
MOORE: Sir, in the light of your experience as Prime Minister, are there<br />
any. major changes that you would like to see made to Parliamentary<br />
procedure?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am disturbed about Parliamentary procedures, yes. I<br />
had one major one Mr. Solomon will well recognise about the bank<br />
up of Bills at the end of sessions, and we've overcome that, I think<br />
more or less completely.<br />
MOORE: Are you happy with the working of Question Time? That's often<br />
being criticised.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: At the moment, at the momrent, I think the main problem,<br />
about Questinpi Time is that petitions are presented in the way they<br />
are, and I think it's taken away from the vitality and the great<br />
interest there was in Question Time. If you have fifteen minutes on<br />
petitions, somehow or other the interest goes out of it and the<br />
vitality is gone. Now petitions must be presented, but I'd like to<br />
see Question Time get back to its former vitality. </p>
<p>The second point that I'd like to make is that I think too much is<br />
made of trying to concentrate on the Prime Minister in matters that<br />
are outside his jurisdiction and portfolio. I'm trying to ensure<br />
that we got back to the British Cabinet system of Government practicer<br />
and for that matter the Menzies Government Cabiinet practices of<br />
directing questions to the responsible Minister; I'd like that to<br />
change.<br />
But the other big change that I'd like to ensure is that matters of<br />
great public importance, like the state of the economy, defence, the<br />
Ind~ an Ocean, social services, are debated in the House. We can't<br />
do that because we really have so much legislation, so many Bills'<br />
comning forward, that if we want to get through within a reasonable<br />
time, then we have to reduce the time during which we can discuss<br />
matters of great public importance.<br />
MOORE: Would you like to see Parliament televised?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
BARNES: Sir, Mr. Gorton said on the eve of the last elections, that<br />
h , e believed 18-year olds would have the vote by the next election.<br />
Will they?<br />
PRIIC MINISTER: Again you're asking me what is a policy decision and I<br />
wouldn't answer a policy decision on a quostinn and -answer sessi~ on,<br />
even though it's as an important a one as the one I'm attending today.<br />
SOLOMON: Sir, are you considering any changes in your Ministry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I beg your pardon?<br />
SOLOMON: Are you considering any changes in your ministry or are you<br />
satisfied with the way all of your Ministers have gone?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm very satisfied with my C--abinet and Ministry.<br />
CARLETON: Prime Minister, can I raise a major political issue within<br />
your jurisdiction....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hadn't quite finished what I wanted to say to David<br />
Solomon. Would you mind if I just finished it? I'm sorry to keep<br />
saying this to you, but I would like to finish the answer. Leaving<br />
Sir Robert out of it, I think this is probably leaving myself out<br />
of it, too, I think this is probably the best Cabinet I've sat with.<br />
They each have an opportunity to, nresent their views when they want<br />
to, and they do so. They're highly intelligent people and I believe<br />
the decisions they've been making are right, so I'm proud to be a<br />
member of the team, and I'm proud to be able to lead a group of<br />
blokes who .1 think have got a lot of intelligence, and certainly<br />
present their ideas in a very cogent way.<br />
CARLETON: Sir, a major Political issue rIght within your jurisdiction,<br />
and that is the issue of Parliamentary salaries. Now the argument<br />
from yourself and from the Treasurer so often is that the economy<br />
falls down because the unions demand too much by way of wage demands.<br />
Is it not incumbent u. Don you to set a good example next week and not<br />
tdke a salary rise yourself? </p>
<p>17.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is incumbent upon us and a very heavy responsibilityto<br />
use my own phrase to show moderation andl to give leadership, and<br />
we will.<br />
BARNES: Sir, when Mr. Whitlam was on this programme, he challenged us<br />
that if ever you were on the programme we'd ask you the same matters<br />
on law reform. May I ask you sir what is your attitude towards<br />
abortion reform?<br />
PRIKE MINISTER: I gave the answer to this question in the House.<br />
Fundamentally this is a State problem and it only concerns us in the<br />
Federal capital and in the territories. I would not give an answer<br />
to this until I had discussed it with my Cabinet and with my Party,<br />
because there are strong differences of opinion there and I would<br />
want to test their views before I'd be prepared to introduce a Bill<br />
into the House, I see no prospect of introducing a Bil. in the House<br />
during this Parliament.<br />
BARNES: But do you have a personal view on the matter sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have a personal view, yes. I Wkould not express it.<br />
SOLOMON: Does that mean that the prnposed criminal code for the A. C. T.<br />
and the Northern Territory which was tabled in the Parliament in<br />
1969 and which was going to be introduced next year won't come in?<br />
Because it deals with the...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: a question. I did not know about this<br />
pxoposal relating to the Australian Capital Territory. I've not<br />
heard of it before and I can't give you an answer to that question.<br />
As you know I've been the Prime Minister for nine months and if it<br />
was introduced then it was introduced at a time when I was not the<br />
Prime Minister and it didn't come within my jurisdiction as the<br />
Foreign Minister.<br />
BARNES*: Capital punishment is also included in this Bill Sir. The<br />
Committee which set and recommended the Bill declined to make<br />
recommendations on what they saw as policy issues. Capital<br />
punishment, abortion refonmhomosexuality..... . we've dealt<br />
with abortion. Could you tell us your attitude towards capital*<br />
punishment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I can tell you my attitude towards capital<br />
punishment. I've got a horror of capital punishment. It seems<br />
stringe that I should put it to you in that way but I have, and on<br />
every occasion when the question of capital punishment has come into<br />
the Federal Cabinet, I have expressed my strong, and I believe,<br />
unchangeab-1-view that I don't believ. e in capital punishment. I<br />
don't think it's a practical question therefore because in all the<br />
time that I've been there twenty, twenty-one years whatever it<br />
happens to be the recommendations, if there have been any relating<br />
to capital punishment, have never been agreed to, and consequently no<br />
such recommendations have been made to the Governor-General. I<br />
think it's improbable, highly improbable, that there'd ever be<br />
capital punishment, certainly whilst I'm the Prime Minister, or while<br />
the Liberal-Country Party is in power. .4./ 18 </p>
<p>18.<br />
CARL~ ETON: A very very quick question, Mr. McMahon. Will you ever go<br />
on television in a television debate with Mr. Whitlam?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'll make up my mind when the circumstances arise.<br />
CARLETON: Prior to the next election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to.. mnot going, to commit myself<br />
under any circumstances to hypothetical questions, but when I've<br />
previously been with Mr. Whitlam I think most people remember the<br />
results. I've got a phenomonally good memory and know what I'm<br />
talking about.<br />
MOORE: Sir, we began we're nearly to the end of our time we<br />
began this conference by looking ahead to the~ next election, and<br />
tees one issue that some people think may be an issue at the<br />
election that we haven't mentioned yet, and that is immigration,<br />
our immigration policy. Do you see our immigration policy as being<br />
an issue at the next election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I do, and a very important issue, and we will not<br />
change our policy, which is based on two seprartate considerations<br />
or three. The first one is that we must be certain that the person<br />
can be integrated into the A11ustralian community, that he has talents<br />
of t"-he kind that we want, and that he will be able to make his<br />
contribution to the development of our country. Now we are not<br />
racist but we are selective in the people that we chcose to comne here.<br />
On the contrary the Labor Party's attitude is one that it believes<br />
that apart from family reunions then there should be a nondiscriminatory<br />
practice with regard to others. Now if this happened,<br />
over sixty per cent of British migrants would be prevented fr-) m<br />
coming; we'd get practically none from Western Germany, from the<br />
Scandinavian countries, or from South American countries; or I think<br />
too, but I'm not absolutely certain of this, from North America. So<br />
their poli&amp; j therefore is one that is dif-ferent to ours in this<br />
sen ' se. We base ours on what we regard as in our best interests, the<br />
best interests of Australia, and consequently we select those that we<br />
think will help uis. Theirs, so far as I ye said. is non-discriminatory,<br />
and consequently you can find people coming in that won't make the<br />
kind of contribution I think they should be in a position to make.<br />
MOORE: Do you believe in a homogeneous Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I do.<br />
MOORE: And what does that mean to you homogeneous?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It means integration, it means the people will become<br />
Australian6, and we won't have little enclaves here, and we won't<br />
introduce the kind of problem that other countries have at the moment.<br />
MOORE: Is colour a factor in determining whether the country is<br />
homogeneous?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I don't think it is<br />
MOORE: It's irrelevant? ./ 19 </p>
<p>19.<br />
PRIME M4INISTER: I'don't think it is, but we want to be certain that<br />
as I said, and I gave this answer before, so I'm really repeating<br />
what I said a few moments ago, we are not racist and I think my<br />
history is enough--to show how well I get on with the Asian and<br />
African people, my great liking for them. But we're not going to<br />
introduce problems here of a kind they have in other parts of the<br />
world.<br />
MOORE: But you also said that colour is not a factor to be taken into<br />
acQount?<br />
PRI14E MINISTER: No, and if you look at our policy, you will find, and<br />
I haven't got the figures readily in my mind, but they've been<br />
mentioned in the House on several occasions, that of course we<br />
introduce, or we allow people of different colours and different<br />
religions and different races to come in here.<br />
BARNES: Sir isn't it racist to allow those people to come here and yet<br />
not pay them assisted passage, and yet to pay assisted passage to<br />
people who are white skinned?<br />
PRIME MINSITER: I don't think that that's got anything to do with the<br />
principles at all. That's the means by which you get them here.<br />
BARNES: But it's a racist discrimination between one another, sir, I would<br />
suggest.<br />
-PRIME, M INISTER: I don't. I think you're playing with words saying that;<br />
merely because you don't give then assisted passages doesn't mean to<br />
say that it's racist. We've got our policy relating to the kind of<br />
people that we'll bring in anA it is non-racist in origin. -The mere<br />
fact as an incident of that we have p~ roblems associated with assisted<br />
pas sages I don't think is relevant. But can I take you a little<br />
further? Shortly the British will be terminating, or giving-an<br />
indication or a clear indication that they will terminate assisted<br />
passages. Now does that mean that because we might not then, if this<br />
comes to fruition, we might not then have assisted passages from the<br />
United Kingdom, does that mean to say we're treating them as racist?<br />
BARNES: No, if white and black are treated the same, sir , I wouldn't<br />
call it racist.<br />
PRI14E MINISTER: Well I can't agree with you, with qreat respect to you.<br />
I don't think it is relevant. The real problem is one, the real<br />
issue is one of what are our principles and policies, and our<br />
principles and policies are the three that I mentioned, and we do<br />
allow coloured people to come in I don't like using the word<br />
coloured pople but we do allow noeple of other race and ! other<br />
colours to come in, and I'd be only too happy to get the figures for<br />
you and let you have them some time tonight.<br />
MOORE: Prime Minister, thank you very much for giving us so much time<br />
on MONDAY CONFERENCE. </p>
