ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J K] EATING MP<br />
OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS CENTRE, TOKYO<br />
THURSDAY, 25 MAY 1995<br />
1 am very honoured that Mr Toyosbirna Chairman of JETRO, is<br />
present today on the opening of this Australian Business Centre.<br />
9 The Centre brings together in one location Australias<br />
Commonwealth and State official export, investment and tourism<br />
promotion bodies.<br />
0 The Centre is the first of its kind for Australia<br />
and it is fitting that it should be established in the capital of our<br />
greatest trading partner.<br />
It reflects our recognition of the continued importance of our economic<br />
relationship and confidence in its future.<br />
a And, it shows our determination to work hard in this market, to<br />
diversify the base of our trade, to support long-standing business<br />
relationships and to help new ones get established.<br />
a Between 1990 and 1993 Australias exports of goods and services to<br />
Japan grew by nearly 20 per cent in Australian dollar terms and by<br />
over 4 per cent in US dollar terms<br />
in either measure the growth in our exports exceeded the growth<br />
in Japan's total imports of goods and services. </p>
<p>Our highest value-added exports ( ETMS) grew at a trend rate of just<br />
over 11 per cent in the five year period to 1993-94.<br />
And our export of services for the five year period to 1992-93 grew at<br />
a rate of just under 12 per cent.<br />
Japanese figures for Japan's 1994 financial year say imports from<br />
Australia grew by 11 per cent over 1993.<br />
But there is no doubt we could and should do a lot better, The<br />
Government can help: with initiatives of this kind, with Austrade and,<br />
most importantly, by creating a competitive economic climate and one<br />
favourable to exporters. But in the final analysis its success depends<br />
on Australian business.<br />
The scale of Japan's economy needs to be understood by Australian<br />
exporters a one per cent growth in Japan's GDP increases Japan's economy<br />
by the size of New Zealand's GDP<br />
a small slice of a Japanese sectoral market, like housing or food,<br />
can be worth many times more than a large slice of the market in<br />
other countries.<br />
There is no question about the opportunities which exist in the<br />
emerging markets but no Australian exporter should ignore the<br />
rewards of succeeding in Japan.<br />
And it should also be understood that, while Japan's market is difficult,<br />
it is opening up more and more<br />
we must take advantage of the inevitable changes which are<br />
taking place in the structure of the Japanese economy, which are<br />
being speeded up by the appreciation of the yen.<br />
The lesson for Australia is that our opportunities are growing faster<br />
than perhaps many understand </p>
<p>tme competition will be hot. There are no easy pickings. But the<br />
proof is there that competitive and determined Austalian<br />
businesses do succeed.<br />
This Centre represents a further important step in focussing Australia's<br />
marketing efforts in Japan<br />
three years ago Australia opened four consulates throughout<br />
Japan to service Japan's regional economies<br />
we are now opening for business in the very centre of Tokyo,<br />
making access for businessmen and tourists much easier as we<br />
approach the Olympics in Sydney in the year 2000.<br />
This centre also demonstrates the Commonwealth government's<br />
determination to work closely with the Australian states to promote<br />
Australia abroad.<br />
I would like to congratulate all the centre's members and wish them<br />
well in this important venture.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to declare the centre open.<br />
ENDS </p>
