PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 337<br />
September 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO THE COOK ISLANDS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced<br />
in Canberra today that he would be visiting the<br />
Cook Islands and participating briefly in the<br />
South Pacific Conference, which is being held there<br />
from 25 September to 7 October 1974. He will be<br />
in Rarotonga from 26-27 September, en route to the<br />
United States to begin his North American visit.<br />
The Australian delegation to the South Pacific<br />
Conference will be led by the Minister for Science,<br />
Mr. Morrison. Senators C. G. Primmer and N. T. Bonner<br />
will also attend the Conference as Parliamentary<br />
Observers. The 1974 Conference will meet under new<br />
arrangements agreed on earlier this year. These<br />
arrangements resulted from an initiative by the<br />
Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Willesee, to<br />
broaden and strengthen the Conference.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that Australia attaches importance<br />
to the South Pacific Conference as the one body which<br />
embraces all Pacific Island communities and those countries<br />
which still have direct responsibilities in the area.<br />
He said Australia saw its role in the South Pacific<br />
as one of co-operation and good neighbourliness.<br />
To this en&amp; Australia supported the Conference in its<br />
many activities directed towards the economic and social<br />
development of the region.<br />
