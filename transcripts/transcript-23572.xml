    <content><![CDATA[<p>The President of Singapore, Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam will visit Australia from 15-20 June at the invitation of the Governor-General, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd).</p>
<p>Australia’s relationship with Singapore is one of our closest and most comprehensive in South East Asia, and is based on our long-standing trade, investment, political, education, defence and people-to-people links.</p>
<p>Singapore is Australia’s largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN and our fifth largest trading partner overall. Australia has extended a guest invitation to Singapore to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane this year, underscoring Singapore’s role as a key member of the global financial system.</p>
<p>President Tan will call on the Governor-General and attend a state lunch in his honour at Government House. President Tan will also attend other meetings in Canberra, as well as Adelaide and Perth.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting with President Tan in Canberra on June 17.</p>
<p>President Tan is a true friend of Australia’s and a champion of our longstanding bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>13 June 2014</p>
