TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE -17 AUGUST 1984, 5.30 P. M.<br />
PM: Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that you haven't yet<br />
E-en able to receive a copy of the repjort. We tried to<br />
expedite that to you. I will make a statement to you,<br />
and read relevant sections of the report. Once I have made<br />
that statomeont Mr. Young and 1 are Faiiable foz any questions.<br />
I hope thaL will satisfy everyone. I make thiEs point if when<br />
you get the report which should be availab" e -uery shortly, i-ff<br />
you wanted to speak to me again I hope it1 won't be ncessary<br />
but if you do w-ant to, I am prepared to meet you again.<br />
The report wIas made available to me this morning in Melhou~ cne<br />
when Mr. Black. and Counsel Assistinc), 1M1r. Dunn, geve me th?-<br />
report in my Melbouyne office and I hall tlte opportunity of<br />
discussion ., 7ith them thien, I am very pleased to be able to say<br />
that the report completely and unequivocally clears Mr. Young<br />
of any suggestion of impropriety, intention or-attk empt to<br />
evade custo-ils duty or to use improperly any in:' luence ani in a<br />
complete exoneration of Mr. Youngj in resrject o. 2 anvy suaggst. ions<br />
that have bec: r,,. made acrainst him. And Speaking personally, of<br />
course, and on behalf of the Gove -nment T welcnmeci thatI -f: indinq<br />
and am glad that now-M~ r. YouncT is fully re-instated into theic<br />
Government because on receiving the rE: ro-rt an-" -reaci.: inq i.-I<br />
immediately signed the appropriato lotters on ] ciy return to my<br />
Canberra office to 14r. Young ai~ d to Mr. Bowen and to Mr. Peazley,<br />
And so as of this afternoon Mr. Young is fu~ lly restored to his<br />
position of Special. Minister oi StLat-L, and cf Leadler of the llousZ..<br />
The report will be tabled J t: he Parliaii-ent on Tuesday and if<br />
the opposition so desire! s an opportunit1y will bo macde avail&amp;. ble<br />
duriiig the week for deb; ate on the rcpor-' c,<br />
JOURINALIST: M~ r. Hawke, does this mean tha~ t r. Young did not<br />
make any false declaration to Customs. is that whot the report<br />
says?<br />
P11: Lot me read to you. I ind~ iiated that If w, ulci read. to you<br />
the relevant passages . which of coursc are properly to he un( orstood<br />
in the context of the vholc report. I %-iJll ) ead what is Ann1otated<br />
now ar; page 132 on the copy that 1 have. Part 13. Vniethcr any </p>
<p>impropriety may have occurr: ed in the actions of the Honourable<br />
MJ Young. " Befure expressing mry final conclusions it is<br />
necessary to consider w'c: ther any impropriety may have occurred<br />
in the actions of Mr. Young in the making of the Customs<br />
declaration. I have concluded that there was no intention to<br />
evade duty, no attempt to evade duty, and no attempt wilfully<br />
to mislead any Customs Officer. Very strict standards are<br />
expected of persons holding high public office in their approach<br />
to the completion of documents of the nature of a Customs<br />
declaration. I conclude that Mr. Young, notwithstanding the<br />
] ifficulty with which he was presented by the circumstances and<br />
by the wording of the form, should have taken more time and<br />
exercised greater care so that questions could not reasonably<br />
have arisen about its correctness. On the facts, as I have<br />
concluded them to be, I am of the -view that the circumstances<br />
fell short of impropriety and that a positive finding that there<br />
was no impropriety should be made. No other aspects of Mr. Youn. g's<br />
conduct require further consideration in this context."<br />
He then goes on on the following page to conclusions and I read<br />
the relevant section. It goes on, The Honourable MJ Young:<br />
" There was no impropriety in the actions of the Hon. MJ Young.<br />
Mr. Young did not at any stage use or attempt to use his official<br />
position to his advantage or to divert any person from the<br />
proper and impartial performance of his duty. I express no<br />
conclusions as to whether any breach of the law of the Co. Konw?. alth<br />
may have occurred. My reasons for taking this course appear in<br />
Part 12 of this report, It should not be inferred that I make arny<br />
finding that a breach of the slawo: f the Commonwealth may have<br />
occurred in the actions of the Hon. MJ Young."<br />
Clearly you would need to read Part 12 of the report that he<br />
refers to there, but if I may attempt to summarise for you Part 32<br />
of the report, and I do that in the sense that after you have re: ad<br />
it yourself, of course I am available for questions. But<br />
essentially what Mr. Black says in Part 12 of the report is that<br />
section 209 of the Act deals with the process there for sumnarily<br />
dealing with the situation where the form has not covered the<br />
declaration of goods and that process he finds was appropriately<br />
applied. And he refers to the fact that under Section 209 of the<br />
Act it is specifically provided that once that process has bcen<br />
followed, which he specifically find.; was in all respects<br />
appropriately followed then no further action can be taken. He<br />
then says he looks hypothetically at the question of Section<br />
234e of the Act which deals with the question of the filling in oF<br />
the forms and on that he deals with the question of knowledge and<br />
the line between knowledge and belief. ie deals with the submis. sion.<br />
of Mr. Young's Counsel in which he says he finds merit and says<br />
that there is no statement of the la-on the matter, but it is not<br />
appropriate in those circumstances and indeed would be unfair to<br />
go to that hypothetical question. That is the essence to the<br />
reference to Part 12 of his report. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Young who paid for the charter that brought<br />
you to Canberra today, an.. why C'id you use a charter?<br />
YOUNG: Well I received a message from the Prime Minister to<br />
return to Canberra as quickly as I could and as you are probably<br />
aware now, you may have been aware earlier, that I'd been<br />
invited some days ago to partake in a sort of 60 Minutes<br />
extravaganza. They take a bit of time to do it. They had<br />
been with me for the past three days. Arrangements were made<br />
for us travel down here on a private jet which their company,<br />
I understand, will pick up the bill for and send me an<br />
account of the three fares of myself andi'my two staff members.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Young do you feel as though you were unfairly<br />
treated by your colleagues and in particular do you resent<br />
the fact the four Parliamentary Leaders didn't advise you<br />
of the new information before they took their decision.<br />
YOUNG: Well Milton, let me say this about the enquiry. As<br />
you know I'm on reco:. rd as saying I didn't think it was<br />
necessary and I suspect we all feel that way when what<br />
we know to be true is challenged and I suspect it becomes<br />
a difficult and complex question for a government to decide<br />
when they received this new information as to how best to<br />
clear it up. As I sac.. id at the time I didn't think the enquiry<br />
was necessary and I'm; pleased that I've b(-en vindicated and<br />
that the views have been tested,, my views which have been tested<br />
over three fairly exhausting weeks both by myself and my family<br />
Shave vindicated what I said then.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think you should have been confronted<br />
by the new information before the decision was taken.<br />
YOUNG: Well I think that's a difficulty which the four<br />
leaders have to deal with when they're given it. And obviously<br />
they chased it up and I was made aware of it after they'd received<br />
their reports back from their primary investigations. And it<br />
seemied to the four leaders then it was the best course to follow,<br />
it was the enquiry., As you know I disagreed because it was like<br />
someone giving infcrnation well Mick's not telling the truth.<br />
And I knew what the events of the day were on July 5th, I knew<br />
what had occurred an. I was confident all along that Mr Black,<br />
QC, would find accordingly.<br />
HAWKE: I should say in respect of the matter generally, a point<br />
I should have made at the beginning, that not only did Mr Black<br />
find as I've indicated in respect of Mick,, but naturally he<br />
has found in respect of Mrs Young and her sister, Mick's sisterin-<br />
law, complete honesty and straightforwardness on their part.<br />
And in respect of officers, public servants of the Co. monwealth,<br />
has also found no impropriety on the part of anyone else. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: M~ r Young do you Lhi~ nk people were out to get<br />
you? YOUNG:. I suppose in politics they always are, sometimes<br />
you've got diffic-flty sort of pinpointing the enemies<br />
and I think that I don't thin]: that Mir Black has found<br />
anybody, that was out to get mec in terms of the case that' s<br />
been presented. I think it's always difficdlt in these<br />
circumstances -tthen someone in.-public office is caught up<br />
in issues like this. So I'm just happy that -he report<br />
says what it does.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do yo'. think: that calthough. you did not behave<br />
improperly you w-ere perhaps foolish?<br />
YOUNG: Never been foolish,<br />
JOURNAUjST: I hope you're not goDing to makel the sax,, e<br />
mistake again.<br />
YOUNG: I'm not going to admit it ' Co the Parliamentary<br />
Press Gallery anyhouv~ r<br />
JOURN! LLIST:-Mr Youig what tonig ' it is your friendship Jike<br />
betx, een yourself ar-d Mr Ka % kIe, IsF i4 j. sh ap?.<br />
YOUNG: V7er. y good shapc and you'll see it in full action<br />
at the forthcoming election,<br />
JOURINALIST: Would you -ct to be involved in the forthicoming<br />
election YOUNG: I'm chairiaQ-in of the National CamPaIgn Cornrittea.<br />
HAWE. He's certainly chai.. rnao.-of the . National Carapai , gn<br />
Committee. And jut let mo say irespact of your alucstion<br />
that there is and can be no gugg-sti. on -that Yx Younq returr<br />
to the full assiumtitjon of his po~ rtfolio in anY -lay di:. 1ii shc c.<br />
rc&amp;= 1-uTas that 1? oY. Lfoli. o in at vxyi: wac wl ent<br />
he will exnect and the GoNFvMIC17 A-72M a-Xl jeCt comrpletc. and<br />
undiminished discharge of is duti. es thr. re, and as Lead. er<br />
of the House, and E&amp; s he scaid as Chairman of -the Nationrl<br />
Campaign Cormittee-. And lie wpill be: ,. as he has been for<br />
many years, a very considerable thiorn in the side of the<br />
Opposition. JOURNALIST: Mr Yoi: ng-vwhich particullar forthxcom. ng election<br />
is that you are referring to?<br />
HAWYE: There's got to be one so-me time doesn't there? </p>
<p>6. JOURN. iLIST: 1,1r Hawke dcsiewihat Mr I-41ack has found and wi de<br />
secu'-. ons of the muedia ha. ve been saving of Mr Young that. he's<br />
an accident prone Jinc., is -thc!. Lt un~ fair label now for<br />
him to wear?<br />
HAVWKE: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr H-awke will the Gov ernment be moving to change<br />
the Customs Law.<br />
HIAWKE: That's a good question and I think-O when you read the<br />
repo--t in full you will see that 1, r1 Black aadresses himself<br />
to this question arid rai! 5es tho. poin-: as to whether in fact<br />
there m-, ay not be a case, for another box of ' Yes', ' Don't<br />
know!. And it's very interesting that lie goes to the point<br />
of this question of the distinction between knowledge and bel-ieff.<br />
and indicates that the).-o is no 6efini:; tive statement of the<br />
law on the points. So your question is a go--od one, I think thatr<br />
it will makc sonse that-in the light of Nr 3lack's repor-t that<br />
the Gov ernment should examine with thec relevant M~ inister anc.<br />
officials as tCo w-. hethler there can be a clarification of these<br />
formTrs wNYich I know personally, aF., d I think anyone who has<br />
travelled ov.; erseas and had to fill1. them in, can pose cr~'~<br />
diffCiculties at times, And a good q,, ues3tion you raise a-nd<br />
I think wc'll give attention to it.<br />
JOURWA-LIST: Does the t-ort, el with. valuation procedures?<br />
HIAWKE Yes indeed. I'm glad you asked that: qinestion. There's<br />
a. very detailed ex.% mri. ntion of that-ruestion, And. I can Say<br />
this that when you read that Fcction of the report I awo oerta-Ln<br />
that anyone who reads it' will be tCot-. lly convinc ed of the integrity<br />
of evcryonc that was involved in that evaluation. That is 14-Younc,,<br />
waho wasn't di5rectly in\ olved in th~ at, it -was Mrs Young an(:. 4.-si<br />
Hughes and the Cust-o-fs officials. An~ d i-t i5 beyond any qutstion<br />
of doubt that involved ac'Ced co'ipletCe integrity and3 indeed<br />
you will. find from the,-report thmt tleo. xmJssJoner finds -that<br />
if anything, on L~ alancc, tC. he amuunt may have-been overstated.<br />
JCUIU14ALIST: Mr. Hakif Mr. Young ha! s done nothing wronc;<br />
at al., is he to be rcf-' unded teCr pcnalty duty he has pai-i<br />
PMi: What action Mr. Young would seek -to -take in that matter<br />
is a question for Mr. young him-se-, lf.,<br />
JOUR~ NALIST: Could we ask Mr. Young?<br />
YOUNG: Yes, you can. It is not at the top of my priorities.<br />
