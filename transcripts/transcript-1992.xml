FOR PRESS; P. M. L No. 1/ 96<br />
" SOUTHERN AURORA" TRAGEDY O~ j3 FE3 11969<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I extend my deepest sympathy to the injured,<br />
and to the families of those killed, in today's tragic rail<br />
collision in Victoria. I amr sure all Australians are shocked at this<br />
terrible accident, and join me In this expression of sympathy.<br />
I have instructed my Department to keep in<br />
touch with the Victorian authorities and to offer all possible<br />
assistance. The Army was quickly on the scene to help with<br />
the rescue operations. My colleague the Minister for Shipping and<br />
Transport, Mr. Sinclair, has offered on behalf of the<br />
Commonwealth Railways to loan the New South Wales<br />
Railways fourteen rail cars so that the " Southern Aurora"<br />
services can be resumed.<br />
