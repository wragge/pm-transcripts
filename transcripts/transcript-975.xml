THE FEDEiZATION OF PARENTS AND CITIZENS' ASSOCIATIONS<br />
Y. V. C. A. S YDNY 14-th AUGUST. 1964<br />

Mr. President, Mr. Minister, the Director and Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen If I haven't on a former occasion appeared before<br />
you, or those vho work with you, I can assure you that it isn't<br />
the fault of your former President, because Sid Liebert and I<br />
were at school together; he was known as " Skinny", and I Has<br />
skinny; so you can tell it was a long, long time ago. Welve<br />
remained great friends, and I know rather more about the<br />
Parents and Citizens than I would have known perhEaps but for<br />
him. Now I want to say at once that I think that the<br />
work that you do is of tremendous importance I've a few<br />
reasons for saying that. nne is that we live, don't we, in<br />
a period, in an age in which there is a dispositicn to think<br />
that governments ought to do everything, and that all we need<br />
to do is pay our taxes, and complain at the way the government<br />
spends them. vihen one encounters the supplementing of public duty<br />
by private voluntary effort, one is greatly encouraged about<br />
the future of the country, and you, ladies and gentlemen here<br />
today, represent in the most striking fashion that spirit of<br />
self-help and of help to others which must never be allowed to<br />
die out; we must never become so regimented that we regard<br />
our duties as confined to our obligations. Now, that's one<br />
reason why m very glad to be here.<br />
Now what is it that you do? I was a schoolboy<br />
once, believe it or not, and a State schoolboy in the State of<br />
Victoria we call them State schools there a little country<br />
school first of all, and then a larger State school in the City<br />
of Ballarat, and then a private secondary school, and then what<br />
we call a Public School in Victoria, and the University. I've<br />
had a fairly versatile experience and perhaps because of that,<br />
I've maintained all through my life the most passionate interest<br />
in the educational development of the country. But in those<br />
days, in those State school days, using the Victorian term,<br />
I don't remember any Parents arid Citizens bodies. You went to<br />
school, you gazed with profound awe at your teachers who gazed<br />
at us correspondingly with profound contempt, and then we went<br />
back home, and iient along to school nexIt day. No-r, what you've<br />
done, and what you are doing on the most extraordinary scale<br />
and in an expanding way, is not only to add to the facilities<br />
that the government provides other things, other human things<br />
that will help to round out, to fill out the life of the<br />
school boy and school girl, and in the course of doing that,<br />
you come into contact with regularity, I venture to believe,<br />
with the schoolteachers. Now, Ilve a very great respect for schoolteachers,<br />
and we all have, but you know, we must never allow them to<br />
become a race apart. We must never allow them to become a race<br />
apart. 4e must never allow them to get into that state of<br />
detachment in which they tell children what they must do, or<br />
ought to do; and not come into adequate contact with the<br />
parts of Australia al:: eady very higbiy Caevei. opec ana urw-t; ore<br />
others that are just crying out for it. But we can't discriminate<br />
tinder the constitution between one State and another. We can,<br />
if we make a grant, Wle can't discriminate in our taxation<br />
laws. We can't say, "' Yell, all right, you can go without paying / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
taxes. Je want to encourage you." Mind you, we've tried to.<br />
' Ie've got a rather unlawful statute operating at the present<br />
time, but as a strict constitutional principle, discrimination<br />
is barred. Now. I just give you that very simple exaiaple of<br />
why the passion for uniformity can be a serious menace to<br />
national growth. And I believe it would be a serious menace<br />
to individual growth.<br />
Today, education, in particular primary and secondary<br />
education, are within the domain of the States, and not within<br />
the domain of the Commonwealth. Now, this is an excellent<br />
thing in my opinion. I would violently resist a proposal<br />
that the whole business of education should be passed over to<br />
the Commonwealth, and put under some central legislative and<br />
administrative control because I believe that would be a very<br />
bad thing for education. And why? Because I don't think it<br />
is necessarily true that the curriculum or circumstances<br />
appropriate to a child north of Cairns is necessarily the same<br />
kind of thing that is appropriate to a child south of Hobart.<br />
This is an enormous country; it has all sorts of differences<br />
of climate and conditions and industrial growth all the<br />
varieties in the world can he fcund in Australia. To say that<br />
every child in Australia must go through exactly the same process<br />
of tuition and be controlled by an all-wise Parliament at Canberra<br />
seems to me to be hopelessly wrong and, indeed, vary dangerous.<br />
Uniformity in education has little to commend it<br />
in my eyes. IPm all for variety, a variecy of schools, a variety<br />
of curricula standards to be observed, yes standards to be raised,<br />
but above all things, never let us lose sight of the fact that all<br />
men ( I say nothing about wcmen for this purpose) but all men are<br />
not the same, and all men are not equal, except in the eyes of<br />
their Maker and I hope, in the eyes of the law, But otherwise<br />
we're individcais, all different: some have great inborn talents<br />
for one thing, some great inborn talents for anothcr some with<br />
moderate talents., and some with ncne beyond -he routine of life.<br />
We know this. Our great function when we approach the problem<br />
of education is to equalise opportunity to see that every boy and<br />
girl has a chance to develop whatever faculties he or she may have,<br />
because this will be a tremendous contribution to the good life<br />
for the nation, and to their own good life, because there's an<br />
immense personal satisfaction in accumulating some of the treasures<br />
of the mind, But we're never to fall into the error of thinking<br />
that we are all equal in talents, in aptitudes, in industry, in<br />
ambition, in energy, because if we are obviously not all identical,<br />
one or the other, in this way, it follows that what may be a very<br />
proper course of education for one may be inadequate for another,<br />
or inappropriate to a third.<br />
I recently had occasion to be reading something about<br />
what has been called the mechanistic approach to life the<br />
system of rather heathen philosophy which was practised by Karl<br />
a-x and. expounded, b. Kar Marx and-by. Engels te idea that<br />
rmn voJ. liion, ind vill pul mnai lilton renily. oi no momunt,<br />
that the whole of history moves along to the exercise of muchanical<br />
forces by material eircumstnces which, of course redces<br />
human respoiiiility to a minimum, and reduces in te human brain<br />
the necessary consciousness of having some command over his own<br />
destiny. And this is to be contrasted with our more civilised<br />
ideas which concentrate upon freedom for the individual, and the<br />
development of the individual the encouragement the opening<br />
of doors, where doors may now be locked and barred but if we<br />
accustom ourselves too much, too easily, to a highly centralised,<br />
uniform, almost authoritarian control over the process of<br />
education, then we will be moving more towards that bad philosophy<br />
to which I referred, and away from the good philosophy in which<br />
I think all of us here this morning most firmly believe, </p>
<p>Now, Sir, I don't want to hold you up at any<br />
length, but I wanted to say those things because every now<br />
and then I detect a temptation in people's minds to say that<br />
if we're going to have a proper, effective, one hundred per cent.<br />
satisfactory educational system it's the Commonwealth that must<br />
do it. Jell there's a very old proverb about the man who pays<br />
the piper calling the tune, and it's pretty deep-seated in human<br />
nature, I'm the last man to complain about the Commonwealth<br />
being called upon to make contribution where contribution is<br />
necessary. I, in fact, have the great honour of having instituted<br />
a system of advances in the tertiary field, in the University<br />
field, which have now amounted to very large sums of money paid<br />
out by the Commonwealth every year, and I don't complain of it,<br />
I'm proud of it. I think it was right, because I think the<br />
universities would have gone hopelessly bankrupt if we hadn't<br />
come in. In a week or two I'm going to receive a report, I'm<br />
told, from a special committee set up to investigate tertiary<br />
education, and this report will most obviously though I've<br />
not seen a word of it but I know will contain recommendations<br />
of a far-reaching kind, which will produce, no doubt, a few pale<br />
and wan countenances in the Treasury. But that's in the future,<br />
though it's in the very near future.<br />
We have recently intervened in the secondary fiald<br />
to the extent of our provision of scholarships and of science<br />
teaching facilities both of these things of tremendous<br />
importance if, firs t we're going to maKe the best use of our<br />
universities and if, second, we're going to increase the resources,<br />
the scientific and technological resources of this new world<br />
into which we move,<br />
But all I want to say to you is this, that if the<br />
habit develops of saying that the Cemmonwealth ought to take over<br />
the financial responsibility for education as a whole ( and we<br />
now carry quite a handsome percentage cf it. I may say), but if<br />
the Commonwealth is to be told time after times " You must take<br />
over the financial responsibility for education", then don't<br />
you think that it's quite likely that the Commonwealth Parliament,<br />
or the Government of the day may say: " Well, if we're to have<br />
all the responsibility we must have all the control. If we're<br />
to pay the piper in full, we must call the tune in full." Look,<br />
this is a very great danger. It's not a danger with me, I may<br />
say, but then, of course, I won't, strange as it may seem, last<br />
forever. It would be no danger with me, because I have the<br />
most violent objection to the Commonwealth interfering with the<br />
States in the exercise of their powers because they do their<br />
jobs very well, and I have no shadow of complaint about it.<br />
But in the long run, if you take a broad view of<br />
constitutional growth, and compare it with the history of other<br />
countries, you will realise that in every Federal system ( and<br />
that's the most difficult system in the world it's the most<br />
legalistic system in the world), that in every Federation you<br />
either have a movement away from the centre, so that the<br />
Federation tends to break up, or you have a centripetal movement<br />
so that more and more power goes to the centre, sometimes without<br />
constitutional amendment at all; so that you may finally say:<br />
" Well, the States have become mere shadows the whole power is in<br />
the central Parliament and administration. Now, this is<br />
elementary, constitutional history, I am bound to say.<br />
In modern times, we've seen two new Federations<br />
established: one in the West Indies, and one in Africa the<br />
Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each of them broke up<br />
within a few years; neither of them lasted I think the one in<br />
e </p>
<p>Africa lasted for ten years, the one in the West Indies for<br />
almost a matter of months. And that's because the instinct<br />
for central government was weak and the parts came apart,<br />
separated into their original form. Now in Australia the<br />
process is different. The whole movement here has been rather<br />
to strengthen the position of the central administration,<br />
particularly in financial matters; and this is, perhaps, an<br />
inevitable part of history. But I don't want, myself, to see<br />
that centralising process in terms of power, authority, control,<br />
carried to a point . where the States no longer manage their own<br />
educational programmes and affairs. Nothing could be worse.<br />
You must have a proper respect for politicians,<br />
but you must also have a certain healthy distrust of ua. lTe're<br />
not always to be entrusted with great pouer. It's a very good<br />
thing to have a division of power, if you're going to preserve<br />
liberty. Give any political orgnisation full power, and you<br />
are taking the first step in the direction of a tyranny which<br />
will be based on the idea that as all of those whom we control<br />
must obey us, then they must all be uniform, they must just be,<br />
so to speak, pawns in The power game. Don't, don't ever permit<br />
yourself to get into a position where there's a strong movement<br />
to hand over education to the Commcnwealth.<br />
I, speaking as the beneficiary of the educational<br />
systems of my own country, of all sorts, would regard it as a<br />
bad day for Australia if we ceased to have this variety of<br />
authorities, this variety of curricula in the schools, this<br />
immense variety of parents visiting the schools, t2ling to the<br />
teachers, producing a broad attitude of mind, encouraging the<br />
teacher by their interest, learning from him, and at the 3ame<br />
time, all the time, contributing; to this variety in human<br />
nature which, when you consider it, is the essence of life,<br />
isn't it? Just thirnk of it: suppose we wore all the same,<br />
suppose you looked all the same. I would h., ve gone mad instantly,<br />
and I nevor would have received my award as the Father of the<br />
Year. Sir, I have the greatest pleasure in the world in<br />
declaring this Conference open. 5 </p>
