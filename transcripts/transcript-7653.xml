TRANSCRIPT OF PMES CONFERENCE Lon= O, 21 CONi 1989<br />
E aO0E ROO ONLY<br />
PM:' Gentlemen, what I'd like to do at the outset is to give<br />
you, and refer to, the issues briefly and I'm open to any<br />
questions that you would like to address to me on those<br />
matters. The first subject of course was a mutual welcoming by the<br />
British Prime Minister and myself, my Ministers and hers on<br />
the fact of the meeting and the stature of the meeting.<br />
There has never before been a meeting at such a high level<br />
of Prime Ministers and Ministers which was indicative of the<br />
importance that we, on both sides, attach not merely to a<br />
strengthening of the bilateral relationships which we see as<br />
ipoan, but also to take the opportunity to consider<br />
together a range or international and regional issues on<br />
which the percept ions of our two gove rnments generally<br />
coincide. Without-order of importance I go to those issues<br />
we mentioned and talked about.<br />
I first of all say that I mentioned to Mrs Thatcher the<br />
decision that we've made in Australia to recognise the<br />
anniversary of Gallipoli next year. I have indicated to her<br />
the plans that we will be following through to give to that<br />
important recognition and Mrs Thatcher was very interested<br />
in that and will consider the way in which they can be<br />
0 involved with us.<br />
It would be no surprise to you that I discussed with<br />
Margaret Thatcher the question of the next Secretary-General<br />
of the Commonwealth. I advanced to here the candidature of<br />
Malcolm Fraser and the reasons why I and the Government of<br />
Australia believe that he would be the most appropriate<br />
selection. Let me say in that regard that our pressing of<br />
the candidature of Malcolm Fraser involves in any<br />
sense on our part of the qualities of the other candidate<br />
I believe that the Commonwealth is in a fortunate<br />
position to have two candidates of excellence, but it is our<br />
view our strong view that taking all things into<br />
consideration, that Mr Fraser would be an appropriate<br />
choice. To be fair to Mrs Thatcher, she gave me no response<br />
on that positive or negative, but I regarded it as* </p>
<p>PM ( cont): appropriate to advance that candidature and may<br />
I say i'm grateful to Mrs Fraser for the very careful<br />
consideration that she gave to what I had to say on this<br />
matter. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
pm: We what was that?<br />
JTOURNALIST: You said Mrs Fraser.<br />
PM: Mrs Fraser did I say? Well, don't read anything into<br />
that. N~ o, historically, Mrs Fraser's perceptions in this<br />
area have been fairly sensible as I recall. You might<br />
translate that to mean<br />
We had discussions about the environment. I welcomed the<br />
fact Mrs Thatcher has taken a considerable lead in greater<br />
environmental matters, particularly with her hosting, here<br />
in this city, of a conference in March on the question of<br />
the ozone layer. We have agreed that Australia and the<br />
United Kingdom should co-operate at the level of officials<br />
in our respective pursuit of appropriate policies in this<br />
area. we obviously had a discussion about the decision of<br />
the Australian Government not sign the proposed Antarctic<br />
Minerals Convention. I explained to Mrs Thatcher the<br />
reasons for my Government arriving at that decision. Again,<br />
this was an issue of course where Mrs Thatcher and her<br />
Government had pursued a different position. They are going<br />
through Parliamentary processes for ratification of that<br />
Convention. However we explained why we took the position<br />
that we did and I guess in that sense there was an agreement<br />
to disagree as to processes, but let me say there is a<br />
shared perception of importance of protecting that<br />
important, indeed unique, environment.<br />
A considerable amount of our time was taken up on discussing<br />
the developments the tragic developments In China in<br />
general, and of course in a particular sense, the<br />
implications of that for the future of Hong Kong. We are at<br />
one of course, in our unqualified condemnation of the<br />
brutality and the repression which has characterised recent<br />
times in China and most particularly most recently in our<br />
condemnation of the execution of those Chinese-who are<br />
associated with the train incident in Shanghai. That sort<br />
of action is intolerable. It is a response out of all<br />
conceivable proportion to the incident and, in our<br />
judgement, should be unequivocally condemed as we do. We<br />
discussed, of course, what should be the approach in the<br />
future and I think it is fair to say that we share a common<br />
view that we have, as I put it I think yesterday in<br />
answer to a question in the city, that you have to walk that<br />
line between, on the one hand, consistently and </p>
<p>PM ( cont): unequivocally condemning what has occured in<br />
China. Secondly, at the same time recognising that it is in<br />
the interests of the people of China, the region and of the<br />
world, that the processes of economic reform should proceed<br />
in China and it will be a question of judgement for us in<br />
the West as to the decisions that are taken, that<br />
consistently with our condemnation of what has happened<br />
there, how we can assist, acceptably, in the processes of<br />
continued economic reform in China.<br />
In regard to Hong Kong, we discussed that issue. We share a<br />
hope of course that the changes in China will be such that<br />
what I'm now seeing as potentially enormous pressures of<br />
demand from Hong Kong citizens for settlment in other<br />
countries may change. But I have indicated that as far as<br />
Australia is concerned we, in this year, doubled our intake<br />
now of people from Hong Kong as immigrants to Australia. We<br />
have, on the other area of concern in regard to Hong Kong<br />
that is, the influx of Vietnamese refugees of course a<br />
position where we are able to speak with very considerable<br />
strength. I repeat there that we have taken on a per capita<br />
basis more refugess from Vietnam than any other country<br />
118,000 since 1975. We are in total agreement that the<br />
situation now is a different one that the character of the<br />
influx into Hong Kong from Vietnam is now not that of the<br />
political refugee, but of the economic refugee and that<br />
requires a different response. There is no justification<br />
for any expectation in regard to those people and that there<br />
should be the same attitude to the preparedness to absorb as<br />
in the case of political refugees.<br />
While I'm talking about China, we brought to the attention<br />
of Mrs Thatcher and her colleagues the fact that there are<br />
certain multilateral treaties that have been made applicable<br />
by the United Kingdom to Hong Kong and also apply to China<br />
its convention on the prevention of genocide, the<br />
convention of elimination of forms of racial discrimation,<br />
the convention on the political rights of wonen there are<br />
two multilateral treaties that have been made applicable by<br />
the United Kingdom to Hong Kong, but China is niot a party to<br />
them. Those two are the International Covenant on Economic,<br />
Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on<br />
Civil and Political Rights. We believe that pressure should<br />
be applied upon China to have and become a party to those<br />
two international conventions.<br />
Next on the list, but not necessarily of course in order of<br />
Importance, is the question of the Olympics the venue of<br />
the Olympics in 1996. I indicated to Mrs Thatcher that the<br />
United Kingdom has a city as an applicant for the hosting of<br />
those events Manchester. We have Melbourne, and I said to<br />
Mrs Fraser, I know that you'* re not wrapped in the system of<br />
preferential voting in this country maybe in regard to </p>
<p>PM ( cant): this situation you will tikupt Lhtu view that ifE<br />
Manchester doesn't get up, you'd give your preference to<br />
Melbourne. We talked about Irido-china. The proposed Paris conference<br />
and I think broadly we are at one in our hope that the<br />
conference is going to lead to an effective resolution of<br />
the tragedy in Cambodia and we indicated the intention of my<br />
Government to participate fully in that conference and to do<br />
whatever we could to assist, we engaged In some speculation<br />
as to what would be the impact of developments in China upon<br />
those processes and to the obvious conclusion that it is not<br />
possible to be dogmatic about what will be the effect of<br />
those developments i~ n China, on the position that China will<br />
adopt in regard to these settlement processes, that we<br />
express the hope that China would continue to play a<br />
positive role in those process.<br />
We spoke about the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone. The<br />
position as you know is that the Soviet Union and China have<br />
agreed to the protocols of that agreement together<br />
with France and the United states is not. I took the<br />
opportunity of rehearsing and bringing up to date the<br />
arguments that we see strongly the favour the question of<br />
adhering to those protocols. I received no commitment from<br />
Mrs Thatcher but they were she and the Ministers were<br />
interested in hearing our assessment of developments in the<br />
South Pacific region, developments which in my judgement<br />
and the judgement of my Ministers add to the arguments<br />
that were put before in favour of adherence to those<br />
protocols.<br />
We had a considerable discussion about the Middle East in<br />
general and the tragedy of Lebanon in particular. We agreed<br />
that every support and assistance should be given to the<br />
three representatives of the Arab League, that is, Morocco,<br />
Algeria and Saudi Arabia. The leaders of those countries,<br />
as you know, are currently engaged in the process of trying<br />
to get a method of resolution of the tragedy in Lebanon and<br />
we agreed that every moral support should be given to those<br />
processes in an attempt to bring an end to that now 40 year<br />
old tragedy in Lebanon. In regard to the Middle East, of<br />
course generally, we expressed the view that there ought to<br />
be negotiation that the statements of Mr A. raf at from the end<br />
of last year has created, with all the qualifications as is<br />
appropriate for role to put upon those statements have<br />
nevertheless created a different situation in which it makes<br />
sense f or there to be positive responses from Israel.<br />
we talked about the proposals for elections in the<br />
occupied territories and expressed the view that they could<br />
provide a basis I emphasise could provide a basis for<br />
positive developments, but there are qualifications which<br />
attach to that proposal. Those qualifications without being </p>
<p>PM ( cont) z exhaustive go to thle question of who would<br />
participate in those elections does it include<br />
Palestinians living in east Jerusalem, the question of the<br />
withdrawal of forces from at least part of the territories<br />
in the process of taking of that vote, the question of<br />
international supervision of the vote, of course the more<br />
fundamental question of what then is the stage beyond those<br />
elections. So, the proposal could be seen as<br />
providing some basis for a furtherance of the processes of<br />
discussion and resolution. But of course, in themselves,<br />
they are not sufficient.<br />
We referred and discussed the developments in East/ West<br />
relations in general, and of course the more recent<br />
discussions are involving NATO and the positions that they<br />
are adopting. We, to get a of the changed<br />
environment characterises these areas, but recognise while<br />
there should be a positive, constructive approach, caution<br />
needs to be adopted in this area.<br />
we discussed also the Non-Proliferation Treaty. In general,<br />
we need to strengthen the processes of the NPT and we had a<br />
particular discussion of that issue in regard India and<br />
Pakistan, the delicacy of the situation between those two<br />
countries and the desirability of adherence by them to the<br />
NPT.<br />
we also of course discussed developments in Europe and we<br />
were at one. Of course, in expressing a hope that in the<br />
post-1992 situation, that that would an open,<br />
outward-looking development which would be characterised by<br />
the capacity of countries outside Europe to be able to take<br />
advantage of the development of that market of 320 million<br />
people. I am confident that the government of the United<br />
Kingdom will, in its approach on these-matters, adopt that<br />
sort of conceptual idea.<br />
We are agreed also that, in the broader-area international<br />
trading relationships, that we, and all countries, should<br />
intensify their efforts for the remainder of the Uruguay<br />
Round up until the end of next year to try and get an<br />
outcome which not only in regard to agriculture which could<br />
be seen to be a matter of particular interest for Australia<br />
as it is, but not exclusive interests, in regard to<br />
agriculture and other questions of intellectual services and<br />
so on, that there should be an arrival at a position which<br />
is one of a siqnficant freeing up of the international<br />
trading syste.<br />
We had a brief discussion also about developments generally<br />
in the South pacific and also within that overall context I<br />
referred to the initiative that I began in Seoul in general<br />
this year which is concerned with trying to get a closer<br />
form of economic co-operation in that region. </p>
<p>pm ( cant): so i think, ladies and gentlemen, we will see<br />
that it was an extensive discussion covering a wide range of<br />
issues and I conclude as I began by expressing the gratitude<br />
of my Governmen to the very constructive approach that has<br />
been by Mrs Thatcher and her Ministers. We are fully<br />
satisfied with the structure and the nature of the<br />
discussions that we've held. We think they augur well, in<br />
particular in the context of tomorrow's meeting of some 300<br />
businessmen from our two countries, that these discussions,<br />
in totality, augur very well for a signficant improvement in<br />
what is already a good relationship.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think the executions in China<br />
is the start of a mass campaign of executions?<br />
PM: I hope not. One can't speak with any great degree of<br />
optimism because you have these factors to take into<br />
account. one, the massacre of June the 4th and the<br />
that followed. secondly, the campaign of fear, intimidation<br />
and of an attempt to get Chinese citizens to inform on<br />
others which is now characterising its society. Within that<br />
framework and out of the decisions that have been made to<br />
execute these Chinese citizens, one cannot speak on that<br />
evidence with a great degree of optimism. I can only hope<br />
that with the firmness of view which we expressed by the<br />
rest of the world that the Chinese authorities will come to<br />
an understanding that not only is such a course of action<br />
morally reprehensible but in terms of a perception by them<br />
in their self-interest must act in the interests of China.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, would you consider trade<br />
or other further diplomatic sanctions against China?<br />
PM: We would when I say we, it's not just Australia, but<br />
other countries like us, including the United Kingdom. if<br />
there was a significant worsening in the actions of the<br />
Chinese quthorities, then we would all-have to look at that<br />
and make our decisions in the light of it. All I can say is<br />
that, clearly, we understand that there is a difficult<br />
line to walk. We want, as I say, at one and the same time,<br />
to have unequivocally in the mind of the Chinese authorities<br />
the repudiation, the abhorrence that we feel for what<br />
happened and we also don't want to have a situation<br />
where, as a result of our actions, China is going to be<br />
driven even more in upon itself and that the authorities of<br />
China in those circumstances see their only course of action<br />
as one of closing up to the West and pursuing a policy of<br />
toal. repression within their own country. So these are not<br />
going to be easy decisions, but certainly we are not going<br />
to do anything which will give to the Chinese authorities<br />
any impression that there is any condonation of what they<br />
have been doing. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you able to say anything<br />
more now on the speculation of dissidents being harboured in<br />
the Australian Embassy in Peking?<br />
PM: No, l've got no mare to add on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on Hong Kong you said that<br />
Australia's doubled its intake from Hong Kong. Mrs<br />
Thatcher's government, the Foreign office, has said that<br />
Hong Kong residents wanting to take residency in Britain<br />
will either have to be select diplomatic staff or have more<br />
than 150,000 pounds. Did you question her about this?<br />
PM; I'm sorry I didn't get that, she said what?<br />
JOURNALIST: The Foreign Office said that Hong Kong<br />
residents wanting to settle in Britain will be eligible if<br />
they're select diplomatic representatives or if they have<br />
more than 150,000 pounds,. setting a monetary price on<br />
the head of Hong Kong people. Did you ask her about these<br />
issues, about the rate on which they are allowing Hong Kong<br />
people to come to the United Kingdom?<br />
PM: I didn't go to that specific issue. I said that the<br />
question of judgement of policy about intake of those from<br />
Hong Kong who wish to settle in the United Kingdom is, by<br />
definition, a matter for decision by the government of the<br />
united Kingdom. That is a matter for them as it is a matter<br />
for my government as to what policy we ad opt. I have simply<br />
made the point that in this current financial year we have a<br />
doubling of to 800 of people from Hong Kong. We have an<br />
element of our immigration policy which is called a business<br />
migration program and that will continue to be feature of<br />
our policy. We will continue to have discussions and<br />
consultations with the government of the United Kingdom on<br />
this issue. But, in the end, their decisions are a matter<br />
for them.<br />
0 JOURNALIST: But do think that the Hong Kong British should<br />
havea rghtto seodabode, andifteBtshdnto<br />
it, could the Commonwealth?<br />
PM: The nmbers that you're talking about here are in the<br />
order of three and a quarter million people and obviously<br />
the united Kingdom would have enormous difficulty in<br />
accommodating three and a quarter million people. it's no<br />
good denying that obvious fact that they would have<br />
difficulty. The important thing I think we've got to work<br />
upon in to say to the people of Hong Kong and it's not<br />
just the united Kingdom we've all got to say that<br />
we've going to do everything we can to try and create<br />
a situation in terms of decisions and attitudes that<br />
are taken by the government of China that wili, through<br />
time, generate a greater degree of confidence in the </p>
<p>PM ( cont): residents of Hong Kong that they can with<br />
confidence remain in Hong Kong. But I'm not going to adopt<br />
a position where I'm telling the government of the United<br />
Kingdom what the level of immigration is that they have to<br />
take from Hong Kong.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did Mrs Thatcher give you any idea as<br />
of her feelings about Mr Fraser's candidature for the<br />
Secretary-General of the Commonwealth position?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was it?<br />
PM: I think that's not appropriate. There's certain areas<br />
of these discussions which by definition must remain<br />
confidential and I think if Mrs Fra Mrs<br />
there's something that is worrying tie and now wait a<br />
minute Quite seriously, I think that this is a matter<br />
where if Mrs Thatcher has something to say that this<br />
shouldn't be conveyed by me, it should be conveyed by her if<br />
she wants to say something publicly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister,<br />
PM: I can't quite hear you<br />
JOURNALIST: today by Mrs Thatcher, we gather that<br />
Britain push ahead with its intention to, as you say,<br />
ratify, the Antarctic Wilderness Convention<br />
PM: It's not the Antarctic Wilderness Convention.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sorry, the Minerals Convention. we've all<br />
got today<br />
PM: but not as as mine Shut up.<br />
0JOURNALIST: is it your understanding that Britain<br />
will continue to bring pressure to bear on other nations to<br />
follow her lead rather than the lead that you and France<br />
wish to give?<br />
PM: No, she's left me with no such impression. I think<br />
they've made a judgement as to what they think is the<br />
appropriate course of action is for them.<br />
JOURNALIST: But is her proposed course of action to go<br />
beyond the Convention as it now stands anid to try and<br />
strengthen the safeguards within it, as I understand is the<br />
Norwegian position?<br />
PM: No, their process is already wnder way. I think it is<br />
in the House of Lords now as I understand. She said </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: is happy with things as they would be<br />
with the convention ratified?<br />
PM.: Whether she's happy or not, I think it is fair to<br />
her to say that believes that there is a process that's<br />
been undertaken and that, in regard to what has come out<br />
of those processes, there is a specific proposal and she<br />
intends to go ahead and ratify that proposal, which is<br />
obviously her right.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much harder then does it make it for<br />
you to achieve your goal, or the goal that Australia has<br />
set of a Wilderness Park in Antarctica?<br />
PX: obviously it be easier if the United Kingdom were<br />
agreeing with usn, but Mrs Thatcher is exercising her<br />
obvious rights in this regard. I regard it as a matter of<br />
considerable comfort that we have received the support of<br />
two very substantial countries, in India and France. I will<br />
pursue this issue on the rest of this visit with the United<br />
States and with Germany, and I'll carry the issue in<br />
Hungary. I and my Ministers and my officials in all<br />
relevant countries will be very actively pursuing this issue<br />
and I understand we will have the support of a number of<br />
international organisations which have applauded my and I<br />
thank them for it which has applauded the decision that<br />
we've taken.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, today your Treasurer Mr<br />
Hiawke, could you Just clarify a point about Mrs Thatcher's<br />
response on Mr Fraser. I thought she said early in the<br />
press conference that she had given no reply and said later<br />
that she had given some indication.<br />
PM: No, what I've said. I said she did not say to<br />
me yes or no, but as to the nature or inclination on where<br />
she may be going and so on, and the considerations which<br />
were important to her, that is a matter which is fair or<br />
appropriate for me to comment on. That was what I regard a.<br />
a confidential discussion. if she wants to say anything<br />
publicly about the matter I doubt whether she does<br />
it should come from her.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would Mr Fraser get the job without her<br />
support? PM: I beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Could Mr Fraser get the job without her<br />
support? </p>
<p>PM: I suppose that's I think that what will happen<br />
in this matter is that at some stage before the CROCG4<br />
meeting in October, that it will become clear that one of<br />
the two candidates has a clear majority and in those<br />
circumstances the other will withdraw. I donet think<br />
anyone would want a situation where, if there were such a<br />
clear majority decision, that it then be battled on right<br />
up to and into the CHOGM meeting.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke is it fair to say that in your<br />
estimation that Mrs Thatcher feels deeply about mr<br />
Fraser's candidature?<br />
PM: I think that I can say this, that I think Mrs<br />
Thatcher is adopting a responsible approach to it and I hope<br />
that that doesn't sound condescending. She has feelings<br />
about both candidates, I think she is trying to work<br />
through to a decision as to what she thinks would be the in<br />
the best interests of the Commonwealth.<br />
JOURNALIST: the harsh things that you've said about<br />
Mr Fraser over the years you once said, for example,<br />
that he was the man of cutlery of Australian politics, born<br />
with a silver spoon in his mouth and all his time<br />
stabbing people in the back. Are you totally comfortable,<br />
as Malcolm Fraser's lobbyist, and what exactly<br />
PM: z campaign manager as I've been described as.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what exactly is your selling pitch when you<br />
deal with someone like Kra Thatcher?<br />
PM: In answer to that question, which I'm quite prepared<br />
to, I can do it because anything I've said on this issue<br />
with Mrs Thatcher is something that I'm on the record about<br />
anyway. my position of course is well-known, that I<br />
don't think that Mr Fraser is the-: perfect human being.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Now wait a minute. It's not as simple as that<br />
But I think that what we've got to look at in this issue is,<br />
what is the position that he's seeking to fill, what<br />
qualifications does he bring to it. Now# an yoU've heard me<br />
say in the Australian Parliament and elsewhere on the public<br />
record, Mr Fraser's record on the question of race and<br />
colour is impeccable. He has, therefore, a moral basis, I<br />
believe, which justifies his candidature. I believe that he<br />
has a capacity to talk to with not only Commonwealth<br />
countries but with other countries In the world<br />
whose decisions will be relevant to the resolution<br />
of the position in Southern Africa. But let anthis and<br />
I think this is important for everyone to take ito account </p>
<p>P14 ( cant): who has to make a decision within the<br />
Commonwealth the Commonwealth is not a single issue<br />
entity. of course it is the case that South Africa has a<br />
great importance and will continue to have until the matter<br />
is resolved. There are many other issues Of importance for<br />
the Commonwealth and throughout his public career, both as<br />
Prime Minister and since, Mr Fraser has indicated as I<br />
acknowledge a concern with these issues. For instance, as<br />
you know, he's is currently acting as chairman of an<br />
group which is concerned with commodity-. trade, in particular<br />
as it affects African countries. So he has a range of<br />
experience and commitment, and contacts which I believe<br />
would serve the Commonwealth well. But that's the sort of<br />
considerations which I think are important in supporting the<br />
candidature of Mr Fraser. I repea as I've said before<br />
none of those things are meant to imply any criticism of the<br />
candidature of Mr think it is one<br />
of those fortunate positions where the Commonwealth has two<br />
very good candidates.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, today your Treasurer....<br />
PM: I will come to local matters in a moment. Is<br />
there any further matters before we go to Australia?<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you discuss South Africa with Mrs Thatcher?<br />
PM: Yes, we did have some discussion about that within<br />
the context of talking about not only the candidature of<br />
Secretary-General, but more generally we did some discussion<br />
about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much common ground is there between you and<br />
Mrs Thatcher on South Africa in the light of the fact that<br />
Mr De Kierk is coming here later in the week?<br />
PM: He'll be here on Friday. I think he's already here for<br />
a government meeting on Friday. I think this is the area of<br />
common ground that we share an abhorrence of apartheid as<br />
a philosophy and as it is practiced. * We have that como<br />
ground. Where we have our differences is in the strategy of<br />
trying to combat that and I don't think there's anything<br />
more I can usefully add to that obeiervation, that fairly<br />
states our position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, while you were discussing<br />
matters of the environment with Mrs Thatcher, was she able<br />
to give you the British position on when they might accept<br />
their responsibilities in cleaning the nuclear testing<br />
sights in South Australia, Maralinga particularly? </p>
<p>12.<br />
PM: The position there is that we are still engaged in a<br />
joint exercise of officials and people with relevant<br />
qualifications as to an assessment of the facts what needs<br />
to be done. When those assessments are reached, then that's<br />
the time for negotiation and so, because those Processes are<br />
going on, there's no point in particularly going to that<br />
issue.<br />
JOURNALISTr: Mr Hawke, do you think the-Commonwealth<br />
conference will be dominated by South Africa an the last two<br />
conferences were? or are you making an attempt to vary the<br />
menu a bit?<br />
PM: Obviously South Africa will be an important issue and<br />
the Commonwealth can't meet without South Africa being an<br />
important issue. But I have the hope that it will in no<br />
sense be an exclusive or totally dominating issue because<br />
there are many other issues of importance and two, in<br />
particular, I think will need to be very such on the agenda.<br />
one of course is the question of international trade because<br />
for the member countries of the Commonwealth, liberalization<br />
of international trading systems in of fundamental<br />
importance. And secondly, the question of the environment.<br />
I think those two issues need to be very much on the<br />
Commonwealth agenda as probably does the question of the<br />
actual organisation of the Commkonwealth affairs the<br />
mechanics of the and so on. I think we need to have<br />
a look to see whether now at the end of the 1980a we're as<br />
well organised as we might be on questions of internal<br />
housekeeping as it were. Now those issues are all important<br />
and 3I trust will be part of a fairly comprehensive agenda.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, about the question of<br />
Secretary-General again...<br />
PM: it does fascinate you all doesn't it?<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Mrs Thatcher make it clear that she has not<br />
got much enthusiasm for either candidate? That's one point,<br />
and secondly, on your meeting with Mr Do KiLerk,, what is your<br />
view on his idea of the great or, putting this<br />
another way<br />
PH: I'm not meeting with Mr<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm sorry I thought you said you were<br />
going to have a meeting with Mr Do Klerk.<br />
Pm: No# I said Mrs I haven't got to that stage.<br />
JOURENALIST: what is your view on this issue? </p>
<p>PM: In answer to your first question, thatos one you should<br />
address to Mrs Thatcher.<br />
JOURNALIST: France,-on the one hand, be prepared<br />
to sign the minerals Convention and, on the other,....<br />
PM: She didn't say much more to me on that than in<br />
private or in our impromptu press conference in Downing<br />
Street. 7<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, back on China, now that the<br />
executions have begun, don't you think it is tims the west<br />
started to threaten in their serious sactions and don't you<br />
think there are sane sort of non-trade sanctions you could<br />
use such as banning flights to Australia or something like<br />
that? PM: I go back to the answer I gave before, but I'll add to<br />
it. But I go back to the fundamental point that I made, and<br />
that is that we do have a difficult line to walk between<br />
doing and saying those things which are going to make clear<br />
our unequivocal condemnation of the actions. On the other<br />
hand,' making decisions which are going to be in the<br />
interests in China, in distinct from its current leadership.<br />
And I've said, what I think is obviously true, that that is<br />
a dif ficult line to walk and it is right, as in implicit in<br />
your question, that the more evidence we got of brutality of<br />
execution of the total ignoring of fundmental human rights,<br />
the more difficult it is with any sense of confidence, to<br />
walk that line. But, simply, in these circumstances where<br />
there is still a degree of fluidity as to outcome, to just<br />
say yes we'll make a whole range of decisions which is going<br />
to close China of ff is not something which is necessarily in<br />
the interests of the people that we want to help. I concede<br />
straight away that that is going to require difficult<br />
decisions but I hope it will be apparent that in my own<br />
0 case, and Ilox sure in the case of Mrs Thatcher and others,<br />
that we will desperately try and make the right decision.<br />
Let me make this point. That as far as my country and my<br />
government is concerned, there will be no decisions based<br />
upon expediency.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on Vietnam<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: How optimistic are you about the Vietnamese<br />
accepting refugees who are sent back against their will and<br />
is 1-hprp nny pagnribility of Your 90vernMet aareeinq to<br />
resume nid to Victnam baf-are thy uzn4 of Sopt~ mbez?<br />
13. </p>
<p>14<br />
PK: On the first question, I think Vietnam has come'to<br />
understand that they have to accept the view of the rest of<br />
the world that we are now dealing with a different<br />
situation, that it's not one of political refugees but<br />
economic refugees, and that the rest of the world is simply<br />
not going to accept the flight of. people, in the sense of<br />
particularly from North Vietnamese, as particularly in<br />
regard to Hong Kong, who simply made a-decision that they<br />
don't like the economic regime and are seeking a more<br />
congenial economic environment and that the government of<br />
Vietnam has; to accept that fact and it has to move to a<br />
situation where, as people return, and that they participate<br />
in an acceptable orderly departure program which is<br />
consistent normal immigration flows. As to the question of<br />
aid, we won't be meeting in any signficant way before the<br />
time we mentioned. What we've made quite clear, in respect<br />
of contact with Vietnam as far as, may I say, of ASEAN<br />
countries and others that one of the outcomes that we hope<br />
to see from the resolution of the Cambodian tragedy is a<br />
preparedness on the part of Vietnam to open itself up.<br />
There is evidence that that is what Vietnam wants to do, and<br />
it's my firm position in judgement that, if Vietnam adheres<br />
to its commitment to withdraw its troops from Vietnam as I<br />
say, adheres to it go back, but if adheres to that<br />
and take a positive role in trying to secure a final<br />
settlement of the Cambodian problem, and itself then seeks<br />
to have a greater degree of involvement with the rest of the<br />
world, then it is in the interests of Australia and of other<br />
countries to respond positively to that, and we'll prepared<br />
to. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Sure. Is there any<br />
JOUJRNALIST: Yes.* Mr Hawke, on the question of Souith<br />
Africa, was there any mention of the. possible release of<br />
Nelson 14andela as part of the deal to get the South African<br />
government and the ANC to talk to each other?<br />
PM: No there was no allusion to that.<br />
JOURWALIST: Still on South Africa. At this meeting<br />
have your differences with Mrs Thatcher narrowed at all<br />
and how long did you spend talking about South Africa?<br />
PM: We spent quite a deal of time talking about it. I<br />
think its fair to say that Mrs Thatcher has a view that the<br />
npw landerahiD in South Africa will be more responsive to<br />
the prqcesmes of persuasion. I hope that's true. I believe<br />
LJ.. aL wl). L web nood to noo. there io action, and not just<br />
words. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Did your differences narrow at all this time?<br />
Pm: I don't think that the discussion went to the point<br />
where I could draw that conclusion. itts a matter that we<br />
will have to take up further in the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government context.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did she then seek to persuade you that it would<br />
be good a moment to lessen the pressure to give De<br />
Klerk a chance and if so how did you respond?<br />
PM: She made it clear that she sought, as I said in answer<br />
to the previous question, that there was something of a new<br />
and more promising environment. I hope that's true,, but I<br />
repeat, unless there is action then that is not sufficient.<br />
Unless there is action that they are moving towards a more<br />
acceptable position, then that's the context within which we<br />
and the Commonwealth have to consider what our position is.<br />

<p>W-b-<br />
JOURNALIST: On domstic issues Did you know the Treasur,..<br />
from the argument of a luxury tax on a question of tax rellef for<br />
savings, which suggests that your pledge tat these matters along<br />
with other would be given caeful, consideration is not all tha fair<br />
dinkum, at least as far Mr Keating is Concerned. What<br />
PM: You're in the unfortunate position, my dear Wrend, that I<br />
have the transcript and as is so often the cas you put a slant<br />
which in't accurate. Lets look at what he said as distinct from<br />
your slou on it. " Well look, the whole question of about luxury<br />
good taxe on simple lines is simply a matter of tast, and the<br />
relevant phrase. I couldn't put it better myself. Now it is an issue<br />
as the Prim Miniswe has said very much in the public debate and<br />
wW'l have a took at it". Now, rve had the opportunity of seeing<br />
the Treasum'es speech and his answers to questions. I simply<br />
want to make this fairly brief statement which I hope will be an<br />
end to the maflor and that we will have an end to glosses and a<br />
consideration of facts is always useful. rve been away fr-om.<br />
Austraia, now for almost six days, it is appropriateC that in the fihst<br />
peidwhen we had the balance of payments question coming up<br />
that rd be prepared to recognise within the context of that<br />
economic problem the appropriateness to make certain comments.<br />
Now, I jut want to make it clar to you that I don't propose for<br />
the next I1I days of this visit to comment on every domestic issue<br />
that may come along. I do want to say this about Paul's speech<br />
and his answers. Firstly, I thought it was an excellent speech<br />
which set out the Oconomic situation very clearly, the position,<br />
how ever much you may try and create an impression to the<br />
contrary, the impression is that Paul Keating and I are in<br />
agreement On ecnoMmia policy. There's no differmne between us<br />
and we had a long discussion on economic policy before I left and<br />
beyond saying tha I am not going to conduct a detailed<br />
exainaionhere on the other side of the world on issues that will<br />
probably to anything when I have returned to Australia, but I<br />
have emphasised as far as the; speech by Paul i concered I think<br />
it was an excellent speech and I agree with it and we are as<br />
indicated thai he is that if the issues are in the public demand<br />
they wil be zamdned and I agre with him instinctly if I may say<br />
so, in rep* a to this issue that tho public are about, it is<br />
possible for an increase in taxes In relation to goods no one </p>
<p>personally including myself that ( inaudible) fundamental<br />
answers to problem facing the Australan community about, that<br />
is is one in which we have demands at a rate of 11% increase<br />
and supply of about now that's the essence of the problem and<br />
this paricular proposal is not going<br />
JOURNALISTr. W Hawke, is it still your views that Australian<br />
living standards will be maintained for this -yea and improve for<br />
next year?<br />
PM: Im gogto apatowhat Ijustsaid, I havesaid au rm<br />
going to say about the domestic, political and economic issues. I<br />
have prepared for the first couple of days ( inaudible) As far as rm.<br />
concerned this is the time I ( inaudible) as much as i'm going to<br />
and when I got back to Australi I am going to get right in to all<br />
these economic issues together with Paul and we'll make the<br />
decisions that are necessary to protect the Australian economy.<br />
i'm not going to on the other side of the world to go on with..<br />
issues. JOURNALIST: So you take that attitude because Mr Keating has<br />
expresed ( inaudible)<br />
PhE No, Mr Keating's o<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: The position I've been putting is very simple and r've read<br />
the spech and his responses and I find myself in agreement..<br />
particularly in regards to ( inaudible) and the decision as always in<br />
this manner predominantly reflect the outcome of the<br />
discussions between the Treasurer and the Prime Minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) living standards across the board?<br />
pm God try Laurie. rve saidallrm goingto say.<br />
pM: what lesios ane you atakn back to Autala from Mrs<br />
Thatchges handling of one. the economy hern ad two, Industrial<br />
relaions here, particularly In light of the massive swing against<br />
her at fte wecktud In the European elections?<br />
pM: We havent come hems, nor rmn going to the other countries to<br />
larn about the economic management. We do that better than<br />
anyone ese and on the question of industrial relations In<br />
partcula, all I can say is that as a result of out conduct of </p>
<p>industrial relations we've had a 59% percent reduction in<br />
industrial disputes, almost 10% reduction in real unit labour costs.<br />
We think we handle that area very wall indeed.<br />
JOURNALIST; Mr Hawks, can you toil us why your taking this<br />
decision not to comment on domestic issues while you ane<br />
overseas? PM; rye told you why. I &amp; aid that it seemed to me at the<br />
beginning particularly in the context while we're waiting for the<br />
balance of payments consideration that I knew that that was very<br />
much in people's minds a3 appropriate to make some observations<br />
in regard to that, but I just have my priorties very clearly worked<br />
out, that is with that behind us what we're about on this visit is<br />
the pursuit of Australias interests in a whole range of areas.<br />
That's what rm going to concentrate ent and I've no Intention of<br />
deviating from that. You know that when I'm back in Australia<br />
you have ample opportunity of discussing those matters with me.<br />
I know that's disappointing to you. but that's what the position is<br />
going to be.<br />
JOURNALIST: On a lighter note, what do you reckon on England's<br />
chances in tomorrow's Teat?<br />
PM: Iz this put in terms of n~ egotiating a wager or academic<br />
analysis? I have said to others before, I repeat it for your benefit<br />
before the encounters began I sent a cable to Alan Border, rm not<br />
in a position of sending him instructions, but I sent a cable to him<br />
which tend this, " good luck in the first Test, I expect to see you at<br />
Lord's one up". Now he has done excellently, I wish all my quasi-<br />
Instructions were so faithfully carried through and he's done very<br />
wall. I expect an the evidence both of the pefor c of his<br />
players and the quality of his captaincy and the nat= r Of the<br />
opposition, I have no'reason to expect that the result which has<br />
emerged from the first encounter will not continue to emerge in<br />
the subsequent, ones. You may pick up one Test but you have no<br />
chance of winning the series.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mrt Hawke,<br />
PM:-OK, ths is just about the last one.<br />
JOURNALIST: Should Australia. play a leg spinner at Lords?<br />
pm: should wesplaya leg spinner at Lords. have we got onebin the<br />
sad.. 1' rma Hohnes. well rm not right up to date with how he's<br />
1464P </p>
<p>been performing. We Sot away in the first Test without a spinner,<br />
but I think it's one of those circumstances where in this country of<br />
variegated conditions there may be some circumstances in which<br />
the inclusion of a spinner off or leg, may be appropriate. I have<br />
such great confidence in the way that they have conducted<br />
themselves to this point that I am sure they will make the right<br />
decision. Thank you.<br />
