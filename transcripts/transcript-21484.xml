I am pleased to announce today that the Australian Government will provide a further $748,000 (including GST) from the Regional Partnerships programme to enable completion of the Tumbi Creek dredging project.  This follows the earlier contribution announced by the Member for Dobell, Ken Ticehurst, which now brings the Australian Government's total contribution to this project to $1.5 million.</p>
<p>This funding will enable the completion of the dredging of Tumbi Creek, and will cover landfill fees and road construction to ensure the dredged material is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.</p>
<p>The community deserves a lake in which it can swim and fish.  Completion of the dredging project will also reduce the prospect of residences being flooded at the mouth of the creek.</p>
<p>Ken Ticehurst has committed himself to this project and has fought hard to secure funding from the Federal Government in the absence of a commitment from the state government.</p>
<p>I congratulate Ken and all those who have fought for a better environmental outcome for their community.</p>
