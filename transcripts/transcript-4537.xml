PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 9 NOVEN3ER 1977<br />
LORD 1dAYOR'S DINNER. IMIELBOURNET,<br />
I am delighted to be here in Melbourne this evening. I am<br />
afraid Melbourne is going to have to put up with Fraser and<br />
a few more of his speeches over the next few weeks. You<br />
have probably heard that there is some strange event, something<br />
we call " the campaign" in the air. This is a sort of political<br />
Moomba where politicians all get together and have fun. My<br />
Lord Mayor, we don't fight these events with the same style and<br />
gusto of candidates who seek your office. It is just a nice,<br />
gentle, three weeks.<br />
Tamie and I both share delight in the fact that women are here<br />
tonight not as a privilege but as a right. Lord Mayor and<br />
Councillors, you are to be congratulated for making a move,<br />
which dare I say it is long overdue.<br />
The campaign is officially a little way off, so I will not worry<br />
you with talk of implicit deflators, VDRs, 143s and underlying<br />
trends* I want instead to speak for a few minutes about Australia about<br />
the opportunities that we can grasp.<br />
At this banquet, last year, I spoke about the challenges facing<br />
Australia the challenges arising from economic difficulty and<br />
inevitable social change. There is no doubt in my mind that we<br />
are responding as a nation to that challenge. Wfe have all come<br />
to accept that our country's resources are limited.<br />
Vie cannot just keep printing money without huge costs to the<br />
nation and to families everywhere.. The Government has spoken<br />
often about what economists call " reigning in the public sector"<br />
and " transferring resources to the private sector". I know this<br />
is dreadful jargon but I think the point behind the jargon is<br />
getting across. We talked about these issues and -took actionbecause<br />
as a national Government we had no alternative. We had<br />
been faced with difficult decisions, particularly in the complex<br />
area of the economy.<br />
We faced up to them even if many of our decisions were regarded<br />
by the scribes as unhelpful to what they call the Government's<br />
" image"<br />
Looking back, there is no doubt that those tough decisions were<br />
in the interests of all Australians. They had to be made. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I have never sought to head a Government or a Party that was<br />
not prepared to take decisions necessary for the good government<br />
of Australia. With the requests that come to Government and<br />
the resources available to Government, there are more occasions to I<br />
on which a Government must responsibly say " no" than say yes<br />
People sometimes suggest that this is a handicap. They fear<br />
and expect an adverse reaction from the community.<br />
I think that is a very odd view to take because I have complete<br />
confidence in the good judgement and common sense of Australians.<br />
They know what is possible. They know what is in the national<br />
interest. They have infinitely greater capacity for sound<br />
judgement than many people in the public arena care to admit.<br />
With those decisions made, we can achieve our nation's potential,<br />
we can achieve our nation's vast promise.<br />
In Government the coalition that I lead has clearly defined<br />
objectives for Australia. Can I put it this way. Government<br />
is about people. Nations have no life but the life of their<br />
people. I believe our national objective must be to enhance<br />
the position of the individual. It must be to maximise a person's<br />
capacity for making his or her own decisions.<br />
There has been a tendency for Governments, because they have<br />
ready access to financial resources or printing presses, to<br />
suggest that all problems can be solvedi by spending money.<br />
Such a Government encourages the worst in society. It creates<br />
a selfish community.<br />
It is necessary to understand that politicians have nothing<br />
of their own to give when they make promises they are promising<br />
something of yours: something that must be taken away from you<br />
as a taxpayer and citizen. Clearly, individuals want there to<br />
be a limit to the promises politicians make.<br />
In the next couple of years, I believe Australia can become an<br />
example to the world. We can show the world how a resolute<br />
spirit and determination and team work can overcome extreme<br />
economic problems. We can show the world how people fromn all<br />
walks of life all colours, all creeds can inspire one<br />
another to high achievement. We can show the world how a<br />
concerned and caring community itself can enter the lives of<br />
those people in need and al~ d dignity and hope where previouoly<br />
there was none. We can show the world that we can play a leadinE<br />
part in the developing of a safer world; of a less selfish world;<br />
of a world that learns to use its natural resources as a force<br />
for good and not for evil.<br />
We can do this. It is within our grasp.<br />
I have no doubt of the ability or willingness of our people<br />
to play this role. We have an educated, aware, and intelligent<br />
youth. We have a migrant population that is lifting our sights,<br />
widening our horizons and expanding our appreciation of what life<br />
can offer. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
We have a nation of articulate, concerned and forward-thinking<br />
women who will play a key part in our maturing as a nation.<br />
We have energy, imagination, resources, inventiveness and<br />
above all, we have a growing realisation that we are part of<br />
a wider world community.<br />
We are facing up to our obligations to our near neighbours in<br />
Asia and the Pacific, and our responsibilities to our friends<br />
around the globe. What Australia says and does is important<br />
in world forums.<br />
My Lord Mayor, powerful forces are at work for Australia.<br />
They are forces for good for achievement, for prosperity.<br />
They are forces that will take Australia into the eighties and<br />
beyond with a real hope and confidence, and a real sense of<br />
belonging to a nation that has become an example to the world. </p>
