<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  Yesterday Prime Minister John Howard delivered his first major speech</p>
<p>   of this year, his Federation Address in Adelaide, in which he discussed</p>
<p>   an expanded work for the dole scheme, tax reform and the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. But the focus in national affairs has shifted somewhat</p>
<p>   overnight after rowdy scenes in Melbourne's dockland as a non-union</p>
<p>   alternative was being set up, backed by the National Farmers Federation.</p>
<p>   And later in the programme we will speak with Maritime Union leader,</p>
<p>   John Coombs. Now though the Prime Minister joins us from our studios</p>
<p>   in Adelaide, Prime Minister good morning to you.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Hello Steve, good morning.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  In your Federation Address yesterday you said, among other things,</p>
<p>   that Australia has to accelerate the pace of economic reform, including</p>
<p>   waterfront reform and this morning we are hearing about waterfront</p>
<p>   war as the National Farmers Federation moves into a new dock venture.</p>
<p>   Is this the sort of reform on the waterfront you were talking about?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well Steve, the only people who are talking war and speaking belligerently</p>
<p>   are the wharfies. All the NFF is doing is going into business, going</p>
<p>   into the stevedoring business, they are taking advantage of the</p>
<p>   new laws that my Government passed. And we have never disguised,</p>
<p>   and I want to make this very clear to the Australian people, we</p>
<p>   have never disguised the fact that we need reform in the Australian</p>
<p>   waterfront. The Australian waterfront is hopelessly inefficient</p>
<p>   by world standards. We need it to be more productive and that will</p>
<p>   benefit Australia, it will build a stronger Australia, if we have</p>
<p>   a more efficient waterfront. And all we have done is to change the</p>
<p>   law to break the legal monopoly on the supply of labour on the Australian</p>
<p>   waterfront. And if companies owned by the NFF or indeed anybody</p>
<p>   else take advantage of that and provide competition, good on them.</p>
<p>   Because it is in the Australian national interest, I repeat, the</p>
<p>   Australian national interest, that we have the most competitive</p>
<p>   wharves in the world and that we encourage the maximum degree of</p>
<p>   competition.</p>
<p>  We have never disguised our support for that. I mean, this idea</p>
<p>   that there is some kind of conspiracy and there is something sinister</p>
<p>   about the Government wanting more productive Australian wharves</p>
<p>   that is bunkum. I have never disguised that. I am proud of the fact</p>
<p>   that my Government is in favour of more productive wharves and the</p>
<p>   only people who are talking trouble, the only people who are talking</p>
<p>   confrontation, the only people who are behaving like bullies are</p>
<p>   the MUA. We are not, all we have done is to change the law and to</p>
<p>   say that it is lawful for somebody to use non-union labour on the</p>
<p>   Australian waterfront.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  Well now the MUA is threatening this morning a massive industrial</p>
<p>   campaign, the ACTU is backing it, will your Government do everything</p>
<p>   in it's power to keep the Australian waterfront open?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We will support the law of this country, the Government can do no</p>
<p>   less and ought to do no less. And people who are lawfully going</p>
<p>   about their business, whatever that business may be, are entitled</p>
<p>   to the support of the law. And those who seek to use intimidatory</p>
<p>   tactics. I mean nobody is trying to smash the MUA, nobody is trying</p>
<p>   to destroy any jobs, what we are trying to do is get a more productive</p>
<p>   waterfront, what we are trying to do is to build a stronger Australia.</p>
<p>   Heavens above, after what has happened in our near north and the</p>
<p>   economic turmoil in South East Asia surely every Australian understands</p>
<p>   that we have got to have the most productive, the most efficient</p>
<p>   and the most competitive economy we can possibly achieve. And you</p>
<p>   won't achieve that unless you allow people in open competition</p>
<p>   in all areas of the economy.</p>
<p>  And I say to the members of the MUA, we have no argument with you,</p>
<p>   we are not trying to smash your union all we have done is to change</p>
<p>   the law to allow people to recruit and use non-union labour on the</p>
<p>   waterfront, and for new stevedores to come into the business and</p>
<p>   to operate in competition with existing ones. And as far as I am</p>
<p>   concerned while anybody, whether it be the NFF or any other organisation</p>
<p>   or group of Australians wants to do that they will have the full</p>
<p>   support and understanding of my Government. And I would hope they</p>
<p>   would have the full support and the understanding of the Australian</p>
<p>   Labor Party. It is very interesting, is Kim Beazley going to allow</p>
<p>   Mr Coombs to lead him by the nose on this or is he going to stand</p>
<p>   up for the Australian national interest?</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  Alright. Prime Minister you began the New Year with a trip to Perth</p>
<p>   and you announced an $80 million grant to Western Australian infrastructure</p>
<p>   projects. Yesterday in Adelaide the Federation Address, you announced</p>
<p>   an extra $340 million to extend government training programmes,</p>
<p>   an extra $42 million to assist students to stay at school or go</p>
<p>   back. You announced a tightening of your work for the dole scheme,</p>
<p>   and you talked again of a better, fairer tax system. Let me ask</p>
<p>   you a wasted question, because it seems to me you are setting the</p>
<p>   stage for an election, are you now in full election mode, are you</p>
<p>   thinking of an early poll?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No. I am getting on with the business of being Prime Minister. What</p>
<p>   I did yesterday was to lay out my plans for the next year. And those</p>
<p>   plans include making Australia an even stronger economy and further</p>
<p>   insulating it against the ravages of what is happening in our region.</p>
<p>   That plan includes a fairer and better more modern taxation system.</p>
<p>   Those plans include an extension of the mutual obligation principle</p>
<p>   and it is a very important principle of a civilised society. We</p>
<p>   will look after people who need help, but where it is reasonable</p>
<p>   to do so we will say to those people, in return for that help you</p>
<p>   should give something back to society. And that is the principle,</p>
<p>   the mutual obligation principle which lies behind our work for the</p>
<p>   dole approach.</p>
<p>  But we have gone further. We have said to those people who leave</p>
<p>   school without adequate literacy and numeracy skills that that is</p>
<p>   one of the reasons why often you can't get a job and if you</p>
<p>   are assessed as having those inadequate skills, after you have failed</p>
<p>   to get a job for six months, we will provide you with professional</p>
<p>   help to lift your numeracy and literacy skills. And we are going</p>
<p>   to pay for that and we are going to work in partnership with the</p>
<p>   State Governments to do so.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  But Prime Minister can I suggest to you, you have got a bit of a</p>
<p>   problem here, what with all this early election speculation, perhaps</p>
<p>   a double dissolution poll, media driven or driven by Ministers or</p>
<p>   both. Because it gets to a point where it begins to gather its own</p>
<p>   momentum and you can't stop it and you have all this political</p>
<p>   uncertainty which could force you to go to an early poll just to</p>
<p>   end all of that.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well Steve, the next election will be held at the right time. And</p>
<p>   we are a long way away from it. It is normal in Australia in the</p>
<p>   12 months before an election is due for speculation to start. Now</p>
<p>   it has been heightened on this occasion because of the stubborn</p>
<p>   refusal of the Senate to pass our Native Title Amendment Bill. And</p>
<p>   I would say to those people, including people in the Labor Party</p>
<p>   and the Democrats who everyday criticise the fact that there is</p>
<p>   election speculation, if they let the Native Title Bill through</p>
<p>   in March a lot of that would disappear overnight.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  In your address yesterday, and indeed it was mentioned by your Treasurer</p>
<p>   Peter Costello yesterday, the good economic numbers just keep coming,</p>
<p>   reflected as recently as yesterday with the lower inflation figures.</p>
<p>   But why isn't all this being translated into good numbers for</p>
<p>   you and your Government in the opinion polls?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the good numbers electorally Steve, are those that are delivered</p>
<p>   on election day. And polls come and go but I think the message is</p>
<p>   getting through even more strongly to the Australian people, that</p>
<p>   if it hadn't been for the action taken by my Government to</p>
<p>   fix up Mr Beazley's $10.5 billion deficit that he left us and</p>
<p>   denied, if it hadn't been for our action in repairing the economy</p>
<p>   we would now be a more frightened, vulnerable, weakened country</p>
<p>   in the face of what has happened in the Asia-Pacific region. And</p>
<p>   because of what we have done Australia stands as strong in this</p>
<p>   part of the world, indeed stronger than it has ever stood in the</p>
<p>   past. And I am immensely proud of the decisions that I, in company</p>
<p>   with my Treasurer in particular, have taken at the Head of the Government</p>
<p>   to waterproof the Australian economy against those impacts.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  You also said yesterday in that speech that under your Government</p>
<p>   we had become a more civil society with a stronger sense of community</p>
<p>   and a more united nation. And I wonder whether you really believe</p>
<p>   that when you look at the monarchy vs the republic debate, the impact</p>
<p>   Pauline Hanson has had, the Wik debate, the growing gap between</p>
<p>   rich and poor, do you think we really are a more civil, united society?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think given the immensity of some of those issues the debate</p>
<p>   is being, by and large, conducted in a fairly civil fashion. I mean,</p>
<p>   there are outbursts when people fling around descriptions like racist</p>
<p>   scum and so forth, but they are the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>   And I think some of the abuse has disappeared from the political</p>
<p>   stage, I am not suggesting for a moment that we should become colourlessly</p>
<p>   polite in all of our</p>
<p>  exchanges, but I do think it is possible to debate these issues</p>
<p>   without us lapsing into too much lack of civility. And I think the</p>
<p>   other point I made in that same context was that, I don't think</p>
<p>   Australian politics is as dominated now as it was a couple of years</p>
<p>   ago before my Government came to power, by noisy pressure groups.</p>
<p>   We are governing far more in the interests of the mainstream of</p>
<p>   the Australian community.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  Earlier this week you condemned Pauline Hanson's comments on</p>
<p>   the choice of the Australian and the Young Australian of the Year</p>
<p>   and former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser is now saying it is becoming</p>
<p>   harder for the Liberals to give Pauline Hanson their preferences</p>
<p>   at the next election. Why won't you end all that speculation</p>
<p>   now and simply say it is not on, she, The One Nation Party, are</p>
<p>   not going to get our preferences?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well that will be dealt with by the organisations.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  But you could show some form of leadership here.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well Steve I have shown a lot of leadership on just about every</p>
<p>   issue that is around at the present time. Take the Constitutional</p>
<p>   Convention. The weather-vane that is represented by the Leader of</p>
<p>   the Opposition is just because he has read the opinion poll that</p>
<p>   says a lot of people support a directly elected presidency he has</p>
<p>   shifted his position. As far as I am concerned on all of those issues</p>
<p>   I am stating my own views, the Australian people know where I stand.</p>
<p>   And even though on that issue I may be articulating what, according</p>
<p>   to the opinion polls is a minority view, I am going to go on doing</p>
<p>   it. Now that is, I think, doing the sort of thing that any political</p>
<p>   party leader with a decent backbone would be willing to do.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  Just finally, while all this goes on and we talk about these issues</p>
<p>   some 9,000 people in Katherine are rebuilding their lives after</p>
<p>   those devastating floods, they are going to need all the help they</p>
<p>   can get, are you going to give it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I certainly am. And indeed on Friday, tomorrow, my wife and I will</p>
<p>   be going to Katherine to meet and to talk to the people who have</p>
<p>   been left devastated by those floods. I have been in constant contact</p>
<p>   with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory over the last</p>
<p>   36 hours and I have assured him that all of the resources of the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth which are properly needed in these circumstances will</p>
<p>   be available. It is a major natural disaster and it is an immense</p>
<p>   human trauma for all of those Australians who have been affected</p>
<p>   by it. And Janette and I will be going to Katherine tomorrow morning</p>
<p>   to talk to them and to personally express to them our concern and</p>
<p>   the concern of their fellow Australians.</p>
<p>  LEIBMANN:</p>
<p>  Ok, thanks for your time, good to talk with you again.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
