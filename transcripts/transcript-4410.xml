PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR: PRESS 24 MAY 1977<br />
NATIONAL WAGE CASE<br />
The announcement today by the Full Bench of the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission in the national wage case marks<br />
the end of the incomes and prices pause.<br />
The pause which had the support of the seven Heads of Government<br />
in Australia seemed to offer a unique opportunity to break<br />
the incomes prices spiral and thus slow down inflation.<br />
Employer bodies gave substantial cooperation with the result<br />
that a prices pause has effectively been in place since 13 April.<br />
This was recognised in today's decision from the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission.<br />
In ' his judgemen t today, the President of the Commission,<br />
Sir Johiif Moore said: are-satisfied with-theprices<br />
for a wide range of goods and services have been held stable<br />
since the 13 April agreement of the Heads of Government<br />
on a voluntary wage-price pause. In particular, those subject<br />
to surveillance by the Prices Justification Tribunal, covering<br />
some 3449 companies, and those under the authority of Commonwealth,<br />
state and local governments, have held back price increases and will<br />
continue to do so. And we have no reason doubt that for the<br />
present, many prices beyond those covered by the above have been<br />
frozen pending our decision."<br />
In a supplementary statement the Public Service Arbitrator,<br />
Mr Taylor, was even more emphcatic. He said: am satisfied<br />
that since 14 April, 1977, i. e. since the call of the seven<br />
Heads of Government for a three mo nth wage-price pause, there has </p>
<p>been a substantial holding of prices. I am aware that the<br />
agreement sought by the seven Heads of Government has<br />
not eventuated, in the main because of the refusal of the<br />
unions to accept a wage pause, but nevertheless the announcement<br />
acted as a catalyst to spark off-* an immediate price pause and<br />
it is significant that the pause commenced shortly after the<br />
awarding by the Commission of the last national wage increase<br />
of $ 5.70 per week to all wage and salary earners."<br />
Regrettably trade union leaders refused to cooperate, even<br />
in principle, in the initiative which the Heads of Government<br />
took and which the price setters supported.<br />
The State Labor governments progressively undermined the initiative<br />
until finally the Premier of South Australia formally<br />
withdrew from the agreement. The State Labor governments<br />
refused to participate with the Commonwealth in a joint approach<br />
to the Commission. They opposed the implementation of a wage<br />
pause at-thenational wage case hearing, until Mr Dunstan<br />
in an eleventh-hour effort to influence the Commission,<br />
broke his agreement with the other Heads of Government.<br />
The increase granted by the Commission only six weeks after the<br />
$ 5.70 increase in the wages awarded in the previous national<br />
wage case means it would be unreasonable to expect employers<br />
to go on holding prices at this time. In these circumstances,<br />
we shall be advising the other parties to the Heads of Government<br />
agreement that we consider the pause should be formally terminated.<br />
In his judgement, Mr Justice Moore recognised the value of<br />
the pause. He said: " On 19 April we said that employers<br />
generally had agreed with the government about prices and we<br />
expressed the hope that agreement would be reached about wages;<br />
and we still have that hope. This decision does not, of course,<br />
close the door to any future proposals but provides a proper base 13 </p>
<p>I for a more fully defined and viable wage-price pause.<br />
The Commission would make itself available quickly to do what<br />
it could to assist in implementing such a pause and the<br />
impending inquiry into wage fixation methods could provide<br />
a ready vehicle."<br />
The pause has demonstrated that headway can be made in<br />
controlling the rate of increase in wages and prices by efforts<br />
from members of the community.<br />
I would hope that all parties employers and unions will<br />
exercise restraint to ensure that the gains made during the voluntarl<br />
price pause are not lost. They can be built upon. Let us<br />
continue our efforts.<br />
The strength of the support which Australians everywhere gave<br />
to the pause shows the concern the public feels about inflation.<br />
I am sorry that the Commission did not award a smaller increase<br />
in wages. This would have ensured a more rapid slow down<br />
in inflation.<br />
Nevertheless, the decision to discount for the effects of<br />
devaluation on prices is very much welcomed. </p>
