ERARJ MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR LORD BRUCE<br />
Honourable Members may recall that in November<br />
last, the Government agreed to the request contained in the will of the<br />
late Lord Bruce that his ashes be scattered over Canberra.<br />
It was also agreed that arrangements would be made<br />
for a memorial service to take place at the same time and that the<br />
ceremonies would be held on a suitable occasion after the resumption<br />
of Parliament. This was to enable the Parliament to be fully<br />
represented. I now wish to inform the House that a Memorial<br />
Service will be held at noon next Wednesday, 20 March at All Saints'<br />
Church, Ainslie and that in the course of the service the Royal<br />
Australian Air Force will give effect to the wishes of the late Lord<br />
Bruce by the scattering of the ashes over Canberra. </p>
