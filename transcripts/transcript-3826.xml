PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 532<br />
17 July 1975<br />
SENATE INTERROGATION<br />
S three daTyhse hoapvpeo sibteeino n'dse plaocrtaibolnes. in Int hea n Seenxaetrec isoev ert hetyhe past<br />
knew would achieve nothing they subjected senior and<br />
respected public servants to an unnecessary and humiliating<br />
experience. They tried to turn the Senate into a Star<br />
Chamber. They made a mockery of proper parliamentary<br />
practices. The Opposition knew on Tuesday that senior<br />
public servants would be protected from harassment about<br />
activities for which they bore no responsibility. Public<br />
servants advise Ministers; Ministers alone are responsible<br />
for the Government's actions.<br />
Rlaying failed to persuade public.; servants to disobey<br />
their instructions, the Opposition is now turning its might<br />
on private citizens.<br />
It has called Mr Karidis, an Adelaide builder, to<br />
appear before it on Tuesday. Would it then call Mr Harris,<br />
the Melbourne dentist? It seems unlikely, because Mr<br />
Harris, has had dealings not only with Mr Lynch,<br />
according to published affidavits, but also, whether the<br />
Victorian Premier knows or admits it or not, with the<br />
Chairman of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of<br />
Works, Mr Croxford, and the head of the Melbourne<br />
Underground Rail Loop Authority, Mr Roscoe.<br />
The Opposition is hell-bent on finding evidence of<br />
misconduct by the Government. The Government's opponents<br />
have resorted to the use of confidence men, men with<br />
histories of mental instability and crooks to uncover<br />
evidence of Government misconduct but they have failed.<br />
They bill find no evidence because the Government has done<br />
nothing which is illegal or improper.<br />
All relevant documents concerning the loans have been<br />
tabled in Parliament. They don't suit the Opposition because<br />
they do not support their innuendoes of impropriety. So<br />
the opposition chooses to ignore the facts in its mindless<br />
and desperate search for headlines. / 2 </p>

The activities of the Senate, in the past three<br />
days, have wasted the time of senior public servants<br />
and produced nothing of value. They have already<br />
delayed the Government's work on this year's Budget,<br />
a Budget which will be one of the most important<br />
to be brought down since the War. The Cabinet and its<br />
Committees could not get on with the job of framing<br />
the Budget while Senate Ministers and senior officials<br />
were tied down in the Opposition's fruitless continuation<br />
of the Senate sitting.<br />
Although the Opposition was told repeatedly that<br />
public servants had been ordered not to answer questions,<br />
it proceeded with the farce of questioning them knowing<br />
they would not answer. The Opposition's aim was clear:<br />
0 it wanted to attack the Government by attacking the<br />
public servants. As the Leader of the Opposition said<br />
in one of his revealing asides to Government members,<br />
" It's you fellows I want not them. And I'll get you".<br />
But Senator Withers and his colleagues are not prepared<br />
to attack the Government directly. They have asked many<br />
questions in the Parliament, most of which have already<br />
been answered, and the remainder of which will be.<br />
They are not prepared to use proper parliamentary<br />
forms. They have still not formulated any charges<br />
against the Government.<br />
