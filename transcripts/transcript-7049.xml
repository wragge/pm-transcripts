A L AT<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 December 1986<br />
The Government has now determined the top structure of the new<br />
office of Multicultural Affairs.<br />
The position of Head of the office, and the two senior supporting<br />
positions, are being advertised this week, and it is hoped<br />
appointments will be made by early in the new year.<br />
As I said in my statement on 18 November, the office will be<br />
) basically an advisory and research body.<br />
it will have a number of roles perhaps the primary one of which<br />
will be to develop and maintain close liaison with ethnic<br />
communities and provide a channel through which their needs and<br />
concerns are brought to the Government's notice.<br />
The office will conduct and sponsor research on policies,<br />
programs and services which bear on'multiculturalism and the<br />
needs and concerns of ethnic communities.<br />
It will be providing advice to me, Mr Hurford and the Government<br />
on those matters, and on any other proposals coming forward to<br />
the Government which might have an impact on the development of<br />
multiculturalism and policies, programs and services for ethnic<br />
communities. it will have a co-ordinating and supporting role in information<br />
programs for ethnic communities, and information programs<br />
directed to the development of multiculturalism.<br />
It will, of course, have a monitoring and policy development role<br />
in this broad field, including access and equity issues.<br />
It is particularly important that the office will be working in a<br />
way which is fully integrated into internal Government<br />
decision-making processes, so that its advice can be given at the<br />
appropriate points of decision-making.<br />
The filling of senior positions in the Office will represent the<br />
first stage in its establishment.<br />
Those persons chosen will be charged immediately with examination<br />
of existing Government activity and the role formerly played by<br />
the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs ( AIMA), and<br />
with conducting consultations vith the ethnic communities about<br />
the structure and role of the office and of the Advisory Council<br />
associated with it.<br />
Decis ions on the detail will then be taken by the Government on<br />
the basis of a considered report as early as possible in the new<br />
year. </p>
