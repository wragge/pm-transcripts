sT.-AK-J IS, 3 LONDON<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister9 the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert<br />
Menzieos<br />
The Prime Minister said today that the Commonwealth<br />
Government had decided to contribute fœ 5 000 to the appeal<br />
for œ 150,000 sterling to complete the c.. eaning of the<br />
outside of St. Paulfs Cathedral, London. A request had been<br />
made by the Lord Mayor of London through Sir Eric Harrison,<br />
Australian High Commissioner in the United Kingdom.<br />
The West Front of the Cathedral, including the<br />
famous Bell and Clock Towers had already been cleaned<br />
thanks to the generosity of ? he Ionian Bank of London.<br />
As the Lord Mayor said in his request to Sir Eric " This<br />
good work has not only revealed beauties in Sir Christopher<br />
Wren's design and in the craftsmanship of his stonemasons<br />
which had been concealed for generations by incrustations<br />
of grime, but has brought to light such hidden features as<br />
the Marble surround to the groat West Doors, the Frioze of<br />
of the main Cornice over the Portico, and many other details<br />
of absorbing interest."<br />
The Prime Minister emphasised that St. Paul's<br />
housed in its crypt the Chapel of the Order of the British<br />
Empire and thus had a special significance for the whole<br />
Commonwealth of Nations.<br />
