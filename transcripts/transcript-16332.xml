    <content><![CDATA[<p>GILLARD: Well I'm here today with our Minister for Tourism, Martin Ferguson.</p>
<p>Today some figures have been released by our tourism forecasting agency about expected tourism figures next year and beyond.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly they show in this forecast that in 2009 it's likely to be a tough year for the Australian tourism industry. In light of the global financial crisis, obviously the impacts have been felt throughout our economy, including in our tourism industry.</p>
<p>The forecast shows we are likely to expect less inbound tourists from overseas in 2009 than we have had in recent years. However the forecast also shows that we are expecting a slight rise in domestic spending on tourism, that is, Australians holidaying in Australia.</p>
<p>In light of these figures and in light of the global financial crisis generally, the message from the Australian Government is very clear. There has never been a better time to holiday at home in Australia. There's never been a better time for Australians who were thinking about taking a bit of leave to decide to take that holiday here in our own country.</p>
<p>Whether it's the Margaret River or Kakadu. Whether it's the Great Barrier Reef or the Blue Mountains. Whether it's seeing the National Gallery or our own Great Ocean Road here in Victoria. Whether it's visiting the Barossa Valley or going to our Apple Isle. This is a nation with world class tourism attractions and it's a great time to be holidaying at home.</p>
<p>I'll turn to Minister Ferguson for the details of the forecast and then we'll be happy to take any questions.</p>
<p>FERGUSON: The tourism industry are going to do it very tough over the next 12 months. Clearly the global financial crisis is having a major impact on our traditional international markets such as North America and Europe.</p>
<p>In terms of where the industry goes it also comes back to Australians actually starting to think about having a holiday here at home. Australians have 121 million days of accumulated leave representing $31 billion. By having a holiday at home you actually can help your mates. You don't have to go away for extended trips, you can actually just go on day trips or away for a couple of days. Even a question of going to the movies, going to the cricket or going out for a meal, it's all part of the tourism industry.</p>
<p>I simply say to the tourism industry, the Australian Government understands your plight. The economic security package is also about the disposable dollar. Tourism like retail actually competes with the disposable dollar. People now having experienced a bit of retail therapy over the last couple of days ought to think about a trip or two with their family. Have a break from work because remember this, no leave means no life.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: How long is this industry downturn likely to last?</p>
<p>FERGUSON: I would expect that the tourism industry is going to do it very tough for the next 12 months internationally. Alternatively from a domestic point of view we expect an increase in spending.</p>
<p>That is related to the fact that the Australian dollar has weakened, therefore it is less attractive to go overseas, and also the price of fuel is down. So to Australian families and their friends will get together and think about going away for a couple of days. It can be as Julia said, down to the Margaret River or the Flinders Ranges, the Blue Mountains, the Gold Coast, the Apple Isle, to Canberra or whatever. Doesn't matter where you go, spend a bit of time with your family because in the end, you actually have a break from work, it's better for your family and you go back to work an even better worker.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Aside from encouraging people holiday domestically though, what is the Government going to do to assist these tourism industries which are struggling?</p>
<p>FERGUSON: The tourism industry is clearly about expenditure. We've got the economic security package which meant 1.5 million Australians have had an increase in disposable income in December.</p>
<p>We'll also next year got the tax cuts actually starting to cut in to assisting the Australian community. So in terms of the domestic market, whilst the international market is becoming very tough, the domestic market becomes more and more attractive, especially given the weakening of the Australian dollar is less attractive to actually go overseas. So all the economic indicators in some ways actually encourage people to actually have a holiday back at home.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible)</p>
<p>FERGUSON: Obviously from an industry point of view, it's not just about the short term, it's also about the long term. I've been in the process of developing a long term tourism industry package, which also has a focus on the skilling, the issue of training and also infrastructure. That's about positioning the tourism industry as we come out of this international economic slump in 12 to 18 months time, so as to make sure that we are well positioned to grab economic opportunities in the international market as they become available.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Would the Government consider direct assistance to tourism operators though in the short term?</p>
<p>FERGUSON: Look in terms of direct assistance, the best thing you can do is actually to invest in the future. That's about investing in skills and infrastructure. But I can also say that we have done the best thing by the tourism industry by putting money in the hands of Australian workers and their families through the economic security package. That's about disposable dollars and the tourism industry like the retail sector is now getting out there. It's offering competitive packages from the airlines' point of view, from the hotels' point of view, to actually trying in encouraging people to actually use the tourism opportunities that are available in Australia here and now.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Does this make the Tourism Australia, the new ad campaign, a waste of money?</p>
<p>FERGUSON: The Tourism Australia campaign is not a waste of money because you'd understand, you have to maintain a market presence. We don't continue to spend and market Australia internationally, then in 12 and 18 months time it's going to be impossible to break back into those markets. That's what the tourism industry is telling me in places such as North America and Europe and Japan  -  we expect you to give a clear commitment you are here for the long haul and the Tourism Australia campaign is about marking our spot and building our international appreciation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Did you holiday here or overseas last year, this year I should say?</p>
<p>FERGUSON: I'm pleased to say I'm on a holiday today talking to you.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>GILLARD: Holidaying in Melbourne.</p>
<p>FERGUSON: Ok, can I go. I can say to you that neither I nor my wife have ever had an overseas holiday. We've always had a holiday here at home.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Ms Gillard, do you believe that the Baz Lurhmann campaign has been an expensive failure?</p>
<p>GILLARD: No, I agree with what the Minister just said which is it's very important to keep a presence in overseas tourist markets. Obviously, the movie Australia with all of its scenery of the Australian landscape is important to that marketing venture and the marketing campaign that's been engaged in, works with that, works with that new presence for Australia in international markets.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: There's been lot of criticism of Paris Hilton's whirlwind trip to Melbourne and particularly her spending of $6 thousand in 40 minutes. Do you think you could spend that in 40 minutes in the Boxing Day sales?</p>
<p>GILLARD: I don't think I could. No, I'm obviously not as practiced at shopping as Ms Hilton is. But having said that I think Ms Hilton is onto something very important which is whether or not you want to have a holiday that's about fashion or about a big night out, Australia's a great place to do it. She's come to Australia to do just that, so I think in her own way she's reinforcing the message that Minister Ferguson and I are giving to the Australian community today, which is Australia is a great place to holiday.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you agree with Tim Costello though that she should donate that money to charity instead?</p>
<p>GILLARD: Well obviously Tim Costello, who has worked so long and so hard for charities both here and overseas, would always have that at the forefront of his mind. I can understand why he's made those comments. But I would say Ms Hilton in doing her shopping in Melbourne is reinforcing that Australian fashion is at the forefront of fashion around the world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Just on the situation in the Gaza Strip, the Government has been criticised for standing by. When would the Government condemn what's going on over there and the subsequent death toll?</p>
<p>GILLARD: Well I made a number of statements about this around 48 hours ago. And can I say very clearly, obviously the Australian Government is deeply disturbed by the resumption of violence and we are saddened and concerned by the loss of civilian life. We unreservedly condemn the shelling of southern Israel by Hamas and other militant groups, and whilst we recognise Israel's right to defend itself, we strongly support the United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate halt to all violence.</p>
<p>We would want to see an immediate halt to all violence. We are saddened and concerned by the loss of civilian life. I would also say to Australians that this reinforces the need for Australians to check our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advisories. Obviously our travel advisory is there strongly advising against travel to the region immediately near the West Bank within 12 km. That travel advisory is something that Australians should take note of.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: On a much lighter note, there's been calls for topless beach goers to be banned. Do you think topless beaches are inappropriate?</p>
<p>GILLARD: I think it's all a question of context and clear signage and marking. I think people want to go to the beach and use the beach in a variety of ways. Obviously family groups want to go to the beach, people who want to get a bit of sun all over also want to go to the beach. As long as people know what the rules are and know what to expect, then I think it's a matter for the individuals involved. But I should I think reinforce, particularly with my complexion and standing next to Minister Ferguson, that we are people who would strongly urge sensible conduct in terms of sun smarts. So there's also a stage where people should be getting the hat on, getting the shirt on, and getting the sunscreen on.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: On a more serious note, is the Government going to apologise to Mohamed Haneef?</p>
<p>GILLARD: The Government is anticipating receiving a compensation claim from Mr Haneef's lawyers. In those circumstances, the Government won't be making any comments in relation to the question of compensation or any other form of redress from Mr Haneef.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed by the Australian cricket team's collapse?</p>
<p>GILLARD: I am not going to pretend to be a cricket expert, I'm not. The Prime Minister is an expert, I believe the Minister standing next to me might be a man of considerable expertise as well. But on the potential fortunes for today, can I say whilst there's life there's hope.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Did you holiday overseas last year or this year I should say?</p>
<p>GILLARD: No, the last day trip, well overnight stay I took for holiday purposes was in Lorne and earlier in the year I had a day trip and overnight stay in the Bateman's Bay region outside the ACT.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
