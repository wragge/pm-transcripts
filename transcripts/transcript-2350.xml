THE COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE<br />
Interview givenby the Prime Minister, Mr. . JP Gorton<br />
for ABC Television on his return from the Singapore Conference januaryj191I<br />
Interviewer. Robert Moore<br />
Q. Prime Minister, it seems that most of the reports that have come out on,<br />
the Conference have been gloomy rather than optimistic. People have suggested<br />
that it was a waste of time, if not something worse. Do you feel, as you loo~ k<br />
back on it, that the Commonwealth has come out stronger than it went into<br />
the Conference?<br />
PM No, I don't think anybody could say that. But I don't see how anybody<br />
could say it was gloomy or the reports were gloomy if not worse. The<br />
Commonwealth Conference broke up without anybody leaving the Conference,<br />
and before the Conference was held it was thought that some countries might<br />
do that under certain circumstances. So far, this has not happened. On the<br />
other hand, the underlying questions have not really been resolved. But I<br />
would say, it was much the same as it was before the Conference.<br />
Q. Were you disappointed in any way at the conduct of the Conference, or<br />
the items that were discussed or the manner in which they were discussedi<br />
PM Yes, I was a bit disappointed at the manner in which a number of items<br />
were discussed. That is to say, a formal sitting around a large table and the<br />
reading of formal speeches, much on the United Nations model. I was a little<br />
disappointed at that, and I wasn't alone in this. A number of other delegations<br />
also said they thought it would be much better to get away from this formalised<br />
kind of sitting around and reading of set speeches, and the handing out to the<br />
press afterwards. And also I was a little I suppose " disappointed" is the<br />
word at so much of the time of the Conference, a very great deal of the time,<br />
being taken up discussing this one question of Britain and the provision of maritime<br />
naval facilities and arms to South Africa. It finished up with nobody changing<br />
their position. It did seem to me that people could have stated their position<br />
once, or if necessary, twice, and then said, " Well, those are our positions"<br />
and gone on to something else. But at least two -full days was spent in going<br />
over and over that.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, some reports have pictured you as a " loner", as the<br />
tough. guy of the Conference. I think one of the Singapore papers called you<br />
" Two-gun Gorton". What were your relations with the other leaders,<br />
particularly the African leaders? Were you so toughf Did you stand on your<br />
dignity so much? / 2 </p>
<p>PM I don't think I stood on my dignity at all. But what I do believe one should<br />
do at internation conferences or Commonwealth Conferences of this kind is to<br />
say what one believes, is t~ o put one's point of view exactly as one sees it.<br />
And indeed, other members of the Conference apparently had the same view.<br />
I can see no point in using so much roundabout diplomatic verbiage that nobody<br />
knows what you mean, and you can have a disagreement about what you meant<br />
later. Maybe that was what they had in mind. But as far as relations with<br />
the other individual members were concerned, I feel they were very good. I<br />
like Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, and he did go to some trouble to come and<br />
say goodbye especially before he left. Kaunda, in his last speech, suggested<br />
it would be a good thing if people from Australia went through Lusaka and saw<br />
more of his country, and if he and others could come and see more of us for<br />
understanding. I don't think there was anything but good personal feeling<br />
between us, although we had slightly different points of view.<br />
Q. What was the role of Mr. Trudeau? Some people have suggested that he<br />
was an honest broker, or mediator, or a smoother-over of troubled waters.<br />
Did he play a big role, say, in the final draft on the Declaration?<br />
PM Well, he played a role in it, but I don't think he played as great a role as<br />
the Australians played, and by the Australians, I don't just mean myself I<br />
mean myself and Mr. McMahon. There was a Declaration which was going to<br />
be made and which all members were asked to subscribe to, and there-were<br />
some things in that Declaration which we felt and we were not alone but we<br />
-Ielt we couldn't subscribe to because we weren't in fact going to carry them out,<br />
and therefore there should be changes in the original draft. Now, Mr. Trudeau<br />
knew the African leaders ( he had had one of his aides over there speaking to<br />
them beforehand), and he spoke to them and he got a suggested amendment and then I<br />
put in a particular amendment saying that racialism, when we talked about it,<br />
meant the practice of racialism within our own nation, each one withi its<br />
own nation....<br />
Q. Do you think it is fair to say that you pursued what one might call a hard<br />
line at the Conference't<br />
PM Yes, I think it is fair to say I pursued a hard line in two respects one<br />
is that the Commonwealth Conference must operate in the way it has always<br />
operated in the past, and that is by people expressing points of view to each<br />
other and not trying to pass resolutions which purport to be binding, not trying<br />
to take decisions by majority vote, not trying to reach conSen~ sus of opinion<br />
which is expected to be accepted by those who don't have that opinion.<br />
Q. Well, what is left then, Sir, if you....<br />
PM What has always been there. This il~ ea that you-might adopt the practice<br />
of the United Nations, of passing resolutions and things is completely new, as<br />
far as Commonwealth Conferences are concerned. What is left is for people<br />
sitting around a table, putting their point of view to each other, agreeing on<br />
particular matters or agreeing to disagree on particular matters, and then going<br />
on to things on which some constructive action can be taken. This has always / 3 </p>
<p>been the concept of the Commonwealth, and if it is to turn into a United Nations<br />
with a majority vote, it. wilL. I am sure, destroy itself.<br />
Q. Would the kind of Commonwealth and the kind of Conference you have in mind<br />
allow for criticism of the policies of varbus countries by other countries?<br />
PM Oh, yes. But not for communiques and declarations issued by majority vote<br />
criticising. It would allow for discussion and argument and criticism the way<br />
Commonwealth Conferences in the past have always done.<br />
Q. But only in private meetings?<br />
PM Yes, that's right.<br />
Q. Well, I wonder if we could turn now to the issue of the proposed sale of arms<br />
by Britain to South Africa. Was this issue resolved in any way at all at the<br />
Conference?<br />
PM, No, I don't think it was. It was the African countries, for reasons which are<br />
thoroughly understandable, who were very upset at the concept of the sale of<br />
naval vessels to South Africa by Britain. And they argued their case very cogently<br />
and they said this could lead to an upsurge of feeling against Britain, and the<br />
African countries turning to Russia and China and so on. One of the good contributions<br />
that was made in that field, I think, was made by Mr. Trudeau, who said, well,<br />
he Could see that and that was fine, but supposing Britain didn't sell arms, sell<br />
these maritime arms, France was presumably going to do it. Would that mak. e a<br />
difference to the African countries as vis-a-vis European countries, would they<br />
not be still as angry at Europeans coming in if perhaps Portguese or Germans<br />
or some other country would sell arms, would that not still leave the problem<br />
just as it was before? And he went further, and said, in any case, while South<br />
Africa exists in the way in which it exists and is governed at the present moment,<br />
won't there always be in the African countries, the focus for turning to Russia,<br />
or turning to China..,. will the thing be really changed merely by Britain refraining<br />
from fulfilling what she regards as her contractual obligations, and some other<br />
country coming in and fulfilling them. I thought that was a good analysis of -LL.<br />
Q. Do you feel that the British Government will wait for the result of the<br />
investigation by the so-called study group before makb-tg a decision?<br />
PM All I can say on that is that Mr. Heath made it abundantly clear, and perfectly<br />
clear and on the record that he was not bound in any way to wait for any decision<br />
by this study group.<br />
Q. Well, what do you see as the status and function and value of the study group?<br />
For instance, would Austra hia be bound by ny findings it might make about tile<br />
threat of the Russian Navy in the Indian Ocean? a 0 0 /' 6 </p>
<p>PM No, no, no. Not at all. As a matter of fact, the wording of the study group<br />
was " to examine I speak from memory " to examine the factors<br />
Jeading to strategic threats to the sea routes of the world". It was pretty high, wide<br />
and handsome terms o! reference. It was then confined to the South Atlantic and the<br />
Indian Ocean. I think it may have been in the minds o! some of those who proposed<br />
it that if this was accepted, then Britain would say, " Well we will wait until thlis<br />
has been carried out" but Britain, in fact, did not accept that and made it quite<br />
clear.<br />
Q. Do you see this study group as having any real function at all? Or is it really<br />
just widow-dressing?<br />
PM Well, I would like to wait until the terms of reference are completely worked<br />
out. I don't know that it will affect in one way or another Britain's decisions.<br />
Q. Or Australia's?<br />
PM Australia hasn't got any decisions to make.<br />
Q. It must be very interested in...<br />
PM We are not selling arms to South Africa. The whole question is should<br />
Britain sell maritime arms to South Africa?<br />
Q. I imagined the study group took in much wider territory of trying to mak'e<br />
some judgment on the threat to maritime trade routes in the Indian Ocean.<br />
Australia would have an interest in that.<br />
PM Oh, we would have an interest in it which I declared and made clear in the<br />
Conference. But our interest is that there should be friendly ships if I can put<br />
it that way able to lend assistance to the security o the trade router. on which<br />
we so much depend. Those friendly ships can only operate if there are bases<br />
from which they should operate. And we are interested in bases being available.<br />
Now, it is up to Britain to decide whether, from military points of viewi, from1<br />
financial points of view, she can best do this , in her own judgment, as a result a!<br />
using the Simonstown base.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, is it your impression that some African countries will leave<br />
the Commonwealth if Britain does sell arms to South Africa?<br />
PM Oh, I think we have to wait I wouldn't speculate on that.<br />
Q. You were not able to get any insight into that?<br />
PM I don't want to speculate on it. </p>
<p>Q. It seems to many observers, I suppose, that one of the problems facing tile<br />
Commonwealth now I think this was shown at the Corlerence is that there is<br />
probably an irreconcilable conflict of priorities in the minds of the variou's<br />
members. I would like to quote very very briefly to you something from President<br />
Nyerere's background paper which seems to me to put that so-called African point<br />
of view very succinctly. In his paper, President Nyerere says the Africans do<br />
not expect all Commonwealth countries to have the samne order of foreign policy<br />
priorities. And now here I quote " But we do expect that they will have South<br />
African racialism on their list of priorities even if it is not at the top. Now is<br />
South African racialism on the list of our foreign policy priorities?<br />
PM In the sense of taking action against the South African Government, no, it<br />
isn't. And this is one of the reasons why we couldn't go along with the Zambian<br />
Declaration. The original Zambian Declaration suggested that all countries should<br />
seek every means of combating racialism every means and deny all regimes<br />
which practise it any assistance which could consolidate or strengthen them.<br />
Now this means, or could be interpreted to mean undoubtedly, that you would break<br />
off trade relations with any such country, and -you wuld break off diplomatic<br />
relations, and indeed, if you take it seriously that you would use every mean-s<br />
you could be required to go to war against them. Now, we are just not going<br />
to do this.<br />
Q. To come back to President Nyerere's point of view.... South African racialism<br />
is not a foreign policy priority for us?<br />
PM it is some thing which we deplore publicly and say we don't agree with. We<br />
don't agree with the way it is applied but it is not something which we propose to<br />
take international actio-n to combat.<br />
Q. The African countries seem to want you to say, or the Commonwealth to<br />
say not just that racialism is bad but that it is the worst thing in international<br />
relations or human relations.<br />
PM Yes, I think that the African countries, when they speak of racialism, don't<br />
completely have in their minds racialism as practised in countries all over the world.<br />
I think to them racialism means South African domination. I don't think'.* they are<br />
at all concerned with disagreements, racial practices such as an African nation<br />
agaist Asian citizens or perhaps the problems that we have seen in England or<br />
in America or in other countries. -That comes into it partly, but basically I<br />
believe whether they know it or not when they speak of racialism they really<br />
mean South African and Rhodesian domination.<br />
Q. Is there really any hope of countries which disagree so violently and<br />
emotionally on their priorities in foreign policy, any hope that these countries<br />
can live together as a Commonwealth for much longer? / 6 </p>
<p>PM I would think that there was and there ought to be because while oin may<br />
disagree as to priorities, nevertheless there should be and there is, within<br />
a numube r of foreign policy objectives, or economic policy objectives, thinirgs or.<br />
which these countries can and do agree. Now that ought to bind, and people ought<br />
to be able to say, " Well, these other things, we don't quite agree, but let's<br />
go on to the ones we do agree about".<br />
Q. In the weeks leading up to the conference, our p osition on the sale of British<br />
arms to South Africa wras often described as being neutral. Now, in whtat sense<br />
was it neutral? What could we have against it?<br />
PM What could we have....<br />
Q. Against the sale of arms to South Africa to make us neutral?<br />
PM Well, we had to consider two things : One, the feelings of other people i the<br />
Commonwealth to some extent; secondly, that this was, ba: 3ically, a British<br />
Government's decisioin. We did not we, as I said before, we want to see that<br />
the Indian Ocean trade routes are protected, particularly since there is now a<br />
growing Russian interest in the area. There have to be bases from which these<br />
ships can operate. I have a belief that if Simonstown were in Tanzania, if it<br />
were not in South Africa, that everybody would say, " Yes, of course, this is the<br />
place for a base and this is where these things can best be done".<br />
Q. Could I put it to you, then,, if the same security arrangements could be rra de<br />
in another way, would you prefer arms not to be sold to South Africa?<br />
PM I am afraid that wie have taken the view, and I think1c that it is the correct one,<br />
that we are interested in the protection of the Indian Ocean trade routes. If<br />
Britain in her judgment feels that any action she takes contributes to thle protection<br />
of the Indian trade routes, that is her decisioin, and the results of that, as far<br />
as the Indian trade routes are concerned, would be iii Australia's interest. But<br />
we don't urge or condemn.<br />
Q. Well, put it in another way, then. Is a strong South African essen-tial to our<br />
security in the Indian Ocean?<br />
PM I wouldn't want to comment on that. After all, we are talking simply about<br />
whether the base which Britain occupies, which she monitors, under which there<br />
is an agreement, should be continued to be used by her for the protection of<br />
naval routes trade routes. I can only repeat that we think it is her decision<br />
on this, and we don't propose to condemn her for mal-zing any decision she makes<br />
or protest against any decision she makes, or urge her into making any<br />
decision.<br />
Q. But you wouldn't rather have the security if another base could be f. Lound and<br />
not have the arms sold to South Africa? Wouldn't that be a kind of compromiie.... o. / 7 </p>
<p>PM I would like to leave this to Britain's dec tsion.<br />
Q. What precisely is the degree of threat now, of the Russian Navy hi the hidian<br />
Ocean?<br />
PM I don't think it is great I don't think it is great at all. It is comparatively<br />
you Imow, ships deployed are comparatively small. But there is a new element<br />
that has been introduced. Russian ships in the past have come into the Indian<br />
Ocean and gone away againi. But there is clearly a much greater degree of<br />
interest, a much greater period of time during which Ohips df the Russian Navy<br />
are in the Indian Ocean, a clear greater Interest and greater act ion to sustati<br />
that interest. And this is comparatively new.<br />
Q. You allow that the Russians do have some kind of legitimate interest in the<br />
Indian Ocean<br />
PM I suppose that all countries really have an interest in tKl oceans, but I agree<br />
with Briain that when there is a new element introduced 4r:: o a situation, the.-, you<br />
have to take cognisance of that new dement.<br />
Q. Is the threat really to the trade routes or is it so. i-iing else?<br />
PM didn't say there was a threat, you know. I just L., d there was a new<br />
element that had been introduced and that this, therefore, had to be taken care<br />
of. And I don't suppose that we would have been acti2ng as we are, to provide<br />
naval facilities in Western Australia, if we didn't fee. t<br />
Q. Why is the study group then looking at the security of maritime trade routes<br />
in the Indian Ocean if there isn't some kind of hypothetical, I suppose, threat<br />
from somebody?<br />
PM I think that this was something that was put up by somebody at the Conference<br />
I think I told you this before perhaps in the expectation that if it were put up<br />
and adopted then it would delay Britain making a decision. But Britain made it<br />
quite clear that this was not so.<br />
Q. Well, can I put it this way. If Russia were to be a threat in the Li-dian Ocean,<br />
would it be through its effect on our trade routes or would it be somethi-ng else?<br />
I mean, what could it do about the trade routes?<br />
PM Well, I don't think that in talking about the Commonwealth Conference and<br />
what occupied the Commonwealth Conference, I want to go into kind of Defence<br />
Papers on what the effects of a new presence in the Indian Ocean might, from<br />
a defence point of view, be, other than to say as I have said before, we are<br />
interested in maintaining a trade route. Britain is particularly interested in<br />
maintaining her trade routes; there is a n. w element introduced; Britain and<br />
ourselves feel that we need to take more interest in it ourselves. T" hat's all. / 0 </p>
<p>8.<br />
Q. Now, Prime Minister, we will leave that there. Could I turn now to another<br />
subject which arose not at the Conference but while you were i nSingapore.,<br />
our immigration policy. In your speech to the Australian Alumni Association,-you<br />
were quoted as saying, of Australia, that " it may provide the first truly multiracial<br />
society, with no tensions of any kind possible between any of the races<br />
within it. At any rate, this is our ideal". Now, did you see that as a major<br />
statement of new policy?<br />
PM No, I didn't.<br />
Q. What did you mean by multi-racial then, a multi-racial society?<br />
P.) M I meant a society in which there are people with different coloured skins, of<br />
different racial extraction, such as in fact we have in Australia at the momenit.<br />
We have Australians, we have aboriginals, we have Australians of Chinese<br />
extraction, of Japanese extraction, of a variety of races. You see, Sinñ gapore<br />
I was speaking in Singapore and speaking to the Singapore Alumni people<br />
Singapore says, " We are a multi-racial society" and so they are. They are<br />
Chinese, Malays, Indians, Europeans, Eurasians, but they are also a homogeneous<br />
society. I don't know the percentage, but I would thinkL'-90 per cent at least are<br />
Chinese. They are homogeneous, but there are many races. And there are<br />
also tensions there between the races from time to time. And as far as Australia<br />
is concerned, I believe we must remain homogeneous. I believe in the present<br />
application of our immigration policy, but under our present immigration<br />
rolicy, people of other races can come in and be assimilated. I feel there is<br />
little or no racial feeling in Australia towards such people. And this being<br />
continued could lead to a multi-racial society in the sense that there wiere a<br />
number of different races, without racial tensions which exist in almost every<br />
other country of the world. But can I perhaps make it more clear by reading<br />
some sentences of what I said.... because one of the speakers had spoken about<br />
our immigration policy. I said,<br />
" As far as the application of an immigration policy is concerned, I<br />
have no hesitatio-n in saying what I am now going to say, and I propose<br />
to make no apology for saying it. Looking around the world, I see<br />
social problems between Negro and Asian in some parts of Africa,<br />
I see tensions between Negro and European in England. I see grave<br />
danger to normal liing in the split between the races in the United<br />
States, and I read not long ago of riots between races not far av ay from<br />
Where I am standing now,, riots which could have easily spread to<br />
Singapore. I am not going to allow that kind of da:ñ-ger to occur in<br />
Australia.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, if I could just come back to that, you also did mention<br />
that Australia might become the first truly multi-racial society in another part.<br />
I doin't want to bandy words with you. Now what you are saying there is that to<br />
the extent we become a multi-racial society, it won't be so much through<br />
deliberate policy as through accident or stealth 0 / 9 </p>
<p>PM '/ eli, I think it will be through deliberate policy in that we are not propos,: ing<br />
to change an immigration policy in order to allow large numbers of other races to<br />
come in, because that would create racial tens ion. Can I quote the words that<br />
you are quotin~ g?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM/ " I think that the course which we are followtog" that is our present<br />
immigration policy " holds great chances of achieving real racial tolerance.<br />
I think it holds better chances than if we were to risk the kind of racial confl-icts<br />
t hat other countries which I believe we would risk, if we abandoned<br />
our present policy. " I think if we build up gradually inside Australia a proportion<br />
of people without white skins, then there will be a complete lack of conscious-ness<br />
that it is being built up" and that we will arrive-at a state where we vi 11<br />
have a multi-racial country without racial tensions and perhaps the f" irst in<br />
the world. The key to that is that we do maintain our present policy.<br />
Q. wouldI fy tohue rper ewfeerre an osto cteientsyi ownhs ich nwo arsanc'ita hl otmenosgioennse ou[ i sba umt uwlhtii-crha cinia fl acsto cdiiedt yh ave<br />
great diversity of race, of language, religion...<br />
PM You are asking me a question that if there were no racial tensions, and<br />
wherever I look in the world, I can see no instance where there aren't racial<br />
tensions<br />
Q. Whiat I am really asking is is a homogeneous society a preferable ideal to<br />
a very diverse society?! It seemed to me you were hinting....<br />
PM If you look at ideals as distinct from realities, of course an ideal is something<br />
that one must ultimately strive towards, but it is not something which can be<br />
applied in a world of reality.<br />
Q. Well, if Australia goes on. being so relatively free from racial tellsions,<br />
given the limited amount of non-European immigration, would you like to see,<br />
or would you expect to see a gradual increase in the number of non-European"-<br />
migrating to Australia?<br />
PM I would want to see Australia remaining homogeneous, overwhelminigly<br />
homogeneous, as I think that is the only way one can avoid racial tensions. There<br />
are racial tensions and I am quoting aghin " There are racial tensioins, and<br />
whether there, ought to be or not, doesn't matter. We live in a world of reality.<br />
We don't live in a world which mo uld be different if we could shatter it to bits<br />
and remould it. And living in a world of reality, I believe that if we were to<br />
abandon our restricted immigration policy, that we would get tensions that wie won't<br />
get if wie continue with the liberalised policy we have now got. *.* 0/ l13 </p>
<p>Q. Of course, it is often suggested, and I am sure you have heard this, that<br />
our policy is a racist policy people of other countries sometimes say this,<br />
often not looking at their own policies, I agree. But one of the things, of<br />
course, that they do beat us with now is the fact that we don't grant assisted<br />
passages to non-European migrants not so much the number, but we distinguish<br />
on that ground. Do you feel that it would be worth removing that charge?<br />
PM No. No, I dont.<br />
Q. Why?<br />
PM Because I believe that what we apply, and what almost every other country<br />
I can think of applies, is a racist immigration policy. If it were not, then ai-,,; body<br />
from anywhere could come in equal numbers and this simply doesn't apply.<br />
But what I believe is that the racial implications of abandoning our present<br />
policy would. lead to the kind of trouble that we have seen in other natio-ns, and<br />
not only European natiorB.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, now when we look ahead after the Conference, where do<br />
you see the Commonwealth in our overall foreign policy? How big a part does<br />
it, or will it, play?<br />
PM It is a very hard question to answer. You say " in our overall foreign<br />
policy". I don't quite know how to fit one concept into another. I would say,<br />
-for example, quite clearly Indonesia, in relation to our foreign policy, is far<br />
more important to us than many countries in the Commonwealth are far more<br />
impoitant. So I don't think the Commonwealth impi:-nges on that area of foreign-r<br />
policy at all. But perhaps where it impinges is that one can, or one hopes in<br />
the future, meet around the table, a group of people from different countries<br />
in the Commonwealth and explain to each one of them one' s own fo reign-policyt<br />
and perhaps reach things on which one can agree and which one can ao-operate,<br />
Q. , Prime Minister, I suppose tIe worst cynics suggest there won't be another<br />
Commonwealth Conference. Will there be?<br />
PM I can't tell you. I would be surprised if there were not. The Commonwealth<br />
is not going to aisappear because if the worst came to the worst, and some<br />
nations in it decided not to be in the Commonwealth.... it would depend on hoyl<br />
many nations still wished for there to be a Commonwealth, how many nations<br />
wanted to go to a Commonwealth Conference. And I think there would be quite<br />
a number. Prime Minister, thank you very much for talking to us. </p>
