FOR PRESS 19 MAY 1977<br />
REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IN QUEENSLAND<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Anthony, and the Queensland President of the National Party,<br />
Mr Sparkes, today made a combined appeal to Queenslanders to vote<br />
yes' for all four referendums on Saturday.<br />
In a special joint message to Queensland electors, the Party leaders<br />
urged voters to take this opportunity to reform the Federal<br />
Constitution. They said that the electors of Queensland should ignore<br />
propaganda tactics which were designed to hide the fact that the<br />
referendum proposals are simple and straightforward.<br />
There are four fair, just and reasonable proposals to be voted on.<br />
They will strengthen the Senate, safeguard the States and make<br />
the Constitution work better.<br />
The referendum proposals emerged from the 1976 Hobart Constitutional<br />
Convention which was instigated by the States and dominated by<br />
the States. There were 92 delegates at the Convention 72 from the<br />
States, 16 percent, 40 from the Federal Government and four<br />
from local government.<br />
The Constitutional Convention overwhelmingly supported the<br />
principles behind all four proposals.<br />
The four proposals on which Queenslanders and all other Australians<br />
will be asked to vote for on Saturday are::<br />
1. That elections for the House of Representatives and the<br />
Senate should be held at the same time.<br />
This is a matter of simple common sense. Unless this proposal<br />
is passed, there could be as many as four Federal elections<br />
in the next four years. The country does not want or need<br />
this. A ' yes' answer will strengthen the Senate and protect<br />
Queensland.<br />
2. That if a Senator dies or resigns he will be replaced for<br />
the remainder of his term of office by a member of the same<br />
Party. A ' yes' vote on this proposal will ensure that the voter<br />
choice at the election will be preserved. This is basic to<br />
our democracy.<br />
3. That electors in the Northern Territory and the Australian<br />
Capital Territory should be able to vote in referendums as<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>do all other Australians.<br />
A ' yes' vote will give Territorial voters the same<br />
fundamental rights as their fellow Australians.<br />
4. That High Court Judges should retire at the age of 70 and<br />
that a retiring age should be set for other Federal judges.<br />
The Queensland Government has set a retirement age of<br />
for their State judges, and it is only fair that at the age<br />
of 70 judges in the Federal arena should pass the job on to<br />
younger people.<br />
The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Queensland<br />
President of the National Party hope that Queenslanders will<br />
maintain their progressive record with respect to Constitutional<br />
reforms and vote ' yes' on all four proposals.<br />
