STMSGAT ( NVFIIS BILL, l962<br />
SNDE C RP DNG PRE~; c BY rTHE 11011.~ R._ TTETTPTPS<br />
This is a b-;_ 11 to make rrants to the States for<br />
U-niversities purposes. This is not tohe first bill of its kind, of<br />
course, nor do I supposeC that i~ t wil~ l fbe the last. It falls into<br />
two pcrts. In one part it deals witbhe recurrent grants to the<br />
uni'versities under rhat li-1 call the nolrmal pattern-, -in the<br />
second part it directs itselIf to thae proo. er of teact-ing hospitals<br />
at-tached to uaniversitie s0 Th'ose are -two different matters. One<br />
is old, but is being adjusted. The other is new. S o far a s thle<br />
old is concerned~, many honourable members will. recall that, under<br />
the St(-ates Gñ ants ( Universities) Act of 19609 vhich is the<br />
. princi~ pal ect ' for this purose.;. provision was wiar;-e in section 6<br />
that thle rate of basic-prcfessori-al rem-nerationi that is<br />
thie approved ratf. e for the purposes of finaric-lal assistance under<br />
this part -is : 04~., 000 per annLu., being the rate that was on<br />
October, 1960, th., e rate applicable in a majority of the universities<br />
in Aust-raliLa. That was not a * grovision a~ qich fixed professorial<br />
salaries at : 24, 000 pe,. r 3nmn. I t i. a a provision which treated<br />
œ e4 2000 as the average figu. re on " hhec Coxmmonwealth. grant<br />
shiould be based. I viar~ t to mnale that quite cleoar. ': Ie are not<br />
prestufiing to doterm-ine wh. t 19 tate unive.-sities shall pay to tiheir<br />
o; n academiJc stafTfs,, but ~, obvIously, for the pureeses of<br />
caculating whiat oughit to btc grante-,: d -to tho States under our<br />
broad scheme w~ e miust riave soroce, firure as a point of roforence in<br />
i'&amp; i. ation to es~ ria T. e st tes bei-g presu-med to bo<br />
in a certain ralationsliip to them Theefor-e, in te1960 actu-we<br />
nam-ed œ C4_ 00O and then, be causo at hat t-;, Ime tile whole of tihe<br />
salary s~ ructure was in a stato of flux and thecr_ wa re differenit<br />
rules anpp1led in d-ifferent States, w~ e added a provision in section<br />
6 sub-section whnich onablod Lthe Minister by an instrument<br />
under his harid, to a: lter that filgure and thor ) fcre vary the grant,<br />
On theP hole, ve thin! k -that sub-suctiOn is not a good<br />
th-ing, I thirnk tlnat Tmnmrabjeer sv gonerally would agree th-at<br />
if: 1 therve is to bea chonge in on~ e of the basic itams in the<br />
CcuJ-la ion otf a Stato g-, ant t-he. Ho-Lso oughit to liave an opportunity<br />
to look at 1it first., th. e re3fo-re I h-ave doci. ded that thnis subsection<br />
oughit to goand that int fu-tlue if thera is any chiange in<br />
the, poin-t of reforonce, as I hai" ve doscrmie it it ou,; ht to be<br />
done by a measure bj.-ou,_ ht into this Hosone -; hIichi can be<br />
discussed in this Houso,<br />
So what wre are p-. toposing he~ re is to alter the provision<br />
containcud i~ n s: ction 6o and to -Lepeal suction 6 so there<br />
will not ba any adminis trati. ve doci. sion on thio matter, but a<br />
statutory one. ThI'e alteatio i-' n section 6 hiaving regard to<br />
wniat a special comi~ itzeo rocormec. ed to the AustEralian<br />
Univers-ities Ccrrmi s. 5Lon aftur wide consultation, is to jincroaso<br />
the point of refo3rence for -tte calculation of~ the rocurrent<br />
grants from 42000 to œ, Z4., Y00 T'hat doe::-not me-,. an and I repoat<br />
thi~ s that thlat is the salary for a univaisity prcfessor; but it<br />
does mean thlat th-at is the isjr uron uh! c-Ich we calculate what we<br />
are going to pay to tbno States In relation to their universities<br />
for the current pericud.<br />
M~ r. Cpean You do not look at eJ, -her a 7, ax. r. nun or a minimuzm.<br />
MR. MENZIES No. I au C; Ia-d to be remntn'_ ed of th-is0 The<br />
corfmrittee that rcorted on thu a matter thouglit that perhaps the<br />
uniLversi-ties shiould adopt. a range of poXsorclsalarie's and<br />
siuggsted, in fact. thiac i uhtt u ac-co. rn toc their<br />
judmont and according to -the facu,. Ityr concernod, between ". 4,000<br />
and 500. But * Uhat was merely a r~ omnainof the committee. </p>
<p>Mr. Crean ' dithout having low--grade or high-grade professors?<br />
M-. 0 MENZIES. Quite so. e are not putting ourselves in the<br />
position of determining what the pay ought to be in the case of<br />
the various universitics. They are not within our jurisdiction.<br />
Howevor, we do fooeel, having regard to the goenral movement, that<br />
it would be wise to make an adjustment at this stage and date it<br />
back to the beginning of the iriennium because these things are<br />
done on a three-years basis a. l. tring the point of reference for<br />
salaries for this purpose from œ 4,000 to I think that that<br />
is all I need to say about that. The schedule to the bill shows<br />
what the provisions will be, having rugard to this adjustment in<br />
regard to salaries.<br />
The second thing that this bill does is to take up and<br />
deal with, for the first time, the problem of the teaching<br />
hospitals. This is a matter rhich has been put to me and to many<br />
of us, no doubt on a number ox' occasions, There are universities<br />
which have hospitals in wv. hich they provide clinical instruction<br />
for their medical students in their senior year, and those<br />
hospitals are staffed vary frequently by men of great distinction,<br />
very many of them in honorary positions, who are giving instruction<br />
which is vital for the complete education of med: ical students. It<br />
has booeen said for many years, I think with a good deal of truth,<br />
that if we are dealing with the universities problem we ought to<br />
provide for instruction in the teaching hospitals, because this is<br />
properly part of the work. of the universities. And in order to<br />
get a pretty clear mind on this thing, if we could, I had<br />
discussions with the Chairman of the Universities Commission and<br />
we established a very powerful sub-committee to advise on the<br />
problem of teaching hospitals, T1he sub--committee contained<br />
outside p) eople, medical men of great distinction and academic<br />
people of note. It made an examination and finally made to the<br />
Universities Corissrwon a report -r'hich I have seeon and which I<br />
may say this to the honourable membor for Melbourne Ports ( Mr.<br />
Crean) I hope I wiill. be able to have printed in adequate time<br />
beforc he has to resumzne the second-reading debate. The report is<br />
not actually ready at the imoment. There are on or two difficulties<br />
about it, Jhich I will mention.<br />
The sub committeo, wrhen it got co work on this problem,<br />
found, of course, that it had to divide the matter into two parts.<br />
One was the capital oxpnditue that would be requirod if the<br />
Commonwealth, making its œ 1 for œ 1 grant to the States, was going<br />
to take on that proportion of the responsibility for capital<br />
equi.-pment needed for this extended university function in a<br />
teaching hospital. Honourable imembers will see particularized in the<br />
schedule to bill the items that are involved under that heading.<br />
We propose in this to adopt that portion of the sub-committee's<br />
recommendations and to provide on a : U for œ 1 basis the money<br />
required to carry out the capital programme that the members have<br />
in mind a very substantial one, but a very important one,<br />
Honourable members may ask thrmsulves, as indeed I did when I read<br />
this report, how i. t comes about that so much capital expenditure<br />
needs to be made at this stage to equip teaching hospitals for<br />
their work The answer to that luary is that medical science<br />
changes year by year. Noew methods are dovised and new fors of<br />
equipment are needed.,<br />
Incidentally, when a new univorsity is set un you can<br />
get most acute probleos, To give an example, I take my own<br />
State, which I know best. In Victoria in the past the University<br />
of Melbeurne conducted its mdical school ope-rations in at least<br />
two hospitals, the Ro yal M; elbourne H. sital and the Alfred<br />
Hospital, In oach of thc elinical classes woer conducted and in<br />
each of then the instructors did their werk, A new university<br />
the Monash Univcrsity has boon established and it is to have a<br />
meodical school </p>
<p>If it is to have a medical school which is to be offective it must<br />
have a hospital in which its senior moeical students can do their<br />
clinical work and receive t hir clinical instruction.<br />
The result will be that, whereas in the past the<br />
University of Melbourne has had accoss to the teaching hospitals<br />
within its own area, in the future, when Mionash is completely<br />
establishod, these will have to be divided. The Royal Molbourne<br />
Hospital, for example, will remain with the University of<br />
Melbourne and the Alfrod Hospital will go to the Monash University.<br />
I do not need to tell honourable members that when that<br />
kind of thing happens you cannot throw up new hospitals overnight.<br />
The fact is that to accormenodate in one of these hospitals more<br />
students than it has over had to dcal with before, because of the<br />
demands of other universities, you will need to establish new<br />
buildings, new equipeont and new matters that are required for the<br />
teaching of perhaps twice as many students in the hospital as were<br />
taught befo:. o. If honourablo members will be good enough to run<br />
their eyes over the schedule to the bill they will see the nature<br />
of the things which are involved,<br />
Mr. Crean I do not know whether your schedule is the same as mine<br />
but rine has not pages 9 and 10. It goes straight from page 8 to<br />
page 11.<br />
vMENZIES Oh doarJ Do not bla Le me for that. I will look at<br />
the one I have been working on. It is marked '" Confidential", so<br />
perhaps I have been given something different, ;! hat pages are you<br />
. acking?<br />
Mr. Croan Pages 9 and<br />
MR . MENZIES They are in my confidential draft. There has been<br />
some discrimination Lhero in favour of fellows on the Governmont<br />
side. I am sorry about that. TJe will see that you get a proper<br />
copyo<br />
Mr. Crean Thank you. I have now been given an adjusted copy.<br />
MR. MENZIES That is a comfort. I would have hated to think<br />
there was some discrimination against yeu.<br />
Coning to the capital side, all I want to say is that<br />
honourable members will agrco that the great movement in<br />
assistance to university training would not have been complete<br />
unless we had decided to take a nove for rard into this extra<br />
provision for teaching hospitals run in association with the<br />
univursities. On the other point, recurrent expenditure, a report<br />
was made. It is frightfully difficult to determine, as members<br />
will understand, hor to divide up the rocurrent expenditure in<br />
hospitals between teaching and ordinary hospitalization. What<br />
percentage of the, tiie of the nurses is to be reg: arded as<br />
attributable to teaching and clinical instruction? How much would<br />
be -ttributable to the normal conduct of the business of the<br />
hospital and so on? I want to say quite frankly that we are at<br />
the moment not entirely satisfied with that branch of the report<br />
that was made, I have had a conference of a very friendly kind, I<br />
hasten to say with the chairman of the Universities Commission<br />
and with the very distinguished Prof ossor Sutherland, from<br />
Melbourne, who was a rme~ ber of this conmittee, and the Treasury.<br />
At this moment work is being done by the officials of the<br />
Treasury, ~ ry officials and representatives of the Universities<br />
Com~~ ission to se whethr such pints of difference as arise in<br />
relation to rocurrent itoiLs can be worked out and accommodated, </p>
<p>4.<br />
That is not a matter of urgency, although we do not propose to<br />
delay it. The urgent matter is the provision of the capital<br />
equipment, and therefore I thought it would be wise to get on with<br />
tne thing that was urgent and not to hold it up until the next<br />
sittings of Parliament, when we wuld have the recurrent problem<br />
worked out. I will, in the spring session, if I survive so long,<br />
present a second measure dealing with recurrent expenditure<br />
attributable to the medical schools. I was going to say that I<br />
am full of hope on that matter, but perhaps that is an entirely<br />
unnecessary remark to make. </p>
