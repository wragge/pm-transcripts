CEKAGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
HON. R. J. L. HAWKE M. P.<br />
ALL JAPAN CHAMBERS OF COMMCE<br />
TOKYO 20 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
With every return visit to Tokyo and Japan and this is now<br />
my fourth visit as Prime Minister of Australia this city<br />
and this country impress me anew with their sense of<br />
heightened energy and self-confidence.<br />
Japan is truly at the leading edge of technology and<br />
industry, and to visit Japan is to recognise how those human<br />
skills created what has become one of the most dynamic,<br />
productive and powerful economies of the world.<br />
So let me at the outset thank the All Japan Chambers of<br />
Commerce for its generous invitation to address this<br />
gathering and to talk with you about the future of the<br />
Australia-Japan economic relationship.<br />
It is now some decades since Australia and Japan recognised<br />
the close complementarity of our economies and embarked on<br />
the development of what has become for both of us an<br />
extraordinarily important and lucrative trading<br />
relationship.<br />
The statistics of this trade speak for themselves: the<br />
two-way exchange of goods between us last year was worth<br />
trillion yen more than A$ 23 billion.<br />
Through good years and bad, Australia has been a stable and<br />
reliable supplier of essential commodities that fuel Japan's<br />
industry to name the most important, coal, iron ore,<br />
aluminium and, recently, LNG. And we are increasingly a<br />
provider of quality foodstuffs to help feed Japan's people.<br />
In exchange, Japanese manufacturers have supplied an<br />
extraordinary diversity of sophisticated goods to Australian<br />
consumers and industries: motor vehicles, manufacturing and<br />
telecommunications equipment, electrical goods, computers.<br />
What started out as a straightforward exchange of<br />
commodities for manufactures has progressively diversified<br />
to embrace a broader range of goods, services, technologies,<br />
investments and people. </p>
<p>Every day, for example, an increasing number of Japanese<br />
tourists enjoy Australia's unique landscape and way of life.<br />
I take this opportunity to emphasise how welcome these<br />
visitors are to Australia; tourism is not just an<br />
increasingly important export industry for us but a valued<br />
means of building personal contacts and international<br />
understanding. Further diversification is essential if we are to build a<br />
broader, richer, deeper relationship between our two<br />
countries. We must look for new activities, new opportunities to work<br />
together, new forms of participation in each other's<br />
economies. We must look beyond the simple 19th Century<br />
economics of comparative advantage. And we are.<br />
Only yesterday I visited the premises in Yokohama of MEMTEC,<br />
an Australian high technology firm that is turning the<br />
traditional Japan-Australia relationship on its head by<br />
breaking into the competitive Japanese market and doing<br />
very well.<br />
So for Australia's part, there is no doubt that we can play<br />
our part.<br />
Indeed I want to tell you direct that we can engage we are<br />
already engaging Japan, the region, and the world, on new<br />
and more competitive terms.<br />
Over the last seven years we have undertaken a fundamental<br />
and in many ways a radical reshaping both of the<br />
institutions of our economy and of the attitudes we bring to<br />
our involvement in our dynamic region and in our<br />
interdependent world.<br />
We still have some way to go down the path of domestic<br />
reform to ensure that we enter the next century as a truly<br />
competitive and capable player.<br />
But the pace of change so far has been such as to render<br />
completely out of date the stereotypes that portrayed the<br />
Australian economy in previous decades, with considerable<br />
accuracy as frequently unreliable, usually complacent and<br />
essentially inward looking.<br />
So part of my message to this audience today is an urgent<br />
call for you to re-examine your attitudes towards us and<br />
recognise the contemporary realities of your re-equipped and<br />
vigorous Australian trading partners.<br />
Let me give you a sketch portrait of this restructured<br />
Australia by outlining the principal economic reforms we<br />
have achieved since 1983 reforms which fit together into a<br />
consistent, comprehensive and continuing strategy to<br />
internationalise the Australian economy. </p>
<p>We have abolished exchange controls; and we have floated the<br />
Australian dollar. we have deregulated the financial<br />
markets, removed most restrictions on foreign investment,<br />
and reduced by a third the level of tariff protection<br />
afforded to Australian manufacturers. We have opened up the<br />
Australian economy to competition from overseas to an extent<br />
that is without precedent in modern Australian history.<br />
We are building the basis of a ' clever country', to open up<br />
new possibilities for what traditionally has been just the<br />
' lucky country'. We are improving our education systems and<br />
we are dramatically expanding our research and development<br />
skills. You may be interested to know that Australia has a<br />
higher per capita number of students learning Japanese, at<br />
primary, secondary and tertiary levels, than any other<br />
country outside Japan itself.<br />
We are restructuring Australia's telecommunications, our<br />
civil aviation, our land transport and our waterfront to<br />
make them more competitive and responsive to contemporary<br />
market and social needs.<br />
For our trading partners, these changes are very good news.<br />
To give an example, shipping reforms will progressively put<br />
the operating costs and manning levels of Australian-flagged<br />
shipping on a par with those of our major trading partners.<br />
Let me make special mention of industrial relations.<br />
Not so long ago, some of our trading partners, including<br />
Japan, used to express concern over Australia's industrial<br />
relations record and questioned our reliability as a trading<br />
partner. Today such concerns are out of date; the attitudes of our<br />
trading partners need to catch up with contemporary reality.<br />
Since coming to office in 1983, my Government has fostered a<br />
new, cooperative approach to industrial relations, the<br />
cornerstone of which has been the Prices and Incomes Accord<br />
between the Government and the trade union movement.<br />
The results of this approach have been nothing short of<br />
dramatic.<br />
Under the Accord, non-farm real unit labour costs have<br />
fallen by more than 10 per cent since 1983, helping to<br />
reduce our inflation rate, increase investment and restore<br />
profitability to Australian companies.<br />
Again, the Accord period has seen Australia enjoy sustained<br />
economic growth, averaging around 4 per cent over the past<br />
seven years, and outstanding employment growth, with the<br />
creation of over 1.6 million jobs since 1983 a rate of<br />
employment growth nearly double the OECD average. </p>
<p>At the same time, we have cut by nearly 60 per cent the<br />
average number of days lost due to industrial disputes;<br />
Australia's strike record now compares very favourably with<br />
that of other OECD nations.<br />
The Accord mechanism is also facilitating the most<br />
fundamental reforms of labour markets Australia has ever<br />
witnessed: comprehensive restructuring of industrial awards<br />
and extensive rationalisation of trade unions and trade<br />
union coverage are truly seeing the development and<br />
maintenance of internationally competitive Australian<br />
industries.<br />
So after more than seven years of radical improvement in<br />
Australia's industrial relations, the truth now is that<br />
Australia's trade union movement is a positive factor, not a<br />
negative, encouraging economic growth and competitiveness in<br />
Australia, not holding it back.<br />
When that truth is better realised by our trading partners<br />
we shall see further real improvement in the state of our<br />
economic relationship.<br />
I can assure you, from my own informed knowledge of the<br />
trade union movement, that potential investors who discuss<br />
their plans in advance with trade unions will find them<br />
prepared to enter into specific understandings and<br />
commitments to ensure the success of their projects.<br />
My friends<br />
As proud as we are of this record of change over the last<br />
seven years, we are not resting on our laurels. Continuing<br />
international developments Europe 1992, the return of<br />
Eastern Europe to market systems, the ending of the Cold War<br />
mean the management of economic change must be a primary<br />
objective for us all.<br />
Immediately on my return to Australia I will be engaging in<br />
a series of policy initiatives that demonstrate our<br />
continuing commitment to change and reform.<br />
Within a few weeks my Government will be making a major<br />
statement on reform of telecommunications and aviation.<br />
Next month I will be chairing the first in a series of<br />
special conferences of State Premiers to examine ways of<br />
improving the processes of government itself. Over nine<br />
decades our Federal Constitution has given rise to a range<br />
of inefficiencies; existing institutions have not proven<br />
able to handle effectively the issues currently coming<br />
before Government. So the State Premiers and I have<br />
commenced a major work program that will be given direction<br />
and impetus by this first conference. </p>
<p>And next year I will receive the first reports from nine<br />
working groups developing a strategy for ecologically<br />
sustainable development working groups we established<br />
because we believe that we must have further resource<br />
development but that without environmentally responsible<br />
policies we will be failing in our responsibilities to<br />
future generations of Australians.<br />
These reforms proof of our commitment to, and our capacity<br />
for, far-reaching economic and social change in Australia<br />
carry clear implications for this audience, and for Japanese<br />
business leaders generally.<br />
Australia is progressively becoming a more capable, vigorous<br />
and competitive economy. It follows that Australia's<br />
relationship with Japan needs to reflect that progress.<br />
We certainly have a broader and more diverse relationship<br />
now than we did even a few years ago. But the process has<br />
still not gone far enough; we still have much to do to make<br />
sure the opportunities that await us are fully taken up.<br />
It may have been appropriate, in the days when Australians<br />
hid behind high tariff barriers and indulged ourselves with<br />
poor industrial relations, for Japanese investors to steer<br />
clear of major commitments in the Australian manufacturing<br />
sector. It is no longer so.<br />
It may have been appropriate in the days of Australia's weak<br />
research and development commitment f or Japanese businesses<br />
to neglect Australia as a potential partner in science and<br />
technology based ventures.<br />
Tourism, including from Japan, is a major growth industry<br />
for us. But we do not see ourselves solely as a purveyor of<br />
leisure services. In the same way, the vast preponderance<br />
of Japanese investment in Australia is in real estate. But<br />
we do not see particular economic advantage in selling real<br />
estate as an end in itself.<br />
Of the $ 9 billion currently invested by Japan in Australia,<br />
some 92 per cent is invested in tourism and real estate.<br />
It is time for you to be more creative in your approach to<br />
investment in Australia and to joint ventures with us.<br />
Together we could become productive partners in increasing<br />
the value-added component of Australian exports and<br />
expanding our export-oriented manufactures and services. We<br />
want to see more successes like MEMTEC here in Japan and<br />
elsewhere because that's what we can do well now.<br />
I don't say that you should do us a favour; I say it is in<br />
your interests too, to diversify your relationship with us.<br />
Of course I know I am speaking in a nation that has shown an<br />
extraordinary ability to adjust to changed circumstances.<br />
You truly know what it takes to build and to maintain a<br />
dynamic economy. </p>
<p>But you must be in no doubt of your continued need f or<br />
further adaptation, further internationalising of your<br />
economy and further flexibility in more areas of your<br />
economy and society.<br />
The policies of greater internationalism that you have<br />
pursued and which we urge you to continue will of<br />
themselves lead to further pressures for openness and<br />
transparency within Japanese markets and distribution<br />
systems, and for greater political and social interaction<br />
with the rest of the world.<br />
As a global economi c superpower, your newly acquired<br />
leadership role entails a vital responsibility: the<br />
responsibility for continued flexibility and further<br />
openness in your domestic economic arrangements.<br />
Nowhere is this more true than in the area of agricultural<br />
protection. We appreciate the extent to which Japan recently<br />
part-liberalised its market in beef.<br />
But it is high time Japan started taking reasonable steps to<br />
liberalise your rice market. I say that out of no direct<br />
self-interest; Australia is not a major rice grower. I say<br />
it because as we approach the critical final negotiating<br />
stages of the Uruguay Round, a commitment to agricultural<br />
reform will be essential to a successful outcome. That<br />
includes, of course, a commitment by the European community<br />
as well as Japan.<br />
Let me say bluntly that the self-sufficiency argument made<br />
by Japan in defence of its agricultural protection stands<br />
very awkwardly indeed with its tremendous successes as an<br />
international trader in non-food goods.<br />
I realise of course the considerable domestic difficulties<br />
that stand in the way of early reform.<br />
Hay I suggest that in overcoming these problems the lesson<br />
of the Australian experience may be valuable.<br />
For I do not pretend for a moment that the changes achieved<br />
by my Government radical changes in the life of any<br />
society have been achieved simply or without pain.<br />
Our reforms cut deep into habits and institutions that had<br />
become entrenched elements of an increasingly uncompetitive<br />
society. Industries that had become lazy because they were protected<br />
by tariff walls, trade unions that indulged in petty<br />
industrial disputes, ideologues and traditionalists who were<br />
committed to old-fashioned ways of doing things such<br />
groups have at times been critics of change at times,<br />
strident critics. </p>
<p>But we are succeeding in our reforms ordinary working<br />
Australians have made sacrifices including real wage cuts<br />
because we have demonstrated that they are essential<br />
elements of a broad, logical and essential strategy of<br />
building national competitiveness in a global economic<br />
environment of interdependence.<br />
In the same way, reform within Japan of domestic<br />
agricultural protection to name but one very important<br />
area will prompt vocal criticism. But as I said yesterday<br />
in a speech to members of the Japanese Diet, your capacity<br />
to achieve reform in this area will be a true, and<br />
appropriate, test of Japanese leadership credentials<br />
generally. My friends<br />
I know I have spoken directly about Australian achievements<br />
and Japanese requirements; I always believe that the<br />
opportunity presented to address an audience such as this<br />
should not be wasted on platitudes.<br />
And I do not ignore the burden that lies on Australian<br />
shoulders to continue the process of adapting our economy<br />
and ourselves to the challenges of the world.<br />
The truth is, if Australia wants the benefits promised by<br />
closer economic integration with Japan and other dynamic<br />
economies in the Asia-Pacific region, we have to accept that<br />
those benefits can be achieved only by making our economy<br />
more competitive, our society more open, and our minds more<br />
free of prejudice and stereotype.<br />
Yet there is in some quarters of our society, as in many<br />
societies, a streak of xenophobia. Some Australians,<br />
contemplating Japanese investment in our country, have<br />
failed to overcome the trauma of wartime memories. Others<br />
misinterpret any foreign investment as an abrogation of<br />
Australian sovereignty or dispute the economic gains of such<br />
investment.<br />
But I emphasise that these attitudes are minority ones in a<br />
society that is at ease with a multicultural future and,<br />
overall, quite comfortable about the Australia-Japan<br />
relationship. We welcome productive foreign investment on<br />
its merits and regardless of its source.<br />
That is why we welcome the Japanese proposal for the<br />
Multifunction Polis to encourage the transfer of new<br />
technology from Japan into Australia. An excellent site has<br />
been chosen in Adelaide and the MFP has the backing of my<br />
Government, the State Government of South Australia and of<br />
private enterprise. </p>
<p>0'<br />
8.<br />
Unfortunately, the proposal was at one point needlessly put<br />
at risk by the kinds of prejudices I have described. Let me<br />
say without qualification: such prejudices have no<br />
legitimate place in Australian society; I will never resile<br />
from that view.<br />
Australians will continue to adapt and will continue to<br />
create a tolerant, cosmopolitan and multicultural society<br />
whose door is open to international contacts free of any<br />
discrimination on the grounds of race. To do otherwise<br />
would be both morally repugnant and economically insane.<br />
My friends<br />
Japan and Australia stand on the threshold of a new phase in<br />
our relationship that can be even closer, more complex, more<br />
mature and more diverse than it already is.<br />
The challenge that now faces both of us in developing a more<br />
diverse and intimate relationship is really a test-case for<br />
each of us in developing our wider international roles.<br />
If we get it right if we can develop a mature and<br />
broad-minded approach which works effectively and is<br />
sustainable simply because it takes account of both sides'<br />
interests we can look forward to a greatly expanded and<br />
even more harmonious process of building prosperity<br />
prosperity that embraces our two countries, and<br />
that extends through our region and to the wider<br />
world.<br />
I am confident we will succeed in that task. </p>
