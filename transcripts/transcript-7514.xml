TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 3 MARCH<br />
1989 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I understand you would like me to make a brief<br />
statement about the housing thing and then any questions<br />
you'd like to put to me. The purpose of the conference I've<br />
already outlined and essentially the simple fact is that you<br />
can't put more people into housing if you haven't got more<br />
houses and the constraint on that situation is obviously on<br />
the supply side, particularly in regard to land. And it's<br />
because of the shortage of land that we've had the basic<br />
increase in prices. Let me point out to you that during<br />
1988 if we look at the situation Australia wide there is a<br />
increase in median house prices, 35%. In that period<br />
interest rates increased by about That is interest<br />
rates for housing of around 14%, at the end of the year<br />
around 15%. In other words a 7% increase in interest rates<br />
which was about in line with average weekly earnings but the<br />
average price of houses went up by about 35%. In other<br />
words you've got a situation where supply has simply not<br />
been able to keep up with the underlying demand and that's<br />
been reflected in the increase in prices. And so it's in<br />
that situation that on behalf of the Commonwealth today I<br />
and my Ministers will be putting forward a number of<br />
significant initiatives at this conference dealing with what<br />
therefore is the essence of the problem.<br />
We will be announcing a major program of Commonwealth land<br />
sales for housing development. We will announce around<br />
27,000 blocks over the next five years and as you heard me<br />
say yesterday in the Parliament that's equivalent to about<br />
new suburbs and we'll make available about another 40,000<br />
blocks over the following five to ten years and Minister<br />
Stewart West will be releasing details of the blocks today.<br />
We are also going to be announcing a program of measures<br />
directed really at four associated issues. That is land<br />
supply is one, building regulations, land regulations, and<br />
local government approval processes. we'll be seeking<br />
cooperation from the States in implementing and funding of<br />
that package. AS far as we're concerned we'll be proposing<br />
to put about $ 8.8M over the next three years in regard to<br />
these programs and we'll be seeking in respect of some of<br />
those matching funding from the States. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
In those areas that I've mentioned, those four areas, that<br />
is of land supply, building regulations, land regulations<br />
and local government approval processes, five measures are<br />
involved in what we'll be putting up.<br />
Firstly, a three year program of work to redress<br />
inadequacies in the availability of data on land supply and<br />
the composition of demand to be undertaken by the Indicative<br />
Planning Council for the housing industry.<br />
Secondly, a joint program under which financial and<br />
technical assistance will be provided over the next three<br />
years to local government to review technical residential<br />
land development regulations.<br />
Thirdly, a program to promote demonstration studies,<br />
cooperation, research and information, dissemination<br />
designed to stimulate improvement in the adminstrative<br />
aspects of approval processes at the local government level.<br />
Fourthly, the setting up of an expert task force to examine<br />
the scope for significant reforms of technical regulation of<br />
building codes and standards. It is hoped to involve local<br />
government, the design profession, as well as the building<br />
industry itself.<br />
And fifthly, resources will be devoted to create the<br />
capacity for the analysis and the development of policy in<br />
relation to housing supply within the Department of<br />
Industry, Technology and Commerce.<br />
They are the five specific measures which will be involved<br />
in this provision of some almost $ 9M by us over the next<br />
three years. You can see each of those measures are<br />
directed towards the supply side constraint that I have<br />
identified as the major source of the problem.<br />
In addition the Commonwealth recently increased its<br />
contribution to the joint venture for more affordable<br />
housing and I found it particularly interesting this last<br />
couple of weeks as we've been preparing for this conference<br />
to find out particularly as we had that meeting last week<br />
with various representatives of the industry and local<br />
government just how universally respected has been this<br />
joint venture for more affordable housing. have been<br />
quite clearly effected in demonstrating a wider range of<br />
housing choices and the use of more innovative building and<br />
land devlopment techniques.<br />
Now the other area of course in talking about the supply<br />
side constraints is the supply of skilled labour and that as<br />
I say is another significant constraint. Accordingly the<br />
Commonwealth concluded arrangements with the NSW division of<br />
the Housing Industry Association on 30 January which<br />
provided for immigration of a maximum of 225 workers in the </p>
<p>( PM cont): building trades in the period to 30 June 1990 in<br />
return for an increased apprenticeship training commitment.<br />
Further consultation between the Government and industry<br />
groups including the Housing Industry Association, the ACTU<br />
and the building unions with a view to developing a national<br />
arrangement. The building and construction industry took<br />
place in February of this year and we hope to explore the<br />
potential for these sorts of initiatives today at the<br />
conference. Now I conclude by making the obvious point that the major<br />
responsibility for the supply side matters, which is at the<br />
core of the problem, lies with the State and local<br />
government. The rate of release of tracts of land, the<br />
system of zoning and development control is also largely<br />
developed and determined by State and local government. So<br />
we will be seeking from the States a firm indication of<br />
measures that they are prepared to take regarding both land<br />
release and land use. I conclude those observations by<br />
making this point. I understand that you know we live in a<br />
rough and tough political world. I'm not upset by the fact<br />
that in the period leading up to this conference today with<br />
the Premiers that there has been some political point<br />
scoring that's being carried on in some quarters, that's I<br />
suppose par for the course. But I want to make the point<br />
that as far as the Commonwealth is concerned we are very<br />
serious about this issue as I think has been proven by the<br />
work we've put into it we are making very, very concrete,<br />
relevant, specific proposals which at our level of<br />
government will help with this problem and I certainly hope<br />
that we will receive and I expect to receive from my State<br />
colleagues an equally constructive approach.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the States don't give guarantees on building<br />
regulations, land regulations, and what the Government<br />
approvals, will the Commonwealth be prepared to offer<br />
parcels of land to private enterprise?<br />
PM: We want as a first step to make the land available<br />
certainly the large tracts that we've been talking about, we<br />
want to make them available to the States but we will be<br />
making it clear that we don't want them then just to sit on<br />
it. We have the situation, for instance, in Victoria where<br />
there's some parcels of land that we made available two<br />
years or so ago which is still not developed. So we will be<br />
saying that we want a fast track development of land that we<br />
make available. If we can't get satisfactory undertakings<br />
on that well then you would obviously be thinking about<br />
making it immediately available in the other way.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is there any way today that you<br />
would agree to discuss the problem of high interest rates,<br />
perhaps tax concessions for savings, that sort of question? </p>
<p>PM: Well let me put it this way. We've got our items on<br />
the agenda, then item five I think is other business. Now I<br />
don't want to be silly about this, but I don't think anyone<br />
can argue, I mean you look at the statistics I have given<br />
you, the 35 percent increase in housing prices and seven<br />
percent increase in interest rates. No-one argues that the<br />
essential core of the problem is on the supply side and in<br />
terms of what we can do together as Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments, that's the area that the emphasis must be on,<br />
it's where we can have a constructive input to help in<br />
co-operation with the States. So we want those things<br />
discussed. Now if under the other item they want to go to<br />
some of these other matters, well obviously we're going to<br />
listen to what they have got to say. But we should get our<br />
priorities right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister the flip side, if you like, of<br />
the increase in value of houses, is that the State<br />
Governments have received enormous windfall profits by<br />
virtue of stamp duty and so on. Do you think they've been<br />
remiss in not turning that over into land releases or land<br />
supply and servicing?<br />
PM: Well I don't just necessarily relate the two. I mean,<br />
in a sense, your question implies that this had almost been<br />
a hypothication by them, because they got it out of that<br />
source it would have been sensible to then relate for the<br />
increase in income to those processes. Well they would<br />
argue that they have other demands upon their increased<br />
resources. They would probably argue too that we have asked<br />
them to exercise restraint in general public fiscal policy,<br />
as we have. We've cut back on their resources to some<br />
extent, not as far as we have cut back on our own, but I<br />
think it is the case that they have done well out of the<br />
boom. But I would hope that they take the view that their<br />
citizens would do very much better overall in a situation<br />
where prices weren't booming like that. obviously if you<br />
take the overall view there is no benefit to the citizens of<br />
their States, the citizens of Australia in allowing a<br />
situation to continue which 35 percent increases in housing<br />
prices, on the basis well we get something on the go-by in<br />
stamp duty. I don't think that will be their attitude.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is there a case for reviewing<br />
immigration because of the effect on housing demand?<br />
PM: That's a good question. There is no doubt that the<br />
level of immigration which is running in the order of<br />
140,000, there's no doubt no-one can honestly and sensibly<br />
argue that that doesn't impose additional strains on the<br />
demand side. obviously it does. It would be easy to say,<br />
alright well cut out immigration and that will reduce<br />
demand, but in governing this country you don't, in my </p>
<p>( PM cont): judgement at least, think merely of pressures<br />
and forces of today. We're a country now of just over 16.5<br />
million people in a world, I'd remind you, which is rapidly<br />
approaching six billion. Now it's my judgement that if<br />
we're trying to think about the future of this country we<br />
really do need to be understanding that I think there's some<br />
sort of, I don't know whether you'd call it a critical mass,<br />
but I think we've got to be thinking in terms as we go into<br />
the next century, in terms of 20 million. I don't think<br />
we're going to be able to sensibly and most beneficially<br />
develop all our resources in the absence of a significant<br />
increase in our population. I remind you that if you look<br />
over the last four years the rate of natural increase has<br />
averaged about .8 percent, now less than 1 percent in<br />
natural increase. That's very low and therefore we are very<br />
reliant, in terms of increasing our population, upon<br />
immigration. I recognise that there are legitimate<br />
arguments in this area, particularly in the short term. I<br />
don't think that good Government is just about being<br />
dominated by short term considerations. In the end, when<br />
you think about it, in a country of this size, supply of<br />
land for housing shouldn't be a problem.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can I clarify that 8.8 million?<br />
Is this for joint venture development with the States<br />
PM: I listed the five measures and to develop those five<br />
measures like the three year program to redress inadequacies<br />
in the availability of data, joint program under which<br />
substantial and technical assistance would be available over<br />
the next three years to local government to review its<br />
technical residential zoning, it's those sorts of programs,<br />
those five programs. Taking those together we'll be<br />
prepared to put in about $ 8 million, just under $ 9 million.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just while we're getting the figures right,<br />
percent increase in the home prices, interest rates up seven<br />
percent, what period are you talking about there?<br />
PM: 1988. Last year, calendar year ' 88.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how long do you think it will take<br />
before your proposals, your iniatives today will have an<br />
impact on land prices?<br />
PM: Well, the honest answer is I can't say. I mean whether<br />
it will take one month, one year. I would hope though that<br />
once it is clear that there is going to be this very<br />
significant increase in the availability of land as a result<br />
of our initiatives and if you take the most optimistic view<br />
that we get very positive response from the States in regard<br />
to accelerating the processes of land release and zoning,<br />
then I think you're into a different climate. The<br />
expectations will change, but it would be quite dishonest </p>
<p>-6-<br />
( PM cont): for me to say, well look within one month or two<br />
months, I can't put a figure on it, but we will have I think<br />
changed the culture and turned it around. I repeat the<br />
comment I just made. I find it rather frustrating to be in<br />
a situation where in a country of this dimension,<br />
physically, that the basic problem in this soaring home<br />
price situation, is land availability. It doesn't make very<br />
much sense.<br />
JOURNALIST: You've been asked a couple of times recently<br />
about your comments in Western Australia on interest<br />
rates, that they wouldn't go up before they came down. Do<br />
you think in retrospect that comment was ill-judged or just<br />
a mistake or how do you view it?<br />
PM: I don't retract from the basic point I made that before<br />
the end of this year it's my belief they will come down. In<br />
the situation that we've been faced with since then we have<br />
been hit by circumstances which in two respects I think were<br />
unexpected and in the inflation area I've simply got to say<br />
that on all the advice available to me Michelle I was<br />
operating on the assumption of a December quarter price<br />
index rise significantly less than the 2.1% that in fact<br />
emerged. What came out was the sort of advice that I<br />
had and which was operating was an outcome of less than<br />
in the area of perhaps of 1.25% and that was part of what<br />
had formed my thinking. We also had the much worse balance<br />
of payments situations than one had hoped for. So all I can<br />
say is that my economic intellectual framework within which<br />
I was speaking was one which was, in regard to the key<br />
indicator of expected inflation outcomes, significantly more<br />
optimistic than in fact turned out to be the case.<br />
JOURNALIST: In recent correspondence with Mr Greiner you<br />
offered to negotiations on a wide agenda of housing<br />
issues and interest rates Can you tell us what form<br />
these negotiations will take?<br />
PM: It's a matter for Mr Greiner. If he wants to suggest<br />
how he'd like to process such discussions work it out<br />
between us. You can see from what I'm saying I don't<br />
take the position that all these other considerations<br />
haven't got a relevance, of course they have. But you want<br />
to say what's the criticially important thing and no-one can<br />
argue with the analysis I've put to the critically important<br />
thing, that's on the supply side. That's why we're<br />
concentrating on that now. We can work out timetables and<br />
procedures for discussing any other matters that he wants<br />
to. In six years in government I think you'll find the<br />
successive state premiers will say to you if they want to<br />
have a talk to me I'm always available. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Greiner argues though that even though<br />
having all this land made available unless there's<br />
infrastructure provided and he said build that<br />
infrastructure. Will the Commonwealth help by providing<br />
funds for roads and sewerage and<br />
PM: We work those things out in the Premiers' conference,<br />
the Loan Council meeting and the fact is that the States<br />
have to make priority decisions in the use of their money.<br />
But obviously in the consideration that we give as a<br />
Commonwealth in the lead up to the Premiers' conference, the<br />
Loan Council meeting, we won't be making decisions which<br />
make it impossible for States to discharge the duties they<br />
have in providing infrastructure. I don't believe we've<br />
done that to this point. We won't start doing it in the<br />
future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will there be any though?<br />
PM: Of course today's not about it's not a Loan Council<br />
meeting or a Premiers' conference.<br />
JOURNALIST: the Premiers' conference to increase funds<br />
to the States for this area?<br />
PM: What happens at the Premiers' conference and the Loan<br />
Council meetings is that they plead their cases with very<br />
great vigour not always I might say with hindsight with<br />
great accuracy. I always have a bit of a laugh to myself<br />
when you come to the end of the States' financial year and I<br />
always compare outcomes with what they tell me is going to<br />
happen, they are going to finish up with deficits you can't<br />
poke a stick at. Somehow or other they seem to manage to<br />
finish up in a way very differently to the picture that's<br />
presented at the Premiers' conference and Loan Council. I<br />
don't complain about that, I suppose that's good bargaining.<br />
What we try and do as a Commonwealth is to make the best<br />
assessment we can of, from our point of view, what resources<br />
need to be applied to enable them to discharge the basic and<br />
important function that you referred to. We won't change<br />
from that.<br />
JOURNALIST: So it's not necessary, further funds this year?<br />
PM: Premiers' conference. We're now in March, the<br />
Premiers' conference and Loan Council will be held at the<br />
outside within about three months. We're not having<br />
JOURNALIST: PM: We're not having a special Premiers' conference or Loan<br />
Council meeting to do that. We're leading up to that almost<br />
now. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have a rough figure of how many people<br />
might be housed in the 15 new suburbs?<br />
PM: If you say there's 27,000 blocks, just work out your<br />
sums. I don't have to do that do I?<br />
PM: On another matter, you've asked your ministers for some<br />
possible suggestions to be put into the April statement.<br />
How broad would you like that to be and how broad do you<br />
think it is possible to make it?<br />
PM: When you say I've asked for possible suggestions I've<br />
given much firmer leadership than that. I have myself<br />
indicated areas that I think are possible of inclusion and<br />
work will be done on those. I don't intend to go to those<br />
areas prior to the April statement. I'm conducting this<br />
business of the Government in the way it should be. I meet<br />
with my ministers, I say here are things we ought to<br />
consider for possible inclusion, the work is being done on<br />
it. It will be announced in the statement.<br />
JOURNALIST: It's now a quite broad statement is it?<br />
PM: I think Michelle it will be somewhat broader than some<br />
people were thinking. A lot of people were thinking it was<br />
just going to be an announcement of tax cuts. I think<br />
you'll find there'll be more in it than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you worried that this might create false<br />
expectation in the community?<br />
PM: No I'm not. If I allowed myself to be worried by the<br />
process of government that some people like to have, that is<br />
that the press and this is not said critically I mean if<br />
you run something in the press and then what's in the press<br />
is not what we do, if I were worried about that I would've<br />
been insane years ago. We don't run government like that.<br />
It's unfortunate that you have at times quite unfounded<br />
speculation about what's going to be done but we just go<br />
about the business of doing what we think is necessary. I<br />
don't believe if you look back Heather over the period of<br />
the six years that our May statements and budgets have been<br />
disappointing in content. I don't think it will be this<br />
time. JOURNALIST: These areas are on the structural side though<br />
rather than the spending cut side.<br />
PM: I repeat what I said, I'm not going to announce the<br />
April statement now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you concerned about the leaks on these<br />
issues out of Cabinet, ERC and Structural Adjustment<br />
Committee? </p>
