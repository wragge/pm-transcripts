    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: Well, we're out here on Barrow Island, which is off the WA coast, about 70 or 80 kilometres off, and with some of the workers here who are going to be putting together a $50 billion project for Australia. It'll be done by next Thursday, won't it fellas</p>
<p>May taker a little longer than that, but it's been to chat with some of the folk who are benefitting from Chevron's big investment here, and the other companies as well.</p>
<p>More importantly for Australia, huge addition to jobs nation wide - 10,000 direct and indirect jobs, good stuff for the future, and they don't serve a bad lunch either.</p>
