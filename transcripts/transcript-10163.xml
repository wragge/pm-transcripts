HISTORIC REFERRAL OF VICTORIA'S INDUSTRAL-RELATIONS<br />
POWERS TO THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
Today's in-principle agreement to refer Victoria's industrial relations powers to the<br />
Commonwealth is an historic first in the long history of industrial relations in Australia.<br />
It is also a ringing endorsement of the Federal Government's industrial relations<br />
reforms, It gives substance to the frequent calls of many to reduce the costly duplication of<br />
concurrent responsibilities in such a vital area.<br />
This practical example of co-operative Commonwealth/ State Relations will pave the<br />
way for the development of more flexible workplace arrangements focusing on the<br />
needs of individual enterprises.<br />
It will be of very real benefit to small and medium sized businesses in Victoria.<br />
As a result of today's decision, all Victorian employees and employers will be able to<br />
access the Federal industrial relations system without having to satisfy the requirement<br />
of an interstate dispute or any other constitutional obstacles.<br />
Victorian employers and employees will be free to remain under existing State<br />
arrangements or to choose to become subject to a federal award or agreement.<br />
This is a win-win for all involved.<br />
It means Victorian businesses will no longer face the time consuming and costly<br />
exercise of working with two different industrial relations systems.<br />
It means Victorian workers will be able to negotiate Australian Workplace Agreements<br />
and access the unfair dismissal provisions under the Workplace Relations Bill.<br />
It means the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments will be saved the complexity<br />
of admhnstering two entirely separate industrial relations systems.<br />
I look forward to securing the support of the Federal Paruliament in giving legislative<br />
effect to today's historic announcement.<br />
