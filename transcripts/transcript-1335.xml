FORMAL OPENING OF SEATO CONFERENCE BY THE RT HON HAROLD HO. ' MP',<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA/<br />
27TH JUNE, 1966 1MB<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Ladies an<br />
Gentlemen: It is an honour for me to be asked to open the 1966 SEATO<br />
Conference. I extend a warm welcome to you all on behalf of the<br />
Australian Government and people. This welcome embraces not<br />
only the Foreign Ministers and Delegations of countries with<br />
which we enjoy close and constructive relations both in SEATO<br />
and outside of it, but also the distinguished Secretary-General,<br />
General Vargas, and staff of the Organisation.<br />
Australia has become more conscious in recent times that,<br />
through geography, trade and circumstance, we are increasingly<br />
part of the Asian scene. Australia has good cause to value<br />
the existence of SEATO. It has been a solid pillar of security<br />
for us. We have honoured our own commitments to our colleagues<br />
of the Organisation, and we are grateful for the suipport given<br />
to SEATO's purposes by those members of the Organisation who have<br />
made much more massive contributions.<br />
There has been much talk of a " Domino Theory" in Asia,<br />
This propounds the view that if one country of South East Asia<br />
succumbs to Communist aggression, the others will topple in turn.<br />
We can claim, from its achievements, that SEATO has successfully<br />
applied the Domino Theory in reverse. We, and others of the area,<br />
have lived more securely: we have been able to plan more confidently<br />
for an expanding future. We have done so encouraged by<br />
the fact that SEATO provides a shield of protection and a means<br />
of constructive collaboration.<br />
The Asian countries of SEATO have been able to build<br />
their defences and strengthen their economies. The year under<br />
review provides further heartening proof to that supplied in<br />
other recent years that those countries of Asia under Communist<br />
threat can with outside help supplementing their own efforts<br />
meet that challenge and proceed to prosperous economic growth. </p>
<p>2<br />
We can point to countries of the region, some of them members of<br />
this Organisation, which have recorded notable gains of economic<br />
and social progress and are now advancing to new levels of<br />
achievement in an environment of stability. To those of us who<br />
live in the area there is inspiration in the visible evidences<br />
of improvement and progress. Some countries that I have visited<br />
recently seem transformed against my recollections of them in<br />
earlier years. What is also heartening has been the emergence of positive<br />
and constructive attitudes to international instrumentalities<br />
for economic co-operation. Although National sovereignty has<br />
only been attained by some within the last twenty years, they<br />
display a commendable readiness to work with others and create<br />
the institutions for co-operation. The newly-constituted Asian<br />
and Pacific Council and the Asian Development Bank are welcome<br />
examples.<br />
We have welcomed also the generous undertaking by the United States<br />
to make a Billion Dollar contribution towards economic development<br />
in South East Asia. Developments such as these reflect a spirit<br />
of hope more widely felt throughout the region.<br />
Even in the heat of Military contest in South Vietnam,<br />
there are practical programmes being evolved for better times<br />
ahead. There is the ferment of change in Asia to-day. The restlessness<br />
and turbulence give rise to the more dramatic episodes<br />
which are widely publicised. But these are only aspects of<br />
dynamic forces, some of them much more favourable, shaping<br />
dramatic movements in human affairs affecting the whole world. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
SEATO has its critics, and, of course, it has its imperfections,<br />
but the fact is that since its formation, it has held<br />
Communism at bay. From South Vietnam, one of the SEATO<br />
Protocol States, where the thrust of aggression has been<br />
fiercest, we are now receiving much more hopeful reports. But<br />
while we have strengthened the foundations of our security,<br />
the need for SEATO is as strong as ever.<br />
No region to-day contains greater dangers for world peace and<br />
security than Asia. South East Asia has been singled out by<br />
the Communists as a critical area of challenge. They believe<br />
that if their technique of so-called " Wars of National<br />
Liberation" can succeed in South Vietnam, it can be employed<br />
with similar success in many other countries.<br />
Why did the SEATO Treaty come into existence? It was<br />
designed to enable its member countries to combine together to<br />
counter the Communist threat in Asia. It was built on the<br />
reality that, left to themselves, the countries of the area would<br />
fall to Communist pressures. It recognises that these pressures<br />
can take many forms. They vary in intensity: they require a<br />
variety of responses.<br />
Thanks to SEATO, the Governments of member countries can expect<br />
assistance not only when declared conventional Military attack<br />
occurs across their frontiers, but they can also look for<br />
assistance when their authority and administration are under<br />
assault from those familiar Communist instruments subversion<br />
and Guerilla warfare. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Communist aggression in South East Asia follows what<br />
has become a clear pattern. It usually begins covertly.<br />
There is long underground preparation. This includes<br />
political indoctrination, the training of cadres and the<br />
build-up of secret sources of supply. The initial threats<br />
are indirect. They are concealed and they mature slowly.<br />
The response made by the SEATO Allies must, therefore,<br />
be carefully devised. There must be armed strength, of<br />
course, but we cannot win an enduring victory by military<br />
means alone. There is the battle to be won for the people's<br />
support, and to win this there must be political, social,<br />
administrative and economic measures acceptable to them.<br />
On my recent visit to South-East Asia, it was of<br />
special interest to me to discover how earnestly the positive<br />
constructive tasks directed to a better way of life in the<br />
community were being promoted. Whether in South Vietnam,<br />
Malaysia or Thailand, I found that the Government concerned<br />
had turned its attention to this need for a positive,<br />
constructive programme of civic action and rural development.<br />
It is to be found to a growing extent among the programmes<br />
of the miflitary forces. Our own Australian forces, wherever<br />
situated, gave a high priority to their activities in this<br />
field. No doubt we have a long way to go, but the processes<br />
are under way.<br />
A notable feature of SEATO is that each member<br />
country retains its freedom of action about how best it can<br />
make a contribution. This flexibility is important because<br />
the problems we face are neither simple nor clear-cut. </p>
<p>Successive Communist challenges in Asia<br />
have failed. They have been met by the military<br />
strength of the government under attack. It has been<br />
supported by the military forces, logistical backing<br />
and economic strength of its partners, and of other<br />
friendly forces also.<br />
The major challenge of Communism in Asia<br />
today is directed to South Vietnam. But it has met<br />
growing and determined strength of resistance.<br />
SEATO is not merely an instrument for military<br />
security. Its purposes include the advancement of<br />
all in the region it serves. It is well constituted<br />
to help by practical assistance and friendly guidance.<br />
SEATO has enabled us to exercise strength<br />
through combination. This has greatly helped the smaller<br />
powers to devote more of their resources to economic<br />
growth. Australia, in common with some other members<br />
of the Organisation, has major problems of development,<br />
as well as those of defence. Left to ourselves, we<br />
would be overburdened and crippled with security costs. The<br />
existence of SEATO and other security arrangements ensures<br />
that members most directly threatened, and who are the<br />
least able to afford large military establishments, will<br />
neither perish nor impoverish themselves.<br />
The wisdom, ability and experience assembled<br />
here should enable this conference to advance most usefully<br />
the purposes of the Organisation.<br />
The ultimate answer to Communism must be found in<br />
the minds of the people. They must feel convinced that<br />
life has meaning, promise and better standards for them.<br />
We who oppose Communism must be more than anti-Communist.<br />
/ 6. </p>
<p>We must demonstrate the false attractions of Communist<br />
ideology and expose its techniques of human manipulation.<br />
But we must stand together for the satisfaction of decent<br />
human aspirations and the precious enjoyment of individual<br />
liberty. Your SEATO labours of today will do much to shape<br />
the Asia of tomorrow. I wish you fruitful and successful<br />
meetings. I declare the conference open: </p>
