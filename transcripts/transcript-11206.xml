    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>7 October 1999</strong></p>
<p>E&amp;OEâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Mr Howard, how concerned were you when you heard what happened in East Timor with the Australian soldiers involved in a firefight?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well, I think itâs a reminder to all of us that this is a dangerous operation. I donât want to talk about the operational aspects of it. Theyâve been admirably handled by Major General Cosgrove. I expressed my immense relief that the wounds suffered by the Australian soldiers were not severe and that they will make a full recovery. I regret the loss of life on the militia side. A loss of life of anybody in this situation is regrettable and we hope that the militia will co-operate with the INTERFET forces who have a clear and unambiguous United Nationsâ mandate.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Does it raise the issue of hot pursuit again because of the fact that East Timor [inaudible]â¦?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Look, the matter, the operational aspects of the matter were fully covered by Major General Cosgrove and also the local spokesman for the Australian Defence Force. I am not going to get into commenting on the operational aspects of it. They are best dealt with by the military. They understand the circumstances of it.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>But has the reality of East Timor hit home for Australians now that two of our soldiers have been injured?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well, I think Australians always understood that this was a dangerous mission. Iâve never disguised that fact. I made it very clear from the very beginning. Iâm relieved, immensely relieved, that the wounds suffered on this occasion appear not to have been severe and that both of our blokes will make a full recovery. Now, thatâs good but it is dangerous and that has always been the case and we have to keep our fingers crossed and our thoughts constantly with them.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Mr Howard, did Senator Minchin get involved in a slanging match with Peter Costello [inaudible]â¦?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>I havenât read Senator Minchinâs speech.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>What did you make of the intervention of Sir Gerard, Sir Anthony and Sirâ¦</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well, as you know, Alison, I havenât made a habit up until now and Iâm not going to change this morning of giving a running commentary on other peopleâs contributions. At an appropriate time Iâll have something to say about this issue but this is not the appropriate time. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Are you going to read Senator Minchinâs speech [inaudible]â¦?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Iâm going to go and talk to the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea.</p>
