<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it is a fantastic moment in the life, not only of the National Portrait Gallery, but also in the cultural history of  Australia.  Itâs a magnificent painting, itâs a big acquisition thatâs a partnership between the Government and two wonderfully generous art benefactors and thatâs what the social coalition is all about, people working together in partnership to do good things for the cultural and other life of the country.  I think itâs a really terrific day and I think itâs going to be an acquisition that will draw like a magnet, hundreds of thousands of Australians to the Portrait Gallery.  It will certainly further boost the focus of Canberra and the place of the Gallery and the place of cultural life in our nation.</p>
