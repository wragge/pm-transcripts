    <content><![CDATA[<p>Key elements of the Rudd Government's $55 billion working families support package funded in this year's budget will take effect from tomorrow.</p>
<p>These practical measures will help take the pressure off the household budget by ensuring a typical young family with two kids will be $52 a week better off.</p>
<p>The major elements of the Government's working families support package that take effect from tomorrow include:</p>
<p>     * $46.7 billion worth of personal income tax cuts for working Australians;</p>
<p>     * $4.4 billion to fund a new Education Tax Refund, to help parents with the cost of educating their kids;</p>
<p>     * $1.6 billion to increase the Child Care Tax Rebate from 30 to 50 per cent and pay it quarterly;</p>
<p>     * $490.7 million to fund a Teen Dental Program that will allow eligible families to claim $150 per teenager per year for a dental check up.</p>
<p>These measures complement the Government's $5.1 billion investment to lift the Utilities Allowance to seniors and carers from $107 to $500 annually, and pay seniors and carers their lump sum bonuses in full.</p>
<p>Personal Income Tax Cuts</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow families will benefit from the introduction of $46.7 billion worth of personal income tax cuts.</p>
<p>These tax cuts will mean every Australian taxpayer will have a little more money in the pay packet every week to help meet rising costs of living.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's tax cuts will provide an additional $20.19 per week for a taxpayer with an income of $40,000 for an annual benefit of $1,050.</p>
<p>A taxpayer with an income of $80,000 will be $21.15 per week better off and will pay $1,100 less in tax over the year.</p>
<p>Mackay families with a typical taxpayer will be around $20 a week better off as a result of the income tax changes.</p>
<p>Education Tax Refund</p>
<p>The $4.4 billion Education Tax Refund will help the parents of 2.7 million primary and secondary students meet the rising cost of educating their kids.</p>
<p>Eligible families will receive a 50 per cent refund every year for key eligible education expenses up to:</p>
<p>     * $375 per primary school child, per year</p>
<p>     * $750 per secondary school child, per year</p>
<p>Eligible expenses for the Education Tax Refund include laptops, home computers and associated costs and trade tools for use at school and text books.</p>
<p>The families of more than 15,000 students in Mackay will be eligible to claim the refund, potentially providing a total benefit of up to $7.5 million per year.</p>
<p>The Child Care Tax Rebate</p>
<p>From 1 July the Child Care Tax Rebate will increase from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out of pocket child care costs up to $7,500 per child in approved care.</p>
<p>This $1.6 billion investment will benefit around 600,000 families nationally and more than 7,000 children in Mackay.</p>
<p>In addition, for the first time the Government will pay the Child Care Tax Rebate quarterly rather than annually.</p>
<p>Other Programs</p>
<p>From 1 July, the $490.7 million Teen Dental Program will provide a $150 voucher for an annual dental check up for more than one million teenagers nationally and more than 5,000 young people in the Mackay region.</p>
<p>Across Australia 3.3 million seniors, carers and disability pensioners are currently receiving the second quarterly instalment of increased Utilities Allowance, including 31,000 residents of Mackay.</p>
<p>In the last week seniors have been paid a $500 bonus and carers, bonuses of $600 and $1,000 depending on the payments they receive. Eligible seniors and carers will also benefit from an increase in the telephone allowance from $88 to $132 annually to help meet the cost of an internet connection.</p>
<p>An estimated 11,000 Mackay seniors and 500 carers are receiving bonuses.</p>
