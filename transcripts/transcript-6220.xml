IT IS WITH PARTICULAR PLEASURE THAT I ACCEPTED<br />
THE INVITATION TO LAUNCH THE " GREAT AUSTRALIAN ANNUAL<br />
Too RARELY WE GET OPPORTUNITIES TO REFLECT ON<br />
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LIVING IN AUSTRALIA AT THIS TIME IN<br />
. OUR HISTORY. EACH OF US WILL HAVE hIS OWN VIEW MOLDED<br />
BY THE PARTICULAR QUALITY OF HIS OR HER OWN EXPERIENCE.<br />
BUT WE ALL SHARE AN INTEREST INl ARE PART OF, AND HAVE<br />
CONTRIBUTED TO WHAT THIS BOOK TRIES TO CAPTURE NAMELY<br />
THE SPIRIT OF CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE WORD ' GREATIS QUITE APTLY APPLIED TO THE<br />
ANNUAls, IT IS STRIKING IN ITS PRESENTATION, IT MIRRORS<br />
FAITHFULLY THE RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE,<br />
IT ALSO CAPTURES THE EXHILARATION OF OUR SUCCESSES AND THE<br />
DEPTH OF OUR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO DISASTER. </p>
<p>THIS BOOK OFFERS FASCINATING COVERAGE OF THE RICH AND<br />
THE POW'ERFUL, SIDE BY SIDE WITH A COMPASSIONATE SURVEY<br />
OF THES UNDERPRIVILEGED AUSTRALIA'S LOSERS.<br />
THIS IS MORE THA . N A BOOK IT IS AN EXPERIENCE.<br />
THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN ANNUAL IS A [ RECORD OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
EXPERIENCE THE 1983 EXPERIENCE OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA<br />
AT THIS TIME IN OUR HISTORY,<br />
HERE WE DO NOT MERELY HAVE A CONVENTIONAL COFFEE-TABLE<br />
BOOK. NOR IS IT AN ASSEMBLY OF E\ VENTS THAT OCCURRED<br />
IN A CERTAIN YEAR. NOR IS IT AN ANTHOLOGY OF CONTEMPORARY<br />
WRITING ABOUT AUSTRALIA. A I MlS<br />
THE ANNUAL I BELIEVE SUCCESSFULLY -/ TO EXPLORE THE<br />
CONDITION OF THE NATION ANiD THE ATTITUDES OF ITS<br />
PEOPLE FROM THE SUBURBANITES OF HIBISCUS AVENUE IN<br />
KARINGAL, VICTORIA, TO THE BOUNDARY RIDERS WHO<br />
PATROL. THE DINGO FENCE.<br />
READING THROUGH THE ANNUAL I W1AS STRUCK BY THE CLARITY<br />
WITH WHICH IT REVEALS THE CONTINUING STATE OF TENSION<br />
WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN AUSTRALIANS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT. s / 3 </p>
<p>WHATEVER ELSE 1983 REVEALED ABOUT US AS WE PLAYED OUT OUR<br />
PERSONAL AND COLLECTIVE DRAMAS, IT CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATED<br />
THE FRAGILITY OF ANY ASPIRATIONS WE HAVE TO MASTER NATURE,<br />
1983 WAS A YEAR WHEN NATURE, IN FAIRLY BRUTAL TER~ MS,<br />
SHOWED US WHO IS BOSS.<br />
THE ANNUAL UNFORGETTABLY RECORDS THIS IN WORDS AND<br />
PICTURES. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS,<br />
THIS IS CERTAINLY TRUE OF THE PICTURES GATHERED HERE,<br />
YOU WILL ALSO FIND THAT IN THIS CASE EACH THOUSAND<br />
WORDS IS WORTH AND WORTHY OF EACH PICTURE:<br />
[ HE ANNUAL ACHIEVES A TRULY EXCITING UNITY BETWEEN THESE<br />
TWO DIVERSE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION WORDS AND PICTURES.<br />
THiE P ICTURES GRAB THE EYE, THE WORDS GRAB THE EMOTION AND<br />
TOGETHER THEY EXCITE BOTH MEMORY AND IMAGINATION.<br />
WITH THE RESULT THAT THE ANNUAL FUNCTIONS AS A SORT OF<br />
DYNAMIC MIRROR WHICH PROVIDES NOT JUST A REFLECTION BUT A<br />
VISION OF OURSELVES IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND. IN OUR HISTORY<br />
AT THIS TIME.<br />
IN A V'ERY REAL SENSE A CERTAIN UNITY IN DIVERSITY<br />
EMERGES FROM THIS ANNUAL. a 4 4 </p>
<p>IN THE SWEEP OF ITS PAGES WE CAN RE-EXPERIENCE THE DIVERSITY<br />
1OTFH IS GREAT LAND ITS CLIMATE, ITS SEASONS, ITS TOWNS<br />
AND CITIES, ITS BUSHLAND, DESERTS, PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS,<br />
ITS FAUNA AND FLORA, ITS RESURCES AND, ESPECIALLY, THE<br />
DIVERSITY OF OUR PEOPLE COLOUR, RACE, CREEDS, AND<br />
PURSUITS, IN CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF THIS AUSTRALIA OF UNIQUE<br />
CONTRASTS, THE ANNUAL ALSO MANAGES TO SUGGEST THE UNDERLYING<br />
SENSE OF UNITY WHICH EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITY.<br />
THIS UNITY WAS VIVIDLY REFLECTED IN THE SHARED EXCITEMENT<br />
WHICH SWEPT THROUGH THE WHOLE CONTINENT AS WE REJOICED<br />
WITH THE CREW OF AUSTRALIA II., THEIR VICTORY WAS A<br />
SUPERB EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE AUSTRALIA ARE CAPABLE OF,<br />
THE TECHNOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION OF OUR PRODUCT BACKED<br />
BY SKILFULL, DEDICATED AND UNTIRING EFFORT ELICITED<br />
NEW INTERNATIONAL RESPECT FOR AUSTRALIA S CAPABILITIES.<br />
BUT OUR UNDERLYING SENSE OF UNITY DOES NOT SURFACE ONLY<br />
FOR GREAT SPORTING EVENTS WHICH ARE PART OF OUR UNIQUELY<br />
AUSTRALIAN LIFE STYLE.<br />
THE TERRIBLE DIVERSITY OF DISASTER DROUGHT, FIRE AND FLOOD<br />
WHICH TOO FREQUENTLY FEATURES IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY ALSO<br />
BRINGS FORTH OUR BASIC AUSTRALIAN UNITY. THIS IS VIVIDLY<br />
BROUGHT HOME IN THE ANNUAL S RECORD OF THE DROUGHT THE<br />
GREAT DRY WHICH HAD HELD VAST STRETCHES OF EASTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
IN ITS TERRIBLE GRIP FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND THEN THE INFERNO<br />
OF ASH WEDNESDAY </p>
<p>THE NATION CAME TOGETHER YET AGAIN IN A SPIRIT OF<br />
COMPASSION AND MAGNANIMOUS SUPPORT, THE CONSISTENCY WITH<br />
WHICH AUSTRALIANS HAVE ALWAYS RALLIED IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
REINFORCES MY BASIC BELIEF IN THE HUMANITY AND ULTIMATE<br />
GENEROSITY OF OUR PEOPLE,<br />
MANY OF THE QUIRKS OF THE AUSTRALIAN CHARACTER ALSO<br />
-ARE REVEALED IN THESE PAGES.<br />
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF CALAMITY WE CAN AT TIMES DISCOVER<br />
IN OURSELVES A WRY SORT OF ' GALLLOWS HUMOUR' YOU ALL<br />
KNOW THE STORY ABOUT THE FARMER WHO AFTER MONTHS OF<br />
DROUGHT FAINTED FROM SHOCK WHEN A DROP OF RAIN<br />
FELL ON HIM HIS MATE HAD TO THROW THREE BUCKETS OF<br />
DUST IN HIS FACE TO REVIVE HIM,<br />
HUMOUR HAS, ITS UNIFYING EFFECT. SO TOO DOES OUR SPIRIT<br />
OF ADVENTURE, OUR WILLINGNESS TO ' HAVE A GO', OUR SENSE<br />
OF FAIR PLAY AND OUR OPTIMISM AND FAITH IN DETERMINING<br />
OUR FUTURE.<br />
THESE ARE WHAT THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN ANNUAL IS ABOUT.<br />
THESE ALSO HAPPEN TO BE WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT.<br />
ENCOURAGING THESE UNIFYING ASPECTS OF OUR DIVERSE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY BY FIRST FACING REALITY, THEN </p>
<p>-UTILISING CONSENSUS RATHER THAN CONFLICT<br />
-SEEKING CO-OPERATION RATHER THAN CONFRONTATION<br />
-AND HARNESS ING THE RICH RESOURCES OF OUR COUNTRY<br />
AND OUR CHARACTER<br />
UNDERPINS EVERY EFFORT OF THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
ALL THIS TO ACHIEVE A BETTER AUSTRALIA FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS NOT JUST FOR A PRIVILEGED FEW,<br />
C BUT I AM NOT LAUNCHING A CAMPAIGN; I AM LAUNCHING<br />
THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN ANNUAL SO LET ME NOW PAY<br />
TRIBUTE TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED THEIR<br />
TALENTS AND TIME TO ACHIEVING WHAT IS ONE OF THE<br />
LARGEST AND MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLISHING EVENTS IN THE<br />
LAST DECADE,<br />
THE EXCITING CONCEPT OF A ONCE-A-YEAR BOOK-TO BE KNOWN<br />
AS THE. GREAT AUSTRALIAN ANNUAL WAS THE IDEA OF BOTH<br />
KEVIN WELDON AND MAX SUICH.<br />
AsKEVIN HAS SINCE EXPL. AINED TO ME, HE WANTED TO PRODUCE<br />
AUSTRALIA'I S OWN ANNUAL; A BOOK AS LARGE IN SCOPE AND<br />
AS UNIQUE AS OUR GREAT COUNTRY; A BOOK WHICH WOULD<br />
HELP BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER.<br />
IN THIS GREAT TASK KEVIN AND MAXj WHO HAVE WORKED ON THIS<br />
FOR OVER TWO YEARS, WERE JOINED BY EDITORS-IN-CHIEF<br />
OF FIVE MAJOR DAILY NEWSPAPERS<br />
-THE SYDNEY MORNINRG HERALD<br />
-THE AGE 71@ </p>
<p>THE ADELAIDE ADVERTISER<br />
Tf: E WEST AUSTRALIAN<br />
THE COURIER MAIL<br />
THEIR INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION IS REFLECTED AT EVERY<br />
POINT IN THIS ENTERPRISE,<br />
AS WELL THE TALENTS AND ENTHUSIASM OF OV'ER 100 OF AUSTRALIA' S<br />
LEADING PHOTO JOURNALISTS AND FREELANCE PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE<br />
APPLIED TO PRODUCE THE STUNNING PICTORIAL ACCOUNT OF A YEAR<br />
IN THE LIFE OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
THERE ARE ALSO THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OVER 150 OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
LEADING WRITERS, TOGETHER WITH SKILLED DESIGNERS AND TYPESETTERS.<br />
IAM CERTAIN THAT, WHEN YOU EXAMINE THIS GREAT Aq;~ TRALIAN<br />
ANNUAL FOR YOURSELVESi YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT IT IS<br />
A MAGNIFICENT REALISATION OF THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT AND<br />
THAT IT HAS BEEN DONE FULL JUSTICE BY ALL THOSE WHO<br />
ASSISTED IN PRODUCING IT.<br />
IAM EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD AS<br />
EAGERLY AS I AM TO THE ANNUALS WHICH WILL FOLLOW,<br />
FINALLY, MAY I THANK KEVIN WELDON, MAX SUICH AND ALL WHO<br />
SHARED IN THIS INSPIRING ACHIEVEMENT AND RECOMMEND THEIR<br />
WORK TO ALL AUSTRALIANS. </p>
