PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT<br />
INTERVIEW WITH DAVID JENSEN AND BRUCE JONES 27<br />
Question: Prime Minister, southern African seem likely to dominate<br />
CHOGM. You're on record as saying you're advising caution<br />
against of Zimbabwe, and you have: been in contact with Mrs Thatcher<br />
and Joe Clark on this. What progress have you made, or what has<br />
been your response?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
T he discussions with the United Kingdom really began on this<br />
before the election when Lord Carrington was out here, and we had<br />
extensive discussions at that time. Since then, I believed I think<br />
thn7t a Conservative government would want to move cautiously, and<br />
not want to take any precipative action. They've stated as<br />
an objective the bringing of Zimbabwe back to legality but clearly,<br />
that needs to be done if it is at all possible, in a way that's<br />
peaceful and in a way that's accepted by all the parties concerned.<br />
The British government is therefore set in train a very extensive<br />
series of consultations with all parties in Africa. The frontline<br />
states are involved, the Patriotic Front have got an interest, and<br />
if people can be brought to a negotiated settlement, then that's<br />
obviously a great advance. The Foreign Minister has said that the<br />
eections in Zimbabwe is a significant step forward, but not one<br />
which of itself would justify recognition. He has talked of the<br />
prospect of the Muzorewa government itself initiativing discussions<br />
with the Patriotic Front in a way which might lead to the<br />
resolution of the issues. It's not possible to look at this<br />
particular issue in isolation. It is important to look at it<br />
in the context of what's happened in Africa against the wider<br />
context of the Co7monwealth nad indeed the western influence<br />
in the African continent. The wrong decisions could obvioulsy<br />
make it the most devisive issue in the Commonwealth.<br />
I happen to believe the Commonwealth is : an instrument of great<br />
value. I've been surprised, and very pleasantly surprised on<br />
earlier occasions at the very real sense of moderation and<br />
reason with which people put views which they plainly hold very<br />
strongly. It's. the kind of moderation and reasoned discussion<br />
a_-.." ngst a large number of heads of government, about 40, which<br />
, so Tten1 seems to be totally lacking in the United Nations<br />
With all the differences or most of the differences you find in<br />
t-e United Nations, you find in the Commonwealth. It's an<br />
-e en ,7-nch enables discussions to take place, progress to<br />
be. made. You know, it mightn't be stretching it too far to say<br />
that if it weren't for the Commonwealth agreement on the common<br />
fund reached at UNCTAD would not have been reached. It is certainly<br />
very useful in bringing people of differing views to a<br />
reconciliation of those views so there is a very real role<br />
and it would be important that nothing be done that would<br />
prejudice that in the future.<br />
And in addition to that you've got the question of western<br />
influence in Africa if wrong or ill-considered decisions<br />
were taken, it could well dissipate western influence, and leave / 2<br />
5 JUNE 1979 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
the way open for increased Russian influence, for increased<br />
activity by Cuban surrogates.<br />
Now, that's certainly not in our interests, that's not in the<br />
interests of the Commonwealth, and I'm very certain it's not<br />
soemthing the great majority of African states would want to<br />
see happen. Their objective is an independent Africa, clearly,<br />
free from domination, but at the same time, there are issues<br />
in Africa of enormous sensitivity and I think many Australians<br />
find it difficult to understand that sensitivity. You know,<br />
they say, " What's so special about Africa? What about human<br />
rights in Russia?". But there is one thing that puts Africa<br />
aisde: Problems in what was Rhodesia stem out of the policy<br />
of slavery and all the difficulties that flowed from that.<br />
It is only about 120 years since the United States fought one<br />
of the most horrible, devisive and destructive civil wars in<br />
the history of amn on that very issue. The policies I suppose<br />
theoretically within the living memory of the grandfathers of<br />
people presently alive in Africa.<br />
T have stated on many occasions that apartheid is a repulsive<br />
re-~ ime. it is not widely known and understood that Sir Robert<br />
Mienzies was the frist Australian prime minister to express that<br />
view with great vehemence, which he did. He condemned the policy<br />
rc-.. dly as one which would not, and could not, work. The idea<br />
tpeople are superior because of the colour of their skin,<br />
cr inferior because of the colour of their skin, must be one<br />
of the most repulsive policies known to man. Unless we can have<br />
some understanding of that, we'll never understand the African<br />
issues or the strength with which people hold their views, and<br />
if we don't understand that, we'll make wrong decisions and<br />
not be able to understand the motivation of people adequately,<br />
or properly.<br />
Question: You indicated that the Commonwealth could have more influence in<br />
Africa than the United Nations.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Weil, I think that in some areas, the Commonwealth can have more<br />
influence. The problems in Zimbabwe flow through from the unilateral<br />
declaration of independence against the United Kingdom, and the<br />
Ccr-= onwealth has a very real role. The meeting in Lusaka is bound<br />
to discuss at great lengths the problems of Zimbabwe and I would<br />
imagine the problems of southern Africa.<br />
Question: Has your government been in contact with the Patriotic Front<br />
Nkomo or Mugabwe?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Not in direct terms. An officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs<br />
and my own Department, Alan Griffiths, have had very extensive<br />
discussions with a wide number of people in Britain Alan Griffiths<br />
is not back yet but I'll be getting a wide report from him on a wide<br />
range of official and unofficial discussions which he has been<br />
involved in and as he is returning through the United States and<br />
Canada,/ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Canada, we'll have a fairly good conspectus of views and how<br />
these particular matters are moving.<br />
Question:<br />
What is the intiative that you appear to be trying, to play in<br />
A fri ca?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, I don't think we're really trying to play any. Our objective<br />
is obviously to make sure that the Commonwealth itself is not<br />
damaged as a result of issues that will be raised at Lusaka,<br />
and also of course to assist in getting to a situation in which<br />
there can be a reconciliation of different views, a consensus,<br />
and even agreeement. Now, the suggestion that the Zimbabwe issue<br />
has got to be resolved by fighting, I think is a very sad suggestion<br />
at it is also defeatist, because nobody will be winners in that.<br />
TIherzfore, while there are different parties whose views which<br />
at:-the moment are sharply opposed, the objective of our diplomacy,<br />
7T~ ' m quite certain is the objective of British diplomacy, ought<br />
to beto try to achieve some reconciliation. 1-ow that can be<br />
done, or achieved, is too early to tell.<br />
Question: Do you think that fighting is inevitable, if recognition of the<br />
Zimbabwe regime is inevitable?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I. think that if there were immediate recognition of the reg., ime in<br />
Zi-mbabwe that it would be very difficult for the Commonwealth<br />
and very, very, difficult for that particular regime. I believe<br />
there would be increasing Russian influence and Russian involvement,<br />
arming guerillas, use of Cuban troops and a destruction of<br />
British and United States influence in Africa. All of that would<br />
be very much against the interests of Africa itself certainly<br />
against Commonwealth interests.<br />
Question: Does President Carter share this view? Have you had any contact<br />
with him?<br />
PieMinister:<br />
Not directly. When Ambassador Young was here we had extensive<br />
discussions. After that, there were extensive discussions between<br />
T ' z and Care -: ng,-ton, and I th,-ink there is general consensus<br />
tiz hesematters do need to be approached with a very real<br />
cegeeof caution. An advance has been made but in our view<br />
not one that owuld merit recognition of the regime and it depends<br />
on what happens from here on as to whether that advance has<br />
consolidated and broadened in a way that can become acceptable to<br />
all parties. That's the objective we must work for. Hopefully<br />
out of the discussions that will be taking place with a wide<br />
number of people, the Secretary General of the Commonwealth is<br />
very much involved and many others. I had some discussions in<br />
Manila on this subject with one or two memebers of the Commonwealth.<br />
Hopefully out of all of that will emerge reasonable and rational / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
solutions. I'm not making any predictions about that because I<br />
think it is very difficult and I know views are held with<br />
great strecgh, and as I believe, with great sincerity. We<br />
need to understand that and we certainly must not underestimate<br />
the difficulties.<br />
Question: You are going to Nigeria before Lusaka. Will you be talking<br />
to Nigeria about the possibility of importing oil?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The details of the discussion and the matters which we will be<br />
looking at have not yet been raised but it is certainly a<br />
possiblity we will not be overlooking. I don't know to what<br />
e-x-tent their supplies are dedicated in other directions but<br />
we are obviously looking for diversification of our sources<br />
: f oil as well a trying to increase our own levels of exploration<br />
Ques tioni:<br />
id~ the sugg, 5estion on the oil from Nigeria, come from Nigeria<br />
or was it an.. A ustralian initative?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
In terms of the visit, that was a Nigerian initative flowing<br />
out of a meeting itA Jamaica, but there's no particular agenda<br />
for discussions at the moment. There'll probably be a wide<br />
range ef issues, obviously, that we'll be discussing at the<br />
Corpmonwealth Heads of Government Meeting north-south issues,<br />
some bilateral issues into which the purchase of oil would be one<br />
Question:<br />
You are aware that Vorster has resigned as President. Do you<br />
think this will have any effect on the whole southern African<br />
issue particulary Namibia?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I would have suspected that South Africa' s policies are fairly<br />
well set I mean, I don't really see those policies as being<br />
altered significantly by change of personalities at this point,<br />
policies that are really embraced by at least the ruling<br />
1, -erarchy.<br />
Question: '_ rime inseinflation. You stated at a press conference<br />
er two weeks ago that you couldn't see an improvement<br />
in the next 12 months, and that it would be around 10 or 1%<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Ididn't say that. I said that it would be a significant success<br />
if we could hold it at around current levels.<br />
Question: Yes, I think people took it at 10 or 11 because they were<br />
quoting it's at the moment. When can you see some </p>
<p>5<br />
improvement in that, or aren't you looking for an improvement<br />
in the next<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Obviously we'll look for an improvement and we'll be looking<br />
at the final budget result that bears down significantly on<br />
inflation. The next wage case is going to be significant, obviousl"<br />
The last wage in economic terms was, to put it as gently as I<br />
can, not a helpful one, and it's time there was greater<br />
assistance in the general economic recovery from the wages<br />
front. It is not possible to predict what is going to happen<br />
about beef prices, oil prices and OPEC countries, and these<br />
things of course have a significant effect on our economy.<br />
Wages are a domestic event. We had a number of particular<br />
cicrumstances through the course of the course of the last<br />
8 monthswhich ahve affected inflation, a number of them good for<br />
sections of the Australian community but bad for inflation.<br />
.7: e wheat crop which was double the year before was good for<br />
tne farmers but bad for inflation. Beef prices I've mentioned,<br />
o'l prices and wages higher mineral prices good for the<br />
industries concerned, good for the balance of payments<br />
' hich has strengthened markedly in recent months, but again,<br />
not so good for inflation. So we have to counteract all that<br />
w½ hich was one of the reasons for the mini budget and I<br />
think it will depend on how much these particular forces<br />
continue their thrust upwards, whether they peter out.<br />
The prospects of Australian inflation remaining below that<br />
of a number of our senior major trading partners is very<br />
real, because in North America and in many countries of<br />
Europe, inflation is 10% or higher. So long as we keep our<br />
inflation below North America, below Britain, below. France,<br />
below Italy, below a number of other countries, then our<br />
industries will be getting more competative and not less.<br />
In the past one of the great damgaes was done because our<br />
inflation was much worse than in many others so our industries<br />
lost markets here and overseas. We are certainly not<br />
complacent about it, but at the same time, we've got to<br />
fact the reality of the situation and obviously our principle<br />
objective will be to keep Australia's rate below that of other<br />
major trading countries.<br />
Question: To what extent does foreign investment play in inflation?<br />
Wel, if there's too much inflation, there will be much less<br />
S-investment. They'll just get disturbed and they will<br />
zo-idence. If we can keep inflation below that of<br />
countries such as the United States, I think then that will<br />
continue to attract a marked degree of foreign investment.<br />
Private capital inflow in recent weeks has run quite well<br />
and let me take the example of one industry aluminium.<br />
There is very nearly $ 2 000 million been firmly announced<br />
in that industry alone. That's an enormous industrial<br />
development, and it's one of the things that indicates if<br />
Australia plays her cards right, we will get a reasonable<br />
degree of economic activity. That's very largely because<br />
we've got significant mineral resour / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
we've got significant mineral resources and that does attract<br />
i nve s tmen t.<br />
Question: The oil company representatives on the radio this morning<br />
were suggesting that your moratorium., on the Great Barrier<br />
Reef would deter companies from cc:. ing into Australia.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think that's nonsense. There were companies there that<br />
had leases available and I don't know any country that would<br />
have wanted to get caught up in the environmental problems<br />
with drilling on the Reef, and I don't think they would have<br />
been the slightest bit interested. They wouldn't want to<br />
get caught in the row, and certainly none of countries<br />
with exploration areas were showing any keenness. There was no<br />
raessure from them to say," Let us go and drill". Anyway, there<br />
7-s been the moratorium up to now and oil search is gathering<br />
pace again as we'd want it to, as a result of other oilpricing<br />
policies to encourage exploration.<br />
Question:<br />
When did you plan to make the moratorium announcement. It<br />
seemed that the Opposition was making the most of the past<br />
few weeks, attacking Mr Newman<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
ft was a question of getting a submission forward from<br />
Mr Newman and Senator Webster on how to handle the royal<br />
commission findings.<br />
Question: You don't feel that Mr Newman or the government has been<br />
embarassed in any way<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We would have been better off without the debate, but I don't<br />
think there is any embarassment really on what occurred.<br />
The issues, are quite plain. I'm not surprised that the<br />
Opposition trying to make something of it but as I only heard<br />
z-yeserdhay, I think this government's record in environmental<br />
matters stands so high that it really wasn't carrying much<br />
weight; Qu-as tion:<br />
The Santos ruling in South Australia could that effect<br />
inve s tment?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It won't be helpful, but there are other things which are<br />
deterring investment in South Australia and the South<br />
Australian government is 7ell aware of that. They are going<br />
to have to set about developing policies which will attract / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
investment or else there is going to be a slow and gradual<br />
decline in South Australia, quite inevitably<br />
Question: Does that apply to other States also?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It applies to the policies in South Australia. It's the only<br />
State I know at the moment which has developed that sort of<br />
reputation. Question:<br />
Have you decided yet on a replacement for Sir Arthur Tange?<br />
Pr-. ime Minister:<br />
Qe s t ion:<br />
is it likely that he will be asked to stay on, or has he been.<br />
as'ked to stay on?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I'd want to speculate about what's going to happen, and no<br />
decision has been made..'<br />
Question: It has been suggested that' in the Pacific, Australia is not<br />
giving the type of aid which the South Pacific nations want,<br />
particualary the Solomon Islands. Their Foreign Minister was<br />
through here about 2 or 3 months ago.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, if that's so, I'd be surprised because the Foreign Minister<br />
has a very substantial aid programme in the South Pacific, and<br />
generall the projects are worked out in co-operation. with the<br />
countries concerned. We don't try to say to them, " Look, you've<br />
got to have tractors", if they want something else. They put<br />
in their requests, then there is some discussion about it,<br />
but in aid projects, it's certainly not a question of Australia<br />
telling people what's good for them. We are seeking to respond<br />
to their own iwshes and development plans.<br />
The suggestion that he was making -he was saying that they<br />
have been offered Russian aid and they might have to look<br />
more closely at it. He cited examples of South Pacific nations<br />
being given hospitals when they didn't want hospitals because<br />
they didn't have the staff or the equipment to run them<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If there were any particular suggestions made, I'd like to<br />
have them followed up, because it would seem to me to be quite / 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
against the general approach we've adopted in aid to try and<br />
deliver it in forms which are unacceptable to the people<br />
concerned. That's not what we're about.<br />
Question: You have been increasing aid to the South Pacific and<br />
playing a greater role. Will yourself be going to<br />
Honoriara. Prime Minister<br />
Present plans are, yes.<br />
Question Using the 707 for the first time?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I doubt it. We'll be going in the BAC I think.<br />
Question But it is possible with the airstrip, isn't long<br />
enough to take 707s.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think a BAC can get there quite happily.<br />
Question Why the reluctance to initiate it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
For short trips the BAC-111 is an adequate aircraft.<br />
Anyway, I doubt if a 707 can land at Honiara. It might<br />
be able to.<br />
Question Are you surprised at the continuing criticism of the<br />
Government purchase of these two jets coming from the<br />
Opposition which itself wanted to purchase these aircraft<br />
anyway. P-ime Minister<br />
I ai surprised at Mr. Hayden's suggestion that we. should<br />
charter a 747 from Qantas. I will get you to check the<br />
figures afterwards. I think a charter from the United<br />
Kindgom would be $ 360,000 with a $ 150,000 a week waiting time.<br />
Really, the idea of flying around in a 747 seems to me<br />
slightly ludicrous. But that was Mr. Hayden's suggestion<br />
in the Parliament the other day. That suggestion was also / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
misleading because if it was correct it means he has accepted<br />
the security argument which of course is what this is all about.<br />
Look, I'm not surprised at anything the opposition does. If they<br />
want to tag these aircraft as a personal possession of Malcolm<br />
Fraser, so they say there's no security argument and all the rest,<br />
and they also can't say there's no defence use, which is quite<br />
untrue, there'll be 40 flights a year to Butterworth alone. They're<br />
going to be used for refugees, for bringing refugees to this<br />
country and you'll notice it's much too late to apologise to the<br />
families of 300-400 people who might go down on the aircraft that<br />
could be sabotaged or hijacked because a head of Government's on it.<br />
Security assessment is that the risks Mal, are too great. He's not<br />
just talking about the risks for Fraser, I'm more concerned in<br />
that context but the risks for the other passengers who are on the<br />
aircraft, who booked, thinking they are booking on a normal commercial<br />
passenger flight but then you suddenly find that because a Head of<br />
Gover-nment is on board that they are involved in risks to they<br />
thamselves and I regard it as quite unacceptable and<br />
sor--of" thing the Labor Party would or ought to be very<br />
red-aced and there have been security concerns on a number of<br />
occa= sions which at the very least cause very great inconvenience<br />
to all the other passengers.<br />
Question When you say security concerns have they been on defence er<br />
Pri. me Minister<br />
O n Singapore, nc on Singapore on one occasion, a member of a<br />
Terrorist gang was found in the Airport and I was meant to be<br />
flying out. They said there was a technical problem and took me<br />
off and gave me dinner somewhere but everyone was unloaded from<br />
the aircraft, all the luggage was unloaded from the aircraft and<br />
everything was checked and put back. The delay was very considerable<br />
but that was the kind of precaution that people felt they had to<br />
take and you know it's not uncommon, the same sort of thing<br />
occurred in the United States on the way from Jamaica and you know<br />
in the United States they always blame it on loading delays but<br />
get very uneasy about the need for security and<br />
I find it increasingly hard to guarantee the sort of security<br />
th-at they think is necessary. Not just for the Head of Government<br />
butl-for the other passengers who are involved. I think it would<br />
be grossly wrong-to continue to put at risk an. international<br />
fllgnt and large numbers of private citizens.<br />
Question Pr. i Minister, could be just take an embargo case for<br />
Do you have the information on the<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. Question Mrs Thatcher will be visiting Australia immediately after the </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
Immediately after the Summit Conference.<br />
Question I'm sorry yes.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, she'll be coming here and the United Kingdom authorities<br />
raise the possibility with us a few days ago and obviously I<br />
responded to that very willingly. Mrs Thatcher when first<br />
British Prime Minister to be using, Sir Harold MacMillan after<br />
] 953. The British Prime Ministers haven't make a habit of<br />
ccmin-g to Australia and it's very pleasing so soon after<br />
assuming Office that Mrs Thatcher has thought it useful to come<br />
here for discussions on a wide range of issues in which both<br />
Bri-ain and Australia have a concern.<br />
Quest ion<br />
Those issues will include of course, the matters to be raised at<br />
CHC3RM. Prime Minister<br />
Obviously we will be talking about the forthcoming meeting at<br />
Lusaka. But there are many other issues I'll be looking forward<br />
to a report on the Tokyo Summit itself. We'll be discussing<br />
the conclusion of the general trade round, Australia's relationshir<br />
with the comnmunity and there are a large number of issues in<br />
which the opportunity for closer discussions with Mrs Thatcher<br />
will be vastly useful certainly to Australia and I<br />
think they must to Britain also or they wouldn't be<br />
making the effort to come here.<br />
Question Are aniy of the other leaders attending the Summit, expected to<br />
visit Australia also.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Ncr, at this stage, no. Secretary of State Vance will be here for<br />
the ANZUS talks and we'll be obviously having discussions with<br />
him on a wide range of issues I saw Prime Minister Ohiro<br />
before the Tokyo Summit.<br />
Question President Carter, being president twice, what's the likelihood<br />
of him<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think President Carter is obviously starting to get geered<br />
up for next year's Presidential Election. It's unlikely that<br />
he'll be doing much international visiting.<br />
] 0 </p>
<p>1]<br />
Question Talking about overseas visotors. You've had no more approaches<br />
indirectly or directly by the Shah to seek refuge out here.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I've only had one very, very indirect approach. He wasn't seeking<br />
refuge here. I think he might have been seeking to visit here<br />
for a short while, but I think it is unlikely that that will<br />
occur. Question<br />
He ; wo'. ld not have been welcome.<br />
Pr--' e minister<br />
I wouldn't want -to put it in those terms I think it is unlikely<br />
that he'll in fact be coming here. There would be great problems<br />
if it were to eventuate.<br />
Question There's just one, on the record. With spending cuts many people<br />
would say that education should be the last area that cuts should<br />
be made and I was wondering if you as a former Education Minister<br />
wer-e concerned about this rigour of spending<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, there are many other people who believe that there has been<br />
a great expenditure in education over the last 10 or so years and<br />
that some restraint in that expenditure is now required. Now if<br />
you're looking for building programmes and the general programmes<br />
and the way the cost of education has escalated, it's almost getting<br />
to a stage where more attention is being paid to the facilities<br />
than to the quality of education which depend on the teacher's<br />
relationships with the pupils. Facilities doesn't necessarily<br />
lead to good education, there's still some backlog to be overcome<br />
but enormous progress has been made.<br />
Quest io n<br />
Jusz one other thing. The decision with Gordon Barton and the DC 3' s<br />
still puzzle a lot of people. Gordon Barton said that he might<br />
approach you directly, Has he done so.<br />
Pr-izme Mrs<br />
No. it hasn't got o n to my desk. I thought he was doing fairly<br />
well. Question He has done fairly well out of the Government too as he has<br />
authority to take those aircraft across and I think its operation<br />
has expanded under the authority you've given him. I've got no<br />
doubt he'll always like more. </p>
<p>] 2-<br />
Question On the background, I suppose. Are you confident that the<br />
British will hold off on a decision on Zimbabwe until after<br />
Lusaka.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, on a background basis, totally.<br />
Question Totally. Thank you very much Prime Minister. </p>
