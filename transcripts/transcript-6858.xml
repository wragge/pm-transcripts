4WSYRALIA y<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 MARCH 1986<br />
At the invitation of the Premier, Zhao Ziyang, I shall make my<br />
second official visit to the People's Republic of China between<br />
18 and 25 May 1986.<br />
This visit will be a further step in consolidating the close and<br />
constructive relationship which has been developing between<br />
Australia and China. Under-the 7th Five Year Plan ( 1986-1990)<br />
China will step up the modernisation of its industries and<br />
economic structure. Australia is well equipped to provide<br />
quality raw materials and technology required to achieve the<br />
objectives of the plan. As well, the process of modernisation<br />
and structural change in Australia will, in time, offer expanding<br />
market opportunities in which China will be well placed to share.<br />
Already these complementaries between our two economies are<br />
bearing fruit, as trade between us continues to grow.<br />
I hope that my second visit to China, following the successful<br />
visits to Australia by Premier Zhao in 1983 and that last year by<br />
the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Hu Yaobang,<br />
will add impetus and scope to our bilateral dialogue and to the<br />
range of bilateral initiatives.<br />
The importance we attach to our relationship with China has been<br />
underscored in recent years by the increasing tempo of<br />
ministerial and other high-level visits. I expect that<br />
discussions on bilateral economic and trade matters will cover<br />
Australia-China cooperation across a wide range of areas,<br />
including those which have been the subject of earlier<br />
discussions with the Chinese leadership, particularly iron and<br />
steel, non-ferrous metals, wool and transport industries. The<br />
itinerary for the visit will include visits to sites in several<br />
provinces where economic cooperation between our two countries is<br />
proceeding. I expect also to continue discussions with the Chinese<br />
leadership on a range of important international regional issues<br />
of mutual concern. I welcome the opportunity I shall have to<br />
open the third China-Australia Senior Executive Forum in Beijing<br />
and to exchange views on the future of the economic relationship<br />
with senior Australian and Chinese business figures. </p>
