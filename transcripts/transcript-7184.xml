PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINuT DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
LAUNCH OF ENVIRONLENT BOOKLET<br />
DAINTREE 17 JUNE 1987<br />
Warwick Purser, regional director of the Far North<br />
Queensland Promotion Bureau,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
It gives eo immense pleasure to be speaking today in the<br />
Daintree Forest one of Australia's, and the world's,<br />
greatest natural assets.<br />
This rainforest is a dramatic illustration of the heavy<br />
responsibilities that are imposed on Governments, on<br />
industry, cn individuals on the whole community by the<br />
need to protect the environment.<br />
For Australians, that need is a particularly important one<br />
since we have the good fortune, and the privilege, of living<br />
in a continent of unsurpassed environmental magnificence.<br />
Indeed, the protection of our natural heritage is an<br />
integral pa: t of our obligation to our children and to<br />
future generations.<br />
Today, Daintree symbolises the stark differencen between<br />
those who seek to preserve and protect that heritage and<br />
those who seek to squander and destroy it.<br />
The environment can only be destroyed once. But when it is<br />
safeguarded, the benefits are permanent and will be<br />
appreciated by generations to come.<br />
However, protecting the environment also requires us to find<br />
a delicate balance with legitimate economic interests.<br />
I believe X can point with pride to the progress my<br />
Government has made in striking that balance and in securing<br />
our environmental heritage.<br />
Perhaps of greatest relevance to our presence in Daintree, I<br />
am proud to reaffirm today my Government's commitment to<br />
move towards nominating these wet tropics of north-east<br />
Queensland to the World Heritage List. </p>
<p>Negotiations between the Commonwealth and the Queensland<br />
Gover~ nment over the conservation of these forests have been<br />
going on for ten months now.<br />
The Queensland Government persisted in its demands that<br />
logging of the rainforests should continue.<br />
This was, and is, unacceptable to us.<br />
The process of nominating these forests to the World<br />
Heritage List will involve continued consultation with the<br />
Queen~ sland Government and other interest groups.<br />
This consultation process with Queensland will include<br />
furthier consideration of the initiatives already offered by<br />
the Commonwealth under the National Rainforest Conservation<br />
Prograir. These initiatives will be intended to promote<br />
alteznative industries such as tourism and plantations which<br />
can rnaaimisa new job opportunities and ensure that no<br />
partie3 or individuals are disadvantaged.<br />
But wie are determined that the outstanding values of this<br />
area be protected.<br />
And that determination is clearly shared by many parts of<br />
this community.<br />
I aza grateful to Warwick Purser for his warm words of<br />
welcc~ io and in particular for making the very important<br />
point that World Heritage listing will not just protect the<br />
environuLental values of the rainforest but will also protect<br />
and enhnnce its economic values.<br />
Despite some party political differences which may have<br />
separated us on other issues, we are all united in the<br />
knowledge that listing the Daintree will attract tourists<br />
from around Australia and from around the world.<br />
As proud as I am of our determination to protect the<br />
Daintree, it has to be seen in the framework of our record,<br />
established over more than four years, of environmental<br />
protection around Australia.<br />
We stcopped the Franklin Dam.<br />
We nominated stage two of the Kakadu National Park for the<br />
World Heritage List. We made mining the park illegal.<br />
we have made logging the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests in<br />
Tasmania unlawful pending an inquiry into viable<br />
alternatives. We have taken this matter to the High Court<br />
and Tasmania's legal representatives have agreed to a<br />
moratorium on forestry operations in these areas.<br />
We saved Shelburne Bay in North Queensland from mining.<br />
We have continued the National Tree Program and have<br />
established the National Rainforest Conservation Program. </p>
<p>We are cooperating with three State Governments to help stop<br />
the deterioration of the Murray-Darling Basin.<br />
Many of these achievements and the conservation strategy<br />
which lies behind them are summarised in the booklet I am<br />
launchinc today, prepared by my colleague the Minister for<br />
Arts, Heritage and Environment, Barry Cohen.<br />
The booklet is a quick reference guide to a government which<br />
has taken its responsibilities seriously to preserve the<br />
environncnt and which remains committed to those<br />
responsibilities.<br />
All this stands in the starkest possible contrast to the<br />
Opposition parties.<br />
Their prescription for the environment is, simply,<br />
horrifying. Mr Howard has signalled his intention to gut the Australian<br />
National Parks and Wildlife Service; remove the annual grant<br />
to the Australian Conservation Foundation; terminate all<br />
grants made under the National Estates Grants Program; and,<br />
unbelievably, abolish the Department of Arts, Heritage and<br />
Environrcnt. Words fail to describe the catastrophic social, economic and<br />
environnental consequences of such reckless decisions.<br />
Mr Howard describes these actions as cost savings, but they<br />
only thinly disguise a philosophy towards conservation that<br />
is aloen to a majority of Australians.<br />
Indeed, ' t is alien and repugnant to the traditions of his<br />
own party, which in the early 1970s, under McMahon, was able<br />
to clair the credit for establishing the Department of the<br />
Environment in the first place.<br />
Right through McMahon's government, through Whitlam's<br />
government, through Fraser's government, the Australian<br />
environment has been safeguarded by the existence of a<br />
Department of the Environment.<br />
Now John Howard proposes to abolish it in a frantic search<br />
for funds to pay for an irresponsible tax policy.<br />
We have called that tax policy shortsighted but to stand<br />
here in the Daintree rainforest and to realise it may be<br />
sacrificed to pay for that reckless policy truly defines the<br />
essence of shortsightedness.<br />
There must be many Liberal supporters who know that under<br />
their current leader, Australia would go backwards towards<br />
the environmental Dark Ages.<br />
Many Liberals must be appalled at the prospect of mining<br />
Kakadu, vandalising our forests, selling off the<br />
Barrier lIeef, and destroying the sand dunes of Shelburne Bay<br />
and Moreton Island and Fraser Island. </p>
<p>4<br />
Yet these nightmares could come to life under a conservative<br />
government. Those same Liberals must be asking themselves further: How<br />
could those acts of vandalism be prevented after a Howard<br />
government had abolished the Department of the Environment?<br />
To thosza Liberals and indeed to all Australians who have<br />
the interests of the environment at heart I can only say:<br />
look at our record, look at the Opposition's promises to let<br />
the vandals rip and help us to prevont the Liberals'<br />
environn. ental disaster from occurring.<br />
Here in the Daintree, it is my duty to reaffirm our<br />
determination to prevent that disaster and to continue<br />
protecting Australia's unique heritage for the genorations<br />
of Aust'alians to come. 1 </p>
