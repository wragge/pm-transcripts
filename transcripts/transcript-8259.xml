SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ELEVENTH ASIAN REGIONAL<br />
CONFERENCE OF INTERPOL<br />
CANBERRA 26 FEBRUARY 1991<br />
Commissioner Peter McAulay,<br />
Delegates to the Eleventh Asian Regional Conference of<br />
Interpol<br />
This is the first time that Australia has hosted a major<br />
Interpol conf* erence. So the welcome that we extend to you<br />
is a particularly warm one.<br />
We appreciate: your choice of Australia as the venue for this<br />
conference. It is an appropriate choice. Australia is<br />
playing an increasingly prominent role in the international<br />
effort to combat crime through, for example, our new role<br />
as the Interpol regional communication centre for the South<br />
Pacific.<br />
We meet at a time when the world community is facing an<br />
acute challenge. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last year<br />
threatened in a blatant and brutal way the principles of<br />
international security and stability on which we all depend.<br />
Australia has played a timely and commensurate role in<br />
supporting the allied effort, under the auspices of the<br />
United Nations, to seek Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.<br />
Regrettably that effort has recently had to be intensified<br />
with the commencement of a ground offensive to eject Iraq<br />
from Kuwait an offensive that only became necessary<br />
because Saddam Hussein has consistently and determinedly<br />
defied the world community by his refusal to withdraw<br />
without conditions.<br />
It will certainly be a difficult military task but it is one<br />
in which I am confident of ultimate success for the allied<br />
forces. </p>
<p>While our attention is focussed on the war in the Gulf<br />
which we hope! will be over soon this audience is involved<br />
with the war against crime which never stops.<br />
It is very retlevant to note that in both these struggles,<br />
the way forward lies essentially with the same means. A<br />
successful ou~ tcome will be achieved only through effective<br />
and deliberate international cooperation.<br />
Crime itself is no respecter of national boundaries.<br />
So crime prev, e ntion, too, must be an international effort.<br />
There are many signs that this kind of effective cooperation<br />
is in fact emerging. The continuing relevance of Interpol<br />
is one of them. The growing cooperation of national police<br />
forces throughout our region is another. The development of<br />
treaties of extradition and of mutual assistance is yet<br />
another. And this conference is one more sign a very<br />
welcome one, and one which I trust will be productive and<br />
instructive for you all.<br />
Delegates, In our dynamic Asia-Pacific region, our nations have learned<br />
well the lessons of our interdependence.<br />
As a region, we are all the beneficiaries of the massive<br />
expansion of trade within the region, the larger regional<br />
GNPs,' the stronger regional investment, the higher standards<br />
of living.<br />
In a region that was once regarded by much of the world as<br />
an area ravaged by international conflict and by widespread<br />
impoverishment, we are now showing the way forward towards<br />
prosperity and regional cooperation.<br />
All this lay behind my call in 1989 for the establishment of<br />
the new forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation APEC.<br />
I saw the need for a means by which the economies of the<br />
region could meet together to achieve closer regional<br />
economic cooperation.<br />
I have been enormously gratified at the steady progress APEC<br />
has made since it first met here in Canberra in November<br />
1989.<br />
The relevance to a police forum of these comments about<br />
economic cooperation should be clear.<br />
Because just as the recognition of regional and global<br />
interdependence has ramifications for economic policy<br />
makers, and for all those who contribute in one way or<br />
another to the creation of prosperity farmers,<br />
industrialists3, investors, tourists, exporters so<br />
interdependence has direct and vital implications for<br />
regional police work. </p>
<p>At one level, interdependence means that national<br />
boundaries, which once represented very significant barriers<br />
to the flow of goods and services and people, are becoming<br />
less impassible and more porous.<br />
To see the truth of that, one need only consider the<br />
dramatic developments planned for Europe in 1992, or the<br />
free trade bloc developed in North America or, closer to<br />
home, the Closer Economic Relations process involving<br />
Australia and New Zealand.<br />
Throughout the world, nations are gaining confidence in the<br />
fact that greater openness, and in particular the easier<br />
entry of foreign goods, ultimately helps boost living<br />
standards all round.<br />
Visas, once a hard-won symbol of a nation's right to deny<br />
entry to foreigners are becoming steadily easier to obtain<br />
and in many cases are being eliminated entirely in those<br />
countries that wish to encourage the influx of tourists and<br />
the consequent creation of jobs and capital inflows.<br />
Where artificial barriers persist as in the case of the<br />
trade barriers erected around the protected farms of Europe<br />
one sees a diminution of economic efficiency and, thus, of<br />
living standards.<br />
The recognition of interdependence is of course very<br />
welcome. But I accept that it poses headaches for police<br />
forces. It makes it easier for criminals and criminal organisations<br />
to flourish and to flout national laws. While it allows<br />
tourists and businessmen to come and go with greater<br />
freedom, drug runners and terrorists benefit as well.<br />
The solution for law enforcers is not of course to seek to<br />
turn back the clock to days of insularity and isolation but<br />
to step forward into a new era of international cooperation.<br />
So Interpol is an important and integral part of the<br />
strategies used by nations to pursue criminals within their<br />
national boundaries, and to detect and prevent the movement<br />
of criminals and their organisations between countries.<br />
In the same way, treaties of extradition and mutual<br />
assistance are adding new strength to the armoury of law<br />
enforcement agencies.<br />
Australia has now concluded such treaties and agreements<br />
with countries on all continents.<br />
The territorial concept underlying many countries' criminal<br />
law systems had the disadvantage in the past of limiting<br />
investigative assistance to that which could be obtained<br />
with the voluntary cooperation of witnesses. </p>
<p>But under the new agreements, for example, search warrants<br />
can be issued in Australia to locate evidence of a crime<br />
committed in another country. And recognising that a<br />
fundamental motivation for crime is profit, the new system<br />
of international cooperation makes it harder for criminals<br />
to profit from their crime by moving the proceeds offshore.<br />
Delegates, Through increased international cooperation, we can step up<br />
our efforts against those who threaten civilised standards<br />
of law and order, whether within or among the nations of the<br />
world. In particular no nation can afford to assume that it can, on<br />
its own resources, turn back the threat posed by those twin<br />
evils international terrorism and the drug trade.<br />
Drug trafficking and international terrorism are major law<br />
enforcement problems facing the international community.<br />
Drug traffickers and terrorists do not respect national<br />
boundaries. They prey on the weak, the young and the<br />
innocent of all nations. Our countries must strengthen<br />
their co-operative resolve if our communities are to be<br />
protected from these predators.<br />
Australia has largely avoided the impact of international<br />
terrorism. We are a peaceful and tolerant people, and we<br />
take pride in the fact that as a multicultural community we<br />
have no interest in seeing the divisions and conflicts of<br />
other countries given new life here.<br />
Yet when Australians see campaigns of terror waged in other<br />
countries against innocent people, they are justifiably<br />
outraged and concerned that our record of relative safety<br />
might be threatened.<br />
One of the most despicable elements of Saddam Hussein's<br />
career evident most notably since he invaded Kuwait last<br />
year has been his ruthless and, indeed, his barbaric<br />
willingness to make innocent civilians, including innocent<br />
Iraqi civilians, pay the price of his ambitions.<br />
During the Gulf conflict, I have been frequently asked what<br />
assurances can be given that Australians will not be added<br />
to the list of victims of Saddam's terror.<br />
Some would reply that no guarantee can be given, because<br />
terrorism is by nature a ruthless and unpredictable<br />
activity. But I give a different answer.<br />
Australia has good surveillance and counter-terrorist<br />
capabilities. They are strengthened by the kind of<br />
international cooperation represented by this conference. </p>
<p>Together, we must make it clear to those nations and<br />
organisations who sponsor terrorism that their strategy will<br />
not succeed. We will not succumb to their threats or accede<br />
to their demands, and our societies will prove resilient<br />
enough to withstand this challenge.<br />
Equally, we will not stand idly by if innocent citizens are<br />
killed or maimed. We will work to ensure that terrorists are<br />
brought to book and that they pay for their crimes.<br />
That is the only way to deal with terrorists.<br />
But to make that determination stick, we need the continued<br />
vigilance, the ceaseless diligence, the continuing<br />
international cooperation, the pooling of resources and<br />
intelligence, of our law enforcement agencies throughout the<br />
world. In developing our international response to organised crime,<br />
we need to be innovative and determined.<br />
For example, Australia has established a network of<br />
Australian Federal Police liaison officers in some<br />
countries around the world more than half of them based in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
This has materially assisted us to improve the amount and<br />
quality of information available on criminal activity.<br />
Recent successful large scale drug trafficking<br />
investigations were facilitated by liaison between the<br />
Australian Federal Police officers and their counterparts in<br />
the South East Asian region.<br />
Australia also provides financial assistance to allow<br />
countries in the Asia and Pacific region to develop<br />
particular projects and to train their personnel. One such<br />
project we have assisted is the Office of Narcotics Control<br />
Board computer facility in Thailand, which has realised<br />
enormous benefits to both our countries in tackling the drug<br />
trafficking problem.<br />
However, vigorous international co-operation has to be<br />
matched by equally vigorous action at home if we are<br />
successfully to oppose drug trafficking. There would be no<br />
drug trade if there were no producers or users.<br />
Some countries have a tradition, established over a long<br />
period of time, of growing crops which are used in the<br />
manufacture of illicit drugs. We must encourage and assist<br />
the farmers of these countries, who depend on such crops for<br />
their livelihood, to produce alternative crops. </p>
<p>During my visit to Thailand in 1989 I inspected a project<br />
doing just this the King's Royal Crop Substitution Project<br />
near Chiang Mai. This project helps provide the hilltribes<br />
people with a living through the production of cash crops<br />
rather than opium. Initiatives like this demonstrate that,<br />
with a positive will, solutions can be found to the supply<br />
problem. For our own part, Australia follows a policy of destruction<br />
or confiscation of illicit drug crops and the prosecution of<br />
convicted growers.<br />
There is also the need, of course, to reduce the demand for<br />
drugs. We have embarked on a major national educational<br />
effort to wa: cn people of the dangers of drugs. This message<br />
forms part of our National Campaign Against Drug Abuse which<br />
also provides for the treatment of drug users. The campaign<br />
is aimed at all members of Australian society, and is<br />
particularly directed towards the young.<br />
It will be through internal efforts such as this and a<br />
continued commitment to close international co-operation<br />
that we will see headway being made against the scourge of<br />
the drug trade.<br />
My friends,<br />
Not so very many years ago, the countries of our region<br />
would not perhaps have accorded a conference such as this<br />
very high billing.<br />
From Australia's point of view, a conference about law<br />
enforcement would not have been seen as dealing with a<br />
primary concern of our foreign policy.<br />
I am certain that our interrelationship as members of the<br />
region have become much more diverse and more mature since<br />
then. Today, cooperation among law enforcement agencies makes a<br />
useful and, indeed, a vital contribution to the protection<br />
and enhancement of our individual and our collective<br />
interests.<br />
The encouragement of such cooperation is a legitimate<br />
interest of Governments and is an important aim of foreign<br />
policy. In an interdependent world, citizens of one country are<br />
justifiably concerned about whether their livelihood will be<br />
threatened by the activities of criminals based in another<br />
country. They see the threat that organised crime, drug dealers and<br />
terrorists pose to their societies; they see the damage that<br />
such criminals are wreaking in parts of the world. </p>
<p>7.<br />
They demand that Governments do all they can to defeat those<br />
law breakers and to safeguard the lives and futures of the<br />
innocent. They are right to make those demands.<br />
In opening this conference, let me express the hope and<br />
the confidence that your work here and in the future will<br />
help Governments meet those demands. </p>
