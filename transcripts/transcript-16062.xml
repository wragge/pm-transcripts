    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today praised the work of leading Australian technology company Cochlear and a Korean surgeon in assisting the hearing impaired.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made the comments while visiting Asan Medical Centre in Seoul, a leading centre for conducting Cochlear implants.</p>
<p>At the centre, the Prime Minister presented a plaque from the Australian Embassy in the Republic of Korea to Professor Lee Kwang-sun, who has personally undertaken more than 400 Cochlear implant operations.</p>
<p>Almost 3000 people in Korea have received Cochlear implants, around 60 per cent of them children. Cochlear established a direct presence in Korea in April this year (2008). The implants are used by children and adults with a severe to profound hearing loss and who do not benefit from other hearing aids.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said Cochlear was an example of a leading Australian company successfully taking innovative technology to the world.</p>
<p>Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures and Australian investment are both growth areas in Australia's important trade relationship with Korea. In 2007, Australian merchandise exports to Koreas were worth $13.5 billion  -  the most significant of these resource and energy commodities, but increasingly also finished products.  </p>
