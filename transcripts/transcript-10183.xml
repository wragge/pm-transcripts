PRIME MINISTER<br />
2 December 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
. THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW ON AM PROGRAMME WITH FRAN KELLY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
KELLY. Prime Minister, News Limited Chief Executive, Ken Cowley, says the Government's<br />
got to stop using the Senate as a scapegoat and you've got to go faster with your<br />
reforms. Do you accept that criticism?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, that criticism's quite inaccurate. Mr Cowley and others must understand that in<br />
the Australian political system to get a law passed you've got to pass it through both<br />
Houses of Parliament. We were given a majority of 45 seats in the House of<br />
Representatives but we were not given the majority in the Senate. If we had been<br />
given the majority in the Senate the industrial relations law in its original form would<br />
have been passed months ago. One third of Teistra would have already been sold.<br />
The budget in its entirety would have now been passed. The migrant waiting period<br />
legislation in its entirety would have now been passed. Much in all as businessmen out<br />
there and I can understand their sense of frustration would will it otherwise, we<br />
have to operate within the constraints properly laid down in the Constitution of<br />
Australia. Running the Government is not quite like running a business. In business<br />
you can often order obstacles out of the way. In Government, particularly when you<br />
are dealing with the Senate you have to sit down and talk to them and try and persuade<br />
thein.<br />
Now actually we have done quite well, given the difficulties. We have passed in an<br />
amended but still very strong form, the industrial relations legislation. We have got the<br />
appropriation bills through. We have got many of the other supplementary budget bils<br />
through although there are one or two very important ones coming up this week. We<br />
have got our family tax initiative through. In the next couple of weeks there will be a<br />
crucial vote on the Teistra legislation. Now if we can get it through, and that is a big<br />
if, and I really don't know, I honestly don't know at this stage. The relevant Minister </p>
<p>Fax from~ : 21/ 6 115 g<br />
is still discussing the matter with the relevant Senators who hold the balance of power.<br />
We have to do that. They haven't signed off on it so to speak in entirety, so these are<br />
just the conditions under which you must operate a government in Australia in the<br />
1 990s because the way the Senate is now structured with an even number of Senators<br />
retiring every three years, and this is the key thing for people to understand, it is<br />
virtually impossible for either the Labor Party in Government or the Coalition in<br />
Government to get control of both Houses of Parliament at an election, no matter how<br />
strong the vote and the vote could hardly have been stronger in March.<br />
KELLY:<br />
Well as you say, the vote could hardly have been stronger in March, given the chorus<br />
of criticism and frustration there is now coning from business leaders arnd given that if<br />
that all builds in the community, how tempted are you to go back to the polls to try<br />
and get a stronger mandate in the Senate? I mean, is the climate approaching where<br />
that would be a temptation?<br />
PRIE MINISTER.<br />
Fran, I wouldn't accept that there is a chorus.<br />
KELLY: Well there has been criticism from the Business Council of Australia and others about a<br />
number of factors...<br />
PRIME MNIUSTER.<br />
Well hang on, just let me answer the question. Please, can we conduct the interview...<br />
you asked me a question. Can I please be allowed to answer it. I don't think there is a<br />
chorus. There are some people, and I am pointing out to those people now that they<br />
have to understand the way the system operates. They might look around certain State<br />
Governments and say, oh gee, they're going at a faster rate. They're going at a faster<br />
rate because they might control both Houses of Parliament. Now you have to live with<br />
the result that people give you. That is called democracy. Now obviously, there are<br />
devices available under the Constitution in the fullness of time for there to be a double<br />
dissolution if that's what the Government wanted. I have said repeatedly that I don't<br />
want to have a double dissolution. I would want the Parliament to run its full term.<br />
That doesn't mean to say that we won't, as Peter Costello and I both indicated last<br />
week, we won't be reluctant if the Senate rejects a piece of legislation to put it back<br />
again within the time periods that are laid down in the Constitution, but as I also<br />
indicated last week, we arc not spoiling for another election. We are not spoiling for a<br />
double dissolution but ultimately, we will do what is necessary to get our program<br />
through, but when you look at the main things that we were elected to do to reform<br />
MR to relieve some of the tax burden on small business, to get rid of the unfair<br />
dismissal law, to sell one third of Telstra, to bring in a strong but a fair budget and to<br />
bring in a family tax initiative. 02/ 12/ 96 11: 51 PS: 2 </p>
<p>Fax from 02/ 12/ 96 11: 51 Pg: 3<br />
Now the only two things that are swinging out of those five commitments in the<br />
election campaign are one third of Telstra and some of the related budget measures.<br />
The rest of it, despite the fact that we don't have the numbers in the Senate, despite<br />
that fact, the rest of those commitments in the election campaign have been achieved.<br />
Now.. KELLY: So given that then, would it be fair to say that we don't have an Oppositionist Senate,<br />
given that you've got that raft of things through? Is that fair to say?<br />
PRIME MJINISTER:-<br />
I think you have a Senate which is different on each measure. You certainly have an<br />
Oppositionist Senate from the Labor Party. The great distinguishing feature between<br />
the Labor Party and the Coalition is that when we were in Opposition, we made it<br />
possible for the Labor Party to bring about any of the economic reforms for which it<br />
was responsible. One of the great ironies of this debate about the privatisation of a<br />
third of Teistra is that it was the combined votes of the Australian Labor Party and the<br />
Coalition that facilitated the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. It was the combined<br />
votes of the Labor Party and Coalition that facilitated the sale of Qantas, the<br />
Democrats I have to say at least to their credit, if you can call it that, voted<br />
consistently against privatisation both under a Labor Government and now under a<br />
Coalition Government, the people who have really turned oppositionist in relation to<br />
things like privatisation, the Labor Party, I mean, how a party that told the public it<br />
would never sell the Commnonwealth Bank but did in frl, they'd never sell Qantas but<br />
did in fll, how they can lie straight in bed, opposing the sale of a measly one third of<br />
Teistra when they know themselves that if they'd have got back at the last election<br />
they'd have sold the lot, so they are oppositionist. I think the minor parties, look, the<br />
Democrats helped us on industrial relations. They negotiated with us and I thank them<br />
for it and I thank the Independent Senators in different ways for the way in which they<br />
have helped some of our bills through. Whether I have cause to thank them and some<br />
others at the end of the next two weeks, time alone will tell but I think people have got<br />
to understand that however much they might wish it away, a Senate controlled by<br />
others in the Government is a fact of life. I don't think the public wants to be racing<br />
off to an early new election but equally I don't think the public wants the program,<br />
important elements of the program of the Government delayed indefinitely.<br />
think it's just a question of taking things in a measured, sensible, orderly fashion and<br />
it's also a question I think of looking at what the Government has already achieved. I<br />
mean, I ha ve to go back to those five things that dominated the election campaign<br />
small business, family tax, unfair dismissal, industrial relations reform, sWe of one third<br />
of Telstra, fixing up the financial mess that we ultimately inherited. Now, with the<br />
exception of Telstra and elements of the budget package, we have done very well, we<br />
have done exceptionally well given the constraints under which we operate.<br />
KIELLY: Exactly, and given those things, these sections, Telstra and some of your budget bills... </p>
<p>Fax from 02/ 12/ 96 11: 51 Pg: 4<br />
. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They're very important.<br />
KELLY: Very important things....<br />
PRIM MNISTER:<br />
And a lot of money, I mean if they don't go through then there will have been a very<br />
heavy hit made by the Senate on the bottom line of the budget. I mean, nobody should<br />
be in any doubt about that.<br />
KELLY: And if they don't go through then would you go back to the.,..<br />
PRZIE MINSTER:<br />
Look Fran; I am not going to, you see, this is the difficulty if I may say so, of trying to<br />
communicate with the Australian people. I am trying to say to the Australian people<br />
very directly and very clearly, we want to serve our three years. We have no desire to<br />
be racing back to early elections and I don't think the public wants another election but<br />
we also, we want to get our program through and we are prepared to talk to the minor<br />
parties in the Senate and we are prepared to be reasonable but not surrender important<br />
principles. That's what we did with the JR bill. We made changes. It wasn't it) its<br />
original form but it is still essentially what we wanted. Now that was good. We were<br />
able to do the same thing with some of the other pieces of budget legislation. I am<br />
delighted we got the new schools policy change through last week. That is going to<br />
give new freedom of choice for low income parents to send their children to<br />
independent schools. It is not a measure that is going to help the elite GPS schools of<br />
Australia. It is a measure that is going to help low income people say in the western<br />
suburbs of Sydney, to exercise the option of sending their children to a low fee paying<br />
independent school, a measure incredibly enough that was opposed by the Australian<br />
Labor Party.<br />
KELLY: On another issue Prime Minister, do you agree with Senator Alston that fixed share<br />
limits, as in the current cross media ownership regime, are too inflexible and difficult to<br />
administer?<br />
PRIMIE NMSTER:<br />
I have been on the record for a long time as saying that I don't favour the cross media<br />
prohibitions because in the first place they were conceived in malice. They were<br />
conceived by the former Government in the 1980s to break up the then Fairfax media </p>
<p>Fax fraom 02/ 12/ 96 11: 51 Pg:<br />
empire which not only included newspapers but also you will recall the Seven<br />
television network and the Macquarie radio network, and also to dismember~ the<br />
Herald and Weekly Times group. They have in any event been overtaken by<br />
technology and that is the reason why in a world where you can beam something from<br />
one part of the world to the other and it will, they don't take too much notice of the<br />
geographical boundary between nations. We said before the election we would review<br />
those laws and that is under way at the present time and..<br />
KELLY: So do you favour using general competition laws with some special interest clause?<br />
PRIME MINITER:<br />
That is an option and all of those options are being examined. There is a share of voice<br />
option, there are a series of options and we are going to look, we've had a lot of<br />
submissions from different people and in the end you've got to achieve a sensible<br />
balance between local ownership and also diversity. There's no doubt that if you only<br />
worry about diversity, only, local ownership levels could well suffer. If you only worry<br />
about local ownership levels then diversity could suffer and it's a question of getting a<br />
right balance and I think I may have said it before, perhaps even on this program, that<br />
no matter what you do in media policy, somebody there will say that you are favouring<br />
one or other media proprietor. We are going to try very hard to make our reforms<br />
non-mogul specific.<br />
KELLY: So you would, in fact, then disagree with Ken Cowley from News Limited who said<br />
yesterday that he believes the Government has its ear closer to the Packer end of<br />
town? You reject that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Of course I do. I have very regular contact with Mr Cowley as he knows, and as Mr<br />
Lachlan Murdoch knows, and when the boss visits town he normally wants to see me.<br />
KELLY: So why did Ken Cowley make that...<br />
IPRIME NMSTER:<br />
Well look, I think in this, you know, they all sort of like to get a few runs on the board<br />
and to make it clear they're in there punching for their side of the argument. I<br />
understand that, just as on occasions past I can understand why Mr Packer and the<br />
spokesman for Mr Packer under the former government have said certain things.<br />
Look, we... </p>
<p>Fax from : 21/ 6 1: 1 P<br />
KELLY: You're not trying to rectify the balance here?<br />
PIM MINISTER;<br />
I'm just trying to be fair to Australia. And the good outcome for Australia is to have a<br />
balance between those two considerations. And you've got to recognise that in a<br />
nation of 18 million people then it's unrealistic to say you should have no foreign<br />
ownership at all. It is equally unrealistic to say that you can have unlimited diversity.<br />
It is a question of striking real balance and it's a question of taking care to ensure that<br />
you don't penalise the local home-grown media organisations, that's a very important<br />
consideration. KELLY: On another issue the Republic. It's reported that the Government's completely<br />
dispensed with its promise to have 50 per cent of the People's Convention delegates<br />
elected and you're working entirely on an appointed model, Is that true?<br />
PRIME NMSTER:<br />
Well, we're looking at a range of options. I want to say on that subject that we are<br />
going to, as we said during the election campaign, involve the Australian people in the<br />
process from the middle, the beginning and the end, I have not altered my<br />
commitment to ensure that the Australian people have a vote on this issue before the<br />
end of the century, nor have I altered my view that if the Australian nation is to<br />
become a Republic it should become a Republic in circumstances that unite rather than<br />
divide the Australian community. In my judgement, the worst possible outcome on<br />
this issue would be to have a referendum, say in the year 2000, which was defeated by<br />
51 per cent to 49, or for that matter, carried 5 1 per cent to 49. It's one of those things<br />
where if we are going to change, it's got to be something that the overwhelming bulk<br />
of the community are taken along with, feel part of, feel committed to, and even<br />
though in the case of some them they may not have wanted it, have thought:-well,<br />
we've had our say, the thing has been fully discussed, it hasn't been rammed down our<br />
throats and it hasn't been steamrollered.<br />
KELLY:<br />
But if people aren't elected to it, if it's all Government appointed to the Convention,<br />
doesn't that cast a pall oven..<br />
] PREME MINISTER:<br />
I suggest that you sort ofjust wait and see the outcome of a of that. There are a<br />
number of options that can produce an outcome where a lot of people participate in<br />
producing that outcome, But if we do have a convention process, I believe that that<br />
convention process and I think it's very likely that we will have it because we said we<br />
were going to have it that convention process will significantly aid public<br />
02/ 12/ 96 11: 51 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>Fax from 82/ 12/ 96 11: 51 Pg: 7<br />
understanding. But very importantly it will ensure that people feel involved and that is<br />
a very important element of this. Now, my own views personally are that I'm not a<br />
republican,. but I have always said that I'm going to facilitate debate, facilitate process,<br />
facilitate an expression of public opinion and proper ultimate decision making process<br />
if that is what the Australian people clearly want. But I feel I have a responsibility as<br />
Prime Minister to make certain that if this event is to occur it occurs at a time and in<br />
circumstances that draws the Australian people together and they feel part of a new<br />
phase in the life of our nation, they don't feel as though some of them that they've<br />
had something they don't want forced down their throats without proper discussion<br />
and with indecent regard to their sensitivity and their feelings.<br />
KELLY: Just finally and briefly Prime Minister, the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Shane<br />
Stone, has alerted you to the Larakia claim over large parts of undeveloped crown land<br />
in Darwin. He's described it as a greedy money grab and an issue of national<br />
importance that could be repeated across Australia, Are you concerned about it and<br />
are you thinking of intervening?<br />
PRIME NMITER:<br />
Well, I hav en't been briefed on the details of it although the Chief Minister did alert me<br />
to it on Friday. Am I concerned about it? I am concerned about the present Native<br />
Title Act. That's why we are trying to reform it. Those reforms are in the Parliament<br />
now-They will pass if the Senate lets them through. They won't pass if the Senate<br />
doesn't let them through.<br />
KELLY:<br />
But if a claim like the Larakia people's claim, the traditional owners claim, is fair and<br />
valid within the Hligh Court, is that fair enough then...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look Fran, I don't know whether it is or it isn't. We are waiting on the High<br />
Court... . we are waiting on the High Court to take a decision or bring down a decision<br />
on the Wik claim which will decide the status of a large number of unconditional<br />
pastoral leases in Queensland. Now, that's a very important decision...<br />
KELLY: Indeed, but it's not the issue here is that we want...<br />
PRIME NMITER:<br />
No, but it goes to the heart of the greatest concern that has been ex~ pressed to us<br />
around Australia about the present Native Title Act. Fran, we support Native Title,<br />
we support the High Court's decision in Mabo, we did not support the Native Title<br />
Act in its present form, we are trying to amend it. The amendments are fair, they will </p>
<p>Fax from' 82/ 12/ 96 11: 51 Pg: 8<br />
remove the legitimate grievances of pastoralists and industrialists without, without I<br />
repeat undermining the basic rights that were given to the Aboriginal people by the<br />
original High Court decision. Once again it is a question of us having proposed a<br />
reform, an intelligent reform and that reform not having been implemented yet because<br />
the Parliament hasn't passed it. Now...<br />
KELLY: Back to the. Senate.<br />
PRUEf MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's the system, I mean, it is and we have to work with that as best we can. And<br />
I understand that and I want the Australian community to understand it because it is<br />
the system we have to live by. And years ago it was possible. The Malcolm Fraser<br />
Government controlled both Houses of Parliament for five years. No government in<br />
this country has controlled both Houses of Parliament since the I st of July 1981 which<br />
is more than 15 years ago. Under the present voting system no government of this<br />
country will, in its own right in my prediction, control both Houses of Parliament in the<br />
foreseeable future no matter how strongly the vote that Party receives out of House of<br />
Representatives selection. Now, that puts on the Government, obligations; it has to<br />
work it has to pressure, it has to explain, it has to advocate, it has to demonstrate its<br />
will, it has to be reasonable, but it also has to be tough on occasions. It also, may I<br />
say, puts obligations on Oppositions. Most of the deregulatory reforms for which the<br />
Keating Government is, from time to time, praised, would never have been realities if 1,<br />
in particular, as Opposition Leader and economic spokesman for most of the time of<br />
the then Opposition, I had opposed those measures. I mean, privatisation of the<br />
Commonwealth Bank and Qantas would never have occurred if it hadn't been for the<br />
Liberal and National Parties. Yet now that the boot is on the other foot, despite their<br />
own hypocritical track record on privatisation in government, the Labor Party is<br />
turning the system on its head. Now that is the situation. We'll try and get around it<br />
and I think we have done exceptionally well in getting around it so far, but the next<br />
two weeks will be a very, very interesting test of not only our capacity but also the<br />
degree of reasonableness, particularly of the Labor Party but not only of the Labor<br />
Party in the Senate.<br />
ICELLY:<br />
Prime Minister, thank you very much,<br />
PRIME MNITER:<br />
Pleasure. </p>
