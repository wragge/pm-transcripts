AGENCY MEDIA RELEASE<br />
FOOD AID FOR B-. OT<br />
The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr ' Whitlam, announced today that the Australian Government<br />
is giving an additional $ 400,. 9000 of food aid to Ethiopia.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that this aid was being given<br />
because of the continuing need of the Ethiopian-authorities<br />
for international assistance in the procurement and<br />
p distribution of food to rural areas. Ethiopia is also<br />
developing food security buffer stocks in accordance with<br />
an FAO national food security plan prepared in November<br />
1974 at the request of the Government of Ethopia,<br />
The Australian Ambassador to Ethiopia,<br />
( Mr W. P. J. Handiner), resident in Nairobi, had recently<br />
visited that country and had reported on food requirements<br />
there. Details of the food aid to be financed by or<br />
supplied from Australia are being discussed with Ethiopian<br />
authorities. Mr Whitlam. recalled that Australia gave 4030 tonnes<br />
of wheat to Ethiopia in 1974, and had airfreighted 12 tonnes<br />
of protein-enriched milk biscuits previously, for a total<br />
cost of $ 830,000. Mr Wbitlai added that the Ambassador had also<br />
visited Somalia and consideration was being given to the<br />
provision of food aid to that country, which has similarly<br />
been seriously affected by drought.<br />
