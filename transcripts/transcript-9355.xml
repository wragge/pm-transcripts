TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP ON THE MARITIME DISPUTE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 12<br />
SEPTEMBER, 1994<br />
PM: Well, as you know, the Government has met tonight with the maritime<br />
unions and the ACTU, and as a result of the discussion and the negotiations<br />
the unions are going to recommend to their members tomorrow a return to<br />
work. This is on the basis of a set of agreements between the Government<br />
and the maritime unions about the future of ANL, which we think will improve<br />
the prospects of the Australian shipping industry, and ANL itself. This is a<br />
dispute well settled. We can't afford any prolongation of shipping disputes or<br />
stevedoring disputes in a country which relies upon its maritime trade. I'll be<br />
pleased to see the union membership accept the recommendation to return to<br />
work. J: What are the details of the deal?<br />
PM: Well you'll have to wait till tomorrow so that the unions will have an<br />
opportunity to present this to their members and explain to them what<br />
arrangements they've made with the Government, and that will be revealed<br />
tomorrow.<br />
J: Can you tell me how much money the Government is prepared to<br />
PM: No, it will all be revealed tomorrow, in that respect. They're entitled to go<br />
back to their members and say what they have negotiated with the<br />
Government without it being telegraphed on the media.<br />
J: How would you describe the talks?<br />
PM: Oh, it was a tough discussion, but an honest one.<br />
J: And how crucial was your role, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well, I think all Prime Ministers would say " entirely crucial". Let me say<br />
very crucial. </p>
<p>J: Was Mr Brereton rolled?<br />
PM: Mr Brereton played an absolutely tip-top role through this and stood his<br />
ground right the way through, and added confidently to the various proposals<br />
and fashioned and re-fashioned them as needs be.<br />
J: Some in the union movement are questioning his handling of his portfolio,<br />
and this dispute in particular...<br />
PM: Oh, well that will always happen in every dispute.<br />
J: But you're standing right behind him?<br />
PM: Exactly... well, not exactly ( standing) right behind him at the moment... of<br />
course I am, yes. It's not a matter of me standing behind him you shouldn't<br />
be putting the question in the first place, it has no basis to it. </p>
