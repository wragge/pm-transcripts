RETIREMENT OF TUNKU ABDUL RAHMAN<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, ste7s down from<br />
office tomorrow after thirteen years during which he has left an indelible im; rint on<br />
Malaysian history.<br />
The Tunku was the political architect first of Malayan Independence in 1957<br />
and subsequently of Malaysia in 1963. In the course of his period in office he has<br />
guided tl a national destiny with courage and remarkable skill.<br />
He has in his time seen communist revolutionary war, undeclared external<br />
aggression and internal divisions within Malaysia itself, each and all of them<br />
representing a deadly peril to the nation. The fact that Tunku Abdul Rahman is able<br />
to hand over to his successor a stable and prosperous country that is rapidly<br />
increasing its capability for self-defence, is at peace with its neighbours, and has<br />
a government that is deeply committed to the honourable solution of its communal<br />
problems, is a measure of the Tunku's achievement.<br />
Tunku Abdul Rahman's personal qualities are well known not only in his own<br />
country and to the Commonwealth, of which he has long been a deeply respected elder<br />
statesman, but to the world at large. These are notably, a profound tolerance and<br />
even-handedness, a concern for human values and a firm refusal to be diverted from<br />
his long-term objectives by alarms and pressures that he has judged to be tra-sient.<br />
The Tunku has always been a good friend to Australia, and his departure<br />
will be noted with regret both by my Government and by myself personally. Nevertheless<br />
this regret will be compounded withthe satisfaction we feel that his policies have<br />
been so well implanted. We know that the Tunku's successor Tun Abdul Razak is a<br />
statesman very much in the Tunku's mould and no less a good friend of this country.<br />
We wish him the best of good fortune as he prepares to accept the heavy burden of<br />
national responsibility. Finally let me formally offer to the Tunku the best wishes of the Australian<br />
Government and people, and the hope that his years of retirement will bring him<br />
peace and contentment in contemplation of a career of great political achievement.<br />

BACKGROUND: The Prime Minister has also sent the Tunku a personal message, expressing<br />
similar sentiments to this public tribute. T. EGGLETON<br />
