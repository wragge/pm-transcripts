The Prime Minister today paid tribute to war heroine Nancy Wake, who passed away in London yesterday aged 98.</p>
<p>New Zealand-born Ms Wake grew up in Sydney and after a brief stint as a nurse, worked as a journalist in Europe, where she married a French businessman in 1939.</p>
<p>Trapped in France when the Nazis invaded, Ms Wake worked with the Resistance as a courier and later as a devastatingly effective saboteur and spy.</p>
<p>She became the Gestapo's most wanted person, receiving the enduring nickname “The White Mouse”.</p>
<p>Nancy Wake was a woman of exceptional courage and resourcefulness whose daring exploits saved the lives of hundreds of Allied personnel and helped bring the Nazi occupation of France to an end.</p>
<p>Today our nation honours a truly remarkable individual whose selfless valour and tenacity will never be forgotten. Nancy Wake will remain an abiding inspiration to generations of Australians. </p>
