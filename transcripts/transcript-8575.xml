PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
AWGIE AWARDS PRESENTATION DINNER<br />
MELBOURNE, 10 JULY<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I am very grateful for the opportunity to address you<br />
tonight at Australia's most prestigious awards for<br />
_ playwrights and qcriptwrit-ers meaning the people who<br />
work at the creative edge of the arts and entertairnent<br />
inuty value-adders to the nation's life.<br />
I think you will understand me when I say that in view of<br />
the economic setbacks of the last couple of days and the<br />
human cost which those unemployment figures spell, this<br />
occasion might not seem on the face of it a place to<br />
address national issues.<br />
And I can tell you without reservation that for the next<br />
couple of months or for as long as it takes, every<br />
government effort has to be directed at turning the tide<br />
of unemployment.<br />
Fundamentally that means turning the economic tide and<br />
getting investment and growth back and with It, newlos<br />
It also means making new jobs and making the best<br />
possible provision for those without Jobs.<br />
This is not to say that the arts and entertainment<br />
industry does not have a role to play in creating jobs<br />
and generating wealth,.<br />
On the contrary, the arts and entertainment industry is<br />
one of the industries that Australia always has been good<br />
at and which has an excellent future.<br />
But your role is broader than simply generating income<br />
and employment. </p>
<p>TEL: 10. Jul. 92 18: 30 No. 009 P. 02/ 09<br />

You are engaged with the fundamentals of Australian life<br />
the way we see ourselves, the way we are seen, the<br />
things we value, the things hope for.<br />
Just as these things are at the centre of our lives, they<br />
will be at the centre of reoery because, as much as<br />
anything else, recovery depeias n our confidence, our<br />
faith In ourselves. It depends on our spirit.<br />
In no small measure the future of Australia is a cultural<br />
Issue.<br />
so I'm pleased to be here among those who work in one of<br />
Australia's great industries and one of the industries of<br />
the future.<br />
I like to believe, some occasional evidence to the<br />
contrary notwithstanding, that those who work in the<br />
realms of Australia's culture and identity continue to<br />
recognise that the Australian Labor Party is their<br />
political ally.<br />
My faith In this was reinforced by the letter which came<br />
from your President.<br />
In it he talked about the way in which the writers<br />
gathered here express in their work some of the qualities<br />
we badly need which any nation needs from time to time<br />
namely a heightened sense of identity and a revival of<br />
spirit. He also said that these writers had achieved significant<br />
levels of excellence, and that excellence was important<br />
to Australia.<br />
I have a feeling he thought that I would be moved by<br />
these sentiments and beguiled into coming and I suppose<br />
my presence here, after a flight from the Solomon<br />
Islands, is evidence that his instincts were right.<br />
Although I am always a little bit cautious about<br />
discussing such things.<br />
Over the years I have come to accept a bit of<br />
sensationalism and distortion.<br />
Although even I was surprised at the media's recent<br />
response to my remarks about Australia's image abroad and<br />
my supposed slight on Paul Hogan.<br />
All I wanted to say on that occasion was that we should<br />
be increasingly building our image overseas on the<br />
subtleties and diversity of Australia, on the wide band<br />
of our achievements as well as that easy-going, droll<br />
and likeable side of our character and lifestyle.<br />

My point, of course, was never the ludicrous one that the<br />
Paul Hogan campaign was somehow damaging: it was that we<br />
need to broaden the canvas which really means nothing<br />
more than doing justice to the reality.<br />
In truth, as Treasurer in the 1980s, there can be few<br />
people who know better than I the value of the Paul Hogan<br />
tourism campaign, anld I doubt if anyone is more<br />
appreciative of Paul Hogan's role in it.<br />
If Abraham Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address in 1992<br />
the chances are the journalists wouldn't report the<br />
speech but the so-called " doorstop" interview that<br />
followed it.<br />
And the first question they'd ask is, " how come you're<br />
talking about democracy and freedom when there's a war<br />
on? And there'd be learned articles at the weekend about<br />
whether it had been 8 lapse of political judgement for Mr<br />
Lincoln to deliver the Gettysburg address in Gettysburg<br />
instead of Philadelphia.<br />
It is not easy to assert principles or ideas in the<br />
Australian political culture.<br />
It's certainly very difficult to express more than one<br />
idea at a time.<br />
It is not easy for politicians to have views on history,<br />
even if it is their own history.<br />
One historian said recently politicians shouldn't<br />
meddle in history giving those of us in politics the<br />
impression was that he was content for us to make history<br />
but not to discuss it.<br />
That is why your President's letter of invitation was<br />
welcome. it is good to see that Australia's writers want an<br />
enlivened and enlarged public intellectual life.<br />
I hope so because those of us in politics who want to<br />
see Australia fulfill its very old hopes of being a great<br />
society and a great democracy, and who are determined to<br />
have a go, need the support of all good hearts and minds.<br />
And good hearts and minds I think will recognise that to<br />
solve our social and economic problems we'll need a<br />
renewed sense of national purpose and new levels of<br />
national cohesion.<br />
To go successfully into the Asia-Pacific and the rest of<br />
the world we'll need new levels of confidence and mature<br />
self-esteem. TEL: </p>

But despite the enticement in David's invitation, that is<br />
not what I want to talk about tonight. Not specifically.<br />
I want to talk about the arts or, perhaps more<br />
accurately, the arts and our-cultural development.<br />
I'm starting from the proposition that if we are to make<br />
those economic, political and social advances I have just<br />
spoken of, we have to make a parallel cultural advance.<br />
I think the time has come to recognise that however we<br />
define it narrowly or broadly our cultural<br />
development cannot be left to merely follow in the wake<br />
of the nation's economic progress.<br />
I think It might be the best way to develop a better<br />
understanding of ourselves and the rest of the world. It<br />
might help give us the direction we need.<br />
The truth is that ideally we should not need to have<br />
these debates about identity and nationhood.<br />
They are understandable historically, but they are<br />
regrettable. It's regrettable that we lack to some extent a knowledge<br />
of our history and our political and social system an<br />
unselfconscious cultural dimension.<br />
Those who still reach for their gun when they hear the<br />
word culture, might be more easily persuaded if they<br />
think of it as an extension of the argument for valueadded<br />
industries.<br />
Value adding to bauxite creates aluminium and adds dollar<br />
value to it. But the process also adds cultural value.<br />
You've made something something useful which adds<br />
more depth and a self-esteem.<br />
The economic imperative and the cultural one are not<br />
capable of separation they have the same conclusion.<br />
We need to make things. And we need to export them<br />
whether it's a ballet troupe, or an Olympic Team or a<br />
brand of tennis shoe.<br />
We need to send these things of excellence out into the<br />
world with our imprint on them.<br />
That's why in the 1990s I think we should be seeing our<br />
cultural development as an integral part of national<br />
development. Resourcefulness, prizes in achievement and identity woven<br />
into a strand of national endeavour.<br />
What I say tonight, however, remains a general view.<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL<br />
I'm in no position to say just now what specifically the<br />
government should do to best help the development of our<br />
culture. Nor is it up to me or the Government for that matter to<br />
prescribe how Australia should develop culturally.<br />
That is something that has to grow naturally from within<br />
our society.<br />
The role of the Government is to ensure that that process<br />
happens and is not left to wither in isolation.<br />
As you probably know, the Department has published a<br />
discussion paper on " The Role of the Commonwealth in<br />
Australia's Cultural Development".<br />
There are already in motion a number of review processes.<br />
Submissions have been received. Wide consultations are<br />
about to commence.<br />
I don't intend to pre-empt the expert opinions these<br />
discussions will produce.<br />
But we know that Somewhere between the receipt of this<br />
advice and the creation of policy a great deal of sifting<br />
and judging will have to be done.<br />
And the best way to do it is not, I believe, by the<br />
Government. Bureaucratic assistance will be essential, but to do the<br />
work of assessment, to gather the necessary additional<br />
information which will inevitably be required, to help<br />
the Minister shape and finally formulate policy, Wendy<br />
Fatin and I have decided to establish an Advisory Panel<br />
drawn from the arts and the wider cultural environmentincluding<br />
film, television and broadcasting.<br />
Wendy Fatin will be announcing the composition and terms<br />
of reference of this Advisory Panel shortly.<br />
We want to treat all these submissions in the context of<br />
a Commonwealth strategy.<br />
As far as simple principles are concerned all I want to<br />
establish tonight is that the Commonwealth government has<br />
a clear and very important responsibility to maintain and<br />
develop Australian culture.<br />
This means, among many other things, that on a national<br />
level, innovation and ideas are perpetually encouraged;<br />
that self-expression and creativity are encouraged; that<br />
our heritage is preserved as more develops, and, Just as<br />
importantly, that all Australians have a chance to<br />
participate and receive that we invigorate the national<br />
life and return its product to the people. EL: 10. Jul. 92 18: 30 No. 009 </p>
<p>TEL 6<br />
1 think these sorts of questions cabou1. d engage us now.<br />
I think good policy in this area needs to both set goals<br />
and re-assure us of our achievements.<br />
The last is as Important as the first in a prolonged<br />
period of radical change I think people need to be<br />
reminded of achievements as often as they are reminded of<br />
those things which have still to be achieved.<br />
That seems to me a function of culture it provides both<br />
the stimulation that comes from the new and the<br />
reassurance that comes from the familiar.<br />
Now, however we decide to go about doing it, what we need<br />
is a Commonwealth strategy for cultural development.<br />
Put one way that means establishing the best way for the<br />
Commonwealth to deliver funding and other forma of<br />
assistance to all those activities which presently come<br />
under the aegis of the Australia Council, and the film<br />
and television bodies, and all those which are placed<br />
under the heading of " Cultural Heritage" Including the<br />
National Library, the National Gallery and the National<br />
Museum. In that way we can throw in such cultural organisations<br />
as the ABC and its of fshootsf the orchestras; and the<br />
Australian War Memorial.<br />
We need to know what is the best way to fund these<br />
organisations, and what is the proper relationship<br />
between the Commonwealth, the States and Local<br />
Government. That will be the kernel of the task for the Review Team<br />
over the next year.<br />
Put another way, it is to find the best way to gather in<br />
our heritage and our ideas and deliver them to the people<br />
of Australia.<br />
Until now, of course, we have adopted a European model<br />
meaning our ideas about delivery have come from<br />
relatively geographically small and much more populous<br />
nations. if we are serious about a national cultural policy, we<br />
need an Australian model one which takes account of our<br />
geographic and demographic peculiarities.<br />
Obviously, establishing those relationships between the<br />
tiers of government io an essential component in this,<br />
but there are others as well. E: 1J0u. 1 .92 18: 30 No .009 067) i </p>
<p>TEL 7<br />
I mean it might lead us to place a very strong emphasis<br />
on touring. A principal component of a national cultural<br />
policy could be touring.<br />
We might decide that we have to be very good at taking<br />
excellence to the provinces delivering the nation's<br />
arts and heritage to people remote from the big cities.<br />
Visiting the nation's life upon them, if you like.<br />
It should be, after all, as much a right as a railway<br />
line or a road.<br />
There is nothing unnatural about drama or orchestras<br />
performing in Mount Isa, Broken Hill, Kalgoorlie or Alice<br />
Springs. On the contrary there should be more of it.<br />
The much mooted National Museum is also a case in point.<br />
I cannot conceive of a way to justify building another<br />
expensive mausoleum filled with inanimate things under<br />
glass. But a museum housed imaginatively if unpretentiously, a<br />
uniquely Australian museum, has a certain appeal.<br />
I mean uniquely Australian in that it would tell the<br />
Australian story by taking the ideas and heritage it<br />
houses out to the people.<br />
A strategy which obeys these imperatives geography and<br />
demography, access, education, stimulating public<br />
discussion, developing national networks, encouraging<br />
Ideas and intellectual life.<br />
This is something I would expect the Advisory Panel to<br />
address. Perhaps something like the American Endowment for the<br />
Humanities, or a second Australia Council for the<br />
Humanities, or as Donald Horne has suggested, a<br />
Foundation for Australian Cultural Development might also<br />
have its place.<br />
The name we call it by, like the eventual shape it might<br />
take, is not as important now as our thinking about a<br />
national cultural policy and what role such a body might<br />
play. It might, for instance, be the principle vehicle of<br />
Australian cultural diplomacy: for promoting Australian<br />
culture including Australian science and education<br />
overseas. T1E0L:. Jul. 92 18: 30 No. 009 P. 07/ 09 </p>
<p>TEL: 10. Jul. 92 18: 30 No. 009 7P. 0,69<br />
There is no doubt that we need to do this. How do we<br />
measure the Importance to this country of a Booker Award,<br />
or a tour of the Australian Ballet, except, perhaps, to<br />
say that it is immeasurable?<br />
We can say the same about film and television including<br />
those soaps which we now so successfully export or indeed<br />
the popular music industry of which we are the third<br />
largest producere.<br />
I'm not talking simply about image, but about income.<br />
I'm talking particularly about the services we can<br />
provide in Asia and the potential that exists for such<br />
industries as publishing, arts and entertainment.<br />
In all this we are talking about a role for the<br />
Commonwealth, and by implication for State and local<br />
governkments$ Yet I believe that one of the keys to our cultural<br />
development will be a new culture of non-government<br />
funding. I would expect that in the formulation of a new strategy<br />
we would want private individuals and companies to invest<br />
more In the creative life of the nation that generally<br />
has been no case to date.<br />
In summary, I think the overall object should be to<br />
create a role for the Commonwealth government which at<br />
once stimulates our national creativity and returns it to<br />
the people.<br />
I imagine a cultural policy which raises both the level<br />
of participation and the level of excellence.<br />
I see this policy as an integral part of building a<br />
better and more secure Australia.<br />
Indeed I believe the essence of our cultural policy<br />
should essentially be interwoven with the philosophy and<br />
spirit of the nation.<br />
This country is poised on the edge of extraordinary<br />
opportunity. We have unparalleled advantages.<br />
We must not let the recession cloud our awareness of<br />
that, or of the great strides we took in the eighties.<br />
There is no doubt that we can get back to economic growth<br />
and general prosperity that must be the overriding aim.<br />
But the prosperity will be more secure and the effort to<br />
secure it more worthwhile if we also realise our culture<br />
is tied in with it and becomes part of it. </p>
<p>TEL: 10. JuI. 92 18: 30 No. 009-P. 09, Qg<br />
9<br />
I mean that creating things, all manner of thingsincluding<br />
of course the things that people here createshould<br />
be the nation's commnon purpose.<br />
Creativity should be a word we value above all.<br />
It is because I know that you value it so highly that I<br />
ami grateful for the chance to speak tonight, and honoured<br />
to pay tribute to your work through the presentation of<br />
these awards.<br />
Thank you. </p>
