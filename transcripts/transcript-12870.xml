The Commonwealth Government will contribute $1 million to the 2002 Bushfire Appeal established by the New South Wales Government to assist those who have been affected by bushfires in that state.  This contribution will match that announced by the New South Wales Government today.<br />
All Australians will be concerned at the destruction of property and the damage caused by these bushfires.  My concern and sympathy and that of all Australians goes out to all those affected.<br />
The tireless efforts of the firefighters, police, emergency services and other personnel including the many volunteers, who have fought the fires and provided assistance to those affected has been outstanding.  I thank them for all they are doing to protect the communities concerned.<br />
As the fires continue to spread many communities are facing an extremely dangerous situation.  The Commonwealth Government stands ready to assist in whatever way we can the New South Wales authorities in their efforts to combat the fires.<br />
In addition to contributing to the appeal, for its part the Commonwealth will be providing short and long term relief under National Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA) established to deal with these types of disasters whenever they occur throughout Australia.  This includes contributions to the State to assist in meeting expenses incurred in emergency evacuations, provision of counselling services, food and clothing and other essentials.  Under the NDRA arrangements the Commonwealth Government meets 50%, and potentially 75%, of State costs incurred over certain limits in any one year for rebuilding infrastructure such as schools, roads and bridges affected by disasters.<br />
I encourage members of the public to contribute to the 2002 Bushfire Appeal.  Contributions to the fund will be tax deductible, and can be made at branches of the ANZ, Commonwealth, National Australia and Westpac banks, and at TAB outlets.<br />
Alternatively contributions can posted to the Community Disaster Fund, PO Box 2645, North Parramatta, NSW, 2151.</p>
