TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
I NOVEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I just want to make this point to you, that in a most revealing admission today Mr<br />
Reith has said that the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett, and his Govenment, have<br />
broken their election promise and have no mandate for the industrial relations<br />
_ policies they are now implementing. He said this, I quote him, he said when asked<br />
about whether the promise was given that no worker would be worse off by $ 1.00<br />
Mr Reith said: ' Well it may arguably be put that they have brought down a policy<br />
which was different to what they said before the election'. And when pressed he<br />
went on to say, on the Sunday Program this morning: ' I think it is a fair argument<br />
that they' Kennett and the Government ' made a promise bcfore the election and<br />
in some circumstances that promise will not bc met'.<br />
In other words, they followed a policy which deceives the Victorian electorate into<br />
believing that the industrial rclations policy of the Kennett Government would be<br />
far more sympathetic then it is, and therefore in the full context of Mr Reith's<br />
remarks he has made it clear that there is no mandate for Mr Kennett and his<br />
Government for the industrial relations policies he is now following.<br />
Now, Victoria is the Liberal Party's social laboratory. Victoria is the place where<br />
they are trying out their industrial relations tricks, where they are giving vent to all<br />
their ideological obsessions and they are now slipping and sliding and backing<br />
away from the kind of policies which we would see under John tlewson, John<br />
Howard and Peter Rcith. </p>
<p>TE L: 1. Nov. 92 15: 15 NO. 003 P. 02/ 04<br />

1: Mr Keating does this justify, therefore, the Federal Government legislating to<br />
allow Victorians to leave the Victorian Jurisdiction and move into Federal<br />
jurisdiction under Federal awards?<br />
PM: Well that could be a matter any Government could do in the normal course of<br />
events.<br />
J. How?<br />
PM: There is no problem, there is no reason in policy why if a union wants to be<br />
Federally registered that it shouldn't be able to be. But in the event that people are<br />
going to wear penalties that they didn't bol ieve they were going to wear when this<br />
election was taken in Victoria, having that opportunity, at least gives the Victorian<br />
workforce some option to escape these policies.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well that is a matter that is yet to be discussed.<br />
J: Are you confident that you have adequate constitutional power to do that?<br />
PM: Well again, that is a matter that has got to be propcrly heard by Cabinet.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM. Again, these arc mattcrs that Senator Cook would need to bring before the Cabinet.<br />
But the primary matter here is, the Liberal party have gone along as thoughi they<br />
have just finished their port and cigars, their cognac and cigars down at the<br />
Melbourne Club, and decided that the workers are really all the problem, and they<br />
dashed out and hopped into them. In fact we have had a breakout of industrial<br />
peace in this country now for nearly a decade. We are now collecting data, we<br />
think probably our industrial scene has never been as peaceful from the time the'-<br />
statistics have been taken. We have got an inflation rate last wcek which puts us at<br />
the world's best, and on what basis do the laboratory workers of thc Liberal party<br />
believe thcy can then run out into an clectorate and engage in these sort of<br />
disruptive policies?<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well I will see what Mr Kennett has to say when he comes.<br />
J: Mr Keatinig..<br />
PM. There are a couple of things in the conduct of public affairs that should be above<br />
the silliness of politics and the management of financial affairs between the<br />
Commonwealth of States and the management of financial assets ought to be one </p>
<p>TEL: 1. Nov. 92 15: 15 No. 003 P. 03/ 04<br />
3<br />
of them. It ought to be one place where even Mr Reith knows that his silliness<br />
causes damage. Now the Commonwealth has acted here with total propriety and<br />
free of political favour. All that has happened here is that a matter akin to matters<br />
which I as Treasurer dealt with over the years, and other Treasurers have dealt with<br />
between States, and with the Commonwealth and States, has perhaps for the first<br />
time in a long time becomne a public matter, and there is a lot of interest in it. But<br />
States have been accommodated on all sorts of problems, or we have worked<br />
through all sorts of financial problems, not taking this sort of wrecking approach of<br />
throwing things into the public domain, which has just seen all the bond reels rise<br />
for the Commonwealth and the States making the whole carriage of public in<br />
this country much mnore expensive.<br />
1: So you blame thc Keninett Government?<br />
PM: Let me just give you this example. How would it havc been if I had said at the<br />
time when I knew the State Bank of Victoria was insolvent, for me to have said,<br />
' well I must blurt this out, the public must know; despite the financial problems,<br />
which my making it public will reveal, I shall make it all a public matter'. Of<br />
course I didn't, I got it solved with Premier Kirner and the result was that the<br />
Victorian public wcrc spared the greatest anguish that could have ever been visited<br />
upon thcm in a State which held a quarter of all savings banks deposits. Now<br />
that's what conscientious Ministers do, and I think the Victorian Government now<br />
realise that they have made a mistake in seeking to make any capital out of this,<br />
and that's probably why Mr Stockdale has now taken a back seat on the issue and<br />
wants to discuss it sensibly, I might say, reasonably.<br />
PM; The Treasurer is doing a press conference right this minute on all those matters and<br />
you are wclcome anyone to look at his transcripts and he will take all the questions<br />
that matter.<br />
J: Mr Keating how concerned are you that industrial disruption in Victoria might<br />
jeopardisc national economic rccovery?<br />
PM: Very concerned. Who is going to invest in Victoria in this climate? And what is<br />
the point of it? in a place which was virtually brimming over with industrial<br />
cooperation, where we arc seeing all sorts of enterprise agreements being written<br />
for all the flexibility in the world, to be talking about police, police on picket lines,<br />
about a non-negotiated legislating away of important components of wages and<br />
salaries and bencfits: there is just no point to this. What I suggest to Mr Kennett is,<br />
that he sit down in a cooperative modc, as all of us in Australia have been obliged<br />
to do for a decade, and make Victoria work better.<br />
J: What is your advice to workers about the proposed strie? </p>
<p>TEL: I. Nov. 92 15: 15 No. 003 P. 04/ 04<br />
PM: That is up to Mr Kennett, any confrontation here is being generated by him, I can<br />
only advise him this, that he should sit down with representatives of the workforce<br />
and try and get his State back onto the road to recovery. Thank you.<br />
