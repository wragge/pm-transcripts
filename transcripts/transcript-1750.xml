ASSISTANCE FOR QUINTUPLETS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon John McEwen<br />
The Federal Government had decided to offer to assist<br />
the Braham family following the birth of their quins, the Prime Minister<br />
( Mr McEwen) said today.<br />
However, the Government would not decide on details<br />
of the assistance until it had conferred with the family to ascertain their<br />
needs. The Government would also confer with the New South<br />
Wales Government in the light of any arrangements the State might be<br />
making. Mr McEwen said was delighted to hear news of the<br />
successful birth of the children. I and my colleagues sincerely hope<br />
that Mrs Braham and the children remain in good health."<br />
