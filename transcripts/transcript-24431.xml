    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate David Cameron and the British Government on its re-election. </p>
<p>Britain is the home of modern democracy. </p>
<p>Our close cultural and other ties, mean that many Australians have followed this campaign with a close interest.</p>
<p>Our ties are deeper than party: Australia and the United Kingdom always work for a better and safer world, no matter who holds government.</p>
<p>David Cameron is a good friend of Australia, and I was honoured to welcome him to Australia last November.</p>
<p>David Cameron has demonstrated resolve, perseverance and vision during his first term.</p>
<p>He shares the belief that countries are not made great through the action of government alone, but through the flair, ingenuity and hard work of their people.</p>
<p>His government has over the past five years turned around Britain’s economy – halving the national deficit and getting more people into work than ever before. </p>
<p>Britain is now one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.</p>
<p>It is a unique privilege to serve one’s country and I wish Prime Minister Cameron well for his second term.</p>
