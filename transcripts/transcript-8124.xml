1. i CHECK AGAINST DELI-VERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF " BUILDING REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS<br />
AN INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE"<br />
CANBERRA 12 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
In March last year, an unusual event in Australian politics<br />
took place.<br />
A Special Premiers Conference was convened at my request, at<br />
which the Commonwealth and States agreed to cooperate in a<br />
task of critical importance for Australians. We had come<br />
together in response to community concerns about the<br />
shortage of housing; and our decision was to do what we<br />
could to address the supply side of this problem.<br />
In part, our concern was based on the plethora of<br />
regulations and requirements surrounding the building<br />
industry; we recognised the need to rationalise that<br />
regulatory framework.<br />
Regulation in principle is meant to serve an important and<br />
legitimate purpose in protecting community interests.<br />
But uncoordinated regulation has a habit of growing like<br />
topsy, and can ultimately serve precisely the opposite<br />
purpose. In Australia at present much of our regulation is too<br />
complex, serves a narrow range of interests, stifles<br />
initiative and innovation, delivers only a limited range of<br />
benefits and creates unnecessary costs.<br />
In short, we have too much red tape.<br />
And in the building industry, you experience some of the<br />
more frustrating and costly implications of that.<br />
A standard development design could be submitted to each of<br />
the 880 odd local councils in Australia and receive a<br />
differing set of requirements from each council. </p>
<p>A proposal to develop a single parcel of land can routinely<br />
require a dozen applications to different authorities each<br />
of which can produce different, sometimes conflicting,<br />
requirements.<br />
Different interpretations of regulations can come from<br />
different authorities but worse, they can come from within<br />
a single authority.<br />
So the problem that the Premiers Conference addressed is a<br />
very real one.<br />
As I observe in my introduction to this report, a simple set<br />
of well thought out, complementary, clearly presented and<br />
cost-effective national building regulations and standards<br />
would assist all parts of the industry and bring significant<br />
cost savings to the community generally.<br />
This report is a major contribution to our understanding of<br />
the problem, and the Master Builders' Construction and<br />
Housing Association of Australia is to be congratulated on<br />
its initiative in preparing it.<br />
This report represents not only an important step forward in<br />
presenting the industry's views on these matters, but serves<br />
as a vehicle for focussing the industry's attention on the<br />
part it can play in the process of regulatory reform.<br />
Central to the report is the objective of reducing the costs<br />
of non-productive processes in building and construction, by<br />
the development of a streamlined and more efficient<br />
regulatory system.<br />
The Association represents some seventeen thousand firms<br />
working across Australia in all sectors of the building<br />
industry. So you are well placed to canvass, as you have<br />
done, a wide spectrum of industry views on reform of<br />
building regulations and standards.<br />
It is essential for Australia's long-term growth and<br />
prosperity for us to work continually to improve the<br />
efficiency of all sectors of the Australian economy.<br />
But micro-economic reform can only be achieved through<br />
cooperation from all sections of the community, both private<br />
and public. So contributions such as this, from an industry<br />
such as the construction and housing industry which is so<br />
critically involved in the infrastructure of our national<br />
economy are not only welcome, but necessary.<br />
As the " user" of the regulatory system, industry should<br />
provide strong inputs into the reform process.<br />
My Government was pleased to be able, through our Australian<br />
Building Research Grants Scheme, to help the Association<br />
undertake the survey on which this report is based. </p>
<p>This report is but one spin-off of the Special Premiers'<br />
Conference on Housing. There has been a real boost in the<br />
effort to achieve micro-economic reform in the building and<br />
construction industry.<br />
Programs are now in place, and agreements are being<br />
translated into action, at the national, state and local<br />
levels. Following the Conference, my Government announced the<br />
establishment of the Housing Development Program.<br />
Under this program, $ 2 million a year has been made<br />
available for further cooperative State and Commonwealth<br />
projects aimed at overcoming housing supply constraints,<br />
including planning and regulatory processes.<br />
We recognise, however, that regulatory reform is not a oneof<br />
f exercise. To this end we established a Building<br />
Regulation Review Task Force to undertake a fundamental<br />
examination of the whole system of building regulation.<br />
Having opened by mentioning one Special Premiers Conference<br />
let me close with another.<br />
In Brisbane next month, the Premiers and I will meet once<br />
more in a Special Conference to take forward the work of<br />
building a new cooperative partnership in our Federal<br />
system. The problems that you experience within your industry are<br />
felt more widely throughout the community; the frustrations<br />
and inefficiencies of conflicting, unnecessary or outdated<br />
Government regulations threaten to retard the progress of<br />
the nation as a whole.<br />
As you will all be aware, the members of the European<br />
Community are moving towards the creation by 1992 of a<br />
single market. Within that market there will be fewer<br />
obstacles and impediments to the free movement of goods and<br />
services between the nations of the European Community than<br />
there is between the States of Australia.<br />
Streamlining regulations, unscrambling unnecessary<br />
requirements, lightening administrative burdens, loosening<br />
our red tape are necessary reforms not just because of the<br />
resulting convenience to individuals and organisations<br />
within Australia, and not just because of the resulting<br />
cheaper housing and more efficient allocation of the housing<br />
dollar within Australia.<br />
They are necessary as integral parts of our fundamentally<br />
important task of increasing Australia's international<br />
competitiveness. Within that broad perspective, it is a pleasure to launch<br />
this report and to congratulate those responsible for it. </p>
<p>4.<br />
You can be assured it will be very carefully studied by the<br />
Federal Government and relied upon in our continuing program<br />
of national economic reform. </p>
