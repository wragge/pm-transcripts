PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
The Sydney Morning Herald will tomorrow publish a story which is a complete<br />
fabrication around a matter which arose nearly ten years ago.<br />
Herald staff have leaked details of the story to financial markets, obviously<br />
providing a picture which is damaging to me, through allegations which I can<br />
assert have no basis whatsoever in fact.<br />
That The Sydney Morning Herald should behave in this way is outrageous.<br />
I am reliably informed that the journalists concerned were fed this fallacious<br />
material by the Liberal Party.<br />
The attached correspondence this week between my office and The SMH<br />
makes it clear that any suggestion of improper dealing is utterly without<br />
foundation. CANBERRA 27 October 1995 I~ </p>
<p>OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CANBERRA<br />
October, 1995<br />
Ms Colleen Ryan and Mr David Humphries<br />
The Sydney Morning Herald<br />
By fax: 02 282 3005<br />
Dear Ms Ryan and Mr Humphries<br />
You have written to the Prime Minister about the global borrowing limits of the<br />
Northern Territory in respect of a matter nearly ten years ago.<br />
You insinuate in your questions that the Prime Minister had a conflict of<br />
interest in proposing to the then Cabinet that the Northern Territory<br />
Government be granted a right to borrow a global limit of monies to be<br />
employed at its discretion for public works.<br />
The Prime Minister had no conflict of interest whatsoever. He responded to<br />
an express proposal from a Coalition Government in the Northern Territory<br />
a proposal which was itself only agreed over time, and with offsets. The fact<br />
that he was acquainted with Mr Anderson of Tipperary Developments, the<br />
ultimate successful tenderer on the projects in question, was immaterial.<br />
No Commonwealth tender was involved. It was not the Commonwealth doing<br />
the borrowing or awarding the work it was a Territory setting its own<br />
priorities and awarding work under its own processes. The Commonwealth<br />
merely agreed an upper limit on what it might borrow in any particular year.<br />
And even this figure was not binding on a State or Territory.<br />
All State and Territory global borrowing limits include proposals for civic<br />
works undertaken by many Australian construction firms and developers,<br />
many of whom are and would be known personally to the Prime Minister or to<br />
the Treasurer of the day.<br />
You asked why the Prime Minister, when Treasurer, did not declare on his<br />
Parliamentary Pecuniary Interest register travel to Tipperary Station in 1986<br />
and 1987 on Mr Anderson's plane.<br />
Mr Anderson invited the then Treasurer, a personal friend, to his property<br />
only for the purpose of seeing and visiting that property. It had no connection<br />
whatsoever with his duties as Treasurer. It was purely a private visit. Private </p>
<p>domestic travel and accommodation by personal friends is outside the scope<br />
of the pecuniary interests register of Members or Ministers, as a cursory<br />
perusal will reveal.<br />
The Prime Minister visited the station Tipperary in 1986 and 1987 during its<br />
development phase, and has not visited it since.<br />
I have attached a copy of the relevant sections of the guidelines on<br />
Ministerial interests. Were your interpretation of the rules for declarations to<br />
be accepted, Members would have to declare all accommodation and travel<br />
provided by any friend or relative.<br />
At any rate Mr Keating's visits to Tipperary were well reported at the time,<br />
especially when Mr Keating told a Canberra press conference that he had<br />
recently been in the Territory " shooting pigs".<br />
Let me conclude on the following points:<br />
The Prime Minister regards these questions as not investigative journalism,<br />
but simply harassment. Your editor-in-chief has confirmed that you were<br />
sooled onto this non-story by the Liberal Party.<br />
This issue has been raked over by Mr Keating's opponents years ago and<br />
everything that needs to be known of it is known. He regards you both as<br />
doing the Liberal and National parties' bidding. This issue is being hawked<br />
about by them it does neither of you credit to take it up.<br />
I know you must think yourselves hard-hitting investigative journalists but<br />
this little effort locates you at the bottom of the journalistic food chain.<br />
The Prime Minister has an unblemished record for probity over 26 years of<br />
public life. Your sordid insinuations of a conflict of interest or corruption are<br />
as fanciful as they are offensive. They are also defamatory. You would do<br />
well to weigh your conspiracy theories carefully against the facts.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
Greg Turnbull<br />
Senior Media Adviser </p>

Gifts received by Minisitrs and thecir families from1 family memibers or personal friends in<br />
a purely personal capacity need not bc disclosed unless the Minister judges that an<br />
appcarancc of a conflict of interest might otherwisc arise.<br />
212. FTravcl anod Hospirtality<br />
Ministers, sponsored travel generally relaes to overseas travel becca use of thle<br />
automatic travel entitlements they have within Australia. The rules regarding sponsored<br />
overseas travel are as follows.<br />
Overseas travel is to be regarded as sponsored where arty part of the costs, including<br />
fares, accommodation and living expenses, is not borne by the Minister or the Australian<br />
Government. Ministers should be aware of the possibility that conflicts of interests may arise or be<br />
seen to arise through acceptance of sponsored ovcrseas travel by members of their<br />
famnilie.. Ministers should not accept for themselves or for their families offcrs of sponsored<br />
overseas travel from: any source, whether connect ed directly with their responsibilities or<br />
riot, subject ( 0 the following.-<br />
The Prime Minister tnay authorise acceptance of such travel in a particular case.<br />
His athorisation should be sought in advance.<br />
A Minister need not seek authorisation to accept guest of government<br />
arrangements granted to the Minister during an official visit to a particular<br />
country. ( In cases where there may be foreign policy implications in accepting<br />
guest of government status, Ministers should consult the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs.) Acceptance of incidental meals, entertainment and other hospitality in the course<br />
of an overseas visit, including, for example, home accommodation offered on a<br />
personal basis, is a matter for the judgment of the Minister having regard to any<br />
conflict or appearance of tonflict between intere. it and duty that may arise.<br />
If sponsored travel bt accepted under points or above, it must be disclosed. The<br />
purposc of the spon~ sored travel should be shown. It is not necessary to disclose<br />
acceptance of Ruest of government arrangemecnts see above granted during<br />
official overseas visits.<br />
Mhe rules regarding sponsored travel by Ministers within Australia are necessarily less<br />
fixed. Hospitality ( which may or may not be associated with travel) is a related issue.<br />
In deciding whether to ACCEPT sponsored travel or hospitality in Australia, a Minister<br />
should exercise hist or her judgment having regard to any conflict or appearance of<br />
conflict of interests that may arise. </p>
<p>GOVERNMENT DIVISION 7<br />
In deciding whether any sponsored travel or hospitality which has been accepted in<br />
Australia should be JtrJ. G ER1FD, the Minister should again exercise judgment. If travel<br />
or hospitality has been accepted which may give rise to an appearance of a conflict of<br />
interests, it should be disclosed.<br />
In relation to hospitality, the Minister may find it helpful to consider the following<br />
guidance provided to Members of the House of Representatives by the Registrar, to assist<br />
Members in deciding what they n~ eed to disclose:<br />
' Hospitality" refers to free or concessional accommodation providcd to the Mcnibcr, the<br />
Memnbcr's spouse or dcpcndcnt children wholly or partly by any pcrson, organisation,<br />
business or interest group or foreign Government or its reprcscntative. It includes the<br />
provision of free or concessional meals provided as part of an accommodation<br />
arrangement but does not include hospitality provided in a purely social way by friends or<br />
colleagues. Entertainment rcceived from concerned constituents and intcrcst groups<br />
legitimately exercising their powers of political persuasion, explanation, or argunicnt on<br />
the mcrits of an issuc to further a particular cause or concern need not be included. Thcrc<br />
is also no necd to include crcrtainmcnt receivcd in common with significant numbers of<br />
othcr Members or persons such as a reception or dinner hostcd by a High Commiissioner<br />
or Amnbassador.'<br />
13. Membership of Organisations<br />
P<br />
Membership of all associations, professional and recreational, which have aimsr and<br />
objectives which could be affected by Government action ( particularly in matters for<br />
which they have portfolio responsibility), should be inclu~ ded unions or professional<br />
associations). 14. Other Intcrests<br />
List any other interest which, in the opinion of the Minister, holdLs the potential for a real<br />
or apparent conflict of interest with thc Minister's duties to arise. GV. N9M4T DI1I5I0N41 . Naon. 026 P. 09 </p>
