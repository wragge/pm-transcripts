ADDRESS TO THE ATUA\ L NE? SOUtlH -IES LIBERAL PARPTY STAT IC ONVEN7TC N<br />
It is very good to be able to speak at this Liberal Party Convention<br />
so soon after this Government's second Budget has been delivered<br />
a Budget which takes decisive and dramatic steps towards establishing<br />
the kind of Australia that the overwhelming majority of Australians<br />
want; a Budget that encourages the best efforts of all to<br />
endeavour to achieve in the knowledge that achievement will be<br />
rewarded; a Budget that assists the poor and the disadvantaged.<br />
This Budget demonstrates beyond all doubt that our commitment<br />
to a fresh start, a new direction is being fulfilled.<br />
This Budget demonstrates that a responsible and effective<br />
Government can attack inflation and at the same time it can<br />
aid the disadvantaged ; it can provide people with greater freedom<br />
to make their own decisions about working, spending and savinrg;<br />
it can provide the greatest impetus to Australian's confidence<br />
in tlhe future.<br />
This Budget demonstrates the relevance of Liberal philosophy to<br />
Australian society. It underlines if any underlininjg was<br />
necessary the stark contrast between the philosophy of Liberalism,<br />
and the doctrinaire approach to the Labor Party a<br />
doctrinaire approach which restricts individual choice, maximises<br />
Government control and stifles the energy and enthusiasm of<br />
Australians. Soime say that memories are short, but the disastrous Labor years<br />
are inieilible. The Labor Party knows that the Australian people<br />
won't forget the damage the A. L. P. government did Australia.<br />
That is why the A. L. P. is pretending they have changed<br />
that is why Mr Whitlam of all people is saying that Labor<br />
made mistrakes; and that from now on they will be economically<br />
responsible. Yesterday we saw what they meant by economic responsibility when<br />
Mr Whitlam, Mr Tfayden, the Labor Party's economic manager, and<br />
Mr Hurford the Shadow Treasurer gave a press conference.<br />
Mr Hayden said that the Labor Party had no commitment to pocsonal,<br />
tax indexation, but Mr Hurford said that personal tax indexation<br />
was A. L. P. policy. Mr Hayden said that the Labor Party did not<br />
conmmit itself to our tax reforms, but Mr Hurford seemed to rule<br />
out the scheme entirely. Mr Hayden said that he could definitely<br />
calculate some figures, Mr Hurford said he couldn't. </p>
<p>That is the way they ran the Labor Government.<br />
Labor are still-the party of economic irresponsibility, higher<br />
taxes, higher inflation, higher unemployment. The evidence is<br />
there for all to see in Labor's latest excursion into economic<br />
irresponsibility the economic strategy statement published<br />
here in Sydney a week ago.<br />
That Labor document implies a deficit of $ 3.5 billion, a<br />
increase over the $ 2.2 billion deficit we have budgeted for this ., cr.<br />
They obviously want to get back to the deficits of the Labor years.<br />
They pretend that they can increase the deficit, lower interest<br />
rates and cure unemployment all in one breath. But to financa<br />
their deficit they would have to resor-t to the printing press again,<br />
and raise taxes and interest rates again. This would undermine<br />
the exchange rate, give a boost to inflation, provide no real<br />
hope for the unemployed, and put an end -to growth and increased<br />
pros3Derity. Labor's " strategy" is quite simply a recipe for<br />
economic disaster.<br />
Since our government was elected we have made significant<br />
progress in restoring the economy. After just 20 months in of ficW<br />
inflation has been markedly reduced, real growth has been<br />
restored, the expansion of big government has been halted, and<br />
government spending has been contained.<br />
These actions have made it possible progressively to reduce -the<br />
burden of taxation. Indexation announced in May last year stopped<br />
the big tax rake off, it provides a cut in tax on 1 July<br />
every year to protect against inflation; the investment<br />
allowance and the stock valuation adjustment reduced tax payable<br />
by companies<br />
All in all, last year's tax reforms put $ 2000 million extra in the<br />
hands of individuals and businesses. In addition, last year<br />
saw greatly improved social security programmes automatic<br />
indexation is now protecting pensions and benefits against<br />
inflation; the family allowance scheme is the largest and<br />
most effective single innovation in our welfare system for many<br />
years. Our second Budget has consolidated on these achievements<br />
and represents a further major step forward. First<br />
and foremost the Budget will further advance our fight against<br />
inflation. The deficit for the second time has been reduced<br />
by over a half a billion dollars government expenditure<br />
has been contained to around zero-growth in real terms.<br />
Because we have exercised stringent control over government<br />
expenditure, we have been able to introduce revolutionary<br />
reforms to the personal tax system.<br />
The government had a choice to make whether it would spend more<br />
on its own programmes, or whether it would provide tax relief<br />
for people. We chose to help people.<br />
our tax reforms directly reduce the tax payable by every taxpayer.<br />
They constitute a most far-reaching overhaul of our burdensome,<br />
complex tax system; they simplify the tax scales; they restore<br />
incentive to work harder and more productively and to earn more;<br />
they give people the power to decide how a greater part of their<br />
income is spent. / 3 </p>
<p>As from February 1, there will be just three tax rates.<br />
By raising the tax threshold 225,000 additional taxpayers<br />
including many pensio. ners3, stucknts, and other low-income earners<br />
will pay no tax. A single person earning less than $ 3750<br />
will pay no tax; and a married person with a dependent spouseearning<br />
less than $ 5485 . will not pay tax. 902 of taxpayers<br />
wil 1 pay only the standard tax rate of 32%. These taxpayers<br />
will no longer be subject to escalating marginal rates, until<br />
their income exceeds $ 16,000. They will all, in effect,<br />
have the benefits of tax averaging, which will protect them<br />
from the disadvantages associated with fluctuating incomes.<br />
The reductions in tax resulting from tax indexation and our latest<br />
reforms are very substantial. For taxpayers with a dependent<br />
spouse, earning $ 7,000 a year will save 33% in tax;<br />
earning $ 8000 a year, will save 25%; on $ 18,000 a year<br />
they will save 20% in tax.<br />
The benefits to taxpayers of the reformed tax system being<br />
introduced on 1 February next will be $ 406 million in 1977-78.<br />
This is in addition to the further benefits of $ 965 million<br />
brought by this year's tax indexation. In total this year,<br />
therefore, the benefits to taxpayers from tax indexation and<br />
the tax reforms will be $ 1371 million.<br />
In 1978-79 the benefits to taxpayers from the tax reform will be<br />
$ 1390 million, plus a further $ 467 million from tax indexation<br />
this adds up to $ 1857 million.<br />
Had there been no new tax reform the benefits to taxpayers<br />
would have been $ 973 million less.<br />
Because these tax reforms have been achieved within a budget<br />
which further strengthens the fight against inflation and<br />
significantly reduces the deficit, circumstances are also<br />
conducive to a much-needed fall in interest rates.<br />
Other features of this budget are that it announces moves<br />
towards an energy pricing structure which should encourage the<br />
search for new energy sources and ensure greater efficiency<br />
in the use of existing resources. The total effect of the<br />
increase in petrol prices on the C. P. I. is estimated at 0.9%,<br />
and this effect will be spread throughout the year.<br />
Ths Budget provides for a small increase in company tax to help<br />
finance the reform of the personal income tax system.<br />
Company incomes have risen rapidly over the last two years,<br />
and the estimated yield of $ 203 million from the company tax<br />
increase is small compared with the $ 600 million which companies<br />
gain this year from concessions introduced in 1976.<br />
It should be noted that the Federal Government has not raised indirect<br />
taxes this year in a way which will have heavy impact on the<br />
December quarter CPI. We expect the States to follow this lead.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>The incr-eased allocation from the Commonwealth this year<br />
the 14% rise in urnt. ed grants and loan funds -to the States<br />
and thc 18%, L rise in grants to local1 government provide<br />
adequate scope for them to hold their charges.<br />
The budget provides over $ 100 million to fund employment<br />
training programmes designed particularly -to alleviate<br />
youth unemployment. These programmes have achieved an<br />
encouraging degree of success and so far a total of 101,000<br />
people have benefitted from them. If necessary, we will<br />
increase our spending on these employment training programmes<br />
over the year because we are determined to assist every<br />
eligible applicant who seeks support under any one of these<br />
programmes. The Budget reflects our philosophy of providing effective<br />
assistance to the underprivileged and those most in need.<br />
While government spending overall has been kept under tight<br />
restraint, every social security benefit and pension has<br />
been protected. There also is a very large boost in special<br />
assistance to the handicapped. The terms of eligibility for<br />
assistance have been liberalised, and spending will increase<br />
33% on last year.<br />
our historic reform introduced last year of family allowances<br />
continues to assist directly all mothers in our commu<br />
and overall expenditure on programmes of direct assista~ nce<br />
to Aboriginals is up almost<br />
This Budget charts the course for a further expansion of the<br />
economy during 1977-78. Gross Domestic Product is budgeted<br />
to grow at a moderate rate over this financial year.<br />
As the year progresses and the government's policies<br />
bear down further on inflation activity will strengthen further.<br />
This will be assisted by the large increase in everyone's disposoe<br />
income flowing from the reform of the personal income tax system.<br />
This opportunity for further economic progress and a greater<br />
reduction Jn inflation will in large part depend on moderattion<br />
in wage inr: 7reases.<br />
The Government has consistently argued before the<br />
Arbitration Commission for substantial wage restraint.<br />
Yet in the financial year just ended, the rise in average<br />
weekly earnings outstripped inflation. </p>
<p>Tt is essential. -that a flirer li-ne is t-aken in moderating w-, age<br />
riseos. Thiis is tho fasta,, st \ vay to reduce inflation and<br />
restorecemploy-ment opportu'niiuies. The tax cuts we have<br />
. Ln~ ouce should great-ly, assilst in achieving this modration.<br />
We heard a lot earlior this year from union leaders who C; saild<br />
t1hat they would exercise restra:, int in wage cla iis if t ax cuts<br />
wmedr e. Wel sb-anta tax C have been made, and union<br />
. cadlels shiould L_ tink hard about the statements -they made earlier<br />
this vear. They have a mtajor responsibility to ensure that w~ acoe<br />
claims are kl-pt to a minimuit. A sense of responsibil it y Is<br />
-vital for tlhe success of the national fight ag~ ainst inflation,<br />
and it is vital to Prevent further unemployment.<br />
As a recent survey showed, large-: wage rises compel businesses<br />
to reduce labour or obt'-ciin supplies -from overseas. A w age rise<br />
may seem to confer a short-lived benefit on) those emr. ployed, but<br />
it -iS Of no0 u1S to those wh, 1-o become unemploy,' ed as a direct rcesult.<br />
A responsible union approach to industrial disputes is also vital.<br />
And w, e have legislated to bring greater justice, com-mon sense and<br />
consull ation to industrial relations. We have established the<br />
industrial Relations Bureau, a_-nd the N11ational Labour Consultative<br />
Council We have legislated to prov-ide for secreL pustal ballot-s<br />
for the election of officors of unions registered uLnder the<br />
Concil. 11ation and Arbitration Act, and to limit their term oF<br />
ofjfice to four vears. 1We have amended the TIrade Practices At'-<br />
to ba n da2maging secondary boycotts b, em , ployees which dono<br />
concern disputes over colidition, s of epomn. Orfr u<br />
fair : rndustrial policy has achieved aj si 71i4ficant reductionnm<br />
the level of industrial disputeos.<br />
This year, we have had by fEar the lowest level of industrial<br />
dispute . s -this decade. During the first five months, 559,000<br />
workling days have been lost, compared6 to almiost 4 million days<br />
lost for -the comparable period in 1974. F3uIt tha~ t is -no cause<br />
for rela-xati-on of our policies.<br />

Many private employers already have far wider powers -to stand<br />
down employees than the new Act provides, for the Arbitration<br />
Commission and various State arbitral bodies have in many cases<br />
inserted in awards autom--Latic stand-down provisions.<br />
These provisions typicallv enable employees to be stood down if for<br />
any reason beyond the employer's control there is inadequate<br />
work available. The new Commonwealth Bill is limited to work<br />
being unavailable because of industrial disputes.<br />
The new Bill provides essential additional powers to the<br />
Commonwealth which are neither unusual nor unreasonable.<br />
And after all, unlike a private employer, the Commonwealth has<br />
the additional responsibility of looking after the public interest.<br />
We hope that it will not be necessary to use this legislation and0<br />
we intend that the Bill will be passed by the Parliament but<br />
not be proclaimed to operate unless circumstances so dictate.<br />
As a result of events of the last day or two, the A. P. T. U.<br />
Federal Executive directed that the New South Wales Branch<br />
lift bans. Members are going back to work.<br />
The great majority of Commonwealth employees and unions have<br />
behaved responsibly. This legislation is directed at the small<br />
irresponsible minority.<br />
The feature which distinguishes Government employees is th E4r<br />
responsibility for providing services essential to the operatcion<br />
of our community. The Government will not tolerate these services<br />
being disrupted.<br />
The Budget brought down last Tuesday offers to Australians<br />
the incentive to work harder and increase their earnings;<br />
the prospect that the ravages of inflation will be reduced;<br />
the benefits of an expanding economy; and at the same tima<br />
the provision of effective assistance to -those most in need.<br />
It is a Budget we can be proud of.<br />
It's no wonder -that the Labor Party is so desperately tryincg to<br />
confuse the public about the facts. Before the Budget they tried to<br />
frighten the old and the weak by saying that there would be cuts in<br />
social welfare payments to individuals.<br />
Now that these fears have been dispelled they are trying to<br />
deceive the public about our tax reforms.<br />
It's up to all of us to make sure they don't succeed in their<br />
campaign of deception facts are more CV Ult:-an deceptions,<br />
and the fact is that by a single decisive stroke of policy, the<br />
Government is able to provide all Australians with the assurance<br />
that endeavour will be encouraged,. that skills will be<br />
worth acquiring, that initiatives will be worth taking and<br />
that effort will be rewarded.. 000000QOQOO~ ooAQTOTQASCEHEE D TABLE. </p>
