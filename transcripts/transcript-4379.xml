FOR PRESS 25 APRIL 1.977<br />
VICTORIAN OIL DISPUTE<br />
The Prime Minister sent the following message this evening<br />
to the Premier of Victoria:<br />
" I have not seen any reply yet to my telex yesterday<br />
about the emergency in Victoria. I understand fully<br />
that in this matter Victoria has complete powers and<br />
that you may well have arrangements in hand that you<br />
would not want to foreshadow to those who appear bent<br />
on bringing the State to a standstill. I do, however,<br />
feel that consultation between us in this matter would<br />
be of benefit to your Government. We stand ready to<br />
join in discussions at any time. But of course if you<br />
feel this is not required, then no doubt you will let<br />
me know.<br />
I havre tonight asked my Department to seek from your<br />
Department precise information as to supplies for emergency<br />
services. My view is that these must be protected at all<br />
costs and that if necessary strong action should be taken<br />
to ensure this. This again is an area in which we may be<br />
able to help or to take action." </p>
