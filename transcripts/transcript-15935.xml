    <content><![CDATA[<p>A calligraphy version of the Apology Motion was unveiled today by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd at Parliament House to mark the 10th anniversary of National Sorry Day.</p>
<p>The manuscript of the historic â€˜Motion of Apology to Australia's Indigenous Peoples'  was produced by Canberra artist Gemma Black on calfskin.</p>
<p>The artwork is intended to provide a permanent acknowledgement of the past, and a reminder that we must harness the determination of all Australians to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.  </p>
<p>Sorry Day has been commemorated on 26 May since 1998 after it was included in the recommendations of the Bringing Them Home report.</p>
<p>This year, the Australian Government has provided funding to 26 organisations to support activities across the country.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to working with Stolen Generations to make sure their voices are heard in the development of targeted programs to help heal the pain.</p>
<p>In June 2008, the Government will meet with Stolen Generations members, professionals in women's and men's health, trauma, child protection and mental health specialists and family reunion services to map a way forward together. </p>
<p>The Department of Health will consult with Stolen Generations on the development of a training program and materials for mainstream health services providers on Stolen Generations issues.</p>
<p>Since the election, the Government has committed more than $1.2 billion over five years to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians including undertaking major programs of work in early childhood development, education, health, community safety, employment, economic participation, welfare reform and governance and leadership.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government commends the selfless work of the Stolen Generations organisations in the lead up to the apology and looks forward to continuing the partnership into the future.</p>
