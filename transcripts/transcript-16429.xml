    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government has today announced a 15-member Advisory Council to help drive its new national approach to lifting Australia's organ and tissue donation and transplantation rates.</p>
<p>The Advisory Council will be headed by businessman and double-lung transplant recipient Sam Chisholm.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the membership of the Advisory Council when he launched the ACT Australian Organ Donor Awareness Week today.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is committed to establishing Australia as a world leader in best practice organ and tissue donation for transplants.</p>
<p>Despite more than 90 per cent of Australians supporting the idea of organ donation, Australia has a longstanding shortage of organs for transplantation, with nearly 1,800 Australians on official transplant waiting lists.</p>
<p>The Advisory Council will support the recently-appointed Chief Executive Officer of the new Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority, Karen Murphy.</p>
<p>Together these organisations will lead a best practice, coordinated national approach to organ and tissue donation for transplant in Australia. The Advisory Council will be comprised of a cross-section of people across Australia involved in the organ and tissue donation sector.</p>
<p>This new body will bring the widest possible perspective to help drive the Government's much-needed reforms in this area  -  from the Chair's own experience as a transplant recipient, to a range of stakeholder and consumer interests, including donor families, people awaiting transplants, health professionals and experts in the field.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is investing an unprecedented $151.1 million over the next four years to reform organ and tissue donation in Australia and boost the number of life-saving and life-transforming transplants.</p>
<p>These reforms present a genuine opportunity to make a real difference to the lives of thousands of Australians. We are committed to achieving a significant and lasting increase in the number of transplants in Australia.</p>
<p>A key element of the reforms is a four-year national community education and awareness program to give Australians regular, clear, factual and relevant information about organ and tissue donation, the benefits of transplantation, and how they can make a difference.</p>
<p>The campaign is encouraging all Australians to discuss their wishes about donation with their family, friends and loved ones.</p>
