    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will invest $5.8 million to provide equipment for a comprehensive cancer centre at Coffs Harbour Hospital, as part of the North Coast Cancer Institute Regional Cancer Service.</p>
<p>With some cancers, patients from rural areas are up to three times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis than their counterparts in urban areas. This $5.8 million investment in Coffs Harbour will work towards improving the services and care for the more than 32,000 NSW residents diagnosed with cancer each year.</p>
<p>The investment will fund the purchase of a new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine.</p>
<p>It is part of a $19.7 million investment which will bring new equipment to the facility's Coffs Harbour, Lismore and Port Macquarie campuses.</p>
<p>This includes a second linear accelerator and a Positron Emissions Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scanner and accommodation at Lismore, and a new linear accelerator at Port Macquarie.</p>
<p>The additional infrastructure will also underpin planning for future expansion of radiotherapy services in this region.</p>
<p>This initiative builds on the Rudd Government's investment of $8.6 million to expand the Coffs Harbour Hospital. This includes $8.2 million for the emergency department and more than $400,000 to reduce the elective surgery waiting list.</p>
<p>While Australia has better overall cancer survival rates than comparable countries, there is still unacceptable variation for some people, depending on the type of cancer, a person's socioeconomic status or where they live.</p>
<p>The integrated North Coast Cancer Institute forms part of the Rudd Government's $560 million commitment to establish regional cancer centres so that Australians can get care closer to home and their community.</p>
<p>Since coming into office, the Government has committed over $2.3 billion in cancer infrastructure, medicines, screening and research.</p>
<p>Today's announcement also shows the benefit of the Federal Government stepping up to the plate and providing funding for health services across Australia.</p>
<p>Under the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Rudd Government would provide 60 per cent of the funding for capital upgrades for public hospitals.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's plan will see health services funded nationally and run locally through local hospital networks to deliver better outcomes for local communities. </p>
