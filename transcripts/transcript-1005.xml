HOSKINS FAILY IEMORIAL SERVICE AT HOSKINS<br />
MEMORIAL CHURCH, LITHGOW, NSW. 17TH OCTOBER, 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
It's a very great honour to be here and to be<br />
asked to speak on such a notable family occasion. I'm a very<br />
old friend, I'm happy to my, of several of the distinguished<br />
members of the family. I was warned by one of them that on<br />
this occasion I should not embarrass the family by talking<br />
about it. Having met scores of members of the famil having<br />
been across the road compassed about by a great clou of<br />
witnesses all of whom appeared to be Hoskins, I dare not omit<br />
to speak about them. Indeed, that is what I am here for.<br />
And being a Presbyterian, Sir, I like a text,<br />
and my text, though it hasn't Tound entrance to the Authorised<br />
Version and still remains in the Apocrypha, it is a great one,<br />
a suitable one " Let us now praise famous men and our fathers<br />
which begat us." There can be no more splendid invocation<br />
than that* because we are praising today, with our memories and<br />
with our prayers, notable people, people who were creators<br />
in this country, people who have not merely lived and passed<br />
on but who have left this country in their debt. We are<br />
celebrating an uncommon family and therefore uncommon<br />
individuals. Now Sir, the. history of the Hoskins family in<br />
Australia, running back now over 112 years if I mistake not<br />
is a very remarkable ine. I was fascinated to discover when<br />
I was informed of some of the details that at one stage the<br />
founder of this shall I call it a dynasty in Australia<br />
worked in Ballarat. This at least gives me some faint contact,<br />
in terms of place, if not in terms of quality, because I was<br />
at school in Ballarat and my parents were born in Ballarat, and<br />
so the family lines have merged to that extent.<br />
But the story of this family, Sir, is a matter<br />
for pride for the family and it is a matter of gratitude for<br />
the country. Having said that, I would like to add that it<br />
gives all of us something to ponder.<br />
, ie all know, don't we, that this has been described<br />
as the age of the common man. I want to say something to you<br />
about that. I remember during this last war making a speech<br />
in London in which I used the phrase the common man. I<br />
used it I thought in a very appropriate way on that occasion<br />
because I was referring to the behaviour of the people in<br />
Great Britain under the bombs, under attack, and I said it was<br />
an age in which the common man had become a king. But I had<br />
letters from people, 9uite a few, protesting against the use of<br />
the word " common as if it involved some condescension. Perhaps<br />
I" c hoamdm obne" t tiesr oneex polfa int hotsoe ywoour dast oinnc eo, u r ilta ndgoueasgne' t. w hicThh eh asw oardn<br />
almost infinite variety of meanings. You may say, " That's a<br />
very common fellow." You don't mean something pleasant. You<br />
may say that the Elder Pitt was the great commoner. Not<br />
offensive on the contrary. You may say that a Royal personage<br />
has married a commoner. There are enormous varieties oJ meanings<br />
to be found. But it has been said and said in some senses with / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
profound truth that this is the age of the common man. It's a<br />
Areat truth so long as we understand what it means. I want<br />
o give you two reasons for saying it's true, before I make a<br />
certain gloss upon it.<br />
The first is that true democracy, that which we<br />
all in our own ways try to practice in Australia, true democracy<br />
seeks to achieve not justice to a few or something for the<br />
talented but justice for all men, for all women, and regards<br />
the good life of the individual as the ultimate aim of government.<br />
This is worth remembering.<br />
PolitiCs is not a matter of loaves and fishes<br />
entirely. Loaves and fishes may come into our economic life,<br />
but the essence of it is that in our ways whatever our party<br />
beliefs may be, we must all the time be stru] ling for the good<br />
life for the individual because that will be -he ultimate test<br />
of the value of whatever contribution we make to our country.<br />
And in the second place in all times of crisis ( we can say<br />
this with pride), in all times of crisis for the nation it is<br />
the spirit of the ordinary man and the ordinary woman tAat has<br />
provided the foundation of survival and successi<br />
I had the great honourt as you know, of enjoying<br />
the close personal friendship of V.; inston Churchill, and like<br />
you, I shall never forget how his w.' rds rang out and gave<br />
encoaragement and hope and confidence to his people and to<br />
people all round the world, and yet he was the first to know<br />
and to concede that he wasn't creating something in the<br />
individual; he was evoking from the individual something that<br />
was there. This courage and determination came from ordinary<br />
men and women and he made their deepest feelings vocal. It was<br />
he who led out something which is part of the genius of the<br />
common man the common individual, the ordinary person in a<br />
community like ours.<br />
Now Sir, having said that let me look at the<br />
other side of tAe picture. I rather think it would be a calamity<br />
if our applause of the age of the common man for the reasons<br />
that I have just been stating induced us to yield to the<br />
temptation to resent or reject the uncommon man. This is a<br />
great danger. One sees occasionally a symptom of it the<br />
little flashes of jealousy, of hatred, of malice. This is too<br />
easy a strong temptation; it s easy enough to yield to it,<br />
and therefore, to look at the uncommon man as if he ran counter<br />
to the pattern of life that I have just been saying something<br />
about. Mj reason for saying that we must not yield to that<br />
temptation is that in all history it has been well established<br />
that it is, after all, the uncommon man who initiates ideas,<br />
who provides leadership, who has honourable and powerful<br />
ambitions who supplies the driving force who has a capacity<br />
for industr beyond the minimum of obligation, who has sufficient<br />
courage to efy disaster and not to be misled by temporary<br />
success. This is some bfinition, I think, of the uncommon<br />
man and it is appropriate to refer to him because the founder<br />
of this notable family was an uncommon man. He answered to all<br />
of these things that I have been Ulking about.<br />
And that adds up, Sir, to this, that the ordinary<br />
man must have a proper pride, should never be over-anxious to<br />
submerge himself or to be misled, but at the same time, he<br />
must aIways have a belief a true belief, a true appreciation<br />
in and of the quality of the uncommon man. low of course the<br />
uncommon man, ir, the uncommon man may turn out to be a tyrant,<br />
a dictator, and therefore a destroyer if he forgets that the<br />
" i a / 3 </p>
<p>-53-<br />
spirit and happiness of the common man is his chief concern and<br />
that his ambition must be for the people and not for himself.<br />
Let me apply those ideas by one or two examples that<br />
will readily come to your own mind. Hitler, of course, was the<br />
latest in this century he was an uncommon man, who turned<br />
out to be a destroyer so that he had to be destroyed.<br />
Nlapoleon, who overshadowed Europe, who overshadowe dthe then<br />
known world in the height of his military successes, his military<br />
genius, he was an uncommon man. Nobody would doubt if for a<br />
moment. But what did he achieve? Measur-e what he did against<br />
its defect for the common man, its value for the common man, the<br />
ordinary man. I remember standing once in Paris looking<br />
through the irc de Carousel right up the Place A. e la Concorde<br />
to the Arc de Triomphie at tUe o her end and this beautiful<br />
arch is covered with the boastful record of Napoleon's victories,<br />
his conquests of this piece of land or that piece of land.<br />
Yothing remains except the marble the victories forgotten, the<br />
victories fruitless, the conquered lands once more free. Here<br />
is a boasting piece of marble* the uncommon man, who in all<br />
those respects failed in his duty to the common man.<br />
On the other hand, we may think of people I don't<br />
need to name very many of them Shaftesbury, in England the<br />
founder of factories lTegislation, the true beginner of all the<br />
humane industrial legislation that has come to us since this<br />
so-called remote aristocrat the uncommon man, a tremendous<br />
benefactor of ordinary people. Lincoln, in America-the great<br />
industrial creators in our own country, because don't forget<br />
that there are two kinds of people who come to great wealth and<br />
position in the country. There are those who make money because<br />
they are good at making money. There are those who make money<br />
or power or influence be cause they have created something and<br />
maintained something for the benefit of other people. Anid the<br />
fact that they have some benefit from it is no more to say than<br />
to say that t~ ie labourer is worthy of his hire. The great<br />
names I won t make invidious distinctions, but I could at the<br />
slightest thought mention five or six great names in industrial,<br />
manufacturing, mining history in Australia who are the names<br />
who would be Ihe names of people who were uncommon men and wLi<br />
have laid common men under heavy tribute.<br />
I was looking the other day, once more Sir in the<br />
Gospel according to Matthew at the parable of the talents.<br />
There is one word in it which deserves emphasis because you<br />
remember that when those who had five talents, two talents, went<br />
away and put them to work, did some thing ith them, and came<br />
back having doubled them the word that was spoken was, eli<br />
done thou good and faith{ ul servant". True, true, they were<br />
the servants of the master who had given them the talents, but<br />
they were also servants because nobody could have done what they<br />
did without serving some good public or private end. The<br />
uncommon man. Wlhenever we are fortunate to encounter him he<br />
is the servant of the country and the servant of his people, and<br />
there is every reminder of that as wie stand or sit in this place<br />
on this most notable occasion.<br />
I wonder, Asir, if I might conclude my remarks by<br />
saying that many years ago, I read for the first time and that<br />
was a great event Robert Louis Stevenson's " Child's Garden<br />
of Verses". There may be people here who have become so grown-up<br />
that they think they have outgrown them. I hope not. I hope<br />
not because Robert Louis Stevenson will himself never grow old<br />
in the minds of people, and his " Child's Garden of Verses"<br />
remains a joy forever. Remember the poem about the river and IA </p>
<p>4-<br />
the children putting their little boats into the river and<br />
floating them away, 0and exciting childish pleasure? And<br />
then it goes on " Away down the river<br />
A hundred miles or more<br />
Other little children<br />
Shall bring our boats ashore"<br />
This verse has stuck in my mind. It has, in my own case,<br />
continued to have a profound effect on my owvn mind....<br />
" Other little children will bringr our boats to shore".....<br />
Other little children will benefit or suffer, according to<br />
our virtue or our vice; every time wie do something that is<br />
at all significant, vie are launching a little boat on the<br />
river of life, and other little children will bring it to<br />
shore. Let us never forget about that.<br />
No man could be a great nioneer and constructor as<br />
the founder of this family was if he had thought only of<br />
today. He must, from time to time, have looked forward and<br />
have said, " Yes, if I can do this, then we can do so-and-so,<br />
then we'll do something else," looking to the future,<br />
conscious of the fact, as wie all must be, that wve are not<br />
here today and cgone tomorrow but that we have our little<br />
mark to make for good or evil, and the mark doesn't rub out<br />
too quickly That's why I think that that is a geat poem,<br />
a -i-onderful poem deserves to live with us, as I indeed I<br />
hope I may say it has lived with me.<br />
And so here today in the presence of so many members<br />
of this family, this famous family, recalling the achievements<br />
of this family, I would like to think that we, like themselves,<br />
will look forward with thankfulness for what has been done<br />
and with a profound hope that when our boats come to shore,<br />
they wrill be found by happy children in a happy world all<br />
the better because we launched our boat. </p>
