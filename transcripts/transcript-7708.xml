CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW POST-BUDGET DINNER<br />
MELBOURNE 16 AUGUST 1989<br />
Seven years ago, around this time of year, the then Federal<br />
Treasurer John Howard brought down the seventh Budget of the<br />
Fraser Liberal-National Government.<br />
Last night, Paul Keating brought down the seventh budget of<br />
this Labor Government.<br />
The contrast between the two Budgets as statements of<br />
political leadership and of economic management could not<br />
be more stark.<br />
The Liberals produced a Budget that was the quintessential<br />
failure of nerve a Budget that put the needs of the nation<br />
firmly in second place behind a doomed attempt at electoral<br />
survival. The results of that lack of leadership were very clear and<br />
they were very painful:<br />
the worst recession Australia had known since the<br />
Great Depression;<br />
double digit unemployment and double digit<br />
inflation a unique, and tragic, testimony to<br />
economic mismanagement; and<br />
a massive prospective Budget deficit of more than<br />
$ 9 billion.<br />
The Liberals' 1982 Budget marked a vital turning point: it<br />
was the last of the pork-barrel budgets.<br />
And it taught a vital lesson: Governments that frame<br />
budgets looking only towards an imminent election do not<br />
only the nation, but also themselves, a gross disservice.<br />
The truth of this lesson about political leadership is borne<br />
out by the dramatic transformation that has taken place<br />
since the election of this Government. </p>
<p>There has of course been a shift in policy away from<br />
confrontation towards the deliberate process of detailed<br />
analytical study and consultation; away from protected<br />
isolation to vigorous participation in the global economy.<br />
There has been a comparable shift in community attitudes.<br />
Increasingly, Australians have come to understand that the<br />
habits of uncompetitiveness and the practices of<br />
confrontationism that were fostered by the conservatives for<br />
most of the post-war decades must be abandoned.<br />
We have come to a clearer understanding of the nature of the<br />
economic challenge facing our country.<br />
wage earners have understood that wage restraint creates<br />
jobs some one and a half million since 1983 and boosts<br />
international competitiveness; that greater work<br />
effectiveness creates a greater economic capacity to pay<br />
wages. Industries that were sheltered behind the walls of<br />
protectionism have understood that long-term success lies<br />
with freer trade.<br />
If anyone doubts the significance and the breadth of this<br />
sweeping transformation of Australian attitudes, they need<br />
only consider the recent competition by Williamstown and<br />
Newcastle for the frigate contract.<br />
In both tenders, workers and managers and State Governments<br />
presented the Federal Government with a united determination<br />
to maximise the benefits, for the regions and beyond, of the<br />
technical spin-offs of this very significant project.<br />
So it is against that background of dramatic change in the<br />
Australian economy and in the economic practices of<br />
Australians that we brought down our seventh budget last<br />
night. Again, it is a Budget that addresses the central long-term<br />
issues facing the Australian economy, while ensuring relief<br />
for those members of the community who need most help.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I think it a good insight into Australia's current economic<br />
situation to put the 1988-89 year in context.<br />
When we came to office in 1983 we faced huge economic<br />
problems with, as I have mentioned, double digit<br />
unemployment and inflation, a recessed economy and<br />
persistently high current account deficits.<br />
To counter these problems we set about reinvigorating the<br />
economy, restraining real wages growth and generally<br />
internationalising the Australian economy, and then<br />
drastically reducing the public sector borrowing<br />
requirement. </p>
<p>Progress was steady and positive. In 1987-88 unemployment<br />
was down to 7.8 per cent, inflation was down to 7.3 per cent<br />
and the current account deficit was equal to 4 per cent,<br />
down by over 2 percentage points of GDP from two years<br />
earlier. In 1988-89 this steady progress stalled. While employment<br />
growth was excellent, with unemployment now down to 6.1 per<br />
cent, Australia's current account and inflation rate<br />
deviated from their path of steady improvement.<br />
But in understanding our economy we need to ask why?<br />
It was because, and you have heard this said before, demand<br />
grew more than the Government or any other commentator<br />
predicted. But in turn, we need to understand where that demand came<br />
from. It was predominantly investment driven. our business<br />
investment to GDP ratio was the highest for any year in<br />
which records have been kept. It was some 3 per cent of<br />
GDP, or around $ 10 billion more than its average level over<br />
the past 30 years.<br />
Nearly half our investment goods are imported, and then<br />
there are the indirect effects of investment spending on<br />
imports.<br />
Without this extra investment, both imports and demand, and<br />
therefore both the current account and inflation, should<br />
have been considerably lower than recorded.<br />
So as economic problems go, there are certainly worse<br />
problems to have than this. The paradox is that if we had<br />
not had the extra $ 10 billion investment, we would be<br />
hearing less from the doom and gloom merchants.<br />
Let me point you to table 7 on page 2.39 of Budget Paper No<br />
1. It's the kind of table that would be worth re-publishing for<br />
your readers perhaps as adornment to a Stutchbury column.<br />
The table divides the last thirty years of Australian<br />
history into six five-year periods. It shows first that<br />
public sector demand grew in the most recent five-year<br />
period at a lower rate than at any earlier time.<br />
Second, in that same most recent period, 1984-85 to 1988-89,<br />
private consumption increased at a lower rate relative to<br />
GNE or GDP growth than in all earlier periods. </p>
<p>Third, and here I quote from Budget Paper No 1, " following<br />
fifteen years of poor investment performance ( 2.2 per cent<br />
per annum growth), the average increase in business fixed<br />
investment in the last five years was a remarkable 10.8 per<br />
cent." This isn't just playing with numbers. We're talking about<br />
an investment boom, not a mirage.<br />
Take a look around Australia and you realise that throughout<br />
the nation new projects are underway, using largely imported<br />
capital to build Australia's import replacing and export<br />
base. Visit the North West Shelf massive new investment is<br />
expected to create exports worth more than a billion dollars<br />
a year over the next two decades.<br />
Inspect the new smelters in Risdon and Kemerton, and the<br />
chemical plants in Gladstone and Bunbury about $ 450<br />
million in investment, all due to come on stream by the end<br />
of the year.<br />
BHP alone has five new projects with a capital investment of<br />
more than $ 600 million which will serve the domestic and<br />
export markets.<br />
I have already mentioned the frigate project Australia's<br />
largest defence project ever. Take a look at the submarine<br />
project in South Australia and the new generation MDX<br />
helicopter to be manufactured by Hawker de Havilland in<br />
collaboration with McDonnell Douglas.<br />
Then there are new investments such as that by Bowater at<br />
Box Hill to make paper products and by Chargeurs in Wagga in<br />
TCF products. And we are all aware of the major<br />
construction projects across the nation that will cater for<br />
tourists from around the world.<br />
This all reinforces the point that with the public sector<br />
now in surplus, it is investment by the private sector that<br />
is fuelling the current account deficit.<br />
With the stock of Commonwealth debt rapidly decreasing,<br />
Australia's stock of foreign debt is increasingly the result<br />
of investment decisions by the private sector.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I say all this with no sense of complacency about the<br />
current level of overseas debt.<br />
To the contrary our policies are actively addressing the<br />
equation that lies at the heart of that debt problem.<br />
Put simply, we need a long period where the amount of goods<br />
we produce exceeds the amount of goods we wish to consume. </p>
<p>So we must both increase the goods we produce and lower our<br />
demand. That's what we're doing: continuing to boost supply through<br />
micro-economic reform and lowering demand by encouraging<br />
saving. Let me look at each side of this equation in a little more<br />
detail. Since 1983 we have taken major steps in the areas of<br />
financial deregulation, floating the currency, terminating<br />
the two airline agreement, deregulating oil marketing,<br />
reforming company tax, reducing tariffs, increasing<br />
competition in telecommunications and generally lessening<br />
controls of Government business enterprises.<br />
This activity starts to wind back thirty years of policy<br />
making directed at imposing restrictions on competition.<br />
What we're about with this micro-economic reform is<br />
increasing productivity producing more goods from a given<br />
level of resources.<br />
And we are still engaged in this task.<br />
More recently, award restructuring and decisions on grain<br />
handling and transport, coastal shipping and the waterfront<br />
have further extended the scope of micro-economic reforms.<br />
The advent of continuous voyage permits and the removal of<br />
excess manning have the potential significantly to lower<br />
costs in these two areas.<br />
Perhaps as important as the scope of these changes is the<br />
method by which they have been achieved.<br />
We undertake extensive inquiries to analyse the problems.<br />
We consult those affected both to get their input and to<br />
determine how best we can assist them in a process of<br />
change. And we take decisions that will produce real gains<br />
in a practical environment.<br />
Last night's Budget continued this historic process.<br />
In 1921 a body known as the Tariff Board was established.<br />
It was an eminently sensible title for an organisation whose<br />
task was to implement the prevailing fashion for border<br />
protection sheltering domestic producers from<br />
international competition.<br />
In 1974, in recognition of the newly independent role the<br />
Board was playing, that body was transformed into the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission which has built a proud<br />
reputation for analytically rigorous studies into industry<br />
issues, educating Australians about the real cost of<br />
industry protection. </p>
<p>It became, in a sense, an Anti-Tariff Board.<br />
This process culminated in May 1988 with our decisions to<br />
lower tariffs significantly over the whole economy a move<br />
which received very wide public acceptance.<br />
That decision is being implemented over four years but it<br />
is time now to open a new chapter in this organisation's<br />
history and to embark on a new phase in micro-reform.<br />
we have decided to expand the role of the IAC to cover the<br />
full range of structural adjustment and micro-economic<br />
reform policies, including transport matters. It will be<br />
renamed the Industry Commission and will be the institution<br />
undertaking all major inquiries on structural or industry<br />
policy issues with economy-wide implications.<br />
The main references will cover:<br />
Energy Generation and Distribution, and Railways, both<br />
in close co-operation with the States<br />
Construction Costs for Major Plants<br />
Export Franchising and Distribution Arrangements<br />
Raw Material Pricing for Domestic Uses<br />
Availability of Capital for manufacturing and Service<br />
Industries The Commercial Tariff Concession System<br />
Mining and Minerals Processing<br />
Statutory Marketing Arrangements, and<br />
Product Liability<br />
These references will help us continue our process of<br />
careful study, educating the community of the need for<br />
change, consultation and practical policy implementation.<br />
That is the necessary process of micro reform. It is about<br />
medium term, irreversable, structural change leading to a<br />
more productive economy: not half-baked ideas, not mere<br />
rhetoric and not policies incapable of implementation.<br />
I turn now to the demand side of the equation.<br />
Again we are on about addressing the real issues with an<br />
extremely active policy of demand management through<br />
continuing tight fiscal, wages and monetary policies. </p>
<p>You don't have to react to every piece of economic news by<br />
frantically and demonstrably pulling levers especially<br />
when the calls are coming from those who made such a mess of<br />
their last time in the engine room. Our demand management<br />
policies are clear cut and well established especially with<br />
unprecedented real wages containment and public sector<br />
surpluses.<br />
We have dramatically improved the savings balance by an<br />
eight percentage point reduction in the net PSBR since<br />
1983-84.<br />
Commonwealth outlays relative to GDP have declined by 6.3<br />
percentage points from the peak in 1984-85, whereas revenue<br />
to GDP has declined by 0.7 percentage points over the same<br />
period. This turnaround in our budget position has<br />
therefore occurred because of cutbacks in Commonwealth<br />
outlays. To suggest other than this, as some in the Opposition do, is<br />
a ridiculously easy fabrication to refute.<br />
When the Opposition was last in office, their commitment to<br />
saving was represented by a Budget deficit of 5 per cent of<br />
GDP and a top marginal tax rate of 60 per cent.<br />
It is worth noting as well that the more than 10 per cent<br />
unemployed under the Liberals also had some difficulty in<br />
saving.<br />
As well as our public sector savings efforts, the private<br />
sector has already been encouraged to save by<br />
our encouragement to all workers to take 3 per cent<br />
of their wages as superannuation;<br />
our reduction in marginal tax rates;<br />
our introduction of full imputation for company tax<br />
to encourage greater savings through the share<br />
market; our removal of division 7 tax on the retained<br />
earnings of private companies, encouraging greater<br />
savings by companies;<br />
our reduction in the company tax rate to 39 per<br />
cent; and our deregulation of the financial system, which<br />
offered households more avenues for savings.<br />
With the changes to superannuation announced last night we<br />
have made further inroads into what is a structural weakness<br />
in the Australian economy our propensity to consume rather<br />
than to save. </p>
<p>At the same time we are addressing the profound question of<br />
how the Australian economy will cope in decades to come with<br />
the ageing of the baby boom generation.<br />
If we make no provision now for the future, we may be asking<br />
future generations to bear a massive, possibly an<br />
intolerable, social security burden in the form of age<br />
pensions payments.<br />
The changes we announced last night the improved vesting<br />
and preservation of super, the encouragement of annuities,<br />
the improved tax deductibility to encourage increased<br />
contributions into individual superannuation schemes, the<br />
greater incentive for women to take up superannuation, and,<br />
most importantly, from 1995 the removal from the tax system<br />
of all full and part rate pensioners will shift the<br />
balance markedly further in favour of superannuation.<br />
That means, they will dramatically increase the stock of<br />
savings in the community.<br />
These are savings of a high quality not savings over a<br />
couple of years aimed at acquiring a new consumer good but<br />
long-term saving to provide for retirement years.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Any political party claiming the right to govern Australia<br />
has to be able to provide answers not only to broad<br />
structural and economic issues.<br />
It also has to understand that Government is about people.<br />
Labor in Government has embraced both these goals.<br />
The era of profligate welfare hand-outs has long gone.<br />
This Budget, consistent with all our previous efforts to<br />
improve the social security system, is about targeting real<br />
assistance to members of our community who need it.<br />
Since 1982-83, spending on social justice as a proportion of<br />
total Government outlays I am excluding public debt<br />
interest has increased from about 50 per cent to a<br />
projected 58 per cent this year. That represents an<br />
increase of nearly $ 9 billion in current prices.<br />
Medicare, child care, public housing, care for the elderly,<br />
the unemployed and the sick are all important recipients of<br />
this spending.<br />
In this Budget we provide new assistance to the aged,<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, to homeless youth,<br />
to fee relief for child care not giveaway measures but<br />
steady, affordable help focused on the areas of need in the<br />
community. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Let this clearly be understood:<br />
We are not about to sacrifice the long-term economic<br />
strategy the strategy that offers the only prospect for<br />
sustainable long-term prosperity for this nation on the<br />
altar of short-term political expediency.<br />
The 1982 Budget was the Liberals' seventh.<br />
It was also their last.<br />
Last night, we brought down our seventh Budget.<br />
It won't be our last.<br />
Because with our Budget indeed with all our Budgets and<br />
Economic Statements we're about securing the long-term<br />
future of the Australian economy.<br />
With the Liberals' seventh Budget, they were on about<br />
securing the short-term future of themselves.<br />
We're succeeding at our task.<br />
They failed at theirs failed to secure electoral success<br />
and failed to confront or even look for the long-term<br />
structural challenges facing Australia.<br />
This is a budget that looks to the future that gets on, as<br />
I have outlined tonight, with solving the long-term issues<br />
of Australian prosperity such as structural demand<br />
management and productivity growth.<br />
It sets out some of the elements of Labor's continuing<br />
strategy for economic and social reform into the 1990s<br />
into the Fourth Term of Labor Government and, if you like,<br />
beyond. To that extent, it is a budget that affirms our energy and<br />
determination to tell the Australian people the truth about<br />
the hard work, and about the endless promise, of the future. </p>
