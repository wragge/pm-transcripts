PRIME MINiSTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 5 DECEMBER 1982<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the following messagce to<br />
the new Liberal Member for Flinders, Mr Peter Reit-. h.<br />
" Warmest congratulations on an outstanding<br />
campaign and a great result, especially so<br />
since 1982 has been a difficult year.<br />
Flinders was seen as a litmus test on the national<br />
political scene.<br />
In all the circumstances of a by-election the<br />
result must be regarded as an endorsement of<br />
the Government.<br />
I am sorry I was not able to campaign for you<br />
personally and extend my thanks and congratulations<br />
to your campaign team and all those who devoteed so<br />
much time and energy to keeping Flinders for the<br />
Government. You retained Flinders on the issues of Government<br />
policies and put national responsibility before<br />
political expediency.<br />
The electorate chose well and I look forward to<br />
having you in the Government team in Canberra.<br />
Warm Regards. ( Malcolm Fri-aser)"<br />
