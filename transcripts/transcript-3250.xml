SAUSTI'. ALIA, 9 May 1974<br />
SOIL PRICES<br />
Mr. Anthony has finally come clean on the Liberal<br />
oil price increase. He admitted in Perth yesterday that<br />
Australian crude oil prices should be raised by at least<br />
per cent this would mean a rise with mark ups of at least<br />
3 cents in every gallon bought by the motorist. Quienslanders<br />
use over 350 million gallons every year the proposal Mr.<br />
Anthony has revealed would cost Australians over 1G60 million.<br />
This is no way to beat inflation; it would make it worse.<br />
There would be a direct effect on all motorists and and<br />
indirect effect on all commodities because of increased<br />
production and transport costs.<br />
As the Prices Justification Tribunal report shows<br />
the impact of the world energy crisis caused a rise of only<br />
1 cent per gallon about a quarter less than the Shell<br />
Company asked for and which they would have got under a Liberal<br />
Government. Opposition spokesmen are still talking about<br />
increasing Australian prices to world prices. This would<br />
increase petrol prices to the motorist not by 3 cents per<br />
gallon, which is all that Mr. Anthony can admit so close to an<br />
election, but by over 20 cents per gallon. The Prices Tribunal<br />
Report i-ndicates they would already have gone up 13 cents.<br />
The Opposition is clearly committed to revise the<br />
Australian Government's policy which prevents an increase<br />
in Australian oil prices. The Government has been successful<br />
in this policy. Petrol will go up by only 1 cent per gallon as<br />
a result of the world energy crisis. Since November, it has<br />
gone up, in England, by 35 cents a gallon, in France by 32 cents,<br />
in Italy by 39 cents, in Holland by 27 cents and in the U. S. A.<br />
by 9 cents. </p>

Australians should be warned by the hints of<br />
Liberal policy which could increase oil prices by over<br />
cnts. Mr. Anthony will admit to only 3 cents but neither<br />
he nor Mr. Snedden will deny that it might be more. Even the<br />
3 cents is three times what the Prices Tribunal allowed.<br />
Even the 3 cents per gallon increase would provide<br />
a gift of $ 160 million to the profits of Esso and B. H. P.<br />
The 3 cents which Mr. Anthony himself has now revealed,<br />
would be the greatest stim-ulus to inflation which any<br />
government decision could make. It will increase the price<br />
of petrol directly and it will increase the price of all<br />
manufactured goods. All goods need oil to be produced and<br />
O transported. A rise in the nrice of this basic commodity would<br />
spark off a new inflationary spiral of wage demands and price<br />
O cionmcirnega sedso. w n. We Alhla vet het udrenceids itohnes cwoer nhearv e miandfel atiodne ciiss ionnosw which<br />
are now working would be thrown away by this scandalous<br />
proposal. An increase in the price of oil of this size would<br />
cause the worst inflation in our history.<br />
This proposal is typical of the special pleading<br />
of the Liberal and Country Parties for narrow vested interests.<br />
In order to boost the profits of Esso and B. H. P. they would hit<br />
every consumer, every farmer, every manufacturer with huge cost<br />
Sincreases.<br />
O Combine it with their other inflationary proposals,<br />
an indiscriminate tax cut, irresponsible expenditure promises<br />
to every narrow interest group affected by our decisions, the<br />
flood of foreign money which will come in if they lift our<br />
restrictions. They would probably increase indirect charges.<br />
Taxes on petrol, cigarettes, cars, all consume:: goods would<br />
go up. We should remember that the Liberals promised to cut<br />
income tax by S200 million at the 1969 election and they<br />
did. But they increased ihdirect taxes in the 1970 Budget<br />
by .40 million. This is the way with Liberal promises. They<br />
would do it again.<br />
Now we have their admission that they would increase<br />
the price of petrol. If we combine all these things I predict<br />
that inflation would rise to at least 20 per cent this year.<br />
Our policies have brought the rate down it fell by a third in<br />
the first three months of this year. We can beat inflation and<br />
ve will. The Liberal and Country Party promises to the powerful<br />
vested interests that support them and finance them would send<br />
inflation through the roof. </p>
