E. 0. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE, 6 MAY 1983<br />
P. M.-May I say and I hope it will be appreciated that given the<br />
circumstanc: es to which I have alluded it would, in some senses,<br />
have been perhaps more appropriate to simply expect that the<br />
Government in those circumstances would be trusted to have<br />
acted for sound and appropriate reasons and I believe its<br />
going to be difficult, if not impossible, to have a normal<br />
question opportunity but I'm prepared to try and see if<br />
there are some matters which don't breach the obligations<br />
that I have to discharge in this matter, so I'm available.<br />
Q Mr Hawke your house was broken into just before the elections.<br />
Do you see any connection between that and a report that Sir<br />
William McMahon's home was broken into just before he<br />
became Prime Minister?<br />
P. M. No.<br />
Q Mr Hawke, does Mr Toohey on his own now represent some kind of<br />
threat to Australian security?<br />
P. M.-I'm not prepared to comment on that.<br />
Q Prime Minister will you be expecting any sort of protest<br />
say from countries like Papua New Guinea or explanations about<br />
. allegations in the article<br />
P. M.-I think it very likely that there would be approaches for<br />
explanation.<br />
Q Are you prepared to concede Prime Minister that some of the<br />
material published is in the public interest?<br />
P. M.-No.<br />
Q What is your attitude in relation to information about<br />
prominent Australians being given to governments overseas,<br />
particularly the United States?<br />
P. M.-I am disturbed.<br />
Q Prime Minister, will you be seeking to explain to countries<br />
such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea the circumstances about<br />
these reports?<br />
P. M.-I can't imagine that the first two places that I'll be going<br />
to which are Papua New Guinea and Indonesia that the matter<br />
will not ch raised.<br />
Q What will you be saying to them sir?<br />
P. M.-I would imagine that you understand thaot i t; more appropriaf. e<br />
that I should convey that directly to thcm, rat! thier than throuch you. </p>
<p>Q Will you instigate a review of ASIO as a result of<br />
these allegations?<br />
P. M. -The decisions and actions of the government which are<br />
required in the light of what has been published to<br />
this stage will be a matter for determination by the<br />
Government.<br />
Q Mr Hawke, do you believe the Australian public is<br />
entitled to know that the internal security service<br />
raided the home of a former Prime Minister, handed<br />
over information to the CIA about Australian politicians<br />
and Australian officers and gave to a right-wing body,<br />
the NCC, copious ASTO material. Is that in the public<br />
interest for people to know that?<br />
P. M. -They are serious allegations and there couldn't in<br />
terms of Australia's internal security and proper<br />
conduct of its affairs be much more serious allegations.<br />
The question of what is done to ascertain the accuracy<br />
or otherwise of the allegations and what may follow from<br />
that is obviously one of the matters for consideration<br />
by the Government and is being so considered.<br />
Q Mr Hawke, what if any is your advice on how this mass<br />
of material should have gotten. into the hands ( inaudible)<br />
P. M. -No we don't know. Clearly, as I am indicating, we are<br />
taking steps to try and find out.<br />
Q do you believe this was brought about to embarrass<br />
your Goverment, to bring about memories of the previous<br />
Labor Governments and ASIO?<br />
P. M. I'm not in a position to know why Mr Toohey has done<br />
what he's done.<br />
Q Why did your injunctionnot seek to prevent the publication<br />
and distribution of this edition of The National Times?&gt;<br />
P. M. It was already too late to do that.<br />
Q How do you differentiate between ( the activities of<br />
Mr Ivanov and those of our own agencies)<br />
P. M. Mr Ivanov is, to the best of my knowledge, is a citizen<br />
of the Soviet Union.<br />
