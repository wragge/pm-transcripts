P. M. No. 33/ 1962<br />
COMMOCNAL TH SCHOLARSHIP S CEME<br />
Statement by the Prime iMinister, the Rt. n. ReG. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister said today that the Commonwealth<br />
Government had completed another of its periodic reviews of the<br />
Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme and had decided to liberalise the<br />
provisions governing the means test and the rates of living<br />
allowance. Many benefits under the scheme are available to<br />
Commonwealth Scholarship holders free of means test but living<br />
allowances paid under the scheme do take into account the income<br />
earned by students or their families.<br />
The alterations to be made are these<br />
Means Test:<br />
The marginal adjusted family income, i. e. the adjusted<br />
family income on which maximum living allowances are<br />
payable is to be raised from Å 750 to Å 850 per annum and<br />
the rate of abatement of the allowances is to be Å 2 in<br />
up to an income of Å 1,700 ( instead of Å 1,400 at<br />
present) and Å 3 in Å 10 thereafter. ( Adjusted family<br />
income is ascertained by taking the full income of the<br />
scholar's parents for the financial year immediately<br />
preceding the year in which living allowance is desired<br />
and deducting an amount, as below, for each dependent<br />
child other than the scholar under 16 years of age)<br />
This alteration therefore increases the amount of<br />
allowance payable to all income groups at present<br />
eligible and makes eligible certain income groups at<br />
present above the ceiling,<br />
In assessing the adjusted family income ( above), the<br />
allowance for each dependent child other than the<br />
scholar under 16 years shall be fÅ 10, At present, only<br />
the first such child is allowed for at Å 150 and<br />
subsequent children at Å 75 each.<br />
Living Allowances:<br />
The maximum living allowances for scholarship holders<br />
are to be raised by per week for students living at<br />
home ( making the allowance 0 per week) and 7/ 6d.<br />
per week for students living away from home ( making the<br />
allowance 7. 6 per week.)<br />
The permissiole income, i. e. the amount that a scholar<br />
may earn during term time without affecting his living<br />
allowance is to be raised from Å 2 to 10. O per week<br />
in the case of ordinary scholars and from 0 to<br />
Å 3 per week in the case of independent scholars.<br />
In assessing the living allowance in the case where<br />
there are two students of the one family in courses<br />
approved under the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme and<br />
one or both hold Commonwealth scholarships the living<br />
allowance of one or both will be assessed by abating<br />
the maximum allowances at half the normal rate; where<br />
there are three such students the abatoment rate should<br />
be 1/ 3rd the normal rate, and so on.<br />
The Prime Minister said that all these changes would<br />
operate from 1st April, 1962.<br />
