PRIME MINISTER 94/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
TIMETABLE ON MABO LEGISLATION<br />
Today I am meeting with representatives of the mining<br />
industry and with the Council for Aboriginal<br />
Reconciliation, and tomorrow I will meet with<br />
representatives of the group which earlier this month<br />
gathered at Eva Valley.<br />
The purpose of these meetings is to continue discussions<br />
of the Mabo issue anld to provide details of the Federal<br />
Government's consultative and legislative timetable.<br />
The plan we announced last year is on schedule. To<br />
provide the certainty the country needs, passage of<br />
legislation is required in these Budget sittings.<br />
The steps in the lead-up to the introduction of final<br />
legislation are:<br />
The Ministerial Committee on Mabo is at present<br />
working intensively on a document which outlines the<br />
proposed legislation and this will be released<br />
publicly within the next two weeks.<br />
With the document's release, the Government will<br />
invite comment and further talks will be held with<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
representatives, State and Territory governments and<br />
industry.<br />
By mid-September work on drafting the Bill will be<br />
in top gear.<br />
The Government will make every endeavour to have the<br />
Bill in the House by 1 October.<br />
In introducing the legislation by this date the<br />
Government will be meeting its original deadline. On an<br />
issue of this magniLude some groups may wish for more<br />
time for consultation, but the artificial deadlines now<br />
applying in the Parliament close off this option.<br />
It is worth noting that the outline of legislation has<br />
been the subject of thorough discussions between </p>
<p>-4 r-LA.) V. d IMU. IL r u<br />
2<br />
officials from the Commonwealth and the States and<br />
Territories, and in the next couple of weeks I expect to<br />
have the opportunity to speak to Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers. I will be in a position to say more about the<br />
Government's thinking on the broader aspects of Mabo when<br />
the legislation is introduced.<br />
we are continuing to work on ideas which will meet the<br />
twin goals which Mabo set us from the start delivering<br />
economic security to investors and holders of existing<br />
land title, and to Aboriginals and Torres Strait<br />
Islanders an unprecdented measure of historic justice.<br />
Mabo has been the subject of extensive discussion in<br />
Australia for more than a year. It has been the cause of<br />
both genuine concern and anxiety and some misinformed and<br />
inflammatory comment.<br />
But the majority of Australians and majority of<br />
interested groups have sought an outcome which is<br />
practicable and just and one which will take us much<br />
further than any previous step has taken us towards<br />
solving a 200 year old problem.<br />
That is what the Government will do everything in its<br />
power to deliver.<br />
CANBERRA, 24 AUGUST 1993 </p>
