PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
Mr Neil Mclnnes has today been appointed Australia's<br />
first Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.<br />
Legislation establishing the office was recently passed<br />
by the Parliament and is expected to come into operation<br />
in the near future. Creation of the Office flowed from<br />
a recommendation to that effect by Mr Justice Hope in<br />
his Royal Commission reports on the intelligence and<br />
security agencies.<br />
The Inspector-General will occupy a pivotal position<br />
with respect to the accountability of Australia's<br />
security and intelligence agencies. The role of the<br />
office will be to assist Ministers in ensuring that the<br />
agencies act with legality and propriety, and that they<br />
respect human rights. Powers of the office will be<br />
widest in regard to ASIO, where there is, for example,<br />
provision for review of certain directions given to that<br />
organisation by the Attorney-General.<br />
The Inspector-General will be able to conduct inquiries<br />
as a result of complaints from members of the public, at<br />
the request of a Minister or of his own motion.<br />
In accordance with the provisions of the legislation,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition was consulted on the<br />
appointment of Mr Mclnnes.<br />
Mr Mclnnes is a former journalist and newspaper editor,<br />
who joined the public service in 1978 and has been,<br />
since 1983, a Deputy Secretary of the Department of the<br />
Prime Minister and Cabinet. He was born in Sydney and<br />
was educated at Sydney Boys' High School and Sydney<br />
University before working as a journalist in Australia,<br />
India, France and the US. </p>
