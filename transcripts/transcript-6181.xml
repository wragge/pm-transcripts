PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 August 1983<br />
I welcome the decision of the pilots' federation to lift<br />
their bans on flights to Canberra.<br />
The federation's decision was taken in full knowledge that<br />
the Government was not prepared to negotiate further on the<br />
basic decisions made on the future taxation of lump sum<br />
superannuation payments.<br />
I now look forward to constructive talks between the Federal<br />
Government, the ACTU and the pilots' federation on technical<br />
aspects of a total retirement package, including the<br />
development of annuity schemes, approved deposit funds<br />
and indexed bonds. </p>
