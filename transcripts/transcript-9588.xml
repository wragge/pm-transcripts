TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JEREMY CORDEAUX, RADIO 5DN, 16 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JC: Good morning sir.<br />
PM: Good morning, I am very pleased to be here.<br />
JC: Are you well?<br />
PM: I am as well as I can be I think, Jeremy.<br />
JC: It would seem to me that you are in election mode. You have just<br />
suggested to us that we are going to get our Mt Barker road completed<br />
and the airport extended. Can you give us a time at which this will be<br />
commenced?<br />
PM: We will be starting on the Mt Barker road under the Commonwealth's<br />
national road program, the National Highway Program, and that will<br />
virtually begin this year. We will start, now, the feasibility studies for<br />
the airport. That is, extending the airport and doing the feasibility<br />
studies, the environmental assessments, and getting the constructions<br />
begun and completed.<br />
JC: Now they are nice little goodies for us. It tells us that you have come<br />
to town with some sweeteners which a politician doesn't do unless he<br />
wants something.<br />
PM: Can I say that the Mt Barker road goes through a heap of Liberal<br />
electorates, so there is no value for us, the Labor Party, in that other<br />
than the people of the State and, as you know, this is a thing that<br />
needed doing and it is an eight kilometre divided freeway, including a<br />
six lane tunnel, so I think that will be good. The other thing I should<br />
mention to you is that in two weeks time when I am having the<br />
pleasure of launching the One Nation train remember in the One<br />
Nation policy statement we said we would build a standard gauge<br />
railway from Adelaide to Melbourne so that will be launched in two </p>
<p>2<br />
weeks. So you can now carry freight or passengers from Brisbane to<br />
Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide for the first time in our history. So<br />
there is that, plus the airport. So all these things are about the further<br />
integration of South Australia.<br />
JC: Well, we thank you. These are nice goodies. Now you say that this is<br />
as good as it gets. Now as a politician, if this is as good at its gets this<br />
will be a good time for an election surely.<br />
PM: Well the business environment has been very good. We have in the<br />
last year just on 5 per cent growth and 2 per cent inflation.<br />
JC: You see, it hasn't been that good for us here.<br />
PM: True and there is a question in that, isn't there. I mean why is<br />
Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia<br />
growing?<br />
JC: Well we have a lot of debt and we have had a bit of trouble, as you<br />
well know?<br />
PM: You have had trouble that is true, but I don't think the debt is a<br />
problem. I think that South Australia has got to identify its strengths<br />
and go and seek them. Being at the foot of Asia, as we are, we are<br />
now closer to the fastest growing markets in the world, which was<br />
never the case they were always in Europe or North America. We<br />
are really now for the first time in our history and I think that South<br />
Australia, I mean, this sort of developed economy, you realise that the<br />
South Australian economy is about the size of the economy of<br />
Malaysia, roughly, so if Malaysia is a tiger, then so can South Australia<br />
and I have just got to get that message through Dean Brown maybe<br />
he has got to start roaring a bit and doing something.<br />
JC: Accordingly to this poll this morning, this Newspoll, more people<br />
believe the Federal Budget will leave them worse off, rather than better<br />
off. Does that surprise you? I mean, that perception?<br />
PM: Well polls are a funny thing. The main thing that I think people would<br />
understand is that the main aim of the Budget were two things take<br />
the pressure off interest rates and fill the savings pot-hole out there in<br />
the 90s and that is basically what we have done through taking the<br />
Budget back into surplus and this big change to superannuation.<br />
JC: What about all these economists who see it, and I think there were<br />
only three dissenting voices out of 130, that they believe that interest<br />
rates haven't peaked. What is your opinion of that? Do you think they<br />
have peaked? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: Well let me demonstrate this point to you, Jeremy. Last year we sold,<br />
our bond selling program, the Commonwealth Bond program was<br />
$ 21 billion $ 21,000,000,000 as a result of the Budget changing, this<br />
year it will be $ 6,000,000,000. In other words, there is a reduction in<br />
the Commonwealth Bond selling program of $ 15,000,000,000. That is<br />
just an unbelievable figure and that is why the long bond yields the<br />
ten year bond interest rates fell by 1 per cent. You see ten year bonds<br />
two weeks ago were about 10.1 per cent and they are now at<br />
9.1 per cent because of that big fall in the Budget bond selling<br />
program and that is what has taken the pressure off interest rates and<br />
that is why I think the housing rates fell at the end of last week.<br />
JC: So the drop in the interest rates, you are definitely claiming as a result<br />
of the Budget?<br />
PM: Well I am certainly claiming the long term bond rate and I think the<br />
housing rates, the whole environment. Well let me put it this way, if<br />
they'd have risen on Friday the commentators which have said " Budget<br />
rejected, absolutely rejected".<br />
JC: Do you get the feeling you can't win?<br />
PM: Well, sometimes.<br />
JC: Well do you think, let me ask you again, the interest rates have<br />
peaked, that they are not going to go back up again after this?<br />
PM: I endorse what the Treasurer said the other day, I think barring a shift<br />
in world markets, we have seen much of the strength in the propensity<br />
of rates to rise taken from it now and that the Budget change and that<br />
continuing low inflation and another Accord with the trade unions on<br />
wages augurs very well for inflation and interest rates.<br />
JC: I imagine you saw Terry McCrann's comments on the Budget, did you?<br />
PM: Well Terry is a pre-Copernican obscurantist.<br />
JC: Well let me see, he said you are like an old fashioned life insurance<br />
salesman " Mr Keating is selling the Budget using figures which are<br />
utterly misleading and arguably fraudulent this is over the<br />
superannuation.<br />
PM: I know. Look Terry is that far to the right he is out of sight and let me<br />
just say in the Treasury paper Saving for the Future, what we did in the<br />
Budget was put through the most comprehensive and revolutionary<br />
change ever to Australian savings and retirement incomes. What it<br />
will mean, Jeremy, is that every Australian person will have at least<br />
per cent of wages and salaries going into superannuation. At the<br />
moment, most of them have five. Now what that will mean, and these </p>
<p>4<br />
are the Treasury's numbers, is that somebody I have got the little<br />
book here Saving for the Future, which the Treasury has published<br />
on 100 per cent of average weekly earnings, that is $ 33,000 a year,<br />
will end up with a nest egg of $ 461,000 and an annual income of<br />
$ 30,000. So you take somebody who, and these are all in today's<br />
dollars, is on $ 33,000 a year will at the end of their working life, in<br />
today's dollars, will end up with an income of $ 30,000 a year, which is<br />
about twice what the pension is.<br />
JC: So he is totally wrong when he says the difference between the<br />
promised tax cuts and the Government's contribution is $ 17 billion,<br />
maybe more, and that is what we are missing out on?<br />
PM: No, no, because what we did, we put the tax cuts into these<br />
superannuation accounts and that grows over the years. So there is a<br />
great benefit there. Can I demonstrate it this way as well. Apart from<br />
the income of people, put it this way, when I became Treasurer in 1983<br />
superannuation coverage was only 40 per cent, this year it is 90 per<br />
cent. In 1983, we have $ 40 billion in super funds, this year it is<br />
$ 186 billion and what the Treasury is estimating, as a result of this<br />
change, by 2020 we will have $ 2000 billion in today's dollars that is<br />
2 trillion in super funds, $ 2,000,000,000,000 ten times what we have<br />
now in super funds.<br />
JC: Well let's hope it is well managed.<br />
PM: Well it has to be well managed. But see the thing is if the Liberals<br />
thought of this, Terry McCrann would be out there like the daily blab<br />
blah, yak, blah, yak, blah, yak you know, here ye, here ye is the great<br />
change, but if it comes from a Labor Government, it wouldn't matter<br />
what we did with Terry McCrann I can tell you.<br />
JC: Well this is I guess the crunch question. Now the tax cuts in L. A. W.,<br />
you changed your mind about that. What happens if you change your<br />
mind about this?<br />
PM: Well, no, understand what we did. I mean I want to just make this<br />
point, what was the Government's principal commitment at the<br />
election. The Government's principal commitment was get<br />
unemployment down. On election night I got up and said we won't<br />
leave the unemployed behind, we will put our arm out and pull them up<br />
behind us, we will move along as a society together. Now the<br />
Government's target in the election was 500,000 jobs in 3 years. In<br />
2 1/ 4 years we have got to 650,000. So we are 150,000 over the<br />
target in 2 1/ 4 years. So on that hardest commitment of all, the<br />
hardest thing for a Government to deliver employment we have<br />
exceeded our target, or put it this way we reached our target in 2 years<br />
and it was a 3 year target and we are now 150,000 over. That was a<br />
principal commitment. One year earlier than the election in One </p>
<p>Nation, that was in March 1992, we said we have introduced two tax<br />
cuts to get the economy cracking. What we did, following the election,<br />
was bring one forward and pay it in full at the end of 1993. So the first<br />
round of tax cuts were brought forward and paid in full at the end of<br />
1883. The second round we said we would introduce probably in 1998<br />
was the word and the Treasurer and I used. Well they will be<br />
introduced in 1998 except they will be paid into superannuation<br />
accounts and not as cash. The reason we are taking this opportunity<br />
to do that is to say to people well what would you rather have, you<br />
know, $ 10 or $ 15 in your hands or a retirement income, taking the<br />
chance now of saying if the Government does this now I won't ever<br />
have to worry again about my retirement income.<br />
JC: But that average worker could be able to retire on $ 462,000, it applies<br />
to somebody who actually starts work in the next century?<br />
PM: No, no. To go to the full, to the end of their working lives, at the end of<br />
their working lives, that is right it is at the end of their working lives.<br />
But let's say, take somebody now who is in their 30s and is going to be<br />
retiring, we have also calculated what it will be for them and it will be<br />
that somebody who is in their 30s now, a couple in their 30s who retire,<br />
they will end up with an amount 3/ 4 of the pension on top of the current<br />
pension. In other words, they will retire on an amount of 3/ 4 extra to<br />
the current pension and their children will retire on an amount 100 per<br />
cent extra to the current pension. In other words, doubling the current<br />
pension for their children 3/ 4 of the current pension on top of the<br />
pension for them. So in other words there is a benefit in here for all<br />
working people, from now on, it is just that the benefit gets to its full<br />
bloom if you are in the system longer. So let's say you are 23 years of<br />
age today, you will then pick up the full $ 30,000 in income at the end.<br />
Or if you end up on twice weekly earnings, you end up with a lump<br />
sum of $ 750,000 at the end. But, again, you have got to be in the<br />
scheme 40 years. But the benefits are there for somebody who has<br />
got 20 years to go.<br />
JC: The Prime Minister is my special guest. I just want to ask one more<br />
question and then we will take some callers. I don't know how much<br />
time you can spend with us.<br />
PM: I am right, we are okay.<br />
JC: But we would be grateful. This story that is around this morning about<br />
Senator Alston and Dick Warburton and Dick Warburton's article in<br />
The Financial Review where it is said that you rang a senior executive<br />
at The Sydney Morning Herald and complained about that article and<br />
referred to how such an article, gutter press, might jeopardise<br />
Conrad Black's desire to have a bigger share of The Sydney Morning<br />
Herald. </p>
<p>PM: The story goes on, apparently, that I then sort of said " oh well, Conrad<br />
Black would otherwise have 50 per cent of the Herald".<br />
JC: Yes. Did you do that?<br />
PM: No. But do I call the media executives, well that is a habit I have got<br />
into over the years.<br />
JC: Did you object to that article on that particular occasion in that manner,<br />
or not?<br />
PM: Not that I can recall. But the article of course was without foundation,<br />
but the weight of what Senator Alston is saying is that in some ways<br />
the Government has offered Conrad Black 50 per cent of John Fairfax<br />
and Sons that is totally untrue.<br />
JC: The interest being if he laid off you.<br />
PM: But it is totally untrue. It is a complete fantasy.<br />
JC: So never at any time did you offer that sort of* a suggestion to a senior<br />
Fairfax executive?<br />
PM: No. Absolutely not.<br />
JC: That article that Dick Warburton, who was a fairly heavy weight in the<br />
business world, he accused you of being able to hate and get fairly<br />
close to the politics of hate. What did you make of that?<br />
PM: Well I thought that was just extraordinary. This is a man we put on the<br />
Reserve Bank Board.<br />
JC: Where would he get this feeling from?<br />
PM: And if you look at the last election, a lot of the people who were<br />
supporting the Coalition, we have appointed them to boards. I mean<br />
we have appointed a number of people. Warwick Smith, the Liberal<br />
frontbencher, we appointed as the Telecom Ombudsman. The former<br />
Mayor of Brisbane, Sally-Anne Atkinson, we appointed as the Trade<br />
Commissioner to France.<br />
JC: When somebody gets stuck into you though, publicly or privately, do<br />
you take that personally?<br />
PM: No, because it happens all the time. In public life you have just got to<br />
let it roll off your back, I am afraid. But can I just say what the Alston<br />
thing is about is that there is a terrible argument going on in the Liberal<br />
Party, right at the moment, over Mr Connolly's sacking at the hands of<br />
Dr Nelson. And Connolly has hopped right in to this and said here we </p>
<p>are, when superannuation is a major issue in the Budget and the<br />
country, you've fired your superannuation spokesman and at the same<br />
time he said Senator Watson, in Tasmania, is now under threat from<br />
the former Premier, Mr Gray. So what is happening, Jeremy, is this,<br />
there is a huge stoush going on in the Liberal Party remembering that<br />
Mr Filing and Mr Rocher have been defeated in Western Australia, Mr<br />
Connolly has been defeated in New South Wales, Senator Watson's<br />
head is on the block in Tasmania with Mr Gray and Connolly is saying,<br />
here I am a loyal servant of the Party, been it all my life, I am the<br />
superannuation spokesman I get knocked off by Brendan Nelson,<br />
who tried his luck in South Australia, didn't succeed there, has come<br />
up to Bradfield. As I said yesterday, the Liberal Party is like one of the<br />
sort of clubs you join at the door you know. As you walk through the<br />
door you sign up. Oh you want to be in Parliament. Oh yes I would<br />
like the safest Liberal Party seat in Australia. Well just step this way.<br />
JC: So what Senator Alston is doing is a bit of a smoke screen?<br />
PM: I think so. I think they said what can we do today to sort of get the<br />
attention off Connolly and Senator Watson and this stoush we are<br />
having over Brendan Nelson, and particularly that he is backed by<br />
Bruce Shepherd, who was part of the Joh for Canberra campaign. You<br />
see John Howard has got things in his head, he is still hearing voices<br />
about the Joh for Canberra campaign and hates the sight of Shepherd.<br />
Shepherd masterminded the Nelson victory up in Bradfield, so there is<br />
a very, very big tussle going on and the bit of meat they have thrown<br />
across the trail this morning is Senator Alston and this cocked up story<br />
about me offering 50 per cent to dear old Conrad Black.<br />
JC: Have you ever ordered a tax audit of anybody?<br />
PM: No, of course not. Of course not. I was Treasurer for eight years and<br />
you have never heard one word about the propriety of my stewardship<br />
of that job. You can just imagine the private stuff I see. Here is John<br />
Howard taking the legal documents from the Hindmarsh Bridge case in<br />
South Australia, letting McLachlan open them, sending them to the<br />
opposing side's solicitors and then dropping them in the newspapers.<br />
I mean in terms of propriety, Howard and McLachlan have got the<br />
morals of alley cats.<br />
JC: Prime Minister if you can spend some time with us, we have got some<br />
calls, but I would get you to put those headphones on and I shall turn<br />
you loose on the listeners and the listeners loose on you. Hello, Del.<br />
Are you there Del?<br />
C: I am here.<br />
JC: Here is the Prime Minister. </p>
<p>PM: How are you Del?<br />
C: Good morning Prime Minister. I am a sole, lone parent carer of a<br />
young woman who is 30 years of age, with severe multiple disabilities.<br />
I read last Wednesday that carers can now qualify for the Carer's<br />
Pension, even if their family income is less than $ 61,000 and that they<br />
can amass assets of less than $ 559,000, which is in effect if they get<br />
$ 165 a week for a Carer's Pension and an income support increase of<br />
$ 165 a week. Lone parent carers received nothing out of this Budget.<br />
We are expected to provide 24 hours care for our severely disabled<br />
children for $ 165 a week. We can't earn $ 61,000. We don't have<br />
partners and on that amount of money, we can't amass assets of any<br />
sort.<br />
PM: Well that is not true, can I say. In the Budget we have increased the<br />
allowance quite substantially not with the actual based pension, but<br />
the allowance. You might have missed that in the news coverage and<br />
I think that is an important change. But we have increased, of course,<br />
that Carer's Pension over the years and it has the same free areas,<br />
that is you can earn without losing part of it to a certain level, and we<br />
have now got an increase in the allowance th at goes with it. Can I say<br />
these are the very things that John Howard and Peter Costello want to<br />
cut. I mean, you know Mr Howard has said that he doesn't believe that<br />
the Budget should be addressed by any changes in revenue, he will do<br />
it all on the out base side. Well this is one of the areas that they are<br />
most snaky about. That is, single parents and people on single<br />
incomes in the social security system. In contrast, we have increased<br />
the Rent Allowance in the Budget and we have also increased the<br />
Carer's Allowance.<br />
JC: Okay, Del, let's move on. Malcolm, hi.<br />
C: Oh, good morning Prime Minister, how are you?<br />
PM: Good Malcolm, thank you.<br />
C: Look direct democracy has been endorsed by all the major parties at<br />
some time and I would like to know why Labor didn't introduce it during<br />
the 80 years as part of their policies. At the moment, the unions have<br />
extra input to the political process by the virtue of their numbers and I<br />
feel that the rights of the wider community should be extended by this<br />
means.<br />
PM: What do you mean?<br />
C: Well, Citizens Initiated Referenda is a way of combating corruption in<br />
Governments in the present or future and it is being used that way in<br />
other countries and also where people generally feel that the </p>
<p>Government have their priorities wrong they can indicate that by<br />
referendum.<br />
PM: Well I think I speak here for the Coalition as well as for the Labor Party<br />
and neither of us support Citizens Initiated Referenda and you might<br />
notice that when this debate arose recently, the then Opposition<br />
Leader, Alexander Downer, came out against it and so, as I recall, did<br />
John Howard and the reason is I think that see what you have in<br />
Australia is you have an election every three years and you also a<br />
parliamentary system which means that your MP has an office and<br />
your constituency, and you can go and see them and talk to them and<br />
the political parties are affected by the ambient political climate of<br />
debates as they come along, whatever that debate might be. There is<br />
a very responsive, you have got a lot of participatory democracy in<br />
Australia. Here I am, I am the Prime Minister, I am on a radio station<br />
talking to you. You get Ministers, you get Opposition Leaders on radio<br />
every day of the week and on television and you get a right to hire or<br />
fire the rest of us every three years. So I think where we have seen<br />
some of these things like the proposition I think it was proposition 41,<br />
wasn't it in California, where they decided they'd reduce, by Citizens<br />
Initiated Referenda, the revenue raising powers of the State of<br />
California, they were going to put police off the beat, they had to cut * all<br />
the public transport and it wouldn't take us very long before people<br />
thought it was a bad idea.<br />
JC: Proposition 13.<br />
PM: Proposition 13.<br />
JC: Anyway, thank you for the call. A quick one from me Prime Minister.<br />
Did you see " 60 Minutes" on Sunday?<br />
PM: No I didn't. No.<br />
JC: They had a story about people living in Nimbin. They called<br />
themselves " the ferals" and they made it quite clear that they couldn't<br />
be there leading their pot-smoking lifestyle without the dole. Could we<br />
get some assurance that if somebody places himself or herself in a<br />
position where they can't get a job that there should be some pressure<br />
on behalf of the taxpayers to stop that funding of a lifestyle?<br />
PM: Absolutely. I mean let me say this, what we have is a work test. In<br />
other words, they must apply for work and be seen to apply for work<br />
and if they don't and if they don't actually apply for jobs and take them,<br />
they get bumped off and we have review teams that goes through each<br />
Social Security area to see that that is happening.<br />
JC: Yes, well I praise you for that. But, obviously, this is something that<br />
gets through that system or that net. </p>
<p>PM: The second thing is this. In Working Nation, where people are<br />
unemployed 12 months or more, we now give them the benefit of what<br />
we call case management. So one person relates to about 30 people<br />
who are unemployed 12 months or more. So they get to know their<br />
educational standards, their work experience, their aptitude, their<br />
personalities and then after 18 months we offer them a job, but they<br />
must take the job. We give them a job subsidy in case management<br />
that they must take the job. What that means is that anyone who is<br />
unemployed 12 months or more is going to be case managed. So the<br />
possibility of somebody in Nimbin.<br />
JC: Not the whole colony?<br />
PM: Not being known about haven't kept up their credentials under<br />
the work test being case managed, but being unknown to the case<br />
manager, is very unlikely. I have got to say to you, Jeremy, I didn't see<br />
the program, but I would be most surprised in an area where we have<br />
a lot of people who are living an alternative lifestyle, I would be most<br />
surprised that the Social Security regional administration isn't applying<br />
the work test to them. At any rate, I will inquire.<br />
JC: I would be grateful. I think my listeners would be as well because they<br />
were quite upset about it yesterday. Hello, Charles. Charles here is<br />
the Prime Minister.<br />
C: Good morning Jeremy.<br />
PM: How are you Charles?<br />
C: Good morning. I have just got a couple of quick questions. For a start,<br />
in the Budget they increased the cigarette prices, I am not a smoker or<br />
drinker, but why didn't they increase the alcohol because that does<br />
more damage than cigarettes and how do they expect the pensioners<br />
to save for their future when they have just gone and upped the<br />
deeming rate on them?<br />
PM: I am not sure that all the drinkers would agree with you about that, but<br />
anyway. The cigarette and tobacco excise is just one of those things<br />
that the Government has the option of increasing. You know we are<br />
trying to discourage people from smoking because of the health<br />
hazards. We now force companies to publish on the cigarette boxes<br />
and we do think there is some buyer resistance to price and if the price<br />
rises, fewer people are prone to be smoking. The deeming change is<br />
a change in equitable terms to increase the fairness for pensioners.<br />
That is, rather than look at each particular asset they have and deem<br />
the rate to it, what we have done is taken those as a block, given it a<br />
concessional deeming rate and then above a certain figure another<br />
deeming rate and the pensioner groups came out I think after the </p>
<p>Budget and were fairly laudatory of that change, so I don't think you<br />
should fear anything from that. I think you have got a benefit there.<br />
JC: Prime Minister I know you have got to go and I thank you for your time.<br />
There is a question here on the screen that says availability of flags.<br />
We were talking about a kind of Republicanism by stealth yesterday.<br />
Is there something from Canberra that some desire to make the<br />
Australian flag unavailable?<br />
PM: No, we hand it out with alacrity. You can get one at the drop of a hat.<br />
You can get some with a drop of a hat there.<br />
JC: Now you do promise?<br />
PM: Oh, absolutely. The Republic debate takes precedence over those<br />
things. You can still get the flag with the union jack in the corner any<br />
day you want to ask for it.<br />
JC: Alright, okay. Now one last question about Mt isa. Now here we are<br />
with a balance of payments problem and we are looking down the<br />
barrel of a major strike that will cost this country dearly if we can't fix it.<br />
Are you anticipating that you should intervene soon?<br />
PM: Well I think the Minister for Industrial Relations is taking an interest in<br />
it. But it is part of the new enterprise bargaining system. You know<br />
when you hear people like John Howard running around talking about<br />
we need a more flexible labour market, where employers and<br />
employees sit down and work it out. Well, that is what's happening<br />
right up there in Mt Isa at the moment. They have had a more flexible<br />
labour market and they are sitting down working it out.<br />
JC: Well it looks like the whole mining industry is going to go out because<br />
of Mt Isa Mines.<br />
PM: Well because, I think, in the agreement that will come out of it will be a<br />
pacesetter for the industry and that is why there is a lot of interest in it,<br />
but I certainly agree with you on this point, the quicker it is resolved<br />
and they get to an agreement and get back to work, the better.<br />
JC: Prime Minister thank you. You won't tell me when the next election is<br />
going to be? It is going to be soon, isn't it?<br />
PM: If they had certainty of knowledge, it would be a big help to me as well.<br />
I mean even though I have the option of fixing the time, I have always<br />
taken the view that these elections are too hard to win, to give a big<br />
lump of it away. We are going to sort of get our value from it before<br />
we turn in our badge. </p>
<p>12<br />
JC: But you will pull it on when you think it is most likely that you will win<br />
and right now it must be very tempting?<br />
PM: Well what I have said is that we will have an election in the cycle and<br />
that means you know when the term, when we are well and truly<br />
towards the end of this term and well we are two years and a quarter.<br />
JC: So you haven't made up your mind or you have made up your mind?<br />
PM: No, I certainly have not.<br />
JC: September doesn't ring a bell?<br />
PM: No, it doesn't ring a bell. I would like to give you a story here, Jeremy<br />
but I honestly haven't got one to give you.<br />
JC: Prime Minister stay well, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
