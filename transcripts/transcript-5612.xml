REMARKS BY<br />
THE PRESIDENT AND<br />
PRIME MINISTER FRASER<br />
OF AUSTRALIA<br />
AT ARRIVAL CEREMONY<br />
The South Lawn<br />
10: 11 A. M1EDT THE PRESIDENT: Prime Minister Fraser, th6 American<br />
people welcome you to our country with a deep and a heartfelt<br />
warmth reserved for only the best of friends. Nancy and I are<br />
pleased to be able to welcome you and Mrs. Fraser as representatives<br />
of a country with whom we are proud to be allied and the American<br />
people are grateful to have as friends.<br />
' I Robert Louis. Stevenson wrote, " we are all travelers<br />
what John Bunyan calls he wilderness of this world. And the<br />
best that we find in our travels is an honest friend they keep<br />
us worthy of ourselves." And people of Australia are honest and<br />
loyal friends, independent of mind and will who bring strength of<br />
character and courage to the international community. America's<br />
proud to have such an ally in a world where freedom and democracy<br />
are constantly challenged.<br />
Australians have fought side-by-side with Americans<br />
in every major war in this century. They've opened their hearts and<br />
homes to us when we were away from home and they have stood with<br />
us in good times and bad. And America is grateful to have such<br />
steadfast-friends. </p>
<p>You, Mr. Prime Minister, are a world leader who has<br />
aade Australia a force for peace. Under your government Australia<br />
" hsdone much-to bring independence and economic growth to developing<br />
count2. ies as close to you as Southeast Asia and as far away as<br />
Africa. And there you played the kev.-role in commonwealth<br />
consultations leading to the independence of Zimbabwe. Together<br />
with New Zealand, Australia and America have shared a,. bond of a<br />
tripartite ANqZUS alliance.<br />
For 30 years working together to maintain peace and<br />
security in the East Asian and Pacific regions, as Sir Robert Menzies<br />
said, " We work for the same kind of free world. We see the world<br />
from similar perspectives, though no two countries could be on more<br />
opposite ends of the globe. We share values shaped on the new world<br />
frontier * passed on to us as our heritage. We live in freedom.. and will*<br />
accept no other life. We govern ourselves in democracy and will not<br />
tolerate anything less. We cherish liberty and hold it safe providing<br />
hope for the rest of the world. We were born in the same era, sprang<br />
from the same stock and live for the samne ideals. Australie and.<br />
America share an affinity that reaches to our souls."<br />
You have said, Mr. Prime Minister, that the liberty we<br />
enjoy has no guarantee. And most impoortantly*, liberty requires<br />
an understanding by ordinary people of what is at stake. The survival<br />
of the whole way of life depends on their commitment. </p>
<p>1
Minister, I heard your powerful declaration in your speech bei'ore<br />
the B'nai B'rith here in Washington last September. You reminded : us<br />
that a people without an objective are a people lost a people with<br />
faith are a people destroyed a people without conviction wLll. not<br />
survive. It is liberty which provides the objective, liberty which<br />
allows faith liberty which sustains conviction, but liberty is not<br />
an inevitable state and there is no law which guarantees that once<br />
achieved it will survive. Its preservation requires skill, determinaand<br />
strength. Mr. Prime Minister, the Australian example is an inspira'<br />
f or free people everywhere. You may be assured that Am~ rica will rema.<br />
vigilqnt, will keep herself strong and will always be a dependable<br />
* partner in the quest for stability, freedom'and peace.<br />
Australia is indeed a friend who keeps us worthy of<br />
ourselves. Prime Minister Fraser, I look forward to our meetings<br />
today as an opportunity to enhance our cooperation with one of<br />
our closest allies, but it will also be a pleasure to get to know the<br />
* Frasers get to know them better, strengthening the personal. friendsc<br />
between our two lands.<br />
So, on behalf of all Americans, I welcome you to the Unit<br />
States. ( Applause.)<br />
) PRIME MINISTER FRASER: 14r. President, from my wife and<br />
myself and the Australian party who are with me, thank you very much<br />
* indeed for your warm and generous welcome. I'm looking forward, inde~<br />
to the discussions that we shall be having.<br />
Australia and the United States, as you pointed out, Mr.<br />
President,---share a commitment to the values of freedom and of. democrac<br />
And we know that these values are not mere words, they stand for our<br />
way of life for the attitudes we have toward people and the kind ol<br />
opportunities we want for our children. </p>
<p>we share a faith in the enterprise and judgment of free<br />
men and women. Both our countries were built by immigrants from<br />
across the seas, pursuing dreams of liberty and of independence -7 the<br />
dr, 6am of freedom can have the same powerful good in the world today<br />
as it had at the foundation of this great republic. And the world<br />
certainly needs strong and confident voices spe aking for freedom.<br />
You have come, Mr. President, to your great office at<br />
the end of what has been, in many ways, a decade of adversity. You<br />
embody through your eloquence and courage the determination to overcom<br />
that adversity. in your inaugural address you urged America to<br />
begin an era of renewal. The energy and ingenuity of the American<br />
people, their capacity to rise to a challenge gives me confidence that<br />
they Vgill respond are responding to your call.<br />
Indeed the clear evidence that they're doing so already<br />
must be encouraging to all of us. The future of the course of<br />
freedom around the world depends so greatly on the leadership of<br />
the United States. There are so many things that -will not be done<br />
unless * the United States is prepared to do them. There is so much<br />
that only the world's greatest democracy can do. But we're well<br />
aware that powerful as you are, other countries also have a role<br />
and a duty. All of the democracies need that confidence in theinselve<br />
that sense of larger purpose, that willingness to play a part which<br />
can create the will to~ work together and to prevail.<br />
., There are obvious limnits, Mr. President, to what a<br />
nation of 40 million people can do. But, Mr. President, Australians<br />
R E </p>
<p>are a people given to forming our own views and it's this spirit<br />
of independence that makes us determined to be active in improving<br />
the condition of mankind and to contribute effectively to the cause<br />
of peace and of freedom.<br />
The relationships between Americans and Australians<br />
have always been warm and spontaneous and the alliance between<br />
our countries reflects that friendship. But it does, I suggest, more<br />
than that. It is built on the bedrock of mutual interests. As<br />
countries whose peoples fought and died in two world wars, we share<br />
an abiding convitment to world peace. As countries bordering the<br />
same ocean, we share a central concern for stability and prosperity<br />
in the Asia Pacific region. And as two of the world's democracies,<br />
we share a concern for liberty and the open society.<br />
Mr. President, it used to be said of one great<br />
democratic statesman, that he was at his most effective and formidable<br />
on the rebound. I trust that far before the end of your Presidency<br />
as Western economies recover, as Western defenses strengthen, as<br />
western will is remobilized, we. will have demonstrated that the<br />
same is true of democracy itself.<br />
We, in Australia, along with the rest of the civilized<br />
world, admire greatly the courage and composure that you showed,<br />
Mr. President, throughout the ordeal that followed the attempt on<br />
your life some weeks ago. You have shown by personal demonstration<br />
that given old-fashioned strength of character, it is possible to<br />
dominate events, rather than to surrender to those events.<br />
In doing so,' you transformed an ugly and potentially<br />
tragic event'into one from which decent men and women could grow<br />
confidence.. I thank. you again, very much, Mr. President, for your<br />
welcome to Tamara and to myself, to the Australian party today. I'm<br />
looking forward very much to gettjingto know you and Mrs. Reagan: and<br />
to having our discussions. -( Applause.) END10: 25 A. M. EDT </p>
