    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>FOR PRESS P.M.Â Â No. 12/1966</strong></p>
<p>The death of Sir Shane Paltridge is a great blowÂ to the Government, Parliament, and people. It is a deepÂ sorrow for me, for he honoured me with a close personalÂ friendship, and by his character and achievements, togetherÂ with his unsurpassed integrity, inspired in me a very realÂ affection for him. He has left behind him an honoured name.</p>
<p>Shane Paltridge had a fine record as a Minister.Â He tackled no problem that he did not master. He was a veryÂ good administrator, and an unfailing source of wisdom andÂ good humour in Cabinet.<br />We are sad for his wife and family, and extendÂ our sympathy to them.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />21st January, 1966.</p>
