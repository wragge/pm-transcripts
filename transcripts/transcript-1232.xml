    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>FOR PRESS P.M.  No. 12/1966</strong></p>
<p>The death of Sir Shane Paltridge is a great blow to the Government, Parliament, and people. It is a deep sorrow for me, for he honoured me with a close personal friendship, and by his character and achievements, together with his unsurpassed integrity, inspired in me a very real affection for him. He has left behind him an honoured name.</p>
<p>Shane Paltridge had a fine record as a Minister. He tackled no problem that he did not master. He was a very good administrator, and an unfailing source of wisdom and good humour in Cabinet.<br />We are sad for his wife and family, and extend our sympathy to them.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />21st January, 1966.</p>
