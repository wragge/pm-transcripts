ADDRESS TO THE TASMANIAN STATE COUNCIL<br />
OF THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
HOBART<br />
I am delighted to be in Tasmania at this time. There is no<br />
doubt that the future progress and prosperity of Tasmania and<br />
the whole of Australia depends enormously upon the Liberal Party.<br />
It depends upon what we do, u on the soundness of the policies we pursue, and<br />
upon our capacity to encouraae the spirit and responsibilities<br />
which puts the interests of all Australians and all Australian<br />
States above the sectional interests of groups who seek only<br />
their own advantage at.-the expense of the well-being of others.<br />
The Liberal Party has this responsibility because it is the only<br />
Party with a national outlook, with a realistic philosophy which<br />
reflects the values of rost Australians, and with the capacity<br />
to put forward the kind of policies and provide the kind of<br />
government which Australia needs through the 1980' s and beyond.<br />
First and foremost these are policies geared to providing a<br />
better life for individual Australians and their families. Let<br />
me say right at the start that this central objective of ours is<br />
fully reflected in the Budget we have just brought down.<br />
There is no doubt that Aulstralians are deeply concerned about the<br />
level of interest rates, and that they want to see Australia continue<br />
to move forward strong! y so that the living standards of all<br />
Australians can improve. The Budget is a major instrument for<br />
achieving these objectives, and what is most important about the<br />
Budget is its overall impact on the economy, on interest rates,<br />
on inflation, on employment, on growth.<br />
The Budget is a part of the same strategy for strengthening the<br />
economy that we have pursued consistently since 1975. It has been<br />
a strategy based on cutting back on spending, on bureaucracy,<br />
and pursuing policies to bear down strongly on taxes. It is<br />
this strategy which has made Australia now the most strongly<br />
growing economy in the industrialised world, with stronger<br />
employment growth than any of the major Western economies. </p>
<p>2<br />
In this Budget we have almost completely eliminated the deficit<br />
we inherited fron Labor and by budgetting for a large domestic<br />
surplus we will be easing tremendously the claims for capital<br />
funds, and the pressures on interest rates. The Budget is<br />
therefore a quite major step in making room for the private<br />
enterprise growth essential to growing employment opportunities<br />
and a strong and prosperous Australia. In the two years to May,<br />
as a result of the Government's policies, some 300,000<br />
new jobs were provided by private enterprise, and real wages<br />
increased over last year by some four per cent, so there has<br />
been a substantial increase in real living standards. That<br />
increase in real wages represents some $ 3,000 million more going<br />
to Australian families. Those increased wages and salaries can<br />
only be paid if our factories, farms and mines are profitable,<br />
and if more Australian goods are being sold overseas. The ability<br />
of Australian industry to pay higher wages does not come about<br />
by accident. It comes about because sound policy creates the<br />
conditions for business profitability. Maybe people too often<br />
look at Budgets to see what they have been given directly, whereas<br />
what they should be looking for is a Budget which gives them a<br />
prosperous and secure Australia.<br />
The main test of a Budget is whether it contributes to an economic<br />
environment that provides a sound basis for rising living<br />
standards and a secure future, as this Budget does. The Budget<br />
is designed to make sure that the foundations of the great<br />
economic progress now occurring in Australia are strengthened<br />
further and there is nothing more important than this in showing<br />
the genuine concern of this Government with the condition of life<br />
of the Australian fa. ily. The point that it is the overall<br />
impact of the Budget on the economy that must be considered first<br />
is fund-ental and it is a message we all need to get across to<br />
the comm. unity. If the fundamental policy approach is not right,<br />
no other policies can be effectively implemented.<br />
There has been a lot of comment on the sales tax decisions announced<br />
in the Budget. Let me take a moment to make quite plain the<br />
Government's policy on taxation. The whole objective and thrust<br />
of our policies is to reduce the overall burden of taxation on<br />
individuals and f-amilies. Tax cuts for this financial year,<br />
which will leave some $ 500 million more in taxpayers' pockets,<br />
were announced and in operation prior to the Budget. In addition,<br />
there will be a tax rebate of 32 cents in the dollar for basic<br />
health insurance, returning a further $ 600 million, to taxpayers.<br />
A lower overall tax burden can come about in one way and in<br />
one way only by holding down Government spending. The Liberal<br />
Party is the only Party which can justifiably claim it is the<br />
Party of lower taxation, because it is the only Party committed<br />
to reversing the growth of Government.<br />
Statements that the overall burden of taxation on Australians has<br />
increased since 1975 are totally misleading. Labor in power lifted<br />
Commonwealth spending from less than 24 cents in every dollar<br />
produced in Australia to over 30 cents. We have cut it back to<br />
under 28 cents and our objective is to cut it back still further.<br />
These are the central factors in determining the real burden which<br />
Government spending imposes on the community. </p>
<p>3<br />
3y 1975 Gcverr-. ent spending * w* as rising so fast that tax<br />
collections could not keep up, and there was a huge deficit as<br />
a result. In considering the real burden imposed by Government on<br />
the community the deficit is as important as taxation, for the<br />
deficit must ultimately be paid for in one way or another just<br />
as households must repay their debts. In 1975, when we take<br />
into account both income tax and the burden of the deficit, the<br />
total burden from Government spending on individuals was almost<br />
18 cents in every dollar produced. We have reduced that to<br />
about 14 cents.<br />
What is crucial in the end is the proportion of the nation's<br />
incomes spent by Goverrnent, and under this Government that<br />
proportion is falling. That is the only way the overall burden<br />
of taxes can come down.-<br />
The Budget also has made a valuable step towards shifting the balance<br />
of taxes away from direct on to indirect taxes, and as the<br />
Treasurer stated on Budget night, one of the valuable consequences<br />
of this is that it increases the potential for desirable reductions<br />
in direct taxes, and particularly personal income tax, as economic<br />
and budgetary conditions permit. I emphasise again that only<br />
policies which restrain Government spending as ours do can<br />
pave the way for responsible reductions in taxation, and for a<br />
strong economy with rising living standards for all.<br />
Throughout our period of office one of our principle concerns<br />
has been to protect those who are disadvantaged and most in need<br />
in our commrunity. Spending on social security and welfare is the<br />
largest single item in the Budget and now takes up about 28 per cent<br />
of the whole Budget. This year our spending on social. security<br />
and welfare will rise by 14.5 per cent, a substantial increase in<br />
real terms.<br />
One of our first major steps in this area in 1976 was to<br />
introduce the automatic indexation of pensions and benefits<br />
and the annual cost of this indexation element alone will be<br />
over $ 700 million this year. Beyond this our aim has been to<br />
increasingly direct assistance to those most in need, to concentrate<br />
spending where it can do most good for those who need help most.<br />
This is why, in expanding assistance to families this year, we<br />
decided to increase benefits for larger families for some of the<br />
areas of greatest hardship in our community are among large families.<br />
This measure will help over half a million families including<br />
many of the poorest.<br />
Other groups in special need have also received special assistance<br />
from this Budget. In recognition of the particular hardship suffered<br />
by many needy pensioners in rented accommodation, we have re-directed<br />
and increased the program. e of rental assistance to pensioners and<br />
long-term sickness beneficiaries so as to provide more support<br />
to those paying higher rents. A crisis accommodation programme<br />
is being developed with special emphasis on the needs of families.<br />
Our support for the handicapped and disabled has risen very<br />
substantially in real terms over the period of the Government and<br />
has been increased again in the Budget. Let me also mention here<br />
that the new health arrangements have also been designed to help<br />
those on lowest incomes, and provides for free health care for about<br />
three million Australians. / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
The Government believes . hnat the determination we have to protect<br />
those most in need in our community is not only a primary<br />
obligation, but reflects the values of Australians generally. We<br />
have also had in mind in this Budget particularly the need to<br />
help our young People find good jobs. The most important action<br />
here again is to pursue responsible economic policies which increase<br />
the ability of private enterprise to provide jobs. Let me say -that'<br />
the merit of this approach has been clearly shown this year. As<br />
une mployment generally has fallen, so young people especially have<br />
been more successful in finding jobs. In fact the number of school<br />
leavers seeking their fiJrst job in June this year is the lowest<br />
for three years and * has fallen by over 13,00o in the last 12 months,<br />
a twenty per cent decline over the year ( down from 46,400 in June<br />
1980 to -33,000 in June 1981)<br />
Our programnme's to help young people equip themselves for jobs have<br />
been very greatly expanded. We are now spending over $ 200, million<br />
on programmues to expand the supply of skilled labour and to assist<br />
young people in search of. employment an increase of 22 per cent<br />
over last year. Some 100,000 apprentices, 5,000 more than last year,<br />
will be assisted throu; h the Craft and Special Apprentice Training<br />
Schemes. in 1982 we will be allocating up to $ 75.4 million on<br />
school to work transition programmes within a one per cent<br />
overall real increase in the education budget. We are giving special<br />
attention to the needs of secondary students from low income families.<br />
We announced in the Bu: et increases in secondary allowances tol<br />
help poorer families keez their children at school, and obtain the<br />
beneft of' additional schooling.<br />
Our decision to terminate the Community Youth Support Scheme simply<br />
reflects our wish that increased 1evel of funding in the area<br />
of youth asSistance shculd be concentrated on programmes with<br />
stronger prospects of leading to jobs. Since we believe other<br />
programmes -are doing much more good our view was that it did not make<br />
sense to maintain a programme concerning the effectiveness of which<br />
there were many doubts.<br />
The Budget is not just a very sound and responsible economic<br />
document it is fundamentally a Budget designed to express the<br />
Liberal Party's con-cern for individuals and for families. With<br />
realistic policies to express that concern I have no doubt that,-the<br />
Liberal Party will continue to have the support of the people<br />
throughout Australia, and here in Tasmania.<br />
The Tasmanian Party is obvriously facing up to the task of comin.-g<br />
into Government 1983. Let me say that if the kind of package<br />
which Geoff Pearsall and Robin Gray put forward as an alternative<br />
Co the Lowe Government's so-called cutting exercise is any<br />
indication and I am sure it is then the State Parliamentary<br />
Party-is surely moving in the right direction.<br />
Tasmania has special needs and special problems which the Liberal<br />
Party at both State and Federal levels is far more able than the<br />
Labor Party to handle. obviously, Tasmania's dependence on the air<br />
transport links with the rest of Australia makes it tremendously<br />
vulnerable both to strikes and to excessive cost increases. </p>
<p>S-0 5<br />
I am well aware of how real the threat of isolation, the threat<br />
of being almost completely cut off from the rest of Australia,<br />
can be. I want to repeat something that I said in answer to<br />
Ian Chalk's question at the Federal Council Meeting this year,<br />
namely that the Commonwealth Government has an on-going commitment<br />
to use the resources it has to maintain air links to Tasmania.<br />
The Government would never tolerate a situation in which that<br />
link was cut.<br />
During the recess there have obviously been significant problems<br />
in industrial relations and in the wage fixing area. Obviously<br />
these problems can be particularly damaging to States such as<br />
Tasmania but I believe that one tremendously valuable thing<br />
that has come out of these difficulties is that there has been<br />
established a strong basis for on-going discussion between the<br />
Government and the ACTU, a basis which it was never possible<br />
to establish during the time when Bob Hawke was President of<br />
the ACTU. The potential value of such discussions must be<br />
obvious to all. I believe that we shall all experience its<br />
benefits in the months and years ahead.<br />
Turning to wages, when the Arbitration Cormmission indicated the<br />
abandonment of wage indexation, instead of a lot of people saying<br />
there was a vacuum, that the sky was the limit, I would have<br />
thought many people would realise that the decision would reinforce<br />
the authority of the Co.. ission and establish thrc-ugh industry and National Wage<br />
decisions a stable er. viironmet. What indexation did was to establish a higher<br />
limit from which people could then set out to negctiate for more. We all<br />
know that that is what occurred. There was a 4% or 5% real<br />
increase in wages last year. Without indexation there is no<br />
vacuum. The Comm. ission is there. All State Governments tell<br />
me that they support the centralised wage fixation system, and<br />
the ACTU also says the same thing. There will be industry cases<br />
that will establish guidelines. There will be a National Wage<br />
Case in February that will establish guidelines. People will have<br />
to argue their cases with a sense of reason and firmness and<br />
strength if they want a result. With indexation, of course,<br />
everything automatically jacked up on to a higher plateau every<br />
year or every six months.<br />
The fact that the circumstances have changed is now being much<br />
better understood. We had a meeting last week again, with the<br />
ACTU, with employers and with Premiers in relation to it. I think<br />
that the decisions that were made then should help people to<br />
understand that there is a system and it is up to all the parties<br />
to make that system work. It is worth noting that all Premiers<br />
of all political persuasions agreed that they would lend their<br />
efforts and energies to achieving that.<br />
Let me also mention briefly the problem of tra-sport costs to Tasmania<br />
which are well recognised by the Commonwealth. Beyond our<br />
anti-inflationary economic policies, the Commonwealth Government<br />
has for some years maintained a freight equalisation scheme, which<br />
is of vital benefit to Tasmania, and it is here to stay.<br />
/ 6 c-</p>
<p>-6-<br />
In addition to that, the airbridge formula, which subsidises<br />
air fares to the tune of 10% at a cost of over $ 5 million, is<br />
designed to encourage travel to and from Tasmania and I believe<br />
it provides the appropriate response from the Commonwealth to the<br />
very considerable costs of travel and also of course in relation<br />
to the tourist industry. These are just two examples of the<br />
Commonwealth Govern. ment's concern for the needs and well-being<br />
of Tasmania.<br />
The Government cares'about the well-being and prosperity of all<br />
States and all people in Australia, not just about the wealthy,<br />
powerful States and not only about the marginal electorates as<br />
Labor so often does. But of course, the greatest contribution<br />
that the Cormonwealth Government can make to the well-being of<br />
Tasmania is to make certain of prosperity across Australia as a<br />
whole. Provided that we can Faintain the stable economic environment which<br />
has-been achieved over the last few years, provided that our<br />
economic recovery and growth can be strengthened, provided we<br />
can avoid the kind of excessive disruption and selfish demands<br />
which have been all too apparent in recent months, we will increasingl<br />
bring about the situation in which people, on the basis of their<br />
judgments and with the use of their initiatives will be able to<br />
build prosperity right across-this country.<br />
