THE FIRST SMUTJ1S 14EMORIAL LECTURE<br />
by The Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies, C. H. Prime Minister<br />
of Australia at the * Jniversity of tambridge Monday 16th May,<br />
1960<br />
THE CHANGING COMM4ONWJEAL TH<br />
Jan Christian Smuts was one of the most remarkable<br />
men in modern history. He wras a scholar in the finest sense;<br />
a soldier of remarkable distinction, a South African statesman<br />
who made an imperishable contribution to the history and institutions<br />
of his own land; a Commonwealth States~ nan whose<br />
towering abilities made him a commanding figure, the trusted<br />
confidant and adviser of the gy: iant of the age, dinston Churchill;<br />
a world leader " the veriy wind of .7hose name" if I may<br />
borrow that great phrase spoken by J. M. Barrie about the<br />
Scots " has swept to the ultimate seas",<br />
feel it a -reat and unmerited honoix that you should<br />
have chosen me to deliver the first " Smuts Memorial Lecliire" l<br />
in this ancient university of which, in the course of his incredibly<br />
versatile career, he became Chancellor.<br />
Oddly enough, though I have had a " walking-on" part<br />
in some of the iorld dramas of the past quarter of a century,<br />
I never met him except through reading and report. But such is<br />
the force of personality that I always felt that for me he was<br />
a living presence. In spite of past events, or perhaps because of them,<br />
he became a great champion and expositor of the lBritisha Commonwealth,<br />
and had at all times clear views about the changes<br />
wrought in it in and since 1926. It is for this reason that I<br />
have chosen to say something to you, in honour of his memory,<br />
W on " The Changing Commonwealth".<br />

I' wrote it in a few days, had it sharply criticised by his wife,<br />
was enraged by the criticism, and then accepted it, and then<br />
tossed the manuscript into the fire, and then in another few<br />
days re-wrote the whole thing in its present immortal form.<br />
It is a great story. But wh-should I begin by reminding you<br />
of it? Certainly, not that i can write like Robert Louis<br />
Stevenson, nor, indeed, that the story has any parallel with<br />
mine except in one respect. I began to write this lecture on<br />
a quiet weekend in Canberra. I thought tih-at I knew something<br />
about J. C. Smuts in a broad way; that in theory and practice<br />
I was not unfamiliar with modern Commonwealth constitutional<br />
development; and that the political Smuts fitted into that<br />
development in a way uhich was intelligible to me. And so I<br />
wrote on, increasingly more interested in my own ideas than in<br />
those of Smuts until, finding it necessary to consider the basis<br />
of Commonwealth changes, I laid my writin3-pad aside, and began<br />
to re-read Smuts. I even essayed " Holism and Evolution",<br />
whipped on by Peter Drucker's " The Landmarks of Tomorrow", in<br />
which he describes Jan Christian Smuts as " that astounding<br />
South African, the closest to the " whole man" this century has<br />
produced". The more I read, the more I marvelled at the genius<br />
of the man whom this lecture commemorates. 111ho was I to speak<br />
to his name and memory? How superficial were my own views: how<br />
shallow my own intellectual experiences. vdhy not toss my draft<br />
into the fire and, unlike Stevenson, write no more? </p>
<p>And yet, the more I thought about it, the more I<br />
realised that the researches of Smuts, leading him away from<br />
the static properties of matter and the disciplines which static<br />
considerations impose, to the dynamic post-evolutionary concepts<br />
of the grouth from " whole" to " whole", provided a key to<br />
the problem o f Commonwealth evolution, in the solving of which,<br />
as a practical man of affairs, he had much to do. The Commonwealth,<br />
as I shall endeavour to show, is the best proof of<br />
Smuts' central thesis, that " the whole is greater than the sum<br />
of its parts". Further, if there is, as events have s'novn, nothing<br />
static about our gre at associ,: tion, we must be prepared for<br />
changes in the living organism. it must contain within itself<br />
not only the past, but the present and the future. There must<br />
be room for the ascertainment of basic principles, but there<br />
must be no room for dogma. ; UJmeu st not be merely the historians<br />
of the Commonwealth, but the creators of its future form.<br />
if, in the course of my remarks, I refer to past events, it<br />
will not be to engage in the vain task of wishing them undone,<br />
for the clock does not turn back, but to try to see where we<br />
have gone, and whore we are going.<br />
When the Balfour formula was evolved in 1926, many<br />
thought that the new Commonwealth had acquired definition and<br />
historic form. " Empire" had been taken by some to connote the<br />
subordination of the Dominions; this notion was now swept<br />
away. The Dominions were declared to be " autonomous communities",<br />
" in no way subordinate one to another". There it was,<br />
plainly stated. : de in Australia, characteristically enough,<br />
had not for maryyears thought ourselves subordinate, but still,<br />
there was no harm in the fact being expressed. The formula<br />
then went on to use what I have myself on an earlier occasion<br />
described as " three expressions of great cohesive significance.<br />
They were-" within the British Empire"<br />
" united by a common alleg7iance to the Crown"<br />
" the British Commonwealth of Nations".<br />
Here, we said, was " unity in diversity", a unity possessing a<br />
slightly theological flavour, it was true, but neverthc~ iss expressed<br />
in a new formula ihich wrould, once and for all, convert<br />
the mystically unexpressed into lucid form, ustablishing<br />
equality but preserving structureo; opening up a new era for<br />
self-government and development.<br />
F'our years later, the Prime Ministers at their 1930<br />
conference, evolved what became the Statute of ' Iestminster 1931,<br />
clearing up a few technical matters of power,, but reciting in<br />
its preamble that " as the Crown is the symbol of the free association<br />
of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations,<br />
and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown...,"<br />
So theri it was, complete and tidy; and to a monarchist,<br />
all compact of a superb blending of heartening emotion and<br />
enduring structure. Unlike that peculiar product of the<br />
British inductive genius, the non-existent British Constitution,<br />
the Commonwealth had a iritten charter for all to see. Only<br />
thirty years ag'o; but in those years the great definitive<br />
formula has become largely obsolete, true only in a fragmentary<br />
iay, in many respects altured beyond recognition.<br />
I will take the " three expressions" in heir order.<br />
1. The expression " within the British Empire" has ceased<br />
to have acceptance, partly because the notion of a group of<br />
completely self-gov. ning nations existing within " an Empire"<br />
was not in its nature one which could long endure, and partly<br />
because the word Empire itself has fallen from grace, Wo now </p>
<p>leave the creation of colonial or satellite empires to the<br />
Communist powers, and have been talked into believing that<br />
" imperialism" and " jingoism" vere synonymous.<br />
2. The second expression, " united by a common allegiance<br />
to the Crown", is no lon6er accurate, nor should we pretend<br />
that it is. Great Britain, C-nada, Australia South Africa, New<br />
Zealand, Ceylon and Ghana are at the momen united by a common<br />
allegiance to the Crown. But Ghana and Ceylon are designed<br />
to become Republics, like India and Pakistan. Malaya is no<br />
Republic, but has a monarch of its own, to w. hom it owes<br />
alleoiance, The Government of South Africa has made no secret<br />
of its Republican objective, and evun now the Crown is less<br />
" visible" in South African administration and affairs than it<br />
is in, say, Australia.<br />
All this means that at some future time there may<br />
well be only Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand<br />
who could be described as united by the common allegiance, the<br />
femaining Commonwealth countries having a measure of unity<br />
with us and with each other established on a quite different<br />
foundation. This is much more than a change of form. I am<br />
going to say a little more about it, because it seems to me to<br />
be very important that we in the Crown Dominions should not<br />
weaken our own principles by pretending that they are not<br />
matters of substance.<br />
Republican membership of the Commonwealth was accepted<br />
by the Prime Ministers in April 1949 in a Statement which<br />
merits complete quotation.<br />
" The Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada,<br />
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan<br />
and Ceylon, whose countries are united as Members of the<br />
British Commonwealth of Nations and owe a common allegiance<br />
to the Crown, which is also the symbol of their<br />
free association, have considered the impending constitutional<br />
changes in India.<br />
The Government of India have informed the other<br />
Governments of the Commonwealth of the intention of the<br />
Indian people that under the new constitution rhich is<br />
about to be adopted India shall become a sovereign independent<br />
republic. The Government of India have however<br />
declared and affirmed India's desire to continue her full<br />
membership of the Commonwealth of Nations and her acceptance<br />
of the King-as the symbol of the free association of<br />
its independent membe. nations and as such the Head of<br />
the Commonwealth. The Governments of the other countries of the Commonwealth,<br />
the basis of whose membership of the Commonwealth<br />
is not hereby changed, accept and recognize India's continuing<br />
membership in accordance with the terms of this<br />
declaration. Accordingly, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,<br />
New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Ceylon,<br />
hereby declare that they remain united as free and equal<br />
members of the Commonwealth of Nations, freely co-operating<br />
in the pursuit of peace, liberty and progress."<br />
Note that at the time of the declaration India had<br />
not actually become a republic; the opening paragraph was<br />
therefore a correct statement of the then position. The </p>
<p>statement as a whole makes it quite clear, if it needed to be<br />
made so, that India as a Republic, would no longer owe allegiance<br />
to the Crown. But she accepted " the King as the symbol<br />
of her free association... and as such the head of the Commonwealth".<br />
Ever since this historic decision, the Crown ceases<br />
to have any internal significance in a Republican member. The<br />
Queen disappears from Parliament, the Courts of Law, the armed<br />
forces. In Australia, by way of comparison, the Governor-<br />
General is the Queen's representative, I am the Queen's Prime<br />
Minister; my ministers and I are the Queen's servants; our<br />
S are enacted by " the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty,<br />
te eo, and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia". All members of Parliament take oath or<br />
ffirmat on of allegiance. Legal process issues in the name<br />
f the ueen. The judges are the Queen's judges. In short,<br />
our who e structure, legislative, executive, and judicial, is<br />
built ound the presence of the Crown.<br />
J Nobody remained unmoved when the Queen in opening<br />
Perliament at Canberra on February 15, 1954, staoed the matter<br />
quite simply ' The first Section of the Constitution of the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia provides that the legislative power<br />
of the Commonwealth shall be vested in " a Federal Parliament,<br />
which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a<br />
House of Representatives".<br />
It is therefore a joy for me, today, to address you<br />
not as a Queen from far away, but as YOUR Queen and as<br />
part of YOUR Parliament. In a real sense, you are here<br />
as my colleagues, friends, and advisors.<br />
When I add to this consideration the fact that I am<br />
the first ruling Sovereign to visit Australia, it is clear<br />
that the events of today make a piece of history which<br />
fills me with deep pride and the most heartfelt pleasure,<br />
and which I am confident will serve to strengthen in your<br />
own hearts and minds a feeling of comradeship with the<br />
Crown and that sense of duty shared which we must all have<br />
as we confront our common tasks.'<br />
The Prime Ministers in 1949 were clearly not unconscious<br />
of the fact that they were creating two relationships<br />
instead of one; preferring this duality to the contraction of<br />
Commonwealth membership. Note the words<br />
" The Government of the other countries of the<br />
Commonwealth, the basis of whose membership of the Commonwealth<br />
is not hereby changed, accept and recognise India's<br />
continuing membership in accordance with the terms of this<br />
declaration". Was this duality affected by the phrase " Head of the<br />
Commonwualth"? That it was a valuable and significant expression<br />
nobody would deny. It had far-reaching effects. But what<br />
does it mean? It does not mean that the Sovereign is " Queen of<br />
the. Commonwealth", for she cannot be the Queen of a Republic,<br />
* hat it does mean is that the member Republic says, in effect,<br />
to the Crown members " We recognise that the Queen, though she<br />
is not our Queen, occupies a position at the centre of the<br />
Commonwealth which permits us to regard her as a symbol of our<br />
association with other Commonwealth countries, whether republic<br />
or monarchies". This means that the relationship is external,<br />
and not internal.<br />
One interesting thing about this historic decision<br />
is that Smuts was dismayed. As his son says in his biography </p>
<p>" My father declared that this ' violated every concept of the<br />
Commonwealth...' You are either in the Commonwealth or out of<br />
it. If the Commonwealth concept is tampered with or destroyed,<br />
and it is still proposed to continue the Commonwealth system,<br />
there would have to be a new basis of agreement between the<br />
member States, with a written constitution on the lines of the<br />
League of Nations or the organisation of the United Nations...<br />
'. hat India appears to wish is therefore not compatible with<br />
the Commonwealth, and cannot be achieved in terms of it".<br />
He wont on to warn<br />
" Groat care should be taken not to empty the concept<br />
of the Commonwealth of all substance ahd meaning, and not to<br />
whittle it away until nothing but the word remained with no<br />
real meaning or significance. Far better would it be to drop<br />
it altogether," At the time when the declaration was announced by Mr.<br />
Chifloy at Canberra, my own views as Leader of the Opposition<br />
were not dissimilar. Iprepared what I thought to be a powerful<br />
and pungent speech. Chifloy, who, to use the homely phrase<br />
" didn't come down in the last shower", guessed my intentions,<br />
and, with studied calm, left the item at the bottom of the<br />
Notice Paper. When months had gone by, I naturally felt that<br />
the incident was closed, and tore up my undelivered speech. I<br />
had, not for the first or the last time, learned the discipline<br />
of past and unalterable events.<br />
The great purpose of my present address is not to<br />
sit in vain judgment upon the past, but to ascertain the<br />
present nature of the structural and dynamic elements in<br />
Commonwealth development, What I have to say to you is designed<br />
to be not censorious but explanatory, not gloomily<br />
retrospective but optimistically forward-looking.<br />
3. The third expressions " the British Commonwealth of<br />
Nations" has also fallen into partial disuse. It is still the<br />
natural expression for the Crown Dominions, or at least for<br />
those who by derivation are British. But it clearly is not<br />
acceptable to the newer Commonwealth nations. This fact<br />
clearly emerged in the Declaration of the Prime Ministers in<br />
1949. As we have already soon, that declaration, in its<br />
opening paragraph, in which the Governments concerned were<br />
speaking before the Indian Republic, described the declaring<br />
governments as " members of the British Commonwealth of Nations''<br />
The later operative clauses dealing with the republican status<br />
of India referred to " the Commonwealth of Nations". This was<br />
no accident. It was fully discussed at the Conference. It<br />
recognised, so to speak, the facts of life and of popular<br />
sentiment in the new nations. Faced with those facts, even I<br />
can call my lecture " The Changing Commonwealth" without it<br />
being thought that I am speaking of the Commonwealth of Australia,<br />
rhile the Empire Parliamentary Association has become<br />
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association almost by default<br />
of opposition. So far, I have boon concerned to point out the nature<br />
and to try to estimate the significance of the structural changes<br />
which have occurred during my own political life-time. I<br />
have done this principally because I want now to direct myself<br />
to two major questions.<br />
1. ' hat is the significance of the Crown in the new<br />
Commonwealth?<br />
2. Apart from the Crown, what are the elements which<br />
mark out the Commonwealth from other alliances or<br />
organisations of Nations? </p>
<p>I cannot deal however briefly, w ith the significance<br />
of the Crown in relation to the Commonwealth without<br />
first saying something about its significance to those who are<br />
within the allegiance. Are we the Queen's men and women because,<br />
as the fact is, we love and respect her? Or because,<br />
out of long experience, we find in the Monarchy as such a<br />
focal point, unmarred by political controversy, for our national<br />
tradition, consciousness, and ambitions? Or because we are<br />
snobs, and love an hierarchical society? Or perhaps, though<br />
citizens of a monarchy, we are not the Queen's men and women,<br />
and therefore think that the best way to get rid of monarchy<br />
is to vulgarise the Crown, to treat the Royal Family as if<br />
they were stars in a public show, to deny them any private<br />
life and probe into their real or imaginary emotional experiences,<br />
to remove the mystery of monarchy, to destroy the swift<br />
impulse in the loyal heart when the Queen passes by, to make<br />
all commonplace when the national symbol of the Crown should<br />
and must have a moving splendour of its own.<br />
4e British people, not discouraged by Republican<br />
examples, have a deep instinct for the monarchy. This instinct<br />
oddly enough, does not depend upon the personal<br />
character and popularity of the Monarch alone. The Georgian<br />
era provided some evidence that the people of Britain thought<br />
it a better thing to have an indifferent or incompetent King<br />
( or even Regent) than no King at all. Queen Victoria and King<br />
Edward VII had varying popular fortunes, not necessarily for<br />
the same reasons. The great King George V came to the throne amid<br />
murmured and sometimes loudly spoken criticism. He survived<br />
both, and a great war, and grew into the hearts of his people.<br />
When the war was over, a great stirring began, which transformed<br />
the conception of Empire and produced the new Dominion<br />
Status and the Statute of dJstminstor. The King shrewdly saw<br />
the implications. He accommodated himself to the new Democracy<br />
and the new Commonwealth. He saw vividly the technical<br />
limitations on his own official power, but with great penetration<br />
saw that his own personal influence and experience were<br />
not irrelevant. He secured the friendship of Tory and<br />
Socialist alike. He on occasion affected their conduct without<br />
assertion of prerogative. He lived to be a much loved man,<br />
with a much loved wife. He asserted few or no rights, but he<br />
was nevertheless the centre of constitutional government. He<br />
was, in my opinion, the first great Constitutional Monarch.<br />
His relationship to his subjects will now be recalled<br />
by fewer and fewer people, for he died in 1936. But I will<br />
recount two stories, at first hand, which may serve to illustrate<br />
my text. 1935 was the year of his Jubilee. His Prime Ministers<br />
had gathered from around the world. The South African<br />
Prime Minister was the celebrated and co-itroversial Hertzog,<br />
by history and conviction a Republican, not by nature or experience<br />
disposed to love the British. I had various discussions<br />
with Hertzog ( I was present as Attorney-General of<br />
Australia) about the conflict between my own conception of the<br />
Crown as a single indivisible unifying element and his own<br />
quite different ideas. I respected and admired Hertzog very<br />
much; he was a man of great courtesy and of great integrity.<br />
But I wondered what he would do on the great day rhen the<br />
Prime Ministers were to attend at St. James's Palance to present<br />
their loyal addresses to the King and the Queen.<br />
Hortzog was immediately preceded by my o-wn Prime<br />
Minister, J. A. Lyons, a clear King's man, who spoke movingly,<br />
and, as always, with simplicity and charm.<br />
Hertzog came next. He had seen something of the </p>
<p>King and the Queen. He had fallen under their influence, and<br />
had learned to regard them with affection. To my groat joy he<br />
began by saying:-" It is my pleasure and honour to present to Your<br />
Majesty and" ( with an old-world bow) " to Her Majesty<br />
the Queen, the loyal homage of the whole of the people<br />
of South Africa."<br />
It vas an unforgettable moment. For the time, at<br />
luast, history was being written.<br />
My second story is of a much more homely kind. I<br />
went to have a haircut at a little barber's shop up an alley<br />
off the Strand. The barber was a museum piece, with a friendly<br />
manner and a fine quiff of hair fiLling over one side of his<br />
forehead. Naturally, he did not know me from Adam, and spoke<br />
as he thought. Brandishing the cutting implements of his<br />
trade, he said:-" Did you see the procession to St. Paul's yesterday,<br />
Sir?" I had. " Did you notice what a lovely day it was?"<br />
I did. " You can't tell me God didn't have a hand in that<br />
Sir!"' I agreed. And then I said, may I be forgiveh, " Do<br />
you believe in all this royalty bu inoss?" It was a deliberately<br />
discouraging question, but the answer was<br />
superb. " Jell, you see, it's like this. Jfhen I knock off<br />
work, I go up to a pub in Holborn, and have a couple of<br />
pints with some of my friends. Je argue about a lot of<br />
things, but we're all for the King!"<br />
By the force of his own personality George V did much<br />
to preserve the true significance of the Crown and to make his<br />
many millions of subjects think of the Crown, not as an obstacle<br />
to democracy but as a living element in it. This example was<br />
superbly followed by King Goerve VI and his great Queen, and,<br />
of course, by our Sovereign Lady of today.<br />
Does our great good fortune, to which most of us have<br />
become accustomed during our adult lives, mean that we are for<br />
the Crown because of the personal quality of its wearer, and<br />
that one misfortune could destroy it? I hope not, and I believe<br />
not. Allegiance to the Crown will remain, intangible,<br />
not susceptible of legal definition, the most profound of all<br />
the unifying influences for the Crown dominions.<br />
But, even for those Commonwealth countries which are<br />
not within the allegiance, the Crown has, I believe, more than<br />
a mere symbolism of friendly association. Last week, the<br />
Prime Ministers met in London, Monarchists and Republicans. In<br />
the past, they have always met in London. This is not just because<br />
London is a convenient meeting place. It is, indeed, not<br />
the most convenient place for those who come, as I do, from the<br />
far corners of the earth. But London is at the heart of world<br />
affairs. The tides of thought and of international relations<br />
beat strongly, even if sometimes unsuccessfully, on the shores<br />
of ' Whitehall and Westminster. But, more significantly, London<br />
is where the Queen is. Some place or places other than London<br />
may in future be chosen; but only, I hope, if the Queen is<br />
there. For when a Republican Prime Minister clasps hands with<br />
the Quuen, I warrant that he sees her as no theoretical emblem,<br />
but as something special for him and his country.<br />
I have spoken at some length about the Crown, end have<br />
suggested that while its place among the Crown Dominions remains<br />
unaltered and vital, its broad significance for the Commonwealth<br />
at large has been changed and qualified. WJe have seen what has<br />
happened to the other elements of 1926 and 1930.<br />
Under all these circumstances, what are the operative </p>
<p>8,<br />
factors which have continued to make the Commonwealth, in spite<br />
of all its structural changes, a spucial association of nations<br />
with a mutual relationship which distinguishes it from other<br />
world groups? MY answer is that the sense of community between the<br />
Crown members and the Republican members if preserved and'fostered,<br />
not only by the great things we have in common, such as<br />
our desire for peace and freedom and resistance to aggression,<br />
( for these ideas we share with many others), but also by our<br />
frequent meetings and personal exchanges at Prime Ministers'<br />
Conferences, at meetings of Trade or Finance Ministers, in<br />
committees of officials, and in the Commonwealth Parliamentary<br />
Association. On all such occasions we may meet as debaters or<br />
contestants, but we meet in a special atmosphere which induces<br />
both frankness and friendliness; with a feeling that we have a<br />
special relationship of mutual respect and common interest. I<br />
have I think a longer experience of Prime Ministers' Conferences<br />
than most men. I will therefore speak about them in particular,<br />
though I could with great advantage expand upon the<br />
growing significance of the Parliamentary Association. But I<br />
speak of those meetings of Prime Ministers which I know so well,<br />
because I believe them to be almost the greatest element in the<br />
" workability" and special character of the modern Commonwealth.<br />
When we meet, we have no set agenda. ' Jo move no<br />
resolutions, and we have never cast votes. But we learn a great<br />
deal about the world's problems and : our relations to them. The<br />
intolerance engendered by long-range and imperfect knowledge is<br />
tempered. From time to time, as I iell know from experionco,<br />
we influence each other's thinking, without the discords of public<br />
controversy. ' Io h. ve, after all, some community of history<br />
and ideas. Jo no longer aim at producing a common foreign<br />
policy, nor do we any longer find ourselves able to envisage<br />
the Commonwealth as a " world power". But if we can achieve a<br />
common philosophical approach to world problems, there is life<br />
and virtue in our deliberations,<br />
We do not meet as a tribunal, to sit in judgment upon<br />
each other, or to ventilate and pass upon intra-Commonwealth<br />
issues. Je are not a super-state.<br />
During the recent tragic episodes in South Africa,<br />
there were not wanting suggestions that South Airica.. culd be<br />
expelled presumably by majority vote from the Commonwealth.<br />
Any such suggestion, in my opinion, misconceived the nature of<br />
our association. iJe do not deal with the domestic political<br />
policies of any one of us, for we know that political policies<br />
come or go with governments, and that we are not concerned with<br />
governments and their policies so much as we are with nations<br />
and their peoples. If we ever thought of expelling a member<br />
nation of the Commonwealth it would, I hope, be because we<br />
believed that in the general interests of the Commonwealth that<br />
nation as a nation was not fit to be our associate.<br />
The Prime Ministers' Conference would break up in<br />
disorder and the new Commonwealth would disintegrate if we<br />
affected to discuss and decide what we thought to be the proper<br />
measure of democracy in our various countries; whether particular<br />
groups should or should not have the vote; whether oppositions<br />
should be respected; whether a P-rliament should control<br />
the Executive. On all such matters, " autonomous" or independunt"<br />
nations must have the right to manage their own affairs in<br />
their own way. . Jo are not a court. e are brothers in a special<br />
international family. [ e have done well so far because we have<br />
nurtured our loments of unity with loving care and have sought<br />
to resolve our differences in a friendly and mutually helpful<br />
way. There is, in brief, a quality of intimacy about our </p>
<p>meetings which relegates the protocol of diplomacy to its proper<br />
place; induc. s personal friendships; and enables us, between<br />
conferences, to communicate with each other without hesitation<br />
or reserve. I know of no other association ihich possesses these<br />
attributes to anything like the same degree. When we meet, we<br />
are much more than a group of individuals; we are conscious of<br />
the fact that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br />
Contrast all this with the United Nations, where large<br />
numbers of delegates to the Assembly meet, of necessity. almost<br />
as strangers; ihere, of necessity, resolutions are tabled,<br />
amendments drafted, votes canvassed, and majority decisions<br />
taken; where the inevitable bargaining tends to weaken mutual<br />
trust. These things must be so in great multi-national meetings,<br />
where there are no old ties of friendship to preserve, and no<br />
great or comprehensive tradition of well-remembered and wellloved<br />
association in peace and in war.<br />
Do you feel that this approach is sentimental? I<br />
admit it. Indeed, what I have just been saying amounts to this;<br />
that it is a cynical error to suppose that when the first Republic<br />
entered the Commonwealth door the old sentiment flew out<br />
of the window. ' 4 still have an attachment to each other which<br />
none of us would deny. That is why we see in our newly independent<br />
nations such eagerness to remain in the Commonwealth.<br />
That is why I can sit in a Prime Ministers' Conference and feel<br />
instantly as :. uch at home as if I were sitting in my own Cabinet.<br />
Last week some of the principles I have recalled were<br />
under great strain.<br />
We were not discussing the tragic incident of Sharpeville,<br />
for post-war history has seen many bitter events arising<br />
from religious or political or racial hostilities in many lands.<br />
But E1Speville had brought up into the public mind the whole<br />
p robiums of apartheid, or separate development of separate races<br />
within the one country. In the result, apartheid, which has<br />
been the accepted policy of South African Governments for many<br />
years and has never previously been brought up at a Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference, flared into the news and into debate.<br />
When the Conference began, there was a sharp challenge.<br />
But, quite quickly, we re-affirmed our practice that the domestic<br />
policies of member nations are not matters for debate or<br />
decision by the Conference. Though private and informal talks<br />
occurred, as they were bound to, the practice was confirmed.<br />
In this way, we have passed again through a constitutional<br />
crisis. The highly emotional atmosphore engendered by<br />
the South African controversy, though it is intelligible, is not<br />
conducive either to clear thought or to objective judgment. But<br />
the point to be made is that the Prime Ministers' Conforence is<br />
not a quasi-judicial body. Nor is it a Committee of the United<br />
Nations. Nor is it under some duty to discipline its own members<br />
into obedience to the Charter of the United Nations,<br />
These ideas are not novel; they are sanctioned by<br />
past practice. I take leave to mention an issue which arose nine<br />
years ago over the India-Pakistan difference regarding Kashmir;<br />
a difference as yet unresolved. The then Prime Minister of<br />
Pakistan, Liquat Ali Khan, wanted Kashmir to be listed for the<br />
then approaching Prime Ministers' Conference. The Prime Minister<br />
of the United Kingdom, Mr. Attlee ( as he then was) acted<br />
upon the unwritten rule that the Conference was not a tribunal<br />
and refused. Mr. Nehru concurred. Mr. Liquat Ali Khan ultimately<br />
came to London when it had been agreed that private and<br />
voluntary conversations could occur, not as part of the Conference<br />
procedures but as incidental to the fact that Prime </p>
<p>Ministers would be meeting in London and wrould be privately<br />
available to each other. Private talks occurred. They related<br />
to a matter of considerable international importance, but they<br />
formed no part of the official record,<br />
As our numbers incruase, and the close personal contact<br />
which we now enjoy becomes less close and less personal, we<br />
will encounter dangers which we must be careful to avert.<br />
I state my oin faith in this way.<br />
Jo of the Commonwealth are no longer a single integrated<br />
structure, wlith a common foundation and a powerful organic<br />
association. Our strength is that re meet as equals, without<br />
vote or lobby; we speak to each other with freedom and friendli<br />
-ness; we seek to understand each other, but we do not sit in<br />
judgment on each other; we take an interest in each other but<br />
respect the fact that each member has achieved self-government;<br />
hence we seek to co-operate with each other but not to invade<br />
the sovereignty of each other. / Je seok agreement on purpose<br />
and principle, but leave to each the decision on how to achieve<br />
or apply them. For, though so much has changed, the nations of the<br />
Commonwealth remain " autonomous" and " freely associated". We<br />
derive strength from the knowledge that we are not like other<br />
associations, that our rules may be unwritten but our true relations<br />
written into our hearts and consciousness,.<br />
I conclude with two mercifully brief homilies.<br />
The first is this. In the old Commonwealth, and under<br />
the Crown, the great traditional expression of constitutional<br />
monarchy wasParliamentary self-government. So much ras this<br />
" bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh" that we have been<br />
tempted to regard it as an essential part of the Commonwealth<br />
inheritance. Most of us have, in post-prandial speeches, succumbed<br />
to the temptation. But, Is vu look back and around us,<br />
is this true? Our British institutions of democracy hove<br />
grown from the soil, over long centuris. But they cannot be<br />
easily transplanted. Modern history proves this. They oere tried, and<br />
failed, in Russia , nd in Germany. They have had a chequered<br />
history in France. They suffered a long occlusion in Italy.<br />
They have been swept aside, by force majoureo in the hi. storic<br />
countries of Middle Europe. They do not exist in Continental<br />
China. They are now struggling to life in Japan. hat of tbe<br />
new Commonwealth countries? If we survey Commonwealth mankind<br />
from Ghana to Malaya, e will begin to understand that one of<br />
the great implications of independent nationhood is that when<br />
people win to self-government they choose or permit their orwn<br />
forms of government. It is one of the many errors of modern<br />
emotional thinking, or of emotion at any rate, to believe that<br />
when a former colony becomes free of foreign rule, all that<br />
needs to be said is " Now, elect your own Pa. rliamont, have a<br />
Government and an Opposition, make your la rs democratically,<br />
and all will be well"<br />
The truth, as I see it, is that each new Comiionwealth<br />
country, as it achieves complete independence, tends to begin<br />
its adventure by developing a higher degree of executive authority<br />
at the centre, and correspondingly a lower degree of parliamentary<br />
power, than we are accustomed to. Parliaeintary<br />
government is not an artificial creation . ihich can be established<br />
in a new country by a mere act of law. If it tends, . rith us, to<br />
give expression and protection to individual rights, that is<br />
because we have a passion for individual freedom, of which Parliament<br />
has become the expression and the guarantee. The historic<br />
movement has been, in the famous phrase, " from status to </p>
<p>11.<br />
contract". Our parliamentary system is based upon the free<br />
individual. If we occasionally respect our governments, and<br />
always, or almost always, obey the laws passed by Parliament,<br />
it is because the body of citizens, with equal political rights,<br />
have chosen our ministers and legislators, and can dismiss<br />
them; though this, to one who has survived five successive<br />
elections, is a sobering reflection.<br />
I turn to my second homily.<br />
I have spoken about " unity in diversity', and have<br />
dwelt at some length and with some emphasis upon the increased<br />
diversity which has arisen since 1930. It is not to be thought<br />
from this emphasis that I think diversity a bad thing. It is,<br />
on the contrary, as good constitutionally as it is agriculturally.<br />
The old British Empire had groat diversities of institutions,<br />
creed, tradition, culture, and race, The new Commonwealth<br />
has, as we have seen, added some of its own. Such diversities,<br />
so long as they give rise to different points of view<br />
and promote the frankest exchanges of opinion, and do not give<br />
rise to hatreds, are good. Properly dealt with, they promote<br />
true friendship and co-operation by widening the boundaries of<br />
understanding and tolerance and serving to create a sense of<br />
the interdependence of independent minds and nations! A sound<br />
individualism is not anarchical, but democratic.<br />
As a wise observer said to me recently " If organic<br />
unity in the old sense is gole, a new unity must be sought for.<br />
It cannot be achieved in a hurry, any more than its predecessor<br />
was". In truth, and in the world in which we live, absolute<br />
independence, as some speak of it, is impossible. Je all<br />
value its form, and do our best to achieve its substance, But<br />
without economic aid, technical assistance, foreign capital, and<br />
in most cases military or material alliancues there can be few,<br />
if any nations in the world that could hope to maintain their<br />
indopendonce. If we are to enjoy the co-operation and respect of<br />
each other, we must got to know each other bettor, be more<br />
tolerant of what to us are strange ideas, bury old prejudices,<br />
and seek to achieve that understanding intimacy which recognises<br />
differences but learns how to live with them,<br />
The most remarkable expression of this vital human<br />
truth is our Commonwealth of Nations, changed and changing, but,<br />
so long as we see clearly, destined to endure, </p>
