PRIMES MAINISTE<br />
FOR PRESS 24 OCTOBER 1976<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This week's announcement of a 2.2. percent increase in the<br />
Consumer Price Index for the September quarter is welcome<br />
news for Australia.<br />
The figures mean that our annual rate of inflation is coming<br />
down steadily.<br />
Looking at the trend since the beginning of the year, the<br />
figures present a clear perspective of how the government's<br />
economic policies are working in the continuing fight<br />
against inflation.<br />
The 2.2. percent increase in the September quarter compares<br />
with a 2.5 percent increase in the previous quarter and a<br />
percent increase for the March quarter.<br />
Leaving aside the effects of Medibank on the index for the<br />
September quarter last year, the figures show that the 2.2<br />
percent increase in the lowest for 3 years.<br />
This is an encouraging trend. It must be seen, however,<br />
as only a trend.<br />
Inflation still is far too high. Reduction of inflation<br />
still is at the core of our economic recovery. We still have<br />
a long and hard road ahead before inflation is beaten.<br />
I do not want to over-play the significance of the latest<br />
Consumer Price Index figures. I do believe, however, that<br />
they show to the electorate that our strategy we have<br />
consistently pursued is right for Australia.<br />
One aspect of this quarter's CPI which is especially significant<br />
is the sharp reduction in non-food prices.<br />
Prices in this area dropped from 3.3. percent to 1.9 percent<br />
in the three month period.<br />
This move in the non-food area is important as it is this<br />
index that generally retards any reduction in the CPI. / 2 </p>
<p>In many ways, the moves in the non-food area are<br />
a more accurate measure of the inflationary pressures<br />
in the economy as food prices tend to be cyclical<br />
and are frequently at the mercy of seasonal conditions.<br />
Clearly then, this quite sharp reduction in the non-food<br />
price index is unmistakable evidence of what happens<br />
to prices during periods of wage moderation and<br />
wage stability.<br />
This move helps to highlight the point that our arguments<br />
to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and also<br />
to the ' trade union movement on the need for wage restraint<br />
are the right arguments. They are working.<br />
I1 believe our stand on this crucial question of wages<br />
has been completely central to this down-ward move in the<br />
overall annual rate of inflation in Australia.<br />
I believe that the foundations for a sound, sustainable<br />
recovery in Australia's economic climate and for a recovery<br />
in the unemployment situation are now emerging.<br />
The task ahead, however, is still considerable.<br />
For instance,, the Consumer Price Index for the December<br />
quarter will be affected by the inclusion of non-recurring<br />
Medibank costs.<br />
There will be some people who will argue for short-term<br />
political reasons that this December quarter figure means<br />
that the Government's strategy will be failing.<br />
This view will not be accepted by Australians who can now judge<br />
for themselves that our measures are working, and that our fight<br />
against inflation is moving strongly forward.<br />
Australians know that our policies to combat inflation have<br />
been carried out with strength and resolve.<br />
Our policies have been planned and implemented over the past<br />
ten months in a consistent and coherent manner. We have not<br />
strayed from the course we believe to be right. We will not.<br />
falter in our resolve to maintain our promise to the<br />
Australian people to beat inflation and to get the country<br />
moving forward again. 000000000 </p>
