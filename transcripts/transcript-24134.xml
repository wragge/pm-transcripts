    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ground was broken today on the first major road upgrade for the new Western Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek.</p>
<p>Work is now underway on stage one of the $509 million Bringelly Road upgrade, the first upgrade in a $3.6 billionÂ package to provide essential road infrastructure that will create jobs, reduce congestion and improve safety for all road users.</p>
<p>The investment by the Commonwealth and NSW Governments will help build a stronger and more prosperous Western Sydney by helping businesses within the South West Growth Centre to capitalise on the economic gains from developing a new Western Sydney airport.<br />
Â </p>
<p>Bringelly Road will be widened to two lanes in each direction for 5.7 kilometres with three lanes between the Upper Canal and Eastwood Road. Building tenders will soon beÂ calledÂ for the 4.3 kilometre section from King Street to The Northern Road.</p>
<p>The upgrade will create more than 400 jobs while about 4,000 additional jobs will be generated by the time the airport opens.</p>
<p>The NSW Government progressed planning on upgrades including Bringelly Road before a decision was taken to build a new airport, which helped ensure that the Commonwealth was well placed to commit to investing in this region.</p>
<p>Planning is progressing for the 31 kilometre, $1.6 billion upgrade of The Northern Road and the 14 kilometre, $1.3 billion four lane motorway between the M7 Motorway and The Northern Road.</p>
<p>These projects are about ensuring vital road infrastructure is in place ahead of the airportâs opening, expected towards the end of this decade.</p>
<p>Tenders will be invited shortly to build the first successful projects as part of the $200 million Local Roads Package which aims toÂ improve the performance of the local road network around the future airport site.</p>
<p>Local road upgrades funded so far include:</p>
<ul><li>$17.5 million to Campbelltown City Council to upgrade Eagle Vale Drive,</li>
<li>$5.8 million to Fairfield City Council to upgrade intersections on the Cumberland Highway,</li>
<li>$5.7 million to Fairfield City Council to upgrade Wetherill Street,</li>
<li>$2.3 million to Camden Council to develop and upgrade the Argyle St/Camden Valley Way Corridor.</li>
</ul><p>Our plan to develop infrastructure in this part of Western Sydney will transform the regionâs economy and help make these communities better places to live and do business.</p>
