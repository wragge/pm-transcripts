WMnARGOD UNTIL DEL-TvERY: PRIME MIT STEZ<br />
ADDRESS AT TOWiISViLIX REFEREWU<br />
This is thelatweofte ef rn'capin Thopin-ls<br />
show that in every State, thpre, ir significant support for the<br />
referendums. The polls show that in Queensland, there is a solid<br />
majority yes vote on all four questions, notwithst.;-ding the<br />
expensive campaign by the State Government. This is not surprising.<br />
The four referendum proposals are sensible, just and well considered<br />
refomns. They will strengthen our constitution, a constitution of<br />
which we may-all be justly proud. The founding fathers carefully<br />
provided us with the means to make necessary changes.<br />
They specifically built into the Constitution a mechanism for an ndix<br />
it, To en~ sure that the Constitution remains a livinig reality,<br />
continuing to meet changing needs.<br />
In the referendums on Satorday we shall all ha. ve t cbh=-e -to<br />
contribute to timely and necessary constitutional reform. Quinsi; W<br />
have traditionally taken a leading role ' in coilstitutiona. l reform.<br />
Queensland h~ as voted in favour of 18 of thd 32 refefndums since<br />
Federation. I feel confident that by Saturday evening, that figure<br />
will be increased to 22.<br />
The reason these referendum proposals are being put to you is that<br />
they are fair and necessary, and because they were considered and<br />
endorsed by the H~ obart Constitutional Convention. At which all<br />
the Statea the Commonwealth and local Goveranment were represented.<br />
The Convention was initiated by a State Government, by the Victorian<br />
Liberal Government under Sir Henry Bolte, a stronger anti-centralist<br />
could not be asked JCor. The' Hobart Convent-ion was dominated by the<br />
States which had 72 of the 92 votes. It passed the principles of all<br />
four referendum proposals over-Whelm~ ingly.<br />
The proposals have the support of all major federal political<br />
parties. The four proposals are * also distinguished by a nuzber-of<br />
special features, N~ one of them seek to increase the power of the<br />
Coimonwealth, none will weaken the powers of the States or the<br />
Senate, none iaeek-s miore power for politiciauis.<br />
If the four referendums are passed, the balance of powers between<br />
the Commonwealth and the States will remain unaltered. This is why,<br />
Of course, thei' State dominated constitutionatl convention supported<br />
all four propo~ 3als. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
There have been attempts to mislead voters by Port-raying the<br />
referendum proposals as in some way an attack on the States or<br />
the Senate. Nothing could be fuzrther from tile truth. If there<br />
were any truth-ln it, th4 proposals would never have received the<br />
support of the States at Hobart. And they would not have received<br />
the support of Sir Gordon chalke, Dam~ Annabelle Rardd-n and Charles<br />
Aclermann. They would niot have the support of the National Party Organisation<br />
in Queensland. We deoplore the Queensland Goverrnents use of public<br />
money to run an intensive advertising campaign against the<br />
referendum. The A. B. C. provides equal time for publivising both sides of the<br />
case. Two hours for the yes case to be put and two. hours<br />
for advocates of the no case to put their views. No Federal funds<br />
are being spent on advertising the yes case.<br />
Yet the Queensland Government is spending huge amounts of taxpayers<br />
funds to mount an advertising campaign which qrosvly distorts the<br />
facts. We all know that. Job-Bjelke-Petersen put the iritercsts of<br />
Queensland first when he fought against the Labor Government's<br />
attempts to invade areas of States rights. And we applaud thiis.<br />
But his opposition to these referendums is completely urnjustified.'<br />
The only way it can be explained is that having onoe, justifiably,<br />
got on the anti-Canberra horse be finds it difficult to got off,<br />
and this is tragic.<br />
These referendums are our opportunity to ensure that the Corstitutic<br />
which we are all rightly proud of is strengthened and continues to<br />
serve the needs of our nation.<br />
The four proposals on which we shall be voting ne Saturday are<br />
thewse. First, that elections for the Senate and Rouse of<br />
Representatives shouldbeheld simultaneously. Thbis proposal was<br />
supported unanimously at the Convention. Those in favour included<br />
Mr. Knox, Mr Hewitt, sir. Lickiss, Mr. Porter, Sir Charles Court,<br />
and significantly Mir. Bjelke-Petersen.<br />
Every representative of the Quecnsland Goverrnment supported<br />
the sismultaneous elections prooosa. just 7 mloths ago. It is a<br />
matter of regret that those deiegates have reversed their position.<br />
Because it is simply coi= Kon sense that both elections should be<br />
held at the same timze.<br />
This proposal means you will not have to vote in as many rederal<br />
elections.-That you will only have to vote in a Federal election whoen<br />
you have to choose Australia's Governmen~ t. Simultaneous elections<br />
protect the less populous states like Queensland.<br />
Whe * n there are separate elections for tho Ylouse of * Representatives,<br />
political leaders will be temptod to confine their campaigin to<br />
New South Wales and Victoria, which bave over 60 per cent of the<br />
seats. </p>
<p>3-<br />
But if there is at the time an election for the Senate, in wh ich<br />
all States are equally r epr sented. The campaign must be<br />
vigorously pursued in to' a ! States. Rederal politicians will have<br />
to be more responsive to th6' wishes of people in the less populous<br />
States.-It is sometimes said that sim4.3 ane selections can be achieved<br />
by bringing the House of Reprjsr: t eseeoie owadt<br />
coincide with that of the Sen te.~-<br />
Unless the Cons titu*_. on is cha'geci the only way to bring the<br />
elections together would be reeatedly to cut short the term of<br />
the House of Representatives, ' T he three year term is however,<br />
already relatively short, one. 1of ti-#\ shortest parliamentary terms<br />
in the democratic world. Fui4tber-educing it would damage -good<br />
Governmnent.<br />
Most importantly, this proposal will mnaintain anid strengthen the<br />
Senate and its capacity to protect the States. I tell you in all<br />
seriousness that if this proposal. is not passed, the future<br />
of the Senat~ e will ul1tinately be put in jeopardy.<br />
it was an accident that in 1975 there were bills enabling the<br />
Governor-General to dissolve both Houses and make them both face<br />
the people. Had Senators not been able to face the people themselves<br />
so that their actions might be judged, a number of Senators<br />
would not have agreed to block supply.<br />
1, myself, would nevem have sought the blocking of supply from<br />
a Senate that would not itself have also faced the people of<br />
Australia. The Senate's powers are great, and anyone who wants them to remain<br />
a livinPg reality will campaign for simultaneous elections and<br />
vote for them on Saturday week.<br />
Por unless the present situation is changed, I can foresee two<br />
alternative consequences. The Senate might refuse to check a<br />
bad government unless there happened to exist the circumstances<br />
which would permit a double dissolution.<br />
Alternatively if Senators were. to make the House of Representatives<br />
go to an election without facing the people thems~ ives, then there<br />
would be a public outcry against the Senate which could lead to<br />
the Senate's powers being restricted or abolished. Either of these<br />
alternatives would be bad for democratic Government, bad for the<br />
States and bad for Australia. That is why it is important that<br />
this referendum be passed.<br />
The second referendum proposal is that whenever a Senalordies or<br />
resigns, he will be replaced, for the remainder of his, termi of<br />
office, by a mempber of dhe same party. This will gua-rantee that your<br />
choice of parties for the Senate cannot be altered by accident or<br />
desig-n. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
This will guarantee that your choice of parties for the Senate<br />
cannot be altered by accident or design. Under the Constitution<br />
as it now stands, a Senate vacancy can con-pltely change<br />
the party balance.<br />
It is fundamental to our democracy that only the people should<br />
determine the balance of the parties in the Senate. And I<br />
need hardly repeat that it is vital to Queensland that it be<br />
inrpossible for any Government to tamnper withl the party balance in<br />
the Senate. For it is in the Senate that the less populous States<br />
have the strongest vote.<br />
The importance of this cannot be understated, and the examiple<br />
Evan Adermann put to me last night brings it home.<br />
He often travels home from Canberra in the same aeroplane as almost<br />
all the Queensland Senators. What would happen he asked if the<br />
aeroplane were to be involved in-a tragic accident? Would the<br />
people of Queensland, of any State, be content to make the Party<br />
affiliation of their Sunators depend on some State Governmart<br />
observing a conventirn that might be breached by considerations<br />
of political advantage.<br />
Constitutiong are supposed to na] e laws for this sort of situation.<br />
Not allow i't to depend on the political calculations of State<br />
Governments. Once this referendum proposal is accepted the<br />
peoples choice will be preservad until they have an opportunity<br />
to make another choice, at the next election.<br />
The third referendum proposal, is that voters in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and Northern Territory should have a vote in<br />
all future refcca-ndums.<br />
This is a fundamental right all other Australians have.<br />
I know of no rational or . reason able argument for denying<br />
territorial voters this basic right.<br />
TerrItorial voters have the smme obligations as other Auistralians.<br />
They pay tayxes, they are obliged to observe the laws of the<br />
Commonwealth, they vote for Members of Parliament, the outcome<br />
Of refe-rendu~ zs affect them as much as they do other Australians.<br />
All Liberal and National Party from the legislative<br />
assewnblAes in both. territories unanimously support this referendum<br />
and ask for our support, I believe we should give them that support.<br />
The fourth and final referendum proposal, is to set a retiring age<br />
for Federal Justices. High Court Justices would retire at seventy<br />
and the retiremant acve for other Federal Court Judgjes would be<br />
determined by Parliament.<br />
The propova-1 does not affect the terms of Judqe5 already ap'pointed<br />
td the bench. Mst jobs have retirement ages, and for good reason.<br />
Judges are as affected by old age as the rest of u1s.<br />
It is only fair that after thle age of seventy responsibility should<br />
be handed over to younger people. </p>
<p>This is even more important now that the new system of Federal<br />
Fanily Courts have been set up. All Queensland State Judges are<br />
subject to a retiring age of seventy. That system has worked<br />
well in this State, and would work well in Federal Courts.<br />
All four referendum proposals are fair just and reasonable.<br />
They meet all the requirements for success. They have been<br />
extensively considered by representatives of all the States, they<br />
have the support of all major Federal Parties, they do not involve<br />
morc power for Canberra, they will make the Constitution work<br />
better. If you agree with me that it is vital that all four referendums<br />
should be passed on Saturday, I ask you in these few remaining<br />
days to play your part in this campaign.<br />
Talk to your friends, explain to them that these four simple<br />
propositions are necessaxy fair and just and give us. your active<br />
support on polling day.<br />
If we all do this, then the referendums will be passed and we<br />
will have a Constitution which serves Australia's needs more<br />
effectively. o00o </p>
