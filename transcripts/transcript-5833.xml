FOR MEDIA. TUESDAY, 15 JUNE 1,982<br />
FALKLAND ISLANDS CEASEFIRE<br />
The Government-warmly welcomes reports of an informal<br />
ceasef irE! having been reached in the Falkland Islands.-<br />
It is hoped that this will end the armed conflict and<br />
tragic loss of life that has occurred during the<br />
Falklands; dispute. We await with interest the terms<br />
of the arrangements being set in place. Certainly, we<br />
hope that: the ceasefire will lead to the early withdrawal<br />
of all Argentine forces from the Falkland Islands.<br />
We look forward to an early end to all hostilities in<br />
the South Atlantic.<br />
The Gover-nment congratulates Mrs Thatcher and her<br />
Government and the British armed forces on their successful<br />
rebuttal of Argentina's unprovoked aggression in the<br />
Falkland Islands and the upholding of the principle that<br />
unprovoked use of force should not be allowed to go<br />
unchecked. 0o000oo0 </p>
