THIS PARTNERSHIP MUST NOT BE TAKENI FOR GRANTED. IT IS<br />

THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE TODAY. THE LABOR GOVERNMENT IS<br />
DEDICATED TO SECURING WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF RENEWED ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH A RIGHTFUL SHARE FOR THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OF<br />
AUSTRALIA OF THAT GROWTH, ONLY A HEALTHY AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY<br />
WILL PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT AND GOOD STANDARDS OF LIVING FOR<br />
ALL ITS PEOPLE, AND A PROPER DISTRIBUTION OF THE FRUITS OF<br />
GROWTH IN THIS GREAT NATION. THE COOPERATION AND SUPPORT<br />

UNLESS WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN FORGING A LONG TERM COMMITMENT<br />
BY ALL TO SUCH AN APPROACH THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE WE WILL BE<br />
ABLE TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINED RECOVERY, IMPROVE LIVING STANDARDS<br />
OR MAKE ANY REAL PROGRESS IN CUTTING INTO THE UNACCEPTABLY<br />
LONG QUEUES OF THE UNEMPLOYED,<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS I BELIE VE ON THE RIGHT TRACK, LAST WEEK'S<br />
WELCOME DECISION BY THE SAVINGS BANKS TO CUT HOME LOAN<br />
INTEREST RATES WAS A CLEAR SIGN THAT THE MARKET HAS CONFIDENCE<br />
IN THE GOVERNMENT'/ S OVERALL ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND PARTICULARLY<br />
THE 1983-84 BUDGET,<br />
NHE ACCORD ON PRICES AND INCOMES BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
PARTY AND THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT WAS AN ACHIEVEMENT OF<br />
HISTORIC PROPORTIONS, IT OFFERED HOPE THAT WE COULD ESCAPE<br />
THE DIVISIVE, CONFRONTATIONIST APPROACHES OF THE PAST, ITS<br />
ACHIEVEMENT SET THE TONE OF CONSULTATION AND COOPERATION<br />
FOR THE NEW LABOR GOVERNMENT. IT IS NOW A CRUCIAL<br />
CORNERSTONE IN THE GOVERNMENT'IS EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERY. THE FRASER GOVERNMENT'S TOTAL RELIANCE ON THE BLUNT<br />
CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS OF CONTRACTIONARY FISCAL AND MONETARY<br />
POLICY GOT US NOWHERE. THE COSTSIN TERMS OF REDUCED ACTIVITY<br />
AND INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT WERE INTOLERABLY HIGH.<br />
THE NEW POLICY APPROACH NOW DEVELOPED OFFERS HOPE WHERE<br />
PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS DESPAIR. WE AIM TO GET AUSTRALIA MOVING<br />
AGA IN. </p>
<p>BY MEANS OF AN EFFECTIVE PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY IT SHOULD<br />
NOW BE POSSIBLE TO SEE CONFLICTING INCOME CLAIMS RESOLVED AT<br />
LOWER LEVELS OF INFLATION THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE CASE.<br />
THIS WILL PROVIDE GREATER SCOPE FOR OUR EXPANSIONARY FISCAL<br />
POLICY AND WILL LEAD TO STRONGER GROWTH IN OUTPUT AND<br />
EMPLOYMENT, AND ULTIMATELY TO IMPROVED LIVING STANDARDS<br />
FOR ALL. THE OPPORTUNITY MUST NOW BE SEIZED TO IMPROVE<br />
AUSTRALIA'IS LONG-TERM GROWTH PERFORMANCE AND TURN<br />
OUR BACK ON THE STAGNATION THAT HAS CHARACTERISED MUCH<br />
OF OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN THE LAST DECADE.<br />
THE ACCORD REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH, THE<br />
UNDERTAKINGS EMBRACED IN IT COVER NOT ONLY PRICES, WAGES AND<br />
NON-WAGE INCOMES BUT ALSO TAXATION AND THE " 1SOCIAL WAGE" THAT<br />
IS., THOSE GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES AFFECTING THE LIVING STANDARDS<br />
OF THE PEOPLE. IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A RANGE OF POLICIES<br />
IN THE AREAS OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATION, HEALTH<br />
INSURANCE, OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY, SOCIAL SECURITY,<br />
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, EDUCATIONAND AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
EMPLOYMENT ALL POLICIES MY GOVERNMENT IS NOW WORKING TO<br />
IMPLEMENT, lHE PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS AND EQU~ ITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO<br />
THE ACCORD. THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME IS A BASIC<br />
OBJECTIVE AND GUIDES THE APPROACH OF BOTH THE ACCORD<br />
AND MY GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>THE LABOR GOVERNMENT DOES NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULT<br />
TASK AHEAD. IT WAS RECOGNISED IN THE ACCORD THAT THERE ARE NO<br />
RAPID SOLUTIONS AND THAT OUR OBJECTIVE OF FULL EMPLOYMENT<br />
CAN ONLY BE REACHED OVER TIME, WE CERTAINLY DO NOT OFFER<br />
MIRACLE CURES. THE ACTU SUBMISSION TO THE RECENT NATIONAL<br />
WAGE CASE WAS RIGHT IN OBSERVING THAT ' I'll. IT WAS NEVER<br />
PERCEIVED THAT ALL THE INDIVIDUAL PROVISIONS, COMMITMENTS,<br />
GOALS IN THE ACCORD WOULD BE ACHIEVED IN THE FIRST TERM<br />
OF OFFICE IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE GRADUALLY<br />
IMPLEMENTED OVER YEARS) NOT MONTHS"<br />
WE HAVE, HOWEVER) MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS.<br />
AT THE HEART OF THE ACCORD IS THE COMMITMENT TO A CENTRALISED<br />
SYSTEM OF WAGE FIXATION WHICH WE BELIEVE IS DESIRABLE FOR<br />
ECONOMIC) EQUITY AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REASONS,<br />
SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH A SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL TO AN<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. ONLY IN THIS MANNER<br />
CAN BETTER WAGES AND CONDITIONS BE ACHIEVED AND SUSTAINED<br />
INTO THE LONGER-TERM,<br />
THE PRINCIPLES OF WAGE FIXATION BfING PURSUED BY THE<br />
GOVERNMENT PROVIDE A BASIS UPON WMICH ALL PARTIES CAN<br />
PARTICIPATE IN AND BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM, WE AIM TO ENSURE<br />
IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF RISING PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY AN<br />
EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF INCREASED COMMUNITY WEALTH. </p>
<p>6.<br />
AT THE NATIONAL WAGE CASE WE SOUGHT TO STIKE A BALANCE<br />
BETWEENSHORT AND LONGER TERM ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
CONSIDERATIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN EFFECTIVE PRICES<br />
AND INCOMES POLICY. ACCORDINGLY WE SUPPORTED FULL INDEXATION<br />
ON A SIX-MONTHLY BASIS, ON THE CONDITION THAT THERE SHOULD<br />
BE NO EXTRA CLAIMS, IT IS THE GOVERNMENT I S FIRM VIEW THAT ANY<br />
UNION NOT PREPARED TO GIVE A COMMITMENT TO NO EXTRA CLAIMS<br />
SHOULD BE DENIED THE NATIONAL WAGE INCREASE. IF SUCH AN<br />
UNDERTAKING IS GIVEN AND LATER BREACHED THIS SHOULD ALSO BE<br />
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN NATIONAL WAGE INCREASES ARE BEING<br />
CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THAT UNION,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ARGUED THAT RATIFICATION OF SECTIONAL<br />
SETTLEMENTS SHOULD BE REFUSED UNLESS THE COMMISSION JUDGES<br />
THAT SPECIAL OR-EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES APPLY. IT IS FOR<br />
THE COMMISSION TO RATIFY SUCH AGREEMENTS. THE GOVERNMENT<br />
FOR ITS PART WOULD NOT SUPPORT ANY INCREASE IN ALLOWANCES<br />
WHICH AMOUNTED TO A DISGUISED WAGE INCREASE. THE GOVERNMENT<br />
WOULD ALSO BE CONCERNED THAT PARTICULAR ATTENTION BE PAID<br />
TO THE POSSIBILITY OF FLOW-ONS. SUCH POSSIBILITIES MUST<br />
AT ALL COSTS BE PREVENTED.<br />
YOU WILL RECALL THAT IT WAS AGREED AT THE SUMMIT THAT IF<br />
RESTRAINT IS TO BE EXERCISED THEN IT SHOULD BE EXERCISED<br />
UNIVERSALLY AND THAT NON-WAGE INCOMES SHOULD NOT BE INCREASED<br />
FASTER THAN MOVEMENTS IN WAGES. WHERE THERE ARE NO<br />
AUTHORITIES DETERMINING FEES, GRO. UPS WERE TO BE ENCOURAGED<br />
TO HAVE THEIR FEES DETERMINED ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS BY MEMBERS<br />
OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION. .71, </p>
<p>7,<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THAT<br />
APPROACH. I HAVE WRITTEN TO MAJOR COMPANIES ASKING THEM TO<br />
EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN SETTING DIVIDENDS AND OTHER NON-WAGE<br />
INCOMES SUCH AS MANAGERIAL SALARIES AND DIRECTORS'I FEES.<br />
THE MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HAS SOUGHT<br />
THE SUPPORT OF PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS FOR INCOME RESTRAINT<br />
AND HAS ENCOURAGED THEM TO USE MEMBERS OF THE CONCILIATION<br />
AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION TO DETERMINE FEES. THE RESPONSE<br />
TO THESE APPEALS HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING. ALMOST ALL OF THOSE<br />
GROUPS HAVE EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT'IS<br />
CALL FOR RESTRAINT.<br />
AT THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT WE WERE ENJOINED TO ESTABLISH<br />
EPAC AND TO DEVISE MACHINERY FOR PRICE SURVEILLANCE. EPAC<br />
IS NOW IN PLACE AND WE EXPECT SOON TO ESTABLISH A PRICES<br />
SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITY TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE VALIDITY<br />
OR OTHERWISE OF PRICE INCREASES BY SELECTED CORPORATIONS<br />
AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, DRAFT LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PREPARED<br />
AND IS TO BE CONSIDERED BY A WORKING PARTY SET UP AFTER THE<br />
SUMMIT. OUR INTENTION IS TO INTRODUCE THIS LEGISLATION INTO<br />
THE PARLIAMENT DURING THE CURRENT FITTINGS. WITH SIMILAR<br />
AIMS IN MIND THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO CONSIDERING STRENGTHENING<br />
TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION TO ENSHRE THAT THERE IS MORE<br />
EFFECTIVE COMPETITION AND LESS OPPORTUNITY FOR ANTICOMPETITIVE<br />
ARRANGEMENTS,<br />
I </p>
<p>YOU ALL APPRECIATE THAT MAINTENANCE OF, OR IMPROVEMENT IN,<br />
LIVING STANDARDS MAY BE SECURED THROUGH PROCESSES OTHER<br />
THAN BY MONEY WAGE INCREASES. IN TAKING OUR DECISIONS ON<br />
THE ECONOMIC MEASURES ANNOUNCED IN MAY, AND MORE RECENTLY<br />
IN THE BUDGET, MY GOVERNMENT SET ABOUT A GENUINE, FUNDAMENTAL<br />
RE-ORDERING OF PRIORITIES, FAIRNESS AND EQUITY WERE<br />
GUIDING, CENTRAL CONSIDERATIONS.<br />
FEATURES OF OUR APPROACH SOME OF WHICH WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED<br />
DIRECTLY AND SOME OF WHICH WE HAVE PROGRESSED IN CO-OPERATION<br />
WITH THE STATES HAVE BEEN:<br />
THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROC-RAM, INVOLVING VERY<br />
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN SPENDING ON JOB CREATION;<br />
ALTOGETHER WE WILL BE SPENDING $ 958 MILLION ON<br />
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAMS IN 1983-84 AN<br />
INCREASE OF 80 PER CENT ON 1982-83 EXPENDITURE.<br />
IN TOTAL WE EXPECT EMPLOYMENT TO GROW BY ABOUT<br />
YO, 000 OVER THE COURSE OF 1983-84;<br />
THE REPLACEMENT OF THE SYETF BY A MORE EFFECTIVE<br />
JOB CREATION AND TRAINING PROGRAM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR;<br />
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW FIRST HOME OWNERS SCHEME<br />
TO ASSIST PEOPLE ON LOW TO MODERATE INCOME INTO<br />
HOME OWNERSHIP;.<br />
MEASURES TO INCREASE_) SIGNIFICANTLY THE AVAILABILITY<br />
OF LOW COST RENTAL ACCOMMODATION; I 119/ 1 </p>
<p>TME DICARE, WHICH WILL MEET THE NEED SET OUT IN THE<br />
ACCORD FOR A SIMPLE, UNIVERSAL AND EQUITABLY FUNDED<br />
SCHEME; INCREASED SPENDING ON ASSISTANCE TO THOSE MOST SEVERELY<br />
AFFECTED BY RECESSION, NOTABLY THE UNEMPLOYED AND<br />
PENSIONERS WITH CHILDREN;<br />
SPECIAL STEPS TAKEN AT THE PREMIERS I CONFERENCE TO<br />
ASSIST THE STATES AT A TIME OF REVENUE DIFFICULTIES<br />
THEREBY REDUCING PRESSURE ON THEM TO RAISE CHARGES<br />
AND TAXES WITHIN THEIR AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY,<br />
WHEN WE REDUCED OUTLAYS OR ASSISTANCE THIS WAS AT THE EXPENSE<br />
OF THE RELATIVELY BETTER OFF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AT<br />
THE EXPENSE OF THOSE WHO COULD AFFORD IT. THE INTRODUCTION<br />
OF AN INCOME AND ASSETS TEST ON PENSION ENTITLEMENTS., INCOME<br />
TESTING ON OVER 70S AGE PENSIONS, TAXATION OF LUMP-SUM<br />
SUPERANNUATION PAYMENTS AND THE TVRMINATION OF THE HOUSING<br />
INTEREST REBATE SYSTEM REFLECT THIS APPROACH,<br />
IWANT TO MAKE PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE MATTER OF TAXATION<br />
OF LUMP-SUM SUPERANNUATION PAYMENTS. THE MEASURES PROPOSED<br />
BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS 19 MAY ECONOMIC STATEMENT AIMED TO<br />
ADDRESS A SITUATION IN WHICH $ 2 BILLION OR SO OF ASSISTANCE<br />
FOR OCCUPATIONAL SUPERANNUATION WAS GOING DISPROPORTIONATELY<br />
TO PEOPLE WHO WERE BETTER OFF AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE<br />
WORK FORCE, 4D .10/ 1 </p>
<p>IT IS TRUE THAT MANY ORDINARY WORKERS ARE AFFECTED TO SOME<br />
EXTENT BY THE SUPERANNUATION CHANGES. BUT A LARGE PART OF THE<br />
WORKFORCE IS NOT, EXCEPT THROUGH THE INCREASED CAPACITY THAT<br />
THE REFORMS WILL PROVIDE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ASSIST THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE, FOR THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED,<br />
SUPERANNUATION WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGHLY FAVOURABLE<br />
TAXATION TREATMENT THROUGH THE ABSENCE OF TAXATION ON<br />
SUPERANNUATION FUNDS AND THE TAXATION DEDUCTION FOR EMPLOYERS<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT IS NOT MATCHED BY IMMEDIATE TAXATION<br />
IN THE HANDS OF THEIR BENEFICIARIES. FOLLOWING THE<br />
MODIFICATIONS ANNOUNCED BEFORE THE BUDGET, AND AFTER<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNIONS, THE SMALLER LUMP SUMS WHICH ARE<br />
MOST IMPORTANT FOR GENUINE RETIREES WHO HAVE BEEN ON<br />
RELATIVELY LOW INCOMES WILL BE TAXED ONLY AT A LOW RATE,<br />
MOREOVERi THE REFORM IS A GRADUAL ONE, AND, ESPECIALLY WHEN<br />
THE EXEMPTION OF EMPLOYEES'I CONTRIBUTIONS IS TAKEN INTO<br />
ACCOUNT, IT WILL BE MANY YEARS BEFORE MANY OTHER THAN THE<br />
MOST PRIVILEGED WORKERS WILL HAVE THEIR LUMP SUMS TAXED<br />
AT MORE THAN 15 PER CENT.-<br />
YOU WOULD ALL APPRECIATE THAT THE TECHNICALITIES INVOLVED IN<br />
IMPLEMENTING A MOVE OF THIS KIND WERE COMPLEX, RECOGNISING<br />
THIS THE GOVERNMENT UNDERtOOK CONSVULTATIONS WITH ALL INTERFSTED<br />
PARTIES, INCLUDING THE ACTU, AIMED AT ADDRESSING REASONABLE<br />
CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY SOME GROUPS, THE RESULTANT CHANGES<br />
ACHIEVED SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE FAIRNESS OF THE<br />
SYSTEM WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE GQVERNMENT'S OVERRIDING<br />
OBJECTIVE. ,. 11 </p>
<p>THE METHOD BY WHICH THIS AGREEMENT WAS ACHIEVED WAS<br />
INDICATIVE OF THE APPROACH OF MY GOVERNMENT. WE ARE PREPARED<br />
TO TAKE ON BOARD REASONABLE, WELL-CONSIDERED SUGCESTIONS<br />
FOR IMPROVED ADMINISTRATION OF OUR POLICIES. IN RETURN,<br />
AND LET ME BE FRANK ABOUT THIS, WE EXPECT ADHERENCE TO<br />
AGREEMENTS ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK. PROGRESSIVE WHITTLINCAWAY<br />
AT THE MARGINS OF OOLICY IS UNACCEPTABLE, NO GOVERNMENT<br />
CAN OPERATE EFFECTIVELY IF IT IS NOT ABLE TO HAVE DECISIONS<br />
ONCE TAKEN STICK. CONCILIATION AND COMPROMISE IS NOT A<br />
RECIPE FOR WEAKNESS. IT IS RATHER THE APPROACH OF AN<br />
OPEN BUT RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT.<br />
ANOTHER ELEMENT IN THE GOVERNMENT'S THINKING ABOUT LUMP<br />
SUM SUPERANNUATION TAXATION WAS THAT THE THEN EXISTING TAX<br />
PROVISIONS FACILITATED TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH<br />
AN EMPLOYEE'IS PAY COULD BE DEFERRED SO AS TO TAKE IN A LUMP<br />
SUM TERMINATION PAYMENT AT THE END OF HIS OR HER EMPLOYMENT<br />
IN A PARTICULAR JOB. CONSIDERATIONS OF EQUITY AND FAIRNESS<br />
MAKE IT IMPERATIVE THAT WE CRACK DbWN ON SUCH PROCEDURES.<br />
ONLY IF WE MOVE AGAINST THIS AND OTHER GLARING EXAMPLES OF<br />
TAX AVOIDANCE AND EVASION CAN WE HAVE ANY HOPE OF ACHIEVING<br />
A MORE JUST, MORE EQUAL, MORE HUMA 4E SOCIETY.<br />
t9<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS STRONGLY COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING A MORE<br />
EQUITABLE AND EFFICIENT TAX SYSTEM, THIS IS NOT ONLY AN<br />
IMPORTANT END IN ITSELF IT IS ALSO A KEY ELEMENT IN THE<br />
BUDGET STRATEGY WE HAVE DEVELOPED. THE THREAT BY THE<br />
OPPOSITION AND SOME OTHERS IN THE SENATE TO THE NEW TAX<br />
RECOUPMENT LEGISLATION IN wRELATION TO BOTTOM OF THE HARBOUR 12/, </p>
<p>12.<br />
SCHEMES PUT AT RISK KEY REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS BUILT ITS BUDGET. THE THREAT POSED TO<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY MUST BE FULLY APPRECIATED FOR WHAT IT IS.<br />
THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO TIGHTEN THINGS UP AND THE<br />
TAXATION REFORMS WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN) MUST SUCCEED IF THOSE<br />
MOST IN NEED ARE NOT GOING TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE SUPPORT<br />
WE OWE THEM. THREATS REEKING OF HYPOCRISY AND SHORT-TERM<br />
OPPORTUNISM, THREATS PUTTING THE INTERESTS OF A HIGHLY<br />
PRIVILEGED FEW ABOVE THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE,<br />
MUST NOT PREVAIL.<br />
FOR THE LONGER-TERM, A THOROUGH-GOING REAPPRAISAL AND<br />
RATIONALISATION OF THE TAX SYSTEM IS NEEDED. THE POINT HAS NOW<br />
BEEN REACHED WHERE A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE ACTUAL AND<br />
POTENTIAL NATIONAL REVENUE BASE MUST BE UNDERTAKEN. WIDELY<br />
BASED COMMUNITY CONSIDERATION OF WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN<br />
TERMS OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY rq TIMELY, THIS WILL<br />
ENlABLE SENSIBLE AND FAIR ' CHANGES TO BE EFFECTED, NOT IN A<br />
PIECEMEAL FASHION, BUT AS PART OF A WELL-CONSIDERED,<br />
PROPERLY INTEGRATED PACKAGE. THE GOVERNMENT IS ASKING EPAC<br />
TO UNDERTAKE AN EARLY EXAMINATION OF THESE MATTERS.<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS POLICY ISSUES ARE AT THE HEART OF THIS<br />
CONGRESS'S PREOCCUPATIONS AND CONCERNS, AS A MATTER OF URGENCY<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS MOVING TO ACHIEVE BADLY NEEDED REFORM IN<br />
THIS AREA. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING REFORMS WHICH WILL<br />
HAVE A LASTING IMPACT AND WHICH WILL LEAD TO A BASIC AND<br />
BENEFICIAL CHANGE IN THE,! ATTITUDE OF ALL PARTIES. </p>
<p>13,<br />
ACCORDINGLY A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS SYSTEM IS TO BE CONDUCTED BY A TOP LEVEL<br />
TRIPARTITE COMMITTEL OF INQUIRY, IT IS A MATTER OF<br />
PARTICULAR PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO ME THAT CHARLIE<br />
FITZGIBBON A GREAT AUSTRALIAN AND RESPECTED LEADER OF<br />
THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT, HAS AGREED TO SERVE AS THE<br />
UNION REPRESENTATIVE ON. THAT COMMITTEE. THE HANCOCK<br />
COMMITTEE REVIEW, WHICH IS LONG OVERDUE, WILL FOCUS<br />
PARTICULARLY ON COMMONWEALTH LAWS RELATING TO THE<br />
PREVENTION AND SETTLEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTESi<br />
COMMONWEALTH LAWS RELATING TO THE RECOGNITION OF UNIONS<br />
AND EMPLOYER ORGANISATIONS, AND THE MANNER IN WHICH<br />
COMMONWEALTH AND STATE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEMS MIGHT<br />
BETTER INTER-RELATE. THE REVIEW WILL REPORT BY MARCH 1985<br />
AND SHOULD PROVrDE THE BASIS FOR CHANGES THAT WILL SET<br />
THE SCENE FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WELL INTO THE FUTURE,<br />
IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ABOLISH THE<br />
PERNICIOUS INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BL REAUj A BODY WHOSE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT BY THE FRASER GOVERNMENT WAS STRONGLY OPPOSED<br />
BY BOTH UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS. WE HAVE ALSO MOVED TO<br />
FACILITATE THE AMALGAMATION OF ORGANISATIONS REGISTERED<br />
UNDER THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT AND WILL BE<br />
INTRODUCING LEGISLATION IN THE CURRENT SITTINGS TO<br />
IMPLEMENT OTHER REFORMS ALREADY ANNOUNCED, INCLUDING A<br />
COMPLEMENTARY COMMONWEALTH-STATE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEM.<br />
WE HAVE REVITALISED THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL LABOUR<br />
CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL AND , TURNED IT INTO A REAL FORUM FOR<br />
CONSULTATION, CONSTRUCTIVPE CRITICISM AND INFORMED DEBATE. Jill, </p>
<p>1' 4.<br />
ON ANOTHER FRONT THE GOVERNMENT PUT A SUBMISSION TO THE<br />
COMMISSION IN THE JOB PROTECTION CASE IN SUPPORT OF<br />
IMPROVED JOB SECURITY STANDARDS. TOO OFTEN THE STANDARDS<br />
APPLIED IN AUSTRALIA HAVE FAILED TO MEET THE LEGITIMATE<br />
EXPECTATIONS OF WORKERS AND HAVE COMPARED POORLY WITH THOSE<br />
WHICH APPLY IN MANY COMPARABLE COUNTRIES. THE GOVERNMENT<br />
ACCORDINGLY INDICATED ITS SUPPORT FOR:<br />
IMPROVED STANDARDS IN RELATION TO DISMISSAL PROCEDURES;<br />
OBLIGATIONS ON EMPLOYERS TO CONSULT IN ADVANCE WITH<br />
WORKERS AND THEIR UNIONS ON PRODUCTIONj TECHNOLOGY AND<br />
OTHER CHANGES LIKELY TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON<br />
EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING PROPOSED REDUNDANCIES;<br />
THE PRINCIPLE OF MINIMUM PERIODS OF NOTICE AND<br />
CONSULTATION; AND<br />
THE PRINCIPLE OF RETRENCHMENT COMPENSATION.<br />
A KEY AREA NEGLECTED FOR FAR TOO LONG HAS BEEN THAT OF<br />
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY. IT IS ENCOURAGING THAT<br />
SEVERAL STATES ARE NOW STA'RTING TO TAKE ACTION.<br />
9<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE MATTERS L'IES PREDOMINANTLY WITH THE<br />
STATES., WITH THE COMMONWEALTH HAVING A DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY<br />
ONLY IN RELATION TO ITS OWN EMPLOYEES, THE ACT AND EXTERNAL<br />
TERRITORIES. BUT THERE IS MUCH TO BE GAINED BY GREATER<br />
COORDINATION. THE COMMON 1EALTH IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH<br />
THE STATES AND OTHER RELEtANT BODIES CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT<br />
ROLE IN THIS REGARD. .1015/ 1 </p>
<p>MlY GOVERNMENT IS NOW FINALISING ARRANGEMENTS TO ESTABLISH<br />
A NATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMISSION AND OFFICE, THE<br />
FOLLOWING STEPS ARE ENVISAGED:<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERIM COMMISSION, SERVICED BY<br />
A SECRETARIAT, TO DRAW TOGETHER INTERESTED PARTIES<br />
AND SPECIALIST EXPERTISE TO PLAN FOR AND IMPLEMENT A<br />
PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH THE COMMISSION AND OFFICE;<br />
CONTINUED CONSULTATIONS WITH STATE/ TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS.)<br />
INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES;<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE FOR THE FUNCTIONS<br />
OF THE PROPOSED COMMISSION AND OFFICE, INCLUDING ITS<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT,<br />
STEPS OF THIS KIND ARE PART OF OUR BROADER INTEREST IN MOVING<br />
TO IMPLEMENT THE LABOR PARTY'/ S NATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH<br />
AND SAFETY STRATEGY. THEY WOULD AL4SO BE A PRECONDITION OF<br />
OUR BEING ABLE TO RATIFY ILO CONVENTION No, 155 THE<br />
CONVENTION CONCERNING OCCUPATIONALSAFETY AND HEALTH AND<br />
THE WORKING ENVIRONMENT A CONVENTION TO WHICH MY GOVERNMENT<br />
ATTACHES HIGH PRIORITY,<br />
SOME OF THE MEASURES WHICH COULD BE INTRODUCED AND<br />
COORDINATED BY THE COMMISSION MIGHT INCLUDE:<br />
THE LICENSING OF CHEMICALS USED IN INDUSTRY .16/, </p>
<p>THE PROMOTION OF NATIONAL STANDARDS THROUGH<br />
CONSULTATION AND IN COOPERATION WITH THE STATES<br />
ENCOURAGING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY<br />
UNITS IN THE WORKPLACE TO MOUNT EDUCATION PROGRAMS<br />
AND TO MONITOR WORKING CONDITIONS<br />
THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL HAZARDS<br />
COMMISSIONING RELEVANT RESEARCH PROJECTS,<br />
SUCH MEASURES ARE BADLY NEEDED. MORE THAN 150,000 AUSTRALIANS<br />
PER YEAR ARE INJURED AS A RESULT OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS.<br />
THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF PRODUCTION COSTS AND LOSSES DIRECTLY<br />
RESULTING FROM INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS IS $ 6 BILLION PER YEAR.<br />
THE ECONOMY CANNOT AFFORD SUCH COSTS AND INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED<br />
DESERVE GREATER PROTECTION,<br />
THE EARLY EXPERIENCE OF MY GOVERNMENT HAS UNDERLINED THE SCOPE<br />
THAT EXISTS IN AUSTRALIA FOR ENLARGING AND IMIPROVING BILATERAL<br />
CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE GOVERN~ MEN T, UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS IN<br />
ALL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, WE HAVE ACTED IMMEDIATELY TO<br />
ESTABLISH NEW AND IMPROVED CONSULT-ATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. OUR<br />
PURPOSE WAS TO PUT CONSULTATIVE PROCESSES ON A SURE FOOTING<br />
AND TO AVOID THE DISASTROUSLY CONFRONTATIONIST APPROACHES<br />
OF THE PAST, *. 171, </p>
<p>HE ECONOMIC PLANNING ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS BEEN SET UP TO<br />
CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF CONSULTATION AND) INFORMATION EXCHANGE<br />
BEGUN AT THE SUMMIT, WITH MEMBERS DRAWN FROM GOVERNMENT,<br />
UNIONS, THE BUSINESS SECTOR, WELFARE AND OTHER COMMUNITY<br />
GROUPS. THE COUNCIL HAS A WIDE CHARTER, IT WILL PROVIDE THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WITH INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY-BASED ADVICE ON THE<br />
BROAD CONDUCT OF ECONOMIC POLICY, PARTICULARLY IN A MEDIUM<br />
AND LONGER-TERM CONTEXT. NOT LEAST IMPORTANT AMONG ITS<br />
FUNCTIONS WILL BE THE PROVISION OF ADVICE ON DESIRABLE AND<br />
FEASIBLE GOALS AND TARGETS AND ON POLICIES TO REALISE THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY'/ S FULL GROWTH POTENTIAL.<br />
WE HAVE ALSO MOVED TO ESTAB3LISH AN ADVISORY COUNCIL ON PRICES<br />
AND INCOMES, AS PROVIDED IN THE ACCORD, THIS BODY WILL<br />
MONITOR, AND ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT ON) THE IMPLEMENTATION OF<br />
THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY, IT<br />
WILL ALSO ADVISE ON THE COORDINATION AND CONSISTENCY OF THE<br />
POLICY AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS AND BETWEEN INCOME GROUPS,<br />
IT WILL REVIEW AND REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE POLICY<br />
AT REGULAR INTERVALS. MEMBERSHIP WILL COMPRISE COMMONWEALTH<br />
AND STATE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF<br />
UNION AND EMPLOYER GROUPS, AS WELL,, AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM<br />
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. THE ADVISORY COUNCIL WILL MEET<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OCTOBER.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS THEREFORE PLAYED ITS PART IN MOVING TO<br />
IMPLEMENT THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE'ACCORD, THE UNION MOVEMENT<br />
SHARES WITH THE GOVERNMENT A RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS SUCCESS.<br />
18/. </p>
<p>13,<br />
SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE. ACCORD WILL BE CRUCIAL TO<br />
DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE A GENUINE<br />
RECOVERY AND WHETHER OR NOT ITS BENEFITS CAN BE FAIRLY<br />
SHARED BY-~ THE AUSTRALIAN WORKFORCE AND ALL SECTIONS<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY,<br />
THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ACCORD MUST BE UPHELD AND SECTIONAL<br />
INTERESTS AND DEMANDS TURNED ASIDE1<br />
MY GOOD FRIENDS, IDO NOT COME TO YOU AS PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF A LABOR GOVERNMENT WITH A MESSAGE THAT IS DIFFERENT<br />
FROM WHAT I HAD BEGUN TO MAKE CLEAR AS YOUR PRESIDENTI.<br />
IN 1975 I PERCEIVED THE CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT<br />
IN THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD,<br />
IATTEMPTED IN MY PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS TO THE AC. TIU,<br />
CONGRESS IN THIS CITY, ON SEPTEMBER' 15TH, TO SPELL OUT THE<br />
IMPLICATIONS FOR US AS TRADE UNION LEADERS RESPONSIBLE<br />
TO OUR MEMBERS AND TO OUR COMMUNITY,<br />
MAY I REMIND YOU OF WHAT ISAID THEN: </p>
<p>19.<br />
"' THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR OF WAGE AND SALARY<br />
EARNERS ARE EMPLOYED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR,<br />
OUR MEMBERS, THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE,,<br />
DERIVE THEIR EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THAT SYSTEM AND<br />
PAY THE PRICES WHICH DETERMINE THEIR STANDARD<br />
OF LIVING WITHIN THAT SYSTEM,<br />
ivlIN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I SAY TO YOU THAT OUR<br />
AFFILIATES MUST RECOGNISE THE FULL IMPLIC ATIONS<br />
OF THEIR ACTIONS. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE SELFINTEREST<br />
OF PARTICULAR GROUPS BE BALANCED AGAINST<br />
THE INTERESTS OF WORKERS AS A WHOLE. THAT, AFTER<br />
ALLj IS WHAT TRADE UNIONISM IS FINALLY ABOUT.<br />
AND AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THEIR<br />
PARAMOUNT INTERESTS ARE TO BE PROTECTED FROM<br />
RISING UNEMPLOYMENT AND HIGH INFLATION, As<br />
RESPONSIBLE LEADERS WE ARE BOUND TO PROVIDE<br />
THAT PROTECTION. NO RHETORIC, 1OR CONCEIVED<br />
PROVOCATION, SHOULD DIVERT US FROM THE BASIC<br />
DUTY. ialTHE TRADE UNION MOVMENT IN'THE CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
CONFRONTING THE COMMUNITY TODAY MUST BE PREPARED<br />
TO EXERCISE ITS OWN RESTRAINT. THE SPECIAL<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES MUUJ BE SPECIAL AND NOT SIMPLY THE<br />
USE OF SOME EXCUSE WHICH IF EX TENDED WIDELY WOULD<br />
MEAN THE GENERATION OF PRESSURES FUELLING MASSIVE<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT AND FURWJIR INFLATION. lot </p>
<p>" THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT OUR MEMBERS WANT TO<br />
AVOID THAT SITUATION AND I TRUST THAT FROM THIS<br />
CONGRESS YOU WILL EXPECT YOUR INCOMING<br />
EXECUTIVE TO PLAY ITS PART IN ENSURING COMPLIANCE<br />
WITH THOSE EXPECTATIONS."<br />
THAT WAS ALMOST EXACTLY EIGHT YEARS AGO. THE SITUATION<br />
TODAY IS MUCH MORE URGENT AND DANGEROUS, FOR-WE HAVE HAD<br />
SEVEN INTERVENING YEARS SEVEN YEARS OF MISGUIDED<br />
CONSERVATIVE RULE CHARACTERISED BY AN ABSENCE OF ANY<br />
COHERENT ECONOMIC POLICY, PARTICULARY IN THE AREA OF<br />
WAGES. THE~ CONSERVATIVES' OWN PHILOSOPHY OF THEF FREE PLAY OFf MAKET<br />
FORCES INEVITABLY LED TO ANOTHER UNSUSTAINABLE WAGES<br />
EXPLOSION. WE HAVE REPLACED THAT CHAOS AND UNCERTAINTY WHICH LED<br />
TO A MASSIVE DETERIORATION IN OUR ECONOMY, WITH A COHERENT,<br />
COHESIVE AND POSITIVE ECONOMIC STRATEGY. THE PRICES.<br />
AND INCOMES POLICY IS CENTRAL TO TF4AT STRATEGY.<br />
t9<br />
THEREFORE I REPEAT IN 1983 WITH AN EVEN GREATER SENSE<br />
OF URGENCY WHAT I SAID IN 1975. BUT I SAY I ' T ' NOW WITH\<br />
THE ADDED FORCE WHICH COMES FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'<br />
ARE BEING ASKED TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK<br />
OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND EQUITABLE STRATEGY FOR ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERY, / 21 </p>
<p>21.<br />
SIGNIFICANT WAGES INCREASES EXTRACTED OUTSIDE THE<br />
CENTRALISED SYSTEM WILL UNDERMINE OUR POLICIES AND CAUSE<br />
THE ULTIMATE COLLAPSE OF THE INCIPIENT RECOVERY.<br />
My GOVERNMENT, A LABOR GOVERNMENT, WITH A PARTICULAR<br />
COMMITMENT TO INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIAN WORKING . MEN AND<br />
WOMEN AND TO THE MASSES OF THE UNEMPLOYED, WILL-NOT<br />
RESILE FROM ITS DETERMINATION TO UPHOLD THE PRICES AND<br />
INCOMES POLICY, TO SEE REALISED THE PRINCIPLES OF THE<br />
ACCORD AND TO ENSURE THAT THE POLICY SUCCEEDS IN<br />
ITS CENTRAL AIM OF ACHIEVING A SUSTAINED AND SUSTAINABLE<br />
RECOVERY, ADHERENCE TO THIS APPROACH WILL BE OF SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT<br />
TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIP.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT EXPECTS AND LOOKS FORWARD TO THE CO-OPERATION<br />
OF EACH AND EVERY AUSTRALIAN IN THIS ENDEAVOUR, </p>
<p>22.<br />
FINALLY, I WOULD NOT WANT YOU TO CONFINE YOUR DELIBERATIONS<br />
TO MATTERS OF STRICTLY DOMESTIC PREOCCUPATION AND CONCERN,<br />
THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SITUATION, AND ESPECIALLY THE<br />
EXTENT TO WHICH RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SUPER-POWERS HAVE<br />
DETERIORATED, SHOULD COMMAND YOUR CLOSEST ATTENTION.<br />
WE HAVE BEEN MADE VIVIDLY AWARE OF THIS IN tHE PAST WEEK<br />
WITH THE COMPLETELY INEXCUSABLE SHOOTING DOWN OF KOREAN<br />
AIRLINES FLIGHT 007 BY THE SOVIET UNION. WE REMAIN<br />
DEEPLY CONCERNED AT THE CONTINUING INADEQUACY OF SOVIET<br />
EXPLANATIONS OF THEIR ROLE IN THIS TRAGEDY. WE, ABHOR<br />
THEIR LACK OF CONTRITION AND EXPECT THEM TO HEED THE OUTRAGE<br />
OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,<br />
THE WORLD TODAY IS3 FRAUGHT WITH TENSIONS. THE THREAT<br />
OF NUCLEAR WAR IS AS REAL TODAY AS IT HAS EVER BEEN IN THE<br />
PAST, THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE HAS TO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE<br />
CONTROL OF EFFECTIVE AGREEMENTS. A CLIMATE MUST BE ESTABLISHED<br />
WITHIN WHICH A COMPREHENSIVE AND FYLLY VERIFIABLE BAN ON<br />
NUCLEAR TESTING MIGHT BE POSSIBLE. W4E OWE THIS TO OURSELVES<br />
AND TO FUTURE GENERATIONS.<br />
MY OWN GOVERNMENT'S MOVES TO PROMOTE A. NUCLEAR FREE ZONE IN<br />
THE SOUTH PACIFIC ARE A FIRST STEP IN THIS DIRECTION. WE<br />
INTEND PRESSING AHEAD WITH THIS AND THE OTHER INITIATIVES<br />
WE HAVE MOUNTED IN THE ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT Flt. rDi </p>
<p>23.<br />
VLTIMATELY. PROGRESS SHOULD BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IF, AS<br />
IBELIEVE LIKELY, POPULAR AWARENESS OF THE RISKS INVOLVED<br />
IN THE CURRENT SITUATION BECOMES SHARPER AND MORE DEMANDING.<br />
IN CONCLUSION, MR PRESIDENT AND DELEGATES; MAY I STRESS<br />
AGAIN THE OBLIGATION THAT WE ALL HAVE TO THOSE SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
LESS PRIVILEGED THAN OURSELVES, PARTICULARLY THF LJNFMPl0YFV),<br />
LET OUR THOUGHTS, OUR DELIBERATIONS AND OUR DECISIONS HAVE<br />
THEM CONSISTENTLY IN MIND.<br />
THAT IS WHAT OUR GREAT AUSTRALIAN LABOR MOVEMENT OF W~ HICH<br />
YOU ARE SUCH AN INTEGRAL PART IS AND OUGHT TO BE ABOUT.<br />
BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL SHARE THIS CONVICTION WITH ME,<br />
I WISH THIS CONGRESS WELL. </p>
