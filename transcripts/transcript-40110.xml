    <content><![CDATA[<p>The opening of the National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA) Graduate School provides a much needed ‘creative and cultural hub’ for mid-career and upskilling artists.</p>
<p>The Graduate School will lead Australia into a new era of training in performing arts ensuring we remain productive, creative and competitive in a global market.</p>
<p>The Australian Government provided $6.8 million in capital works funding to NIDA, which included support for the Graduate School. This funding was complemented by business and philanthropic support leveraged by NIDA.</p>
<p>NIDA is one of Australia’s seven national elite performing arts training institutions and is regarded as one of the world’s top 10 actor training schools.</p>
<p>We expect the best of our artists and arts organisations and to help them succeed and compete internationally we must ensure they have access to the infrastructure they need.</p>
<p>The NIDA Graduate School directly ensures Australia invests in our artistic talent and helps develop our next generation of actors, policy makers, festival and artistic directors.</p>
<p>NIDA has produced some of Australia’s most successful and recognised performing artists, whether on our screens and stages, or taking leading roles behind the scenes.</p>
