TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, HYATT HOTEL, CANBERRA, 5 DECEMBER<br />
1990 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: You must be happy with the cricket result<br />
yesterday. PM: Yes I am. Yes I am.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your response to calls by Mr Reith<br />
yesterday that Mr Keating should resign?<br />
PM: Well I would've thought the general assessment after<br />
yesterday's performance that the burden of remarks about<br />
who should resign is directed very, very squarely at Mr<br />
Reith. What: a pathetic performance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think at least you should consider a<br />
reshuffle seeing that the Treasurer's given us a<br />
recession? PM: I'm not: considering a reshuffle but I seriously<br />
think that Dr Hewson, or should I say the Liberal Party,<br />
should be thinking of a reshuffle. I think it's about<br />
time for that hurdy gurdy to get going again.<br />
