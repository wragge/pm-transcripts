    <content><![CDATA[<p>SeptemberÂ 22, 1976</p>
<p>I am delighted to be here today at a function that helps celebrateÂ the 50th birthday-of an old acquaintance.Â </p>
<p>I have been reading the Canberra Times for around 21 years. ThatÂ is what happens when people come to Canberra as politicians Â they have to read the Canberra Times. It is almost the goldenÂ rule. I must confess that over the years the Canberra Times newsÂ and comment pages have filled me with a variety of emotions.</p>
<p>They still do.</p>
<p>There is not a politician alive who will admit that his onlyÂ real enjoyment left in life is waiting for the morning newspapersÂ to arrive. Newspapers are not meant to make politicians happy.</p>
<p>In many-ways, . a newspaperÂ is the single most importantÂ institution in a communit y. It symbolises so-many otherÂ things and if it were not for newspapers, so many otherÂ things that are important would also not exist in ourÂ community. Newspapers are Vehicles that inform, enlighten,Â entertain, and often actas'a social and politicalÂ conscience.</p>
<p>For 50 years, the Canberra Times has played just thisÂ traditional role, and it has played it well. But of courseÂ its influence has been felt far beyond the geographicalÂ boundaries of the National Capital.</p>
<p>By its very nature, the newspaper of any political capitalÂ has influence far wider than other locally circulated newspapers.</p>
<p>It not only has the ability to report the political eventsÂ of the day, it has the unique capacity to report the peopleÂ the politicians, the advisers, the public servants behindÂ the great events. The Caucberra Times is certainly no exception.</p>
<p>It does have a special behind the scenes insight into theÂ workings of Australia's National Capital. It is in a betterÂ position to have that insight than others which have quartersÂ in other cities. That is why it's required reading forÂ politicians and that is why its influence is considerable.</p>
<p>This occasion is appropriate for me to briefly outline a workingÂ politician's view of the press.</p>
<p>As you all know, I have always enjoyed very good relations with<br />the press. Sometimes their relations with me have been a little<br />strained. And as you know it has never been my fault.<br />Today, more than ever before, the role of the press and the<br />politician are interwoven.</p>
<p>Because of the size of modern electorates, no politican canÂ hope to make and maintain personal contact with more than aÂ tiny fraction of his constituency. He must rely on the press.Â An effective press is, therefore, an essential and integral elementÂ of democracy.</p>
<p>Of course, the traffic is not all one way.</p>
<p>Some poeple say we need informed politicians even more than we need an informed public.</p>
<p>Again, the politicians cannot talk personally to all the experts.<br />Only from the press can he obtain a cross section of expert<br />comment, letters to the editor, straws in the wind, and that<br />summary of reflected opinion which derives from the mysterious<br />alchemy of reporter, coluuniist, and editor.</p>
<p>The role gives the press great power although perhaps notÂ quite as much as it thinks and power carries with it greatÂ responsibility.</p>
<p>The press has many facets, but the political role of the press<br />can be said to keep the public and the politician informed on<br />matters of public concern. Information goes beyond the bare<br />facts. It extends to informed comment, some projection and<br />a little advance warning.</p>
<p>People in a democracy acknowledge the need for a free press.<br />But there is no such animal as absolute freedom any more for the<br />press than for the citizen. The limits of one freedom always<br />clash with the limits of another freedom so boundaries have<br />to be drawn.</p>
<p>Likewise, with the press and the politician. Information may<br />be untimely, comment may be premature, and judgement may be<br />incomplete so there may well be a case for judicious delay<br />or a case for maintaining confidentiality.</p>
<p>This raises a fundamental question. How do you ensure the<br />delay is justified, that confidentiality is really in the<br />public interest and not just in the interest of the politician<br />or his party?</p>
<p>There is no absolute answer, but time has a habit of catching<br />up with those who break the rules.</p>
<p>There is more than one party, more than one minister, more<br />than one newspaper so standards of normal behaviour tend<br />to become established and observed.Â </p>
<p>As I indicated earlier, in a democratic society there is aÂ close link between responsibilities of politicans and theÂ press. Indeed, in the political field, their respective rolesÂ are in a sense complimentary.</p>
<p>The actions and decisions of government are of vital community<br />concern. Although speeches in campaigns and in parliament have<br />their special place, responsibility for informing the nation<br />of these actions and decisions falls largely on the media.</p>
<p>Clearly, then the politican particularly one holding ministerialÂ office has a responsibility to keep the press as accuratelyÂ and fully informed as possible on events that he controls.Â Earlier this year opening the National Press Club I said that<br />if the Australian electorate is to be able to make validÂ judgements on government policy it should have the greatestÂ access to information as possible.</p>
<p>The Interdepartmental Committee that reported in December 1974Â on proposed freedom of information legislation has beenÂ reconvened and has met on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>The task of the Committee is to study and report on proposals forÂ freedom of information legislation,</p>
<p>The Committee has been directed to report as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I hope it doesn't follow entirely some aspects of an act or bill<br />in the United States-that many people are now calling the<br />Sunshine Act because I am advised that it will make the oper. ations<br />for certain statutory authorities utterly impossible. Every word<br />and every decision or report of decision would have to be made<br />completely and absolutely covered. One chairman of a noted<br />organisation in the United States, in talking to members of Congress,<br />who were promoting the Sunshine legislation, said that it would<br />just make the institution of the government unworkable and then<br />members of Congress are meant to have said that you could even<br />have people to dinner and make decisions there and just record the<br />formal decisions and that would be all you would have to tell us.<br />But he had more character than that and more determination as I<br />am sure many would have here. He said if you pass laws that make<br />the workings of institutions unworkable I am going to carry out<br />the letter of that law absolutely and you as a legislator will<br />then have to bear the responsibility for the institution of being<br />unworthy. The Sunshine Act has not yet seen the early morning<br />sunshine. it is still locked within the confines of Congress.</p>
<p>I have also written to Ministers asking them to review secrecy<br />provisions in legislation for which they are responsible. I want<br />to make it plain that the purpose of this review is to reduce<br />unnecessary secrecy. Of course, such a review would be essential<br />It against the background of freedom of information legislation because<br />when such legislation is introduced it could be found that provision<br />of existing legislation would be incompatible with the thrust and<br />purpose of it.</p>
<p>Ministers should be approachable, available, and accessible.</p>
<p>They have not only been requested to make themselves available<br />wherever possible to the media, but also to ensure that their<br />departments make the greatest efforts to supply the public with<br />information.</p>
<p>Ever since I became a politician and no doubt for many years<br />before people have spoken and written about the alleged<br />conspiracy on the part of Governments to withhold information<br />from the press. The press are seen as knights in shining armour<br />standing as a guardian of democratic freedom.</p>
<p>Some see the press/ politician relationship as a kind of power<br />struggle. They see the politican doing his best to enshroud<br />his actions in secrecy while the reporter uses all his talents<br />and contacts to penetrate the veil.</p>
<p>The results are seen as a sort of political catechism with some<br />things unpublished which ought to be published, and some published<br />which obviously should not be published sometimes in a garbled and<br />misleading fashion.</p>
<p>While there may occasionally in certain circumstances be an element<br />o f truth in this, I do not believe this represents the real<br />situation.</p>
<p>The democratic system is not exempt from the hard realities of<br />practical day by day administration which demands that some<br />reticence, at least, must inevitably be applied to when and how<br />the information is provided.</p>
<p>There are policies which in the making could well be jeo'pardised<br />if publicised prematurely, or which involve other authorities<br />including governments, local and overseas.</p>
<p>The maintenance of privacy for the individual must also be<br />constantly in mind.</p>
<p>In relationships between governments, confidentiality is also often<br />go quite essential -in the interest of frank and truthful communication.<br />In our own federal system of government, relationships between<br />the states require a degree of confidence that would not apply if<br />every letter between a Premier and Prime Minister were to become<br />public in the joint decision making process.<br />Also, there are some matters which for security reasons cannot<br />be disclosed long after the event.<br />The politician has to weigh this against his duty to inform the<br />public of what he is about. This makes for difficult and sometimes<br />unpopular decisions.<br />I believe that the responsible press understand that there may be<br />good reasons why a minister cannot give information at a particular<br />time.<br />Having said that, can I again strongly make the point. I want an<br />unhindered flow of information to the media. I want factual<br />information provided, to encourage people to make constructive and<br />useful judgements.<br />I believe ministers are playing their part. They do recognise<br />this fundamental need to provide factual information quickly<br />and accurately.</p>
<p>q 0000000000000<br />Finally, can I return to the Canberra Times.<br />In these days, when many great international newspapers and<br />journalists have closed their doors and others are reducing<br />in size because of cost pressures, it is a most significant<br />achievement for a newspaper to celebrate a half century.<br />This milestone was not reached simply as a matter of course.<br />That it was born in a community with less than 5000 people<br />and within a few years had survived the great depression and<br />other setbacks was due largely to the dedication, enthusiasm<br />and singular optimism of the remarkable Shakespear family.<br />There is an example of dedication, commitment and determination of<br />which I believe, any organisation and any newspaper'and any<br />organisation in the wider field, would be proud.<br />I understand that an unexpected Government advertisement or<br />a printing order meant the difference between survival, and<br />having to close the doors. On* one occasion the winnings-from<br />a lucky bet paid an account that could not otherwise have been<br />paid. As we say in this country, the paper was surviving on the smell<br />of an oil rag and an indefatigable spirit.<br />For Mrs Heather Shakespeare this month of celebration must<br />surely bring back vivid memories of a newspaper and a .' munity<br />growing up together.<br />Mrs Shakespeare can take pride in the fact that the Canberra<br />Times part founded by her late husband, Arthur Shakespear<br />has played an integral role in the development and maturing of<br />Canberra itself.<br />The Canberra Times has stood'the test of time. It has reported<br />local, national and international news without fear, without<br />favour. I am sure the publisher, editors and staff are looking ahead<br />to news gathering into the next century with the enthusiasm<br />that was obviously present on the first day of publication.<br />I say that the enthusiasm was obviously present on that historic<br />first friday in September 50 years ago because I noticed a page<br />one report on the Prime Minister ( Mr Stanley Bruce attending a<br />function at the Port Adelaide Town Hall.<br />A Mr Gray, an official of the Waterside Workers' Union walked<br />up to Mr Bruce and presented him with a writ for 5,000 pounds for<br />alleged slander.<br />The Canberra Times report said that Mr Bruce was completely taken<br />aback and had said the whole thing was so well managed that the<br />Union should have had a photographer present to take a picture<br />of the delivery of the writ.<br />It so happens that I too am going to Adelaide this Friday. I hope<br />that the Canberra Times ' is equally* well organsed....</p>
