FOR PRESS 3 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
HEALTH INSURANCE FOR CHRONICALLY ILL<br />
This morning I have discussed with Mr. Hunt the situation<br />
of chronically ill patients covered by private health<br />
insurance organizations.<br />
We are both determined that the chronically ill will be<br />
protected. Accordingly, the Minister will be reporting urgently to<br />
Cabinet on this serious matter. 000---</p>
