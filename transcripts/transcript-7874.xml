JOU&amp; NALISTi Prie ) inister, what's the situation on<br />
Bougainv lle and what steps is the Government taking?<br />
PIIt Well the situation is obviously tens. there. We<br />
haven't waited for these latest dvelojsmnts. I insisted<br />
some several weaks ago that we should ha-e discussions with<br />
the Government of Papua Ne Guinea so that in the event it's<br />
judged neceesary to mount an operation to proteot and rescue<br />
astralimn oltieara, we vould nave the prior understanding<br />
of the Goverment of Papua Wv Guinea that we'd do that. so<br />
those arranqexents have been made and we are in a situation<br />
where it the Judgement is vade that it's necessary to nova<br />
to provide that protection and evacuation it can be done.<br />
So obviously our people are constantly monitoring the<br />
situation.<br />
JO EIALIS? Are there any moves to get Harcules airrat up<br />
there? KIN All I can say is that ye won't go into details about<br />
wht arrangeent, will be adse, Our Defence forces have<br />
been orderd to be in a position to do whatever is judged<br />
necsary to protect Australian lives.<br />
JOUR2IASTt Are you angry by yesterday's murder?<br />
PWt You must alvays be arxy when an innocent person is<br />
killed. JOURNALIST: Mr HakL, will the ACTU be getting their<br />
dand. e for a 71 vaq increase? </p>
<p>2<br />
PN: It doesn't operate in tors of the ACTV sakiri demanda<br />
and their demands being acceded to. What happens * Fan<br />
hAS happned nofor the beat part of7 * are -is thatvwe<br />
hay. a cons~ gtativo approach where we ta not onl y with the<br />
A M! but with employers as well, they put their point of<br />
view as to what is a basis for a reasonable and Ordited<br />
agg,; tenational wages outcome. They'll be puii-that<br />
cilf to uS, We'll Consider it. We wili come to A<br />
Iibn which will enable the coutry to know for the next<br />
12 zoatho what the wages outcome vill be. That is a<br />
capacity that ws have an a Government which no alternative<br />
poliicalgrouping has.<br />
JOVMMLISTi Could the economy sustain wag" s tied to Cdl<br />
increases? M~ Now we've sade it quite clear that we're not going to<br />
bul the cocpt of automtic vages indexation To have the<br />
objecive of maintaining real wages is a<br />
aspiration anid we will be talking with teraeunion<br />
UQ~ met and with employers about the ways in which their<br />
legitimate aspirations can be met. What in ipozrtant in<br />
running the Australian econczy is that you do have control<br />
of wa so that you are able to say whbat the wages outcome<br />
is Qozz to be for the ensuing period. We Ive been able to<br />
do that aom for the last 7 yeaws and that** vtat's been a<br />
Critically Important factor in the creation of the 1.* 6<br />
million mew lobe. It you can't run wages as we cazi run<br />
vau then you ean't run the economy and that to the<br />
tundmsintal difference betwuen the Govrnnt and the<br />
Opposition,, who of course would have* onsather in the<br />
a of wages and ropAt the wages explosicm of 81/ 82 which<br />
1hr~ igt tiscountry to its worst recession in so years.<br />
J~ eNALs? Will the forthcoming election pmt you at a<br />
disdvtge o you think in negotiating with the AM~ in<br />
the frho in Woge talks?<br />
in: not at all.<br />
JOURIWST: I&amp; Restinq in the Financial Review this morning<br />
suwested a $ 6 to $ 7 a week tax reduction for the ACTU.<br />
PK: To say he sugg~ ested it, he said that the question of a<br />
tax cut would be on the table and the question of wage<br />
increases, tax cutes, superannuation all ths elements will1<br />
be an the table and the decisions viii. be taken which will<br />
be in the best interests of the Australian economy, as we've<br />
done before.<br />
JOUNIST: Can the average worker expect their wages to be<br />
maintained or would they be looking at ervoian of their<br />
W314. </p>
<p>FM The vorker can look to a position whre the objeotive<br />
of maintaining a gradual i. m. rov-nt of standards, not only<br />
ta. kough the wage packet but through the social waqe and<br />
isuss 1iXe superannuation, vi I be achieved.<br />
JOGRI8USTs Priea Kinister, x, rating also said that ha<br />
favourod May to an election date. Any caeflt on that?<br />
wi: You saw my comme yesterday. 2 said it's a fair<br />
chance of being right. You ought to go off and lay your<br />
bets, I man as much as I love Brisbane ar Quenwland I'm<br />
not going to announce the date.<br />
JOURNtaST: The Gos oovernment has today aniwuncud the<br />
mortgage relief scheme. is that a show of no confidence in<br />
your M<br />
JOURMAUlST: No Of course it isn't. With ract it's a<br />
nth" strazgquestion. You krQV that that was a<br />
th cmitm tat was uds during the election W4igan4<br />
the camitsntx that UQr Goss makes ar comi% t<br />
Goae will keep.<br />
