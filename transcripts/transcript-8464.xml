PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
AID FOR TURKISH EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS<br />
All Australians were distressed to learn of the tragic loss<br />
of life and property which occurred as a result of the<br />
recent earthquakes in the eastern Turkish city of Erzincan.<br />
On Monday I conveyed to Prime Minister Demirel of Turkey the<br />
deepest sympathy of the Australian Government and people.<br />
As a contribution to the international relief effort, the<br />
Australian Government will contribute $ 250,000 in financial<br />
assistance to help the victims of the earthquake.<br />
This assistance will be provided through the Australian Red<br />
Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red<br />
Crescent Societies, and will be used primarily for the<br />
purchase of emergency shelter and blankets.<br />
In view of the urgency and the distance involved, the best<br />
way for Australia to help is through financial assistance.<br />
The funds will be provided by the Government's overseas aid<br />
agency, AIDAB, the Australian International Development<br />
Assistance Bu: ceau.<br />
