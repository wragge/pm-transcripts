FEDERAL RURAL CONVENTION<br />
" THE MAXIMUM USE OF AUSTRALIA' S RURAL RESOURCES"' LlIAy.<br />
Sponsored by the Federal Rural Committee of the<br />
Liberal ary of Australia<br />
AT WAGIA 9AGGA. N. S. W. 23RD JUNE, 1966<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Mr. Chairman Senator Sim, Your Worship the Mayor Parliamentary<br />
and Ministerial Colleagues and Distinguished Guestcs and Visit', rs<br />
Ladi---s and Gentlemen: First, Mr. Chairman, may I, through you, thank very<br />
warmly the Mayor of this historic city of Ylagga for his very<br />
pleasant welcome to us all. We wanted to come to Wagga for reasons,<br />
I think, which can be readily established-, but it is nice to know<br />
that the people of Wagga also wanted us to be with them, and you,<br />
Mr. Mayor, have conveyed in the spirit of hospitality which is one<br />
of the happy features of Australian life, that welcome to us. A<br />
warm welcome on a crisp Wagga morning makes conditions entirely<br />
comfortable for us; at least we feel well disposed to you and to<br />
each other. I will have a good deal to say to you on the substance<br />
of the Conference. It's not usual for me to speak on rural matters<br />
and I am rather enjoying the novelty of it when I come to it. But<br />
before I do so, I hope you will feel it appropriate for me to make<br />
some reference to the dreadful occurrence in which the Leader of the<br />
Opposition was so painfully involved.. I do so, conscious of the<br />
limitations which are imposed on one at a time when proceedings,<br />
court proceedings, are pending against a charged person, but I feel<br />
bound in my responsibility as head of the National u'overnment to<br />
make some comment and indicate some views to you.<br />
First, I am sure I spoke for all right-thinking<br />
Australians when I condemned the episode and expressed our<br />
sympathy for Mr.. Calwell personally, when I pointed to the fact<br />
that we in Australia had a democratic tradition singularly free<br />
from episodes of violence. But the episode has at least served<br />
the purpose of concentrating our minds not only on this particular<br />
incident but on those matters which associate themselves with it<br />
in our minds, and I am going to speak very briefly, for I have no<br />
wish to intrude unduly into the work of the conference, but we do<br />
in Australia zealously guard the democratic tradition of coming e ./ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
% together,. exchanging our views sometimes dissenting, sometimes<br />
criticising, sometimes applauding, but feeling free to do so in an<br />
atmosphere, however turbulent it may become in the exchange of words,<br />
has in the past been happily free of this aspect of violenoce so<br />
strilingly demonstrated to us in this last couple of days. And I<br />
suppose in any community, whatever precautions are taken, whatever<br />
public attitudes exist, one can't eliminate or a community can't<br />
eliminate entirely the danger that people perhaps emotionally<br />
disturbed or in some other way having lost control temporarily of<br />
their normal restraints, involve themselves in episodes of this sort.<br />
But what the Parliament must do, I believe, is examine carefully the<br />
question whether there has been significant changes in the Australian<br />
situation which should call for some review by us, and I believe that<br />
there have been, that they are identifiable. We must face the fact<br />
that we have a more diversified community than at earlier points of our<br />
history, that there will be people in our community who come from<br />
countries where political violence is not as uncommon a matter as<br />
happily it has been here, that these days we do have a much more<br />
active interest in public affairs on the part of young people who are<br />
in employment and who have resources of their own and who have rights<br />
and liberties of their own. to safeguard. They in turn may b~ e<br />
influenced by methods which in countries neighbouring to us have been<br />
employed by young people to demonstrate vigorously, and at times<br />
violently, against government policies. And I think we shall find,<br />
if we make some reyiew of these matters, that the answer is not to<br />
be found in putting in another policeman or two to a public hall<br />
or having some sort of security protection imposed on prominent<br />
public personages, but it is to be found in community C-ttitudes, the<br />
judgments which individuals in the community form of the conduct of<br />
those around them, and I don't elaborate because that is not the<br />
purpose of our gathering here. I merely say by way of illustration<br />
I think we have as a community to decide when, for example, a public<br />
demonstration passes beyond the border of legitimate protest into a<br />
process of harassment and intimidation, and other examples, of course,<br />
could be quoted from contemporary experience.<br />
I would hope that I shall be able to consult, not only<br />
with my own senior colleagues, but with them, in turn, with the<br />
Leader of the Opposition and some of his senior colleagues because<br />
the implications of an episode such as this rise above the normal<br />
party division which exists in this country and relates to the welfare<br />
of the nation as a whole. In the meantime, a speedy recovery to the<br />
Leader of the Opposition and may he sustain no abiding injury as a<br />
result of this unhappy episode. </p>
<p>-53-<br />
Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, I turn to the business<br />
of ffhe conference and my own participation in it, and I say how<br />
timely I think this conference is, You, Mr. Chairman, were good<br />
enough to say that I put myself to some inconvenience to be here<br />
at this time, I am here because my own judgment is that the subject<br />
matters that you are dealing with rank amongst the most important<br />
that concern public men and women in this country.<br />
The whole welfare, prosperity, security of Australia<br />
rests squarely upon the health and vitality and prosperity of the<br />
primary industries of Australia. This is fundamental to our Tery<br />
existence. No good us talking about the manufacturinLg industries<br />
if we haven't got the means of importing the requirements of<br />
manufacturing industries. No good us talking about improved social<br />
standards and the services that one man can provide for another<br />
in order to make life more agreeable -andmore than 50 per cent. of<br />
our work force are employed in services of one kind or another to<br />
the rest of the community if we haven't got the means which an<br />
export income produces for us to carry these things into fulfilme-nt.<br />
The manufacturing industries have a rather more glamorous<br />
atmosphere and public presentation about them, certainly in the<br />
years since the Second W~ orld WHar, and we have all welcomed the<br />
quite spectecular increase which has occurred in Australian<br />
manufacturing industry over that period. Rather interesting and<br />
surprising to discover that proportionately to our population we<br />
have as many people engaged in manufacturing industries as are to<br />
be found in the United States of America, and they number as a<br />
proportion of the work force some 27 per cent, or three times the<br />
current percentage of the work force to be found in our primary<br />
production. Understandably, therefore, the manufacturing<br />
industries have occupied a good deal of the public stage and of<br />
the press. The incentives given to increase exports of manufactured<br />
products, the urgings upon the manufacturers and others to increase<br />
their exports so that they can supplement the earnings of primary<br />
industry, these things, too, have occupied prominence in the public<br />
mind. But we must never forget that for as far ahead as we can<br />
see, Australia's principal reliance for the export income which<br />
enables us to buy the raw materials and the equipment to keep<br />
secondary industries going and the wherewithal to maintain an<br />
Australian community in a state of prosperity and with a high<br />
standard of living, this aepends on the success we achieve in the<br />
conduct of the great primary industries of this country. That is,<br />
I repeat a fundamental consideration for any Australian Parliament<br />
and f or a gathering such as this. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Having stated that, it doesn't produce any sense of timeliness<br />
or urgency about a matter which has always been with us. But there<br />
are particular aspects which do point up this timeliness.<br />
The effect on employment I have mentionedand the effect on<br />
the manufacturer because of our imports into this country..... it is<br />
calculated that just on 80 per cent. or four-fifths of what we bri ng<br />
in are imports necessary for the conduct of our manufacturing<br />
industries, either in the foi-m of raw materials, semi-processed<br />
matter, equipment or some other gradient of those classificnations.<br />
And therefore if we are to increase our manufacturing capacity, and<br />
we certainly wish to do that, it can only be done so on the basis of<br />
an increasing export income.<br />
It has a bearing directly on our capacity to carry through<br />
the immigration programme because modern trends have provided<br />
fewer employment opportunities. 0n the land, as you knowincreased<br />
mechanisation has resulted in the percentage of the work force<br />
dropping from 12 per cent, a few years ago to 9 per cent, today,<br />
and that trend looks like persisting.<br />
It is in the manufacturing industries whiich employ three<br />
' bimes that percentage that work opportunities are likely to be founJ<br />
more largely for the new labour coming on to the market, whether<br />
from our own natural increase or from the migrants who come to this<br />
country. Here again, unless we can go ahead with an increase in<br />
our primary production, we are going to run into trouble there.<br />
Itis timely because there are uncertainties at the present<br />
time about the volume of capital inflow we can expect into Australia.<br />
There are restraints indicated in the United States and in the United<br />
Kingdom, and while it is not yet clear how substantially they will<br />
affect the Australian position, we would be foolish to go along on<br />
any casual assumption that there will be indefinitely for us a flow<br />
of capital into this country sufficiently large to bridge the gap<br />
which has shown up in recent years between our export receipts and<br />
our export payments.<br />
The other factor which I think makes it timely is that for<br />
the first time in perhaps twenty years, certainly a considerable<br />
period of years, a substantial area of Australia has been subjected,<br />
and remains subjected to the ravages of drought, and this has caused<br />
more hard thinking about what can be done either to avoid drought<br />
consequences in areas where the water can be conserved, or to mitigate<br />
the effects of drought by appropriate policies of silage or fodder<br />
conservation and other matters of that sort. a a a </p>
<p>Therefore, the incidence of drought and its effects bring<br />
a conference of this kind appropriately to being.<br />
Now, here again, we have seen what the primary industries<br />
mean to the prosperity of the nation as a whole. The drop in farm<br />
earnings from the effects of drought has radiated its influence<br />
through other sections of the economy. If there is a quietness in<br />
certain areas of the Australian economy today beyond that we would<br />
wish to see, then you can trace influences flowing from the diought<br />
very considerably to the effect which has emerged there.<br />
Finally, there is a timeliness, if not the same degree of<br />
urgency in giving some concentrated consideration to what Australia<br />
should be doing, what we should be planning for the enormous<br />
increase in demand for our primary production that we can reasonably<br />
anticipate between now and the end of this century. We are<br />
strategically placed in an area of the world where one-third of the<br />
human population is within ready service of goods that can be<br />
despatched from this country Fifteen hundred million people<br />
of Asia, quite apart from the markets we have established in other<br />
parts of the world, and the demographers predict that by the end of<br />
the century on present population trends, wie could see a doubling<br />
of the population there.<br />
Already Australia is feeling some of the consequences of<br />
this growth in population, associated at the same time as it is<br />
with some improvement in the capacity to import in these countries,<br />
As for example, Japan builds up its industrial strength, so you<br />
find that it is looking for larger volumes of foodstuffs, of raw<br />
materials; the Westernising influences on Japanese life are<br />
influencing people to eat different types of food vvhich we are<br />
capable bf supplying. This has lead to a quite dramatic increase<br />
in the figures of trade between our owin country and Japan.<br />
I think they might usefully be put to you.<br />
As recently as 1958/ 59, Japan purcnhased goods to a value<br />
of $ 204M. from this rountry. In 1964/ 65, that t2O4M. had grown<br />
to S442M. If we take the movement of major export items to Asia<br />
generally, we find that in 1964/ 65, we sold S284M. worth of wool,<br />
$ 180M. worth of wheat and $ 44M. value of metals, S38M. value of<br />
sugar. Now these are markets which even in comparatively recent<br />
times we would have regarded as comparatively small receivers of<br />
Australian exports, and we are, I believe, merely on the threshold<br />
of our potentialities there.<br />
Now, I have indicated a number of reasons why a conference<br />
.' of this sort is timely. I have, I hope, established that the<br />
primary industries are of fundamental importance to the progress 9 0 O/ IC </p>
<p>6-<br />
of the Australian economy and the welfare of our people.<br />
How are the primary industries themselves measuring up<br />
to the requirements imposed upon them? Here again a few figures<br />
may be illuminating. I just take two of our principal items bout they could be<br />
said to be generally illustrative. In 1948/ 49, we produced<br />
1,050 million pounds weight of wool. By% 1964/ 65, that had grown<br />
to 1,794 million pounds.-Wheat 1948/ 49 191 million bushels;<br />
1964/ 65 369 million bushels. These are impressive figures.<br />
Without that increase in production, Australia could not have<br />
sustained a migration programme, could not have maintained the<br />
standards which we currently enjoy today. And this is not by any<br />
means an end point quite obviously because the requirements of<br />
the future make the accomplishments of today look like only a pale<br />
beginning of what lies ahead.<br />
I don't know how accurate the projections can be said to<br />
be but I know that the view is taken inside the Commonwealth<br />
Departments that we shall need by a comparatively short time ahead<br />
of us to reach an export income of just on $ 5,010M., and this<br />
is assuming Alistralian population grow. th projected on a reasonable<br />
basis related to current movements, and an increase in the requirements<br />
of Australian manufacturing production as it, in turn,<br />
proceeds to develop.<br />
Now the UJovernment has not been, of course, unaware of<br />
these deyelopments and requirements, and I hope ' you will agree that<br />
in a great variety of ways, we have sought to encourage the favourable<br />
output from the primary industries which has been reflected in the<br />
figuxres that I have quoted to you. We have in more recent times<br />
a&amp; opted new policy measures provision of long-term rural<br />
finance, long a goal sought by the primary industries; we have<br />
adopted towards the relief of drought a more liberal, approach than<br />
I believe any government previously in the history of Australia.<br />
Our approach this time was not on any mere basis of sort of<br />
temporary rei~ ief to those unfortunately afflicted. Our approach<br />
was on the basis of an economic measure designed to sustain demand,<br />
to sustain activity in areas which had experienced the ravages of<br />
drought, and this innovation of attitude and policy was certainly<br />
welcomed by the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland, and<br />
I believe has been welcomed by those who speak for the primary<br />
producers of this country. It has certainly been welcomed by the<br />
farmers and graziers directly affected by the adverse consequences<br />
of drought. But when you look down the list and I am not going to </p>
<p>-7<br />
occupy your time today in too much g. etail on it, you see the<br />
wealth of measures adopted over recent years and in the past to<br />
encourage the growth of healthy, efficient, competitive Australian<br />
industry: The work of the OSIRO, the work of the Development<br />
Bank, the various schemes of industry research, the preferential<br />
arrangements made under the taxation structure, giving accelerated<br />
write-off s in respect of farm improvements in these and a<br />
variety of other ways, the Government has sought to encourage<br />
production and to keep the growth of primary industry consistent<br />
with the needs of an expanding nation.<br />
This is the vital task, certainly a task which we could<br />
only ignore at the danger to our national stability, and, indeed,<br />
reaching through to our capacity to provide the resources for<br />
adequate national defenoe.<br />
And so, ladies and gentlemen, the substance of wxhat you<br />
are discussing here today is basic to the welfare of the Australian<br />
community. You will have those expert in a variety of different<br />
directions to talk to you on particular aspects, and at tho<br />
conclusion of the discussion, my olleague, Senator Gorton, who<br />
assists me in the work of the Prime Minister's Department on<br />
education matters as well as the handling of his own portfolio,<br />
will be giving his contribution by way of summation.<br />
in<br />
You may have felt perhaps that/ talking in these rather<br />
general terms, and a little coldly in respect of the statistics<br />
that have been quoted that T, personally, have little far'. iliarity<br />
with what goes on on a typical Australian farm. Wiell, I am glad<br />
to be able to say that I can plead rather more knowledge than that.<br />
Most~ f my boyhood holidays, right up to the time of young manhood<br />
was spent on my grandfather's farm not very far up from where we<br />
are, a little place called Nubba, which is ten miles from Harden<br />
and Murrumburrah, which towns are probably well kn~ own to many<br />
of the people of this area, and it was a Tery valuable apprenticeship<br />
because it vas a mixed farm. It had everything on it but<br />
not much of anything. There were some sheep, a few cattle, there<br />
were pigs, there was an orchard, there were fowls, and the whole<br />
gamut of a small mixed farm production. I used to ride in each<br />
morning for the mail a couple of miles, and then round up the cows<br />
in the evening, and occasionally take a hand at extracting the<br />
milk from the cows in the evening. But quite apart from recalling<br />
these days as amongst the happiest of a lifetime and recalling<br />
that with all its heartaches, anxieties and difficulties, the life<br />
on the land is, I believe, the most richly rewarding of almost any<br />
that could be found in our community. I, at the same time, do<br />
0 0 0 0 4,/ 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
recall the periods of difficulty when we knew drought and when we<br />
could see before us the physical effects, the ravages of diought.<br />
I remember developing some early knowledge of matters anatomical<br />
when there was the weekly slaughtering of the sheep which had to<br />
serve. us as food for the rest of the week. It was lamb's fry the<br />
next morning, chops the day after and salted mutton by the end of<br />
the week for the last two or three days. And so, ladies and<br />
gentlemen, I assure you that when those who speak for primary<br />
industry come to me and put their case, this does not fall on<br />
unreceptive ears nor is there any lack of sympathy or, I hope,<br />
understanding of the problems which those who engage in our<br />
primary industries have to face.<br />
Now here, in the Rural Committee of the Liberal Party, you<br />
have a good illustration of the way our democratic system works<br />
inside our own party structure. There is no dictation to a<br />
parliamentarian from any outside body as to the policy lines he<br />
is to adopt. There is sensible, well-informed discussion, and<br />
arising from that discussion, there are recommendations which come<br />
to us in a Coalition Cabinet. And I believe that the healthy<br />
state of Australian primary industry, as reflected in the figures<br />
that I have mentioned, owes much to the public-spirited work of the<br />
men and women who comprise the Committee inside our own party<br />
orgLanisgation and, of course, who interest themselves in these<br />
matters in the party of our coalition. But our own Rural<br />
Committee has been a strong body virtually throughout the life of<br />
the Liberal Party. It came into existence, I think, Mr. Chairman<br />
in about 1948 or 1949, and the Government has been greatly<br />
influenced over the subsequent years by the thought, the painstaking<br />
thought, the experience and judgment of members of the Rural<br />
Committee which has gone into the recommendations which they have<br />
submitted to us. with<br />
I believe that from this conference,/ tne wealth of talent<br />
that you will be able to drawn on as your discussions proceed,<br />
there will be further valuable recommendations, and I can assure<br />
you that there can be few ' bodies in Australia whose views would<br />
rank more influentially and highly with the Cabinet of this<br />
country than those of the Rural Committee of the Liberal Party.<br />
And so I wish you well in your efforts together, and I<br />
assure you that the product of your thinking will receive the<br />
most earnest consideration of the members of my Government.<br />
I think I have a formal duty before me in declaring the<br />
conference open, so anything that has been said up to this point<br />
of time can be ignored. From now on, officiallythe conference<br />
is open, and I have pleasure in so declaring. </p>
