PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FRENCH DEFENCE MINISTER'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF FEBRUARY<br />
END TO FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING PROGRAM<br />
The French nuclear testing program should never have started and should end<br />
immediately. We do not want fewer tests, we want none.<br />
I welcome the French Government's affirmation of its support for a zero yield<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but it should draw the logical conclusion from<br />
this stance and end testing now. There would be no better way to signal<br />
support for the next round of CTBT negotiations, which will begin soon.<br />
CANBERRA 7 December 1995 </p>
