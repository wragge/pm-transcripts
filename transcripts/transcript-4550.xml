FOR PRESS 2.0. NOVEMBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE. TALK<br />
The election is abotit many things inflation, unemployment,<br />
national development and a secure future for all Australians.<br />
It is also about taxation.<br />
Australian men and women now have a genuine choice genuine optionsbetween<br />
Labor Party policies on taxation and the Government's<br />
policies. This will now be!. a key and central election issue.<br />
Mr. Whitlan has made no bones about his position and policies on<br />
taxation. He will abandon outright our tax reforms and tax<br />
indexation and will even recall Parliament to change the tax<br />
laws. In one stroke, in one desperate ploy, he has challenged the right<br />
of all Australian taxpayers to have the tax yoke removed.<br />
Mr. Whitlam, thunbs his nose at the intelligence and judgement<br />
of Australians. He falls victim to his own rhetoric " We ask<br />
the overwhelming majority of Australians to forego nothing" he<br />
declared. " Nothing" is $ 6 a week for the wage earner on average earnings.<br />
" Nothing" is being pushed back up to 45 cents tax rate for thousands<br />
of Australians.<br />
Our tax reforms have cut $ 3.3 billion from personal income tax over<br />
two years. $ 6.3 billion will be saved over three years. Mr.<br />
Whitlan dismisses this as " nothing". Every Australian taxpayer,<br />
without exception, will benefit from tax indexation and our new<br />
tax reforms which take effect in every pay packet in less than<br />
ten weeks time.<br />
I make the point again. This year alone, a person on average<br />
earnings will be saving $ 6 a week on these two reforms.<br />
Mr. Whitlam clumsily dismisses the 225,000 additional low income<br />
people who will pay no tax at all under our reforms. He will make<br />
them pay tax again.<br />
He dismisses the standard 32 cents rate of taxation universally<br />
applauded that will now apply to nine out of every ten Australians.<br />
Remember he would send thousands of people back to paying 45 cents<br />
in the dollar.<br />
He dismisses the incentive we have given for Australians on average<br />
wages to earn another $ 6,000 without paying an additional cent in<br />
marginal tax. To Mr. Whitlam, a marginal rate of 32 cents is worth<br />
to use his own word " nothing". / It is </p>
<p>-2<br />
It is clear that he knows " nothing" about the concerns of<br />
Australian taxpayers. Incentive, and the freedom to spend<br />
one's own income are " nothing" to the Labor Party.<br />
He would repeal thegreatest tax reforms in Australia's history.<br />
But perhaps that is not surprising from the man whose Government<br />
increased personal income taxes by 125%. Labor is nothing more,<br />
nothing less than a high tax party it has to be, to pay for its<br />
programmes, for its promises.<br />
Last week, Mr. Whitlam unveiled his Party's policies for the<br />
next three years. He was less than forthcoming about the cost<br />
to the Australian taxpayer. He has announced a big spending<br />
programme and nothing he says can hide that reality.<br />
In a replay of the old, failed, policies, Mr. Whitlam proposes<br />
a crash spending programme of $ 800 million in six months, and<br />
an extra $ 1,700 million to end payroll tax. Mr. Whitlam has<br />
been deliberately vague about the precise details of his proposals.<br />
Nevertheless, the cost is vast thousands of millions of dollars.<br />
He wants to bring in national superannuation which could cost<br />
$ 2,000 million; go back to the old Medibank scheme at a cost of<br />
about $ 700 million; take over local Government debt charges at<br />
a cost of about $ 215 million; promote exports at a cost of some<br />
million; take over state country railways at a nett cost of<br />
at least $ 90 million; and give tax deductions for mortgage<br />
interest at a cost of $ 70 million.<br />
Just these-promi-ses-woulid cost more than $ 3,000 million and there<br />
are many more commitments which Mr. Whitlam has made. How does<br />
Mr. Whitlam plan to pay for all these schemes? He can get his<br />
money in two ways. He says he will increase taxes, and it is<br />
clear hewill also have to resort to the printing presses once<br />
again as he did when he had a chance on an earlier occasion.<br />
Either way, it is a return to economic chaos.<br />
We also know from bitter experience how Labor controlled the<br />
nation's finances-or rather, how it failed to control them.<br />
Mr. Whitlam's actualdeficit in 1974/ 75 was almost five times<br />
what he budgeted for as his spending went up by 46% in that one<br />
year. Mr. Whitlam and his Party z . e still the Party of big<br />
spenders and high taxes. They are still promising to spend<br />
something they have not got.<br />
My Government on the other hand will announce policies that the<br />
nation can afford. They will be creative and imaginative<br />
and designed to benefit all Australians. We will promise what<br />
we have already delivere'd and that is sound and solid<br />
policies properly costed, properly planned.<br />
Australia cannot afford and cannot risk the alternative. </p>
