PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 16 DECEMBER 1987<br />
Senator Susan Ryan, the Special Minister of State, has today<br />
informed me of her intention to retire from politics.<br />
I greatly regret that I and the Cabinet will be losing Susan<br />
Ryan's talents. She has brought special perspectives to all her<br />
tasks from her wide range of interests and particularly her long<br />
standing concern with women's issues and education. She has been<br />
a most valued colleague and an effective and articulate Minister<br />
both in the Education portfolio, and latterly, as Special<br />
Minister of State.<br />
Senator Ryan was Education Minister at a time of rapid change and<br />
fundamental reform, in particular the fundamental restructuring<br />
of Commonwealth support arrangements for Australian schools, and<br />
the ending the divisive State aid debate.<br />
Before entering politics, and in Opposition, Senatci:-.<br />
prepared the way for governments to have a special focus on<br />
women's issues and, since the 1983 election, Susan Ryan has held<br />
the position of Minister assisting me on the Status of Women.<br />
Her advocacy has led to the many achievements in this area of<br />
which the Government is justly proud such as the Sex<br />
Discrimination Act and Equal Employment Opportunity and the<br />
Affirmative Action legislation.<br />
Since the election I have also appreciated her-' upport as she<br />
assisted me with specific responsibilities for the Bicentenary as<br />
well as in other matters in my portfolio and in that of the<br />
Minister for Community Services and Health. I am grateful that<br />
she will be carrying out her special Bicentennial tasks<br />
through January 1988.<br />
The ACT, too, is losing a most able and energetic representative.<br />
Susan Ryan was elected as a foundation Senator for the ACT in<br />
1975. She quickly established her credentials within the Caucus<br />
and became a membev of the Shadow Cabinet from 1977, W'brking on<br />
and shaping a range of policies.<br />
Senator Ryan's contvibution to this Government and to the<br />
Australian Labor Party has been very substantial and she has<br />
brouight considerable skills and abilities to the vairiours areas<br />
with which she hiar, been associated. She will be missed by me and<br />
all my colleagues. I wish her every success in her new position<br />
as Publishing Editor for Penguin Australia, to whbich I ami certain<br />
she will, bring the same distinction wh-ich she contribute' to my<br />
Gove rnment.<br />
Senator Ryan's retirement from politics will. take place sometime<br />
before the resumption of the Parliament in the Autumn sittings.<br />
