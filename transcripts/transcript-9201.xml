STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ANZAC DAY<br />
( Embargoed till 12.01 am 25 April 1994)<br />
Since that fateful April day in 1915, a spirit of duty and courage that cannot be<br />
destroyed has been symbolised by what we know as the ANZAC legend.<br />
Wherever Australians or New Zealanders are on this day each year, they gather to pay<br />
tribute to the gallant men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of<br />
their country.<br />
The qualities which have given rise to that legend continue to inspire us today.<br />
So very few of the original ANZACs are still with us in body, but the spirit of them all<br />
survives through the activities of our service men and women on duty abroad,<br />
particularly through our participation in United Nations operations. Courage and duty<br />
are still their watchwords.<br />
Through all the years and all the wars, wherever Australians and New Zealanders have<br />
fought since, that spirit born at Gallipoli has been a bond joining them with the<br />
ANZACs of 1915.<br />
Many commemorations will be held today. When we pause on this day, all our<br />
reflections are the same, no matter how far we may be from home, no matter how<br />
grand or how humble our surroundings: the honour that the AINZACs did to our two<br />
countries, the honour of which we must all try to be worthy.<br />
