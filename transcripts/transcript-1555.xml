ASIAN TOUR 1967 KOREA<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD. HOLT AT SEOUL 9TH APRIL, 1967<br />
I am nearing the end now of this journey I have been making to<br />
four countries in the Asian region first to Cambodia, then Laos, Taiwan<br />
and finally Korea, with stopover visits to Singapore and Hong Kong where I<br />
have been able to have some talks with officials and members of governments<br />
in those places also.<br />
It has been for me a most informative, interesting and indeed<br />
enthralling journey. I shall return to my own country very much better<br />
informed about the countries and peoples I have visited and I hope that since<br />
this involves me as Head of my Governm ent, the effect will be valuable in<br />
the Cabinet discussions and parliamentary discussions in which I shall be<br />
participating from now on.<br />
But there is one over-riding impression that I should like to<br />
pass on to you and it is the feeling of warmth, of friendship wherever we<br />
have gone. These countries differ in size, in history and tradition, in<br />
circumstance, in t heir foreign policies some of them but wherever we<br />
went as representatives of the Australian Government and people, we were<br />
greeted with the warmest of friendship. I did not see a hostile banner, hear<br />
a hostile voice, nor see a hostile look in any one of the countries we visited<br />
at any of the time we were amongst their poeple, and nowhere has this warmth<br />
of friendliness been more evident than in your own country of Korea.<br />
It was immediately apparent when we arrived and were greeted<br />
by those wonderful crowds which turned out to give a welcome to an<br />
Australian Prime Minister and his party and it has been evident wherever<br />
we have moved since. Quite obviously the comradeship which built up<br />
between our two countries in the period of conflict earlier, has laid a basis<br />
for an enduring friendship. Our co-operation in Viet Nam, in such gatherings<br />
as the Manila Conference, ASPAC and other institutions and meetings where<br />
we are able to develop together our common interests in this area of the<br />
world, have promoted that friendship.<br />
I am sure that with my own visit, the contact that I have had with<br />
your distinguished President, Prime Minister, Members of your Government,<br />
senior members of your community, your university and students, people<br />
that I have met as I have moved around all this will have given fresh warmth<br />
to that friendship and will have deepened it I hope for all time to come.<br />
So I feel tremendously gratified at the experience I have had<br />
throughout the journey, particularly here in Korea. I shall return to my<br />
country feeling that this has been a most rewarding, irformative, valuable<br />
journey and with friendships strengthened that will, I hope, endure for the<br />
benefit of the countries visited and certainly for my own.<br />
Now I would like to make some time available to you to put<br />
whatever questions you would wish to me. This will be our only opportunity<br />
together of speaking quite frankly to each other so please do not hesitate to<br />
put the questions you would like to ask. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Q. Press reports have been optimistic lately concerning the war<br />
in Viet Nam. T" ey re desperate and are looking for<br />
a face-saving toj~ ri~ ai~ Do you think Hanoi is<br />
desperate? d tn k A action on the part of the<br />
for oGi" t~ inik: of North Viet Nam, will<br />
accomplish t said all fighting must stop on both sides<br />
before we can accomplish anything.<br />
PM: Well, I am in no position to say whether the Viet Cong or the<br />
North Vietn,-mi--: s-e are desp,--ate or not. I do believe, 7.11 the evidence<br />

The c: esonof bz; through the<br />

nel-otiarir: ns. But I have no conihdence myseh' that an irii: 1eflnite suspension<br />
of bombing would produce an atno,-) phere for negotiations. When it<br />
has been tried prevlously, all that it has done3 is enabled the North<br />
Vietnamese to build up their suapplies and military strength. They<br />
have taken advantage of it to improve their military position and in the<br />
absence of any cl, ar reciprocity, namely, an indication of the willingness<br />
to enter into nozltatic~ ns in good faith, I don't see any advantage from<br />
a suspension of the bombing at this time.<br />
Q. What does Your Excellency think is the best co-operation<br />
between Korea and Australia?<br />
PM: Well, already that co-operation has been evident first in the<br />
assistance we were able to bring to your pe:--pi-e and your forces in their<br />
t ime of need in the crisis of tle 1950' s, and now there 1has been the<br />
co-operation we have had together assisting the South Vietnamese to<br />
resist the communist aggez-; sion with whiclh they are contending. We<br />
are co-operat~ rg for pec. E&amp; rps and for constructive purposes in<br />
such institutions that I have n-: ntionl--1d sitch as ASPAC, the Asian Development<br />
Bark, and other avenues. I am em~ our aged to belil ve that from my<br />
visit today to Uisan and the talks I was able to have with your Deputy<br />
Prime Minister that there will be a growing trade between our two<br />
countries. He spoke in particular of your intention to establish an iron<br />
and steel industry in this couxrtry which woul-i -he likely to require iron ore<br />
from Australia and of your gr~ owing req..-rcrnent for plywood -which would<br />
be devoted to the making of furniture ar. orwher purposes. In these and<br />
other directions, we can look, I think optirnstically, to a growing trade<br />
relations hip between the two coun Li es a -Ad I would hope that arising out<br />
of my own visit and return visits which leaders from your own country<br />
will, I hope, be making to Au-.,.'( ralia, there will be a clos-er relationship<br />
leading to useful coliaboration in areas of security, of diplomatic<br />
collaboration and of growing trade. y. #/ 3 </p>

Q. Reports from Saigon today indicate that the Allied side had<br />
proposed to North Viet Nam for a cease-fire on the occasion of the<br />
Buddhist birthday anniversary next month. Do you think, Mr. Prime<br />
Minister, that this could lead up to a basis for cease-fire negotiations<br />
for enduring peace?<br />
PM: 1 have not heard of such a proposal. . but this is not a<br />
prospect about which I feel optimistic.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister does your Government consider a<br />
possibility of sending more troops to Viet Nam in an effort to bring North<br />
Viet Nam to the negotiating table?<br />
PM: Our troops are in Viet Nam at the invitation of the Government<br />
of South Viet Nam and as requests are received, of course, they are<br />
considered. But it is well known by the Government of South Viet Nam<br />
that Australia has commitments in ct her directions as well and that<br />
Australia is also at this time trying to build up the strength of its own<br />
Regular Army, which involves the use of many regular troops for<br />
instruction purposes. W~ e do also have, for example, forces stationed in<br />
Malaya as part of our commitment in that area of the world with the<br />
Commonwealth Strategic Reserve and, in addition we have, of course, to<br />
assume a responsibility in respect of Papua and New Guinea and our own home<br />
defence so there is not at present time any proposal before the Government<br />
for Increasing the size of its forces. The latest increases have more than<br />
doubled the strength which existed not so very long ago. I may say we have<br />
doubled the provision for defence over the last four years and this now<br />
represents somewhere between 4 to 5 per cent. of the gross national<br />
product. Q. Mr. Prime Minister, what do you think, in your opinion, the<br />
allied troops in Viet Nam should do to win the war or to bring the war to<br />
an early close? Do you favour the escalation, including bombing of the<br />
north, or do you favour descalatlon?<br />
PM: I think these are matters which rest largely on the military<br />
judgment of the people who lead the forces there and I think one can take<br />
up from the results which are now being achieved that the military forces<br />
are operating very effectively. I believe very effectively indeed. I would<br />
not assume myself the responsibility for urging any particular type of<br />
military activity. I think that In my judgment, this is largely a matter on<br />
which one must rest on the advice of our military experts.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, we heard of your rejection of the peace<br />
proposal suggested by U Thant. Do you have any ideas for a settlement<br />
of the war in Viet Nam? If not, what do you think is the best way for early<br />
peace in Viet Nam?<br />
PM: I thought we had made that clear in our Joint Declaration at<br />
Manila. We indicated there the circumstances which we felt just and<br />
reasonable. The criticism I had to offer in it was not directed to Secretary<br />
U Thant or his very well meaning efforts to bring this unhappy business to<br />
a conclusion but I felt that to suspend the bombing without any reciprocity<br />
on the other side was, having regard to our earlier experience, not a<br />
realistic way for us to secure the negotiations we were seeking.<br />
Q. Yesterday, you had discussions with Prime Minister Chung<br />
about trade relations between Korea and Australia. Have you arrived at<br />
any concrete agreement? Please tell us. </p>
<p>4-<br />
PM-. There was not much opportunity yesterday to talk on economic<br />
matters for my talks with the Prime Minister were occupied mainly<br />
in discussions on the Viet Nam issue, as they were later with President<br />
Park. I was interested to have an assessment of the developments in<br />
China and our time was largely taken up with these matters, but in the<br />
course of today's travel, during which I spent a good deal of the time<br />
with the Deputy Prime Minister, we have discussed a variety of<br />
economic matters.<br />
I have already indicated the possibilities of increasing trade<br />
which there seems to be in the future, but we were not conducting<br />
negotiation on a trade agreement or anything of that sort. He did tell<br />
me that an economic mission would be going to Australia with a view<br />
to examining various possibilities there and no doubt holding discussions<br />
with the appropriate people in our trade departments.<br />
Q. Do you have any plan to make ASPAC go rather swinging?<br />
PM: Well, I certainly hope that ASPAC will develop in usefulness<br />
but I am not in a position to indicate any special direction at this time.<br />
My Foreign Minister would have been giving his personal attention to<br />
this and he will be meeting representatives of your own Government<br />
at the meeting of representatives of friendly forces in Washington, as<br />
indeed no doubt they will have met at ECAFE also. He left Australia<br />
shortly before I did and I do not know what account he has to give of<br />
these discussions, but we have welcomed the formation of ASPAC and so<br />
far as we are concerned we shall be doing what we can to make it a<br />
worthwhile corporation.<br />
Q. In Hong Kong and Taipei you were asked questions about<br />
A-ustralia's immigration control and in your reply you pointed out that<br />
there had been considerable liberalisation during the past twenty years<br />
and the Australian Government policy was understood by the Asian<br />
Governments. in the light of this would you comment on charges by one<br />
of your Government colleagues the other day that Australia's controls<br />
were highly discriminatory. He put forward the proposal that Ascia should<br />
go out and join ( rest of question indistinct)<br />
PM: Well, I have not seen any text of any such proposal anct indeed,<br />
if there are people of Asian extraction who become naturalised Australians,<br />
they are eligible to join the forces for National Service legislation now<br />
applies to aliens as well, as you would know. But it may be of interest<br />
seeing that I did make a statement when this question was first put to<br />
me, that it occupies a greater prominence in the minds of the pressmen<br />
than of the Governments who are, I think, well understanding of the<br />
reasons for policy and who, in their own countries, administer policy<br />
relating to immigration from other countries, that not one government<br />
representative has raised this matter with me in any of the four countries<br />
that I have visited.<br />
Can I just add, for the information of our Korean friends here,<br />
some of the details which I gave to a question relating to immigration<br />
policy when it was asked earlier at the two places Mr. Ramsey has<br />
mentioned. Since the war, some 3C, C0O people have been admitted to<br />
Australia who would not have been eligible for admission under the rules<br />
which previously applied. He spoke of some liberalisation of our / 3 </p>
<p>1 b ( MR. HOLT Contd. immigration policy. More than 6, 000 have qualified<br />
for full naturalisation and early in my own term as Prime Minister, I<br />
brought the period of qualification of naturalisation for Asian citizens<br />
into line with that which applies to those residents of Australia from<br />
other countries as well. There are also currently in Australia some<br />
12, 000 students from various countries of Asia in our colleges and<br />
universities and I am certain that if any of you have the opportunity to<br />
come to Australia or to visit Australia you will be agreeably surprised<br />
not only at the degree of friendship shown to you but the absence of any<br />
discrimination practised against people of any other race from our own.<br />
Q. At the conference yesterday with Prime Minister Chung, were<br />
there any discussions on assistance to reconstruction in Viet Nam? If<br />
there were any please point out something concrete and also was there<br />
any discussion about additional troop despatch from Korea to Viet Nam?<br />
PM: I think you will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to<br />
give details of confidential discussions which were held between us, but<br />
as to the first part of your question, I can just put the answer quite<br />
broadly. Our forces there are engaged in work of civic action and there<br />
is, on Australia's part, as I have no doubt there is on the part of Korea<br />
also, aid given in addition to the work of civic action by the armed forces.<br />
I have no doubt that if we could secure a peace settlement that there would<br />
be a good deal of reconstruction to be carried out in South Viet Nam<br />
and Australia would hold itself willing, as no doubt Korea would also, to<br />
give assistance in the work of peace just as we have felt glad to give<br />
assistance to meet the crisis of war.<br />
As to the reference to troops from Korea, that matter was not<br />
raised by me and any announcement which your own Government has to<br />
make on this matter would come appropriately from them. </p>
