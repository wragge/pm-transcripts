PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
ASSASSINATION OF YITZHAK RABIN<br />
I was left incredulous upon learning of the death of Yitzhak Rabin. He was a<br />
real leader looking for lasting peace. But apart from the great loss, his death<br />
by violence punctures the dream of Jewish people everywhere that Israel is a<br />
place of sanctuary, a place where people pay each other due regard and<br />
respect, a place where, above all else, human rights and human happiness is<br />
the foundation of the society.<br />
This assassin has done more than rob us all of Yitzhak Rabin. He has<br />
cheated the Jewish people of the security of these beliefs to which so many<br />
people have dedicated themselves.<br />
On behalf of all Australians, I express profound condolences to the family of<br />
Mr Rabin and to the Government and people of Israel. I have sent a<br />
message of condolence to the acting Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Peres.<br />
Yitzhak Rabin's vision, strength and commitment were instrumental to<br />
achieving the breakthrough in the peace process. His death is a tragedy for<br />
Israel, the Middle East and the world.<br />
The best way the world can honour Mr Rabin is to push ahead with the work<br />
he began. For Australia's part, we will continue to give our full support to the<br />
peace process. Our support for Israel's right to exist in security and safety will<br />
remain a guiding principle of our policy.<br />
CANBERRA November 1995 </p>
