Australia. Mrs. Gandhi represents a great nation and a great people<br />
Australia attaches high importance to its relations with India and to<br />
co-operation between the two countries, and Mrs. Gandhi will find great<br />
friendship here among the Australian people no less than on the part of<br />
the Australian Government. I hope that during her visit she will be able<br />
to meet a wide range of Australians.<br />
