ELECTORAL TALK<br />
As the first session of Federal Parliament is now completed<br />
for this year, the time is appropriate to broadly review<br />
progress. The record majority in the House of Representatives for the<br />
Coalition at the last federal election was largely a cry<br />
for help.<br />
The people of this country had simply asked us to get Australia<br />
back on its feet aga-in and in tune with the major economies<br />
of the world.<br />
The Coalition Government had inherited record inflation and record<br />
levels of unemployment. That was plain for all to see. We also<br />
inherited record and wasteful Government spending, an unparalleled<br />
Federal Government deficit,-record interest rates and an<br />
extraordinary and des-tructive growth in money supply.<br />
Now just six months, the Government has laid the foundations<br />
for economic stability and has paved the way for a return to<br />
growth and productivity.<br />
This has not happened by a quirk of history. It is the result<br />
of a number of decisive and responsible economic management decisions.<br />
First, the Governmnent moved to cut back on excessive and wasteful<br />
Government spending. We moved to.
Government.<br />
We also imposed growth limits on the Federal Public Service with<br />
great success, and without personal hardship.<br />
We moved to halt the runaway supply of money that was a feature of<br />
the previous administration's economic policies. We have done this<br />
without a credit squeeze and without losing the confidence<br />
of the business community or the consumers.<br />
The weakest feature of the national economy in the past two years<br />
has been business investment. Businessmen had been caught between<br />
the millstones of rising inflation and spiralling wage costs.<br />
The Coalition Govern-ment has acted to remove that millstone. </p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago the independent Arbitration Commission was<br />
influenced by Government argument that all salary and wage<br />
earners should not receive the full consumer price index rise.<br />
The Commission limited the rise to those earning up to<br />
each week. A flat $ 3.80 was paid to all other wage and salary<br />
earners. The Commission was convinced by the Government arguments that<br />
further steep wage rises would unnecessarily fuel the inflationary<br />
pressures. Of course, the Government has taken a number of measures to<br />
restore the ailing manufacturing sector.<br />
In fact, one of our first decisions in Government was to set up<br />
an Economic Consultative Group to monitor trends in the private<br />
business world and report these trends speedily to the Government.<br />
This move has been very successful.<br />
We also looked closely at the role of the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission. And at the factors that must be considered by the<br />
Commission when it presents its reports.<br />
Another of the measures the Government has taken to get manufacturing<br />
moving forward again has been the suspension of quarterly tax<br />
installments. Businessmen no longer have the burden of finding<br />
cash sums each three months. They can now-plan over a ] 2 month<br />
period without loss of liquidity throughout the year.<br />
The cvernment's 40% investment allowance is again aimed at giving<br />
the businessmen particularly those who invest in plant and<br />
machinery real incentive to make expansionary plans.<br />
Additionally, the Gover." ment has laid down clear and sensible<br />
guideiines for the inflow of foreign money and foreign expertise.<br />
This measure was aimed directly at getting Australian business<br />
back in business again.<br />
The Government is also reviewing the trade practices legislation<br />
with the view to removing the crippling red tape and controls<br />
that servicenp-useful purpose and that stifle meaningful expansion<br />
plans by companies.<br />
Overall, business leaders are now able to invest with much more<br />
confidence, knowing that Government will make responsible economic<br />
decisions. The Government's much debated medibank reforms are further evidence of<br />
our desire to assist those most in need. It also provides choice<br />
for all Australians as to the type of health care they require.<br />
Oome of the reports on the way in which medibank will operate have<br />
confused many Australians.<br />
Le me set the record straiqht. </p>
<p>fedibank remains. It will be available for every Australian.<br />
It will continue to provide high quality health care insurance.<br />
There will be no means test at all.<br />
Australians on lowest incomes and those wholly dependent on<br />
pensions will not have to make any payments under the arrangements<br />
we are i ntroducing. Their right to the full medibank benefit<br />
without cost remains.<br />
For those who will be contributing to health care that means the<br />
vast majority of Australians there are now four clear options<br />
available.<br />
These options are factually and concisely explained in a pamnphlet<br />
now available throughout Australia.<br />
Australians do not need to make an immediate decision-on which<br />
form of health cover they desire. The new meansures will not<br />
come into effect until October 1.<br />
This session has also been notable for other significant<br />
Government decisions.<br />
We have moved to est~ tblish a Commonwealth Ombudsman; wqe set up<br />
a House of Representatives Expenditure Committee that will<br />
improve the capacity of the House to scrutinise public expenditure;<br />
we set up a Government Members Parliamentary Reform Committee<br />
that will examine all aspects of the parliamentary process.<br />
In the important areas of international relations we have moved<br />
to rebuild friendships with long established allies, particularly<br />
th' 2i United States. forthcoming visit to China and Japan<br />
also underscored the Li-oortance my Government places in maintaining<br />
and developing relationships with these two nations.<br />
Australia is now entering a critical period in its recovery.<br />
The forthcoming round table sesssion of talks between the Government<br />
and the trade union -movement and later between the Government<br />
and employer organisations will be an important milestone in<br />
our efforts to achieve economic stability.<br />
The Federal G~ adrnment's August budget will also be crucial to<br />
the nations economic recovery.<br />
officials and ministers are already at work planning and<br />
developing a budgetthat will play its part in our overall recovery.<br />
Government's however cannot do it all. Businessmen, trade union<br />
leaders, rank and file trade unionists, and Australian families<br />
all have a special part to play.<br />
The fight against inflation and unemployment is not one for the<br />
Government alone. It demands the support and sympathy of all<br />
Australians who care for the future of their country.<br />
For all of us the great national tasks remain to be completed.<br />
We have only just began. </p>
