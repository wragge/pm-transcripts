EMBARGOED UNTIL 7.15 P. M. 15TH ILOVEMBER, 1966<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST NO.<br />
3Y THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
Education is important to every Australian and<br />
vital to the nation. Under the Federal Constitution education<br />
is listed as a responsibility of the States, but, a share<br />
of responsibility has been t'aken by a number of authorities<br />
and each has its part to play.<br />
In recent years the Commonwealth jovernment has<br />
come into the picture in a more direct fashion. It has,<br />
for a much longer time, helped the States by the growing<br />
size of the -eneral grants made from Commonwealth revenues.<br />
These are male available to the States each year, without<br />
any strings attached. They are the largest source of<br />
State revenue. In the last Budget introduced by a Labor Jovernment,<br />
the . rant was 141 million. Last year it was ; 757 millions,<br />
and This year it will be ' 817 millions. A factor in<br />
determining the size of the grant to each State is the<br />
growth in that State's population. Since most of the<br />
population increase consists of children, the States<br />
automatically gain more finance each year for education.<br />
The States have substantially increased their<br />
own expenditure on education. This has risen from<br />
.92 millions in 1950-51 to .: 594 millions in 1965-66<br />
more than a six-fold increase.<br />
Education is the biggest item in the Budget of<br />
any State, and accounts for approximately one-third of<br />
that State's expenditure.<br />
But the Commonwealth in addition to providing<br />
increasing general revenue for the States, has greatly<br />
increased its own expenditure on specific forms of<br />
education. In 1960-61, we soent "' 49.7 millions. Last year<br />
this had grown to -125.2 millions. This year it will be<br />
':, 155.8 millions. Included in this total are grants to the States<br />
for universities which take un about one-third of the<br />
total. Nearly -20 millions will go to the Australian<br />
National University and more than .25 millions for<br />
assistance to Australian students, mainly through<br />
Commonwealth Scholarships. The remainder is made up<br />
with such items as grants for technical schools, grants<br />
for science facilities, research projects, colleges of<br />
advanced education and international aid, which enable<br />
many students from overseas to have the benefit of<br />
education in Australia.<br />
WThen we came into office there were 30,000 stadents<br />
at our universities and university colleges. Today there<br />
are 92,000 the number has trebled in seventeen years </p>
<p>-2-<br />
while the population has increased by less than half.<br />
In our first year, full-time teachin and research staff<br />
at the universities was 1,296 one or every t;, enty-four<br />
students. Today there are 5.600 or one for every<br />
sixteen students. Ours the first Government to<br />
introduce special tax allowances to parents for education<br />
expenses. This impressive record is surely proof of our<br />
sincere desire to do what we can in this field.<br />
jie now -vropose further assistance to education.<br />
Here are some highlights<br />
8 million a year over the next three<br />
financial years for the construction mand<br />
equipment of new colleges for teacher<br />
training throughout Australia. At least<br />
ten per cent of the places at these<br />
colleges are to be reserved for teachers not<br />
bonded to State Education Departments.<br />
intend to double the amount available to<br />
independent schools for science laboratories.<br />
So important has the Commonwealth's provision for<br />
education become and so highly do we desire an education<br />
system adequate lor the strenth and welfare of the nation,<br />
that we will establish for the first time in Federal<br />
history, a Commonwealth Ministry of Education and Science.<br />
( This talk will be broadcast by the A. J. C.<br />
inter-state network at 7.15 Tuesday,<br />
November, 1966) </p>
