0: lIn't the real point about un plmolmant, 10 per cent<br />
regardless is unacceptable for yuu and the adult<br />
population?<br />
PM: Absolutely, and I think ABC radio have done me a<br />
disservice in nvt running my full quotation which was to<br />
explain that these sort of gloomy projections of 46 per<br />
cent youth unempoyinunt are not correct, that aDout<br />
per cent t-ttrv u high and that's why I'm focussing On<br />
this national meeting to see what we can do to get young<br />
people back to work. That i, open up job and training<br />
opportunities for them and at the same time open up<br />
training opportunities by the modernisation of the<br />
technical and further education system. There are two<br />
chances for a young Australian, that ls, to train<br />
themselves or tv find work in places where other people<br />
are prepared to train them so that the sort of dead-end<br />
job whioh come people, particularly In the Liberal Party<br />
are now lonqiziq for, in a thing of the pest * nd that<br />
Australian kids leaving school, it they train<br />
themselves, can find work in the new kind of Order we<br />
have in the sognomy,<br />
J3 Don't you think the fact that high unemployment and the<br />
youth factor is just one Of the painful results of the<br />
structural change that you are talking about?<br />
PM; No, I don't think that is true. Zn part It Is. When I<br />
was a teenaVec there were plenty of unskilled jobs, but<br />
in the economy we have today the unskilled jobs are<br />
disappearing ano skilled jobs are appearing and that's<br />
why the emphasis must now be on treining and skills,<br />
But for those kid* who did leave school and have not had<br />
trilntng, what I'm opsiig from national discussions is<br />
that we can open up opportunities for kids to get on the<br />
job training so they can get work experience an*<br />
training, give them that hope. They need to feel that<br />

2<br />
they are wonted, they're in the work force and as well<br />
as that they can move on to other things.<br />
J: Training is not a substitute for wages is it?<br />
PM; We are looking at training wages. The Chsrmichael<br />
report Is about that very topic. That Is, what we can<br />
do to encourage employers to take on people who have<br />
left school, pay them wages, but at the same time give<br />
them training opportunities. And it holds great<br />
promise.<br />
J: Now I&amp; it that these figures are exaggerated?<br />
PM: Just the simple misunderstanding that people don't<br />
understand that when they refer to exaggerated claims<br />
about the likes of 50 per cent youth unemployment.<br />
They're talking not about the age cohort 15-19 as a<br />
grouping, they're talking about those actually in the<br />
work force looking for work and that's a different<br />
vategorioation.<br />
J; They are still out of work though aren't they?<br />
PM: Absolutely, and that's What we're trying to do move<br />
them back into work, give them work experience and<br />
training. But that won't be done at the moment simply<br />
letting market forces decide it.<br />
Js there could be an over-educated work force?<br />
PM: No, that was the way the Liberal Party thought in the<br />
and ' 70s, that what we neetd to an under-educated<br />
work force. In the early 19808 three children In ten<br />
completed secondory school, that is now eight in ten,<br />
35-40 per cent or those are now going to universities<br />
in the 120,000 university places created by this<br />
government. Now in the 1980. when the economy was<br />
growing those kids were taken up in trained jobs an they<br />
will be taken up in the 1990a, but they won't be taken<br />
up unskillod.<br />
J: What's your reaction to Mr Crean's proposal that the<br />
youth unemployed should be utillsed on the land?<br />
PM: It's not Mr Crean's proposal exclusively, but he has<br />
looked at some options in land cars which may be useful<br />
in reglonal or urban environments whefe industrial<br />
opportunities are not available. That Will be one of<br />
the subjects we will be looking at, at this national<br />
discussion.<br />
0: Pr me Minister, Is the inflation culture now reaching a<br />
stage where it may be conduced to another reduction in<br />
Interest rates?<br />
PM: I don't discuss interest rates at doorstops. </p>
<p>TEL: j 1. u n. I: J Ho'. 019 F. C' 17<br />

J; Is the high unemployment rate jeopardising the ' One<br />
Notion' growth forecast?<br />
Pm: 2 No, I CQfl't think so. The economy I@ picking up as I<br />
think you heard at this business lunch. People ore<br />
saying that thero to a feeling about growth returning,<br />
there is more confidence around in the business<br />
community. it is regionalised, admittedly, it's m'oe<br />
prevalent In NSW, QLD and WA then perhaps it Is In VlIC<br />
or Indeed in SA. But it is returning I think, and as it<br />
does we will see the economy gather speed through the<br />
course of the year 192-93.<br />
is Westpoo consumer confidence survey released today shows<br />
that consumer confidence has fallen nine points in June<br />
wipingV out all the gains of ' 92, What's your reaction to<br />
that?<br />
PM-. 1 1 nuva to have a look at It to see what It Is, when It<br />
was taken and what circumstances it was taken in, but<br />
these thtings move up and down. sy end large I think<br />
we've had reasonably strong retail sales figures<br />
recently and they're the best indication of the lot.<br />
3: at 5.2 per cent In that westpto survey are you<br />
worried about that?<br />
PM: Again, I would need to have a look at It. If it was<br />
taken after the Premiers' Conference when the Premiers<br />
of NSW and VIC annou1nced price increases, tax increases<br />
that could hove well changed the sample by that degree.<br />
But I think it's the trend declines which matter and the<br />
Inflationary expvvtotions trend series over the last<br />
twenty years shows inflationary expectations of<br />
Australia now at Its lowest levels since the 19609.<br />
