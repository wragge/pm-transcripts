    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with profound sadness that I inform the House that a helicopter carrying Coalition forces went down in Khandahar province in Afghanistan today.</p>
<p>There were ten Australian servicemen on board.</p>
<p>It's my sad responsibility to inform the House that three Australian Commandos from the Special Operations Task Group have been killed.</p>
<p>Seven other Australian servicemen are wounded, two of them very seriously.</p>
<p>This is a tragic day for Australia and for the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>It is a day of the deepest sorrow for the friends and families of those who have lost their loved ones in this tragedy.</p>
<p>I express to all of them the deepest condolences of the Australian Government and the Australian people.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are also with those who have been wounded.</p>
<p>I want them and their families to know that they will receive the best possible medical care.</p>
<p>This tragedy brings to sixteen those Australians who have lost their lives serving our country in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>This is a very heavy price to pay, particularly for the families of those brave Australians who have lost their lives.</p>
<p>We know our mission in Afghanistan is hard, but this mission is critical for our common security.</p>
<p>We work alongside our allies from the United States and from other NATO countries to avoid Afghanistan once again becoming a breeding ground for terrorists who can then strike at innocent Australians both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>It is our nation's highest calling to wear the uniform of Australia.</p>
<p>Those who wear it do outstanding work for Australia and they do that outstanding work in this most difficult, demanding and dangerous of environments.</p>
<p>Today we recall their service as we mourn the loss of some of Australia's finest.</p>
<p>The commitment, the dedication and sacrifice of those soldiers will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>It will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>All Australians owe them a debt of gratitude for their service and for their sacrifice.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families and friends of those who have fallen.</p>
<p>We mourn them, we pay tribute to them, we pay tribute to them having paid the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. </p>
