PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY PETER BOWERS. 19 AUGUST 1978~~~~<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister is this a fair summary of your<br />
overriding Budget strategy: inflation is to be driven down<br />
to the point where Australia, compared with its major trading<br />
partners, such as the Britain and Europe, becomes<br />
highly attractive for foreign investment which, with lower<br />
domestic interest rates, will stimulate investment, creating<br />
new industries, new Jobs, and lift Australia out of the recession?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's certainly one of the objectives, but<br />
it would be too much to say that is the sole objective,<br />
because getting inflation down and getting interest rates<br />
down would also be of very significant importance to all<br />
domestic investments, to all domestic investors. We are<br />
not necessarily looking at great large resource projects<br />
alone, because as interest rates come down that will provide<br />
a great stimulus to the home building industry. I have used<br />
the figures before. The 2% reduction involves about $ 10 a<br />
week for an average young couple borrowing an average loan<br />
for their first home. And therefore a general reduction in<br />
interest rates accompanying further falls in inflation is,<br />
I think, the best possible thing that can provide, if you<br />
like use the word'stimulus* for the whole Australian economy.<br />
But the point you make, about making this country more<br />
attractive for investors from overseas, is also a highly<br />
relevant one. We are a resource rich country. The world<br />
needs many of the resources that Australia has. To that<br />
extent we are a lucky country. It is up to us to take<br />
advantage of that, put ourselves in a position in which we<br />
can much better withstand any difficulties in world trade<br />
that might come, and certainly take advantage of any<br />
opportunities that are open to us.<br />
QUESTION: The problem with an investment led recovery,<br />
if that is what it's to be in part, is that it takes time.<br />
Meanwhile what is going to happen to unemployment? Do you<br />
maintain, as you did during the election campaign, that<br />
unemployment will continue to fall steadily?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I first want to say something about the<br />
term " investment led recovery". I think " investment led",<br />
" consumer led", these terms give a false picture of what<br />
the Government is about. To have full recovery you have<br />
got to get all the basic underlying factors in the economy<br />
right, and then a number of things start to occur. It's<br />
not just investment. In those circumstances consumers also<br />
have more confidence. So it's a question of getting the main<br />
elements, the relativities in the economy right, and then<br />
your whole economy, your nation, starts to move forward.<br />
Talking about " investment led" or " consumer led" is putting<br />
too simple a view on it in a way that I think is not meant<br />
to be, but in a way that can be misleading. Major resource<br />
projects can, of course, take a considerable time to<br />
implement, but I made the point that we are not just talking<br />
about major resource projects when we are talking about<br />
making this country more attractive for investment and<br />
development. It doesn't take all that long, when it's within<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>their financial grasp, for a couple to make up their mind<br />
that they qo want to build or buy a home. And across a<br />
wide spectrum of Australian industry things can start to<br />
move, I think more rapidly, than your question indicated.<br />
There is one other factor in the economy which I think is<br />
highly relevant to our circumstances and which ought not to<br />
be overlooked. I'd like to mention it here. For many<br />
years rural industries have been depressed. You have had<br />
occassions when sheep prices have been good, or cattle<br />
prices good, but it might be ten or fifteen years you<br />
might have to go back to the relatively early 1960' s to<br />
find a time when seasons looked good, sheep and wool prices<br />
were good, as they now are: beef prices have come out of<br />
their trough and everyone is much more confident about the<br />
medium and longer term future of that industry. With the<br />
exception of those who have had too much rain, wheat prospects<br />
are good, and the dairy industry itself is in a little less<br />
gloomy position. So Australia's, a number of Australia's<br />
major rural industries are all facing the future with a<br />
degree of optimism that hasn't been around for a long whilep<br />
and also they're facing the prospects of very good seasons.<br />
Now I have always believed that the influence of rural industries<br />
on our domestic economy has been underestimated. When the<br />
rural sector is depressed it has been very difficult to<br />
have a fully heo, 1+ 6 coom j in other respects. When the<br />
rural industries start to move forward that has an impact on<br />
country towns, it has an impact on manufacturing industry<br />
and activity generally within Australia. And this again is<br />
one of the reasons why I am looking to the future with a good<br />
deal of optimism.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, in terms of social equity the higher<br />
taxes on beer, cigarettes, spirits can be jsutified because<br />
you don't have to smoke or drink. Even the tax surchar_ 5e is<br />
fair in that it falls on people who at least have jobs. But<br />
how do you justify the social equity of taxing the eight<br />
categories of pensioners, including the blind and sufferers<br />
of pulmonary tuberculosis? Are things so bad that you have to<br />
squeeze five million dollars out of these unfortunate people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think you need to look at this in the total<br />
context of what has happened to the taxation of pensions and<br />
income supplements in recent years. There has been a general<br />
move to the taxation of all income support payments, for most<br />
of them anyway, in the Social Welfare area. Some of those<br />
categories that you mentioned are already taxed if the person<br />
is over pensionable age, but not taxed if a person is under<br />
pensionable age. There seems to be a degree of inconsistency<br />
in that. It's worth noting that the tax will not fall on those<br />
most in need those only dependant upon the pension but will<br />
only affect those with additional income. The whole move to<br />
tax income supplements, I think, needs to be looked at as part<br />
of a concerted effort to make sure that support payments coming<br />
from the Commonwealth, from taxpayers, are concentrated on those<br />
most in need. It is very easy to have generalised payments that<br />
go to everyone. But if you do that the payments, if they are<br />
to be kept within our capacity to pay, tend to be much smaller / 3 </p>
<p>than would be necessary to meet the real needs of those who<br />
have nothing but the pension payment.<br />
QUESTION: The scrapping of Medibank Standard will mean an<br />
additional cost of more than $ 300 million to the Budget<br />
in a full year, and consequently runs against the tightfisted<br />
thrust of the Budget. If the deficit is so important,<br />
why scrap Medibank Standard this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are two reasons for this. The Medibank<br />
arrangments existing up to the time of the Budget were<br />
certainly complicated, and I think that complication was one<br />
of the factors which have concerned many people over the last<br />
year or two. We believe that the proposed arrangements are<br />
better, simpler, more effective. A standard service will be<br />
provided by the Commonwealth to everyone that maintains<br />
a universal health cover. Going back to our commitment before<br />
the election of 1975, the commitment we made then was to<br />
maintain Medibank certainly, but Medibank to me to the<br />
Government is universal health cover for all Australians.<br />
There is no sanctity in a particular method in providing<br />
that, because obviously with escalating health costs one<br />
has to change as circumstances change and meet whatever<br />
develops. The universality of health cover is of course<br />
the factor that distinguishes what's been available in recent<br />
times and what we will be continuing to provide.\. 4th the<br />
pre-1972 health care, which was not universal, it depended<br />
upon voluntary insurance. So, I make the point universality<br />
of cover is maintained. We'think it is simpler# The Commonwealth<br />
will be providing basic services, especially hospital cover,<br />
and then it is up to individuals to decide whether they<br />
want to insure for intermediate and private ward treatment<br />
where they can get the doctors of their choice, or whdther<br />
they want to insure for the gap in relation to ordinary medical<br />
services. But there are other reasons why we made the change.<br />
I think you've got to say the principle one was the nature<br />
of the service itself and I am delighted to see that most<br />
commentators I've seen since the Budget seem to have been<br />
saying that the changes are a significant improvement.<br />
But let me come to the other reasonst If Medibank with the<br />
leyy had been maintained, we would have had to increase the<br />
levy, we would have had to increase the ceiling. The way<br />
Medibank fell out for very small monetary return had very<br />
very significant Consumer Price Index effects. We didn't<br />
want to make changes that were going to put, in the<br />
Government's view, a completely false jump into the Consumer<br />
Price Indexbecause so much of our efforts and initiatives<br />
have been directed to getting infaltion down, and in that we<br />
have been successful. The forecasts for the future indicate<br />
greater success. The effect of Medibank, as it was, on<br />
the Consumer Price Index, was something that the statistician<br />
determined beyond control of Government, but it was a<br />
supporting factor in our decision.<br />
QUESTION: So you have done a sort of cost of living tradeoff,<br />
have you? You have scrapped Medibank Standard which will<br />
reduce the C. P. I. by a couple of percentage points, which </p>
<p>in effect will offset any rise that will occur from the higher<br />
excises on beer, cigarettes and spirits and the higher cost<br />
of petrol.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wel, there is one other element that you didn't<br />
mention in the question the reduction in sales tax on cars also<br />
has a significant impact on the Consumer Price Index in a<br />
favourable direction, I think of about h percent. So the<br />
Medibank decisions, the reduction of sales tax on cars from 27%<br />
to 15%, more than offsets the effect of excise increases on<br />
beer, cigarettes and tobacco. On our estimates, the overall<br />
favourable impact on the Consumer Price. Index on this Budget<br />
should be about h percent. In other words the Consumer Price<br />
Increase impact in December should be 1 percent less than it<br />
would otherwise be.<br />
QUESTION: Are. you. saying that although Medibank Standard has<br />
been scrappedyou have replaced it with a universal subsidy<br />
scheme and there is free standard ward hospital service, so<br />
therefore you have not broken your unqualified undertaking<br />
given in the 1975 election campaign that Medibank would be<br />
maintained?<br />
PRI22 IiINIS LER: I have said that categorically. But I have to explain<br />
what is meant by Medibank: universal health cover showing special<br />
concern for the poor people in our community, the disadvantaged<br />
people in our community. That is the distinguishing feature<br />
between all the variations of health service since 1972 and what<br />
was there before 1972. One can look at it another way:<br />
It's certainly not possible to say with any degree of sense<br />
that Medibank is the health services commission or the<br />
public servants administering the service. It's the nature<br />
the service avollable to the people of Australia that is<br />
involved in this, and universal health care remains.<br />
QUESTION: So this is Medibank Mark III, Fraser version. How<br />
lon-gbefore Medibank Mark IV, Fraser version?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well there you do one of the things which I<br />
always object to to a certain extent. In a Medibank Mark III,<br />
if you want to call it that I have no objection to that, but<br />
then you say " Fraser version."<br />
QUESTION: Is it a Fraser Government version perhaps?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That would be more accurate, but the decisions<br />
of government are decisions of government. I have forgotten<br />
which journal it was, but I noted on one occasion that a<br />
Minister made an announcement which was a very proper one<br />
I wasn't associated in any way with the announcement-but the<br />
headlines said, if my recollection is correct, " Fraser says".<br />
I think there is too much personalisation, it's a horrible<br />
word, of politics.<br />
QUESTION: If we don't call it the Fraser Government, what<br />
should we call it? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Fraser Government is all right, but you said<br />
-Fraser version'<br />
QUESTION: Incidentally, what is to happen to more than a<br />
thousand Medibank staff whose jobs are to become redundant<br />
because you have already placed a new ceiling on the public<br />
service to reduce it by a further 1500 by next June<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Obviously there are problems of employment,<br />
in the staff ceilings decisions of recent times the<br />
Public Service Board, I think, has been quite skilful in<br />
redeploying people. our policy is to achieve our ceilings<br />
without retrenchments through wastage and resignations.<br />
QUESTION: You have made an overriding commitment to tax<br />
reduction, in fact I think it would be fair to say you've<br />
made it the lynchpin of your political philosophy. The<br />
tax surcharge claws back much of the tax cuts that you<br />
introduced only on February 1, and therefore must be a<br />
bitter blow to you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It was disappointing to have to do it, but<br />
I'd like to make two points. We introduced tax indexation<br />
to make governments honest. Without tax indexation, through<br />
inflation, government gets a larger share of revenue year<br />
after year after year. We wanted a situation in which if<br />
governments needed more revenue they would have to legislate<br />
for it, justify it, just as we are doing with that tax<br />
surcharge. I believe that our policy is working, and I'd<br />
sooner have to do that, and state it publicly and openly,,<br />
than by doing it by the hidden processes of inflation. The<br />
other point I would like to make, two other points If it<br />
wasn't for the estimates that went awry at the time of the<br />
last Budget, the tax base would have been higher and it<br />
wouldn't have been necessary.) 6ut two things underestimation<br />
of PAYE tax refunds and over estimation of non-PAYE tax collectionsthese<br />
two things led to a shortfall of $ 700 million of the<br />
approaching $ 1000 million shortfall in revenue in the course<br />
of the last year. It lowered the tax base, and without that<br />
I don't believe this surcharge would have been necessary;<br />
But the other point,. the final point, is that if you took<br />
the scales that were operating,-the Hayden scales, and if<br />
they'd been operating unchanged through to this year and<br />
operating this year, in this year alone taxpayers would be<br />
paying $ 3 billion more than they will be even with the<br />
surcharge. So that emphasises, in quite categoric terms,<br />
that there has been an enormous advantage to individual<br />
Australians, all taxpayers, as a result of our tax reforms.<br />
That's further evidenced by the fact that over the last two<br />
years, including this year, and including the surcharge, the<br />
growth of tax revenues from income tax will be growing less<br />
quickly than incomes. In many years, leading up to the last<br />
two, tax receipts from income have grown more rapidly than<br />
income itself.<br />
QUESTION: Do you reaffirm your unqualified undertaking that<br />
so-called " full indexation" will be fully restored after this<br />
f inancial year? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: That's as the legislation is, and there is<br />
certainly no proposal to alter it.<br />
QUESTION: Do you give an unqualified undertaking that this<br />
1 surcharge will not be extended beyond June 30, 1979?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can't make judgements about the way in<br />
wqhich the figures will fall out for the next Budget. I<br />
believe we'll be in a significanlty improving position.<br />
For example next year, because rural incomes will be better<br />
this year, tax from rural areas will obviously be up;<br />
I would expect tax from companies to be up because of a better<br />
situation for companies this year, and that effects revenue<br />
next year as you would know I think we will be in a better<br />
revenue position next year. obviously it would be irresponsible<br />
to make judgements about the next Budget. Let me only say that<br />
the legislation we are going to introduce about the surcharge<br />
will expire at the end of this financial year, and whatever<br />
revenue we need to collect next year will have to be justified<br />
against the facts.<br />
QUESTION: You refer to last year's aggregate estimates of<br />
expenditure and revenue going awry. Presumably....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not of expenditure, expenditure was pretty<br />
much on line. It was some estimates of revenue collections<br />
that led to the major discrepancy.<br />
QUESTION: O. K. Presumably the same officals who prepared<br />
last year's estimates prepared this year's. How can we be<br />
any more confident that this year's figures won't go awry,<br />
and that next year you'll be in just as much trouble and<br />
have to extend the surcharge?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that the officials would have<br />
worked over the figures with even more meticulous care and<br />
concern than they do on every occasion. They wouldn't<br />
want the same mistake again. The Government certainly wouldn't.<br />
* Mistake' is too harsh a word the same error in estimatior<br />
again and the Government certainly would not. But I've given<br />
you the reasons, John Howard has given the reasons in more<br />
detail as to why there was a shortfall in revenue. I think<br />
a number ci those circumstances were particular in relation<br />
to the last year. Again let me point to rural incomes and<br />
company incomes through the course of this year I believe<br />
next year we should be in a better position.<br />
QUESTION: Perhaps the Prime Minister worked over some officials<br />
to make sure they paid more attention to their aggregate<br />
figures this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This was in the area of the Treasury's<br />
responsibility, and I think you are underestimating the<br />
degree of consciousness of the public servants involved in<br />
this particular matter. They would want their estimates to<br />
be accurate. They have a pride in their work, they are devoted<br />
servants of Australia. I'm quite certain last year and this<br />
year they will be doing the best they can. 7 </p>
<p>QUESTION: Prime Minister, Mr Howard has said that public<br />
servants would be sacked if the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission granted large wage increases. Can you define in<br />
more precise terms what-the Government means by large<br />
wage increases, in terms and expressed as a percentage of a<br />
C. P. I. increase?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think that I can be that precise, and<br />
I don't think I should be, except it ought to be noted that<br />
average weekly earnings rose in the last financial year more<br />
than the Consumer Price Index, which doesn't indicate much<br />
wage restraint. You all know the extent to which wages have<br />
risen, right out of line with productivity, in the period of<br />
Labor administraiton. That causes much of our present problem.<br />
We would have to make judgements at the time of any wage<br />
decisions to see if we believed they were consistent and<br />
appropriate. If you believe wage decisions placed too great<br />
a strain on our own budget, what we have said is that we will<br />
again re,' iiw our programs to what programs should be reduced<br />
or eliminated., so that we respond in a way in which private<br />
enterprise businesses have to respond. If wages go up too<br />
much, and they can't afford to pay everyone, they have to do<br />
something about it. I believe that to have a view that it<br />
doesn't matter how much Commonwealth public servants are paid<br />
or. how much State public servants are paid, there is an<br />
inexhaustible supply of money to meet an escalating wage bill-<br />
I believe that is a very false view. It is a view that says<br />
that it doesn't matter how much money the government spends<br />
But it does matter. What governments spend they have to take<br />
from people like you and all the other taxpayers of Australia.<br />
We are seeking to drive home the point that the level of<br />
money wages is very much related to job opportunities. Trade<br />
Union leaders have an option of continuing to press for higher<br />
wages for those in work at the expense of those out of work,<br />
or they have another option of showing more concern for those<br />
out of work and assisting our general policies of getting<br />
inflation down, which will be greatly helped by some moderation<br />
on the wages front.<br />
QUESTION: You don't think wages, to a-certain extent, have<br />
already taken off because of the Utah settlement involving an<br />
increase of $ 95 a week?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that was a most unfortunate settlement,<br />
and contrary to what has been said let me just record the<br />
Government neither Tony Street or myself were aware of the<br />
final terms of the settlement when it was made. When I heard<br />
about it, it was already over an accomplished fact. But I<br />
believe that the great body of Australian working men and women<br />
know that wage increases that run too high and too far take<br />
the job away from their workmates.<br />
QUESTION: You said it was that it was unfortunate, Prime<br />
Minister. Surely it's late criticism for you to call that<br />
irresponsible. / 8 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I think I used stronger words at the time.<br />
Let me also say though adminilstrative arrangements have been<br />
put in frame to try and make sure that the government is<br />
kept even more closely informed of the developments in major<br />
industrial disputes that have got significant wage implications.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, can I put this question to you in.<br />
a Budgetary context, because I believe it does have . Budgetary<br />
implications far beyond the immediate and political implications:<br />
If a Prime Minister is under continual attack, it must affect<br />
political stability, and if it continues for long it must affect<br />
the country's standing even overseas and even on money marketsso<br />
that it can have a serious effect on our international<br />
credit rating. Has not the stage been reached when it becomes<br />
a national duty, beyond any personal political consideration,<br />
to put a stop to the present furore over the Withers Affair,<br />
as a national duty?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that what you said about political<br />
stability and economic stability in Australia is very accurate.<br />
We all know what happened in the Labor years. It was madness<br />
of economic policy, but at the same time political instability<br />
and foolishness and other matters raising money in odd<br />
corners, all sorts of different things which did so much to<br />
destroy Australia's reputation overseas, so much to destroy<br />
the confidence of investors in Australia and overseas which<br />
takes some time to regain. Anyone who is aware of what is<br />
happening in the financial arenas of Australia knows full well<br />
that confidence is returning, has returned, to a very marked<br />
degree. They know full well that the policies of this<br />
government, the policies of my government, have led to a marked<br />
turn-around in confidence in Australia, in New York, in London<br />
and financial circles. When you get people overseas investing<br />
in Commonwealth Bonds that's a pretty good sign,. and that has<br />
been happening a bit this year, probably for the first time in<br />
many years. Confidence in Australia, confidence in economic<br />
policies, and confidence in political stability are of enormous<br />
consequence and enormous concern. Political instability could<br />
do a great deal to undermine what I believe is a Budget<br />
ideally suited to Australia's circumstances, and the kind of<br />
reaction I'm getting out of the public which is not really<br />
adequately reflected in the media up to this point is evidence<br />
of that. Take yesterday for example, at the Lactos Factory.<br />
Going around the opening there were people there -farmers, and<br />
there were others working in the factory, who were saying it<br />
is a good Budget, and glad to see that somebody has had the<br />
courage and the determination to introduce the kind of Budget<br />
that is necessary for the economic recovery of Australia.<br />
That's not to say they agree with every last detail of the<br />
Budget but the broad thrust, its purpose, its objective,<br />
its policies. At the Liberal Party State Council Dinner last<br />
night I can say that I have never been to a Liberal Party meeting<br />
after a Budget when so many people have come up to me with a<br />
sense of rel and making the point that the Budget is the<br />
right one Australia. They knew it was tough, they knew<br />
it was difficult, but I believe that people outside are very<br />
glad indeed to know that we did what we were elected to do<br />
and introduced a Budget that is desirable and necessary for / 9 </p>
<p>Australia. You asked about political stability, you asked about<br />
attacks on myself. I agree with you that if that continued it would<br />
become damaging. I say it in no sense than stating anything<br />
other than the fact, in terms of what happens in<br />
countries overseas whether one likes it or not, and because of<br />
the personalisation of politics which the media, I think, does<br />
so much to promote. The reputation of this country and its<br />
economic policies overseas is Malcolm Fraser's reputation overseas<br />
in terms of the policies that we have persued, . in terms of the<br />
kind of determination which has won this country respect,<br />
which is moving us into the ranks of the stronger economies of<br />
the world. All of that is, I believe, a fairly categoric<br />
answer to every significant part of your question. Let me also<br />
say that the thrust of allegations in relation to Eric Robinson<br />
was a thrust that pressure had been brought to bear upon him, a<br />
thrust that there had been a suggestion that he should say that<br />
his memory was defective and that something might not have<br />
been soid in the way in which he put things down in evidence<br />
before the Royal Commission. No such suggestions have ever<br />
been made to Eric Robinson, and I regard the answers that have<br />
been given in the Parliament as answering categorically the<br />
thrust and the substance of whatever the implications are.<br />
PETER BOWERS: Prime Minister, thank you. </p>
