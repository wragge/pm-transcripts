FOR PRESS 17 APRIL 1978<br />
DEATH OF ARCHBISHOP CAHILL<br />
Archbishop Cahill spent his life in the service of his Church,<br />
and its people.<br />
A priest for forty-three years, he worked tirelessly for his<br />
parishioners, particularly in the field of Social Welfare.<br />
Education and opportunity for the young, and care for the aged<br />
and infirm were his special concern.<br />
I join with the many thousands of Australians who mourn his<br />
passing. </p>
