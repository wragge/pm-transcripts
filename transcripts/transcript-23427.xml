    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments are delivering on our shared plan to build a stronger and more prosperous Western Sydney by investing more than $1 billion over the forward estimates and $3.5 billion over 10 years in major infrastructure upgrades that will transform the regionâs economy.</p>
<p>The new plan involves transport links to capitalise on the economic gains from developing an airport at Badgerys Creek. This will boost the local economy of Western Sydney, making it an even better place to live and do business.</p>
<p>The Australian and NSW Governments will jointly fund the road infrastructure plan through an 80/20 funding split.</p>
<p>The people of Western Sydney have been neglected by Labor for far too long and this investment will relieve pressure on existing infrastructure and unlock the economic capacity of the region by easing congestion, slashing travel times and creating thousands of local jobs.</p>
<p>This investment in roads will create 4,000 jobs in addition to the tens of thousands of jobs that will be created by the new airport.</p>
<p>Western Sydney is already Australiaâs third largest economy and in its own right would be our fourth largest city. Over the next 20 years, the region is expected to grow from two million to three million, which is why both governments are fast-tracking development of new and existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Australian and NSW Governments are committed to getting Western Sydney moving with modern infrastructure to boost productivity and make life easier for motorists so they spend less time stuck in traffic and more time being productive at work or at home with their families.</p>
<p>This plan will deliver significant upgrades to major and local roads including:</p>
<ul><li>Bringelly Road â upgrade to four lanes from Camden Valley Way to the Northern Road</li>
<li>The Northern Road â upgrade to a minimum of four lanes from Narellan to M4 Motorway</li>
<li>Elizabeth Drive Corridor â construction of a new four lane motorway from the M7 Motorway to theÂ  Northern Road</li>
<li>Improve interchanges connecting Northern Road and Elizabeth Drive with arterial roads</li>
<li>Local Roads â $200 million for local road upgrades</li>
</ul><p>The strong cooperation between both governments means the first contracts for Bringelly Road are expected to be put to tender in July with planning on The Northern Road also substantially progressed.</p>
<p>These upgrades will increase the capacity of the region to handle future traffic growth; improve accessibility to the M7 and M4 motorways; significantly reduce travel times and improve the safety performance of Western Sydneyâs road network.</p>
<p>The Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development the Hon Jamie Briggs and NSW Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon Duncan Gay, will have responsibility to drive the infrastructure plan,Â  to plan and prioritise funding of existing projects and consider future projects to be funded at later stages of the programme including:</p>
<ul><li>A link from theÂ  M4 to the Airport</li>
<li>Prospect Highway</li>
<li>Moorebank Precinct</li>
<li>Werrington Arterial</li>
</ul><p>Work will also begin immediately to reserve a corridor for a future extension of the South West Rail Link to the Airport and to the South West Growth Centre.Â Â  Enabling work, including a station box for a future rail link, will be completed during construction of the airport.</p>
<p>This package builds on significant commitments already made by the Commonwealth and NSW Governments that foster positive growth in Western Sydney including building WestConnex, developing the Moorebank intermodal terminal and constructing the North West and South West Rail Links.</p>
<p>The Australian and NSW Governments understand Western Sydney is one of Australiaâs most significant economic growth corridors and together with our commitment to build the Western Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek, this programme will deliver the jobs and infrastructure of the 21st century that Western Sydney needs.</p>
