AUSTIALIAN PRIME MINISTER REVIWS<br />
TH C1IM1 , VEALTH ' S ECON0 11Y<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. R. G. Menzies,<br />
and the President of the British Board of Trade, Mr. R. Maudling,<br />
addressed members of the Australian Association of British manufacturers<br />
and their guestsat a dinner at the Mayfair Hotel on<br />
s qs? 4 hd to celebrate the association's<br />
S pDurmetsh idaendn. ivTheers aprrye, s ident ofA the association, Mr. Jocelyn Morton,<br />
In the course of his speech Mr. Menzies reviewed the<br />
Australian economy. The main text of his speech follows:<br />
Now, Sir, an occasion like this is not an occasion, as<br />
I long since learned, for heavy political observations. But it<br />
may be perhaps an opportunity for expounding quite mildly, quite<br />
lightly, a few aspects from my point of view of the Australian<br />
economy. I think there are three or four matters that I would<br />
just l-ike to mention to you,<br />
The first of them is that in 1950 17inston Churchill sent<br />
me a cable about import licensing. Not that Winston was a great<br />
expert on import licensing. Let that be conceded at once. But<br />
because there was a certain amount of uproar here about tne steep<br />
impositions of import licensing to which we resorted at that time<br />
and particularly two years later. I remember it very well.<br />
I was put up on a platform over past Westminster somewhere. I had<br />
a delegation from Manchester modest fellows those! They didn't<br />
merely make it clear to me that what Manchester thinks today London<br />
thinks tomorrow. They gave Ye a pretty broad hint that what<br />
Manchester thinks at any time the Australians would never think of<br />
in a century' But anyhow it was all quiie enjoyable and I went away<br />
feeling that there was how shall I put it slight objection to<br />
import licensing' Well, in effect we took it off the other day and Iexpected<br />
to get votes of thanks even frcm Manchester. o. votes of thanks from<br />
Manchester dear me' what it was a crime to impose it was a<br />
double crime to remove. But all I want to remind you about is<br />
this. Tariffs yes. The Tariff Board yes. It's our great<br />
instrument and I am delighted to have heard your reference to it.<br />
It's our great instrument of providing the terms and conditions<br />
on which goods wi: lpass into Australia.<br />
But import licensing what you might call the blunt<br />
instrument of import licensing this is something which can be<br />
justified only for balance of payments and balance of funds' reasons. </p>
<p>And when, as it's happened with us, through the inscrutable<br />
wisdom pa5rtly of Providence and partly of' my own Government;<br />
when it turns out that our balances of payment are good and our<br />
overseas funds are good, it is, quite seriously, necessary, if'<br />
we are to maintain our position as honest international traders,<br />
that we should reduce and ultimately eliminate the arbitrary<br />
impact of import licensing and leave these matters to the tariff'<br />
and to the Tariff' Board.<br />
Now of' course my friend the chairman very naturally has<br />
said that he feels anxiety, and some of you do too, about what<br />
may now happen. If we are to put up a tariff in A:* ustralia high<br />
enough to keep out low cost commodities and of course you<br />
realise Japan is by no means the lowest of the low cost countries;<br />
if we are to do that then we may lave to put up a tariff so high<br />
that it will. impose grievous disabilities on the exporters from<br />
this country.<br />
B~ Now all I want to say to you, Sir, is that that is<br />
Wa problem well known to the Tariff Board; to which the A ustralian<br />
Tariff' Board has been directing and is directing a great deal of'<br />
attention. And in its consideration of that matter it has, as<br />
Susual, been tremendously helped by the representative of your own<br />
WAssociation in Australia,<br />
It isn't an easy one tc get some flexibility into a tariff<br />
structure which will enable you to deal properly with one and<br />
equally properly with an entirely different one. But I do know<br />
for myself that the Board is itself very exercised about this<br />
matter and all I need say to you is that you need have no fear that<br />
it will do its very-best to avert the kind of consequence that you<br />
had in mind., Now the second thing that I want to say a word about.,. 0<br />
Vis this. I have been a long time on the political scene much<br />
too long I think. But I have been here almost a ridiculous number<br />
of times and we've had all sorts of arguments. I. can go back<br />
years to a time when you could genuinely find people in this<br />
country who thought that Australians ought to hew wood and draw<br />
water and grow wool and leave the manufacturing to people who<br />
understood it. That's onl. y 25 years ago.<br />
But a great change has come on the world. The truth is,<br />
and this is the lively thing about our association, this is the<br />
1i211 thing about the Commonwealth or at any rate about Great<br />
Britain and Australia that we know that it is through co-operation,<br />
not throu ' gh hostility; through dynia-mic ideas, not through a set<br />
of static ideas, that we are both going to develop to our fullest<br />
possible extent.<br />
And for that reason one of the things that I want just<br />
to mention to you is the extent of capital investment in Australia.<br />
Recently, when, for some purpose or other, I was looking up the<br />
records, I found that in the last 50 years the population of<br />
Australia had doubled. That's really an enormous increase.<br />
Since the War ended, the last War ended, our population<br />
has been increased by more than two million people which in<br />
a country of our population-size is an enormous development. </p>
<p>We've had the most enormous immigration policy and<br />
programme, W'e have been going through a period of development<br />
so fantastic in the last ten years that I don?' t think anybody<br />
would have dreamed about it 20 or .30 years ago.<br />
And of course you can't have a great programme of<br />
development, you can't have new works of irrigation, of powier,<br />
of bydro-electric works; all the great foundational things that<br />
have to be done mna country the size of the United States and<br />
with one-fifteenth or sixteenth of its population, without making<br />
tremendous calls on capital and therefore without involving yourself<br />
in enormous inflationary pressures. A nd one of the great<br />
answers to inflationary pressures has been to attract into<br />
Australia capital investment, genuine capital investment from<br />
other countries which will supplement the very remarkable amount<br />
of saved and invested capital that goes to work in my own country.<br />
S Again may I trouble YOU to give you a figure or two?<br />
Figuzres that ought to be given Take June 1947 to June 1959<br />
that is 12 years, all post-war years. The private investment of<br />
capital from overseas directly or indirect~ ly I'm saying nothing<br />
about public investment, nothing about public loans either in<br />
Londun, or New York or in Switzerland or from the W orld Bank, but<br />
private investment has been -0819 million. Z: 280 million of that<br />
represents undistributed income left and therefore reinvested in<br />
Australia, and r: 5.79 million represents othor inflow of capital.<br />
Anyhow, .!: 819 million.<br />
Now I turn to the domicile of the investors from overseas.<br />
Uiited Kingdom: CÅ 520 million. out of r' 819 million Z? 520<br />
million.' United States and Canada.: .(" 214 million, and other<br />
sources ( E~ urope and so on): .7285 million.<br />
You know, I think it's a r-. emarkable thing. It's one<br />
of the greatest gestures of co-ope ration and underostanding and<br />
* inteligence in my political lifetime that this country, with all<br />
its problems, with its own tremendous battles on its own balance<br />
Isotef rplainymgen ts, with its owin struggles to advance to a state where<br />
and dollar reserves, trading and financial balances,<br />
vould move towards a period of conversion that in this very<br />
time people in this country, not Government, people like youshould<br />
have invested in Australia. 252D mi-llion out of a total of<br />
Å 819 million passing into Australia,<br />
Now, of course, Sir, I know theire are tho3e who, no doubt,<br />
for their own good reasons, feel a little reluctant about a flow<br />
of capital into their country because they say that ' W-vell, that<br />
means that money will go out. That means that w--e're in the hands<br />
of other people. That means that dividends will be paid out,<br />
and this will become an intolerable burden on our trading position."<br />
And 8.0 if you are troubled by that at all I'm not I would.<br />
comfort you by telling you that at the present tiimie taking our<br />
present financial position in Australia, of all companies' income<br />
after tax and tax takes, of course, about a third of it of<br />
all companies' incomes after tax, Å 160 million goes as dividends<br />
to resident-shareholders and Å 043 million as dividends and profits<br />
remitted overseas.<br />
Now that, I think is a fascinating figure M% left in<br />
Australia, paid in Australia as dividends, and on top of that, if<br />
you take the undistributed profits, which again represent roughly<br />
a third of the profits earned, then of the undistributed profits<br />
Å 201 million accrue to resident shareholders and PÅ 34 million to<br />
non-re sidents. </p>
<p>~ 4.<br />
So you see the point I'm making: that there's been<br />
this tremendous pouring-in of investable capital into Australia,<br />
particularly from here and so far from putting Australia in<br />
pawn.. so far from laying burdens on the Australian economy, the<br />
whole of these transactions have resulted in immeasurable benefits<br />
to my owni country.<br />
And, I hope, considerable satisfaction to those who have<br />
put their money in.<br />
Now I won' t weary you with any more figures. I mentioned<br />
those simply because I think there is some misunderstanding....<br />
But I woDuld like to say something to you about this<br />
celebrated legal expression as it was once " seven and sixpence".<br />
You knt-w, of course, most of you were much too young to remember<br />
the time when a solicitor was expected to charge 7s. 6d. for an<br />
interview. And as I was never a solicitor myself I didn't ever<br />
know it. But we've all become accustomed, haven't we, Mr. Maudltoin<br />
gc, o ntcoe atl atlhkei ngd iraebcoutitn nt heo f sethvee n satrnodk et, h e thseix . s ix Oarn di fth ew e sewavnetne, d<br />
I think perhaps it is desirable that I should just say<br />
something to you about our attitude on this natter because it can be<br />
easily misunderstood, I say " our" attitude, I speak for<br />
* Australia, at least so far as I know I haven' t been beaten since<br />
I left home, though one never knows. But anyhow, our attitude,<br />
and I have no doubt it is the attitude of other Commonwealth<br />
countries, We did not object to the creation of the Common Market,<br />
we did not object to the creation of the Six. We felt that it<br />
was unfortunate that a movement calculated to strengthen the<br />
economy of six European powers should even ap~ m ar to be something<br />
in rivalry to the economic strength of Great Britain or of the<br />
other Wiestern European powers,<br />
But every movement in the world which is calculated to<br />
Sstrengthen an economy of a group of nations is a good movement,<br />
Wand we had no complaint about it because may I remind you we<br />
are, though you think us tiresome occasionally, and even more<br />
frequently irrelevant, we are a very considerable trading nation,<br />
I spoke a little while ago about what the position was<br />
years ago, The exports and imports of Australia at that time<br />
averaged about S70 million each way, And today they're within<br />
a touch of 1?, 000 million each way. We do have the great honour<br />
and the great responsibility of being one of the first ten trading<br />
nations, international trading nations, in the world.<br />
Always remember that,. because that will keep a few things<br />
in proportion when you find us mTaking deals with various people<br />
who are prospectively good customers, Wie are a very very considerable<br />
trading nation, And as a trading nation we felt at once<br />
that the agreement between the ' Issina powers had something in it--<br />
that if this could strengthen the economy of Europe: good.<br />
And then, of course, right on top of that, like yourselves,<br />
it presented itself to our minds that if this were the beginning<br />
and the end, then Europe would be divided economically and a Continent<br />
which is divided economically can before long find itself<br />
divided politically. And there could be no greater disservice / to the </p>
<p>to the free world than to have the whole of the Western European<br />
powers divided into two sections because that would of course<br />
begin tby all thiose pleasantries that economists, Ministers of<br />
Trade and so on engage in, and could easily end up by producing<br />
hostilities, dislikes and finally perhaps tear apart the whole<br />
structure or Western defence a structure which has not become<br />
irrelevant just because there is going to be a meeting at Paris.<br />
And theref( hre when the proposals for the Seven were<br />
avalved. what is called by some people the " Little Free Trade<br />
Area!; when these proposals came forward you mustn' t assume~ that<br />
we were objecting to them. on the cotntrary, we saw in this the<br />
gathering together of a group of people vho vculd be in a powerful<br />
position to construct a bridge between the " Seven" 1 and the " Six".<br />
In a powerful position to have all the thirteen nations associated<br />
in a way which would help their common economy, strengthen their<br />
position, and make them as a result a more considerable trading<br />
Svfiaecwto, r in the world, a selling factor perhaps from their point of<br />
but a buying factor from our point of view.<br />
And we still think that. Nobody need suppose for one<br />
moment that there is some doctrine in the Commonwealth which opposes<br />
this kind of thing, We think that this is a good idea and we<br />
think, really, that it is an urgent idea, just say two things<br />
Wabout it, They're both qualifications but they don't materially<br />
alter what I have been saying,<br />
In the first place we think that as a Commonwealth<br />
country, with all o'dr old associations with this country and with<br />
all t ose mutual benefits that we have extended to each other we<br />
ought to be at the party. We and other people like us ought to<br />
be in the closest consultation when the bridge is being built.<br />
Now that's fair enough, isn't it? Because we In ve our interests,<br />
though we're well aware, as I have said to you, of our common duty<br />
to do everything that can be done to strengthen this structure,<br />
And in the second place, yes, some of you who met some<br />
Iofm my opowerrful enego tiators like Sir John Crawford and so on much<br />
difficult fellows than I an the President of the Board of<br />
Trade he's familiar with my colleaguie, John McEwen, who is now<br />
enjoying the novel experience of fighting my battles at Canberra<br />
and leaving mri, to make the extraordinary statements on the trade<br />
front overseas ( all that's right) of course we'll argue about<br />
this and that. Of course we'll be interested in our exports to<br />
FRurope. Of course we will want to argue sensibly, as I believe,<br />
about preferences which we enjoy, just as you want to argue<br />
sensibly about preferences that you enjoy in Australia,<br />
And the whole point that I want to make is that it would<br />
be a cardinal blunder for anybody to think that those who have<br />
some interest, and they're not here, but those who have some<br />
interest to keep the Seven and the Six separate, to keep the<br />
European economy divided; it would be a very great mistake to<br />
assume.. that they are the people to whom we in the homely Australian<br />
phruse wre " barracking". Because they' re not. We want to see<br />
the highest possible measure of unity. 1-Tieaon't want Vo see it.<br />
at the sacrifice of matters that are important to you and that are<br />
important to -as.<br />
But for the life of us we can' t urderstand, nor indeed<br />
ivould the President deny it for one moment, ' Pe can't understand<br />
/ any reason </p>
<p>any reason why Commonwealth countries like my own, increasingly<br />
si. gnificant in the world, should not be at the party, at all<br />
relevant times, able tn say what we think, able to be told what<br />
goes on. We still have a little to learn about the price of<br />
effective brotherhood, and the great price of effective brotherhood<br />
is that we should have no secrets one from the other; that<br />
we should always sit down together and commaune with each other<br />
at the right time; that whatever disagreements we have should<br />
be in private. and whatever agreements we have should be placed<br />
in the shop windows.<br />
Now I know that in saying that I am speaking merely the<br />
mind of my distinguished col-e ague, the President of the Board<br />
of Trade. But I thought I would make a reference to this matter,<br />
because I know how some of you may have felt that we are developing<br />
in a turbulent, aggressive fashion. Itm flattercd when someone<br />
tells me that I'm aggressive, Opponents at Canberra assure me<br />
week in week out that I'm a weak-kneed apologist. And so I don't<br />
mind who tells me that I'm being aggressive. I'm not really<br />
aggressive because I begin all my thinking on these problems and<br />
end all my thinking with whatever little differences and occasional<br />
irritations may have intervened I keep coming back to it and<br />
saying that iWell, you' re half Scots and half Cornish and you're<br />
British to the boot-heels and we will sink or swim together.<br />
