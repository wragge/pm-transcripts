24 October 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
THE BALMORAL HOTEL, EDIN~ BURGH, SCOTLAND<br />
E~ OE<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, earlier today I had a meeting with the Prime Minister of<br />
Malaysia, Dr Mahathir. It was, as has been the case in our earlier contacts, a very<br />
comprehensive discussion not only about bilateral issues but also about issues of direct<br />
import to the region. We naturally spent a lot of time talking about the cur'rency and<br />
stock market instability in Malaysia and other parts of the region.<br />
I also put to him in the course of the discussion a proposal that Australia and Malaysia<br />
work in partnership to establish some clearer rules in relation to the regulation of<br />
electronic commerce and my delegation is handIng to the Malaysian delegation a<br />
position paper on that issue which will form the basis of further discussion between the<br />
two governments which might, I hope, lead to an agreement between Australia and<br />
Malaysia on matters concerning the regulation of electronic commerce.<br />
As I indicated in my speech to the Business Forum yesterday, there is going to be an<br />
absolute explosion in this area over the next few years. Something like US$ 5 billion is<br />
now traded on the Internet and that in three years alone is going to grow to<br />
somewhere between US$ 100 billion and US$ 150 billion. So we do need a set of rules<br />
and guidelines in relation to electronic commerce and given the interest of Malaysia in<br />
that area, the regional partnership between the two countries, it is very important that<br />
we work together on it and Dr Mahathir responded very positively to that proposal.<br />
I did naturally express to him my disappointment regarding the Transfield contract and<br />
although I assured him of the continued interest not only of the Transfield company<br />
but other Australian companies in defence acquisitions, and related investments.<br />
The discussions that we had about the turbulence in financial markets was very wideranging<br />
and he repeated to me his concerns about the impact and the role of<br />
speculation in that area. </p>

I also expressed concern to him about the continued challenge to the environment and<br />
climatic conditions in Malaysia as a consequence of the fires that continue to burn in<br />
parts of Indonesia,<br />
He noted with appreciation the role of the CSIRO team which is conducting some<br />
significant research into the causes of some of this climate adversity and I indicated<br />
that Australia stood ready where appropriate and consistent with our capacity to<br />
provide the expertise and the resources to give further assistance to Malaysia. It<br />
continues to be a very significant environmental problem and also, not only ourrently<br />
but potentially a significant health problem in the region,<br />
I don't think I want to say anything more than that. I guess you'll have some<br />
questions arising out of the meeting and other matters and I'd be very happy to answer<br />
them. JOURNALISTPrime Minister, is it a bit reassuring, the returning of the stock market in Australia to<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Yes, I think it is important for us to keep a balance in our responses to what is<br />
happening. You can never be complacent when something like this occurs. We live in<br />
a global financial system. The linkages are such that instability in one part of the world<br />
is almost inevitably going to cause some reaction in other parts of the world. I am<br />
encouraged by that rebound but the situation has to be kept under very close attention.<br />
There oughtn't to be any complacency and that of course, is why, when my<br />
Government came to office, we immediately addressed the fundamentals of the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
And one thing I cani say to the people of Australia is that our country is a lot less<br />
vulnerable to what is happening around the world now as a result of the emphasis that<br />
my Government has placed on getting the fundamentals of the Australian economy<br />
right. Reducing the budget deficit, changing the labour market, addressing the<br />
problems of the current account, keeping a very strong anti-inflationary policy.<br />
If we had taken the advice of Kim Beazley, the Australian economy would now be far<br />
more exposed and far more vulnerable to the turmoil in others parts of the world<br />
because all of the reforms that we sought to undertake, reducing the deficit he<br />
opposed, privatisation he opposed, labour market reforms he opposed, he continues to<br />
oppose taxation reform, and one very clear economic and political lesson over tile<br />
events of the last 48 hours is that the determination of my Government to keep the<br />
fundamentals sound has paid, I think, a great dividend in terms of greater security for<br />
the Australian economy and therefore the Australian people. </p>

If we had not adopted those policies, if we had not observed those priorities, Australia<br />
would be in a weaker international economic position than is now the case.<br />
JOUIRNALIST: Mr Howard, to what extent do you think that lower regional growth though will hit<br />
Australia regardless of how the fundamnentals may or may not be, there wiU be a flow<br />
on effect from that?<br />
PRIMfE MINISTER:<br />
Mchelle, it depends very much on the location of the slowdown. Australia's exports<br />
of merchandise go in terms of about 15 per cent to the ASEAN countries which so far<br />
have been the hardest hit. We trade more extensively With the countries of north Asia,<br />
the three Chinas, Korea and Japan. Obviously, what happens in those countries and<br />
what happens in particular industries in those countries will determine the effect.<br />
I think all I can say, Michelle, is that there will be an impact according to where theslowdown<br />
occurs, and where it's most marked,<br />
If it's most marked in countries that buy a lot from Australia, then one would assume<br />
that the impact on Australia would be greater. Although it is fair to say that Japan,<br />
which continues to be our largest customer, over the last few years has gone through<br />
very sluggish economic times but still continues to be a sound customer.<br />
We cannot be complacent. By the same token you have to recognise that the direct<br />
imipact on Australia will be governed by the impact of the slowdown in different<br />
countries and within those different countries on different industries.<br />
JOURNALIST: As AIPEC is so important to regional countries including Australia these days,<br />
( inaudible) do you see this as the sort of occasion where APEC should have a positive<br />
role in trying to deal with the situation ( inaudible)<br />
PRI[ ME MINISTER:<br />
There are already international institutions that are there and they are multi-lateral<br />
institutions to deal with any systemic challenges and we saw that in relation to<br />
Thailand. And where the central banks got together, Australia very heavily, and to her<br />
great credit in the region, was greatly involved. I don't see APEC coming in over<br />
those institutional arrangements and they are set up for the whole world and not just<br />
for our region and I wouldn't want to change that. But I do see APEC, given its<br />
unique character, as a body that brings together so many countries in the region, I see<br />
APEC as obviously being a forum where these things will be talked about and perhaps<br />
some responses canvassed. But that would be fiilly consistent with and supportive of<br />
the international institutional arrangements. </p>
<p>Fax from 4 1 25/ 18/ 97 28: 83 Pg:<br />
OCT 25 ' 97 19: 51 P<br />
The world has come an enormous way since 1929 and the 1987 stock market crash<br />
demonstrated that. So many people wrongly saw that as a repeat of 1929 and, of<br />
course, it wasn't. And one of the reasons why it wasn't was that the world,<br />
particularly the central banks of the world, had developed more sophisticated linkages,<br />
more sophisticated mechanisms. We had an international monetary fund, we had a set<br />
of internatioruiJ financial understandings that meant that the knee-jerk and absolutely<br />
disastrous response of the central banks in 1929 which was actually the cause of the<br />
Great Depression, rather than the stock market crash itself, was not repeated.<br />
So, I think you've got to have a balanced perspective about what is occurring. It is<br />
not a time for complacency and no national political leader and no central bank can<br />
ignore what is happening and certainly that is not occurring in the case of Australia.<br />
But, by the same token, you have to recognise that just as globalisation has meant that<br />
what has happened in one part of the world means that there is a reaction in another<br />
part of the world. Equally globalisation is the very strength that we have that the<br />
world didn't have some years ago. And globalisation can be a buffer as well as a<br />
conduit. And, I think we would make a huge mistake if we turned inward and thought<br />
that the solution to the problem lay in moving away from globalisation.<br />
I would say in relation to Australia, that the right response to what is now occurring is<br />
to re-double our efforts at reform and change, rather than take the foot off the<br />
accelerator. Taxation reform, which will make Australia a more competitive country, must be<br />
pursued with renewed vigour, Because anything that further waterproofs Australia by<br />
fiurther strengthening the fundamentals will protect us in a more uncertain international<br />
economic environment.<br />
JOURNALIST-. Did you discuss with Dr Mahathir the APEC proposal for a separate Asian I. MF fund?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
No, no we didn't specifically canvass that, no,<br />
JOUTRNALIST: Mr Howard, do these events make that proposed industry fund canvassed in the<br />
Mortimer Report look more attractive?<br />
PRIME MSTER:<br />
Oh, I think it's sort of neutral on that, Michelle, neutral. </p>

JOURNALIST:<br />
Pime Mnister, Dr Mahathir recently made some comments that caused some<br />
controversy and drew some concern in Australia. Did you raise those comments with<br />
him today?<br />
PRIME MINSTER;<br />
That matter was discussed, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST.-Can you tell us what you said?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
I indicated to him that the remarks had caused concern in Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: And did he give you any response? Did he explain why he made them or suggest that<br />
he had.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't think that it is for me to canvass what be said to me in relation to that.<br />
You all know my very strong views on those matters and I made it very clear when<br />
asked that anything that involved any suggestion of anti-semnitism was something that I<br />
utterly and completely repudiated and would always repudiate in the strongest-possible<br />
terms. The matter was discussed. It's fair to say that he's-expressed some views and people<br />
on his behalf have expressed some views putting what he said into context, but that is a<br />
matter for him. I wouldn't presume to say any more.<br />
JOURNALIST; But you raised it? You...<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
No, he actually raised the matter himself.<br />
JOURNALIST: To reaffirm those views, or to explain.. </p>

OCT 25 ' 97 19: 52 P. 12<br />
PRIM M~ STER:<br />
Well, the answer to the first question is no, he didn't. But I don't think I should say<br />
any more than that, because it would be breaching the confidence of the discussions.<br />
But he raised the matter and 1, in the course of the discussion that followed, indicated<br />
that the remarks had caused concern in Australia and then we moved onto something<br />
else.<br />
JOLWUALIST: When you say you need to re-double efforts on tax reform, did you have a specific idea<br />
of how you're going to rev up the<br />
PRIMfE MINISTER:<br />
Well, re-double the efforts is just my way of saying, we're even more committed to it<br />
now as a result of what is occurring than we were before and gee, we were committed<br />
to it before.<br />
JOURNALIST: So, you're not saying you're going to accelerate that process?<br />
PRRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, Karen, the process has unavoidable timelines on it because of the complexity of<br />
the task, but the point I make is that it's all the more important that these sort of<br />
reforms be addressed because what has happened over the last few months, and<br />
particularly over the past few days, is a reminder that nothing is ever totally predictable<br />
or totally tranquil in the world economy and the best thing that any government can<br />
ever do for its country is to keep the fuindamentals sound and to keep the foundations<br />
of the Australian economy in rock solid shape.<br />
It might be criticised. It might be derided on occasions as unexciting, but gee when<br />
you get into a squall it gives you an anchorage that you don't otherwise have.<br />
JOURNALIST: So, you're saying that you're going to hold firm to your agenda, you're not saying that<br />
your agenda will be changed in line with this, It won't be sped up..<br />
PRI1M MINISTER:<br />
Well, we're going to hold firm with our agenda, very strongly in relation to taxation<br />
reform and we'll press ahead with other reforms as well. </p>

JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, on this tax reform question, are you separating out the decisions of<br />
business tax, businessrelated taxes and taking the earlier or are they just ( iaudible)....<br />
general tax package?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It will be a harmonious, comprehensive package.<br />
JOURNALIST: So, they're not part of the industry decision<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
WeD, I'm not going to talk about what's in the industry decision package but the<br />
comprehensive tax reform the which the Government has committed itself is something<br />
dealing with both business and personal tax together. Together. Together.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Dr Mahathir express any particular views about the fundamentals of the Malaysian<br />
economy, you said that you did discuss the position in Malaysia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes he did. He felt that the Maaysian economy was fundamentally sound. He drew<br />
attention to the record of lifting growth and of economic reform and economic change<br />
that his government had undertaken. His views on the impact of speculation have been<br />
canvassed before, and I listened very carefully to what he had to say. He has naturally<br />
a deep concern for the living standards of his people and feels that a lot has been<br />
achieved in that country, which it has, over the last 15 years.<br />
JOURNALIST: You don't seem convinced the speculation was the sole cause of the.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I'm not going to become a commentator on the economic management of other<br />
government JOURNALIST: Your our expert </p>

PRMa NMhfSTE. K<br />
Well I know I amn, I know that Malcolm, but notwithstanding that, and I will forebear<br />
on this occasion. I will not do that.<br />
JOURNALIST. On greenhouse, prior to your arrival in Britain, the British government had been<br />
mounting a less than subtle attack on Australia's greenhouse position, and that in turn<br />
has spawned some of the environmental activists here describing you as the dirty man<br />
of the world, in that context. Are you<br />
PRIE MIENISTER:<br />
I have been insulted by experts.<br />
JOURNALIST; Are you offended by the British campaign, and how does it feel to be labelled thusly?<br />
PRIM MINISTER.<br />
Well I wouldn't for a moment imagine that such thoughts have entered the minds of<br />
British midnisters. They are the utterances of some groups on the periphery. The<br />
reality, Dennis, is that the British position as expressed to me was more<br />
accommodating and more understanding that had been the public perception. That's<br />
the reality.<br />
The Prime Minister of Britain said to me when I saw him that he understood<br />
Autralias dift~ ent position. H{ e also said that he believed that you'd only get a<br />
comprehensive agreement on this issue if countries accepted that other countries had<br />
diffrent challenges, diferent situations and therefore there had to be an acceptance in<br />
any agreement that we worked towards of our different positions.<br />
Now that is al that Australia. has been arguing for. We have never argued that we<br />
shouldn't be part of the process, We have never argued that we shouldn't do things,<br />
and we will be doing further things and I will be announcing those, as I've said for<br />
some weeks now I would be doing, before the Kyoto conference. But what I wanted<br />
to get an acceptance of was that you couldn't just have a mandatory, blanket rule for<br />
everybody because we're coming from different positions.<br />
I mean, obviously if you've got a starting point of 1990 and you've got an East<br />
German economy that's faMen over and nothing's happened for several years, and<br />
you've got 4l those pits that were closed, which you al saw about in the movie<br />
coming over, in Brassed Off, and you pick those up as a sort of environmental credit, </p>
<p>Fax frm 4 1 Z5/ 10/ 97 28: 83 Pg: 16<br />
OCT 25 ' 97 19: 53<br />
obviously you're going to be able to say to the rest of the world, well look, we've got<br />
all our things down, what about you coming into line?<br />
Now if the starting point were 1995 and not 1990, then your outcome would be<br />
different and the European Union would not be in such a position to say to the rest of<br />
the world well we can deliver this, you've got to match us. Ninety per cent or more of<br />
e UYJJro0n1' sI Qm oney int he bank on this issue, environmentally speaking, is as<br />
r , Uof fte, .~ l uc ofitish coal rains and the fact that the East German, the dirty<br />
LWdurics Of Easte= n E] ropg fell over whm, ; oZ= m fell over and the bottom fell<br />
out of the command economies of Eastern Europe. Now you take those two<br />
compont out of it, you've got a vastly different world. And that of course is why in<br />
the European bubble Portugal can apparently go up by 40 per cent and other countries<br />
can go up by certain percentages.<br />
Now what I think we have seen over the last few days is an acceptance by the British,<br />
an acceptance by the Americans, emphatically, that different countries will give<br />
different responses and have different solutions and different reactions. I'm not saying<br />
that the British aspiration has changed, it hasn't, and I'm not asking that it change. All<br />
I'm asking is that in addressing us, they understand that our position is different and<br />
I'm not going to back away from that and I'm not going to back away from a defence<br />
of the Australian national interests, and it is winning wider acceptance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you got any information out of the Small States meeting this morning?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Small State5, what Australian Federation or Pacific Islands?<br />
JOU'RNALIST: The Small States I think had a meeting scheduled for this morning at which greenhouse<br />
was expected to be discussed. I just wondered whether Australia goes along to<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PRvE MINISTER:<br />
Well we're not regarded in that context as a small state.<br />
JOURNALIST: No, but I thought that somehow we might get a look in on what ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it wouldn't, Michelle, it would be completely unsurprising to me if the Small<br />
ULiand states, in particular of the South Pacific, and others, didn't meet to talk about </p>

the WrebOu= issue Of COUr~ e they will. I understand that, and it's entirely to be<br />
epected. JOUR~ NALIST:<br />
But you don't know what's come out of it?<br />
PlUME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't. I've been talking to you and Dr Mahathir and others.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident of a uniform position out of CHOOM on greenhouse?<br />
PRIME MINISTER.<br />
I wouldn't preempt what will come out but I am a lot more confident now that there<br />
will be a broader understanding of the different situations of different countries. I<br />
don't think at any stage it was realistic for CHOGM to say, well this is the figure that<br />
everybody's got to reach, I don't think that was on anybody's agenda. But I am more<br />
optimistic that we will have a balanced, sensible response. I mean, the thing I have to<br />
say again is that it will be putting quite a bit on the table, quite a bit on the table in<br />
relation to new measures, and we've always intended to do that, but for obvious<br />
negotiating and other reasons we didn't want to talk about that too early in the piece.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister there's a report before the Commonwealth today on the issue of<br />
Nigeria and the move by the British Government to have sanctions imposed. What's<br />
your view about what should be done about Nigeria's position?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Wefl I don't think Nigeria has thus far absolved itself of the conduct and gainsayed the<br />
reasons why her membership of the Commonwealth was suspended in 1995. As to<br />
how I would react to particular British government proposals, I'll wait till I've seen<br />
those proposals and I'll wait until the conference has started, but the decision of the<br />
smaller group, of which Australia is not a member, to in essence maintain the 1995<br />
suspension remains totally valid and I think the stance that's been taken by the<br />
Commonwealth Secretary-General is right and the Commonwealth must maintain a<br />
very consistent respect for those principles of human rights and internal democratic<br />
practices that are what, after all, the body is meant most of all to stand for.<br />
JOURNALIST: So your simply suggesting you support the ongoing suspension that's put forward.<br />
What's your in-principle view about taking further actions against Nigeria, whatever<br />
they might be? </p>
<p>Fax from'o 4 1 25/ 18/ 97 28: 83 Pg: 12<br />
OCT 25 ' 97 19: 54 P. 17<br />
Well IT1 wait and see what's put on the table at the CHOGM meeting. What I'm<br />
Kar=, is that the suspension now is justified and it's up to the Nigerians to<br />
address the reasons for it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what did you make of the speculation about the future of the Queen as<br />
the head of the Commonwealth and how was your dinner with her last night?<br />
PRIME MI1NISTER:<br />
Well her role as head of the Commonwealth I would have thought, without prejudice<br />
to the republican debate in Australia, I would have thought the role of the Queen asthe<br />
head of the Commonwealth would not be the subject of any sort of serious dispute.<br />
It's my recollection historically that when the formula was worked out in, was it 1949,<br />
to allow India to remain in the Commonwealth despite becoming a republic, that the<br />
formula for the monarch of Great Britain to be the head of the Commonwealth, which<br />
was proposed by the then Indian Prime Minister, Nehru, that was the foundation of it<br />
and I don't think it's been seriously challenged since then and I'm not sure that the<br />
remark made by the Secretary-General was other than a slip of the tongue. But my<br />
own view is, as I say without prejudice to views about republics or otherwise, the<br />
current arrangement ought to continue. Most emphatically.<br />
JOLMNA= IT.<br />
Did you express much interest in that subject last night?<br />
PRIME MINqISTERWell<br />
you know, Alison that I can't really, in accordance with proper protocol and<br />
process, talk about what was discussed. It was a very pleasant evening.<br />
JOURNALIST: But have you had an opportunity to talk to her on developments on the Constitutional<br />
Convention since you last spoke with her?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Dennis, I'm not going to canvass what was discussed either a few months ago in<br />
London, or last night. I'm sorry but I think you understand the settings. </p>

JOURNALIST: Pit it th. wyy. Pri= i Mu d4.' U Pi= Minister Chretien about the<br />
Cotuti~ onal Couveintion?<br />
PR. IM MINISTER:<br />
Well, it would not be possible for me to answer that question and maintain a respectfll<br />
consistency with what I said a moment ago in answer to Dennis.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard being a cricket fan are you concerned about this possibility at home of a<br />
wide-ranging players strike?<br />
PRIMYE MINISTER:<br />
Well, naturally as a lover of cricket I would hate to see any circumstance develop<br />
whereby either the Sheffield Shield teams, the one-day teams, or worst of all the<br />
Australian Test team, were denied the services of the best Australian players available.<br />
Now I don't want to comment on the ongoing negotiations between the Australian<br />
Qridw BQw4 and th P! y= s' A-ciAton I would imagine that I express the<br />
passionately held views of all Australian cricket lovers in saying that the idea of a strike<br />
is not something that we, that is the cricket lovers, warm to. I understand and respect<br />
the rights of the players, I also respect that there is a negotiating process underway. I<br />
hope it's satisfactorily resolved to the greater benefit and promotion of the game.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you support use of the secondary boycott provisions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Somebody might say if you introduce a few West Indian fast bowlers into it,<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be playing golf at St. Andrews on Sunday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't know yet, I don't know what I'll be doing. I thought we were going there<br />
to work. Is that a rumour is it that we're not going there to work? No I thought we<br />
were going there to work, but if the majority want to engage a little bit of recreation<br />
than who am I to be a spoiler.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
