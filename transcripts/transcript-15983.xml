    <content><![CDATA[<p>I've lived in Beijing a bit myself over the years and you're going to have a great time. </p>
<p>The closest I got to competitive sport in Beijing was playing for Australia in the Australian team in Beijing in cricket. There were only 12 Australians in China at the time and I was selected as 12th man. As our captain said I never troubled the scorekeepers much. But I tell you what no one ever read of any score of mine but they are going to be watching how you guys go. All of us are going to follow it with a huge amount of personal interest and pride. </p>
<p>Australians love sport. Australians love the Olympics and Australians love Australian sportsmen and women representing their country at the Olympics. Your part of a very proud history which goes back now more than 100 years. </p>
<p>This is all an essential part of who we are as Australians. From the big cities to the outback Australians are now itching for the action to begin. We will all be glued to the TV sets watching every step along the way. Every success, every not success, every striving, every competitive sprit that we will see on the competitive field of sport when you are up there. </p>
<p>Australians will be there right behind you, everyone of us, because you do us proud. The opportunity to compete in the Olympics and the Paralympics is, in itself, an incredible achievement for each of you. It means you have earned the right  -  through hard work and training  -  to represent your country at the highest level. </p>
<p>And I'd just like to say to each and every one of you before you go be proud of your achievement. Absolutely proud of your achievement. To have reached this height, to be part of this great Australian team. Its something which so many Australians aspire to and so few achieve. </p>
<p>So each of you prior to any calculation of who gets medals or who doesn't, just be proud of the fact that you have made it to Team Australia, representing Australia at these games and I salute you. </p>
<p>You've now got of course the further summit to climb. Taking to the track, the field, the pool, the range or the water, you will be up against now the best in the world. </p>
<p>You will be among athletes who have also dedicated themselves to excellence in your chosen field. The competition will be intense. You will all be after the same thing. You will be intense competitors, you will be rivals, you will be striving for the prize. </p>
<p>But I say again the prize that you have already achieved is to be part of this great team. </p>
<p>It does make you part of an exclusive club, and it creates a unique bond among athletes. Even individual sports, its important that everyone, everyone plays their part. And the people who have played their part over the years have been your mums and dads, your coaches, all those dedicated folk picking you up at 4:30 in the morning. Taking you off to a swimming pool at 5 (am). Week in, week out  -  year in, year out. </p>
<p>There's just a hope and a dream in your mum and dads eye, your coaches eye that maybe you'd crack the team and the same for the athletes. And I think it's a time to reflect on the thanks that we all owe the dedicated mums and dads and coaches of Australia, in order to get you to the stage that you have reached. </p>
<p>The sacrifices made by your families are many, and I suspect they will be more nervous, more excited and more proud than each one of you. A sporting career only comes to rely on so many people the coaches, trainers, nutritionists and others and more and more so as you approach the peak of your sport. </p>
<p>In Beijing, you will be supported by some of the best coaches, sports scientists and support staff in the world. They are just as dedicated and I'm sure they're also pretty excited too. </p>
<p>To each of you who are coaches and trainers, nutritionists and other staff supporting our athletes here today, can I also say to you thank you on behalf of the nation. Your dedication and support of these proud athletes is also so important to the country and I thank you for your professionalism.</p>
<p> The Australian Institute of Sport, the AIS is a famous brand in world sport. It is little wonder that other countries have tried to pinch our techniques and tap into our expertise, because the AIS has done so well. Despite their best efforts, I'm sure that the AIS will again ensure Australian athletes are the best prepared they can be in going forward to these Olympics. </p>
<p>I am also pretty sure that you will be watched like hawks over the next 50 days  -  your training, your diet, whether you sleep, make sure you get plenty of sleep. Because all of that's important in helping, the athletes to prepare for the final events in Beijing. </p>
<p>I was in Beijing just a few months ago. I can tell you that the games really are transforming the city. The anticipation is huge, and I am sure the Chinese will be absolutely magnificent hosts to each and every one of you. </p>
<p>Like in all big cities, there will be a few challenges in Beijing, there always are at Olympics time. But I am sure that it you will overcome any hurdles that you are presented with, just as you have done many past Olympics and those who have preceded you have done at every Olympics back to 1986.</p>
<p> I am looking forward to being their with you myself and I am confirming today that I'll be in Beijing at the invitation of the Chinese Government for the opening of the games and to be there cheering you on for the few events. </p>
<p>I like so many Australians will be there with pride watching you, cheering you on and urging you to do you absolute best for Australia as I know you will. </p>
<p>Today, I want to wish all of you the very best  -  athletes, coaches, sports scientists and other support staff. And with your big day looming, I just leave you with one simple message. </p>
<p>As you embark on this journey, know this and know this as you go through each and every difficult minute and hour and day of the competitive weeks that lie ahead of you. And that is this: your country Australia is so very proud of you, so very proud of you. Good luck.  </p>
