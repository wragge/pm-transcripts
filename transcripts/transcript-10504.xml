    <content><![CDATA[<p>LAUNCH OF CENTRELINK</p>
<p>I am pleased today to launch officially a significant reform to the way in which the Commonwealth delivers services to the public.</p>
<p>The creation of a new single entity. Centrelink, to provide most of the Commonwealth Government's information and assistance programmes is a very real example of how this Government is improving the way we do business.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to greater efficiency in the public sector, and reducing waste and duplication in the delivery of services. Centrelink achieves these goals. Centrelink makes good sense a one-stop shop which puts a range of government services under the same roof.</p>
<p>My Government has established Centrelink with a new corporate structure to enhance responsiveness and accountability, both to Centrelink's customers and to the taxpayers of Australia. The Board of Centrelink includes private sector members with extensive experience in the establishment of customer-service networks.</p>
<p>As well as being a more cost-effective way of delivering government services, Centrelink also represents a more convenient, efficient and customer-friendly way of doing business.</p>
<p>This initiative is more than a name change. It is a change, for the better, in the way the public sector interacts with its customers, the people of Australia.</p>
<p>Whether they are retired people, students, parents of young children or people seeking assistance in finding a job, Centrelink will be of benefit to all who need to use government services, through improved service, better designed premises and the convenience of being able to conduct a range of business with the Commonwealth Government in one location.</p>
<p>Centrelink will be of benefit to all Australians. including those who do not use its services, by delivering essential government programmes in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>24 September, 1997</p>
