Radio 2SM Interview with Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Gough Whitlam<br />
Interviewer: Stephen Brouwer<br />

EMBARGO: </p>
<p>" Mr. Prime Minister now that t wo year's have gone by, the obviuaL,<br />
question is have they been comuipletely satisfying for you.<br />
Not completelyl but 0but hli
If you had the time over again what things would you do differently.<br />
Oh, I am not sure. I could not identify what I would do<br />
differently. I would have liked many things to have been done<br />
more quickly, or completely.<br />
Would you like to name a few?<br />
What immediately occurs to me, of course, those things where<br />
we have been held up in the Parliament; or those things where we<br />
have been held up by State Governments not co-operating with us.<br />
There were many things, of course, which were held up by the Senate:<br />
some which are still being held up by the Senate. There are also<br />
a great number of things where the State Governments were slow<br />
to co-operate and where time was lost, but in general,<br />
everywhere really, except Queensland that's now been overcome.<br />
If you lose Office, or when you retire from Parliament, what would<br />
you personally like to be remembered for?<br />
There have been two main things at least that ie have been able<br />
to do. One is that we have C ,1. rU Lihmt Fhopl.<br />
have a better opportunity in life righi i , I.. L Atse1.; V, have<br />
done that through the Schools Commission. The other is that we<br />
will have done things to ensure that people have better opportunities<br />
in life wherever they are living, and we are doing that through<br />
our programms for cities, capital cities, provincial cities. I<br />
suppose the principle instrument of this is the Grants Commission.<br />
So the Schools Commission and the Grants Commission are the two<br />
big things which we'll be remembered for, but there is a whole<br />
host cf other matters too, of course, but you asked me, I think,<br />
for te wo big ones.<br />
What about ; ou personally?<br />
T had quite a bit to do with both those, of course, but -r<br />
also the general impression that our country has abroad and kihe; t<br />
we are doing in the World, and there, there has been a<br />
transformation during the two years we have been in Office. You<br />
af1} ed me personally, I have been very much involved in all that.<br />
If you lost Office, what would Gough Whitlam do?<br />
He woule relax and enjoy it.<br />
As. Oh, doing nothing. I worked a long time and very hard.<br />
have been in Parliament 22 ,/ e-irs this month. I have been<br />
Prime Minister twc, years this im and they've been very<br />
active years.<br />
You'd retire to the Back Bench, or leave polidcs. </p>
<p>I am not r-ally making any plans. I am 58, and I * ppose I<br />
have a few years as Prime Minister yet.<br />
Well you have reached the highest position in Australia. Have<br />
Syou got any further personal ambition?<br />
None whatever. Australia has been good to me.. I have worked<br />
hard according to my'lights' for Australia. Nothing else I<br />
should want or expect.<br />
So for you the Prime Ministership is it.<br />
Well, of course.<br />
Well, can I ask you if you felt much personal distress about<br />
the sacking of Mr. Crean.<br />
Well, let me make it plain. I don't accept the word sacking.<br />
Mr. Crean and Doctor Cairns exchanged port folios. There can bc<br />
no shame for Mr. Crean to take a department of which Dr. Cairns<br />
had been the minister for two years, including six months as<br />
Deputy Prime Minister. There is no shame for a minister to take<br />
over a department from the Deputy Prime Minister.<br />
Well can I ask you if you felt much personal distress about the<br />
reshuffle. Mr. Crean liked being Treasurer.<br />
Yes, he did, but as I say there can be ' no skin off his nose'.<br />
if the Deputy Prime Minister is willing to be Treasurer then it is<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister's duty to take the position of Treasurer.<br />
The Deputy Prime Minister for nine years after Menzies was restored<br />
was Sir Arthur Fadden, and he was Treasurer throughout that time.<br />
The. for the following 11 years under Mnzies and the leader of the<br />
Co iiL. Party, the deputy Prime Minister Mr. McEwen didn't want<br />
the joi-So the deputy leader of the Liberal Party had and<br />
that was . ic. Holt. Then when Mr. Holt died the next T<br />
was the New deputy leader of the Liberal Party, Mr. M . ic<br />
I beg your pardon Mr. McMahor, the new deputy leae. E<br />
Liberal Party took over as Treasurer whe-Mr. HIolt Pr<br />
Minister. So for 20 years under a predecessors you had tne<br />
the dputy prime minister or the deputy leaders of the Liberal<br />
' arty holding the position of Treasurer. Dr. CL.-ns was'n.<br />
axious to take the job when he became deputy -) rime ? ini , cr<br />
L. on because of the prominence that ever knei th. 4<br />
he was accepting in economic matters I asked . iim to 7econsi<br />
matt -nd he accepted. Now it is quite wr:. ag, I ' n't<br />
the Lion of sacking of Mr. Crean. The fact wa<br />
a senior ma.. was willing to take that port fo) io, and Mr.<br />
took the port folio previously had been held by his Sc<br />
that is a perfectly p. L, r and normal procedure.<br />
So for you it was a political and there waL.' t cfn' p<br />
distress about the changes.<br />
I didn't like the way all the speculation, and a lot of it<br />
of course was completely false. You know there were thi. nms said<br />
which were quite untrue, which the least checking would have<br />
revealed to be untrue. There was a story in the paper </p>
<p>that Mrs. Crean and I had some disagreement no basis for<br />
it whatsoever. There was also a flash on one television<br />
chain that Mr. Crean's son had said something. Mr. Crean's<br />
son had never been contacted by any television station. Now<br />
these were very reckless, and cruel, and I said obscene<br />
things to go on. They were fabrications no attempt whatever<br />
was made to check them, and of course some people in the Media,<br />
and I hope you don't mind me saying, make these stories up with<br />
confidence, knowing that the people concerned are not going<br />
to refute them. I am going to dignify this sought of<br />
speculation.<br />
And this was the aspect that did distress you throughout the<br />
whole issue.<br />
P. M: -, Ies I was of course not at all pleased that a leak came out4<br />
what was likely to happen, and it occurred when Dr. Cairns<br />
was overseas from the First to the Fifteenth of November, and<br />
in those circumstances nothing could be done about it. When<br />
Dr. Cairns returned the propriety was to inform the Governor<br />
General of what I had in mind, and he was not in Canberra<br />
he was interstate for two or three days.-When l-returned I<br />
saw him that afternoon, and I made the announcement with<br />
his approval.<br />
Was making the change a hard decision to make?<br />
P. M: Yes, but I think it was a necessary decision.<br />
re there any other changes you would like to see in your<br />
stry?<br />
Well -Lnere again I am bound to adhere to the polic A<br />
have always followed. If there are any changes a L<br />
over a year since tha~ ewere the men c iccrned are IL<br />
to hear. ', Tow I will not iespond tc qu -stions ,. aeuii, 2r<br />
are any changc<br />
Will you personally be doing more on th.-economic front n,<br />
I will be more regularly and fully 9 --Lnde fmeno: r<br />
I have taken steps to see that Government departn-Lts a<br />
ag " ies collect more relevant statistics,. anci u,-t tI<br />
analyz. them more quickly. The unfortunate thing is t!<br />
many quiL. important statistics which have -ot been<br />
comprehensively cc -cted or promptly analysed.<br />
Prime Minister I have u what you cons~. der -o<br />
greatest achievement what Uo you consider to be the grccte2:<br />
mistake. Well naturally I am not going to readily respond to a qu~ stion<br />
like that. I haven't thought about it. The great difficulty<br />
we have had of course is that we have come to office at a time<br />
of very great economic difficulty unemployment and inflation<br />
in all the countries of our type throughout the World </p>
<p>all the western countries; all the industrialised trading<br />
countries in the world are beset by those two problems, and<br />
we infect each other, we just can't live to ourselves.<br />
Well I interviewed Dr. Cairns the other day and he said because<br />
of the economic conditions in the pipe line Labor<br />
could not have won at a worst time. Do you agree?<br />
Yes I think that's right. Although I also accept the fact<br />
that if you are in the business of politics you must try<br />
to win whenever there is an election. It was certainly an<br />
unfortunate time to come to Office. It would have been very<br />
much better if we had won three years before in 1969. The<br />
Liberals at that time still had a new lease of lif-e because<br />
Mr. Gorton had only had about less than two years in Office,<br />
and there was still the feeling that he was entitled to have<br />
a fair go.<br />
Well, probably appropriate on the second anniversary anO your<br />
second anniversary as Prime Minister of asking you what do<br />
you consider to be your greatest asset.<br />
In what Way?<br />
Your greatest personal asset.<br />
I suppose I have had an exceptionally long opportunity to study<br />
issues affecting the federal government in Australia, or<br />
affecting Australia in the World; and I was very diligent<br />
throughout those 20 years I was in opposition to equip<br />
myself to understand those domestic and international issues.<br />
Prcf-bly you could say that I have been better prepared<br />
fc: L. job than any Prime Minister has been.<br />
It wouldn't be fair if I didn't ask you what do you c<br />
to be your greatest fault.<br />
M: There again you ion't expect me reaadily to answer questn., s<br />
like that. My ' j. eatest disadvantage I suppose is that<br />
I -caiae. to this post rather older than would be ideal<br />
but that is unfortunately something which be.: ts<br />
11 heads of Government in the Western World We bcc., me<br />
Pri: ne Minister or President and I am not saying I want<br />
to be President. I will have to make that qualific ion<br />
at th--tage, but there are systems where the head -f go<br />
is called ? resident. People in general become prime mii<br />
or president at the qreater age than they wou. d for instanc_<br />
be appointed as head a government department or as head<br />
a business enterprise.<br />
At what stage in your life do you think would have been an<br />
appropriate time for you to come to the prime minis,-, rship. </p>
<p>10 years I suppose.<br />
Can I ask you, who would you prefer as Leader of the<br />
Opposition? I :-em very happy with the present leader of the Opposition.<br />
Prime Minister I am not asking you to justify your overseas<br />
trip, but with the criticism did you ever consider cancelling io?<br />
No I never considered cancelling it. It is always easy<br />
to criticise or even ridicule overseas trips. The fact is<br />
every overseas trip I have made has been necessary and has<br />
been successful, and there is no trip that I have made<br />
that people have criticised as having been unnecessary once<br />
it took place they have, in fact, been beneficial, but there<br />
has been no visit by a senior minister to Europe since the change<br />
of government two years ago. I visited Westminister,<br />
Windsor, and the Vatican, but that was a very brief visit for<br />
various constitutional reasons concerning the British government<br />
and the monarchy. There has been no visit to the Common<br />
Market; there has been no visit to the Soviet Union;<br />
there has been no visit to any of the migrant countries;<br />
and this has been a very great omission up until now I was<br />
to go in. the middle of the year, but of course the double<br />
dissolution occurred at that time and delayed it all. There<br />
are pressing issues to be discussed. After ail people<br />
shouldn't in Europe or in Australia get any impression that<br />
Astralias cultural links, historical links, econoic links,<br />
Europe are less important than they were or/ ling<br />
Do.: , ec1, and if a Head of government visits a country re<br />
is no ., bt the way the wholeldministration of that r<br />
is galvanized into action the way attention is g<br />
to the country from which the visitor comes. We -LIly<br />
have done that on the occasion of the isits by heads c<br />
government or -ads of state to this country. You only<br />
have to look an-everybody can see how much the government<br />
directed attention to relevant issues when ihe p.' ime minis'<br />
of Japan or the Shah of Iran vi:'. ted h * 1i, there have<br />
c" er countries. There have never been sc -p visit,<br />
t_ Australia. There have been as many Ln Lhe iaTh<br />
as -here have been in the previous twenty. We now<br />
impo.. '-in the World, but there has not been an o fici;<br />
visit by prime minister to Europe since 1. -9.<br />
three immec. ate pr, -1-cessors never visited t. iere, and thet:<br />
have been some coun. s which have never had a prime mini.<br />
visit them, for instan. It-r1v. They h,-v nev -r h;<br />
an official visit by an Aus, an prime minis,-r, d. es-.<br />
fact that the presidrnt of Italy was prepared to \' isit here.<br />
Many people ridicule these things, but the fact is that the.. u<br />
are many things which can only be determined on the top<br />
and I have some experience in this; more in fact that ran. y<br />
head of government that this country has had. My duty takes<br />
me there. Of course I'll enjoy it, but there are very many<br />
things which can only be determined at my level or instituted<br />
at my level, particularly in the Common Market. </p>
<p>6<br />
S. B. The ridicule and the criticism must annoy you.<br />
P. M: No I expect it. After all I have been politics for<br />
22 years. 12 years ago it would have annoyed me. It would<br />
have driven'me aound the bend. Now I know it goes with the job.<br />
In this job you take the good with the bad. Now this is the<br />
criticism, I accept it, but I am not going to be deterred from<br />
doing what I think has to be done and what only can be done<br />
by the head of the Australian government because there can<br />
be some criticism. These are very strenuous visits which I<br />
make. Prime Minister, thank you very much. </p>
<p>S. B What do you t.: 01kcJof your internati. iaj iih, ige in relation<br />
to the aboriginal situation?<br />
I think everywhere around the Wor-ld now L LX'r. Lt 1.1' 1a/ i1<br />
that Australia has a government which is determined<br />
to give better opportunities for aborigines in their own<br />
country. Almost you can say a Government which is prepared<br />
to emancipate the aborigine;.<br />
Well I think it was yesterday a book was launched by a<br />
black British sociologist, Chris Mullard, who described<br />
Australia as the second most racist country in the World.<br />
P. M: I cannot condone Australias record in this matter, but<br />
at least the present Australian Government, my Government,<br />
is trying to do something about it. The opening was made<br />
when theReferendum was carried in 1967 which removed the<br />
barriers in the Australian constitution to action by the<br />
Australian government on be'lalf of the Australian aborigines,<br />
but unfortunately until we came in there had been no<br />
administrative or legislative action taken by the Holt, or<br />
Gorton, or McMahon Govern. c-ens which couldn't have been taken<br />
before that Referendum was carried. Now we are taking<br />
that administrative action and since, particularly in<br />
Queensland, the administrative action has been frustrated<br />
by the State government we will be taking the legislative<br />
action. See every other state has made arrangements with<br />
my government concerning aboriginal affairs. Every other<br />
state Labor, Liberal, but in Queensland that's not proved<br />
possible; so now there will be legislative action and the<br />
result in the 1967 Referendum entitles us to take that action.<br />
In fact, we would say obliges us to take that action. </p>
