The Honourable K. 0. Lyons, M. H. A.,<br />
Deputy Premier and Chief Secretary.<br />
At today's meeting, Ministers exchanged information<br />
on existing legislation and gave their views on the problems<br />
of the environment in their areas and the steps that they<br />
are formulating to protect it. It was recognised that the<br />
State Governments have already been active in a wide range of<br />
fields, including national parks, wildlife, water, soil and<br />
forest conservation; and control of water and sewerage<br />
systems and air, water, oil and noise pollution. / 2 </p>
<p>However, it was agreed that there was a continuing<br />
need to combat pollution and to improve the quality of the<br />
environment. Ministers discussed the means of continuing<br />
Federal and State consultation and the degree to which<br />
uniformity of approach was desirable.<br />
The Ministers decided to meet again as soon as<br />
possible and, they hope, before the end of the year.<br />
Tentatively, they have arranged to meet on 26 November in<br />
Perth at the invitation of the Premier of Western Australia.<br />
In preparation for that meeting, Commonwealth and State<br />
officers will draw up an agenda for their consideration and,<br />
in the meantime, details of legislation and administrative<br />
practice will be exchanged.<br />
