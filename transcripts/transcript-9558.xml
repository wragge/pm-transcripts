TRANSCRIPT OF THE. PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH FROM THE DINNER, GLOBAL CULTURAL DIVERSITY<br />
CONFERENCE, SYDNEY, 26 APRIL 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
We have already had, today, a very good beginning to this conference this<br />
important conference on global diversity, and I think there was a unanimity<br />
of view that the conference began well it certainly did with the diversity of<br />
that percussion performance we saw this morning, and I'm not sure that the<br />
Secretary-General and I were percussing people, but I know that the<br />
musicians were. At any rate, one is told that as the day closed, that it was a<br />
successful day, and we are very pleased about that. Because this is a very<br />
significant and important theme for the United Nations, and the world, to<br />
embrace, because as we have remarked to ourselves over the course of<br />
this day many of the world's problems are not now super-power problems,<br />
they are not nation state problems they are problems which arise from<br />
little differences and differences of view that have been concentrated into<br />
virulent, in some cases, strains of objection and Intolerance and prejudice,<br />
which threaten the peace of countries, the peace of regions and the peace of<br />
the world. And we find ourselves joining in the United Nations in the<br />
endeavour of seeking to remedy some of these problems, to quell these<br />
conflicts, and we are coming to the conclusion very obviously that we are<br />
better trying to deal with the problems at the source, rather tn the<br />
manifestations of them, when they already arise. And so, by the United<br />
Nations and the Secretary-General giving this conference its endorsement<br />
and its imprimatur, we are bringing to the world agenda an appreciation of<br />
the importance of diversity as something to celebrate, rather than something<br />
to fear.<br />
Now, this evening, We are continuing the thefrie, and the performers tonight<br />
the musical entertainment tonight Is again, another cause for the celebration<br />
of diversity, and the fact that it has enriched u. s all so very much. And let me<br />
say, that in this country, nothing has enrich~ ed Australian cultural life more<br />
than the new diversity of this country, and the openness to other cultures.<br />
And they are the cultures of our Aboriginal people, Asian cultures around us,<br />
European culture all of these things have been the cause of enriching this<br />
country. I know there is now a threat or a iperceived threat, rather to the </p>
<p>internationalisation of culture, and we have seen this particularly in<br />
entertainment, and we are very conscious of this because In this country, we<br />
lost a film industry to Hollywood in the 1930s. I'm sure many of our<br />
distinguished guests might not appreciate that there but for the grace of<br />
Charlie Chaplin went the rest of us Charlie Chaplin, and Louis B Mayer and<br />
the Warner Brothers were a hell of a team to beat, but we did have an<br />
important Australian film Industry. We have lost one, and we are determined<br />
not to lose another. You might know that, of course, we have the French<br />
elections on at the moment, and we over the course of the Uruguay Round<br />
we found ourselves implacably on the other side to the French in the Uruguay<br />
Round, seeking to give the producers of the South a place in these big<br />
agricultural markets, which unusually as a developed country, Australia<br />
participated in. But, of course, the one thing we joined the French on at the<br />
end of the Round was in protecting Intellectual property in protecting<br />
cultural property. And, I think one can do these two thing that is, be proud<br />
of one's own culture, and do the things to enrich it and protect it, but through<br />
its strengths allow it to be open to others so we gain and secure a benefit<br />
from them, So I think we shouldn't fear the international isation of culture -I<br />
don't think it is a crude choice between selling ourselves or impoverishing<br />
ourselves in the cause of cultural fidelity I don't think we need to do those<br />
things. I think we take the general view that we can profit by being open to<br />
the world, and if the proof of the pudding is In the eating, I'm sure that<br />
Australia is an example. But we have seen it so often we have seen the<br />
impact of Greek and Roman art and architecture on the world, we have seen<br />
the power of Chinese culture, and the profound influence of Chinese art In<br />
Europe in the 18th and 19th century, we have seen the Indian sitar infiltrate<br />
its way into the music of Liverpool in the 1960s, we have every ' time we have<br />
seen an openness to diversity, we have seen something better. And, of<br />
course, let me say on our part, that here how we cherish in this country the<br />
culture of Aboriginal Australians I think one of the great cultural phenomena<br />
of recent Australian history has been the rejuvenation of Aboriginal culture,<br />
and its integration with the non-indigenous cultures of Australia. And not only<br />
that, but we are seeing it acclaimed around the world as well.<br />
We welcome diversity it has been a cause of power to our arts and to our<br />
culture, and it makes the point again that here we are having a conference<br />
seeking to promote the idea that diversity is a cause of celebration, and can<br />
be a cause of celebration, and something richer, and better, rather than<br />
simply something that leads to division and fear and calamity.<br />
Tonight, we are very appreciative of the fact that the Australia Council which<br />
is Australia's premier arts funding body, the body most possessed of the<br />
charter of promoting Australian art and culture has sponsored tonight's<br />
performance, which we are about to enjoy, and has arranged with the<br />
performers and the artists to come tonight to entertain us. I would like to<br />
thank the Australia Council, and the performers, for doing this in the cause of<br />
this great undertaking of increasing the awaren ess that we are seeking to<br />
understand better at this conference about the value of global diversity,<br />
worldwide. I would like to, most especially, thank the Secretary-General for<br />
endorsing this conference, for coming here, for bringing his wife to Australia </p>
<p>it is a great honour he does us. He has, without a doubt, the hardest job in<br />
the world. I don't think there Is . some say " well, the Presidency of the<br />
United States Is the world's hardest job", and it may be true. But, seeking to<br />
resource this body the United Nations in its diversity, and in another form<br />
of diversity in seeking to secure the consensus that is always required to<br />
move it forward, to renew it, to consider its future and how it might be<br />
reformed these are the things, the tasks, which have fallen in this age of<br />
ours to Doctor Boutros-Ghaii. It is with those heavy responsibilities, that we<br />
know he has, that makes us appreciate ever so much more his attendance<br />
here. Could I finally thank you all for being so enthusiastic about the conference<br />
for coming to Australia, for doing us that honour, for joining us, and for<br />
coming tonight to celebrate this dinner with us, and to hear some of the<br />
performers, and some of the music, that I know you will be pleased to see.<br />
ends. </p>
