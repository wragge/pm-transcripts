    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will provide $1.225 million over four years for the continuation of the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group Project, to provide more young people in northern Adelaide with an opportunity to explore careers in the advanced manufacturing and related industries.</p>
<p>The Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group Project provides students and teachers with the chance to engage with potential employers in a number of activities focused on practical experience, including problem-solving activities, industry tours, mentoring and workshops.</p>
<p>Since early 2005, the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group project has reached over 500 students across northern Adelaide, achieving recognised success in boosting student awareness of the opportunities available in the manufacturing industry, increasing student enrolments in related mathematics and technology subjects, and fostering links between schools, higher education institutions and industry.  The additional funding will help to improve and expand the programme to even more students.</p>
<p>The funding will build on the $1 million already provided to this project by the Australian Government under the Sustainable Regions Program.  Since 2001, about $12 million has been allocated under this program to the Playford Salisbury area of South Australia to fund key development projects in response to economic, social and environmental change in the region.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is pleased to work with the South Australian Government and the industry partners that established the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group - Tenix Defence, BAE Systems, Holden Ltd, NTS Global, DANA Australia, Futuris Automotive and IMP Printed Circuits - to continue this successful project.  </p>
