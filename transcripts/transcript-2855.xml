GOVERNMENT TO ACT ON CONVENTIONS<br />
OPPOSING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION<br />
On the occasion of the International Day for the<br />
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Prime Minister and<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, has reaffirmed<br />
that the Government was resolved to ratify the International<br />
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination<br />
as soon as the necessary legislative and other<br />
measures could be completed.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that as a result of the Sharpeville<br />
tragedy in 1960, the United Nations had decided to mark 21<br />
March each year as a day on which the world should fix its<br />
attention on the urgent need to eliminate racial discrimination<br />
wherever it existed.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Government had approved<br />
the introduction of the legislation to enable Australia to<br />
give effect to the Convention and this would be introduced<br />
shortly. A bill was already before Parliament aimed at<br />
repealing Section 64 of the Migration Act which was the<br />
last remaining piece ( of Commonwealth legislation that could<br />
be described as discriminatory on racial grounds. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Government's intention<br />
to ratify the Convention of the Elimination of Racial<br />
Discrimination was in line with earlier positive steps taken<br />
by Australia since December last year.<br />
He recalled that soon after the Government had<br />
assumed office, Australia, for the first time, had contributed<br />
to the United Nations Educational and Training<br />
Programme for Southern Africa, the United Nations Trust<br />
Fund for South Africa and the United Nations Fund for Namibia.@<br />
The Government's decision to deny racially selected<br />
sports teams the right to visit or transit Australia<br />
could also be seen in this light.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that in order to pave the way for<br />
ratification he had sought the co-operation of the Premiers<br />
of Queensland and Western Australia in giving high priority<br />
to the removal of the remaining minor pieces of discriminatory<br />
legislation in those States. </p>
