VISIT TO INDONESIA, SINGAPORE AND MALAYSIA<br />
BY THE PRIME M1INISTER OF AUSTRALIA, THE<br />
RT. HON. WILLIAM MCMAHON, ( XH., M. P.<br />
DEPARTURE STATEMENT SIfTGAPORE<br />
I visited Singapore from 8 to 11 June, 1972 at the invitation<br />
of the Singapore Government.<br />
Substantive discussions were held with the Prime Minister,<br />
The Minister for Defence, Dr. Goh Keng Swee, The Minister for<br />
Foreign Affairs, Mr. S Rajaratnan, and The Minister for Finance,<br />
Mr. Hon Sui Sen. The discussions, which took place in a cordial<br />
frank and friendly atmosphere, revealed a close identity of views<br />
on many issues, and contributed substantially to a deeper mutual<br />
understanding of our respective positions and policies.<br />
The subjects discussed covered a wide range of international,<br />
regional and bilateral questions.<br />
On the international plane, we discussed President Nixon's<br />
visits to Peking and to Moscow and the consequent developments in<br />
Asia. We also reviewed the situation in Indo-China and found that<br />
our assessments were on very similar lines. We expressed the hope<br />
that the pr: 2scnt tragic coiflict could be brought to an early end<br />
and a just and peaceful settlement achieved.<br />
I was given a comprehensive review of regional developments<br />
including the progress mzade towards co-operation and solidarity<br />
among the ASEAN countries. Australia welcomes these deve'opments<br />
and wishes ASEAN countrieos furthrer success in their joint<br />
endeavors. I was oleased to have confirmed to me the appreciation of the<br />
helpful and stabilising role which Australia is playing in the<br />
reqion. I feel that we are regarded as a reliable friend and<br />
partner. on bilateral issues, we talked in depth about our relations.<br />
They are in excellent shape. </p>
<p>We noted with satisfaction that our two-way trade is continuing to<br />
expand and that mutually beneficial private investment is growing<br />
with government encouragement and support.<br />
Our defence co-operation with Singapore is on a sound footing.<br />
We agreed that the Five Power Defence Arrangements are of value to<br />
us both, are working smoothly and that no changes are necessary.<br />
I also visited the Jurong Industrial Estate and Vocational<br />
Institute. I was most impressed by what the Singapore authorities<br />
have achieved at Jurong. The rapid and efficient development of<br />
this industrial area bears eloquent witness to the vigour and<br />
vitality of present day Singapore.<br />
I wish to exp3ress my gratitude to the Prime P" inister both for<br />
his generous hospitaity and friendly welcome, and for the fruitful<br />
and productive exchanges which we have had. These exchanges have<br />
confirmed my belief that we share a basically similar view of the<br />
future of the region and the need for strengthening regional<br />
co-operation. I believe my visit helped to contribute to this objective,<br />
and to the strength of our relationship.<br />
CANBERRA, 11 June, 1972. </p>
