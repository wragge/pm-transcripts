' THIS DAY TOINiGHT"<br />
Interview given by the Prime Minister, Mr John G#. to6n<br />
on ABC Television 7.'<br />
Interviewer Philip Koch 9 JUNE 1969<br />
Q. Prime Minister, could this American withdrawal of<br />
troops point the way to you bringing home some of our own<br />
soldiers?<br />
PM: I don't t ' hink sD. As I said in the House on the 15 May,<br />
this unilateral withdrawal was quite possible. But I think it<br />
would be wrong for various reasons to think of bringing home<br />
Australian troops at this time. For example, since our Army<br />
was built up to its present strength our Army contingent<br />
the Americans have increased their forces by some 50, 000<br />
and what they are doing now is taking away some of the increase<br />
that was made since we made our commitment. They have got<br />
540, 000 troops there. Secondly, I think it would be rather shabby<br />
to withdraw Australian troops at this stage because the Americans<br />
have built up the South Vietnamese to try and take some of the<br />
burden off the half million troops they've got. We wouldn't want to<br />
add tO the burden, or at least stop the burden being reduced.<br />
Thirdly, our force is a self-contained force and unless it wais<br />
all withdrawn, withdrawing parts of it would be militarily quite<br />
ridiculous.<br />
Q. Did President Nixon consult with you in any way on. what<br />
he might or might not do at the midway talks with President:<br />
Thieu?<br />
PM: Yes, I had a personal letter from him yesterday about<br />
it, but I had discussions with him in the United States as well<br />
and we had previous correspondience, and indeed, we have<br />
expressed a view ourselves. But it was because I knew this<br />
kind of limited unilateral withdrawal was a possibility that I<br />
made my statement in the House on the 15 May, pointing out that<br />
it was possibility and that if it took place it should be taken as<br />
a sign of strength and not in any way as a sign of weakness.<br />
Q. Well, then how do you feel about the pressure on<br />
President Nixon at home to end the Vietnam war. Do you think<br />
he might be forced into making poor concessions which would be<br />
less than satisfactory to South Vietnam and Australia? a. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM: I don't believe so. 1 believe he realises there will be,<br />
as there are, quite strong pressures from various quarters in<br />
the United States to end the wars that he recognises this and he<br />
accepts that it would be the wrong thing to do to end it other than<br />
by attaining the objective of giving the South Vietnamese people<br />
the right to free elections and to choose the sort of government<br />
they would wish. He made that clear to me and I believe his<br />
communique from Midway makes it equally clear.<br />
Q. Now, before the Midway talks, President Nixon put<br />
forward a peace plan in which he called for a mutual withdrawal<br />
of American and North Vietnamese troops from South Vietnam..<br />
Do you expect Hanoi to reciprocate now in any way?<br />
PM: I would be surprised if they did as a result of that<br />
gesture by the United States. This must not be confused, this<br />
unilateral withdrawal of some 25, 000 troops who are going to be<br />
replaced by South Vietnamese troops. This must not be confused<br />
with a mutual withdrawal such as was suggested<br />
Q. I was thinking more in terms, Prime Minister, of later<br />
on. This is the first 25, 000 and President Nixon has indicated<br />
that he might withdraw more. If he did, would you expect Hanoi<br />
to come to the party?<br />
PM: I would again be su rprised if Hanoi took any note of<br />
anything except an agreement for mutual withdrawal. I think the<br />
President has made it clear that though in future he is going to<br />
examine further possible unilateral witharawals and replacement<br />
by South Vietnamese troops, he would want to be sure if he did<br />
that, it didn't weaken the Allied po. nition and he has also made it<br />
clear that he is adhering firmly to the objective of self-determination<br />
for the South Vietnamese people.<br />
Q. So then you don't feel any concern that perhaps there<br />
would be too many American concessions at Paris in this regard?<br />
PM: I don't think we should confuse the Paris peace talks<br />
with what is actually happening now in South Vienam, but I myself<br />
believe that the United States President would be quite firm<br />
flexible but quite firm in attaining what he stated over and over<br />
again to be the objective, that the South Vietnamese people should<br />
be able to choose a government of their own free from terror and<br />
at free elections, at which anybody could stand. </p>
<p>3-<br />
Well what would happen if the North Vietnamese Hanoi<br />
launched an all-out offensive later on this year in South Vietnam<br />
in which the South Vietnamese forces broke down,? Could you<br />
envisage President Nixon sending back troops to Vietnam?<br />
Well, in the first place, I don't see that the withdrawal<br />
of 25, 000 troops out of 542, 000 is going to lead to a situation<br />
where the whole thing can break down. That doesn't appear<br />
reas onable. I believe if there were a general offensive by North<br />
Vietnam, it would be a tragic misinterpretation on the part of<br />
North Vietnam. They would be interpreting this as weakness when<br />
it isn' 1t a sign of weakness at all.<br />
Thank you, Prime Minister.<br />
