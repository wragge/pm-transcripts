PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 380<br />
24 November 1974<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
The Prime Minister today released an exchange of<br />
correspondence with the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
" I have asked the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
to provide to the Government the fullest information about<br />
the social and locational implications of its recommendations.<br />
The Chairman of the Commission intends re-examining reports<br />
as yet undecided by the Government to identify any<br />
supplementary recommendations which might be appropriate in<br />
the current state of the economic cycle" said Mr Whitlam.<br />
" I have also told the Chairman of my wish that more<br />
attention be directed towards a general approach set out<br />
in the Commission's Annual Report for 1973-74, which would<br />
have the effect of avoiding a significant scaling down of<br />
some high cc~ st activities where change would present<br />
intractable social problems."<br />
" The Commission has been asked to take into account<br />
in its recommendations that the Government's structural<br />
adjustment measures and non-metropolitan subsidy scheme<br />
are not designed to meet all the problems, whatever the<br />
stage of the business cycle, which might arise from a<br />
structural change seen as in the national interest by the<br />
Commission." The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the<br />
system of public inquiry and public advice into assistance<br />
measures and the ability of th e Government to use the results<br />
for the national good would be enhanced by these moves.<br />
