PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FAREWELL TO WWI COMMEMERATION MISSION<br />
SYDNEY 27 AUGUST 1993<br />
This is a rare privilege.<br />
I am delighted to have the chance to farewell people who seventy five years<br />
ago were among those who made an Australian legend.<br />
The human cost of the Great War was so terrible and the political cost of the<br />
peace so catastrophic the Allied victory has never been seen as an<br />
unmitigated triumph.<br />
With the possible exception of Sir John Monash who was never given ultimate<br />
command, the conduct of the war produced no heroes among the generals on<br />
either side on the contrary, as one writer said, It contributed more than any<br />
other war to the widespread belief that military commanders were less<br />
intelligent than average.<br />
The unmitigated heroes of the Great War were the men who did the fighting<br />
the soldiers, sailors and airmen.<br />
And while the war produced many astonishing acts of valour and many of<br />
these were duly acknowledged with medals it was the common soldiers, the<br />
mass of unacknowledged individuals who marched into the most appalling<br />
battles and endured the most terrible suffering and who died in the most<br />
unconscionable numbers, who were the heroes.<br />
I think it is true to say that history judged the Great War to have returned little<br />
of any good except this the bravery and endurance, the comradeship and<br />
humour of ordinary men and women was confirmed for all time.<br />
In Australia it became a by-word.<br />
Building on those nationalist and democratic sentiments which had found their<br />
voice towards the end of the previous century and which the First AIF in<br />
fundamen-ways-ef eoted,-those who.-erwed in the Great War created a<br />
leg end the ideals to which future generations of Australians would aspire, the<br />
evalues by which they would live.<br />
So, as I said, farewelling you today is a great privilege, and it is with a mixture<br />
of wonder and some humility that I do it.<br />
It is also with appreciation: my generation of Australians, all Australians, are in<br />
your debt.<br />
Z0O/ TOd I00ON OV: O 1 6-6nbi-Z </p>
<p>We owe you for more than your service in war but for the service you gave in<br />
the peace, building this country undaunted by depression and another war.<br />
We are grateful for the service you have given and the faith you have had in<br />
Australia for the example you set.<br />
And we are grateful that seventy five years later you have been prepared to<br />
volunteer again.<br />
Your return to France is a reminder of what a hardy and tenacious generation<br />
yours was.<br />
It also reminds us that the Great War has lived on down the years. It found its<br />
way often tragically into countless homes long after the last battle was<br />
fought and it has profoundly affected the character of the nation and its<br />
people. I am only sorry that my schedule will not permit me to be in France when you<br />
are. I will be paying a brief visit to Villers Brettoneux and Hamel in<br />
September. It is a visit I have always wanted to make.<br />
I am also very pleased that on November 111I will have the opportunity to play<br />
a part in the great project to bring home to Australia, and entomb at the War<br />
Memorial in Canberra, the remains of an unknown Australian soldier.<br />
The Tomb -of the Unknown Australian Soldier seems to me to be an act of<br />
quite prolound significance. It is a grand gesture of recognition to the men,<br />
and women who served in the Great War, but more than that, It is an act<br />
which can help bind Australians together now and in the future.<br />
The soldier, to be selected from one of our war cemetries In France, will<br />
represent all Australian servicemen and women, who have given their lives in<br />
all the conflicts in which Australians have served.<br />
It can help bind the generations, help us recognise that we are all part of the<br />
-same story of Australia.<br />
And in all the legacy of Australia's Involvement in the Great War, or any other<br />
war, there is surely nothing more appropriate to symbolise.<br />
It remains only to wish you on behalf of the Government and, I am sure, the<br />
people of Australia a very happy and a safe trip.<br />
It will certainly be a quite extraordinary experience.<br />
-Theaother-side-of-he-workd-ws a-much more -remote place when you first<br />
went there, and all the more so because it was a battlefield.<br />
We can only guess at what memories this trip will bring back to you we hope<br />
that among the inevitable sadness there will also be a little happiness and<br />
pride. Thank you. </p>
