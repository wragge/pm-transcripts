    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has agreed to my request under its charter to deliver an address to the Australian people next Sunday night at 7.30pm on the issue of the Government's Native Title Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>It will be an opportunity to explain directly to my fellow Australians that the Bill itself is a fair and honourable compromise between competing interests and strongly held views arrived at after months of negotiation. It is in the interests of all Australians that this issue be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
