EXTZAM~ FROM PRIME MMNS Å“ ER' S SPEH AT MIGRA!\ T RALLY,<br />
M"= LUNE TOTN HAIL, 26 OXCIOBER 1975<br />
Thank you for coming along in your thousands<br />
to support the cause of democracy in Australia. In the last<br />
twenty-five years, three million people whc were born<br />
overseas have decided to live in Australia. Most of themi<br />
have come from countries where democracy has disappeared or<br />
where democracy is weak or where democracy is being<br />
challenged. Most of them cafle to Australia because they had<br />
heard that Australia was a mocracy, a Parliamentary democracy.<br />
They had heard that Australia was a country where everybody<br />
could express his political views and where every three years<br />
people could go along to polling booths and pass the secret<br />
votes for the Party which they themselves supported. And they<br />
had heard that not only in the national Parliament of Australia<br />
but in all the six States in Australia it was possible every<br />
three years to choose a government you wanted.<br />
Three years ago, no-one was more delighted than the<br />
migrants in Australia to find that after a very vigorous<br />
election campaign when all the political parties where able<br />
to put their arguments on the radio or in the TV or at public<br />
meetings, then you could have an election. In December 1972<br />
you were delighted you were enthusiastic that you were able<br />
to see a change of government in Australia. The people voted<br />
against the government that there had been and they voted for<br />
a new government, a Labor Government.<br />
The change from the Liberal Country Party Government*<br />
to the Labor Government was a peaceful change. The people<br />
expressed their wishes and their wishes came about. They were<br />
fulfilled; in Australia migrants saw all their hopes were<br />
fulfilled. Migrants saw that at least in Australia, it was<br />
possible by the democratic means of a vigorous and open<br />
election campaign, by a secret vote on the polling day it was<br />
possible to have a peaceful change of government. Migrants<br />
expected, as all other Australians. expected, that the Government<br />
which was elected in December 1972 would be able to govern<br />
for. three years. / 2 </p>
<p>How many migrants were disappointed when the Government<br />
which they helped to elect was forced to go to the people<br />
prematurely in May l. ast year, only 1 years after the Government<br />
was elected for three years? But once again the people of<br />
Australia, including the millions of migrants who have votes,<br />
once again they voted, after a vigorous campaign, in a secret<br />
ballot, to have three more years of the Labor Government.<br />
And now after another 17 months, before the<br />
Government's 2nd term of office is half-way through, the<br />
reactionary, the conservative, the fascist elements in<br />
Australia are once again trying to interrupt democracy in<br />
Australia, to frustrate democracy in Australia...<br />
The Fraser fascists are now saying that because<br />
they can get half the Senators voting against anything that<br />
we put up, because they are therefore able to frustrate any<br />
of our legislation, any of our motions, they are entitled to<br />
govern the country... But-if you count up all the Members of Parliament<br />
in Canberra, all the men and women who belong to the national<br />
Parliament of Australia, there is a big majority of Labor men<br />
and women over all -the others combined. That is, in the<br />
Parliament as a whole and in the House of Representatives in<br />
particular, Labor has a majority. Labor is entitled to govern.<br />
And I will point out to you what the obstruction<br />
has been this last week and the week before. The Budget Bills,<br />
the basic Bills which enable the Australian Government to pay<br />
the Public Servants, to pay the soldiers, to pay for services and<br />
contracts which'people have provided, that's in a couple of<br />
Budget Bills. And when they've gone to the Senate, the Senators<br />
haven't voted against the Bills, they've just carried a motion<br />
to defer the Bills, to postpone them.<br />
And the device they u sed is to move an amendment<br />
to the Bills that they don't be debated until there is an election<br />
for the House of Representatives. And that motion has been </p>
<p>carried three times in the week before last, . three times<br />
last week, because a Labor Senator from Queensland died.<br />
And Mr Bjelke-Petersen appointed an anti-Labor Senator<br />
to take the place of the Labor Senator who died. If the<br />
Labor Senator had still been alive he would have been voting<br />
as he had all the years hie was in Parliament, he would have<br />
been voting with the Labor Party. And in that case, these<br />
six motions to adjourn the Bill would have been defeated<br />
because there would have been as many Senators voting<br />
against the motion as were voting in favour of the motion.<br />
That is, there would have been an equal number of votes<br />
and the motion to adjourn would have been defeated. And<br />
as Senator Steele Hall has said: the motion to adjourn the<br />
debate on the Budget Bills was carried over a dead man's corpse.<br />
Because the Liberals know that if they were'to have a vote<br />
to reject the Budget, then some of their people would vote<br />
to pass it. Because not all Liberals are fascists; there<br />
are some decent Liberals...<br />
The only way that Mr Fraser can keep all his people<br />
in line, is to movre an amendment to defer the vote to put<br />
it off, to postpone it, to stall it, because if he were to have<br />
a vote on passing or rejecting the Budget, t-he Budget would<br />
be passed. And it would be a very good Budget indeed,<br />
because there are three million people who would pay smaller<br />
taxes once the Budget is passed. And there are half a million<br />
people who have to pay income tax now, who will not have to<br />
pay income tax once the Budget is passed. And instead of<br />
having these tax concessions or deductions, which benefit<br />
the rich people much more than they benefit the poor people,<br />
there will be a system of rebates which will be of equal value<br />
to everybody, whatever their incomes. This is a very good<br />
Budget indeed. It is the best Budget this country has put to<br />
the Parliament for years and years.<br />
This Budget will particularly help migrants, it<br />
will help'the family man, the working man, the underpriviledged,<br />
the disadvantaged, the newcomers. It is of particular benefit </p>
<p>for migrants. And the Liberals don't want you to feel and<br />
enjoy the benefits of Bill Hayden's Budget. And they've<br />
got no alternatives themselves. Because when Mr Fraser started<br />
the debate on the Budget on the Opposition side, everybody<br />
saw the disadvantages that would come if they got the chance.<br />
Because there is going to be two lots of income tax, not<br />
only Federal income tax but State income tax on top of that,<br />
if the Liberals become the national Government. And now<br />
they say that their Budget proposals are inoperative. You<br />
remember that infamous word that President Nixon's Press<br />
Secretary came out with, that a particular thing that the<br />
President had said was " inoperative". Well that's what<br />
they say now about their Budget. And they don't vote<br />
against the Budget; they say that if there's going to be<br />
an election for the House of Representatives, they will pass<br />
the Budget... They're blackmailing you, they're depriving you<br />
of the benefits of this Budget.<br />
You ladies and gentlemen who come from overseas<br />
have seen from your own bitter experience, that of your mothers<br />
and fathers, how the reactionary, conservative and fascist elements<br />
in * your countries have stopped at nothing to destroy democracy.<br />
It's warning to see on an occasion like this, that<br />
the people of Melbourne, and particularly the people in<br />
Melbourne who were born overseas, want to see that democracy<br />
is preserved in Australia. Because migrants in particular<br />
realise that in my Government they have the first national<br />
Government which has ever been interested in their welfare.<br />
Because Liberal Government the government of Menzies and<br />
Holt and Gorton and Billy McMahon once the migrants arrived<br />
at the airport or at the port, they lost interest in them.<br />
They were only interested until they landed or alighted in<br />
Australia. After that they were factory fodder. And the<br />
migrants. in Australia have been the principal victims of our<br />
unplanned cities and our impoverished schools and our expensive<br />
hospitals. </p>
<p>You know it' s the Labor Government which has<br />
made sure that wherever people live in Australia, wherever<br />
they were born, whatever their occupation, whatever their<br />
income, they will have equal opportunities in this country.<br />
It is the Labor Government which has seen that You<br />
are entitled to get citizenship rights all after-the same<br />
length of time: no first, second, third grades of citizens;<br />
everybody who comes to Australia is treated the same.<br />
You are all entitled to portability of pensions; if you<br />
become entitled to any social welfare payments in Australia<br />
then you can now enjoy those payments anywhere in the world.<br />
And if you have dependent wives or children or parents<br />
in another country, you can get benefit from your taxation<br />
for them before they get here. You're now having ethnic<br />
radio stations; you can hear on the radio, you can hear<br />
programs of your own choice, in your own language when you<br />
want. You now have legal aid, you have Medibank, and if you<br />
ring up a Federal Government Department you can speak to<br />
people in your own language or you can get your documents<br />
translated. We have looked for people to appoint to government<br />
commissions and boards and departments. Because we have<br />
appointed migrants to Qantas; we've appointed migrants<br />
to the Universities Commission' we'ye appointed migrants<br />
to the Australia Council; we've appointed migrants to the<br />
International Women's Year National Committee; we'vye<br />
appointed migrants to the Australian Broadcasting Commission;<br />
we've appointed migrants as Head of Government Departments.<br />
Certainly we've been criticised for these things. But there<br />
is no doubt, for the first time, under the Labor Government<br />
elected in 1972 and re-elected in 1974 for a three year term,<br />
migrants are being considered for government appointments.<br />
You are now getting all the opportunities which<br />
are available to people who were born here. Don't lose it:<br />
support the Labor Government which brought these benefits. ./ 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
The Government that you elected twice, the<br />
Government which you most recently elected in May last year,<br />
the Parliament which was first able to meet on the 9th<br />
July last year, the Parliament, the Government, which you<br />
elected for three years still has a Labor majority.<br />
And with your support and the support of millions of your<br />
fellow Australians, you will have a three year Government,<br />
a people's Government, with a majority in'the People's House. </p>
