MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT, HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, MP.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S RECORD OCTOBER 1972<br />
Interviewer Paul Lynch<br />
Q. Prime Minister, criticism was often voiced of you as<br />
a Prime Minister in your first months in your oresent office,<br />
as being a man who had a good technician's interest in the<br />
process of government and of politics, but not a man who had<br />
a very clear * icture of where Australia would be perhaps<br />
five or ten years from then. Do you think that in recent<br />
months, you have altered this impression?<br />
PM: Yes, I think first of all that the criticism is a little<br />
unfair because I had to fit into the office and I faced<br />
difficulties of an unparalleled kind. I don't think any other<br />
Prime liinister had to face thc samc number and range of<br />
difficulties that I had to face. Then when I found that the<br />
economic conditions were changing and that I was getting<br />
increasing control over the Party, then of course I could adopt<br />
the proper role for a Prime Minister, and that was to take a<br />
national approach and a vision for the future that I think has<br />
been evident, really evident over the course of at least the<br />
last eight to ten months.<br />
Q. Whnich would you describe as the foremost of the new<br />
directions that you have pointed out in the last eight to<br />
ten months?<br />
PM: Naturally enough, I would like to look first of all at<br />
problems like education, of what we did in the Budget with<br />
the reduction of taxation, of the suoport for pensioners,<br />
and half a dozen other policy changes of a radical kind that<br />
we introduced there. T would like to look at the health changes<br />
that we made, and our chanaes in international relations as<br />
well.<br />
Q. In terms of international relations, Prime Minister, what<br />
new directions do you see there? / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
PM: In recent days we have become a member of the United<br />
Nations Security Council which has the problem of looking<br />
after world peace. We have become c wember of the Organisation<br />
for Economic Co-operation and Development, one of the most<br />
importz-1. -onomic committees that there is. Recently a<br />
delegati(. came from Japan, headed by Mr Ohira, accompanied<br />
by four ocher very senior Ministers, to talk over our common<br />
economic, trade and social relationships. All these indicate<br />
that other countries are very interested in us, they know the<br />
influence we have in the Pacific Theatre, and they are confident<br />
that we in Australia will play our Dart in trying to ensure<br />
peace in this area and make our contribution to development<br />
at the same time.<br />
Q. In domestic terms, Prime Minister, you have been talking<br />
more or less about the matter of relationships between<br />
governments relationships between Australians and the way<br />
individual Australians lead their lives. What i'o you think<br />
are the most significant changes for which you would care to<br />
take responsibility?<br />
PM: First of all I would have to mention the taxation changes<br />
and the changes relating to social services, welfare, housing<br />
and also hospitals and medical attention. These all concern<br />
and affect the individual. But we have gone even wider than<br />
that in the education and arts. We have done more in actual<br />
performances than I can remember has ever been done before.<br />
We have assisted, too, with conservation and environment, and<br />
we have done a lot to help the aborigines. So that if you<br />
look at these cultural matters, then I think you can accept<br />
the fact, nce you look at the record, that these have been<br />
remarkable developments and they are taking us into a new<br />
kind of a world, and a new vision of the kind of world you<br />
want for succeeding generations of Australians, because I believe<br />
now, we must concentrate more and more on youth and give them<br />
the opportunity to express themselves, to find delight in their<br />
surroundings, and to be able to fully join in every aspect of<br />
the life of the community.<br />
Q. Final point, Prime Minister, and fairly briefly, I'p<br />
afraid to out to you the question that it was claimed you<br />
couldn't answer in the middle of last year : What do you see<br />
as being the future of Austraha?<br />
PM: I don't know of any country at all that has a brighter<br />
prospect than we have, providing only we have sound and<br />
sensible government and proper management of the business of<br />
state. We are a wealthy country. We can become increasingly<br />
wealthy. We can give our people greater opportunities than<br />
they have ever had before. We can give them the education<br />
they need, the health services and the housing they need,<br />
and this, after all, is the foundation on which they, the<br />
people themselves, can spread their wings and I think get into<br />
a new age of a new development that will bring a great deal of<br />
contentment and happiness to them.<br />
Prime Minister, thank you very mv'ch. </p>
