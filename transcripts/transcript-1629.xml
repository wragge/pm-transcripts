Speech by the Prime M inister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
OPENING OF MURRAY 1 PO.: 3R STATION<br />
KHANC0j3A, 22ND JULY, 1967.<br />
Mr. Fairbairn; Mr. Morton representin the Government<br />
of New South " ales; Mr. Rylah the Government of Victoria; and<br />
Mr. Riches the Government of South Australia; Mr. Courtney<br />
representing Her Majesty's Opposition in the Federal Parliament;<br />
Mr. Pettitt representin the Country Party; Sir ' illiam Hudson;<br />
Mr. Raymond Hill MLr. . ilkinson, f. Thiess Mr. Perini and Mr.<br />
Loutit who are all representative of Contractors who participated<br />
in this gre: at scheme; and also Mr. Rodd; and then the Commissioners;<br />
Mr. Dann and the Assistant Commissioners, Messrs. ; arrell and<br />
Skinner; Your Excellencies; ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I felt I should give you that full introduction oecause<br />
it helps to demonstrate just how many people and interests have<br />
been participating in this magnificent scheme. I come to the<br />
Project today, not to the Snowy Scheme generally for the first<br />
time but erha s not as often as I should or would have wished,<br />
usually concerning myself with the Snowy Project from the documents<br />
which reach us in Cabinet, the graphs, he diagrams the pictures,<br />
the statistics and the narrative; and we sit around the able<br />
as each year the Minister puts his bid ( as the Treasury rather<br />
indelicately calls these a -nroaches from Departments) and we<br />
consider what we should aptly for the needs-of the Snowy Mountains<br />
Authority in a particular year. 3ut I find it a very different<br />
thing from doing that to come to what is for most of us a rather<br />
remote area and to see carved out of the native wilderness this<br />
magnificent engineering project.<br />
I don't know how most of you feel about it as most of<br />
you no doubt close to the project itself have become a bit blase<br />
about it out to me it is a stirring thin. to feel that here in<br />
this young country of ours we have added this magnificent engineering<br />
achievement, this further stage in what has oeen a most imaginative,<br />
ambitious Australian project, the largest and in many ways the<br />
most successful that we have ever undertaken. And it spells out<br />
quite a few things to us as we have heard the Minister give us his<br />
stor it was a very good story, I thought, because it absorbed<br />
about five of the best points I had hoped to make to you here this<br />
afternoon. 3ut, be that as it may, as he unfolded this story we<br />
had a picture before us of the happy combination of Government decision<br />
and planning with the enterprise of competitive entrepreneurs,<br />
themselves setting out to give the oest service they could on a<br />
tender basis and' how successfully that has oeen was demonstrated<br />
by the Minister in his speech.<br />
I was certiinly most impressed and it couldn't have<br />
been a more timely tonic to me, having come from three days,<br />
afternoons and nights of Cabinet discussions on the Judgel to<br />
find at least here is one section of the Australian economy<br />
measured in terms of Government financial provision which is<br />
keeping inside its 3udget allocation, inside its estimate, and<br />
producing the results inside the scheduled time. That is a<br />
matter for congratulation, of course, to all concerned.<br />
The other thing which must strike anyone who cares to<br />
think about the matter at all, sitting in this reat ouilding,<br />
is how well we do in Australia to recognise that with less than<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
12 million people trying to develop a continent the size of the<br />
United States we make he machine and we make power come in aid<br />
of our quite inadequate population.<br />
Here I suppose the actual mannower involved in operating<br />
this equiroment, :. hich will bring to INew South . iales and Victoria<br />
the additional electrical power to assist industrial growth in those<br />
States, will be quite minimal when compared with the outpouring of<br />
power from these impressive machines. So we have much cause, not<br />
only for conratulation for those who have contrijuted to the<br />
enterprise, but of self-congratulation as a nation that we are<br />
seizing the opportunities available to us and making machine and<br />
power serve the needs of the Australian population.<br />
This is the first phase, I am told, of the Snowy/ Murray<br />
diversion. The three earlier power stations already opened Guthega<br />
in 1955, Tumut 1 in 1959 and Tumut 2 in 1962 ha-e a combined<br />
capacity of six hundred and sixty thousand kilowatts. This new<br />
Murray 1 Power Station is lar er than all of them together, with a<br />
capacity of nine hundred and fifty thousand kilowatts.<br />
It is important to see this particular occasion in its full<br />
context. Immediately, this power station marks the first completed<br />
project in the second half oi the two-pronged Snowy development.<br />
Today's opening represents the expenditure of two hundred million<br />
dollars one quarter of the estimated total cost of the scheme of<br />
eight hundred million dollars, and the revenue already received is<br />
of the order of one hundred million dollars. So the Government is<br />
not only getting this project completed within the time allowed for it<br />
and within the cost estimated for it 17 or 18 years ago, but it is<br />
getting its money oack on time as well.<br />
It goes without saying that there has been great skill both<br />
in planning and execution to bring a nroject as large as this to its<br />
oresent stage without excesses of cost or time. There must by now be<br />
many thousands of Australians to whom the nation should be grateful<br />
for this achievement and not really our fellow Australians but all<br />
who have contributed from whatever country to this project. I am<br />
sure that the Ministers responsible Sir .; illiam Hudson ( who so richly<br />
deserves the tribute warmlyaccordea him by the Minister), our able<br />
present Commissioner, Mr. Dann, would all want to je amongst the<br />
first to pay tribute to the many thousands of workers, many of them<br />
recruited from overseas, whose untiring work has brought all this<br />
about. Nor could it have , een achieved without the work of the<br />
many engineers, skilled in a wide variety of disciplines and<br />
techniques who helped plan it all and watched over its successful<br />
achievement. In this spirit I am sure you will recognise my motive if<br />
I permit myself to mention specially the various Ministers in<br />
successive Commonwealth Governments who have played their part of<br />
leadership in the project. There was first Mr. Nelson Lemmon,<br />
Minister for ' orks in the Chifley Government; and then successive<br />
Ministers in our own Governments since the end of 1949; our present<br />
Governor-General, Lord Casey; the late Sir . illiam Spocner; and now<br />
my colleague iMr. Fairoairn; and, together over the past years since<br />
1949, they have oeen responsiule for bringing this scheme towards its<br />
full maturity. I should also mention the willing and effective<br />
co-operation in this great scheme that we have received from successive<br />
Premiers of New South ' ales and Victoria and their Public ' orks<br />
Departments and Electricity Authorities, and of course the South </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Australian Government has also had a close interest in this<br />
development. jehind them all as guidiny and guardian angel has<br />
stood Sir Hilliam Hudson. In fact it might also oe called " The<br />
Hudson Authority", so closely hAs he been associated with it. 7e<br />
are very glad to see him here today and the nation owes him the<br />
conratulations and thanks already voiced uy my colleague. all<br />
join in wishing all those concerned including Mr. Dann and his<br />
colleagues, successful progress as they carry on the good work.<br />
The fact is, of course, that the Snowy Project,<br />
although it serves directly in principle two of the major States,<br />
is a national achievement and serves national purposes. It has<br />
been warmly supported oy all political parties and all of us, as<br />
Australians, can take pride in the example it his set us in many<br />
fields. It has been the product of successful co-operation oetween<br />
the Commonwealth and the State Governments between management and<br />
workers. In a sense it has been an international project as the<br />
flags that you see around you here today will help to indicate.<br />
International in that some 33 nationalities are represented amongst<br />
the employees of the Snowy Scheme and amongst the contractors and the<br />
suppliers there are of course many countries re" resented is well.<br />
Fallure in any of these import &gt; nt relationships" ould have materially<br />
affected the successful working of the roject but, ouite obviously<br />
from the results, that cooperation has een close and effective.<br />
I now want to say a word also as my colleague did,<br />
about our attitude to the future of the Snowy Aountains Authority.<br />
It will oe immediately recognised that a good deal of the success of<br />
the organisation springs directly from the fact that they have been<br />
associated with a project so exciting in itself, the nation's largest<br />
single effort at development. In a sense, the very name the Snowy<br />
Mountains Authority implies that its role ends once the Snowy Project<br />
has been completed. There would be understandable criticism if the<br />
Authority were retained fully in its present form without any major<br />
project to sustain it and I am sure nboody, least of all those<br />
associated with it, , wants to see the Snowy Authority to turn before<br />
our eyes into a sort of white elephant.<br />
But there are skills and experience gained in the<br />
course of this great project which it is eminently desirable to have<br />
continue serving the national interest and, with this in mind the<br />
Government has turned in a responsible and constructive spirit to<br />
seeing how much of the very valuaole skills and experience now<br />
existing in the staff of the Authority could oe retained for further<br />
projects of national importance. After a great deal of thought, it<br />
has oecome clear that elements of the investigation design and<br />
scientific services staff, including the hydraulic laooratories, could<br />
very usefully be retained. Staff in these sections will not form a<br />
nucleus for construction activities but, with their snecialised skills,<br />
will be available to assist in major civil engineerin .: ork. It is<br />
in this field particularly that the Authority has justly earned<br />
Australian and even world-wide acclaim.<br />
Je found that Commonwealth and Territory programmes<br />
were not in themselves on a scale sufficient to maintain even these<br />
important skills, so we approached the State Governments who have<br />
themselves of course lirge constructive authorities, to see if they<br />
had suitaole civil works in which they would ue prepared to engage<br />
the Authority on a scale which would sustain a workable organisaion.<br />
It now seems that the States individually would not have sufficient work<br />
to justify retaining the specialised and necessarily expensive skills<br />
of the Authority. But we find that their combined needs would justify<br />
maintaining the specialist staff I have mentioned. So we can see an<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
important future for those who remain with the Authority. It is a<br />
future which I like to see as spreading the successes which have<br />
attended the Snowy venture into many parts of the Continent, and<br />
overseas as well, in support of our Colombo Plan projects.<br />
Just oefore we came here, Mr. Dann very kindly<br />
presented to my wife and myself a oeautiful small table made up<br />
of stones taken not only from projects in the Snowy area, but also<br />
from those projects which the onowy authority has assisted in<br />
overseas as part of our Colomoo Plan arrangements. This will be<br />
a constant reminder to me that there is a usefulness in the Authority<br />
which stretches even beyond the border of this country.<br />
I am sure we can see the future of the Authority<br />
in this way as forward looking constructive and efficient. There<br />
will be no need to look back Ath regret on the disbanding of a highly<br />
efficient organisation geared to achieve a very special purpose.<br />
Rather, we will be looking forward to a new Authority holding<br />
to-ether important specialist services and we will be seeing those<br />
not needed for this purpose taking the skills they have learned and<br />
applied in the Snowy pro ect out into the highways and plains of<br />
Australia and perhaps into other parts of the world in our immediate<br />
neighbourhood. And in this connection, Mr. Morton, we were delighted<br />
to learn that the offer we made to the Government of New South '
that the advisory and designing services of the Authority could be<br />
made available on suitable terms to your Government in relation<br />
to the Eastern Suburos Railway, has oeen gldly accepted by the<br />
Government of New South * ales.<br />
Turning to development generally, there will always<br />
oe found, of course, critics to argue that a government is not doing<br />
enough for development. This Tovernment, we believe, is doing a very<br />
great deal and we turn to the facts to tell that story for us. There<br />
has ueen, over recent years in particular, a remarkable development<br />
in Australia both oy private enterprise and by puolic authorities.<br />
The result has been that Australia devotes a greater proportion of<br />
its national product to fixed capital investment than does any other<br />
major country in the world with the exception of Japan. That is the<br />
only country that surpasses Australia in what it reserves from its<br />
gross national product for its fixed capital investment. Our<br />
percentage is in the neighbourhood of 27% of our national product<br />
compared with just under 25% in Canada, 24% in NIew Zealand, and around<br />
about 16% or 17% in the United States and the United Kingdom. This<br />
investment comes very largely from our own domestic savings. ie<br />
take pride in having an economy which can and does produce savings<br />
of this order and a people responsible enough to accumulate them in<br />
a continent which cries out for development.<br />
Over the past ten years there has in fact been an<br />
increase in the percent ige of our gross national product devoted to<br />
capital expenditure by pblic authorities. Ten years ago a little<br />
over 3 per cent of went to public authority investment. Now<br />
it is a-little over 4 per cent and that is just short of the total<br />
percentage of our G._ I that we now apply for defence purposes.<br />
This increase reflects the concern which we and other Governments<br />
have with providing our fellow Australians with their basic needs.<br />
But the smallness of the fiures underlines at the same time the<br />
wide scope left for the rest of the community to plan and execute<br />
its own investment decisions.<br />
In its own field of expenditure the Commonwealth<br />
has oontinued to place great emphasis on capital works. If defence<br />
expenditures are excluded, the pro ortion of expenditure from revenue<br />
devoted to capital works has over he past 10 years remained over </p>
<p>of the total and, as I shall mention in a little more detail<br />
later, this has been coupled with ra-idly increasing grants to the<br />
States for important capital works.<br />
The place of the Snowy project in the Commonwealth's<br />
own capital works prora~ mme is interesting. In 1949-50 we sent<br />
million dollars on The Snowy and that was 4% of our total capital<br />
works expenditure. The peak of expenditure on the Snowy was in<br />
1959-Go when we spent 56 million dollars and it occupied no less than<br />
2U% of our capital works budget. As the Scheme nears fruition and as<br />
other caoital works projects are developed, the proportion of the<br />
Commonwealth's capital works expenditure devoted to the Snowy has<br />
now reduced to auout 10%, but this is one demonstration of the<br />
broadening of the Commonwealth's developmental activities.<br />
In the late 1940' s there was a concentration on<br />
the Snowy project. That was due partly to its size but partly, I<br />
suggest, oecause there were not many other major projects being<br />
developed. with our new emphasis on development at particular<br />
places and to meet particular needs, the number of active developments<br />
has increased enormously. In the private sphere there are at present<br />
associated mostly with mining some'of the biggest projects being<br />
carried on in Australia today. In the public sphere the concentration<br />
is on transport and on water. . es-tern Australia and Queensland in<br />
narticular are benefiting from the 50 million dollar programme for<br />
the construction of beef cattle roads. . iestern Australia and South<br />
Australia are benefiting from the Commonwealth's expenditures on rail<br />
standardisation in Western iAustralia alone the Comnmonwealth has<br />
provided some 53 million dollars since 1962-65 for these purposes.<br />
NewSouth -ales and Victoria have benefited from the Snowy Scheme<br />
itself and from other assistance iven b the Commonwealth. I think,<br />
for example, of the development of coal loading works at Newcastle<br />
Port Kemola and jalmain in New South ' iales, of the railway standardization<br />
and the Murray River developments, including the 3ufFalo and<br />
Chowilla Reservoirs in Victoria. In Tasmania we have agreed to<br />
assist with the financing of the Gordon River Project which will<br />
accelerate hydro-electric development in that State.<br />
In addition to these projects, the Commonwealth<br />
has been active in promoting the national water resources development<br />
programme which was announced in my policy speech last year. Through<br />
this scheme we are wanting to extend the conservation and use of<br />
water in rural industry and Australia surely is a country which<br />
desperately needs development of this kind.' There are many other<br />
projects related to water use and conservation with which the<br />
Commonwealth has been associated. I hardly need rehearse these,<br />
but they show how importantly we rate the efficient use of water and<br />
how widely spread are the projects we are willing to assist.<br />
In all of these projects we are tryin, to take a<br />
national view. The money and resources bein' devoted to them are too<br />
important and too scarce to waste. ; e cannot afford inefficiency or<br />
laxity to enter into our decisions aoout development projects. , e<br />
have made them and will continue to make them on the oasis of<br />
jud ments about tieir economic importance and their national significance.<br />
Much as we all would like to see our own particul r local projects<br />
prosper, the national government will only oe serving the people best<br />
when it endeavours to see parochial considerations in their national<br />
setting and act in the interests of the nation as a whole.<br />
As I have su gested, our concern for development<br />
has extended beyond the projecs undertaken by the Commonwealth and<br />
its instrumentalities. In this the Snowy Authority is an example of<br />
whit is becoming a firmly established Commonwealth policy. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
ie reco nise th-t both the national and ti. e<br />
State governments canm n should play significant parts in the<br />
development of australia. The Snowy has men one such development.<br />
is it araws to its conclusion, the important skills it possesses<br />
will be made availale to all pulic : uthorities throughout the<br />
Commonwealth. Likewise we hive accelerated greatly our grants to<br />
the States for canital purnoses. Ten years a ro tiese grants totalled<br />
only 60 million dllars-la-st year they totailed 257 million dollars<br />
and will be over 325 million dollirs this year. It can oe seen that,<br />
far from the Commonwealth's expenditures on its own capital projects<br />
declininY as expenditure reduces on its . reatejt single project the<br />
Snowy Scheme they are, in point of fao rapidly increasing. Further,<br />
the emphasis is on partnership with the States in'the int-rests of the<br />
nation as a whole. Turning now to m immediate task today it is to<br />
open the Murray 1 Project. I am old that each of the 10 , eneratin.<br />
units in this station can ce started un automaticail ly by the closin.<br />
of a switch in the control room. For The purposes of today's<br />
ceremony I have been told to close the switch in front of me. Now<br />
I add that any memuer of my family knows ti-t my mechanical ineptitude<br />
is a matter of notoriety. At one point you are asked not to leave<br />
this p lace until we have done so. I asked Mr. Dann what closing a<br />
switch meant whether you pushed it foriaird or pulled it Oack. I<br />
regret to say he ; asn't too sure himself and I hope that if I pull<br />
it the wron, way, you all don't leave this place oefore I do.<br />
However, I ave since oeen -cmforted by the information from Mr.<br />
Dann that it only moves in one direction. So, by a fairly simple<br />
process of trial and error, we shall get there. When I do eventually<br />
successfully pull it in the right direction, the Numoer 1 unit will<br />
start its full automatic sequence if everything goes according to<br />
plan and will be comnnectyd to the line for the generation of<br />
ower. It and the nine other units will each ce aule to produce<br />
thousand kiloiatts of power for tAe grid which links New South<br />
ales and Victoria for power purposes. I understand that, apart<br />
from the noise you have already heard, you will hear some noise from<br />
the turbine valve when I close the switch and the water be rins to<br />
turn the t. uroines. ithin acout 20 seconds the machine wil oe: in<br />
to rotate and then two minutes later the turbine will be producing<br />
full power. So0 -is I now close the sitch, I have much pleasure<br />
in declaring open the Murray 1 PoKer Station. </p>
