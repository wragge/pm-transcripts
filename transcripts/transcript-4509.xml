ELECTORATE TALK<br />
For most of us who live in the great cities, the problems of outback<br />
life are given little or only very cursory thought. We are<br />
preoccupied with our own problems, our own backyard.<br />
For Governments too particularly a Canberra-based national<br />
Government the problems of outback living can sometimes be<br />
very easily misunderstood. This can then often lead to Government<br />
policy solutions that are much less than satisfactory. It is then<br />
that politicians and public servants hear the cry ' you just don't<br />
understand our real--problems; you spend all your time in Canberra;<br />
how can you understand?' Perhaps there is more validity to this<br />
cry than politicians care to admit.<br />
It was for that basic reason that I and Government colleagues made<br />
a visit to central, western and northern Queensland during the week.<br />
The visit certainly brought home a vivid picture of the concerns<br />
and the needs of thousands of men, women and children who have made<br />
that part of Australia their home.<br />
Most Australians enjoy and appreciate such services as handy schools,<br />
television and daily postal services. . In fact, we take them very<br />
much for granted. For families living in isolated areas like<br />
central western Queensland, these kind of services simply do not<br />
exist. They do not play a part in their lives. Mail can often<br />
take up to two or three weeks to get to and from a capital city.<br />
Television reception either black and white or colour is a<br />
luxury that is frequently only enjoyed on a visit to Brisbane or<br />
another large city, while schooling is frequently left to parental<br />
care, or is conducted over a radio phone. The great distances and<br />
physical conditions also present their own special problems such<br />
as high transport maintenance costs and fuel costs.<br />
Perhaps not surprisingly, this kind of life breeds an independence,<br />
a sense of purpose and a bluntness in speech. This is not an unruly<br />
bluntness. It is not unreasonable. It is not unfair. It is simply<br />
a no-nonsense way of meeting and talking about problems head on.<br />
It implies as I found out particularly when talking to a deputation<br />
of trade unionists from the township of Mary Kathleen also<br />
a willingness to listen to another view. It implies a willingness<br />
to listen to argument without resort to unlawful or unreasonable<br />
behaviour. / Politicians </p>
<p>-2<br />
Politicians from all political parties and community leaders<br />
from all walks of life could do much worse than seek to emulate<br />
the kind of spirit that is very much in evidence in outback<br />
Queensland. Despite the-clearly obvious difficulties in day to day living,<br />
the men and women I and my colleagues spoke with were uncomplaining.<br />
They accepted that some of their problems could be overcome with<br />
work, imagination and a willingness to help each other out. Of<br />
course, these people know that decisions of Government have a very<br />
real and direct effect on their way of life.<br />
I and my Government are acutely aware of the need to get a firsthand<br />
knowledge of the problems, so that we can at least be in a<br />
position-to make policy decisions that can have practical effect.<br />
While the people we met were appreciative of the measures the<br />
Government is taking to aid the rural community during its current<br />
difficulties, they were not willing to ' leave it all to the<br />
Government'. These families value their independence. They value what they have<br />
built. They are determined that their effort and the efforts of<br />
their forebears on the land will not be thrown away.<br />
Despite the very serious problems in the rural community, particularly<br />
among beef produ'cers, -th-6" Queenslanders we met this week are facing<br />
the future with spirit and determination. They have confidence<br />
in their own ability to see through this difficult time. They have<br />
confidence in their state, and certainly have a great confidence in<br />
their country. It is Part of their make-up and part of their<br />
character. I believe it is a part that all Australians should seek to copy. </p>
