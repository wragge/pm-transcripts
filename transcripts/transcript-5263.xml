SOUTH AUSTRALIAN FIRES<br />
The Prime Minister today expressed concern at the<br />
injuries-to people and damage to property suffered as<br />

Cape Jervis regions of South Australia. In particular<br />
Mr. Fraser expressed sympathy to the three firemen<br />
who are now hospitalised.<br />
In expressing this concern to the Premier of<br />
South Australia, Mr. Fraser offered the State assistance<br />
under the Natural Disasters Assistance arrangements if<br />
that should prove necessary. The South Australian<br />
authorities have sought some Defence Force assistance and<br />
a number of servicemen have been made available.<br />
