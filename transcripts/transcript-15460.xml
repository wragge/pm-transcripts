    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce Australian Government funding for the Townsville International Sports Centre, clearing the way for work to begin in July.</p>
<p>My Government will contribute $6,355,000 to the project at the Murray's Sports Complex in Annandale, delivered in two stages under the Regional Partnerships Program.</p>
<p>The money will assist Townsville City Council design and construct the new Centre.  When complete, the Centre will boast a spectator capacity of 1,400 and will be capable of hosting both national and international events.  It will raise the region's sporting profile and create employment opportunities for Townsville and surrounds. </p>
<p>The Centre will be home to a number of sporting teams, including the Townsville's Women's National Basketball League and the North Queensland Steel Cats. It will also be able to be used as a disaster recovery centre for the Townsville region if required.  </p>
<p>Peter Lindsay MP has as usual been a vocal advocate in his support for this important project for the Townsville community.</p>
<p>I congratulate the local community for working together to access Regional Partnerships Program funding and particularly thank the North Queensland Area Consultative Committee for helping to bring this project to fruition.</p>
<p>The Regional Partnerships Program continues the Australian Government's approach of working with local communities to support their ideas, to generate economic activity and improved social amenity.</p>
<p>The initial contribution of $3.355 million from the Regional Partnerships Program will allow work to begin on the design and construction in July. Today I also commit a further $3 million for the subsequent phases of the project, in consultation with the Townsville City Council.</p>
