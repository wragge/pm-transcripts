PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY AUGUST 23 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The budget introduced into Parliament last week by the<br />
Treasurer, John Howard, represents the clearest possible<br />
statement of the Government's intention to maintain the<br />
priority we have always placed on providing a better life.<br />
for individual Australians and their families. For the budget<br />
will strengthen prosperity, maintain confidence and provide<br />
the creation of yet more new jobs in the private sector by<br />
further restraining Government spending and continuing the<br />
thrust towards smaller government, and by bearing down on<br />
interest rates and inflationary pressures.<br />
At the same time, it is a budget which increases assistance<br />
to a large number of people in the community who are in particular<br />
need, which strengthens our national security and which lays a<br />
basis for sustainable reductions in the tax burden on individuals<br />
and families. It is a budget which will strengthen the revival<br />
of Australia's economy that has come about as a result of the<br />
policies consistently pursued by the Government since 1975.<br />
These policies have led to higher employment, bctter wages and<br />
living standards and lower inflation.<br />
In considering a budget, we need to realise that the most<br />
fundamental requirement it-to achieve overall-economic stability,<br />
for only in this way can we secure the opportunties and improve<br />
standards of living. which everyone wants. If the basic policy<br />
approach established in the budget is not right, no other policies<br />
can be effectively implemented.<br />
It was this important fact that the Labor Government ignored<br />
between 1972 and 1975, to the lasting cost of alli Australians,<br />
and theircurrent policies and attitudes make clear they have<br />
still not learned this lesson.<br />
There has been much comment on the decisions we have made on<br />
sales taxes. But let me put these decisions into perspective.<br />
During the last year, there has been a real increase in wages<br />
of some This means that up to $ 3,000 million has been added<br />
to real living standards. By comparison, the sa). es tax decisions<br />
will. raise a total of about $ 550 milIlion. this ye. tr,* and by enabling<br />
us to bring the budget almost into balance, that extra revenue<br />
will enable Australian families to enjoy continuo,. d increases : in<br />
prosperity. The most basic objective of all our policies has been, and remains,<br />
to reduce the overall burden of taxation on families. The budget<br />
has made a valuable step towards shifting the balance of taxes<br />
away from directon to indirect taxes. As the Treasurer has pointed / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
out, one of the consequences of this is that it increases<br />
* the potential for desirable reductions in direct taxes and<br />
particulary personal income tax as economic and budgetary<br />
conditions permit.<br />
I might also remind you that earlier this year in July,<br />
we introduced income tax cuts that will leave some $ 500 million<br />
more in tax payers' pockets, and they have started to do so<br />
already. The new tax rebate of 32 cents in the dollar for<br />
basic health insurance will return a further $ 600 million<br />
to individual income tax payers. That just shows we are<br />
concerned very much about reducing the tax burden.<br />
Since we first took office nearly 6 years ago, the<br />
Government has stressed that ther'e is only one way to lower<br />
the tax burden in a real and sustainable way, and that is by<br />
holding down government spending. In this year's budget,<br />
after allowing for meeting the extra expen . se of an extra<br />
pay period for pension, benefit and salary payments, a<br />
phenomenon which occurs only once in every 12 years or so,<br />
budget outlays increased by less than-1% in real terms.<br />
We have now cut back government spending to only about<br />
27 cents in every dollar produced in Australia, compared<br />
with over 30 cents in every dollar taken by government in<br />
1975/ 76, and under Labor, the proportion was rising rapidly.<br />
Our objective remains to cut it back still further.<br />
We have also in this budget virtually eliminated the huge'<br />
budget deficit inherited from the disastrous Labor years,<br />
and by doing so we have not only laid the foundations for<br />
reducing the tax burden, but we have also reduced claims for<br />
capital funds to ease pressure on interest rates.<br />
In all these ways, our concern for Australians and their<br />
well-being is clearly expressed. Moreover, in our expendituxe<br />
decisions we have given further emphasis to the needs of groups<br />
which include those most in need in the community.<br />
Spending on social welfare and security will rise significantly<br />
in real terms because of continued automatic indexation of pensions<br />
and benefits, because of increased family allowances for larger<br />
families, a group which includes many of the poorest,<br />
because we have begun a programme of crisis accommodation<br />
with special emphasis on families in distress, and because we:<br />
have redirected and increased the programme of rental assistance<br />
to pensioners and long term sickness beneficiaries.<br />
The 1981/ 82 budget is one that looks to the immediate problems<br />
of needy. groups, but also to the long term interests of all<br />
Australians and their families. </p>
