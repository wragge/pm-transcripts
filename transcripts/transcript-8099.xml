PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT<br />
22 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Pleasure Paul.<br />
LYNEHAM: There seems to be a fairly wide-spread sense of<br />
anti-climax about the Budget. Did the Government overdo<br />
the pre-Budget hype, do you think, about how tough it was<br />
going to be?<br />
PM: I don't think so Paul. If you look at the reaction<br />
today, in one sense we must have got it right because<br />
half the people are saying we've been too tough and the<br />
other half are saying we haven't been tough enough. But<br />
there's a fair chance we might have got it about right.<br />
LYNEHAM: Right or wrong there is a perception that the<br />
absence of statements on telecommunications and the<br />
government airlines diminished in some way the stature of<br />
this budget creating the impression that you're all<br />
running out of steam. Should you have got cracking<br />
earlier on these issues and pushed harder on them?<br />
PM: We couldn't have pushed harder than we have in the<br />
area of micro-economic reform. I mean you know Paul,<br />
you're a careful watcher of the political scene, and you<br />
know that there hasn't been any answer from the<br />
conservatives or from any commentators to my challenge<br />
which I put at the end of last year and during the<br />
election campaign. The challenge was simple. I said,<br />
you point to any period in the history of this country<br />
where a government has undertaken such a massive and<br />
quick program of micro-economic reform.<br />
LYNEHAM: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: It's absolutely right. But we were honest Paul<br />
about two areas that could not be dealt with in the<br />
Budget. That is telecommunications and the airlines, the<br />
** possible disposition of the airlines or dilution of<br />
public ownership. That required consideration by the<br />
conference of my Party. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: What do you think of the idea of using<br />
privatisation revenue specifically for public<br />
infrastructure like rail, road and public housing?<br />
PM: What you've got to there's enormous merit in that<br />
concept what you've got to understand is the essential<br />
source which you can use and the people talking to<br />
understand this, is the savings interest that you'd<br />
get from the disposition of public assets.. Because<br />
that's the real continuing saving.<br />
LYNEHAM: You use it to retire debt. interest you<br />
save then goes into<br />
PM: That is so. I mean, you save and that's a<br />
continuing saving. That's the sense which people should<br />
understand. This is not a one-off benefit. That saving<br />
** is a continuing saving and if you're going to have,<br />
as I put it Paul, a sound financial platform from which<br />
to undertake new and necessary expenditure, that's the<br />
way it should be looked at.<br />
LYNEHAN: What do you think of the idea of some form of<br />
trust fund for this money, to make sure it is committed<br />
in that way?<br />
PM: I'm quite prepared to discuss this issue, but I<br />
think that the Party, we've learnt to understand one<br />
another. We have our debates, I think, robustly, but<br />
directly and in a way where people can trust one another.<br />
I mean if the commitments were given that these proceeds<br />
would be used in this way, I think people would<br />
understand and accept that. But it may be that that<br />
concept is, you know, a way of doing it.<br />
LYNEHAM: It is current at the moment<br />
PM: It's been talked about, yes.<br />
LYNEHAN: The Budget extends the network of computer<br />
matching, with tax file numbers linked to more clients of<br />
Social Security, Veterans Affairs, students and so<br />
on. As you guard against fraud, don't you run the risk<br />
of creating another sort of problem that smacks a bit of<br />
big brother?<br />
PM: I don't think so Paul. Let me make this point, or a<br />
number of points which are relevant to a very appropriate<br />
question. Firstly we have had and will continue to have<br />
discussions with the Privacy Commissioner about this<br />
because we understand that in meeting the objective of<br />
matching the revenue and outlays information in regard to<br />
clients of the paying agencies, that we must also ensure<br />
that we respect privacy. So there has been continuing<br />
discussions and there will continue to be discussion with<br />
the Privacy Commissioner. The second point to make is<br />
this, that what we're doing here is doing in a new<br />
technological form what has been done manually to this </p>
<p>point. I mean there is this manual checking that goes on<br />
and this is taking advantage of the most recent<br />
technology for the benefit of the Australian people so<br />
that they won't be paying<br />
LYNEHAM: But the Commissioner recently was fairly<br />
underwhelmed with the performance of some Government<br />
departments in their internal security of this sort of<br />
information. What<br />
PM: Well I mean we've always got to be on our guard and<br />
we will always listen to what the Privacy Commissioner<br />
has got to say. We will develop this technique which is<br />
there to protect the Australian public from fraud. We<br />
will ensure at all times that we have the involvement of<br />
the Privacy Commissioner. Let me say this, that there<br />
will be no centralised data bank created out of this<br />
process. LYNEHAM: What's wrong with pensioners keeping their<br />
money in low interest accounts or indeed doing anything<br />
else they like with it?<br />
PM: Well there are these things which are silly about<br />
it. Firstly it means that they are, those who need less<br />
to do it, are most subsidising the banks. It is crazy<br />
that the banks take the money and they're entitled to<br />
it, I mean I'm not saying they're acting illegally, but<br />
they take the money, millions and millions of dollars<br />
from the elderly to put it in their three or four per<br />
cent and then the banks say thank you very very much then<br />
lend it out at 18%. That's good for the banks but it's<br />
not very good for the people concerned.<br />
LYNEHAM: But even if you keep your money under the<br />
mattress now it's now deemed to have earned 10% interest.<br />
PM: In regard to the first $ 2000 there's a cut-off there<br />
because we recognise that people will want to have some<br />
ready availability for what they see is immediate needs.<br />
But over and above that there will deeming. But let me<br />
make this point. We understand that this may be<br />
confusing and worrying for our elderly citizens so we're<br />
going to put more money into the Social Security area to<br />
provide financial counselling for old people. I think we<br />
have that obligation.<br />
LYNEHAM: How will you know who's got money under the<br />
mattress though?<br />
PM: Well we're going to give people an opportunity,<br />
there's going to be this amnesty period where people can,<br />
I mean if they haven't been, you know, if they've been<br />
getting a benefit when they shouldn't have been, the<br />
amnesty will enable them to come clean so that there's a<br />
clean start. That will encourage people I think. They<br />
will understand, because there is look, I haven't spent<br />
seven and a half years as Prime Minister doing more for </p>
<p>pensioners than has ever been done before, for the first<br />
time to get the pension as a proportion of average weekly<br />
earnings over 25% to take pensions, as they totally will<br />
be by 1995, out of the tax system. I haven't done all<br />
these things to start hurting pensioners now.<br />
LYNEHAM: The Middle East. Are you disappointed that the<br />
five permanent members of the Security Council are still<br />
not able to agree on any UN endorsement of the<br />
multinational blockade force?<br />
PM: There's a hiatus in the process, as I understand it,<br />
when they were considering it that it was related<br />
particularly to the possible berthing of an Iraq ship in<br />
Yemen and Yemen gave an undertaking that they wouldn't<br />
accept the ship. So there was an adjournment of the<br />
proceedings. We've recently, in the last 24 hours or so,<br />
had the meeting of the Western European Union countries<br />
who have stiffened up their resolve in this area. I<br />
think wherever you look around the world now, I mean<br />
interestingly, including Libya, you've seen Gadaffi<br />
standing off now from Iraq in a way that he hasn't done<br />
before. I mean any rational assessment by Suddam Hussein<br />
and those around him must lead to the conclusion<br />
increasingly Paul that the best interests of their people<br />
are served now by withdrawing from Kuwait.<br />
LYNEHAM: The detailed rules of engagement of our<br />
vessels, once they are worked out, they'll be kept<br />
secret? PM: Yes of course. What will be done is that they in<br />
fact are conveyed now, as they are to our naval forces<br />
that are going there, they'll operate under those on the<br />
way. And if there are changes as a result of any further<br />
discussions they'll be conveyed to them. But of course<br />
they are not made public.<br />
0 LYNEHAM: But if there's any major change in the role of<br />
the vessels will the public be told?<br />
PM: Obviously, I've made it clear that if there's any<br />
change in the role I've given these undertakings. That I<br />
would consult within the Party, I would consult with the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, and there would be a decision<br />
by Cabinet. Now even if I wanted to keep those things<br />
secret, I mean I think I'd find it fairly difficult<br />
But of course I would want to make it publicly known if<br />
there were any change in those circumstances.<br />
LYNEHAM: Exercise Swift Eagle in North Queensland,<br />
they're practising a rescue of Australian hostages. I<br />
assume the timing of that is entirely co-incidental?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: Would you ever contemplate trying to do it for<br />
real? </p>
<p>PM: I think it would be totally unrealistic to imagine<br />
that Australia in the circumstances in question could do<br />
that. LYNEHAM: Is there any other option in this regard to the<br />
Australian hostages but to concede that we are<br />
regrettably, virtually powerless in this situation and<br />
that we've just got to try and wait for a resolution of<br />
the crisis?<br />
PM: Not just wait for a resolution, we've got to try and<br />
work for a resolution of the crisis. But in the terms of<br />
direct rescue, in fact you put it correctly, that the<br />
right thing that we've got to do, and this is why I have<br />
sent Gareth Evans of f today he's going to Europe, he'll<br />
be going to Cairo, he'll be going to New York and<br />
Washington. Australia as is usual in these sorts of<br />
circumstances will be right there in the forefront,<br />
working hard to try and get a peaceful and diplomatic<br />
resolution of this tragic situation.<br />
LYNEHAM: Does he have a specific brief, any detailed<br />
plans? PM: Well my instructions to him were to see as many<br />
people as he could of significance and to exercise<br />
whatever influence he could to strengthen the resolve of<br />
people to try if possible to get aid and even full United<br />
Nations cover and to make it clear, as I've said, that<br />
Australia is not an enemy of the Iraqi people and that<br />
Australia would be at the forefront if the Iraqi<br />
leadership withdraws. We would be at the forefront of<br />
trying to restore a situation of normal and constructive<br />
relations. LYNEHAM: There have been reports that Australian<br />
resident Edith Puckeridge of Adelaide has been rounded up<br />
by the Iraqis in Baghdad. Have you any more information<br />
on that?<br />
PM: All I know is that the woman in question Mrs<br />
Puckeridge to whom you refer, who travels on a British<br />
passport but is a long term Australian resident, and<br />
therefore we accept a certain responsibility, is one<br />
included amongst a number of foreigners who have been<br />
take from their hotel. We're not sure where they've been<br />
taken. LYNEHAM: Let me just repeat a question I asked when we<br />
last spoke. If Saddam Hussein starts to harm the<br />
Australian hostages, would that give you any second<br />
thoughts about our ships?<br />
PM: No. It can't do. That's a hard answer but it's a<br />
direct answer. The principles that are involved here are<br />
fundamental if the world is going to be able to live in a<br />
civilised relationship, nation with nation and people </p>
<p>4 6<br />
with people. No one regrets more profoundly than I do<br />
that Saddam Hussein has resorted to these terroristic,<br />
uncivilised codes of behaviour. I deeply hope that, if<br />
not Suddam Hussein, that those around him will come to<br />
understand that their interests of their people are being<br />
ill served, that the Iraqi people in one way or another<br />
can only suffer grievously from a continuation of the<br />
occupation of Kuwait. I still being I suppose Paul by<br />
nature an optimist hope and tend to believe that sense<br />
will prevail. I hope it does.<br />
LYNEHAM: You've been portrayed in this crisis by some as<br />
President Bush's lap dog. Analogies have been drawn with<br />
Vietnam and all the way with LBJ.<br />
PM: Let me make some points about that. I'm glad you<br />
asked the question. It is an absurdity, it's an insult<br />
which I reject completely, I repudiate it. Let me make<br />
these points. My consideration of this issue started<br />
well before the conversation with President Bush. There<br />
had been discussions at the diplomatic level and at the<br />
armed forces level. The discussion with George Bush was<br />
not the initiation. It was the end of a process. I<br />
could have announced it twenty four hours before perhaps.<br />
But it seemed to me appropriate that I should have that<br />
discussion. So I reject completely the absurdity of that<br />
observation. I know you're not making it but you are<br />
right some have made it. It is a nonsense with no<br />
foundation. Could I just make one other point Paul<br />
because your question was a very important one but you<br />
went back to an earlier age, you talked about Vietnam.<br />
Let me make this point and I hope that your viewers will<br />
understand the significance of this point. You can't<br />
look at this crisis through the spectacles of the sixties<br />
or seventies because in that period the possession of a<br />
long range missile capacity to deliver weapons of mass<br />
destruction were the exclusive preserve of the super<br />
powers. But now a nation like Iraq with a population of<br />
about the same as Australia and with a GDP significantly<br />
less than Australia has such weapons.<br />
LYNEHAM: So it's a different ball game?<br />
PM: It's a different ball game entirely.<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Its been my pleasure Paul, thank you.<br />
ends </p>
