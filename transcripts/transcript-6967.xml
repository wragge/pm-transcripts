PRIME MINISTER<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH BERT NEWTON 3DB 30 JUNE 1986<br />
N Of course the big political news over the weekend is that Don Chipp is<br />
retiring from politics, I had him on this morning and he spoke very glowingly.<br />
df you as he always has done. How do you think history will remember him?<br />
He t think they will remember him well for a number of reasons. Firstly<br />
it'to a very remarkable achielffnt to have resigned fromn a party andS<br />
established another one which a relatively short time assumed the<br />
balance of power. It's been accurate in a sense for Don to say as he<br />
said recently that he's got the second most powerful' position to the<br />
Prime Minister because when you hold the balance of power from the<br />
Senate that means that whether the legislation of the Govt. of the day<br />
pauses or not was very much in his hands, the hands of his party, and he<br />
* as his party, to all intents and purposes. That's a very big achievement.<br />
The second thing is I think that he exercised that power fairly<br />
responsibly. There are times I'd like to give him a kick up his backside<br />
but basically he exercised it responsibly, so that's a very large<br />
achievement. And as a person, I've been talking about him as a politioian,<br />
but as a person I always found him an honest, intelligent bloke to deal with.<br />
N Since last speaking to you lots of things have happened federally and<br />
also at political levels generally in Australia. How much harder do you<br />
find it now Bob to run the country in comparison now to say two years ago.<br />
H. Well it's a good question, and paradoxically it is in some senses easier<br />
and some senses harder. Let me say why it's easier. Obviously if you're<br />
a reasonably intelligent bloke and I'm immodest enough to think I'm that.<br />
Once you've been doing something for a period of time you get to know I<br />
believe how to do it better. You get to know the people around you better<br />
the strengths and weaknesses of your Ministers, you know the strengths<br />
and weaknesses of your public service of people people in the bubiness<br />
community and the trade union movement. So in that sense it's easier now<br />
" than it was. But It's harder in this sense that while we've turned the<br />
Aust. economy around and got it growing very strongly and got the high<br />
levels of unemployment down that we inherited and got record employment<br />
growth,: Voknow in a situation where because of the dramatic decline<br />
. n prices that we goet paid for so much or what we export that we've had </p>
<p>our National Income cut by that's created a new set of difficulties<br />
-that weve not had so dramatically before. so that requires tough decisions<br />
Bert, but we'll take them because they're necessary.<br />
N. The relationship between yourself and Mr Keating?<br />
U. I an honestly say that it has never been better, we had a little period<br />
air -a very short period where it could be said perhaps there were a<br />
few points of differences. There were, but our friendship is strong enough<br />
Ã¸" and deep enough to enable us to sit down together as we did, talk through<br />
thome things and I think Paul would say as I personally do that our<br />
relationship has not been better. than it is now and it's been very strong<br />
in the past.<br />
N. But it's simply a case though, you were overseas and he decided to look<br />
like the commander df the ship?<br />
H. no when I was in Japan and China it looked as though there might be<br />
some sort of meeting between groups that could have offered the opportunity<br />
for doing certain things and through basically no fault of Paul's but rather<br />
I think some hyping up by the media that began to be given a stature<br />
which it never had the legs to carry and you know I had to deal with that<br />
but that wasn't really dealing with Paul it was dealing with an issue.<br />
med i a<br />
N. One story that has been given enormous coverage for the last couple of<br />
weeks is the impending hanging 6f" Chambers and Barlow. will nothing make<br />
the Govt intervene?<br />
H. Well the Govt. has maqe very strong representations, the Foreign Min.<br />
Mr Bill Hayden has done that consistently, let me make it clear, we<br />
as a Govt. certainly I as an individual are appalled at the trade in drugs<br />
but we are equally as a matter of conscience against capital punishment.<br />
So what we've had to say has had nothing to do with the facts of the case<br />
but with the question of capital punishment. I still hope that the-'<br />
sentences can be commuted to life imprisonment. But there is nothing<br />
more as a Govt. we can do, Bert.<br />
N. What w6uld happen do you believe, if Malcolm Fraser, regardless of what<br />
he said iA recent times, came back into politics and led the Liberals!.<br />
H. Well the Liberal Party would be even more in tatters and interani dissent<br />
-Z 4 Z 3S? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
H. and division if he came back. I mean they are quite hopeless at the<br />
moment. The divisions there and the bitterness between people is<br />
unbelifvable, if Malcolm were to come back that would add another<br />
ingredient to it. But T thInk to be fait to Malcolm he has no intention<br />
Of doing it.<br />
N. One final: question, Federal Cabinet looking at sanctions against South<br />
B. Yes we've got that on the agenda today. We'll examine the issue but<br />
whether we'll actually bring anything into effect before I go to London<br />
in a few weeks time, we're there* themeeting is I think from 3rd to the<br />
of August. 1 think what we'll be wanting to do is position ourselves<br />
so that we'll be able to identify immediately with what will be the mood<br />
of the Commonwealth, and I want to be in a pohition where I have the<br />
authority of Cabinet decisions on this.<br />
N. Nice to talk to you Mr Prime Minister and I hope we can get together<br />
on a number of occasions as I plough through.<br />
B. I'd like to talk to you whenever that's your<br />
