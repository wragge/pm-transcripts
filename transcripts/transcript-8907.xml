PRIME MINISTER<br />
TPANSCRIPT OF PRIE MINISTERS WNERVIOEW AT FOSTER'SHUAGUANG<br />
FOUNDATION STONE-LAYING CEREMONY, SHANGHAI<br />
26 JUNE 1993<br />
J: Prime minister, how important is it that this<br />
project is a symbol of Australia's intentions<br />
towards business in China?<br />
PM: Well, I think it is very important because its a<br />
major project by major company, with a major<br />
company, and it's important because it's also about<br />
high technology. Beer is basically technology and<br />
we are amongst the technological leaders in the<br />
world and therefore seeing these two companies doing<br />
something in joint venture is a tangible a<br />
tangible benefit for the relationship between China<br />
and Australia.<br />
And this is the kind of thing that Vice Mayor Zhao<br />
has said to me ina the last twenty four hours about<br />
China and Australia doing things together.<br />
J: Is it also important to get-a recognised cultural<br />
symbol of Australia in China?*<br />
PH: Well I think that helps and beer is a bulk commodity<br />
for people and it'll always have the Australian ring<br />
to it, with Fosters, so we-re developing the<br />
whole world is about brand names these days so<br />
we're not only developing a brand name further but<br />
we're doing it in a part of the world that wants us<br />
here.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the g-rowth rate here around twenty<br />
six percent, that really sounds like gangbusters.<br />
Do you think it can keep going or will it have to<br />
slow down sooner rather than later?<br />
PZ!: I think the government wants to slow it down but as<br />
the Vice Mayor has told me in Pudong, this area of<br />
Shanghai, its developing under a national proposal<br />
so its not going to slow down. </p>
<p>2<br />
So Shanghai is probably Australia's gatevay to<br />
China, or one of them, and that's why I'm so<br />
delighted to be here with the Vice Mayor in seeing<br />
this project begin.<br />
J: Mr Keating, as you leave China what are the major<br />
things you feel you've learnt, in the few days<br />
you've been here, about the place?<br />
PM: Well I think its again the further development of<br />
the relationship. Its been, I think, a good couple<br />
of days well spent in meeting the Premier and the<br />
Vice Premier, Li Pang and Zhu Rongji. And I think in<br />
a tangible way apart from better understanding where<br />
we're going, talking about the Pacific, talking<br />
about APEC, but also talking about particular<br />
business opportunities for Australia in major<br />
expansions of steel with iron ore, of wool. If we<br />
can bring that off.<br />
These things are I think great trading and<br />
commercial opportunities for Australia which can<br />
only been done basically by visits, by building the<br />
personal relationships.<br />
J: Do you think Beijing is coloured by the hope of<br />
Olympics by 2000?<br />
PM: Well, that's not in our hands.<br />
ends. </p>
