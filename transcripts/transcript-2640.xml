Mr. Chairman Ihave bezeri ass) ciate-' with Cove evor siflco the beginning.<br />
In those d-ays it w-. as F, wast In those av wo couldn't hav3<br />

Your corperatinn is now th--third! largast -or at least<br />
Gove is now tho thir,. 2-largor , t community in the Territory, and<br />
judgecd by what we yev: , o far szcn, it a fnr cry from whiat I<br />
call " roughing it" s in thi:-r. ays whc--n-I first camne up hero. And,<br />
too, this is cnL, of the la-rgt:-. st sinale-stage -,. roje,-cts undertaken<br />
by private: enterprise in Australia, an(! by far the largest in thc<br />
Nort-Ae , n Territorv.<br />
The Territory itself, as you know, is tho fastest growing<br />
area in Lustralia with a nonulotion avcra-ing inlgot about<br />
9 per cent ner annum. This' coulld have -occurred unless<br />
.2c. loomrits like vc had made such1--'--henomenal growth possible.<br />
that is not all, b:-cauoe t-hisl projcti.-uttndn<br />
example of planneld dvlme'ofa rcmotc area, and it is boing<br />
developed on th Arnhcm Land PAboriginal Reserve.<br />
This unusual alnd novcl location ha5 and will continue to<br />
raise problems. But our nroblems must bje understood and policies<br />
de'veloped against t h1ihi S t oricanl fact that over th. e yr-ars large<br />
areas of t-he Northern Territcry larcrar than the United-Kingdom<br />
or, if you %, ant an Australian c. omoarison, larger than Vi1ctoria, have<br />
ber sct aside as ri-serv-cs for thc uso and benofit of the 22,000<br />
aborigincs who live he,: re.<br />
Some; 110 12ees's of threa% and a half million acres have been<br />
rovod on these rc~ szrv-. The great mjority of them have beon<br />
aipprovold for aboriginal commnuniti. es. I. re:-cent times, we -avco<br />
a'nproved threa pastoral le-aseri totalling about 5,500 square miles<br />
to ab-original grounc. </p>
<p>It is now part of the history of Gove that the aborigines<br />
on the Peninsula claimed hereditary rights to the land. The<br />
Territory's Supreme Court ruled that Yirrkala aborigines have no<br />
legal basis for their claim.<br />
This decision led to a wide-ranging policy review. I think<br />
I have been associated in a very deep way with that Committee And<br />
we had that review in order to find out exactly what we could do<br />
in order to ensure that not only do the aborigines have their<br />
reserves of which they have permanent occupation, but as well, we<br />
wanted to give them a tenure, which they would be able to use and<br />
use for their advantages.<br />
I was able to announce on Australia Day, the 26th of<br />
January, exactly what we would do. A central feature of the<br />
statement I then made was the proposal for a new form of general<br />
purpose leaseholding. I wellremember at the Cabinet discussions<br />
then and there deciding to call it a multi-purpose lease, because<br />
not only was it going to be used for a variety of purposes that<br />
were associated with mining or commercial purposes or anything else<br />
that might be involved in it. But we had these multi-purpose leases<br />
and we would grant them within aboriginal reserves, and those multipurpose<br />
leases would, in fact, be renewed.<br />
May I clear up something here, because if there is one<br />
difficulty I have felt over the time I have been associated with<br />
this, it is that either people didn't want to know, or if they<br />
knew, they didn't want to do anything about it.<br />
But what I want to emphasise to you is that the reserves<br />
themselves are of permanent duration, and they are for the<br />
aborigines themselves. Within that we have the general purpcse<br />
or the multi-purpose leases within those reserves, and of course<br />
they can be granted by the Loan Board on which there are two<br />
aboriginal representatives, and they can be renewed if the<br />
aborigine people themselves make the application and the Board<br />
itself decides they should be renewed.<br />
For these reasons, I fail to understand( again as one who<br />
is profoundly committed to the ideal of giving the aborigine all<br />
the opportunity all the opportunities that a country can give)<br />
I cannot understand the constant cricicism we still have about what<br />
the reserves mean, and what within those reserves the multipurpose<br />
leases mean as well.<br />
Now, at the same time as I mention these multi-purpose or<br />
general purpose leases, I think probably my friend, Ralph Hunt would<br />
prefer me to at the same time we decided on a policy<br />
relating to mining on the aboriginal reserves.<br />
We considered whether prospecting and development on<br />
reserves should be prohibited for the present. We concluded it<br />
was in the national interest as well as in the interests of the<br />
aborigines themselves that mineral exploration and development<br />
should continue. But within this context, we are consulting with<br />
those aboriginal communities which might be affected, so that<br />
their welfare can be fully taken into account before mining<br />
applications are approved. / 3 </p>
<p>6 </p>
<p>In the case of exploration applications, we have consulted<br />
with aborigines having bona fide tranditional interests in the<br />
areasinvolved. The aim of these consultations has been to inform<br />
them of the type of work to be undertaken and to identify any<br />
sitescf special significance which must not be disturbed.<br />
As well, if aboriginal communities are interested in<br />
exploration rights, their applications may be granted preference,<br />
subject only to their a1. ility to carry out an exploration<br />
programme and not necessarily with sophisticated techniques.<br />
In the case of most applications by non-aborigines, we<br />
expect exploration right'-s will be granted, and that satisfactory<br />
development conditions to protect the interests of aborigines can<br />
be negotiated. Where this cannot be done, or the Aidministrator<br />
believes development would be prejudicial to the aboriginal community;<br />
development rights may have to be deferred, for the time being.<br />
These guidelines for development are aimed at securing<br />
the maximum involvement for aborigines in projects, and a real<br />
participation by them in their benefits.<br />
There is one other aspect of prospecting for minerals that<br />
I thinkl should mention. It is import ant to know what mineralisation<br />
occurs on these reserves. And the only way td find out is to have<br />
a reasonable policy of exploration and development. We have done<br />
this without sacrificing in any way the interests of our own people,<br />
our own aborigines.<br />
At Gove, royalties from the bauxite and alumina will. be<br />
about $ 550,000 initially. Within a few years, they are likely to<br />
exceed $ 1 million per annum. * This money will be paid into the<br />
aborigines benefits trust fund for all aborigines in the Territory.<br />
In our review arising from the land rights decision, the<br />
Government decided that 10 per cent of the royalties from Gove<br />
should go to the Yirrkala community because of the special impact<br />
of this project on them.<br />
When we announced that decision on Australia Day, no date<br />
was specified. I a= now glad to announce that we approved<br />
arrangements only last week for this 10 per cent payment to apply<br />
retrospectively from the time of the first royalty on Gove bauxite,<br />
that is, 31 March 1970. This means the first pra yment to the<br />
Yirrkala community, which is now due and has been approved, will be<br />
$ 21,488. This money w'ill be Paid into a special fund administered<br />
by the local Aboriginal Council whose representatives of the<br />
Yirrkala community are at this function today.<br />
I have had the pleasure of talking to some of you<br />
previously about a number of your problems and I was glad of the<br />
opportunity to visit you yesterday. I realised then, more than I<br />
have done before how the people of two separate and distinct<br />
cultural backgrounds are living close together here.<br />
One group, the aboriginal people, is in a less favourable<br />
position to cope with the problems presented by a new community<br />
nearby. This is not only a problem for government or the<br />
management of Nabalco. f </p>
<p>a Sb<br />
I A<br />
I </p>
<p>It is a problem which concerns averone who lives here. It is a<br />
problem that concerns the Northern Territory Administration, and my<br />
colleague Ral'ph Hunt. It is a oroblem that concerns me and my<br />
Government. In such situations a balance of interest naturally has to<br />
be struck. I think that whenever questions of competing interest<br />
arise, weinve to find a fair balance betwieen the interests of the<br />
aborigines and the general community.<br />
To put it very simply, those who come here to develop the<br />
natural resources should be ' prepared and ever ready to understand<br />
the views of the aboriginal People and to make concessions to their<br />
views. Unless this is donu, the-result could be a social environment<br />
unacceptable to any of the residents.<br />
It is therefore most important that the European community,<br />
the main workforce on the ground at Gove, develops good and happy<br />
relations with the aborigines.<br />
The development of Nhulunbuy is of particular interest to<br />
me and my Government. It is one of the few examples where the<br />
Commonwealth has participated directly with private enterpris~ e at<br />
the initial development stage.<br />
Nhulunbuy was built at a cost of $ 45 million of which the<br />
Commonwealth is contributing nearly one-third. Private enter~ prise<br />
has taken the balance and has shouldered the major burden of infrastructure<br />
in this multi-million dollar project. Theirs bas been a<br />
splendid contributiJon here for the benefit of the aborigines and<br />
Nabalco alike.<br />
Surely, and for me particularly as Prime ? finister, it is<br />
worthy of special recognition that the Gove partnership has taken<br />
big commercial and social risks and has been able to achieve our<br />
goals in their own interests, and those of the nation, and they<br />
have beaten all their target dates.<br />
An objective of our policy in the negotiations with the<br />
Cove Companies to which I would like to especially refer and I<br />
want to do so again for background of contemporary social thought<br />
and trends was our desire to minimise ecological changes in the<br />
environment and to avoid the effects of Pollution.<br />
Stringent conditions were imposed relating to reclamation<br />
and regeneration. We will want to know that the companies affected<br />
accepted these obligations more than five years ago, and they have<br />
lived up to every single one of them.<br />
This in itself provides the perfect answer to those who<br />
claim for their own reasons that the Government and the mining<br />
industry have given little thought in the past to environmental<br />
matters. From their past performance, we know that the companies<br />
have a genuine wish to co-onerate with the Government in every way,<br />
not least in the fields of aboriginal advancement and environmental<br />
protection. </p>
<p>It is worth recording and I can nrobably record this in a<br />
stronger way than most n c. ope th--at the Cove Aqr. gornent was<br />
negotiated long before my sttatemon-t of January aboriginaJ.<br />
policies. Indeed, I can emnhisise, that this agreement in some ways<br />
led to that statement.<br />
We in tha Governmnt look forrward with confience to<br />
continuad co-operation with the partnershi7 in this and in other<br />
fields. Having said all this, may I now ask you every one of<br />
you to please charge your glasses and (: riflk with me a toast<br />
to the joint venturers for their cntri&gt;. ution to the development<br />
of our Nrth and to th1 devlonzont of our own country. </p>
