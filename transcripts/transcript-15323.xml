<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>Good taxation policy is fundamental to good economic policy.</p>
<p>This government has cut income taxes in the last five Budgets, delivering almost $70 billion in cuts in the last two years alone.</p>
<p>The most recent tax cut will deliver an extra $21 a week to those earning $30,000 a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Labor says it does not intend to release a tax policy.</p>
<p>Labor tries to pretend it will simply continue the government's good work, and that people should trust them to run the economy.</p>
<p>Labor's record dispels this myth. </p>
<p>It left $96 billion in debt, and voted against all major measures to pay it off.  Our economic management has restored prosperity and reduced unemployment to its lowest level in more than three decades.</p>
<p>If a government changes, economic policy also changes.</p>
<p>And in Australia's case in 2007 that would definitely be a change for the worse.  </p>
