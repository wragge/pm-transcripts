    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will provide over $12.6 million to assist rugby league celebrate its centenary in Australia.</p>
<p>Rugby league has made a significant contribution to Australia's national identity.  While the sport has a working class background, of which it can be justifiably proud, it now reaches out to the entire community.  It invokes fierce loyalties, especially around the time of the State of Origin games, but also brings the nation together when Australia plays in a Test match.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will contribute $10 million towards the establishment of a Rugby League Hall of Fame.  The Hall of Fame will be a permanent home for Australian rugby league's historic memorabilia, showcase rugby league's best achievements and provide visitors with a unique interactive experience.</p>
<p>2008 will be a time of great celebration for Australian rugby league.  The Australian Government will provide $2.63 million to support the staging of the 2008 Rugby League World Cup and the other events being held to celebrate the centenary.  These events include the naming of rugby league's 100 greatest players, a fan day at Telstra Stadium and the Centenary Test between Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>I congratulate all of the players, coaches, officials, administrators and volunteers who have made rugby league such a great game and brought entertainment and a love of the game to so many Australians.  </p>
