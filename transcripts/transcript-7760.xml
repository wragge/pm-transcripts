JOURNALIST: xr Hawks, have you in fact eliminated child<br />
poverty in the term in which you said you would in the 1987<br />
promise? PN: As I said, Bishop Hollinguworth and others recognise<br />
that because they are not playing games like the Opposition.<br />
We said we would do what was within our power. That is to<br />
eliminate the financial need for child poverty. No<br />
government can determine what happens in an individual<br />
family as to whether a child runs away from home. But we<br />
said, in consultation with the welfare industry, that we<br />
would set targets of welfare payments which would be<br />
percentages of pensions. Nov that was agreed with the<br />
welfare industry that if we met those percentages, those<br />
targets, that would seet the promise of eliminating the<br />
financial need for poverty. We not those targets six months<br />
ahead of schedule.<br />
JOURNALIST: I think from meiory though you said that by 1990<br />
no child would be living in poverty.<br />
PN: Well see you obviously want to play the Opposition game.<br />
1' m saying that when you read the full. statemnt, as it was<br />
there with the election policy speech, it said that we would<br />
provide a situation where there would be no financial need<br />
for poverty. Do you believe that any govena or do you<br />
want a society which the government is qoinq to go into every<br />
homo to determine whether the domestic dispute and the kid<br />
leaves home and goes out in the street? Obviously no<br />
government anywhere in the world can create a situation where<br />
it determines what happens in each domestic household. What<br />
you can do and what we made the promise to do, was to create<br />
a massive increase in financial outlays to families, the low<br />
income families, which has now gone to more than half a<br />
million low income families in this country, there is the<br />
money. There is no financial need for a child to live in<br />
poverty. That promise is delivered, that promise is what we<br />
said we'd do and it has been acknowledged by the welfare </p>

JOURMLIST: The pilots did turn up at the Commission this<br />
morning. Is that a hopeful sign?<br />
PM: Well 10a glad they did. I respect what the President of<br />
the Commission said. He didn't want any coint about what'.<br />
happen inq in there and I hope that those who ve said that<br />
they were outside the system, that the system wasn't for them<br />
and the guidelines wasn't for themi, I hope they realise that<br />
they need to operate within the system. But I've got no<br />
commoents, on what<br />
JODRNALIBT: We've had som later information on that. The<br />
Industrial Relations Commission has adjourned this morning,<br />
the AFAP has refused to submit to arbitration.<br />
PH: Then all I am say is that you have a clear situation of<br />
a continuing determination by this sml 1 group of people to<br />
put thineSlVes beyond the system. The airlines and the<br />
W Government and increasingly the community will act in a way<br />
which in necessary; that is that the airline operations will<br />
be restored without those people.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it doregister the Federation?<br />
PH: Oh well that'. a imatter that can be handled through the<br />
processes of the Commission if people want to initiate that.<br />
But that's not you know the intrinsically important part of<br />
what's necessary to deal with this situation. That is mixply<br />
that the airlines must and will recruit people on the basis<br />
of individual cotrct and then the airline system will be<br />
restored because it in quite clear that the Government and<br />
the community is not going to tolerate a situation where a<br />
simall group of people can say they are above and beyond<br />
everyone else and can destroy the economy. That's not going<br />
to happen. The airline systes will be restored.<br />
