24 January 1997 ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO AUSTRALIA DAY COUNCIL'S AUSTRALIA DAY LUNCHEON<br />
DARLING HARBOUR, SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Mr and Mrs Unsworth, Your Excellency, Bob Carr the Premier of New South Wales and Mrs<br />
Carr, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Judith Flemming, other very distinguished guests, Ministerial<br />
and Parliamentary colleagues, Archbishop of Sydney and Cardinal Clancy and other<br />
representatives of the churches and other community organisations, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It's a great pleasure for me to be here today as Prime Minister to share some thoughts with<br />
you in honour of the country we all love so deeply. There are many things that can be said<br />
about politicians in all countries and one of the things that can be said about politicians<br />
wherever they come from is that they are often remembered for particular phrases that they<br />
have uttered. Some of those phrases have been carefully crafted and deliberately delivered,<br />
other phrases have been rather spontaneously generated on the spur of the moment but have<br />
lived with them forever.<br />
I think of that very evocative phrase that one of my very distinguished and well loved<br />
predecessors Ben Chifley when he spoke of the ' light on the hill'. We remembered George<br />
Bush's reference to ' read my lips'. We remember Malcolm Fraser' s immortal phrase that ' life<br />
was not meant to be easy'. I see Neville Wran is here today, I remember his remark ' are you<br />
from the ABC?'. Other phrases, of course, have been rather more deliberately cast. I'm quite<br />
certain a lot of thought was given to John Kennedy's inaugural address and to the very<br />
prophetic warning that the former British Prime Minister, Harold McMillan, delivered to the<br />
South African parliament in 1960 when it was an all white parliament and he spoke of the<br />
winds of change that were blowing with a gale force through Africa. It has been my loss, for<br />
good or ill, in the context of politicians and their phrases to be left with a phrase that I uttered<br />
when I was also being interviewed by the ABC about 12 months ago. I uttered the phrase<br />
' relaxed and comfortable'. And I have to say that I hadn't given an enormous amount of<br />
thought over the previous couple of weeks to the use of that phrase, but I do want today to<br />
share a few words with you in explanation of that phrase and to put it in the context of what I<br />
feel about our country.<br />
I didn't utter that phrase out of some kind of smug self satisfaction, but everything that you<br />
could possibly want about a country and everything that you could possibly wish for was there<br />
in order and everything was perfect about Australia. No society which has a proper </p>
<p>understanding of its history or its presence or an apprehension and belief about its future can<br />
deny certain blemishes and great historical wrongs and Australia, of course, is no exception.<br />
But I used that phrase because of a deeply held belief I have about Australian nationalism and<br />
Australian patriotism and that is that we should not find ourselves engaged in a frantic and<br />
constant search for a new or a different identity. We should not allow ourselves to lapse into a<br />
perceptional seminar about our identity. There is a very identifiable Australian character and<br />
Australian identity. It's very different from what it was 40 or 50 years ago although there are<br />
some common threads that bind the Australian identity of today with the Australian identity of<br />
or 50 years ago.<br />
When we examine our national identity we should always remember that the symbols that we<br />
hold very dear as Australians and the beliefs that we have about what it is to be an Australian<br />
are not things that can ever be imposed from above by political leaders of any persuasion.<br />
They are not things that can be generated by self appointed, cultural elite who seek to tell us<br />
what our identity ought to be. Rather they are feelings and attitudes that grow out of the spirit<br />
of the people. I've long held the believe that those things that we hold dear as Australia, those<br />
myths if you like those legends about Australia, are those that essentially have come in two<br />
ways. They have come out of great traumatic events such as the events of the 25th of April<br />
1915 in the Dardenelles on the beaches of Gallipoli and there are those other things that<br />
through long usage and custom and a feeling that it suits the temperament of the Australian<br />
people we have come to love and to hold dear and I think of our tradition of informal mateship<br />
and egalitarianism. And I think it is very important when we thing of our identity we<br />
remember that essentially it grows out of the spirit of the people and it is never something that<br />
can be imposed.<br />
When I think about the Australian identity I think of many of the snapshots of my own<br />
experience as Prime Minister over the last nine months and the events that have moved me and<br />
have reminded me so forcibly of the tremendous spirit and versatility of the Australian people.<br />
All of us as a nation were moved greatly by the tragic events in Port Arthur in April of last<br />
year. The suffering of so many, the ability of the community to come together, the outpouring<br />
of national grief and a recognition that a great evil had been done and a determination to<br />
rebuild the lives of those who have been so totally shattered by those events.<br />
I remember with great warmth and experience of the Victorian township of Benalla when that<br />
community honoured its most famous son, Weary Dunlop, the great Australian hero of World<br />
War II. The spontaneous patriotism of the young school children who sang in praise of Weary<br />
and in praise of Australian. I think recently of our great firefighters in Victoria, I think of<br />
those wonderful airman and sailors we rescued those two yachtsmen in the ferals of the<br />
Antarctic water. I think about great sports men and women at the Atlanta Olympic Games<br />
and none, of course, is finer than Nova Peris-Kneebone who we honour today. She said so<br />
very simply and so eloquently but when she put on the green and gold she played for all of us,<br />
can I return the honour and the compliment to say that we felt Nova that you were playing for<br />
all of us and we honour what you represent and we honour the tremendous achievement for<br />
you and your people.<br />
Those snapshots ladies and gentlemen focus of course my own mind and we all have our<br />
different ways of expressing our love of country, but when I ask myself what do I love about<br />
Australia, there are many things that I love about Australia. I love Australia's tolerance and<br />
openness. I think Australia is one of the most tolerant and open societies in the world and I<br />
think the great thing that Australia can boast has been its capacity to absorb people from the<br />
four corners of the earth into a very harmonious society and over the days ahead thousands of </p>
<p>new people will take their oath or affirmations as Australian citizens and they will be grouping<br />
together with a common commitment to our nation but coming together from the four corners<br />
of the earth and the great capacity of Australia to absorb those people in such harmony and<br />
steadfast is I think is one of our great achievements.<br />
I admire the adaptability of the Australian people. One of the most intriguing and endearing<br />
things about the Australian people is our voracious passion and appetite for new technology,<br />
the way in which we have taken to the communications revolution, the technological advances<br />
of the late 20th Century is a tribute to our great adaptability.<br />
I love the surprises that you can always find about the Australian people. We are a sports<br />
loving nation and yesterday I had the immense privilege to launch the first in the Australian<br />
legends series of postage stamps which honoured the greatest living Australian Sir Donald<br />
Bradman who has straddled the generations and the hearts and minds of generations of<br />
Australians like no other person in the history of this nation has been able to do.<br />
Yet side by side with that the young now have a growing appetite, not just the young but<br />
Australians generally have a growing appetite for the arts and the fact that there are more<br />
people who visit museums and many other artistic centres at weekends than play sport is<br />
something that a generation ago would have been a great surprise to many Australians.<br />
I also love the scepticism and the irreverence of Australians. I spent my holidays again this<br />
year at a little haunt called Hawksnest that my family and I have been visiting for the last 17 or<br />
18 years. I walked along the beaches as I've done over the previous 16 or 17 years, and I<br />
received plenty of advice, free advice as I walked along the beach. And it reminded me of a<br />
conversation that I'd had with President Clinton when he visited Australia last and we were<br />
talking about the things that Australians and Americans had in common and we agreed that<br />
our social informality, our scorn for class structures and the lack of formality and rigidity of<br />
older societies is something that we had in common, and he said to me, " what do you think we<br />
don't have in common, what are some of our differences?", and I offered the view that I<br />
thought Australians were a little more sceptical perhaps than Americans were and a little more<br />
irreverent and this reminded me of my most sceptical and irreverent moment in the time that<br />
I've been in politics, perhaps one or two may have heard this story before but I'll take that<br />
risk. It was in 1983, it was just after March of 1983 and I was then a member of a former<br />
government, not a member of an incumbent government, and I'd just been defeated, and I'd<br />
been Treasurer in that Government and I didn't feel terribly popular at the time and I was<br />
invited down to Ballarat by one of my colleagues. And the tour of an iron factory was one of<br />
the events and I walked around and I tried to make conversation with the people and I got the<br />
impression that most of them hadn't really wanted me to be there and that virtually none of<br />
them had voted for my side of politics a few weeks earlier. And that message was made very<br />
clearly. And as I was walking out the door somebody came racing over and he said to me:<br />
" John, John, I've always wanted to meet you, I've always wanted to meet you, I think you<br />
were a great Treasurer". And my face started to light up and my day brightened a little. And<br />
he started to furiously shake my hand and he suddenly stopped and he looked at my hand and<br />
he said, " I know that hand, it's been in my pocket for my last five years!". I don't think you<br />
could have that exchange in any other country in the world, and I think it is one of the<br />
absolutely lovable and endearing things about living in this country and about being an<br />
Australian. </p>
<p>Can I say one or two rather more reverent and more serious things. Can I say not only but<br />
importantly because I am addressing you here in Sydney. I do want to take the opportunity of<br />
saying to this huge gathering particularly containing many representatives of the business<br />
community and the Sydney community generally, how very strongly committed the Federal<br />
Government is to making the Olympic Games of the Year 2000 here in Sydney an absolutely<br />
stunning success. I want to assure you that my Government will work as closely as possible<br />
with the Premier of New South Wales and the Lord Mayor of Sydney to make this a<br />
completely bipartisan Australian effort. An occasion when Australia can be showcased to the<br />
world in a way that we haven't been in the past. Not only does the Games of the Year 2000<br />
offer us a unique opportunity of demonstrating the treasure house of talent here in Australia,<br />
but also offers up very great economic opportunities and if we are sensible as a community as<br />
a city as a nation, then we can derive enormous economic as well as cultural and sporting and<br />
other benefits from the Olympic Games of the Year 2000.<br />
Can I also say, speaking as the Prime Minister of Australia, how important it is for the event to<br />
be seen as an honour not only just to Sydney but also for the entire nation. I look of course<br />
from time to time at the intercity and interstate rivalry for sporting events. I'm a great believer<br />
in competition cities and between states for the location of sporting events but at the end of<br />
the day what really matters to me is that the event or the occasion comes to Australia, and<br />
where it may be located in Australia is a necessity of lesser importance.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen can I thank the New South Wales committee for the Australia<br />
Celebration for inviting me to be here and to share a few of my thoughts with you. I've been<br />
to a number of these luncheons in the past and this is the first opportunity I've had as Prime<br />
Minister to address it. I think one of the completely uncontroversial and quite unanimous<br />
things that can be said about the celebration of Australia Day is the way in which it has<br />
gathered momentum and gathered pace as the years have gone by. When I was a child going<br />
to school in Sydney in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was anniversary day, it was celebrated<br />
in a fairly desultory fashion but as the years have gone by it is a reminder of the greater<br />
passion that all of us are gathering for our national identity and our sense of being as<br />
Australians, the day has gathered a great deal more lustre, and I want to congratulate the<br />
Australia Day Committee under Barry Unsworth here in New South Wales for the outstanding<br />
job that he's done in organising this luncheon and the contribution that it is making to help all<br />
of us celebrate the miracle of being Australians.<br />
Thank you. </p>
