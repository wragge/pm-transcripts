    <content><![CDATA[<p>2 SEPTEMBER 1991</p>
<p>The terms of all non-Commonwealth members of the Economic Planning Advisory Council have now expired arnd I today announce the membership of the new Council.</p>
<p>Consistent with the rotational arrangements provided in the EPAC Act, Premiers Greiner, Goss and Bannon have now been appointed for a two year term. They replace Premiers Kirner and Lawrence and Chief Minister Perron.</p>
<p>The EPAC Act requires that non-Government members be appointed following consultations with certain industry and community groups.</p>
<p>I am pleased that a number of members of the previous Council have been renominated by the relevant organisations and have agreed to accept reappointment, providing an invaluable element of continuity to the Council's work.</p>
<p>They are :</p>
<p>Messrs M Ferguson,</p>
<p>W Kelty,</p>
<p>G Campbell,</p>
<p>G Belchamber</p>
<p>and M Easson ( appointed after consultation with the ACTU);</p>
<p>Messrs W Bailey and J Clark ( business organisations);</p>
<p>Mr J Disney ( welfare organisations); and</p>
<p>Ms L Sylvan ( consumer organisations).</p>
<p>The new non-Government members are</p>
<p>Councillor G Frecker ( President, Australian Local Government Association);</p>
<p>Mr W Wilkinson ( President, Australian Council of Professions);</p>
<p>Mr J Allwright ( Immediate Past President, National Farmers Federation);</p>
<p>Mr R Bastian ( Chief Executive, Council of Small Business Orcganisations);</p>
<p>and Mr B Kean ( Managing Director, Boral Limited).</p>
<p>The non-government members have been appointed to four-year terms. The Commonwealth will be represented by myself, the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, and the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook.</p>
<p>I thank all retiring members for their valuable contribution to the work of EPAC.</p>
<p>The new members bring a range of experience and talent to EPAC and are to be congratulated for their willingness toÂ  serve the community in this way. I look forward to the next meeting of EPAC in Canberra on Friday.</p>
