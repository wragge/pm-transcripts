EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT ON INDONESIAN AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
VISIT, 7 MAY 1992<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
I take this opportunity to provide the House with<br />
information and observations arising from my visit to<br />
Indonesia and PNG between 21 to 26 April.<br />
I visited these two countries to emphasise the Government's<br />
determination to make Australia's place in the region more<br />
certain. Indonesia and PNG are close and important neighbours.<br />
Both have rapidly growing economies and hold great promise<br />
as destinations for Australian exports and investment. Both<br />
are vital to our regional security.<br />
To a very considerable extent it is on what we do now in<br />
these and other countries of the region that the future of<br />
Australia depends.<br />
In going to Indonesia it was my intention to demonstrate to<br />
the Indonesian Government and the Australian people that<br />
Indonesia is in the first rank of our priorities. It is in<br />
many ways the best test of our ability to do the things we<br />
must do in the wider region.<br />
Indonesia naturally commands our attention.<br />
It is the fourth most populous country in the world. It is<br />
a leading member of the Association of South-East Asian<br />
Nations ( ASEAN) and a key player in regional affairs.<br />
As our close northern neighbour, Indonesia has an important<br />
bearing on our security environment. </p>
<p>More than is commonly appreciated in Australia, we have<br />
benefited very directly from the achievements of President<br />
Soeharto's New Order Government over the past 25 years.<br />
Between 1966 and 1991, Indonesia's real GDP rose 450 per<br />
cent. Over the last few years Indonesia's economic growth has<br />
averaged around 7 per cent. It is expected to be around<br />
or 6 per cent until the end of the decade.<br />
Through a sound policy of encouraging foreign investment,<br />
bureaucratic reform, financial deregulation, support for<br />
manufacturing and lifting of trade barriers, Indonesia has<br />
emerged as a dynamic and competitive economic force.<br />
Political stability and economic advancement in Indonesia<br />
have not only led to dramatic improvements in the standard<br />
of living of the Indonesian people. They have also<br />
contributed to stability and prosperity in the wider South-<br />
East Asian region.<br />
Australia gains from all this commercially.<br />
In 1991, our two-way merchandise trade with Indonesia was<br />
worth $ 2.4 billion. Exports to Indonesia were worth $ 1.4<br />
billion making it our tenth largest overseas market.<br />
But just as importantly, our national security benefits from<br />
a benign environment in the region to our north where not so<br />
many years ago there was great uncertainty and volatility.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
In describing the stake Australia has involved in<br />
cooperative relations with Indonesia, I readily acknowledge<br />
that our relationship with that country has sometimes been<br />
strained. Since 1975, East Timor has been a recurring and<br />
sometimes divisive issue.<br />
My firm conviction is that the only realistic way for us to<br />
approach our relationship with Indonesia is to start from<br />
the assumption that, as neighbours, each side wants to deal<br />
with the other seriously and constructively.<br />
We can build a worthwhile relationship if we work on the<br />
firm ground of shared interests and develop institutional<br />
links which consolidate our progress.<br />
We must recognise continuing differences in our cultures and<br />
outlooks without allowing ourselves to be obsessed by them.<br />
Mr Speaker, this was the basic approach I followed in<br />
Indonesia, both in discussions with President Soeharto and<br />
his Ministers, and in public statements. </p>
<p>The centre-piece of my program in Jakarta was a very cordial<br />
two-hour discussion with President Soeharto. He explained<br />
at length the aspirations of the Indonesian people in regard<br />
to their independence, their progress in nation-building,<br />
and his own concern to nurture stable political<br />
institutions. In turn, I described the Government's commitment to lead<br />
Australia into whole-hearted engagement with Asia.<br />
This led us to agree to look for ways to strengthen the<br />
institutional framework of the bilateral relationship, to<br />
reflect better its growing maturity and diversity, and to<br />
guarantee its overall resilience in times of difficulty in<br />
specific areas.<br />
The President agreed to my proposal to establish a<br />
Ministerial Forum which will meet at least once every two<br />
years to review the bilateral relationship and set an agenda<br />
for cooperation, especially in economic areas.<br />
The Forum will be co-chaired by the two Foreign Ministers<br />
and involve at least two economic Ministers from each side.<br />
The President and I witnessed the signing of three bilateral<br />
agreements which add further shape to the formal framework<br />
of the relationship. They cover double taxation, fisheries<br />
cooperation and extradition.<br />
The Indonesian Government agreed to conclude further<br />
bilateral agreements, covering investment protection and<br />
promotion, copyright, the delimitation of outstanding<br />
maritime boundaries, and mutual assistance on criminal<br />
matters. My discussions with President Soeharto were complemented by<br />
very useful separate-meetings with Foreign Minister Alatas,<br />
six economic Ministers whom I met jointly and Defence<br />
Minister Moerdani.<br />
I was impressed by the calibre of the Ministers in the<br />
Indonesian Cabinet, and by their confident determination to<br />
continue the process of economic development and nationbuilding.<br />
I made a point of thanking Foreign Minister Alatas for the<br />
friendly and creative relations that he and Senator Evans<br />
have cemented for our joint benefit.<br />
With Defence Minister Moerdani, I repeated what I had said<br />
to President Soeharto about Australia's satisfaction with<br />
our bilateral defence relations with Indonesia, and our<br />
interest in expanding contacts such as high-level<br />
consultations, joint exercises, and training exchanges.<br />
General Moerdani supported the current approach of<br />
proceeding step by step and expressed confidence that our<br />
defence relations would continue to grow. </p>
<p>During my visit I was also glad to have the opportunity to<br />
lend the Government's support to the activities of<br />
Australian business in Indonesia.<br />
I opened offices for AOTC in Jakarta, the West Australian<br />
Government in Surabaya, and addressed an Indonesian and<br />
Australian business audience organised by the East Java<br />
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
There has been some comment in the Australian media to the<br />
effect that, in my discussions with the Indonesian<br />
Government, I did not give sufficient weight to Australian<br />
concerns about East Timor and human rights issues.<br />
Let me repeat what I said about this publicly in Jakarta.<br />
While recognising the importance of the media in both<br />
countries, I believe it is not up to them but to the two<br />
Governments to set the agenda for the bilateral<br />
relationship. The Indonesian Government responded positively to our<br />
putting first priority on the establishment of a basis for a<br />
long-term cooperative relationship.<br />
Having established a constructive basis for dialogue, I took<br />
appropriate opportunities to raise with President Soeharto,<br />
Foreign Minister Alatas, and Defence Minister Moerdani, our<br />
concern about the killings in Dili last November and human<br />
rights in East Timor.<br />
I registered firmly our view that the unhappy situation in<br />
East Timor detracts from Indonesia's otherwise impressive<br />
achievements, and said it is likely to continue to attract<br />
close public attention in Australia.<br />
I repeated the Australian Government's view that the<br />
Indonesian Government's response to the Dili killings had<br />
been a credible one.<br />
I underlined our continuing concern for the welfare of the<br />
East Timor people and emphasised three points:<br />
the need for a more benign, and therefore constructive,<br />
approach by the armed forces.<br />
the need for long-term reconciliation, taking account<br />
of the economic aspirations of the people of East<br />
Timor, and<br />
our concern about using the criminal code to deal with<br />
non-violent political protest. </p>
<p>I explained that our aim as concerned outsiders was not to<br />
challenge Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor, but to<br />
assist where we could in measures for the welfare of the<br />
people, and to support a process of reconciliation between<br />
them and the Indonesian authorities.<br />
As a practical example of how Australia can help, a<br />
memorandum was signed during my visit providing for an 11.5<br />
million dollar aid project to improve water suppy and<br />
sanitation in parts of East Timor.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
In advance of my visit to Indonesia, I had written to<br />
President Soeharto about the possibility of establishing a<br />
process of periodic Asia-Pacific heads-of-government<br />
meetings, preferably based on the APEC mechanism.<br />
I was encouraged by President Soeharto's response. He<br />
endorsed the proposal and underlined the need for proceeding<br />
carefully, a view with which I entirely agree.<br />
Since returning from Indonesia, I have received a letter<br />
from President Bush welcoming the proposal for periodic APEC<br />
heads-of-government meetings.<br />
He encouraged Australia to promote the proposal in a way<br />
that takes account of separate moves to develop the<br />
institutionalisation of APEC.<br />
The suggestion of periodic APEC heads-of-government meetings<br />
is not an initiative being pursued against a specific<br />
deadline. But it is intrinsically a worthwhile idea and is<br />
now finding its way on to the regional agenda.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
A recurring issue in Australia's relations with South-East<br />
Asia is whether our free media is an obstacle in the path of<br />
constructive relations.<br />
In fact, this issue arose at the end of an address to a<br />
large audience in Jakarta. I made a point of saying that I<br />
believed the Australian media and a free press in general<br />
need not be feared in Indonesia.<br />
Indeed, rather than wish us to constrain our media from<br />
disseminating what they might regard as unfairly critical<br />
views, they should themselves take advantage of the<br />
opportunity always available in our media to respond to the<br />
criticism. Mr Speaker<br />
it may be of particular interest to Members that the<br />
heightened interest in Australian identity and nationhood<br />
has struck a positive chord in Indonesia. </p>
<p>It is not really surprising that a country like Indonesia,<br />
which had to fight so hard for its independence, should be<br />
interested in the emergence here of a more clear-cut view of<br />
Australian nationhood.<br />
Let me emphasise that our purpose is not to ingratiate<br />
ourselves with Indonesia or any other nation, as some<br />
Members seem inclined to imply.<br />
Australia's nationhood, its re-generated sense of identity<br />
and purpose, will be determined by Australians, on<br />
Australian terms and as suits us best as a people.<br />
At the same time, there is no harm in observing that<br />
indications of a less equivocal sense of Australian<br />
nationhood actually help our foreign policy.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
My visit to Indonesia achieved all its objectives.<br />
It accelerated the building of a network of connections and<br />
institutional links: diplomatic, cultural and, above all,<br />
commercial links, which have given greater substance to the<br />
bilateral relationship.<br />
I amn satisfied I struck the right balance in underlining our<br />
commitment to a positive relationship with Indonesia, while<br />
firmly registering our views in areas of difference.<br />
There is now a basis for the expansion of relations with our<br />
largest close neighbour, a key country in a region vital to<br />
our security and prosperity.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
It was with great pleasure that I visited another close<br />
neighbour and important partner in the region, Papua New<br />
Guinea. That the visit was occasioned by the commemoration of the<br />
heroism and sacrifice of Australian, Papuan, New Guinean and<br />
Allied servicemen in the most crucial battles of our<br />
history, made it a privilege.<br />
It is a tragedy of our history that there are a great many<br />
places in the world where Australians died in battle and lie<br />
buried.<br />
The stories of their gallantry are legion, and the monuments<br />
and rituals we have constructed to their memory ensure that<br />
we will not forget.<br />
It is not surprising that the First World War which killed<br />
60,000 young Australians, and the first great battle in<br />
which Australians took part, Gallipoli, should have come to<br />
dominate our national legend in this century. </p>
<p>Yet it is ironic that our knowledge and appreciation of the<br />
battles which were truly in defence of this country and the<br />
civilisation we had built here are less well known.<br />
It is my earnest hope that the fiftieth anniversary<br />
commemoration of the terrible, yet ultimately triumphant,<br />
battles of the Kokoda Track, Milne Bay and other places in<br />
Papua New Guinea will re-awaken our regard for them, and in<br />
time fix them at the centre of our tradition.<br />
It is certainly to be hoped that the story of the campaign<br />
in Papua New Guinea, and the-story of the Battle for<br />
Australia in 1942, will become known to all Australians.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
It was one of my great privileges to pay, on behalf of<br />
Australia, due homage to the Papuan and New Guinean war<br />
carriers whose assistance to our troops was arguably the<br />
greatest humane gesture in our history.<br />
Arising from my discussions with Prime Minister Namaliu and<br />
my visit to Kokoda, I was happy to announce various steps<br />
the Australian Government will take to show our appreciation<br />
of past sacrifices for Australia and Papua New Guinea.<br />
I offered Australian assistance to establish in the Waigani<br />
district of Port Moresby a memorial to commemorate the deeds<br />
of the PNG war carriers.<br />
As I said in the House last week, I warmly welcome Prime<br />
Minister Namaliu's announcement that the KokodaTrail and<br />
Kokoda village will be declared a nationalf heritage area to<br />
preserve their historical significance.<br />
While in Papua New Guinea, I announced that the Australian<br />
Government would be happy to help establish rest facilities<br />
for people walking along the Kokoda Trail, improve local<br />
welfare facilities at Kokoda, and improve the local war<br />
museum. The cooperation between Australians and Papua New Guineans<br />
in defence of their countries left a profound friendship as<br />
its legacy.<br />
That it endures was plain in the reception we received<br />
everywhere we went, and in discussions with the Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Namaliu and other officials.<br />
Papua New Guinea's democracy remains vigorous.<br />
Through a difficult period of structural adjustment, the<br />
economy has become more competitive and resilient.<br />
Notwithstanding the effects of the Bougainville problem and<br />
falls in commodity prices, in 1991 real GDP grew by 9 per<br />
cent. </p>
<p>Driven by developments in the mining sector, that growth<br />
rate presages a resources boom which, if it is managed<br />
judiciously, promises to lay a sound basis for the country's<br />
economic future.<br />
PNG has also become more outward looking.<br />
Like Australia, it is working to make the most of the<br />
opportunities generated by growth in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region. Without abandoning its ties with the South Pacific, it has<br />
developed new links with ASEAN.<br />
It has consolidated a close relationship with our mutual<br />
neighbour, Indonesia.<br />
Australia's economic relationship with PNG continues to<br />
expand. Two-way trade last year reached a record 1.7 billion<br />
dollars, an increase of 48 per cent over the previous year.<br />
Opportunities for our exports should rise as demand is<br />
generated by the anticipated resources boom.<br />
The principal problem for PNG remains the one which its<br />
Prime Minister defined so precisely without security,<br />
economic development cannot proceed, and without<br />
development, security cannot be guaranteed.<br />
Mr Speaker, during my visit I reaffirmed Australia's<br />
commitment to security and defence cooperation with Papua<br />
New Guinea, as set out in the Agreed Statement on Security<br />
Cooperation of September 1991.<br />
But more work needs to be done to ensure that this<br />
cooperation is fully effective. In particular, I stressed<br />
the need for Papua New Guinea to develop its own integrated<br />
and comprehensive plan of action on security force reform<br />
and resource allocation.<br />
During my talks in Port Moresby I stressed the need for a<br />
peaceful solution, through dialogue and reconciliation, to<br />
the continuing problems of Bougainville.<br />
I made it clear that Australia was willing to help with the<br />
reconstruction that will be needed on Bougainville.<br />
At the same time I stressed the need for the PNG government<br />
to keep up regular supplies of humanitarian goods and<br />
channels of communication with Bougainvilleans, and,<br />
equally, our desire to facilitate such aid.<br />
we can be confident, I believe, that the people of Papua New<br />
Guinea have the will and the capacity to meet the challenges<br />
which face them. </p>
<p>Australia stands ready to give what help it can on the path<br />
to greater stability and prosperity.<br />
As partners in a changing world, a self-reliant PNG, and<br />
thus a PNG better placed to realise its aspirations and<br />
potential, will be in both our interests.<br />
Mr Speaker, the world is undergoing profound changes and<br />
nowhere is this more the case than in our own neighbourhood.<br />
During the past decade the economies of North-East and<br />
South-East Asia have been expanding at approximately twice<br />
the world average.<br />
They will continue to grow.<br />
Through our strategic location and expanding links with the<br />
region, Australia stands to benefit greatly.<br />
It will not happen without an effort. It will require<br />
imagination, initiative and persistence. It will require<br />
belief in ourselves.<br />
It will require these things from governments, Federal and<br />
State. It will require them from business.<br />
It will require them, I believe, at a truly national level.<br />
By this, I mean that to seize the opportunities and assure<br />
our long-term security, without prejudice to our<br />
predominantly British and European origins and our<br />
continuing affections for those places, we must determine as<br />
a people to think of Australia as a place whose history is<br />
its own, whose traditions and values are its own, whose<br />
future is most definitely its own.<br />
In going to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea I sought to<br />
strengthen our regional linkages, to open dialogues, and to<br />
help to lay the foundations for relationships which will<br />
enable us to contribute to and share in the fruits of<br />
regional growth.<br />
I sought to demonstrate the importance Australia attaches to<br />
its growing integration with the Asia-Pacific region, and<br />
the importance we attach and must attach to increasing<br />
the breadth and depth of our understanding of those<br />
countries. Mr Speaker<br />
I do not think we should be surprised if we find that in<br />
coming to know our neighbours as never before, we come to<br />
know ourselves as never before. </p>
