OPENING OF RED CROSS HOUSE, HOBART PLACE,<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T.-19th SE-PTEMBER7 1961+<br />
Speech by thie Prie inister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir Roy and Lady Oliver, Your Excellencies and Gentlemen:<br />
Before I forget, I declare the building oper,.<br />
( Laughter) ( Applause) Whatever I say hereaf. ter will be just<br />
a trifling bonus because the job is now done.<br />
I was very interested in what Sir Roy was saying.<br />
Of course, he is an old Chief of Staff, and chiefs of staff<br />
seldom miss an opportunity of getting a little money or a<br />
project out of the Government. ( Laughter) I was therefore<br />
a little disappointed when he comforted you by telling you<br />
that with these admirable and highly solvent tenants in the<br />
building, they will wipe off the debt. I was sorry that he<br />
said tha. I thought he was going to say, " Well, that will<br />
help us, but unless we get a lot more hel~ p from you people,<br />
we will have a debt hanging around our neck."' This is a<br />
point that I make for him. ( Laughter) Because, of course<br />
this is just a small building. When Canberr'a . has risen i<br />
its fullest state, this will have to be added to, This -will<br />
I hop0, ir, due course, Dr. Newman Morris, become the national<br />
headquarters of -U* he Red Cross in th'a Capital of this co'intry.<br />
Therefore I suggcst to Sir Roy that he ought to<br />
always keep on his face that st..--ige l2ook of a man who is<br />
yearning for somebody to produce some money. It is quite<br />
easily done; as I tell. you, in the past I have seen him do<br />
it, ( Laughter) sometimes with~ success.<br />
It Is a very interesting conjunction of events<br />
today because putting it in round terms the Red Cross<br />
Movementl-is 160 years old and the Australian branch or organisation<br />
is 50 years old and therefore we are dealing with an<br />
organisatien which already has achieved considerable seniority.<br />
T was reminded, when I was thinking -about this matter today,<br />
that the founder of Red Cross was and I hesitate to pronounce<br />
his name because of local rules about French names but I<br />
will call him Andre Dunant and if anybody says it's " Dunant"<br />
I accept correction. ( Laughter)<br />
But he was a very remarkable man in two respects.<br />
One was that the battlefield of Solferino filled him with the<br />
most tremendous ideas that something ought to be done about<br />
the care of the wounded and it ought to be done without having<br />
regard to sides, it ought to be done in a broad sweep of<br />
humane action, and that nations themselves ought to subscribe<br />
to a convention so that all those who needed attention as a<br />
result of battle could have it irrespective of what side they<br />
had been on. This is elementary enough to us today who have<br />
inherited the benefit of this matter, but in those days, an<br />
idea of immense novelty but of course, so profoundly humane<br />
in its conception that It took on and before long, most if<br />
not all of the nations of the worldahad understood it, subscribed<br />
to it. The second interesting thing about it was that he<br />
drew some inspiration, a great deal of inspiration from the<br />
work of Florence Nightingale. You know, Sir, I speak with<br />
hesitation in the presence of distinguished Generals and<br />
people of that order, but really, the Crimean War, and the<br />
events which followed on it, are very difficult to understand 0 oeeo./ 2 </p>
<p>r -2<br />
today. It seems an almost inexplicable contest. It did<br />
two things, anyhow, in the case of Australia. It honoured<br />
the names of its not frightfully competent Generals by<br />
attaching their names to hotels and items of clothing ( Laughter),<br />
and so we have a raglan sleeve, a cardigan jacket, and hotels<br />
in the suburbs in Australia were built at that time richly<br />
garnished with their names, and this, I think, is very satisfactory.<br />
If they were now alive and looked back on it they<br />
might feel that they had done better than they knew. ( Laughter)<br />
But the remarkable thing about it was the conflict,<br />
so difficult to understand as we look at it over a hundred<br />
years later, gave rise to two most astonishing developments.<br />
The first of them, of course, will always -be associated with<br />
the name of Florence Nightingale. I think people are<br />
occasionally inclined to think of her as the Lady with the<br />
Lamp, as a rather benign and kindly creature, who soothed the<br />
brows of those who needed attention in the Crimea, She wac<br />
of course, one of the most astonishing women of the nineteenth<br />
century, one of the most a stonishing people, male or female,<br />
of the nineteenth century.<br />
It isn't for nothing that Lytton Strachey, when he<br />
wrote abcut eminent Victorians, included her in his relatively<br />
small galle:' y, because she had enormous strength of will,<br />
tremendous ability, a superb capacity for telling politicians<br />
where they got off, considerable fam.-' ly influenca which 3he<br />
didn't hesitate to use. She was responsible herself for the<br />
whole modern character of nursing. Indeed, I 3lways delight<br />
to remember the story of Queen Victoria, herself a very strongminded<br />
woman, always sure that she was right and, sometimes,<br />
let it be admitted, she was right but not always, But when<br />
she had had Florence Nightingale up to tePalace in audience,<br />
and had listened to her and had fallen under the spell of her<br />
personality, she wa~ s reported, as many of you will recall to<br />
have said " Ah, what a mindl She ought to be in 2-harge o<br />
the War Office," ( Laughter)<br />
Nc, w, Florence Nightingale; we can have all sorts<br />
cl, views, very properly quite sentimental about her. The<br />
fact is that this woman was one of the great creative people<br />
of the last century. She created the whole modern conception<br />
of hospital treatment and of nursing and she did it at a time<br />
when it was considered faintly disreputable to become a nurse,<br />
when the popular image of the nurse was the one created by<br />
Dickens you know when he decribes Sairey Gamp who had a<br />
little container on the mantelpiece and took a drop of it when<br />
she felt disposedo ( Laughter) This was a revolutiun that was<br />
created by Florence Nightingale. She is one of the great<br />
people in our entire history, And then this was followed up,<br />
partly I am sure as a result of the stimulus of hier example,<br />
by the creation by this great Frenchman of the Red Cross idea<br />
and of the Red Cross organisation.<br />
Now, Sir Roy Dowling who has devoted a tremendous<br />
amount of energy I think with great public spirit to this<br />
matter, has told you something about its history, something<br />
about its numbers today, something about its growth, and all<br />
this, of courses is tremendously stimulating. I just want to<br />
supplement what he said by mentioning one point.<br />
In time of war the work of the Red Cross becomes<br />
vividly clear in the public eye. Nobody doubts its enormous 0 a 00 </p>
<p>-3<br />
value, its tremendous and sacrificial efforts in time of war,<br />
and in time of peace, we are a little inclined to think<br />
" Well, that's over" and also to think 111dell that canli<br />
happen here" and there is threfore a danger that the Red<br />
Cross may come to be regarded as something that falls back<br />
into a state of hibernation between one war and another.<br />
Now, I just want to say to you that you can't in<br />
the event of war bring into existence a mass of' services of<br />
this kind without notice in a week or two, any more than you<br />
can bring into existence armed forces to perform th. eir tasks<br />
at a notice of a week or two. There must be tremendous<br />
preparation when we are in a state of peace and the more<br />
the Red Cross organisation is sustained, not onl-y by the money,<br />
by the understanding and moral support of the people of<br />
Australia, between wars or after a war, the better it will<br />
be for our efficacy in these fields whatever may come.<br />
I beg of ' you, don't let us fall into the error of<br />
thinking that wilen all is quiet the Red Cross doesn't matter<br />
and that when all is not quiet we may suddenly expect to find<br />
a fully sustained and well organised Red Cross, ready to do<br />
its work at th3 drop of a handkerchief'. In otber words, we<br />
must, I 1elieve ir Australia keep our interest in the work of<br />
the Red Crcss always up to date, keep our personal support<br />
up to date, keep our financial support up to date, because it<br />
is only iii that w~ ay that when the big strains come on to it,<br />
it will be able to sustain them and perform its remarkable<br />
lunction-on behalf of humanity.<br />
And so. Sir ' Roy, I amn delighted to think that6 in this<br />
city, increasingly becoming recognised as the capita). of this<br />
nation, you have this building, a building which will serve<br />
as a constan't reminder-to peopl~ e of the significance of what<br />
goes on. I dontt wanc to say any more thrn that because I<br />
don't subscribe to this old doctrine that when people come and<br />
sit in -the shade and feel cold, they ought to be compelled<br />
to listen to politicians ad nauseam. I don't believe in that<br />
at all, so I'm not going to detain you, but I want to say to<br />
you, Lady Oliver, that I accapt your invitation with very<br />
great pleasure* I am delighted to find that somebody like<br />
yourself, distinguished in office and in person, has been<br />
so actively engaged in this matter.<br />
I publicly acknowledge -the great services that have<br />
been rendered by Sir Roy, by Dr. Williams, by all those who<br />
have been mentioned; I needntt go through them, one by one.<br />
I would like to extend my own congratulations to the Minister<br />
for the Interior and to the Chairman of the Capital Commission<br />
because a great deal ol co-operation has performed itself in the<br />
bringing about of the result that we see today,<br />
There's a rule in Parliament, in the Standing Orders,<br />
and as I don't need to tell some of you, the Standing Orders<br />
are an interesting document, never observed by presiding<br />
officers or members, but there is a rule in the Standing Orders<br />
against tedious repetition. I shall now in the highest<br />
tradition of Parliament, violate that rule. I will engage in<br />
repetition. I declare the building open. </p>
