PF. No. 77/ 1972<br />
OIL DISPUTE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt.<br />
Hon. William McMahon, CH, M,.<br />
All Australians will welcome the end of the oil strike,<br />
with the prospect of the life of the community being quickly<br />
returned to normal.<br />
This solution by Mr. Justice Moore vindicates the value<br />
of the conciliation and arbitration system. It also vindicates<br />
the Government's determination to protect the public interest,<br />
if necessary, with emergency measures by Parliament.<br />
This action obviously created a favourable climate in<br />
which a proper solution could be found.<br />
I have accordingly informed the presiding officers that<br />
I do not now seek a meeting of Parliament tomorrow.<br />
CANBERRA, 3rd August, 1972.<br />
