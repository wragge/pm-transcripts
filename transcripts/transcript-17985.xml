The Gillard Government today outlined an easy way for Australian households to understand the assistance provided for the cost of living impacts of the carbon price.</p>
<p>The online household assistance estimator is a guide to help families understand the impact a carbon price is expected to have on their budgets, as well as the assistance being provided.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today visited a family at Emu Plains in western Sydney where they viewed the online assistance estimator and discussed the Government's planned assistance that will be provided through a price on carbon.</p>
<p>It is important that Australians have access to direct information about what a carbon price means for them.</p>
<p>All a householder will need to do is visit the Clean Energy Future website at <a href="http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au">www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au</a>, answer a few simple questions and they will see an estimate of the amount of assistance a household like theirs is likely to receive.</p>
<p>The assistance estimator uses a set of typical household types to provide an indication of the assistance different households will receive from May or June next year.</p>
<p>It doesn't give an exact result given everyone's circumstances are unique, but it provides a good guide to help households understand what the carbon price will mean for them.</p>
<p>The assistance estimator is secure and will not retain any personal details.</p>
<p>More than half of the revenue raised through a carbon price will go to households in the form of tax cuts and increases in pensions, allowances and family payments.</p>
<p>This means Australians can do their bit for climate change and look after their household budgets.</p>
<p>Nine out of ten households will receive assistance through tax cuts and/or payment increases under the carbon price plan.</p>
<p>Almost 6 million households will get tax cuts or increases in payments that cover the entire average price impact.</p>
<p>More than 4 million Australian households will get an extra buffer with assistance that covers 120 per cent of the average price impact of the carbon price.</p>
<p>On average, the carbon price will cost households $9.90 per week but they get $10.10 per week in assistance.</p>
<p>This assistance is permanent and will increase. The Government will review the adequacy of assistance each year and will increase it further if necessary.</p>
<p>The Government's assistance package will help households deal with any cost of living impacts caused by the introduction of a carbon price as we move towards a clean energy future.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, households will not need to apply for assistance as it will be automatically delivered to them through the personal income tax and Government payment systems.</p>
<p>Under the package, more than 1 million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return.</p>
<p>The household assistance estimator and other information is available at <a href="http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au">www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au</a></p>
