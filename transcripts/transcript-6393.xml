FOR MEDIA 14 May 1984<br />
In reviewing the current and prospective state of the<br />
Australian economy, EPAC members agreed that in all significpnt<br />
respects, performance was superior to the expectations of any<br />
group at the time of the Summit. Recent performance on growth,<br />
employment, inflation, the relationship between wages and prices,<br />
and improvement in corporate profitability, have all been well above<br />
expectations.<br />
While it was recognised that the exceptionally good seasonal<br />
conditions and the strong growth performance of the United States<br />
economy had contributed to our own growth, and that these positive<br />
influences could weaken or reverse in future, the domestic noni-farm,<br />
economy had performed extremely well.<br />
The strong underlying peiformance and the continued successful<br />
operation of the Prices and Incomes Accord, have provided<br />
Australia with a rare opportunity to MOVE! to a path of sustained<br />
growth with inflation no higher than that of our trading partners.<br />
The objectives of the 1984-85 budget therefore must be the<br />
continuation of high growth based on the maintenance of stabil. ity<br />
in costs, prices and policies and the consequent expansion of<br />
the nation's productive capacity and international Competitiveness.<br />
EPAC believes that in framing the 1984-85 budget the Government<br />
should not be obsessed with any particular budget deficit figure.<br />
It recognises the Government's overall objective to reduce<br />
pressure on financial markets by significantly reducing the<br />
deficit. it is4 vital that budgetary policy continue to be based on<br />
providing economic stimulus without accommnodating any reversal<br />
in the downward trend in inflation, while supportung the<br />
Prices and Incomes approach to economic management. To this end<br />
budgetary policy should be aimed at:<br />
Providing significant income tax cuts as an essential<br />
feature of the Accord to reduce cost pressures faced by<br />
employers and employees, having regard to increases in<br />
inflation and their effects on the tax scales, the<br />
impact on the Medicare levy and the ulesire to maintain<br />
wage anid price stability. EPAC believes that the priority<br />
for such tax cuts should be for low and middle income<br />
earners. </p>
<p>Ensuring that the level of demand is sufficient to<br />
provide an adequate incentive for private investment.<br />
Developing a positive framework for investment, particulari.<br />
private investment. In this respect EPAC believes that"<br />
budgetary policy must be integrated with and not<br />
disruptive of industry policy.<br />
Co-ordinating the demands of the Commonwealth, State<br />
and local governments upon financial markets, within<br />
an environment of rigorous control of total government<br />
expenditure. Priority for increases in welfare expenditure for those<br />
most in need. </p>
