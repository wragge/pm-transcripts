    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ian, thank you so very, very much indeed. Thank you so much Ladies and Gentlemen, Parliamentary colleagues, Ambassadors, High Commissioners, everyone here who is a friend of cricket and particularly a friend of ACT cricket.</p>
<p>Look, Ian, I too would love a long innings, and Iâd like to have quite a few fixtures underneath my portrait there, but, that can only happen if my skill at politics turns out to be far greater than my competence on the cricket field!</p>
<p>But look, it is a real thrill to be here tonight. It is great to be associated with this annual event. </p>
<p>Itâs an honour to be seventh prime minister associated with this event and of course, as usual, anything to do with politics is controversial and Ian says thereâs been 38 of these prime ministerâs fixtures; I say thereâs been 44. </p>
<p>But, I did come across something today which I believe is absolutely factual and this is a letter that Sir Donald Bradman wrote to Prime Minister Menzies, prior to the 1963 game. Sir Donald said, âMy dear Mr Menzies, I have been thinking about your suggestion that I might captain your team at Canberra on the 6th of February. You know it is 15 years, this year, since I played a first class match, and several years now since I played a social game. It is quite impossible of me to be of any value as a player and my question of making 10 or 20 runs would be purely one of the charity of the opposition. Would it be fair to all concerned that the image of Bradman playing should be dangled before the eyes of the public, when it could at best be a mirage? Still, if you think these factors unimportant and reflecting on them, decide to invite me, I shall of course be delighted to accept and will leave it entirely to your judgmentâ. </p>
<p>Well, history records that on that day in 1963 Sir Donald came out onto this oval and was bowled for four by the English quick Brian Statham. Brian Statham did his best to get the umpire to âno ballâ the delivery, but to no avail, Sir Donald had departed for the grandstand.</p>
<p>This game has, as I understand it, been a difficult one for old legends. In fact, the very inaugural game, that other legend Jack Fingleton, was bowled first ball of the first over for zero. </p>
<p>But, it has been the making of some future legends â Richie Benaud,Â  David Boon and of course, the young Brett Lee, who not only made a mark here many years ago, but he bowled devastatingly today and I thought it was good of him not only to perform on the field, but to come and perform off the field for us just a few moments ago and given that I think 250 plus will be quite a target to chase on this oval, I hope interviewing him has not distracted him from his main job, which is to win this game.</p>
<p>But look, we have seen some excellent performances out there today, from young Muirhead. I hope that Jackson Bird - an old boy of Saint Ignatius College and also an old boy from Our Lady of Good Counsel of Forestville - might be recalled to the squad for South Africa. Let us hope, let us hope, that that is the result of today.</p>
<p>Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, I canât say too much about cricket because at the age of 13 I was put briefly in the nets to bat and to bowl and was told by the sports master that I was a rower, not a cricketer! </p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think I can say something about sport. </p>
<p>The great thing about sport â all team sports â is that youâve got to have a go and youâve got to join the team. And itâs extraordinary isnât it, reading that 1962 letter from Sir Donald Bradman, how the then 55 year old, worldâs greatest cricketer was prepared to have a go and to join the team at need. </p>
<p>This is the essence of sportsmanship. Itâs the reason why so many people think that sport does build character. I certainly believe that sport is an important part of the personal formation of anyone who plays any serious sport, certainly anyone who plays seriously any team game. </p>
<p>May todayâs game, whatever the result, add to the rich tapestry of Australian and international sport.</p>
<p>Thank you so much. </p>
