PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA .5 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER AND MR LAURIE SHORT,<br />
NATIONAL SECRETARY OF THE FEDERATED IRONWORKERS ASSOCIATION<br />
Discussions were held today between the Prime Minister and<br />
senior Ministers and a delegation from the Federated<br />
Ironworkers Association.<br />
The FIA delegation comprised:<br />
Mr Laurie Short, National Secretary<br />
Mr Joe Caesar, National President<br />
Mr Harry Hurrell, Assistant National Secretary<br />
Mr Bill Hopkins, National Vice-President<br />
Mr Peter Kelly, Director, Public Affairs<br />
As a result of a request put today by the Federated Ironworkers<br />
Association, the Government has decided that an Industry<br />
Coun Cil will be established, to advise the Government on<br />
matters affecting the iron and steel industry in Australia.<br />
The new Council will be chaired by either the<br />
Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for<br />
Emnployment and Industrial Relations, depending on the issues<br />
before it at particular times.<br />
The FIA will be putting its view to the Government concerning<br />
membership and terms of reference for the council.<br />
The Government, for its part, will be seeking urgently the<br />
views of the ACTU and the industry concerning the Council's<br />
membership and terms of reference with a view to conducting<br />
the first meeting of the Council as soon as possible.<br />
It was accepted by both the FIA and the Government that a long<br />
period of restructuring will be necessary if Australia is to<br />
have a viable, efficient and profitable steel industry. It is<br />
the view of both the Association and the Government that,<br />
with plentiful supplies of iron ore and coal in Australia,<br />
there should be a strong and viable steel industry in this<br />
country. This is a firm-objective of the Government. / 2<br />
J1 AUSTRALIA </p>
<p>-2<br />
A great deal has to be done by all parties concerned to overcome<br />
the industry's current difficulties and to establish firmly<br />
the future viability of the industry.<br />
The Government informed the Association that it has made its<br />
decision in relation to the recent TAA Report, and that<br />
the decision could not be varied without further<br />
reference to either the IAC or to the TAA. If the industry<br />
made out a case for a further referenc e to the TAA to the<br />
Department of Industry and Commerce, the Government would<br />
examine any such case as a matter of urgency.<br />
It was apparent from the discussions that there were differing<br />
perceptions by the Government and the FIA as to the reasons<br />
for the redundancies announced yesterday by BHP. it was<br />
agreed that this was a matter that required clarification, and that<br />
it would be discussed at the first meeting of the industry<br />
council.<br />
The Government indicated to the FIA that its objective would<br />
be to have the membership and terms of reference of the new Council<br />
established to enable its first meeting to be held as quickly<br />
as possible, but certainly within a month.<br />
That meeting would, therefore, be held before any of the<br />
redundancies announced by BHP begin to be put into effect.<br />
The Government would also be seeking the views of the unions<br />
and the industry regarding those matters that ought to be<br />
listed on the first agenda at that meeting.<br />
It was noted that the report of the IAC into long term assistance<br />
to the steel industry is currently due in May of next year.<br />
The Governme ' nt will examine the feasibility of that report<br />
being made available earlier. It was also noted that when the<br />
IAC's draft report becomes available it would be the subject<br />
of consideration by the Industry Council. </p>
