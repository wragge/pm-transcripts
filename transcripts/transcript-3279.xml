SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, Mi. P.,<br />
FOR THE OPENING OF THE CAIRNS CIVIC CENTRE,<br />
CAIRNS, QUEENSLAND,<br />
FRIDAY 31 M. AY 1974<br />
THIS IS A VERY HAPPY OCCASION FOR ME. WHATEVER YOU<br />
MAY THINK OF. MY FEELINGS TOWARDS QUEENSLAND, THERE CAN BE NO<br />
DOUBT ABOUT MY FEELINGS TOWARDS CAIRNS. I CAME HERE FOR A FEW<br />
DAYS JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN; I AM HERE AGAIN<br />
IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT. I AM DELIGHTED THAT MY FIRST OFFICIAL<br />
DUTY SINCE THE RE-ELECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO OPEN THIS<br />
SPLENDID CIVIC CENTRE IN CAIRNS. IT WILL CONFIRM YOUR POSITION<br />
AS QNE OF THE MOST PROSPEROUS AND DYNAMIC PROVINCIAL CITIES IN<br />
AUSTRALIA. THE PLANNING OF THIS CENTRE BEGAN JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN 1972. 1 BELIEVE IT SYMBOLISES TWO<br />
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PRINCIPAL CONCERNS: ITS COMMITMENT TO THE<br />
ARTS AND ITS COMMITMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE BEGUN<br />
SOMETHING IN THIS CITY WHICH I HOPE WILL SERVE AS A MODEL NOT<br />
ONLY FOR THE REST OF OUEENSLAND BUT FOR THE WHOLE OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
OF ALL THE AUSTRALIAN STATES, QUEENSLAND IS BY FAR THE MOST<br />
DECENTRALISED. IT HAS MANY THRIVING RURAL CENTRES. THE<br />
VIGOUR, THE INDIVIDUALITY, THE VITALITY OF YOURS RURAL AND<br />
PROVINCIAL CITIES SHOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR OTHER STATES<br />
AND REGIONS TO CULTIVATE SIMILAR GROWTH CENTRES AWAY FROM<br />
THE CAPITAL CITIES. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
TO DO SO IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT CITIES LIKE CAIRNS SHOULD ENJOY<br />
THE SAME FACILITIES FOR CULTURE AND RECREATION THAT ARE AVAILABLE<br />
TO THE PEOPLE OF BRISBANE, SYDNEYAND MELBOURNE. THIS CENTRE<br />
IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF WHAT CONCERNED AND VIGOROUS LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT CAN ACHIEVE WITH THE SUPPORT AND CO-OPERATION OF<br />
YOUR STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE LOCAL PEOPLE. I CONGRATULATE ALL<br />
THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED FOR THIS BUILDING AND FOR THE IDEALS AND<br />
PURPOSES IT EMBODIES.<br />
THERE IS, PERHAPS, AN ADDED SIGNIFICANCE IN THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF A CULTURAL CENTRE HERE IN CAIRNS. YOU STAND<br />
AT THE MEETING POINT OF THREE CULTURES THE EUROPEAN, THE<br />
ABORIGINAL AND THE TORRES STRAIT ISLAND. I BELIEVE YOU ARE<br />
IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO ABSORB AND DISSEMINATE IDEAS AND STYLES<br />
MAY<br />
WHICHIWELL PROVE, IN THE LONGER PERSPECTIVE OF HISTORY, TO-BE<br />
OF IMPORTANCE TO THE WHOLE WORLD.<br />
WHEN MY GOVERNMENT SET OUT TO IMPLEMENT ITS POLICY IN<br />
THE ARTS IT FACED SOME DIFFICULT'DECISIONS, THEY SPRANG FROM<br />
THE FACT THAT WHILE AUSTRALIA WAS RICH IN ARTISTIC TALENT,<br />
AND PROBABLY POTENTIALLY RICHER THAN ANYONE CAN EASILY IMAGINE,<br />
IT LACKED THE RESOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT TALENT.<br />
VAST AREAS OF THE COUNTRY WERE WITHOUT EITHER THE PEOPLE OR THE<br />
PLACES WHICH COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF THE ARTS. YET IF WE WERE TO DEVOTE OUR AVAILABLE FUNDS TO<br />
BUILDING THE PLACES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO SPEND ON<br />
THE PEOPLE. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
So WE WERE FORCED TO ESTABLISH CERTAIN PRIORITIES, AND OUR<br />
PRIORITIES WERE THESE: FIRST, TO SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES,<br />
TO MAINTAIN AND PROMOTE STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE; THEN TO SUPPORT<br />
THE TRAINING OF ARTISTS, WHICH WOULD PRODUCE THE NEXT GENERATION<br />
OF CREATIVE TALENT; THEN TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES WHICH WOULD<br />
INVOLVE COMMUNITIES, TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND ENSURE<br />
AUDIENCES, WITHOUT WHICH NO ARTIST CAN SURVIVE; AND FINALLY TO<br />
COLLABORATE WITH OTHER BODIES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, TO GIVE THE<br />
ARTS A BROADER.. BASE OF SUPPORT THAN A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ALONE<br />
CAN PROVIDE. I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT HERE IN CAIRNS WE HAVE A PROJECT<br />
IN WHICH ALL THESE OBJECTIVES CAN BE ACHIEVED. YOU HAVE CHOSEN<br />
BY YOUR OWN INITIATIVE TO CREATE A CENTRE OF ACTIVITY, AND YOU<br />
HAVE HAD THE SUPPORT OF YOUR STATE GOVERNMENT IN DOING SO.<br />
YOU WILL BE LOOKING TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. FOR SUPPORT<br />
FOR THE ACTIVITIES HERE, AND SO LONG" AS YOU AIM FOR EXCELLENCE<br />
AND FOR THE WIDEST COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT, THAT SUPPORT WILL<br />
NOT BE LACKING. THE ORGANISATION OF THIS CENTRE SHOWS THAT YOU HAVE<br />
GOT YOUR PRIORITIES RIGHT, EXACTLY RIGHT. THE CITIES OF THE<br />
WORLD ARE LITTERED WITH BUILDINGS ERECTED WITH THE BEST OF<br />
INTENTIONS, BUT WITH A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS OF THE<br />
ARTS AND THE NEED OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. CAIRNS IN THE FUTURE<br />
WILL HAVE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT; A BUILDING CREATED IN<br />
RESPONSE TO LOCAL" NEEDS. </p>
<p>THE FACT IS THAT MANY OF THE MOST ORIGINAL AND<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE ENTERPRISES IN THE ARTS HAVE COME FROM QUEENSLAND.<br />
YOU DEVELOPED THE IDEA OF THE FLYING ARTS SCHOOL; YOU HAVE<br />
MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN SUCH'FIELDS AS YOUTH ORCHESTRAS AND<br />
YOUNG OPERA GROUPS. YOU HAVE MANAGED TO BUILD UP A RANGE OF<br />
ACTIVITIES WHICH SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE WELL AND DO YOU<br />
GREAT CREDIT. I MIGHT MENTION THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
THROUGH THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS AND ITS BOARDS,<br />
HAS ALREADY GIVEN MORE THAN $ 500,000 IN VARIOUS FORMS OF<br />
SUPPORT TO THE STATE, AND A GOOD PART OF IT HAS GONE TO THE<br />
NORTHERN PART OF QUEENSLAND.<br />
IN THE PERFORMING ARTS, $ 130,000 HAS GONE TO THE<br />
QUEENSLAND THEATRE COMPANY AND $ 35,000 TO THE TWELFTH MIGHT<br />
THEATRE; THE QUEENSLAND BALLET COMPANY HAS RECEIVED $ 25,000<br />
AND THE QUEENSLAND OPERA COMPANY $ 49,000. THE LARGEST SHARE<br />
OF THE LITERATURE BOARD GRANTS TOTALLING $ 45,000 WENT TO<br />
INDIVIDUAL WRITERS TO ALLOW THEM MORE TIME FOR WRITING.<br />
THE VISUAL ARTS BOARD HAS GIVEN GRANTS TOTALLING $ 57,09n<br />
TO INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS AS WELL AS $ 21,000 TO THE EASTAUS<br />
ARTS SCHOOL, THE FLYING ARTS SCHOOL WHICH TAKES PAINTING<br />
TO OUTBACK AREAS: $ 7,500 TO THE TOWNSVILLE ARTS SOCIETY<br />
AND VARIOUS AMOUNTS TO OTHER GROUPS SUCH AS THE SOCIETY OF<br />
SCULPTORS OF QUEENSLAND. </p>
<p>THE QUEENSLAND FESTIVAL OF ARTS RECEIVED A $ 10,0' n)<br />
GRANT AND THE TOlWNSVILLE PACIFIC FESTIVAL $ 2,000; THE CHILDRENS<br />
CREATIVE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATION $ 3,040 AND THE MT. [ SA CULTURAL<br />
VACATION SCHOOL $ 2,130. CRAFTSMEN RECEIVED GRANTS TOTALLING<br />
$ 42,000 AND MUSIC GENERALLY $ 132,000. AMONG THE MUSIC GRANTS<br />
WAS ONE OF $ 12,360 TO THE OUEENSLAND CONSERVATORIUM OF MIUSIC<br />
TO MAINTAIN A STRING QUARTET IN RE SIDENCE. ALONG WITH THESE<br />
GRANTS $ 48,000 HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE QUEENSLAND DIVISION OF<br />
THE ARTS COUNCIL SPEC IFICALLY FOR TOURING PERFORMANCES IN<br />
COUNTRY AREAS. THERE WAS ALSO A $ 10,000 GRANT FROM THE<br />
FILM AND TELEVISION BOARD FOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT FOR<br />
THE BRISBANE FILM-MAKERS CO-OPERATIVE.<br />
OUR COMMITMENT TO THE ARTS MUST BE SEEN IN<br />
CONJUJNCTION WITH OUR COMMITMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT, FOR<br />
PARTICIPATION IN THE ARTS, AND ENJOYMENT OF THE ARTS OFTEN<br />
REFLECT LOCAL NEEDS, LOCAL TASTES AND, IN MANY CASES, LOCAL<br />
CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL INFLUENCES. By PROMOTING MORE<br />
VIGOROUS LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE ARE THEREFORE CULTIVATING A<br />
MORE FERTILE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE ARTS CAN PROSPER.<br />
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA, AND PARTICULARLY IN QUEENSLAND.<br />
IN MY POLICY SPEECH FOR THE 1972 ELECTIONS I SAID: " LET<br />
THERE BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT LABOR'S DETERMINATION TO MAKE<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT A GENUINE PARTNER IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM."<br />
THAT DETERMINATION STILL STANDS. IT WAS REITERATED IN MY<br />
POLICY SPEECH FOR THE ELECTION ON 18 MAY IN THESE TERMS: </p>
<p>-6-<br />
" WE HAVE SOUGHT TO MAKE LOCAL GOVERNMENT A<br />
GENUINE PARTNER IN AUSTRALIA'S FEDERAL SYSTEM,<br />
WE HAVE REMODELLED THE GRANTS COMMISSION TO<br />
ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES TO MAKE<br />
SUBMISSIONS AND TO ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO<br />
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY<br />
NEEDED TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN REGIONS<br />
AND WITHINSTATES AS TRADITIONALLY IT USED TO<br />
DO AS BETWEEN THE STATES,<br />
" THE ROLE WE ASSIGN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THE<br />
REAL ANSWER TO CHARGES OF CENTRALISM, UNDER<br />
A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS WE HAVE PROVIDED LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT WITH THE FUNDS TO UNDERTAKE A RANGE<br />
OF ACTIVITIES PREVIOUSLY INADEQUATELY CARRIED<br />
OUT OR TOTALLY NEGLECTED, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ASSISTANCE PLAN, THE PROGRAMS FOR COMMUNITY<br />
HEALTH, AREA IMPROVEMENT, THE NATIONAL ESTATE,<br />
THE ARTS, TOURISM AND RECREATION AND ABORIGINES<br />
ALL THESE PROVIDE FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY<br />
ACTIVITIES TO BE ORGANISED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
WE DELIBERATELY HAVE MADE AND SHALL MAKE LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT A VEHICLE FOR OUR LEGISLATION ON<br />
AGED PERSONS'. HOMES AND HOSTELS, SHELTERED<br />
EMPLOYMENT, HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, MEALS ON<br />
WHEELS, HOME CARE AND NURSING, NURSING HOMES<br />
AND HOMELESS MEN AND WOMEN, THESE ARE ALL<br />
ACTIVITIES WHICH CANNOT BE CLOSELY REGULATED<br />
FROM THE CENTRE AND ARE BEST PLANNED AND<br />
IMPLEMENTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKING WITH<br />
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, THEY JUSTIFY ASSISTANCE<br />
FROM THE NATION'S FINANCES BUT NOT INCREASES<br />
IN RATES, ,/ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
" WE INSISTED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATION<br />
AT THE CONVENTION ON THE CONSTITUTION IN<br />
SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR. VIE MADE LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
REPRESENTATION A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION<br />
BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
" AT THAT CONVENTION I PUT THE CASE FOR LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATION ON THE LOAN COUNCIL.<br />
THE PREMIERS THEN, AND AT A SPECIAL PREMIERS'<br />
CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER, TURNED DOWN OUR PROPOSAL<br />
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE A VOICE AND<br />
A VOTE IN THE LOAN COUNCIL."<br />
WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW REGIONAL<br />
GROWTH CENTRES IN QUEENSLAND. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH STATE<br />
AUTHORITIES, THE CITIES COMIMISSION IN 1973 UNDERTOOK INITIAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT STUDIES OF THREE AREAS IN QUEENSLAND TOWNSVILLE,<br />
THE'FITZROY REGION AND THE MORETON REGION. OUR BUDGET LAST<br />
YEAR~ ALLOCATED $ 14.4 MILLION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE<br />
REGIONS IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR. A REQUEST FOR A<br />
DEVELOPMENT FEASIBILITY STUDY OF THE CAIRNS REGION HAS BEEN<br />
RECEIVED BY THE CITIES COMMISSION FROM THE FAR NORTH QUEENSLAND<br />
DEVELOPMENT BUREAU. THIS HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE CAIRNS<br />
CITY COUNCIL. THE COMMISSION HAS INDICATED TO THE COUNCIL<br />
AND THE BUREAU THAT IT WILL CONSIDER THIS REQUEST WHEN ITS<br />
FUTURE STUDIES PROGRAM IS BEING PREPARED. OFFICERS OF THE<br />
COMMISSION HAVE DISCUSSED THIS MATTER, AND OTHER MATTERS OF<br />
MUTUAL INTEREST, WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COUNCIL. AND THE<br />
BUREAU. 191 / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER PROJECTS I SHOULD<br />
MENTION THAT ARE OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO CAIRNS. NEW AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN CAIRNS WERE-COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 1973<br />
AT A COST OF $ 730,000. A TELEPHONE ENGINEERING CENTRE AND<br />
MOTOR VEHICLE REPAIR CENTRE ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT A<br />
COST OF $ 760,000 IN ADDITION, WE ARE CARRYING OUT<br />
EXTENSIONS TO THE CAIRNS TELEPHONE EXCHANGE AT A COST OF<br />
$ 760,000, WE. ARE BUILDING A NEW WORKS DEPOT FOR THE<br />
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION AT A COST OF $ 154,000<br />
AND EXTENDING THE LEVEE BANKS OF THE CAIRNS AIRPORT AT A<br />
COST OF $ 158,00, PROPOSED ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS TO THE<br />
CAIRNS POST OFFICE WILL COST A FURTHER $ 207,000.<br />
I WANT TO LEAVE YOU IN NO DOUBT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
CONTINUING CONCERN FOR THE PROSPERITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR<br />
CITY, YOUR REGION AND YOUR STATE. WITH THIS BUILDING,<br />
CAIRNS HAS PLACED ITSELF IN THE FOREFRONT OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT<br />
FOR THE ARTS. IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO DECLARE OPEN<br />
THE FIRST STAGE OF YOUR CULTURAL COMPLEX. IT WILL GIVE ME<br />
GREATER AND CONTINUING PLEASURE TO REVISIT YOUR CITY, TO<br />
OBSERVE ITS GROWTH AND PROSPERITY, AND SEE THE IMPORTANT<br />
CONTRIBUTION OF THIS NEW CIVIC CENTRE TO THE LIFE AND<br />
HAPPINESS OF YOUR CITIZENS, </p>
