PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 AUGUST 1991<br />
The Government has decided today to establish full<br />
diplomatic relations with the Baltic States of Estonia,<br />
Latvia and Lithuania.<br />
Australia is proud to be among the first nations to take<br />
this step.<br />
This fulfils the long-held dream of the many Baltic people<br />
who have made their homes in Australia, and who have made<br />
such a magnificent contribution to our national life in many<br />
fields.<br />
Australia did not recognise the incorporation of the Baltic<br />
States into the Soviet Union in 1940, but we had until today<br />
accepted the reality of Soviet de facto control over their<br />
affairs. Now, with the events of the past week, the Baltic States<br />
have regained effective control over their own affairs for<br />
the first time since 1940. In our judgment, each of the<br />
Baltic States has now established sufficient control over<br />
its own defined territory, and is sufficiently well placed<br />
to enter into diplomatic relations with other States, to<br />
satisfy the internationally accepted criteria for<br />
independent statehood.<br />
We look forward to building closer relations and stronger<br />
cooperation with the Baltic States. The Australian<br />
Government will seek to accredit our Ambassador in<br />
Copenhagen to Lithuania and Latvia, and our Ambassador in<br />
Stockholm to Estonia. We will move immediately to discuss<br />
the necessary practical arrangements with the Baltic<br />
Governments. 981 I-<br />
