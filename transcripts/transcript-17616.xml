    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I want to begin by acknowledging two great Australians, Gough and Margaret Whitlam. The Chinese community  -  and the People's Republic  -  have no truer friends and I know Gough and Margaret are with us in spirit tonight.</p>
<p>I am a migrant.</p>
<p>I came here on a long journey with my family in search of a better life.</p>
<p>I found that better life  -  better than I could ever have imagined: a great education; a great job; and a humbling opportunity to serve our nation in public life.</p>
<p>But more than these things:</p>
<p>I found a home.</p>
<p>A place to belong.</p>
<p>A place to dig deep roots.</p>
<p>A place to bond with and people to bond to with.</p>
<p>To me that is the meaning of Australia Day.</p>
<p>Acceptance.</p>
<p>Commitment.</p>
<p>Mateship.</p>
<p>Belonging. </p>
<p>And in the history of this nation, few have such a sense of belonging as the Australian Chinese community.</p>
<p>We don't know the name of the first Chinese migrant to come to this land; what he did or when he died.</p>
<p>But we know for certain that from the 1820s onwards, the Chinese have been a proud part of this nation and the story of its building.</p>
<p>The Chinese were there in the long decades of striving and struggle:</p>
<p>On the farms and the gold fields.</p>
<p>The docks and the warehouses and the workshops.</p>
<p>The story is told in records and artefacts.</p>
<p>In temples and churches and stores that survive.</p>
<p>And in the Chinese headstones to be found in cemeteries across inland Australia.</p>
<p>There's even a bookmaker's ledger in Launceston showing Melbourne Cup bets written entirely in Chinese.</p>
<p>But friends,</p>
<p>We know the story most directly from the families who have treasured their Chinese identity down the generations, while retaining a fierce and abiding loyalty to this country.</p>
<p>The journey was not always easy.</p>
<p>As we know from the current floods and the recent drought, this country can be harsh and unforgiving.</p>
<p>It took remarkable courage to travel from a different culture and build a new future in a strange land.</p>
<p>For some, it was too hard.</p>
<p>I was touched by the story of Kwan Hong Kee, a businessman who came to Australia from China in 1885.</p>
<p>Despite high hopes, his career was beset by frustration and failure.</p>
<p>But just before he passed away, he wrote a memoir for his children and it is a work of great wisdom and deep humility.</p>
<p>At the end of the book, looking back over his life, he had this to say:</p>
<p>If you have good fortune, do not be proud, and if you have misfortune, do not be downhearted. Be diligent, and thrifty.</p>
<p>Look forward with courage. Do your best.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in my home town of Adelaide, in my own words, I called on our nation to look forward with courage as we overcome adversity.  I called on the nation to make this Australia a celebration of and rededication to the great Australian values of mateship and a fair go.  To Australians, who have joined hands in such tough times, my message is âdon't let go'.</p>
<p>Here, tonight, I acknowledge that across our history the larrikin embrace of this nation was not always extended to the Chinese community.</p>
<p>But you never lost faith in the nation.</p>
<p>So much so that the Chinese community welcomed the advent of Federation with open arms, and sent one of its finest sons to Gallipoli, Billy Sing.</p>
<p>Culture, language, background  -  none of these determine our right to belong.</p>
<p>If you love this country, embrace its values and work hard for its future, you are Australian.</p>
<p>There is no other test.</p>
<p>There is no other bar.</p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>As we approach two centuries of Chinese settlement in Australia, we do so with pride and with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Today, the equalitarian embrace of this nation does extend to the Chinese community and we won't let go.</p>
<p>Instead, today, we warmly celebrate the Chinese community's growth in size and in influence: a population approaching 700,000; a sophisticated range of community services; and extraordinary success in the professions, the arts, media, sport, politics and academia.</p>
<p>It has been an incredible journey  -  a journey made all the more significant by Australia's renewed engagement with China, pioneered by Gough Whitlam in 1972 and nurtured by every Prime Minister  -  Labor and Coalition  -  in the four decades since.</p>
<p>My commitment to the Australia-China relationship is enduring and strong.</p>
<p>I welcome Ambassador Chen to his new post.</p>
<p>And look forward to visiting China in the months ahead.</p>
<p>I will do so conscious that this is a decisive decade for China and her place in the world.</p>
<p>Australia welcomes the emergence of China as the world's second-largest economy, and as an important partner in dealing with challenges such as global financial reform, climate change, poverty, food and energy supplies, world trade and regional security.</p>
<p>We are proud to be partners in her journey of progress and prosperity.</p>
<p>Central to that partnership is you  -  the Australian Chinese community  -  who form a special bridge of friendship and understanding.</p>
<p>For two centuries, you have been at the heart of the Australian story.</p>
<p>And so it is truly fitting that Chinese New Year and Australia Day fall so close together. Our celebrations and our stories belong together.</p>
<p>As this lunar New Year begins, I honour the Australian Chinese community and say thank you.</p>
<p>And to those born in the Year of the Rabbit, I offer my special good wishes.</p>
<p>Those born under the sign of the Rabbit are said to be articulate, talented and ambitious.</p>
<p>I was born in the Year of the Ox and we oxen, in turn, are said to be steadfast, confident and determined.</p>
<p>I am indeed determined.</p>
<p>Determined that in this year ahead, we will face the nation's challenges with courage and resolution together.</p>
<p>Restoring the cities and towns hit by floods.</p>
<p>Harnessing our economy's strength to build a society with fairness and opportunity for all.  Ensuring demography is not destiny.</p>
<p>And friends,</p>
<p>We will succeed.</p>
<p>We'll succeed together.  We'll stay together.  We won't let go.</p>
<p>Joined by mateship, driven to deliver a fair go to all, we will be proud of our history even as we build a better and fairer future.</p>
<p>Our best days are yet to come. </p>
