    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce the Governmentâs support for the Santos School of Petroleum Engineering at the University of Adelaide.</p>
<p>The establishment of the School has been made possible by an exceptionally generous</p>
<p>$25 million sponsorship from Santos Ltd, one of Australiaâs leading petroleum exploration and production companies. It will also involve a significant partnership with the University of Adelaide, a prominent centre for engineering research and teaching.</p>
<p>In recognition of this important development, the Government will provide $1 million over five years to fund a new professorial Chair, to be known as the Ross Adler Chair in Petroleum Engineering.</p>
<p>This joint venture holds great potential for successful innovation, promoting opportunities for Australia to become a âcan doâ country, capable of converting Australian endowments and ideas into Australian jobs, rather than jobs overseas.</p>
<p>I am confident that the School will make a strong contribution to the field of petroleum engineering, an area of strategic importance to Australiaâs economic development.</p>
<p>I commend Santos for this generous philanthropic gesture. The companyâs involvement with the University of Adelaide is a fine example of the social coalition at work, responding to the challenges and opportunities we face as a nation. Santos has made a far-sighted investment in Australiaâs knowledge and skills base, and the establishment of the School reflects the interests universities and business share in the pursuit of world-class research and high quality professional training.</p>
<p>The Government is working to encourage greater collaboration between industry and universities. The Governmentâs Discussion Paper on reform of higher education research, <i>New Knowledge, New Opportunities</i>, which was released in June, proposes to give universities much stronger incentives to develop industry links of this kind.</p>
<p>I congratulate Santos Ltd and the University of Adelaide on this initiative, and wish the School every success.</p>
