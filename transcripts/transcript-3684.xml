PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 487<br />
7 April 1975<br />
Second Orphan Flight<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today<br />
announced details of a second Australian charter flight<br />
to bring Vietnamese children to Australia.<br />
He said that a Qantas Boeing 747 aircraft,<br />
chartered by the Australian Government, would leave Sydney<br />
at 2 pm today to fly to Bangkok.<br />
On board will be a large team of medical<br />
personnel, who will be flown from Bangkok to Saigon<br />
by RAAF aircraft to accompany the children back to Bangkok<br />
to join the Qantas flight. The Qantas flight is expected<br />
to return to Melbourne on Wednesday.<br />
The medical personnel will include 40 nurses,<br />
three pediatricians, two general practitioners, officers<br />
from the Department of Health and senior officials from<br />
the Departments of Labor and Immigration and Social<br />
Security,, The Qantas charter aircraft will be fully<br />
loaded with about 27 tonnes of relief supplies for Vietnam.<br />
This will include five tonnes of clothing, children's foods<br />
and medicines which have been provided by Australian<br />
voluntary agencies for the Rosmary Taylor Orphanage in Saigon.<br />
There will also be $ 65,000 worth of drugs and other<br />
medicines from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and<br />
milk power. The Prime Minister said that it was not yet<br />
certain how many children would return to Australia on<br />
the Qantas charter. The final number would be advised<br />
later, following advice from the Australian Embassy in<br />
Saigon.<br />
