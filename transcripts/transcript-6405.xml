PRIME MINISTER: TABLING STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT POLICY<br />
DISCUSSION PAPER ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 5 JUNE 1984<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
For the information of Honourable Members I present the<br />
Government Policy Discussion Paper on Affirmative Action for<br />
Women and seek leave to make a statement.<br />
With this release of its Policy Discussion Paper on<br />
affirmative action in employment, the Gove~ rnment has moved<br />
to implement one of its major commitments to raising the<br />
status of women in Australian society.<br />
This is a commitment on which many in our community expect<br />
fearless, clear and effective leadership from the<br />
Government. As I said in the Boyer lectures,<br />
" in the area of the status of women,<br />
the formal process of accepting their<br />
equality as human beings has not been<br />
matched by the hard political and<br />
administrative decisions necessary to<br />
give effect to that acceptance."<br />
The Australian Labor Government is determined to rectify<br />
this situation by making those decisions. The Government<br />
has already taken such major steps as the enactment of sex<br />
discrimination legislation, the appointment of more than<br />
women to Government boards and authorities and, now, the<br />
introduction of an affirmative action program.<br />
We are committed to the development of policies which will<br />
give women the opportunity to participate fully in<br />
employment. We are committed to policies to ensure that<br />
women are given the opportunity to improve their labour<br />
market prospects, to compete for a wider range of jobs and<br />
to be able to apply on an equal footing with men for those<br />
jobs that are available. </p>
<p>The approach we now propose should ensure that women are no<br />
longer excluded from many occupations and concentrated at<br />
the bottom of the labour market. Women should now assume<br />
the place of their choice in our society. I should emphasise<br />
that this, we appreciate and recognise, will see many<br />
choosing a traditional role in the home.<br />
Affirmative action of the kind now proposed by the<br />
Government is a means of improving women'. s position in the<br />
workforce by ensuring that discriminatory practices or<br />
traditions are reviewed and removed. We aim to see that<br />
women are enabled to compete equally with men for jobs at<br />
all levels.<br />
Our approach is not one which relies on the experience of<br />
other countries. We have explicitly rejected<br />
the American model with its system of court-imposed<br />
employment quotas. Rather we have developed a set of<br />
proposals which are appropriate for the Australian<br />
environment. They are the product of our unique industrial<br />
relations and business practice traditions.<br />
Put quite simply, equal emoloyment opportunity is our<br />
objective, and affirmative action is the way to achieve it.<br />
We must shake ourselves from the inertia and complacency<br />
which for too long has charicterised Australian policy on<br />
matters such as this. What I said in the Boyer lectures in<br />
1979 remains true today iamely that:<br />
We luxuriate in the comfortable assertion that<br />
women enjoy equality. We have salved our<br />
consciences by eliminating the more obvious<br />
discriminations like unequal rates of pay for work<br />
of equal value. But we have not eliminated the<br />
inheritance of the millenia that women are lesser<br />
beings, an inheritance which still manifests itself<br />
in a whole range of prejudice and other forms of<br />
discrimination. We are, as a society, more aware<br />
of this dichotomy, between principle and practice,<br />
but the very awareness is a source of guilt and<br />
conflict between women and women, between women and<br />
men, and within women and men themselves."<br />
I see it as crucial that we confront this dichotomy head on.<br />
It is not enough simply to say that there should be equal<br />
employment opportunities for women or that all employers<br />
should treat men and women equally. What we need is<br />
concerted action affirmative action to ensure its<br />
achigvement. Special measures and programs are needed to ensure that<br />
women acquire the skills, experience and training to compete<br />
on an equal basis with men for jobs and for promotions. </p>
<p>Such special measures include making it explicit in job<br />
advertisements that women and girl~ s can apply, companies<br />
advising their employees that all positions are open to<br />
women, companies analysing their workforce to identify areas<br />
where women are not employed and designing strategies to<br />
attract them to these areas, and companies consulting with<br />
female employees on their perceptions of where barriers to<br />
full equality of opportunity might exist.<br />
Some companies will already have adopted such measures.<br />
These are, after all, what many would see as being integral<br />
to good management practice. Successful companies will not<br />
ignore the talents and skills of all their employees. Such<br />
practices should become the rule rather than the exception.<br />
Women are now 37,1 of the Australian workforce. Two and a<br />
half million women, 60 per cent of them married, are in the<br />
workforce. The economy and standards of living we know<br />
today would collapse if women were t o withdraw to their<br />
pre-war rate of labour market participation.<br />
Women today do not have the same diversity of occupational<br />
choices available to men. Sixty four per cent of women<br />
workers are employed in only three occuDational groups:<br />
clerical; sales and service sport and recreation. Women in<br />
these occupations work largely as stenographers, typists,<br />
sales assistants, waitresses and cleaners.<br />
Women are under-represented in administrative, executive and<br />
managerial positions, in agricultural work and in the<br />
trainsport and communication occupations. They are notably<br />
under-represented in the trades, production-process and<br />
labouring occupational groupings.<br />
Even within occupations where women predominate, men tend to<br />
have the higher-level, decision-making positions.<br />
Indeed, among OECD countries, Australia has the highest<br />
level of occupational segregation of women and one of the<br />
highest levels of industrial segregation.<br />
There is no evidence of this segregation diminishing.<br />
Rather, as I observed in the 1979 lectures,<br />
" The range of employment readily open to women is<br />
restricted because of discrimination built into our<br />
education system and the attitudas of some<br />
employers and trade unions. There is still the<br />
unstated but operative assumption that women are<br />
not entitled to equal opportunity because their<br />
place is, or ultimately should be, in the home." </p>
<p>In the final analysis, what we have to recognise is that<br />
while there is an inevitable imbalance in circumstances<br />
where a significant number of women chose not to enter the<br />
workforce there is still, as I observed in the B~ oyer<br />
Lectures, a gross lack of proportion. We have a situation<br />
where women comprise half the population and yet still<br />
occupy so few positions of authority in government,<br />
business, trade unions, and other organisations of<br />
significance within the community.<br />
The Government's affirmative action proposals aim to redress<br />
this situation. We aim to open up a greater and more<br />
satisfying range of job opportunities for women.<br />
The union movement has a very important role to play in<br />
securing these objectives. The ACTU Congress' decision to<br />
hold a seminar for all affiliates should help see the unions<br />
make their essential contribution.<br />
But it is the co-operation of Australian employers which<br />
will be absolutely vital for the long-term success of an<br />
affirmative action program. In this regard the Government<br />
has sought and received the cooperation of' many Australian<br />
companies and of the higher education inst itutions. This<br />
co-operation augurs well for the prospects of the approach<br />
we are now proposing and we are oarticularly grateful to all<br />
those concerned for their co-operation.<br />
Following my invitation, the following companies and<br />
tertiary institutions have agreed to join a pilot orogram<br />
establishing affirmative action for women in employment:<br />
Australian Mutual Provident Society<br />
Ansett Transport Industries Ltd.<br />
ANZ Banking Group Limited<br />
Boral Ltd.<br />
Borg-Warner ( Australia) Limited<br />
The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited<br />
Castlemaine Tooheys Limited<br />
G. J. Coles N Coy. Limited<br />
Argyle Diamond Mines Pty Limited and Sulphide<br />
Corporation Pty Limited divisions of CRA Limited<br />
CSR Limited<br />
Dunlop Olympic Limited<br />
Esso Australia Limited<br />
John Fairfax Sons Limited<br />
Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited<br />
Grace Bros. Department Stores<br />
IBM Australia Limited<br />
ICI Australia Limited<br />
Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd.<br />
Reckitt Colman Australia Limited<br />
Santos Ltd.<br />

South Pacific Hotel Corporation Limited </p>
<p>Thomas Nationwide Transport Limited<br />
Unilever Australia Limited<br />
Westpac Banking Corporation<br />
Woolwortts Limited<br />
Wormald International Limited<br />
J. B. Young Limited<br />
The Australian National University<br />
Griffith University<br />
South Australian College of Advanced Education<br />
The pilot orogram is a unique and historic challenge. The<br />
participation by such a representative cross section of our<br />
business and education communities gives me confidence not<br />
only of the likely success of the program, but of the<br />
seminal influence it will have on community attitudes in<br />
this vital area.<br />
Between them, the participants in the pilot program employ<br />
almost a quarter of a million Australians. 16 of the 28<br />
companies which are participating in the program are listed<br />
by Business Review Weekly as being amongst Australia's top<br />
150 companies in terms of their market capitalisation. Six<br />
of the participating companies are amongst Australia's top<br />
ten companies. Quite deliberately, however, the pilot<br />
program is not confined to such companies; it necessarily<br />
encompasses a wide range of sectors and regions and a<br />
variety of company sizes. On this basis the demonstration<br />
effect of the pilit program should be both considerable and,<br />
above all, credib e.<br />
I am very confident that the practical attainment of<br />
improved employment opportunities for women through the<br />
pilot program will dispel any lingering misapprehensions<br />
about the appropriateness of affirmative action as a<br />
strategy for improving women's job opportunities.<br />
A special Affirmative Action Resource Unit has been<br />
established in the Office of the Status of Women to assist<br />
participants in the pilot program. It will help employers<br />
design Affirmative Action Programs and will provide advice<br />
when problems arise. It will also assist employers in<br />
monitoring the progress of their programs.<br />
In this regard I should like to pay tribute to the clarity<br />
and sensitivity of approach adopted by many in Australian<br />
business and industry to the challenge involved in mounting<br />
affirmative action programs. </p>
<p>This is reflected, for example, in the attitude of the<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry which has acknowledged<br />
t ha t " Industry, as a part of society, cannot escape the<br />
fact that it has a role t~ o play In the main,<br />
real and positive advances will only be made in<br />
this area through coordinated and cooperative<br />
action by industry, the trade union movement and<br />
governments... Affirmative action programmes<br />
carried out on ( this) basis have the full support<br />
of CAI."<br />
The Business Council of Australia, to which most of the<br />
companies participating in the pilot program belong, is also<br />
holding a series of working sessions throughout the year for<br />
participating companies. This initiative is a practical<br />
approach which should be of particular value to all the<br />
companies concerned.<br />
That so many in business are both receptive to the purpose<br />
of affirmative action and prepared to give' it practical<br />
effect in their own enterprises, g~ ives me real confidence<br />
that we have found a most effective means of securing real<br />
progress in this vitally important area.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The Paper before us defines affirmative action as a<br />
systematic means, determined by employers in consultation<br />
with employees and unions, of achieving equal employment<br />
opportunity for women. It is not a means of generating<br />
increased employment other policies are directed to this<br />
end. Affirmative action is aimed at oromoting improved job choice<br />
for women in the work force. In this regard the Government<br />
strongly believes that all jobs should be awarded on merit.<br />
We reject the use of employment quotas for women or any<br />
disadvantaged group. What is needed is a self-determined,<br />
industry-specific* approach. Such an approach would be one<br />
which would adopt goals or targets rather than binding,<br />
operational quotas.<br />
Affirmative action Programs will only achieve long-term<br />
benefits, for women and for the economy, if they are<br />
regarded as employment policies designed to improve the<br />
skill, efficiency and mobility of the workforce. They<br />
should be designed to redress discrimination where it occurs<br />
within organisations, to identify obstacles to women's<br />
employment or promotion, and to take systematic steps to<br />
remove these. </p>
<p>Affirmative action does not threaten the jobs of men.<br />
Rather it ensures equitable treatment for individual<br />
employees, and urges employers to make optimal use of all<br />
skills and talents available both inside and outside the<br />
organisation. We cannot afford the situation any longer Situations where<br />
women remain concentrated at the bottom on the labour<br />
market; where women continue to receive a<br />
disproportionately low share of' wages and salaries; and<br />
where their access to non-traditional occupations will not<br />
improve. Only if we utilise all available skills and resources will<br />
we have any hope of enhancing, indeed maint. aining, our<br />
relative standard of living.<br />
Australia needs to establish a more efficient, more<br />
productive and, ultimately, more competitive industrial<br />
base. Our labour market, industrial relations and education<br />
policies should contribute to the process. A labour force<br />
which is low-skilled, immobile and occupationally stultified<br />
will only impede our progress. The Affirmative Action<br />
proposals now before the House will have an important place<br />
in achieving the necessary conditions for progress.<br />
They are part of a wider effort by the Government to improve<br />
the educational, training and employment prospects for women<br />
and girls.<br />
We are giving particular attention to the achievement of<br />
equal access to jobs for women and men under the Community<br />
Employment Program Job Creation Scheme; we have introduced<br />
special rebates under the CRAFT scheme for employers who<br />
take on female apprentices in trades other than<br />
hairdressing; we have commenced information campaigns to<br />
encourage young women to train for non-traditional<br />
occupations; we have also introduced the Participation and<br />
Equity Program and the Computer Education Program within the<br />
educational system both of which should be a particular<br />
assistance to girls in their later quest for jobs.<br />
While each employer is now being asked to design affirmative<br />
action programs suitable for the conditions and traditions<br />
of the industry concerned, most affirmative action programs<br />
should, nevertheless, have certain common features. These<br />
include: the appointment within each organisation of a<br />
senior executive responsible for the implementation of the<br />
program; an analysis of their workforce to identify areas<br />
where women are concentrated or under-represented; a review<br />
of the organisation's employment policies and practices; the<br />
formulation of specific goals or targets to remedy any<br />
shortcomings disclosed by this analysibs and review; and an<br />
evaluation and monitoring component to enable the<br />
organisation to assess whether it is making demonstrable<br />
progress to equal employment opportunity for women. </p>
<p>There is nothing particula~ rly difficult or costly about any<br />
of these steps. I would urge all employers to consider the<br />
benefits involved most careful ly.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The Government proposes that legislation Should ultimately<br />
be introduced covering the introduction of affirmative<br />
action programs for women employees in private sector<br />
organisat ions.<br />
Such legislation needs to be carefully evolved for the<br />
Australian context. It needs to be implemented in a way<br />
which is not disruptive to business and the other<br />
organisations it will affect. It should also be such as not<br />
to prejudice women's long-term employment prospects.<br />
In order to make sure that affirmative action legislation<br />
achieves these goals and has broad business, union and<br />
community support, the Government proposes to follow the<br />
successful consultation mechanism developed to consider the<br />
legislation for the Prices Surveillance Authority.<br />
With this in mind, I 3m also pleased to announce today that<br />
a Working Party is to be established to advise the<br />
Government on the most appropriate form of legislation in<br />
respect of affirmative action. This Working Party will be a<br />
direct and formal link between the Government and the<br />
parties affected by the Affirmative Action proposals. it<br />
will be kept informed of progress of the pilot program and<br />
will draw on its experience in framing the options for<br />
legislation. The Working Party is to be chaired by Senator Ryan<br />
representing me in her capacity as Minister Assisting the<br />
Prime Minister on the Status of Women.<br />
The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr<br />
Willis, and the Attorney-General, Senator Evans, will also<br />
participate in the Working Party as will representatives of<br />
the ACTU, the Business Council of Australia, the<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian<br />
Vice-Chancellor's Committee, the Australian Committee of'<br />
Directors and Principals of Colleges of Advanced Education<br />
and women's organisations.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The Government hopes that all large employers not only<br />
those taking part in the pilot program will start to move<br />
towards adopting affirmative action programs for their women<br />
employees prior to the report of the Working Party. I am<br />
most heartened by the interest shown already by a number of<br />
organisations, educational institutions and statutory<br />
authorities and applaud them for their initiative in this<br />
important area. </p>
<p>The Government will, or course, also provide as much<br />
assistance as possible to these organisations through the<br />
Affirmative Action Resource Unit.<br />
The Government, it will be appreciated, is not applying one<br />
standard to the private sector and another to its own<br />
employees in the public sector.<br />
The Public Service Reform Bill introduced into this House on<br />
May 1984 by John Dawkins as Minister Assisting me on<br />
Public Service Matters, contains provisions requiring<br />
Commonwealth Departments to introduce affirmative action<br />
programs for women and disadvantaged minority groups. This<br />
legislation will also apply to Commonwealth Statutory<br />
authorities on a case by case basis. I would hope the<br />
example set by the Government will provide an incentive for<br />
many others to follow suit.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The proposals in this paper have been widely discussed<br />
between the Government, business, and unions. I repeat how<br />
grateful my Government is for the very substantial support<br />
we have already received from these quarters. This<br />
demonstrates, I believe that all parties affected by the<br />
Government's proposals will see them as realistic and<br />
practical, and in their interests to implement.<br />
For far too long, women have been denied their right to<br />
compete on equal terms with men for jobs or to have<br />
reasonable prospects within those jobs. The Government's<br />
objective is to redress this situation so that women's<br />
position and status in the labour market markedly improves.<br />
We are, in this important area, I believe, on the threshold<br />
of a major transformation of the place of women in our<br />
society. Australia will be a better and more prosperous place for it. </p>
