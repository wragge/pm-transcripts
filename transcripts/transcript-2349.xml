Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference 1971<br />
" COIV'. OiPWLALTH IN T11-1' 7' EVE3' TrIES AND CoMIIYoir'JEALTH DECLARATIOil<br />
Ãµ p4eech by~ the Prime Minister,. Mr. John Gorton<br />
Before I actually discuss the Commonwealth in the Seventies and President<br />
Kaunda's Declaration which is intimately bound up with the Commonwealth in the<br />
Seventies, there is one thing which I think it is rather appropriate to say.<br />
I think it was Mr. Forbes Burnham who in his set speech earlier in this<br />
conference jokingly remarked on whether Great Britain went by the name of Britain<br />
or went by the name of the United Kingdom, which is sometimes confused, and he<br />
thought it might have something to do with the place around the table at which the<br />
representatives from that nation sat. I think perhaps I might add to this.<br />
It is really quite immaterial which place at the table the representatives<br />
of Britain occupy, because if it were not for Britain there wiould be no table at all for<br />
anyone to sit around. We are all of us former colonies and we were, all of us, governed<br />
by former Governments in Great Britain. We all achieved independence sometimes<br />
given more reluctantly than at others but we all achieved independence. And having<br />
received it, we were able to form an association which I thinky no former colonial<br />
power -would have been able to form with those whom it had previously governed.<br />
And as we look forward to the seventies, and as we look forward to what the<br />
Commonwealth may do or may not do in those years ahead, we may perhaps spare<br />
just one brief moment to look back with some appreciation of the acts which made the<br />
Commonwealth possible.<br />
There is undoubtedly going to be in this new decade further problems with<br />
which the Commonwealth must concern itself in all areas. And it is because we are<br />
at the beginning of a new decade that I thought it was appropriate for President Kaunda<br />
to set down, as he did, statements as to what the Commonwealth was, how the<br />
Commonwealth can operate, and what the Commonwealth saw as the major problems<br />
facing it in this coming decade of the seventies. And I was therefore able to support<br />
fully in principle the unusual course that such a declaration z-hould be made by this<br />
Conference. But I would like first to express Australia's opinion of what the Commonwealth<br />
is and as to how we think it should operate.<br />
It is, as the proposed Declaration quite clearly says, " a voluntary association<br />
of independent sovereign States" and it comes from the six continents and the five<br />
oceans and it has certain positions in common and certain aims in common. It may<br />
be that in the achievement of those aims and in the working o: Z the Commonwealth as<br />
it meets together, there may be required to be changes of some kind in the way it<br />
operates in future. </p>
<p>But 1 believe that in other cases it is vital that there should not be changes<br />
but there should be retention of the way in which the Commonwealth has operated in<br />
the past. In that way the nations Of the Commonwealth come together to exchange views,<br />
to listen to the point of view of those who come from other nations, to get to know<br />
individuals which is of quite some importance. But it never operates in the contejt<br />
that there should be decisions made by Commonwealth members that are binding on<br />
any single member of the Commonwealth, and it never operates on the concept<br />
that a general consensus of view should be in any way binding or taken seriously<br />
and acted upon by any constituent member who does not share in that consensus.<br />
I believe, Mr. Chairman, and I wish it to be clearly stated in the record,<br />
that Australia believes that that principle must be retained. It is utterly essential<br />
that there should be no attempt, conscious or unconscious, to turn the Commonwealth<br />
into a mini-United Nations. Because as I see it, if that course is followed, then the<br />
Commonweal th itself will tend to disintegrate. It cannot be a gathering of people<br />
seeking to impose views on any single member.<br />
And that goes for all those sitting around this table. Certainly that is the<br />
concept that Australia has of the role of the Commonwealth. Those are the ideals,<br />
those are the concepts which we seek in the Commonwealth, and I would like all to<br />
be aware of that.<br />
VWe ourselves do not, and will not, seek to impose our point of view on<br />
anything on anyone else. Similarly, we will not accept the concept that there could<br />
be an imposition on us of a point of view with which we do niot agree.<br />
And so that, Sir, is whAt I would hope the Commonwealth would continue<br />
to be in the Seventies a voluntary association of independent sovereign states, each<br />
state retaining complete independence, no state, either alone or in conjunction with<br />
others, seeking t o try to make decisions binding on any other member of the<br />
Commonwealth. I think, perhaps, that it is not altogether a good development that we have<br />
been so concerned with seeking to get forms of words which can meet with general<br />
agreement. The end result of that is very often there is a form of words to which<br />
everybody says they subscribe and views which everybody says they hold, but a form<br />
of words which in fact does not fully set out completely the views of anybody. And<br />
I think it is much better for the Commonwealth to operate i future without worrying<br />
about different views being expressed. / 3 </p>
<p>For our part, we would be perfectly happy to be the only nation sitting around<br />
this table who disagreed with what everybody else wanted to do or say. And we would<br />
think none the worse at all off any other nation should they alone differ from the viewis<br />
of others. This, of course, is an extreme example, but it ic~ put to underline v-hat<br />
I believe to be the principles on which the Commonwealth should operate as it approaches<br />
the . problems of the seventies. Those problems have in my view, very properly been<br />
isolated in President Kaunda's Declaration. I would like to see them stated as: problems<br />
with which the Commonwealth must concern itself and not go any further in indicating<br />
how the Commonwealth or members of it should concern themselves with overcoming<br />
thlem. But there is a value to my mind at this stage, at the beginning of this decade,<br />
in saying what the problems are and, in the old traditions of the Commonwealth,<br />
exchanging our views on those problems and the methods which might be adopted to<br />
tackle them. In the Declaration we have before us, which deal-c with the Common., wealth<br />
in the Seventies and I think the study of that and the Declaration are indivisible<br />
there is properly first set down the need to maintain peace i the prosperity of all<br />
Commonwealth nations is to proceed without interruption. There could be few, if any,<br />
who would deny that this was a major task, and that this was something which vitally<br />
concerns us all.<br />
I don't myself believe that peace is threatened, others generally do, by<br />
a difference in wealth between one country and another. That may exacerbate tensions,<br />
but I do not believe that that is a maj or threat. Rather I tMA that the threat comes<br />
from conflicting ideologies, and that, I would suggest, mighnt be recognised by all as<br />
the major cause threatening the continuance of world peace. It was not a difference<br />
in living standards which led to North Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. It wias not a<br />
difference in living standards which led to Laos being subject to military aggressioni.<br />
It was a difference in ideology.<br />
I would have liked this Declaration to contain within it the words that " the<br />
Commonwealth condemns any armed attack made by any nation upon any other nation."<br />
I cannot myself see why there should be any objection to that. If peace is to be<br />
maintained, and there is a basic need to maintain it, there Should not be aggression by<br />
any nat ion upon another, and more particularly perhaps there should not be any<br />
aggression upon any small state.<br />
It is quite properly stated later in this Declaration that the independence of<br />
all the countries sitting around this table is of concern to all others. Any armed<br />
attack made on any small state anywhere puts in jeopardy all small states everywhere.<br />
I hope a recognition of that might be a contribution towards the maintenance of that<br />
peace which President Kaunda so rightly put at the head of his Declaration. A </p>
<p>The other problems which we must meet, the ones we all have, include<br />
the question of providing international aid to countries which are developing but<br />
still have much scope for development. May 1, for emphasis, say in regard to that,<br />
that, comparatively, Australia is a rich country. Comparatively, if one takces other<br />
comparisons, it is not a rich country. I don't feel that we are doing any injustice<br />
to anybody by being a comparatively well-off country. We have been lucky we<br />
Work hard. But I don't think that is doing any injustice to anyone, and I am glad<br />
to see that that phrase does not, as I understand it, appear in the declaration now.<br />
That is not to say that there is not a need for those who are better off to<br />
assist those who are not so well off, and that is not to say that it is not to the self<br />
interest of those who are better off to try to assist those who are still growing.<br />
I do not see-the aim of international aid as being a handout, rather must it be a<br />
well thought-out attempt to provide to those nations who are in need of further<br />
development the capacity for that development, to provide the capital -for a<br />
particular project, for industrialisation, for improving agriculture, for providing<br />
the means by which such countries can assist themselves. And certainly, as-the<br />
Chairman of this Conference so cogently remarked several days ago, no nation<br />
is its brother's keeper. It isn't. But it must be its brother's helper; it can help<br />
its brother to help himself. And in that way there can be no obligation. Obligationo<br />
are nasty things. So I would say, in approaching the problem of aid, what is needed is a<br />
clear understanding that what is done in this field is done to provide the capability<br />
and the capital to the nations who are developing so they can raise themselves to an<br />
economic position where they will no longer need such help. This will take some<br />
time but this is the basis of the approach to this problem.<br />
I would add one thing to my remarks on aid. This is provided, and I<br />
hope it will continue to be provided, and we are playing our part in international<br />
aid, but let us all listen to those other words of the Chairman of this Conference.<br />
That is that while it is necessary to assist the growth, to assist the people of<br />
developing countries to help themselves throughout the world, there can be no<br />
obligation to do this indefinitely if every advance so made is swallowed up by an<br />
increase in the population of the countries being helped. This is a matter under<br />
the control of the countries concerned and this is of as vital interest to the real<br />
economic growth of the countries as is the amount of aid of one kind or another<br />
that is provided. Those statements in themselves are not enough to deal with this second<br />
point which President Kaunda made. Supposing this is done, supposing nations are<br />
helped to industrialise, are helped to increase production of various kinds so that<br />
internally perhaps the standards of living may rise. Yet that will not be enough<br />
unless we can somehow devise outlets in other countries for the products which<br />
are produced as the result of such industrialisation. The two mtters go </p>
<p>absolutely hand in hand, and -the.-two matters are ones. with which the Commonwealth<br />
should concern itself, with which vie-. axe bappy to concern ourselves. The solutions<br />
are not easy because there are vested interests to stop the filow of manufactured goods<br />
not only from less developed countries but even from such countries as Australia.<br />
These will need to be matters which we must seek to overcome in the sever-ties" and<br />
proper matters to which we might direct our attention.<br />
Another matter in this Declaration which I believe to be of great moment Li<br />
the Seventies is the question of feeling between different races. It is of no use, I<br />
think, pretending that in general there are not, in many countries at any rate, racial<br />
feelings between people with different coloured skins. There ought not to be but there<br />
is, and we must start from that premise. Let us try and do one thing that is-. reasonably<br />
easy, and that is that each one of us say as I am prepared to say and mean that<br />
we will, within our own country, abolish all governmental discrimination of any kcind.<br />
That we can do, that each nation here can do, and that each nation here has not yet<br />
completely done. If we could do that, and I1a m prepared to do it I will do it anyw~ ay<br />
that would be one advance. But not enough, because that after all is onlyjr governmental<br />
discrimination and there would still remain the areas in which governmental<br />
discrimination was not a factor.<br />
And can we perhaps seek to diagnose this illness of racialism? For only by<br />
proper diagnosis can a proper cure be worked out. I think there is not a feeling<br />
between countries when those countries contain people of different races. There is<br />
not, I hope, a feeling against Australia by Zambia, and certainly no feeling against<br />
Zambia by Australia. I don't believe that the people of any nation feel objections to<br />
other nations on social grou nds. That would be my first attempt at a diagnosis of<br />
the problem. But we see that within nations this problem is hard to eradicate and it is<br />
hardest to eradicate if in any nation there is a large proportion of people with a<br />
different skin colour from others. That is why, I think, we see more evidence of<br />
racial feeling coming to the surface in a country where such a situation exists.<br />
If that is so, how is that overcome? Well, a beginning, I think could be<br />
made, by making sure that, if there are in any countries large groups of people ofdifferent<br />
race, there is not, to reinforce that racial feeling, economic differences<br />
affecting any particular race. Such differences reinforce any racial feeling that<br />
there may be, and we must give our attention to that.<br />
And, secondly, we should try to see, all of us, in such ways that we can,<br />
that in the circumstances I have outlined, there should not be a reinforcing GIf racial<br />
feeling by religious feeling because that again reinforces and makes it difficult<br />
for this whole problem to be overcome. And perhaps in these 1970' s, we may be<br />
able to take some steps along this road. e / 6 </p>
<p>It will take a long, long time -in my opinion for attitudes of the masses<br />
completely to change. There is no such attitude among intelligent people, but it is<br />
largely there in the masses. In the circumstances I have outlined, it will take a<br />
long time to change, but if each of us in our own countries seeks to do what we car-,<br />
then gradually this change will take place.<br />
I don't think it can be forced, I don't think it can be a forced change but I<br />
do think there should be a constant attempt, and I do think that attempt can well be<br />
successful. We believe that the Commonwealth, as it is at present constituted, and<br />
without any changes, is of value and has proved itself to be so. We also believe<br />
that the potential value of the Commonwealth is much greater than at present. This<br />
value is slightly vitiated, as we have seen in this conference, by us all spending<br />
most of the time talking at enormous length about the things on which we disagree.<br />
I don't say that we shouldn't talk about things on which we disagree. We should.<br />
We should each put our point of view and others should say they agree with it or<br />
disagree with it and then go on to something else. Something else, I would hope, on which<br />
we all agreed and could work on with a common goal.<br />
So we see the Commonwealth as of value, provided it operates on the<br />
principles I have enunciated. We see it of an even greater value in the future because<br />
it is likely that if our efforts are successful, then the areas of disagreement will<br />
contract", the things on which we have discussions from different sides can be<br />
reduced. If this happens, there will be a bigger opportunity to work on matters<br />
on which we agree, and we might have more constructive results in the end.<br />
It has been suggested to me from time to time you might have even<br />
diplomatically hinted at it yourself, Mr. Chairman that Australia tends sometimes<br />
to be rather an intrangisent country. But in declarations, which I hope will not<br />
become a practice, or in resolutions, or in other matters, we do not think that we<br />
should put our name or give our support to statements that we do not thoroughly<br />
agree with or say we will take courses of action which we will not, in fact, adhere<br />
to. And we will not do this. </p>
