PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT FEBRUARY 26 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY LAURIE OAKES AFGHANISTAN<br />
Question: Today's Parliamentary row was sparked by you accusing the Opposition<br />
of sympathy towards the Russian involvement of Afghanistan.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, sympathy is the wrong word.<br />
What I have said in plain terms is that there seemed to be a thread<br />
in the Australian Labor Party which was either finding excuses<br />
for the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan or if not excuses,<br />
then trying to find a reason why Australia should do nothing about it.<br />
I thought that was on the evidence, a very reasonable statement to<br />
make and if the-Labor Party wanted to rebutt it there are the devices<br />
of the Parliament to rebutt other than the devices of noise and the<br />
kinds of personal attack that camne subsequently because I am prepared<br />
to justify those statements on the basis that the spoken word of<br />
members of the Labor Party.<br />
Question: You were fairly provocative, though, weren't you, given that the<br />
Labor Party seems to be saying much the same thing as you or an<br />
intelligence organisation, the ONA, has said.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There was a report in the National Times there is a procedure<br />
if Mr Hayden wants to be briefed by ONA, he would ask my office<br />
and I would in normal circumstances say ' yes', and Mr Furlonger,<br />
the Director, would brief hi. No such request was made, no such<br />
briefing has in fact been given. On the basis of what was in the<br />
National Times I don't believe for one moment that Mr Hayden<br />
has had a briefing or seen their reports. Now, there can be ifrne<br />
of view about why the Soviet Union moved into Afghanistan . and I have<br />
said that on many occasions,-but the. important thing is the<br />
consequences t'h'at can flow from them being there. In that matter,<br />
the Government and the Government's advisers, as I believe it,<br />
are virtually at one, and that includes the Office of--National<br />
Assessm~ ents. If it didn't, if they did have a different view, they are<br />
entitled to it but the Government has to govern and be responsible<br />
for its views. But, the broad view is that, having moved into<br />
Afghanistan, that creates a thoroughly critical and dangerous<br />
situation that did call for a very firm response from the United<br />
States and obviously from others. If there had been no response,<br />
a much-more dangerous situation would have developed. Now, there<br />
is no difference in the assessment of that, but Mr Hayden seems<br />
to be saying that all we have to do is utter a verbal condemnation<br />
of Afghanistan, and do nothing about it, and impliedly therefore,<br />
the United States does not have to do anything about it because it is<br />
not good enough for Mr Hayden to imply that the United States should do' </p>
<p>OAKES Prime Minister: ( cont.)<br />
certain things but that we have no obligations whatsoever ourselves.<br />
So, he is saying, terrible as the invasion is, the United States<br />
and nobody else, should do anything about it. Now, that is the view<br />
that the Government rejects totally.<br />
Question: You said today that what you really want is a bipartisan policy in<br />
this issue. Last Thursday Mr Hayden offered you that when he said*<br />
that the Labor Party would vote for the Government's resolution<br />
condemning the invasion if you deleted one clause which was the<br />
reference to this invasion being the greatest threat to world<br />
peace since 1945. Why weren't you prepared to do that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He then made it perfectly plain that the rest of the motion had<br />
. is' support We wanted that there plainly as the view which. the<br />
Government has of the matter. That resolution commits us to<br />
seeing what countries, individually or in concert, collectively,<br />
can do to bring the world's abhorrence home to the Soviet Union, and<br />
not only to the Soviet Union and the Russian people. Mr Hayden is on<br />
record as agreeing that a boycott of the Olympic Games for example<br />
would do that very thing, very well. But then having started from<br />
a position in which he would support a boycott if it were effective<br />
and if there was significant international support for it, he then<br />
moves to a position in which. he opposes all our attempts I don't<br />
think he will be ultimately successful, but in which he opposes the<br />
attempts the Government is making to achieve an effective boycott.<br />
I think there is a very real element of double standard in that.<br />
I don't understand it. Why therefore, does he do it?<br />
Question: On that subject, could I ask you about the proposed Games in<br />
Melbourne. Prime Minister:<br />
You have been wanting to ask me about that for about three days<br />
but there is really not a great deal to say about it.--<br />
Question: Could I ask you howt you rate the. chances of some of the events<br />
being held here?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I can't say any more about that at the moment, there are some moves<br />
to have the Games split up in a number of countries. I can't go<br />
beyond that.<br />
* Question: Can you say whether you would help finance events in Melbourne?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
* of course we would he~ lp finance events in alternative places. / 3<br />
-A </p>
<p>OAKES -3-<br />
Question:<br />
And do you-have reports specifically mentioning Melbourne?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, look it is fairly broad trying to get Games in a number of<br />
places at: the moment in a number of different countries.<br />
Question: And have you talked to Mr Hamer about the possibility?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Not yet. </p>
