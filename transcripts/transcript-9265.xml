SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER. THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
OFFICIAL OPENING, EUROPEAN MASTERPIECES FROM THE<br />
NATIONAL GALLERY OF IRELAND<br />
NATIONAL GALLERY OF AUSTRALIA. 24 JUNE 1994<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here today to welcome all of you, especially our friends<br />
from Ireland, and to open this great exhibition.<br />
This is the first exhibition to come on ioan from a national gallery to the Australian<br />
National Galleriy, and I anmde lighted that it comes from a Ireland, the country where<br />
learning and expression are themselves considered national treasures, the country with<br />
whom we share so much history and culture and beliefs, the one so close to so many<br />
Australian hearts.<br />
Contemporary Australia is not derivative of any single nation, but there is an awful lot<br />
of Irish in the mixture.<br />
Tonight I won't go over the familiar ground of the things we have in common, the<br />
singular contribution the Irish have made to Australia or the great bonds between us.<br />
Except to say that this exhibition in a way points towards other realms of experience<br />
we share.<br />
Living at a remove from the centres of European art and culture and for a long time a<br />
colonial remove at that might have meant succumbing to a temptation to be imnitative<br />
or deferential in our creativity and taste; or perhaps equally, an instinct to be<br />
aggressively parochial.<br />
In various ways, to various degrees and at various stages of our history we have<br />
resisted this. And in their ways our National Galleries speak for this resistance.<br />
Their collections might be read as the embodiment of the development among us of a<br />
love of things which are good, no matter where they come from: Guinness from<br />
Ireland, wine from Australia, Velazquez from Spain. And much else from each of us. 7041 </p>
<p>Of course this is the century in which it has become possible as never before to indulge<br />
in these things.<br />
One of the great liberating forces for Australians has been the Boeing 747.<br />
It is now possible.-not necessarily easy, but possible for Australians other than the<br />
most wealthy to travel to Europe where, among other things like meeting their Irish<br />
relations they may see masterpieces such as these.<br />
Even more liberating, and more democratic in this century it is increasingly possible<br />
for these works to come to us.<br />
Or for works such as Sidney Nolan's to go to New York, or Aboriginal artworks to be<br />
shown in Paris where I saw them just a few days ago. It is a two-lane air highway.<br />
On the evidence of this exhibition, you would have to say that perhaps some people let<br />
themselves down by visiting Ireland and not visiting the National Gallery.<br />
It should be unthinkable like visiting Canberra and not visiting the National Gallery.<br />
Let me congratulate those who have managed the task of bringing this exhibition to us.<br />
The principal curator, Sergio Benedetti, and his helpers, Irish and Australian alike,<br />
faced a tremendous challenge and we are deeply gratefual for the courage and skill<br />
with which he met it.<br />
I am not sure whether we have ever seen a Velazquez in this country I am told there<br />
may have been one in the 1 960s. But since there are so few in the world outside the<br />
Prado, it was a bold decision to let even this one painting travel from Europe.<br />
But the rarity and splendour of that one work will not blind us to the value artistic as<br />
well as monetary.-of works by Titian, Goya, El Greco, Murillo and Tintoretto.<br />
Raymond Keaveney deserves the greatest thanks for letting them all come to us.<br />
Annita met Raymond when we visited Ireland last year and found him typically [ rishk<br />
which is to say charming and generous.<br />
And recognising these qualities in him not to say those of the marvellous paintings in<br />
the gallery she took advantage of his native good will and his need to find a<br />
temporary home for these works while his gallery was repaired.<br />
The result of their conversation and one or two letters between them is here before us<br />
this evening.<br />
But many others, of course, brought it from conception to reality and I know you<br />
would want me to thank them all.<br />
Dr Tony O'Reilly, who has sponsored the exhibition, deserves our most sincere thanks.<br />
7042 </p>
<p>3<br />
I must make mention of my friend, Betty Churcher, for her involvement in yet another<br />
triumph. And we must thank Ireland and the Irish people. Their love of the best in life, the<br />
engagement with the human spirit and imagination, their passion for expression, is<br />
evident in the making of this collection.<br />
We in Australia never forget the things for which we should thank Ireland this<br />
exhibition of great European masterworks is one more thing. 7043 </p>
