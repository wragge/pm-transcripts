<p>All Australians will have been shocked and outraged by the terrorist attacks in Karachi and Istanbul over the weekend, in which innocent travellers and worshippers have been brutally murdered.</p>
<p>The Australian Government unequivocally condemns such terrorist acts. We deplore the loss of innocent lives.</p>
<p>We express our profound sympathy to those who have been injured and to the families of those who lost their lives.</p>
<p>The Government made approaches earlier this year to a number of governments, including our traditional allies and a number within our region, seeking avenues for increased co-operation in the fight against international terrorism. Those approaches have been positively received.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government has actively pursued broad-based counter-terrorist measures in international organisations such aG the United Nations, the International Civil Aviation organisation and the International Maritime Organisation, as well as within the context of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>To ensure that Australia is able to deal with any terrorist actions within our own boundaries, we have put this nation's counter-terrorist response capabilities under review, and the resulting report will shortly be considered by the Gove rnmient.</p>
