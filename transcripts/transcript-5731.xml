PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY DECEMBER 21 198].<br />
CHRISTMAS/ NEW YEAR MESSAGE<br />
Tamie and I extend to all Australians our best wishes for a<br />
Happy Christmas and a satisfying New Year.<br />
This is a good time of the year to look ahead to our hopes<br />
for our nation and our children, and to reflect upon the<br />
attitudes and actions which will help us achieve those hopes.<br />
I believe that no nation has better prospects in the 1980s than<br />
Australia to achieve economic growth, to improve living standards<br />
for Australian families and maximise opportunities to build the<br />
way of life we want for ourselves.<br />
Australia is in many ways an example of confidence and success<br />
to other countries, and we must make sure we do nothing to<br />
destroy that reputation or the achievements on which it is founded.<br />
Australians are fortunate that we can be united as one people<br />
in our determination to make sure that Australia is the best<br />
country in the world for everyone, and we should not forget that.<br />
Christmas is about peace and goodwill to all people.<br />
It is very much a time for families, for families to reunite,<br />
for relatives, for friends, and I extend the compliments of the<br />
season, a Happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year to all<br />
Australians. O000---</p>
