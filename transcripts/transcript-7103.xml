TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS BY THE PRIME MINISTER ON THE FRONT STEPS<br />
OF PARLIAMENT HOUSE THURSDAY 5 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
PM: that I hope that we were gracious winners in 1983 and we<br />
S_ -will -certainly be gracious losers in 1987, and we will be very<br />
very tough competitors again in 1990-91. But I want to say as I<br />
did last night when I spoke to him, congratulations to Dennis<br />
Conner I admired the way he took his defeat in 1983 and I have<br />
admired his tenacity and single-mindedness in setting about<br />
regaining the Cup. So he has our best wishes and I hope he<br />
enjoys it for the next 3 or 4 years. Finally I want to say to<br />
Iain Murray, as I did last night, don't feel let down you did<br />
your best, you and your crew did your very very best, you did<br />
Australia proud and we know that you will be in there helping<br />
fight for Australia to get it back next time.<br />
-JOURNALIST: Have you ordered the Akubra, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: No, but I have taken steps to see that it is safe and it<br />
will be sent with my best wishes to the President.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Mr Reagan. a. better punter than you are?<br />
FH1: Oh well I don't know, you nc judge a punter or e<br />
politician on one performance. I ! h&gt; e got a pretty gc! record<br />
over the years in the punting stak. ts.<br />
JOURNA LIST: Prime Minister, are you also enjoying the<br />
competition in the opposition?<br />
aiPtt ' g: e ts better and bett; r doesn't it. It's lone-. nd more<br />
amusino than Blue Hills. Lit really there are some v\<br />
devasta. ting things being sa. d by Sir Joh about his i, : as and by<br />
his friends about Sir Joh but really I don't spendvc: much time<br />
thinking about that I am just getting on with the tasi of<br />
governing and running the country and I think that pc. j-le are<br />
able to see the contrast between the steadiness of thf?<br />
Government and the perthetic nature of the opposition.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are the odds on Andiew Peacock<br />
PM: Interesting.<br />
