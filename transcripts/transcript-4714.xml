L A~<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17 MAY 1978<br />
ASSISTANCE TO WESTERN AUSTRALIAN AND<br />
TASMANIAN APPLE GROWERS<br />
The Prime Minister today announced the willingness of the<br />
Commonwealth to join with the States of Western Australia<br />
and Tasmania in examining joint dollar for dollar funding<br />
of special assistance to apple growers affected by Cyclone<br />
Alby in Western Australia and by frost and hail in Tasmania.<br />
Mr Fraser pointed out that assistance of this type was not<br />
normally provided under the natural disaster assistance<br />
agreements. " I am, however, aware of and sympathetic to the problems<br />
facing these primary producers in both States. That is why<br />
I have written today to both Sir Charles Court and Mr Batt<br />
indicating that the Commonwealth stands ready to help and<br />
making this offer," said Mr Fraser.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth was already<br />
committed in the current financial year to providing.$ 33m.<br />
to the States for natural disaster assistance. The final<br />
figure could be almost double that amount.<br />
" The Government maintains a close working relationship with<br />
State Governments in respect of all natural disasters so as<br />
to ensure that every possible assistance is given to those<br />
affected, as -L the present instance," 1Mr Fraser said. </p>
