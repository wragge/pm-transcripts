    <content><![CDATA[<p>With the first anniversary of the Bali terrorist attacks approaching, I have asked my Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon Jackie Kelly MP, to take personal responsibility for liaising with the victims and families.  The Australian government is committed to supporting those affected by this tragedy.</p>
<p>As I announced last week, the government will be arranging two memorial services, one in Bali on 12 October 2003 and one in Canberra on 16 October.</p>
<p> Miss Kelly will be of great assistance in planning the arrangements for these two ceremonies to ensure that the wishes of victims and families are listened to and taken into account.</p>
<p>Information is being sent this week to the families of those who were killed, about assistance available for travel to these ceremonies.  The seriously injured and their families will also be eligible for assistance.</p>
<p>  Further information is available through the Centrelink Bali Hotline on 13 61 25 or from <a href="http://www.baliassist.gov.au">www.baliassist.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p>Victims and families are also being invited to provide suggestions for the ceremonies to Centrelink by mail, telephone or email.  Miss Kelly will be looking closely at these suggestions.  </p>
