I o OFFICIAL OPENING OF MEDICAL BEIEFITS BUILDING, YDNEY<br />
ON<br />
7TH OCTOBER. 1961<br />
SPEECH BY THE HRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES.<br />
Sir, and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I speak here under very very great difficulty. I would like to take<br />
you into my confidence on that matter. First, they have these wretched li&amp; ghts,<br />
which, in my experience render only the rarest people like Sir Ronald Grieve<br />
capable of utterance. To me they have nothing but destruction in them. My<br />
second difficulty is that Sir Ronald Grieve, himself, having gone throu. eh the<br />
gesture of sending to my secretary all the things I ought to know in cvrde,-to<br />
make a speech has now, for greater caution, produced them all in his vn speech.<br />
( Laughter) This is the first " dirty" trick that he has ever jiayed on Irc--. My<br />
third disability is one that all laymen here can understand perfectly: I am<br />
sitting here under a battery of what I can only describe as " basilisk medical.<br />
eyes". ( Laughter) It is bad enough to consult your own physician and have him<br />
look at you, penetrating all the murky secrets of your carcass I'm spe aking<br />
only of myself but to look along and see them all, all equally f orthcoing, all<br />
looking at us up here, saying to themselves " a clear cpse of so-arnd-so".-or " I<br />
think I would like a blood test", is very embarrassing. Therefore, subje: t to<br />
these disabilities I will proceed to declare the building open. But I suppose<br />
that having done that you would expect me to say a word or two about the<br />
occasion and what it stands for.<br />
I have been in Parliament, man and boy, State and Federal, for 33<br />
years. I dontt want the obvious rejoinder I get them up at Canberra. I think<br />
for most of that time one became accustomed to the problem of sickness, people<br />
having to secure medical. aid hospital treatment almost as if it were one of the<br />
unalterable laws of life. There it was and perhaps nothing very much could be<br />
done about it. That is usually, historically, the way in which problems begin to<br />
evolve. Then somebody begins to say, " Well the right way to deal with these<br />
matters is to put them all in the hands of the Government". Vie have a great<br />
passion for that in Australia. 1I feel complimented, I do indeed, when so many<br />
people who disapprove of me personally, want to put everything in my hands. But<br />
that is rather one of our ideas. Well, the Government ought to provide medical<br />
treatment; and it ought to do it, of course, by having a great corps of medical<br />
people, and nurses, and all those who go with it, and attend to the people,<br />
whether they like it or not, willy-nilly. The Government is to do the lot.<br />
That is one extreme view, I would doubt whether anybody, today, se3riously<br />
entertains it. As so frequently is the case, on the other hand you E-' t the<br />
exctreme view of doing nothing and saying, " Well this is one of those matters<br />
that happens and if you can raise the general standard of living then. people can<br />
provide these things for themselves". So you get the extreme view on -ea-ch side.<br />
What has happened in connection with this scheme is that tro':' e has<br />
been a tremendous effort made to get a middle of the road course .% hich; il<br />
pre serve the best aspects of both; a middle course which irl retain th6<br />
precious relationship between doctor and patient not to be underestimated, I<br />
believe, even therapeutically a tremendously important relationship of mutual<br />
confidence; and, of course, after a period of time, of great knowledge and<br />
understanding. Keep that; but at the same time do something to get rid of the<br />
horror that attached itself for so long to sickness in the house, the brnead<br />
winner out of action, great financial liabilties incurred, financial assets,<br />
perhaps small, dissipated. These things couild alter an entire life, destroy<br />
the entire family history. Th.-refore the middle of the line course had to be<br />
to rake some arrangements which would leave people free from that kind of horror<br />
and at the same time not deprive them of that proper feeling of pride and<br />
independence which, thank God, charactarises our community. Out of those ideas<br />
came this scheme. I very well remembeor it is very interesting that Sir Earl Page is<br />
here today because I very well remember the first time he produced whlat I must<br />
tell him quite frankly was a rather hazy outline of this schem, accon-panied by </p>
<p>estimates which were conspicuous for their slight inaccuracy. They were<br />
optimistic, let me put it that way, This was his technique: don't make it too<br />
clear to these lawyers, or they will have the insides out of you intellectuiJ-y<br />
speaking but make all your estimates optimistic and then people will be in a<br />
happy frame of mind. A pearfect piece of medical work, it was. In the long run,<br />
as you very properly acknowledged, this scheme emerged. Of course like all<br />
schemes of this kind which don't please either the extreme of this side or the<br />
extreme of that side, it was under great criticism. But in spite of the fact<br />
that it was under great ci-iticism it has been so seized upon by the people, it<br />
has so hit the mark in the social and individual consciousness, that today<br />
somewhere between 70 and 80% I think I am right in saying of the people of<br />
Australia are covered by these voluntary arrangements. Now this, I think, is a<br />
splendid thing. Government responsibility, self-help, justice and the<br />
preservation of the personal relationships which still remain so important.<br />
Now of course it couldn't have succeeded unless there had been ( a)<br />
people who belioved in it and people who would work, devotedly, about it.<br />
In the case of this one, well there is Ronald Grieve. The first time I ever<br />
heard of him he was unfailingly reported to us in Canberra as " a very diffic4t<br />
fellow",' the sort of man, who, unlike myself wanted to argue about things.<br />
( Laughter) I have no doubt that he argued, with great force, and fought his<br />
battles with great force, and when these things were concluded he has set a<br />
conspicuous example of devoting his energy to making it succeed. He has<br />
around him, as he has already told us himself, hundreds of people, with a<br />
spirit of devotion, who know that this is a very great social thing, this is one<br />
of the most significant social mvements in our time, and Vwho, accordingly,<br />
: egard it, I've no doubt, as something rather more than a job. People who<br />
regard their work as a job achieve without dif. Ficulty a state of miserable<br />
mediocrity. The people who are going to do things properly must think that it<br />
is more than a job, that it is something that calls upon everything that they<br />
have ini them. The result of all this has been this fantastic development. I venture<br />
to say, ladies and gentlemen,' that if, a few years ago, when Earl Page was<br />
dazzling us with science in the Cabinet room at Canberra, anybody had said that<br />
the day would come when a building like this would find itself, not only in<br />
existence, but necessary, housing active people and dealing with thousands and<br />
thousands of-people, few would have believed it. It is one of the most tangible<br />
proofs that 1 have ever seen of the complete success of the medical benefit<br />
schemeI and of the matters associated with it.<br />
I want to compliment you, Sir, I want to compliment aji~ those who have<br />
been associated with you, and through you all the thousands of people around<br />
Australia who in this and compflarable entarprises, arc doing so much to make<br />
effective what I believe to be, and there are people who agree with me, the<br />
finest medical scheme in the world.<br />
Sir, I declare this building open. </p>
