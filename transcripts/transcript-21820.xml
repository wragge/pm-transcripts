    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to advise that the President of Chile, HE Ricardo Lagos Escobar, will visit Australia from 13 - 15 July 2005.</p>
<p> Australia's bilateral relationship with Chile is in excellent shape.  It is characterised by strong and growing business interests, particularly through Australian investment in Chile (estimated total investment in excess of $2 billion), especially in the mining sector, and excellent people-to-people links, notably through the contribution of the substantial Chilean community in Australia.</p>
<p>To advance bilateral ties, a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a work and holiday visa programme will be signed during President Lagos' visit.  The programme will offer 100 visas per year in each country for young people with appropriate qualifications and language skills to holiday and work in the partner country.</p>
<p>I also look forward to discussing with President Lagos our common interest in achieving a successful WTO round and Asia Pacific regional issues.  Chile played host to a very successful APEC year in 2004 and we will discuss how we might continue to build the APEC agenda ahead of Australia hosting APEC in 2007.   We will also discuss the prospect of negotiating a double taxation agreement, and closer cooperation on nuclear research.</p>
