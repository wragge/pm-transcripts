The Australian Prino Minister, iMr. TJhitlam, and the<br />
Chief Iinister of Papua New Guinea, ir. Somare, today issued<br />
the following statement concerning their discussions in<br />
Canberra on 17 January 1973.<br />
The Chief Minister had raised with Iinisters of the<br />
previous Australian Government the question of the rights of<br />
the Papua Iew Guinea Government to legislate on its omw behalf<br />
on fisheries matters, -le had also discussed arrangements for<br />
the management of the f isheries resources in the waters between<br />
Australia and PaDua HTew Guinea. On that occasion Ministers had<br />
agreed that both countries must benefit from joint management<br />
arrangements and mutual co-operation in the exploitation and<br />
conservation of the fisheries resources of the seas which lay<br />
between them. At that time Miinisters also agreed to the following<br />
arrangements: delegation of licensing powers to the P. I. G. Government<br />
subject to agreement on interim arrangements to apply<br />
after the delegation of licensing powers and until the<br />
transfer of complete powers;<br />
S work to be commenced on the preparation of separate<br />
fisheries legislation for Papua Hew Guinea. Review<br />
of the amendments currently proposed to the Commonwealth<br />
Fisheries Act with a view to exclusion of Papua New<br />
Guinea from the provisions of the Act;<br />
conclusion of interim arrangements to be set down in an<br />
exchange of letters between the two governments,<br />
The Papua Neu Guinea Government had then as ked that the<br />
interim arrangements include the following provisions:<br />
Papua Hew Guinea to license an appropriate number of<br />
prawn catcher and carrier vessels to fish in all<br />
proclaimed waters outside the Declared Fisheries Sone;<br />
and agreement by all Papua TeTr Guinea vessels licensed under<br />
above to comply with Australian conservation and<br />
management measures as applied to other Australian<br />
vessels licensed under the Commonwealth Fisheries Act. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
SFollowing those discussions the Chief M1inister had now<br />
raised with the Prime Miinister the question of rights of access<br />
for Papua iTew Guinea fishing vessels into the Gulf of Carpentaria,<br />
and claimed that under present administrative arrangements Papua<br />
Hev Guinea vessels were being denied access to international<br />
waters because the restrictive provisions of the Commonwealth<br />
Fisheries Act continued to be applied against the interests of<br />
Papua IHTo Guinea.<br />
The Prime Minister has agreed that there appeared to be<br />
an anomally in the situation, and that Australia had a trusteeship<br />
responsibility to promote the economic viability of Papua ilew<br />
Guinea by providing reasonable assistance to Papua HIew Guinea<br />
industries, and saw grounds for a change of Australian policy<br />
to allow additional access to the Gulf of Carpentaria for an<br />
agreed number of Papua eow Guinea fishing vessels. The Chief<br />
Minister suggested that Papua Iew Guinea be granted the right<br />
to license twelve Papua Hew Guinea vessels to operate in the<br />
Gulf of Carpentaria from the commenconent of the 1973 prawning<br />
season. The Prime'Minister agreed that that would be an<br />
appropriate number, and arrangements are being made to put<br />
this decision into effect.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Chief Minister agreed that<br />
Papua Nev Guinea fishing vessels operating in the Gulf of<br />
Carpentaria would remain in international waters outside the<br />
Australian Declared Fishing Zone ( 12 miles offshore) and would<br />
observe conservation and management measures as applied to<br />
other vessels licensed under the Australian Fisheries Act.<br />
