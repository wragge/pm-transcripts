PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 16 OCTOBER, 1978 ( U7~<br />
INTERVIEW ON MIKE WALSH SHOW<br />
CHANNEL 10 SYDNEY, 16.8.78<br />
Walsh: Good to see you again. It's about 12 months since you last<br />
did our programme and in that time I think not a day has gone<br />
by in my life without someone saying to me,' as Malcolm Fraser<br />
said, life wasn't meant to be easy'. Do you ever regret<br />
saying that? It's become the great quote of all time I think.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think so because it is a fact of life. If people want<br />
to do things well it's not easy, it's hard. You've got to<br />
work at it. You work at this show. An Olympic athlete<br />
works and trains at that. When the family were up camping<br />
at Birdsville and travelling south to Anaininka the only sign<br />
they had on the store, and I don't know if they knew I was<br />
going to be turning up or not, was ' life wasn't meant to<br />
be easy'.<br />
Walsh: I just want to talk about a few things that have happened<br />
recently and some of the issue. First of all, as you are very<br />
well aware, that Mr. Neville Wran in NSW has got a new phrase<br />
coined for him now, its a " Wranslide", because he absolutely<br />
and utterly had a resounding successful win at the polls here<br />
in NSW. How much of a rebuff is that to your Government.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it's a great personal victory for Neville Wran.<br />
I don't know that it's all that much of a rebuff to the Federal<br />
Government because he fought it on State issues. I don't try<br />
and say that other things didn't impinge upon that but you've<br />
only got to speak to people in this city; Neville Wran is a<br />
popular Premier, who is a moderate Premier and I hope with the<br />
large majority that remains.<br />
Walsh: But the recent Federal Budget even amongst your own people<br />
they are saying that that definitely was a factor in the fact<br />
that the Liberals lost so many votes in the State.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Some do, but there were polls taken long before the Budget which<br />
we'd undertaken, the Liberal Party had, which had indicated<br />
about the same kind of change in NSW.<br />
Walsh: So you weren't surprised at the outcome? </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, I wasn't surprised at all I'm afraid. The Liberal<br />
Party had been through some difficulties also. Peter Coleman<br />
hadn't been there all that long and I think he is a very<br />
good man but he hadn't really had time to make his mark telt.<br />
The Liberal Party had had some trouble in the Branches and<br />
that had been in the press too much. Now, I think those<br />
things are behind us. But quite apart from his own performance,<br />
in the State scene there were some things happening that were<br />
bound to reinforce it. But can I just quote one of the things<br />
and why I think Neville Wran is very skillful. I saw him<br />
on television in a prepared broadcast just a short maybe a<br />
week before the election and he said while I differ with<br />
the Federal Government in some things I am at one in their<br />
policy of overcoming inflation and on another occasion he<br />
said that it had taken hard and courageous decisions and<br />
implying-. that we were basically on the right track in that.<br />
In that sort of statement, Neville Wran was embracing a large<br />
number of our own supporters at the same time and it was a<br />
great personal victory and I don't think anything should<br />
detract from that.<br />
Walsh: We'll leave that on at that. But I want to stay with the<br />
Budget on a couple of things. One was which some of the<br />
things which seemed in that Budget to hit little people in<br />
ordinary everyday events. Like why bother taking away<br />
the maternity allowance? How much will that save the<br />
Government? Prime Minister:<br />
It doesn't save all that much. I do need to put it into<br />
perspective. Three or four decisions have probably hit the<br />
headlines and people have thought they are uncaring, thoughtless,<br />
insensitive. I think what I would like people to understand<br />
is that we had to have a Budget that was going to reinforce<br />
the general fight against inflation and get inflation down,<br />
get interest rates down so Australian factories can produce<br />
more, get a bigger share of our market and get into exports<br />
as a number of people are now starting ilto. So, pre-eminently<br />
the Budget was aimed at that. Now, if you look at the whole<br />
thrust of the Budget, on the expenditure side and also in<br />
revenue, there are probably not just a half a dozen difficult<br />
decisions that have hit the headlines, but some tens of<br />
very difficult decisions. It might be in the amount of<br />
expenditure you have for a particular program and no one of<br />
those decisions by itself could be said to threaten the Budget<br />
strategy, but taken all together they meant getting to a<br />
responsible overall level of expenditure for the Commonwealth<br />
or not getting to a responsible level. And if it was judged<br />
by being irresponsibleithen you've got inflation starting<br />
to go up and instead of being able to get them down, interest<br />
rates would go up again and I think that would be a tragedy<br />
for Australia. So many of the small decisions also contribute<br />
to the larger one., because. take one out by itself and it<br />
doesn't but add it all together they do. Now, alright, the<br />
maternity allowance. It was decades ago that that was introduced.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>free health scheme, there was no<br />
When it was introduced there was no/ Medibank. We've got<br />
Medibank mark III which I believe is better, and I think it<br />
is being accepted by the whole community. So the sort of<br />
costs, the sort of problemsthat the maternity allowance was<br />
originally designed to overcome just aren't there at the<br />
moment with modern health care. If you like~ it was additional<br />
pocket money. And in addition to the health arrangements<br />
that we have there are family allowance arrangements, and<br />
these two things together really did make the maternity<br />
allowance outdated and irrelevant in the modern circumstancescertainly<br />
irrelevant to the needs for which it was originally<br />
introduced. Against the overall background which I mentioned<br />
therefore, if . we had said. C kht, it's not serving the kind of<br />
social need that it was designed tdo-other things have come<br />
in and taken its place and are doing it much better, especially<br />
the health arrangements and therefore it is abandoned.<br />
Walsh: What about the one on accumulated holiday pay? That's another<br />
one that worries the average person. Now, if you don't take<br />
your holidays this year, you take them next year because your<br />
boss says" ca you stay-around, we're going through a busy<br />
period'~ or something, the money that you had, which is your<br />
nice little nest egg until next year's holiday, suddenly<br />
becomes taxable.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It becomes taxable when you change your employment, or when<br />
you retire and when you've accumulated your holiday pay.<br />
If you are taking your holiday pay still with the same employeri<br />
the arrangements aren't really changed. So, it's when somebody<br />
leaves that job. What had happened in the past was that people<br />
leave their job, they have accumulated holiday pay for which they<br />
get a cash payment and. go and get another job. -In<br />
a sense is defeating the purpose of holiday pay defeating<br />
the purpose of holidays, because people are meant to take<br />
their annual holidays. They are meant to refresh themselves<br />
in doing it, and that's the basis on which it is structured.<br />
I can't see any real reason why people who don't take their<br />
holidays should have that addition to income without any tax<br />
at all, or minimal tax as it was. Now it will be taxed at<br />
the standard rate, which is in part a concession because many<br />
people would be on probably higher marginal rates of tax than<br />
that. Walsh:. On the whole thing of the Budget *-and I'm afraid I'm going to<br />
stay with it a little bit today because there are some things<br />
that really do need to be explained,--the expected Budget<br />
deficit, well it is, $ 3,000 million. But the first quarterly<br />
deficit is already $ 992 million. So if you put that four<br />
times you get between $ 3,900 and $ 4,000 million. So it's<br />
going to be a lot heavier than you thought. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
You'vye just fallen into a good trap for young players.<br />
Walsh: Have I? This is why I'm not the Treasurer.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It wasn't for $ 3,000 million anyway, it was a bit over<br />
$ 2,800 million, and it sounds a lot better being under<br />
$ 3,000. But if you look at the early payments in the<br />
year there are a lot of uneven payments that the Commonwealth<br />
had to make. We have self-government now in the Northern<br />
Territory so instead of paying for the Northern Territory's<br />
services right throughout the year, as we have done in the<br />
past, there was a bulk payment to the Northern Territory that<br />
came in the early part of the year.<br />
Walsh: So, that first quarter is inflated compared to the rest of<br />
the<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
For that and for various other reasons: extra pension payments<br />
and things of this of this kind have come in. The first quarter<br />
is an inflated quarter, and when I saw the figures as they came<br />
out I asked the question that you did. I was told that there<br />
was no reason to think that the Budget would be off-track in<br />
terms of its total result.<br />
Walsh: At the end of year it will even out?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes. The payments aren't even throughout the year.<br />
Walsh: What about the borrowings? One of the great criticisms of the<br />
Whitlam Government was the fact it was going to borrow so much<br />
money from overseas.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
How? Walsh:-Well, this is what I'd like to hear from you, because they<br />
planned to borrow $ 2,000 million, and last year the Government<br />
that you head borrowed a total of $ 1.955 million a lot of<br />
it from Japan. </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Yes.<br />
Walsh: Surely that defeats the arguments that were thrown up against<br />
the Whitlan Government's spending?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think so, because Government borrowing properly<br />
conducted has a role to fill in the management of the<br />
country. But this was borrowing under the previous<br />
administration having nothing to do with Treasury advice,<br />
going to odd people from the Middle East, and trying to get<br />
money quite outside orthodox guidelines and for very unorthodox<br />
purposes. That obviously caused a great deal of furore and<br />
you have only got to mention the name Khemlani and all sorts<br />
of odd things are conjured up. Now the borrowing that we have<br />
undertaken has been for a specific purpose, and it's the<br />
Treasury officials who have done it with known and reputable<br />
people as Australia has borrowed. Not just this year or last<br />
year, but Australia has undertaken this kind of borrowing<br />
almost since the war. Not all the time, but Qhen it has<br />
been necessary. I'm sorry for one or two technical terms,<br />
but we believe that the value of Australia's currency is<br />
right, but because of low world trade and because of economic<br />
problems in other countries as well as Australia, there hasn't<br />
been as much foreign investment as we would like coming into<br />
this country and helping developin partnership with Australians,<br />
Australia's resources. The borrowings we have undertaken on<br />
official account have been to protect the balance of payments<br />
against this period when general world trade is low and<br />
general investment in the world is therefore lower than it<br />
would otherwise be. This has been necessary to protect the<br />
value of the Australian dollar and it has been necessary to<br />
protect the balance of payments.<br />
Walsh: So what you are saying is that your move is justified. You are<br />
going through the correct channels, whereas the Labor government<br />
were going through the incorrect channels?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The purposes were different too. The Labor borrowing was<br />
going to be a temporary loan for something that was 20 years.<br />
Well,, how you have a temporary loan for 20 years I'm not too<br />
sure. But for quite different purposes and for expenditure<br />
in Australia. These funds basically aren't for expenditure in<br />
Australia. They are basically to protect the balance of<br />
payments during a period when our own exports are slacker<br />
than they would otherwise be. because world trade is slacker<br />
and at the same time when foreign investment is less than it<br />
would be. </p>
<p>-6<br />
Walsh: Which all leads us to the question of unemployment. We had<br />
Dir Street on the programme a few weeks ago, he explained thait<br />
statement, it was reported widely and put into context. The<br />
fact remains that with increased technology we are going to<br />
face, inevitably, either a shorter working week or more<br />
unemployed people.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't believe that.<br />
Walsh: Well'how do you see the way out of it.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well go back to the beginning of the industrial revolution.<br />
You had the tudd-ites,.. and people who were frightened of<br />
machines and factories. In fact the industrial revolution<br />
led to more jobs being available than ever before in the<br />
history of mankind.<br />
Walsh: Arnd do you believe the same thing will happen again?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think basically modern technology is the same sort of<br />
thin39 it's different a bit but will work out in the<br />
same way. Let me take the example of Telecom. Telecom<br />
gave it's employees-and that particular union that was<br />
being difficult a few weeks ago -they had given them, a year<br />
ago, ten years guarantee against being sacked as a result of<br />
the introduction of new technology and new equipment. As I<br />
understand it Telecom were very relaxed about that guarantee, 3<br />
because they believe that with new technology they are<br />
going to be offering more services, better servicesto<br />
businesses, to people, and that while you might have less<br />
man hours to produce one particular item of equipment,<br />
people are going to be producing more items of equipment<br />
and there will be more things to sell. You have only<br />
got to look at a modern home today, in 1978, compared to<br />
that same home 20 years ago. You have got all sorts of<br />
equipment and appliances in it which are designed to make<br />
living easier, make it easier for a housewife. I'm quite<br />
certain that over the next five and ten years there are going<br />
to be modifications and changes and adaptations of that<br />
equipment which people are going to want, because it will<br />
enable them to do things better, and I think that we really<br />
need to grasp modern technology and innovative technology,<br />
because this is what will make Australian industries<br />
competitive. This will enable Australian industry to get<br />
a bigger share of our own domestic market and get rid of imports / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
in places, and it will enable them also to get into exports.<br />
Now out of all of that I see there being more jobs. These<br />
things aren't well understood, I agree with that, but we<br />
have got to embrace modern technology and that will be good.<br />
for Australia.<br />
Walsh: Just one other topic I'd like to cover with you while you are<br />
here, and of course it's the news of the day, about the raid<br />
on the ACTU Jetset offices on Saturday. All the papers<br />
commented on it in their editorials, the strange raid on ACTU<br />
Jetset, now do you think it was ill-advised?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I've only had a very brief discussion with Peter Nixon about<br />
that, and he tells me he's having a press conference this<br />
afternoon and that he will be putting it into perspective.<br />
Very briefly, he did tell me that on the advice of the<br />
Solicitor-General and the Crown Solicitor an investigation<br />
was warranted. Without pre-empting any part of what he will<br />
be saying, I'm advised that the investigation that was<br />
undertaken was exactly the same as what had occurred in<br />
half a dozen other cases somebody went along and asked<br />
for certain information. That's subject to what my colleague<br />
says after lunch, but if it's the same as what has happened in<br />
half a dozen other cases it would seem to me that it's maybe<br />
Mr Hawke who is building this, or trying to build it up, into<br />
some melodramatic event which, on the basis of what I've been<br />
told, I don't think it is.<br />
Walsh: You claim it was something rather routine for those<br />
circumstances?<br />
Prime minister:<br />
I'm told it's the same sort of investigation that has been<br />
undertaken half a dozen times, and nobody is worried about<br />
it at all..<br />
Walsh: With other travel companies?<br />
Prime minister:<br />
So I'm advised. But what I've said is I had only a very<br />
hurried conversation to Peter, and what I have said is<br />
subject to what he is saying this afternoon, because he<br />
will be handling the matter on behalf of the Government,<br />
and I understand putting it all in perspective and correcting<br />
one or two, as I am advised, of the melodramatic reports<br />
this morning. </p>
<p>8-<br />
Walsh: Right, because one of the hassles of any leader is the fact<br />
that he relies on a team of men, and his own image and that<br />
of his Government is inevitably affected by the Ministers.<br />
I'm harking back to Mr Phillip Lynch and the" Lands Scandal"<br />
some time back. Nowyou removed him from the position of<br />
Treasurer. He's still of course an important part of your<br />
Government. Do you think that the Opposition is going to<br />
continue with the Lands thing, which is still very, very much<br />
alive in Victoria Do you think they will continue to use<br />
that?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Two things. I think they probably willbecause the Opposition<br />
likes this sort of thing. I don't think the lands thing is<br />
very much alive in Victoria at the moment. I think* Mr Jennings'<br />
own credibility has been blown a bit by reports of some of<br />
his own activities and this last 60 or 70 page document.<br />
Everyone seems to understand that there is nothing much in<br />
that, and that in any case he would have many opportunities<br />
to put all his information before a Victorian Royal Commission.<br />
Now, the ye ry unhappy thing is when all this was going on in Victoria<br />
about this time last year, and then whatever was said in relation<br />
to Phillip one of the people who had been named in the inquiry<br />
and while it had nothing to do with the Victorian inquiry it in<br />
part got linked up with it. I believe that there has been very<br />
great stress and strain, and Phillip Lynch and his family as a<br />
result of it have already he has already in particular paid<br />
a high price in terms of mental suffering and anguish that has<br />
been involved by himself and his family. It has been demonstrated,<br />
I believe, that there was nothing in the allegations made against<br />
Phillip Lynch. One of the unfortunate things is somebody gets<br />
up and repeats it all again in the Parliament, saying nothing<br />
new, and it then gets reported again as though it's a new allegation,<br />
when in fact its the same one and has already been answered.<br />
Now, against that sort of background I would have thought that in<br />
decency it would be fair enough to let it rest, recognising that<br />
somebody has already paid a high price for all the publicity<br />
that has gone on in relation to it.<br />
Walsh: You don't expect anything new to come of it in other words?<br />
Do you think that they are raking but they won't find anything?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Our political opponents have been trying to find something<br />
new. They have asked questions and raised the matter many<br />
times through the question time and other avenues of<br />
Parliament. But on all the information available to me they<br />
haven't found anything new. But when they repeat a tired,<br />
sad allegation, I don't think it should get the sort of<br />
publicity it does as though it's a new allegation. I also<br />
believe that people need to treat very carefully allegations / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
made under the cover of Parliamentary privilege. members of<br />
parliament can sometimes get up and say the most terrible<br />
things about their colleagues without any evidence at all,<br />
and when that allegation goes out under the cover of<br />
Parliamentary privilege, major headlines in this paper or<br />
that, major items on the news, I really think that the<br />
person who ought to be grilled is the person who makes the<br />
allegation without evidence. That says something.<br />
Walsh: It's one of the failings of Parliamentary coverage that's for<br />
sure. There is just one final question I want to ask you,<br />
and it's probably the most important. How is your prize bull?<br />
We were very sorry to hear about his accident.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I understand that you've pursued his accident and got an<br />
explanation from a vet about how this sort of thing can occur.<br />
Well, I suppose it'. s just as well that it doesn't occur to the<br />
human species in the same way that it can to bulls. Well the<br />
Semitals are going well, and the Herefords are going well,<br />
but unfortunately Franz is not of this world.<br />
Walsh: Just a sad note to add to things.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
But you understand, you know the reasons.<br />
Walsh: We do, and our sympathies to Franz and his descendants.<br />
Prime Minsister:<br />
Well I hope the same fate never befalls you.<br />
Walsh: Oh ditto. OThh adtntko . you very much for joining us. </p>
