, EDIA RELiLASE CONSULTATIONS WITH UNITED STATES ]) EFENCE SECRETARY<br />
( Staterent by the Acting Prime M4inister,<br />
the Rt. lion J. D. Anthony, M. P.)<br />
Ministers had a most valuable exchange of views this morning<br />
with the United States Secretary of Defence, Mr. Caspar<br />
Weinberger. During the talks, Mr. Weinberger emphasised the importance<br />
which the U. S. attaches to the AINZUS alliance, and its<br />
appreciation of Australia's defence effort.<br />
I stated that Australia regards the ANZUS alliance as<br />
central to Australia's defence strategy, and sees itself as<br />
making an important contribution to the alliance. I said also<br />
that it was very important for the U. S. to maintain its strategic<br />
interest in the Pacific region.<br />
Discussions at this morning's talks on the global and<br />
regional security situation were wide-ranging and candid, as<br />
appropriate between representatives of Governments and societies<br />
sharing similar values.<br />
Mr. Weinberger will have further discussions this afternoon<br />
with the Minister for Defence, Mr. Sinclair.<br />
Canberra, November 1982. </p>
