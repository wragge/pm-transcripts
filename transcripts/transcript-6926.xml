SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NANJING BANQUET 23 MAY 1986<br />
YdUR EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR GU XIULIAN, VICE GOVERNOR CHEN<br />
HUAN YOU, YOUR EXCELLENCY VICE-MAYOR WANG RONG BING,<br />
. DISTINGUISHED CHINESE GUESTS AND AUSTRALIAN COLLEAGUES.<br />
THANK YOU, GOVERNOR GU, FOR YOUR WARM WORDS OF WELCOME TO<br />
YOUR FAMOUS PROVINCE AND SERENE AND BEAUTIFUL CAPITAL CITY.<br />
IT IS INDEED A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE ON THE GROUND THIS TIME,<br />
INSTEAD OF JUST CIRCLING OVERHEAD. I WELL RECALL HOW THE<br />
WEATHER TREACHEROUSLY INTERVENED WHEN I WAS LAST IN CHINA TO<br />
INCONVENIENCE YOU AT THE AIRPORT, WAITING PATIENTLY FOR US<br />
ON THAT MISERABLE WINTER'S DAY, MY PARTY AND I WERE BITTERLY<br />
DISAPPOINTED WHEN ADVISED THAT LANDING WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THIS<br />
TIME WE HAVE MADE IT!<br />
I WAS DETERMINED TO RETURN TO NANJING AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE<br />
OPPORTUNITY AND I HAVE MADE YOUR RICH AND ACCOMPLISHED PROVINCE<br />
AND ITS HISTORIC CAPITAL CITY A MAJOR FOCAL POINT OF MY PRESENT<br />
VISIT.<br />
. JIANGSU PROVINCE IS, OF COURSE, WELL-KNOWN TO AUSTRALIANS AS<br />
THE VANGUARD OF INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN<br />
THE CURRENT ERA OF CHINA'S DRAMATIC NATIONAL ECONOMIC REFORMS,-<br />
WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOUR SUCCESSES WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN<br />
RECENT YEARS AND MUST CONGRATULATE YOU IN PARTICULAR ON YOUR<br />
GREAT ACHIEVEMENT IN BECOMING CHINA'S LEADING INDUSTRIAL<br />
PROVINCE IN 1985, To HAVE DOUBLED INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FROM AN<br />
ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL BASE IN JUST FIVE YEARS IS A REMARKABLE FEAT. </p>
<p>JIANGSU IS, AS YOU HAVE NOTED, ESPECIALLY WELL-KNOWN TO THE<br />
PEOPLE OF OUR STATE OF VICTORIA FOR ITS ACTIVE CO-OPERATION<br />
IN DEVELOPING WHAT HAS BECOME A MODEL SISTER PROVINCE-SISTER<br />
STATE RELATIONSHIP, TOP LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES HAVE GIVEN<br />
SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL SUPPORT TO BUILDING UP THE MOMENTUM OF<br />
EXCHANGES, VISITS AT THE HIGHEST PROVINCIAL AND STATE<br />
GOVERNMENT LEVELS HAVE BEEN A REGULAR FEATURE OF THE<br />
RELATIONSHIP, I RECALL WITH PLEASURE MEETING GOVERNOR GU IN AUSTRALIA IN<br />
JUNE 1984 AT WHICH TIME I WAS ABLE TO APOLOGISE PERSONALLY<br />
FOR KEEPING HER OUT IN THE COLD. PARTY SECRETARY HAN PEIXIN<br />
WAS A FURTHER ABLE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS PROVINCE WHEN HE VISITED<br />
AUSTRALIA IN AUGUST LAST YEAR, PREMIER CAIN OF VICTORIA HAS<br />
ONLY LAST WEEK COMPLETED HIS SECOND SUCCESSFUL VISIT TO<br />
JIANGSU AND HAS BEEN MORE FORTUNATE THAN I IN HAVING TIME TO<br />
ENJOY NOT ONLY NANJING, BUT ALSO YOUR PROVINCE'S HISTORIC<br />
BEAUTY SPOTS OF SUZHOU AND WUXI,<br />
THE GOVERNMENTS OF JIANGSU AND VICTORIA ( AND MANY AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMPANIES IN OTHER STATES) ALREADY HAVE WELL ESTABLISHED<br />
COMMERCIAL CO-OPERATION AND TECHNICAL EXCHANGES IN THE AREAS<br />
OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PACKAGING AND LIGHT MANUFACTURES,<br />
THIS BASE IS TO BE REINFORCED BY A MAJOR EXHIBITION IN NANJING.<br />
CO-SPONSORED BY THE AUSTRALIAN TRADE COMMISSION, THIS COMING<br />
SEPTEMBER,<br />
I </p>
<p>3,<br />
IN ADDITION, VICTORIA HAS A CLOSE INTEREST, WHICH THE<br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STRONGLY SUPPORTS, IN INVOLVING ITSELF<br />
IN A SIGNIFICANT PORT DEVELOPMENT IN JIANGSU. AS A PART<br />
OF TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS, THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR<br />
YOUR OWN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN ITS SEVENTH FIVE-YEAR PLAN,<br />
AND IS ALSO AN AGREED SECTOR FOR CLOSE CO-OPERATION WITH<br />
AUSTRALIA. I SHALL LEAVE NANJING MUCH BETTER INFORMED ABOUT<br />
JIANGSU'S ACHIEVEMENTS AND ASPIRATIONS IN FORGING EVEN<br />
STRONGER PORT CONNECTIONS WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.<br />
JIANGSU HAS RECENTLY BECOME THE FOCUS OF ANOTHER MAJOR<br />
BILATERAL SECTORAL INITIATIVE WOOL. I HAD PLEASURE THIS<br />
AFTERNOON IN PARTICIPATING IN A CEREMONY MARKING A<br />
SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT BY AUSTRALIA AND<br />
CHINA OF A WOOL STORE IN A SUBURB OF NANJING. THE RAPID<br />
DEVELOPMENT IN RECENT YEARS OF JIANGSU'S WOOLLEN TEXTILE<br />
INDUSTRY IS SOMETHING IN WHICH I KNOW THE GOVERNOR TAKES A<br />
CLOSE PROFESSIONAL INTEREST.<br />
IN YET ANOTHER KEY AREA OF CO-OPERATION I LOOK FORWARD<br />
TOMORROW TO SEEING SHANGHAI'S MAJOR INVESTMENT IN JiANGSU<br />
PROVINCE THE MEISHAN IRON COMPLEX. AUSTRALIAN IRON ORE<br />
COMES RIGHT UP THE MIGHTY YANGTZE RIVER TO FEED ITS BLAST<br />
FURNACE AND COMMERCIAL CONTACTS CONTINUE ABOUT POSSIBLE<br />
FUTURE AUSTRALIAN INVOLVEMENT IN MEISHAN'S EXPANSION PLANS. </p>
<p>I THEREFORE PROPOSE A TOAST:<br />
-TO PRESENT AND FUTURE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN AUSTRALIA<br />
AND JIANGSU IN THE AREAS OF PORT DEVELOPMENT, WOOL<br />
PROCESSING AND IRON AND STEEL<br />
-TO JIANGSU'S AND VICTORIA'S HAPPY AND MUTUALLY REWARDING<br />
PARTNERSHIP, AND<br />
-TO THE GOOD HEALTH OF GOVERNOR GU, VICE-GOVERNOR CHEN,<br />
VICE MAYOR WANG AND ALL OTHER CHINESE AND AUSTRALIAN<br />
FRIENDS HERE TONIGHT. </p>
