UNVEILING AND RE-DEDICATION OF DESERT CORPS<br />
MEORIAL AT AANY JESTE AUTALIA 11TH OCTOBER, 1964<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the IRt. Hon. Sir Robert Mienzies.<br />
Mr. Minister, Your Excellency and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
This is a day of history and symbolism for two countries<br />
Australia, certainly for us New Zealand, certainly for them,<br />
our enduring brothers in this world. The Minister has told you<br />
something of the history of this memorial. It was in 1932<br />
that it was unveiled by W. M. Hughes at Port Said, and there<br />
was an interesting symbolism about its position in Egypt,<br />
because there it was at the mouth of the northern entrance<br />
to the Suez Canal; there it was looking out towards Palestine,<br />
Syria, towards the very centre of the Old Jorld,<br />
A very remarkable piece of symbolism that was that on<br />
an errand of war, men snould have come fiom two countries to<br />
find their way into one country which was the home of Christendom,<br />
and a group of countries which in a true sense were the home<br />
of European civilisation, ' e don't always remember that the<br />
civilisations of Europe came from originally the vicinity of<br />
the Caucasus and that the Phoenician moves across Europe first<br />
of all produced the great civilisation of Greece and then of<br />
Rome and then of the Romance countries and then of Great<br />
Britain herself.<br />
Therefore, here was a country which, however desert it<br />
might look, was the very cradle of religion and of civillsation,<br />
and men came to it from the far corners of the earth, fiom our<br />
two countries which had comparatively little history of their<br />
own and very little long-derived history, although they were<br />
old in point of years,<br />
Now this was, of course, a matter of enormous significance.<br />
It meant that people who might have been thought to have no<br />
particular interest in that part of the world went there in<br />
order to resist aggression, in order to right wrongs, in order<br />
to give let it be remembered, a practical demonstration of<br />
Christian faith in the very home of Christianity, and therefore<br />
it was a most appropriate and symbolic thing that this monument,<br />
as it then was should have pointed the way to this remarkable<br />
series of countries, this remarkable cradle as I have called it,<br />
of civilisation and religion.<br />
Then in 1956, it was attacked in the most vandal-like<br />
fashion. There was no reason in it, there was no sense in it.<br />
Indeed, when I heard about this, I couldn't help remembering<br />
that in 1941 and 1942, Egypt had been protected against being<br />
over-run, by forces from Great Britain and Australia and New<br />
Zealand at the Battle of Alamein, and this therefore was a<br />
wanton act. However it had one result and that is that by<br />
great skill and artistry, the memorial has been re-established,<br />
and now it has been re-established in a place which I venture<br />
to describe as equally symbolic in its own fashion. If it<br />
couldn't stand to point the way to what was then the future<br />
at Port Said., it is a good thing that it should stand here to<br />
point the farewell to those who left here to go to Egypt, to<br />
go to the Middle East, the last point of departure, the last<br />
lovely glimpse that some of them were ever to have of their<br />
own country. a o o / 2 </p>

And, therefore, I subscribe to the views, if I may<br />
with great respect, of the Soldiers' Leagues of both Australia<br />
and New Zealand in their view that this was the proper place<br />
in which this memorial should stand.<br />
Now, Sir, there is one other thing I would like to say.<br />
War memorials are perhaps not unccmnionly misunderstood.<br />
There are those whz3 think that they are merely commemorative<br />
of war, that in some way they glorify war. I would like to<br />
think they do far more than that. I would like to believ: e,<br />
and I know you believe, that they are symbolic of something<br />
enduring in human nature, something enduring in the human<br />
spirit, because it is after all, human nature tie human<br />
spirit that is the ena. uring element in all hisL.-' y3 i. t may<br />
be turned aside from its normal occupations, it may be called<br />
upon to perform great sacrifices it mcay have its m(, ments of<br />
anger and even its moments of hazred, but when these things<br />
have settled down irnto their place, it is the human spirit<br />
which is the continuing element in our civilisation,<br />
It is a wonderful thing, isn't it, that we should<br />
occasionally be able to stand in a place like thais and think<br />
about the human spirit, think about indomitable human nature<br />
and be proud of it and be refreshed ty it. This to me is<br />
the great significance of this place, It may very well be<br />
that this memorial will not be seen by thousands of people at<br />
a time as it might be in some other place, but w'hoever comes<br />
here and looks at it and remembers its history will, I believe,<br />
feel that he's had his own spirit" touched and refreshed iy<br />
contemplating, i. rhat man can do, what man can endure, -whrat<br />
wonderful lovely qualities in man can survive every kind of<br />
t rial. I remember early in 1941 at Chsavers in England,<br />
sitting after dinner with 4finston Churchill and he was kind<br />
enough to say something to me, to deliver his philosop,-, y to me<br />
in a sentence, as I know he has to other people, but I was<br />
lucky to hear it myself on that occasion. This was early in<br />
1941, when there was no second front, when all the apostles<br />
of gloom were talking about defeat, when America was not in,<br />
vnen Great Britain had conducted the Battle for Britain and<br />
was under bombing attack every night, and I remember the great<br />
man turning to me and saying, " However long you live, remember<br />
this. This is the truth. In war, fury. In defeat, defiance.<br />
In victory, magnanimity, and in peace, goodwill." This I<br />
believe is a marvellous philosophy and it might well be borne<br />
in mind by all of us as we look at this memorial to wonderful<br />
fighting men and as I take the opportunity and give myself<br />
the honour of unveiling a plaque on this occasion, </p>
