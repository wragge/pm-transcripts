PRESS, RADIO AND TELEVISION CONFERENCE<br />
GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, SENATOR<br />
JOHN GORTON, AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA 17TH JANUARY, 1968<br />
PRIME MINISTER Well, gentlemen, this is a press conference for the<br />
purpose of enabling you to ask me questions In the hope that I will be<br />
able to provide some sort of an answer to them. It Is not an occaabn<br />
for me to make a statement but rather an occasion for you to raise<br />
matters which are In your minds.<br />
Q. V/ hat action will you take If you get a bad answer today?<br />
PM: Well, we don't know of course what the answer of the<br />
Union Is. They haven't yet decided as far as I know. But we will be<br />
forced to seek to keep the . kustrallan mails moving. We hope that<br />
commonsense will prevail and that the Union will go back to work.<br />
That Is our objective. We don't quite know well I don't quite knowwhy<br />
this inconvenience shouli be Inflicted on the Australian people<br />
with such a history of events. Let me remind you of that history.<br />
On the 11th, I think It was, a driver was dismissed. On the 12th,<br />
agreement was reached for the reinstatement of that driver.<br />
Subsequently there was a stoppage and I received a telegram from<br />
the Union saying would I accelerate a meeting with the Public Service<br />
Board from the date on which it was previously agreed to be held, and<br />
I said yes, I would, so there is no dispute about the driver being<br />
reinstated, there is no dispute about an accelerated meeting, provided<br />
the men to back to normal work. There has been no attempt to<br />
invoke any punitive clauses but the strike may go on. I don't believe<br />
that any Australian Government could sit back and not attempt to move<br />
the mail whatever the circumstances might be. Now, you would not<br />
expect me, indeed I think It would be a matter for the Postmaster-<br />
General and the Minister for Labour and National Service to explain<br />
the steps that they would hope to take should such steps be necessary<br />
as I hope they won't be.<br />
Q. Jack Commins, ABC: Can you give us your initial<br />
reaction to Prime Minister Wilson's announced cuts of yesterday?<br />
Will there be any speeding up of the review by the Defence Comm ittee<br />
of Cabinet?<br />
PM: Well, I think we have already given a reaction to the<br />
announced cuts because they are more or less in line with what was<br />
suggested to us would happen by Mr Thomson when he was out here,<br />
and we made a press statement after that, you will remember,<br />
expressing great regrets that these ctitm-should take place, expressifig<br />
our belief that in this part of the world Singapore, Malaysia In<br />
that area, relatively small forces could contribute far beyond their<br />
numbers to the maintenance of a security in the area which would<br />
enable a proper economic development In the area. And we expressed<br />
some concern that the Naval and Air supports, quickly and speedily<br />
available in the area if necessary, appeared to be In doubt. Our<br />
reaction to that is the same as It was then. We feel that If economic<br />
considerations are those which has made the British Government make<br />
this decision, then savings could better be made In some other part<br />
of the world If we are concerned with keeping security. Other than<br />
that I can't go any further than I have before, except to say, as<br />
perhaps is known to you, that the British Government has extended / 2 </p>
<p>( do&amp; t period of their -withdcrawalof ground-forces by nine months after<br />
discussions with Australia and the other countries concernied, and<br />
It will now be 1 think It is four years, December 31st, 1971, before<br />
the proposed plans are completed. We are pleased that this extension<br />
has taken place.<br />
Q. Now that you know the British plans, Prime M! rIister, and<br />
In view of the guns or butter economic evolutionary pro.,. Qss that we<br />
are going on with now, could you undertake to make a statement or<br />
bring out a Defence White Paper which would outline clearly the<br />
responsibilities that we are going to have to undertake over the next<br />
two years?<br />
PM: I'll discuss that with the Minister for Defence and the Defence<br />
and Foreign Affairs Committee. But I think It must be clear that we<br />
ourselves cannot step in and fill the place that Britain has been filling<br />
in that part of the world. We would want to lend assistance as we<br />
are now, provided the countries there continued to want us to lend<br />
that assistance and said so, but there Is a limit I think to the amount<br />
that a country such as ours can afford to expend on defence because<br />
there are requirements of development, requirements of immigration,<br />
requirements of looking after our own population which at Bome stage<br />
must be considered as being something from which, in effect, has<br />
some effect on Australia's defence potential rather than the mere<br />
guns and ammunition which also have a direct effect. The amount that<br />
we are expending on defence Is quite large. You mentioned guns and<br />
butter. I don't know whether it's guns and butter exactly, but guns<br />
and development and human relations in our own country must be<br />
brought into a balance. I'll consider a statement In more detail,<br />
although I think that this might have to wait perhaps untI there are<br />
further discussions, until we are a bit clearer as to precisely what is<br />
meant by one or two matters mentioned In Mr Wilson's speech, and<br />
until we are a little clearer as to what the five powers concerned<br />
might In concert do.<br />
Q. Max Hawkins, Brisbane Telegraph: Do you see this<br />
withdrawal as the end of the British Commonwealth Brigade there, or<br />
do you see some other battalions or forces that the British are taking<br />
out coming In to fill the gap,? Have we been asked to<br />
PM: As I understand it, the British ground forces are, at the<br />
end of the period to which I have been referring, to be withdrawn<br />
from the area. If that Is so, and they now being a component part<br />
of the Commonwealth Brigade, I don't see how the Commonwealth<br />
Brigade would continue after that date.<br />
Q. Armfield, Melbourne Age: Will Britain's decision to<br />
scrap its Fill have any effect on the cost of the Australian order?<br />
PM: This Is something I propose to find out quite rapidly but<br />
can't tell you now.<br />
Q. Will you be making a statement to Parliament very soon and<br />
how soon will Parliament meet?<br />
PM-. Padfament will meet in March, but whether in the second or<br />
third week in March might depend a little on events but let's say<br />
the second or third week In March. And I would think that, yes, there<br />
ought to be a statement made to Parliament on a matter of this<br />
Importance as soon as may be after It meets. a. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, have you any details yet on the programme<br />
of the meeting of the five powers affected by British withdrawal from<br />
South-East Asia?<br />
PM: No. No details. Indeed, I don't believe there are any details,<br />
Idon't believe there are any firm proposals as to when such a meqtIng<br />
should take place. You will remember that Tunku Abdul Rahman<br />
suggested some time ago that there should be such a meeting. The<br />
then Prime Minister Indicated that Australia was interested in attending<br />
such a meeting If and when It was held, but the other powers had to<br />
express their views on it too. I noticed that Mr Wilson in his statpment<br />
s aid, If I recall it correctly, he would be Interested In a five-power<br />
conference but such five-power conference must start from the premise<br />
of the decisions taken by the British Government. We, for our part,<br />
would attend such a five-power contdrence but we are not at the moment<br />
Intending to Initiate or call for It.<br />
Q. Sir, on the Post Office again. Do you have any thoughts as to<br />
a long-term solution of the problems in the Post Office because every<br />
time there is a dispute it holds up communications of the country, as<br />
we have seen In the past year?<br />
PM: Well, I think It's a pretty hard sort of a question, If I may say<br />
so, to ask a Prime Minister at this stage. The running of the Post<br />
Office Is the responsibility of the Postmaster -General and the Public<br />
Service Board also comes Into the picture. There has been, as you so<br />
rightly say, a number of disruptions In the Post Office. I would hope that<br />
we could, through the responsible Ministers, and I would include the<br />
Minister for Labour and National Service in that, although they are<br />
really a client Ministry for the Postmaster -General, to see whether<br />
there was some underlying malaise which could be removed. But that<br />
is a matter of looking into seeing whether there Is some underlying<br />
malaise, to see what action could be taken If It Is there. I don't think<br />
it Is directly concerned with the Immediate problem which faces us<br />
today. But it is something clearly that needs to be looked at.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, I am sure that the war In Viet Nam must<br />
be a priority for your consideration, and In view of this, I wondered<br />
whether you would care to comment on the statement by Senator Mike<br />
Mansfield, the Leader of the Majority In the Senate of America In<br />
which he this week called for an end of the bombing In North Viet Nam<br />
and an effort to persuade Hanoi to enter Into peace trks. VWhat would<br />
your opinion be about this?<br />
PM: Well, my opinion on the bombing of North Viet Nam Is this.<br />
In the first place, tile United States could, If It wanted to, because it<br />
has the power to do It If it wanted to, virtually destroy North Viet Nam.<br />
It has not used that power and I would strongly be opposed to it ever<br />
seeking to use such power In that way. What it has been doing Is using<br />
bombing In an attempt to interdict, to interfere with, to delay the flow<br />
of men and materials from the North to the South. If there were a<br />
clear indication that shoukd that type of bombing cease, then the North<br />
Vietnamese would, for their part, stop serxi-ig men and supplies to the<br />
South and start talks so that during the period of time when such<br />
talks were taking place there was neither bombing of the North nor<br />
sending of the troops or mateilals to the South by the North, then I<br />
would consider that a reasonable proposition. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Q. John Jost of the Age: Has there been a decision on the<br />
Victorian Turnover Tax, specially with regard to Commonwealth<br />
Public Service salary?<br />
PM: WNell, that Is a matter under discussion between myself and<br />
the Victorian Premier at the moment.<br />
Q. Did you raise this with him yesterday, Sir, when you spoke<br />
to him?<br />
PM: I made a courtesy call yesterday.<br />
Q. Chalmers, Australian Press Services: Mr Prime Minister,<br />
has Cabinet, or will Cabinet consider an official enquiry Into the<br />
disappearance of Mr Holt?<br />
DM: The answer to that is no. There has been an enquiry by the<br />
Victorian Police Irto all the events of that tragic day. The report has<br />
been presented. In view of some of the matter printed1 in It which<br />
has perhaps led to your question, I propose to make the report the<br />
Victorian Police have compiled available. It will require a day or two<br />
to get it copied in sufficient numbers for everybody to have It, but I<br />
think there Is no need to go any further than that.<br />
Q. Stephens, Adelaide Advertiser: For the past eighteen nmonths,<br />
there have been discussions going on at the Service level about the<br />
future British defence role In Australia, In the Australian ar--a. In<br />
view of the latest decisions, do you feel those talks are worthwhile<br />
continuing?<br />
PM: Well, yes, I think they are worthwhile continuing. The<br />
British Government and the Minister who was out here have expressed<br />
the view that defence arrangements are useful even though there are<br />
no Immediate forces In the particular area that Is being discussed to<br />
enable those arrangements to be put straight away Into practice, and<br />
there may be something In this. Anyway, let me put It this way.<br />
They are not talks which I would seek to break off ourselves.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, In view of your quite obvious sympathy<br />
for Mr Lee of Singapore and his plight, Is Australia prepared to<br />
consider giving him interim assistance during the period such as, for<br />
example, paying for the Gurkha brigade battalions or something of<br />
that nature or, at this stage, is our assistance merely restricted to<br />
the planning side of it?<br />
PM: No, at this stage, we are giving assistance to Mr Lee In<br />
Singapore. The details of that assistance I don't carry in my mind, but<br />
we are giving both economic assistance and military assistance in<br />
various ways in that field. It Is not Intended, nor has it been suggested<br />
that that should be accelerated or increased at this moment.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, there has been a proposal for the<br />
estal ishment of a naval facility in Western Australia. Now I add<br />
another one to this, there has also been the question of the future of<br />
Woomera at stake. Is the decision made by the British Government<br />
likely to affect both Woomera and the Western Australian naval<br />
facility?<br />
PM: I can't answer that question. I don't know enough at the moment<br />
to answer It. I'm sorry. </p>
<p>Q. John Moses, Channel 7: In the absence of Britain, how do<br />
you see broadly our defence and economic responsibilities to our<br />
Asian neighbours, Including Indonesia?<br />
PM: Our economic responsibilities, particularly to our closest<br />
Asian neighbours, to Singapore, to Malaysia, to Indonesia, to the<br />
Philippines but I think we are talking of the area Indonesia,<br />
Malaysia, Singapore. this Is the area In which I would like to see<br />
our major effort made in this economic assistance field. But there<br />
are two provisos to that. One is that the countries themselves wish<br />
for some physical forces present as an Insurance policy against the<br />
Insurgencies, an Insurance policy against brushfire wars, not of<br />
course with any concept of preventing a full-scale Invasion from some<br />
other place but just to keep the peace in that particular area, to keep<br />
the peace against small outbreaks in that particular area. So that<br />
also is a field to which we have contributed, and that proviso cuts down,<br />
to some extent, wh,-t we can do in the economic field. The second<br />
proviso Is the one I started with, that Australia has to consider its<br />
own development, Its own requirements In many fields, in health, In<br />
education in social services, apart from development Itself;<br />
It has to keep its immigration going, it has to develop its industrial<br />
muscles and Its potential for the future. And these things cannot be<br />
sacrificed to greater use either of overseas reserves which are heavily<br />
called on by defence commitments or defence commitments In other<br />
ways.<br />
Q. In Commonwealth/ State financial relationships, you have been<br />
described as something of a centralist. Could you state your general<br />
attitude on this rather touchy subject?<br />
PM: Yes, I think so. I don't think it is an accurate assessment of<br />
my psotion to call me a centralist. It Is more a matter of philosophical<br />
approach. I would have thought a centrd 1st was somebody who wanted<br />
to take a field and to centralise the administration of that field In<br />
Canberra through one public service, as it were, and that In the fields<br />
In which the States are so heavily engaged would, in my view be<br />
inefficient and wrong; particularly in such fields as education, I am<br />
sure It would be wrong. On the other hand, we have a theory that the<br />
proper thing to be done In Australia is to hand out sums of money to<br />
various State Governments and leave it entirely to those State<br />
Governments to divide those sums of money between the various<br />
competing fields Inside that State between education and health, and<br />
building of roads and all the other things the States have to do. Now,<br />
in general, I would of course agree with ths, but In particular one could<br />
find the situation developing where from the national interest, scmethinig<br />
was being neglected in one of the six States and that State was falling<br />
behind the other States in that field and this could be detrimental to<br />
Australia as a whole. I think that It Is this kind of approach of mine,<br />
I think It Is a kind of approach of, well, If water Is to be conserved<br />
In Australia, it ought to be conserved where Its conservation will do<br />
most-good for the nation as a whole, even if It means that It is in some<br />
particular State where it would do the most good for the nation as a<br />
whole, and therefore the money Is not divided strictly on a population<br />
basis because we need it to be down there. That's where the water<br />
that's where we get the most effectiveness from It, and therefore we<br />
just don't divide it on a formula around the States. These are<br />
qualifications which I put to the theory of complete handing over of the , o / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
PM<br />
( Contd.) money and leaving it completely to the States to develop. This, I<br />
think, Is the basis of a charge of being a centralist, but as I say, I<br />
don't think It is a properly-based charge because I would not seek<br />
to interfere In administration nor, unless It could be shown to be<br />
something that were detrimental to the national interest, to try and<br />
keep a balance In the fields between the States.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, when do you meet the State Premiers<br />
to discuss these matters?<br />
PM: I know what you when do we have a general<br />
conference. But I think it worth saying that I have alzmdy had a<br />
courtesy call on Sir Henry Bolte. I will be meeting Mr Pizzey on<br />
Thursday. I will be having a chat with Mr Asldn during the weekend.<br />
These are just talks to Individual Premiers. I don't know that I<br />
could give you a timetable for a Premiers' meeting now because there<br />
are a number of unknown factors, a number of unusual circumstances<br />
just at the moment which make things awkward, but we would have<br />
one as soon as we reasonably could....<br />
Q. Is it imminent, before the next Parliamentary Session?<br />
PM: I don't think it is before the next Parliamentary Session.<br />
I wouldn't rule out the possibility that it might be.<br />
Q. Would you consider redistribution during the current<br />
Parliament?<br />
PM: A redistribution of seats? Yes.<br />
Q. Have you decided upon the Commissioners, Sir?<br />
PM: I haven't had a great deal of experience with these press<br />
conferences and I might be putting my foot In it. I think what has<br />
to be done is that the Commissioners are provided by the various<br />
State Governments... ( 1-terruption) let me finish The Commissioners<br />
need to be provided by the various State Governments and I am not<br />
sure whether I am at liberty to answer that direct question, but let us<br />
put it this way that the State Governments know whom It Is that we<br />
would wish to be provided as Commissiorers.<br />
Q. I was thinking of the time factor. Mr Holt said he thought<br />
they would be announced by the end of the year that has just ended,<br />
and we are running out of time on the....<br />
PM: I don't think it will be long.<br />
Q. I see. Do you expect any trouble from the Country Party<br />
this time?<br />
PM: Why should I?<br />
Q. Nancy Buttfleld, Macquaie Network, Adelaide:<br />
Prime Minister, will you be looking into a new basis for grants<br />
for the States?<br />
PM: Do you mean a new formula? ** 9a / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Q. A new way of allocating the grants.<br />
PM: Oh, I hadn't thought of it but one never knows what might come<br />
up at these conferences.<br />
Q. Stewart Harris, London Times: I was wondering, Sir, if<br />
there was trouble in the Malaysian/ Indonesian area, say over the next<br />
couple of years, would you feel free to withdraw any Australian battalion<br />
from Viet Nam, temporarily if necessary, and do you have such an<br />
understanding with the South Vietnamese and American Governments?<br />
PM: I know of no such understanding with the South Vietnamese or<br />
American Government. You asked me this question out of the blue.<br />
I know of no understanding, but it would seem to me that it would be<br />
a very odd military situation to be in, to have a battalion integrated<br />
In a force, engaged in opeations, liable to be withdrawn and disrupt<br />
all the people with . vhom it was serving. I should think It quite unlikely.<br />
Q. Sir, In the light of your emphasis here today on development,<br />
are you yourself wedded to the concept that has prevailed in the<br />
Government that defence spending should be limited to 5 per cent of<br />
gross national product cr are you liable to take a more flexible view<br />
In the light of the quick march of events in South-Ems t Asia?<br />
PM: I wouldn't want to pin mysBlf to a particular percentage of GNP,<br />
whether it be five or four or three or any particular percentage of GNP,<br />
but I would hope, indeed It will be necessary to see that our expenditure<br />
on defence, a good deal of which is already committed for the next<br />
two years, does not cause us such commitments then or after then that<br />
it interferes not with butter but with the development of Australia.<br />
Q. just to take you back to the Premiers and the States/ Commonwealth<br />
financial relations for a moment, are you prepared to go ahead<br />
with the usual Premiers' Conference that is usually held in February and<br />
also will you go ahead with this proposal of Mr Holt's to have a meeting<br />
of Liberal Premiers<br />
PM: Well, the meeting of Liberal Fr emiers is what I call a family<br />
meeting. It is not a meeting which the Government as such is concerned<br />
in having. It is not a meeting Indeed in which Liberal Premiers alone<br />
attend. It would be a meeting which the Liberal leaders of the various<br />
States, whether they were Premiers or whether they were Treasurers or<br />
Leaders of the Opposition would meet with members of the LiAbaral<br />
Party In the Commonwealth sphere for a family discussion, and that is<br />
all it would be. It is not something that can be equated with a Premiers'<br />
meeting or something of that kind, and I think that the tim~ etable'that<br />
was in mind has been disrupted and it is very difficult to fix a date but<br />
I would in princre expect that that should happen.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, the relations with the Country Party have<br />
just been mentioned. I would like to ask you what action you have taken<br />
or propose to take to heal the breach between Mr McEwen and Mr<br />
McMahon?<br />
PM: Well, we are starting a new Government. I. was never closely<br />
associated with events in the last Government to which you refer, but<br />
as far as I am concerned, at the sta rt of this new Government, the<br />
book should be ruled off there, and a new start made. e 9 / 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
Q. Is that feasible, Sir, In the light of discussions that ; have<br />
gone on between the two Ministers?<br />
PM: I hope and trust so&amp;<br />
Q. Will you yourself, Sir, be Influenced in your choice of a<br />
Cabinet by any considerations of the strained feelings that have<br />
existed between the Country Party and the Liberal Party, or will<br />
you be guided by uour choice of whom you consider the best person<br />
for a portfolio?<br />
PM: You said would I be Influenced in my -choice of a Cabinet<br />
Is that what you mean, or do you want to go further than that?<br />
Q. The Ministry in the broad.<br />
PM: I would not expect, indeed I know that Mr McEwen would<br />
not expect that any people chosen by Liberals would be subject to<br />
question or to veto by himself any more than he would expect any<br />
Country Party Minister to be subject to question by myself. I think<br />
he has made his situation quite clear, that he regards it as his<br />
prerogative, and has regarded It as his prerogative to say who It is<br />
that he will or will. not E erve under but that he regards that as the<br />
limit to which he should go.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, do you have any plans at this stage for a<br />
tour of South-East Asia or perhaps even further afield to meet with<br />
other world leaders?<br />
PM: I want to go to South-East Asia as soon as it is possible to<br />
do so, but I do have things which you have been mentioning to me in<br />
the course of this press conference possible meetings with Liberal<br />
leaders, possible meet ingswith State Premiers, by-elections one<br />
by-election meeting of the Parliament, getting prepared for that,<br />
and I don't see much chance cf this happening until after the first<br />
Session of the Parliament this year.<br />
Q. Talking about by -elections, Sir, can you give us the date<br />
of the opening of the campaign, and your appearance in Higgins?<br />
PM: The 13th February that is, if I am pre-selected!<br />
Q. How long do you intend to spend in Higgins, Sir?<br />
PM: During my campaign?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM: I would expect to spend some days there, not necessarily<br />
on end, but a number of scattered days during t he course of the<br />
campaign in the electorate. Partly I would be Influenced on this by<br />
the requests of the organisation in the area and the Liberal Party<br />
in Victoria.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, In the formation of your new Ministry, do you<br />
plan to keep the same number of portfolios? Do you plan to keep the<br />
same number of Ministers?<br />
PM: Probably. 0 0 0 / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Q. On the assumption, Sir, that you win Higgins, how soon<br />
after the by-election is declared, will you be remaking your Ministry?<br />
PM: I would hope to announce a new Ministry and possibly some<br />
different administrative arrangement orders as between the<br />
Departments within two days, I think.<br />
Q. H-ow strong is the possibility of an early election, Sir?<br />
PM: I haven't considered the possibility of an early election<br />
myself.<br />
Q. In selecting your new Ministry, Sir, would you be influenced<br />
strongly by the number of Ministers from particular States or would<br />
you select the men for their own sake?<br />
PM: I would seek to select the men whom I bdl leved had the<br />
ability to carry out the work involved. I don ' t think you can entirely<br />
disregard some State representation. I don't think you could, for<br />
example it's a s illy example that you could leave the State of New<br />
South Wales without one Minister, or say Queensland or any other<br />
State or most States, but I would not be seeking to get a balance of<br />
members of the Ministry as between the States, but you would have to<br />
have some regard, as I have sa id, to some State representation.<br />
Q. And some regard to the Senate? Will that be fixed and<br />
absolute?<br />
PM: Well, in this life nothing is ever fixed and absolute, you<br />
should know that!<br />
Q. Sir, may you actually have a reduction of Ministers, is that<br />
what you....<br />
PM: No, It wasn't really meant that way. I haven't been thinking<br />
so much in terms of numbers on this, and you asked me so I didn't<br />
want to say definitely" e" in case it turned out there was some<br />
slight difference, so I Bald " probably".<br />
Q. Are you likely to be making administrative reshuffles within<br />
the Ministry, combining some portfolios and creating new ones?<br />
PM: Well, there will be some changes In administrative<br />
arrangements orders which are the orders which provide functions<br />
for particular portfolios, or at any rate there are some which are<br />
under consideration at the moment. But I think that is about enough<br />
on that one!<br />
Q. Sir, because of the decisions of Britain and the United States<br />
over the past few months which have a direct effect on us, have.-you<br />
given any consideration to a supplementary Budget?<br />
PM: Not yet. At this stage I have . had no Indication of a<br />
supplementary Budget.<br />
Q. Sir, you have spoken of the need to visit South-East Asia,<br />
have you given any thought yet to a tour of Australia as Prime Minister?<br />
0 0/ 10 </p>
<p>10<br />
PM: Well in this week I will have been in Victoria, New South<br />
Wales and Queensland. That is a tour of half Australia in the first<br />
week, or an appearance in half of the States of Australia in the first<br />
week. Of course It is not so long since a Senate election in which the<br />
other three States were also visited. I am not sure whether you<br />
mean will I wish to be travelling around to look at all the development<br />
projects tl-roughout Australia. Perhaps that was in your mind?<br />
Q. This would include part of it. ' Yes Sir.<br />
PM: Well, no, I don't think so. Really, I honestly think I have<br />
been travelling around Australia over the last four or five or six or<br />
seven years pretty solidly and pretty continuously. i would hope to go<br />
and see particular development projects but this is not a tour in the<br />
sense of a South-E.-ast Asian country tour.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, after Britain's decision to devalue,<br />
the Cabinet set, up a framework of m easares to deal with the<br />
repercussions on Austra lia. Could you tell us what progress has<br />
been made with those moves and how soon we may expect decisions<br />
to be made?<br />
PM: Well, I think we are waiting for assessments from the<br />
Department of Trade and Industry in relation to any secondary<br />
industries which may have suffered losses as a result of the Government's<br />
decision, and from the Department of Primary Industry in<br />
relation to any industries there which may have suffered losses.<br />
And when I say " suffered losses'tI mean suffered losses, not<br />
" failed to get gains".<br />
Q. Vhen will that Committee be reporting There is an<br />
inter -Departmental Commnittee considering this question?<br />
PM: I will have to ask the Ministers directly concerned.<br />
MR EGGLETON: Perhaps one more question, gentlemen.<br />
Q. Prior to DIr Holt's death, Sir, there was a lot of talk<br />
about a Viet Nam summit meeting. Has this now been negated because<br />
of the series of talk. s that were held in Canberra during the period<br />
of the Memorial Service or do you anticipate there will be a Viet<br />
Nam summit?<br />
PM: I.-thlnk there probably will be meetings of people leading<br />
the nations concerned, but I know of no time set down for it and no<br />
arrangements at this stage which have been made for it.<br />
Thank you, gentlemen. </p>
