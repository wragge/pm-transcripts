C 14E C:-j AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. R. J, HAWKE, MP.<br />
PRESS CLUB<br />
BRISBANE AUGUST 1983<br />
As I SAID AT THE BRISBANE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ON<br />
MONDAY, THE TIMING OF THIS EXTENSIVE VISIT TO QUEENSLAND<br />
IS ENTIRELY FORTUITOUS. IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO<br />
WITH THE REMARKABLE EVENTS NOW UNFOLDING; AND OF COURSE,<br />
NO ONE COULD HAVE FORESEEN THEMI<br />
AND OF COURSE, I'D BE THE LAST PERSON TO WANT TO<br />
INTRUDE ON MR BJELKE-PETERSEN'S PROBLEMS; AND I DON'T<br />
PARTICULARLY WISH TO CANVASS THE POLITICAL CRISIS INTO WHICH<br />
QUEENSLAND HAS BEEN PLUNGED SO SUDDENLY.<br />
BUT I MIGHT JUST SAY THAT IT IS JUST AS WELL FOR THE<br />
PEOPLE OF QUEENSLAND THAT MR PETERSEN DOESN'T APPLY TO HIMSELF<br />
AND TO HIS ASSOCIATION WITH LABOR PEOPLE THE SAME STANDARDS<br />
THAT HE APPLIES TO HIS COALITION PARTNERS.<br />
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT MR PETERSEN HAD NO<br />
DIFFICULTY AT ALL IN TAKING FROM A LABOR PRIME MINISTER AND<br />
A LABOR TREASURER, AN EXTRA $ 31 MILLION FOR QUEENSLAND WHICH<br />
WE OFFERED AT THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE. AND THAT $ 31 MILLION<br />
WOULD ENABLE THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT, IF IT HAD ANY<br />
MANAGERIAL CAPACITY, TO INTRODUCE A WIDE RANGE OF NEW ACTIVITIES<br />
TO PROMOTE RECOVERY WITHOUT HAVING TO INCREASE ITS OWN TAXES. </p>
<p>IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR QUEENSLAND<br />
THAT THERE SHOULD BE STABLE GOVERNMENT HERE TO ALLOW THE<br />
STATE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INITIATIVES WE HAVE<br />
TAKEN. FOR THE FACT IS THAT THERE CAN BE NO<br />
BROADLY-BASED NAT IONAL* ECONOMIC RECOVERY UNLESS<br />
QUEENSLAND PARTICIPATES IN IT, AND SHARES IN ITS BENEFITS,<br />
AND THAT, OF COURSE, IS WHY THE PRESENT<br />
EXTRAORDINARY POLITICAL CRISIS IN QUEENSLA1ND IS A<br />
MATTER OF NATIONAL CONCERN.<br />
BECAUSE, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY<br />
ESSENTIAL FOR STEADY NATIONAL RECOVERY IS STABILITY<br />
AND PREDICTABILITY. THAT IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO<br />
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN QUEENSLAND AS MUCH AS<br />
ANYWHERE IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
BUSINESS COMMUNITY, TO A DEGREE NOT KNOWN IN AUSTRALIA<br />
SINCE THE WAR, WITHDREW THEIR POSITIVE SUPPORT FOR<br />
OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS IN THE LAST FEDERAL ELECTIONS;<br />
AND EVEN TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, TRANSFERRED THAT SUPPORT<br />
To LABOR, 13<br />
I </p>
<p>-3-<br />
TtII AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS CO-MUNITY HAD BECOME<br />
DISENCHANTED AND DISTURBED BY THE POLITICAL INSTABILITY<br />
AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF POLICY WHICH HAD COME TO CHARACTERISE<br />
THE COALITION GOVERNMENT OF OUR PREDECESSORS.<br />
BUSINESS CANNOT PLAN EFFECTIVELY, CANNOT TAKE<br />
THE INITIATIVES AND SOMETIMES, THE RISKS, ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
THE CREATION OF NEW JOBS, IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNPREDICTABILITY<br />
AND INSTABILITY. AND THE EVENTS IN QUEENSLAND OVER THE PAST FEW<br />
DAYS HAVE PROVIDED A RECIPE FOR INSTABILITY UNKNOWN IN<br />
QUEENSLAND FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.<br />
THERE IS NOW NO POSSIBLE PERMUTATION OR COMBINATION<br />
OF COALITION POLITICIANS WHICH COULD RESTORE STABILITY TO<br />
QUEENSLAND, THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE PEOPLE<br />
THEMSELVES. AND BECAUSE OF QUEENSLAND'S SIGNIFICANCE IN THE<br />
NATIONAL ECONOMY, IT WILL BE SOMETHING WHICH AUSTRALIANS<br />
EVERYWHERE WILL WATCH WITH INTEREST AND CONCERN, s/ 4 </p>
<p>AND OF COURSE IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF<br />
QUEENSLAND'S SIGNIFICANCE, IN TERMS OF THE NATION, THAT<br />
I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO MAKE QUEENSLAND MY FIRST<br />
MAJOR VISIT OUTSIDE THE CAPITALS, AS SOON AS THE BASIC<br />
WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEW GOVERNMENT AND LAYING DOWN THE<br />
FOUNDATIONS FOR THE NEW ECONOMIC PROGRAM THE PROGRAM<br />
OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION,, RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTIONHAD<br />
BEEN COMPLETED. AND THAT IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING<br />
OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS.<br />
IN THE POLICY SPEECH I SAID THIS:<br />
" WE OFFER NO MIRACLES. WE OFFER NO OVERNIGHT<br />
SOLUTIONS FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRO1BLEMS WE FACE OR<br />
THE DEEP-SEATED PROBLEMS WE MUST FACE TOGETHER...<br />
WHAT I DO OFFER IS A PROGRAM TO PRODUCE GROWTH<br />
AND EXPANSION IN THE ECONOMY,, ACHIEVABLE GOALS<br />
FOR THE REBUILDING AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THIS NATION."<br />
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS INITIAL PERIOD IS TO LAY FIRM<br />
FOUNDATIONS TO FULFIL OUR COMMITMENTS OVER THE TERM OF<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT AND BEYOND.<br />
OUR OVERRIDING CONCERN HAS BEEN TO RESTORE BALANCE<br />
TO THE ECONOMY AND TO ESTABLISH THE BASIS FOR SUSTAINED<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH, </p>
<p>IF WE ARE TO SERIOUSLY TACKLE UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
IF WE ARE TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS OF ALL<br />
AUSTRALIJANS WE MUST LIFT AUSTRALIA' S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE<br />
WE MUST ACHIEVE A RETURN TO GROWTH,<br />
I BELIEVE A RETURN TO ECONOMIC GROWTH IS NOW<br />
IN SIGHT. THIS GROWTH SHOULD START TO GATHER PACE DURING<br />
THE COURSE OF THIS FINANCIAL YEAR.<br />
To CREATE THE BASIS FOR THIS EMERGING GROWTH,<br />
WE HAVE HAD TO TAKE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS,<br />
THE MAY ECONOMIC STATEMENT CONTAINED SOME HARD<br />
DECISIONS, AND THE BUDGET TO BE BROUGHT DOWN ON 23 AUGUST<br />
WILL CONTINUE TO EXERCISE THAT FIRMNESS,<br />
RECOVERY CANNOT BE PAINLESSLY ACHIEVED OR QUICKLY<br />
ACHIEVED. GIVEN THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WAS EXPLODING WHEN WE CAME<br />
TO OFFICE, IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME EVEN TO COMPLETELY HALT<br />
THE GROWTH OF UNEMPLOYMENT, LET ALONE ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT<br />
REDUCTIONS. ms. A </p>
<p>WHILE INFLATION SHOULD FALL SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
OVER THE NEXT YEAR, UNLES-S MORE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IS<br />
MADEj THE CAPACITY OF MUCH OF OUR ECONOMY TO CONTRIBUTE<br />
TO GROWTH WILL BE PUT UNDER GREAT STRAIN.<br />
THE PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH WILL ALSO BE PUT AT<br />
RISK UNLESS WE ENSURE THAT THE DEFICIT IS REINED IN<br />
AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR RECOVERS.<br />
THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO AVOID PUTTING UPWARD<br />
PRESSURE ON INTEREST RATES AND SO WEAKENING THE PROSPECTS<br />
FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT.<br />
I WAN4T TO NOW TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IN<br />
BRISBANE TO SPEAK ABOUT OUR POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND<br />
EXPANSION IN A NUMBER OF KEY AREAS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY<br />
RELEVANT TO OUEENSLANDERS.<br />
LET ME BEGIN WITH OUR MINERALS AND ENERGY POLICIES.<br />
OUR AIM IS TO ESTABLISH A STABLE CLIMATE FOR<br />
LONG-TERM INVESTMENT IN THE MINING AND ENERGY INDUSTRIES.<br />
TO THIS END THE GOVERNMENT IS MOVING TO<br />
ESTABLISH CLEAR AND CONSISTENT POLICIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF AUSTRALIA'S MINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES,<br />
WE ARE PRESENTLY REVIEWING FOREIGN INVESTMENT<br />
POLICY IN ORDER THAT CLEAR GUIDELINES ARE AVAILABLE TO<br />
INVESTORS -AND THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS To AUSTRALIA FROM FORE IGN<br />
PARTICIPATION ARE MAXU'MISED. 1 / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS DEVELOPING A PROPOSAL FOR<br />
A RESOURCE RENT TAX WHICH WOULD RATIONALISE THE PRESENT<br />
COMPLEX AND ARBITRARY SYSTEM OF TAXES, ROYALTIES AND<br />
OTHER CHARGES ON MINING AND ENERGY PROJECTS.<br />
-WE LOOK TO CO-OPERATION WITH THE STATES AND<br />
INDUSTRY IN DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO PROVIDE THE<br />
FULLEST SUPPORT FOR SECURING OVERSEAS MARKETS FOR AUSTRALIA'S<br />
RESOURCE EXPORTS. RIGHT NOW THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER<br />
FOR TRADE, LIONEL BOWEN, IS OVERSEAS, ENGAGED IN A SERIES<br />
OF TALKS IN JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA TO SECURE<br />
AND ENHANCE AUSTRALIA'S RESOURCE EXPORT MARKETS.<br />
I NOW TURN TO ANOTHER MAJOR AREA OF CONCERN FOR<br />
OUEENSLANDERS, THAT OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE.<br />
THIS HAS A SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
AGRICULTURE. CONTRIBUTES ALMOST HALF OF OUR EXPORT EARNINGS.<br />
WE ARE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF MANY<br />
AGRICULTURAL COM'MODITIES ENTERING INTO WORLD TRADEPARTICULARLY<br />
BASIC FOODS SUCH AS WHEAT, BEEF,, SHEEPMEATS<br />
AND SUGAR. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
INFLUENCE PRICES, I 16/ </p>
<p>-9-<br />
THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION BETWEEN<br />
PRODUCING AND CONSUMING COUNTRIES IN DEALING WITH COMMODITY<br />
TRADE PROBLEMS IS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE.<br />
WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS THE PROBLEMS WHICH PERSISTENTLY<br />
AFFECT OUR TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES ARISE FROM<br />
POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS,<br />
THE MOST VISIBLE OF THESE POLICIES IS THE<br />
EUROPEAN ECONOiMIC COMMUNITY'S ( EEC) Commoti AGRICULTURAL<br />
PO L ICY, THIS HAS DONE GREAT DAMAGE TO THE AGRICULTURAL<br />
EXPORTS OF AUSTRALIA AS WELL AS TO OTHER MAJOR AGRICULTURAL<br />
EXPORTERS. THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY HAS NOT ONLY<br />
GREATLY RESTRICTED ACCESS TO WESTERN EUROPEAN MARKETS,<br />
IT HAS ENCOURAGED A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE<br />
INEFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS BY THE EUROPEAN<br />
ECONOMIC COMMUNITY VIA ELABORATE ASSISTANCE MECHANISMS WITH<br />
SURPLUSES PUSHED OUT ONTO WORLD MARKETS AT SUBSIDISED PRICES.<br />
THIS IN TURN HAS SEVERELY DISTORTED WORLD AGRICULTUPJ<br />
TRADE BY DEPRESSING PRICES AND DISPLACING AUSTRALIAN AND<br />
' OTHER EXPORTERS FROM MARKETS WHICH THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY<br />
SUPPLIED AND LOCKING THEM OUT OF POTENTIAL NEW MARKETS, </p>
<p>IN MAYJ JOHN KERIN, OUR PRIMARY INDUSTRY MINISTER,<br />
VISITED BRUSSELS TO PRESS BEFORE THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC<br />
COMMUNITY THE NEED TO RESOLVE ISSUES RELATING TO<br />
EEC SUBSIDIES ON AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS AND To REVIEW ACCESS<br />
FOR AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS To EUROPE.<br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGARDS THIS AS A MATTER<br />
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE. WE MUST REINFORCE OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE AN<br />
IMPROVEMENT. THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT AUSTRALIAN SUGAR INDUSTRY<br />
IS ONE WHICH HAS SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF UNFAIR TRADING<br />
PRACTICES WHICH HAVE BEEN PURSUED BY THE EEC IN THE COURSE<br />
OF SUBSIDISING ITS WAY UP FROM BEING A NET IMPORTER OF SUGR<br />
TO THE WORLD'IS LARGEST EXPORTER.<br />
THE SUGAR QUESTION BECAME A MAJOR FRICTION POINT<br />
IN OUR TRADE RELATIONS WITH THE EEC, THE EEC REFUSED TO<br />
JOIN THE PRESENT INTERNATIONAL SUGAR AGREEMENT WHICH RELIES<br />
ON A SUPPLY MANAGEMENT MECHANISM, HAVING REGARD TO THE VAST<br />
INCREASE IN ITS EXPORTS OF SUGAR,, THE EEC's POLICIES<br />
FRUSTRATED THAT AGREEMENT.<br />
WE ARE CURRENTLY PLAYING A LEADING ROLE IN THE<br />
NEGOTIATION OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL SUGAR AGREEMENT.<br />
Its/ ll </p>
<p>-11-<br />
AND WE AND OTHER* MAJOR EXPORTERS ARE CONSULTING<br />
CLOSELY WITH THE EEC WITH THE AIM OF ENSURING THAT THE<br />
EEC WILL BE A MEMBER OF THE NEW AGREEMENT<br />
THE AIM OF SUCH A NEW AGREEMENT WOULD BE TO<br />
INTRODUCE STABILITY INTO THE WORLD SUGAR TRADE TO THE MUTUAL<br />
BENEFIT OF BOTH PRODUCING AND CONSUMING NATIONS.<br />
IN AN EFFORT TO COUNTER THE EFFECTS OF THE<br />
COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, THE UNITED STATES HAS RECENTLY<br />
RESORTED TO PROVIDING SUBSIDIES FOR EXPORTS OF PARTICULAR<br />
AGR ICULTURAL PRODUCTS.<br />
THIS HAS ACCENTUATED TENSIONS IN INTERNATIONAL<br />
AGRICULTURAL TRADE,<br />
SMALLER EXPORTING NATIONS, SUCH As AUSTRALIA,<br />
WHICH CANNOT JOIN THE SUBSIDY AND CREDIT RACE, WOULD OF<br />
COURSE BE THE LOSERS IF THE TWO itGANSi DO NOT EXERCISE<br />
RESTRAINT. WE . WILL BE ENDEAVOURING TO PERSUADE THE EEC AND<br />
THE UNITED STATES THAT SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE TO THE<br />
DETRIMENT OF ALL IN THE LONG TERM. / 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
BEEF IS ANOTHER EXPORT PRODUCT OF MAJOR INTEREST<br />
TO QUEENSLAND. IT TOO IS FEELING THE BRUNT OF OTHER COUNTRIES'<br />
UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES.<br />
THE INCREASI1NG ACCESS BEING PROVIDED BY JAPAN<br />
FOR IMPORTS OF GRAIN FED BEEF FROM' THE UNITED STATES HAS<br />
BEEN AT THE EXPENSE-OF BEEF IMPORTS FROM OTHER SOURCES,,<br />
PRINCIPALLY AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE UNITED STATES HAS ASKED AUSTRALIA TO ACCEPT<br />
VOLUNTARY RESTRAINTS ON EXPORTS OF BEEF TO THE UNITED STATES<br />
MARKET THIS YEAR.<br />
TO DATE THE U. S. OFFERS HAVE BEEN TOO LOW.<br />
NEGOTIATIONS ARE CONTINUING. AUSTRALIA IS SEEKING THE BEST<br />
POSSIBLE DEAL FOR OUR BEEF PRODUCTS.<br />
As YOU KNOW, I HAVE RECENTLY RETURNED FROM MY<br />
FIRST MAJOR-OVERSEAS VISIT AS PRIME MINISTER.<br />
IREMAIN CONVINCED OF THE NEED TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT<br />
THE NEGOTIATION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE<br />
GREATER AND MORE PREDICTABLE ACCESS TO OVERSEAS MARKETS FOR<br />
OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. </p>
<p>-13-<br />
AND I REPEAT THE COMMITMENT I MADE EARLIER THIS<br />
YEAR THAT MY GOVERNMENT WILL WORK HARD AT THE TASK OF<br />
DEVELOPING BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR SECURE ACCESS<br />
FOR OUR FARM AND FISHING PRODUCTS,<br />
QUEENSLAND HAS A SPECIAL INTEREST IN OUR RELATIONS<br />
WITH JAPAN,. OUR LARGEST TRADING PARTNER.<br />
OUR EXPORTS TO JAPAN IN 1982 REPRESENTED<br />
26 PERCENT OF TOTAL EXPORTS, WHILE IMPORTS FROM JAPAN WERE<br />
VALUED AT ALMOST $ A4.8 BILLION OR 20 PERCENT OF TOTAL IMPORTS.<br />
MINERALS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT HALF OUR TOTAL EXPORTS<br />
TO JAPAN WHILE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ACCOUNT FOR ANOTHER<br />
QUARTER. FOR TWO DECADES AUSTRALIA HAS EXPERIENCED RAPID<br />
GROWTH IN ITS E XPORT TRADE WITH JAPAN AND THIS HAS BEEN<br />
LINKED CLOSELY WITH JAPAN'S OWN ECONOMIC GROWTH$<br />
REGRETTABLY, WE DO NOT FORESEE THE SAME RATE OF<br />
GROWTH CONTINUING, EXPECIALLY IN OUR RESOURCES TRADE.<br />
WHILE OUR EXPORTS OF ENERGY AND INDUSTRIAL RAW<br />
MATERIALS WILL REMAIN LARGE IN AB3SOLUTE TERMS, PROSPECTS<br />
FOR FUTURE GROWTH OF EXPORTS OF THESE COMMODITIES ARE LESS<br />
THAN GENERALLY PERCEIVED AS RECENTLY AS ONE YEAR AGO.<br />
WE NEED TO BROADEN OUR TRADE INTERESTS IN JAPAN<br />
BY SEEKING OUT TRADE OPPORTUNITIES IN THOSE SECTORS OF THE<br />
JAPANESE ECONOMY WHICH ARE GROWING FAST. / 14 </p>
<p>I BEGAN MY REMARKS BY SPEAKING OF my GOVERNMENT'S<br />
COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING THE ECONOMY AND IDENTIFYING<br />
ACHIEVABLE GOALS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF OUR NATION.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS BUT A SHORT WAY THROUGH ITS<br />
FIRST TERM OF OFFICE BUT* ALREADY WE HAVE TAKEN SOME<br />
IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS ACHIEVING THESE GOALS,<br />
WE MUST CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON BASIC<br />
STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS IN OUR ECONOMY, TO TACKLE PROBLEMS OF<br />
INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT TOGETHER AND TO RESTORE OUR<br />
COMPETITIVENESS IN A VERY COMPETITIVE WORLD&amp;<br />
IBELIEVE NO PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA HAS<br />
IN SUCH A SHORT TIME MORE DECISIVELY ESTABLISHED ITS STANCE<br />
IN THE FUNDAMENTAL MATTER OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY.<br />
LET ME JUST REITERATE WHAT I SAID AT THE<br />
CHAMBER OF COMMIERCE LAST MONDAY, BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES<br />
SUM UP THE PURPOSE OF OUR EFFORTS OVER THE PAST FIVE CRITICAL<br />
MONTHS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND THE HISTORY<br />
OF AUSTRALIA, </p>
<p>WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND IT IS UNPRECEDENTED<br />
IN AUSTRALIA IS TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE AND<br />
INTEGRATED BASIS FOR CONSISTENT, LONG TERM ECONOMIC<br />
PLANNING, AND IN ESTAB3LISHING THAT COMPREHENSIVE AND<br />
INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO INVOLVE, ON A<br />
CONTINUING BASISJ THE RELEVANT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITYOTHER<br />
GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESS, INCLUDING SMALL BUSINESS,<br />
THE UNIONS, THE RURAL SECTOR, THE COMMUNITY GROUPS<br />
WHICH ALL HAVE SUCH A HIGH STAKE IN THE SUCCESS OF OUR<br />
POLICIES, IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONGER TERM. FOR<br />
WHAT IS AT STAKE IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE FUTURE PROSPERITY<br />
AND WELL-BEING OF AUSTRALIA ITSELF, </p>
