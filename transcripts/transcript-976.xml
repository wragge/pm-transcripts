FATHER OF THE YEAR 1964<br />
PRESENTATION AT HOTEL AUSTRALIA, SYDNEY 14th AUGUST, 1964<br />
Speecha by the Prime Minister; the rit. Hon,, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir and Chief Justice<br />
I say to the Chief Justice that on behalf of<br />
my wife T thank you for this handsome souvenir. For the<br />
first three or four days I will begin to think that it's<br />
mine. A little later my wife will be saying to me, " Where<br />
are those silver trays of ours?" ( Laughter) and then in a<br />
year's time she will say, " Where is my silver tray?" kLaugnter)<br />
Now I mention this fact to you because this r. roves that I am<br />
not only married but a father0 I know what goes on.<br />
T think I ought to tell you Sir that when I<br />
received the invitation1 to be the Father of ih(. Year it<br />
struck me as Laving a slightly hilarious undertone. [ Laughter)<br />
I was n bed ill, I was in a weakened condition, I had a couple<br />
of doctors looming at me over the foot of the bed and discussing<br />
whether I ought to be allowed to go ibroad. if they had left<br />
that to the electors it might have been a different result<br />
( Laughter) tut they were discussing it purely on medical<br />
grounds. It was at this stage that I received an invitation<br />
to be th Father of the Year, and at first I th. ought somebody<br />
was having a bit of fun with me Father of the Year. As far<br />
as I can recall. itts thirtysix years since I last found myself<br />
a father ( Laughter) and you know, that's a long time for some<br />
of you young chaps not very long fcr ire. So my instinct<br />
was to say, 10h, no, no, no." Then they brought me the list<br />
of the Fathers of thie Year and this really put me back in my<br />
bux. There was Sir Edward Hallstrom I'm sorry he is not<br />
here today but he knows all about zoos and other things. And<br />
there's Harry Jensen who went uncomfortably ( Laughter)<br />
if you know what I mein. I can't allow Harry Jensen to be<br />
something that I'm not. " Laughter) So that was a good step.<br />
Then there was Joe Cahill who was an old political<br />
sparring partner of mine, and a great friend of mine. Then<br />
the copper Colin Delaney. ( Laughter) I've always felt<br />
uncomfortable in the presence of the police ( Laughter) except<br />
when he sits next to me at some function, and then I realise<br />
that, really, the police are friends of everybody and probably<br />
that explains why so few people get arrested but, anyhow......<br />
There's Adrian Curlewis. I read his name with profound respect.<br />
He's a District Court Judge and, what is much more important,<br />
he is a lifesaver. ( Laughter) Well, your District Court<br />
Judges here are County Court Judges in Victoria and I never<br />
knew one of them to be a lifesaver. ( Laughter) On the contrary,<br />
I had great trouble with them when I was a Junior at the Bar.<br />
And so I went Norman Gregg. Well, of<br />
course, Norman is one of the great eye men in the world. He<br />
deals with people in such fashion that whenever they look at<br />
him or anybody else thereafter, they look at them in a kindly<br />
light. He does things to the optical affair you see. And so<br />
I understood why he should be the Father of ? he Year. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Then as for the Chief Justice, there's nothing I can<br />
do about a Chief Justice. Chief Justices are very difficult<br />
people. Even when I was at the Bar myself, Sir, not appearing<br />
before you but appearing before a State Chief Justice and a<br />
Commonwealth Chief Justice I found myself under enormous constraint<br />
by about three o'clock in the afternoon, so that instead of looking<br />
at His Honour, the Chief Justice, and saying, " You knew, old boy,<br />
you're talking nonsense" ( Laughter) I would in fact say, " With<br />
infinite submission, if the Court pleases" so that I kn* ow about<br />
that. So apart from that, my qualifications are very sketchy.<br />
If I had been named the Grandfather of the Year, I<br />
would have taken this as a nice compliment because within the<br />
last twelve months well, you must picture me in my bed at<br />
Canberra at half past seven on Sunday morning. This is not a time<br />
of day on Sunday that any of you care to contemplate, nor do I,<br />
but my wife was away somewhere and I was there and the telephone<br />
rang and, inadvertently I answered and it was my elder son who<br />
said to me, " Congratulations Da you have five grandsons" and I<br />
said, " Oh, what did you say?" You know the mind moves slowly<br />
at half past seven in the morning on Sunday ( Laughter) and I said,<br />
" Son wha. did you say?" He said, " Yes, Dad. Twins. Twin<br />
granAsons." Now that, I think, was a great thins, but I hasten<br />
to say that except by indirection, except as a very remote cause,<br />
Sir, I had nothing to do with it.<br />
Well why does one like to be a father? Why does one<br />
like to be a grandfather? By and large, you knw, grandcdiliren<br />
I say this to some of you are rather more engaging than sons and<br />
daughters. I speak with reluctance about my own daughter who is<br />
the most marvellous creature in the world. But, anyhow, sons you<br />
know, you rebuke them, you send them to school, you try to instruct<br />
them when they get back. If you had my experience, you frequently<br />
found that your corrections were different fr'om the corrections of<br />
their schoolmaster, which gave me a very low opinion of schcol-<br />
S masters. ( Laughter) But you know, you havn all the to and fro,<br />
haven't you, of your own family. With grandchildren) yru see them<br />
at their best. When they get a little damp, when they get a<br />
little difficult, you hand them back to their parents and say,<br />
" Aren't they absolutely sweet?" ( Laughter); so, on the whole,<br />
this grandfather business -ppeals to me. If you could arrange<br />
for me Sir, to live for another twenty years, I would like to<br />
be nominated as the Grandfather of the Year. But as it turns<br />
out, you will have to do it post mortem.<br />
There is just one serious thing I would like to say<br />
to you. I hope not too serious. But we are here we are<br />
fathers, some of us are grandfathers. In other words we are<br />
here because we have something in common and that is he continuity<br />
of the race. This is the tremendously important thing the<br />
continuity of the race. We don't always pay as much attention to<br />
this perhaps as we should. I very well remember, and I have more<br />
than once referred to it the first time I read Walter Scott<br />
read " Ivanhoe". I remember the archers' contest in " Ivanhoe's<br />
and the bowman saying, when he was asked to fire " a twinkling,<br />
willow wand," " Well$" he said, " my grandsire drew a stout bow at<br />
the Battle of Hastings and I trust not to dishonour his name".<br />
Now you may say this is rather saccharine, this is a little<br />
sentimental. It stuck in my mind; it must have stuck in the<br />
minds of many people " My grandsire drew a stout bow". I would<br />
like to think I was the kind of grandfather about whom under<br />
different circumstanccs, in different terms, my grandsons might<br />
speak some day because I think this would be a guarantee of<br />
continuity of what we all believe to be the right spirit. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
You know, when Winston Churchill wias making those<br />
speeches of his those immortal speeches of his, those<br />
marvellous broaa~ casts and doing that job of his that nobody<br />
will, I hope, ever forget, at that time if somebody had taken<br />
the speeches of the Younger Pitt ndo in the beginning of the<br />
nineteenth century, 11+ 0 years before, if anybody had looked at<br />
the Younger Pitt's speeches at a time when it wasn't Hitler<br />
but Napoleon, at a time when invasion was thought likely, at<br />
a time when martello towers were springing up all around the<br />
invasion area as again in 194+ 0 and 194+ 1, and had read them,<br />
he would have found that the language was different but each<br />
great leader was pronouncing a feeling and a fervour which<br />
related to the morale of the country,<br />
Pitt was no doubt tkie greatest of statesmen at the<br />
turn of the nineteenth century, just as Winstcn Churchill is<br />
the most significant figure in history in our time. But this<br />
was because they had a sense of continuity. Winston Churchill<br />
was not unc~ onscious of what Pitt had said. Winston Churchill<br />
was not unconscious of what John Marlborough had done at the<br />
beginrnizzg of the eighteenthi century, he wasn't unconscious<br />
of what his ancestors had done, of what all the great men in<br />
our history had done, All he had to do was toa translate this<br />
to the current state of affairs, I am an immense believer in<br />
continuity, I believe that a sense of history, a sense of<br />
what has been done in the past and what may happen in the<br />
future does more to produce sanity of mind and ' udgment and<br />
s-6ability of spirit thin anything else that -you can thirk<br />
about. The sense of continum. ty.<br />
If ve ever get to that deplorable state, Sir in<br />
which we think we are here today and gone tomorrow and ihat<br />
nothing matters very much, there wim'Li be no continuity in our<br />
history and there wontt be a Father of the Day in fifty years'<br />
time, a Father of the Year. And therefore I feel that what<br />
you are doing is to contribute something to the rense of<br />
continuity the sense of history which has produced In our<br />
veins and In our mindis and in our hearts, the great causes in<br />
our lifetime of our survival and of our success, </p>
