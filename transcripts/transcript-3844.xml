HOBART TRANSPORT ADVISER<br />
Mr R. D. Phillips, Deputy Secretary of the Department of<br />
Transport, has resumed duty in the Department after serving<br />
for approximately three months as special adviser to the<br />
Premier of Tasmania on Transport co-ordination in the Hobart<br />
area. Mr Phillips was appointed to this position in April as a result<br />
of discussions between the Prime Minis-ter and the Premier,<br />
Mr Neilson.<br />
Following the collapse of the Tasman Bridge early in January,<br />
the Tasmanian authorities have taken a number of steps to<br />
provide alternative means of transport between the eastern<br />
and western shores of -the Derwent River.<br />
Government and private passenger ferries now operate regularly<br />
across the river, connecting Hobart's central business district<br />
with suburbs on the eastern bank. The Government has constructed<br />
the necessary berthing facilities, passenger terminals and car<br />
parks, and has purchased two large ferries.<br />
A temporary Bailey Bridge is being constructed, an additional<br />
vehicular ferry will soon be in operation, and roads on both<br />
sides of the river are being progressively and urgently upgraded.<br />
The Australian Government has accepted responsibility for<br />
meeting the costs associated with these projects, as well as those<br />
related to the restoration and widening of the Tasman Bridge and<br />
the construction of an additional permanent bridge in the Hobart<br />
area at a later date.<br />
During the past three months Mr Phillips has assisted in<br />
co-ordinating the various works, which are the responsibilities<br />
of several authorities, and has acted as a link between the<br />
Tasmanian Government and the Joint Federal State Co-ordinating<br />
Committee established to administer the Australian Government's<br />
financial contributions. ./ 2 </p>

The Premier, Mr Neilson, has expressed his sincere appreciation<br />
of Mr Phillips' efforts. " He has helped us tremendously in a<br />
difficult situation", said Mr Neilson, " and his advice and<br />
co-ordinating work has undoubtedly contributed to achieving<br />
greater progress in the many transport tasks which faced us in<br />
recent months". Mr Neilson added that he had been grateful to<br />
the Prime Minister for making Mr Phillips' services available.<br />
The Prime Minister has also thanked Mr Phillips for his work<br />
in Tasmania, and indicated to the Premier that Mr Phillips will<br />
be available for further consultation on Hobart transport<br />
matters should the need arise.<br />
