PRIME AUSTRALIA<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, HMAS DARWIN, DARWIN<br />
9 AUGUST 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you got any indication at all from Mr<br />
Palmer that he may back down on the frigates or-may<br />
PM: I had a talk with him yesterday morning. He rang<br />
me and I congratulated him on his appointment. I took<br />
the first opportunity of reminding him of the importance<br />
of New Zealand becoming part of the deal. So he's aware<br />
of the position. He was before. I've reinforced that<br />
position with him.<br />
JOURNALIST: So it's just a matter of re-emphasising what<br />
you'vye already said?<br />
PM: Well, I couldn't make the decision for them. All<br />
I can do is tell them how important we regard it and that<br />
a decision not to be involved would, in my judgement, have<br />
harmful effects upon the relationship.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you in awe of the power at your disposal<br />
and under what circumstances do you imagine you'd use it?<br />
PM: Weil, no, I don't tend to get awestruck. I am the<br />
head of a government which probably as much as any government<br />
in the world has committed itself to pursuing the processes<br />
of achieving peace and disarmament. As we have understood,<br />
and we continue to understand, if you're going to be in<br />
a position to do that effectively those around you must<br />
know of your commitment to ensuring the defence of your<br />
own country. We'vye done that. And it is a defence position.<br />
There is nothing offensive about this. There'll be no<br />
inten~ tion on the part of my Government to use what is a<br />
very considerable power that we have in any aggressive<br />
way. So what we are doing at the same time as maintaining<br />
our capacity is doing everything we can to create a peaceful<br />
environment. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you looking perhaps at<br />
increasing naval strength in the north north of Australia<br />
defence playing such a vital role these days? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: Well, we have our forward planning which is based<br />
upon the white paper that Minister Beazley conceived and<br />
so brilliantly presented. And, as you know, we are about<br />
the process now of undertaking two significant programs<br />
that will enhance our naval capacity. One is the submarine<br />
program and secondly of course the frigate program that's<br />
already been referred to. Together with the conceptual<br />
development of the move of a significant part of our capacity<br />
to the west coast of Australia. So all these things will<br />
mean that we are going to have an enhanced, more strategically<br />
relevant naval capacity.<br />
JOURNALIST: If there was to be though a third major base,<br />
would that be likely to be based somewhere in the north,<br />
like Darwin?<br />
PM: That's hypothetical and I'm not going to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Mr Palmer give any indication of when<br />
New Zealand will be making a decision on the frigates?<br />
PM: No, other than he gave me the impression that it wouldn't<br />
be too far into the future. But there was no specific<br />
date.. JOURNALIST: Are you confident the Australian Defence Force<br />
after Kangaroo 89 can defend Australia?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the AEWAC aircraft? How close<br />
are we to perhaps looking at purchase of those?<br />
PM: As I said this morning, we won't be purchasing the<br />
sort of aircraft that I went up in today. When you're<br />
talking about them you're talking about something like<br />
a cool quarter of a billion dollars. We haven't got quarters<br />
of billions of dollars to throw around for that sort of<br />
capacity which in a sense is more sophisticated than we<br />
need. It's more relevant to a European-North Atlantic<br />
type of situation. We will be watching the sorts of developments<br />
that are taking place in a number of countries which may<br />
lead to the evolution of a significantly cheaper aircraft<br />
with a capacity which is relevant to our requirements.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you be a little bit more specific about<br />
how a decision by New Zealand not to join the program could<br />
affect the relationship. What-sort of thing...<br />
PM: I don't think you need to be very much more specific<br />
other than to make the obvious point. That New Zealand<br />
make a decision that it's not going to join in an acquisition<br />
program which would enhance the capacity for interoperability<br />
of our naval forces. It must have an adverse effect on<br />
the relationship. </p>
<p>3<br />
JOURNALIST: Closer Economic Relationship. Mr Beazley<br />
has previously said that you wouldn't use the<br />
PM: The CER has its own momentum. I think this is an<br />
attitudinal thing. It's nothing esoteric. I don't know<br />
why one has to spend more than 30 seconds upon this stating<br />
the obvious. If a country with which we have gone out<br />
of our way in the period since they effectively severed<br />
their ANZUS relationship we've gone out of our way to<br />
increase defence cooperation with them it seems obvious<br />
that if in regard to a project like this which is very<br />
relevant to our capacity to project our naval forces in<br />
the region, if they're not going to be part of that then<br />
it must obviously have an adverse effect on the relationship.<br />
As I say, it's that damned obvious that I don't intend<br />
to take another second talking about it.<br />
