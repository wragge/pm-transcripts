Prime Minister Julia Gillard has congratulated the winner of the Prime Minister's Water Wise Award, which showcases commercial and industry innovation in water savings and efficiency.</p>
<p>Queensland-based landscape supply company Nursery Traders won the award for its water harvesting and recycling projects, which have reduced reliance on potable water by 98.5 per cent per hectare.</p>
<p>After nearly two decades of innovative water saving initiatives, Nursery Traders have almost completed their goal of total water self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government recognises the immense challenge we face as a nation in preparing for a future with less water and the role government, industry, and individuals play in response to these challenges.</p>
<p>Speaking at the savewater! Gala Awards Ceremony in Melbourne, Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water Senator Don Farrell said he was impressed with the innovative projects put forward by the winner and four finalists.</p>
<p>Nursery Traders' implementation of a range of sustainability measures is outstanding. They saved nearly 60 million litres of water in the past year and have generated over 100,000 kilowatt-hours of green energy to date.</p>
<p>The winner and four finalists were selected on the basis of their significant water savings; innovation; excellence in project delivery, and high capacity for their approaches to be replicated at other facilities.</p>
<p>The four finalists for the Prime Minister's Water Wise Award were Plant Growers Australia, Geelong Racing Club, Encore Tissue (Aust) and Village Centre Batemans Bay, while Daisy Fresh Dry Cleaners were recognised for their commitment to overall sustainability throughout their operations.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Water Wise Award is a prestigious award for water efficiency excellence open to all commercial and industrial water users.
