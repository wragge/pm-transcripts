PRIME MINISTER 58/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
STATE VISIT BY PRESIDENT OF IRELAND<br />
I am pleased to announce that the President of Ireland,<br />
Mrs Mary Robinson, will make a state visit to Australia<br />
from 22 to 28 October this year. The President will be<br />
accompanied by her husband, Mr Nicholas Robinson.<br />
During her visit President Robinson will visit Perth,<br />
Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne, and will be<br />
meeting the Governor-General, myself, and Ministers.<br />
Australia and Ireland have a close relationship based on<br />
a common heritage and strong ties of family and history.<br />
President Robinson's visit will mark an important<br />
milestone in this relationship, and the Government looks<br />
forward very much to her visit.<br />
