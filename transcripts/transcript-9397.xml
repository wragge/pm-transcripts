SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF NEW FECCA HEADQUARTERS<br />
CANBERRA, 31 OCTOBER 1994<br />
In a recent UNESCO address, the distinguished French sociologist, Alain<br />
Touraine, said the most important task facing the world was " to learn how to<br />
live together" and that, above all, this means we need to learn how to<br />
" manage diversity".<br />
I don't think anyone would argue with this. It is a challenge to the international<br />
community in the post Cold War world, and it is a challenge to our own<br />
communities. We are entitled to say I think that we have done better than most others in<br />
this regard.<br />
The creation here of a rich multicultural society built on traditions of<br />
tolerance, freedom and fairness is one of Australia's great contemporary<br />
achievements. So much so, I'm not sure I am altogether comfortable with the expression<br />
" managing diversity".<br />
To me, it sounds too technocratic for our purposes.<br />
It may have been appropriate a decade ago when Australia was coming to<br />
grips with the principles and practice of what we know today as<br />
multiculturalism. I don't think most Australians any longer view our diversity as something that<br />
must be managed.<br />
We don't think of it as a problem.<br />
We think of it, increasingly, as one of our greatest assets. 1 </p>
<p>The multitude of different ethnic communities is one of our strengths not just<br />
in the realms of culture and the arts, but in commerce.<br />
I think what should really be exercising us is the task of tapping into the<br />
resources of creativity and energy which multicultural Australia can deliver.<br />
We are a country with links to more than 150 different cultures, religions and<br />
traditions; twenty per cent of Australians were born outside Australia, and<br />
these people added to their children constitute almost half of the Australian<br />
population. In economic terms, therein lies great potential.<br />
In recent years we have come to acknowledge this. We call it " productive<br />
diversity". By this we mean that we recognise there are advantages inherent in the<br />
understanding so many Australians have of the culture, languages and<br />
business practices of many of our trading partners.<br />
As we pointed out earlier this year in Working Nation: the White Paper on<br />
Employment and Growth, this knowledge is now an integral part of the<br />
Government's industry, trade and investment strategies.<br />
Astute business people have moved quickly on this resource.<br />
For example, the law firm, Phillips Fox, has used one of its Vietnamese-born<br />
lawyers to help establish a presence in Hanoi and win contracts to translate<br />
Vietnamese foreign investment laws into English.<br />
The food exporter, Tixana, uses the business networks and market<br />
knowledge of its Asian-born management and staff to tailor its snack foods for<br />
export to South East Asia.<br />
And there are, of course, many more examples like these.<br />
The encouragement of real cultural pluralism has made our national life more<br />
complex and dynamic. It has contributed a great deal to the artistic and<br />
intellectual life of the nation.<br />
I couldn't help noticing with some pleasure the other day what the great Irish<br />
poet, Seamus Heaney, had to say about Australia after his recent visit. He<br />
said he saw it becoming a " cultural magnet" for the world.<br />
He said without " a trace of humour", according to the reporter that<br />
Australia might become the centre of a " new humanism".<br />
" I got this notion", he said, " that with the sun and population and good<br />
management it could be the Tuscany of the 21st century". </p>
<p>I think it's very significant that he counted the population as one of the key<br />
elements. It was not with Tuscany in mind that we delivered the cultural policy<br />
statement, Creative Nation, a fortnight ago.<br />
But we did have in mind pulling together as many of the creative threads in<br />
Australia as we could.<br />
We had in mind encouraging the cultural ferment and giving a creative,<br />
humanist ethic the chance to thrive.<br />
We recognise the profound and fundamental contribution that our cultural<br />
diversity will make in this process.<br />
Creative Nation strengthens the inclusive basis of cultural policy in Australia.<br />
We want to and must draw all those cultures into the mainstream; we must<br />
draw upon them for strength at home and for our image abroad.<br />
As we approach the 21st century, we should be projecting Australia as what it<br />
increasingly is tolerant and pluralist, innovative and creative, rich and<br />
diverse. For this our cultural agencies will need the capacity to develop high quality<br />
products and expertise which reflect the emerging reality of Australian life<br />
and Australian identity.<br />
That is why we allocated an additional $ 13 million to SBS Television to<br />
produce documentaries and drama.<br />
I expect that the funding will enable SBS to produce quality programs whose<br />
principal market is Australia, but which will also appeal to people in the<br />
countries of Europe and Asia.<br />
This sort of initiative seems to me an essential means of encouraging that<br />
trend in Australia towards the development of a highly contemporary identity.<br />
I have remarked on this several times before, and others are also making the<br />
observation that our identity is being significantly shaped now, that it is<br />
what we do today which defines us.<br />
As the Reverend David Gill of the World Council of Churches told the<br />
Centenary of Federation Advisory Committee:<br />
" Our identity is not something inherited for good or ill, like it or not,<br />
from years gone by. It is something we are creating. It is one of the<br />
very special aspects of being part of contemporary Australia." I </p>
<p>The Centenary of Federation Committee found " a clear consensus": there is<br />
now a genuine desire to belong to a united, cohesive nation, and yet also a<br />
real sense that tolerance, respect for difference, reconciliation and the old<br />
Australian principle of a " fair go" are defining elements of contemporary<br />
Australia. If it is true to say that these are the values we share and which, broadly<br />
speaking, constitute our identity, it follows that we should want to see them<br />
reflected in our concept of citizenship and in what we teach our children.<br />
The Centenary of Federation Committee found " a chorus of voices urging a<br />
shared political culture in which people were agreed about the<br />
responsibilities of citizenship as well as the rights of citizenship".<br />
It is for these kinds of reasons that we established the Civics Expert Group,<br />
under the chairmanship of Professor Stuart McIntyre, to provide the<br />
Government with a plan for public education and information on Australian<br />
government, citizenship and the constitution.<br />
The Group will be delivering its report on 30 November.<br />
Among other things, multicultural ism is a significant advance on the concept<br />
of social democracy and I think modern Australia conclusively demonstrates<br />
that it is a concept with practical advantages.<br />
I have outlined how it gives us economic advantages abroad, particularly as<br />
the global economy emerges.<br />
Globalisation is more than an economic phenomenon.<br />
To the extent that we are celebrating and redefining our nationhood in this<br />
decade, we are doing it at a time when national and cultural lines are being<br />
blurred in the global community.<br />
To me and I think to many others that means we are uniquely positioned to<br />
shape an Australia which sits comfortably and works creatively in the new<br />
world environment of the 21 st century.<br />
In this context I might say it is, therefore, perfectly appropriate that next April<br />
Australia will host the first major international conference on global cultural<br />
diversity. We must encourage the existing tendencies in multiculturalism.<br />
And at the same time, we need to push on with the task of ensuring that all<br />
Australians understand the foundations on which our nationhood is built. </p>
<p>It is essential that we build into Australian democracy an appreciation of<br />
democracy. That we build into multicultural Australia an appreciation of the tradition of<br />
tolerance on which it stands and depends.<br />
That is why we are addressing the issue of citizenship: not just through the<br />
Civics Expert Group, but through the National Multicultural Advisory Council<br />
whose first meeting, under the Chairmanship of Mick Young, I attended last<br />
week. The Council will play an important role in ensuring that community views<br />
inform the policy debate and help to frame the National Agenda for a<br />
Multicultural Australia.<br />
I hope the Council will address the issue of citizenship because ultimately it is<br />
through the symbols and reality of citizenship that cultural identities are<br />
included in our national life.<br />
The concept of citizenship we have in mind is one that generates shared<br />
values and a common understanding of achievements and aspirations.<br />
It is now 45 years since the Citizenship Act was passed.<br />
As we head to the centenary of Federation, it is time to re-examine our<br />
citizenship legislation and look at how citizenship might enable all Australians<br />
to participate more fully in the life of the nation.<br />
There is, as you know, a report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration<br />
which examines this issue and the Government will respond in coming<br />
months. But let me make take this opportunity to say, without prejudice to any of the<br />
principles of multiculturalism, the Government believes that whoever takes up<br />
residence in Australia should also make a commitment to Australia.<br />
The first loyalty of all who have made Australia their home should be to<br />
Australia. And it is not in anyway inconsistent with the principles of multiculturalism to<br />
expect people to take out citizenship.<br />
Australian citizenship enshrines tolerance and diversity.<br />
Of course, the values embodied in citizenship do not of themselves make<br />
good citizens.<br />
Ultimately citizenship is a voluntary act, albeit one dependent on every group<br />
and individual recognising that freedom and tolerance come with obligations. </p>
<p>This, of course, is something which FECCA recognises.<br />
They have made a great contribution to the success and development of<br />
multicultural Australia.<br />
The point I would like to make today is that by doing this, they have made a<br />
great contribution to contemporary Australian nationhood and identity.<br />
And the demand is there for FECCA to do much more.<br />
You have been successful in dealing with many of the needs and aspirations<br />
of those who have migrated to this country.<br />
FECCA has played a valuable role in the establishment of the Australian<br />
Multicultural Foundation; the National Language Policy; and the National<br />
Office of Overseas Skills Recognition.<br />
I am pleased that FECCA has deliberately sought to develop stronger links<br />
with national non-government organisations such as the ACTU, the<br />
Australian Consumers Federation, the Council on the Ageing and ACOSS.<br />
But no organisation can afford to rest on its laurels and it is, therefore,<br />
entirely appropriate that FECCA consolidate its role as the umbrella body for<br />
ethnic communities' councils in Australia by establishing its national<br />
headquarters in the national capital.<br />
It is also appropriate that FECCA's executive is moving away from total<br />
reliance on Commonwealth core funding, to one based on a mix of<br />
Commonwealth and other sources of funding for achieving specific outcomes.<br />
In this regard, I am particularly pleased to see the sponsorships from<br />
organisations such as the Commonwealth Bank and Telecom. I hope others<br />
in the private sector will follow their lead.<br />
I am also pleased to learn that FECCA is developing an agenda for reform.<br />
It has established a constitutional committee to look at ways of broadening its<br />
constituent base; and its membership is currently contemplating expansion to<br />
encompass Regional Ethnic Community Councils.<br />
We think that any initiative to broaden the representative base of FECCA is a<br />
good one.<br />
As new migrant groups arrive in Australia, it is obviously essential for your<br />
organisation to establish links with these people. </p>
<p>7<br />
Such reforms, together with those initiated by Senator Bolkus, could lead to<br />
FECCA becoming the peak umbrella body for all residents of Australia from<br />
non-English speaking backgrounds.<br />
The Government would applaud this move and we would encourage you to<br />
achieve the goal sooner rather than later.<br />
Today's opening of this new national headquarters in Canberra is, I believe, a<br />
major step forward for FECCA.<br />
It marks a new stage in the Federation's history and I take great pleasure in<br />
declaring this building open.<br />
Thank you. </p>
