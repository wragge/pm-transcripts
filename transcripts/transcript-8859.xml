TEL: 58/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
FORMER FRENCH PRIME MINISTER PIERRE BEREGOVOY<br />
I have today sent the following message to Mr Francois Mitterrand, President of<br />
France: On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I should like to<br />
convey our sincere condolences on the death, in such tragic<br />
circumstances, of the former Prime Minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy.<br />
Please also pass on our condolences to Mr Beregovoy's family.<br />
Mr Beregovoy's contribution to French Governments over a number of<br />
years and in a variety of roles has been widely recognised. I recall with<br />
pleasure my own meetings with him in our former capacities as<br />
Treasurer and Finance Minister. I was impressed by his open and<br />
unpretentious manner, and his profound concern for the interests of the<br />
French people at large. His death Is a great loss to France and to his<br />
friends and fraternal colleagues around the world.<br />
