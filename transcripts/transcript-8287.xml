PRIME M IN IST EA<br />
FOR MEDIA 30 APRIL 1991<br />
I warmly welcome the significant progress made by Antarctic<br />
Treaty Parties in Madrid in negotiating a legal instrument<br />
to protect the Antarctic environment.<br />
The Madrid meeting has made a major breakthrough in<br />
achieving consensus among key delegations to protect<br />
Antarctica in. the foreseeable future and to ensure that the<br />
continent is given the most comprehensive environmental<br />
protection possible.<br />
Since the Government's rejection in 1989 of the Antarctic<br />
Minerals Convention, Australia has worked very hard to<br />
persuade Treaty parties to introduce stringent environment<br />
protection measures for Antarctica.<br />
It has been most gratifying to obtain support in this<br />
initiative from France, Belgium and Italy and, in the<br />
lead-up to Madrid, from other parties, notably the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany and Japan.<br />
The breakthrcough achieved in Madrid is a fitting culmination.<br />
to the intensive diplomatic campaign pursued by Australia<br />
and France.<br />
The outcome of the current negotiations has proved that our<br />
commitment arid efforts to preserve this fragile and<br />
beautiful area were worthwhile, and warranted international<br />
support. The draft agreement makes clear the commitment to the<br />
comprehensive! protection of the Antarctic environment and<br />
the designation of Antarctica as a Natural Reserve devoted<br />
to Peace and Science.<br />
It will now be submitted to Governments for approval. I<br />
will be urging all Treaty nations to move quickly to<br />
finalise negotiations.<br />
The negotiatetd agreement includes extremely tight provisions<br />
prohibiting mineral resource exploration and mining in<br />
Antarctica. Only after fifty years, could any consultative party call a<br />
review conference. But any amendment to the mining<br />
prohibition would require the agreement of all current<br />
consultative parties, of which Australia is one, before it<br />
could enter into force. </p>
<p>2<br />
This means that Australia and all the current consultative<br />
parties would effectively hold a veto on mining.<br />
The prohibition on mining in the draft agreement is part of<br />
a comprehensive regime for environmental protection for<br />
Antarctica. It would include detailed requirements for<br />
conducting environmental impact assessments of all<br />
activities; the establishment of a committee for<br />
environmental protection which will have extensive advisory<br />
and recommendatory powers, and measures to ensure compliance<br />
with the agreement. </p>
