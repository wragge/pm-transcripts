IEWSON $ 8 BILLION SORT ON TELEC( M SALE<br />
Today's report by Salon: in B~ rothers makes ccr dm likely proceeds from the<br />
sale of'I'elecon o which the Coalitioi's entire funding package is hased would<br />
be roughly half diat mininctcd by DXr lke% son.<br />
Telecom sold as is would raise somewhere oftie order ofS10-12 billion. take<br />
two years to prepare for sale, and three vean actually sell.<br />
Telecom itself was advised this wvhen it souht infonnal dice as to its value<br />
and saleability.<br />
What this means is that the . iberals' Fjghjtbakpackage is massively unljifnded<br />
and that Dr HIcvson could not pay for his pronises. There is at least an S8<br />
billion discrepancy and shoritall in the amnount of monies availahle to him. This<br />
means he cannot fund lii&amp; g. ayIolo1. tAx bolitioni promise.<br />
To raise even $ 12-13 hilli) i reqtiires reltcom to lbc sold as a commercial<br />
entity, free of public cotistraints and comunniti vservice obligations.<br />
This would involve, as Saloman Brothers niak: clear. ' radical restructuring" of<br />
Telecom meaning layoll's of up to 15.000. ( Tclecom NZ laid off 4.000 last<br />
week.) It would also nean commercial charging for telephone calls which can only<br />
mean timed local calls.<br />
It would mean that rural corusumrers wouild no onger be subsidised as to<br />
connections, rentals and the phone bills thcy pay by the main capital cit) and<br />
interstate trink network. 6623 </p>
<p>Timing constraints on preparing Telecom for sale and managing its float means<br />
that to all intents and purposes none of its value can be useiully included in the<br />
Coalition's figuring.<br />
Dr Hewson should iiniediately provide the dacumentation upon which his<br />
billion figure is based and the advice he has received regarding the sale<br />
timetable and scheduling.<br />
Failure to do so leaves one with the obvious conclusion that the Telecom<br />
billion in the Liberal's calculations is a hoax on the public of Australia and<br />
represents the most dishonest fiscal sleight of hand in over a decade.<br />
