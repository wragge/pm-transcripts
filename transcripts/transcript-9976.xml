    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome the strong reaffirmation of the importance of the Japan-US relationship by the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto, and President Clinton in Tokyo yesterday. </p>
<p>The two leaders' message to the peoples of Japan and the United States emphasises the important and enduring contribution of their relationship to both countries, to the region and to the world. The Japan-US alliance is R. ndamental to the security and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, and the Australian Government strongly supports the Joint Declaration on Security issued by the two leaders. The Joint Declaration demonstrates the vitality and continuity of the alliance as a force for regional stability into the twenty-first century. </p>
<p>I am sending a message to President Clinton and the Prime Minister expressing Australia's warm support for their leadership and Australia's commitment to working closely with Japan and the United States to achieve otir shared goals in the region and more widely. </p>
