TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, ALTONAl MELBOURNE, 31 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: Today we have seen the National Accounts come and I have said that<br />
they are a beautiful set of numbers, and they are because they prove<br />
the recovery is sustainable. it's not me claiming the recovery is<br />
sustainable they prove the recovery is sustainable through low<br />
inflation, low wages growth, high investment growth and a slowing in<br />
GDP. The economy is slowing just as we hoped it would, and the<br />
interest rates effect of last year are working just as the Government<br />
had hoped. So why they are good numbers is because they hold the<br />
promise of Australia having a low inflation, sustainable long-run<br />
recovery, and they give the lie to all the doomsaying that John Howard<br />
and Peter Costello and all the others have gone on with. The proof in<br />
economic policy, as always, is in the eating. And today's statisticians<br />
National Accounts mean that the doomsaying by the Opposition has<br />
been just that doomsaying and entirely wrong. Now more work still<br />
needs to be done, and that is why the Government will bring down a<br />
Budget which will enhance Australian savings and play a further role in<br />
fiscal policy in just getting a further little slowing there in the economy<br />
to make this entirely sustainable. But wages growth of 1.6% over the<br />
year is a phenomenal figure It means that all Australians are pulling<br />
their weight in making sure we keep low inflation, and on the broadest<br />
measure of inflation the broadest measure inflation is less than 1%<br />
for the year, and that is coupled with 5% growth and 21 investment<br />
growth. I have never seen numbers like this in my political life. But,<br />
the promise is that they will get better, and they will get better as we do<br />
more work on the Budget, and we bring the recovery home through the<br />
1990s. The Government thought that the September quarter accounts<br />
were unrepresentative of the state of the economy, and the December<br />
quarter accounts proves the point.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what do you make of Mr Fraser's comments that no matter<br />
what is in the Budget, there still might be interest rate rises? </p>
<p>iEL: 31 . M1ar. 95 13: 54 No. 0 s FP. O 2/ u,<br />

PM: He was substantially mis-represented there. If you read the speech<br />
and I invite you to read it what he said was one can never say, at any<br />
stage, that interest rates won't rise. But what these numbers today<br />
reveal, is that the likelihood of interest rates rising, after these<br />
numbers today and the Budget are much, much less likely. Thank<br />
you.<br />
ends. </p>
