<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Peter. To Ita Buttrose our MC, to Senator</p>
<p> Helen Coonan, the Liberal Senator for New South Wales, ladies and</p>
<p> gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a privilege for me to be here again at this luncheon, and to</p>
<p> direct a few remarks to you about the state of the Australian economy,</p>
<p> how that relates to all men and women in Australia, and also a few</p>
<p> observations about the contribution and the influence and the impact</p>
<p> of women in the Australian economy and within Australian business.</p>
<p>Ita Buttrose mentioned in her introductory remarks the transformation</p>
<p> that had come over the role and the place of women within Australian</p>
<p> society in her lifetime. Speaking for myself as someone who was born</p>
<p> in 1939 and who grew up in Australia during the 1950s, I think the</p>
<p> two single most transforming events that I've observed in my</p>
<p> lifetime are externally the collapse of communism and the disappearance</p>
<p> through the end of the cold war of the old ideological divide across</p>
<p> the world between right and left. And the other great transforming</p>
<p> event of course has been the total change in the role and status and</p>
<p> influence of women within our community.</p>
<p>Those two things are very separate, very different but domestically</p>
<p> for our country of course domestically for other societies the change</p>
<p> in the role and the influence of women within our society has been</p>
<p> absolutely enormous. One could spend a whole afternoon regaling oneself</p>
<p> with statistics which demonstrate it. I always give a homegrown example,</p>
<p> that when I started Sydney University law school in 1957, out of class</p>
<p> of something...or a year of something like 120 there were about</p>
<p> a dozen women. When my daughter 35 years later commenced the same</p>
<p> faculty at the same law school more than 50% of those in that year</p>
<p> were women. And one confided in the realisation that 55% of all students</p>
<p> at universities, tertiary institutions, are women, and in fact in</p>
<p> small business one-third of small businesses are now owned by women</p>
<p> and the rate of entry of women into small business is three times</p>
<p> faster than that of men into small business.</p>
<p>Now this is not a speech that's going to be replete with statistics.</p>
<p> But I mentioned those to dramatise and personalise the point that</p>
<p> both Ita and I have made. So it is a society that is very different.</p>
<p> It is a society that provides particularly to those under the age</p>
<p> of 35, or even younger, provides options and opportunities that simply</p>
<p> weren't available or weren't dreamt of a generation ago.</p>
<p> The impact of information technology has had a transforming effect</p>
<p> on the operation of business throughout the world and most particularly</p>
<p> small businesses.</p>
<p>When I've tried to contemplate why it is that at the moment we</p>
<p> seem to be enjoying a level of economic activity and a level of economic</p>
<p> achievement that not even the most optimistic of us a few years ago</p>
<p> would have thought possible. I search around for some of those explanations,</p>
<p> and some of those reasons, I draw some instruction from a man for</p>
<p> whom I have immense regard and that is Alan Greenspan who's the</p>
<p> Chairman of the federal reserve system of the United States, and somebody</p>
<p> who I believe has made a great contribution to the economic success</p>
<p> and strength of the United States which is so important to all of</p>
<p> us - always has been and always will be because it's the greatest</p>
<p> economy in the world. Now his observation after a lifetime of studying</p>
<p> economic activity is that he believes that the industrialised world</p>
<p> and the modern industrialised economies such as the United States</p>
<p> and Australia are at long last getting the proper economic dividend</p>
<p> from the huge investment that has been made in technology, particularly</p>
<p> information technology over recent years.</p>
<p>But whatever the reasons are it is quite impossible for anybody who</p>
<p> has the long term interests of Australia at heart, it is quite impossible</p>
<p> for therefore from somebody in my position to look at the Australian</p>
<p> economy and the opportunities that it presents to both men and women</p>
<p> in business of all shapes of sizes at the present time without feeling</p>
<p> a great sense of enthusiasm, and excitement, and anticipation, and</p>
<p> expectation about what can really be achieved. Because in many ways</p>
<p> we are living at the moment in what could be regarded as the third</p>
<p> golden era of Australian economic performance. If you measure that</p>
<p> performance by the years of the federation of Australian since 1901.</p>
<p>And in putting this proposition to you I'm not being original.</p>
<p> I'm plagiarising the observation from an economist who was an</p>
<p> adviser to a Prime Minister, not of my political party but rather</p>
<p> a Prime Minister in the person of Bob Hawke who was Prime Minister</p>
<p> between 1983 and 1991. A few weeks at a seminar in Melbourne his economic</p>
<p> adviser, Dr Ron Garnaut, who's often written things that have</p>
<p> not always been to my liking politically. He's certainly a very</p>
<p> good economist and he made the observation that we've had three</p>
<p> great golden eras of economic development and performance in Australia.</p>
<p> The first of them began in 1901 and ended in the trenches of World</p>
<p> War I. The second began in the early years of the 1950s and ended</p>
<p> in the early 1970s when the world reeled from the oil shock and all</p>
<p> the economic dislocations that flowed from the floating of exchange</p>
<p> rates away from the old Breton-Woods agreements which had fixed exchange</p>
<p> rates. And the third era is the one that he believes that we may now</p>
<p> be entering because we are enjoying at the present time levels of</p>
<p> economic stability and economic predictability, the like of which</p>
<p> I haven't experienced at any time over the last 30 years. You</p>
<p> really do have to go back to the late 1960s to find a period of time</p>
<p> when we've had such constantly strong economic indicators.</p>
<p>Now it's always dangerous for Prime Ministers, or Treasurers</p>
<p> or anybody senior in government to make remarks about this through</p>
<p> fear that you will see on the television bulleting that night an observation</p>
<p> that the Prime Minister's getting carried away with hubris, the</p>
<p> Prime Minister's getting carried away with his own rhetoric and</p>
<p> that really doom and disaster is just around the corner, and that</p>
<p> somehow or rather it's all going to fall apart, we're going</p>
<p> to wake up tomorrow and we're going to find that interest rates</p>
<p> have climbed and that inflation has soared, that our exports have</p>
<p> fallen into a deep hole.</p>
<p> Now of course I'm conscious of the fact that it's very dangerous</p>
<p> to luxuriate too much in apparent economic success, and apparent economic</p>
<p> success. But I also think it is very dangerous and counterproductive</p>
<p> not to recognise opportunity and not to recognise strength when it</p>
<p> is staring you in the face. And I'd have to say to you today</p>
<p> that I can't remember a time when I've been able to address</p>
<p> a gathering of people whose very active years in business are so much</p>
<p> ahead of them, when I can talk with such optimism and confidence about</p>
<p> the state of our economy, and the opportunities there are for Australians,</p>
<p> men and women alike, to achieve and to do well in business because</p>
<p> not only do we have an economic circumstance at the present time which</p>
<p> is strong and stable and predictable and successful. But I think we</p>
<p> also as a community understand better now, than perhaps we might have</p>
<p> a few years ago, why it is so.</p>
<p>I think we do understand now that if you make changes and you embrace</p>
<p> reforms that are necessary you do ultimately get a result, and you</p>
<p> do ultimately get a dividend. The amazing thing about Australia at</p>
<p> the moment is that we were able to stare down the economic collapse</p>
<p> in Asia. I don't think there would have been many people in this</p>
<p> room, perhaps none, and there certainly weren't many people in</p>
<p> Australia who a couple of years ago were prepared to predict that</p>
<p> we were going to ride out the worst of that Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>I have to confess to you I didn't think we would. It's turned</p>
<p> out to be better than I expected. I was rather more cautious a year</p>
<p> or 18 months ago, or two years ago, about our capacity to do so. I</p>
<p> hoped we would. I thought we'd taken a number of steps to protect</p>
<p> Australia against the worst impact of that Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p> But I had a fear because it seemed to be a very conventional thing</p>
<p> to predict. But because we exported so much to the Asian-Pacific region</p>
<p> it would overwhelm us. But of course it hasn't turned out to</p>
<p> be like that. And the reasons why it hasn't turned out to be</p>
<p> like that is that we were able as a society and a community to take</p>
<p> a number of decisions over a number of years that gave the Australian</p>
<p> economy a competitive edge and a competitive strength that it simply</p>
<p> wouldn't otherwise have had.</p>
<p>I mean one of the reasons why we were able to stare down the Asian</p>
<p> economic downturn is that we've run a very successful and very</p>
<p> flexible exchange rate management policy in this country for a number</p>
<p> of years. And that has meant that we've been able to diversify</p>
<p> our exports into Europe and into the United States far more successfully</p>
<p> than many people thought we might otherwise have done.</p>
<p>Other reasons why we've been able to do it of course are related</p>
<p> to the fact that we got our budget in order and we undertook other</p>
<p> reforms in the financial sector and made this country a lot more competitive</p>
<p> and a lot more aggressive in winning markets around the world. In</p>
<p> other words I think we have learnt from the experience of the last</p>
<p> couple of years that if you are able just as you find this experience</p>
<p> in running business, that you are able to undertake reforms and to</p>
<p> address structural challenges then a few years down the track you</p>
<p> normally get a dividend. And that has been the case I think with Australia.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes me so enthused about our prospects and</p>
<p> about our future as a society and as a country is that having learnt</p>
<p> that today's prosperity and strength is a product of yesterday's</p>
<p> reforms and change. More and more Australians are likely to accept</p>
<p> the proposition that tomorrow's prosperity and success and strength</p>
<p> will only be purchased and guaranteed if we are able to today continue</p>
<p> the reform process.</p>
<p>That of course brings me unavoidably and ineluctably to the issue</p>
<p> of taxation reform which of course is the biggest single piece of</p>
<p> economic reform on our agenda at the present time and the biggest</p>
<p> single piece of economic reform that this country has indulged for</p>
<p> the last 20 years. I say indulged in the broader sense of that term</p>
<p> because it doesn't seem particularly indulgent at the present</p>
<p> time when you're still in the political process of arguing the</p>
<p> case and getting the legislation through Parliament.</p>
<p>But I have believed for more than 20 years that this country has needed</p>
<p> fundamental taxation reform. Not because of some ideological commitment</p>
<p> to taxation reform but because I've watched the present system</p>
<p> slowly breakdown bit by bit under the weight of its own anachronistic</p>
<p> character. We have needed for a very long time to have an indirect</p>
<p> tax system that more broadly and equitably taxes economic activities</p>
<p> in this country. We can no longer have one that has a lumpy discriminatory</p>
<p> approach to the taxation of the consumption level and different forms</p>
<p> of economic activity.</p>
<p>Now you are all aware I'm sure of the debate that's gone</p>
<p> on over the last 18 months of our taxation reform. You are aware that</p>
<p> we put a certain proposition to the public at the last election. You</p>
<p> are aware that having won that election we weren't able to get</p>
<p> it in its entirety through both houses of Parliament. And that we</p>
<p> entered into an arrangement with the Australian Democrats whereby</p>
<p> in summary we got about 85% or 90% of what we wanted. Now of course</p>
<p> we have gone to the public with something a little different, and</p>
<p> of course that was our first priority. And having recognised the reality</p>
<p> that we couldn't get that our obligation was to see if we could</p>
<p> secure agreement for the great bulk of that. And I'm very happy</p>
<p> to say that we did, and I've said before and I repeat it today</p>
<p> that the negotiations the government had with Senator Lees on behalf</p>
<p> of the Australian Democrats were both positive and candid and constructive,</p>
<p> and they produced an arrangement and an understanding which I believe</p>
<p> when translated into legislation which I have every reason to believe</p>
<p> will occur in a couple of weeks time, that that will deliver in 12</p>
<p> months time, from the 1st of July in the year 2000, the</p>
<p> taxation system will give enormous competitive economic benefits to</p>
<p> Australia and to the Australian economy.</p>
<p>One of the great things it will do is it will make our exports cheaper.</p>
<p> It will reduce the operating costs of many businesses. It will provide</p>
<p> greater incentive for middle Australia. We should always remember</p>
<p> that 80% of Australians earn less than $50,000 a year. 80% earn less</p>
<p> than $50,000 a year. And under this proposal those people, those 80%</p>
<p> will face a top marginal tax rate of not more than 30 cents in the</p>
<p> dollar compared with a top marginal rate of 43 cents in relation to</p>
<p> that segment of the Australian population at the present time.</p>
<p>Now it's possible to look at any taxation system and any taxation</p>
<p> agreement and say well I would have liked more to have been done in</p>
<p> that area or more to have done in another area. And of course we are</p>
<p> yet to deal finally with the issue of business taxation. One of the</p>
<p> many things that will be examined by the Ralph Committee whose report</p>
<p> we expect to receive by the 31st of July, and will form</p>
<p> the foundation of the Government's deliberations of business</p>
<p> tax reform, one of the major issues to be considered by Mr Ralph is</p>
<p> the impact of capital gains tax particularly on venture capital and</p>
<p> particularly on small businesses, because the impact of capital gains</p>
<p> tax which in an appropriate form is a necessary part of any fair taxation</p>
<p> system. The impact of capital gains tax is very significant and has</p>
<p> considerable ramifications not only for those people who seek venture</p>
<p> capital but also to the people engaged in business, particularly small</p>
<p> and medium sized business.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned to all of you ladies and gentlemen the importance</p>
<p> of taxation reform to illustrate the point that I made at the beginning</p>
<p> of my remarks on the Australian economy, and that is that today's</p>
<p> strength is a product of yesterday's reform, tomorrow's</p>
<p> strength is going to be the product of today's reforms. And of</p>
<p> course it is not only in the area of taxation where major reforms</p>
<p> have been undertaken, but an area that touches very much I think on</p>
<p> the interests and the aspirations of women in business and women in</p>
<p> the workforce in Australia in 1999, the area of industrial relations</p>
<p> reform.</p>
<p>One of the things we have sought to do in changing our workplace relations</p>
<p> law is to provide for much greater flexibility. To provide to both</p>
<p> men and women the opportunity of more effectively and more harmoniously</p>
<p> and a more complimentary way matching their work and their family</p>
<p> responsibilities. One of the reasons, the many reasons, why we opposed</p>
<p> the rigidity of the old award system was because it was built upon</p>
<p> a mindset about the structure of the Australian workforce that was</p>
<p> predominantly male, predominantly blue collar, predominantly seeing</p>
<p> the Australian workforce as a large congregation usually of men working</p>
<p> in one place under some kind of central supervision and some kind</p>
<p> of central direction. The idea that people would work from home, the</p>
<p> idea that people would have the benefit of information technology,</p>
<p> the idea that you could achieve greater efficiencies with small units</p>
<p> with a decentralised command structure, none of those concepts were</p>
<p> in the minds of the people who developed the rigid award system of</p>
<p> our old workplace relations approach. And they were amongst the reasons</p>
<p> why we campaigned very strongly to bring about change in this area.</p>
<p> And we believe quite passionately that the changes we've made</p>
<p> in this area have opened up opportunities and greater flexibility</p>
<p> especially for women in the Australian workforce than would have been</p>
<p> dreamt of only a few years ago.</p>
<p>Different political parties have different approaches to policies</p>
<p> impacting on various sections of the Australian community. It's</p>
<p> fair to say that the approach that the Government that I lead has</p>
<p> adopted, not only in relation to issues that are important to Australian</p>
<p> women but also issues important to the entire community, is that we</p>
<p> have endeavoured to the maximum extent appropriate and possible, we</p>
<p> have endeavoured to adopt a mainstream approach. We have sought to</p>
<p> create a society that is fair and decent and strong for all of the</p>
<p> Australian community. We do not see Australian society as some kind</p>
<p> of aggregation of individual groups. But we do see Australian society,</p>
<p> essentially, as being a society which has a common purpose, a common</p>
<p> reason and a common set of goals and a common set of aspirations.</p>
<p>We also recognise that within the pursuit of those common goals and</p>
<p> those common aspirations different sections of society will seek to</p>
<p> achieve their goals and realise their aspirations in different ways.</p>
<p> And so it is that in our approach to issues that affect women we have</p>
<p> not sought flashy symbolism, we have not indulged ourselves in things</p>
<p> like quotas and been over-slavish about targets but rather we have</p>
<p> sought to create a society which is built on merit, which is built</p>
<p> on greater opportunity and is built on sweeping away attitudes that</p>
<p> hold back and impede rather than to impose artificial outcomes or</p>
<p> artificial quotas from on high. Now, some people criticise that approach.</p>
<p> There'll be others, though, that will see in the long-term that</p>
<p> that approach is both more realistic and also more respectful of the</p>
<p> role and the capacities and the aspirations of women, particularly</p>
<p> younger women, within the Australian community. Because in the end</p>
<p> if we are about a society which encourages self-achievement, a society</p>
<p> which gives people the maximum opportunity to realise their goals</p>
<p> according to their own choices I don't think there could be any</p>
<p> other approach. And, afterall, it's not the role of the Government</p>
<p> to dictate the character of a relationship between two people. It</p>
<p> is not the role of a government to say, well, during a certain period</p>
<p> of your life when you have children you shall have them in paid childcare</p>
<p> or rather you should care for them yourself or your husband or your</p>
<p> wife should care for them. What we have as a government is the responsibility</p>
<p> to say to those people, we will give you the maximum opportunity to</p>
<p> choose for yourself as to what is the appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p>Now, I have a very strong view that, in relation to issues like this,</p>
<p> the role of the Government is not a compelling or an interventionist</p>
<p> role. The role of the Government is of a facilitating role and one</p>
<p> that provides people with opportunities, that doesn't mandate</p>
<p> that one particular approach, one particular pattern of behaviour</p>
<p> is the ideal but rather that recognises that different people choose</p>
<p> to do things differently and they can do them very differently with</p>
<p> equal degrees of success and equal degrees of family and career satisfaction.</p>
<p> But I do it against the background of recognising that the world in</p>
<p> relation to the contribution and the participation of women in all</p>
<p> aspects of our society has changed forever. And as one reflects on</p>
<p> the different circumstances into which men and women have been born</p>
<p> into Australian life over the last almost a century now of our existence</p>
<p> the transformation has been quite amazing. And yet through that transformation</p>
<p> and recognising that it has changed forever there are still some constants</p>
<p> and there are still some enduringly common approaches and enduring</p>
<p> values that haven't altered.</p>
<p>And the desire to find personal happiness and satisfaction within</p>
<p> a family is equally as strong as it was a generation ago but it is</p>
<p> manifesting itself in a different fashion, people will do it differently</p>
<p> according to the different generations. The desire to be successful</p>
<p> and to provide one's self and one's family with economic</p>
<p> security and economic achievement and economic success is still as</p>
<p> strong as it was. But that will be achieved in a very, very difficult</p>
<p> fashion by people in their own particular ways.</p>
<p>And that the role of government is to provide a framework that facilitates</p>
<p> people to make the choices they want themselves. And that is the guiding</p>
<p> philosophy of ours both in relation to our approach towards issues</p>
<p> that particularly affect women, recognising that all policy issues</p>
<p> affect men and women in different ways and at different stages of</p>
<p> their life, that the idea that you can have a hermetically sealed</p>
<p> set of policies that just relate to women and not to men of course</p>
<p> is unrealistic. But it is equally unrealistic not to recognise that</p>
<p> there is a particular interest on the part of Australian women on</p>
<p> certain activities and policies of the Government.</p>
<p>So our approach has not been one of flashy symbolism, rather has been</p>
<p> the one of creating a supportive society and certainly a supportive</p>
<p> economy that enables people to exercise a maximum degree of choice.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I've enjoyed again being at this gathering.</p>
<p> I want to congratulate Business Class' and the magazine</p>
<p> on the contribution, along with many other magazines that are being</p>
<p> made to informing and writing about and understanding and analysing</p>
<p> the lifestyle and the aspirations and the hopes of women within the</p>
<p> Australian community. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it's</p>
<p> quite impossible to address any gathering in my position at the present</p>
<p> time without feeling an immense sense of enthusiasm and pride and</p>
<p> hope about the strength of the Australian economy, the fact that we</p>
<p> are seen with greater respect. We are seen to exercise greater authority</p>
<p> in the world because we have achieved. And I think the opportunities</p>
<p> that lie before an audience such as this, whilst not limitless, they</p>
<p> are infinitely greater than they have been for a generation and it</p>
<p> is a marvellous time to be involved in business, and it's a marvellous</p>
<p> time for an audience such as this to be alive in Australian community</p>
<p> and thank you very much for having me.</p>
