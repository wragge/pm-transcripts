But what<br />we want to do is try and prevent the circumstance<br />I<br />happening in which one Australian company offers lower<br />prices and then destroys the prospects of others, and you<br />can imagine the difficulty of one company negothting<br />is then fearful that the company next in the list will be<br />prepared to offer much lower prices than they'd want to<br />accept, but that fear causes them to accept lower prices<br />tl--hems-elvBeust. the price limits are going to be set<br />1 6.00 p. m. SUMUAY, LI.-. J<br />of Interview between Prime Minister f-laicoIL 7e/ 12<br />er Richard Colville for CHANNEL TEN " SUNDAY REPORT"<br />Lr at 6.00 p. m. on Sunday, 29th October, 1978.<br />ppreciate acknowledgements of any excerpts used.<br />posed by Richard Colville and answered by the Prime t" LS!<br />' s the purpose behind the new policy which requires<br />rnment approval for mineral export contracts? V<br />many years there has been a policy in Australia of f<br />ng to protect Australian exporters, especially when.<br />e is a unified buying system in a country which often<br />s to pick off one Australian exporter after another<br />bear down on the price. Now, under the present i<br />umstances there is plainly a buyers' market for a i<br />er of our minerals. There is a downward pressure on<br />es and a number of the companies have wanted the o<br />rnment to do what it could to strengthen the arm of<br />Australian negotiators.<br />how will that help a company that. might-have<br />isands of tonnes of unsold minerals, for instance coal,<br />rou go and block off its possible avenues of sale?</p>
<p>after discussions with the Industries concerned, and<br />therefore the Government is certainly going to be<br />reasonable in relation to these matters, and I think it<br />is much better to approach it from this way than to take<br />the action of past Governments that people negotiate,<br />they come to an agreement, but the Government says<br />' No, that's not good enough, go back and negotiate again'.<br />That obviously creates great difficulties and we didn't<br />want to approach it that way.<br />Can you convince Sir Charles Court and Mr. Bjelke Petersen<br />of that, do you think?<br />Well, there might be some difficulty in that, but I do<br />know that a number of the major Australian companies are<br />convinced that Australia's negotiating arm their<br />negotiating arm needs strengthening, and it can't be<br />strengthened unless the Government has some kind of<br />involvement.<br />A couple of months ago on this programme you said you<br />expected major uranium developments to start work within<br />a couple of weeks. Circumstances have intervened since<br />then. What's the situation now what's going to happen?<br />Well, lan Viner will be going to the Northern Territory<br />for discussions with the Northern Land Council and there's<br />not very much I can say until that discussion has taken<br />place. But he has been very closely in touch with the<br />Chairman and with other members in the Northern Territory.<br />I think some of the intervening events are quite<br />unfortunate because it has become quite plain that some<br />people have been not so concerned about Aboriginal interests<br />but concerned merely to block uranium mining for their own<br />Contd<br />2 11t1i 1ll! l i illillilill; llllilllll</p>
<p>particular purposes, and we have sought, and gone to<br />great lengths to protect the interests of the Aboriginal<br />people and of the environment. But there is a national<br />interest also to see that uranium is exported.<br />Q: There is a meeting of the Loan Council coming up in about<br />a week. Now I understand the Government regards this as<br />being particularly important to Australia's future?<br />I think it will help to take Australia forward into the<br />1980' s) with a great deal of confidence. About 18 months<br />ago at the. Premiers' Conference we agreed to-have<br />discussions between Commonwealth and State officials to.<br />see whether or not it would be possible to allow some<br />State instrumentalities to borrow overseas to supplement<br />funds to bring forward development projects or to assist<br />in getting development projects off the ground by<br />providing infrastructure which earlier the companies<br />themselves might have had to provide. Now we are in a<br />more competitive world, the Trading situation is tougher,<br />world markets aren't growing as-' much, and, you4-know, one<br />of the purposes of this examination was to see if we could<br />sharpen Australia's competitive-' edge as. against other<br />countries. Now Commonwealth and State officials have quite<br />exhaustively examined these matters we have agreed on<br />the broad guidelines, the principals, at the last Premiers'<br />Conference, and since then Commonwealth and State officials<br />have been examining deatailed projects . which have been put<br />forward by the States, which th~ y would like to finance<br />in these ways.<br />Now, I can't say what the result of that's going to be.<br />The majority of the Loan Council is needed for the</p>
<p>I Page -4-<br />approval of support for any particular project, but I<br />do believe that the purpose of the meeting is a very<br />sound one, and that in a sense it will be a historic<br />meeting because I think it will help to move some<br />developments in Australia forward, at a faster rate<br />and that will be good for the Nation.<br />00</p>
