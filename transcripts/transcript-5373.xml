Farmers who take advantage of tLe new policy will be increasing<br />
their abLlity to withstand extnc: cd dry conditions<br />
Such measures represent, for Aus: tralian farmers, a long-term<br />
insurance policy against water shortages in the future; and a<br />
long-term encouragement for the imorovement of Australia's farms.<br />
Our entry as a nation into the new decade has been marked by<br />
a welcome improvement in our economic health; and an increasing<br />
world demand for supplies of food from the handful of world<br />
net food exporters.<br />
Because crop failures, from time to time, place varying and<br />
sometimes extreme pressure on these food supplies, opportunities<br />
will always exist for efficient producers who can meet world<br />
demands. are entitled to be optimistic about this prospect because<br />
we have had many efficient lower cost industries which will<br />
enable us in the 80s to be among the better performers in the<br />
world scene for commodity producers.<br />
Our efficiency will enable us to meet any emerging difficulties.<br />
For there are signs of deterioration in the international economy.<br />
At the heart of this has been a dramatic rise in the price<br />
of oil by 125 per cent since the end of 1978.<br />
The deterioration in the world oil situation has created the<br />
risk of oil shortages in the longer term for many countries.<br />
Only energy efficient nations will be able to minimise disruption<br />
to their economies. Parity pricing for oil is essential if<br />
we are to conserve scarce oil reserves, and if we are to encourage<br />
alternatives to the use of oil.<br />
In the light of these demands, our oil parity pricing system,<br />
far from being a problem for Australia's energy users is, in<br />
fact, the only policy which can offer a long term solution.<br />
to their needs. Ventures like the giant Rundle shale oil project<br />
would not be viable without the incentive provided by parity<br />
pricing. Yet now, in the light of recent announcements by the<br />
joint venturers, Rundle could come on stream as the supplies<br />
in Bass Strait run down. Without these developments, we risk<br />
becoming beggars for fuel in the late 1980s.<br />
We would not then be paying, as we are today, the lowest world<br />
price. Rather, we would be at the mercy of spot prices, prices<br />
whic. h cash in on factors of limited supply and unlimited demand,<br />
factors which we must seek to avoid now. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
In an energy scarce world, wxe 1iv@ in a privileged position<br />
of relative energy abundance. Uc must match that position of<br />
privilege with a sense of resoonsiblhty for the energy needs<br />
of the generations of Australl-ns who follow us. I am mi. ndful<br />
of the short-term ffect parity : rici. n has on rural producers,<br />
hut I bel. ieve it is the only res: onsible course to secure the<br />
utCure energy needs of all Austral. i. ans. Even with pari* y or icing<br />
for oil, the price of super petrol in , ustralia at 32 cents<br />
a litre is amongst the cheapest in the western world, on a<br />
par with the U. S. A. and com-parinz more than favourably NNeewth<br />
Zealand at 45 cents a litre; Germany at 59 cents: at 68<br />
cents; Japan at 66; the Nethei. and-! s at 68, Italy at 72; and<br />
France at 75 cents a litre.<br />
Nonetheless, the latest oil crisis has contributed to a number<br />
of key countries passing through a stage of accelerating inflationi<br />
and rising interest rates.<br />
In the 12 months to March 1980, inflation in the U. S. A. rose<br />
by over 4-percentage points from about 10% to nearly<br />
In the same period, inflation in the U. K. rose from under<br />
to almost 207, and the avera e inflation rate for OECD countries<br />
rose by over 4 percentage points in the same period.<br />
It is a measure of the success of our Government's policies that<br />
in the year to the March Quarter, Australia's inflation rate<br />
rose by a little over 2 percentage points from just over 8%<br />
to 10%; more than 2 percentage points below the OECD average.<br />
This means that the American farmer is not only facing hi. gher<br />
inflation than his Australian counterpart; but also, the costs<br />
induced by that inflation have accelerated.<br />
, hile farm unit costs in Australia are expected to increase<br />
by 10' in 1979-80; in the USA for example, they are expected<br />
to rise by 14%, and in New Zealand by 167.<br />
This serves to emphasise our international advantage and this<br />
advantage has been hard-won. Our challenge in the decade ahead,<br />
is to continue to keep our economic balance.<br />
To achieve this, we must use all the economic weapnons at our<br />
disposal restraint in public expenditure; reduction of the<br />
Sudget deficit; responsible monetary policies and increasing<br />
resistance to excessive wage increases.<br />
. e also need to be competitive enouvJ and flexible enough to<br />
expand our existing markets; to r2-enter old ones and to penetrate<br />
i. nto new ones.<br />
And we will achieve all these thns whl. le the Covern:. ent cont nu<br />
to create the economic clirnate and rovide the incentive in<br />
which the expansion of Australi a's i. ndustry can occur profitably. / 4 </p>
<p>In spite of the difficult world economic environment, we can<br />
claim considerable success on all these fronts.<br />
In absolute terms, and relative to the achievements of our<br />
major trading partners, our success against inflation has been<br />
noteworthy. Our production costs are down with the result that our<br />
international competitiveness has been substantially improved.<br />
It is because of this position of growing economic strength<br />
that the Government's negotiations to achieve increased access<br />
to overseas markets has met with such success.<br />
The major forum for these negotiations was the recently concluded<br />
Multilateral Trade discussions.<br />
There are, of course, on-going bilateral deliberations.<br />
But through the MTN negotiations, Australia has secured improved<br />
access to the European and United States' markets; and has<br />
secured new commitments from the Japanese.<br />
The Government's policy has been to fight for a reduction of<br />
restrictive barriers which deny full justice to the efficient<br />
producer and inhibit world trade.<br />
This problem is particularly acute with the E. E. C.<br />
But the Government has been successful in securing an improvement<br />
in access for Australian exports to the European market. Under<br />
the " ITN arrangements concluded last year, there will be a useful<br />
but somewhat modest increase in access to the EEC for beef<br />
from Australia.<br />
W'e will benefit from a new Australia only quota, levy-free,<br />
of 5,000 tonnes of high-quality beef.<br />
1! e wi, ll also benefit from arrangements for increased access<br />
for beef for ' direct consumption under the GATT levy free quota.<br />
And in addition, our expectation is that the EEC will increase<br />
access for all countries supplying frozen beef for m. nufacturing.<br />
Other zains include a 2,250 tonne levy free quota per annum<br />
for frozen buffalo meat and tariff concessions on offals, meat<br />
e-, tracts, dried fruits and certain canned fruits.<br />
CO. r discussions with the EEC are continuing in an atte:-t. to<br />
:. orove market access for Austral-:: in products.<br />
In AnriL, Minister . al discussions : wecre held in Canberra with<br />
the V. ice-PresLdent of the EEC Commission, in the first of a<br />
series of regular annual consultations at Ministerial level<br />

These initiatives, in support of Australia's rural industries,<br />
are further improved by our expectation that Japanese beef imports<br />
are to increase steadily over the next two years and to reach a<br />
peak 142,000 tonnes in 1983.<br />
These successes in securing guaranteed access to overseas markets,<br />
especially for our beef, take us a long way from the impoverished<br />
Labor years.<br />
In 1974-75, the Labor government, ignoring the fundamental stability<br />
and basic insurance for the beef industry, provided by secure access<br />
to markets, for 15 months ignored Australia's total exclusion from<br />
the Japanese beef market.<br />
It has been our determination since that time, that this should never<br />
happen again to such a vital rural industry. It has been our<br />
determination that never again should prosperity be sacrificed<br />
by a lamentable indifference of government to the needs of rural<br />
S industry. It is a tribute to the resilience of the rural sector and its<br />
capacity to take advantage of an encouraging economic climate<br />
that the recovery from the trough of 1974-75 has been so commanding.<br />
In order to secure this recovery, the Government has acted, since<br />
we ca.' e to office, to assist rural industries overcome the<br />
uncertainty of the financial pressure that arises from variable<br />
weather conditions and fluctuating commodity returns.<br />
We believe that rural industries in Australia require a special<br />
understanding from governments an. special measures which<br />
minimize the consequences of adverse conditions.<br />
To improve the long term viability of rural industries, the<br />
Government has modified the tax averaging provision; established<br />
the Primary Industry Bank of Australia which has already approved<br />
$ 210 million to 3,000 borrowers; introduced in full the fuel price<br />
Sequalisation scheme which will benefit people in country areas by<br />
over $ 120 million in 1980-81; created the income equalisation<br />
deposit scheme; abolished federal death duties; introduced a<br />
comprehensive rural adjustment scheme; provided special<br />
depreciation provisions for buildings and for the storage of<br />
hay, grain and fodder; and recently announced the introduction<br />
of new taxation concessions to assist in increased water storage.<br />
To assist specific industries, the Government has increased the<br />
wool floor price from $ 2.50 in 1975-76 to $ 3.13 per kilo in 1979-80,<br />
and given a commitment that i L-wil be at least this level in<br />
1980-81; introduced nev; wheat marketing arrangrements which<br />
stabilise returns and facilitate earlier payment cor wheat<br />
deliveries; provided assistance to beef producers during the<br />
recent beef recession; underwritten prescribed dairy products;<br />
renegotiated the Commonwealth-State sugar agreemrent with the<br />
Queensland government to provide an improved system for feeding<br />
domestic sugar prices; and helped fund a wider range of industry<br />
research programmes.<br />
The Government's dedication to economic growth, its determination<br />
to secure international competitiveness, its. success in increasing<br />
access to overseas markets, and its willingness to provide incentiV.: s </p>
<p>7<br />
to Australia's farming cormmunity all these have created a new<br />
buoyancy for rural industries.<br />
Real income per farm more than doubled in the year ended June 1979<br />
and has been approximately maintained this year.<br />
The gross value of rural production this year is estimated<br />
to be more than 60% higher than the level of two years ago.<br />
And the value of rural exports is estimated this year to be<br />
almost 60% above the level of two years ago.<br />
Across a wide spectrum of industries, current performance<br />
augurs well for the future.<br />
For livestock producers, I know that central and northern areas<br />
of Queensland are carrying a fair to good body of nature feed,<br />
and will enter the winter period in fair shape.<br />
The rural problem areas in Australia are southern Queensland<br />
. and many parts of inland New South Wales.<br />
I know that many of your members in southern Queensland are<br />
facing a very grim winter and that the need for agistment is<br />
very real indeed.<br />
Drought, of course, is much tougher when it coincides with<br />
poor export returns.<br />
Fortunately, the market basics are sound for Australia's rural<br />
industries, although I know that the faltering US economy is<br />
casting a shadow over the beef trade.<br />
However, beef prices in recent weeks have shown encouraging<br />
signs of firming.<br />
The sheep meat industry has also enjoyed strong prices at auction.<br />
Sales to the high growth Middle East countries have expanded<br />
strongly, as have live sheep exports. There is, ho
problem emerging for the Australian sheep meat industry in the<br />
1980s. Only last Thursday, European agriculture ministers agreed<br />
to most of the details of a common agricultural policy on sheep<br />
meat. The fear ' is that, like other EC regimes, this agreemznt<br />
will lead to a squeeze on imports, subsidised EC exports, or<br />
to both. And this obviously would have adverse affects on Australia.<br />
The decision is a most serious matter.<br />
Up until Europe has represented a worthwhile :-r?. ret for<br />
Australia w. hich could be threatened in the future by this decision.<br />
But a further danger lies in. t-e very real prospect of our having<br />
to compete In the import Middle East markets with subsidised<br />
conmunity exports.<br />
The Governn. nt believes that it is essential to reach ag. reement<br />
with the EEC on their understanding of their possible future<br />
developments on trade in third markets.<br />
It is our determination to ensure that agreement is reached<br />
with the EEC on a level of access to Europe which protects </p>
<p>8<br />
our traditional level of sheep meat trade in that market. Prospects<br />
in the wool market are highlighted by a concensus about an<br />
underlying strength in wool demand.<br />
There is reason, in a world where the cost of producing synthetic<br />
fibres is rising sharply, to expect sound, longer run prospects<br />
for this industry.<br />
This is borne out by the fact that auction prices so far this<br />
season have been 18% above the 1978-79 average.<br />
Although the wool corporation has increased its market support<br />
activities in recent months, its stockpile is still very low<br />
by historical standards, and is over 100,000 bales less than<br />
at the close of last season.<br />
The outlook for wool in the next financial year is a good one,<br />
and it has already been announced that the floor price for that<br />
year will be at least at the current level.<br />
It is unlikely that this new floor will be announced before the<br />
end of the current season. But there may be sound reasons for it<br />
increasing. In the wheat -industry, apart from the problems created by<br />
drought conditions in some areas, the position is encouraging.<br />
In this financial year, wheat exports are expected to be double<br />
any previous level, at a record $ 2.2 billion.<br />
On current forecasts, wheat will be Australia's largest single<br />
export significantly exceeding -wool and coal.<br />
This has arisen from strong world demand, and the fact that the<br />
area planted with wheat has increased markedly in recent years;<br />
and the 1980 crop is generally off to a good start.<br />
I appreciate that an issue of particular concern to farmers,<br />
especially grain growers, is that supportive action taken by the<br />
Australian Government to the United States response to the Soviet<br />
invasion of Afghanistan.<br />
I anhounced on 9' January 1980 that Australia would support the<br />
US action of embargoing 17 million tonnes of grain to the USSR<br />
by not picking up any shortfall created by the US decision.<br />
Consistant with the US decision, of course, normal sales were<br />
allowed to continue, so that shipments under existing contracts<br />
continued unaffected.<br />
Ho.. ever, we closely examined new contracts in grain to ensure<br />
that our commitment was being fulfilled.<br />
In doing so, two proposed sales of sorgum and one sale of maize<br />
to the Soviet Union were prevented from going ahead, providing<br />
an important contribution to Australia.' s stance onthis critical,<br />
international issue.<br />
In regard to future policy on grain sales to the Soviet Union,<br />
you will be aware that the Government recently conveyed to the<br />
grain marketing board its interimn decision that exporters of course / 9<br />
ICII--C-0-</p>
<p>9<br />
grains could now contract for up to 25% of last year's crop, provided<br />
they can demonstrate to the Government that they traditionalily<br />
enter into forward sales contracts at this time of the year.<br />
However, the Government still views the Soviet invasion of<br />
Afghanistan seriously indeed.<br />
We wish to continue our policy of full support for the US.<br />
But the Government is concerned to clarify completely the<br />
policies of major grain exporting countries in relation to<br />
1980-81.<br />
Following the recent Brussels meeting, it is now apparent<br />
that there are some issues on which further clarification is<br />
required.<br />
As a result, Peter Nixon will leave tomorrow for top'level<br />
talks in Washington and Ottawa with the US and Canadian<br />
governments. One of the real successes amongst rural industries in recent<br />
years has been the dairy industry.<br />
With government help, it has achieved one of the most<br />
remarkable, if difficult, readjustments in Australia's agricultural<br />
history. The industry is now somewhat smaller than it was a few years ago,<br />
but productivity and incomes have risen considerably as a result<br />
of the industry's increased competitiveness and its success in<br />
securing new markets.<br />
Another vital industry enjoying a significant recovery from<br />
recession is the sugar industry.<br />
During the last few months, world free markets sugar prices<br />
have risen to the highest level since 1974.<br />
With production and export restrictions now lifted, prospects<br />
for the industry are indeed promising. However, there remains<br />
one notorious practice which affects the viability of all<br />
efficient rural industries the dumping-of subsidised agricultural<br />
products on world markets.<br />
We have persistently argued in the European Community that the<br />
costs to be borne ihternationally by government subsidies<br />
and protectionist devices has reached a level which is not in<br />
the community's best interest or in the interest of more<br />
efficient producers.<br />
It is of little benefit t: o industrialised nations to tax the<br />
communities heavily, to oay for subsidised goods whose over<br />
production leads to dumping.<br />
And it is of no benefit to efficient economic producers and<br />
exporters who are denied markets and are unable to fully develop<br />
low cost industries which will provide reasonably priced food,<br />
on a sustainable basis, not subject to political interference.<br />
We believe that our approach is eminently reasonable. </p>
<p>We have simply urged modification of the EEC policy so<br />
that the Community's excessive practice of dumping on<br />
world markets is moderated.<br />
The Government's success at improving our access to existing<br />
markets has been complemented by our development of new<br />
markets. The liddle East has now become our largest market for live<br />
sheep and sheep meat, and is an important customer for<br />
Australian dairy produce.<br />
The Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Sir Leslie Price,<br />
co-mented recently that the Middle East is our most rapidly<br />
expanding wheat market.<br />
In 1979, the Wheat Board shipped 3.5 million tonnes to the<br />
Middle East, and the figure could rise to 5 million tonnes<br />
in 1980, or nearly 40% of Australian wheat exports.<br />
The Asian market has also become much more important for our<br />
rural export industries, with rising sales in grain, meat. and<br />
dairy products.<br />
These developments augur well for the future.<br />
The current strength of the Australian economy; the underlying<br />
increase in world food demand; the vigorous and successful<br />
attempts by exporters and the Government to expand our markets;<br />
all these have established the foundation for continuing growth<br />
of our rural iindustries. But the fact that we have been able<br />
to succeed in the difficult world economic environment does not<br />
entitle us to be complacent.<br />
We must re-double our efforts to prevent defective policies<br />
and irresponsible economic management jeopardising the<br />
significant results of the last four years.<br />
It is a salutory experience. to recall the problems confronted<br />
by our rural industries, indeed all industries, in the Labor<br />
years. At that time, in separate 12 month periods:<br />
Commonwealth budget outlays rose by 46%;<br />
Federal award wages rose by 38%;<br />
Farm unit costs increased by<br />
SReal income per farm fell by over<br />
SThe Australian beef industry was excluded from<br />
Japanese markets; and<br />
In early 1975, only a rank and file revolt prevented<br />
the Labor dovcrnment from reducing the floor price<br />
for wool from 250 cents to 200 cents per kilo. ./ ll </p>
<p>11<br />
Inevitably, under this assault, Australian industries either.<br />
collapsed, or were unable to compete internationally and<br />
available markets were lost.<br />
Farmers still remember with great anxiety, the Coombs<br />
Report commissioned by the Whitlam Government.<br />
Acting upon this, Labor cut a swath through assistance to<br />
people in country areas, largely on the basis that such<br />
assistance was not needed.<br />
Such a look into the past reminds us that the foundations<br />
of profitable industry are hard to build; easy to destroy.<br />
It reminds us that hard-won gains can easily be squandered<br />
and we have come too far to contemplate sacrificing'the<br />
benefits that we have secured.<br />
In the decade ahead, our efforts must be spent in consolidating<br />
our advantages and building on our opportunities.<br />
As always, there will be difficulties through drought, the<br />
world economy, farm costs and the tendency towards variability<br />
in commodityprices all these will be severe enough<br />
tests in themselves.<br />
We cannot allow them to be complicated by Government extravagance<br />
and incompetence which would deal to the rural sector the<br />
kind of body blow it experienced in the<br />
Rural industries have much to gain from a well-managed<br />
domestic economy.<br />
We enter the 80s with the kind of economic stability and<br />
international competitiveness that suggests a decade of great<br />
opportunity for Australian farmers.<br />
The big industries of Australian agriculture wool, meat, sugar<br />
and wheat, have found long-term prospects.<br />
The dairy industry is now much better placed to take advantage<br />
of market prospects.<br />
Moreover, there are emerging industries the growing rice<br />
industry, the developing oilseeds industry and a spectacular<br />
growth in cotton production.<br />
When one realises that Australia's agricultural exports in<br />
the last financial year represented more than 40% of Australia's<br />
total exports, then an understanding can be gained of the<br />
important social and economic benefits provided to the nation<br />
by rural industries.<br />
This export success must be maintained.<br />
We are well located geographically to meet any increase in food<br />
import demands of the high growth Middle'East and Asian markets. </p>
<p>12<br />
Global food security, particularly for increasingly import<br />
dependent developing countries, is likely to be a continuing<br />
political issue in the<br />
This grow-. ing import dependence of developing countries<br />
reoresents a challenge for Australian agriculture that<br />
historicallv it has met; -and organisationally and economically<br />
it is caoable of meeting again.<br />
In the 80s Australia will have an increasingly important role<br />
as a net food and energy exporter.<br />
The Government is determined to secure the economic environment<br />
in which these roles can be fully and productively played out.<br />
Inevitably, one of the challenges in any decade is the challenge<br />
of change. So it will be with rural industries.<br />
There will be new domestic and international agricultural<br />
demands and new and rapidly developing markets.<br />
It is through an industry-oriented organisation such as yours<br />
that these changes can be most beneficially accommodated.<br />
Your initiatives and those of your parent body will be central<br />
in the decade ahead in fashioning* the response of all Australian<br />
