TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, HILTON CONVENTION CENTRE, 29 JUNE 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM; You can see today, I think, that Australia has got its trade act together and<br />
particularly here in Indonesia. This is the largest trade exhibition Australia<br />
has ever mounted. Its comprehension has to be seen to be believed,<br />
running from manufacturers through services and it's going to have, I<br />
think, a large impact upon the business community of Indonesia. Australia<br />
is now being accepted for what it is a high technology, thoughtful country<br />
which can really help develop Indonesia and this part of the world, both in<br />
services and in manufacturing. So, it is with much pleasure that I was<br />
here and able to participate with Minister Hartarto in launching the<br />
exhibition.<br />
J: Prime Minister, last night, Alexander Downer was claiming credit for<br />
forcing you to raise the censorship issue with President Soeharto. What is<br />
your response to that?<br />
PM: It is ridiculous. It's just high school debating stuff. Foreign Minister Gareth<br />
Evens last week made very clear Australia's position about this. He said<br />
Australia was disappointed. He and I discussed the matter. I repeated<br />
that to President Soeharto when I raised it and, I think, he understood the<br />
context with which it was being put. I can say after eleven years in office,<br />
in a sophisticated foreign policy we don't need high school debating<br />
tactics from Mr Downer to be able to raise matters of national importance.<br />
J: Prime Minister, I'm from Radio Australia, we broadcast live in Indonesia<br />
every day here during the ATI' 94. Would you have something to say to<br />
our listeners in Indonesia?<br />
PM: Just that I think that there is a great bond developing between Australians<br />
and Indonesians. There is great facility, I think, that Australia can provide 0. </p>
<p>2<br />
Indonesia. Many Indonesian people have said they feel very comfortable<br />
with Australians, we are capable, we are obliging, we offer help, we are<br />
not overbearing. I think these are all qualities appreciated in this country<br />
and will stand us in good stead.<br />
J: Prime Minister Keating, in a briefing to Indonesian journalists one of the<br />
Ministers here said that it was President Soeharto who specifically raised<br />
the issue of the magazine closures.<br />
PM: No, I raised the issue first. I raised the issue. But again, it's raised in the<br />
context of this broad relationship we have which is most obviously<br />
demonstrated here today. Thank you.<br />
