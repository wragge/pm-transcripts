f. t'i wi-SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ECONOMIC ASSOCIATIONS LUNCH<br />
TOKYO 16 MAY 1986<br />
MR CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
I AM DELIGHTED ONCE AGAIN TO BE YOUR GUEST AND TO HAVE THIS<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE BY<br />
BOTH OUR COUNTRIES SINCE MY LAST MEETING WITH YOU.<br />
SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN DEEPLY COMMITTED TO<br />
PROVIDING AND SUSTAINING THE CLOSEST POSSIBLE CO-OPERATION<br />
BETWEEN JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA. -INDEED THOSE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN<br />
SO SUCCESSFUL I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE WE<br />
CAN TALK NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF CONSOLIDATING THE TRADITIONAL<br />
TRADE AND INVESTMENT LINKS BETWEEN US. WE CAN ALSO TALK IN<br />
TERMS OF DELIBERATELY MOVING TO DIVERSIFY THE RELATIONSHIP<br />
INTO THE NEW GROWTH AREAS BEING THROWN UP BY THE RAPIDLY<br />
CHANGING CHARACTER OF OUR RESPECTIVE ECONOMIC STRUCTURES,<br />
WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU TWO YEARS AGO I REPORTED ON THE<br />
OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FOR THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. I SUGGESTED<br />
THAT THIS OUTLOOK, COMBINED WITH THE PROSPECT OF BETTER<br />
ECONOMIC TIES WITH" JAPAN, PROVIDED AN ENVIRONMENT WITHIN<br />
WHICH EACH OF US COULD ADDRESS THE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED<br />
BY STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN OUR TWO ECONOMIES FOR DEVELOPING A<br />
MORE BROADLY-BASED AND COMPLEMENTARY TRADING RELATIONSHIP,<br />
I BELIEVE MY CONFIDENCE AT THAT TIME WAS NOT MISPLACED,<br />
PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, IBELIEVE BOTH OUR COUNTRIES HAVE<br />
SUCCESSFULLY EMBARKED ON THE PROGRAMS OF STRUCTURAL<br />
TRANSFORMATION WHICH ARE SO NECESSARY IF WE ARE TO SUSTAIN<br />
AND FURTHER ENHANCE THE LIVING STANDARDS OF OUR PEOPLES,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS VIGOROUSLY PURSUED POLICIES TO<br />
IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVENESS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY. WE RECOGNISE<br />
THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING A STABLE DOMESTIC<br />
MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT TO ENABLE THE DYNAMISM AND<br />
CREATIVENESS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL SECTOR CAPABLE TO RESPOND TO<br />
CHANGING TRADE PRESSURES AND TO THE OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH CHANGING WORLD DEMAND PATTERNS AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, </p>
<p>WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU TWO YEARS AGO I SET OUT AN ECONOMIC<br />
STRATEGY BASED ON ACHIEVING A GREATER DEGREE OF CONSENSUS<br />
BETWEEN AUSTRALIANS ABOUT. BOTH THE NEED TO ACHIEVE FASTER<br />
SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OF THE BEST MEANS TO ACHIE VE<br />
IT. THE APPROACH WAS NOVEL IN AUSTRALIA, THOUGH, WITH DUE<br />
ALLOWANCE FOR OUR DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES, WAS<br />
LESS SO IN JAPAN.<br />
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT AUSTRALIA IS NOW A VERY<br />
DIFFERENT ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THAT STRATEGY. THE MOST<br />
OBVIOUS MANIFESTATION IS THAT AUSTRALIA IS ABOUT TO COMPLETE<br />
ITS THIRD YEAR IN WHICH ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS AVERAGED 5 PER<br />
CENT. MOREOVER EMPLOYMENT HAS GROWN BY MORE IN THE PAST<br />
THREE YEARS THAN IT HAD IN ALL OF THE SEV/ EN YEARS WHICH<br />
PRECEDED IT.<br />
NATURALLY li AND my GOVERNMENT, ARE PROUD OF THAT<br />
ACHIEVEMENT, BUT WE ARE EVEN MORE PROUD OF THE QUITE<br />
REMARKABLE CHANGE IN ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS WHICH HAS ALSO<br />
BEEN PUT IN. PLACE.<br />
THESE INCLUDE REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS, THE SHARE OF PROFITS<br />
IN GDP AND THE. LEVEL OF AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETITIVENESS EACH BEING AT THE MOST FAVOURABLE LEVEL FOR<br />
INVESTMENT IN 15 YEARS. THEY INCLUDE A FIRM APPROACH TO<br />
FISCAL RESTRAINT WHICH HAS ENABLED THE FED* ERAL GOVERNMENT TO<br />
HALVE ITS INHERITED DEFICIT AS A PROPORTION OF GDP IN JUST<br />
THREE B. UDGETS, AN ACHIEVEMENT WE INTEND TO PRESERVE.<br />
THEY ALSO INCLUDE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES TO ENCOURAGE MORE<br />
OPEN ECONOMIC STRUCTURES IN AUSTRALIA, ABOUT WHICH I WILL<br />
SAY MORE LATER, AND MEASURES TO BEGIN TO ELIMINATE<br />
UNNECESSARY REGULATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. THESE<br />
MEASURES HAVE BEEN MOST NOTABLE IN A RADICALLY TRANSFORMED<br />
FINANCIAL SECTOR. BUT THEY ALSO APPLY MORE GENERALLY, AND<br />
INCLUDE THE LIBERALISATION OF SOME EXPORT CONTROLS AND THE<br />
INITIATION OF A PROGRAM TO SCRUTINISE NEW REGULATIONS AND<br />
TO REVIEW EXISTING BUSINESS REGULATION SO A-S TO ELIMINATE<br />
THOSE WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE JUSTIFIED. </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA'S APPARENT INFLATION RATE HAS STEPPED UP RECENTLY,<br />
PARTICULARLY UNDER THE LAGGED IMPACT OF THE 1985 FALL IN THE<br />
$ A ON THE PRICE OF IMPORTED GOODS AND THEIR CLOSE<br />
SUBSTITUTES. HOWEVER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACEj IN THE<br />
CONTEXT OF OUR PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY, TO MINIMIZE THE<br />
EXTENT TO WHICH THESE INCREASES PASS THROUGH INTO WAGES AND<br />
THUS OUR DOMESTIC COST STRUCTURE, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND<br />
ALSO OF LOWER CRUDE OIL PRICES THIS IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A<br />
SHARP DECLINE IN OUR INFLATION RATE IN COMING QUARTERS,<br />
BEGINNING WITH THE CURRENT JUNE QUARTER.<br />
ONE UNWANTED BY-PRODUCT OF AN UNSUSTAINABLY FAST PACE OF<br />
DOMESTIC DEMAND IN AUSTRALIA IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1985 WAS<br />
A SOLID RISE IN OUR CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT, THE UPWARD<br />
PRESSURE FROM THAT SOURCE WAS COMPOUNDED BY A VERY SHARP<br />
DETERIORATION IN OUR TERMS OF TRADE A DETERIORATION WHICH<br />
IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED IS ADDING, IN ANNUAL TERMS, ABOUT 1 3/ 4<br />
PER CENT OF GDP TO OUR CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT.<br />
PARTLY REFLECTING THE NEED TO SECURE AN ADJUSTMENT OF OUR<br />
EXTERNAL ACCOUNT, ECONOMIC POLICY HAS. BEEN DIRECTED FOR SOME<br />
TIME TO SLOWING THE PACE OF DOMESTIC DEMAND ANDACTIVITY,<br />
AS A CONSEQUENCE ECONOMIC GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO MODERATE TO<br />
AROUND 3,5' PERCENT IN THE YEAR BEGINNING JULY 1986. GROWTH<br />
OF THIS MAGNITUDE WILL ENABLE FURTHER EMPLOYMENT GAINS WHILE<br />
UNDERPINNING AN -IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH OUR CURRENT ACCOUNT AND<br />
INFLATION RATE.<br />
WE DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE FACING<br />
US AS. A COMMUNITY TO ACHIEVE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN OTHER<br />
REQUIREMENTS FOR GROWTH AND THE DISCIPLINE OF TH EXTERNAL<br />
ACCOUNT. BUT AS, TOGETHER, AFTER 1983 WE BROUGHT OURSELVES<br />
OUT OF THE WORST RECESSION IN FIFTY YEARS I BELIEVE THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MEET<br />
AND OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE, </p>
<p>THE STABLE MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICY WE HAVE PROVIDED AND ITS<br />
RESULTANT ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE ALLOWING US TO PURSUE POLICIES<br />
DESIGNED TO DEVELOP A MORE DYNAMIC AND INTERNATIONALLY<br />
COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIAL BASE. THIS. IS REFLECTED IN OUR<br />
APPROACH TO ENCOURAGING MORE EFFICIENT USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES<br />
IN INDUSTRY, AND IN SECTORAL PLANS WHICH FACILITATE<br />
RESTRUCTURING AND A GRADUAL REDUCTION IN INDUSTRY PROTECTION.<br />
ONE EXAMPLE IS T'HE GOVERNMENT'I S RESTRUCTURING PLAN FOR OUR<br />
MOTOR VEHIC LE INDUSTRY. AN OFTEN OVERLOOKED FACT IS THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA IS JAPAN'S THIRD LARGEST MARKET FOR MOTOR VEHICLES<br />
AND A LARGE PROPORTION OF DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED VEHICLES ARE<br />
PRODUCED BY JAPANESE COMPAN IES. THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH<br />
THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL JAPANESE INVESTMENT IN OUR COUNTRY.<br />
UNDER THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS QUOTA RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTED.<br />
VEHICLES ARE BEING RELAXED GRADUALLY. IT IS EXPECTED THAT<br />
THERE WILL BE A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURING<br />
GROUPS AND LOCALLY PRODUCED MODELS. THIS SHOULD PROVIDE FOR<br />
IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF THE LOCAL INDUSTRY,<br />
AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDE OVERSEAS SUPPLIERS WITH IMPROVED<br />
MARKET ACCESS.<br />
THE* RATIONALISATION NOW UNDERWAY WITHIN THE INDUSTRY, COMBINED<br />
WITH EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, HAS ALREADY HAD BENEFICIAL<br />
EFFECTS, AUSTRALIA IS EXPORTING INCREASING QUANTITIES OF<br />
AUTOMOTIVE PARTS AND CARS, INCLUDING TO THE UNITED STATES AND<br />
JAPAN. FOR EXAMPLE, MITSUBISHI MOTORS AUSTRALIA LTD RECENTLY<br />
ANNOUNCED EXPANSION* PLANS IN ORDER TO. MEET A VERY SUBSTANTIAL<br />
EXPORT ORDER FOR AUTOMOTIVE PARTS TO ITS PARENT COMPANY HERE<br />
IN JAPAN, MITSUBISHI AUSTRALIA EXPECTS TO INCREASE EXPORTS<br />
OF CYLINDER HEADS FROM 6,000 UNITS To 26,000 UNITS PER MONTH...<br />
IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AUTOMOTIVE FIELD T'HESE SUCCESSES<br />
REFLECT BOTH THE PRICE COMPETITIVENESS AND THE QUALITY OF<br />
OUR PRODUCTS.<br />
THE STEEL PLAN IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR APPROACH TO INDUSTRY<br />
POLICY. THE AIM OF THE PLAN IS'TO RESTORE THE VIABILITY<br />
AND COMPETITIVENESS OF THE AUSTRALIAN STEEL INDUSTRY. THE<br />
PLAN COMMITS THE INDUSTRY AND ITS WORKFORC E. TO WORK TOGETHER<br />
TO REDUCE PRODUCTION COSTS AND TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND<br />
PRODUCT QUALITY. OUR STEEL INDUSTRY HAS NOW RETURNED TO<br />
SOUND PROFITABILITY. </p>
<p>THE SUCCESS OF THIS PLAN IS NOW THERE FOR ALL TO SEE, 1985<br />
WAS A YEAR OF CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTION, EXPORTS,<br />
PRODUCTIVITY AND MARKET SHARE OF THE AUSTRALIAN STEEL<br />
INDUSTRY, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE INCREASE ACROSS THE<br />
INDUSTRY'S PRODUCT-RANGE WAS'HELD To 3,36 PE RCENT IN 1985<br />
WHILE EXPORT SALES OVER 19814 INCREASED By 71 PERCENT. A<br />
PARTICULARLY PLEASING FEATURE OF THE INDUSTRY'S RECENT<br />
PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN THE LOW LEVEL OF MAN HOURS LOST DUE TO<br />
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTATION. LOSSES IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER WERE<br />
THE LOWEST SINCE OUR STEEL INDUSTRY PLAN COMMENCED, AT THE<br />
SAME TIME PRODUCTIV'ITY IS BEING MAINTAINED AT VERY HIGH<br />
LEVELS.<br />
THIS IMPROVEMENT IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY IS NOT UNIQUE TO THAT INDUSTRY, FIGURES<br />
RELEASED IN AUSTRALIA EARLIER THIS WEEK SHOWED THAT THE<br />
LEVEL OF WORKING DAYS LOST THROUGH INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES<br />
DURING JANUARY THIS YEAR WAS THE LOWEST FOR ANY MONTH FOR<br />
ALMOST 19 YEARS SINCE DECEMBER 1967.<br />
THIS ' CONTINUES A PATTERN NOW WELL ESTABLI SHED-UNDER MY<br />
GOVERNMENT, SINCE 1983. WE HAVE SECURED'A DRAMATIC LESSENING<br />
OF INDUSTRIAL CONFLICT IN AUSTRALIA. INDEED THE AVERAGE<br />
ANNUAL NUMBER OF MAN DAYS LOST IN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES IN<br />
AUSTRALIA IN THE 3 YEARS SINCE MY GOVERNMENT'S ELECTION IS<br />
WELL UNDER HALF-THE AVERAGE OF THE PRECEDING 7 YEARS.<br />
THIS IMPRESSIVE RECORD STARKLY ILLUSTRATES THE SUCCESS OF.<br />
OUR GOVERNMENT'. S PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD AND OUR<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS POLICIES.<br />
WHEN THE SITUATION WAS LESS SATISFACTORY WE WERE,<br />
UNDERSTANDABLY,, OFTEN MADE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY PEOPLE<br />
INVOLVED IN TRADE BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. INDEED IT WAS<br />
OFTEN ADVANCED AS A REASON FOR DIVERSIFICATION OF SUPPLY<br />
AWAY FROM AUSTRALIA, IF SUCH A PROPOSITION EVER HAD ANY<br />
SU. BSTANCE,, THEN WE BELIEVE FULL AND EFFECT-IVE RECOGNITION<br />
SHOULD IN TURN BE GIVEN TO THE QUITE DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN<br />
OUR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RECORD, </p>
<p>I KNOW THAT JAPAN TOO, HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN PURSUING POLICIES<br />
TO BETTER INTEGRATE ITS ECONOMY INTO THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRADING SYSTEM. WE RECOGNISE YOUR MOVES TO IMPROVE ACCESS<br />
FOR FOREIGN MANUFACTURED GOODS INTO YOUR MARKET THROUGH<br />
JAPAN'S MARKET OPENING MEASURES, AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO<br />
STRENGTHEN THE OPEN INTERNATIONAL TRADING FRAMEWORK, OUR<br />
JAPAN MARKET STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO EXPLOIT THE OPPORTUNITIES<br />
OPENED TO US BY THESE MEASURES, IAM SURE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND<br />
THAT FROM AUSTRALIA'S POINT OF VIEW, HOWEVERi WE REMAIN<br />
CONCERNED THAT THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR HAS BEEN LARGELY EXCLUDED<br />
FROM YOUR MEASURES TO DATE.<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS A PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT-THE GROWING TENSIONS<br />
IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT WHICH HAVE ARISEN<br />
LARGELY AS A RESULT OF INCREASING PROTECTIONISM AND DISTORTIONS<br />
CAUSED BY UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES. WE ARE PARTICULARLY<br />
CONCERNED WHEN SUCH TENSIONS LEAD TO BILATERAL SOLUTIONS THATHAVE<br />
LITTLE REGARD TO THE INTERESTS OF THIRD COUNTRIES.<br />
PERHAPS NOWHERE ARE THE DISTORTIONS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE MORE<br />
EVIDENT THAN IN THE AG RICULTURAL SECTOR, TRADE IN-THAT SECTOR<br />
IS CHARACTERISED BY INCREASING RESORT TO QUANTITATIVE ! IMPORT<br />
RESTRI6CTIONS* AND EXTE. NS lYE SUBSIDY PRACTICES. YOU WILL<br />
UNDERSTAND, I AM SURE, THAT FOR A COUNTRY SUCH As AUSTRALIA,<br />
WHICH EXPORTS AROUND 80 PERCENT OF ITS PRINCIPAL AGRICULTURAL<br />
PRODUCTS, THE CORRUPTION OF INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL MARKETS<br />
IS CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY TO OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS.<br />
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, AUSTRALIA WELCOMED THE TOKYO SUMMIT' S<br />
RECOGNITION OF THE CONTEMPORARY CRISIS IN AGRICULTURE, AUSTRALI. A<br />
PARTICULARLY APPRECIATED THE SUMMIT'S AGREEMENT THA T WHERE<br />
GLOBAL STRUCTURAL AGRICULTURAL SURPLUSES EXIST, ACTION SHOULD<br />
BE TAKEN TO RE-DIRECT POLICIES AND TO ADJUST THE STRUCTURE OF<br />
AGRICULTURE IN THE LIGHT OF WORLD DEMANDS<br />
AUSTRALIA ALSO SUPPORTS THE TOKYO SUMMIT'S CALL FOR THE EARLY<br />
LAUNCHING OF THE NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.<br />
INDEED WE WOULD WANT AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING HARD TO SEE<br />
THAT THE ROUND IS LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER AN OBJECTIVE I BELIEV/ E<br />
JAPAN STRONGLY SHARES WITH AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>IT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL COUNTRIES TO SEE THAT<br />
EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS COMMENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO HALT<br />
THE INCREASING SPREAD OF PROTECTIONISM, IT IS EQUALLY<br />
IMPORTANT THAT WE AVOID PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS ON THE<br />
MECHANICS OF HOW THE ROUND.-SHOULD PROCEED, WE MU ST ALL GET<br />
DOWN TO THE TASK OF WINDING BACK THE CONSTRAINTS NOW<br />
CRIPPLING WORLD TRADE&amp;<br />
FOR THE NEW ROUND TO SUCCEED IT WILL BE IMPORTANT THAT THERE<br />
BE BROAD BASED SUPPORT FROM AS MANY COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE.<br />
IN TURN THIS WILL REQUIRE THAT THE NEW ROUND ADDRESS<br />
PROPERLY THE WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTS THAT CAN BE EXPECTED TO<br />
BE HELD BY COUNTRIES AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.<br />
IN THIS REGARD, THE MANNER IN WHICH AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN HAVE<br />
WORKED TOGETHER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION IN<br />
PREPARATION FOR THE NEW ROUND HAS BEEN TO THE SIGNIFICANT<br />
ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE COUNTRIES CONCERNED. THIS EXERCISE OF<br />
DEVELOPING SHARED PERSPECTIVES AND IDEAS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT<br />
PART OF SECURING EFFECTIVE ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES OF<br />
IMPORTANCE TO THE COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION. THE FORTHCOMING<br />
MEETING IN MANILA, TO BE HELD AT EITHER SENIOR OFFICIAL OR<br />
MINISTERIAL LEVEL, ASSUMES A PARTICULAR IMPORTA" NNCE BECAUSE<br />
IT WILL COME ON THE EVE OF THE GATT MINISTERIAL MEETING IN<br />
GENEVA IN SEPTEMBER.<br />
LET ME SAY THAT AUSTRALIA WELCOMES THE THRUST OF THE RECENTLY<br />
RELEASED MAEKAWA REPORT AS A POSITIVE STE? WITHIN THE<br />
BROADER DEVELOPMENT OF POLIC IY DIRECTIONS IN JAPAN. THE REPORT<br />
HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT OVER THE<br />
LONG-TERM AND FOR POLICIES WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON, MARKET*<br />
PRINCIPLES AND LOWER PROTECTION LEVELS,. I LOOK FORWARD TO<br />
HEARING OF THE PROGRESS BEING MADE IN DEVELOPING SPECIFIC<br />
POLICIES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS. </p>
<p>THE PROCESS OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT ALREADY TAKING PLACE IN<br />
OUR TWO COUNTRIES. AND THE POLICY DIRECTION ARTICULATED BY<br />
MY GOVERNMENT AND SUGGESTED IN THE MAEKAWA REPORT, OFFER THE<br />
PROSPECT OF BROADENING THE AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN RELATIONSHIP,<br />
BASED ON THE CHANGING COMPLEMENTARITY OF OUR TWO ECONOMIES.<br />
As INDUSTRIES IN BOTH OUR COUNTRIES RATIONALISE THEIR<br />
ACTIVITIES NEW TRADING OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE OPENED UP, FOR<br />
EXAMPLE, WE IN AUSTRALIA ARE SEEKING TO TRANSFORM OUR<br />
INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE TO GIVE GREATEST EMPHASIS TO AREAS IN<br />
WHICH WE ARE MOST COMPETITIVE. UNDER YOUR BROAD APPROACH TO<br />
INDUSTRY POLICY, I EXPECT A SIMILAR PROCESS WILL OCCUR IN<br />
JAPAN.<br />
WITH THE DIFFERENCES IN* RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS, THE TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
BASE AND TECHNICAL SKILLS IN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, IT IS EXPECTED<br />
THAT THIS PROCESS WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASED<br />
TRADE IN A DIVERSE RANGE OF PRODUCTS. THIS CHANGING<br />
COMPLEMENTARITY, ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT<br />
PROCESS, WILL PROVIDE SCOPE FOR A BROADENING OF OUR TRADE<br />
PATTERNS, WITH THE PEOPLE OF BOTH COUNTRIES BENEFITING<br />
THROUGH ACCESS TO MORE COMPETITIVELY PRICED PRODUCTS,<br />
THERE WILL ALSO BE SCOPE FOR INCREASED INDUSTRIAL CO-OPERATION<br />
IN THE FORM OF THE EXCHANGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INVESTMENT<br />
FLOWS. ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED IS THE WORK<br />
OF YOUR ORGANISATION, THE JAPAN EXTERNAL TRADE ORGANISATION<br />
( JETRO) IN PROMOTING CO-OPERATION THROUGH JOINT VENTURES,<br />
TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS AND JOINT MARKETING OPERATIONS. OTHER<br />
INITIATIVES ARE ALSO BEING DEVELOPED IN THIS AREA,<br />
As THE PROCESS OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROCEEDS, I EXPECT<br />
THERE WILL BE INCREASING PROSPECTS FOR BENEFICIAL INVESTMENT<br />
BY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN AUSTRALIA OVER A BROAD RANGE OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES. </p>
<p>JAPAN FOR A LONG TIME HAS UNDERTAKEN CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT<br />
IN AUSTRALIA. WE WELCOME FOREIGN INVESTMENT THAT PROVIDES<br />
WORTHWHILE BENEFITS TO OUR ECONOMY, AND RECENT CHANGES TO<br />
OUR FOREIGN INVESTMENT POLICY GUIDELINES HAVE SIMPLIFIED AND<br />
RATIONALISED THE PROCEDURES FOR MOST FOREIGN. INVESTORS.<br />
WISHING TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEVELOPMENT.<br />
WE HOPE THAT THESE CHANGES, COMBINED WITH OUR VERY ISOUND<br />
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OVER RECENT YEARS AND OUR APPROACH TO<br />
INDUSTRY POLICYj WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR AN INCREASE IN THE<br />
HIGH LEVEL OF COMMERCIAL JAPANESE INVESTMENT ALREADY BEING<br />
ATTRACTED To AUSTRALIA. I AM ALSO SURE THAT THERE MUST BE<br />
SIMILAR POSSIBILITIES FOR AUSTRALIAN COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT<br />
IN JAPAN.<br />
IN ORDER THAT BOTH OUR COUNTRIES MIGHT EXPLORE THE<br />
POSSIBILITIES OF FURTHER INDUSTRIAL CO-OPERATION AND, IN<br />
PARTICULAR, THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST FOR INVESTMENT IN<br />
EACH COUNTRY, MR NAKASONE AND I HAVE AGREED IN PRINCIPLE THAT<br />
IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO HAVE AN EXCHANGE OF INVESTMENT<br />
MISSIONS: DETAILS AND TIMING WILL BE DISCUSSED BETWEEN<br />
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRIVATE<br />
SECTOR. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS INITIATIVE IS TO'LINK MORE<br />
CLOSELY THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT. PROCESSES WHICH ARE TAKING<br />
PLACE IN BOTH OUR COUNTRIES. THE MISSIONS WOULD SEEK TO<br />
IDENTIFY SPECIFIC INVESTMENT PROPOSALS WHICH WOULD FURTHER<br />
ENHANCE THE PROSPE CTS FOR INDUSTRIAL CO-OPERATION BETWEEN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN.<br />
AT THE TIME OF MY LAST-ADDRESS TO YOU, IN 198' 4, WE HAD-JUST-<br />
* BEGUN THE PROCESS OF FINANCIAL DEREGULATION IN AUSTRALIA<br />
WITH THE REMOVAL OF MOST EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND THE FLOATING<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE<br />
HAVE TAKEN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL MEASURES SINCE WHICH HAVE<br />
RADICALLY TRANSFORMED THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IN<br />
DOING SO WE HAVE ALLOWED SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER PARTICIPATION BY<br />
FOREIGN COMPANIES IN OUR FINANCE SECTOR. JAPAN HAS FIGURED<br />
PROMINENTLY IN THIS DEVELOPMENT, </p>
<p>APPROVAL WAS GIVEN rI1N9 85 FOR 23 JAPANESE BANKS, TRUST<br />
BANKS AND SECURITIES COMPANIES TO EITHER MOVE TO 100 PERCENT<br />
OWNERSHIP OF EXISTING MERCHANT BANKS IN AUSTRALIA ' OR TO<br />
ESTABLISH IN AUSTRALIA NEW WHOLLY-OWNED MERCHANT BANKING<br />
OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION 3 OF THE 16 NEW BANKS WHICH HAVE<br />
BEEN ADMITTED OVER THESE 2 YEARS INVOLVE JAPANESE INTERESTS<br />
AND ENJOY FULL B ANKING STATUS IN THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL<br />
COMMUNITY, THIS-IS A CLEAR EARNEST NOT ONLY OF OUR<br />
COMMITMENT TO DEREGULATE WHERE IT IS BENEFICIAL TO DO SO<br />
BUT ALSO OF THE IMPORTANCE WHICH WE ATTACH TO OUR RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH JAPANI<br />
IHOPE THAT THE ACCOMMODATING POLICY ON THE AUSTRALIAN SIDE<br />
WILL BE REFLECTED IN CONTINUED LIBERALISATION OF THE<br />
JAPANESE BANKING SYSTEM AND ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN BANKS IN JAPAN. THE PRESENCE OF THESE<br />
INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE A VALUABLE LINK IN FACILITATING THE<br />
FLOW OF TWO-WAY TRADE AND INVESTMENT BETWEEN OUR ECONOMIES.<br />
TOURISM IS ANOTHER AREA OF CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL IN THE<br />
DEV/ ELOPMENT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP. THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN<br />
100,000 JAPANESE VISITING AUSTRALIA EACH YEAR. THIS.<br />
PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT LINK THROUGH WHICH THE PEOPLES OF OUR<br />
COUNTRIES CAN DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHERS'<br />
SOCIETIES AND. CULTURES. THE GROWTH OF TOURISM IN AUSTRALIA<br />
WILL PROVIDE A FURTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR-JAPANESE INTERESTS<br />
TO SEEK OUT INVESTMENTS IN REAL ES$ TATE, HOTELS AND OTHER<br />
ASPECTS OF OUR HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY.<br />
THESE ARE. BUT A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE MORE GENERAL OPPORTUNI TIES<br />
NOW AVAILABLE TO JAPAN IN THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET. </p>
<p>OF COURSE, EVEN WHILE WE EACH PURSUE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
DEVELOPING NEW LINKS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIESi THE<br />
TRADITIONAL BASE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WILL CONTINUE TO<br />
PROVIDE THE SOLID FOUNDATION OF OUR ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION IN<br />
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TRUE, THE GROWTH IN-MINERALS TRADE<br />
IS NOT LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE AS RAPID AS IT HAS BEEN IN<br />
THE PAST. THI'S IN PART REFLECTS THE FACT THAT YOUR INDUSTRY<br />
IS GRADUALLY MOVING OUT OF SOME OF THE MORE ENERGY INTENSIVE<br />
PRODUCTION PROCESSES. HOWEVER TRADE IN MINERALS WILL<br />
CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT FOR BOTH OUR COUNTRIES.<br />
JAPAN WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MAJOR MARKET FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />
PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IRON ORE AND COAL. AT THE SAME TIME<br />
G-IVEN THE PRESSURES ON JAPANESE INDUSTRY TO MAINTAIN THEIR<br />
COMPETITIVENESS IN THE LIGHT OF THE APPRECIATION OF THE YEN,<br />
IT WILL BE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE CONTINUED<br />
ACCESS TO THE WORLD'IS MOST COMPETITIVELY PRICED MINERAL<br />
INPUTS. I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT AUSTRALIA IS THE<br />
MOST RELIABLE AND COMPETITIVE SUPPLIER OF MANY OF THESE<br />
PRODUCTS.<br />
AUSTRALIA WELCO* MES REPORTS THAT JAPAN IS DETERMINED TO<br />
PROMOTE POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING ITS DEPENDENCE ON HIGH<br />
COST LOCAL SUPPLIES OF COAL, AND WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR<br />
THIS TO BE REFLECTED IN THE EIGHTH COAL PLAN. I DO NOT THINK<br />
WE CAN OVER-EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE TO BOTH OUR COUNTRIES<br />
OF AUSTRALIA BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF COMPETING ON A<br />
COMMERCIAL BASIS FOR ADDITIONAL IMPORT TONNAGE ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH THESE POLICIES.<br />
JAPAN WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT MARKET FOR OUR<br />
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY FOR WOOL AND BEEF. THE<br />
tIAEKAWA REPORT NOTES THE DESIRABILITY OF JAPAN DEVELOPING<br />
AGRICULTURAL POLICIES " MORE BEFITTING TO AN AGE OF<br />
INTERNATIONALISM 11. </p>
<p>12.<br />
ON OCCASIONS IN THE PAST SPOKESMEN FOR JAPAN HAVE, RIGHTLY,<br />
EXERCISED THE PREROGATIVE OF FRIENDS TO POINT OUT A DIVERGENCE<br />
BETWEEN RHETORIC AND FACT IN RELEVANT ASPECTS OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN SCENE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COMES READILY TO MIND.<br />
My GOVERNMENT HAS, AS I HAVE INDICATED, DEL IVERED HANDSOMELY<br />
IN THIS . AREA.<br />
EXERCISING THE SAME PREROGATIVE OF A FRIEND MAY I EXPRESS<br />
THE FIRM HOPE THAT THESE IMPECCABLE PRINCIPLES OF THE<br />
MAEKAWA REPORT WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO DECISIVE ACTION.<br />
IN MY VIEW, THE REPORT CORRECTLY RECOGNISES THE BENEFITS<br />
THAT WILL FLOW TO BOTH THE JAPANESE CONSUMER AND TO YOUR<br />
TRADING PARTNERS FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE OPEN<br />
AGRICULTURAL MARKETS. As You PURSUE SUCH POLICIES, FURTHER<br />
OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE PROVIDED FOR AUSTRALIA TO INCREASE OUR<br />
COMMERCIAL SUPPLIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS TO YOUR MARKET.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
ADDRESS YOU TODAY. CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC SYSTEM PROVIDE INCREASING CHALLENGES AND<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH OUR COUNTRIES. I LOOK FORWARD TO US<br />
WORKING TOGETHER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, TO<br />
ENSURE A REVERSAL OF THE CORRUPTION WE HAVE SEEN IN THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM. AT THE SAME TIME, THE<br />
APP ROACHES OF BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS TO THE FURTHER OPENING<br />
UP OF OUR MARKETS PRESENTS INCREASING OPPORT UNITIES TO<br />
CONSOLIDATE AND TO BROADEN THE AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN RELATIONSHIP.<br />
TRADE IN TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT,<br />
BUT THERE WILL BE NEW OPPORTUNITIES ARISING FROM OURECONOMIC<br />
COMPLEME NTARITY, FROM INDUSTRIAL CO-OPERATION THROUGH<br />
MORE BROADLY BASED TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURES AND<br />
IN AREAS SUCH AS BANKING AND TOURISM, WHILE OUR GOVERNMENTS<br />
WILL WORK TO ENSURE AN APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK IS PROVIDED, IT<br />
IS ULTIMATELY UP TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO TAKE UP THOSE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH OUR COUNTRIES. I WISH<br />
YOU EVERY SUCCESS. I I I I, a I I a I I I I I I 1 1S 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 </p>
