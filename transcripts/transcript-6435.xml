PRIME M19NISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 AUGUST 1984<br />
Thirty nine years ago today an atomic bomb destroyed the<br />
Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later a second<br />
weapon was dropped on the city of Nagasaki. Nuclear weapons<br />
have not since been used in war but the world's stockpile<br />
of these weapons has grown from a mere handful in 1945 to<br />
in excess of 50,000 today.<br />
The memory of the appalling sacrifices made by the people<br />
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki must never dim. Avoiding nuclear<br />
war has become an absolute imperative. Nothing less than<br />
global survival is at stake.<br />
Since coming to power the Government has taken a number of<br />
steps to ensure that Australia plays its full part in<br />
meeting this fundamental challenge. On behalf of the<br />
Government I wish once again to mark Hiroshima Day by<br />
reaffirming our dedication to the pursuit of world peace<br />
and our commitment to policies designed to halt and<br />
reverse the arms race. </p>
