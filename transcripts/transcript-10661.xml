    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. This morning there was a meeting</p>
<p> of the National Security Committee of Cabinet to review the situation</p>
<p> in Indonesia, and also Australia's response to the further detonation</p>
<p> of nuclear devices by India. And in relation to India, a number of</p>
<p> decisions were taken which I will announce in a moment. But could</p>
<p> I first speak a little about what is occurring in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The stability and the prosperity of Indonesia and the welfare of the</p>
<p> Indonesian people is very important to Australia. We have longstanding</p>
<p> and very close links with that country. We are very concerned about</p>
<p> the welfare of the Indonesian people and the people-to-people links</p>
<p> between our two societies has been a very important and enduring part</p>
<p> of Australian foreign policy now for many decades.</p>
<p>We have contributed generously and appropriately to the IMF package.</p>
<p> Only recently the Foreign Minister announced a further $30 million</p>
<p> of aid to assist the poor of Indonesia and we remain directly concerned</p>
<p> in a very real way with the recovery of the Indonesian economy. The</p>
<p> disturbances which have occurred are deeply disturbing. We are, of</p>
<p> course, saddened by the loss of life. We offer our sympathy for those</p>
<p> relatives of the students who have died. We express the profound hope</p>
<p> that there will be no more violence and no more deaths and we ask</p>
<p> the Government of Indonesia to ensure that the security forces of</p>
<p> that country behave with appropriate restraint and responsibility</p>
<p> and to understand their broader responsibility to the Indonesian community</p>
<p> and to the future of that country.</p>
<p>I welcome the fact that the Defence Minister in Indonesia has announced</p>
<p> that there will be a full inquiry into the disturbances which have</p>
<p> already occurred. I have made it very plain in the public statements</p>
<p> that I have made - our desire that the situation be handled with a</p>
<p> maximum degree of care and restraint and those views, of course, have</p>
<p> been amplified by the Foreign Minister and by the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The people of Indonesia are going through a very, very trying and</p>
<p> difficult time. The painful economic adjustment process, which of</p>
<p> necessity has to be undertaken if the Indonesian economy is to recover</p>
<p> in the eyes of the world, will be difficult. The Australian Government</p>
<p> played a very important and influential role in ensuring that the</p>
<p> impositions of the IMF on Indonesia were no greater than necessary</p>
<p> to bring about the economic recovery that is needed. And I am particularly</p>
<p> pleased, in the light of events which have unfortunately occurred,</p>
<p> that Australia was willing to play that role and was successful in</p>
<p> achieving a moderation and a more realistic approach by the International</p>
<p> Monetary Fund and an understanding of the particular problems. We</p>
<p> will, of course, continue to keep a very, very close watch, not only</p>
<p> through our very talented Ambassador in Jakarta, John McCarthy, but</p>
<p> also through numerous other sources of events as they unfold.</p>
<p>Indonesia is a very important friend, a very important neighbour,</p>
<p> our nearest neighbour. The future of that country strategically, politically</p>
<p> and on a people-to- people basis will always be a very integral part</p>
<p> of the conduct of Australia's foreign policy and the links between</p>
<p> our two countries will always be extremely important.</p>
<p>Can I now turn for a moment to the decision of the Indian Government</p>
<p> and the actions of the Indian Government to detonate further nuclear</p>
<p> devices. I want to echo the condemnation that's already been</p>
<p> expressed on behalf of the Government by the Foreign Minister. We</p>
<p> deplore and condemn absolutely what India has done. It is an irresponsible</p>
<p> genuflection to transient domestic political popularity. And what</p>
<p> the Indian Government has done is to play fast and loose with international</p>
<p> safety and security in the interests of a short-term domestic political</p>
<p> game. India's behaviour, of course, has gravely compromised her</p>
<p> previous claims to exercise the role of an international moral policeman.</p>
<p> And I want to say that we are very distressed. We are very concerned</p>
<p> at the implications of what India has done.</p>
<p>And can I also say, looking to the immediate future, that we ask that</p>
<p> the Government of Pakistan display the outmost restraint. We ask that</p>
<p> the Government of Pakistan not respond by tit-for-tat detonation of</p>
<p> nuclear devices. The Foreign Minister has already made representations</p>
<p> to the Pakistan High Commissioner to that effect and I will be communicating</p>
<p> to the Prime Minister of Pakistan today to the same effect. And the</p>
<p> Foreign Minister has also urged the Government of China to exercise</p>
<p> its influence on the Government of Pakistan to avoid a tit-for-tat</p>
<p> detonation of nuclear devices by that Government. The actions already</p>
<p> taken in response to this very negative anachronistic behaviour by</p>
<p> the Indian Government have included the recall of our High Commissioner</p>
<p> in New Delhi for consultations and I understand he will be arriving</p>
<p> in Australia tomorrow.</p>
<p>This morning at the meeting of the National Security Committee, the</p>
<p> Government has decided to take a number of further steps to reinforce</p>
<p> the point that India's behaviour is unacceptable to the international</p>
<p> community and of necessity to Australia. The Government will suspend</p>
<p> defence contacts with India and that will mean that our defence attache</p>
<p> will be withdrawn from New Delhi. That ADF officers training in India</p>
<p> will be withdrawn from India and, likewise, Indian officers training</p>
<p> in Australia will be asked to leave. And all proposed defence related</p>
<p> visits and ship and aircraft visits will also be cancelled. We've</p>
<p> also decided to go a step further and to suspend all non-humanitarian</p>
<p> aid to India. Ministerial and senior official visits will be suspended</p>
<p> and Australia will take all appropriate opportunities and international</p>
<p> forums, including the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament,</p>
<p> to register Australia's very strong opposition to what has occurred.</p>
<p>We are very, very deeply concerned about the possibility of a nuclear</p>
<p> arms race. Most of the world would have hoped and prayed and thought</p>
<p> that after the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that what</p>
<p> has happened on the Indian sub-continent in recent days, and what</p>
<p> may be in prospect further in future days, would not have been in</p>
<p> contemplation. But unfortunately that has not been the case, and I</p>
<p> do hope that the gathering international protest which transcends</p>
<p> the normal divides on other issues, that gathering international protests</p>
<p> will have some impact on both India and perhaps others who may be</p>
<p> contemplating similar behaviour. It is the most deeply disturbing</p>
<p> development in every sense of those words and I know that I speak</p>
<p> for all Australians -and I am sure that the views of the Opposition</p>
<p> would be very similar to the ones I am expressing - in condemning</p>
<p> unreservedly what has occurred and expressing the hope of the Australian</p>
<p> people, that no retaliatory action is taken by the Government of Pakistan.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there a time scale on the sanctions on India?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not at this stage, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you decided against it yet, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you decided against sanctions yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the decision that we have taken at the moment we think is appropriate.</p>
<p> It is proportionate to the steps that were taken in relation to the</p>
<p> French nuclear tests. We must bear in mind in these things that our</p>
<p> argument is not with the people of India. Our argument is with the</p>
<p> government of India and we are also very conscious of the fact that</p>
<p> India is a nation that has a very large number of people who are living</p>
<p> in very difficult economic and social circumstances, and we must weigh</p>
<p> those factors up and we must take them into account but we believe</p>
<p> that our response is proportionate. They are the measures that we</p>
<p> believe appropriate at the moment. In these situations you don't</p>
<p> rule things out completely at this stage but I do make the point that</p>
<p> our argument is with the Government of India rather than with the</p>
<p> people of India.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What is Australia's assessment now that the economic crisis of</p>
<p> Indonesia can or can't be resolved without political change and</p>
<p> how do you read the statement in the Jakarta Post this morning from</p>
<p> President Soeharto suggesting he may be ready to stand down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the question of the future government of Indonesia and President</p>
<p> Soeharto's future is a matter for Indonesia. It's a matter</p>
<p> for the Indonesian people, for the processes in Indonesia and as you</p>
<p> will know, Geoffrey, I can't respond to that question without</p>
<p> suggesting that the situation is other than what I have just stated.</p>
<p> It is for the Indonesian people to decide who is the governing authority</p>
<p> in Indonesia. We believe that economic reform is necessary. We have</p>
<p> supported the measures. We have been a good and understanding friend</p>
<p> of the Indonesian people in ensuring a modification of the IMF's</p>
<p> original programme but we equally put the view very strongly that</p>
<p> economic change and economic reform is necessary. Now we leave it</p>
<p> to the Indonesian people and the processes of those forces in Indonesia</p>
<p> that have influence and have authority to decide the people who will</p>
<p> remain in charge of that country. It is not for us to give public</p>
<p> advice to the people of Indonesia about President Soeharto's</p>
<p> position.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you seeking to speak to President Soeharto?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The day to day communications are matters that one decides from time</p>
<p> to time. At the moment he is on an aircraft, I understand, travelling</p>
<p> back from Cairo. Now the question of whether I speak to him or whether</p>
<p> I write to him and who I speak to in Indonesia is a matter that you</p>
<p> decide from time to time. You don't announce in advance that</p>
<p> you are going to ring a foreign head of government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there a need to look at any further modifications to the reform</p>
<p> package in the light of what's happened.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it would be unwise to over-react in relation to the reform</p>
<p> package. It was always going to be difficult and it was always going</p>
<p> to be necessary for those who perhaps don't have such a good</p>
<p> understanding of Indonesia in other parts of the world to understand</p>
<p> how difficult it was going to be. And we should have at this time,</p>
<p> and demonstrate at this time, a sympathy and an understanding for</p>
<p> the plight of the Indonesian people and the difficulty through which</p>
<p> Indonesians are now passing. I mean, our relationship is important</p>
<p> beyond the tenure in office of any particular individuals. It's</p>
<p> a people-to-people relationship which is very important to our future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Doesn't the use of live rounds against protesters in Indonesia</p>
<p> demand at the very least that Australia suspend military contact with</p>
<p> Indonesia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it is important, Paul, to look at the medium and longer term</p>
<p> character of the relationship. I think it is also important to not</p>
<p> pre-judge the result of the inquiry that is going to be conducted</p>
<p> in Indonesia. And it is very important in that context that an inquiry</p>
<p> has already been announced and I do urge that that be an open inquiry</p>
<p> with the highest level of probity and transparency so that the facts</p>
<p> of what occurred can be made known to the Indonesian people and to</p>
<p> the rest of the world. And we place a lot of store on that. But at</p>
<p> the present time, we remain a concerned friend of the Indonesian people</p>
<p> and a government and a nation that wants to help the people of that</p>
<p> country through a very very difficult time, respecting Indonesia's</p>
<p> sovereignty and respecting the right of those of influence and the</p>
<p> people of Indonesia to determine the government of Indonesia without</p>
<p> foreign interference.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have a view about the possible impact the situation in Indonesia</p>
<p> could have on our economy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the relationship with Indonesia is more important from a social,</p>
<p> political, regional, and strategic point of view, than from an economic</p>
<p> point of view. I don't want to play down the importance of Indonesia</p>
<p> to Australia, but I am advised that as of this morning it involves</p>
<p> about 2.5% of Australia's total trade with the rest of the world.</p>
<p> Now, that's important, but the other links are even more important,</p>
<p> and you really have to look at the Australian economy as being a discreet</p>
<p> separate entity from the region. Our strengths are self-evident and</p>
<p> whilst they will be influenced by what occurs in the region, the extent</p>
<p> to which we have continued to power ahead and to grow very strongly</p>
<p> and to get our economic house in order, compared with some of the</p>
<p> difficulties other countries have had in the region is a demonstration</p>
<p> that we have stand-alone, discreet, independent, economic strengths</p>
<p> and virtues that are separate from what is happening in our part of</p>
<p> the region and I think that is something that should be well and truly</p>
<p> understood by those around the world who are assessing the Australian</p>
<p> economy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, given the situation in Indonesia has got a great deal</p>
<p> worse over the last two to three days, are you more concerned now</p>
<p> about the safety of Australian citizens in Indonesia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as always happens in these situations there are proper plans</p>
<p> laid, precautions taken, information communicated. I understand that</p>
<p> there's going to be a re-issuing of the consular warning in relation</p>
<p> to Australians in Indonesia avoiding such things as university campuses.</p>
<p> That is a situation that the embassy is giving very constant and regular</p>
<p> attention to. I don't want to overstate it. I think it is very</p>
<p> important not to see, as tragic and distressing though they are, the</p>
<p> television images as representative of what is occurring in the whole</p>
<p> country, but we will obviously keep that situation under very close</p>
<p> review.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, ACOSS and three of the major churches today in effect</p>
<p> sent a warning out to the Government about the shape of its tax reforms.</p>
<p> Have you heard that warning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't even seen it written, I haven't heard it,</p>
<p> but it will be a great tax package and it will be very fair to low</p>
<p> and middle income earners and I can guarantee to those concerned about</p>
<p> the less well-off in the Australian community that they are not going</p>
<p> to be hurt by this tax package. They in fact are going to be helped,</p>
<p> and it is very important that people wait until they see the package</p>
<p> before they start making declarations about its impact on particular</p>
<p> groups in the community.</p>
<p>I haven't spent something like 15 to 20 years of public life</p>
<p> campaigning and advocating fundamental reform of the Australian taxation</p>
<p> system to arrive at a position, where holding the authority and office</p>
<p> of Prime Minister, I squander the opportunity of achieving that reform</p>
<p> by delivering a package which is unfair to the battlers of Australia.</p>
<p>I understand the economic and political imperatives involved. We need</p>
<p> a new taxation system. I also understand the capacity of some to cynically</p>
<p> exploit the sensitivity people naturally have to change, and I can</p>
<p> assure people right across the spectrum that we will get the balances</p>
<p> in those considerations right. It will be a good package for the battlers.</p>
<p> It will be a package that can't be demonstrated on any measurable</p>
<p> criteria to be unfair to the underprivileged within our community.</p>
<p> I won't have a package that's unfair to the underprivileged,</p>
<p> and I think we'll get the balance right, and I ask those good</p>
<p> men and women who may have said what you tell me they said, to hold</p>
<p> their fire, to await the outcome of the package and I'm sure</p>
<p> they will be very very pleased with what we've produced.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
