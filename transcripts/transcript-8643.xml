PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
LUNCH IN HONOUR OF PRIME MINISTER SITIVENI RABUKA OF FIJI<br />
CANBERRA, 1 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
Prime Minister, Mrs Rabuka, Foreign Minister Bole, Your<br />
Excellencies, distinguished guests.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you, Prime<br />
minister, on your first visit to Australia as Prime<br />
Minister. Mrs Rabuka, I am also delighted to welcome you.<br />
The friendship between our two countries is a tradition.<br />
It is a friendship of trust and cooperation.<br />
The formal relationship goes back to 1964 when<br />
Australia's first post was established in Suva. This<br />
became our High Commission upon your independence in<br />
1970.<br />
Our commercial and business connections go back much<br />
further, to the last decades of the nineteenth century<br />
when we were all. British colonies.<br />
As a close neighbour, over the years we have watched your<br />
development as an independent nation and major player in<br />
South Pacific affairs.<br />
Strong ties have evolved between us in so many areas.<br />
They have stood the test of time, and the test of<br />
politics and the test of rugby.<br />
Prime Minister we followed Fiji's recent elections with<br />
interest and we were impressed with your conciliato'ry<br />
statements after your appointment.<br />
Your Prime Ministership marks a new beginning in Fiji's<br />
political life, and with it the new hope that accompanies<br />
a renewal of representative and responsible government. </p>
<p>TEL: 1 . Sep .92 14 : 12 NO.-009 -P. 02/ 03-<br />

It also marks the beginning of a new phase in our<br />
relations. Relations between Australia and Fiji have been fully<br />
normalised following our meeting in Honiara last July.<br />
The final step in the process was our agreement to resume<br />
defence links.<br />
Australia looks forward to working with you once more to<br />
strengthen the security of our region.<br />
Security requires not only defence preparedness and<br />
cooperation, but also internal security and domestic<br />
stability.<br />
We are greatly encouraged by the assurances you have<br />
given that you are resolved to maintain dialogue with 811<br />
communities in Fiji, and to further expand opportunities<br />
and political participation.<br />
Just as we welcome your commitment to national<br />
reconciliation, we are impressed by your pursuit of<br />
economic and trade reform.<br />
We In Australia have been engaged in this process for a<br />
decade. The effort to make Australia a more efficient and<br />
competitive economy is not without its costs.<br />
But the effort had to be made and we are now seeing<br />
some of the benefits.<br />
The Australian economy has been transformed: it is more<br />
flexible, more open to the world, and much more oriented<br />
to the Asia-PacifiC region where our future substantially<br />
lies. Prime minister, in the last three years we have witnessed<br />
a transformation in international affairs unequalled<br />
since the end of World War 11.<br />
Most nations are coming to realise that cooperation,<br />
trust and closer integration provide the only sure road<br />
to peace and prosperity.<br />
Events in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Horn of<br />
Africa confirm this by their tragic negative example.<br />
Fiji has made an outstanding contribution to the cause of<br />
international peace over many years and in many centres<br />
of civil and international conflict.<br />
Fijians have served witii distinction in peace-keeping<br />
operations in Lebanon, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Namibia,<br />
the Sinai and Iraq. </p>
<p>TEL: 1. sep.' 92 14: 12 No. OU9 Id-. 6/ U~<br />
3<br />
On several occasions, Australian and Fijian troops and<br />
personnel have served side by side.<br />
In the United Nations and in other forumsf Fiji has<br />
contributed as a responsible member of the international<br />
community. In the Asia-Pacific region too, there is an opportunity<br />
to constructively contribute to development and<br />
prosperity.<br />
We can only do so, however, in partnership.<br />
After our discussions in Honiara and again this morning,<br />
Prime Minister, I know that our relationship is renewed<br />
on a basis of equality and respect.<br />
In the years ahead it will be strengthened in such areas<br />
as trade, development assistance and defence.<br />
In whatever ways are practical, Australia is ready to<br />
help Fiji achieve balanced, sustainable economic<br />
development.<br />
We will continue to cooperate in such multilateral bodies<br />
as the South Pacific Forum, the South Pacific Commission<br />
and United Nations.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, let me say again how pleased I am to<br />
welcome you and your party to Australia.<br />
I trust that what remains of your stay will be pleasant<br />
and productive.<br />
I now invite Senator Robert Hill, representing the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, to Join me in this welcome.<br />
Thank you.<br />
CANBERRA 1 September 1992 </p>
