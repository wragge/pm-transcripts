TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP ST BRIGID'S CATHOUC CHURCH MARRICKVILLE<br />
WEDNESDAY, 9 AUGUST 1995<br />
PJK: You want me to say something about Fred well he was a great Labor<br />
figure. His special place for all of us was that he was the link to the forties<br />
governments. He was the link to the Curtin and Chifley years. He was only<br />
thirty when he joined the Curtin Govemment and he had that relationship<br />
with Curtin as the youngest member of the Caucus. And he developed, I<br />
think, a very special relationship with Chifley. As a young man he was a great<br />
devoted follower of Chifley's. So he saw that period of Labor Government<br />
ard he knew what a Labor Government was over an extended time and he<br />
had that continuity, Of course then through most of his life he was in<br />
Opposition and he came to government in 1972 with Gough Whitlam and<br />
had three years of It. He retired In 1975 after thirty years. So his Ministerial<br />
lifa was for three years only but his political life was over thirty. For us he<br />
was the link to the Curtin and Chifley years. He was very much a Labor<br />
traditionalist. He made light of the fact that he was in Opposition for most of<br />
his life and picked up the anecdotes that he told others, but he was a<br />
sedous Labor person with serious commitments to the community and he<br />
was no humbug. And I think it is those values that we all cherished in him<br />
and that we'll all miss.<br />
J: You sat at the Cabinet table with him. What did you personally learn from<br />
Fred Daly?<br />
PJK: There was a fair amount of forgiveness in Fred I think. The split In the<br />
ffltles of course was the dreadful agony they all lived through. But the joy of<br />
coming to office in ' 72 saw all of that peel away from him and he took the<br />
best of his life the best things of his life and celebrated them. I think<br />
that's the lesson that we can take.<br />
J: Can I just ask you one other question, there was a French newspaper<br />
t dking about ethnic cleansing in Australia. Do you have a response to that?<br />
PJK Well only that it holds the values of Australians in contempt. We gave up<br />
our colonialism in the 1970' s, the French are still hanging on to their<br />
olonialism in the Pacific. Maybe the French should have a good look at<br />
themselves.<br />
