STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE<br />
COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM, MR DO MUOI, 29 JULY-4 AUGUST 1995<br />
1 am pleased to announce that the General Secretary of the Communist Party of<br />
Vietnam, Mr Do Muoi, will visit Australia as a guest of the Government from 29 July<br />
to 4 August. The General Secretary is the highest ranking Vietnamese figure to visit<br />
Australia. He will be accompanied by high level members of the Vietnamese<br />
government and by a business delegation. He will visit New South Wales, Victoria,<br />
Queensland and Canberra.<br />
The General Secretary's visit is a significant milestone in the development of Australia's<br />
relationship with Vietnam one that is growing in importance. Two-way trade grew<br />
by 10 per cent from 1993 to 1994, and is valued at $ 402 million. Australia is now the<br />
sixth largest foreign investor in Vietnam.<br />
The General Secretarys visit coincides with the accession of Vietnam as the seventh<br />
member of ASEAN and the normalisation of its relations with the United States.<br />
These developments underline the growing impoitance of Vietnam in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region. I look forward to discussing these issues with the General Secretary, as well as<br />
the bilateral relationship between Australian and Vietnam and ways in which Australia<br />
and Vietnam can work to strengthen it.<br />
