<p>The Gillard Labor Government will invest more than $22 million to boost the future freight capacity of northern Tasmania and improve the skills base of the state's maritime workforce.</p>
<p>Tasmania has great opportunities to export its high quality produce and products to growing markets across our region.</p>
<p>Demand for premium Tasmanian products in key sectors like cheese, wine, cherries and minerals is growing as Asian markets are transformed by the growth of the world's largest middle class.</p>
<p>As an island state, Tasmania relies on sea trade. The state's exporters face complex commercial realities and Tasmania's shipping needs a secure, industry led future. </p>
<p>The Government will invest in:</p>
<p>â¢ $5.2 million towards a new $8 million intermodal freight terminal at Bell Bay, to facilitate the movement of Tasmania's logging and other bulk freight, with the Tasmanian Government contributing $2.7 millionâ¢ Almost $12 million over four years in additional funding for the Australian Maritime College (AMC) which will allow the College to deliver specialised training to over 500 maritime students â¢ $5 million to assist the Australian shipping industry meet its future workforce training needs as part of the government's shipping reforms. </p>
<p>Tasmanian traders move about 450,000 freight containers into and out of the state, each year.</p>
<p>Bell Bay is home to the largest heavy industrial precinct in Tasmania and with direct monthly exports to Asia reopening earlier this year, the funding to facilitate this growth is timely.</p>
<p>The new intermodal freight terminal will make freight movements in and out of Bell Bay more efficient and generate broader economic benefits.</p>
<p>Design plans will be finalised later this year with physical works to start in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>The Government recognises that we need to invest equally in boosting skills and creating jobs.</p>
<p>Funding for the AMC  -  the nation's most pre-eminent maritime training institution - will help rebuild the Australian shipping fleet and the skills base needed to keep the industry growing and prospering into the future.</p>
<p>Together, with our shipping reforms, funding for the AMC will see the college train more seafarers than ever before, with more jobs available on Australian flagged ships.</p>
<p>The Federal Labor Government is not only committed to maintaining funding for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, which has increased from $101.2 million in 2007 to $110.2 million this year, but since coming to power we have provided over $600 million to support the movement of people and the State's products across Bass Strait.</p>
<p>On top of that, $20 million has been provided for direct and immediate assistance for exporters, infrastructure improvements at the Port of Burnie to increase container handling capacity and the establishment of a freight logistics coordination team.</p>
<p>The Freight Logistics Coordination Team will deliver its first report in June this year which will guide a comprehensive industry-led solution to address the state's freight challenges. </p>
<p>The Federal Labor Government is committed to growing jobs and opportunities for all Australians. The measures announced today will provide a better environment for Tasmanian exporters to compete internationally and help secure jobs and growth future for Tasmania's future.</p>
