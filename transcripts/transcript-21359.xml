I sought advice from ASIO regarding a story in the Bulletin on 6 July 2004 about an investigation involving the Hon. Kim Beazley in 2001.</p>
<p>I am advised that after Mr Beazley's office contacted the Director General of Security, Dennis Richardson in May 2001 ASIO did initiate a formal investigation into allegations concerning Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>I am advised that ASIO found there was no basis on which to conclude that there was any substance to the allegations made against Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>I continue to respect the contribution Mr Beazley makes to public life in Australia.</p>
<p>As far as the Government is concerned, this matter has been dealt with in the appropriate manner and requires no further comment.</p>
