participated in the devastating raid at Pearl Harbour on<br />
December 7 1941. This sudden attack on Darwin caused<br />
considerable loss and damage to Australian and allied<br />
shipping in the harbour. It also caused extensive<br />
destruction in the town itself. At-11: 45 am, a second attack<br />
was made by _ 54 land-based Japanese bombers, concentrating<br />
on the RAAF base which was almost completely destroyed.<br />

all Australians. " The Battle of Australia has begun", warned<br />
the Sydney Morning Herald.<br />

tomorrow by the Lord Mayor of Darwin, Mr Cecil Black, to<br />
* commemorate this important event in Australia's history.<br />
