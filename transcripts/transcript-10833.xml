    <content><![CDATA[<p> I am delighted to announce today a further $18m investment in</p>
<p> restoring Australia's natural environment.</p>
<p>The projects I announce today will help revitalise our river systems,</p>
<p> restore our agricultural lands and coastal environment and reverse</p>
<p> erosion.</p>
<p>This is another instalment from the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage</p>
<p> Trust, the largest coordinated investment in the environment in Australia's</p>
<p> history.</p>
<p>Our primary industries are closely linked with our environment. A</p>
<p> degraded environment will lead to lower production, lower regional</p>
<p> growth and lower regional employment.</p>
<p>It is important to get the right balance between production and the</p>
<p> environment and this is what lies at the heart of the Natural Heritage</p>
<p> Trust.</p>
<p>The Natural Heritage Trust is an important element in the Government's</p>
<p> determination to rebuild regional Australia. Just as the Commonwealth</p>
<p> is investing in regional infrastructure to support growth, so too</p>
<p> we are investing in the environment and sustainable agriculture to</p>
<p> support regional growth and employment.</p>
<p>(A breakdown of funding across all States is available from Primary</p>
<p> Industries and Energy Minister, John Anderson's Office.)</p>
