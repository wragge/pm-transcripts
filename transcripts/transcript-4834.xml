. AUST A1A.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 25 SEPTEMBER 1978<br />
ADDRESS AT SYDNEY ROTARY CLUB<br />
I am particularly pleased to have an opportunity to speak to<br />
your club which has such a fine record of community service<br />
in the city of Sydney.<br />
Voluntary organisations such as Rotary play an essential role<br />
in helping to solve the problems of individuals in need of<br />
help. The community depends on you, just as it depends on<br />
government. Neither of us alone can fully meet the social problems in our<br />
society. Ours is a co-operative venture to ascertain what the<br />
real needs in this community are, and to respond to them with<br />
compassion, efficiency and effectiveness.<br />
In recent years, there have been remarkable social changes in<br />
Australia: the increase in family disruption; the number of<br />
single parents; the significant increase in women in the workforce;<br />
the increasing component of overseas-born members of<br />
our population, many recently of refugee status; the increasing<br />
number of aged people in the community; and the problems of<br />
structural unemployment which have emerged.<br />
The Government has responded to these changes by modifying<br />
programmes which are no longer serving the purpose for which<br />
they were designed, and initiating new programmes which meet<br />
areas of real need. For example, our decision to assist sole<br />
fathers to place them on a similar basis to supporting mothers;<br />
our greater emphasis on the provision of day care centres for<br />
children of working mothers; the decision reflected in the<br />
recent Budget to boost spending for pensioner housing; and the<br />
introduction of generous family allowances.<br />
The particular problems suffered by many members of our ethnic<br />
communities has received special recognition. Migrants are a<br />
group that have contributed enormously to the economic, social<br />
and cultural life of Australia. Migrants have to face extreme<br />
psychological and social stresses loneliness, home sickness<br />
and anxiety, and in many cases, the frustration caused by<br />
language difficulties. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
They have to cope with a completely different environment,<br />
different laws, different customs. But they have a strong<br />
desire to become self-supporting independent and productive<br />
members of Australian society-as quickly as possible, without<br />
undue reliance on government.<br />
The Government was concerned that services available to migrants<br />
were fragmentary and inadequate, and not up to the task of<br />
serving migrants' needs.<br />
For this reason, we established last year a major inquiry into<br />
post-arrival prograimmes and services, with Mr Frank Galbally as<br />
Chairman. That inquiry presented its report in April and after<br />
careful consideration, the Government endorsed it, accepting its<br />
proposal to spend an additional $ 50 million over the next three<br />
years, giving migrants a new deal.<br />
The Government is setting up sixteen centres to enable newly<br />
arrived migrants to take part in full-time English and<br />
orientation courses: spending an additional $ 10 million over<br />
three years to teach English to migrant children; upgrading and<br />
increasing English classes for adult migrants; extending the<br />
telephone interpreter services; making more funds available to<br />
Ethnic groups and co-mmunity organisations to employ their own<br />
welfare workers, health workers, and people skilled in assisting<br />
their children and the aged; and we shall establish a new<br />
Institute of Multi-Cultural Affairs to encourage the further<br />
growth of our multi-cultural society.<br />
It is not only government that has had to respond to the<br />
fundamental social changes which have been occurring. As a<br />
result of these changes, demands on voluntary agencies have<br />
been increasing, and some agencies are having difficulty in<br />
recruiting experienced voluntary helpers.<br />
The Government has recognised these needs in our programmes of<br />
financial assistance to State and Local Governments, and to<br />
voluntary community organisations which provide facilities and<br />
services for the aged, children and their parents, Aboriginals<br />
and migrants.<br />
These programmes complement the Commonwealth Income Support<br />
Programmes by providing accommodation, counselling, education<br />
and other services aimed at assisting those in need.<br />
Voluntary agencies and organisatons such as Rotary have also<br />
had to rethink their community service programmes, winding<br />
down those that have served their purpose, and redirecting<br />
energy and resources to new initiatives which provide effective<br />
assistance to new areas of need.<br />
One of the greatest social problems in Australia today is<br />
unemployment. Particularly for the young, who want to make<br />
a start in their careers. / 3 </p>
<p>I am delighted to see that the members of this club have<br />
responded by making assistance for the young unemployed in<br />
Sydney your major project for the year.<br />
Unemployment can cause great unhappiness and frustration,<br />
it is cruelly wasteful of the community's resources, and in<br />
tackling this grave problem, the Government needs the wholehearted<br />
support of all sections of the community.<br />
May I say that the co-operative community approach which we<br />
seek is exemplified' in the way that your club members are<br />
working closely with the new Commonwealth Youth Job Centre<br />
in Martin Place, and notifying job opportunities in members'<br />
own organisations, and any others that come to notice through<br />
your wide range of contacts.<br />
In view of the particular interest which you have shown in this<br />
all-important subject, I thought I might spend a few minutes<br />
outlining the Government's co-ordinated strategy to overcome<br />
the unemployment problem.<br />
Before the last election, I said unemployment would fall<br />
from February and keep falling. This prediction was based<br />
on forecasts available to me at that time.<br />
Unemployment has indeed fallen so far this year, but by less<br />
than I had hoped. Progress in reviving employment has been<br />
slower than-expected. This has been attributed to a number of<br />
factors in particular, the slow rate of growth in world trade.<br />
We had looked to a greater lift in world trade and a greater<br />
expansion in world markets this year and next than it is now<br />
clear will in fact take place.<br />
The expansion of world markets and the growth of world trade<br />
will probably be insufficient either this year o' next year<br />
to reduce the general level of unemployment in the advanced<br />
industrial countries.<br />
There have been significant setbacks in the fight against<br />
inflation among the major Western nations. We know that<br />
inflation is increasing in the United States. It has been<br />
rising in Britain and in France, and it has levelled off at<br />
a high point in Italy.<br />
Two countries that stand out for their success in containing<br />
inflation are Japan and West Germany, and now Australia is<br />
joining their ranks.<br />
But the high and increasing rate of inflation in very significant<br />
parts of the developed world is certainly a major setback to,<br />
world recovery. It means that Australia cannot look to a general<br />
expansion of world trade to provide any real improvement in its<br />
own trading position. </p>
<p>A further factor that has not-assisted the creation of new<br />
employment opportunities has been the failure to contain wage<br />
increases to a reasonable and realistic level.<br />
Through the course of the last financial year, average weekly earni<br />
acain increased by more than the Consumer Price Index.<br />
The real increase in wages has meant that the share of wages<br />
in relation to profits has remained higher than we expected.<br />
Because of the slow growth in world trade, we cannot look to<br />
a resurgence in general overseas trade and markets to lift<br />
our economy, and thus increase employment. Since we are powerless<br />
to affect what happens to the economies of the United<br />
States and Europe, we must rely even more on our own efforts<br />
to get our own economy right.<br />
The firm line we have taken in the fight against inflation<br />
has thus been all the more necessary. It is vital that we<br />
get inflation below that of our major trading partners so that<br />
our industries can become more competitive instead of less<br />
competitive, as in the past.<br />
A lower inflation rate in Australia will bring greater activity<br />
to this country because our industries will be able to capture<br />
a larger share of our own markets, and will be encouraged to<br />
develop new export markets. A lower than average inflation<br />
rate in Australia will also give Australian and overseas<br />
investors the confidence to increase their investment here,<br />
particularly in our natural resources.<br />
By maintaining a firm fiscal and monetary policy, we can<br />
attract a larger share of foreign investment than otherwise<br />
would be the case. This is now becoming evident because<br />
overseas investors as they have said in discussions with mehave<br />
started to couple this economy with the highly efficient<br />
German economy.<br />
It is against this total background that our progress to date<br />
in dealing with unemployment needs to be viewed.<br />
on 14 September, in a significant Parliamentary speech, Tony Stree<br />
outlined in detail the progress made to date and prospects for<br />
increasing employment in the future. He had first discussed this<br />
speech with me prior to the Budget, and we then determined that<br />
it should set out very plainly all the facts on this vital<br />
issue.<br />
The immediate forecast made in the speech, which was consistent<br />
with the Budget forecasts, was that it is likely that a now<br />
peak in unemployment will be reached in January-February 1979.<br />
As Tony Street's statement made clear, the causes of our<br />
unemployment problem are not hard to discern. </p>
<p>During the time of our predecessors in office, wages outstripped<br />
productivity, inflation increased at an alarming rate, and<br />
demand, investment and confidence fell. He went on to say:<br />
" As a Government we believe these problems are<br />
fundamental to the present predicament in the<br />
labour market".<br />
" We have, therefore, consistently advocated maximum<br />
restraint in wage increases and sought to improve<br />
productivity". " We have adopted policies to reduce infaltion and<br />
improved demand, investment and confidence".<br />
" There is increasing acceptance that our policies<br />
have achieved substantial improvement, particularly<br />
when it is recalled that we inherited a deteriorating<br />
economy and worsening world trade".<br />
After reviewing the many difficulties and challenges<br />
which lie ahead in improving employment prospects, he<br />
concluded that: " the best result will be achieved<br />
through the pursuit of ( the Government's) present<br />
economic policies"<br />
In taking this course, the Government is firmly acting in the<br />
best long-term interest of this nation. For it is the only<br />
course which will restore economic health and growth the<br />
growth required to provide more jobs for Australians.<br />
It is not a question of the Government not being concerned<br />
for the unemployed, it is a question of being so concerned that<br />
we are determined to stay with policies which we know in the<br />
longer term will put the matter right. It is a question of<br />
being so concerned that we are not prepared to trade Australia's<br />
longer term future for shorter term political gains. it is<br />
a question of being so concerned that even at the cost of<br />
political popularity for the time being we are determined to<br />
give. Australians the prospect of obtaining and keeping lasting<br />
jobs jobs that they can keep.<br />
The Government's economic policies are succeeding in reducing<br />
inflation and laying the foundations for greater investment<br />
and more jobs.<br />
The annual report of the G. A. T. T. affirmed in the strongest<br />
terms that policies of the kind this Government is pursuing<br />
are the only policies that can be successful. The report<br />
said: " The inescapable conclusion is that the industrial<br />
countries can only move towards increased growth<br />
and employment.. by reducing their inflation rate<br />
to the levels experienced until the mid 1960' s." 1<br />
The tragedy is that for one reason or another, in too many<br />
advanced developed countries, inflation is moving the wron( I<br />
way. It is high and it is increasing.<br />
That will ' have very significant adverse effects for activity<br />
and employment in those countries. It does not mean, however,<br />
that we need suffer the same fate. </p>
<p>Convinced as we are then that our policies are the only ones<br />
to get the Australian economy back on its feet, the question<br />
still needs to be asked: Is the Government doing enough to<br />
alleviate the hardship of unemployment while our other<br />
objectives fall into place?<br />
The Government is providing meaningful help to those who do<br />
not have jobs and providing particular assistance to the<br />
young unemployed. Our NEAT Scheme, the Special Youth<br />
Employment Training Programme and a number of other programmes<br />
are designed to achieve this end.<br />
At the end of June 1978 six times as many people were being<br />
trained under NEAT as at the end of December 1975, and we<br />
have changed NEAT to give a much greater emphasis to on-the-job<br />
training training more directly related to Industries'<br />
needs. Our programm'fes to assist young people include the introduction<br />
of a Special Youth Employment Training Programme. More than<br />
60,000 young people have already been assisted by this<br />
programme since it was introduced in October 1976, and there<br />
are another 40,000 people in training under the Scheme at the<br />
moment. A further 45,000 young people have been assisted under the<br />
Community Youth Support Scheme and the Experimental Programme<br />
for Unemployed Youth provides remedial education assistance<br />
for -young people who have never had a fair go in their whole<br />
lives.<br />
We have never been for one moment complacent about these<br />
schemes, and they have been steadily modified, expanded and<br />
improved as we have gained experience with them..<br />
I believe that these training programmes are better than those<br />
in most other countries, for we have avoided the pitfall of<br />
locking labour into unprofitable industries, a problem which<br />
some overseas organisations are becoming very concerned about.<br />
But the Government's foresight went beyond the establishment<br />
of vocational training programmes. We were concerned in 1976<br />
about the problems which Australian industry faced: the<br />
need to become more competitive; to increase its productivity<br />
and technological capacity; to adapt smoothly to structural<br />
change.<br />
Accordingly, long before the current debate on these issues<br />
became widespread, we looked ahead and set a number of actions<br />
in train. We established the Williams Inquiry into education<br />
and training: we initiated an Inquiry chaired by Sir John Crawford<br />
to recommend ways in which industry might best adapt to necessary<br />
structural change; we established a separate Department of<br />
Productivity; and we authorised the first review ever made of<br />
the Commonwealth Employment Service. / 7 </p>
<p>The Inquiry under Professor Williams was set up in October 1976.<br />
We were concerned to make sure that our educational system was<br />
adequately designed to meet the educational needs and preferences<br />
of the individual, and the requirements of the labour market.<br />
The results of that long and difficult inquiry will, I hope, be<br />
available within weeks, and we are looking for a constructive<br />
report which will clearly involve the States and many sections<br />
of the community in its implementation.<br />
At the same time as the Williams Inquiry was established, the<br />
Government also commissioned the present Chairman of the<br />
Australian'Broadcasting Commission, Mr Norgard, to make a<br />
comprehensive and detailed examination of the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service. This was the first inquiry into the C. E. S.<br />
since its inception.,<br />
The Inquiry reported late last year and we have acted on the<br />
report to upgrade the C. E. S. with the aim of making-it a<br />
modern and efficient employment and counselling service.<br />
Since coming to office the Government has also sought to give<br />
every encouragement to Australian industry to increase its<br />
competitiveness in domestic and world trade. OuLr successful<br />
anti-inflationary strategy has been of most direct benefit,<br />
but a number of other complementary initiatives have also been<br />
taken.<br />
Over a year ago, we established the Crawford Inquiry to examine<br />
the adjustment problems which face the most highly protected<br />
Australian industries and ascertain how we might best maintain<br />
the long term strength, stability and viability of Australian<br />
manufacturing industry.<br />
Two years ago, being most conscious of the need for Australian<br />
industry to improve its productivity and adapt effectively to<br />
the newest technological development, the Government established<br />
a separate Department of Productivity.<br />
I seem to recall that the new Department was greeted at the time<br />
with a degree of scepticism. one editorial even sought to<br />
dismiss it as the Department of Silly Walks.<br />
In retrospect, it is now the editorial rather than the Department<br />
which looks distinctly silly. Ian Macphee and his officers have<br />
been particularly successful in developing joint programmes<br />
involving management, unions and government in finding wasy to<br />
increase productivity particularly through new technology<br />
in highly protected industries.<br />
Such tripartite consultations are presently underway in the<br />
footwear, clothing, textiles, forging, tyres, tanning and<br />
whitegoods industries. </p>
<p>The adoption by industry of the latest technology can often<br />
lead to an increase in employment. It is true that in the<br />
narrowest sense new technology may lead to a particular<br />
article being produced by fewer employees. But because of<br />
the cost reduction brought about by new technology, demand is<br />
increased both by Australian and overseas customers for the<br />
goods concerned.<br />
Furthermore, the general purchasing power of consumers is<br />
increased and overall demand is strengthened. The introduction<br />
ofthe latest techniques is the best overall strategy for<br />
employment. Without adopting new technology the industries concerned<br />
will falter and jobs will be lost. Moreover, by developing<br />
and exploiting new technology, we can create entirely new<br />
products and systems, such as Interscan and this creates<br />
more jobs.<br />
Fear of new technology is no more justified in 1978 than it<br />
was justified at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.<br />
We have a great opportunity to play a major role in world<br />
trade, particularly in Asia, because of our resources and<br />
because of our skilled workforce. By producing high quality,<br />
technologically advanced products for domestic and world<br />
markets, the prospects for Australian manufacturing industry<br />
will be bright.<br />
These long term initiatives which I have mentioned, which were<br />
begun one and two years ago, demonstrate the Government's acute<br />
awareness of these problems of technology, structural change<br />
in industry and employment. I am delighted that there is now<br />
a widespread debate on these subjects.<br />
In the coming months, the Government will be activ ely seeking<br />
to involve the community in the challenges which these issues<br />
provide. This consultation will not take place in forums<br />
which would only provide a political platform without<br />
achieving any result. Rather, they will be working groups<br />
comprising representatives of those sections of the community<br />
most directly involved in these vital issues.<br />
Tony Street has called a meeting of labour Ministers as one element<br />
of that broader-based discussion an initiative which I note<br />
Neville Wran sought to claim as his own in his recent policy speec.<br />
As I have indicated, tripartite discussions are already underway<br />
in a number of industries with the assistance of the<br />
Department of Productivity. When the reports of the William<br />
Inquiry and Crawford Inquiry are to hand, I would also expect<br />
widespread consultation to take place. / 9 </p>
<p>The decision to establish a powerful committee of Cabinet,<br />
under the chairmanship of Tony Street, to review the basis<br />
of our industrial relations is also closely related to these<br />
issues. During our period of less than three years in office, the<br />
Government with Tony Street as its Minister for Employment<br />
and Industrial Relations has achieved a remarkable<br />
improvement in industrial relations in this country.<br />
That does not mean to say that the Government is satisfied<br />
with the present situation. Three of the basic aspects of<br />
our industrial relations which Tony Street's committee will be<br />
examining are the practical processes of consultation between<br />
concerned parties; the creation of a public opinion aware<br />
of the consequences of industrial disputes on unemployment;<br />
and the legislative framework of industrial relations.<br />
We have made progress in all three areas, but while much has<br />
been done there is always room for improvement. It is this<br />
Government which established a permanent National Labor<br />
Consultative Committee in which Government, employers and<br />
employees can sit down together to discuss important industrial<br />
relations issues.<br />
Through the work of Tony Street's committee, we hope to<br />
achieve a better climate of industrial relations. Tony Street<br />
returned this morning from a visit to Japan, accompanied by<br />
representatives of employers and Trade Unions. The purpose<br />
of that visit was to discuss the impact which good industrial<br />
relations can have in further developing our mutually profitable<br />
and beneficial trading relationship with Japan.<br />
The impact of a reduction in industrial disputes could be very<br />
great indeed. To take one example, if a deeper understandinq<br />
of this issue were to lead to a reduction in industrial<br />
disputes on the waterfront, the impact on our exports and on<br />
the confidence of our purchasers would be substantial.<br />
Tony Street's committee will also be examining the vital issue<br />
of how to idevelop a much wider understanding throughout the<br />
community and the Trade Union Movement that industrial<br />
stoppages wherever they occur keep Australian men and<br />
women out of work.<br />
We have already established a legislative framework to provide<br />
just and fair laws to protect all parties to an industrial<br />
dispute as well as the interests of the general public.<br />
But the committee will be examining the need for<br />
modifications in this area. Good industrial relations cannot,<br />
however, be produced by laws alone. But the charter of Tony Street's<br />
Cabinet committee is a wide and important one. The committee's<br />
task is of crucial significance because greater success in<br />
this area would significantly boost our general economic<br />
performance and complement the Government's economic policies. </p>
<p>Mr President, I have stressed today the importance of<br />
consultation and community involvement. In all the great<br />
social issues that face Australian society, government alone<br />
can never provide all the solutions.<br />
Whether it is the needs of the aged, the migrant, the<br />
handicapped, the sole parent, or the unemployed, effective<br />
help will only be provided through the closest co-operation<br />
between government and voluntary organisations.<br />
You, by your involvement in Rotary, demonstrate your public<br />
spirit and commitment to assisting those in need.<br />
I believe that Australia is the land of opportunity. We have<br />
the opportunity to develop together a society which is most<br />
conscious of its responsibilities to human rights and human<br />
dignity. A society which promises effective help to those<br />
in need.<br />
By working together we can realise these opportunities.<br />
