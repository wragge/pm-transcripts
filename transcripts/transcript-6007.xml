THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE RT HON.<br />

i COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA </p>
<p>Uranium-Australia's Decision<br />
Statement by the Right Hon. Malcolm Fraser, M. P.<br />
Prime Mimster<br />
AUSTRALIAN URANIUM POLICY<br />
SINCE the tabling of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry's first<br />
report on 11 November 1976, there has been a wide-ranging debate<br />
inside the Parliament and in the public arena. During this time, the Government<br />
has given painstaking consideration to the Ranger Inquiry's valuable<br />
and constructive reports and to all other information available to it on<br />
uranium mining and export. This exhaustive consideration of the issues<br />
and evidence has led the Government to decide that there should be further<br />
development of uranium under strictly controlled conditions.<br />
This decision has been motivated by a high sense of moral responsibility<br />
to all Australians and to the community of nations. It has flowed from<br />
four fundamental considerations:<br />
the need to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation;<br />
the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy-deficient<br />
world; the need to protect effectively the environment in which mining<br />
development will take place;<br />
the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the welfare<br />
and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers Region<br />
and of all other people living in the Region and working on the<br />
development projects.<br />
Mr Speaker, before proceeding, I wish to take this opportunity to pay<br />
tribute to the presiding Commissioner of the Ranger Inquiry, Mr Justice<br />
Fox, and to his fellow Commissioners, Mr G. G. Kelleher and Professor<br />
C. B. Kerr. They have had to make recommendations on a complex set<br />
of problems on which there are diverse and strongly held opinions in<br />
the community. They have discharged their commission with wisdom and<br />
sensitivity. Since then I have appointed Mr Justice Fox as adviser to the Government<br />
on nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards matters. He is<br />
overseas and doing invaluable work.<br />
The Ranger Inquiry was, of course, established by the previous<br />
Government. It looked at both the world-wide and the local regional<br />
environmental issues associated with the mining and export of uranium:<br />
the issues of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear safeguards;<br />
the contribution of nuclear power to world energy requirements;<br />
the economic implications of uranium export for Australia.<br />
The Government has examined every recommendation in the Inquiry's<br />
Reports. Only in a few cases have the Government's decisions varied from<br />
the Inquiry's recommendations. Ministers will explain the reasons for<br />
every variation. The Government believes that every variation meets the<br />
Inquiry's request that it should ' just as satisfactorily achieve the same </p>
<p>purposes and satisfy the same principles' as the Inquiry's proposal.<br />
The Government's decision was taken on the basis of the Inquiry's<br />
principal findings and recommendations.<br />
On uranium mining, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if those activities<br />
are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a<br />
decision not to develop Australian uranium mines.'<br />
The Government is now satisfied that the environmertal control and<br />
industrial health measures proposed by the Inquiry and accepted by the<br />
Government, will provide proper regulation and control.<br />
On nuclear power reactors, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear<br />
power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and<br />
controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell<br />
Australian uranium.'<br />
This is in accordance with the Government's own view.<br />
On waste disposal from nuclear power stations, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' While we do not think that the waste situation is at present such<br />
as to justify Australia wholly refusing to export uranium, it is<br />
plain that the situation demands careful watching, and depending<br />
on developments, regular and frequent reassessment.'<br />
The Government is satisfied that the technology exists for the safe<br />
management and ultimate disposal of highly radioactive waste. International<br />
developments will continue to be closely reviewed and Australia<br />
will continue to participate in international studies directed to improve<br />
standards for waste disposal.<br />
On the possibility of nuclear terrorism, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' In our view, the possibility of nuclear terrorism merits energetic<br />
consideration and action at the international level. We do not<br />
believe that this risk alone constitutes a sufficient reason for Australia<br />
declining to supply uranium. It does, however, provide a further<br />
reason why the export of our uranium, including what is proposed<br />
to be done with it, and where, are matters which the Government<br />
should keep under constant scrutiny and control.'<br />
The Government is satisfied that the specification of standards of<br />
physical security by the International Atomic Energy Agency constitutes<br />
the basis upon which national governments can provide strong protection<br />
against nuclear terrorism.<br />
On A ustralia's international obligations, the Inquiry concluded:<br />
' A total refusal to supply would place Australian in clear breach of<br />
Article IV of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and could adversely<br />
affect its relation to countries which are parties to the<br />
Article IV of the Treaty obliges Australia to co-operate in the production<br />
and usage of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The export by Australia<br />
of uranium under stringent safeguards would give effect to our obligations<br />
under Articles III and IV of the Treaty. </p>
<p>I would remind the House that Australia became a party to the Treaty<br />
and accepted the obligations it imposed, in January 1973, when the<br />
Treaty was ratified by the then Labor Government.<br />
Overall, the Inquiry concluded that the total renunciation of any<br />
intention to supply uranium was undesirable and most unlikely to produce<br />
any worthwhile outcome. On the basis of this conclusion, the Inquiry<br />
submitted that ' the options were either to proceed to supply as soon as<br />
-practicable, or to delay making a decision about supplying for a period of<br />
several years'.<br />
The Inquiry stated that the choice between these two options ' depended<br />
largely on what was deemed to be the best strategy in relation to the matter<br />
of proliferation.' The proliferation of nuclear weapons was, in the Inquiry's<br />
view, the most serious hazard associated with the nuclear power industry.<br />
Responding to this danger within the context of international demands<br />
for energy has been the fundamental basis of the Government's decision.<br />
The Government, having considered the Inquiry's Report and all the other<br />
evidence before it, has decided that the goals of limiting the proliferation<br />
of nuclear weapons, and alleviating the world's energy problems are best<br />
served by Australia agreeing now to the export of uranium.<br />
The Government well appreciates the concern some people feel about<br />
nuclear energy. Sir MacFarlane Burnet summarised these concerns well<br />
when he wrote recently:<br />
' As a biologist I should have preferred that there had never been<br />
developed the military and industrial exploitation of nuclear power.'<br />
But we cannot absolve ourselves from the necessity of making decisions<br />
on nuclear energy by wishing that it had never been developed.<br />
As Sir MacFarlane went on to say:<br />
' I believe that a majority of thoughtful people accept the inevitability<br />
for at least an interim period, of large scale use of nuclear energy<br />
in most parts of the world'.<br />
' Things being as they are, nuclear power generators will be needed foi<br />
the next twenty, or perhaps fifty, years in most of the developed<br />
countries, with Japan and Sweden in particular need.'<br />
The Government has taken its decision with a deep sense of international<br />
responsibility. I venture to say that were it not for that sense of responsibility,<br />
were it not for our wish to strengthen Australia's voice in the moves against<br />
the proliferation of nuclear weapons, were it not for our obligation ' to<br />
I* provide energy to an energy deficient world, we would not have decided to<br />
export uranium. Commercial considerations were not the dominant motive<br />
in our decision. In themselves they would not have been sufficient.<br />
The oil crisis of 1973 precipitated the fundamental recognition that the<br />
world was facing an energy crisis.<br />
While Australia has been insulated from the effects of the oil crisis by<br />
a plentiful supply of energy resources, the dwindling supply of petroleum has<br />
meant that many countries must change over to other sources of energy. </p>
<p>The energy-deficient countries are aiming to conserve energy, to use<br />
existing resources such as coal more effectively, and to develop new energy<br />
sources-including solar, wind, tidal and others. But these sources will<br />
not realistically provide energy on a sufficiently large scale this century.<br />
Nuclear energy is the only readily available alternative most countries<br />
have to meet their essential need for electrical energy in the wake of the<br />
oil crisis. One hundred and eighty-four nuclear power units are in operation in<br />
countries, with a capacity of 88 thousand megawatts of electricity-four<br />
times Australia's total electrical capacity. Many more nuclear power units<br />
are under construction or on order.<br />
Very substantial quantities of uranium are required to fuel them.<br />
It is manifest that:<br />
there is a need for nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in a number<br />
of countries poorly endowed with fossil fuels;<br />
there is a world wide growth of the nuclear industry;<br />
there is a widespread concern about whether uranium will be available<br />
to satisfy these needs.<br />
Because of their concern about uranium supplies, some countries are<br />
turning to those nuclear technologies involving reprocessing and the fast<br />
breeder reactor would achieve the more effective use of available<br />
uranium but which would increase the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation.<br />
Australia possesses 20 per cent of the western world's known reserves<br />
of low cost uranium. In this situation we are in a special position of<br />
influence and have a corresponding moral responsibility to maximise<br />
protection against nuclear weapons proliferation by responding to the<br />
needs of many countries for adequate assurances of uranium supplies.<br />
Australia has an obligyation to the rest of the world to provide the<br />
energy resources-the coal, gas and uranium-that will be required to<br />
overcome the energy crisis.<br />
By taking the decision to export uranium, Australia can supply:<br />
energy that will provide jobs;<br />
energy that will heat homes;<br />
energy that will protect standards of living and enable them to be<br />
improved.<br />
By taking the decision to export uranium, Australia can slow the<br />
movement towards the use of plutonium as a nuclear fuel and lessen the<br />
attendant increased risks of nuclear weapons proliferation.<br />
By taking the decision to export uranium, Australia's ability to support<br />
more effective safeguards and minimise proliferation risks will be<br />
strengthened. Nuclear Non-Proliferation<br />
There is a mounting international impetus to strengthen barriers to nuclear<br />
weapons proliferation. Increasing international consultation and discussion<br />
is taking place. 4 </p>
<p>At the London Economic Summit in May, President Carter proposed<br />
the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation to examine and find the<br />
best solutions to problems with the nuclear fuel cycle. President Carter's<br />
proposal was accepted. International studies will soon commence.<br />
Australia has been invited to participate in the International Nuclear<br />
Fuel Cycle Evaluation and has accepted.<br />
Australia's ability to influence these developments will depend to a<br />
great extent on whether or not it is a major supplier of uranium. Only<br />
as a producer and supplier of uranium can Australia be an effective<br />
force in achieving improved international safeguards and controls.<br />
The Government's policy on nuclear safeguards--announced in this<br />
House on 24 May 1977-which in some instances goes beyond the<br />
Inquiry's recommendations, is directed at reducing the risks of nuclear<br />
weapons proliferation. This policy is stricter and more rigorous than that<br />
adopted to date by any nuclear supplier country. It encompasses the<br />
the requirements the Leader of the Opposition laid down in this House<br />
on 29 March 1977 and indeed it goes beyond them in many respects.<br />
The policy is based on an objective assessment of the conditions<br />
necessary to ensure that the uranium we supply to others for peaceful<br />
purposes is not misused and that our unqualified commitment to the<br />
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is put into effect.<br />
We urge the universal adoption of safeguards standards of similarly high<br />
quality. We will vigilantly monitor developments and continue to work<br />
internationally, and with other major suppliers to increase the effectiveness<br />
of international controls and safeguards.<br />
By exporting uranium and standing with the United States and Canada<br />
on the crucial issue of adequate safeguards Australia is contributing to<br />
the application of effective nuclear safeguards and to the avoidance of<br />
the misuse of nuclear materials. We would hope that South Africa, the<br />
other major exporter in the southern hemisphere, can see its way clear<br />
to join in this endeavour.<br />
The joint efforts of Australia, Canada and the United States on the<br />
safeguards issue should not be misunderstood. There is no intention or<br />
desire to form a cartel for the supply of uranium. We want no part of a<br />
uranium OPEC. Our aim is to minimise the risk of nuclear weapons<br />
proliferation. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs will be following me with<br />
a detailed statement on the international implications, including safeguards,<br />
of the Government's decision.<br />
Spent Fuel Reprocessing and Waste Disposal<br />
The issue of the safe and responsible management of the plutonium<br />
and the highly radioactive waste arising from the reprocessing of the spent<br />
fuel is also a matter of concern.<br />
The spent fuel rods leaving the nuclear power reactors now in<br />
commercial operation are highly radioactive but this spent fuel can be. and<br />
is being, safely stored. This is not the key problem. The problems arise </p>
<p>when the spent fuel is reprocessed, and the plutonium is separated from<br />
the highly radioactive fission products.<br />
This poses two difficulties; the safe storage and protection of the<br />
plutonium which is now in a form that lends itself more readily to theft<br />
and diversion to nuclear weapons, and the highly radioactive liquid wastes<br />
which have to be carefully managed before solidification and ultimate<br />
safe and permanent disposal.<br />
The technology for the handling, solidification and safe storage of the<br />
high level radioactive liquids exists. It is now being developed to a<br />
commercial scale. This technology has not hitherto been put into full scale<br />
use as the quantity of commercially produced waste has not warranted<br />
a fully comnmercial process.<br />
Because plutonium is a material suitable for nuclear explosives and<br />
because of the desire to minimise proliferation, the U. S. Government has<br />
placed a moratorium on spent fuel reprocessing and the Australian<br />
Government has reserved its position on reprocessing.<br />
For this reason, the Government's announced safeguards policy<br />
requires prior Australian consent before the spent fuel derived from<br />
Australian uranium may be reprocessed. Some of our major potential<br />
customers would have preferred a more permissive Australian policy<br />
on reprocessing. But we have reserved Australia's position to ensure<br />
that, in relation to the uranium we supply, the potential problems associated<br />
with reprocessing are dealt with. We shall need to be satisfied, for example:<br />
that there is a need to reprocess for legitimate energy purposes;<br />
that interijational controls and safeguards are intensified to ensure<br />
an adequate and effective defence against diversion of plutonium to<br />
I' non-peaceful purposes;<br />
-that there is not excessive stock-piling of plutonium in a way that<br />
could pose future proliferation dangers.<br />
We shall be seeking constructive answers on these questions in the<br />
International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation, in which Australia shall be<br />
participating, and in discussions with other countries.<br />
Although Australia as a major exporter of uranium will be involved<br />
closely in international studies concerned with reprocessing and the<br />
nuclear fuel cycle there is no intention of Australia storing other countries'<br />
radioactive wastes.<br />
In addition to the compelling non-proliferation and energy considerations<br />
on which the Government's decision is based, it should also be noted that<br />
the mining and export of uranium will enhance Australia's reputation<br />
as a stable and reliable supplier of resources, and bring Australia tangible<br />
I I economic benefits.<br />
Mr Speaker, the Government has faced up to the many complex and<br />
sensitive international issues raised by the worldwide use of uranium.<br />
The Government is convinced that uranium mining and export should<br />
proceed. To do otherwise, would be to: 6 </p>
<p>deny Australia an effective voice in strengthening safeguards and<br />
non-proliferation measures;<br />
accelerate moves to the plutonium economy with its proliferation<br />
risks;<br />
abandon the world's energy poor countries, amongst whom are<br />
numbered our major trading partners;<br />
deny Australia significant economic benefits.<br />
I now turn to domestic considerations and the conditions on which<br />
particular projects will be permitted to proceed.<br />
The Inquiry's Second Report dealt specifically with the Ranger Project,<br />
in the context of the single ecosystem of the Alligator Rivers Region in<br />
which the project is located. As the Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits are<br />
also located in the Region, the Inquiry considered them in relationship<br />
to the Region as a whole.<br />
The Government's decision will clear the way for decisions on the<br />
development of other uranium deposits throughout the Commonwealth,<br />
as well as those in the Alligator Rivers Region.<br />
The Government has decided, that uranium development projects will be<br />
permitted to proceed only if they satisfy certain conditions:<br />
the mining operations must conform with a mandatory ' code of<br />
practice' which the Government shall progressively prescribe;<br />
the requirements of the Environmental Protection ( Impact of<br />
Proposals) Act 1974 must be complied with;<br />
the Government must be satisfied as to the acceptability of the<br />
development on the environment and on the Aboriginal people-the<br />
total level of activity will be taken into account in this regard;<br />
the sale contracts for the uranium produced must conform<br />
with the Government's safeguards policy.<br />
Sequential Development<br />
With respect to the Alligator Rivers Region, the Inquiry envisaged a planned<br />
sequence of development of uranium deposits.<br />
The Government has decided that in view of the complexity of the<br />
further development of each of the projects, it would be impossible properly<br />
to specify the sequence of mining, either as to order or timing.<br />
The Government notes, however, that the requirements it has set down<br />
and the processes of negotiation which must be carried on between the<br />
mining companies and Aboriginal land owners will in fact lead to<br />
any development being of a sequential nature.<br />
The Inquiry was not concerned to examine uranium development<br />
outside the Region. The Government sees no reason at this time to specify<br />
the sequence of uranium projects elsewhere in Australia. But it would<br />
consider any advice on this aspect given to it by the Uranium Advisory<br />
Council and other appropriate bodies. </p>
<p>I Mining and Wiling<br />
The Government has decided to accept all the Inquiry's recommendations<br />
and findings, relating to the mining and milling of uranium.<br />
There shall be a uniform Australian code covering the mining and<br />
milling of uranium. The code will be mandatory and implemented<br />
' I progressively by legislation together with the States and Territories,<br />
commencing with the ' Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the<br />
Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores' which has already been prepared<br />
and published by the Department of Health. The code of practice will<br />
be prescribed by Commonwealth legislation, but where State or Terr-itory<br />
legislation has an equal or more stringent code, the Commonwealth<br />
legislation will be held-in reserve and the administration of the code will<br />
be left entirely in the hands of that State or Territory.<br />
This decision, in fact, goes beyond the recommendation of the Inquiry<br />
* and indicates the Government's concern for adequate and effective<br />
control and regulation of uranium operations.<br />
I now turn to the specific recommendations of the Inquiry with regard to<br />
the Alligator Rivers Region.<br />
Environmental Controls<br />
The Government has decided to adopt the recommendations of the<br />
Inquiry relating to environmental controls in the Region.<br />
In making any decision on specific projects in the Alligator Rivers Region,<br />
the Government will be highly conscious of the need to ensure that the total<br />
level of activity in the Region is taken into account.<br />
The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development<br />
will elaborate shortly on the means we shall adopt to ensure proper<br />
environmental supervision and co-ordination in the region.<br />
National Parks<br />
The Inquiry made various recommendations concerning a National Park.<br />
The Government has decided to accept the recommendation of the<br />
: 11 Inquiry that a major National Park should be established in the Region<br />
to protect and preserve the natural features, the flora and fauna, the<br />
Aboriginal sacred sites and cave paintings.<br />
The Inquiry recommended that the full extent of the Park should be<br />
declared at one time but acknowledged that the Park might be declared in<br />
II progressive stages, and indicated what the first stage might be.<br />
The Government has decided to declare the Na tional Park in stages.<br />
The area which will be declared first is substantially greater than that<br />
gazetted in 1975 for the Kakadu National Park, and greater than the first<br />
stage suggested by the Inquiry. It includes all the land subject to Aboriginal<br />
II land claims recommended by the Inquiry. 8 </p>
<p>The full area recommended by the Inquiry for inclusion in the National<br />
Park, other than that covered by the initial declaration, will be brought<br />
immediately under special control. This control will be exercised, initially,<br />
through the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs, Environment, Housing and<br />
Community Development, National Resources, and the Northern Territory<br />
with the Department of National Resources having the principal role<br />
in relation to exploration and mining. Special arrangements will be<br />
established to ensure proper co-ordination of the activities of the four<br />
Departments in exercising such controls.<br />
There will be no exploration, development or mining, at least for the<br />
time being, within the area initially declared as a National Park.<br />
There will be no exploration, development or mining within the<br />
remaining area, except with the express approval of the Commonwealth<br />
authorities involved.<br />
The Government accepts the recommendation of the Inquiry that the<br />
town should be included in the National Park but should not be<br />
Aboriginal land.<br />
The Government has decided to accept the Inquiry's recommendation<br />
that the Ranger and Pancontinental lease areas should be excluded from the<br />
National Park. On the same basis. the Government has decided that the<br />
Noranda lease area should be excluded. The Government has made these<br />
exclusions without commitment to order or timing of any development.<br />
Because of the Government's requirement that it be satisfied as to the<br />
acceptability of the impact of each development on the environment, a<br />
considerable amount of planning and investigation into the environmental<br />
effects of any development of Noranda's deposit at Koongarra will have<br />
to be undertaken. That deposit has particular environmental problems<br />
because of the sensitivity and fragility of the environment of the area and<br />
the location of the deposit upstream of a major wetlands area.<br />
The Aboriginal People<br />
With regard to the Aboriginal people, the Government has decided to<br />
accept all of the Inquiry's recommendations for the enhancement of their<br />
welfare. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will have general responsibility<br />
for the oversight of the impact of development on the Aboriginal population<br />
and co-ordination of measures to moderate that impact.<br />
All the recommendations of the Inquiry on the granting of land to<br />
Aboriginals and the legislative changes to enable Aboriginal land to<br />
become part of a National Park have been accepted.<br />
The Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases will be purchased<br />
from the present lessees to create an opportunity for Aboriginal land<br />
claims to be made and determined as recommended by the Inquiry. </p>
<p>Aboriginals will have new opportunities to control the use of their<br />
traditional lands and to protect their interests. The Government will<br />
adopt special measures designed to advance the wellbeing of Aboriginals<br />
and Aboriginal interests in the Region. Special efforts will be made to train<br />
them to be rangers in the National Park so that they may care for their<br />
land-the land of their ancestors and so be responsible for the protection<br />
of their sacred sites.<br />
Revenues from Mining<br />
Substantial revenue from royalties on uranium mined in the region'will<br />
be applied to the welfare of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory generally<br />
and not solely to those in local communities affected by the mining<br />
operation or to individuals.<br />
Part of the increased revenues which the Government will derive from<br />
uranium development will be used in substantial additional funding of<br />
solar energy research as part of our National Energy Programme. The<br />
Deputy Prime Minister will speak further on this subject shortly in his<br />
statement. The Memorandum of Understanding<br />
With respect to the Ranger project itself, the Government is most conscious<br />
that the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and<br />
the Ranger partners entered into in October 1975 more than three months<br />
after the Ranger Inquiry had been established, would not have been the<br />
Government's preferred approach to mineral development. However, the<br />
Government would not wish to disturb arrangements entered into in good<br />
faith by the companies with the previous Government. We believe, as<br />
a matter of principle, that the repudiation by one Government of contracts<br />
entered into by a previous Government would be quite wrong.<br />
The Government has therefore decided to continue arrangements<br />
existing under the Memorandum of Understanding. As a consequence, the<br />
Government has had to vary the recommendation of the Inquiry of the<br />
exclusion of the Ranger Special Mineral Lease Area from the National Park.<br />
It will be necessary to exclude the entire Ranger Project Area of some<br />
83 square kilometres from the park subject to the adjustment of the southern<br />
boundary to move it further from Aboriginal sacred sites at Mount<br />
Brockman, as recommended by the Inquiry.<br />
For the same reason, the Government is unable to accept the<br />
recommendation of the Inquiry that the Atomic Energy Act not be used<br />
for the granting of an authority to Ranger to mine uranium. The<br />
Government notes that the Inquiry stated that its concerns about the<br />
use of the Atomic Energy Act would be lessened if the proposed<br />
Uranium Advisory Council were established. The Government has </p>
<p>decided to establish the Uranium Advisory Council with the roles<br />
recommended by the Inquiry, and within the portfolio responsibility of<br />
the Minister for National Resources.<br />
It should not be thought that the Commonwealth's participation in<br />
the Memorandum of Understanding will give Ranger an advantage over<br />
other mining companies. We will ensure that Government participation in<br />
the Ranger development will not accord specific marketing advantage to<br />
this project.<br />
The Government agrees in principle with the Inquiry that there should<br />
be a uranium marketing authority which will ensure that the Government<br />
has proper knowledge and oversight of the commercial arrangements<br />
for the sale and export of uranium.<br />
The Deputy Prime Minister will elaborate further on this matter in his<br />
statement.<br />
Regional Management<br />
The Government endorses the Inquiry's view, that the Alligator Rivers<br />
Region should be managed in its totality in conformity with a land use plan.<br />
We look forward to the time when the management of the region, with<br />
its various planned uses, produces an harmonious relationship between the<br />
various activies: mining, tourism, park management and environmental<br />
protection. It is our strong desire that the management of the region should become<br />
not a national but a world-wide model of how forethought and planning,<br />
good management and goodwill can lead to natural resources being<br />
obtained with a minimum of interference to a region's inhabitants and its<br />
environment.<br />
The Government's Position<br />
Mr Speaker, I wish to make the Government's position quite plain.<br />
Uranium mining may now proceed, but only in ways which will<br />
not destroy or spoil the national heritage of the region with its<br />
magnificent scenery and unique ecosystems and which will not harm those<br />
specific areas of the Region considered sacred or of deep significance by<br />
the Aboriginal people.<br />
The export of Australian uranium will decrease the risks of further<br />
proliferation of nuclear weapons and will support and strengthen the Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty. It will help to make a safer world.<br />
The advent of Australia as a major supplier of uranium will make<br />
certain that Australia's voice on this most vital problem of international<br />
affairs -nuclear weapons proliferation-will be heard.<br />
