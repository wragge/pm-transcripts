<p>Well thank you very much Mr Wilson. To the Right Reverend Bishop Kernot,</p>
<p> the head of Anglicare in Australia and here in Victoria; to Major</p>
<p> Brian Watters; to my Colleague Michael Wooldridge, the Federal Minister</p>
<p> for Health; to Philip Baressi, the Federal Member for Deakin; other</p>
<p> members of Parliament, representatives of the various organisations</p>
<p> concerned about the drug problem, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I would first of all like to thank Anglicare for the opportunity of</p>
<p> launching this second round of Federal Government financial support</p>
<p> for treatment programs here at its Victorian headquarters. Anglicare</p>
<p> is one of the major frontline welfare organisations in Australia.</p>
<p> It's an organisation which is an important part of the social coalition</p>
<p> that is needed in Australia to deal with difficult welfare issues</p>
<p> and to tackle major social problems. I use the expression social coalition</p>
<p> very deliberately to underline the point that no one section of the</p>
<p> community is adequate to the task of dealing with underprivilege,</p>
<p> or adequate to the task of dealing with a challenge such as drug abuse.</p>
<p>The Government alone cannot beat the drug problem. Individuals alone</p>
<p> cannot beat the drug problem. Families need help to tackle the drug</p>
<p> problem, and we need as individuals, as family members and as leaders</p>
<p> of the Government, we need to enlist a frontline experience and support</p>
<p> of organisations such as Anglicare. And that is why it is entirely</p>
<p> appropriate that on the day in which I announce a further Commonwealth</p>
<p> financial commitment, of the details of a further Commonwealth financial</p>
<p> commitment to the treatment programs which are an important part of</p>
<p> our tough on drugs strategy, I do so here at the headquarters of one</p>
<p> of those organisations that is an important element in the fight against</p>
<p> drugs, and indeed the general campaign to deliver a fairer, more decent,</p>
<p> and just society.</p>
<p>The drug problem has been very much in the news in recent weeks. Not</p>
<p> because it's something that has suddenly arrived, but through a combination</p>
<p> of circumstances there has been a level of public preoccupation with</p>
<p> and concentration on it that I don't think I have experienced at any</p>
<p> time since I entered Parliament almost 25 years ago.</p>
<p>I don't pretend for a moment as Prime Minister that what my Government</p>
<p> has done has provided all of the answers. And it is not essentially</p>
<p> an issue that should be divided on party political lines. There are</p>
<p> people who are deeply concerned about this issue and have something</p>
<p> to contribute on this issue from all strands of political life in</p>
<p> Australia, both State and Federal. And I would hope to the maximum</p>
<p> degree possible that the effort at a government level to deal with</p>
<p> the problem should be on a bipartisan basis. And that will certainly</p>
<p> be the approach that I will take as Prime Minister to the Premiers'</p>
<p> Conference on the 9th of April when this issue will be the main business</p>
<p> of the afternoon session of that particular conference. And I've said</p>
<p> before and I repeat it, that I will work as freely and willingly with</p>
<p> a Labor Premier of any of the States of Australia as I will with a</p>
<p> Liberal or National Party Premier.</p>
<p>The Government's Tough on Drugs Strategy which involves the expenditure</p>
<p> of about $290 million, in dollar terms is the largest commitment by</p>
<p> any Federal government to such a strategy. I don't say that to score</p>
<p> a point but merely to record a fact and I appreciate the fact that</p>
<p> on a number of issues I have received public support and endorsement</p>
<p> from the Leader of the Labor Opposition in the Federal Parliament.</p>
<p> The Tough on Drugs Strategy recognises that action is needed on three</p>
<p> levels. We need to continue to commit further resources to law enforcement</p>
<p> and some of the evidence of the benefit of the additional resources</p>
<p> committed by the Federal Government to both Customs and Federal Police,</p>
<p> the stationing of officers of the Australian Federal Police in source</p>
<p> countries and countries through which drugs have passed from their</p>
<p> original source, has already begun to pay dividends. Once again I</p>
<p> don't overplay that but equally we shouldn't understate it.</p>
<p>It is true that it is a very difficult fight and it is easy for people</p>
<p> to despair, it is easy for people to throw up their arms and say:</p>
<p> we haven't solved the problem, we appear to be losing ground. And</p>
<p> cast around in the mistaken belief that by abandoning everything that</p>
<p> has been done thus far we will be suddenly more successful in dealing</p>
<p> with the problem in the future. It is a battle of attrition and it</p>
<p> is a battle of attrition which requires of all sections of the community</p>
<p> a determined commitment both of human resources and also of financial</p>
<p> resources from both the State and Federal Governments. And part of</p>
<p> that is obviously law enforcement. And part of it must be continued</p>
<p> co-operation between not only the federal agencies such as Customs</p>
<p> and the Federal Police, but also the maximum co-operation between</p>
<p> the Federal Police and the police of the various States. And the success</p>
<p> that has been achieved in relation to heroin and cocaine seizures</p>
<p> in recent months has very much been a consequence of enhanced and</p>
<p> more effective co-operation between the law enforcement agencies of</p>
<p> the Commonwealth and the law enforcement agencies of the State polices.</p>
<p>The second component of course is education. There can be no limit</p>
<p> to the requirement that people, particularly young people, children</p>
<p> be educated about the drug menace. There should be in my view, and</p>
<p> I make no apology for saying this, there should be absolutely no reluctance</p>
<p> at any level to pursue as vigorously as possible the Tough on Drug</p>
<p> message within our schools. I can't think of a higher priority, I</p>
<p> can't think of something where we should have a less complicated and</p>
<p> a less uncompromising approach than the absolute determination to</p>
<p> pursue the drug menace within our schools.</p>
<p>So therefore the second and equally important element of our campaign</p>
<p> is to provide resources to educate the community against the menace</p>
<p> of drugs. And we have set aside about $17.5 million for a plan to</p>
<p> campaign at a Federal level against illicit drugs in schools, and</p>
<p> to send the strongest possible message to school students about the</p>
<p> danger and the threat posed by drugs. Not only to the young but to</p>
<p> the community generally. And in a sense it's unfortunate that so much</p>
<p> of the debate in recent weeks has focused on whether or not there</p>
<p> should be a heroin trial and in the process I think the community</p>
<p> has lost sight, or perhaps not given enough attention to the very</p>
<p> real progress that has been made at both a State and a Federal level</p>
<p> in improving the resources for education and also the plans, some</p>
<p> of which have been announced and some of which I am to announce this</p>
<p> morning for committing further resources to treatment facilities.</p>
<p>Part of the campaign, and the third and most important part of the</p>
<p> campaign as far as my announcement this morning is concerned is of</p>
<p> course the treatment of people who are addicted, not only to heroin</p>
<p> but to other substances which they are abusing. I think it's fair</p>
<p> to say that there is nothing more distressing in this whole campaign,</p>
<p> in this whole issue, for somebody in my position than to be on a radio</p>
<p> program as I have been on two occasions here in Melbourne in recent</p>
<p> weeks and to speak to the despairing mother of somebody who says that</p>
<p> she can't get her daughter or her son into a treatment program because</p>
<p> there are no places available.</p>
<p>Now whatever views people may hold about heroin trials or indeed any</p>
<p> other aspect of this whole debate, there ought to be no argument that</p>
<p> the community has an overwhelming responsibility to provide more resources</p>
<p> for those people who are trying to beat their addiction, and for those</p>
<p> people who are trying to break the habit. Surely there can be an across</p>
<p> the board, not only bipartisan but multipartisan view within the Australian</p>
<p> community, that is unarguably one of the major priorities that we</p>
<p> must address our attention to.</p>
<p>And so it has been that we have, in the 'Tough on Drugs' campaign,</p>
<p> we made ma or announcements last year which involved the provision</p>
<p> of about $50 million in our first round of grants, $50 million to</p>
<p> a variety - I'm sorry, $30 million to fund 24 communities and 68 non-government</p>
<p> organisations for innovative community education programmes and new</p>
<p> treatment services. And examples of that first round included $1.5</p>
<p> million for the Ted Noff Foundation to establish a new non-residential</p>
<p> treatment service in Sydney for 12 to 18 year-olds and $1.5 million</p>
<p> to the Salvation Army in Preston here in Victoria for a residential</p>
<p> rehabilitation facility for women and their children. And today I</p>
<p> want to announce a further round of grants totalling approximately</p>
<p> $20 million for over 50 groups Australia wide to boost treatment and</p>
<p> counselling services. And this funding will make a further contribution</p>
<p> to the cause of providing increasingly greater treatment facilities</p>
<p> for people who are trying to break their habit. And examples of the</p>
<p> projects being funded in this round include $750,000 to youth off</p>
<p> the streets in Ultimo in Sydney for an intensive two to four week</p>
<p> residential service for young adults with a history of drug abuse;</p>
<p> $375,000 to the Salvation Army in Adelaide to employ two Aboriginal</p>
<p> workers for a 25bed sobering up unit for Aboriginal people; and $474,000</p>
<p> to Anglicare in Lilydale here in Victoria for support training and</p>
<p> treatment for illicit drug users and their families.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, these announcements that I've made this morning,</p>
<p> the full details of which are contained in the media kit which is</p>
<p> being made available, represent a further down-payment, if I can put</p>
<p> it that way, on the Government's 290 million 'Tough on Drugs' strategy.</p>
<p>I don't represent to you, I don't pretend to you that by this announcement</p>
<p> we have found some new and revolutionary response to the problem.</p>
<p> It is just another contribution towards making it easier for some</p>
<p> in the community who do have a drug problem to do something about</p>
<p> it. It's a further contribution on the part of the Commonwealth to</p>
<p> encouraging the volunteer sector in the tremendous work that they</p>
<p> do in providing relief within the community.</p>
<p>I will be taking to the Premiers some further proposals in relation</p>
<p> to the nation-wide campaign against the drug problem. I do regard</p>
<p> this as a national issue. I do believe it carries national responsibilities</p>
<p> and it therefore commands the attention of the national Government.</p>
<p> But it can only be done effectively if we, all of us, we work together,</p>
<p> that if we focus on those areas of the fight against drugs where we</p>
<p> have common ground, that if we maximise our efforts in relation to</p>
<p> those areas and we continue to see it very much, as Mr Wilson said</p>
<p> in his introduction, being very much something that involves compassion,</p>
<p> compassion for the victims of drug abuse, a total intolerance and</p>
<p> a detestation of those who would profit from their misery and profit</p>
<p> from the trafficking in drugs.</p>
<p>And those two words, zero tolerance, have been much used and, perhaps,</p>
<p> over used in this debate in recent times. I want to make it clear</p>
<p> that I don't think there's anybody in the Australian community who</p>
<p> has anything other than maximum contempt and zero tolerance for those</p>
<p> in our community who would seek to make money out of human misery</p>
<p> and human suffering.</p>
<p>Like any other Federal member of Parliament or, indeed, State member</p>
<p> of Parliament who's done his or her job in recent years, I've confronted</p>
<p> the experience of discussing with parents left distraught by the loss</p>
<p> of children through the scourge of drugs. I've spent much time listening</p>
<p> to some of their harrowing stories and as a parent myself I can try</p>
<p> to understand the sense of loss and frustration and disillusionment</p>
<p> and despair and anger and all of the other human emotions that a parent</p>
<p> must go through when they experience that particular happening. I</p>
<p> can only say to them that the Government is trying. I don't pretend</p>
<p> that we've got all of the answers. I don't think anybody has the monopoly</p>
<p> of wisdom in this area. We are committing more resources. We do listen</p>
<p> to the advice of people who are affected. One of the problems is that</p>
<p> for as many parents affected in the ultimate way by this problem who</p>
<p> may, for example, support one course of action, there is just as many</p>
<p> who are violently opposed to that course of action. And the idea that</p>
<p> there is one sort of universal, coal face view about something like,</p>
<p> for example, a heroin trial or, indeed, anything else that is controversial</p>
<p> is totally mistaken. And that is part of the dilemma that this particular</p>
<p> issue throws up.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not coming here pretending that I've provided</p>
<p> or can provide all of the answers. I've come here because I'm personally</p>
<p> committed to trying to make a difference in this area. I'm personally</p>
<p> very concerned about the impact of drugs, not only on the lives who</p>
<p> are devastated by them but also the way in which it feeds into crime</p>
<p> activity, the way in which it makes our streets less safe, the way</p>
<p> in which it makes our homes more vulnerable to burglaries, the way</p>
<p> in which it makes our elderly people feel more threatened as they</p>
<p> go about doing things that for generations have been taken for granted,</p>
<p> that you can peacefully and safely do within the Australian community.</p>
<p> And every time an elderly lady's handbag is snatched in a busy suburban</p>
<p> street in Australia nine times out of ten that can be related to the</p>
<p> drug problem.</p>
<p>Now, all of these things collectively impose on all of us a huge responsibility.</p>
<p> I thank the welfare organisations for what they're doing. I want to</p>
<p> thank Major Brian Watters, the Chairman of the National Council, very</p>
<p> warmly for his compassionate interest, his great understanding of</p>
<p> this problem and his advice. I also want to thank the other members</p>
<p> of the Council, a number of whom who are here today. It's a very broadly</p>
<p> based Council. It's an organisation that represents the many points</p>
<p> of view that ought to be represented on this issue because there is</p>
<p> no one single right or correct solution but there is one single resolve,</p>
<p> I hope on the part of the Australian community, remembering difficult</p>
<p> though the problem is, that the perspective should be kept that some</p>
<p> two per cent of the Australian community have in some way been directly</p>
<p> involved in hard drugs. So we must keep a sense of perspective about</p>
<p> it whilst recognising, as Mr Wilson said in his introduction, it is</p>
<p> a long and difficult campaign ahead of us. But I'm encouraged by the</p>
<p> level of public support for doing something about it. I'm encouraged</p>
<p> by the fact that on other occasions Australia has faced enormous problems</p>
<p> of this magnitude and it's been able to effectively respond. And if</p>
<p> we continue to have the co-operation of State and Federal governments</p>
<p> of both political persuasions, indeed, of all political persuasions,</p>
<p> of the various welfare organisations that many of whom are represented</p>
<p> here today and also individuals within the community who've been affected</p>
<p> by this issue and touched by, then I think we really can make a difference.</p>
<p>'Tough on Drugs' is about trying to help the people who are addicted</p>
<p> to drugs, understanding in a compassionate way the emotional devastation</p>
<p> that that brings to their families. It's about opposing, in the most</p>
<p> unrelenting fashion, the criminal behaviour of those who seek to profit</p>
<p> from it. It's about providing decent treatment for people who want</p>
<p> treatment. It's about educating in a quite uncompromising, uncomplicated</p>
<p> way, our young against the dangers of drug taking, and that is tremendously</p>
<p> important. It's about doing all of those things. It's not about one</p>
<p> to the exclusion of the other. It's not about one in priority to the</p>
<p> other two. It's about a three-pronged approach - education, law enforcement,</p>
<p> treatment. They are the three things that we have to balance in our</p>
<p> campaign against drugs and I hope that today's announcement has made</p>
<p> an important practical contribution to realising that goal.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
