TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY, ABC WEDNESDAY, 10 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
FK: Prime Minister, politically clever, but economically thin is the comment<br />
your Budget is drawing today. What is your response to that?<br />
PM: I don't think that is true and why would it be so. We have got a Budget<br />
surplus there. It means that the public sector is not calling on savings_<br />
of Australians, therefore it is relieving the pressure on the current<br />
account deficit and the call on overseas borrowing's. That was the<br />
very point of it and next year we will have a Budget ySkrlys which will<br />
be arrived at free of any asset sales or redemptions in debt and we go<br />
on then to produce huge surpluses into the future. So, it is a massive<br />
change. This year a surplus of $ 718 million. Last year it was a deficit<br />
of $ 12.9 billion and next year that surplus will grow to $ 3.4 billion and<br />
the following year to $ 4500 million. So in other words, there will be a<br />
huge contribution from the Commonwealth Budget to the task of<br />
national savings which is taking the pressure of interest rates and<br />
lowering the prospects of our borrowing as heavily into the future on<br />
the current account deficit.<br />
FK: What about your go for growth strategy though Prime Minister. Growth<br />
is forecast to come down to 3.75 per cent. The markets think that is<br />
even a bit optimistic. It is not a fantastic rate of sustainable growth is<br />
it?<br />
PM: Well, if you go to Europe where the q~ q hate in these last few years<br />
has been half of one per cent or one, or in Japan where it is .25 of a<br />
per cent, they would be shouting yippee at n-erty 4 per cent wouldn't<br />
they? Just bear in mind we have just cleaned up nearly five per cent<br />
over the course of this year and let me just read what the Treasury say<br />
about this, he said the economy is now growing at a sustainable<br />
rate and that three and three quarters is a very sustainable number<br />
now growing at a sustainable rate and expected to remain in a growth </p>
<p>phase over the forward estimates period . That is the next three<br />
years.<br />
EIK: But, isn't the rate of that growth phase what is important. You have<br />
been talking about jobs, jobs, jobs now for the last 12 months.<br />
PM: Yes and we have had jobs, jobs, jobs.<br />
EIK: But, isn't it generally accepted that growth needs to be up around four<br />
per cent before unemployment comes down?<br />
PM: But it is, it is three and three quarters. We have had three and a half<br />
years of growth and what the Treasury is telling us, we are having<br />
another three years of growth. That is six and a half years of growth<br />
and that, of course, gives the lie to that opportunist line of Mr Howard's<br />
about five minutes of sunshine. I mean, we are going to have six<br />
years of sunshine. We have had three and a half years of it already,<br />
three and three quarter per cent coming up in this year and as the<br />
Treasury say over the forward estimates period, that is three years,<br />
sustainable rates of growth with low inflation. Now, that is what the<br />
very essence of the Budget was about. It was about sustaining this<br />
recovery into the balance of the 1 990s. Having it sustainable,<br />
affordable, taking the pressure of the current account deficit, taking the<br />
pressure of wages and inflation and giving us a sustainable rate. Now,<br />
the economy has picked up from when the Government introduced it's<br />
policies in 1992 and it has grown ever since and last year we had the<br />
largest fall in unemployment in our history.<br />
FIK: Yes, but this year the fall that you are forecasting is only .7 per cent<br />
down to eight per cent. Is that good enough?<br />
PM: Fran, the election was on in 1993. It is just two years ago.<br />
Unemployment was over 10 per cent 10.5 per cent it is an amazing<br />
fall in unemployment to be talking about eight per cent.<br />
FK: That's right, but<br />
PM: An absolutely amazing fall.<br />
FIK: But now you are talking about falling only from 8.7 per cent to 8 per<br />
cent in one year. Is that good enough?<br />
PM: Absolutely because it is sustainable. It is sustainable. The point the<br />
Treasurer and I have been making since late last year when the<br />
September quarter accounts came out showing the economy growing<br />
at 6.5 per cent for the year, that 6.5 per cent was unsustainable. That<br />
is why the Government introduced those three monetary adjustments<br />
quickly into the latter part of last year which has had the desired effect<br />
of slowing the economy down. And now we have not only got the<br />
economy slowing, we have taken all the pressure off interest rates that </p>
<p>come from the public sector and deficits by getting the Budget back<br />
into surplus.<br />
FK: So, you think it is good enough to go to an election with an<br />
unemployment rate of around eight per cent. In fact, you think it is so<br />
good that you are able to cut programs for the unemployed?<br />
PM: Fran, let me make this point. Last year, that is the last financial year<br />
the one we are in, is the biggest fall in unemployment since we have<br />
been keeping the statistics, since we have been keeping the series. I<br />
mean, what more can I say.<br />
FK: Yes, but why not keep that rate going?<br />
PM: Because you can't keep rates of unemployment dropping at that pace<br />
with employment growth at that pace unless you are growing at around<br />
five or six per cent which is not sustainable on inflation or wages.<br />
When we introduced Working Nation last year, it's aim was to get to an<br />
unemployment rate of five per cent by the year 2000. We have gone<br />
from 10.5 per cent now towards eight per cent and we are on our way<br />
to five per cent. Now, we have just seen the French elections, you<br />
followed some of that debate?<br />
FK: Yes.<br />
PM: There is 30 per cent youth unemployment in France. I mean, there is<br />
huge long term unemployment in those societies and the reason is<br />
because they have got one and two per cent national growth rates.<br />
We have been growing here around four to five per cent and what<br />
these estimates are telling you is that we are going to have another<br />
year of three and three quarter per cent growth.<br />
FK: Well Prime Minister, predictably the Opposition doesn't think much of<br />
your Budget. John Howard says it is a pick-pocket budget because<br />
you are snatct iig he siij you are snatching things away from<br />
people that were promised like the L. A. W. law tax cuts. Don't you feel<br />
bad letting people down on that promise?<br />
PM: What are you talking about? We have already delivered the first half<br />
of the tax cuts.<br />
FK: There is a second half to come, people are not going to get it.<br />
PM: $ 20 a week. They were paid at the end of 1993. The second half we<br />
are paying into superannuation accounts. This is the first time the<br />
nation has had a comprehensive private savings plan. The first time<br />
ever and it could only come from a Labor government and it will come<br />
now by building on the nine percentage points we have under the<br />
superannuation guarantee charge, by three percentage points of<br />
wages coming from the employee and three percentage points coming </p>
<p>from the One Nation tax cuts paid into their superannuation account.<br />
So, every person in the country will have a 15 per cent superannuation<br />
income over the long run. In other words, so if you say to people ' what<br />
is more useful, a hand full of cash now which will disappear or<br />
something that goes in forever?' Let me just give you some figures<br />
Fran, because I think it is important that you know this and this is from<br />
the Treasury paper ' Saving forOur Future', someone on 100 per cent<br />
of average weekly ov~ Fiiiea rniings, if th-ey join the labour market and<br />
were in it for 40 years would, in today's dollars, pick up $ 461,000.<br />
This is someone on average weekly earnings, $ 461,000 or if we<br />
express it as annual annuity $ 30,500 a year. Let's take someone on<br />
one-and-a-half times average weekly earnings, this is someone on<br />
about $ 40,000 a year. They would have an accumulation of $ 674,000,<br />
these are people that had nothing to look forward to in the past but the<br />
pension.<br />
FK: That's true, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: What do you mean it's true? It is fantastic. What do you mean it is<br />
true?<br />
EK: Well, it may be fantastic, but isn't there also an element in there for<br />
people who are expecting something that you promised them which<br />
was a tax cut that would mean more disposable income for them now<br />
and you are asking them to trade it off for something in the future.<br />
That is a change in the promise isn't it?<br />
PM: Fran, do your street corner poll and say what would you prefer?<br />
$ 460,000 at the end of your working life or an annual annuity of<br />
$ 30,000 a year or $ 10 or $ 15 in your hand now? I know what they<br />
would say to you and let me just say this about the Opposition Fran.<br />
They were like stung mullets last night. Poor old John Howard, he had<br />
the giggles, he had a sort of plastic smile glued onto his face. They<br />
must have picked up and read the first five lines of the Budget speech<br />
and nearly died. Because what could they say? Here is the Budget<br />
back in surplus. The second line in Mr Willisseech was surplus next<br />
year without asset sales and then those huge surpluses going on to<br />
the future, $ 3.4 billion, $ 4.5 billion and in 1998 $ 7 billion. And on top<br />
of that the biggest, most comprehensive savings change in our history.<br />
FK: But to be fair Prime Minister, the Opposition are not the only ones with<br />
some criticisms of this Budget. There was concern last night from the<br />
Democrats, the unions and others that, for instance, the massive boost<br />
to superannuation funds that will come from this superannuation<br />
strategy of yours with no guarantee that those funds will be used<br />
productively and responsibly to invest here in Australia. What will you<br />
do about that?<br />
PM: I think we are going to build now a massive look, these figures, I<br />
think, are worth going through too, this is the size of the savings and I </p>
<p>think there is a genuine issue about how this money is spent and how<br />
the superannuation industry manage it.<br />
EK: And you develop a strategy for that?<br />
PM: Let me just go through the numbers. In 1983 we had $ 40 billion in<br />
superannuation funds. At the last count we had $ 186 billion. Now<br />
remember this, the national debt is $ 160 billion. We have got, already,<br />
$ 186 billion at the latest count. By the year 2020 on the Treasury<br />
estimates, we will have $ 2000 billion. It was on the front page of the<br />
Financial Review today $ 2tr. That is the first time I have ever seen in<br />
an Australian newspaper the expression ' 2tr' that means $ 2 trillion.<br />
FIK: But how are you going to make sure..<br />
PM: $ 2000 billion and our national debt is $ 160..<br />
EK: But how will you make sure all that money, all those riches are used<br />
productively here in Australia?<br />
PM: Fran, let me just make this point. Could you imagine the Liberal party<br />
thinking of a thing like this. Could you imagine them having the wit<br />
pack in 1985/ 6 to start off on superannuation to build it up to three per<br />
cent then to five per cent then to six per cent then to nine per cent and<br />
then to add this six per cent last night, three from the employees and<br />
three from the Government via the tax cuts. Could you imagine that<br />
bunch having the wit, the imagination, the courage, the sense, the<br />
conscientious to build a thing like this?<br />
FK: Well Prime Minister, if we can turn to the Budget more generally. A lot<br />
of the bottom line you have achieved is reached by asset sales, in<br />
particular selling of the peoples bank, the Commonwealth Bank, that<br />
was last minute decision..<br />
PM: We are into hyper-bole this morning aren't we. The hyperboles are<br />
rolling. The peoples bank!<br />
FIK: That was a last minute decision, I understand. Why did you make that<br />
decision at the last moment?<br />
PM: I didn't. I saw the Managing Director and the Chairman of the<br />
Commonwealth Bank over Christmas and I had discussions with them<br />
and I had discussions at the same time with the Treasurer, we had<br />
discussions perpetually over the period and also with Kim Beazley, the<br />
Minister for Finance, and we decided having sold 49 per cent -of the<br />
Commonwealth Bank that particularly when it picked up the State<br />
Savings Bank of Victoria for the first time we have created a irnational<br />
institution. The Commonwealth Bank was formerly the old<br />
State Savings Bank of NSW which went down in the Depression. It<br />
was always flying on one wing the Commonwealth Bank. We gave it </p>
<p>two wings when it picked up the State Savings Bank of Victoria. We<br />
built a national institution then. At that time when I was Treasurer, we<br />
sold half of it off or a quarter of it off and we sold the balance a year or<br />
so ago. There is now a chance, a very good opportunity of making this<br />
a full commercial bank which is what it is. So, there is no policy<br />
reason why it should remain a publicly owned institution and every<br />
good financial policy reason in building another firm, strong financial<br />
institution out there. So, we have decided to sell the other half of it in<br />
two tranches over a couple of years. The reason it didn't go through<br />
the Cabinet because we were speaking until late in the piece, is<br />
because we were speaking to the bank's management and its board<br />
and once the board make a decision they are bound to notify the stock<br />
market and they made a decision yesterday and I think you will find<br />
they have notified the stock market today.<br />
FK: Prime Minister, the markets haven't reacted very favourably to this<br />
Budget, one of their concerns is that the current account deficit<br />
remains high in your Budget, it remains at $ 27 billion. You have<br />
identified the current account as the number one economic problem for<br />
Australia, yet you leave it at that level, does that mean that this Budget<br />
is not achieving what it is meant to?<br />
PM: What the Treasury say in their commentary statement too, they say in<br />
the 1970s the current account was running at about 2.5 per cent of<br />
GOP. Since then, on average it is running at about 4.5 per cent. In<br />
other words we have a problem of two percentage points of GOP in<br />
size. In the Budget, we have changed the Budget balance in the next<br />
year or so by two percentage points of gpeQ. We have gone from 2.8<br />
per cent of GOP to a surplus of $ 700 million on this occasion. The<br />
change in the Budget balance will be about two percentage points of<br />
GOP. So, if you just leave superannuation to one side we already<br />
have as a consequence of last night's Budget a change to the public<br />
sector coming through in the next couple of years of around two<br />
percentage of GOP, the size of the problem. Mr Willis and I always<br />
talked about this being a medium term problem and it is a medium term<br />
problem. Can I just say, those savings that I have just read out to you,<br />
$ 186 bullion and can I say from the superannuation paper what the<br />
Treasury say is that the addition to savings by the year 2000 coming<br />
from superannuation will be two percentage points of GOP and by<br />
2020, four percentage points of GOP. So, if we have got a two<br />
percentage point problem on the current account how have we got it<br />
covered? We have got two percentage points coming through on the<br />
Budget and we have got two percentage points coming through on<br />
superannuation.<br />
FK: Prime Minister, just finally this will be the last Budget before an<br />
election. If interest rates stay down, as you are confident they will, will<br />
you consider..<br />
I </p>
<p>PM: I think this goes a long way to keeping the pressure off interest rates,<br />
that is the very big shift in the Budget balance. Remember there is a<br />
discretionary tightening in here of increases in revenue and cuts to<br />
government spending of $ 3000 million in this Budget last night. That<br />
will rise to $ 4500 million next year, free of any asset sales or anything<br />
else.<br />
FK: So, rates will stay down?<br />
PM: I think with the economy at three and three quarter per cent and<br />
inflation where we have it, I think, the prospects of rates staying down<br />
are very strong indeed.<br />
FK: Will you then consider going to an election before the end of the year?<br />
PM: I keep getting asked that, but I always like squeezing the value out of<br />
these election wins. They are too hard to win without giving half of it<br />
away. John Hewson said I was going to have an early election when<br />
he was leader then Alexander Downer said it and then John Howard<br />
thinks it, everytime he thinks it, of course, he goes white. But the fact<br />
is, no we will have an election in the cycle, in the proper time in the<br />
cycle, but can I say Fran<br />
FK: Is that a no though to the end of the year?<br />
PM: Only the most silliest of Prime Minister's would ever paint themselves<br />
into a corner when they don't have to and I'm not that silly. Can I just<br />
make this point to you, much of the commentary says some of it talks<br />
about election budgets and the rest, this is a Budget designed to deal<br />
with the sustenance, the sustaining of economic growth in Australia<br />
which it does and to relieve the pressure 6nt-fie-current account. It is<br />
a very serious Budget indeed. But the fact that it is such a good<br />
Budget, let me say, I am going to accept the complement. If the leader<br />
writers think it is good enough for an election all I say to them is thank<br />
you.<br />
FK: Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you indeed.<br />
ends </p>
