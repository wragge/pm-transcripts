    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was extremely sorry to learn of the death of my former Ministerial</p>
<p> colleague and Fraser Government Minister, The Hon Kevin Newman AO.</p>
<p>Kevin Newman gave years of service to Australia, initially as a soldier,</p>
<p> rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and serving both in Malaysia</p>
<p> and Vietnam.</p>
<p>He subsequently entered politics. His extraordinary victory in the</p>
<p> Bass by-election in 1975 is widely recognised to have signalled the</p>
<p> beginning of the end for the Whitlam government.</p>
<p>He became a Minister in the Fraser Government in December 1975, serving</p>
<p> in the portfolios of Repatriation, Environment Housing and Community</p>
<p> Development, National Development, Productivity, and Administrative</p>
<p> Services. Kevin Newman was the Minister responsible for the environment</p>
<p> when the decision was taken to prohibit sand mining on Fraser Island</p>
<p>He retired from Parliament in 1984. After his retirement, he continued</p>
<p> to pursue public service and was appointed President of the National</p>
<p> Trust (Tasmania), Chairman of the National Council of NationalTrusts,</p>
<p> member of the Board of the Menzies Foundation and a director of The</p>
<p> Stockman's Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>In December 1997 he was appointed Chairman of the Old Parliament House</p>
<p> Governing Council, a position he held until his death.</p>
<p>Kevin was extremely well liked and respected by all of his colleagues.</p>
<p> He showed great devotion to Australia and to the Liberal Party. He</p>
<p> also fought strongly for the legitimate interests of Tasmania.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and the Liberal Party, I extend my deep</p>
<p> sympathy to Kevin Newman's widow, Senator the Hon Jocelyn Newman Minister</p>
<p> for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime</p>
<p> Minister for the Status of Women, their children, Kate and Campbell</p>
<p> and their grandchildren.</p>
<p>A state funeral for the late Hon Kevin Newman will be held on Thursday,</p>
<p> 22 July at 11.30 am in the Chapel of the Royal Military College, Duntroon.</p>
