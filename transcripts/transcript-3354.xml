PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 301<br />
August 1974<br />
PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT FOR AUSTRALIAN AUTHORS AND<br />
PUBLI SHERS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced the<br />
appointment of the Australian Authors' Fund Committee which will<br />
implement the Public Lending Right for Australian authors and<br />
publishers. Mr. Whitlam said that the appointment of the Committee<br />
followed the acceptance by the Government in principle of the<br />
report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Lending Rights<br />
established by the Literature Board of the Australian Council for<br />
the Arts. The Public Lending Right was a long overdue recognition<br />
of the service rendered to the community by authors and publishers.<br />
The Scandinavian countries had pioneered the public lending right<br />
and Australia and New Zealand were the first two English-speaking<br />
countries to implement it.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the Public Lending Right was an<br />
important part of the Government's program of assistance to the<br />
arts. It would provide a valuable income supplement for writers,<br />
many of whose incomes were subject to extreme fluctuations, and<br />
an encouragement to publishers.<br />
The Chairman of the A. A. F. Committee will be Richard Hall,<br />
a member of the Literature Board, who had served on the Committee<br />
of Inquiry. Mr. Hall is an adviser to the Minister for Manufacturing<br />
Industry, Mr. Enderby. The position is part-time. / 2 </p>

Mr. Colin Simpson<br />
Mr. Frank Thompson<br />
Mr. Barrett Reid Novelist, of Beechworth, Victoria.<br />
Nominee of the Literature Board.<br />
Author, of Gordon, New South Wales.<br />
Representing the interests of<br />

Manager of Queensland University<br />
Press, Brisbane, Qld.<br />
Representing the interests of<br />
publishers.<br />
State Library of Victoria, of St.<br />
Andrews, Victoria.<br />
Representing the interests of<br />
librarians.<br />
Representatives from the Attorney-General's Department and<br />
Treasury will be appointed to the Committee.<br />
Funds have been appropriated to provide for retrospective<br />
payments from 1 April this year. For the first 15 months<br />
of the scheme payments would be made on the basis of a pilot<br />
sample of municipal and subscription libraries throughout<br />
Australia. Mr. Whitlam said he wished to pay particular tribute to the<br />
work of Professor Geoffrey Blainey who had chaired the<br />
Committee of Inquiry.<br />
