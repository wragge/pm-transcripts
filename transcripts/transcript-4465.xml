PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 14 AUGUST 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Relations between Australia and our South East Asian and Pacific<br />
neighbours are continuing to grow in strength and quality. We<br />
have common interests and common goals. In particular, we have<br />
a common desire for economic and social stability and enduring<br />
peace. The real worth of this relationship one that has developed<br />
over the last three decades was demonstrated in Kuala.* Lumpur<br />
last week. The Heads of Government of Japan, New Zealand and<br />
Australia met with the leaders of the five ASEAN nations Malaysia,<br />
Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines. It was an<br />
occasion of international significance. It was the first ever<br />
meeting of its kind. The historic meeting achieved much. Common<br />
problems were reviewed in a spirit of goodwill and understanding.<br />
Problems were not brushed out of sight, but discussed frankly.<br />
The whole tone of discussion was one of mutual concern and understanding,<br />
and a desire to find reasonable solutions to problems<br />
in a reasoned way. There was a sincere wish to work together<br />
for the development of the region.<br />
The meeting was particularly important for Australia. It provided<br />
the right opportunity to demonstrate our condinuing commitment and<br />
involvement in the affairs of this region. At the same time, it<br />
gave ASEAN leaders a chance to hear at first hand Australia's<br />
policies during our economic recovery.<br />
Australia's commitment to ASEAN itself and to individual ASEAN<br />
countries has never been stronger. Our commitment is on-going<br />
and a basic part of the Government's foreign policy.<br />
I believe we made this commitment clear to the Heads of Government<br />
of ASEAN, through a number of significant initiatives that will<br />
bring short and long-term benefits to every country within ASEAN.<br />
I will briefly outline our key initiatives.<br />
We decided to provide an additional $ 10 million to finance<br />
development projects under the ASEAN-Australia Economic Co-operation<br />
Programmes ( the original pledge of $ 5 million has now been fully<br />
committed). We increased the level of aid to ASEAN member countries<br />
by $ 90 million to $ 250 million. / The </p>
<p>-2<br />
The Government shortly will discuss with each member country<br />
details of the particular project they wish to develop. This<br />
money will provide a great opportunity for economic and industrial<br />
activity within each country. While the money itself is important<br />
for each country, the way in which it is being made available is,<br />
I believe, just as important. The money is being made available<br />
as a committed sum which, of course, allows the countries to<br />
undertake long-term planning. We have also decided to give more<br />
of this grant aid in an untied form. This means that each country<br />
will be able to make greater use of local materials and equipment.<br />
It will certainly assist development of local industry.<br />
ASEAN countries were, of course, keen to increase their share of<br />
trade with us. We proposed that ASEAN conduct an annual trade<br />
fair in Australia to assist in the promotion and marketing of their<br />
goods and services. I explained that there were opportunities<br />
particularly in clothing and textiles to capture a greater share<br />
of our import market. As it stands now, ASEAN countries competing<br />
against Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China have only 10% of that<br />
trade. In the three years up to and including 1975-76, ASEAN<br />
countries had gained a total of $ 60.2 million of our import market<br />
in clothing and textiles. This compares with a total figure of<br />
$ 649 million for the other four countries. This trade fair would<br />
help ASEAN compete with the other countries in the region for a<br />
greater share of the market in these and other areas.<br />
Australia also agreed to sponsor an ASEAN/ Australia Investment<br />
Seminar and to meet the cost of a joint ASEAN/ Australia Research<br />
Project. one of the most significant initiatives to come from the meeting<br />
was our proposal that a consultative mechanism should be set up<br />
as an ' early warning' signal on trade and other problems. The<br />
Foreign Minister, Mr. Peacock, and the Foreign Ministers from the<br />
five ASEAN nations, will put up detailed proposals as to how this<br />
consultation process will work in practice, at the earliest<br />
opportunity. This initiative which will provide substantial<br />
opportunities for consultation both to Australia and to the five<br />
ASEAN nations was warmly accepted and welcomed by ASEAN leaders<br />
and officials. The meeting with ASEAN leaders also cleared the<br />
air in relation to Australian exports there. As a result of a<br />
direct request from me, the Malaysian Trade Minister, in the<br />
presence of the Malaysian Prime Minister, told me that special<br />
discriminatory measures against Australia had been lifted. This<br />
is good news for Australian exporters.<br />
The discus-sions we held with other leaders and Japan in particular<br />
on a ntumber of important issues, will also lead to continuing and<br />
mutually rewarding relationships between our countries. Much of<br />
the discussion with Japan's Prime Minister concerned the questions<br />
of beef. I made it clear that the present arrangements of negotiating<br />
beef quotas every six months hindered the beef industry's<br />
ability to operate properly as it is an industry which has to<br />
plan on a long-term basis. / I </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I suggested that our officials should work together to devise<br />
a system which would better serve the needs of stability. The<br />
Japanese Prime Minister agreed, and we shall shortly be sending<br />
a team of officials to Japan who will be arguing for stability<br />
of access.<br />
Overall, the historic eight-nation meeting has cemented the<br />
common bonds that exist between us. It has paved the way for<br />
a continued strengthening of our relationship on all levels, and<br />
it has certainly provided a renewal of confidence in the ability<br />
of the region to progress and develop. </p>
