COMMITTEE ON OFFICIAL ESTABLISHMENTS<br />
An independent Committee on Official Establishments has<br />

operation, conservation'and longer term improvement of<br />
the four official residences of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
These official establishments are Government House, The Lodge,<br />
Kirribilli House and Admiralty House.<br />
Kirribilli House is used chiefly for distinguished guests<br />
from overseas. Admiralty House has been the Sydney home<br />
of the Governor General for a long time.<br />
The Ccwnittee will advise on the proper conservation of the<br />
four es: ablisments economically and in a fashion that<br />
enhances history of early Australia.<br />
They are : art of the National. Estate and it is essential that<br />
they be conserved in a way that ensures and enhances their<br />
aesthetic and historic significance. Redecoration should not<br />
be at the whim of the occupants of the day.<br />
The Chairman of the Committee on Official Establishments<br />
will be Mr Andrew Grimwade, President, Council of Trustees,<br />
National Gallery of Victoria. Other members of Mr Guilford<br />
Bell, Dame Helen Blaxland, Mr James Cope ( former Speaker of<br />
the House of Representatives) and Mrs Ruth Gullett.<br />
The Coamittee will be serviced by the Department of the<br />
Prime Minister and Cabinet.<br />
From time to time objects come on the market which would be<br />
suitable f: r one or other of these four official residences,<br />
and zwhis-o uld be preserved in the national interest.<br />
The Cc-ittee will have the task of advising the Government<br />
on the purchase of such objects.<br />
The official United States guest house, Blair House, in Washington,<br />
is managed by a committee which operates in this way. As a<br />
result, not only Blair Hlouse, but the furnishings in it,<br />
are of great historical value. 00OoooOOO </p>
