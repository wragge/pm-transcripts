PRIME MINISTER<br />
For Press 20 JULY 1978<br />
PROGRAMME FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE<br />
UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
The World Community is this year comnmemoratin~ g the<br />
Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br />
The Prime Minister said today that as a consequence of a decision<br />
by the Government earlier in the year he was now approaching<br />
State Premiers to seek their participation in a programme<br />
of domestic activities to mark the anniversary.<br />
Mr Fraser observed that this anniversary comes at a time when<br />
there is growing international recognition of the importance of<br />
fundamental human rights. The world-wide outcry in recent days<br />
against the trials of Soviet dissidents, and the harsh sentences<br />
imposed on them, is a clear demonstration of this and serves<br />
to bring home the importance of doing all we can to promote<br />
understanding of, and adherence to, the principles expressed<br />
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br />
We in Australia, he said, have a record on human rights we can<br />
be justly proud of and over the years successive Australian<br />
Governments have actively contributed to the work of the United<br />
Nations in the promotion and protection of internationally<br />
recognised human rights. Australia commenced a three year term<br />
on the UN Commission on Human Rights at the beginning of this year.<br />
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has become a<br />
most highly regarded document and the Prime Minister said he<br />
believed that governments have a role to play in promoting<br />
public awareness of its universal significance. It is the<br />
Government's intention to demonstrate, by means of a domestic<br />
programme, that Australia reaffirms its commitment to the human<br />
rights standards that the international community has aspired<br />
to uphold for the past thirty years.<br />
Accordingly, the Commonwealth is embarking on a programme designed<br />
to make available to the community at large, information on the<br />
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its significance to<br />
Australia. Discussion kits are being prepared for school children and ethnic<br />
and Aboriginal organisations throughout Australia. The kits<br />
will include a copy of the Declaration; as well translations<br />
of the Declaration in over fifty languages spoken by ethnic<br />
communities in Australia are to be made available. </p>
<p>The explanatory material in the discussion kit will focus<br />
on the Declaration as a document which reflects the<br />
international community's aspirations.<br />
The Prime Minister said that an explanation of Australia's<br />
Racial Discrimination Act is to be translated into the<br />
languages of Australia's migrant communities. An explanation<br />
is also to be translated into the main Aboriginal dialects<br />
spoken in the Northern Territory, and distributed<br />
Australia-wide on cassettes for Aboriginal communities where<br />
these languages are in use. It is also proposed to circulate<br />
an explanation of the Racial Discrimination Act in similar<br />
form in English, both in conjunction with, and independently<br />
of the cassettes.<br />
Mr Fraser commented that he was writing to the State Premiers<br />
seeking their participation in aspects of the programme of<br />
relevance to them. </p>
