1AUSTAIA,<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 21 NOVEMBER, 1980<br />
DEATH OF SIR JOHN McEWEN<br />
Sir John McEwen was a very great Australian.<br />
He served this country in many different capacities in the<br />
Federal Parliament for more than 36 years'.-a very large part<br />
of his working life.<br />
Sir John was elected to the House of Representatives in 1934.<br />
Three years later he was appointed to his first Ministerial<br />
post, Minister for the Interior.<br />
In the early days of World War 2, he was Minister for Exter nal.<br />
Affairs. Sir John was appointed Minister for Air and Minister<br />
for Civil Aviation in 1940, and held these portfolios for a<br />
year until the defeat in Parliament of the Fadden Ministry.<br />
On the election of the first post-war Menzies Ministry in 1949,<br />
he became Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, a portfolio lie<br />
held until 1956, when it was renamed Trade.<br />
He held the portfolio of Minister for Trade from 1956 to<br />
1963, and Trade and Industry from then until his resignation<br />
from Parliament in 1971.<br />
Sir John always regarded one of his more significant achievements<br />
as denying some of the Pacific islands to the axis powers as<br />
Foreign Minister in the early days of the War.<br />
These are events beyond the memory of a large number of<br />
Australians, but they show the breadth of time over which<br />
John McEwen served Australia in many different capacities.<br />
Sir John is best remembered as Leader of the Country Party, as<br />
Deputy Prime Minister to Sir Robert Menzies and then to later<br />
Liberal leaders. In that capacity, he served Australia very<br />
well, and very truly.<br />
one of the precious memories I have of being in Federal Parliament,<br />
was being able to learn by watching and listening to John McEwen.<br />
It was a privilege to serve with him. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
His death will be very much noticed throughout Australia.<br />
I hope at this time that all Australians will just pause<br />
to think for a moment of the very great service that he gave<br />
for this country not just for his Party, but for the<br />
whole nation.<br />
He was one of those politicians who had the capacity to put<br />
the national interest first, and as I believe, he always did.<br />
I regarded John McEwen as a very close personal friend.<br />
I want and am very sure many others would want me, on<br />
their behalf to convey my sincere condolences and sympathies<br />
to Lady McEwen. 000---</p>
