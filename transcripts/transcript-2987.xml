FRENCH NUCTLEAR TESTS<br />
In a statement today, the Prime Minister said:<br />
0 " The Government has reason to believe that<br />
the Government of France has exploded today another<br />
nuclear device in the Pacific.<br />
The previous French tests have attracted<br />
world-wide opposition. I am sure that this latest<br />
test will be equally condemned. The Australian<br />
SGovernment will take all appropriate steps to bring<br />
to a halt these dangerous experiments, which are<br />
carried out in defiance of law and morality." </p>
