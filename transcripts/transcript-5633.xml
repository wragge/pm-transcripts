PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT TUESDAY, 11 AUGUST, 1981<br />
DOORSTOP: PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA ( WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES<br />
REPORT) Question report by the World Council of Churches on Aborigines.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I think only to support really-what Senator Baume.. said'on<br />
ABC this morning. I have not read or studied the report yet.<br />
Obviously the Government will be, but I think from the public<br />
reports that have come out the report misses the fact that<br />
Aboriginal people are not only entitled to all the programmes<br />
available to all other Australians, that Governments are in fact<br />
operating many programmes specifically designed to help<br />
Aboriginal people. we have set in place programmes of Aboriginal<br />
self-management. The Development Fund which Charles Perkins heads<br />
is an innovation which was hailed by the Aboriginal people as<br />
a great advance, giving them control over many facets of their<br />
own operations. In addition to this, the idea of self-management<br />
rather than of State paternalism is one which I think is very<br />
important in Australia.-and one which, as I understand it, is<br />
supported by Aboriginal people. So, whether these matters are<br />
covered in the report or not I do not know, but the press reports<br />
so far of the report seem to pay no attention to the very<br />
extensive efforts by Governments to improve the circumstances of<br />
the Aboriginal people. I have said publicly in other places thj-at<br />
Australia was late in the day in starting. I think Paul Hasluck<br />
wari the first Minister who really began to introduce programmeS<br />
that would improve the well-being of Aboriginal people. We could<br />
well have argued we should have started 50 or 60 or 70 years ago,<br />
instead of 20 or 30 years ago. But very significant strides. have<br />
in fact been made over recent times.<br />
Question In light of what you say are omissions in the report, do you th~ ink<br />
your Government could be embarrassed.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I am saying I have not studied the report, so I do not know whether<br />
these matters which. I.-have mentioned are in fact covered in the<br />
report or not.<br />
Question Well that aside, do you think your Government could be embarrassed<br />
by circulation of the report at the Commornwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting? </p>
<p>I a -2-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I do not. I do not really because I think many people who<br />
are coming to that meeting understand and know the policies<br />
that are being pursued by this particular Government. The<br />
problems are by no means unique to Australia. They are shared in<br />
a number of countries in a number of places. It needs to be<br />
understood that programmes of health, . programmes of education,<br />
programmes in housing designed specifically to support the<br />
Aboriginal people are very real ones. They are not the paternalistic<br />
State-managed programmes of older days saying. " this is what is<br />
good for you". They are programmes that seek to involve Aboriginal<br />
people in their own self-management and self-determination within<br />
Australian society. All of that is good in Australian policy.<br />
Nobody can pretend and nobody suggests that some of the very real<br />
difficulties in this area can be resolved in a day or a week. It is<br />
going to take time. I have said on a number of occasions over -recent<br />
years. that Australia was late in the day in starting but over the<br />
last 20 years in particular very great progress has been made and<br />
we are doing what we can to make up for lost time.<br />
