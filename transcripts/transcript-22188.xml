    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since the devastation caused by Tropical Cyclone Larry, the Australian Government has worked with the Queensland Government, local governments, community groups and emergency service organisations to help the people of north Queensland affected by the cyclone.</p>
<p>Over $100 million of financial assistance is being provided by the Australian Government, including ex-gratia payments for eligible adults and children to meet emergency needs and for affected farmers and small businesses.  Much of this funding is being delivered through Centrelink (Hotline number 1802 002).</p>
<p>After witnessing the devastation first hand, I promised that the Australian Government would continue to monitor the situation and do what we could for the communities affected by Tropical Cyclone Larry.</p>
<p>An important part of rebuilding the cyclone damaged communities is to help businesses and farmers get back on their feet as quickly as possible.  In the absence of normal electricity services, many businesses have been using diesel or petrol-powered generators to keep their businesses viable.</p>
<p>In addition to the assistance already committed, I announce today a one-off measure, in view of the particular circumstances of the cyclone, that the Australian Government will reimburse any excise paid on diesel or petrol fuel used by businesses, including farmers, and households that are generating their own electricity until normal services are restored.</p>
<p>Centrelink will provide details of how to claim reimbursement under this arrangement shortly.  In the meantime I encourage those businesses and homes using fuel for power generation to keep their receipts so that they can be reimbursed.</p>
<p>The Australian Government recognises how important it is to get assistance to  the communities affected by Tropical Cyclone Larry as quickly as possible.  On 24 March the Australian Government processed an advance of $40 million to Queensland under the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements to help relieve personal hardship and assist urgent efforts to rebuild public infrastructure.</p>
<p>I am pleased that community assistance is being effectively rolled out with 100 staff deployed to support Far North Queensland.  One stop shops to provide advice on financial assistance are operating in Innisfail, Babinda, Atherton Tablelands, Edmonton, Mobile Cairns Outreach, Tully, Mt Garnet and now south Mission Beach.  I welcome the advice that banks are arranging for money to be more readily available in the affected areas and that some have been providing services over the weekend.</p>
<p>I welcome the appointment of General Peter Cosgrove (Retired) to coordinate the cyclone relief effort and yesterday spoke to Sandy Hollway who will work closely with Peter.  I applaud the team work among federal, state and local governments, Australian Emergency Services, community organisations, state police and the 400 strong Australian Defence Force personnel, that underpins this major community relief effort.  </p>
