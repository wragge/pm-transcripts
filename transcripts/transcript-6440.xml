FOR MEDIA 10 AUGUST 1984<br />
The signing this evening of an agreement between CRA and<br />
China represents a major step in the development of<br />
co-operation between the iron and steel industries of China<br />
and Australia. The agreement provides for the CRA group and<br />
China to enter into a feasibility study for a joint venture<br />
for the development of an iron ore mine in Western<br />
Australia. If a new mine is developed at the Channar<br />
deposit in the near future, as seems likely, it will<br />
represent the first new iron mine development in Australia<br />
since the initial decade of export-oriented expansion which<br />
ended in the early nineteen seventies.<br />
Through this venture it is hoped that exports of from 5 to<br />
million tonnes per annum in addition to exports under<br />
on-going arrangements can be realised. The proposed Joint<br />
Venture would mean more jobs for Australians and increased<br />
export and national income for Australia. It would assist<br />
our construction and heavy engineering industries.<br />
The CRA-China agreement follows by only a few hours the<br />
conclusion by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for<br />
Trade, Mr Lionel Bowen, of an agreement on Economic and<br />
Technical Co-operation between the iron and steel industries<br />
of Australia and China. The conclusion of such an agreement<br />
with China is unique; and is a concrete demonstration of the<br />
desire which exists on both sides to see further integration<br />
of the Australian and China iron and steel industries to the<br />
mutual advantage of both countries.<br />
The Channar iron ore mine feasibility study and the<br />
technical co-operation agreement are direct results of<br />
discussions between Premier Zhao and myself in Canberra last<br />
year and in Beijing this year, culminating in the<br />
establishment of the Australia-China Iron and Steel Industry<br />
Joint Study Group. </p>
<p>There has been rapid progress since February on all aspects<br />
of' Premier Zhao and my agreement last February to promote<br />
co-operation between our two countries' iron and steel<br />
industries trade in steel-making raw materials; joint<br />
ventures in each other's iron ore mining and iron and steel<br />
processing industries; joint trade in processed iron and<br />
steel; and mutual technical assistance.<br />
Iron and steel co-operation has been advanced through<br />
intensive high-level exchanges between Australia and China.<br />
In recent months the Chinese Minister for Metallurgical<br />
Industry has concluded an extensive visit to Australia,<br />
Lionel Bowen has visited China and presently China's Vice<br />
Minister for Metallurgical Industry, Mr Lin Hua, is<br />
undertaking an extensive visit to Australia. Mr Lin will be<br />
holding discussions on a range of issues including the<br />
re-opening of the Kwinana blast furnace and Koolyanobbing<br />
iron ore mine, the future development of technological<br />
co-operation between our industries, and iron and steel<br />
industry joint ventures in China.<br />
There have also been intensive high-level exchanges<br />
involving the private sector, including visits by CRA and<br />
BHP delegations led by their respective chief executives,<br />
Sir Roderick Carnegie and Mr Brian Loton.<br />
Just one week ago a Technical Assessment Mission returned<br />
from an extensive inspection of the iron and steel industry<br />
of China. The Mission included senior representatives from<br />
BHIP, CRA and CSR. I am advised that the Mission has<br />
identified significant prospects for increased trade and<br />
technological co-operation between Australia and China which<br />
should provide a welcome stimulus to Australia's iron and<br />
steel industry.<br />
At the same time they will assist China to meet the huge<br />
increase in demand for iron and steel which will be<br />
associated with the success of its modernisation plans<br />
between now and the end of the century.<br />
While this Mission was in China, a number of other private<br />
sector missions were discussing specific commercial<br />
prospects for increased trade with China. These missions<br />
covered a broad range of prospects from the supply of iron<br />
ore and manganese to the Chinese steel industry, to the<br />
supply of equipment and technology in galvanising and<br />
finishing steel industry.<br />
Already since February we have seen substantial increases in<br />
Australian sales of iron ore, processed iron and steel and<br />
manganese to China. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Amongst other interesting aspects of the recent exchanges,<br />
the Chinese industry has shown considerable interest in new<br />
steel-making technology that is available to the CRA group<br />
throught its part-ownership of the German steel producer,<br />
Kloeckner. I am confident that further development of iron and steel<br />
co-operation between Australia and China will generate<br />
immense benefits for the people of our two countries. </p>
