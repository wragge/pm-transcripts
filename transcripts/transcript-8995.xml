PRIME MINIS11TER<br />
TRANSCItIPT OF PJNTERVIEW WITH PRIME MNJSTER, THlE HON. P J<br />
KEATING, XM?, PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRAL EA<br />
SATURDAY 9 OCTOBER, 1993<br />
3: Prime Ministe, Mir Court said ther was nio pro~ ress. Do you agree with tha?<br />
PM: Well, It was a reasonably convivial discussion that we had, and I ffhink tha t it<br />
certainly bad a very friendly and cooperative towb,. But the ' Premier has this view<br />
that much of Western Australia will fall to native title that much of Wes1ezn<br />
Australias area will b6 native title. Well, that ma~ y in the end be true. That's a matter<br />
that was decided by the High Court of Austraia not by me. The question I put to<br />
him then, is, '" Which way ma you bring certain* y for the people of Wes= er Aumtnlia.<br />
for the economic use of this land?" I say only via our legislation. The<br />
Commonwealth is the only authority which is go ing to legislate with an eye to the<br />
twin objectives of social justice for Aboriginals and a proper system of land<br />
manapucmnt for srates. Anid econorric use for slates.<br />
And, I explainied to him that tde economic use part of the bill is exclusively<br />
dominated by the stars. Theme is no Commonwealt tribunal there. Its the Mining<br />
Board and it's courts reconfigured but still there and there is an over-ride by<br />
state, minism r. So, I said to im " Where. else ame you going to get this sort of<br />
certainty if ites not frorm u3, where?". And he says. " Well, I don't like the Hligh<br />
Court decision." WeIl you know, I don't think ihe nation is going to overtur the<br />
High Cow~ r decision.<br />
Y: So you're saying hes not facing the fact4, then?<br />
PM: WelL, he says that state land mranagemnent should be left to stte ministers. Well, this<br />
has been. by and large, true state ministers miking grdnts of interest over Crown<br />
land. Bat a lot of the Crown land will now beccmne native title land a proportion<br />
of it will become native title land because the High Court has said there is a native<br />
title in the common law. Now, I don~ t know wl. a you do about that.<br />
PM: Do you think he understands that or do you think he's playing local politics?<br />
Canberra bashing has always gone downi well over hert.<br />
PM: Well, if he understands the point I don't think he~ accepts the point that the Hligh<br />
Court has made a seminal decision here. And What rye been tryin to do with the<br />
states all of them, including West= r Ausuralia is to sit down and say let's get a<br />
11. Oct. 93 8: 29 NNo. 0. 001 P.. 8018/ 10 </p>
<p>TEL<br />
regime together here that works for the country, works, for the whole nation. So the<br />
Aboriginal people feel they've got a stake bi it but by the samie token it doesn't gum<br />
up the workcs in terms of economnic develpment. Now, the Bill is a good Bill. Its a<br />
fair and offective piece of draft law. And I asked ii if he wanted an outline of the<br />
draft bill and he said yes and rye undertaken to let him have that. And Icnrainly<br />
hope that when he goes through it he will mee that the Comnmonwealth has done Vl it<br />
can reasonably do to make this a workable systerr of land mainalernent while at the<br />
surie tirm trying to handle the very reasonable aspirations of Aboriginal people for<br />
justice,<br />
1: Whai about these claims that he's beon shut out ol negotiations? Wes been saying<br />
that for a couplc of weeks.<br />
PM: Theme are all matters of choice on Western Austrulia's part. T mean, obviously, the<br />
Cornrnonwealth isn't going to shut anyone out of -these negotiations. We'll talk to the<br />
Aboriginal conumunity, we'll talk to the states. A'id T certainly welcome him in that.<br />
And I hope that he takes the position that the othcr Coalition premiers have taken.<br />
Now, I think he says, " Well they don't have our problern." But ' ours' is a national<br />
problemn.<br />
P: So you're still poles apart then, aren't you?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know whether the Pzmniier is poles a part with me as inuch as lhe is poles<br />
apart with the Eligh Court I think thats the probhl. b<br />
J1: So thores no way you can depend on Richard Co-at for any kind of national solution<br />
on this?<br />
PM: weUi, I didn't comne here today expecting him to SILty, " well, rm giving your Bill a<br />
tick." But, I did expect a serious and proper conlrersation, you know, " n that's what<br />
rye had with him. The public interest demands that heads of government get on with<br />
Setting things worked OUL And that's what we sought to do here today.<br />
3: Can you understad why Wes= er Australian Abcriginals would be very, very<br />
doubtful about having state based tribunals given the attitude of the state government<br />
towards the igh Court decision?<br />
PM; WeUj, this is a nation wide view of Aboriginal pecple against states generally. And<br />
that's why the Comrmonwealth, in its outline, has tried to cover off all those nice<br />
balances between Aboriginal interests legitimate aspirations and interests of<br />
Aboriginal people and the very clear-interest th~ e states have in land management.<br />
It's a nice It seeks to reah a nice balance and T think we've largely achieved that.<br />
J: Where do you stand on the suspension of the Racial Discimination Act?<br />
PM: The Bill will be consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act<br />
On another matter, Archbishop Turn wants the Australian Governent and industry<br />
to invest in South Africa. What's your reaction to that call. T1EL1: . Oct. 93 8: 29 No. 001 P. 09/ 10 </p>
<p>TEL: 11. Oct. 93 8: 29 No. 001 P. 10/ 10<br />
3 0-<br />
PM: We14 I think that as South Afica resolves its economic difficulies as ifs clear that<br />
them is a stablc political basis to the managmeitt, of the couny I don't think the calls<br />
will be necessary. I think youll see investment flow from various parts of the world<br />
The conomic sanctions have been lifted now. ' Ibas the key point<br />
Ends&amp; </p>
