CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 16 SEPTEMBER, 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO THE COMM4ONWEALTH BROADCASTING ASSOCIATION<br />
SYDNEY<br />
It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the 13th Conference. of<br />
the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association. This welcome is<br />
strengthened in the knowledge that you represent an important.<br />
part of the activities of an institution that Australians value<br />
very highly the Commonwealth of Nations. May I also say how<br />
pleased I am to see here the General Manager of our own national<br />
broadcasting service Sir Talbot Duckmanton.<br />
Sir Talbot has been a leading figure in Australian broadcasting<br />
for many years now and I know his contribution to the development<br />
of Commonwealth broadcasting has been considerable. We welcome<br />
him back after a protracted illness.<br />
This Conference is virtually a microcosm of the Commonwealth; drawing<br />
together people f rom countries of diverse economic and political system;<br />
countries which range in population from the smallest to ' the biggest<br />
in the world; in geography from our nearest neighbours to some who are<br />
farthest removed from this region. Yet there are bonds between our<br />
nations which make a strength of this diversity; which enable it to<br />
serve as a framework of co= mmunication and co-operation beneficial<br />
to us all.<br />
As an international association, the Commonwealth of Nations is<br />
unique. For it is not based on the same geographical region; like<br />
ASEAN, or the organisation of African unity. Nor is it based on<br />
a common ideology or interest, like the non-aligned movement.<br />
But members of the Commonwealth share a common history, a language<br />
and a heritage of values. And these give rise to a shared vision<br />
of the kind of world we are working together to create.<br />
Nowhere is this vision better enshrined than in the Declaration of<br />
Con-monwealth Principles, unanimously adopted by 31 Heads of<br />
Government in Singapore in 1971. These cover such fundamental<br />
matters as international peace and order; the liberty of the<br />
individual; racial prejudice; disparities in wealth between<br />
countries of international co-operation.<br />
Of course, the Commonwealth could simply have gone through the<br />
motions of pursuing ti-lese principles, preserving-a facade of unity<br />
by avoiding contentious issues. Indeed, for a long time, the<br />
Commonwealth had to contend with the defeatist and negative view<br />
that it did not have the potential for a continuing and<br />
constructive role in world affairs. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
It is not such a long time ago that many people openly.<br />
questioned the very purpose of the Commonwealth in a ' modern world.<br />
It was regarded as an anachronism; a relic of the British Empire,<br />
with little relevance in a world of completely changed political,<br />
economic and social realities. I think that scepticism has<br />
been firmly put to rest over the last few years.<br />
-The Commonwealth has proven itself able to adapt to change, to<br />
become a vehicle for constructive action, and exchange. Indeed,<br />
it has retained the active involvement of so many nations<br />
precisely because it has faced all the major issues head on.<br />
One need only look at the agendas and communiques of the meetings<br />
of Heads of Government to appreciate that fact.<br />
Of course, the most dramatic example of the potency of the<br />
Commonwealth in international affairs was given by the 1979<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka. It laid the<br />
framework for a settlement of the conflict in Zimbabwe, a<br />
settlement that had eluded the prolonged efforts of major powers..<br />
I have recently returned from a meeting of Regional Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government in New Delhi. There, our discussions covered<br />
key developments in this part of the world including trade and<br />
energy, and the vexing problems in Kampuchea and Afghanistan.<br />
. Regional meetings of this kind'are a good example of the ability<br />
of the Commonwealth to adapt to new situations.<br />
Indeed, the concept of a regional meeting arose-from an Australian<br />
perception that the special concerns and interests of South and<br />
South-East Asia, and particularly the Pacific Ocean region, could<br />
usefully be discussed in the informal and frank way that has<br />
characterised larger Commonwealth meetings. It was seen as a<br />
regional complement to what the Commonwealth. Heads of Government<br />
Meeting does on a global scale.<br />
Australia consulted its Asian and Pacific Commonwealth neighbours,<br />
found the idea well received, and issued invitations to a meeting<br />
in Sydney in February, 1978. This meeting demonstrated that the<br />
CHOGRM concept had indeed responded to a genuinely felt need by<br />
the participants.<br />
The subsequent meeting in New Delh i, and the agreement to hold a<br />
third meeting in Fiji in 1982, have underscored the success of<br />
this initiative.<br />
Of course, the next 12 months will be of particular interest to<br />
Australia as we prepare to host the 1981 Heads of Government<br />
Meeting in Melbourne. This will be the most important<br />
international meeting ever held in Australia, bringing together<br />
more than 40 Heads of Government. We are honoured to have been<br />
chosen as host for the meeting and accept this honour as a<br />
recognition of the constructive role that Australia has played in<br />
Commonwealth and international affairs. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Arrangements are already in hand for the organisation of-this<br />
meeting; and I am confident that it will enjoy the succe'ss that<br />
has characterised past meetings; and that it will make a<br />
significant contribution to the consideration of imoportant world<br />
issu es ' ahd the furthering of Commonwealth co-operation.<br />
But in the longer term the strength and vitality of the Commonwealth<br />
depend on far more than the links between Heads of Governm~ nt.<br />
Most importantly, they rely on the links betw~ een people at all<br />
levels. In a couple of years' time, Australia will be the proud<br />
host of the Commonwealth Games. This must surely be the biggest<br />
single event that brings Commonwealth people together, because<br />
it is an event that is shared, not only by those who participate,<br />
but also by the millions who follow it through the media.. And that<br />
is something which underscores the special role played by the<br />
organisations you represent at this Conference.<br />
For the vast majority of our populations who cannot attend<br />
conferences, Games and gatherings of this kind, the reality of the,<br />
Commonwealth and its value is derived, in large part, from what you,..<br />
the broadcasters, say about it. And also, from what you don't say.<br />
As a pol * itician, I am very aware of the importance of the media in<br />
shaping popular perceptions and creating the environment within<br />
which the politician must operate. Commonwealth Heads of Government'<br />
have explicitly recognised the importance of mass communication<br />
in a number of ways.<br />
Part of the Lusaka Declaration on Racism and Racial Prejudice<br />
reads: " We are particularly conscious of the importance of the<br />
contribution the media can make to human rights and the eradication<br />
of racism and racial prejudice by helping to eliminate ignorance<br />
and misunderstanding between people and by drawing attention to the<br />
evils which afflict humanity. We affirm the importance of<br />
truthful presentation of facts in order to ensure that the public<br />
are fully informed of-the dangers presented by racism and racialism".<br />
Lusaka also saw two initiatives, both suggested by the Australian<br />
Government, of relevance to this Conference. The first was the<br />
establishment of a Commonwealth Committee on Communications and<br />
the Media. This Committee has been identifying the most pressing<br />
communications and media problems experienced by Commonwealth<br />
countries, especially the developing ones, and suggesting suitable<br />
forms of practical co-operation to tackle them. Its frame of<br />
reference covers some of the areas that are right in the forefront<br />
of current international discussions such as the role of the major<br />
international news agencies. The agencies have a traditional<br />
European and North American orientation which shapes the news<br />
they cover.<br />
This creates concern, particularly among developing countries, that<br />
many of the problems and perspectives which they regard as important<br />
are not being adequately covered. It is an extremely thorny issue<br />
and we will be looking with great interest at the Committee's<br />
report to the next Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne. </p>
<p>-4<br />
No doubt, the CBA will be one of the bodies-involved in * 1<br />
implementing any recommendations which flow from this report.<br />
A second Lusaka initiative was the establishment of the<br />
Commonw-ealth media exchange scheme, and I understand that the<br />
CBA was involved in the formulation of its criteria. Iloves are<br />
now underway for the first of the proposed exchanges to take<br />
place, taking Australian journalists to agencies in developing<br />
Commonwealth countries and bringing journalists from such<br />
-countries here. These exchanges will heighten the sensitivity<br />
with which news is gathered and interpreted. Such sensitivity<br />
can be of inestimable value in prom~ oting the awareness and<br />
understanding we have of one another; for the people of the media<br />
are so often our only source of knowledge of far-off places.<br />
and events.<br />
Education, information, entertainment; broadcasting is<br />
absolutely central to all of ther.. The organisations representedin<br />
the C. B. A. broadcast television and radio to a combined<br />
population of about 1000 million people. This gives you enormous<br />
power, but it brings with it great responsibility a. s to how<br />
this power is exercised. It also means that, on occasions, the<br />
accurate presentation of world events requires that men and women<br />
from your organisations live in the shadow of danger.<br />
Only-this year, a young and talented member of our o-wn national<br />
broadcasting service lost his life-. I know that these dangers<br />
; are faced and accepted as part of the respons'ible pursuit of<br />
truth. But too often, as we benefit from the world being brought<br />
into our drawing rooms, we are una-ware of the high professionalism<br />
and sense of responsibility that attend much of what goes on in<br />
bringing to us all, the news of the world.<br />
I know that many of the topics you will be looking at at this<br />
Congress reflect your awareness of the twin concepts of power<br />
and responsibility. For example, " impartiality and fairness" in<br />
news and current affairs broadcasting; and " violence on<br />
television". These and other broadcasting issues, such as the<br />
choice of appropriate technologies, are current in Australia.<br />
There is much for us to learn from you in these matters, and, f<br />
no doubt there is much in our experience from which you will benefit.:<br />
And this is essentially what the Commonwealth representis a basis<br />
for the exchange of ideas and information; a platform for<br />
co-operation. I wish you well in your deliberations. You face<br />
a most formidable and challenging agenda; and I have no doubt<br />
that your discussions and your resolutions will contribute not only<br />
to-the needs of the Commonwealth; but to those of the wider<br />
world beyond.<br />
I am grateful for the invitation to be with you today and I have<br />
much pleasure in declaring this Conference open. </p>
