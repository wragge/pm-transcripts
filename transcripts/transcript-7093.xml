PRIME MINISTER'S PRESENTATION TO WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM<br />
SPECIAL SEMINAR<br />
DAVOS,. 4 30 JANUARY 1987<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW ECONOMIC LINKS WITH AUSTRALIA<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
THIS MORNING I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THE WAY_ I SEE<br />
AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC POTENTIAL, AND THE OPPORTUNITIES<br />
AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITH AN INTEREST IN FORGING CLOSER<br />
ECONOMIC LINKS WITH OUR ECONOMY THROUGH INVESTMENT IN<br />
AUSTRALIA. IAM PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE EME ORGANISERS HAVE AGAIN<br />
MANAGED TO ATTRACT A LARGE AND VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS<br />
AUDIENCE To DAVOS. FOR OUR PART, 4 VIEIMPORTANCE AUSTRALIA<br />
ATTACHES TO THIS CONFERENCE IS REFLECTED IN THE FACT THAT<br />
IAM SUPPORTED BY MY COLLEAGUE THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY,<br />
TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE, SENATOR JOHN BUTTON AND BY A<br />
DISTINGUISHED DELEGATION OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIALISTS.<br />
MEMBERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS DELEGATION WILL BE HAPPY<br />
TO ASSIST YOU WITH ANY MATTERS RELEVANT TO THEIR FIELD OF<br />
INTEREST. ANOTHER OF MY MINISTERS, PRIMARY INDUSTRY MINISTER<br />
JOHN KERIN. 0 WILL BE ARRIVING AT DAVOS-EARLY NEXT WEEK TO<br />
DISCUSS WITH YOU THE AGRICULTURAL TRADE INITIATIVE ILAUNCHED<br />
LAST NIGHT.<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>2<br />
WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF TIME, AND TO PERMIT AS MANY OF<br />
YOUR QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE, IWILL BEGIN BY OUTLINING THE<br />
STRENGTHS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY AND THE BROAD ECONOMIC<br />
STRATEGY OF my GOVERNMENT. JOHN BUTTON WILL FOLLOW UP BY<br />
DETAILING SOME OF THE SPECIFICS OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY AND<br />
INVESTMENT POLICY.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY HAS CERTAIN-STRENGTHS WHICH MAKE IT<br />
INHERENTLY ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS. WE HAVE A SKILLED<br />
WORKFORCE, A RICH NATURAL RESOURCE BASE, AND A WELL-DEVELOPED<br />
INFRASTRUCTURE.<br />
WE ARE ALSO CLOSE, IN GEOGRAPHICAL AND POLITICAL TERMS,<br />
TO THE MOST DYNAMIC ECONOMIC GROWTH AREA IN THE WORLDi THE<br />
WESTERN PACIFIC RIM.<br />
WE ARE POLITICALLY STABLE AND SHARE BROAD BIPARTISANSHIP<br />
ON THE ECONOMIC GOALS OF GROWTH THROUGH INVESTMENT.<br />
OUR NATURAL ADVANTAGES HAVE EARNED US THE TAG ' THE LUCKY<br />
COUNTRY'. THAT NAME IS APT -WE ARE LUCKY. BUT OUR GOOD<br />
FORTUNE HAS ALSO BEEN THE SOURCE OF SOME DIFFICULTIES AND<br />
IMBALANCES IN OUR ECONOMY. IT HAD LULLED US INTO<br />
COMPLACENCY DURING THE LONG EASY DECADES OF GROWTH AFTER<br />
WORLD WAR Two. * 1 .111V7r 11, I Ir 1* t. </p>
<p>3.<br />
DURING THOSE YEARS, WE RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON THE EFFICIENT<br />
PRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL STAPLES, SUPPLEMENTED BY AN<br />
APPARENTLY ENDLESS ABILITY TO SATISFY WORLD DEMAND FOR RAW<br />
MINERALS. OUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR WAS HEAVILY PROTECTED<br />
AND WAS ORIENTED LARGELY TOWARDS THE SMALL DOMESTIC MARKET,<br />
WE WERE A LESS RELIABLE SUPPLIER THAN WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.<br />
OUR ECONOMY AS A WHOLE FAILED-TO -RECOGNISE, AND WAS NOT<br />
STRUCTURED TO CAPITALISE ON, THE-POTENTIAL OF OUR NEIGHBOURS<br />
IN THE PACIFIC RIM.<br />
THE DANGERS IN THIS APPROACH WERE DRAMATICALLY HIGHLIGHTED<br />
FOR US IN 1985/ 86 WHEN WE SUFFERED A HUGE TURNAROUND IN OUR<br />
TERMS OF TRADE. THANKS IN PART TO THE SHARP DROP IN THE PRICES<br />
OF THE PRIMARY COMMODITIES WHICH MAKE UP SUCH A LARGE PART<br />
OF OUR EXPORTS, WE LOST OVER THE 18 MONTHS FROM EARLY 1985<br />
ABOUT $ A6 BILLION IN NATIONAL INCOME, OR 3% OFF OUR CAPACITY<br />
TO MAINTAIN EXISTING LIVING STANDARDS.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A LARGE DEPRECIATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR<br />
OVER THIS PERIOD. WHILE A CORNERSTONE OF THE LONGER-TERM<br />
REBUILDING OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, THIS DEPRECIATION HAS<br />
NONETHELESS BROUGHT SOME SHORT-TERM DIFFICULTIES BY INITIALLY<br />
WORSENING OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DIFFICULTIES, WHICH ARE<br />
NOW RECEDING, AND BY FUELLING A TEMPORARY RESURGENCE IN<br />
INFLATION. I </p>
<p>THE REASON WE ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR FUTURE IS THAT WE<br />
CAN NOW LOOK ON A VERY DIFFERENT AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY FROM<br />
THAT OF FIVE YEARS AGO ONE WHICH IS SHAKING OFF ITS<br />
COMPLACENCY, WHICH IS BECOMING MORE DYNAMIC AND<br />
ENTREPRENEURIAL, AND WHICH IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE<br />
SUSTAINED EFFORT NEEDED TO REDUCE OUR OVER RELIANCE ON<br />
THE PRODUCTION AND EXPORT OF PRIMARY COMMODITIES.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY<br />
STEPS TO MAKE THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY MORE COMPETITIVE AND<br />
TO ENSURE THAT IT REMAINS SO. WE ARE PREPARED, AS A<br />
COMMUNITY, TO MAINTAIN OUR EFFORT FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES.<br />
I WANT TO BRIEFLY COVER THE MAIN FEATURES OF OUR<br />
MACROECONOMIC POLICY AND OUR INDUSTRY REVITALISATION<br />
POLICIES. I WILL SAY MORE LATER ABOUT OUR APPROACH TO THE TRADITIONAL<br />
MACROECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY. LET<br />
ME TURN FIRST TO AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN QUITE INNOVATIVE. </p>
<p>ONE OF OUR FIRST TASKS IN GOVERNMENT WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
AN EFFECTIVE INCOMES POLICY THROUGH A CO-OPERATIVE ACCORD<br />
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT. UNDER<br />
THIS HISTORIC AGREEMENT, THE UNION MOVEMENT AGREED TO WAGE<br />
MODERATION AND GREATLY IMPROVED INDUSTRIAL HARMONY. THIS<br />
AGREEMENT HAS ENABLED REAL WAGES TO FALL SUBSTANTIALLY OVER<br />
THE LAST THREE YEARS, WITHOUT INDUSTRIAL STRIFE,-DESPITE A<br />
STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY,<br />
IN RETURN THE UNION MOVEMENT SOUGHT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE<br />
SOCIAL WAGE THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE, BETTER MEDICAL INSURANCE<br />
ARRANGEMENTS AND INCOME TAX CUTS. AND OF COURSE, THE UNIONS<br />
LOOKED TOWARDS THE GREATER JOB SECURITY AND IMPROVEMENTS IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS THAT WAGE RESTRAINT OFFERED.<br />
THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING: IN THE 44 MONTHS SINCE<br />
THE EMPLOYMENT TROUGH OF APRIL 19831 752,000 NEW JOBS HAVE<br />
BEEN CREATED.<br />
ACCOMPANYING OUR MACROECONOMIC POLICIES WAS A PROGRAM OF<br />
REFORMS DESIGNED TO SECURE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT AND TO<br />
MAKE THE ECONOMY MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR PART OF THE WORLD TO WHICH I HAVE JUST<br />
REFERRED. WE MADE AN EARLY DECISION TO FLOAT THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR<br />
AND TO DEREGULATE FINANCIAL MARKETS. AN OVER-VALUED<br />
EXCHANGE RATE IN THE LATE 1970s AND EARLY 1980s HAD IMPAIRED<br />
THE COMPETITIVENESS OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY. </p>
<p>WE SET IN PLACE PLANS FOR PHASING DOWN THE PROTECTION OF<br />
OUR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND ENCOURAGED THEM TO BECOME<br />
INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE, EXPORT ORIENTED AND INNOVATIVE.<br />
WE REMOVED OR EASED THE CONTROLS ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT<br />
EXPORTS--WE DEREGULATED OTHER PARTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY.--WE REFORMED -THE--AUSTRALIAN-TAXAT-ION-SYS-TEM.---------<br />
AND WE LIBERALISED FOREIGN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES.<br />
WE WERE ALREADY BUILDING A MORE FLEXIBLE, OPEN ECONOMY, AND<br />
THESE ENDEAVOURS STOOD US IN GOOD STEAD WHEN OUR TERMS OF<br />
TRADE TURNED AGAINST US IN 1985/ 86.<br />
BUT THE SIZE OF THE EXTERNAL PROBLEM CALLED FOR FURTHER<br />
POLICY ADJUSTMENTS.<br />
MONETARY POLICY WAS TIGHTENED TO CeRTAIN IMPORT DEMAND AND<br />
TO COUNTER THE INFLATIONARY EFFECTS OF THE WEAKENING AUSTRALIAN<br />
DOLLAR. HOWEVER, SOLE RELIANCE ON MONETARY POLICY FOR ANY<br />
LENGTH OF TIME WOULD HAVE HAD INTOLERABLE EFFECTS ON BUSINESS<br />
CONFIDENCE AND INVESTMENT, WHICH WOULD BE INIMICAL TO LONGERTERM<br />
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT. SO, IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS STEPPED UP ITS EFFORTS TO REDUCE ITS FISCAL DEFICIT AS<br />
A SHARE OF GDP AND TO RESTRAIN NOMINAL WAGES GROWTH.<br />
I </p>
<p>THROUGH CURTAILED PAYMENTS TO STATE GOVERNMENTS, MORE<br />
SEVERE LIMITATIONS ON THEIR BORROWING CAPACITY AND AN EXTREMELY<br />
AUSTERE 1986/ 87 FEDERAL BUDGET, THE GOVERNMENT ACTED LAST<br />
YEAR TO GREATLY REDUCE THE PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING<br />
REQUIREMENT. THE FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT HAS BEEN REDUCED<br />
TO AROUND ONE AND A HALF PER CENT OF GDP, COMPARED WITH<br />
PER CENT OF GDP -IN PROSPECT WHEN-WE CAME . TO OFFICEIN 1983.<br />
I ASK WHAT COMPARABLE COUNTRY CAN BOAST OF THAT DEGREE OF<br />
FISCAL ADJUSTMENT OVER THE PERIOD?<br />
ON THE WAGES FRONT, WITH THE CO-OPERATION OF THE TRADE<br />
UNION MOVEMENT, WE ARE EXPECTING TO ACHIEVE AN OUTCOME FOR<br />
WAGES GROWTH IN THIS YEAR THAT IS BROADLY IN LINE WITH THAT<br />
OF OUR MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS AND THUS SUBSTANTIALLY TO<br />
PRESERVE THE ENORMOUS COMPETITIVE FILLIP PROVIDED BY THE<br />
DEPRECIATION. BUT IN ADDITION TO RESTRAINING LABOUR COSTS, THE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS INITIATED MEASURES DESIGNED TO BOOST LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY<br />
DIRECTLY. TRADE UNIONS AND BUSINESS ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED<br />
IN A JOINT EXAMINATION OF OUTMODED, RESTRICTIVE WORK AND<br />
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN EASING THESE<br />
PRODUCTIVITY-DESTROYING PRACTICES IN A SPIRIT OF CO-OPERATION<br />
AND CONCERN BY ALL PARTIES SO AS TO MAKE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
MORE EFFICIENT, MORE FLEXIBLE, MORE COMPETITIVE.<br />
I </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA NOW HAS A SOUND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEM:<br />
IT HAS A RESPONSIBLE WORKFORCE THAT RECOGNISES THE BENEFITS<br />
OF WAGE MODERATION, OF GREATER PRODUCTIVITY AND OF GREATER<br />
INDUSTRIAL HARMONY.<br />
THROUGH OUR MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT POLICIES WE HAVE<br />
CONVERTED A LARGE DEPRECIATIONOF -THE AUJSTRALIAN DOLLARINTO<br />
STRONG AND WE EXPECT SUSTAINED, REAL GAINS IN<br />
INTERNATIONAL. COMPETITIVENESS FOR AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.<br />
THE OUTCOME OF THIS ECONOMIC STRATEGY IS THAT AUSTRALIA IS<br />
NOW WELL PLACED TO CAPITALISE UPON THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC AND FURTHER AFIELD.<br />
THERE ARE ALREADY ENCOURAGING SIGNS THAT OUR INDUSTRIES ARE<br />
RESPONDING TO THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR COMPETITIVENESS<br />
AND WINNING NEW CONTRACTS AT HOME AND ABROAD. RECENT<br />
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS FIGURES INDICATE THAT THE CURRENT ACCOUNT<br />
DEFICIT IS FALLING: IN FACT AUSTRALIA RECORDED A MERCHANDISE<br />
TRADE SURPLUS LAST MONTH, THE FIRST IN 16 MONTHS.<br />
IT PERHAPS NEEDS TO BE STRESSED TO AN AUDIENC&amp; mIN EUROPE<br />
JUST HOW FAR THE FOCUS OF DYNAMIC ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS SHIFTED<br />
TO THE PACIFIC REGION. </p>
<p>LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A COUPLE OF INDICATORS OF THE VITALITY<br />
OF OUR REGION: TWO YEARS AGO, TRANS-PACIFIC TRADE SURPASSED<br />
THAT OF TRANS-ATLANTIC TRADE FOR THE FIRST TIME; AND EAST<br />
ASIA'S SHARE OF WORLD GNP HAS ALMOST TRIPLED SINCE THE LAST<br />
QUARTER CENTURY. AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY FOR THE REMAINDER OF<br />
THE CENTURY IS WELL POISED TO COMPETE IN THIS REGION.<br />
IWANT BRIEFLY TO SKETCH HOW I SEE CHANGES IN TWO OF THE<br />
REGION'S LARGEST ECONOMIES ASSISTING US IN THIS.<br />
JAPAN IS ON THE THRESHOLD OF A NATURAL RESTRUCTURING PROCESS<br />
WHICH OFFERS THE PROSPECT OF LARGE IMPORTS OF MANUFACTURES<br />
UTILISING STANDARDISED TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING COMPONENTS,<br />
AND A RANGE OF SERVICES INCLUDING OVERSEAS TOURISM.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S OWN RESTRUCTURING PROCESS WILL BE COMPLEMENTARY<br />
TO THE CHANGES IN JAPAN, N'OWHERE IS THIS MORE EVIDENT THAN<br />
IN BASIC METAL PRODUCTION. JAPANESE BASIC METAL PRODUCTION<br />
HAS BEEN CONTRACTING SLOWLY UNDER COMPETITIVE PRESSURE FOR<br />
MORE THAN A DECADE WHILE AUSTRALIA HAS A STRONG COMPARATIVE<br />
ADVANTAGE IN THESE INDUSTRIES. As JAPANESE EXPORTS OF STEEL<br />
AND NON-FERROUS METALS LOSE THEIR COMPETITIVENESS, AUSTRALIA<br />
WILL BE WELL POSITIONED TO STEP INTO THE BREACH.<br />
THE OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIC FORCE IN OUR REGION IS CHINA. THE<br />
MODERNISATION PROGRAM OF THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP IS CREATING<br />
HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT. </p>
<p>WHILE THE PACE OF CHINA'S MODERNISATION IS NOW BEING<br />
CONSTRAINED BY THE COUNTRY'S EXTERNAL IMBALANCES, GROWTH<br />
CONTINUES AT RATES WELL ABOVE INTERNATIONAL AVERAGES.<br />
THE SHEER SIZE OF THE MODERNISATION-PROGRAM AND THE DEMAND<br />
FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS SUCH AS FINISHED STEEL THAT<br />
THIS -I-S-CALLI NG-FORTH,-ARE-CREATI-NG-OPPORTUNI-T-I-ES-FOR----<br />
SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS IN-COUNTRIES CAPABLE OF MEETING<br />
THAT DEMAND.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS SUCH A COUNTRY, IN ADDITION TO OUR GEOGRAPHICAL<br />
LOCATION AND OUR RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS, THE WARM RELATIONSHIPS<br />
THAT HAVE DEVELOPED BETWEEN MY GOVERNMENT AND THE CHINESE<br />
LEADERSHIP HAVE POSITIONED-AUSTRALIA AS A HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS<br />
LOCATION FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT AIMED AT SATISFYING THE<br />
CHINESE MARKET.<br />
IN FACT I DOUBT THAT ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT ENJOYS SUCH CLOSE<br />
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP AS THE PRESENT<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
AS WELL AS POSSESSING COMPETITIVE STRENGTH IN INDUSTRIES<br />
WHICH ADD VALUE TO OUR ABUNDANT NATURAL RESOURCES, AUSTRALIA<br />
HAS A COMPETITIVE SPRINGBOARD INTO THE REGION THROUGH ITS<br />
HIGH QUALITY SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITIES.<br />
V I-</p>
<p>11.<br />
THESE HAVE CREATED A NUMBER OF SMALL, INNOVATIVE COMPANIES<br />
USING NEW, SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES ESPECIALLY IN THE<br />
AREAS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE, MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT<br />
AND BIOTECHNOLOGY. THESE COMPANIES SPEND A HIGH PROPORTION<br />
THEIR TURNOVER ON R AND D AND ARE HIGHLY EXPORT ORIENTED.<br />
MANY ARE LOOKING TO FORM STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH OVERSEAS<br />
FIRMS IN ORDER TO FULLY REALISE-THEIR-DEVELOPMENT -POTENTIAL.-<br />
THE REAL DEPRECIATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR HAS ALSO<br />
IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
TRADED SERVICES INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE TOURIST INDUSTRY.<br />
THE POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH OF THE TOURIST-INDUSTRY, NOT THE<br />
LEAST IN TERMS OF TOURISM FROM JAPAN TO AUSTRALIA, IS<br />
ENORMOUS. ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE FOR BUSINESSMEN LIKE YOURSELVES TO<br />
JUDGE THE COMMERCIAL ATTRACTIVENESS' OF INVESTING IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN THE GREATLY IMPROVED<br />
COMPETITIVENESS OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.<br />
THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT HAS A POSITIVE COMMITMENT TO THE<br />
EXPANSION OF EXPORT-ORIENTED INDUSTRIES. I HAVE DISCUSSED<br />
THIS WITH THE TRADE UNION LEADERSHIP AND I CAK TELL YOU NOW<br />
THAT THE AUSTRALIAN TRADE UNION MOVEMENT WILL BE HAPPY TO<br />
HAVE CONSULTATIONS WITH POTENTIAL INVESTORS IN AUSTRALIA SO<br />
AS TO ASSURE THE NECESSARY CO-OPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYER<br />
AND THE WORKFORCE IN PROSPECTIVE PROJECTS. </p>
<p>12.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS WELL PLACED BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND POLITICALLY<br />
IN-THE MOST DYNAMIC REGION OF THE WORLD. WE WELCOME FOREIGN<br />
INVESTMENT AND I INVITE YOU TO AUSTRALIA TO MAKE YOUR OWN<br />
ASSESSMENTS OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY.<br />

120 World agriculture has not been in a<br />
100 worse position since the Great<br />
Depression. Commodity prices have<br />
been plummeting, seriously eroding<br />
and often ruining the financial position<br />
of farmers in many countries. The<br />
costs of farm programs have soared,<br />
imposing greatly increased burdens<br />
on taxpayers. At the same time,<br />
consumers in some advanced<br />
countries have been required to pay<br />
highly inflated food prices.<br />
The debt problems of many lessdeveloped<br />
countries have been<br />
accentuated, casting a shadow over<br />
the international monetary system.<br />
Many of the world's poor have been<br />
deprived of a livelihood.<br />
Unemployment has risen, especially<br />
in rural areas. Traditional international<br />
political alliances have been placed<br />
under strain.<br />
2200 2000 1800 Important Indicators of the<br />
1600 Crisis<br />
1400 The crisis in world agriculture is shown in<br />
1200 stark terms at Charts 1-3. In summary,<br />
100since the beginning of the decade:<br />
100 world wheat prices have fallen 50 per<br />
cent and stocks have risen by more than<br />
70 per cent,<br />
world sugar prices are down 80 per cent<br />
and stockpiles are 45 per cent higher;<br />
butter prices have fallen about 50 per<br />
cent and stocks have increased to a<br />
massive 1.7m tonnes;<br />
EC stocks of beef have risen to over<br />
600,000 tonnes about three times the<br />
usual level,<br />
feedgrains. rice and oilseeds have<br />
suffered similarly precipitous price<br />
declines and serious overproduction.<br />
The direct costs of farm programs have<br />
risen enormously: in the US to around<br />
US$ 26 billion from US$ 3-S billion early in<br />
the decade, in the EC costs have doubled<br />
USc.' I in the past 5 years reaching US$ 23 billion<br />
this year ( excluding direct expenditures<br />
by national governments), and in Japan<br />
taxpayers in 1985 paid US$ 10.5 billion in<br />
farm subsidies.<br />
" The direct costs of farm programs<br />
have risen..,. in the US to around<br />
US$ 26 billion, in the EC ,( to)<br />
0 US$ 23 billion this year" Budget costs tell only half the story.<br />
Consumer prices in Japan and the EC,<br />
and for some products in the US, are<br />
administered at levels much higher than<br />
world prices. This additional transfer paid<br />
to farmers by the public when they buy<br />
their food amounts in some cases to much<br />
more than the subsidies paid from<br />
taxation revenues.<br />
Taxpayer subsidies and consumer<br />
transfers in the EC are together costing<br />
more than US$ 900 each year for each<br />
non-farm European family. In the US, each<br />
non-farm family is paying around US$ 700<br />
of its annual taxes in subsidies to farmers,<br />
with additional significant consumer<br />
transfers. The figures for Japan per fulltime<br />
farmer would be significantly higher<br />
than these.'<br />
' Taxpayer subsidies and consumer<br />
transfers are costing more<br />
than US$ 900 each year for each<br />
non-farm European family.'<br />
Surpluses to Continue<br />
In the absence of substantial policy<br />
changes, the crisis in world agriculture will<br />
be with us into the 1990s ( see Chart 4).<br />
Despite the fact that world grain stocks<br />
have risen to the equivalent of two-and-ahalf<br />
years of total world trade, Australian<br />
projections show that, if current policies<br />
continue, stocks will rise further before<br />
slighlty declining.<br />
Causes of the World Crisis<br />
Factors on both the demand side and the<br />
supply side led to the current huge<br />
surpluses of farm products. In the decade<br />
ending 1982, the volume of world trade in<br />
agricultural commodities grew by 35 per<br />
cent. Most of this growth came from the<br />
developing countries. The early 1980s<br />
saw the period of buoyant world trade and<br />
economic growth come to an end.<br />
Developing country demand stagnated<br />
both because of slow international<br />
economic growth ( with the associated<br />
international debt crisis) and because of<br />
the effectiveness of their own agricultural<br />
development programs.<br />
Most importantly, however, the<br />
agricultural policies of the leading<br />
indlustrialised nations reduced the<br />
incentive for farmers to adjust to the<br />
changed world demand conditions. The<br />
outcome is depicted in Chart 5. A massive<br />
wedge of stocks accumulated as supply<br />
and demand diverged.<br />
The substitution of US Government<br />
payments for declining market returns is<br />
shown in Chart 6. As market prices tell,<br />
target prices moved in the opposite<br />
direction. For the EC and Japan ( Charts 7<br />
and 8) consumer transfers and direct<br />
subsidies were used increasingly to<br />
insulate farmers' returns from falling world<br />
market prices. </p>
<p>The Heart of the Problem<br />
The incentive to produce given by farm<br />
programs is causing supply to massively<br />
outstrip likely demand. This problem is<br />
compounded by the rigidity of these<br />
incentives and the rapid rate of growth in<br />
agricultural productivity. The magnitude of<br />
the excesstve incentive to produce<br />
cereals, sugar, butter and beef in Japan,<br />
the US and the EC is shown in Charts 9-<br />
12. It can be seen from the charts that Japan<br />
pays its rice, sugar and butter producers<br />
around eight times the world market price.<br />
The benefits it has received from access<br />
to world manufactures' markets have not<br />
been met by reciprocal access for<br />
exporters of agricultural products to the<br />
Japanese market.<br />
The Price Adjustment Gap<br />
The graphs in Chart 9 show the ratio of<br />
internal administered prices to world<br />
market prices. The Price Adjustment Gap<br />
( PAG) is equal to the extent to which that<br />
ratio exceeds unity. Direct and indirect<br />
subsidies are important determinants of<br />
this gap.<br />
The PAG can be closed from below as<br />
well as from above. If the incentive to<br />
produce was reduced through reductions<br />
in administered prices paid to farmers, the<br />
resultant reduced world supplies would<br />
facilitate recovery in international market<br />
prices. " The incentive to produce given by<br />
farm programs is causing supply to<br />
massively outstrip likely demand."<br />
Reduction of the PAG to zero is, in the<br />
foreseeable future, an unrealistic<br />
objective. Equally unrealistic, however, is<br />
the preservation of the gap at ifs current<br />
level. The aim is therefore to reduce the<br />
gap as fast as possible. A PAG of greater<br />
than 0.3 ( ie internal administered prices<br />
more than 30 per cent higher than world<br />
prices) should nnt be regarded as<br />
acceptable domestically, or<br />
internationally, in advanced industrial<br />
nations. Supply Control and Stock<br />
Management Reducing administered internal -prices is<br />
one way to encourage convergence of<br />
international and domestic prices. There<br />
are, however, other ways to work towards<br />
this objective. Some may wish to manage<br />
markets not only nationally but also<br />
internationally. About 40 International<br />
Commodity Agreements ( ICAs) covering<br />
13 commodities have been introduced<br />
since 1931. However, their record of<br />
success is very poor. " Japan pays its rice, sugar and<br />
butter producers around eight times<br />
the world market price."<br />
Direct supply controls face practical<br />
problems in effective administration, can<br />
inflate costs faced by producers and<br />
constrain improved efficiency through<br />
technological change.<br />
Supply control and market management<br />
are thus poor substitutes for the discipline<br />
needed to attack the underlying cause of<br />
the problem, namely high administered<br />
internal prices and associated trade<br />
restrictions. These must be the focus of<br />
farm policy reform. Nevertheless there are<br />
two areas where direct supply controls<br />
have a potential role to play.<br />
" supply controls can be a<br />
temporary substitute for deferred<br />
further reductions in administered<br />
prices."<br />
First, where the PAG is inordinately wide,<br />
reductions in internal prices will have to be<br />
phased in over a long period. In the early<br />
stages, direct supply controls can be a<br />
temporary substitute for deferred further<br />
reductions in administered prices. Such<br />
supply controls are the clear responsibility<br />
of the countries unable to reduce quickly<br />
their large PAGS.<br />
Second, while current enormous surplus<br />
stocks of grain, sugar, dairy products and<br />
beef overhang markets, world prices will<br />
be very slow to rise. There is a need to<br />
quarantine surplus stocks from the<br />
market, only releasing them in line with the<br />
success in reducing current production.<br />
Responsibility for the management and<br />
disposal of surplus stocks rests with the<br />
countries that accumulate them.<br />
Farm Incomes<br />
Governments are understandably<br />
reluctant to reduce support prices for<br />
farmers because of the posstble<br />
consequences for farm incomes.<br />
Government payments, for example,<br />
currently constitute about one half of the<br />
net cash incomes of US farmers.<br />
Subsidies and consumer transfers in the<br />
EC and Japan make up an even higher<br />
proportion of farm returns.<br />
" if administered prices are reduced<br />
by a number of countries acting in<br />
concert and if stocks are<br />
quarantined and managed, steady<br />
improvements in market prices will<br />
help compensate for reduced<br />
subsidies" Chart 4: US and world grain stocks<br />

number of countries acting in concert and<br />
if stocks are quarantined and managed,<br />
steady improvements in market prices will<br />
help compensate for reduced subsidies<br />
and transfers. Nevertheless, farm incomes<br />
would fall in the short term, necessitating<br />
support and adjustment measures.<br />
While inevitably income support measures<br />
will have some impact on the level of<br />
output, this impact can be minimised by<br />
separating income support from the<br />
prices received by farmers for their<br />
p~ roduction.<br />
Achieving Change: Internal<br />
Timetables The next several months will be a very<br />
active period of domestic agricultural<br />
policy decision making.<br />
The US agenda includes an expected<br />
Congressional debate on farm policy,<br />
triggered by the recent Presidential<br />
proposals to reform some provisions of<br />
the Farm Bill. Program decisions,<br />
including loan rates, target prices and setaside<br />
provisions, will begin to be<br />
announced in June, with the wheat<br />
program, and will continue through<br />
October. " The next several months will be a<br />
very active period of domestic<br />
agricultural policy decisionmaking."<br />
In the EC, the Commission's price<br />
proposals for 1987-88 are expected to be<br />
debated in the Council of Ministers until<br />
decisions are announced, most likely in<br />
April. In Japan, the Diet has the 1987-88<br />
budget, including farm spending, under<br />
review at the present time. Livestock price<br />
decisions are due in March and crop<br />
prices in the period July through<br />
September. If early significant reform is to be<br />
achieved, it must be reflected in the<br />
decisions taken in this timetable.<br />
Achieving Change:<br />
International Timetables<br />
Concerted changes in farm policies in<br />
many countries are needed to share<br />
equitably the burden of adjustment. While<br />
the requisite immediate decisions are a<br />
matter for national decision making, the<br />
climate for change can be improved if<br />
nations act in concert. A broad<br />
international accord is therefore needed.<br />
A series of important international<br />
meetings are scheduled for the first half of<br />
1987, including:<br />
a meeting of wheat exporters in the US<br />
in February:<br />
the meeting of Trade Ministers<br />
scheduled for New Zealand in March,<br />
the Ministerial Council Meeting of the<br />
OECD in May, the meeting of the World Food Council in<br />
June; a critically important meeting of Western<br />
leaders at the Economic Summit<br />
scheduled for Venice, also in June.<br />
Each of these meetings should add to the<br />
momentum for reform of farm policies and<br />
agricultural trade and interact with the<br />
domestic farm policy timetable discussed<br />
above.<br />
The Need for Immediate<br />
Action<br />
The crisis cannot be allowed to persist, yet<br />
the MTN negotiating process will<br />
inevitably be protracted.<br />
Early reform would facilitate progress<br />
during the MTN by removing important<br />
obstacles to the negotiation of new rules<br />
for the conduct of agricultural trade. It<br />
would also encourage wider MTN<br />
progress by example, and by the<br />
incentive given to countries which, while<br />
badly affected by agricultural<br />
protectionism themselves, protect their<br />
own sensitive areas.<br />
Australia's Commitment<br />
Australia's rural sector is, of course, not<br />
highly protected: rural policy in Australia<br />
will continue to facilitate the<br />
responsiveness of our farmers to<br />
changing international prices. Australia<br />
does, however, have relatively high tariffs<br />
in some manufacturing sectors.<br />
During 1986 Australia took action to<br />
increase the competitive pressures on its<br />
textile, clothing and footwear and<br />
chemicals and plastics industries, two<br />
important manufacturing sectors. Similar<br />
action has been taken in our motor vehicle<br />
and steel industries. Australia has<br />
recognised the costs of insulating<br />
important sectors from international<br />
competition and has not waited for the<br />
finalisation of MTN negotiations to take<br />
action. Australia is committed to making the MTN<br />
round a success. To demonstrate this<br />
commitment Australia is prepared to state<br />
its willingness to negotiate the binding of<br />
tariff levels in all sectors of Australia's tariff<br />
regime. This is a significant commitment<br />
given that Australia in the past has bound<br />
only a very low portion of its tariff.<br />
The Uruguay Round and<br />
Agriculture In September 1986 the GATT Contracting<br />
Parties agreed, in the Ministerial<br />
Declaration launching the Uruguay<br />
Round, to aim for agricultural trade<br />
liberalisation and to strengthen GATT<br />
rules and disciplines affecting agricultural<br />
trade. " A series of important international<br />
meetings are scheduled for the first<br />
half of 1987" </p>
<p>In the spirit of the Uruguay Declaration,<br />
the Australian Minister for Trade has<br />
explored, with several of the major trading<br />
countries, the concept of a ' ceasefire' on<br />
subsidies directly or indirectly affecting<br />
agricultural trade. A ceasef ire' would<br />
provide a necessary breathing space and<br />
a stable basis for the negotiated rolling<br />
back of these subsidies.<br />
There seems considerable in-principle<br />
support for the ceasef ire concept.<br />
Discussion has focused on the best<br />
means for effective implementation and<br />
monitoring. One simple and effective<br />
means to implement the ceasefire is for it<br />
to be applied to a measure which reflects<br />
important farm subsidies, namely the gap<br />
between administered internal prices and<br />
international prices. A subsidy ceasefire<br />
and a progressive reduction in the PAG,<br />
initiated by a reduction in administered<br />
domestic support prices, would reduce<br />
three important forms of subsidy. They are<br />
deficiency payments, consumer transfers<br />
and export restitutions.<br />
" One simple and effective means to<br />
implement the ceasefire is ( by<br />
narrowing)..,. the gap between<br />
administered internal prices and<br />
international prices."<br />
In order to facilitate a harmonious<br />
reduction in the PAG and to provide a<br />
reasonable assurance that the burden of<br />
change is being appropriately shared, it<br />
would be useful if domestic policies could<br />
be reformed against the background of an<br />
accepted set of general principles.<br />
The OECD has been working on a<br />
Ministerial Mandate on Agricultural Trade<br />
for some four years. The Organisation has<br />
accumulated a comprehensive picture of<br />
the agricultural policies in all leading<br />
member countries, including the<br />
quantification of the net subsidy<br />
equivalent of the various measures<br />
deployed. The OCD is therefore well<br />
placed to develop a set of guiding<br />
principles and to monitor farm policy<br />
reform. Action Already in Train<br />
The Australian proposal has been<br />
developed in full knowledge of moves<br />
towards reform in Japan, the US and the<br />
EC. The coming months, however,<br />
provide the opportunity for greater, coordinated<br />
progress.<br />
" 1changes already in train. will<br />
not make a sufficient contribution<br />
Recent EC moves include modification to<br />
the grain regime, agreements to reduce<br />
dairy supplies and to change the beef<br />
intervention system, and a slowdown in<br />
the rate of administered price increases. However, changes already in train,<br />
important as they are, will not make a<br />
sufficient contribution to the resolution of<br />
EC budget problems and the international<br />
agricultural crisis.<br />
In Japan, the Agricultural Policy Review<br />
Council has recently enunciated new<br />
guidelines for the administration of farm<br />
policy. These include an enhanced role<br />
for international market prices in<br />
determining internal prices. Price<br />
increases have been constrained in<br />
recent years, with the pivotal rice price<br />
having been frozen in 1986-87.<br />
Nevertheless the gap between Japan's<br />
internal prices and world prices remains<br />
very large.<br />
" it is important that national<br />
proposals and decisions add<br />
progressively to. constructive<br />
change."<br />
In the United States, the President has<br />
recently advanced proposals for<br />
substantial reform, including cuts in target<br />
prices. The attitude of the US Congress to<br />
these proposals will undoubtedly be<br />
influenced by the EC price decisions.<br />
If genuine progress is to be made in 1987,<br />
it is important that these national<br />
proposals and decisions add<br />
progressively to the creation of an<br />
international environment conducive to<br />
constructive change. The sequence of<br />
international meetings already discussed<br />
provides an opportunity to capitalise on<br />
that environment, to develop an accord on<br />
agricultural policy and trade reform and to<br />
propel progress in the critically important<br />
Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade<br />
Negotiatirins. " The OECD is well placed to<br />
develop a set of guiding principles<br />
and to monitor farm policy reform."<br />
The plan described below requires<br />
simultaneous decisions from a number of<br />
leading countries in order to spread the<br />
burden of adjustment. This initiative is<br />
intended to be catalytic. It attempts to<br />
point out a path leading to continuing<br />
progress. To achieve progress, clear<br />
leadership from the US, the EC and Japan<br />
is vital. Without hard decisions and strong<br />
leadership the problems associated wfth<br />
the world agricultural crisis will deepen.<br />
The proposal is advanced by Australia as<br />
a contribution to resolving the crisis in<br />
world agriculture. The Australian<br />
Government recognises that others may<br />
wish to advance alternative proposals.<br />
Australia is willing to participate in<br />
discussions which attempt resolution of<br />
the problem from other perspectives.<br />
Nevertheless the proposal now advanced<br />
provides a basis for resolution of the<br />
problem. Australia commends it to other<br />
nations for evaluation. Chart 10: Price adjustment gap: sugar<br />

EC A J 1\ </p>
<p>Elements of the Proposal<br />
1 A commitment to halt subsidy<br />
escalation and freeze and<br />
progressively reduce the gap between<br />
administered internal prices and<br />
international market prices for farm<br />
products.<br />
Such a commitment would be consistent<br />
with the intent of the Uruguay Declaration.<br />
Australia proposes such a commitment be<br />
advanced by agriculture and trade<br />
Ministers at an early opportunity.<br />
2. An early reduction in internal<br />
administered producer prices for<br />
1987-88. The Seven Economic Summi . t<br />
Countries should provide the<br />
leadership.<br />
Prices could, for example, be reduced by<br />
per cent for all commodities where the<br />
gap between internal adlministeredl prices<br />
and international prices is greater than 30<br />
per cent. Such a proposal could be<br />
implemented by the US, the EC and<br />
Japan in forthcoming price reviews and<br />
budget processes and by other countries<br />
at similarly appropriate opportunities. A<br />
commitment along these lines could be<br />
affirmed at the Economic Summit in<br />
Venice, along with a commitment for<br />
further reductions until the gap narrows<br />
substantially. 3. The narrowing of the price gap be<br />
expedited by interim measures aimed<br />
at containing supplies and<br />
quarantining stockpiles in those<br />
countries where internal administered<br />
prices remain significantly higher than<br />
international prices.<br />
Surplus stocks have generally been<br />
accumulated in those exporting countries<br />
where the levels ot farm price subsidies<br />
and other market-related assistance are at<br />
the highest levels. Consequently these<br />
countries are themselves primarily<br />
responsible for them and should adopt<br />
measures to contain and quarantine them.<br />
Progress in restoring international balance<br />
in agricultural markets would be disrupted<br />
if there were fears that surpluses might be<br />
released in an undisciplined manner onto<br />
world markets.<br />
4. Farm income support measures be<br />
separated, wherever possible, from<br />
producer prices for farm output.<br />
In order to facilitate the reform of<br />
administered prices, farm adjustment<br />
measures, social welfare assistance and<br />
direct income support policies should be<br />
further developed in those countries<br />
where large PAGs exist. 5. The development of an accepted set of<br />
principles to liberalise world<br />
agricultural trade through reform of<br />
domestic agricultural policies by<br />
national governments.<br />
Such a set of principles would assure<br />
individual nations that their actions are<br />
part of a wider movement towards reform.<br />
The OECD is well placed to develop and<br />
advance such a set of principles. They<br />
could be considered by the Ministerial<br />
Council Meeting in May and endorsed by<br />
the Economic Summit in Venice in June.<br />
6. An accord on international agricultural<br />
reform be hgreed at the Economic<br />
Summit in Venice in June.<br />
Last year's Economic Summit Declaration<br />
marked a turning point in international<br />
attitudes to the agricultural crisis. This was<br />
reinforced by the GATT Uruguay Round<br />
Declaration. The 1987 Economic Summit<br />
provides a further opportunity to broaden<br />
the commitment to international<br />
agricultural reform encompassing the<br />
above principles and concepts.<br />
7. Negotiations on agriculture within the<br />
Uruguay Round of: effective<br />
disciplines on the operation of direct<br />
and indirect agricultural subsidies and<br />
price support programs,-and<br />
increased market access.<br />
Expeditious strengthening of the GATT<br />
rules and disciplines in relation to<br />
agriculture is critical if the momentum<br />
towards reform is to lead to permanent<br />
improvements in the operation of<br />
international agricultural markets. </p>
<p>U U<br />
Elements of the Proposal<br />
A commitment to halt subsidy escalation and freeze and<br />
progessively reduce the gap between administered internal<br />
prices and international market prices for farm products.<br />
2. An early reduction in internal administered producer prices<br />
for 1987-88. The Seven Economic Summit Countries<br />
should provide the leadership.<br />
3H The narrowing of the price gap be expedited by interim<br />
Smeasures aimed at containing supplies and quarantining<br />
stockpiles in those countries where internal administered<br />
prices remain significantly higher than international prices.<br />
4. Farm income support measures be separated, wherever<br />
possible, from producer prices for farm output.<br />
The development of an accepted set of principles to<br />
liberalise world agricultural trade through reform of<br />
domestic agricultural policies by national governments.<br />
An accord on international agricultural reform be agreed at<br />
the Economic Summit in Venice in June.<br />
