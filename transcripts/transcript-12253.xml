    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia strongly supports the decision by the Papua New Guinea Government to embark on a thorough programme to rebuild the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF).</p>
<p>This reform will consolidate national defence capabilities, recognise the contribution PNGDF members make to the community and strengthen the contribution they can make in future to an independent and prosperous Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>A professional defence force, loyal to the government of the day and committed to serving the nation, is a key pillar of any democratic society.</p>
<p>The rebuilding program will restore the PNGDF’s capacity to maintain national security, working within a sustainable budget and drawing upon appropriate staffing. Along with Prime Minister Morauta, I commend the commitment of Defence Minister Genia and Commander Ilau to successfully implementing this “home grown” plan.</p>
<p>I am pleased that we have been able to provide $20 million to help implement the rebuilding programme and assist the PNGDF in moving to a more compact and affordable configuration which appropriately recognises professional service. Australia stands ready to consider further assistance as the programme proceeds.</p>
<p>Sir Mekere Morauta is to be congratulated on his leadership in tackling this important and challenging task. It fits well within his government’s programme of practical measures to strengthen Papua New Guinea’s economy, to encourage development and build a confident and robust society for the future. Australia is a supportive partner in this endeavour.</p>
