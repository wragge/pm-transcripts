    <content><![CDATA[<p>
The government and people of Australia unreservedly condemn the bombing at the New Delhi High Court on 7 September, which has killed at least nine people and injured many more. </p>
<p>This act of senseless violence, directed at one of the institutions of government, appears to have been planned to cause a high number of casualties among the general public. </p>
<p>We extend our sympathy and concern to the government and people of India at this time. Our thoughts are with the families of the innocent people who have been killed, and with those injured by the blast. </p>
<p>The Indian government and people have Australia's full support as they continue to combat terrorism.   </p>
