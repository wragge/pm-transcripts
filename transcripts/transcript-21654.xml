    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia faces a great challenge to better manage our scarce water resources now and into the future.  By acting together, nationally and locally, we can improve the management of our water resources to deliver on-the-ground results that meet the needs of our rural and urban communities, our industries and our environment.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce on World Water Day the first seven projects to receive Australian Community Water Grants.</p>
<p>Under the $200 million Australian Community Water Grants programme, community organisations will be provided with grants for on-the-ground work to increase water use efficiency, improve river or groundwater health or improve community education on water saving.</p>
<p> Together the seven community projects I am announcing today will demonstrate innovative approaches to water conservation and recycling across the country, save at least 7.8 megalitres of water each year and help rehabilitate important river bank environments.</p>
<p> I congratulate the community groups who are implementing these projects for their commitment to finding solutions to their own, local challenges.  Details of the seven projects are attached.</p>
<p>The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon Ian Campbell, and the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator the Hon Ian Macdonald, will be providing the details of a further twenty community projects around Australia which will bring Community Water Grants under this demonstration stage of the programme to over $1 million.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce that the first meeting of the National Water Commission is taking place today.</p>
<p> The newly appointed Chairman and Commissioners of National Water Commission will play a key role in driving water reform at the national level, in assisting with the implementation of the historic National Water Initiative and in providing advice to the Government on the $2 billion Australian Water Fund.</p>
<p> COMMUNITY WATER GRANTS PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS</p>
<p>Nimmitabel Water Supply Efficiency and Reuse Program, NSW $45,455  (+ GST)  Proponent: Cooma-Monaro Council, NSW  This project will ensure that the town of Nimmitabel (population 250) will be able to meet domestic needs without carting water from Cooma. This community wide project is expected to achieve a 24% reduction in current water use -  a saving equivalent to more than 100 semitrailer tanker loads or 4,120,000 litres of water per year.  The savings will be achieved by providing an effluent reuse system at the town's wastewater facility;  water tank connections to public facilities;  a water audit of  water use in households; subsidising the installation of rainwater tanks on residences, and retrofit of dual flush toilets and water efficient shower roses.</p>
<p> Bridge to Bridge: Bremer River Community and Business Partnerships, Ipswich,Qld $31,872 (+ GST)  Proponent: Greening Australia Queensland Inc  This project will revegetate, rehabilitate and protect approximately 10ha of riparian zone along the Bremer River.</p>
<p>Abbotsford Convent Foundation Storm Water Recycling Community Project, VIC $40,591 (+ GST)  Proponent: Abbotsford Convent Foundation, VIC  This project will collect rainwater from the roofs of the heritage buildings in the Abbotsford Convent Precinct, in inner urban Melbourne. Water will be directed to five rainwater tanks to be used to irrigate the heritage gardens. The expected water saving of 2,250,000L of water per annum is equivalent to the average annual water use of 18 household gardens.</p>
<p> Recycling of Town and Farm Effluent for Reed Irrigation, Roseworthy, SA $45,455 (+ GST)  Proponent: The University of Adelaide, SA  This project will demonstrate an alternative re-use system, whereby treated effluent from existing evaporation ponds will be used to irrigate an existing stand of Arundo donax (Giant Reed). This reed has the potential to be harvested for paper pulp,  and can possibly produce over 20 times the annual yield compared to woodlots.</p>
<p> InnovativeWatertable Recharge and Recyling, WA  $45,455 (+ GST)  Proponent: Beachlands Primary School, Geraldton WA  This project will save water that has previously been lost to evaporation.  Each day fog and dew from moist ocean breezes will be caught in innovative "dew and fog traps", and along with rainfall, will infiltrate porous pavers, swales and garden-beds to recharge the watertable.</p>
<p> The freshwater from the watertable will be recycled via the school's ten bores and used to irrigate the school oval.  In addition, high water using trees will be removed and replaced with native species.</p>
<p> Alpurrurulam Water Project, NT $45,354 (+ GST)  Proponent: Alpurrurulam Community Government Council, NT  Water supplies are limited for this remote community approximately 700km north east from Alice Springs.  This project will install rainwater tanks on community buildings for drinking water; a greywater re-use system to provide irrigation for shade trees, gardens and fruit trees; and use treated sewerage water to irrigate a trial cash-crop woodlot using underground soakers.  This project will be a case study for conserving and making best use of limited water resources in arid areas.</p>
<p>Woodbridge Water Conservation Project, TAS $35,810 (+ GST)  Proponent: Woodbridge District High School, TAS  This project will involve conducting a water audit and implementing a water conservation plan for the school. This includes installation of 10 waterless urinals, 9 water saving toilets, water saving taps and the establishment of water friendly demonstration gardens.  Creation of an eco-carpark with biofilters to remove litter and sediments will lead to a 60% improvement in water quality discharged to a nearby wetland.  The implementation of these projects is expected to save 1,500,000 litres of water per annum.</p>
