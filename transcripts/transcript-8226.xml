PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SEGMENT, FOREIGN<br />
CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION LUNCHEON, HILTON HOTEL,<br />
SYDNEY 10 DECEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I ask you to expand on your thoughts<br />
about APEC? APEC was formed as a group to encourage free<br />
international trade. It doesn't appear to have had<br />
enormous success in this area. What can it do in the<br />
next few weeks to encourage the current trade<br />
negotiations? And if these are not successful, how could<br />
APEC change in your view to be more suitable as an<br />
organisation Australia to promote its interests?<br />
PM: I don't think APEC as such next few weeks, to<br />
take your term, can do very much. The individual members<br />
of APEC I hope will be in their various ways trying to<br />
put pressure, particularly upon the Europeans, to come to<br />
their senses. I was asked a similar question in the<br />
Parliament the other day by Mr Sinclair, the Member for<br />
New England a very sensible question. He asked what<br />
may happen in a worst case scenario situation. I<br />
reminded Mr Sinclair then that when I had moved, or had<br />
begun to move to the establishment of APEC in January of<br />
last year in Seoul, I had around that time indicated that<br />
in a worst case scenario basis we may have to ask<br />
ourselves the question of whether APEC could in fact<br />
assume some new form. I said that in the context that we<br />
in Australia and those looking to the creation of APEC<br />
were absolutely committed to doing everything we could to<br />
try and create: a freed-up international trading system.<br />
And we of course have been true to that. APEC has been<br />
remarkably successful in a very quick time in moving to<br />
try and create a framework for doing those things which<br />
it is appropriate to do within that hoped for new<br />
international system. But I take this opportunity of<br />
saying again that if against all our best aspirations,<br />
against all our best endeavours that we take both<br />
individually and as head of the Cairns Group, that the<br />
Uruguay Round breaks down, then Australia will have to<br />
reassess its position. If we then get a picture of the<br />
world breaking down into increasingly protectionist blocs<br />
with East Europe, with Europe there, the European<br />
Community and with the United States and Canada, and<br />
Canada and the United States now working with Mexico to<br />
enlarge that,, then we'll have to ask ourselves whether in<br />
fact those nations comprising APEC may not have to move </p>
<p>to some sort of similar bloc. Obviously we in Australia<br />
would, in those circumstances be prepared to look at<br />
that. We would have to look at the question of some<br />
possible association with the United States, Canada and<br />
Mexico. But let me emphasise, so there can be no<br />
possibility of misrepresentation, that that, from my<br />
point of view and the point of view of my Government, is,<br />
as I put it, the worst case scenario exercise. Because<br />
there is no doubt that the world will pay a very very<br />
heavy price if we slip into that sort of economic<br />
autarky. As I said in a speech I gave at Davos now<br />
several years ago where I directly addressed this issue.<br />
If history teaches us anything it teaches us that where<br />
nations are not able to have rational and mutually<br />
advantageous economic inter-reactions, where they have<br />
relapsed into that sort of economic autarky, political<br />
conflict has not been far behind. There is no reason to<br />
assume that history would be any different in these<br />
circumstances. JOURNALIST: A follow-up question Mr Hawke if I may.<br />
Have you or the Australian Government or any members of<br />
APEC had any talks, formal or informal, about what APEC<br />
might become if the GATT talks completely break down?<br />
PM: There've been no formal talks. I would have no<br />
doubt that on some occasions officials and perhaps<br />
Ministers may have addressed the issue, but there has<br />
been nothing formal on the agenda. Nor should there have<br />
been at this stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: According to an opinion poll like 74% of<br />
French people said that they were happy to subsidise<br />
three million farmers if it meant maintaining their rural<br />
way of life, French political other<br />
international political susceptible to pressure.<br />
What can Australia and other Cairns Group countries do to<br />
influence the GATT negotiations and get a better deal?<br />
PM: Let me go to the poll first. I'm not aware of it<br />
but one of the truths of politics is that, generally<br />
speaking if you let me prepare the question I will<br />
guarantee you the answer. I would like to have seen the<br />
way in which that particular question was framed. The<br />
statistics should be put in mind first of all, from which<br />
to answer this question. If you take Europe and the<br />
United States together and throw in Japan, something like<br />
$ 200 billion a year are spent in transfers to farmers by<br />
either pricing or, and-or the taxing mechanism. This is<br />
an absurdity which cost the 93 or 94% of the communities<br />
in question, cost them dearly. Cost them dearly in the<br />
sense that it increases their cost and price structure in<br />
a quite stupid way. The competitive position of their<br />
countries is adversely affected by the inflated cost in<br />
price structure associated with these transfers. It is<br />
also inefficient in terms of delivering assistance to<br />
those in need. If you are trying to justify these<br />
policies in terms of looking after the farmers most in </p>
<p>need then of course it is self-contradictory because the<br />
greatest beneficiaries of these systems are the largest<br />
most successful farmers. So it has no good sense either<br />
in terms of economic competitive terms or in social<br />
transfer terms. It fails on both those grounds. As far<br />
as we are co ncerned we have tried in the years leading up<br />
to the present time to convey to the 94% the absurdity to<br />
which they are parties. For instance when I was in<br />
Germany last year I had a very interesting meeting with<br />
the leader of Germany and they were at one in a) their<br />
assessment of the economic insanity of the CAP, b) of the<br />
absurdity of the great majority of their people<br />
tolerating it and c) on the need for change. We have<br />
encouraged them to try and educate their people. Indeed<br />
it is the case that the banks in Germany for instance<br />
have taken out advertisements I understand in the German<br />
press, the German media to convey the economic insanity<br />
of what they are about. There is no doubt that the<br />
political leaders understand the economics of what I'm<br />
saying. I can't in a gathering like this betray the<br />
confidences of head to head diplomacy and discussion.<br />
But allow me -to say this, that in my discussions with<br />
important European leaders they have been relatively<br />
frank in saying Bob you don't really need to waste your<br />
time in persuading me about the economics of it but I've<br />
got some farmers down there pretty strategically placed<br />
in certain areas and I'm a bit worried about them. Now<br />
what I say to them is what I've had to say in the United<br />
States when talking about the same issue, and when I've<br />
been talking 1to the United States about their absurdity<br />
and not having the courage to face up the budgetary<br />
issues. In the end leadership is about leading and<br />
making hard decisions and educating your population about<br />
where relative good sense lies. It is the case that<br />
whether you talk about France or Germany, the Germans and<br />
the French would be better of f as would the Americans if<br />
in fact they followed rational economic policies in this<br />
regard. Their people would get their food cheaper, they<br />
would have a lower cost and price structure, their<br />
employment levels would be higher. It is just my hope<br />
that in the period now that only be Australia and the<br />
Cairns Group, it will be others trying to put the<br />
pressure of good common sense upon our friends in Europe.<br />
And in the end I've always taken the view that morality<br />
is a pretty poor horse to be riding in politics. Not<br />
that you shouldn't have moral positions. But morality,<br />
as I've said before at a number of gatherings, doesn't<br />
have a great track record of achievement when it comes to<br />
national political decisions. But enlightened selfinterest<br />
is a more capable steed and that enlightened<br />
self-interest should be mounted and ridden hard so that<br />
the French and the Germans and the Americans understand<br />
that the interests of all their people are going to be<br />
better served as well as creating a more stable,<br />
prosperous and secure world, if they get rid of this<br />
nonsensical insane proposition that you pervert policies<br />
and proper rational policies to try and look after three<br />
or four or five per cent of your farmers. And as I said </p>
<p>in the speech, one thing that sticks in my craw more than<br />
anything else is to witness these representatives of<br />
these countries either bilaterally of as they sit<br />
pompously in the of the World Bank, or the<br />
International Monetary Fund looking into the eyes of<br />
these developing countries and saying to them, rightly I<br />
might say, look, you must be economically rational, you<br />
must take hard decisions. We know it's going to be<br />
politically difficult for you, you might even lose<br />
office. They tell them that. They know all the jargon.<br />
They've got it right in preaching to the developing<br />
countries about what they must do to give effect to<br />
rational economic policies and principles if they are<br />
going to really look after the interests of their<br />
country. But when the test comes to them they fail<br />
abysmally. That's massive hypocrisy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you do it? Would you do it?<br />
PM: I've done it here. I've made tough decisions here.<br />
I mean I don't go to the United States and preach to them<br />
about balancing your budget and saying it's difficult.<br />
I've done it and from a position of strength I say have<br />
the guts to do what we've done.<br />
JOURNALIST: You raised interest rates several times<br />
during this year. I'd like to know if you are happy with<br />
the current level of interest rates or whether you would<br />
see another increase say over the next three months<br />
because unemployment is rising above the budget<br />
expectations. And the second part of that question is<br />
related to trade. Australian manufacturers and<br />
farmers could sell more overseas if the dollar was lower.<br />
Do you foresee, are you happy with the current level of<br />
the Australian dollar or would you like to see it lower?<br />
PM: You wouldn't think that such a dynamite loaded<br />
question could come from such an innocent package.<br />
Sweet and innocent. Bob will you yourself up for me?<br />
No, darling. Well let's get to the facts. You're right,<br />
we've had five successive reductions of interest rates<br />
since January of this year. That has been the delivery<br />
of the promise that my good friend and colleague, Paul<br />
Keating, and I have made together since the beginning of<br />
the year, that we would deliver on lower interest rates<br />
as we regarded the economic situation as being capable of<br />
delivering them. So we've done that five times. The<br />
straight answer and the non-avoiding answer to your<br />
question is that if we assess the position in the future<br />
as being consistent with and requiring a further lowering<br />
of interest rates, that's what will happen. But the<br />
guiding principle has been what is required in the<br />
overall interests of the economy. I make no prediction<br />
about if and when that next point will arise. Of course,<br />
you ' re right to say that as far as the exchange rate is<br />
concerned our exporters would very much like to see a<br />
further lowering of the exchange rate. Now there's been<br />
about a seven per cent lowering of the exchange rate in </p>
<p>the last couple of months. It got up to, on the US<br />
dollar, it got up to about 83 cents, as you know. It's<br />
come down seven per cent since then. Again what we've<br />
said and what we mean is that when we floated the dollar,<br />
we floated the dollar and that will be set by the<br />
judgement of the market as to what's the appropriate<br />
level. It would be counterproductive if I were to say,<br />
well I would like to see it at x or y. I simply say that<br />
I would expect that if events were to produce a further<br />
lowering of interest rates, and you've heard what I've<br />
had to say about that, but if they were to produce a<br />
further lowering of interest rates then all other things<br />
being equal you'd see, or expect to see, a further<br />
lowering of the exchange rate. But I can't responsibly<br />
add anything more to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you give us your assessment of what<br />
you think will happen if Saddam Hussein does not withdraw<br />
his troops from Kuwait when the January 15 deadline<br />
arrives?<br />
PM: Peter, that's a massively important question. The<br />
first thing to say is I don't know and neither does<br />
anyone else in the world. If I had to bet, and one of<br />
course wouldn't bet on these things, but if you had to<br />
bet, my belief still is that the Gulf crisis will be<br />
settled without war. If that happens, as I profoundly<br />
hope is the case, then it will happen because the world<br />
has shown its determination that aggression will not go<br />
rewarded and that Iraq and its leadership will have been<br />
informed in the strongest possible way that the<br />
aggression and annexation by it of Kuwait will not be<br />
tolerated. So that's my belief on balance that Saddam<br />
Hussein will come to the conclusion that it would<br />
literally be insane for him not to meet the requirements<br />
of the international community. Let me just make a<br />
couple of points about that so that there can't be any<br />
misunderstanding of my position and the Australian<br />
Government's position. We are saying that it is<br />
absolutely essential that Iraq meets the three<br />
requirements, that is; total withdrawal, release of all<br />
hostages and the return of the status quo within Kuwait.<br />
I've made it clear from the very beginning that this does<br />
not mean that if Iraq believes that it has some<br />
legitimate cause of grievance against Kuwait, be it<br />
territorial or otherwise, that it should not have the<br />
right to pursue those issues peacefully within the<br />
framework and the institutions of the international<br />
community. Indeed, it is our position that if Saddam<br />
Hussein meets those requirements then every facilitation<br />
should be put in the way of allowing a consideration of<br />
any such grievances that they may say they have. Now,<br />
going finally to the question of what happens if against<br />
my on-balance expectations he doesn't withdraw then it is<br />
obviously, in those circumstances, inevitable that force<br />
will be used by the international community to bring<br />
about the satisfaction of those three conditions. My<br />
Government has made, and I'm pleased to see with the </p>
<p>clear support of the Australian people, has made the<br />
decision that if that is necessary Australia will be part<br />
of it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Minister Evans has mentioned a few times<br />
that he would like to see a security arrangement in this<br />
region similar to that of the CSC in Europe. What are<br />
your thoughts on that and would you like to expand on it?<br />
PM: Yes, what Gareth Evans has said and let it be<br />
understood that we're not trying to push this ahead of<br />
what will come naturally by the events but we would<br />
like to see reflected in the Asia-Pacific region the<br />
degree of detente that has occurred in Europe. That has<br />
occurred in Europe as a result of a combination of<br />
factors. Of course, firstly, just the fact of the<br />
reduction in tension between the two superpowers, the<br />
United States and the Soviet Union. Secondly, because of<br />
specific agreements that have been met in regard to the<br />
reduction of classes of missiles and the reduction of<br />
conventional forces in Europe. But as well as that<br />
you've also had, now, in an increasingly important sense<br />
underpinning those important facts, you've had the<br />
influence of the Conference in Security and Cooperation<br />
in Europe which has brought together all the countries of<br />
the region. Now, we in the Asia-Pacific area have not<br />
had the benefit of all those structural arrangements. In<br />
a sense, we in this region have been very much a residual<br />
beneficiary of the fundamental changes that have been<br />
taking place between the two superpowers. What Gareth is<br />
talking about in this way is saying, well the time may<br />
well be coming when we, to maximise the opportunity in<br />
our region of the reduction in tensions that Europe is<br />
enjoying, that we may need to look at some formalised<br />
arrangement which will give impetus to what essentially,<br />
as I say until now has been a residual benefit that we've<br />
derived from what's happening in Europe. Now, of course,<br />
we've got to understand that you can't necessarily be<br />
rushing into these things because we, in this region,<br />
have unresolved issues which distinguish the region from<br />
Europe. For instance, you have North and South Korea<br />
and, for instance, you have the unresolved issue between<br />
the Soviet Union and Japan in regard to the four islands.<br />
Now those two issues create circumstances which<br />
differentiate us from Europe to some extent and which<br />
raise concerns as to whether yet is the time in which we<br />
can move to that sort of formalised arrangement. As well<br />
as that, of course, we still have the unresolved issue of<br />
peace in Cambodia although here I speak, you know, with<br />
great pride as to the role of what we've been doing and<br />
very much with a sense of gratification of the enormous<br />
contribution of Foreign Minister Alitas, from your<br />
country. We've got grounds for hope there. But we've<br />
still got that unresolved issue and, of course, over all<br />
that we've still got the uncertainties that flow from the<br />
events of 12 months ago in Tienanmen Square. So when you<br />
take account of all those issues you can see that we<br />
can't quite as easily and as readily move in a structural </p>
<p>sense as they have in Europe but hopefully the time will<br />
come in the not too distant future when we can.<br />
JOURNALIST: You mentioned a few minutes ago your good<br />
friend Paul Keating. What do you feel about his comments<br />
on Australia's lack of leadership and are you concerned<br />
about any sort of leadership challenge by your Treasurer?<br />
PM: I've got no comment about the first and the answer<br />
to the second, no. As I said at a doorstop early before,<br />
I'm looking forward to having a very fulsome discussion<br />
with Paul later on today. I hope he's looking forward to<br />
it as much as I am.<br />
JOURNALIST: If I could ask a double-barrelled one about<br />
the Gulf, follow-up of Peter O'Loughlin's question.<br />
Firstly, do you share the concerns that seem to be<br />
arising in Britain and France, particularly the proposed<br />
US-Iraq talks in some way represent a weakening of<br />
American resolve in response to their own domestic<br />
pressures. Secondly, if the worst happens and still<br />
in Kuwait on the 15th of January, what is your<br />
understanding of the fundamental political decisionmaking<br />
process by the allies and most specifically<br />
will Australia be consulted in any way before any guns<br />
start firing?<br />
PM: In regard to the first, no, I don't share that<br />
concern. I think there are two points that need to be<br />
made. Obviously George Bush wanted to reassure not only<br />
his domestic constituency but the world constituency of<br />
what is, I believe, the truth. That is that he doesn't<br />
want war. And. I say that on the basis of personal<br />
conversations with him. I'm convinced that George Bush<br />
would profoundly prefer that this matter be resolved<br />
peacefully. So he wanted to go as far as he reasonably<br />
could for domestic and international constituency reasons<br />
to make that perfectly clear. Those who think there are<br />
some other reasons, I think, are wrong. And secondly, as<br />
well as wanting to reassure his constituency, I mean the<br />
second point flows from it and that is that it would be<br />
his hope that out of the Foreign Minister of Iraq coming<br />
to Washington and Baker going to Baghdad that there would<br />
be left absolutely no chance of misunderstanding on the<br />
part of the leadership of Iraq of the firm commitments of<br />
not merely the United States but of virtually the rest of<br />
the world to proceed under 678 if that became necessary.<br />
So I think he : moved with good reason and wisely and<br />
hopefully in a way which will produce the result that we<br />
all want. As to the second part of your question, Don, I<br />
obviously don't want to go into the details of that other<br />
than to make this fairly obvious point; that because<br />
Australia's ships will now be moving up into the of<br />
the Gulf and will be exercising with the ships of the<br />
United States as well as with those of Canada and<br />
Britain, in the very nature of events because we are<br />
going to be part of the processes our capacity to be<br />
involved in knowledge and to therefore have some </p>
<p>opportunity of is the greater than if we had not been<br />
there, although that of course is not the reason why we<br />
moved to that point.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Cairns Group and the US on the one hand<br />
and Australia on the other, sorry, the Cairns Group and<br />
the US on the one hand and the European Community on the<br />
other are so far apart on the GATT negotiations that it's<br />
hard to see how any can be made. Do you see any<br />
areas of compromise perhaps on a longer<br />
PM: Well there are areas of compromise. Let me make it<br />
clear that while the Cairns Group and the United States<br />
have put down, as you know, the broad details of the<br />
proposals, they are not identical but they are quite<br />
similar. They are a long way from the totally<br />
unrealistic 30% proposal of the Europeans, only in regard<br />
to one leg of the troika of domestic support, of domestic<br />
access and of export subsidy and based on 1986 have<br />
virtually been more than half delivered now at any rate.<br />
So there's an enormous gap between the Cairns Group, the<br />
United States on the one hand, and Europe on the other.<br />
But I do believe there is a possibility for a compromise.<br />
We obviously want the Round to succeed and we've<br />
indicated that what's required as a first step is for the<br />
Europeans to negotiate on their offer. I mean no-one<br />
takes their offer seriously, including themselves I<br />
think. Now there is evidence that within the community<br />
there are those who would wish to see movement on their<br />
part. It's my hope still that Chancellor Kohl, now with<br />
his very substantial victory behind him from the 3rd of<br />
December, will use his undoubted influence to give the<br />
political thrust and impetus to change there. So I'm<br />
clearly saying that if the Europeans were prepared to up<br />
their offer and direct it to the three elements of<br />
domestic support, domestic access and export subsidies,<br />
which they must do, then there's a possibility of<br />
negotiating a compromise.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you were to step down tomorrow as Prime<br />
Minister of Australia-<br />
PM: I thought this was the real world we were in.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would you as your failing<br />
seven years in office. What are some things that you<br />
have not been able to achieve and the record, will<br />
you stand next election as Prime Minister?<br />
PM: The answer to the second one is yes, obviously.<br />
Well I am very disappointed that we haven't been able to<br />
get constitutional change in this country. I know I've<br />
been asked that question before. I've said that looking<br />
back the thing I would've done differently, I would've<br />
put myself more into that campaign. I think we got<br />
lulled into a false sense of security by all those polls<br />
which showed the clear majority of Australians in favour<br />
of each one of the four proposals that we put up on the </p>
<p>last occasion. In terms of satisfying the true criteria<br />
for constitutional change, that is in favour in a<br />
majority of States and in favour of the majority of<br />
Australia as a whole. I think I got, together with my<br />
colleagues, lulled into some false sense of security and<br />
certainly the picture changed very rapidly under the<br />
pernicious and totally false sense of arguments that were<br />
put by our political opponents. I still need to pinch<br />
myself to some extent to believe that the Australian<br />
people would vote against a proposition which, simply<br />
put, said that there would be entrenched into the<br />
Australian constitution a provision that if any citizen<br />
has had his or her property compulsorily acquired by any<br />
government then there would be this constitutional<br />
provision for fair compensation. I find it difficult to<br />
believe still that the majority of people voted against<br />
that proposition which is proof positive of how difficult<br />
it is to get constitutional amendments carried in this<br />
country. So that is one area of regret. I mean if I'd<br />
realised how difficult that was going to be I would've<br />
myself got myself more involved in that campaign.<br />
