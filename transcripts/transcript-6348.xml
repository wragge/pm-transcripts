EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY CHCKAGImSTDEIVR<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MIN( ISTER<br />
TO THE PACIFIC BASIN ECONOMIC COUNCI. L 16 MARCH .1984<br />
IGREATLY WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS<br />
GATHERING THAT PBEC HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER JUST A MONTH<br />
AFTER MY RETURN FROM NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA,<br />
FROM AELL BEFORE THE TIME THE LABOR GOVERNMENT TOOK<br />
OFFICE LAST MARCH, I HAVE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
OUR LOCAI0N~ IN THE WORLD'S MOST DYNAMIC REGION TO OUR<br />
OWN LONG-TERM GROWTH PROSPECTS,<br />
THE EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMY INTO<br />
THIS RAPIDLY EXPANDING REGION REQUIRES AN ACTIVE AUSTRALIAN<br />
TRADE POLICY, AND POLICIES WHICH SUPPORT DYNAMI1C INDUSTRY<br />
ADJUSTMENT AT HOME*<br />
BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE, IT REQUIRES A PRIVATE SECTOR THAT IS<br />
ALERT TO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN<br />
OUR REGION, AND EFFECTIVE IN ITS RESPONSE, </p>
<p>FOR MANY YEARS THE PACIFIC BASIN ECONOMIC COUNCIL HAS BEEN<br />
AHEAD OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY AND AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS<br />
IN ITS AWARENESS OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR REGION,<br />
AND ITS WILLINGNESS TO MAKE GOOD USE OF THEM.<br />
NOW, AS THE GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY MOVE QUICKLY TO<br />
BUILD CLOSER RELATIONS BETWEEN AUSTRALIAIIAND THE COUNTRIES<br />
OF OUR REGION, I AM CONFIDENT THAT AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS<br />
WILL FIND -ITS.; EFFORTS EVEN MORE REWARDING THAN<br />
BEFORE. ONE PARTICULARLY STRONG IMPRESSION OF MY RECENT VISIT<br />
WAS THAT THE ECONOMIC DYNAMISM OF THE REGION OWES MUCH<br />
TO REGIONAL COUNTRIESI READINESS TO ADAPT TO CHANGE,<br />
JAPAN, OF COURSE, IS THE BEST KNOWN EXAMPLE, BUT THE<br />
REPUBLIC OF KOREAo SINGAPORE AND MALAYSIA HAVE ALSO<br />
MADE AND ARE CONTINUIN( TO MAKE MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS TO<br />
I". NCREASE THEIR ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY.<br />
A SECOND KEY IMPRESSION IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE<br />
COUNTRIES HAVE DEVELOPED AN EXTERNAL ORIENTATION IN THEIR<br />
ECONOMIC POLICIES. THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT<br />
BY BEING ALERT TO THE COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES OUTSIDE<br />
THEIR BORDERS AND BY GIVING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE<br />
CONDITIONS OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS, THE COUNTRIES<br />
OF THE REGION HAVE MANAGED TO MAINTAIN LEVELS OF GROWTH AND<br />
INVESTMENT IN THEIR INDUSTRIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT HAVE<br />
BEEN POSSIBLE. </p>
<p>I AM MORE THAN EVER CONVINCED THAT, HOWEVER MUCH WE MIGHT<br />
BE LIVING IN AN AGE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WE SHOULD GIVE<br />
MORE EMPHASIS TO TRADE WITH THE COUNTRIES OF OUR REGION.<br />
THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT OUR TRADITIONAL MARKETS IN<br />
EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA ARE NO LONGER IMPORTANT;<br />
INDEED, THESE MARKETS REMAIN OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE TO US,<br />
THE REALITY, HOWEVER, IS THAT IN THE PAST TWO DECADES OUR<br />
EUROPEAN MARKETS HAVE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AND OUR<br />
MAJOR TRADING PARTNER HAS BECOME JAPAN, THE ASEAN COUNTRIES<br />
AND KOREA HAVE ALSO COME TO ASSUME VERY CONSIDERABLE<br />
IMPORTANCE IN THE OVERALL PATTERN OF AUSTRALIA'S TRADING<br />
INTERESTS. 4<br />
IN RECENT YEARS OUR FASTEST GROWING TRADE HAS BEEN WITH THE<br />
ASIAN REGION. THE OVERALL TREND IS TOWARDS SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
CLOSER AUSTRALIAN INVOLVEMENT IN REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.<br />
THESE FACTS ARE NOW RECOGNISED BY MOST AUSTRALIANS.<br />
PEOPLE IN BUSINESS SUCH AS YOURSELVES ALSO HAVE A KEEN<br />
APPRECIATION OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THESE CHANGES HAVE<br />
PRESF ', ED FOR AUSTRALIAN TRADE AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS. </p>
<p>To FULLY EXPLOIT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. REQUIRES, HOWEVER,<br />
THAT AUSTRALIANS GET MUCH CLOSER TO THE ASIAN SCENE.<br />
THERE IS NO SUBSITUTE FOR ON-THE-GROUND EXPERIENCE, FOR<br />
AUSTRALIANS CULTURALLY ATTUNED TO THE SENSITIVITIES OF THE<br />
REGION, AND BEING EXPERT IN THEIR APPRECIATION OF WHERE<br />
DEVELOPMENT TRENDS IN ASIA ARE HEADING.<br />
EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT IS THE NEED FOR AUSTRALIANS TO CONSIDER<br />
MORE CAREFULLY AND DELIBERATELY WHAT WE MUST DO AT HOME<br />
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MORE COMPETITIVE AND PROPERLY<br />
POSITIONED TO CAPITALISE ON WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND US,<br />
ESSENTIALLY THIS MEANS CONFRONTING DIRECTLY THE ISSUES<br />
INVOLVED IN LONG-TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGE.<br />
IN SUMMARY, WHAT IS NEEDED IS A MATCHING OF ASIAN<br />
OPPORTUNITY WITH AUSTRALIAN CAPACITY.<br />
FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE STAYED AT ARMS LENGTH FROM ASIA.<br />
WE HAVE BEEN CONTENT TOO OFTEN TO MOUTH RECOGNITION<br />
THAT OUR FUTURE LIES WITH ASIA WITHOUT ADDRESSING EITHER<br />
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT RECOGNITION OR THE RESPONSIBILITIES<br />
IT IMPOSES ON US. OUR APPROACH TO ASIA HAS BEEN TOO<br />
COMPArMENTALISED. </p>
<p>DURING MY RECENT TRIP To ASIA I SOUGHT TO DRAW THESE<br />
STRANDS TOGETHER* THE MAJOR THEME OF MY VISIT WAS<br />
THAT THE FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THIS COUNTRY<br />
WILL INCREASINGLY BE BOUND UP WITH THE ASIA-PACIFIC<br />
REGION. ON ONE SIDE THIS MEANT VIGOROUSLY ESTABLISHING<br />
AUSTRALIA'S CLAIM TO A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF ASIA'S<br />
GROWING MARKETS. ON THE OTHER SIDE IT MEANT CONFRONTING<br />
THE EXTENT TO WHICH AUSTRALIA WOULD, OVER THE LONGER TERM,<br />
NEED TO BEGIN RESTRUCTURING ITS ECONOMY IF IT WERE<br />
SUCCESSFULLY TO ENMESH ITSELF INTO THE DYNAMIC GROWTH<br />
OF THE REGION$<br />
AUSTRALIA S-IMPLY CANNOT ASSUME THAT IT CAN LAY CLAIM TO<br />
THE BENEFITS OF GROWTH IN THE REGION UNLESS AT THE SAME<br />
TIME IT IS PREPARED TO MAKE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO THE REGION.<br />
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR HAVING BEEN A VIGOROUS ADVOCATE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA' S TRADING CLAIMS WITHIN THE REGION.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S PRIMARY PRODUCT, RAW MATERIAL AND PROCESSED<br />
PRODUCT EXPORTS TO JAPAN, KOREA, CHINA AND THE ASEAN<br />
COUNTRIES ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS<br />
OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES AND ACCOUNT FOR A VERY LARGE<br />
PROPORTION OF AUSTRALIA'S TOTAL EXPORT INCOME, THERE<br />
IS THEREFORE A CLOSE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN<br />
AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTERESTS1 </p>
<p>DURING THE VISIT I MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT, WHATEVER<br />
EXTRANEOUS PRESSURES MIGHT BE AT WORK, AUSTRALIA SHOULD<br />
MAINTAIN' ITS POSITION IN THE JAPANESE BEEF MARKET AND<br />
BE GIVEN IMPROVED ACCESS To KOREAN MARKETS IN BEEF,<br />
GRAIN AND PROCESSED FOOD, IN EACH OF JAPAN, KOREA,<br />
CHINA AND MALAYSIA I ALSO PRESSED STRONGLY AUSTRALIA'S<br />
CLAIMS TO A VERY SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THOSE COUNTRIES'<br />
IRON ORE AND COAL IMPORT REQUIREMENTS.<br />
IN PUTTING AUSTRALIA'S CASE I PARTICULARLY EMPHASISED OUR<br />
POSITION AS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, RELIABLE SUPPLIER OF<br />
PRIMARY PRODUCTS AND RAW MATERIALS. IN DOING SO I WAS<br />
ABLE TO POINT NOT ONLY TO THE EFFICIENCY OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
PRODUCERS, bUT ALSO TO THE COMPARATIVE INDUSTRIAL PEACE<br />
WHICH HAS PREVAILED IN AUSTRALIA SINCE THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT'S ASSUMPTION OF OFFICE.<br />
INDEED THE FACT THAT THE NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES<br />
IN THE TWELVE MONTHS TO: NOVEMBER 1933 WAS THE LOWEST IN<br />
FIFTEEN YEARS WAS PARTICULARLY APPRECIATED BY LEADERS OF<br />
OF INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT IN MANY OF THE COUNTRIES VISITED.<br />
YESTERDAY, THE DECISIVE IM4PROVEMENT IN OUR INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS PERFORMANCE WAS CONFIRMED, WITH THE RELEASE OF<br />
DATA SHOWING THAT THE NUMBER OF JOBS LOST PER THOUSAND<br />
WORKERS IN 1983 WAS OVER 40 PER CENT LOWER THAN IN 1982,<br />
AND THE LOWEST IN SIXTEEN YEARS. </p>
<p>THE IMPORTANCE COUNTRIES SUCH AS JAPAN, KOREA, MALAYSIA<br />
AND CHINA ATTACHED TO THIS ASPECT REINFORCES MY<br />
VIEW THAT ADHERENCE TO THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD<br />
PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN SECURING CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE<br />
TO THE LONG-TERM QUALITY OF OUR ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS<br />
WITH THE REGION. THIS IS QUITE APART FROM THE CENTRAL<br />
ROLE IT HAS TO PLAY IN DOMESTIC ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT.<br />
THE RESPONSES TO MY PRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIAN TRADING<br />
INTERESTS WERE VERY ENCOURAGING. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT<br />
WAS THE ASSURANCE OF PRIME MIN[ STER NAKASONE THAT JAPAN<br />
WOULD NOT SOLVE ITS TRADING PROBLEMS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES<br />
AT THE EXPENSE OF AUSTRALIA-JAPAN TRADE, THIS ASSURANCE<br />
IS OF CRITICAL SIGNIFICANCE TO A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
TRADING INTERESTS. IT STANDS AS A CLEAR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<br />
OF THE ENDURING QUALIT IES OF AUSTRALIA AS A RELIABLE AND<br />
COMPETITIVE SUPPLIER AND OF THE DANGERS POSED TO ORDERLY<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADING ARRANGEMENTS BY ANY SURRENDER<br />
TO BILATERIALISMI IT IS AN ASSURANCE TO WHICH<br />
IATTACH PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE.<br />
IWOULD EXPECT IT TO FIND A POSITIVE REFLECTION IN THE<br />
APPROACH TAKEN BY BOTH AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN TO CURRENT<br />
NEGOTIATIONS ON BEEF, COAL AND IRON ORE. </p>
<p>QUITE APART FROM THE OPPORTUNITY IT PRESENTED TO PURSUE<br />
' MATTERS OF TRADITIONAL INTERESTj MY VISIT ALSO WAS AN<br />
OCCASION TO WEIGH THE SIGNIFICANCE FOR AUSTRALfiAN TRADING<br />
INTERESTS OF THE CHANGING STRUCTURES AND DEMANDS OF<br />
THE REGIONAL ECONOMIES#<br />
SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO<br />
BE MADE By AUSTRALIAN PRODUCERS IF THE MOMENTUM OF EXISTING<br />
TRADE RELATIONSHIPS IS TO BE MAINTAINED. IMPORTANTLY THE<br />
STRUCTURE OF AUSTRALIA'S TRADE WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS<br />
JAPAN WILL HAVE TO BE BROADENED NEW MARKETS WILL<br />
HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED WITH A MORE DIVERSIFIED, MORE<br />
SPECIALISED PRODUCT MIX. WITH JAPAN THIS WILL MEAN<br />
FOCUSSING PARTICULARLY ON THE OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
HER IMPORT EXPANSION SCHEME; WITH CHINA IT WILL MEAN<br />
CAREFUL EFFORT TO EXPAND TWO-WAY TRADE WITHIN THE ACTION<br />
PLAN!' WITH KOREA AND THE ASEAN COUNTRIES IT WILL MEAN<br />
CONTINUED, CLOSE, ON-THE-SPOT'MONITORING OF THE POSSIBILITIES<br />
OPENING UP ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS@<br />
MY VISITS To TOKYO AND OSAKA REINFORCED MY VIEW THAT JAPAN<br />
WILL REMAIN A KEY COUNTRY IN AUSTRALIA ' S CALCULATIONS. IT<br />
IS TRUE THAT THE GROWTH IN OUR EXPORTS OF MINERALS TO<br />
JAPAN WILL NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THAT ACHIEVED IN EARLIER<br />
YEARS, BUT THIS DOES NOT GAINSAY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE<br />
JAPANESE MARKET IN ABSOLUTE TERMS; OUR TRADE WITH JAPAN<br />
IS STILL EQUAL TO THAT OF OUR NEXT FIVE T. RAD. ING PARTNERS<br />
COMBINED. </p>
<p>JAPAN IS A LARGE, AFFLUENT AND ATTRACTIVE MARKET, AS YOU<br />
WOULD ALL KNOW, HOWEVER, IT IS A SPECIALISED MARKET WITH<br />
PROBLEMS OF PENETRATION QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN OTHER<br />
AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS MARKETS,<br />
RECOGNISING THIS FACT I WAS ABLE IN MY DISCUSSIONS IN JAPAN<br />
TO ACHIEVE TWO SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS TO TAKE FULL<br />
ADVANTAGE OF JAPAN'S IMPORT EXPANSION SCHEME, FIRST, THIS<br />
YEAR WE WILL SEND A HIGH LEVEL TRADE MISSION TO JAPAN TO<br />
EXAMINE NEW EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES, SECOND, THE JAPANESE<br />
FOR THEIR PART HAVE ALSO AGREED TO SEND A MAJOR TRADE<br />
MISSION TO AUSTRALIA TO HELP IDENTIFY WHICH AUSTRALIAN<br />
PRODUCTS MIGHT BE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO JAPAN.<br />
I SHOULD EXPECT ALL OF YOU<br />
HERE TO RESPOND VERY POSITIVELY TO ANY SUCH DEMONSTRATION<br />
OF JAPANESE INTEREST.<br />
ANOTHER PARTICULARLY VALUABLE FEATURE OF MY VISIT TO JAPAN<br />
WAS THE OPPORTUNITY IT PROVIDED TO CONSIDER CLOSELY JAPANESE<br />
EXPERIENCE IN INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING, JAPAN HAS EVOLVED<br />
HABITS OF CONSULTATION AND DOMESTIC INTERACTION IN THE<br />
FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES THAT HAVE<br />
OBVIOUSLY BEEN AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HER COMPARATIVE<br />
SUCCESS IN DEALING WITH TE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
STRUCTURAL CHANGE,<br />
I_ </p>
<p>THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, LIKE JAPAN, HAS UNDERGONE<br />
CONSIDERABLE STRUCTURAL CHANGE, INCLUDING A HUGE<br />
CONTRACTION OF MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT OVER THE PAST DECADE$<br />
REGRETTABLY IN THE PAST CHANGE HAS OCCURRED WITHOUT<br />
GOVERNMENTS BEING INVOLVED CONSTRUCTIVELY IN ITS<br />
MANAGEMENTj OR THE COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESSES<br />
OF CHANGE. I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES AUSTRALIANS MUST COME<br />
TO. TERMS WITH THE CONTINUING CHANGE IN OUR INDUSTRY<br />
STRUCTURES. THE PARTICULAR CHALLENGE WE ALL FACE IS TO<br />
MANAGE THE FUTURE RATHER THAN MERELY REACT WHEN IT IS UPON US,<br />
IT IS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW MOVING<br />
TO DEVELOP ARRANGEMENTS FOR CONSULTATION, INFORMATION<br />
SHARING, AND LONG-TERM PLANNING ON . THESE ISSUES,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK DEFINING MORE<br />
PRECISELY THE CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH INDUSTRIAL DgyLOPMENT<br />
WILL OCCUR. MORE SPECIFICALLY, AND CONSISTENT WITH THE<br />
NOW WIDELY ACCEPTED UNDERSTANDING THAT CHANGE MUST OCCUR<br />
IF GROWTH IS TO ENSUE, WE AIM TO DEVELOP AND APPLY POLICY<br />
IN A WAY WHICH FACILITATES CHANGE WHILE MINIMISING THE<br />
HARDSHIP ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH CHANGE,<br />
SENATOR BUTTON'S CO-ORDINATION OF THE WORK OF A RANGE OF<br />
MINISTERS IN AREAS RELEVANT TO STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE<br />
ECONOMY IS A REFLECTION OF THE DELIBERATENESS WITH WHICH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT IS ADDRESSING THE POLICY ISSUES-INVOLVED. </p>
<p>11.<br />
SIMILARLY EPAC'S CALL FOR THE FORMULATION OF AN ACTIVE<br />
INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY REFLECTS BROADER COMMUNITY<br />
INTEREST IN ADDRESSING THESE MATTERS SYSTEMATICALLY,<br />
EPAC HAS SAID THAT SUCH A STRATEGY SHOULD:<br />
PROVIDE ENCOURAGEMENT AND OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAN<br />
AND INVEST BY INDUSTRIES AND ENTERPRISES INVOLVED<br />
IN EXPANSION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTION;<br />
IMPROVE AND PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENTLY THE<br />
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT;<br />
GIVE INDUSTRY AND ITS WORKERS THE OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO ADJUST TO CHANGE WITHIN STABLE PROGRAMS THAT<br />
ARE KNOWN IN ADVANCE OF THEIR APPLICATION; AND<br />
REDUCE ARTIFICIAL AND BUREAUCRATIC REGULATION THAT<br />
ENCOURAGES NEITHER ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY NOR SOCIAL<br />
EQUITY.<br />
WITHIN A MONTH OF COMING TO OFFICE THE GOVERNMENT MOVED<br />
DECISIVELY TO IMPLEMENT SUCH AN APPROACH IN THE STEEL<br />
INDUSTRY, WITH THE WELL-KNOWN FAVOURABLE RESULTS FOR<br />
SECURITY OF EMPLOYMENT AND INVESTMENT. </p>
<p>it<br />
OBVIOUSLY IT IS STILL EARLY DAYS AND MUCH WORK REMAINS TO<br />
BE DONE, THE CHANGES INVOLVED WILL ONLY BE GRADUALLY<br />
IMPLEMENTED INDEED WHAT IS INVOLVED IS OF ITS NATURE<br />
A LON 7-TERM EXERCISE. BUT THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF A POSITIVE<br />
AND CONSTRUCTIVE POLICY APPROACH ARE NOW COMING INTO PLACE.<br />
INDIVIDUAL FIRMS ' MUST IN THE END TAKE THE CRUCIAL DECISIONS<br />
UPON WHICH AUp'RALIA'S COMPETITIVE EDGE WILL ULTIMATELY<br />
HINGE, I i LOOK TO ALL OF YOU, AS LEADERS OF AUSTRALIA'S BUSINESS<br />
AND INDUSTRY, TO RECOGNISE THE CHALLENGE AND TO RISE TO<br />
THE OPPORTUNITIES IT PRESENTS,<br />
MR CHAIRMAN,<br />
IWILL NOW COMMENT BRIEFLY ON THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY VISITS<br />
TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITHIN THE REGION.<br />
IN SOUTH KOREA THERE WAS PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT THE TRADE<br />
IMBALANCE MORE THAN TWO TO ONE IN AUSTRALIA'S FAVOUR,<br />
THERE WAS ALSO A NEED TO REASSURE KOREAN BUSINESS AND<br />
GOVERNMENT LEADERS THAT THE NUMBER OF ANTI-DUMPING AND<br />
DEVELOPING COUNTRY TARIFF PREFERENCE CASES BROUGHT FORWARD<br />
By AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY DID NOT REFLECT DISCRIMINATION<br />
AGAINST KOREAN INTERESTS. </p>
<p>13,<br />
I SUGGESTED THERE WAS A CERTAIN INEVITABILITY ABOUT THE<br />
IMBALANCE IN THE BILATERAL TRADE, AS LONG AS AUSTRALIA<br />
REMAINED A COMPETITIVE AND FUNDAMENTALLY RELIABLE SUPPLIER<br />
OF THE RAW MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO<br />
KOREA'S DEVELOPMENT NEEDS THE IMBALANCE WOULD BE LIKELY TO<br />
PERSIST WHILE KOREA'S STAGE'OF DEVELOPMENT MADE SUCH<br />
INTENSE DEMANDS ON THESE PRODUCTS.<br />
I NEVERTHELESS STRONGLY URGED KOREA ACTIVELY TO EXPLORE,<br />
IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF TRADE,<br />
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET, AT THE SAME TIME<br />
I REITERATED AUSTRALIA'S KEEN INTEREST BOTH IN SECURING<br />
ACCESS TO KOREAN MARKETS CURRENTLY DENIED US AND IN<br />
INCREASING OUR EXISTING MARKET SHARE IN ITEMS PRESENTLY<br />
TRADED. KOREA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ASSUME A MORE PROMINENT PLACE<br />
IN AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES. WE SHOULD ALL WORK TO<br />
UTILISE FULLY THIS POTENTIAL$ IT IS PERHAPS SALUTARY, HOWEVER,<br />
TO REMIND OURSELVES OCCASIONALLY THAT JUSTAS WE LOOK TO<br />
KOREA FOR COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES, SO WILL THE KOREANS<br />
BE LOOKING TO USA </p>
<p>14.<br />
MLONG DISCUSSIONS WITH PREMIER ZHAO IN CANBERRA LAST<br />
YEAR AND IN BEIJING LAST MONTH HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT CHINA<br />
HAS ENTERED AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS OF STRONG ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH PREMISED ON RAPIDLY EXPANDING TRADE, INVESTMENT<br />
AND TECHNOLOGICAL TIES WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD,<br />
THIS HAS IMMENSE IMPLICATIONS FOR AUSTRALIA AND, INDEEDj<br />
FOR OUR REGION, AND FOR THE WORLD.<br />
A PARTICULAR HIGHLIGHT OF MY VISIT TO CHINA WAS THE<br />
AGREEMENT BETWEEN PREMIER ZHAO AND MYSELF TO ESTABLISH<br />
A JOINT STUDY GROUP TO EXPLORE THE SCOPE FOR INTEGRATION<br />
OF AUSTRALIA'S AND CHINA'S IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIES.<br />
THE PROJECT HAS FROM THE OUTSET COVERED THE BROAD AREA<br />
OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT BETWEEN THE IRON<br />
AND STEEL INDUSTIRES OF AUSTRALIA AND CHINA, INCLUDING<br />
EXPORTS OF IRON ORE TO CHINAj CHINESE INVESTMENT IN<br />
AUSTRALIAN IRON MININGj AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS OF PROCESSED<br />
IRON AND SEMI-PROCESSED STEEL TO CHINA; AUSTRALIAN<br />
INVESTMENT IN CHINESE STEEL MAKING; AND THE SUPPLY<br />
OF IRON AND STEEL-MAKING TECHNOLOGY FROM AUSTRALIA TO CHINA.<br />
THE CHINA-AUSTRALiA IRON AND STEEL INITIATIVE IS AN EXAMPLE<br />
OF A sf-c.' ECT THAT REQUIRES PARTICIPATION OF ALL INTERESTED,<br />
PARTIES IN THE COMMUNITY TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS. IT CANNOT<br />
BE ACHIEVED BY COMPANIES WORKING ALONE BUT MUST BE<br />
THROUGH A JOINT EFFORT REQUIRING PARTICIPATION FROM<br />
FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESS AND UNIONS$ </p>
<p>150<br />
THE ESSENTIAL ROLE THAT THE TWO NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE<br />
TO PLAY IS TO PROMOTE CONFIDENCE IN THE SECURITY OF THE<br />
RELATIONSHIP AND TO DEVELOP POLICIES WHICH ALLOW EACH<br />
OTHERS IINDUSTRIES TO DEVELOP IN COMPLEMENTARY WAYS<br />
TO THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF THE TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
IT FALLS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CO-ORDINATE THE<br />
EFFORTS OF AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPANTS. TO THIS END WE HAVE<br />
ESTABLISHED A CORE CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE IN WHICH ALL<br />
PARTIES ARE REPRESENTED@<br />
WHILE IN CHINA I SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME DISCUSSING THE<br />
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ' CHINA ACTION PLAN" A PLAN DEVELOPED<br />
BY THE t! iaNISTER FOR TRADE, MR BOWEN, TO EXPAND TWO-WAY<br />
TRADE BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT<br />
WAS PARTICULARLY APPRECIATIVE OF THIS INITIATIVE.<br />
I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN COUNT ON CHINESE ASSISTANCE AND<br />
INVOLVEMENT AS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN PROCEEDS.<br />
CONSIDERABLE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESOURCES ARE ALSO<br />
BEING COMMITTED TO ITS SUCCESS. IT IS A PLAN WHICH, WITH<br />
THE FULL SUPPORT AND INVOLVEMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITY, HOLDS THE PROSPECT OF QUITE RADICALLY TRANSFORMING<br />
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE AUSTRALIA/ CHINA TRADE, </p>
<p>16,<br />
WITH SINGAPORE AND tIALAYSIA, POLITICAL RELATIONS ARE CLOSER<br />
AND MORE CONSTRUCTIVE THAN EVER BEFORE, THUS CORRESPONDINGLY'<br />
INCREASING OUR PROSPECTS FOR EXPANDING ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS,<br />
IWOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO BUILD ACTIVELY<br />
UPON THE SUBSTANTIAL LINKS THAT ALREADY EXIST$ AN DOING<br />
SO IMAGINATIVE APPROACHES AGAIN WILL BE NEEDED APPROACHES<br />
CAREFULLY GEARED TO THE DYNAMISM AND RAPIDLY CHANGING<br />
CHARACTER OF THOSE COUNTRIES TO OUR NEAR NORTH.<br />
MR CHAIRMAN,<br />
THE CONTINUED DYNAMISM OF OUR REGION, AND INDEED-THE<br />
POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD ECONOMY, DEPENDS HEAVILY<br />
ON, THE MAINTENANCE OF AN OPEN INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEMS<br />
RECENT YEARS, COINCIDING WITH THE DOWNTURN IN WORLD TRADE,<br />
HAVE SEEN A PROLIFERATION OF BOTH TARIFF AND NON-TARIFF<br />
BARRIERS TO TRADE AND THESE BARRIERS PERSIST,. DESPITE<br />
A GROWING RECOGNITION OF THE-DANGERS THEY POSE TO ORDERLY<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADING ARRANGEMENTS. </p>
<p>170<br />
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND I PROPOSED IN BANGKOK LAST<br />
NOVEMBER THAT COUNTRIES OF THE REGION, IN A MANNER<br />
CONSISTENT WITH THEIR SHARED INTERESTS AND CAPACITIES,<br />
SHOULD SEEK TO DEVELOP A CONCERTED APPROACH TO A NEW<br />
ROUND 5LOBAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS SHOULD SUCH A<br />
ROUND MATERIALISE, AS SEEMS LIKELY.<br />
DURING MY VISIT To ASIA LAST MONTH, I OBTAINED THE FIRM<br />
IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS A SHARED IMPATIENCE AND<br />
FRUSTRATION WITH THE LACK OF PROGRESS ON MAJOR MULTILATERAL<br />
TRADING ISSUES AND WITH THE INABILITY OF COUNTRIES OF THE<br />
REGION TO SECURE SERIOUS ATTENTION TO THEIR PARTICULAR<br />
INTERESTS IN PREVIOUS MULTILATERAL ROUNDS.<br />
THE WARM REACTION OF COUNTRIES TO MY PROPOSAL INDICATED<br />
THAT IT HAS STRUCK A RESPONSIVE CHORD WITH THE COUNTRIES<br />
OF THE REGION. ALL THE REGIONAL COUNTRIES WE HAVE APPROACHED,<br />
INCLUDING ALL OF THE ASEAN COUNTRIES, HAVE AGREED TO PARTIPATE<br />
IN A SENIOR OFFICIALS'I MEETING TO BE CONVENED BY EARLY MAY<br />
IN AN ASEAN COUNTRY, TO HELP IDENTIFY REGIONAL INTERESTS<br />
IN A NEW ROUND. THE MEETING WILL ALSO CONSIDER HOW BEST<br />
TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON THOSE INTERESTS IN SUCH A ROUND. </p>
<p>18.<br />
THE RAPID AND DYNAMIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO APPARENT<br />
THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND THE QUITE FUNDAMENTAL<br />
STRUCTURAL CHANGES WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE<br />
COUNTRIES OF THE REGION WILL MAKE THE TASK OF DEVELOPING<br />
A CONCERTED APPROACH ON TRADE ISSUES A COMPLEX ONE, GIVEN<br />
THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE TASK AND THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF<br />
HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS WITHIN THE<br />
REGION, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EACH STEP WE TAKE EITHER<br />
COLLECTIVELY OR INDIVIDUALLY TO ENHANCE REGIONAL CO-OPERATION<br />
BE . MADE AT A MODEST AND MEASURED PACE. ONI.'( IN<br />
THIS WAY CAN WE HOPE TO ENSURE THAT THE GAINS ARE BOTH<br />
SUSTAINABLE AND DURABLE WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE RICH<br />
REWAPI?" SUCCESS WILL BRING FOR THE REGION AS A WHOLE AND<br />
AUSTRALIA IN PARTICULAR.<br />
THE SAME MEASURED APPROACH TO CHANGE SHOULD ALSO BE REFLECTED<br />
IN OTHER INITIATIVES FOR GREATER ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION IN<br />
THE ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION.<br />
As YOU WOULD BE VERY MUCH AWARE, THERE HAS, FOR A CONSIDERABLE<br />
TIME NOW, BEEN ENTHUSIASM AMONG SOME OF THE BUSINESS PEOPLE<br />
AND ACADEMICS IN THE REGION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WHAT<br />
IS LOOSELY TERMED A " PACIFIC COMMUNITY". PBEC HAS BEEN<br />
CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH THE EXPLORATION OF THIS CONCEPT OVER<br />
ANUML:: r OF YEARSI </p>
<p>196<br />
YOUR WORK, ON REGIONAL MINERALS AND ENERGY MATTERS FOR<br />
LAST YEAR'Is PBEC CONFERENCE IN SANTIAGO HAS BEEN OF<br />
CONSIDERABLE INTEREST, AS HAS YOUR WORK ON A SUGGESTED<br />
CHARTER OF INVESTMENT# PBEC IS ALSO THE CHANNEL THROUGH<br />
WHICH BUSINESS HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE SERIES OF PACIFIC<br />
ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION CONFERENCES, THE MOST RECENT OF<br />
WHICH WAS HELD LAST YEAR IN BALI$<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL FROM<br />
SIR JOHN CRAWFORD, WHICH INCORPORATES THE VIEWS OF<br />
JOHN CLARKSON AND OTHER PBEC MEMBERS, FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT<br />
OF AN AUSTRALIAN PACIFIC CO-OPERATION COMMITTEE, THE<br />
COMMITTEE WOULD ADVISE THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ON MATTERS<br />
AFFECTING AUSTRALIA' 0 S ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION WITH HER<br />
NEIGHBOURS-IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC AND BE RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPATION IN PACIFIC CO-OPERATION<br />
CONFER ENCE ACTIVITIES, THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE<br />
OF THE MAIN SECTORS OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY-AND INCLUDE<br />
PEOPLE FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, THE UNION MOVEMENT,<br />
ACADEMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND<br />
SUCH OTHER PERSONS AS WE WOULD APPOINT,<br />
YOU ARE ALL AWARE OF THE SENSITIVITIES ATTACHING TO<br />
. THE CONCEPT OF A " PACIFIC COMMUNITY'. AT THIS STAGE<br />
SOME COUNTRIES WITHIN THE REGION, THE ASEAN STATES<br />
PARTICULARLY, ARE WARY OF DEVELOPING THE FORMAL MECHANISMS<br />
AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT SOME DISCUSSIONS OF THE CONCEPT HAVE<br />
IMPLIED# </p>
<p>MOWN VIEW IS THAT " REALISTIC GRADUALISM" IS WHAT IS<br />
NEEDED AT THIS STAGE WITH FUNCTIONAL CO-OPERATION BEING<br />
EXPANDED CAREFULLY, ONE STEP AT A TIME. THE APPROACH<br />
SIR JOHN CRAWFORD AND JOHN CLARKSON HAVE IN MIND) IS<br />
CONSISTENT WITH THISI<br />
NOTHING WILL BE GAINED FROM TRYING TO IMPOSE PATTERNS OF<br />
CO-OPERATION. BUT, FOR AUSTRALIA, IT IS MOST IMPORTANT<br />
THAT WE CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY EXPLORE ALL AVAILABLE AVENUES<br />
FOR REGIONAL CO-OPERATION. AUSTRALIA NEEDS TO COME TO<br />
TERMS WITH AND BE PART OF THE POSSIBILITIES AND CHALLENGES<br />
OFFERED BY THE FASTEST-GROWING ECONOMIC REGION IN THE<br />
WORLD@ FOR AUSTRALIA SUCH CO-OPERATION IS A NATURAL REFLECTION<br />
OF THE INTERESTS AND CONCERNS WE SHARE WITH THE REGION.,<br />
THE MORE WE CAN ADOPT ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE SHARM ON A<br />
MUTUALLY REWARDING BASIS THROUGH TRADE, THROUGH JOINT<br />
VENTURES, THROUGH CROSS INVESTMENT, THROUGH PEOPLE TO<br />
PEOPLE EXCHANGES, AND THROUGH OTHER SHARED ENDEAVOURSTHE<br />
MORE EVERYONE IN THIS REGION WILL STAND TO GAIN. THROUGH<br />
ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THIS,. BRINGING TOGETHER AS IT DOES<br />
BUSINESS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE PACIFIC BASIN, THE HABIT<br />
OF CO-OPERATION WITHIN THE REGION WILL GROW-</p>
