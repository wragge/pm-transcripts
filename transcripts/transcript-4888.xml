PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 9 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
ADDRESS AT LORD MAYOR'S DINNER, MELBOURNE<br />
Last week in Melbourne a radio interviewer asked me if I had given<br />
thought to retiring, he had that hopeful and rather optimistic<br />
tone to his voice. I let him down gently. I made it clear that<br />
day was some years off as much as I would love to go back to the<br />
farm. He then asked if I would be writing a book you know.<br />
" Fraser on Fraser" or something. On this occasion he had that<br />
" I hope he doesn't do it" kind of tone to his voice. I was pleased<br />
to be able to satisfy him.<br />
What happened yesterday is history. What happened last week or<br />
last year or 20 years ago cannot be altered. It is now part of<br />
history and people can judge it as they wish. I'm more interested<br />
in tomorrow, next week, next year. My interest is in the future<br />
Australia's future.<br />
In just over 400 days we enter a new decade a decade that promises<br />
so much. What do the ' 80' s hold for our families, our friends,<br />
this city and for our country? How are we placed, now, as a<br />
nation to cope with the problems and challenges: how are<br />
we placed to capitalise on the opportunities? Will the<br />
be a " decade of despair", as some would have it or will it be<br />
a decade of dreams fulfilled?<br />
Today, in Australia at least, there is a new feeling, a new spirit<br />
and a sense of expectation perhaps also a sense of relief that<br />
we are through the worst of the recession. I share that optimism.<br />
In every sense, we are uniquely placed to take advantage of the<br />
challenge and promise of the next decade. In stockborkers' jargon<br />
Fraser is " bullish".<br />
Of course this hasn't been a good year for Fraser bulls.<br />
Poor Franz's future snapped recently. But that set-back hasn't<br />
dissuaded me about Australia in the 80' s. In many senses we<br />
are still the lucky country. Our great natural resources are the envy<br />
of nations around the world. We have the minerals the energy<br />
supplies so desperately needed in an energy hungry and energy<br />
short world. Our massive rural industries are supplying local and<br />
world markets. Our wheat, sheep and beef are keenly sought on<br />
the world marketplace.<br />
We are developing a great multi-cultural society. Families from<br />
all parts of the world are looking to Australia for new hope<br />
a new homeland. They are contributing to our maturing as a nation,<br />
they are adding to the character of this nation. / 2 </p>
<p>Our technology and scientific expertise is grabbing<br />
attention and respect in the hospitals, laboratories and<br />
academies throughout the Europe and the Americas.<br />
Interscan developed by the CSIRO will help make the world<br />
airways safer. The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute under<br />
Gus Nossal is playing a leading role in world cancer research.<br />
The world is looking to Australian expertise in dry land and<br />
grassland farming. The CSIRO in cooperation with industryhas<br />
pioneered new techniques in wool production. As a result,<br />
Australian machines have been sold in many markets overseas.<br />
In the arts music, painting, writing Australians like<br />
John Sutherland, Sidney Nolan, Robert Helpmann, and Morris West<br />
are admired and respected everywhere. Australian ballet charms<br />
and delighted audiences of the world.<br />
There is no question that we have the people, the talent, the<br />
capacity and the opportunity to make Australia unequalled among<br />
the free nations. These are not just politician's words.<br />
This challenge, this promise that the 80' s holds, is not some<br />
unrealistic utopia. It's not pie-in-the-sky. Do we all have<br />
a vision of Australia's future? Surely we all want an Australia<br />
which is a country of growth and development, of prosperity arnd<br />
enlightenment, of stability and security, or compassion and<br />
effective help for those in need? Do we not want a country in<br />
which there is unequalled freedom and opportunity for individual<br />
Australians? It is in this way that we can have a more self reliant, more<br />
caring, more responsible, more creative and more tolerant nation.<br />
We are already on the way to realising this ideal. It is our<br />
goal to build a vital economy, sure of its own strength,<br />
developing through the capacity of its people.<br />
Beating inflation killing the deadly effects of inflation<br />
throughout society has been the key. The Treasury tells me<br />
that we will achieve a five percent inflation rate before the<br />
middle of next year. Think what this will do for Australian<br />
industry for confidence. Australian companies are now selling<br />
Australian-made products in some of the toughest overseas<br />
markets and Australian products are respected in the great<br />
market places of the world. We have entrepreneurs who have<br />
used drive and initiat-ive to seek out new markets and produce<br />
goods to meet those markets' needs.<br />
How long is it since our companies could do that. Our manufacturers<br />
are able to do it, because Australia has a more stable cost<br />
base with inflation now below that of our trading partners.<br />
A stable cost base gives confidence to industry, it allows<br />
industry to plan ahead and invest with a certainty and predictability.<br />
If some industries can do it more can. It is for Australian<br />
enterprises to show the stuff they are made of. / 3 </p>
<p>Australia's rural industries are now, for the first time in<br />
maybe a decade, looking ahead wi ' th optimism. With costs<br />
coming under control, our great wheat, beef, wool and<br />
sheep industries are experiencing good markets together with<br />
a good season at the one time. Too often we underestimate<br />
what a strong rural economy can do for Australia. There can be<br />
no permanent prosperity in our great cities, until there is<br />
prosperity in the countryside. City and country are interdependent.<br />
Not only are costs settling down, but interest rates are<br />
falling. That's good news for every Australian for business,<br />
for farmers, for home seekers. Inflation,' interest rates,<br />
stability in policy from Canberra these are the keys to a<br />
revival of confidence and development throughout Australia<br />
Of course, the real productivity the real life of<br />
Australia is private enterprise. The decisions of people in<br />
industry in banking, retailing, manufacturing affect our<br />
country's fortunes. The initiative of individuals is central to<br />
how we grasp the opportunities of the 80' s. But Government also<br />
has its place.<br />
The historic decisions taken by the Commonwealth and every State<br />
Government in Melbourne this week illustrate how Government and<br />
industry in partnership can set up the guidelines for growth.<br />
Great new power sources, upgraded export facilities, a great<br />
world trade centre for this city these are the acts of<br />
governments adding confidence upon confidence. In these conditions,<br />
how can Australians have anything but confidence in the future<br />
of our country.<br />
But Government is more than economics, figures and indicators<br />
it is about people and the place that people take in our society.<br />
We must be concerned to protect the weak and the poor.<br />
We must be concerned to help young Australians in the<br />
transition from school to the workplace. We must be concerned<br />
to create and promote a tolerant society for the well-being of<br />
all irrespective of colour or race.<br />
The Galbally Report on Migrant Services; family allowances;<br />
training for the young; automatic pension increases;<br />
unparalleled help for handicapped and aged; and channels to<br />
protect people from unreasonable decisions by what are sometimes<br />
regarded as all-pwerful bureaucracies these are the hallmarks<br />
of concern and opportunity.<br />
Let me ask just one thing of you that we do not pay mere<br />
lip-service to the goals and aspirations we all share.<br />
They are not simply abstract notions for speeches by Prime Ministers.<br />
We need all of us to relate these goals to our everyday<br />
lives. Can I suggest that this gathering of men and women in<br />
Melbourne tonight is perhaps better placed than most to do just<br />
this. Let me offer some exampies. 4 </p>
<p>We all believe in there being more jobs available for<br />
Australians out of work. It is not now time for union leaders<br />
to show concern for their members out of work for the unemployed<br />
by moderating their wage claims? Jim Callaghan Labor Prime<br />
Minister of the United Kingdom is also struggling hard to make<br />
this point. He knows the British community must show wage<br />
restraint.<br />
We all believe in the handicapped receiving a fair deal.<br />
Is is not now time that more employers showed real concern for<br />
the handicapped by offering them work as vacancies become<br />
available? Do the handicapped not have the same right to work<br />
as anyone of us in this room?<br />
We all believe we live in a great country. Isn't it time we<br />
stopped knocking our achievements? Isn't it time we<br />
started demonstrating real national pride and confidence in<br />
Australia and a belief in the future?<br />
Achieving the aspirations we share is not just a task for<br />
Dick Hamer's Government, for Malcolm Fraser's Government.<br />
It is a partnership in the truest sense between government and<br />
citizens.<br />
At this dinner last year, I said:<br />
" Forces at work will take Australia into the 80' s and<br />
beyond with a real hope and confidence, and a real sense<br />
of belonging to a nation that has become an example to<br />
the world."<br />
With the 80' s on our doorstep, we will achieve just that.<br />
Achieving the goals and aspirations we share is not just a<br />
task for Government. It is a task for Government and people,<br />
for the Commonwealth and the States, for the young and old.<br />
For Australians wherever they are.<br />
The Australian Government seeks a partnership with the community,<br />
between government, employers and employees, between<br />
government agencies and voluntary organisations, between<br />
legislators and individual Australians. With such a partnership,<br />
with such a commitment, there is nothing Australians cannot<br />
achieve. </p>
