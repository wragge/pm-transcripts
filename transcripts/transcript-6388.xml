SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL<br />
SYDNEY TOWN HALL 5 MAY 1984<br />
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be with you on this<br />
special occasion the Australian Children's International<br />
Film Festival.<br />
As many of you will know Hazel and I are particularly<br />
interested in and concerned about entertainment for young<br />
people. Hazel eagerly accepted the nomination to become a<br />
member of the Board of the Australian Children's Television<br />
Foundation, which is doing a fine job in the television area<br />
for our* children.<br />
Many of your present here tonight are deeply involved in the<br />
education of children. You will therefore keenly appreciate<br />
the enormous influence of film and television in our<br />
children's your students formative years.<br />
The facts speak for themselves. According to the Australian<br />
Children's Television Foundation:<br />
Throughout their schooling children complete 11,500<br />
hours of formal education<br />
They will also view 15,000 hours of television<br />
They will witness some 18,000 murders<br />
They will-view 500,000 advertisements<br />
And they will watch 7 times more films than they<br />
read books.<br />
Nothing could more graphically illustrate the need for the<br />
community parents, educators and the entertainment<br />
industry alike to come to grips with the implications of<br />
this situation. Film and television are far and away the<br />
most substantive media influence on our children. The<br />
quality of the product is of critical importance. </p>
<p>And that is why I am especially pleased with this initiative<br />
by the Yoram Gross Film Studio and the Australian Film<br />
Commission to continue an Australian Children's<br />
International Film Festival. It will give us all a chance<br />
to see the best in children's films from around the world<br />
and from within Australia.<br />
The Festival will also help in developing an understanding<br />
of the standards at which we should aim. Hopefully it will<br />
as well help in spreading awareness of Australia's own film<br />
making capabilities.<br />
We have all taken great pride in the resurgence o~ f the<br />
Australian Film Industry over recent years. But ' I suspect<br />
that the average citizen thinks only about the obvious adult<br />
box-office successes like " Picnic at Hanging Rock", " The Man<br />
from Snowy River" and " Breaker Morant".<br />
The fact is that alongside the burgeoning and successful<br />
Australian feature film industry we also have a growing<br />
quality children's film production capability.<br />
In the film and television animation industry alone, studios<br />
are employing hundreds of artists, writers, actors and<br />
technicians on a regular basis.<br />
And overseas network and cable television buyers, as well as<br />
cinemas, are keen to buy our products. " Dot and the<br />
Kangaroo", for example, has now been screening in the United<br />
States for four years a sure sign that it is greatly<br />
appreciated. As with adult films Australia's ability to produce<br />
children's films that have style and quality goes back to<br />
the first days of cinema.<br />
And with the Government's interest in thingjs archival you<br />
will believe me when I say I am delighted that the National<br />
Film Archive, which we have recently taken steps to<br />
establish on a more secure basis, has made available the<br />
1927 classic " The Kid Stakes" for this Festival.<br />
But to return to the present what can we expect at this<br />
Festival? I am told some of the features to be shown over the next<br />
week have won awards at other international film festivals.<br />
During this festival, audiences will have the opportunity to<br />
see a film entitled " Ten to Survive", produced by ten<br />
countries for UNICEF. The Film is about the rights of thve<br />
child as outlined by the United Nations. </p>
<p>3.<br />
The seventh " Right" involves education and it reads in part<br />
"( The Child) shall be given an education that will promote<br />
his general culture". Children's films have become part of<br />
our culture, and our culture has become an integral part of<br />
our indigenous children's films.<br />
In short, quality productions designed for either cinema or<br />
television can be both entertaining and, at the same time, a<br />
satisfying and effective way for young Australians to learn<br />
more about life, both here and overseas. As such we cannot<br />
attach too much importance to continued Australian success<br />
in this field.<br />
I wish you all well with this important project'and I have<br />
very great pleasure in declaring this Australian Children's<br />
International Film Festival officially open. </p>
