<p>. DPMC RE-ORGANISATION<br />
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br />
Charts of the old and new organisations and a comparison<br />
table are attached.<br />
Cost The new Second Division structure approved represents<br />
in salaries an additional $ 51,630 p. a. However, it is<br />
estimated that, but for the restructuring new functions would<br />
have resulted in additional Second Division salaries of<br />
$ 151,680 p. a.<br />
Purpose The changes have been necessary because of a steady<br />
accretion of departmental responsibilitis since the last<br />
major re-organisation took place midway through 1973. The new<br />
administrative arrangements settled last year by the Government<br />
have had a marked effect on the Department. Attention is drawn<br />
in particular to the Prime Minister's statement of 18 November<br />
1976. This referred, among other things, to the need for the<br />
Department to expand its policy development and program<br />
evaluation roles.<br />
Public Service Board Examination<br />
The Board's review covered such matters as pattern of<br />
organisation, distribution of functions, workloads, lines of<br />
control, authority behind functions undertaken, work value etc.<br />
The Board's work value review had regard to its approach to<br />
position classification which reflects the 1975 National Wage<br />
Case guidelines. There was substantial agreement between the Board and<br />
the Department. There were some issues upon which agreement was<br />
not reached.:<br />
Timetable Preliminary work, which is significantly reflected in the<br />
re-organisation commenced in May 1976. Discussions commenced<br />
with the Public Service Board on 3 December 1976. The Board's<br />
decision was received on 4 Fcbruary 1977. Executive Ccuncil<br />
approval was given on 11 February.<br />
No decisions have yet been reached, on th. e question of<br />
staffing the new organisation, although obviously-the staffing<br />
. of the new structure is a matter for priority cor.. ideration.<br />
The claims of existing staff for promotion must, of<br />
course, be a major consideration in stafl'ing the new organisatioi<br />
However, it is by no means an automatic -; rocess to promote<br />
existing staff. Promotion is on merit. It is expected that<br />
there will be an appropriate mixture of promotions from outside<br />
and within the Department and these will be gazetted in due<br />
course.. </p>

It is estimated that new functions, but for the restructuring of the Second Division establishment<br />
would have resulted in the creation of two more Divisions staffed by something like six Second<br />
Division officers at an estimated additional annual cost of $ 151,680. The figure of 37 does not<br />
include the 6 positions which would have been required. C i. Y.. ST~<br />

<p>PRI M EM I N I S T E.. R<br />
The Prime Minister today, in response to<br />
questions about the upward re-classification of<br />
senior positions in his Deoartment, said that the<br />
re-organisation recognised the increasingly onerous<br />
burdens borne by senior officers and aligned the<br />
Department's structure with those of other major<br />
Commonwealth Departments such as the Treasury and<br />
Defence. He also said that he did not see the<br />
re-organisation as setting a precedent as he was<br />
not aware of any other area of the Service which could<br />
demonstrate the changes in responsibilities of his own<br />
Department, but that this, of course, was a matter for<br />
the Public Service Board to determine under its<br />
statutory powers.<br />
