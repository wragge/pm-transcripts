PRIME MINISTER QFOR<br />
PRESS ( F. 76/ 28)<br />
ADDRESS TO BRISBANE PRESS CLUB 13 FEBRUARY 1976<br />
Since the elections in December, the Government has concentrated on<br />
getting its economic programme under way. The first priority of<br />
the Government should by now be well understood. It is to bring<br />
inflation under control. Until this is done, there waill be no real<br />
return to confidence in the economy and no soundly based expansion<br />
of job opportunities. Fortunately, there is increasing appreciation<br />
of the absolute importance of tackling inflation and tackling it<br />
as rapidly as possible.<br />
Our first task is to transfer back to individuals and private enterprise,<br />
resources which have foolishly been diverted to the Government.<br />
We have begun to do this. Inevitably there has been enormous waste<br />
and-inefficiency involved in the very rapid increases which have taken<br />
place in Government spending. We have made a large number of<br />
economies in administrative expenses and spending programmes, starting<br />
with the spending of Ministers and other Members of Parliament.<br />
Economies worth $ 360 million have so far been announced. These will<br />
be effected in the remaining months of this financial year. These<br />
same economies in terms of annual rates, are equivalent to savings<br />
well in excess of $ 1 billion.<br />
A stop has been put on the growth of the federal bureaucracy.<br />
On 23rd December, we announced our intention to hold staff ceilings<br />
at the level they had reached at the end of November. As a result<br />
of a further searching reappraisal of priorities and programmes,<br />
we have reduced these ceilings still further. By the end of June<br />
there will be 17,480 fewer peopl ' e employed in the federal bureaucracy<br />
than under the ceilings set by the previous Government for Departmehts<br />
and authorities.<br />
We will be continuing to examine the Government's spending commitments.<br />
Sir Henry Bland is heading a committee to review administrative<br />
expenditure, with a view to achieving maximum efficiency and<br />
eliminating waste and duplication within and between Departments.<br />
Alongside these measures we have begun to implement a number of<br />
policies to directly boost investment and job opportunities.<br />
These include the 40% Investment Allowance, the suspension of<br />
quarterly tax instalments, various measures to assist rural industry,<br />
renewed encouragement to development of mineral wealth, greater<br />
efforts to promote Australian trade, and a major set of monetary<br />
measures to take up excess liquidity and encourage investment.<br />
These measures will all contribute to the revival of job opportunities<br />
and real economic growth. </p>
<p>Later this year, we will begin to implement our policy of personal<br />
income tax indexation which will ease the pressure on individuals<br />
of the constantly increasing tax burden inflation brings.<br />
Steps have also been taken to establish a responsible Cabinet<br />
Government which can give effect to coordinated policies. Much<br />
greater care is being taken by Ministers to administer-their<br />
Departments to ensure that the administrative means without<br />
which policies cannot succeed, are well thought out and operate<br />
effectively..<br />
Many of these decisions have been hard ones, but they are decisions<br />
which serve the over-riding goals of Australians. We have taken<br />
the decisions we believed to be in Australia's interests. The<br />
Australian people elected us to do a job. We will do that job.<br />
And we will do what is necessary to make a success of that job.<br />
Let me emphasise that restraint on the part of Government does not<br />
mean doing less than we can in the present. It means maximising<br />
our present gains without jeopardising our potential f or the future.<br />
It means balancing the present against the future.<br />
A fundamental cannon of good Government is that we must operate<br />
within the limits of our resources. In the longer term, the best<br />
safeguard against the history of the last three years repeating<br />
itself, is for us all to be aware of an appropriate role for Government.<br />
It is very ea sy to stimulate the kind of pressures we have seen in<br />
Australia by exaggerating what Government can, or ought, to do.<br />
Too many politicians, not only in Australia but also in the other<br />
Western democracies, have promised too many things that they just<br />
cannot deliver.<br />
This is the greatest single threat to the . continuation of democracy.<br />
The success or failure of democracy will depend on the ability of<br />
both politicians and people to relate their expectations to the<br />
resources available. Democracy will fail if democratic Government<br />
cannot persuade people that they must not demand of Government<br />
more than resources make possible. This is the great test of<br />
democratic leadership, the great challenge to the people of the<br />
Western democracies are we to be seduced by the irrational<br />
promises of Socialism which cannot, by their very nature-be realised?<br />
The last election result holds our great hope for the future.<br />
Our qualities as a Government and a people will be tested by our<br />
ability to take the hard decisions that responsibility demands.<br />
We must exercise restraint. Restraint on the part of the Government<br />
means that Government should not intervene unnecessarily in areas<br />
of life where people can do things for themselves, if they really<br />
want to. The apparent advantages of Government assistance to one<br />
group must be weighed against the fact that help for one group is<br />
given at a cost to others. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The more the Government undertakes the role of deciding the<br />
distribution of resources, the less freedom do people have<br />
to decide which activities they will fund, because more and more<br />
of the money they earn is allocated for them by Government.<br />
People become more and more dependent on Government and in the<br />
end, this increasing dependence on Government builds frustration and<br />
political anger. If we rely too much on Governmen:, the demands<br />
for assistance in the end press upon and overwhelm the limits of<br />
resources. When this happens, everyone but particularly<br />
the weaker groups suffer.<br />
Over the long term, Australia's real wea lth has increased by about<br />
5.3% per annum. This is the limit on real improvement in all<br />
areas of where improvement is possible. We cannot cheat on this.<br />
We cannot exceed these constraints without rapidly imposing other<br />
costs on people. A massive attempt to evade these limits such<br />
as we have seen in the last three years ends up by creating,<br />
totally unacceptable social dislocation. It does this by reducing<br />
the national wealth and our capacity to help the needy and<br />
disadvantaged. There is another group, much more visible, who have also paid for<br />
the excess Government expenditure of the last three years, the<br />
unemployed. One major reason why Australia is suffering from the<br />
level of unemployment we now have, is that resources which private<br />
enterprise needs to expand plant and equipment, and create job<br />
opportunities. You may recall that the Mathews Committee Report<br />
last year went so far as to say that the very existence of the<br />
private sector was threatened by this situation.<br />
People and Governments must recognise that there are limits on<br />
what Government can perform. Performance must be matched to<br />
resources. This involves hard decisions. The fact is that<br />
we have no choice if prosperity is to be restored.<br />
Two of the most difficult decisions concerned the future of the.<br />
Prices Justification Tribunal and Wage Indexation. In both these<br />
cases, we-re-examined previously held views in the light of new<br />
evidence. Thus, over the P, J. T. we agreed to consult with<br />
interested groups. This move was generally hailed as being a<br />
wise one based on a willingness to re-examine the merits of<br />
the case.<br />
In the case of Wage Indexation however, the very people who had<br />
described our attitude on the P. J. T. as one of proper flexibility<br />
now called our reconsideration of a passing on of the full 6.4%<br />
C. P. I. into wage increases, a " breach of trust". Two inconsistent<br />
responses to similar actions. What's good for the goose is<br />
apparently not good for the gander. </p>
<p>-AThe<br />
Government believes that an increase of 6.4% would be in the<br />
interests of no-one. It would undermine the confidence of both<br />
consumers and industry in Australia's future. Some industries<br />
have no capacity to pass on higher costs. In these industries,<br />
unemployment would grow. In other industries, the pricing<br />
situation is more flexible and costs can be passed on.<br />
But these higher prices will then be reflected in the C. P. I. index.<br />
The Index, will then be used for the next wage adjustment, and so on.<br />
What advantage is there to anyone in this vicious spiral of higher<br />
prices, higher money wages, higher costs, and yet more price increases?<br />
I am certain that most Australians now recognise that this is the<br />
process which has been undermining Australian prosperity.<br />
Mr Hawke has said that we need a consumer-led recovery. Consumers<br />
have had higher wages and tax cuts. Because of their uncertainties<br />
they have not spent but saved, saved to hedge against inflation.<br />
The -factors that prevent consumers spending, are the factors that<br />
prevent business investing -uncertainty about the future, about the<br />
course of inflation.<br />
Those who say we need a consumer-led recovery in this fashion are<br />
applying the logic of Theodore, the logic that Keynes wrote into<br />
his theory. But these ideas are now forty years out of date. The<br />
preconditions for these ideas to apply are high unemployment,<br />
a stable currency , and low interest rates. The only precondition<br />
that exists at the moment is high unemployment.'<br />
Because of the policies now being implemented by the Government,<br />
the Arbitration Commission today has the greatest opportunity in<br />
its history to decisively affect the course of inflation and<br />
unemployment. Its decision is of the greatest importance.<br />
it cannot avoid responsibility by claiming that it is only concerned<br />
with the wages dispute, with the particular case before it. The<br />
decision of the Commission today will affect everyone.<br />
Because of the policies the Government has initiated, the Commission<br />
now has the greatest opportunity to break the inflationary spiral.<br />
I am certain that the Australian people want that spiral broken.<br />
The Government has an unequivocal commitment to get unemployment<br />
down, to provide job opportunities for Australian workers.<br />
During the Labor years, the union movement said little about the<br />
highest unemployment since the Depression. They failed to<br />
protect the interests of their members -particularly their weaker<br />
members.<br />
While afew strategically placed militant unions were able to benefit<br />
from increased wages, the consequences of this were higher and<br />
higher unemployment and inflation. Some unionists benefitted by<br />
taking away their workmates' jobs. </p>
<p>Now they propose to destroy even more jobs in the pursuit of<br />
illusory paper wages, perpetuating the wage-price spiral which<br />
only benefits the few at the expense of the many.<br />
I look to the A. C. T. U. and its President to represent the<br />
interests of all their members and not the interests of the A. L. P.<br />
One man cannot speak effectively for both the Labor Party and<br />
trade unionists especially a man who hopes to come into<br />
Federal Par ' liament. This ambition must make it impossible for<br />
Mr Hawke to'do both jobs with commitment and dedication. When a<br />
choice had to be made in the past, he placed the A. L. P. above the<br />
Union movement and especially above the unemployed.<br />
Now Mr Hawke again has an opportunity to show that he can be<br />
a great Australian and place the interests of the unionists and<br />
unemployed first. I hope that he takes it.<br />
The-. Government's commitment to increasing employment opportunities<br />
is unyielding.<br />
The Government expects, and I am sure the Australian people expect,<br />
the cooperation of all sections of the Australian community in<br />
restoring prosperity and job opportunities.<br />
There have been suggestions from some quarters that trade unions<br />
may boycott the tripartite Conference with the Government on the<br />
economic situation because of the stand of the Government on the<br />
wage case, and because of our intention to legislate for secret<br />
ballots. I do not expect that this will happen. I have too much confidence<br />
in the basic common sense and dedication to the national interest<br />
of the majority of trade union leaders.<br />
Business also cannot escape from its obligations to the whole<br />
community. The law requires that businesses have an obligation<br />
to their shareholders. Morality requires that businesses also<br />
have an oglibation to their employees and to people generally.<br />
This obligation should weigh particularly on big businesses,<br />
including multinational corporations. International companies<br />
have a major obligation to the people of the countries in which<br />
they operate. Business must be concerned for the working environment<br />
of their employees, for the consumer, for the quality of their<br />
product, for the environment.<br />
Some businesses evidence that concern, in the same way that some<br />
trade union leaders are conscious of their wider responsibilities.<br />
Some businesses unfortunately do not.<br />
Both business leaders and trade union leaders must look to their<br />
responsibilities. The Government, employers, and the trade unions<br />
all have a responsibility to those who are unemployed, to the<br />
weaker sections of the community to all who will continue to<br />
suffer until inflation has been brought down. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
I expect that employers and trade unions will continue to<br />
both work with the Government because they recognise that this<br />
is a time when over-riding common interests must take precedence<br />
over narrow special interests.<br />
The decisions taken and the procedures adopted are important in<br />
placing Australia back on the path of economic recovery and<br />
prosperity. In our initial attempts to rein -in the budget<br />
deficit, limit the growth of the public sector, and give the<br />
community an increased confidence in the future, we are confident<br />
of success. oOo... </p>
