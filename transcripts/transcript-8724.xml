PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
NATIONAL IMMIGRATION OUTLOOK CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY, 13 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this<br />
very distinguished gathering, and I think I should begin<br />
by saying on behalf of the Government, thank you for<br />
giving your time and expertise to a conference of very<br />
great importance to Australia.<br />
The names of those taking part attest to the Continuing<br />
centrality of immigration in Australia's life and, I<br />
think, to the great public spirit at large these days.<br />
And I think it is true to say that these days we can<br />
sense in Ausiralian public life beyond the party<br />
political sphere a new sense of purpose and engagement in<br />
national issues, a new level of interest in the future.<br />
it is something I think all of us would encourage.<br />
Ladies and gentlemnen, a few months ago I attended a<br />
preview screening of the Australian film, Strictly<br />
Ballroom which has since set box office re'cords ' and won a<br />
raft of prizes here anld elsewhere in the world. It is an<br />
extraordinary popular phenomenon.<br />
Strictly Ballroom has a few lessons for us I think.<br />
For a start it is a reminder that creativity and<br />
productivity, the cultural and the economic, are<br />
complementary. Strictly Ballroom is popular culture, including<br />
inulticulture, and it is art. It is also a terrific<br />
return on a public and private sector investment and it<br />
exports. It is both economics and culture, including<br />
multiculture. The story of the film would have been impossible without<br />
the post-war immigration policy. It could not have been<br />
conceived without it. Nor could the personnel the cast<br />
and crew have been conceived for that matter. </p>
<p>2<br />
Strictly Ballroom concernls faith and hope and opportunity<br />
and care. The making of it concerned the same things.<br />
Strictly Ballroom is about excellence but it is also,<br />
quintessentially, about ordinary people.<br />
The film tells us that, hard as it often is to do it, old<br />
ways need to change. It tells us that we need to be open<br />
to new ideas.<br />
But it is also about the best of Australian values<br />
their immutability and their adaptability. It is a<br />
decidedly iunpiA film. It's about continuity as well<br />
as change.<br />
it might be read as a metaphor for Australia in the last<br />
half of the century. It is about all of us. There is a<br />
bit of all of us in it, and it suggests to all of us, I<br />
think, that there is a lot to learn from the experience<br />
of multicultural Australia.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, in the latter half of the 1970s,<br />
when I found that I was increasingly in 8 position to<br />
have some influence in the Labor Party, and therefore<br />
potentially some influence on Australian public life, the<br />
nature of my ambitions became clearer to me.<br />
Since then they have become clearer still.<br />
I hope you will bear with me for a moment while I try to<br />
explain them. I think it is worth doing because I don't<br />
think my experience is at all atypical.<br />
The comm unity I grew up in was distinctly Anglo and<br />
Celtic Australian. I grew up with old fashioned<br />
Australian working class traditions, one of which was a<br />
pretty happ~ y partnership with s-ocial mobility.<br />
Success was encouraged and applauded, but it was assumed<br />
that you wouldn't forget your roots. You would take them<br />
with you wherever you went in life, whatever you did.<br />
Now I don't need to explain to you the relatively simple<br />
cultural parameters of such a society. The faiths, on<br />
the outside at least, were work, family, church, league,<br />
racehorses and rock and roll.<br />
Under the surface lurked a love of Australia and its way<br />
of life, a broad egalitarianism, a belief in social<br />
justice, the idea I know it's a cliche but it's true<br />
of a fair go for everyone.<br />
These values were simple enough once you understood them,<br />
and to grow up in them was to understand them.<br />
But what perhaps does need to be explained is the paradox<br />
they contained for people of my generation. </p>
<p>3<br />
For, you see, I had the greatest respect for the values<br />
and traditions of the Bankstown community. I still do.<br />
Fundamentally, they are what I am.<br />
_ Bankstown is nothing more or less than home.<br />
And, as people do with homes, I want to protect what it<br />
is and what it stands for.<br />
But the paradox was this: much 88 I loved it, I wanted<br />
to change it. I wanted to open the place up.<br />
The Australia I knew as a young man was narrow, insular,<br />
uncertain of itself.<br />
The Australia of the 1970s was still too narrow.<br />
It seemed to me that, for all its great virtues,<br />
Australia was missing out on what the world had to offer,<br />
and it was offering the world less than it could.<br />
Australians in those days tended to believe that you<br />
could only keep traditions up by keeping others out.<br />
By the 1970s I had begun to see my cause among those who<br />
wanted to open Australia up to the outside world I<br />
wanted a Labor Party and a Labor government which was<br />
open to the world and phobia-free.<br />
Like Australia itself, Bankstown is now a very different<br />
place, and perhaps the most obvious change can be seen in<br />
the shopping malls where these days Lebanese and<br />
Vietnamese businesses predominate.<br />
This causes some concern among the older residents just<br />
as it caused concern among my parents' generation when<br />
migrants from Italy and Greece began to move in.<br />
These and other migrant groups have added to the life of<br />
Bankstown they've given it more strength and interest.<br />
In due course I have no doubt the migrants of recent<br />
years will too.<br />
But the old values are still strong there is still that<br />
faith in the idea of social justice, expanded opportunity<br />
and broad egalitarian democracy, faith in Australia,<br />
concern about Australia all these are still the<br />
dominant values, and they transcend ethnic origins.<br />
One of those values is tolerance. </p>
<p>4<br />
we should not lose eight of the fact that along with the<br />
willingness of migrants to come and join in the life of<br />
Australia, and ' thd wir'lingness of governments to<br />
facilitate that, the essential preconditions for the<br />
success of the immigration program were the values of<br />
democracy, tolerance and goodwill in which earlier<br />
generations of Australians believed.<br />
This is not self-congratulation so much as giving credit<br />
where it's due. I say we should give credit to democracy<br />
Australian democracy.<br />
For under that laconic exterior a serious democracy is<br />
lurking. And under the conservative attachment to the<br />
Australian way of life, there is a capacity to<br />
accommodate change, and welcome difference.<br />
We can draw a parallel between multicultural policy and<br />
economic policy in the 1980s.<br />
As Treasurer I saw miy role as the necessary one of<br />
opening Australia up to the world, making us a player: inthe<br />
longer run, I have no doubt, not just a player, but a<br />
winner. There have been setbacks the recession has been an<br />
awful setback: but essentially that is what it is a<br />
setback on the long road to an Australia which<br />
successfully competes in the world and thus successfully<br />
sustains a high standard of living, increased<br />
opportunities and a healthy democracy for its people.<br />
Just as we are an infinitely more interesting, rich and<br />
rewarding society because we are now multicultural, so<br />
the rewards will be greater infinitely greater<br />
because our economy has joined up with the world.<br />
Imperfect as they might be, the deeper democratic values<br />
of ordinary Australians were absolutely necessary in the<br />
transformation of Australia from a narrow and inward<br />
looking society to a more cosmopolitan and outward<br />
looking one.<br />
i have said several times this year at various functions,<br />
here and overseas if you want the proof of our capacity<br />
to change in the next decade look at the change we have<br />
made in the last one.<br />
It has been the willingness of Australians to make the<br />
change and the capacity of their institutions to make it<br />
which has brought about the revolution in our workplaces,<br />
and which more than anything else gives us reason for<br />
confidence about the future.<br />
We are succeeding In making this a competitive, exportoriented,<br />
productive culture because the people of<br />
Australia have come with us. I I I J A. I I i Ld Q _ 4 </p>
<p>We will only make it wealthier society, and therefore a<br />
place where more opportunity exists, by the same meansnot<br />
by creating an underclass, or by employing some form<br />
of trickle down economics, but taking all the people with<br />
US. I won't belabour you with figures now. Nor am I<br />
shrinking from realities which still need to be<br />
addressed. But the shape of the Australian economy has changed<br />
dramatically in the last few years and the most telling<br />
evidence of this is in the fact that our exported<br />
manufactures have doubled and total exports now make up<br />
23 per cent of Gross Domestic Product compared with 14<br />
per cent a decade ago.<br />
The message is the same as the message of<br />
multiculturalism. The basic values of Australia support<br />
change. our broad egalitarianism does not drag us down, it<br />
underpins our capacity to adapt.<br />
It is our strength. And for me that is the resolution of<br />
the paradox between those things which we value and<br />
those things we want, what we have and what we need,<br />
between inertia and progress.<br />
The basic mould of Australian society has served us well<br />
through generations, through great trials and<br />
extraordinary change.<br />
We need to make it stronger, bigger, more adaptable and<br />
interesting.<br />
But it must not be broken.<br />
The Accord provides another example another example of<br />
building from the mould from the cooperative, equitable<br />
nation-building instincts of Australian society.<br />
The Accord is primarily responsible for giving us rates<br />
of du&amp; strial disputation sixty per cent below the 1970s,<br />
the creation of 1.5 million jobs since 1983, a ten per<br />
cent reduction in labor costs, a substantial shift from<br />
wages to profits, the lowest rate of inflation in the<br />
OECD, a doubling of manufactured exports since 1983 and<br />
an increase of 63 per cent since 1988-89.<br />
There has been no greater contribution to our<br />
competitiveness than this partnership and there is no<br />
better guarantee of it increasing.<br />
The recession has given us totally unacceptable levels of<br />
unemploymeat, but we will not find jobs for those people<br />
by disp~ osing of our strengths and the Accord is perhaps<br />
the greatest of these. </p>
<p>ILL'.. I ~ oU. PU~<br />

I firmly believe that our economic success rests<br />
ultimately on the same bases as our social success -our<br />
success as a nation involves both.<br />
The key is this if we include Australians and their<br />
beat traditions we'll succeed. If we leave their Late to<br />
chance, I believe we'll fail.<br />
More than that, we will lose one of the great egalitarian<br />
societies in the world. We'll lose both our heritage and<br />
our future.<br />
I want to make the point very plainly: the chances for<br />
truly radical change depend on social acceptance of<br />
change. Change which tramples on social values, which<br />
breaks the mould, will simply not succeed.<br />
What I want to say tonight concerns change. Not change<br />
of the strictly economic type with which I know I am<br />
generally associated. it concerns some of the things I<br />
believe we can do in this decade leading to the centenary<br />
of federation to extend the domain of our common heritage<br />
and our common hopes.<br />
if it is true that it was caring for cultural traditions<br />
which made multiculturalism a success, it follows that<br />
fostering ai~ nitifgtenation's cultural life is a<br />
matter of priority.<br />
It's why, among reasons like pure pleasure, I set a lot<br />
of store in the arts.<br />
I think much more than is often appreciated in politics,<br />
they serve to bind society together.<br />
The arts define and re-define us and in that they give us<br />
confidence. They encourage tolerance as well as<br />
excellence, they shape and reinforce the mould of our<br />
society, and by all this they can help carry us through.<br />
Again, we can learn something from that famous decade a<br />
century ago.<br />
The legacy of the 1890s was not just federation and the<br />
Labour movement it was an Image of ourselves and this<br />
land indelibly engraved by Australian writers and<br />
artists. They defined Australia, and in so doing they gave<br />
Australians faith in themselves for generations to come.<br />
I live in hope and it's a confident hope that the<br />
1990s will renew our faith and the faith of new<br />
generations. </p>
<p>.7<br />
That's substantially why this year we established a panel<br />
of leading Australians to develop a national cultural<br />
policy to bring cultural questions into the mainstream<br />
of decision making in Australia, and to encourage<br />
excellence and broaden participation.<br />
In this the Government is taking a leading role, but it<br />
also responding to public interest and concern.<br />
As I said when I began there is, just now, an enlivened<br />
interest in the nation.<br />
it can be seen in programs aimed at re-defining Australia<br />
both at home and abroad, particularly in Asia.<br />
Some of these programs are coming from government<br />
departments, but what is most striking and most<br />
encouraging is the degree to which they are being<br />
generated by groups of independent individuals or by<br />
institutions which never contemplated such a role for<br />
themselves a few years ago.<br />
I think it is true to say that they are in part a return<br />
on the issues of nationhood which the Government has<br />
raised this year.<br />
Not that we invented them there has been for a long<br />
time I believe a rising tide of national feeling and a<br />
great need to open the channels of expression.<br />
You can be sure that we intend to keep them open.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, when we think about the issues of<br />
Australian nationhood in the 1990s, once again I think<br />
there is something to be learned from the multicultural<br />
experience. it's worth remembering that long before the post-war<br />
immigration program one could have drawn a cultural map<br />
of Australia defining regional and other differences<br />
based on AuStrala2 experience.<br />
The map essentially still exists. And, as with<br />
multiculturalisem, the object is to find unity in the<br />
diversity, productivity in the diversity.<br />
Long may Queenslanders be Queenslanders and Sandgropers<br />
Sandgropers, and the people of Wagga or Weipa, or the<br />
Mallee or the Barossa take pride in their distinctive<br />
communities, all they do and all they have done.<br />
In fact it should please Australian nationalists to think<br />
that, culturally speaking, Australia will be<br />
characterised by stronger regional identities as time<br />
passes. And by a stronger natlonal Identity. i iov ji rqo uuz) r ui i </p>
<p>We need a strong national identity at home to give us<br />
more strength of purpose and belief. We need it abroad<br />
to leave no one in any doubt about who we are and what we<br />
stand for.<br />
I think we should and can encourage it.<br />
We can encourage the idea of Australian citizenship in a<br />
number of ways, including by serious consideration of our<br />
national symbols and by a full non-partisan debate on<br />
constitutional change.<br />
I think I have made my position on these pretty clear in<br />
the course of this year. I am one who thinks our flag<br />
would better reflect our contemporary identity and<br />
aspirations if it did not carry on it the flag of another<br />
country. I also believe that thefLaA should not be changed<br />
without the support of a majority of the Australian<br />
people and it will not be.<br />
There would now appear to be no doubt that something very<br />
close to such a majority exists in support of an<br />
Australian republic, and that the number is growing.<br />
It seems to me that the public Is increasingly interested<br />
in this debate and expects of the Government that the<br />
appropriate constitutional changes be fully and expertly<br />
canvassed and considered.<br />
I don't believe Governments in the nineties are going to<br />
be able to avoid this responsibility, and, I think and<br />
certainly hope, that the time is rapidly approaching when<br />
it will be possible for political leaders to discuss<br />
these matters without the inference being drawn that one<br />
is Irish, or creating a distraction, or hostile to<br />
Britain or Her Majesty the queen.<br />
This is not change so much as institutions keeping up<br />
with change with national growth.<br />
These things will have to be confronted because the<br />
people, particularly younger people, want them. And<br />
deserve them.<br />
If it is true that those basic values of Australian<br />
democracy were an essential factor in the success of<br />
multiculturalism, then I think it is probably time that<br />
we acknowledged them more formally.<br />
I saw recently that Asian participants in an Academy of<br />
Social Sciences project said that they were at once proud<br />
of their Australian citizenship and puzzled by how little<br />
pride native-born Australians seemed to take in it. </p>
<p>9<br />
1 think it is probably true that Australians who were<br />
born here tend to take their rights and responsibilities<br />
for granted, and lapse into believing that this democracy<br />
came to us by accident in the same way that we not so<br />
long ago believed our prosperity was an historical<br />
accident. In truth, just as we have learned that we must work at<br />
creating national wealth, that we must be cleverer and<br />
more cooperative and cohesive, so we have to work at<br />
social and political development at national growth.<br />
In this decade I think we might profitably aim at<br />
building in the whole community a more spirited sense of<br />
our democratic achievements and greater involvement in<br />
the questions now confronting us.<br />
it would be absurd if migrants attending citizenship<br />
ceremonies felt more strongly and were more knowledgeable<br />
about Australian democracy than Australians of long<br />
standing. if our education system is the best means of changing<br />
this, then we should use the education system to change<br />
it. If there are other means, we should employ those as<br />
well. In the next few years we should be looking at all those<br />
elements of our political and constitutional heritage<br />
which have been lost to Australians or leeched of<br />
meaning. Just as we deliver our cultural heritage back to all<br />
Australians, I think we should be seeking ways to deliver<br />
the essential strands of our nationhood.<br />
The patriation of our Constitution from London might be a<br />
start.<br />
As my colleague, the Minister for Justice, said last<br />
night, another very useful initiative might be the<br />
adoption of an Oath of Citizenship sworn to Australia and<br />
the principles of democracy and tolerance, and explicitly<br />
recognising that Australian citizenship is a common bond<br />
involving reciprocal rights and obligations which unite<br />
us all.<br />
At another level there can be no greater hope than that<br />
our efforts to achieve reconciliation with the Aboriginal<br />
people succeed, and that we can convert the<br />
unconscionable tragedy of 200 years into a common cause<br />
for social justice.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, last February we brought down an<br />
economic statement with the non economic name of Npne_<br />
Nation". </p>
<p>I LL<br />
By this we meant to convey our message that social and<br />
political cohesion and purpose were as important as<br />
economics in the effort for recovery and securing the<br />
nation's long term future.<br />
It was not just the name, but the programs we announced<br />
which told the story the National Rail Highway and road<br />
programs, the National Traff* gA-uthority, the National<br />
Electicity idwere at-6once emblems and manf-festations<br />
of-our intent.<br />
As a Labor Government whose primary goal is always full<br />
employment, we recognise just how severe the effects of<br />
recession have been how severe they continue to be.<br />
We have devoted by far the greatest part of our efforts<br />
this year to reducing levels of unemployment and doing<br />
our best to alleviate its effects. We have devoted a<br />
very large part of the Budget to this.<br />
We have also taken the view that the solution is not<br />
merely economic.<br />
And the experience of immigration and multiculturalism in<br />
Australia makes that plain.<br />
one cannot speak of immigration without thinking of the<br />
hope and faith which migrants need. In themselves and in<br />
Australia. If we are to succeed as this, the greatest of Australia's<br />
social undertakings has succeeded, we will need those<br />
elements of hope and faith in Australia.<br />
And we will need the tolerance and good will on which the<br />
immigration program rested.<br />
We will need to keep the best of our traditions alive and<br />
guiding us, and our hearts and minds open to the world.<br />
I think that is the best lesson to be learned from the<br />
past fifty years of our history.<br />
That lesson applied might see us with our democratic<br />
traditions essentially unchanged in the year 2000 but our<br />
people more aware of them, and more eloquent in their<br />
expression of them.<br />
By this I mean something beyond a nation in which<br />
everyone knows the words of the National Anthem.-but<br />
that would certainly be a good start.<br />
whatever decisions Australians make in the next few years<br />
and I think it is likely that they will choose to have<br />
an Australian Head of State the proper role for<br />
Government in these things is to open debate and the way<br />
for change. I L) V L) I I q U U UL, r </p>
<p>I I-IU v L i 4U. U UQ F<br />
The greatest hope is that by the year of the centenary of<br />
federation the social justice Australians have always<br />
believed in is more than ever before a thoroughgoing<br />
reality in Australia and that, above all, full<br />
employment is entrenched again.<br />
if these are my hopes for the year 2000, my hope today is<br />
that, for 811 the necessary detail of your deliberations<br />
here and elsewhere in your professional lives, you never<br />
lose sight of this bigger picture.<br />
Thank you. </p>
