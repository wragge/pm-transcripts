TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, ARAL SADOR BEACH HOTEL, NASSAU<br />
16 OCTOBER 1995<br />
JOUZZALIMT Mir Hawks, you were talking on the BB-C only<br />
77fZ~ cnaye ago about wide spread ~ adatory rianctions.<br />
Po you feel now you have altered aheada bit-on that?<br />
PY.: Of courso not, : 1 wish you would be fair enough when<br />
y'ou are talking about the position of myself and the Government<br />
to look ot tho whole statement and series of statuuentA we've<br />
mada about ou2 position on this issue and how we would be<br />
apprvchlng the queation ' at the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Gove;: ment. a~ t all points we have mado it dlear that oA course<br />
we w~ ould be talking about the queat-orxa of manctiona and<br />
urging the Comimonwealth to prepare At-tsef for the taking<br />
of sanctions. And they would be widespread sanctions. We<br />
madG it quite clear from the time of the 19 August when the<br />
Ccbinet first considered thim question in some detail, that<br />
we would ' ba talking about a graduated step-; by-atep process.<br />
The words that were used At the time were repeated last<br />
month by Bill Hoyden in the United 14ations, That what we<br />
went to oaen is a astuation we possibly can where<br />
no oanctions at'lall are necessary. ! That the two prong<br />
procena that we will be putting to the Commonwealth here<br />
w'ill bo to look et the process of ednctions, what is available<br />
to be applioda and what should be applied if the approach<br />
of sooinS dicussion and dia-logue Is not affective. and<br />
we will putting in some dotail starting tomorrow and<br />
throur,; tho diacuosion on Thurdday ind Friday the approach<br />
of tho Goverr~. mnt which wo have discussed am now broe4lyp<br />
with a number of our colleaguea in he Commonwealth which<br />
ooa'o hero Qiro the series of sanctions increasing in intensity<br />
Whiich is tnhould be preporod an a Coiutonwealth to inatituto<br />
wh. ich wo an Auctralia will be prepard to be aamociated with,<br />
if t-ho process that we are asking 6f looking for dialogue<br />
with 3outh Africai does not produce ' positive results.. Now.<br />
that hao been cloarly our position * rem the beginning-in all<br />
the dimorions, both orally'and by , letter with our aeolloagus<br />
in tho Cou~ onwa~ th, that's the posljtion we have been putting<br />
u-4 we have been putting hore. </p>
<p>And to take ona line of something "~ at has been said<br />
in the BBC interview is a totally uqf air representation<br />
o what we have consistently been s4q ing from Auguat until<br />
now, and we will continue to put hie~ e in this confazence.<br />
J0URNALIST: Shouldn't you have sail that in the BBC interv4. w?<br />
PH: NOU~ what I said in the BBC interview w4a relevant<br />
to the context 1^ -which Ift was bein~ said. Well you are likely<br />
to have a position where Mrs Thatche~ would be arguing<br />
that that, possibility of sanctions a ould not be contemplated.<br />
Now r am concerned to say th~ n and no, that of course<br />
we should be talking about widespread economic oantions.<br />
What we will be talking about here, will be to look at the<br />
whole apectrwn of time and intensitjIof sanctions. And there<br />
is no doubt that in this discussion re will be saying that<br />
if the processes of dialogue that we: will seek to create<br />
don't work, if possibly a first trandckof sanctions don't<br />
work thon we have got to be looking right through the<br />
spect: m to wide-spread sanctions an~ uving the language<br />
oj tho Unite. Naticns.. 1Tt would be ap ropriate to talk<br />
about tho possibilty at the end of sp~ eac trtlz. 97tiue<br />
of mandatorry. uzv*_ 4az1 oanctione. So of couroo, one hae<br />
bee-talking about that L&amp; ut at all points A-have been oaying<br />
where we have had the opportunity ofl detailing the position<br />
of the Government; dut we are looking at a stey by step process,<br />
I would hope that out of the dacision6. we can get here<br />
that we would be able to reach a position where the regime<br />
in South Africa would oee that the Cormosnwealth having<br />
lookec at this whole spectrum, having ontemplated<br />
a serias of steps leading to the poos ~ bility that the end<br />
if nothing nlse would work of mandatoy sanctions through<br />
the United Nmtion~, 4-hat the very facp of spelling out our<br />
rct~.. ess to contemplate that sort of approach could load<br />
to a position where you did not have to use the sanction<br />
procoos at all, that they would respono to the indication<br />
that wpwere prepared to go that route'and underatand themselves<br />
that i. makes much more sense in terms of some of the interests<br />
that they are seeking to protect, to start to talk and to<br />
chaingo. JOURlNALIST: Sir, 1I346 t~ your hope that that approach could<br />
be E5 d comPromiaeA both Mrs ThatcheV and tho Black<br />
Africans ivhuCa Ac&amp; Qpf t<br />
PHt: It~ o not only my hope, its the hope of the Black Africans.<br />
live had tho opportunity of talking nc'~ e Uith President<br />
3aunda. " rhcd a long talk with him laot nigjht. And he is<br />
onca with ma in thic approach in say4. ng 00 coure<br />
they woulC mnch prefeor a situation whoro tha= 0 is no need<br />
for sazict-tono, because it should be rhmrd, particulary<br />
in ta~ s os' tho most effective of aan,,, ionG th at they are<br />
ao likely Siven the reaction of South Africa to have a &amp; V<br />
002; fct on the front lino states. And 6~ o ixnnet. h Rou~ nda apeacing<br />
with Xbaliove great authority, for th4 African Statat and<br />
aticm, 1=' rY the F'ront Lines States is sayping yea # 0hrwould<br />
Pa!= a nitumtion whore while v4 talk, about, as wte must<br />
do, an~ d Vvrk. ado cle sr ate. ail timeof, ie must talk about sanctions#<br />
prGoaG oursolvae for ! implementing the~ t.-</p>
<p>We should be at th(-oesme time suaying,,. wall look, here are<br />
the, atepo that w9 &amp; aght to be taken* should address ourselves<br />
to the prooeves of change. We shou1 talk cabout'whether, as<br />
I Iva saidtho creation of 6group of Em~. neht people would be<br />
a oonsible part of trying to e$ tablis that dialogue. And<br />
Kuanda agrees. with that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks, how L~ r hLave have thoyc got before you<br />
Introduo's anctions? b%# d M ho<br />
PLA: I am here as the Head of~ the Aust1ralian Delegation.<br />
I means for bettor or for worse I'm nit making the decision.<br />
for the Commonwealth. But we would be! suggesting to the<br />
Commonwealth and in the discussions, lae as* what comes out.<br />
But let me make this observation, that I think that we haven't<br />
got unlimited time. That I think we ought to be talking<br />
aiout, ait least in regard to a first range of oanctionq, the<br />
pscibility cf saying if by approxima ' ely the and of thic<br />
ya7or ear~ ly next year,. which is not ; very longq away, that<br />
J1 ftera n~ sal9t aigns of pooitive responsoaf than we ought<br />
to be talkinV about implementing action which could embrace<br />
a lot og what -has already been done by a number of nations#<br />
including nations of the Commonwealth..<br />
jo M. 2ALIST: Specifically, what Mr Hawke?<br />
Woll 1 think that it ia fair that I put these details to the<br />
rmeoting. But let me may this. The concept of what<br />
putting ia that it amoms to me, ' that you-would look<br />
at oatagories of poooible sanctions, i~ icreasing in<br />
evrity, and also may Z say, increasing in -of ' their possible<br />
izpact upon the 6,, 04 S tates. Ahid one would hope that<br />
if it waD under toj prPr dess to move in stags like that<br />
that you would iacrease the capacity to put preeaure upon<br />
south Agrica to be prepared to talk. Now, thereforep to what<br />
wao to ba included in those categories', if thiG sort of approach<br />
rcoco mnds'itzelf to the Commonwealth, ' ic3 a matter for discussion.<br />
I mean ome people will have different views &amp; am to what things<br />
should be included at various stages. But I &amp; Ge it as important<br />
to try and particularly get Brit~ ln to understand that we are not<br />
hera wiahrng to talk about sanctions 2or the neke of'sanctions,<br />
bat all of us, including the Front Lioe Statoo. iD Africa would<br />
rraa; i progar a situation where we can got dialo( gUeo A~ nd 12<br />
by talShing about that sort of approach, it Incrafefa our<br />
capiett' t: o get th~ t sort of understand1ing s; MO&amp; K~ WLSA<br />
so ig more likely &amp; ro we to be able to get comon<br />
docimion out of the Commonwealth Meetñ Irg.<br />
JOMALIOT: Mr Hawke# tho South African Government has<br />
% wnon 55durate Government.<br />
124 ~ ooIt Have you got any real hope that they will cowe<br />
a gue with some group set up by the Commonwealth? </p>
<p>PH: Well1, let me say thin, that I think there 10~ Ovidance<br />
of vary condiderable concern within So~ th Africa at the<br />
level of busineunj. I mo&amp; n I have had the opportunity of<br />
talkinVj with President 74undat who went into considerable<br />
detail with me of the meeting between the representatives<br />
of$ the South African bucineos community, and the ANC<br />
which he facilitud in Lusaka. And it~ is quite clear that<br />
those powerful elements within South Africa have<br />
recognised the increasing strength of world opinion and<br />
of a patpriebnesu to mo~ e from rhetori6 to action. And so<br />
the climate for receptivity now is, I think, greater<br />
than it has been before. So I th$. nk when you have<br />
the position that the Black African St~ tes themselves<br />
are s~ aying that they see merit in this proposal for trying<br />
to get dialogue, rather then immediately moving into<br />
sanctions then that of itself should v* ry substantially<br />
form our decision.<br />
JOURNA~ LXSTs Are you still aiming for a joint Commonwealth<br />
poeltion to be taken to the United Nations* Mr Hawks, or<br />
io that no longer relevant.<br />
PM: Not. you have got the complication.. here. Let me go one<br />
step back0 o believe obviously that whatever comes out<br />
of the Commonwanlth should be reported to the United<br />
Nation~ g. The quostion of whether in a4 ixmediato aense<br />
you woula be able to seek a United Nations replication<br />
o a Commontwealth decision could to some extent, depend upon<br />
what 00asures were included at the first stage of sanctions,<br />
Tn other words, ig you could got a position where the<br />
Commonwcalth could come to a unaminous agreement, including<br />
the position of the United Kingdom, as a first stage. that<br />
could include a ban on the export of oil and petroleum products<br />
becausG the United Kingdom currently has that position. So<br />
to got that at the'first stage of the Commronwealth would be<br />
important. But if you sought immediately to taka that<br />
to th United Nations, Britain would be in a position perhaps 1Aft.<br />
while Wc~ cou ld agree to it in the Commonwealth as part<br />
of a packa~ ge, they wouldn't agree to it univarsally, because<br />
it would have a different impact. So I'm making a point<br />
yea, we want to discuss here what should be the relationship<br />
between tho Comonwealth and the United Nationas, but that<br />
it im to voine extent complicated -by the factor to which I refer.<br />
J0UM1ALIST4. Mrs Thatcher refers to economic nanctions, and.<br />
Me E she refers to economic boycotts and trade boycotts<br />
What exactly do you understand she means when she talks about<br />
tho Canations?.<br />
P9~: I h.-ven't spoken to hort yet. I hope to. I moan outside<br />
the actuail context of the meeting, the formal meeting, I<br />
think thia io scmantics really. </p>
<p>zmean I don't believe that as far as we are concerned that<br />
# t tuxne on a word. I mean where you are talking about<br />
cmictions -o boycott you are meaning that thb nation<br />
concerned, that ia the nation acting against South Africa<br />
would take a decioion to deny a particular service or camnodity.<br />
1.4 you want to call that a sanction or a boycott I dont<br />
th~. nh it turne on a word.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would-you be proposing 4s a first stage, someth. ing<br />
along the lines Mr Ramphal put for sanctions?<br />
PM: Well, You have got this alternative. You can say you can<br />
look at range of actions that have been taken by a number of<br />
countris that are there ini-place and say well lotsa apply that as<br />
a firat otage. Or you could seek just the application of the<br />
two criteria of relevantly minor impact upon the Front<br />
Line tltatee as determined in what should go in the first<br />
package. And it won't necessarily produce exactly the same<br />
combinat~ on-oa elements. I'm going into tho diacussion<br />
on tho ba1oia of a concept. Here is the concept and being open<br />
as to what the elements of the firat staige should be. Rib+<br />
taying from Australia's point of view# that we are prepared<br />
to go along with a consensus position on the anouption that<br />
that represents a dotermination by ' the Commonwealth to<br />
increase -the pressure upon SoirW Africa and in. the hope,<br />
&amp; 3 1 aaylthat the other avenue which we refer would produce<br />
a~ prepardt-55 on the part of the regime to talk. And that's<br />
not just to talk with the Commonwealth, but to talk with<br />
the elements within South Africa that have to be:. talked with if<br />
you are going to more'to chanye. ftGq<br />
JOUNALIST: Do you see your role as ~ a ' ridge between BrittO n<br />
anM Uie r-est of the Commonwealth?<br />
M~ Personally?<br />
J0O33VALIST: You.<br />
Inis w~ ell, I don't want to elevate my role, but it has<br />
boon put to us by a number thAt Australia, and Canada was<br />
mentioned as well~ have a particular oportunity to perm91<br />
JOUMlALIST: I was wondering based on your discussions so far,<br />
you = feel that BritL~ n is going to be isolated at this<br />
Conference on sanctions?*<br />
mzh thñ ! k Ak;, thp right way of putting it La this.<br />
Thar-ciktaryona lookin4~ i~ aiistically underatando that LZ~ you<br />
take 1% the atatemsnto thatI have been mada by tho time tzo got here 6<br />
ortan im in a position different aubotantiolly 2rom tho<br />
cot of the people. But the very interosting thing that<br />
has~ emerged from my diacuosions with a range oE dol. egates,<br />
including, as I say4nenntth 1Kaunda, is that there is no<br />
daaI re.: to aay1 400M5. Brit-vs haz made ite deciaion,. ihere..<br />
im no po-. nt in talking, With them, Lotsn now izolate them.<br />
Rather the view is lots, by the procesuof discussion.<br />
av4 dobate coo if we can bring Brnt to a ponition of<br />
cc-rsmnt, so it now remtins to be seen whether thoso<br />
17rocease can been ouucesoful. </p>
<p>jOUl~ NALIST: D'ou'thitik they will be? Are you confident?<br />
PN. Woii I thihk ñ t! 0 just too early to say, I haven't had the<br />
opportunity vsC talkingO,', ra Thatchar, but what I can<br />
say . romm own point of view is that I will be doing all<br />
that I can, and I think I will be helped by a number<br />
of people I've refervtd to my long ta-lks alrbady with<br />
Mr Mulroney, Mr Gandhi is coming to see me tonight after<br />
the dinner and we will be talking about the same issue<br />
obviously. So I think that there are a number of us who<br />
are going to be trying very hard'. So let's hope.<br />
JOUPIALZ ST a On Mr Gandhi# 24r Hawke$ Hte said in his speech today<br />
tha MVtoria regime was impervious to reason and that<br />
the N~ assau CHOGM must demand comprehensive and mandatory sanctions,<br />
the queation cannot be deferred. Do you think that given4tie<br />
positioi~ n. hand, and say Mrs Thatcher's position on the<br />
other, that~ ill make some common position very-very difficult?<br />
PM: wall It would.'. bb. fobliah of me to say thcmt we area<br />
not Zaced with a difficult task* of course we are. But I 9Av'<br />
had 4~ t opportunity of tall~ ng with Mr Gandhi already. And as I<br />
roay 7 nm going to bQ talking with him again *+ grcIAR<br />
tonight a2toz the dinner. And I know that he wants to<br />
achiave m position where BkitAin can be associated<br />
with action, co he has * a4Z n hope. And I really<br />
don't know in a canoe nhItay about that, because the<br />
positio~ is protty stark in terms of statements that have<br />
alrea Nadep but I think that one element that is important<br />
. isth is~. Clearly Britc-. n is concerned about the level of its economic<br />
stake in SoUWh. A~ rica and its legitimate for them to have it in'<br />
mind. 1 thihk that it will be important for. Mrs Thatcher<br />
to -ndrstand really two things . concerning Brithi-nds<br />
econcmic interacts in South-Africa. Firstly,,&amp; nd I cain say this<br />
2ttengthazzby the diacussi6na I1 have . had" rTesident<br />
thet it is important for the future of a now<br />
* and just OOCJiety j. 64A Aer. i4 that the economic capadity t<br />
ghou-" d ba retaiined. K4Snda recognises thise ' they don't want 13ft<br />
the procneo o! political d. mancipation sociated with<br />
econemic aut and diagpetation of'resourost-that<br />
1i3 raprecented by accumulated capital and expertia thereai<br />
Now L! f X4r Thatcher can underotand that this in the position<br />
o: 2 tho 13c Africans then I think that -' is important<br />
and ma" el to change her thinking. And of courve, asaociated<br />
with that point which I may add to it, would mean that in the<br />
avenuz oO? diocuae~ on ~. at we are talking about by thin 2? anal<br />
of LVminent ? eople, one of the things that we would be wanting,<br />
or that X have in mind that lit wow be weanting, ouch a group<br />
o t{ al king about would be precisely thim iscue. To try and<br />
aice htrv. in'.-he Pr~ ocesses of political change 6f evolution<br />
to V_ no ' Ir an6 juct South African society with universal<br />
sufferaige, 0~ die cuss with the exictin regima what would be<br />
involved to ensure that the economic ca city was maintainod. </p>
<p>HNow if Mrs Thatcher, as I say# can understand that that<br />
is what we and Zlack Africans are about, it may change her<br />
thinking. And the cecond point ' is that I think that she must<br />
underotand that in that sort of context that I Am talking<br />
about it in infinitely more likely that the Dintl aX. interest.<br />
that do @~ rot are more likely to be maintained Via~ Lb1.<br />
than in a pooition where there is no dialogue, there<br />
is no process of peaceful evolution, but at some stage<br />
the explosion. Now I have the feeling that those or* such<br />
ccupbllingly logical and correct arguments that you<br />
must have some chance of getting through.<br />
JOURMALITt Prime Minister, in your consideration and<br />
F. 0c abou t this Panel~ oaf Eminent People has the<br />
name cd. M~ erb TVUdeau been mooted at all?<br />
PH4I NC Do far.<br />
JOURNALISTt or Kaunda himself?<br />
P. M: No. But I think you will appreciate, I don'It w~ 4Us<br />
want-to Vo too tar into the question of the names.* Becauce I<br />
think~ bc ve thought through siome namea and we will be<br />
pzpearod when asked to say well here arc some that wo have<br />
thouc'ht about. But I wov be saying that there io the<br />
PanVi That it should be, but those sort of people.<br />
But Trudeau is not one of them?.<br />
vio, ton tha-, t list I bO it wasn't an exhaustive lihut.<br />
I a therefore not sayin5 well no Trudeau, I am simply<br />
oaying that 16 was rather a short list, illustrative if you<br />
JOURDIALIST: How many names?<br />
PX: Nell there were about seven or so on this liat. But I<br />
don' want * you to got carried away by those names on that<br />
1ict; Z mean its tile concpt that is important. And aa far as<br />
iwstralia La concerned w qu ite 4lexible Wotthe &amp; pemkeg<br />
sense and2 I'm getting a fair bit positive reactio A~ Bw<br />
aro qu~! te open to talk about composition.<br />
JOORNALST: How important will that be?<br />
PM: Z'-thinh very important, because what emerged in the<br />
diecon with Sonny and myself iS that, and others<br />
thQt ho has obviously talked to as well. but I can only<br />
rwpoa~; Gbout my awn. conversation, is thmt we will, I think<br />
ce to ratct telking about South Africa, the later part of<br />
tcorr=! O Goom'ion. And then jo in to having a fa~ irly<br />
oubotantial part of Friday on it. Then 1 think the idea<br />
Ia tl~ at we wou~ ld cut ofZ the discussion by about mid afternoon<br />
on Friday to that thiey could otart tho econortic i ta of<br />
the nd a. Then we would take the discuss ion of"~ oint ttkoA<br />
reached then into the retreat. </p>
<p>Ani! 1 would hope that we would have got far e0 h along<br />
the track' in expocing the i@ siuss in the formay then<br />
to m~ oan that once we got to the retreat we would have<br />
tho opportunity of trying to thrash out the basisi of<br />
the comon ground. And ao therefore the answer to.<br />
% Sour question is that I think the retreat in dvery importantpare.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks, just to get a better idea of the time<br />
scale involved in this graduated process# to it that the<br />
first range might be brought iftto place at the end of<br />
thio year, or early next year. If nothing happens as<br />
a rosult of that when do you then look at the second step?<br />
PM: Woll we haven't got a time table on that* ao it would<br />
be preumpta= 3u, and in a sense counter productive for<br />
Auatral2ia to come along to this meeting and say look here is<br />
the exa~ ct tima table, here's each element of the category,<br />
therb 5. t 13. Rather, what I've tried to do is to have<br />
a conce~ pt which we believe makes sense, ;-, hich matches<br />
tho roaitieao og the expectations of the Black African<br />
sltatG3 which masts the roality that we have 6%<br />
job oO perouauion to do with 3ritAl. n, and say well<br />
hore is the concept which include, the graduated steps.<br />
Az, far as we have gone in to say well we think<br />
obviouhly in terms of applying the first category, well you<br />
can't be sa~ ying twelve months down the track, you have got<br />
to be talk-ing about some time in the relevanthnear future.<br />
t1, d cay il you han't got a pos itive responee from<br />
South Africa by a relatively new time in the future<br />
then Category I ought to ritart. Now how the meeting would,<br />
if it responds to this broad concept, how it would want<br />
to ut a timetable on the stages, is really a matter<br />
that we sho( bld discuss together. I haven't presumed to<br />
say well, in three months, stage two# three months stage<br />
JO= NALIST': Would the actions in Category one be mandatory ce<br />
PM: ' dell you have got to underatand that when you use the<br />
word mandatory, you really are using the language of the United<br />
Vations, o9 Chapter 7 of the United Nations. It's. not relevant<br />
to tah! ii C onwea th Ljon, because if we roach the"~<br />
pos~. ton of conaenou Bwf at we aretlkn outhr<br />
by delinition all o2 them will apptly them. So I mean the<br />
cue"' I-I ce mandatory within the. Commonwealth doein't apply<br />
N wo reach ai position of consensus of thio io what should<br />
bo done,*, Qhen all the Commonwealth curiswould gjo back<br />
and reflect by their own actions the decision which<br />
they have made here. </p>
<p>JOURMILIST: It would mean nothing without Brita;. n would<br />
? Mt Obviously, its basically importantAto get B t-aim involved<br />
don't believe from the view live got ' roundihc is<br />
pretty broad range of discussions, I don't believe that the<br />
CoiiMOnWealth would say well in the absence of Britoon the<br />
rest of us do nothing. or do not seek to process this matter<br />
further. But as you have heiard--from all I have said to<br />
this point everyone recognises the importance or<br />
maximising effectiveness of having Britpin in the 00kn<br />
JOURNLM: What would the conlsequences be for Britai'n<br />
do you M I nk of it doesn't go along with the consensus<br />
view of the Commonwealth. What would her standing be, her<br />
influanco on Commonwealth nations?<br />
PH4: 1 don't think it is helpful to go to that hyp0Wz*. ical.<br />
' 16m oanm I not just trying to dodge it because I'Im operating<br />
on ths basis now that all my best endeavours and aaaociations<br />
wit.% a number of my colleagues io going to be to try to<br />
prou&amp; ade themn to be there and I mean if I talk about,<br />
upeculate about, what p if she doeshl-well I don't think<br />
it ir helpful9 I mean I am more than' prepared to talk<br />
about ' that in the unhappy eventikali'klt that ite.<br />
got to that position. But I would rather leave it till<br />
then to talk about it.<br />
JOURNALIS~: Putting it a bit differently, if this Meeting<br />
cioebn3n'cme up with a meaningfulV. measure on this inLsue,<br />
do you-thiz* -there is any point in the Comonwealth<br />
continuing. Would you become jaundicadabout the the Commonwealth?<br />
PM4: Vell this matter is of such importance to us and clearly<br />
to the rest of the Commonwealth that one would have to<br />
ray that it you wer It able to get an effec. i~ o. va decision<br />
then it would have to affect you judgement yes but Z really<br />
don't want to go too far down in that because it really4. he<br />
same vuet~ tion in another way. But I repeat1 if at the ond<br />
of thio againot my most fervent hopes, . we are in that pomition<br />
I am cquitG prapared to throw that matter around in dimcuosi6n.<br />
with you then, but I don't think it is helpful to do it now..<br />
JOURM'GIST: Which leaders have put it to you th~ t thay sea<br />
Aut( PD' role as an intermediaty nr br18fjw?<br />
VM: 1ll Sonny has spoken to me, Bofiny awphal Mwe~ ontionedjin tlue<br />
termm and in rdincussions wit-% 3rian A( ulronay he kIsd in~ Lcate4<br />
that thats been put to him, thhthatlla our rolab.-= n rta~ nnly<br />
in the discunaions with Xanfda sees our role ans important. </p>
<p>JOURNALISTt You don't feel that that puts pressuro<br />
on you Chat you could do without?<br />
PMs.' llm quite relaxed about it. I meanas you know, long<br />
before I've been in the Parliament, both within Australia<br />
and internationally with the ILO Ms Lo, 4e ,4c.^, Mepa 4# AQj~<br />
d 04I'm more than happy IF people think that we can<br />
play a particular role here to do it. From all the questions<br />
you have been putting, I think you realise the importance of it.<br />
If Australia can do somethingwell.<br />
JOURNALISTs Having arrived here Mn Hawks and started<br />
talking to people do you think its a more important<br />
meeting than maybe you envisaged a couple of weeks ago?<br />
PM: go I don' t think so, erhaps it dramatises it a bit<br />
more in your mind when you kmtN. 49Pu oA,. j i word. ow aw<br />
the range of leaders, the Gandhi's Mulroney' 6,. Xaunda's<br />
your Mahatir's. 1hen you are talking with them and hear<br />
and the intnmity of their positions and the pre-eminenoe<br />
which they attach to it., L perhaps dramatises it for<br />
you, But I don't think it adds to my understanding of how<br />
7. knew they thought about it really. </p>
