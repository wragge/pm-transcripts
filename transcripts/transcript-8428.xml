PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
RADIO 2UE WITH ALLAN JONES<br />
27 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF CO: PY<br />
AJ: He has reinvigourated his Party, that was obvious on<br />
television, but he has thrown down the gauntlet to Dr<br />
Hewson, and injected a feeling amongst Australians that<br />
he must fight to preserve, that there is hope and<br />
vision around, which we need to both generate and<br />
exploit. Put simply he seems to be saying that<br />
currently the private sector is unsure of itself and<br />
therefore weak, so the Government will jump in and fill<br />
up that void' with a massive capital works program.<br />
They will change Australia's road and rail and ports,<br />
and in this way he says, aid exports. He seems to be<br />
saying that he knows that families are in trouble, so<br />
he is going to give them money from April 2 to help<br />
alleviate some of their problems. He seems to be<br />
saying that tourism and the motor vehicle industry are<br />
in strife, so he has provided tax relief for both of<br />
them. He seems to be saying the same things about the<br />
banks. And he seems to acknowledge, though not to the<br />
extent that I would have liked, the crisis in<br />
education. And he said the Commonwealth Government<br />
will fund entirely a $ 720 million program in technical<br />
and further education.<br />
But most importantly he is saying to Australians, and<br />
this is going to be the election issue, you can have<br />
tax cuts but you won't have to pay for it with a 15 per<br />
cent GST. By election time this is going to be a<br />
powerful point as Mr Keating bids to hang onto the job<br />
that Dr Hewson wants. </p>
<p>But some would say there are omissions, Australia is<br />
more than an economic entity, if we are to become ' one<br />
nation' as he called it last night, our 15-19 year olds<br />
have got to be treated as a critical resource and<br />
University structures may have to change. And if we<br />
are to be one nation you've surely got to be able to<br />
walk the streets and be free from being bashed up or<br />
made victims to violence and drugs. The dissolution<br />
within -our society isn't just a function of the<br />
economic downturn, but a function of emotional,<br />
psychological and attitudinal concern about where<br />
Australia is heading. Are we asking then too much of a<br />
Government to provide the answers to all of this? The<br />
Prime Minister is with me, Prime Minister good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning Allan.<br />
AJ: Could I just take that last point first, that we are<br />
not just an economic entity are we? What about the<br />
psychological and attitudinal problem of families, in<br />
relation to violence and drugs and those sorts of<br />
things?<br />
PM: The structure of our family relationships have changed<br />
over the years, there is no doubt about that. One<br />
can't explain the drugs phenomena well, but one thing<br />
is certain, that is if people have gainful employment<br />
it certainly helps their view of the world, it lets<br />
them believe they are part of society, they don't feel<br />
cheated or jilted by society. And I think that is why<br />
it is important, particularly for young people, for<br />
kids to give them an education and find them job<br />
opportunities, and you mentioned TAFE, it is one of the<br />
reasons, you see at the moment we have got now the very<br />
high retention rate in Year 12, we have got about eight<br />
children in ten completing Year 12, and while the<br />
university places have increased enormously in the<br />
not all kids can go to university and that's why<br />
we want to bring TAFE, up at least to give them<br />
technical and vocational training so they have got that<br />
practical training to get a job.<br />
AJ: But you have got a young son that might want to go to<br />
university and you will say to him, work your backside<br />
of f, and suddenly he doesn't make the numbers. Why<br />
couldn't you say, well we will re-orient our spending<br />
priorities of family and pay to send you, because we<br />
think at 21 you might be university material? We still<br />
can't do that yet in Australia can we?<br />
PM: As a private show you mean? Well we have got the Bond<br />
university, it's about our only private university, I<br />
think, but Allan can I just say this, that since about<br />
1987 the Government has created 120,000 university<br />
places. And the average university campus is about<br />
10,000, it is the equivalent of about 12 universities<br />
and we are pretty well on track for the proportion, </p>
<p>what we believe to be the optimum proportion of' kids<br />
coming into university from school by the year 2000, we<br />
are on track for that. But we are not on track for<br />
technical and further education.<br />
AJ: Well let:' s come to that question, you projected last<br />
night 80) 0,000 new jobs, 4 per cent growth rate and an<br />
$ 8 billion Budget deficit. If there is a critisism<br />
today of' those three figures, it may well that when<br />
consumers and business attitudes change, so to do the<br />
economic: models, lose their ability to predict. What<br />
if somet~ hing comes a stray and one of those doesn't<br />
come to pass, I mean your growth is going to pay for it<br />
you say, but what if the growth rates don't reach those<br />
levels?<br />
PM: Well it is a very conservative assumption. The year<br />
after the ' 82-' 83 recession, we had growth running at 6<br />
per cent over the course of the year. We have got to,<br />
in this forecast, 4 3/ 4, but there are so many more<br />
fundamentally good things around today than there were<br />
in 1983-84, for instance the inflation rate at 1 1/ 2<br />
per cent, not 10. The profit share will rebound<br />
rapidly as soon as volume and manufacturing and<br />
business picks up. We have got a competitive exchange<br />
rate, which we didn't have in ' 83-184. I mean, there<br />
are lots of things there, now which I think will<br />
indicate to me that the economy will respond more<br />
quickly than it did in ' 83-' 84, and therefore 4 3/ 4 is<br />
a reasonably conservative consumption.<br />
AJ: Could I just take two of those points, your arguing<br />
strong points, and they are technically inflation and<br />
interest rates. There are many who are listening to<br />
you now who know that because you have now committed<br />
yourself2 to keeping inflation low, that the value of<br />
some of their assets, either in shares or real estate<br />
or whatever, will be significantly eroded over what it<br />
once was.<br />
PM: Well not: really. You won't see the dash in real estate<br />
prices ' Like we saw between say, 1986-87, but the time<br />
before that was when 1979-80. So what happens is if<br />
you look at real estate prices you have a flash in<br />
prices and then nothing for six or seven years, another<br />
flash up in prices. What you will see I think with low<br />
inflation in Australia is a steady, generally inflation<br />
related increase in prices. So I don't really think<br />
people are going to find deflation as a problem.<br />
AJ: May inf: lation place money in more productive<br />
investments than the real estate industry has often<br />
been responsible for?<br />
PM: Well I -think what will happen is, low inflation, a<br />
proper ' tax system as we now have, and particularly with<br />
these very large depreciation rates for business which<br />
I announced last night, and the banks having being </p>
<p>burnt with real estate, I think you will see banks<br />
rationing our scarce national savings into the most<br />
productive places in the economy, and that's business,<br />
plant and equipment, the things that will actually<br />
provide the jobs you mentioned earlier, and make people<br />
wealthier. You can't draw wealth from sitting looking<br />
at a building built in the 1960s increasing in price,<br />
it is not doing anything for anybody, and in the end it<br />
doesn't do anything for the country.<br />
AJ: What about interest rates though? Many people<br />
listening to you right now say, he has cut interest<br />
rates, but in so doing that benefits the bloke in debt,<br />
not the bloke like me who has actually saved, he has<br />
actually cut my income in half.<br />
PM: Well the interest rates were up for a purpose, and that<br />
was to cut some of the crazy spending of the late<br />
1980s, -they couldn't always stay up there obviously.<br />
Lenders have not always had such rewards, but I think<br />
what has happened Allan, we have brought interest rates<br />
down at the same time inflation has come down rather<br />
sharply so, there is a bigger impact there for lenders<br />
than there was, but the real rate of interest, that's<br />
the rate of interest above the inflation rate will<br />
remain pretty constant. And the other thing is that<br />
people who are living on fixed incomes, or who are<br />
lending their money will find because of low prices,<br />
they don't need the higher income to survive.<br />
AJ: Can we say thought that we have enough incentive to<br />
save given that spending was one of our problems and<br />
that debt, is one of the issues facing us, is their<br />
enough incentive to save?<br />
PM: Well I think the big disincentive to save was inflation<br />
because it simply ripped away at the value of some<br />
monetary asset, but that has now changed, it is at very<br />
low levels and I think, sort of inflation and the tax<br />
system the reaction will actually now reasonably<br />
encourage people to save, and it means that people are<br />
not going to be desperate about running out to buy a<br />
property because they think the price is going to go<br />
sky rocketing tomorrow morning.<br />
AJ: Dr Hewson would say a consumption tax is a disincentive<br />
on spending and an opportunity for people to exercise<br />
their own decisions about concessionary income.<br />
PM: But they don't. But the fact is it's a discipline on<br />
spending it will lift the price of products, but there<br />
is not et commensurate return in the tax cuts, so<br />
therefore people are going to be worse off, therefore<br />
in my view they won't save. The savings device the<br />
Government is supporting is occupational<br />
superannuation, we have actually got in a way a<br />
mandatory savings system developing now. </p>
<p>AJ: Now are you going, I know there was nothing said about<br />
superannuation last night, I mean that given that debt<br />
and savings are two of the biggest issues, I mean how<br />
are we going to wind back a debt of about $ 135 billion<br />
which has to be stopped before it can be wound back,<br />
how are we going to do that?<br />
PM: Well, two ways. The first thing is to put a suture on<br />
it by making sure that our merchandise trade account<br />
performs better and that that current account deficit<br />
is lower. As we say in the papers we expect the debt<br />
to stabilise about ' 94-' 95.<br />
AJ: What will it be by then though?<br />
PM: Well it will roughly in the region where it is, maybe a<br />
bit morie. But the other thing about it is that it is<br />
private debt, it is basically debt which is financed<br />
upon projects and businesses able to service it, it is<br />
not sovereign debt of the South Americans variety where<br />
Governments borrowed the money without any basis for it<br />
being serviced. This is borrowed by the private sector<br />
of Australia, on plant and equipment, businesses,<br />
projects etc. And the other thing can I say, we have<br />
got $ 60 billion of private assets now off-shore. So<br />
that $ 130 odd billion of gross debt would be only<br />
had we n-. ot borrowed $ 60 billion to put $ 60 billion of<br />
assets abroad. In other words we are counter-weighing.<br />
PM: Well let's come to that counter-weighing then, the<br />
other counter-weighing is saving. We seem to have a<br />
very significant pool of national savings that you're<br />
building now through compulsory savings, which is<br />
called superannuation. You made concessions last night<br />
for busiLnesses under half a million to be 3 per cent by<br />
July 1 and progressively increasing that to the end of<br />
the decade. but Australians I suppose are saying, if<br />
this is our only national savings is it right that it<br />
should be invested in Texas oil wells and exporting<br />
jobs overseas, why shouldn't there be a commitment, not<br />
volunteering Government intervention here, but it is a<br />
Malaysian scheme which has really regenerated business<br />
by using those funds for the benefit of the<br />
superannuant and for small business.<br />
AJ: Well the savings come from three places, household<br />
savings, corporate savings, that's the savings of<br />
companies, and now superannuation. And we expect<br />
superannuation to be running at about $ 6-800 billion by<br />
the year7 2000, which is about 4 or 5 times our nationa.<br />
debt. So that savings balance and superannuation is<br />
critical. to Australia getting its sovereignty back<br />
completely over that debt situation.<br />
AJ: But you're not going to let the insurance companies and<br />
banks manage that are you? They made a mess of the<br />
other st~ uff. </p>
<p>PM: Well you have given them a decent old bagging there.<br />
Well what is happening we are seeing a lot of<br />
proliferation of funds management organisations now,<br />
managing that superannuation dollar, but you ask about<br />
money going off-shore, the tweak in the tax system we<br />
have to keep the money invested in Australia is a thing<br />
called dividend imputation. What is simply means is<br />
that we don't pay a tax credit to super funds if they<br />
pay tax to a foreign treasury, so if super funds want<br />
to invest in Germany or Britain or the United States<br />
and they pay tax to the German or British or American<br />
Treasuries, we don't give the super fund back here a<br />
tax credit. Therefore they balance very carefully,<br />
their investment in Australia, where they get tax<br />
credits and their investment out of Australia where<br />
they don't. That will guarantee that not too much of<br />
those superannuation savings are spent abroad.<br />
AJ: Yes I just wonder whether it prevents the double<br />
dipping though, I mean the purpose of your compulsory<br />
saving is that those people won't be dependent upon<br />
welfare in retirement. Can you be absolutely certain<br />
we are not going to be paying twice?<br />
PM: Well there will always be an interaction between, the<br />
basic retirement element in the system is the age<br />
pension, but there will be a more sympathetic sort of<br />
interface between superannuation earnings and the age<br />
pension. But the result will be that people will be<br />
better off and the Government will be able to afford<br />
the baby boom generation which will double the number<br />
of retired aged people.<br />
AJ: Just on that you are making compulsory a business payup.<br />
I am sure you are aware that Governments around<br />
this country have phenominal unfunded superannuation<br />
liabilities. My information is that the figure is<br />
about as high as $ 80 billion, in other words they<br />
aren't paying as they go. That doesn't appear as part<br />
of our national debt. But what are you going to do<br />
about making sure that Government continue to pay-up<br />
annually as indeed business must?<br />
PM: Well the award superannuation, or cumulation schemes<br />
where companies pay, some of the older superannuation<br />
schemes which existed before then, what you say is<br />
correct some of them are unfunded.<br />
AJ: So the Government is the employer?<br />
PM: The Government is the employer.<br />
AJ: And when it is the employer it sort of uses that money<br />
for something else, as an unfunded provision.<br />
PM: Government does not normally fund the provision, but<br />
again I don't think it is a problem for us. </p>
<p>7<br />
JONESts Just as many of your critics would have you believe<br />
that you're the person, that you're the reason that<br />
Australia is in a mess and, therefore, as I've said<br />
many times, perhaps you've been though we haven't<br />
known it -President of the United State., Prime<br />
minister of Britain, President of France and Prime<br />
Minister of Japan, because they're all in a moss.<br />
Equally given that you can't really be blamed for the<br />
economy entirely because the world problem has<br />
existed, how then can you say we can get out of it at<br />
a time that General Motors are saying.. shedding<br />
74,000 jobs, closing 21 plants, when Germany, Japan<br />
and France are all in strife. How can you say: " Well,<br />
I can quarantine Australia, what I've said last night<br />
is to pitch-fork us on to a recovery.* But so far it's<br />
been elusive for them?<br />
PM1 Well1, we missed the post war trade in goods and<br />
services. I meanf what happened to us was that we<br />
istayed with commodities f or 40 years too long. Now<br />
we're out there,' picking up our share of tourism, our<br />
ishare of manufactures the things we should have been<br />
doing. While it may be true that the rest of the<br />
world is growing slowly and, indeed, right now so are<br />
wfe, and they will pick up as we will. The fact of the<br />
matter isf we will get a bigger share of that trad in<br />
goods and services and, particularly in our region<br />
which is the f astest growing in the world. I mean,<br />
they're growing at in the countries around us<br />
where most of our trade is. I mean, we're not -trading<br />
most of our trade with the United States or Germany or<br />
Britain or France. We're trading it in the ASEAN/ Asia<br />
Pacific area.<br />
JONESt You've got a bit belted over the head for making that<br />
observation when the Queen was here. oc you have afty<br />
comment about that? You seen to be saying that we<br />
belong in the Asian region, and I'm not sure the Queen<br />
objected as much as some of your critics, but what<br />
essentially were you saying?<br />
PM: Well, I'm saying that 80% of our exports and I think,<br />
just off the top of my head, I think it's about 83% of<br />
our exports go to the Asia Pacific area and 70% of our<br />
kmports come from there. in other words, we're now a<br />
country trading with the Asia Pacific area. We're not<br />
a country trading with the European community or in a<br />
way of great substance with North America. we're<br />
trading with that part of the world but that does<br />
include North America. So, I'm simply making the<br />
point that we're lucky to be in the fastest growing<br />
part of the world. And that's why Australia can grow </p>
<p>a<br />
as little faster and that's why, I believe, we can do<br />
that and at the same time still run a healthy<br />
merchandised trade account.<br />
JONES: Well,, yesterday there were some good figures out on<br />
tikilled job vacancies. Now, do we have a capacity to<br />
fill those vacancies as they arrive or do we have to<br />
rely on migration. I mean, someone rang this morning<br />
and said: " Well, what is your view about migration?"<br />
If growth is something you're predicting, does this<br />
mean growth in migration number., where from and what<br />
sort of people?<br />
PM: Well, Alan, T think Australia.. migration generally<br />
has been good for the Australian economy, good for the<br />
Australian nation. That's the general policy.<br />
Governments have always reserved the right to raise or<br />
lower the quotas, as the intake, as economic<br />
conditions have dictated. we peaked at about 2.40,000<br />
migrants a couple of years ago. This year we're down<br />
to 111,000 and I think when our review comes in in<br />
April we'll be going lower. But the most important<br />
thing' is, Australia can grow faster and particularly<br />
with a larger population.<br />
JONES I Yeas, sure. Well, now, employers sometimnes say when<br />
they rcing heres " Why its it that the Government pays an<br />
unemployment benefit to a child or young person that<br />
its out of a job and gives us such limited incentives<br />
to employ them?" I suppose what they're saying is why<br />
would you pay the unemployment benefit to an employer<br />
and use that as a subsidy f or taking on an apprentice<br />
or: giving a kid a job?<br />
PM:. Exactly, and that's what we've done last night with<br />
Jobstart.<br />
JONES: Dcoes it go that far?<br />
PMe Yeah, it does. Because we pay it to employers, we got<br />
another 44,000, another 44,000 young people likely to<br />
pick up a Job under Jobstart and well,, young, young<br />
and old, we've increased funding to create additional<br />
job opportunities for up to 44,400 through wage<br />
subsidies to employers and to apprentices.<br />
JONES% But, see, the same thing applies to apprentices,<br />
doesn't it. I mean, if a kid wants to sort of do Arts<br />
or Pharmacy or Architecture, he gets automatically<br />
paid for by the Government via his entry to<br />
university. But if you're an appentice, you've got to<br />
fin~ d a willing employer to start with. And the </p>
<p>balance seems to be stacked ahead of the kind of skill<br />
that we need.<br />
PM: That's true. So, what we've done here, we've got<br />
funding in to assist the retention of indentured<br />
aipprentice.. That is, apprentices at risk, people who<br />
have already been indentured but might be put off in a<br />
recession. We've got funding there to keep them<br />
cn..( inaudible).. assistance to training groups<br />
schemes and reallocations of entry level training<br />
programmes. We're also trying to generally support<br />
that pre-vocational<br />
JONES&amp;. But the principal of what I'm saying you understand,<br />
don't you?<br />
PM: Oh, absolutely.<br />
JONESS If you want to do architecture, that's going to be<br />
funded for by the taxpayer. if you want to be a<br />
construction apprentice or an electrician, you've got<br />
to find a willing employer.<br />
PM: Exactly. And we've also got Jobtrain and Jobstart and<br />
these other labour market assistance progrannas which<br />
are about job skills. For instance, we've got another<br />
million on Jobskills which will provide 6 months<br />
of employment and training to young people. But in<br />
terms' of apprenticeships we've got this programme<br />
there to keep people at risk and, also, provide a<br />
further 10,000 pre-vocational training places from<br />
July, 1992.<br />
JONES: Just -on jobs: you saw in the Tasmanian election a<br />
diminution in the environmental vote, the green vote,<br />
by about 25%. This surely means that the public want<br />
jobs before I mean they want the environment as well<br />
but ' some sort of balance. I noticed that you seem<br />
to be resistant to Coronation Hill. Why is that when<br />
Gareth Evans said it was just a piece of clapped-out<br />
buffalo country and Bob Hawke found a spirit up there.<br />
I thought that you might have come in and said: " Look,<br />
this is nonsense, really." We gave a commitme~ nt to<br />
BliP, when yoU Were Treasurer, why not sort of got on<br />
with it and create some jobs and export income?<br />
PM: Well, it's a small mine. It's in the East Alligator's<br />
RiLver region. Look, that's the whole.. there's so<br />
much made of Coronation Hill. The concern of<br />
Coronation Hill, when you got to the bottom line, it<br />
wits in the Kakadu National Park area, catchmfent area.<br />
That was the big concern. It was a very small deposit </p>
<p>this small mine. Now we, as a Government, sort ofp<br />
you know, argued ourselves ragged over it and, finally<br />
decided to say And I think there's not point in<br />
c,. ontinuing that sort of debate for us. Therem's no<br />
point for the country, no point for us. it's better<br />
1to say ' that's it, a decision's been made, the<br />
Aboriginal commuunity has again written to us saying<br />
' please don't change your mind'. So, as far as I'm<br />
concerned, until the Aboriginal cozmuunity up there<br />
i: ake a decision themselves and they took expressly the<br />
opposite decision to say that they didn't want this<br />
area mined. And I think that's the end of it, I'd<br />
r: ather get on.. see, Alan, it's not stopping the bid<br />
projects being built. Look at Marandoo which is a<br />
large iron ore deposit. I mean, a real minep not a<br />
thimble-full of minerals. A real mine. We've let it<br />
go0.<br />
JONES: Just a quick one, before you go and we've got to<br />
take a newsbreak: you've given the banks, behind<br />
closed doors, a bit of plain speaking about what you<br />
expect from.. they were very significant inhibitors to<br />
continuing business recovery, if you could put it that<br />
way. we've had several callers here to say ' I've<br />
heard Mr Keating say this many times but I can tell<br />
you, it's not happening out there. We're not getting<br />
the money at the kind of price he thinks we're getting<br />
i~ t at'. Now, you've given very significant<br />
concessions to the banks in the Statement last night<br />
about bad lending and bad debts. How can you be sure<br />
that small business are actually getting what you<br />
think they're entitled to get?<br />
PM: Well, we've got.. the Treasurer had the banks in, said<br />
to them we want them to be sensible in their lending<br />
policies, we want them to be more ambitious than<br />
they've been they've got too frightened, too<br />
careful, too backward and we have put a very<br />
significant concession in there so they can partially<br />
wrrite off debts. So they don't have to send a<br />
business to the wall.<br />
JONES: But they'vd got what they wanted from you now..<br />
PM: They can partially write them off and what ure want<br />
them -to do is go back to lending to people, to those<br />
who need support.<br />
JONES2 And if they don't, will you withdraw, wi. ll you<br />
withdraw this thing which you've given them last<br />
n~ ight? </p>
<p>PM: Oh, I don't think we can withdraw it. But what we'll<br />
do is, we'll keep the pressure on them. But we've got<br />
a co=' tment from them that they'll do it. That<br />
they'll be easier with their lending. I think what's<br />
happening to them, Alan, is their books are running<br />
off too quickly. Their books are getting too small<br />
too quickly. I think they've overdone it themselves<br />
and they now realise they have.<br />
JONES: And then got frightened, do you think that?<br />
Pm: I think so. I think they know that the business they<br />
had in the Eighties, which might have been a bit<br />
hairy.. hairum scarum at the edges, is now actually<br />
contracting and they are concerned about the pace<br />
they're running off.<br />
JONES: There was a show you just cancelled a very quick one<br />
about Paul Keating and how tough he is. I moan, out<br />
there they actually think there's a whole heap of<br />
money being wasted. Taxpayers money. And we saw this<br />
project the other day, $ 200,000 to funld a<br />
revolutionary booklet. And Brian Howe withdrew it,<br />
and you had something to say about that sex diary, and<br />
so on. How tough is Paul Keating? He must see these<br />
anomalies out there: a waste of taxpayers' money on a<br />
range of fronts. Are you going to kick, continue to<br />
kick a few heads?<br />
PH: Well, in the Eighties we cut this place back by<br />
$ 313,000 million a year. And that's why in this<br />
package, that's why this package is affordable. I<br />
mean, when the times were good, we cut those big<br />
deficits back to a surplus. And now that times are<br />
dif ficult, this is the time to actually spend some<br />
money., So don't let John Hewson or anyone else<br />
says" This is not the time to give the economy a bit of<br />
the spend." it is.<br />
JONES: Good to talk to you. Thank you for your time.<br />
PH: Thank you, Alan.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister Keating.<br />
