PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 22 FEBRUARY, 1979<br />
INTERVIEW WITH SENATOR SUSAN RYAN: BENEFITS OF<br />
DOMESTIC SATELLITE<br />
2 2/ 2/ 7 9<br />
Senator Ryan:<br />
Well the Government's being very irresponsible about this<br />
whole proposal. They are allowing country people to believe<br />
that all sorts of communications services, telephone, education<br />
over the air, medical services, will be a part of the<br />
proposal when in fact they are not. They are things that<br />
could happen if the Government was prepared to spend money<br />
on them. To date, of course, the Government's main<br />
strateqy has been to reduce public expenditure in all<br />
those areas. Now they are expecting country people to<br />
believe there will be a massive input of public expenditure<br />
to provide the proqrams which satellite technoloqy could<br />
bring. Question: Why do you say that the public won't really benefit<br />
from domestic satellites?<br />
Senator Ryan:<br />
Because no case has been made that there will. Certainly<br />
big business interests will benefit from the facility to<br />
communicate data. Certainly if a media proprietor were<br />
to get a ndw commercial television network he would benefit<br />
enormously but what it would mean for country viewers is<br />
that one form of television would just be replacedby<br />
another. There wouldn't be more choice. There wouldn't<br />
be better quality and of course if regional broadcasters<br />
are put out of business that would exacerbate the<br />
unemployment in reciional centres. 00 </p>
