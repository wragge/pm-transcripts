A North Queensland firm has been selected for the supply<br />

The workboats will replace craft in use at various Service<br />
establishments throughout Australia, and will meet new<br />
requirements. Fifteen will be supplied to the RAN, and<br />

and stores, towing lighters, pontoons and buoys, training<br />
of clearance divers, and various other utility tasks.<br />
The design has been prepared by the Directorate of Naval Ship<br />
Design in the Department of Defence in Canberra. Features will<br />
include a 12m aluminium hull, and twin diesel engines.<br />
Navigation and lifesaving arrangements will be of a sufficient<br />
standard to permit short coastal passages. I<br />

ancillary equipment, will be J4.7 million. </p>
