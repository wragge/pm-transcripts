Julia Gillard and Federal Member for Chifley Ed Husic MP today visited the $8 million Mount Druitt Community Resource Hub in Dawson Mall.</p>
<p>The Hub will be partly powered by a commercial solar panel system as part of the Blacktown Solar City project. Once connected to the grid, the 32KW commercial system will generate clean solar electricity for the Mt Druitt Community Resource Hub, a centre that will house a library, cafe, study rooms and multi-purpose rooms for community use.</p>
<p>The Mt Druitt Hub is jointly funded by Blacktown City Council and the Australian Government under the Australian Government's Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program Strategic Projects 2010.</p>
<p>The solar panel system has been funded by Blacktown Solar City and is the sixth council building in Australia  to have a solar power system installed. </p>
<p>Blacktown Solar City is one of seven Solar Cities funded by the Australian Government under the $94 million Solar Cities initiative. The Solar Cities program is a partnership between governments, industry, businesses and local communities to trial sustainable energy solutions.</p>
<p>Each of the Solar Cities roll-out a range of solar and energy efficiency products and services within their communities, including:</p>
<p> * 	energy efficient appliance and lighting installations;<br />
 * 	home energy audits that recommend energy saving actions solar photovoltaic and solar hot water installations;<br />
 * 	 various pricing offers that encourage sustainable energy use; and<br />
 * 	educational campaigns that engage local communities on energy sustainability issues.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government understands that many families are struggling with the rising cost of electricity. Programs such as Solar Cities have already created clean energy jobs, reduced electricity costs for families while at the same time reducing emissions.</p>
<p>For example, since its launch in July 2007, Blacktown Solar City has contributed to an estimated $4.5 million in electricity savings to the residents of the Blacktown Local Government Area and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 25,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Solar Cities are just one of the many ways the Federal Government is investing in a clean energy future for Australia.</p>
<p>The recently expanded Low Carbon Communities  -  announced as part of the Government's Clean Energy Future Plan - will further assist local councils and communities to take-up the opportunities to reduce their energy costs.</p>
<p>Applications are expected to open before the end of year for the $200 million Community Energy Efficiency Program providing support, through competitive grants, for local councils and community organisations to improve energy efficiency in council and community-use buildings and facilities.</p>
