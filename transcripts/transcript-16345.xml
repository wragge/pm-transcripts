    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard today confirmed that the Australian Government is closely monitoring the fires in Port Lincoln and stands ready to provide assistance. </p>
<p>The damage and loss of property in Port Lincoln is particularly distressing for a community that was ravaged by fires only a few years ago. </p>
<p>Firefighters and local volunteers have done a fantastic job in bringing the blaze under control throughout the night and into today and are to be commended for their brave efforts. </p>
<p>Australian Government funding under national aerial firefighting arrangements has enabled the leasing of additional aircraft to fight the fires, supplementing existing state firefighting aircraft.</p>
<p>At this stage the South Australian Government has not requested additional assistance from the Australian Government. The Australian Government is ready to provide assistance under Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements should this be required. </p>
