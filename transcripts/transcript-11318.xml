    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, I'd like to thank my colleague David Kemp for that introduction.</p>
<p> To my other ministerial and parliamentary colleagues, and to the members</p>
<p> of the Youth Roundtable.</p>
<p>I simply want as Prime Minister to welcome you and to thank you for</p>
<p> participating in what is really a first as far as the national Government</p>
<p> is concerned. We decided on a roundtable as a method of distilling</p>
<p> some of the views of young Australians. I guess those members of the</p>
<p> roundtable here today have discovered what we Members of Parliament</p>
<p> discovered when we first came to this and the predecessor building</p>
<p> and that is that our strongly held views on particular issues must</p>
<p> be mixed with the equally strongly held views of our parliamentary</p>
<p> colleagues.</p>
<p>We will find out of the roundtable the great opportunity and stimulus</p>
<p> of hearing the varied views of young Australians. We are not looking,</p>
<p> nor are we expecting, a single voice from you on each and every important</p>
<p> issue. Rather, we recognise that you have been drawn from different</p>
<p> sections of the Australian community to reflect the tremendous diversity</p>
<p> of our nation. You gather, of course, at an increasingly exciting</p>
<p> time in Australia's history. You are fortunate, and we as Members</p>
<p> of Parliament are fortunate, that we have the opportunity to reflect</p>
<p> upon the past history of our country and also contemplate future opportunities</p>
<p> for our nation on an occasion where we are about to end one millennium</p>
<p> and start another. And where importantly for the Australian community</p>
<p> we are about to celebrate 100 years of the federation of Australia.</p>
<p> And as the months ahead of us go by all Australians both young and</p>
<p> old will increasingly feel a sense of history and a sense of participating</p>
<p> in some very memorable moments and some very memorable occasions.</p>
<p>Every generation of Australians, of course, is different. Every generation</p>
<p> of Australians is born into different circumstances and the current</p>
<p> generation of young Australians is no different in that sense. You</p>
<p> are born into a society which in so many ways is infinitely superior</p>
<p> to the society in which earlier generations were born. But also you</p>
<p> are born into a society which in other ways is very different and</p>
<p> in some respects less stable than earlier societies.</p>
<p>I am very much on the side of the optimists both about current generations</p>
<p> of Australians and about their future prospects. You almost uniquely</p>
<p> of the generations of this century are growing up, and have grown</p>
<p> up, reaching full adulthood at a time when there is a markedly less</p>
<p> ideological divide both throughout the world and within the Australian</p>
<p> community than used to be the case. You are, of course, the first</p>
<p> generation of Australians to benefit fully from the wonders of information</p>
<p> technology. And you will participate like no other Australian generation</p>
<p> as the years go by in the flow through benefits of that remarkable</p>
<p> epoch in the history and the experience of the world. You are also,</p>
<p> of course, participating in a world that has long since put behind</p>
<p> it issues related to nuclear annihilation . I perhaps even wonder</p>
<p> whether the issue has even come up in any of your discussions over</p>
<p> the last couple of days. Yet 15 years ago, indeed 10 years ago it</p>
<p> would have been almost inconceivable that a youth round table could</p>
<p> have taken place without that issue perhaps dominating all of the</p>
<p> discussions like no other. That is an example of some of the different</p>
<p> challenges that are faced. Today's young people of course are</p>
<p> very different from young people of earlier generations. Yet as in</p>
<p> all things there is a continuity.</p>
<p>There is a continuity of certain values. The importance we all place</p>
<p> on our families, the importance we place on our personal relationships,</p>
<p> the importance we place on job security, the importance we place on</p>
<p> a sense of fairness and a sense of decency and a sense of justice.</p>
<p> And as Australians we seek to find that in our different ways. We</p>
<p> approach it in different perspectives and you will have had displayed</p>
<p> before you over the last few days the different perspectives of both</p>
<p> the Government parties and the opposition parties.</p>
<p>But despite some of our different perspectives we do share a lot in</p>
<p> common. We do want a society of greater opportunity and greater hope.</p>
<p> I think young people are looking for believable solutions to problems.</p>
<p> I don't think any of us imagined that any government of any ideology,</p>
<p> or pattern of belief or thought has all of the answers to all of the</p>
<p> world's problems. I think our expectations about what governments</p>
<p> can realistically achieve are in better dimension now then perhaps</p>
<p> they were a generation ago. And increasingly I find young Australians</p>
<p> looking for believable, understandable solutions to tangible problems</p>
<p> and tangible challenges.</p>
<p>The young of Australia today of course are not the compulsive of joiners</p>
<p> of institutions and organisations that was the wont of their forebears.</p>
<p> And political parties are no different than other organisations in</p>
<p> having to work harder to attract active recruits. It is a challenge</p>
<p> faced by all organisations throughout Australia and I guess throughout</p>
<p> the western world.</p>
<p>Today's young Australians are also a group of people who delightfully</p>
<p> can keep their options open to the very last moment in a way that</p>
<p> earlier generations of Australians found far more difficult. And as</p>
<p> somebody who co-habitates with three young Australians who occupy</p>
<p> the age cohort represented by the members of the round table today,</p>
<p> none of the more remarkable of the experiences that I have on a daily</p>
<p> basis is the capacity of people in that age group to keep their options</p>
<p> on virtually anything open until the very last moment. And it is something</p>
<p> that I very greatly envy and I think members of older age cohorts</p>
<p> of Australians greatly envy.</p>
<p>Can I welcome all of you to the national capital. Can I express to</p>
<p> all of you as representatives of young Australia a simple pride in</p>
<p> my country and your country, a simple belief that Australia remains</p>
<p> without question the greatest country in the world in which to live.</p>
<p> A nation that has not been without its blemishes and a nation that</p>
<p> has not been without its grievous errors and its grievous mistakes.</p>
<p> But a nation that nonetheless is fairer, freer, more egalitarian,</p>
<p> more open hearted, and more fundamentally dec</p>
<p>ent, than any nation on Earth, and a nation which I know we are all</p>
<p> very proud to call our own. Thank you.</p>
