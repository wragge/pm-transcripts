    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sir, I think that every speech on an occasion like this ought to be,; in with a species of confassion, and my confession will begin kby the telling of a story which has a moral but it happens to be exactly ttw opposite moral from the owe that Itm supposed to<br />XG'ntLn I remomber, that man, years ago it must be mny years<br />ago. because I vas a lawyer mid quito respestablej I was a mw)<br />ber of the Bar' Oo~ ineil in the State of Victoria and a omplaint, had<br />been made against a rather wesl~ in member of the Bar. It qmme<br />before the Cinittee of Coumail and a very respected and respetable,<br />senior mamber or the iA r, who was present put his stol-eimi<br />spectacles on, looked at the rest of us, tok thm off, vithdzev his<br />chair 6 Inches from the airele and said " I want to make It quits<br />clear that the man about whom this coplaint is made is a man for<br />whom I don't oars, and therefore I declare myself disq Mlfod bF<br />bias and Iwiii take no further part in the proceedings'. He 0elsbrated<br />that br doing back another 6 inches but,, of course not ly<br />leaving the room. Those are the naosties of life. that I think<br />you all ought to orn to understant.<br />W* ell an this ocession I's disqualified Or bias. But It<br />Is the other ; in of biLas, because Lord and Lady do I&amp; Warr are<br />ervery old friends of mine. We have knweach other and if<br />ImySay 8o# liked each other for a quarter of a century. It is<br />oeof the hepwna things in myown life$ and In the life of my wife,<br />that vs should fa vs them : oth In Australia and that he,, a dubious<br />character ( Laughter) was once described tw a former Country Partr<br />colleagne of mine as the best pig-farmer In jroat Britain. And I<br />rembr being delighted to know that he was a very go04 pig.. fazmer<br />SI had no reason to doubt It but I was particularly pleased be.<br />cause in spite ofthat unpromising beginning he did not propose, a<br />stabilization scheme for pips. But really, we are old friends. I<br />couldn't tell you how delighted I an that he has orn out here, and<br />that he has come as Chairman of this 4reat Society.<br />You know It is a great mistake to take it for granted<br />that people take up posts of this kind just for' fun. They take up<br />r * to of this kind because they have something In them that tells<br />hem that this particlar thing is important. After all, my<br />firiend lord do I&amp; Warr at fiva, an I imagines esablishing the<br />Red Mban tuibe Mom a; the DelaWUTe Indians' always Imagined<br />that thoug&amp; the features haven't persisted as much as one might<br />have supposed has had a rich and varied experience of U1t. It<br />I saWo to you about his biograplW you would all be fasoinated. and<br />he as had a lot of experience of polities and he knows how pollticians<br />think. That is not a very easy thing to know. For exemplo,<br />the Oceissionar lpf Taxation over there, he doesn't know bow politicians<br />&amp; think, but we always know, or we think we knw, how he<br />thinks, which is perhaps all the more imprtant.<br />ilut Lord do la ia" r has really had a restarkable aii'rond<br />* xp-! rienoe of plitical. affairs and vtien I found that he was to be<br />Chairman of the Royal = CooWveaIth Society I can't tell you how<br />pleased I was because this is no task of theocqi this Is a task of<br />practice, of somebody who understands what's jo o n.<br />A" d so having discharjed my obligation to declare my biasj<br />as any Company Director, I believe, would the next thing I want to<br />say to you in that his arrival here and Uis mission around Australia,<br />helps to remind us, if we need to be reminded that the Crc eatho<br />this British ~ owath of owe, has ibeat thinga, we..<br />maxiable thiug stirring tishave happened to It and, In perticularp<br />have happened to it in the ladt l't or 15 years. And vs</p>
<p>2.<br />my easily find ourselves divided into two schools of thoughts<br />Those who sy 0" ell we know the old* Ran it changed?' and those<br />who say * We no-begin to understand the no which is quite diftbrent,<br />in 3507 ways, but which is enriched bor the meories and pr-4ctioes of<br />the past'. And this is the cwuoial question. Are wo to go on chan&amp;.<br />Ing an little as possible, being as reluctant as possible, or are we<br />to 2147 e " w we are, There are maydiffer enoes. There are<br />indeed s &amp; Aties different prsonal alleglanme but we are a re-<br />BaabU &amp; of. s nots'resembling too intimately the state<br />of affairs of 25 years agog or 50 years aip, or 75 years agop but<br />an association of countries with certain omn feelings and* as I<br />always hopes with certain oomon passions and faiths*. And If<br />that Is the position then the C I Mlt has not looked backex<br />cept to derive pride from Its past._-It looks for~ rard to see VLat it<br />can do for the world and in the world# not only in your lifetimes,<br />and am, but In the lifetimes of many# zany millions of people in<br />the future. And Lord de I&amp; darr is a Chairman who has that forward<br />looking mind; not anchoring himself by regret, buit propelling him.-<br />self bF a clear' vision of the future and that,, Sirs is th* second<br />reason why I'm delighted to see him.<br />And the third reason is really involved in the sooo.. I<br />rememiber a few years ago, I hop nobody will quote this against me,<br />though that wouldn't be a novelty, 9 but I remember saw years age<br />addressing a patriotic society in London and feeling rather horrified<br />by the fact that 9% of those present were old dodderers like me<br />fou sees this was a sort of old sen's and old womm's association.<br />We we" e all mietyrespectable people. We ocouLdn' t have been<br />better. Oie said the proper things and we listonodto the pror<br />things* The Stitish Commnwmealth is not an old ommuity. M Brit.<br />ish Ctath In point of faat, viewe In the eyes of historyis<br />one of the young, vigorous things in the world. [ et's pet that Into<br />our minds, True we've gone through a phase. We've seen all sorts<br />of chanoos, but It Is the future that matters. And I hope that one<br />of the results of i-ord do la Warr's visit to Australia will be that<br />all over thisContineat, and not least in Canberra, we will aee soores<br />and hundreds and thosands of young amn md young women who are<br />podto be British who have a sense of the destiny of the British<br />Coiaanealtt, wo, 2ill join this Society and work. in it and with it<br />so that our grand.. 4hildren m or two of whom already show a dispositIon<br />to be rather offensive so that our grandchildren wat be<br />heard to say in a few years' 1imZ ' Poor old follow. Bit of a G. M. t<br />orew' but vill coe to believe that they've Inherited something,<br />something of pride, something of responsibilityq something ef passion,<br />that means so much to the world. And for those three reasons, am<br />of bias, and the other two of reason, I = delighted, Sir, to acoept<br />your invitation to speak in support of this toast*.</p>
