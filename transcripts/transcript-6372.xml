FOR MEDIA 15 April 1984<br />
The Prime Minister today announced details of the ' visit to<br />
Australia of Mr. Naohiro Amaya, special adviser to the<br />
Minister of International Trade and Industry in Japan.<br />
Mr. Amaya arrived today for a visit of six days, which will<br />
include involvement in seminars in Canberra, Sydney and<br />
Melbourne on industry policy.<br />
He will meet Ministers, Commonwealth and State officials,<br />
business people, union leaders, academics and journalists.<br />
While in Canberra Mr. Amaya will have talks with the Economic<br />
Planning Advisory Council and the Caucus Industry<br />
Committee. ( Full itinerary attached)<br />
Mr. Amnaya has had a distinguished lifetime career in Japan's<br />
Ministry of Trade and Industry, culminating in the position<br />
of Vice-Minister for International Affairs from 1979-81. He<br />
was posted to Australia as counsellor at the Japanese<br />
Consulate in Sydney between 1962 and 1967.<br />
During his visit to Japan in February Mr. Hawke had discussions<br />
with Mr. Amaya on Japanese industry policy.<br />
Mr. Hawke said he was pleased that Mr. Amnaya was able to visit<br />
Australia to explain the Japanese industrial experience to all<br />
sections of the Australian community.<br />
Mr. Hawke said the Government hoped that Mr. Amaya's visit would<br />
encourage informed debate on future directions for Australian<br />
industry policy and its means of implementation. This would<br />
contribute to developing consensus in Australia on longer term<br />
industry objectives and policies for structural adjustment.. </p>
