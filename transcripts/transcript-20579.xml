    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australian Test opener Justin Langer will lead the Prime Minister's XI in an historic day-night match against the ATSIC Chairman's XI in Adelaide on Friday 21 March.</p>
<p>Indigenous batsman Matthew Bradley will lead the ATSIC Chairman's XI for the third consecutive year.</p>
<p>The day-night fixture will create cricket history as the first Prime Minister's XI match to be played on Adelaide Oval and the first Prime Minister's XI game to be played under lights.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to again be hosting this annual contest for the Johnny Mullagh Trophy," Mr Howard and Mr Clark said today.</p>
<p>"This year will be an opportunity for the South Australian community to be a part of cricket history when the match is played under a new format at Adelaide Oval for the first time," they added.</p>
<p>Canberra's Manuka Oval has staged the match for the past two years.</p>
<p> Adelaide becomes the first city outside the nation's capital to host the event following the decision to take the game around Australia.</p>
<p>Mr Howard said the match was a way for all Australians to celebrate the spirit of cricket.</p>
<p>"From its inception in 2001, the match has provided an opportunity for young Australian cricketers to display their talents to the nation," the Prime Minister said.</p>
<p>"The event provides a wonderful platform to continue to promote reconciliation and national goodwill.</p>
<p>"Adelaide Oval has excellent playing facilities and the keen support from the South Australian Cricket Association to host the match is very much appreciated."</p>
<p>Mr Clark said the new format of the match would add to the excitement of bringing the teams together again.</p>
<p>"The Indigenous side won the inaugural match in 2001, and the Prime Minister's side won last year, so I think this year's game will be keenly contested," Mr Clark said.</p>
<p>"The new 50-over playing format will enhance the event and should provide some top cricket action for the South Australian public.</p>
<p>"The match is a great chance for Indigenous people to show that they can achieve anything given the right opportunities and a level playing field," added Mr Clark.</p>
<p>Australian Cricket Board (ACB) Chief Executive Officer James Sutherland said the match was an important part of the ACB's commitment to developing Indigenous cricket.</p>
<p>"Following the success of the fixture over the past two years, the match continues to attract and develop a healthy profile around the country," said Mr Sutherland.</p>
<p>"The ACB is dedicated to ensuring cricket is increasingly accessible to Australia's Indigenous people and this match helps establish a profile for the game at this level.</p>
<p>"The event showcases the talent of Australia's young Indigenous cricketers as well as some of Australia's finest first-class cricketers, and we look forward to an entertaining match," said Mr Sutherland.</p>
<p>The players selected for the respective teams are as follows:</p>

<p>  Langer will captain a side boasting some of Australia's best young first-class cricket talent and representatives from Australia's 2002-03 under-19 team.</p>
<p> Victorian left-hand batsman Matthew Harrison joins Australian under-19 team mate Mark Cosgrove in the side for the first time. South Australian Cosgrove was the leading run scorer at the Commonwealth Bank Under-19 Championship Series in December.</p>
<p>Western Australian Dominic Treacy and Queensland's Barry Weare make up the Indigenous representation in the Prime Minister's side.</p>
<p> The ATSIC Chairman's XI includes seven members of last year's team, as well as New South Welshman Daniel Christian who played in the Prime Minister's team which clinched victory and the coveted Johnny Mullagh trophy in 2002.</p>
<p>ATSIC Chairman's XI captain Bradley took man-of-the-match honours in last year's game despite his team's eight-wicket defeat. Bradley scored an unbeaten 74 runs from 90 balls.</p>
<p> Entry to the match is free, with a gold coin donation at the gate. Half the money raised from entry will be donated to assist victims of October's Bali tragedy, while the remainder will help fund Indigenous cricket programs in South Australia.</p>
