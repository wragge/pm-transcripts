FOR PRESS: CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Holt; has received many<br />
hundreds of congratulatory messages from all parts of Australia and<br />
overseas since his Government's success in last Saturday's election.<br />
The congratulations within Australia have come from<br />
people, young and old alike, in all walks of life. They range from<br />
students and those who have described themselves as " ordinary<br />
housewives" to diplomatic and government representatives.<br />
Messages have been received from many prominent<br />
people overseas, and already there are congratulatory cables and letters<br />
from eleven heads of government.<br />
The heads of government who have sent their good wishes<br />
are the Presidents of the Philippines and the United States, and the Prime<br />
Ministers of Canada, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Malta, Malaysia, New<br />
Zealand, Viet Nam and Western Samoa. In addition, there have been<br />
messages from other senior members of national administrations.<br />
