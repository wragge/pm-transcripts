    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Cabinet has today considered and agreed in principle to a request</p>
<p> from the United States to participate in an international coalition</p>
<p> should military action against Iraq become necessary.</p>
<p>Our aim in doing so is to help enforce the UN Security Council's</p>
<p> resolutions, ensure that Iraq's chemical and biological arsenals</p>
<p> are not used or expanded, and prevent Saddam Hussein again becoming</p>
<p> a threat to the security of the Middle East and the world.</p>
<p>The Government sincerely hopes that military force will not be necessary</p>
<p> and that Iraq will respond to the clear message it is being given</p>
<p> that the international community expects it to adhere to its UN obligations.</p>
<p> The Government will continue to apply all possible diplomatic resources</p>
<p> to efforts to achieve this.</p>
<p>If Iraq refuses, however, the Government believes that Australia's</p>
<p> national interests and the interests of the international community</p>
<p> in preventing Iraq from using and further developing its chemical</p>
<p> and biological arsenal are so great that Australia should support</p>
<p> military action against Iraq. We also believe that President Clinton</p>
<p> should be supported in the leadership he is showing on this issue.</p>
<p>The Government takes this decision only after very careful consideration</p>
<p> of all the issues involved. The risk to any Australians who might</p>
<p> be engaged in supporting any military action is one of the most serious</p>
<p> of these issues.</p>
<p>But Iraq's defiance of UN Security Council resolutions requiring</p>
<p> it to destroy its weapons of mass destruction and accept UN inspections</p>
<p> by the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) has to be a matter of the gravest</p>
<p> concern for Australia and all other members of the world community.</p>
<p>Iraq has consistently frustrated the efforts of the United Nations</p>
<p> to identify and destroy chemical (CW) and biological (BW) weapons</p>
<p> and ensure such weapons are not developed in the future. It has repeatedly</p>
<p> been found to have lied about its capabilities. Iraq's refusal</p>
<p> to permit UN inspectors to do their work can only exacerbate the concerns</p>
<p> of the international community about its capabilities and intentions.</p>
<p>Iraq's CW and BW programmes were vigorous and determined and</p>
<p> we know that Iraq maintains such weapons and the capability to produce</p>
<p> them. Iraq has a record of using such weapons against its own people</p>
<p> as well as its neighbours. There are good grounds for fears that Iraq</p>
<p> may still have operational missiles with chemical and biological warheads,</p>
<p> as well as artillery shells and bombs. According to UNSCOM, precursors</p>
<p> which could produce hundreds of tonnes of CW and BW agents, such as</p>
<p> the nerve agent VX are not accounted for.</p>
<p>Unless UNSCOM inspectors are allowed to do their work, Iraq will keep</p>
<p> the capacity to threaten its neighbours. The use by Iraq of this material</p>
<p> would have devastating human consequences and have incalculable consequences</p>
<p> for the security of Iraq's neighbours and the Middle East as</p>
<p> a whole.</p>
<p>If UN inspections do not continue or Iraq is not otherwise prevented,</p>
<p> Iraq will be free to develop more of these weapons and the means of</p>
<p> delivering them.</p>
<p>Australia may be beyond the reach of Iraq's missiles. But we</p>
<p> have a direct national interest in ensuring that these weapons do</p>
<p> not proliferate and that the mechanisms established by the international</p>
<p> community to prevent this are as effective as possible. There can</p>
<p> be no doubt that allowing Iraq to flout its obligations will increase</p>
<p> the risks for the rest of the world including Australia.</p>
<p>Any military action would be designed to force compliance with UN</p>
<p> Security Council resolutions and prevent Iraq from building its CW</p>
<p> and BW capability and the means of delivering it.</p>
<p>It would be designed to avoid to the maximum extent possible any civilian</p>
<p> casualties within Iraq. But it would be unrealistic to rule out the</p>
<p> possibility. That is why, the Government would encourage the Iraqi</p>
<p> Government to conform to UN resolutions and make the use of force</p>
<p> unnecessary.</p>
<p>The sort of contribution the Government is discussing with the United</p>
<p> States includes up to a company from the Special Air Service regiment</p>
<p> to support, for example, US search and rescue activities; two Boeing</p>
<p> 707 tanker aircraft to provide air-to-air refuelling and specialist</p>
<p> personnel to provide back-up in medical and technical support. Support</p>
<p> of this kind could involve up to 200-250 people.</p>
<p>It is possible that the situation will require a different sort of</p>
<p> contribution. The Government would be prepared to consider providing</p>
<p> other capabilities of a similar order.</p>
<p>As I have undertaken to do so already, I will continue to keep the</p>
<p> Australian public as fully informed of developments as possible. I</p>
<p> have advised the Leader of the Opposition of the Cabinet's decision.</p>
<p>I emphasise that the Government very much hopes that a peaceful solution</p>
<p> can be found. No one wants force used or lives put at risk.</p>
