TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JOHN JOST, RADIO<br />
27 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOST: What are the odds of an election before Christmas?<br />
PM: I don't think there'll be an election before Christmas.<br />
I've been fairly consistent about this. I've always tended<br />
towards 1990. I've got no reason to change that.<br />
JOST: Has the Liberal tax policy sort of helped confirm<br />
that feeling?<br />
PM: No. I think the Liberal tax policy the more it's<br />
unfolded and all its implications understood it's going to<br />
be a minus for them, a plus for us. I suppose in that sense<br />
the more time we've got to expose that the better.<br />
JOST: Still they do seem to be on a rise at the moment the<br />
Liberals. This tax package, especially the child care<br />
rebate seems to<br />
PM: Which one? Which package are you talking about? We've<br />
had three in this week. I mean they are constantly changed.<br />
They change their child care package about as constantly and<br />
consistenly as they change their leadlership. So we're not<br />
quite sure. Now we've got the additional change revealed in<br />
this morning's press that they're saying that they're not<br />
going to index the benefits for lower to middle income<br />
people that we've brought in. Something which they'd been<br />
saying before they did. Chaney said yesterday yes we're<br />
going to continue to do that and Peacock's office said no<br />
that's not the position. I mean what is their package?<br />
JOST: Well let's say they may be, concede that they may be<br />
sort of a little bit vague on the course they're on, which<br />
is what you're suggesting. But nevertheless the course that<br />
they're on seems to have been greeted out there in the<br />
community with a fair * amount of interest.<br />
PM: Sure, I think that it was inevitable it's going to be<br />
greeted with interest. After all when you've been waiting<br />
for six and a half years for something you're going to be<br />
interested in what pops out because they've been promising<br />
for so long. And I'm not surprised at the beginning when<br />
you see stories about rather largish handouts that people<br />
will have some interest in that. But each passing day has<br />
revealed these things, changes in what they are proposing.<br />
There've been three changes in what they are proposing. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
There've been three changes now in what they've been saying<br />
about child care. it's now revealed yesterday that they've<br />
got a changed position in regard to indexing, maintaining<br />
the real benefits of these family allowances. And of course<br />
what's also been revealed is the total unfairness of the<br />
package which is going to give back literally billions of<br />
dollars under the abolition of capital gains tax to the<br />
Federal President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, and<br />
his ilk. That's what's involved for one per cent of<br />
taxpayers. They're going to give back through time billions<br />
of dollars which would be collected for families to be able<br />
to be paid on education and those sorts of things. But<br />
they're going to give it to the few who don't need it and in<br />
the process distort the whole pattern of economic investment<br />
decision taking in this country. As those sort of things<br />
come out the reaction will be devastating for the<br />
Opposition. JOST: If only one per cent of the country are being<br />
affected by the capital gains taxes though, as you say, are<br />
the other 99% really going to worry about it much?<br />
PM: Of course they are because if you are in a situation<br />
where billions of dollars are going to be given back out of<br />
the public revenue to the one per cent, that means that you,*<br />
the 99%, are not going to have those billions of dollars<br />
available in the Commonwealth revenue for payment on your<br />
education, your roads, your bridges, your defence, or for<br />
the lowering of taxation. Of course the 99% are going to be<br />
worried. JOST: You have to explain that though don't you?<br />
PM: It's not very difficult to explain.<br />
JOST: Ok, but coming back-<br />
S PM: I accept that. You're quite right. Yes.<br />
JOST: Coming back to working families. After all if both<br />
parents work and that's the way most people get by these<br />
days they do deserve some sort of a break. And a very<br />
measurable break is a bit of assistance with child care.<br />
PM: And when the period comes which has really started when<br />
we have to compare what we've done for families, whether<br />
they're two income or one income families, we will literally<br />
kill the Opposition. I know you haven't got much time now<br />
but I'm prepared to give you a dry run on the comparison if<br />
you like.<br />
JOST: That's alright. I was going to ask, my next question<br />
was when do you go to the polls, when you do go to the polls<br />
will you be making some offers to the electorate? You can<br />
do it now if you like. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: No, I don't think we need to be making offers. I mean<br />
I'm quite happy at this point to compare two things. The<br />
record of what we've done in our six and a half years in<br />
office with what they did. Let's just give something that<br />
goes right to the heart of the family. Under the Libs when<br />
they walked out of office in regard to education, because<br />
they weren't getting the money from the wealthy in this<br />
country, because they allowed tax avoidance to be the<br />
fastest-growing industry in the country, they didn't have<br />
the money to spend on education. That meant that only 36%<br />
of our kids were staying on in school. Now because we've<br />
reformed the taxation system and made the wealthy pay their<br />
fair share of tax we have been able to get a situation now<br />
where 58% of our kids have stayed on in school. In their<br />
period they created 26,000 additional places in the tertiary<br />
system. By the time we get to 1992 we'll have created<br />
150,000. And at the same time reduce the levels of tax.<br />
They walked out of office with a top tax rate of 60 cents in<br />
the dollar. We've brought it down now very considerably as<br />
you know to 47 and the lowest rate we've brought down from<br />
to 20. So you've got all these things done because we're<br />
dinkum about tax. making the wealthy pay their share.<br />
We've been able to pay that out then in additional<br />
educational facilities, additional family allowances indexed<br />
for those in the community most in need. But they want to<br />
go back to the same old system, let the wealthy not pay,<br />
give it all back to them and then make those in the<br />
community who are most needy pay the bill. That's crazy.<br />
JOST: But they're still talking about, down the line, a<br />
lower tax rate for everyone aren't they. You can't really<br />
rely permanently on the last Liberal government.<br />
PM: No, but what you can do is rely-on an analysis John of<br />
what they are saying now. Their sums'simply do not add up.<br />
They have been shown now to have a fiscal hole of the best<br />
part of a billion dollars. In other words that means<br />
they're going to have a looser fiscal policy than us if they<br />
stick with what they are doing now. They have a wages<br />
policy which will be disastrous because they'll just have a<br />
series of pilots' disputes all over the place. They're<br />
going to say to the strong you go out and you bargain with<br />
your employers and if you can screw them, screw them. If<br />
it's 20% or 25 or 30% you can get, that's alright. So that<br />
will blow wages through the roof. What happens to interest<br />
rates then? They go through the roof. If you leave all<br />
that in that situation you're gone. I mean they just can't<br />
make that sort of scenario work. All economic analysts now<br />
Are just looking at this and saying it doesn't fit together.<br />
In that situation what they say now about what they'll do on<br />
tax simply cannot be taken for granted. They will not be<br />
able to live with this unco-ordinated set of gimmicks which<br />
they are going to call an economic action plan. They call<br />
it an economic action plan. There's no commentator in this<br />
country who thinks it's an economic action plan. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
JOST: They call the Accord a gimmick.<br />
PM: Well you see I would rather take the statement of say<br />
of Michael Camdessus. He is the Executive Director of the<br />
International Monetary Fund. He came here last year. He<br />
said the man who examines the economy of every country in<br />
the world he said of the Accord that this had been<br />
centrally important. He praised it. He recommended it to<br />
other countries because this enabled a government to have<br />
another arm of policy, wages policy. Look, we don't have to<br />
be John just theoretical about this. I just ask you to go<br />
back to 1981-82 because that's when they were last in office<br />
and when they applied this policy. They said we don't like<br />
the centralised wage system. They brought it to an end and<br />
they let people go off and bargain. The transport workers<br />
did it. And wages blew out by what 18%. What happened<br />
then? We had the worst recession in 50 years. Another<br />
quarter of a million thrown onto the unemployment scrapheap.<br />
So don't let's be theoretical. They are promising now what<br />
they had then.<br />
JOST: Isn't it crazy though that the Accord is the only way<br />
you can stop that sort of thing happening. That's what you<br />
would argue. And the Accord does distort the pattern of<br />
wages in the country.<br />
PM: On the contrary. It doesn't.<br />
JOST: The pilots would disagree with that.<br />
PM: I mean if you say that it stops pilots getting 30%, yes<br />
it distorts the pattern of wages.<br />
JOST: But that was their opening claim. Let's face it.<br />
PM: And, not only their opening claim but they varily<br />
believe that that's what they would get. Why? Because they<br />
looked at history. They looked<br />
JOST: Three weeks later did they believe it?<br />
PM: I don't know what they believe. All I'm saying is that<br />
they were entitled on their reading of history, which was<br />
pre-Accord history, to believe it. Because you know that<br />
every time before the Accord what had happened was they put<br />
their claim up and it was only a matter I mean you tossed<br />
the coin. Who was going to give in first? Ansett or TAA as<br />
it was then. They didn't realise it was a different world<br />
under the Accord. So your'e right in saying that the Accord<br />
distorts wage fixation if by that you mean it puts a break<br />
upon the powerful being able to rape the community. Because<br />
that's what would happen under the opposition.<br />
JOST: You might be able. to argue with that with the pilots.<br />
But the fact is that that sort of distortion probably goes<br />
. into every workplace, on every factory floor, in every shop<br />
in the country. </p>
<p>PM: If you talk about distortion let's just look at what<br />
you mean by distortion. Under this so-called distortion we<br />
have created over one and a half million new jobs in this<br />
country as a result of this wages policy, what you call this<br />
distorting wages policy. That's a rate of job creation five<br />
times faster than under the Opposition when they were in<br />
government and it's a rate of job creation more than twice<br />
as fast as the rest of the world. So the word distortion is<br />
crazy with respect to you. What it means is that the trade<br />
union movement has agreed to modify their claims for<br />
money-wage increases, accept reward for an improvement in<br />
the social wage, through improvements in Medicare, education<br />
and those sorts of things which are non-cost to their<br />
employers but which are benefits to them. And in that way<br />
we've been able to employ five times as many more people in<br />
terms of rate of growth than under the Libs when they were<br />
in with no wages policy. And if you call that distortion I<br />
know which sort of distortion I'd like to have.<br />
O JOST: One of the things that appears to people, to some<br />
people, about this whole question of the Accord relates to,<br />
it boils back to the inflation question. You get this<br />
situation, it looks like a round robin. We get five or six<br />
per cent in wages, we have an inflation rate that seems to<br />
be just built in at six to eight per cent and they just seem<br />
to chase each other permanently.<br />
PM: It just isn't the case. Because if you watch the<br />
position that you had before the inflation rate when we came<br />
to office was 11%. That's because you didn't have a wages<br />
policy under the other mob. When you had wages blowing out<br />
by 18% as they did under them of course inflation went out.<br />
we reduced inflation dramatically. It's now down to eight<br />
per cent. Of course what we are paying for still is the<br />
result of the depreciation that occurred in ' 85-86 and plus<br />
there's some more immediate factors th-is year. We're still<br />
getting the impact of the flood. But in fact under this<br />
wages policy you've significantly reduced the rate of<br />
inflation from that we inherited. It was at 11% that we<br />
inherited. We got the underlying rate of inflation down<br />
before the collapse in commodity prices. We'd got the<br />
underlying inflation rate down to five per cent.<br />
JOST: Yes, but that was sort of, there was a bit of an<br />
adjustment to Medibank there wasn't there?<br />
PM: No, Medibank out. Medibank out. We had got the<br />
underlying rate of inflation down to five per cent.<br />
JOST: And we've got eight per cent now. It's a lot more<br />
than our trading partners.<br />
PM: It is. And it's a lot less<br />
JOST: come down? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: It's a lot less than we inherited too. It's a lot less<br />
than 11%.<br />
JOST: That's six or seven years ago.<br />
PM: Well, that's what we inherited under their system.<br />
Under their system you could be guaranteed that you'd get<br />
back into double digit inflation immediately. Now I'm not<br />
avoiding your question. We believe that, as we said at the<br />
time of the budget, it will be in the second half of the<br />
financial year that the rate of inflation will start to move<br />
down. I believe the next two quarters will be at lower<br />
rates than this one now.<br />
JOST: How much lower?<br />
PM: I would think that the inflation rate will be, by the<br />
end of this year as we've said in the budget, will be down<br />
to the order of seven per cent. Certainly down below what<br />
it is now, or better.<br />
JOST: what do you reckon interest rates will be on June<br />
PM: I'm not saying that because we are in a position where<br />
the level of demand in the economy is much higher than<br />
either Government or private sector economists thought at<br />
the beginning of this year. Therefore our policies must now<br />
be directed towards getting that rate of demand down to<br />
levels which give us sustainable rates of import. Now we'll<br />
keep monetary policy tight as long as is necessary to<br />
achieve that but not one day longer than is necessary.<br />
JOST: I might add I've got a listener here who's just rung<br />
in with this question. It's not a bard question actually.<br />
' Who was the President of the ACTU whin wages, the Secretary<br />
of the ACTU when wages blew out under -the other mob?'<br />
PM: I was a Member of Parliament in ' 81. I'd gone into the<br />
Parliament in 1980. But let me say to this listener. I<br />
thank, I might have paid them for the question. When I was<br />
President of the ACTU and this will be confirmed by people<br />
on the other side I pleaded with Mr Fraser, pleaded with<br />
them to change their wages policy. I said this is silly<br />
that you're putting us into a position where we've got to go<br />
out and use our muscle, get as much as we can in the market.<br />
It's much more sensible I said to him that we don't have<br />
that sort of position. So that's what I argued when I was<br />
President of the ACTU. But they wouldn't listen to me. I<br />
said well if that's your way well then we've got no<br />
alternative. But I wasn't President of the ACTU during that<br />
blow-out.<br />
JOST: Fair enough. Coming back to that interest rate<br />
thing. A major criticism that's made by a lot of economists<br />
in this country is that we are relying too much on interest<br />
. rates, that that's it. it certainly looks like that..<br />
like that to the average-folk out there... </p>
<p>PM: Let me just tell you what the facts are. There are<br />
three arms I mean I hate sounding like a Professor of<br />
Economics but your question demands it. There are three<br />
arms of policy. There's fiscal policy-<br />
JOST: Yes.<br />
PM: There's wages policy and there's monetary policy. You<br />
say we're just relying on monetary policy. Let's look at<br />
what's happened to fiscal policy. I'll just give you the<br />
facts. It's the tightest it's been in the 35 years that<br />
statistics have been recorded. Just 1o'ok at the facts.<br />
Four successive years, real reductions in Commonwealth<br />
outlays. Never been done before. Third year in a row of a<br />
Commonwealth surplus. The public sector borrowing<br />
requirement in the period of office, been a turn around of<br />
eight percentage points. There's now in surplus. That is<br />
all public authorities are in total not making a net demand<br />
upon savings. Now those three things have never happened<br />
before in the 35 years. So fiscal policy therefore as tight<br />
as it's ever been.<br />
JOST: Alright that fiscal policy<br />
PM: Wages policy we've gone through, tighter before. Just,<br />
there it is. You can see.<br />
JOST: We're looking at a graph here.<br />
PM: We're looking at a graph here. There's the whole<br />
answer. The straight line is the measure of the level of<br />
activity, it's over time. When it goes up the economy is<br />
operating at its peak. Now what's happened in the past,<br />
this is from June ' 68 up to when we c-ame to office.<br />
Activity goes up, wages blow up, into recession. Activity<br />
up, wages up, recession. It happened every time. There it<br />
was. The worst recession ever for 50 years before we came<br />
in. Activity up, wages blew out, you see there. What's<br />
happened here under us? Wages flat, activity up, wages<br />
flat.<br />
JOST: But it's still<br />
PM: wages tight.<br />
JOST: But it still must be a disappointment to you then if<br />
you can keep, on the basis of that document, that the<br />
economy really isn't doing a little bit better isn't it?<br />
PM: But the problem John is the economy is doing too well.<br />
I mean I'm not saying that in terms of people are not<br />
JOST: Well where's the growth then, the real productivity<br />
growth in the country? </p>
<p>PM: The rate of growth has been double what it was before.<br />
The average rate of growth under this Government has been<br />
over four per cent in real terms. But because we've had<br />
such an enormous increase in employment, which is as I say<br />
five times the rate of employment growth before, then that<br />
doesn't show up in high rates of productivity growth. It's<br />
shown up in more people in jobs. we are creating jobs<br />
faster than ever before. If you've got employment going up<br />
like that then productivity, which is a measure of the<br />
relationship between output and employment, if your<br />
denominator is going up then your productivity rate of<br />
growth isn't so high.<br />
JOST: Can I just go back to a little bit of unreconstructed<br />
economics. PM: Sure.<br />
JOST: And that is back to the interest rates. We're using<br />
interest rates to try and contain spending. I mean do you<br />
ever think that it might be very handy if you could ring up<br />
the banks or ring up the Reserve Bank and say call in a few<br />
SRDs the way you used to in the old days and literally put<br />
your loans on a quota basis rather than using interest<br />
rates. In other words just make people queue up for their<br />
money, pay a less rate but not have than much money in the<br />
system? PM: What you're saying is do you want to have a freed up<br />
financial market or a regulated one? Quite obviously the<br />
trends around the world, and correctly, is for a freeing up<br />
of market forces. I mean it's not only happening in the<br />
western world but it's happening in the eastern bloc as<br />
well. The great benefits that we've -got John from freeing<br />
up the markets is essentially in terms of employment and<br />
growth. We've doubled the rate of growth of the previous<br />
period and there is now, as you know, a situation where<br />
people want to get a job they can get it now, which was not<br />
what we had before. Now that's the important thing. But<br />
we've got to shade off that rate of growth until we can get<br />
a position where we can pay for the levels of imports with<br />
that rate of growth. So the secret which we're going to<br />
achieve is bringing down the rate of growth somewhat so that<br />
there's not so many imports coming in that we can afford but<br />
still at such a rate of growth that we'll employ the people<br />
coming onto the labour market. And we are uniquely well<br />
placed to do that. I wouldn't have interest rates, as I've<br />
said to you before, higher for one day longer than<br />
necessary. But we've got to do that because if we eased off<br />
with interest rates there's only one thing that would<br />
happen. What would happen then is that activity would just<br />
explode more. You would have more imports coming in and<br />
then you really would have to belt the hell out of the<br />
economy. We're not going to do that. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
JOST: John Howard is coming back on the Liberal frontbench.<br />
It looks as though he's going to take over a portfolio<br />
that's responsible for microeconomic First up your<br />
reaction to John Howard's return.<br />
PM: I'm glad he's coming back on the frontbench.<br />
JOST: It's a waste of talent having him on the backbench?<br />
PM: Of course it is. You look at that frontbench that<br />
they've got there now. They know themselves it's a joke.<br />
It's a joke to have in terms of relative talent he should<br />
be there. I'm glad he's coming back, Unqualifiedly glad<br />
that he's going back on the frontbench. He should never<br />
have been dumped and put on the back. And of course if he's<br />
going to be in charge of microeconomic reform that will be<br />
interesting too. Because we might ask him some questions<br />
why in all the period that you were there Mr Howard as<br />
Treasurer, why didn't you do anything about microeconomic<br />
reform at all?<br />
JOST: He might ask you the same question.<br />
PM: And I'll have the answers and he won't. Because they<br />
did nothing and we have done more<br />
JOST: You've done a little bit lately.<br />
PM: Not a little bit lately. what do you think about<br />
starting in ' 83 with the deregulation of the whole banking<br />
and financial system? Wasn't that a massive piece of<br />
micro-economic reform? Just right bang at the beginning.<br />
JOST: I'm thinking of ones like the * transport industry and<br />
the waterfront etc.<br />
PM: Ok, who made the decision, who made the decision, I<br />
mean the two airline system? We did. I mean the two<br />
airline system was the creation of John Howard and his<br />
conservative mates. We've brought it to an end.<br />
JOST: We don't have much of an airline system at the<br />
moment. PM: I would say that what we're doing at the moment will<br />
mean that we'll have a airline system which will be about<br />
more efficient than the one we inherited. That's what<br />
we're doing. Because we will have a significantly less<br />
number of pilots operating at 60% higher productivity as a<br />
result of what's happening now. That's what will happen.<br />
It will be one of the most significant pieces of<br />
micro-economic reform that this or any other country has<br />
seen. where have you seen under any other government an<br />
increase in productivity in an airline system of about<br />
which is what will happen. </p>
<p>JOST: By when?<br />
PM: Certainly by the first part of next year.<br />
JOST: And the process of achieving this great step in<br />
progress, the process has involved God knows how many<br />
hundreds of millions of dollars<br />
PM: And the alternative would've cost infinitely more and<br />
forever. Because if we'd done what the Opposition said,<br />
give into the pilots, have a 30% increase in wages for the<br />
pilots, that not only would've ruined the airline industry<br />
and the tourism industry, it would've wrecked the economy.<br />
Under this, sure there's been pain in the process but in the<br />
end Australia will be infinitely better off because it will<br />
have an infinitely more efficient airline industry. The<br />
alternative would've been to ruin the whole economy.<br />
JOST: Well time will prove you right or wrong.<br />
PM: Time will prove me right.<br />
JOST: Thanks very much for talking to us today.<br />
PM: Thanks John. It's been a pleasure as always.<br />
ends </p>
