INTERVIEW WITH TONY WALKER OF RADIO AUSTRALIA ON 19 DECEMBER 1975<br />
4TERVIEWER: Mr Fraser, what do you see as your most important priorities<br />
in Government?<br />
RIME MINISTER: First to get a good sound administration that can grapple<br />
with the internal economic difficulties and cut out<br />
extravagance and waste, cut out duplication in the general<br />
administration of the country, and get the economy back onto<br />
a sound basis so people can plan their own futures,<br />
their businesses futures in a way that will be predictable.<br />
TTERVIEWER: Would you be looking to a recovery say before the end of<br />
the year?<br />
RIME MINISTER: Well I've always said that it would take a full three year<br />
term to undo the damage that we believe had been caused by<br />
two or three years of fairly wild extravagance. But I would<br />
alsq. certainly hope that confidence would begin to show<br />
itself in tho economy quite soon.<br />
NTERVIEWER: Would, you say that the economic indicators are looking fairly<br />
. promising at the moment say mudh more promising than six<br />
months ago?<br />
RIME MINISTER: Well some are. lookinq slightly more promising but I don't<br />
think we can take yet too much heart from the sorts of figures<br />
that have come out, statistics about the past. Recovery<br />
overseas is tentative, the United States appears to be moving<br />
forward, but there is a long way to go, and we should not<br />
underrate the importance of the task and the determination<br />
that is going to be needed to get out of the economic<br />
difficulties that do confront us.<br />
ITERVIEWER: So you're suggesting in a sense that recovery may be fairly<br />
slow?<br />
RIME MINISTER: Well we hope that it's going to start soon and that confidencc<br />
will be regained and people will start to make investment<br />
decisions. This will lead to more employment, more productivity,<br />
and also more revenue, one of the way of helping to get down </p>
<p>2.<br />
the deficit. But it is not a job that can be done in a<br />
week or a month. I get back to the point that I believe<br />
it will require a full three year program. me to establish<br />
a complete economic recovery.<br />
INTERVIEWER: I wonder if we can turn now to foreign relations. Under<br />
your administration, what posture will Australia be adopting?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we want to maintain . friendships with as many countries<br />
as possible. I think closer relationships can be established<br />
with the ASEAN countries than has. been the case in -the past,<br />
-and also closer relationships with'Japan, which were damaged<br />
by some aspects of resources policy ofh previous Government.<br />
We certainly want to maintain links with China and I'vealready<br />
said that when domestic matters make it possible and it<br />
is necessary for me to go overseas, that the ASEAN countries<br />
and Japan and China would be. first-on a list of priorities<br />
Ilam not suggesting that is early. I think it is quite<br />
som6,' time off.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Quite possibly towards the middle of next year perhaps?<br />
PRIMIE MINISTER: Well I would not want to put a time on it. It would<br />
depend entirely on how domestic events go -our major<br />
problems, the problems that worry Australians, are in<br />
Australia and tHat is where I ought-to be at the moment.<br />
INTERVIEWER: But when you do go overseas, your first priority would be<br />
in th is region?<br />
? RIME MINISTER: Yes it would -very definitely.<br />
! NTERVIEWER: Mr Fraser, during the campaign you talked, in foreign polic-y<br />
terms, about reinforcing old relationships. Would that mean<br />
that Australia will generally support the United States in<br />
world bodies like the United Nations?<br />
. RIME MINISTER: If we believe they are right. Not if we believe they are<br />
wrong. I think there is almost been a tendency over the last<br />
year or two to oppose what the United States has proposed, </p>
<p>or what Britain might have proposed, almost because they<br />
were the proposers, almost because they were on a certain<br />
side in an argument. There -seemed to be a wish to vote with the<br />
Third World, or with communist powers, just for the sake of<br />
it. -We will be judging matters on their merits on the<br />
basis of the arguments that will be put and making our own<br />
judgements accordingly about the way Australia ought to<br />
cast a vote. I think that is the way respect is gained in<br />
international relations not by saying we are going to support<br />
one country permanently or oppose another country permanently.<br />
The arguments will be judged on their merits.<br />
[ TERVIEWER: Would you see some danger in the prospect, perhaps, if we are<br />
seen to support the United States too solidly, too often,<br />
that we may offend some of our new friends in the non-aligned<br />
movement?<br />
LIVEE MINISTER:* Wellif we are supportinq the United States on the basis<br />
of ' airguments. that are put on an analysis of a' situation,<br />
and if as a result of that we believe the United States<br />
is right, then we certainly ought, to support her and that is<br />
. what we'll be doing. But it wili'be on the basis of analysis,<br />
on the basis of argument in each particular " Case. So there<br />
is no question of not supporting a point of view-which will<br />
be an Australian. point of view and one which we would come<br />
to because of our own analysis of events. It needs to be<br />
understood, and this is a term I've used before, that there<br />
are countries around the world with whom we have got clear<br />
philisophical links-in common, generally the democratic<br />
countries which conduct their Governments in certain ways<br />
that do have free elections that are capable ol: changing<br />
their Governments. I think it is natural that Australia would<br />
want to strengthen ties with countries that have this clear<br />
philosophical commitment in common. One of the nearest<br />
and clearest of course is New Zealand.<br />
TERVIEWER: on that point it is sometimes said that you are too preoccupied<br />
with the power and influence of the Soviet Union. Would<br />
you see a hardening of Australia's attitude towards the<br />
Soviet Union under your administration? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't think I am any more preoccupied with the<br />
power and influence of the Soviet Union than China would be<br />
for example. And China, as we know, is immensely concerned<br />
at some aspects of. Russ ian policies the build. up in the<br />
Indian Ocean of naval. forces has almost entirely occurred<br />
as a-result of increasing Russian involvement develloping<br />
acapacity to maintain ships of war at sea over very long<br />
periods without resupply from ports. The opening of the<br />
Suez Canal will, of course, increase Russia's capacity to<br />
achieve that. Russia is the major power that has been<br />
pushing and thrusting in different directions. But in this<br />
respect I think I have shared a number of aspects of the view<br />
that China has put.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Do you-see the Indian Oqean then as a possible area of conflict?<br />
PRIME~ MINISTER: Well1I would certainly hope not. But to argue as the<br />
preViouS Government -tended to t[-hat the United'States should<br />
stay out of the Indian Ocean that it is wrong to establish<br />
Diego. Garcia while saying little or virtually nothing about<br />
. efforts of the Soviet Union'to bu'ild up its capacity was a<br />
very tone sided approach to the problem. It iLs ju1st not<br />
realistic to suggest that the Indian Ocean can become a zone<br />
of peace where no warships sail. The Russians are quite<br />
determined that they are going to parade around the<br />
Indian Ocean, and if that is so the United States and. other<br />
countries need a capacity. Australia needs a capacity that is<br />
comnmendsurate with her means and her requirements. It is<br />
obviously a very modest one, compared with those of either<br />
of the two major powers. But some aspects of this debate have<br />
never really been fully emphasised. Diego Garcia has often<br />
been looked upon merely as a base, a modest one, for United<br />
States purposes. It ought to be pointed out that in the event<br />
of renewed difficulties in the Middle East, if the Azores were<br />
denied to the United States as a landing and staging point for<br />
their aircraft, the only other way of reinforcing Israel<br />
in the event of a renewed difficulty would be through Diego<br />
Garcia. The other point about Diego Garcia is that it is<br />
fairly essential from the point of view of being able to protect </p>
<p>INTERVIEWER: the shipping lanes which bring oil from the Middle East<br />
to countries in our region, and in particular, to Japan.<br />
So it has got a strategic influence and importance<br />
that-. ought not to be underestimated.<br />
You're laying quite a lot of emphasis on Australia's<br />
support for America on Diego Garcia. You don'It think<br />
that there may be some difficulty for us in this in the.<br />
sense of offending littoral States around the Indian Ocean,<br />
like India for example?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I think the previous Government was coming to recognise<br />
the necessity of Diego Garcia very slowly, very reluctantly<br />
in very much the same way as they came to reco~ gnise the<br />
necessity for the joint bases in Australia which we-sharewith<br />
the United States.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Mr Fraser, I wonder if I can put. four foreign policy situations<br />
to you' and ask for your comment? First, South Africa.<br />
What sort of relations do you expect between Canberra and<br />
Pretoria?<br />
PRIME MINISTE R: Well I would hope relationships with many countries including<br />
South Africa, are cordial. I would hope relationships with<br />
China and the Soviet Union are cordial. That doesn't mean<br />
to say we agree wzith the internal. poli'cies of that particular<br />
country. If we are only going to have reasonable diplomatic<br />
relations or friendly diplomatic relations with countrieswhose<br />
internal policies we agree with, then we are going to<br />
leave ourselves in a good deal of isolation. So, you know,<br />
I've said we wish to maintain relationships with a~ s many<br />
countries as possible.<br />
INTERVIEWER: What would your attitude, for example, be on sporting<br />
teams from South Africa coming to this ' country?<br />
? RIM,, E MINISTER: Well I made it quite plain during the election that if<br />
they were picked and known to be picked on a proper multi-racial<br />
basis, then that would be welcomed. </p>
<p>INTERVIEWER: Towards, the Middle East, will Australia's so called<br />
even handed policy be maintained?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I have also said that I don't believe that the<br />
policy adopted by the previous Government was even handed.<br />
I've branded the policy as a pro-Russian policy.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Well how will your Government respond to the situation there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We would want to make more plain our commitment Ito the<br />
survival of Israel.<br />
INTERVIEWER: And how will you do that in practical terms?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well in practical terms maybe there is not a great deal<br />
that Australia can in fact do. In the United Nations, however,<br />
a number of resolutions have come to which we've opposed<br />
an would certainly continue to. There appears to have<br />
been moves amongst some countries to isolate Israel<br />
something that we would resist.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Do you see the Israeli question, say at therUnited Nations,<br />
as a first important test of foreign policy for your Government?<br />
Australia's stand on that question?<br />
-RIME MINISTER: I think that might be putting it on too high a plane. I<br />
haven't got the United Nations timetable in : ront of me at<br />
the moment, so I don't know what events are going to occur.<br />
In foreign affairs, matters can occur sometimes quite quickly,<br />
quite unpredictablv.<br />
. NTERVIEWER: A problem on our doorstep, Timor. What solution do you<br />
see to that?<br />
RIME MINISTER: I would hope that there can be an observer mission from the<br />
United Nations that can properly oversee the appropriate<br />
process of self determination. One of the tragedies of this<br />
situation is the breakdown of internal order in Portugal. </p>
<p>7.<br />
itself that has left Portugal without the will or<br />
without the capacity to see the the decolonisation process<br />
in Portugese Timor proceeded as it ought to have proceeded.<br />
When that situation began to develop, which I think was<br />
about 14 or 15 months ago, it would have been possible<br />
to take one of two initiatives, either through the United<br />
Nations, again with appropriate observer groups, or on a<br />
regional basis in cooperation with other countries to oversee<br />
the appropriate process of self determination. Now neither<br />
of these things occurred. Neither of these initiatives<br />
were taken, and a very difficult situation resulted as a result<br />
of that. But you will know we have'supported various<br />
resolutions in the United Nations and we hope that effect<br />
. can be given to that.<br />
INTERVIEWER: On that point, your Government. I think, has taken a rather<br />
stronger line on Indonesian activities in Timor than perhaps<br />
the'-previous Government did. Would you say that could create<br />
some problems between Canberra and Jakarta?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I, believe our relationships with Jakarta are very close.<br />
I know Mr Peacock has been thereion a niumber of occasions<br />
and personally knows a number of their leaders. And so do I.<br />
It is important that relationships between Indonesia and<br />
Australia remain close.. It . is important not only for ourselves<br />
and for Indonesia, but for the stability of the general<br />
region. But on the other hand, if there is a view<br />
that w6 feel needs to be put on a matter which affects our<br />
general relationships or that impinges on the interests<br />
of both countries, I believe that the relationship with<br />
Indonesia is so close that they will understand our point of<br />
view. One of the important things between countries in the<br />
same part of the world who have many friendships, attitudes<br />
and interests in common, is that they ought to be understood<br />
that when some plain views are put, they ought to be put<br />
modestly and in appropriate language. I think that is what<br />
we have done.<br />
INTERVIEWER: I wonder if. I can ask you one final question. Are you<br />
optimistic or pessimistic about prospects for peace in this region?<br />
0 </p>
<p>8.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Basically optimistic, but only so long as countries<br />
are aware of possible dangers so that their policies and<br />
attitudes can be so framed that those dangers do not arise.<br />
If we take the attitude that there are no problems, there<br />
are no dangers that can even occur, well that helps to<br />
establish'the circumstances in which dangers and problems<br />
can occur and will occur. So it is a question of being able<br />
to analyse the situation, see where the dangers might lie,<br />
and have a foreign policy which enables us to prevent<br />
that happening.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Mr Fraser, thank you very much.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: * Th ank you. </p>
