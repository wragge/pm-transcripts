PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF HEROES WALK, TOWNSVILLE, 14 AUGUST 1995<br />
*' CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
Con Sciacca, Councillor Tony M~ iooney and Mrs Mooney, Keith Payne VC and Don<br />
Starcevich, son of Private Leslie Starcevich VC, distinguished guests, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. I'm delighted to be in Anzac Park this morning to open this Heroes Walk.<br />
During the Australia Remembers year, we have remembered the efforts of the<br />
World War Two generation of Australians. We have remembered those who<br />
worked on the homefront as well as those who served on the battlefield.<br />
But this memorial honours the bravest of the brave.<br />
It honours the twenty Australians who received the nation's highest honour for<br />
valour during the WWII the Victoria Cross and especially the twelve recipients<br />
who fought in the Pacific War.<br />
They gave their all in defence of this country and many of them gave their lives.<br />
Today we pay tribute to people of rare quality men of great courage and<br />
resourcefulness and sustained by their belief in Australia.<br />
Men like Corporal Jack French from Crows Nest, near Toowoomba, who overcame<br />
three Japanese machine gun nests at Milne Bay before succumbing.<br />
Or Private Richard Kelliher, who enlisted in the 2nd AIF in Brisbane, who silenced<br />
a machine gun post at Lae and saved his wounded section commander.<br />
It is to these men and all their comrades that we pay tribute today.<br />
I know that Keith Payne VC from the Vietnam War is here and we acknowledge<br />
his great service to Australia.<br />
The winners of the Victoria Cross are surely all heroes. But all of Australia's<br />
fighting men and women of World War Two and the millions of Australians who<br />
stood behind them deserve the title too.<br />
We remember them all as heroes.<br />
Thank you. </p>
