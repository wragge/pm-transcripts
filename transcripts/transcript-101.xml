Cabinet at its meeting in Melbourne considered in detail<br />
all aspects of the Laotian situation in which it received a comprehensive<br />
report from the Acting Minister for External Affairs.<br />
It had before it analyses and reports received from Australian<br />
diplomatic missions abroad ar4 the views of Australia: s allies<br />
and Commonwealth partners. * In the course of the meeting teletyped<br />
reports of the then current meeting of the security council<br />
and of the most recent reports of events in Laos were received.<br />
Cabinet studied all this material and considered the<br />
likely development of events including courses which might be<br />
taken in the absence of prompt action on the part of the United<br />
Nations. Cabinet endorsed the view that the resolution for a<br />
fact-finding mission propounded in the Security Council by Mr.<br />
Lodge on behalf of the United States and supported by sC w-nny<br />
countries including in the Council itself the United Kingdom,<br />
France, The Republic-of China, the Argentine. Republicq Canada,<br />
Italy, Japan, Panama and Tunisia was most timely and welcome,<br />
and if carried by the Council and promptly implemented would<br />
constitute a distftt advance in the resolution of a situation<br />
which had become acute for the Royal Laotian Government.<br />
Cabinet decided that Australia's representatives overseas<br />
should. be instructed to give any support within their<br />
means to any United Nations effort which resulted from any such<br />
resolution. At the conclusion of the Cabinet meeting advice was received<br />
that the resolution for the appointment of a four-nation<br />
sub-committee of the Security Council to investigate and report<br />
on the situation in Laos had been carried by the Security Council<br />
and that the members to form the Sub-Committee are Argentina,<br />
Italy, Japan and Tunisia.<br />
The day to day developments of the situation will be<br />
kept under constant review by thu Ministers concerned and<br />
dealt with by them in the light of the Cabinet discussions<br />
which took place. Appropriate communication and consultation<br />
with our overseas posts and with our allies in SEATO and Commonwealth<br />
partners will of course continue.<br />
Melbourne, 8th September, 1959. </p>
