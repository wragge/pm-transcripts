STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER, K<br />
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE J. M. FRASER.<br />
REPORT OF TI-E ADVISORY GROUP ON THlE SCIENCE<br />
AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL<br />
On 9 February I announced that Dr J. A. L. Matheson,<br />
the Chairman of the Interim Australian Science and Technology<br />
Council had been asked to form a small Advisory Group to<br />
advise me on the role of a continuing science and technology<br />
council, its terms of reference and of other matters concerning<br />
its operation. The Advisory Group reported to me on 24 March. It<br />
recommends an interim and short term course of action, bringing<br />
the Advisory Group into the Interim Australian Science and<br />
Technology Council ( ASTEC), which would continue with changed<br />
membership and functions. The first task of the Council will<br />
be the preparation, by the end of 1976, of a definitive report<br />
to assist the Government in its decisions on the long-term<br />
future of ASTEC. In this task, the. Council will consult with<br />
interested parties, including Government Departments and<br />
Agencies. The Permanent Heads of Departments and Agencies<br />
with a significant research and development budget will be able<br />
to participate in the discussions of the Council to foster<br />
mutual understanding. The Council will also consult with<br />
universities, academies and other relevant bodies. In<br />
recognition of its short-term nature the terms of office for<br />
members of the reconstituted Council will be for one year only.<br />
The Advisory Group also recommends that the Council<br />
should be independent of any Department or Ministry having a<br />
significant concern with scientific and technological resource<br />
and development. This is consistent with my statement of<br />
8 December 1975 that, as the problems of science involve all<br />
areas of Government and are of the highest importance to<br />
Australia, ASTEC will report directly to the Prime Minister<br />
who will report to Parliament. I have therefore confirmed that<br />
the Council should report directly to me and decided that its<br />
secretariat should be located for the time being within my<br />
Department. The membership of the reconstituted Council will be<br />
announced as soon as those approached have indicated their<br />
willingness to serve.<br />
I wish to place on record my appreciation of'* the<br />
work of the Advisory Group and the speed with which they made<br />
their report.<br />
29 April 1976 </p>
