    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and I have discussed climate change and energy security.  We have agreed that they are priority issues that require sustained, effective and global action.</p>
<p>Japan is one of the world's largest importers of energy and one of the world's most energy efficient countries.  Australia is a major supplier of Japan's energy resources and we are important to Japan's energy security.  Indeed, Australia is likely to become the top supplier of liquefied natural gas to Japan in the near future.  Our partnership on energy and climate is therefore a natural one.</p>
<p>We have agreed that the APEC Sydney Declaration is a major step towards a new international framework in which all major emitters participate and which balances environmental protection with economic growth.  We have welcomed the US initiative to launch a dialogue amongst major economies on climate change and we will participate fully in the UN meetings in Indonesia.</p>
<p>We have agreed that the development and deployment of innovative technologies will be a key element in addressing the climate change challenge.  We will work together in the Asia-Pacific Partnership and other groupings to support new technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while meeting energy security and economic growth objectives.</p>
<p>We have also agreed that reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is a key component of global action on climate change.  I have welcomed Japan's participation in the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, and we will continue our efforts to combat illegal logging and cooperate on forest and carbon monitoring systems.  We have also welcomed the APEC Leaders' decision to reduce energy intensity across the region:  this will enhance energy security and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Australia and Japan are both committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  Japan possesses advanced technology and experience, and nuclear power plays a key role in Japan's energy mix and its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Japan is also one of the largest consumers of Australian uranium.</p>
<p>We have agreed that long term responses to climate change include the use of nuclear energy and that Australia and Japan should cooperate to promote nuclear power generation in a manner that ensures nuclear non-proliferation, safety and security, and develops clean, zero-emission energy sources.</p>
<p>Japan will support Australia participation in the Generation IV International Forum, a partnership of governments working together on fourth generation nuclear power plant technology.  The next meeting of the Japan-Australia High Level Group on Energy and Minerals will focus on uranium and nuclear issues, including uranium trade, transport and investment issues and opportunities for technical, skills and research cooperation in nuclear energy.  Australia and Japan will also review and discuss possible new areas of cooperation under the bilateral Agreement for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.  </p>
