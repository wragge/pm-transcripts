<p>The Gillard Government will deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas by reforming the anti-dumping system.</p>
<p>Manufacturing employs nearly one million Australians in skilled and decently-paid jobs and is a central part of a resilient, diverse and broad-based economy.</p>
<p>The sector faces challenges from the high Australian dollar, economic weakness in Europe, intense global competition and an oversupply of some traded goods in international markets.</p>
<p>A key concern is evidence of a significant increase in dumping  -  the unfair trade practice where imported goods are sold in Australia at prices below their normal value, injuring local businesses and their workers.</p>
<p>It is not acceptable for Australian jobs to be put at risk by products being dumped into this country.</p>
<p>Manufacturing provides a quarter of Australia's business R&amp;D expenditure, a third of our traditional trade apprenticeship completions and almost 30 per cent of our exports.</p>
<p>The Government will support manufacturing by strengthening the system for investigating dumping and applying remedies where dumping is injuring local producers.</p>
<p>The key reforms will:</p>
<p>·         Establish a new Anti-Dumping Commission to investigate complaints; </p>
<p>·         Boost funding to Customs by $24.4 million over four years so it can deal with cases speedily and fairly  -  this will almost double the number of investigators;</p>
<p>·         Make the anti-dumping system easier for small and medium-sized businesses; and</p>
<p>·         Introduce stricter remedies against overseas producers who deliberately circumvent Australia's anti-dumping rules.</p>
<p>Australian-made products affected by dumping in recent years include steel, chemicals, aluminium goods and paper products. Sectors manufacturing these goods employ more than 150,000 Australians.</p>
<p>It is neither economically efficient nor fair for competitive Australian businesses to be disadvantaged by products dumped into our market.</p>
<p>We do not allow unfair trade practices by our own businesses, so we should not allow Australian jobs to be jeopardised by unfair trade practices from overseas producers.</p>
<p>These reforms will ensure competition is on a level playing field, supporting jobs in manufacturing and other industries.</p>
<p>They implement recommendations of the former Victorian Premier John Brumby's report on the administration of the anti-dumping system and include additional initiatives to strengthen the system.</p>
<p>Mr Brumby's report concluded that dumping into Australia is highly likely to increase and that an efficient and effective anti-dumping system is critical to retaining public confidence in free trade.</p>
<p>The Government will introduce legislation in 2013 to establish the new Anti-Dumping Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission will be based in Melbourne. It will report directly to the Minister for Home Affairs and utilise the systems of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.</p>
<p>Funding will also be extended for the International Trade Remedies Adviser to continue providing information, advice and support to small and medium sized enterprises on anti-dumping issues.</p>
<p>Today's announcement builds on existing Gillard Government policies, including:</p>
<p>·         The $5.4 billion New Car Plan, which is supporting automotive manufacturing in Australia;</p>
<p>·         The $1 billion Clean Technology Program which is investing in new energy-efficient equipment at manufacturing businesses around Australia;</p>
<p>·         The $300 million Steel Transformation Plan which is supporting investment in steel manufacturing.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government's policies demonstrate its commitment to Australian manufacturing in tough times.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Coalition voted against the Clean Technology Program and the Steel Transformation Plan and would cut $1.5 billion from the New Car Plan, putting hundreds of thousands of Australian manufacturing jobs at risk.</p>
