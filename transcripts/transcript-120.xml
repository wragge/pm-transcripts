SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES AT THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURES<br />
INC. DINNER, SATURDAY, 17TH OCTOBER, 1959<br />
Sir, Mr. Premier and Gentlemen:<br />
I don't know that I liked that last passage very much<br />
about a " fatherly talk". Looking around at some of you I<br />
should think you could give me years! ( laughter) But I am<br />
delighted to be here because as the President has rightly said,<br />
in my opinion, this is just about as big a dinner of its kind<br />
that I have ever seen in Australia in my life, No doubt the<br />
expansion of the business of General IMotors-Holdens, under the<br />
benign auspices of my Government ( laughter) may have something<br />
to do with it. A rather contentious fellow called Horn,<br />
who is one of their directors, has niever been known to admit it<br />
when in Canberra.,..<br />
But it is a marvellous thing to be able to stand up at<br />
what is primarily a manufacturers! dinner in Adelaide in the<br />
State of South Australia, because quite frankly looking back<br />
what? 20 years? I would have thought an attendance like this<br />
under these auspices practically impossible. And therefore this<br />
proves what has been going on in the State of South Australia.<br />
I picked a period of 20 years, not because I had any more desire<br />
than usual to flatter the Premier of this Stat11e but because<br />
I did hope that when he comes, later on, to speak he might say<br />
to you that of the 20 undoubtedly the greatest 12 well,<br />
you know what I mean! ( laughter).<br />
In point of fact, gentlemen, I want to tell you this<br />
so that you will be prepared for anything. Sir Thomas and I<br />
have a little ' working arrangement'. It has endured now for<br />
many years. We take it in turns to have the last word.' When<br />
he has the last word as he will tonight he takes strips off<br />
mej and when I have , he last word as I do every other time<br />
well I do my best, Though it's very hard to ' take a strip'<br />
off this political pachyderm'! ( Lau,-hter) I don't say that<br />
offensively, but because there he is: he has been there for<br />
years, and I like to recall that over these 20 years he has<br />
occasionally thought of the then state of affairs at the opening<br />
of the account so to speak, in the State of South Australia.<br />
I was reminded of it very much today flying across,<br />
contemplating this really disastrous drought that you have been<br />
having in South Australia, A worse drought here than in any<br />
other part of Australia, and if I were to go back for 20 years,<br />
as he can so readily, I think we would both agree, Tom, that<br />
years ago the impact of a dry year with 71 inches of rain, the<br />
impact on South Australia would have been disastrous, and in a<br />
large sense not capable of being resisted because there was no<br />
other balancing factor in the econcrm. y of the State no other<br />
big balancing factor at any rate. So that one would have expected<br />
to find a great deal of unemployment, a good deal of<br />
misery, tremendous problems of Government and private finance.<br />
And in 20 years, if I may say so, largely owing to the unceasing<br />
drive and sometimes the tiresome non-conformity of my friend<br />
the premier ( laughter and applause) but largely owing to<br />
his unceasing drive, with a little co-operation from me in the<br />
earlier years as he will recall .,( la~ ughter) but only a<br />
little, it was... well, I won't elaborate that in case it giv-os<br />
him ideasJ But anyhow ( and he doesn't need them) ( Laughter)<br />
. But you know over this period of 20 years this State has got<br />
both economic feet firmly on the ground. And that uas why I was<br />
so struck tonight, as I was the last time I came hero, at the<br />
idea that you could have 600 men of significance in this city<br />
and in this State meeting to celebrate another year of enormous<br />
development in their own State, and therefore ih the Commonwealth.<br />
This to me is one of the groat things that has happened in<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>I was born in the northwest of Victoria in a section<br />
which was then called the Mallee, until somebody coined that<br />
highly intellectual phrase: " Is the Mallee worth saving?"<br />
whereupon we promptly called our section the VJimmera ( laughter).<br />
4e11, I mean, reasonably enough we had an acute desire to be<br />
savedi But in 1902, when I was a very ripe age indeed 1902<br />
one of my earliest memories is the great drought of that year,<br />
when in that district ( Jeparit, from Horsham up to Dimboola and<br />
Rainbow) 2J inches of rain fell! The whole earth was brown,<br />
and half of it was blown around in the north winds. Starving<br />
cattle and other stock were brought in to Lake Hindmarsh because<br />
out of the dry bed of the laka there began to sprout a rather<br />
succulent weed as you might say which had moisture in it and<br />
which saved a few thousands of them. At that time a drought<br />
was and still is of course for those who are under its direct<br />
impact an utter disaster. It seemed to be so irremediable<br />
that I began very early in my days to understand what water<br />
meant to people who are in the outback country of Australia.<br />
But oddly enough, though that's my first juvenile memory,<br />
my second juvenile memory not so long after , ards was of hearing<br />
my late father, who was subsequently a member of the Victorian<br />
Parliament, and from whom I inherited a certain degree of contentiousness<br />
and of willingness to enter into a dispute you<br />
will forgive me for that I'm sure but I can we: ll remember<br />
him laying down the law to some, I thought, rather tolerant and<br />
patient wheatgrower, on the subject of the vital importance to<br />
Australia of the protective tariff. They were fighting words<br />
in those days, weren't they? Tremendous! And the old man used<br />
to be at this, as it seemed to me, almost day and night, and in<br />
my juvenile innocence I thought he was wrong.<br />
But that really wasn't a very comforting way in which<br />
to speak to men on the land who suffered all the vicissitudes of<br />
wind and weather. But I didn't take long to learn that from an<br />
Australian point of view he was right that for Australia it<br />
i~ as not sufficient to be exposed naked to the forces of wiind and<br />
weather, that we must develop ourselves as an all-round community,<br />
growing things from the soil, grazing stock on the soil,<br />
manufacturing things in our factories, learning to stand robustly<br />
and in an all-round way in the presence of whatever the world<br />
might choose to do to us, And that's quite right! And you are<br />
tonight the proof of it, And the history of this State is the<br />
proof of it. If the distinguished Premier of this State had<br />
taken a small, narrow view of these matters, South Australia<br />
would not today be able to stand up against these difficulties<br />
and move forward and continue in the broad the prosperity of<br />
her growth, and her development. And therefore I don't belong<br />
to the school of thought though I'm afraid some of my manufacturing<br />
friends do who think that secondary industries in<br />
Australia ought to be apologised for, or in some strange way<br />
defended as if they were exotic from the point of view of Australia.<br />
All that's gone. tie are today living in a community<br />
which has long since decided that every aspect of 4ndustry,<br />
whether it's primary or secondary or tertiary, is in alliance<br />
with every other in order to give the greatest stability and the<br />
greatest chances of growth to the country. That's a simple and<br />
rather comprehensive statement of my owm feeling about these<br />
matters. But I wyant to say a little more about today and the<br />
future. It has been very much in my mind in the last few days<br />
it was brought more acutely to my mind when I learned, as you<br />
did, this afternoon, of the death of George Marshall, that very<br />
great American and very great citizen of the world. Now you<br />
may say: " What has George Marshall to do with the Chamber of<br />
Manufactures Dinner in Adelaide?". I'd like to answer that<br />
question if I may, because I knew him a little enough to know </p>
<p>3.<br />
of his greatness, of his outlook. But I want to remind you that<br />
George Marshall will go down in the history of the Twentieth<br />
Century as one of the very greatest men of our time. And for<br />
two reasons one was that it wasn't for him to have the picturesque<br />
tasks even though they were vastly dangerous of<br />
command in war; but it was his task as the head of the general<br />
provisioning for the Services in the United States, to be responsible<br />
basically for an * enormous part of the American effort in<br />
the late War. And he attended to it with the most astonishing<br />
courage and the most r~ akbeintelligence, And then when<br />
the War was over he di1. n't fail to understand that there had<br />
been a Wiar before, and that it had produced American ideas in<br />
the League of Nations of an International kind, and that these<br />
had been dropped and defeated at Washington, and that the United<br />
States of America had for a time gone back into a state of isolationism.<br />
George Marshall was well aware of this. He, of<br />
all men in our time, was the man who led the United States into<br />
understanding that the economic development of other countries<br />
in the world was of the greatest importance for peace and for<br />
an intelligent resistance to Communism. And so we had the<br />
Marshall Plan Marshall Aid even though today he is dead, and<br />
for years he has been out of the picture, we ~ xilfind ourselves,<br />
don't we, talking about Marshall Aid as a sort of generic<br />
term. All these thousands of millions that have been<br />
poured into the rest of the world for economic strengthening by<br />
the United States have not only exhibited the end of isolationism,<br />
but they've exhibited the statesmanship which in my opinion does<br />
groat honour to the greatest power in the Twentbth Century. And<br />
so George Marshall and his memory and his work are not irrelevant<br />
to what I am thinking about and talking about tonight.<br />
I believe that the development in Australia over the<br />
last twenty years in particular over a period which began<br />
perhaps a few years after the end of the first World Vlar the<br />
development of Australia in manufacturing, in all-round political<br />
and economic activity has been a source of strength to us<br />
that we don't always rc alise. I was asking the ether day for<br />
a few figures because figures are occasionally interesting.<br />
Boards of Directors have, I believe, been known occasionally to<br />
pay attention to them ( Laughter) and occasionally I do. But I<br />
asked for a few good round objective figures, because I had it<br />
in my bones that there had been the most astonishing development<br />
in this, what I'll call, the industrial field, Aid t'jlo answer<br />
is that since the War there has been invested in manuf'acturn<br />
industry, in what I'll call the fixed assets of manufacturing<br />
industry, since the war, no less than œ 1,750,000,000 in Australia.<br />
And for years now it has averaged about œ C200,00, OO a<br />
year at least. This is remarkable! If it stood by itself it<br />
would be remarkable. If it stood by itself it would exhibit a<br />
degree of confidence in the country which I think is of the very<br />
essence of national development. But if doesn't Stand by itself!<br />
We have now for some time been receiving capital needed<br />
capital from overseas. Some of it, of course, on the public<br />
account public Government borrowing and a great deal of it<br />
on private account. We have had now, for the last few years,<br />
something over a hundred millions a year coming into Australia<br />
on private account for capital investrment. And contrary to some<br />
public impressions the better part of it from the United Kingdom,<br />
but a gruat deal of it from the United States far more on<br />
private account than on public account, though I wouldn't apologise<br />
for what has come in on public account, because as I think<br />
I have said to you once bofore, there is no greater fallacy entertained<br />
by many people including business people than the<br />
idea that Government expenditure on works is in somae way a competitor<br />
with private expenditure in the development of industry,<br />
whereas, of course, it is nothing of the kind! But for Government<br />
expenditure on roads and water and power and all these<br />
things there could be no adequate industrial development in Aus-</p>
<p>tralia. These are two facets of the same thing; and from my<br />
poftft-of view, as one who has been by some chance made the<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, I find nothing that fills me so<br />
much with pride not with complacency as some people say but<br />
with pride a decent sentiment pride is and every Australian<br />
ought to have it and nothing fills me with more pride than<br />
the knowledge that this confidence is being shown not only by<br />
investors in Australia but by investors outside of Australia,<br />
in our destiny, in our capacity, in our future both near and<br />
distant. These are, I think, tremendously exciting days. And<br />
when I think about them I say to iyself: " dell, how is it that<br />
when we contemplate the state of our economy how is it that<br />
when we follow out the enormous growth of industry in Australiathat<br />
we so frequently sit down and engage in a gloom session.<br />
Oh things are not what they might be! We're having a little<br />
trouble about this! The Government isn't doing enough about<br />
that." Well I don't mind a bit of moaning; I think that it's<br />
very good I'm not unaccustomed to is ( laughter) near home.<br />
A little bit of moaning now and then it relished by the wisest<br />
men if I may misquote ( laughter). But what about taking a<br />
little stock occasionally and forgetting to moan, and feeling<br />
glad? What about feeling happy about this country of ours?<br />
! hat about saying to ourselves every now and then: " Bliss was<br />
it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young ' twas very Heaven."<br />
Wouldn't it be very Heaven to be young in a country like this,<br />
with all these achievements to its credit, and with this almost<br />
illimitable future in front of it? Let's be proud; let's be<br />
cheeful about it! And it's very important that we should be<br />
for a reason that I want to mention a reason with which many<br />
of you are no doubt familiar.<br />
It isn't very long ago that it could be said with<br />
complete accuracy that the export income of Australia was<br />
derived almost entirely from primary products. And the manufacturer<br />
was a fellow who under the advantage of all that, was<br />
enjoying the benefits of a protective tariff. But he wasn't<br />
exporting anything! Now, I've got a figure or two on that<br />
I'll see if I can find it; yes, five years ago only five<br />
years ago manufactured goods and semi-manufactured goods<br />
represented eight per cent of Australia's exports. Last financial<br />
year they represented fourteen per cent of Australia's<br />
export income. Five years, you know that's a very remarkable<br />
development. I believe myself that the time will come I won't<br />
be here, but a lot of you will be: you sprightly fellows will<br />
be here I believe that the time will come, and that before<br />
many years, when the products of our factories will represent<br />
a massive proportion of our export income. I'm not contemplating<br />
that we're going to grow less wool or sell less wool or<br />
that these great staples of export are going to be less significant,<br />
They will go on, providing the bedrock in many ways of<br />
our overseas earnings they will remain most vital industries,<br />
and we are not to forget it but I believe that eight per cent,<br />
fourteen per cent, will becom twenty, will become tw: entyfive,<br />
will become thirty per cent until the old idea that the manufacturer<br />
provides only for his own people under the shelter of<br />
a tariff will become almost as dead as the dodo. And why<br />
shouldn't it! What kind of people are we in Australia? There<br />
are none bettorl Let's have a little bit of Scot's modesty<br />
about this matter ( laughter, applause)<br />
" Here's tao us<br />
Wha's like us?<br />
Da'd few, and they're a' doid."<br />
Well that's good; it's a good Scots motto, and I commend it </p>
<p>' even to my Irish friends ( laughter) who may be here. But this<br />
is really a matter for pride and for ambition. All we need to<br />
do is to realise that if we're going on increasing our population<br />
by a quarter of a million every year, so that by the end<br />
of this century there will be far, far more millions here than<br />
any prophet ever thnought of fifteen years ago if we're going<br />
on like that, then let us realise that we are and must continue<br />
to be one of the greatest trading nations of the world. We are<br />
indeed! We're in a limited few of the great trading nations.<br />
Far greater traders than our population would suggest or require.<br />
And when we have twenty million people, when we have<br />
thirty million people, are we going to be ontent to be exporters<br />
only of the things that we grow? Are we going o look back<br />
and say: " Well we had a marvellous opportunity of doing business<br />
with hundreds of millions of people whose standards of living<br />
were only beginning to emerge, whose capacity to buy was<br />
only beginning to be significant"? Or are we going to say to<br />
ourselves: " Look, it's of much greater importance to know how<br />
we can export things that we make in Australia, how we can<br />
export them in large measure, in fifteen years'time." That's<br />
a much more important question than whether we can raise the<br />
dividend rate next year from nine to ten, or from ten to<br />
twelve. This is a matter for imagination, for understanding,<br />
for a bit of true pioneering. I've said it until I'm well<br />
I was going to say until Il'm sick of saying it until some<br />
people are sick of hearing me say it, much more accurately but<br />
I have said more than once that there's nothing I object to so<br />
much as this old bogus idea that pioneers had beards and bowyangs.<br />
All that's gone! Some day they will look back, and<br />
they will look back to you people and to me and to all of<br />
us who are here and so be it that we do the right thing<br />
they will say: " These people were among the pioneers of Australian<br />
export to the rest of the world of things made in Australian<br />
factories by Australian artisans." And that will be<br />
a great day for Australia. ( applause)<br />
Now, Sir, it's taken me a long time to lead up to it,<br />
but that's really all I got up to say to you. This is our<br />
moment! You never know this may be the year or the decade of<br />
our destiny. I don't go so far as to say it's the year of our<br />
destiny, but I'm sure that we are living in the decade of our<br />
destiny. If we huddle up under our protective clothes, and<br />
say: " Well, we're doing very nicely, why worry aoout the market<br />
in other countries, we're doing quite nicely thank you" then no<br />
doubt we can go along quite comfortably, but our race didn't<br />
become what it was and is in the -Jorld by going comfortably.<br />
Australia might have wanted to go comfortably when she had a<br />
small population and an acute sense of dependence, but what's<br />
the use of taking pride in your independence unless you determine<br />
that all the things that have to be done to maintain it<br />
and extend it, and make it useful, will be done?<br />
And so, I'm saying to you what no Prime Minister<br />
would even have thought of saying at a Chamber of Manufactures<br />
dinner twenty years ago I'm saying to you: don't just be<br />
satisfied by filling the local market; don't just be satisfied<br />
by fooling that circumstances are not too bad and there's a good<br />
level of prosperity. Be dissatisfied, grossly dissatisfiA until<br />
you feel that we are capable of exporting to other people<br />
in the world and selling to them in fair competition, masses of<br />
things that are made in our factories. We do it'I Australia<br />
sells stool on the west coast of the United States at a price<br />
advantage.! Not bad for Australia is it? Somebody would have<br />
said once that it couldn't be done. Somebody once said that it<br />
was impossible to manufacture motor cars in Australia it<br />
couldn't be done! The world's full of these wretched creatures<br />
who know that it can't be done. I am addressing six hundred<br />
men who I hope know that it can be done, and are determined<br />
that it will be done. </p>
