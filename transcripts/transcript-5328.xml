PRIME MINISTER<br />
ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENCE<br />
During my meeting today with Mr. Mugabe, Prime Minister of<br />
Zimbabwe, I said that Australia warmly welcomed Zimbabwe's<br />
independence and looked forward to the development of a<br />
constructive and many-sided relationship with Zimbabwe.<br />
My presence here, in company with my colleagues from the<br />
Australian. Parliament, testifies to that.<br />
The road to independence has been a particularly difficult<br />
one for Zimbabwe, involving years of bloodshed and~ mistrust<br />
and affecting thousands of families, both in Zimbabwe<br />
and elsewhere in Africa. The recent months, however, have<br />
seen a determined and successful effort by Zimbabwe's<br />
political leaders to achieve a peaceful settlement and an<br />
end to the war, with national reconciliation a very<br />
considerable achievement. Australia is pleased to have been<br />
able to play some part in Zimbabwe's progress to independence,<br />
through consultations with African and other leaders,<br />
including the Prime Minister of Britain; through the<br />
Commonwealth's consideration of this matter in Lusaka; and<br />
by membership of the Commonwealth Observer Group and the<br />
Ceasefire monitoring Force and the work of the National<br />
observer Group.<br />
There have been times when peace in Zimbabwe has seemed an<br />
unattainable goal. However, it is now a reality which will<br />
permit the energies of the people of this country to be<br />
directed towards a better life for everyone, with opportunities<br />
for all.<br />
Australia wishes Mr. Mugabe every success in the difficult<br />
task ahead of him.<br />
My talks with Mr. Mugabe provide a valuable opportunity for<br />
the establishment of personal contact and exchanges at the<br />
highest political level. During the discussions, I told<br />
Mr. Mugabe of Australia's offer of $ 5 million in aid over a<br />
period of two years, of which $ 1.5 million has been earmarked<br />
for the immediate rehabilitation and expansion of such facilities<br />
as schools and hospitals, and for veterinary work and<br />
agricultural rehabilitation in rural areas. officials of-the<br />
two countries will consult about the most useful and efficient<br />
way of expending the total amount, and to this end, an officer<br />
of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau will be stationed<br />
in Salisbury for a period. This Australian aid will, as always,<br />
be on grant terms. / 2 </p>

This is not the first such step that Australia has taken in<br />
relation to Zimbabwe. We have already donated $ 1 million to<br />
the UNHCR appeal for Zimbabwean refugees. In addition, some<br />
100 Zimbabweans have participated in Australian training<br />
programs over the years. These programs are continuing, and<br />
we are particularly pleased that among the Zimbabwean trainees<br />
this year will be two participants in the Australian Foreign<br />
Service training course.<br />
I was very pleased that Mr. Mugabe accepted our proposal to<br />
appoint Mr. Jeremy Hearder, a senior Foreign Affairs of fical,<br />
as our first High Commissioner to Zimbabwe.<br />
I also informed Mr. Mugabe of an Australian Government gift of<br />
two despatch boxes for the Senate Chamber of ' the Zimbabwe<br />
Parliament. This gift will symbolise the bond between the two<br />
countries as constitutional democracies with a common system<br />
of institutions which I believe will facilitate co-operation<br />
over a wide range of activities.<br />
Mr. Mugabe and I have agreed that Zimbabwe and Australia will<br />
benefit from the development of economic, trade and commercial<br />
links. I conveyed to Mr. Mugabe Australia's decision to apply<br />
to Zimbabwe the Australian system of Tariff Preferences for<br />
Developing Countries. This decision, which takes immediate<br />
effect, should help Zimbabwe to take advantage of the growing<br />
Australian market.<br />
I also told Mr. Mugabe that I looked forward to welcoming him<br />
with other Commonwealth leaders to the next Commonwealth Heads<br />
of GovernmentMeeting, to be held in Melbourne in 1981. The<br />
Commonwealth has played an important part in the process of<br />
independence for Zimbabwe, and we are particularly pleased that<br />
Zimbabwe has joined the Commonwealth and will be present in<br />
Melbourne for the next CHOGM.<br />
Zimbabwe promises to be a country of large significance. Its<br />
human and material resources, and its industrial skills, give it<br />
the opportunity to be a political and economic leader in the<br />
Southern African region in particular. Its new Government has<br />
embarked on a path of peace, reconciliation and unity, both<br />
at home and abroad, which we hope will be welcomed by all<br />
Zimbabwe's neighbours and reciprocated by them. Zimbabwe will<br />
also be a country of importance in international organisations,<br />
including the United Nations and the Commonwealth.<br />
We in Australia have already demonstrated our active interest<br />
in the welfare and economic development of Zimbabwe under<br />
democratic leadership, and this interest will be maintained<br />
and strengthened as relations between the two countries develop.<br />
