TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER ON JOHN LAWS 6 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
LAWS: PM: very much the victim of his own bek f -planning<br />
and acvo strategy though I don't in any sense say that<br />
now because of what I said yesterday. It's very hard to understand<br />
( EVAJ. just how much he'll be xf .' nJ so I don't want<br />
to add to it. But I think he would be the first to admit that<br />
his planning and handling of it were somewhat less than perfect.<br />
LAWS: I agree with that and I'm quite sure that he is suffering<br />
a little today and I feel very sorry for him because obviously<br />
he trusted some people that.. couldn't be trusted.<br />
PM: Yes, yes that's right.<br />
LAWS: That must come as a nasty shock to a man who puts faith<br />
in others.<br />
PM: Oh well, I have been saying for sometime, though I don't<br />
know whether I have said it to you John, that a lot of time<br />
the media have talked about factional CFf'l xU in the Labor<br />
Party but I really believe and know that the idealogical splits<br />
and factions in the Liberal Party are very much deeper and<br />
that d 1h kvc 1pt wkA s6a," oa" atodJ.<br />
LAWS: A lot of the newspaper reports are suggesting that<br />
it'll be a revitalised Opposition. Do you think it will be?<br />
PM: I think the Opposition will probably be somewhat better<br />
organised under John Howard. I mean there's the same people<br />
there; you can't change the constituencies that he has got<br />
but I think it will be somewhat better organised but I look<br />
forward to that. It's a matter of, I think, pretty common<br />
consensus in the Galleryoo4 fv most observantikrwe WaJee≈ì&amp; r<br />
JI+ MlOCIA ' 6 Parliamentary Opposition. I think they will be<br />
better organised now; that's good. I mean, it will mean that<br />
Ministers will be that much more on their toes.<br />
LAWS: Yes. The front page oi the Sun here says " Howard Challen,.:<br />
Get Hawke Anywhere Anytime. I'll take Mr Hawke on any day.<br />
I'll take him on on the hustings, on television, anytime. </p>
<p>PM: Ah well, I can assure you that I'm amused by that. The<br />
interesting and basic fact which people . have to recognise<br />
is that this is not something new; they've had Mr Howard before.<br />
They had him in charge of Australia's economy when it went<br />
into its worst recession ever. 11e. fdon't have to speculate<br />
about Mr Howard's policies. had them in operation and<br />
it brought Australia to its knees and if Mr Howard wants to<br />
promise a return to the same, which is what he is doing, well<br />
that suits me fine. We'll deal with Mr Howard wherever.<br />
Having said that, I rang him up when he got the job and congratulated<br />
him him because we have a good personal relationship. I have<br />
no reason to believe that won't continue, but it won't mean<br />
that it won't be on for young and all.<br />
LAWS: Have you spoken to Mr Peacock?(<br />
PM: I did. I rang him. I got him when he was on the plane<br />
corming back to Melbourne last night; I got him on his return.<br />
I just felt in human terms for him and for his wife, Margaret.<br />
I know what they must've been going through and I just said<br />
to him ( I mean I don't go into the details of the conversation)<br />
but I said look I don't want to be hypocritical about this<br />
but I just express my feelings for you and what you're going<br />
through and I think if you can't have these sort of decencies<br />
in politics it's a pretty rough old game.<br />
LAWS: Yes, I agree with that. Do you think it's the end<br />
of the political line for Andrew Peacock?<br />
PM: Ah, its obviously the end of the line as far as leadership<br />
is concerned; but no, I would think he still has a contribution<br />
to make to theM. My hunch is that he would seek to<br />
get the Shadow Foreign Affairs portfolio; one in which he<br />
is comfortable, which he is best equipped. one of his great<br />
problems in leadership is that he really had no knowledge<br />
of or capacity really in the economic area and that was always<br />
a difficulty for Andrew whereas he had a long experience in<br />
the Foreign Affairs. I would tend to think that that's what<br />
he'd want to go back to and I would think he has, for the<br />
Liberals, a contribution to make there.<br />
LAWS: What really was his undoing yesterday?<br />
PM: Well, his undoing was a lack of systematic thinking through<br />
and planning. He understandably had concerns about the<br />
unpreparedness of Mr Howard to give him the degree of loyalty<br />
to which he thought he was entitled but then having made that<br />
first decision in the first part of the thinking process,<br />
that is, I want to get that loyalty, couldn't get it, then<br />
seemed to think that the only thing to do was to move for<br />
the demotion of Mr Howard from the Deputy Leadership but hadn't<br />
thought the mechanics of that through. He hadn't, in advance,<br />
thouqlht . olif Mr How.-ard won't agree to -wh at 1rn Favir. a.<br />
I've then got to have a candidate ag nc41n; t nir, whoD is _ tg ' c<br />
to be? Hie hadn't done all that thinking. And then, of course,<br />
when he got to the Party Room itself, on all the evidence, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
he seems not to have made it clear to the members of his Caucus<br />
what was involved. Now, may I say that it's not only a reflection<br />
on, perhaps, his lack of strategic capacity but, being as<br />
charitable as one can and you know I've got enormous reserves<br />
of charity when it comes to talking about the Liberals, but<br />
they must be a pretty dumb crew if they didn't understand<br />
what it was about.-<br />
LAWS: That's right. That's the thing that I couldn't come<br />
to terms with. How he could walk out into it with his eyes<br />
open. Because he walked right into it.<br />
PM: Well, he made the mistake. But then John you've really<br />
got to say that they must be a pretty dumb crew if they didn't<br />
understand that if they voted for John Howard to stay as the<br />
Deputy Leadership, it was a vote of no confidence in Andrew.<br />
But, nevertheless, he should have spelt it out.<br />
LAWS: But don't you think it was perhaps a deliberate vote<br />
of no confidence in Andrew?<br />
PM: No, on the evidence we have, John, that was not generally<br />
the case. I think for a lot of people who voted it was; yes,<br />
I agree with that but for some of them and, of course, you<br />
are talking in margins where three or four made the difference,<br />
there were at least that number who didn't realise what they'd<br />
done. LAWS: Do you really think that he had not choice but to resign?<br />
HAWKE: Well, no he did have another choice. Indeed when<br />
he left the Party Room with the other three leaders they made<br />
it clear to him that there was no necessity to resign. But<br />
I pay him tribute. There was no choice in the longer term.<br />
He could have held the leadership yesterday but a challenge<br />
would have been inevitable within a relatively short time<br />
and I think Andrew's judgement was., correctly, that that would<br />
happen and that if that was going to be the case it was in<br />
the best interests of the Party to go now, rather than later.<br />
LAWS: Do you think the whole thing that brought it about<br />
the request that John Howard should state categorically that<br />
he wouldn't challenge him do you think that was necessary<br />
initially?<br />
PM: Well, I think it probably could have been avoided. I<br />
mean, as John Howard said, it wasn't something that had been<br />
required of anyone else in the past to which Andrew probably<br />
would answer, yes, but no one else in the past has been rfp"<br />
at the leader the way he had been. No, I think Andrew himself<br />
would agree that, VWiih the benefit of hindsight, that it could<br />
of been handled differently and should of been from his point<br />
of view; but I still, John, then go to the point that what<br />
happened yesterday wasn't just about the personalities of<br />
Peacock and Howard. There is very deep and abiding ideological<br />
differences in the Liberal Party and they were reflected </p>
<p>in a very large measure in what happened yesterday and that's<br />
why no one should delude themselves that yesterday really<br />
settled the whole issue. It hasn't. The factionalism and<br />
the ideological differences in the Liberal Party are going<br />
to continue.<br />
LAWS: The demand t hat Andrew Peacock wanted to place upon<br />
John Howard to me was extraordinary, I even thought it was<br />
unnecessary. Is it the sort of demand that you would ever<br />
place on anybody?<br />
PM: I would never need to, John. I mean I could only talk<br />
about the realities. In Lionel Bowen I have a very competent<br />
and totally loyal and committed Deputy Leader. ut I think<br />
really the view expressed by John Howard is, in this respect,<br />
adequate that you live or die on your performance and if you're<br />
performing well, you're not in danger, and it's really only<br />
if you've got some sort of apprehension about how you're<br />
performing and how troops are lining up, that you are going<br />
to start thinking like that I think.<br />
LAWS: Yes. Mr Peacock was expressing publicly that he was<br />
very pleased with his own performance.<br />
PM: Well, I suppose that it would be natural enough that<br />
he would. But I refrained yesterday and I don't really want<br />
to today to comment on his performance as Leader. I really<br />
think it's impossible for you or I to understand, John, just<br />
the trauma he and Margaret are going through. I don't think<br />
it'ys the time to.<br />
LAWS: I know, I agree with that. I feel very sorry for him<br />
because I think to be publicly humiliated, and he was, is<br />
tough on anybody ( Yeah, sure) and I do feel sorry for him<br />
today, but I think he is very fortunate to have the support<br />
of his wife, Margaret, who, I think, under these circumstances<br />
would be exceptionally supportive.<br />
PM: There is no doubt about that.<br />
LAWS: Okay. Well; it was good to talk to you. I hope we<br />
can talk to each other again soon.<br />
PM: I hope so, John. All the best.<br />
LAWS: Thank you very much. Bye. Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
Bob Hawke. </p>
