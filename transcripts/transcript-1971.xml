" It was announced from Coppins that The<br />

pleasure an invitation from the Australian Government<br />
to visit the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in August<br />
1969, when The Duke will open the Third South Pacific<br />

West Australia. ", The Duke and Duchess are expected to4<br />
begin their visit in Canberra from where they will travel<br />
to Port Moresby for the Games.<br />
The Prime Minister warmly welcomed the announcement<br />
of the proposed visit to Australia by Their Royal Highnesses. He said<br />
that he was delighted at the prospect of The Duke and Duchess of Kent<br />
making their first visit to Australia. He recalled the deep affection the<br />
Australian people had shown for the late Princess Marina, The Duke of<br />
Kent's mother, when she visited Australia in 1964 and their sadness at<br />
the time of the death of Prince Edward's father on Active Service in 1942<br />
shortly before he was to have taken up the appointment of Governor-General<br />
of Australia. Mr. Gorton said that while precise dates for the visit had<br />
yet to be decided, consultations will take place to prepare an itinerary<br />
and the details will be announced as soon as possible.<br />
