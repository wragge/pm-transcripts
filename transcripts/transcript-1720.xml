EMBARGO NOT FOR R'ELEASE BEFORE 7.15 PM<br />
Senate Election 1967 Q.<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER 4' ORAHi<br />
( MR HAROLD HOLT,<br />
Friday, 17th November, 1967<br />
( Following Is the text of a broadcast to be made by the Prime Mini ster, Mr<br />
Holt, over the ABC's network at 7. 15 pm. ( EST) this evening)~<br />
My colleagues and I don't conduct the business of this country<br />
as though It were a popularity contest. We deal in a responsible way with<br />
the problems and opportunities that come to us,* We need your support, of<br />
course, if we are to govern.<br />
You are not likely to take seriously the curious propaganda.<br />
line pit forward by the Leader of the Labor Party, that this magnificent<br />
country of ours is failing to male good progress. But perhaps we ought to<br />
get the record straight. In the few minutes of this broadcast, I cannot give<br />
you a complete story about the domestic achievements of my own Governmient<br />
and the earlier Governments with which I have been associated. But I can<br />
give you a few highlights.<br />
Consider national health. The aim of our National Health<br />
Scheme is to provide every citizen with a high level of medical and hospital<br />
services and without financial hardship. Commonwealth money, in<br />
increasing amounts, makes possible our hospital benefits, our medical<br />
benefits, and the pensioner medical services and pharmaceutical benefits.<br />
We estimate that for this financial year, we shall spend on the nation's<br />
health more than $ 270 million. In the last full year of a Labor Government,<br />
slightly more than $ 12 million was spent on health.<br />
Turn to our record on education. Before we came to government,<br />
Commonwealth expenditure on education was small, because education was<br />
particularly regarded as a State responsibility. It still is, but we have<br />
taken the lead in many new ventures in the education field. I can only<br />
s u min arise them here. We Instituted a system of university grants to<br />
the States and we established the Australian Universities Commission.<br />
We greatly expanded the system of Commonwealth scholarships. In<br />
partnership with the States, we have embarked on a major programme to<br />
establish colleges of advanced education. We have given grants to the<br />
States for science laboratories in government and independent schools.<br />
This is only a sketchy outline of a programme on education<br />
which we see as a continuing responsibility.<br />
It was a Government of which I was a member which first<br />
introduced child endowment into Australia. I had the honour of bringing<br />
the bill before the House of Representatives. Endowment is, we are glad<br />
to report, now a large item in our yearly Budget. / 12 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
At the other end of the scale, we can point to an impressive<br />
record in our provision to meet the needs of the aged. Apart from pensions,<br />
adequate housing for the aged has been a special innovation in our period<br />
of government. These, I repeat, are only pointers to the Government record.<br />
But they are timely when our opponents paint such a gloomy picture of the<br />
state of the nation. However dreary statistics might be, they give the lie<br />
to the pessimists. They show, for example, that a bigger percentage of<br />
Australians own, or are in process of acquiring, their own homes than<br />
exists in any other part of the world. We rank second only to the United<br />
States when it comes to the availability of motor vehicles in the population.<br />
Our record of sustained employment has not been surpassed in any free<br />
industr ielised country.<br />
So the general picture, as we approach this Senate election<br />
is, as the evidence of your own observation will confirm, that of a healthy<br />
and flourishing economy.<br />
We believe as Liberals that we have played an important part<br />
in bringing about the things we enjoy over a long period of Liberal<br />
leadership. We firmly believe that the free enterprise system we encourage<br />
is preferable to the socialist concepts of our opponents, and is proved<br />
infinitely better by the hard test of results. We always discover, when an<br />
election is due, that our opponents do not relish the facts of growth and<br />
prosperity. They like even less being reminded that our record of<br />
achievement on the Irme front is set in the frame work of a realistic<br />
external policy, and that this external policy has the support of the nation.<br />
