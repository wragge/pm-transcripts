FOR PRESS The following question and answer ( in themselves<br />
complete and verbatim) from a press conference given by<br />
President Lyndon Johnson on July 24 may be of interest<br />
Mr. President, will you give us your<br />
reaction to the attacks being made on<br />
Senator Goldwater by foreign officials<br />
and the foreign press?<br />
A. I think that the Amrerican people are perfectly<br />
capable of making their own decision with<br />
regard to the parties and the candidates, and<br />
I think that they will do that without the<br />
necessity of advice from anyone abroad."<br />
The exchange throws some light on the American<br />
attitude towards the sort of critic.. sm made by Mr. Calwell<br />
of the Republican candidate, Senator Goldwater, and Mr.<br />
Calwell's criticism of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies,<br />
for withholding comment on the United States eloction.<br />
R. CI MAkTEY<br />
Press Secretary to Prime<br />
Minister.<br />
