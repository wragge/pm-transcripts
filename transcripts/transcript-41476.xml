    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce the Prime Minister of New Zealand, The Right Honourable Jacinda Ardern MP, will visit Australia on 1-2 March.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand share the closest of bonds and Prime Minister Ardern’s visit is an opportunity to strengthen our special bilateral relationship and build on discussions held in November.</p>
<p>As we mark 100 years since the end of the Great War, we will reflect on the long history of Australians and New Zealanders fighting as one on battlefields across the globe and how we can continue to work together to address current and emerging security challenges.</p>
<p>Discussions will focus on the economic opportunities for both countries, and the region, that result from free trade and open markets.</p>
<p>In our economic discussions we will also focus on how we can promote further economic integration under the bilateral Single Economic Market agenda, which is already a remarkable success story and model for the world.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ardern’s visit will coincide with the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum, an opportunity for business, government and community leaders on both sides of the Tasman to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the relationship.</p>
<p>Lucy and I look forward to welcoming both Prime Minister Ardern and her partner, Mr Clarke Gayford, to Australia this week.</p>
