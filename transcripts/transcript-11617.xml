    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit the Republic of Korea from 19 to 21 May to strengthen Australia's economic and political ties with that country.  My visit will reciprocate President Kim Dae-jung's visit to Australia in September last year.</p>
<p>South Korea is one of Australia's most important export markets and a welcome investor in this country.  Our economies have a strong complementarity that makes us natural economic partners in many sectors.  We also share a strong interest in regional stability and have worked together to enhance security in Northeast Asia and East Timor.</p>
<p>I will hold talks with President Kim on a range of bilateral and regional issues.  I will also meet Prime Minister Park Tae-joon and other Korean political and business leaders.</p>
<p>I look forward to my visit and the chance to explore new opportunities for developing further our important relationship with Korea.</p>
