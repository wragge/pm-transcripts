CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FAREWELL DINNER FOR THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
AND LADY STEPHEN<br />
CANBERRA 14 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
Excellencies, Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
When in 1982 you, Sir Ninian, announced your decision to<br />
retire from the bench in order to take up the<br />
Governor-Generalship, I remember that many people in the<br />
community expressed surprise, and not a little<br />
disappointment, that Australia would no longer enjoy the<br />
benefit of your wisdom in the law.<br />
Many people seemed to think that the Governor-Generalship<br />
was not a sufficiently substantial post for a man whose ten<br />
years on the bench of the highest court in the land had been<br />
years of outstanding service.<br />
But the High Court's loss was very definitely the nation's<br />
gain. Very few of Australia's Governors-General, and indeed, very<br />
few of our Vice-Regal couples, have won such respect and<br />
affection as have our distinguished guests of honour<br />
tonight.<br />
Where many people had imagined the Governor-Generalship<br />
could involve only the ritual performance of empty ceremony<br />
and where some still saw it as the avenue of intrusion<br />
into the affairs of elected Governments Sir Ninian Stephen<br />
showed that the post could be very different indeed.<br />
You, sir, showed the Governor-Generalship was a post of real<br />
substance, and you imbued it and refreshed it with an<br />
articulate, accessible, distinguished and may I say a very<br />
Australian spirit.<br />
So I am sure I speak for all Australians tonight when I say<br />
that this nation owes a debt of gratitude to you for your<br />
work over the past six and a half years.<br />
The magnitude of the work is conveyed by these few<br />
statistics. </p>
<p>During his time in office, Sir Ninian presided over 275<br />
meetings of the Federal Executive Council, involving some<br />
5850 items of business. He appointed 40 Ministers and<br />
signed into law 1120 pieces of legislation.<br />
And he had to serve Prime Ministers of two different<br />
political parties. In this respect of course I trust his<br />
successor's task will be only half as arduous.<br />
But these executive duties have not, I think, been the most<br />
gruelling part of the Governor-General's routine nor have<br />
they been, in other than a formal constitutional sense, the<br />
most significant part of Sir Ninian's success.<br />
In a recent newspaper interview, Sir Ninian said he saw his<br />
job as Governor-General as being " to represent the<br />
Australian nation to the people of Australia".<br />
It's a seductively simple-sounding formula which in fact<br />
presents a challenging, important and very appropriate role<br />
for the Head of State as we enter the 1990s and approach the<br />
centenary of Federation.<br />
And how well both of you, Sir Ninian and Lady Stephen, have<br />
fulfilled this role.<br />
If Governors-General are effectively to represent the nation<br />
to its people, it is vital that they be seen by the people<br />
by all the people, in all parts of this country, separated<br />
as we are by vast distances.<br />
In the hectic Bicentennial year alone, Sir Ninian and Lady<br />
Stephen hosted a total of 510 receptions, dinners, lunches<br />
and other gatherings at Yarralumla and Admiralty House. In<br />
addition, they attended 146 functions in Canberra and 254<br />
elsewhere, and made well in excess of 200 speeches.<br />
For the past six and a half years Australians have seen, and<br />
come to respect and enjoy, the personal qualities which<br />
Sir Ninian and Lady Stephen brought to the task.<br />
Whether at Australia Day 1988 on Sydney Harbour or at the<br />
Fruit Festival at Cobar, here in the national capital or in<br />
a country town hall, they have conducted themselves with<br />
dignity, a generous and genuine interest in all they have<br />
met, and a clear concern for the Australian nation.<br />
In Canberra itself, Government House has been a warm and a<br />
homely place. Visitors to Yarralumla be they young Scouts<br />
and Guides on their first visit to Canberra, foreign Heads<br />
of State, people attending the recitals of Australian music<br />
and verse were charmed by a couple whom they found<br />
friendly, interested and approachable. </p>
<p>I might add and it is, as you will see, quite relevant to<br />
this evening's proceedings that I do so that I<br />
particularly commend the Australian style you have brought<br />
to the interiors of Yarralumla and Admiralty House with the<br />
superb selection of Aboriginal art that now adorns these<br />
buildings. Throughout your time in office, Sir Ninian, you have<br />
outlined your vision of a dynamic and vibrant Australia; an<br />
Australia unified by common ideals and a common commitment<br />
to the future; an Australia which, on that common ground,<br />
gains strength from the toleration, indeed the<br />
encouragement, of diversity.<br />
I salute you for your clear-sighted advocacy of the<br />
importance of building a multicultural nation most<br />
recently manifested in your call for Australians to maintain<br />
the linguistic diversity which is part of our rich<br />
* inheritance of immigration.<br />
Neither of us wishes to see an Australia which is insular<br />
and backward-looking; an Australia impervious to new ideas;<br />
an Australia which refuses to adapt to changing<br />
circumstances. Your role in ensuring that historic<br />
transformation takes place has been a crucial one.<br />
Let me say that tonight's dinner has a special significance<br />
for me, not only because as Prime Minister I know and<br />
appreciate the way in which the Governor-General has<br />
conducted the formal aspects of his office, but also because<br />
of the close personal relationship which we have enjoyed<br />
over the past six years.<br />
When you became Governor-General in 1982, you, like your<br />
predecessor, Sir Zelman Cowan, faced the difficult task of<br />
healing the wounds created by the events of 1975. Those<br />
wounds were slow to heal, and it is a great tribute to you<br />
and to Sir Zelman that you were able to bring reassurance to<br />
9 many of those who had begun to distrust the office of<br />
Governor-General.<br />
But I believe that you have succeeded in doing much more<br />
than that. When on Thursday Bill Hayden is sworn in as<br />
Governor-General, he will be receiving an office which has<br />
been revitalised; an office to which you have given fresh<br />
direction, and which, in the process, has acquired new<br />
meaning and importance in the eyes of many Australians.<br />
Sir Ninian, I have concentrated most of my remarks this<br />
evening on you. But may I make it clear that just as in<br />
your work you have been strengthened by the support,<br />
encouragement and contagious enthusiasm of your wife, so in<br />
thanking you for your period in office the Australian people<br />
also thank Lady Stephen.<br />
Let me say to both of you it has always been easy to refer<br />
to you in the formal fashion as " Excellencies". You have<br />
indeed brought excellence to the performance of your task. </p>
<p>4.<br />
We wish both of you well in your retirement. I am delighted<br />
that you Sir Ninian will be passing on some of your wisdom<br />
to the students of the Law Faculty at Melbourne University.<br />
I now call upon the Leader of the Opposition to support my<br />
remarks.<br />
