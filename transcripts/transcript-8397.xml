PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW/ TALKBACK WITH PETER KENNEDY, ABC RADIO<br />
31 JANUARY 1992<br />
E AND OH PROOF ONLY<br />
KENNEDY: Six weeks in the job* what's it like?<br />
PM: I have been around this for a long time but it's a place<br />
where the ultimate responsibility is and where the fashioning<br />
Of Policy and the government message probably occurs first, so<br />
it's an interesting# challenging job.<br />
KENNEDYI You were Treasurer for 8 years and obviously a high<br />
profile position but I just wonder is there a major difference<br />
taking that step from being Treasurer, high profile to being<br />
Prime Minister? I mean is it more of a fish bowl existence?<br />
PM I think so it's more of that, it's definitely more of<br />
that but the Treasury is a more specialised area but because<br />
we were reforming so much of commonwealth policy in the<br />
the Treasury portfolio had you virtually a finger in nearly<br />
all the other pies. The prime ministership in different<br />
because one has to think more in conceptual terms about the<br />
place as a whole rather than the economy and I think it is<br />
that part of it and plan all the-ceremonial things which one<br />
didn't have to involve oneself as Treasurer does make the<br />
thing different.<br />
KENNEDY: Do you f ind that a bit of a chore being involved in<br />
those extra ceremonial activities?<br />
PM; No I find it a pleasure but it is a different sort of<br />
Job. Some of the topics are similar and you are ranging over<br />
often similar ground. It's just a wider responsibility.<br />
KENNEDYs You have moved into the Lodge and as you said before<br />
you have been around for some time but I wonder what ' is your<br />
impression of the Lodge as a place for a family, a relatively<br />
young family as yours is, what's it like to live in? </p>
<p>PKI It's a bit of an institution, I think it's become a bit<br />
of an institution obviously. It vas originally made as a<br />
private house for the PM. it's really no longer that, the<br />
rooms which were the famil~ y rooms are now sort of public rooms.<br />
' they are not public when there is no one else there obviously,<br />
but they sort of can't be strewn with the family goods because<br />
they have to be cleaned out quickly if someone arrive.. So<br />
it'sa Sort of got a dual function now, a private house and a<br />
sort of public house, much more public house than say in the<br />
But it's got nice grounds and the kids like it.<br />
KENNEDY: I wonder if it puts extra pressure on them, doesn't<br />
it to keep the place tidy.<br />
PM: That'. right but they get a bit of help as well you see,<br />
There was none of that in the old place. My wife had to clean<br />
it up basically at least now she can do a bit, as well she<br />
gets a bit of a-hand.<br />
KENNEDY: Let's look At the issues. I mentioned some of them<br />
in the introduction, they are pretty awesome aren't they, some<br />
of the challenges that you are facing?<br />
PK: It is r think the challenge to get the economy Into<br />
recovery phase is important and it is a challenge and that is<br />
what we have been directing our attention to. I think we can<br />
do it and the quicker we do it the better.<br />
KENNEDY: Unemployment is the real problem, the real issue. I<br />
mean the growth in jobs was the big plus of Labor the f irst<br />
two terms of Labor in government and a huge number of job.<br />
created but all that has been lost hasn't it over the last 18<br />
months or 2 years?<br />
PM: No it hasn't been lost there, for what it's worth I mean<br />
in 1983 we had 10% unemployment and we have got<br />
unemployment today, lot plus. But in 1983 we had a workforce<br />
of 6 million today we have got a workforce of 7.5 million so<br />
we have kept 1.5 million jobs we created in the 80s, in other<br />
words the labour market is now 25% bigger in this very day<br />
than it was in 1983 but we are not keeping up the growth in<br />
employment, growth in the labour market so unemployment is<br />
again 10 odd percent. But the labour market itself is. a<br />
quarter bigger than it was in 1982/ 3 so in those years we<br />
created 1.6 million jobs and in the recession we lost 300,000<br />
so we have kept 1.5 million. So it's a more fully employed<br />
society than it would have been without all that growth but<br />
that is not enough, what we have got to do nov is make the<br />
labour market expand so that we take up the school leaver. and<br />
the new entrants to the workforce to get the unemployment rate<br />
down. KEVNEDY: That's the key the unemployment rate I guess has<br />
doubled in the last couple of years </p>
<p>PM, It's gone from about 6 and a bit to 10 and a bit.<br />
KENNEDYs So how do you got that economic growth to ensure<br />
that the economy is growing fast enough to absorb not only<br />
those school leavers who you mentioned are coming onto the job<br />
market but also absorb those people who have lost their jobs<br />
in the last 12 or so months?<br />
Mli It's basically called growth. You have just got to get<br />
the economy growing again, get people investing again, get<br />
spending happening, that is investment spending and consumer<br />
spending moving again and that is a confidence Issue I think.<br />
So the 80s was a great phase of spending and lending we have<br />
never seen anything like it since the 1920s and it was like a<br />
very big party and left a hangover and this in the hangover we<br />
are going through and I think that coming out of that is more<br />
than a glass of Alica Saltzer you know it's going to take<br />
because it was such a long spin. The 80s, the great growth in<br />
credit, the growth in Investment, the growth in the stock<br />
market, the speculation, the rest, the hangover has been<br />
longer than I think we would have expected. This has been<br />
true of Canada, the USA and Britain for the same reasons and<br />
we now have to get confidence going again here and In those<br />
countries as well and that's what President Bush was trying to<br />
do a day or so ago at his State of the Union message, that's<br />
what we will be trying to do in the next few week.<br />
KENNEDY: obviously one of the few plusses I suppose to come<br />
out of the growth and unemployment has been the decline in the<br />
inflation rate and that 1.5% national inflation rate obviously<br />
provides you with something of a base to sort of bounce of f<br />
with the recovery phase but it is important to keep inflation<br />
down isn't it?<br />
PM8 It is. It is because, look inflation is the most<br />
pernicious of all the diseases, For the elderly who have a<br />
stock of savings it tears it away and you take a lot of people<br />
who are, they might have had a retirement lump sum in the<br />
early 80s it's worth only a proportion of that today or the<br />
709. But worse than that, it robs a country of<br />
competitiveness it pushes up interest rates, it generally<br />
retards your economic growth,, it makes you uncompetitive.<br />
This government has broken the back of Australian inflation<br />
for the first time in a quarter of a century and it's a great<br />
achievement and we have got to keep it and do everything to<br />
keep it and so that when we go through the 90s, see we came<br />
out of the 82/ 3 recession with 10% inflation, we come out of<br />
this recession with 1.5 to 3,<br />
KENNEDYs Earlier this week you made reference to the fact<br />
that workers could expect a real increase in wages this year I<br />
think were your words and this of course caused enormous<br />
debate. What is the position? </p>
<p>PM: It wasn't what I said. No, it was basically<br />
misunderstood. What I said was, I was asked, well if you have<br />
a Budget forecast that's the August 1991 Budget forecast, of 4<br />
odd percent f or wage. growth but inf lation is only 1. 5% isn't<br />
there a real increase in wages there. And I said, yes well<br />
of course there is and I said success breeds success. That is<br />
if you can get your inflation down the real income about<br />
inflation will be present and in the August 91 Budget we had,,<br />
I can't remember the exact forecast I think It was about<br />
or 4.6 for wages it would come in about 1.5 or naybe an<br />
underlying rate a little higher, there in still a real<br />
increase there. That is not to say that the government in<br />
1992 will necessarily be supporting an increase that it a<br />
national wage case. That's a matter that has got to be<br />
considered. KENNEDY: There has been speculation of course that a further<br />
real increase could be looked at in 1992/ 93 but possibly<br />
through the form of a tax cut.<br />
P1( 3 That's been an option for us for a number of years and I<br />
made the point the other day that it was the 89/ 90 tax cuts<br />
which basically gave us the low inflation rate and it was the<br />
platform we moved into recession with was a wages outcome of<br />
around 6% 1. Without the 89/ 90 tax cuts that platform would<br />
have been 12 or 13 so today instead of looking at<br />
inflation we would have been looking at something 6. 5 or 7.<br />
So the Accord with the trade unions has been a very usef ul<br />
instrument and that is something which of course the<br />
government can always consider. But there has been a view<br />
about in the unions that they would rather take their chances<br />
in the market place or with the commission. Well that's fine,<br />
they can make their mind up about these things we are not<br />
going to be pressing money on them obviously. But again, the<br />
government would have to decide whether it would support a<br />
national wage case in the commission and that would take a<br />
careful judgement. But I mean some of the papers have gone<br />
of f on the basis that you know, I have said we are going to<br />
soupport a national wage increase, I didn't. What I was<br />
referring to was the Budget forecast for wages of 1991. 1<br />
heard Dr Hewson jumping up and down saying this is shocking<br />
for inflation, crocodile tears, while he is walking around<br />
with an inflation bomb called a goods and services tax which<br />
is going to add 15% to everything. So I mean, in terms of the<br />
inflation fighting we ought to forget him. I mean at least we<br />
have brought inflation down. He was John Howard's adviser,<br />
economic adviser, he left us in 1982/ 3 with an inflation rate<br />
of 10% we are coming out of this recession with an inflation<br />
of 1.5% so to all the hand wringers who have been putting<br />
columns In the newspapers about this issue just let me say<br />
this, that we have yet to decide what we do about wages in 92.<br />
Yet to decide.<br />
KENNEDY: But it's possible that workers will experience a<br />
real wage increase in 1991/ 92 and that doesn't mean any<br />
further </p>
<p>PH: The point I was making there is if people are wearing the<br />
burden of the recession they are entitled to wear some of the<br />
joy and some of the joy 18 the loy inf lation rate which means<br />
lower interest rates. That's part of the joy and it means<br />
higher real wage. by virtue of the fact that the inflation<br />
rate has fallen sharply. Now what are we to say to people<br />
it's now fallen sharply so we are going to grab another<br />
off you that you thought you were getting this year, the<br />
Budget was set up on a wage inflation trajectory of about 4%<br />
in that order and it's come in at 1.5 and that's good news for<br />
Australia, very good news.<br />
KENNEDYt But looking ahead to 92/ 93 the possibility of real<br />
wage increase but not necessarily through the tribunals,, not<br />
necessarily through increase in the pay packets.<br />
PH: The possibility of a wage increase, not necessarily a<br />
real wage increase, a wage increase but again it has to be<br />
considered by the government and the government is not<br />
committed to supporting a national wage increase before the<br />
commission in 1992.<br />
KENNEDYs You mentioned earlier that those ceremonial<br />
functions that the PH gets involved in is not always a chore<br />
and of course we have just come out of Australia Day when<br />
there has been a lot of debate and attention given to the<br />
origins of the country and whore we are going and of course we<br />
also had the launching of an alternative flag by former<br />
arbitration chairmen Sir Richard Kirby. Just wondering what<br />
your thoughts are on the flag and the possibility of changes?<br />
Pill I think the f lag has to be the emblem of the united<br />
country. iIs been that but I think there is probably some<br />
ambivalence in our message as we go into the international<br />
f orum. and the international marketplace draped in a somewhat<br />
ambivalent garb with a f lag which has obviously the f lag of<br />
another country in its corner and I should think that<br />
Australians would think they were advantaged in the world, in<br />
the international marketplace where kie are now trading much<br />
more than we ever were in the past something which was the<br />
emblem of a country which unambiguously has a flag which<br />
represents it and nobody else.<br />
KENNEDYt Do you see Canada providing something of a model on<br />
this? They went for the maple leaf more than 20 years ago and<br />
seemed to have survived.<br />
PM Exactly, I think Canada probably is a model and exactly<br />
they did survivethe place didn't fall apart, there wasn't any<br />
expunging of their history, I think that is true they didn't<br />
have into anarchy. It gets back to this question also about<br />
the national anthem. We are not singing God Save the Queen<br />
any more, we are singing Advance Australia Fair. it would be<br />
almost strange now to go back to singing God Save the Queen<br />
and I think those people who quite rightly are proud of the </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) f lag and have fought for it as they would have<br />
years ago stood up and sang God Save the Queen don't feel<br />
as though their view of history is offended by singing Advance<br />
Australia Fair any more than I think their view of the f lag<br />
would be of fended if we had a new one. Time Will tell, this<br />
debate has come and gone at various stages and it's coming<br />
again. KENNEDYt Do you see any time when a decision might be made on<br />
the possible changed flag for the country?<br />
PM: It doesn't surprise me this debate is around. I suppose<br />
people around the world are entitled to say we look at your<br />
flag you have got the flag of another country in the corner, I<br />
mean are you a colony or are you a nation? They are entitled<br />
to ask the question. The Canadians gave them an answer. They<br />
said no, we are one country, we are ourselves. We are<br />
independent and we look like we are. We represent ourselves<br />
as an independent country.<br />
KENNEDY: Is it a change you would like to see while you are<br />
PM? PM: I think it is something which ought to come in its turn<br />
as the community feels such a change is warranted then I think<br />
that's when it will come, not necessarily when I am P. or<br />
because I am PM.<br />
KENNEDY: It's good morning to our first talkback caller.<br />
CALLERs Not a lot of questions to ask you Paul I just wanted<br />
to run a f ew things by you and give you a couple of jabs in<br />
the rib to get going in the morning.<br />
PM: I always need to be attacked my boy to get me on my form<br />
so do your best.<br />
CALLERr Alright Paul. Thanks to the ABC, these lines are a<br />
great opportunity to speak out about what is going on but what<br />
infuriates me Paul is that political people treat these access<br />
lines like the Morgan 4wallop poll and that sort of thing and<br />
try arnd ignore what is being said by the local people like<br />
daylight savings etc and that sort of thing. Now the daylight<br />
savings seemed to have got through how the comunity didn't<br />
want it to and what I am wondering about is these boat people<br />
that keep coming in on the WA coastline. Why don't you get a<br />
boatload party of the Labor Party and send them under cover<br />
over to Indonesia and see if they can emigrate over there and<br />
see how well they are treated? I am sure they wouldn't be<br />
treated like Australian people are treating the boat people<br />
coming in over here.<br />
KENNEDYs is that the question Ken.<br />
CALLERs That will do. </p>
<p>7.<br />
PM.: i think we try and have secure borders we don't always<br />
succeed In that and we haven't obviously succeeded in this<br />
case. That is not to say we should treat people indecently<br />
when they arrive. We have to access them, people can be here<br />
for all sorts of reasons, catastrophies as well as simply a<br />
desire to come here for some reason and we have to assess<br />
those reasons within the context of our immigration Act and<br />
the administration of it.<br />
KENNEDYt Prime Minister, It does raise the matter though of<br />
the security of the coastline i suppose and the recent case<br />
where 50 or so Chinese people were able to land on the<br />
Kimberley coast apparently without surveillance.<br />
PM: I think we do survey the coast and surveillance is<br />
something which the government has focussed upon in the last<br />
half dozen years. But I suppose to do it absolutely would be<br />
a coat which would not be acceptable and it's a matter of<br />
trying to balance the cost against the effectiveness have a<br />
cost of fective surveillance system. Nov on this occasion<br />
someone has got through it, but generally we think it's been<br />
adequate and this will cause us to at least consider whether<br />
it's adequate. But to go from the sublime to something else<br />
where we actually have got very secure cover of every inch of<br />
the coastline would probably cost more than it was worth.<br />
CALLER: I am in small business and it's not so much of a<br />
question it's more of a statement. Small business used to<br />
employ 70% of the workforce in Australia back in the days when<br />
Australia had a full workforce, small business was booming.<br />
Labor in my opinion is the enemy of small business because in<br />
the last 8 years they have stripped all the so called lurks<br />
and perks from small businesses which are there to protect the<br />
businesses from the bad times such as we are experiencing now,<br />
a depression. I don't use the word recession, now the bad<br />
times are here and small businesses are dropping of f like<br />
f lies and they are taking all their jobs with it. All the<br />
incentives have been stripped for small businesses, introduced<br />
a killer tax for companies which is actually causing a lot of<br />
you know marginal companies just throw their hands up in grief<br />
PM But what killer tax are you talking about?<br />
CALLER: The killer tax with the new company tax where it all<br />
has to paid by December in a lump sum rather than split over<br />
quarterly PM: Just remember this, when I became Treasurer the company<br />
tax rate was 46%. it's now 39%. The rate of tax of<br />
distributed income wasn 78 cents itfs now 47 cents so don't<br />
talk about killer taxes it's not correct.<br />
CALLERs about killer tax because I have to pay them you<br />
don't. </p>
<p>PZ' 1 You are paying a lot leas than you used too. Can I just<br />
make the point about small business. Small business , there has<br />
never been a greater growth in the small business sector than<br />
through the 1990a the growth in the economy, the economy is<br />
growing 2.25 times faster than it was in the previous seven<br />
year. and it's growth that small business basically lives from<br />
and let me just make your point about the depression. In 1933<br />
the USA and the world was in depression in that country its<br />
GDP fell by 40% that year, this year in Australia it's fallen<br />
by 3 so you can't call a recession a depression. Certainly<br />
the recession is there and it's a pity that it is but small<br />
business lives of f growth. This government has given more<br />
growth to small business than any government in the post war<br />
years and what we want to do now is go back to giving it more<br />
growth again and that's the point of getting back to a<br />
recovery. CALLERs I was just wondering if you give me your attitude or<br />
ideas on the indebtedness we are now in as a nation. I know<br />
it's easy to say that there is not much federal and all the<br />
rest but I do believe a lot of the f ederal debt has been<br />
of f loaded back to the state and a lot of the states are<br />
running terrible debts. It concerns me that our indebtedness<br />
since early in the 80s was very very low it's now quite high,<br />
maybe you could tell us what the f igures are there. If that<br />
continues what will happen to us as a nation?<br />
PH: I think the number that matters, we have got about 100<br />
billion on private on shore debt, in other words the debt we<br />
owe abroad on the private sector is about 100 billion. But<br />
importantly it is private sector debt it's not sovereign debt<br />
and let me explain the difference. When the New York city<br />
banks decided to lend furiously in the 1970s to lend to<br />
countries, I think to South America, to various countries in<br />
South America believing if you lent to a country you could<br />
never be defaulted upon. Well the truth was they were<br />
defaulted upon because that debt borrowed by governments was<br />
not able to service itself it was debt for consumption and in<br />
some cases for investment. The character of our debt is<br />
largely private so it's borrowed against investments that<br />
actually service themselves and let me make another point to<br />
you. In the 808 we built up a substantial stock of debt as I<br />
said there was about 100 billion of private debt but in the<br />
same time we built up 63 billion of private assets offshore,<br />
private assets in Europe and North America as Australian<br />
companies went out opening Australia up have gone and invested<br />
in Boral, largest brick and tile manufacturer in the USA,<br />
Brambles runs one of the largest transport companies in Europe<br />
etc* We have got 63 billion over there and 100 billion<br />
onshore so in other words we are getting some balance into our<br />
assets and our liabilities. But the main cause f or debt isa<br />
the current account deficit because we don't produce enough<br />
goods and services and that is why we have got to go back to<br />
investment to produce more goods and that's the only way to<br />
beat it. </p>
<p>CALLERt Would you be able to help us with the state debt<br />
problem? Could YOU just elaborate what the<br />
PM: I don't think the state debt problem is an acute one.<br />
The states have always had soma debts but again a lot of those<br />
have been borrowed on income producing businesses like the<br />
electricity supply, like the ports and wharves authorities,<br />
like the water authorities, in other words it has the<br />
character of what is in many other countries private<br />
investment. See electricity is provided privately in many<br />
countries, water is provided privately. The fact that they<br />
are government owned doesn't mean to say they are not<br />
businesses and can't pay their way but it's always important<br />
for state governments to keep an eye on their debt but the<br />
commonwealth debt is very low. In fact the commonwealth has<br />
net assets abroad we don't have net debts we have not assets.<br />
CALLER I just think that it is a very serious problem if<br />
we PM: It's a serious problem if it grows inordinately but by<br />
and large the public sector has been repaying debt in the last<br />
few years. </p>
<p>to.<br />
CALLER: My question is totally different it's more a<br />
personal one regarding Mr Keating's attitude to Israel.<br />
KENNEDY: Well he's listening to your call.<br />
CALLER: Mr Hawke was well known for supporting Israel, how<br />
does Mr Keating stand?<br />
PM: Well I don't think you could say of Bob that he had<br />
an unbalanced view of the Middle East, I think he had a very<br />
balanced view and was critical of Israel on occasions for<br />
certain policies. But he thought Israel had the right to<br />
exist as a nation, as I do, and he promulgated that view<br />
quite vociferously in the 1970s but I think as Prime<br />
Minister, as problems became apparent in the Middle East he<br />
had, I think a balanced and appropriate view of the area and<br />
I don't think it is true to say that it was sort of one eyed<br />
pro-Israel view. I mean he kept the view that Israel was<br />
entitled to exist as an entity, as a nation, and that drove<br />
his view I think of that state but I've always found it to be<br />
largely a very balanced view of which I have a similar view.<br />
KENNEDY: Are you happy Ellen?<br />
CALLER: Thank you.<br />
KENNEDY: Mr Keating you mentioned Mr Hawke's name, there has<br />
been speculation that he might be quitting Parliament as<br />
early as February 24, has he spoken to you about that?<br />
PM: No, it's only speculation as far as I know, I<br />
haven't spoken to Bob about it.<br />
KENNEDY: How would you react to a by-election in March?<br />
PM: Well it's a matter for him, it's a matter for any<br />
Member when they believe that their career has peaked or for<br />
some reason they should contemplate leaving public office for<br />
them to make their minds up. Bob may choose to stay, if he<br />
does that is fine with me.<br />
KENNEDY: Do you expect that he would consult with you about<br />
his decision whatever it might be?<br />
PM: Well he might, it is up to him. I mean it is<br />
basically a matter of personal choice.<br />
KENNEDY: And a test for the electors in March wouldn't be a<br />
major problem?<br />
PM: Well that is anticipating him leaving. I mean a<br />
test for the electors shouldn't be ever a problem for a<br />
democrat, and I'm one of them. You can'It always win but<br />
giving the electorate a chance to make decisions has always<br />
been something that I have, of course, found great favour<br />
with. KENNEDY: Are you suggesting that the seat of Wills could<br />
possibly change hand in the by-election? </p>
<p>PM: Well I'm not suggesting anything. You are<br />
suggesting more than I am I think Peter.<br />
KENNEDY: Talking about meetings with the electors, Tasmania<br />
goes to the polls tomorrow. There is speculation that the<br />
Field Labor Government might be defeated, in fact the<br />
Australian editorilised this morning saying a Field victory<br />
is unlikely but deserved. How do you think it will go?<br />
PM: Well it is deserved. I don't know of any Premier<br />
that inherited greater financial problems than Michael Field.<br />
They are just unbelievable. I mean if you were the head of<br />
that Government you wouldn't have known where to start and<br />
yet by sheer doggedness he has actually brought the accounts<br />
of the State of Tasmania to the point now where they can<br />
actually pay their way and deal with their debt and<br />
restructure their State finances and I think it would be a<br />
great pity for somebody who has conscientiously taken that<br />
sort of task on thanklessly, and earned a few problems in the<br />
doing of it to then suffer a penalty for doing it.<br />
KENNEDY: How do you think you will go?<br />
PM: Well I think he will win because I think he<br />
deserves to and that's sort of sure footedness, the<br />
leadership he has shown and the conscientiousness of the last<br />
couple of years, you know deserves him a victory.<br />
KENNEDY: We will all be wiser tomorrow night. Bruce you<br />
are through to the Prime Minister.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Peter, I was just wondering you want<br />
ideas for getting the economy going again<br />
PM: Certainly.<br />
CALLER: I have put an idea through to the Royal Commission<br />
because of our trouble here over WA Inc and the projects<br />
and all the rest of it, the troubles that have gone on here<br />
and the idea was because of our vastness here in the West I<br />
want to cut West Australia into three states.<br />
KENNEDY: What do you think Mr Keating?<br />
PM: That is too tough for me. I think you ought to put<br />
that to Carmen. I think our constitutional arrangements and<br />
our boundries have presented us enough problems to this stage<br />
and we shouldn't be proliferating States in my view.<br />
KENNEDY: Ok Bruce thanks very much. Morning to Owen.<br />
CALLER: I want to talk about AUSTUDY. I'm a student and at<br />
the moment I have just enrolled for TAFE and my book list is<br />
about $ 160 which is relatively small compared to what some of<br />
the university students had and on top of that we have got to<br />
pay fees and everything else and I don't think students,<br />
especially who happen to be living alone can afford that sort<br />
of money.<br />
KENNEDY: Prime Minister. </p>
<p>PM: Well do you recieve AUSTUDY?<br />
CALLER: I do at the moment yes.<br />
PM: Well we have over the course of the<br />
dramatically improved AUSTUDY, particularly away-from-home<br />
and any government can only make choices about the level of<br />
subsidy for people on incomes within the income taper<br />
arrangements to support them and no doubt some people will<br />
find the levels to be insufficient. I can only say they are<br />
much better than they used to be by a very large factor.<br />
CALLER: Well that's little comfort to a whole lot of people<br />
who I happen to know simply because it is as far as people in<br />
the lower class goes it's better, it's more economic if you<br />
like to go on the dole at the moment than it is to study.<br />
PM: I doubt that because, that used to be true but when<br />
we changed to what we call the Common Youth Allowance and<br />
improved AUSTUDY away-from-home, what are you getting awayfrom-<br />
home now?<br />
CALLER: Well I'm not living away from home, my concern is<br />
my father is probably going to end up losing his job in a<br />
couple of months and I seriously doubt that I will be able to<br />
support myself and my father certainly won't be able to and<br />
I've talked to people who have lived away from home and apart<br />
from being very difficult to get living-away-from-home<br />
allowance it's really not enough.<br />
PM: Well it's double, I think from memory, double what<br />
it used to be and it was very sharply doubled. I can't<br />
remember the numbers off-hand but that and AUSTUDY-at-home<br />
was also increased substantially in the late 1980s. So<br />
again, all governments can be asked for more support for<br />
various categories of people in the community, we think by<br />
increasing the retention rates in schools, remember when we<br />
came to office only one-third of children went on to complete<br />
years 11 and 12. That's now between 66 and 70% and then<br />
funding extra places in universities and in TAFE and<br />
increasing student allowances we have made education a great<br />
priority in these years and successfully so, but again there<br />
is only so much a government can do.<br />
KENNEDY: Thanks Owen we will have to move on, last caller<br />
for Mr Keating, Paul.<br />
CALLER: How do you do Mr Prime Minister?<br />
PM: How are you Paul? With a name like that you have<br />
got to be a reasonable fellow.<br />
CALLER: Right, I'm taking on something that you might like<br />
to take on to try and generate cash flow for Australia, I see<br />
a great gap. Too many Australian inventions go overseas.<br />
PM: That's true.<br />
CALLER: Suggestion particularly private investors, number </p>
<p>il.<br />
one granting inventors tax exemptions on royalties income.<br />
Every inventor to receive one-third share employment and<br />
I could go on, giving f ive years moritoriun on tax of any<br />
description for infant industries that is dependent on<br />
inventions. Now we have spent over $ 50,000 on patents<br />
overseas etc but we don't get the necessary help, we have had<br />
no research grants and if it'Is good enough to give research<br />
grants to big companies, it's good enough to give tax<br />
exemptions to the individual.<br />
KENNEDY: Ok Paul, in essense what you're asking is what's<br />
the Prime Minister's attitude towards encouraging private<br />
inventors?<br />
PM: Well the flagship of the Government's policy was to<br />
allow businesses who invest in research and development to<br />
write-off 150% of the costs, now that means you've got to<br />
have a taxable income to do it and some people who, I mean<br />
that's for research and development which occurs in<br />
bussiness, there will always be the people who are not yet in<br />
business but have an idea and they may have other taxable<br />
income, if they do they can certainly write those costs off.<br />
The problem is always getting them to market. That's the big<br />
problem and I think, you know, this is a difficulty for us,<br />
it's a difficulty for other countries that we are not<br />
exploiting a lot of the technological improvements which do<br />
come our way.<br />
KENNEDY: A lot of the inventions go overseas for development<br />
don't they?<br />
PM: A lot do, a lot stay too, but a lot do and that's<br />
why the co-operative research centres which we set up in the<br />
Budget of two years ago between universities and business * Is<br />
trying to deal with that very thing, trying to apply research<br />
to commercial activities and having business involved in the<br />
doing of it. Now that will not, obviously, cover all people<br />
and I think Paul who I was speaking to is probably not in<br />
that category. He has got something which he's patented.<br />
But it is a difficult issue. How you encourage them<br />
commercially without the Government simply just writing<br />
cheques for companies hoping something will come of it.<br />
KENNEDY: Thank's Paul and thanks to everyone who called in<br />
this morning with their questions to the Prime Minister and<br />
apologies to those whose calls we were unable to take but we<br />
are beaten by time. Prime Minister you're heading up the<br />
Terrace to speak to the Premier, Dr Lawrence, and your also<br />
meeting with the WA State Economic Strategies Council.<br />
PM: I have intended to speak to each State Premier to<br />
talk about their particular problems. We'd like to do things<br />
which bring on a recovery but which at the same time is<br />
structurally good for the economy, for the thing to have a<br />
sort of productive focus. And the best way of getting a view<br />
of a government about its problem is talk to them directly so<br />
that's what I intend to do with Premier Lawrence this morning<br />
and with the business community of each particular State to<br />
try and get a feel of what they think is the problem, are the<br />
problems, and how the Government can remedy them or help. </p>
<p>Now my colleagues John Dawkins and Kim Beazley met members of<br />
the business community in Western Australia last week and<br />
they had a successful round of meetings with them. I will be<br />
meeting some different people today for lunch just to discuss<br />
these subjects and put it in the context of what the Premier<br />
says to me.<br />
KENNEDY: And when will you be announcing your Economic<br />
Statement? PM: Well the timing is not settled yet, I think for<br />
Australia the earlier the better but I can't be firm at this<br />
time, we have still got to put it together.<br />
KENNEDY: Obviously there is a lot hinging on it both from<br />
political point of view and an economic point of view.<br />
PM: Well I found the consultation process very<br />
encouraging, it is worth talking to people, they do say<br />
things you don't expect them to say often, they come up with<br />
ideas that you haven't thought of. We are working in a<br />
framework obviously, the Government had a general idea of<br />
where it's going, a clear idea in the broad, in the general,<br />
about where it's going but in that matrix often things can be<br />
fleshed out in these discussions which are very useful so<br />
I've found them quite valuable.<br />
KENNEDY: Well obviously the results of those talks and the<br />
contents of the economic statement are going to be crucial<br />
for a lot of people around Australia who want to get back<br />
into work.<br />
PM: Well we won't be letting them down Peter.<br />
KENNEDY: Prime Minister I hope you're right. Thanks very<br />
much for coming in and talking to 6WF and ABC regional radio.<br />
PM: Thanks for having me.<br />
ends </p>
