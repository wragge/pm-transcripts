<p>Community Cabinet meetings are a terrific opportunity for mums and dads, small business operators, retirees and local leaders to put forward a range of fresh ideas on local and national issues.</p>
<p>Our first Community Cabinet meeting in Perth last month provided my cabinet colleagues with some valuable insights and ideas.</p>
<p>All interested members of the public living in and around the Narangba area are welcome to attend. Please register your attendance in advance. The registration period is from Wednesday 20 February to Tuesday 26 February 2008.</p>
