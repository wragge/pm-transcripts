SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P..<br />
TO THE MURRAY VALLEY DEVELOPMENT LEAGUE MEETING<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, TUESDAY 22 OCTOBER 1974<br />
THANK YOU COUNCILLOR GEMMELL AND THANK YOU<br />
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MURRAY VALLEY DEVELOPMENT LEAGUE FOR<br />
ARRANGING THIS CONFERENCE TONIGHT ON A MATTER WHICH IS OF<br />
CONCERN TO ALL OF US PRESENT.<br />
THE MURRAY VALLEY DEVELOPMENT LEAGUE SINCE ITS<br />
FORMATION IN 1944 HAS PROMOTED THE CONCEPT OF THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTER-STATE BODY TO COORDINATE THE<br />
BALANCED DEVELOPMENT OF THE RIVER MURRAY AREAS. I UNDERSTAND<br />
THAT MR VERN LAWRENCE, THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEAGUE.<br />
IN HIS THEN CAPACITY AS ORGANISING SECRETARY. WAS ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH THE 1946 MURRAY VALLEY RESOURCES SURVEY COMMITTEE.<br />
ESTABLISHED BY THE CHIFLEY LABOR GOVERNMENT AND THE<br />
GOVERNMENTS OF NEW SOUTH WALES, VICTORIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE LEAGUE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE<br />
WATERS OF THE RIVER MURRAY AND ITS TRIBUTARIES AND IT IS<br />
LEA POLICY THAT THE RIVER MURRAY COMMISSION SHOULD BE<br />
RESPONSIBLE FOR WATER QUALITY. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THE RIVER MURRAY COMMISSION WAS, AS YOU ARE ALL<br />
AWARE, FORMED NEARLY 60 YEARS AGO WHEN THE RIVER MURRAY<br />
WATERS AGREEMENT WAS MADE. THE AGREEMENT WAS, AS NOTED<br />
BY DR CLARK IN HIS MOST VALUABLE PAPER ON THE ADMINISTRATION<br />
OF INTERSTATE RIVERS, " A PIONEERING AGREEMENT, NOT JUST FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA, BUT FOR OTHER FEDERAL SYSTEMS IN THE COMMON LAW<br />
WORLD", THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT COULD NOT HAVE SIGNED<br />
THE RIVER MURRAY WATERS AGREEMENT IN 1914 AND THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT COULD NOT HAVE PASSED THE RIVER<br />
MURRAY WATERS ACT IN 1915 BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THE RIVER<br />
WAS STILL BEING USED AT THAT TIME FOR INTER-STATE<br />
NAVIGATION, A MATTER ON WHICH THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT<br />
CAN MAKE LAWS.<br />
THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT AND ACT ENTAILED A SMALLER<br />
EXPENDITURE BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT THAN BY EACH<br />
OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS. THE LEGISLATION WAS CONCERNED<br />
WITH STORAGE OF THE RIVER'S WATERS AND LOCKS AND WEIRS<br />
FOR NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER.<br />
NOWADAYS THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO'INTERSTATE<br />
NAVIGATION ON THE MURRAY, ACCORDINGLY, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PARLIAMENT NOW HAS VERY TENUOUS, IF ANY, CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
POWERS TO PASS LAWS WITH RESPECT TO THE MURRAY. IN<br />
PARTICULAR, IT CANNOT BY ITSELF PASS LAWS CONCERNING<br />
THE QUALITY OF THE WATERS AND THE USE OF THE REPARIAN<br />
LANDS. / 2A </p>
<p>-2ATHE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AGREES ENTIRELY<br />
WITH THE VIEW PUT FORWARD BY THE LEAGUE THAT THE<br />
RIVER MURRAY COMMISSION SHOULD BE GIVEN RESPONSIBILITIES<br />
FOR WATER QUALITY IN THE RIVER MURRAY. I WOULD GO<br />
EVEN FURTHER AND SAY THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR AN<br />
INTER-STATE BODY TO CO-ORDINATE ALL ASPECTS OF WATER<br />
USE AND MANAGEMENT AND TO TENDER ADVICE TO<br />
GOVERNMENTS ON THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF RELATED LANDS.<br />
v / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS ALSO AWARE OF THE CONCERN<br />
ON THIS QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY A WIDE RANGE<br />
OF ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING SOME OF THE<br />
HONOURABLE MEMBERS OF BOTH MAJOR PARTIES PRESENT HERE TONIGHT,<br />
IT WAS THE SAME SORT OF CONCERN THAT THE PREMIEROF<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA , MR DUNSTAN, CONVEYED TO ME IN HIS LETTER<br />
ON 19 JANUARY 1973. IN RESPONSE TO THIS LETTER I CONVENED<br />
A MEETING BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE PREMIERS OF NEW SOUTH<br />
', IAL. ES, VICTORIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA ON 2 MARCH 1973 TO<br />
DISCUSS THE RIVER MURRAY AND THE POWERS OF THE RIVER MURRAY<br />
COMMISSION. AT THAT MEETING, ALL PREMIERS EXPRESSED CONCERN<br />
OVER PRESENT AND POTENTIAL WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS IN THE<br />
RIVER AND ALL SAID THAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMISSION<br />
SHOULD BE -INCREASED TO COPE WITH THESE PROBLEMS. WE. AGREED<br />
Ar THE MEETING TO ESTABLISH A STEERING COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS<br />
OF THE FOUR GOVERNMENTS TO WHICH A WORKING PARTY OF OFFICERS<br />
IS TO REPORT ON THESE MATTERS.<br />
IN RETROSPECT I BELIEVE THE WORKING PARTY SHOULD<br />
HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DEFINITE COMPLETION DATE; EIGHTEEN MONTHS<br />
AFTERWARDS THE WORKING PARTY APPEARS TO HAVE ACHIEVED LITTLE.<br />
I UNDERSTAND THE WORKING PARTY HAS ESTABLISHED<br />
EXPERT COMMITTEES ON SALINITY, WATER QUALITY, IMPROVEDJ<br />
IRRIGATION PRACTICES AND BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION. LAST YEAR<br />
THE WORKING PARTY SUBMITTED AN INTERIM REPORT TO MINISTERS,<br />
WHICH THEY ENDORSED AND WHICH MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS<br />
REGARDING MINOR SALT MITIGATION WORK. A vss/ </p>
<p>-4-<br />
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORKING PARTY'S COMMITTEE DEALING WITH<br />
WATER QUALITY IS LIKELY TO SUBMIT A REPORT BEFORE THE END<br />
OF THE YEAR RECOMMENDING A WATER QUALITY MONITORING<br />
NETWORK FOR THE MURRAY AND COMMENTING ON THE NEED FOR NEW<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO CONTROL WATER QUALITY.<br />
THE WORKING PARTY HAS ADOPTED THE POSITION THAT<br />
IT CANNOT MAKE DEFINITE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW THE FUNCTIONS<br />
OF THE RIVER MURRAY COMMISSION SHOULD BE MODIFIED UNTIL IT<br />
HAS IDENTIFIED THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
THE MURRAY RIVER AND THEIR ROOT CAUSES. I'CERTAINLY DO NOT<br />
ARGUE WITH THE LOGIC OF THIS POSITION; IT IS HOWEVER MY<br />
STRONGLY HELD VIEW THAT THERE IS ALREADY MORE THAN ENOUGH<br />
EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CURRENT POWERS AND<br />
FUNCTIONS OF THE RMC IN ASSOCIATION WITH STATE GOVERNMENT<br />
POWERS HAVE PROVED TO BE INADEQUATE. THIS EVIDENCE IS<br />
AVAILABLE BOTH IN TERMS OF TECHNICAL DATA AND IN ALMOST<br />
UNANIMOUS EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN BY THE PEOPLE MOST<br />
INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE RIVER SUCH AS YOURSELVES.<br />
I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT A MATTER IN NEED OF<br />
REFORM IDENTIFIED 18 MONTHS AGO BY MYSELF AND THE PREMIERS<br />
IS TAKING SO LONG TO BE EXAMINED. a. </p>
<p>THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS FIRMLY CONVINCED<br />
THAT THE WORKING PARTY SHOULD, IN PARALLEL WITH ITS TECHNICAL<br />
INVESTIGATIONS, BE LOOKING AT THE MOST GENERAL CLAUSES OF<br />
ITS TERMS OF REFERENCE, REQUIRING IT TO EXAMINE THE TYPES<br />
OF MEASURES WHICH NEED TO BE TAKEN TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE<br />
THE QUALITY OF THE RIVER MURRAY WATERS AND THE CHANGES WHICH<br />
WOULD BE REQUIRED IN THE RIVER MURRAY WATERS AGREEMENT TO<br />
ENABLE THE RIVER MURRAY COMMISSION TO UNDERTAKE SUCH<br />
MEASURES, IN SUMMARY, THE WORKING PARTY SHOULD BE CONSIDERING<br />
NOT WHETHER CHANGES SHOULD BE MADE IN THE RIVER MURRAY<br />
WATERS AGREEMENT, BUT WHAT CHANGES,<br />
THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS THAT SALINITY IN<br />
THE MURRAY IS ONE OF AUSTRALIA'S MOST SERIOUS WATER POLLUTION<br />
PROBLEMS, A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IS TO BE SPENT IN TREATING<br />
ADELAIDE'S WATER SUPPLY, BUT IT MAY SURPRISE MANY PEOPLE<br />
TO LEARN THAT WHILE THIS WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS<br />
IN MANY RESPECTS TO THE QUALITY OF ADELAIDE'S WATER IT WILL<br />
HAVE NO EFFECT WHATEVER ON THE SALINITY OF THE WATER BEING<br />
USED BY THE RESIDENTS OF THAT CITY, THIS MOST INTRACTABLE<br />
PROBLEM MUST THEREFORE BE DEALT WITH EITHER BY DIVERSION OF<br />
SALINE WATERS FROM THE MURRAY RIVER, OR BY CHANGES IN LAND<br />
USE AND IRRIGATION PRACTICES, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
CONFLICTS OVER USE OF WATER IN THE REGION ARE<br />
GOING TO INCREASE AS THE YEARS GO ON. AT THE PROJECTED<br />
RATE OF INCREASE IN DEMAND, SOUTH AUSTRALIA'S POST<br />
DARTMOUTH ENTITLEMENT WILL BE FULLY TAKEN UP BY THE YEAR<br />
2000, TO DATE NO ONE HAS MADE A COMPREHENSIVE, INTEGRATED<br />
EXAMINATION OF THE IMPLICATIONS WHICH DIFFERENT LAND USE<br />
PATTERNS HAVE FOR WATER RESOURCES IN THE VALLEY. TWO OF THE<br />
MOST SIGNIFICANT USES WHICH SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN SUCH AN<br />
EXAMINATION ARE, OF COURSE, IRRIGATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF URBAN GROWTH CENTRES SUCH AS ALBURY-WODONGA. SUCH AN<br />
EXAMINATION MIGHT INDICATE THAT CHANGES IN EXISTING OR<br />
PLANNED LAND USE ARE DESIRABLE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE<br />
QUALITY OF THE WATERS OF THE MURRAY SO THAT MAXIMUM BENEFICIAL<br />
USE OF THE WATERS IN ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL<br />
TERMS CAN BE OBTAINED FOR BOTH THE REGION AND THE NATION<br />
AS A WHOLE. THIS MATTER HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED BY THE<br />
WORKING PARTY. DR CASS PUT IT TO THE MINISTERIAL STEERING<br />
COMMITTEt LAST YEAR BUT THE STATE MINISTERS REJECTED'THE<br />
PROPOSAL. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING LARGE AMOUNTS<br />
OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALBURYWODONGA<br />
AND MONARTO GROWTH CENTRES. ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
IT IS IMPERATIVE OF COURSE THAT THESE DEVELOPMENTS<br />
DO NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THE WATERS OF THE<br />
RIVER MURRAY. I AM THEREFORE PLEASED THAT THE CITIES<br />
COMMISSION HAS BEEN SUPERVISING WHAT MUST BE ONE OF THE<br />
MOST COMPREHENSIVE WATER QUALITY STUDIES EVER UNDERTAKEN IN<br />
AUSTRALIA IN RELATION TO THE ALBURY-WODONGA GROWTH CENTRE.<br />
THE REPORT OF THIS STUDY WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER THIS YEAR<br />
AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL ENSURE THAT TREATMENT<br />
SYSTEMS WILL BE SO IMPLEMENTED THAT ALBURY-WODONGA WILL NOT<br />
HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON WATER QUALITY IN THE<br />
RIVER MURRAY, WHEN I MET WITH THE PREMIERS OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
AND VICTORIA ON 25 JANUARY 1973 IN ALBURY-WODONGA WE SAID<br />
THAT SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE<br />
STANDARD TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF OTHER USERS OF THE<br />
RIVER MURRAY; THIS STATEMENT I STILL STAND BY,<br />
THE IMPLICATIONS OF OTHER FORMS OF LAND USE HAVE<br />
NOT BEEN EVALUATED IN COMPARABLE DEPTH AND I SAY AGAIN<br />
THAT AN OVERALL EXAMINATION OF LAND USE IN THE MURRAY REGION<br />
IS ESSENTIAL, OUR POSITION IN RELATION TO MANAGEMENT OF<br />
THE RIVER MURRAY IS CLEAR: THE RIVER MURRAY COMMISSION<br />
SHOULD HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTROL OF WATER QUALITY<br />
IN THE RIVER MURRAY, FURTHER I BELIEVE THAT THE RIVER<br />
MURRAY COMMISSION SHOULD HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES IN<br />
RELATION TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE<br />
WATERS OF THE RIVER MURRAY AND ITS RELATED LANDS, </p>
<p>-8-<br />
IN A COMPLEX SYSTEM SUCH AS THE RIVER MURRAY VALLEY WITH<br />
ITS VARIOUS INTER-RELATIONSHIPS IT IS SURELY SELF-EVIDENT<br />
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A BODY TO COORDINATE THE PLANNING<br />
OF THESE VARIOUS ASPECTS. BECAUSE THE RIVER RUNS THROUGH<br />
THREE STATES, AN INTERSTATE AGENCY SUCH AS AN EXPANDED<br />
RIVER MURRAY COMMISSION IS CLEARLY REQUIRED. THIS CONCEPT<br />
OF AN INTER-STATE BODY MANAGING WATER RESOURCES ON A RIVER<br />
BASIN BASIS WOULD ACCORD WITH WORLDWIDE TRENDS IN THIS<br />
DIRECTION EXEMPLIFIED BY THE DELAWARE AND SUSQUEHANNA RIVER<br />
BASIN COMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES, NEGOTIATED BY THE<br />
STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, AND THE RECENT ESTABLISHMENT<br />
OF REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD SEE SUCH A BODY<br />
PRINCIPALLY PLAYING A CO-ORDINATING ROLE, MUCH OF I-TS<br />
FUNCTION BEING OF AN ADVISORY OR DELIBERATIVE NATURE ONLY,<br />
THE ORGANISATION MIGHT NEED SOME STRONG " LAST RESORT POWERS"<br />
TO ENSURE ITS EFFECTIVENESS. HOWEVER, EXPERIENCE IN THE<br />
UNITED STATES INDICATES THAT THESE ARE RARELY USED, IF AT ALL.<br />
WE WOULD ALSO SEE SUCH A BODY HAVING A DEFINITE OBLIGATION<br />
TO CONSULT WITH SUCH GROUPS AS THE MURRAY VALLEY DEVELOPMENT<br />
LEAGUEI / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
I AM SURE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS FOR LACK OF<br />
INTEREST IN THIS BROADER APPROACH TO THE USE AND MANAGEMENT<br />
OF THE RIVER MURRAY IS DUE TO A FEAR THAT SOME OF THE STATE<br />
POWERS MAY BE FORFEITED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHILE<br />
STATE GOVERNMENTS COULD LOSE SOME OF THEIR RIGHT TO<br />
INDIVIDUAL ACTION, I EMPHASISE THAT THESE RIGHTS WOULD<br />
BE VESTED IN AN INTER-STATE BODY ACTING IN THE BEST<br />
INTERESTS OF ALL CONCERNED. AS PUT SO WELL BY DR CASS<br />
RECENTLY, THIS IS A CASE WHERE STATES' RIGHTS ARE NONSENSE; IT<br />
IS PEOPLES' RIGHTS WHICH ARE IMPORTANT AND THAT MEANS ALL<br />
THE PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON THE RIVER AND ITS RELATED LANDS<br />
IN ALL THREE STATES.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO LITTLE IN THE<br />
WAY OF DIRECT ACTION IN THIS AREA; CONSENSUS IS THE ONLY<br />
WAY OF ACHIEVING ANYTHING. I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MADE<br />
SUGGESTIONS TO STATE GOVERNMENTS ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT<br />
IS DESIRED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE MURRAY VALLEY. WE SHALL<br />
CONTINUE TO PUT PROPOSALS BUT WE CAN DO LITTLE MORE. I URGE<br />
E FEDERAL MEMBERS HERE TONIGHT, WHATEVER THEIR POLITICAL<br />
PERSUASIONS, TO TAKE THIS MATTER UP WITH THEIR STATE<br />
COLLEAGU'. WITH A VIEW TO CONVEYING A GREATER SENSE OF<br />
URGENCY AND PRIORI,.<br />
I HAVE SAID THAT I AM CONCERNED WITH THE LACK<br />
OF PROGRESS OF THE WORKING PARTY. IF IN MARCH 1975 WHICH<br />
WILL BE TWO YEARS AFTER MY MEETING WITH THE THREE PREMIERS<br />
PROGRESS HAS BEEN UNSATISFACTORY, THEN I SHALL CALL FOR<br />
A FURTHER MEETING WITH STATE PREMIERS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN </p>
<p>AGREEMENT ON AN ACCELERATED PROGRAM FOR COMPLETION OF<br />
THE WORKING PARTY'S INVESTIGATIONS. THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE<br />
OF DIRECT ACTION THAT I CAN TAKE.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO GIVE<br />
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO REQUESTS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
FROM STATE GOVERNMBENTS FOR MEASURES TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN<br />
SATISFACTORY WATER QUALITY, BE THEY FOR ENGINEERING WORKS<br />
OR FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF LAND USE IN THE REGION.<br />
SUCH REQUESTS WOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARDS WAT ER RESOURCES<br />
MANAGEMENT. IN THIS CONTEXT I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT A<br />
SPECIFIC. OFFER MADE TO STATE MINISTERS By DR CASS LAST<br />
YEAR WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP THE AUSTRALIAN GOV'ERNMENT<br />
WILL PROV'IDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TOWARDS ANY STUDIES<br />
IN THE REGION WHICH IT CONSIDERS WOULD CONTRIBUTE<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE IMPROVED USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE<br />
RIVER MURRAY WATERS AND RELATED LANDS. BECAUSE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS APPEAR TO BE CONCENTRATING ON ENGINEERING<br />
STUDIES, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD PREFER TO FUND<br />
STUDIES BIASED TOWARDS THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL<br />
SC I ENCES. I / 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
SIXTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE SIGNING<br />
OF THE ORIGINAL RIVER MURRAY WATERS AGREEMENT AND I<br />
BELIEVE WE ARE AGAIN ABOUT TO ENTER A PERIOD OF CONFLICT<br />
OVER THE USES OF THE RIVER MURRAY WATERSI TOGETHER<br />
WITH INCREASING PRESSURES ON THE ENVIRONMENT. I DO NOT<br />
BELIEVE THE PRESENT RIVER MURRAY COMMISSION OR EXISTING<br />
STATE INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE ABLE<br />
TO COPE WITH THESE PROBLEMS AND I BELIEVE NEW ARRANGEMENTS<br />
ARE NECESSARY, I URGE ALL PARTIES CONCERNED TO PROCEED AS<br />
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP AN APPROACH TO THE<br />
MANAGEMENT OF THE RIVER MURRAY WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT<br />
THE WATERS ARE USED TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM REGIONAL AND<br />
NATIONAL BENEFITS IN SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL<br />
TERMS. </p>
