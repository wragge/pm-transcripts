<p>2 September 1974</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced today that he had forwarded references to the Industries Assistance Commission on what assistance should be accorded the production in Australia of cellulose acetate flake and agricultural tractors.</p>
<p>Both bounties have been in force for a number of years and were regularly reviewed by the Tariff Board. In the case of agricultural tractors the bounty has been in existence in one form or another since 1922.</p>
<p>The Commission is being asked whether assistance which could include bounty should be given to the production of these goods after the bounties expire in 1976.</p>
