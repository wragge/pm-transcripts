   It is with great pleasure that I announce the generous contribution of AMP<br />
   towards the fight against breast cancer.</p>
<p>   AMP has provided $1.1 million to the NHMRC National Breast Cancer Centre<br />
   for several key projects designed to improve early diagnosis and treatment<br />
   of breast cancer.</p>
<p>   Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in Australian<br />
   women. By the age of 75 years, one in three men and one in four women will<br />
   be diagnosed with cancer. The Government is committed to finding new ways<br />
   to combat this disease which affects the lives of so many Australians. Research<br />
   is the key to cutting back its reach and impact.</p>
<p>   Earlier this year I announced funding of $3 million for the Integrated Cancer<br />
   Programme to support cancer research and bolster the fight against this<br />
   devastating disease. When it became apparent that the NSW Government was<br />
   unable to match our commitment, the Federal Government provided an additional<br />
   $3 million taking the total to $6 million.</p>
<p>   The Integrated Cancer Programme is a joint initiative between the Sydney<br />
   Cancer Centre and the Centenary Institute. The Commonwealth funding will<br />
   allow the Programme to expand its research and ensure that the new cancer<br />
   research discoveries are applied directly to the clinical care of patients<br />
   fighting the disease.</p>
<p>   Additionally, the Government's decision to increase expenditure on medical<br />
   research by around $640 million over six years, more than double current<br />
   levels, is intended to ensure Australians continue to enjoy even higher<br />
   quality health care in the future. Women, as the majority of users of the<br />
   health care system, will be significant beneficiaries.</p>
<p>   The NHMRC National Breast Cancer Centre has become an internationally recognised<br />
   organisation that has had a significant impact on improving the care of<br />
   women with breast cancer.</p>
<p>   The partnership between AMP and the NHMRC National Breast Cancer Centre<br />
   is consistent with the Government's commitment to forge a new social coalition<br />
   to encourage business and individuals to engage with their communities.</p>
<p>   The commitment by AMP is particularly welcome and I commend its efforts<br />
   to help save lives and improve community understanding of breast cancer.</p>
