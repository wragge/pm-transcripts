ASIAN TOUR 1967 ' i~ 16<br />
TA IWAN<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT AT GRAND) HOTEL TAIPEI 6THAPIL, 1967<br />
PRIL-E MINISTER: Good Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press:<br />
I just propose to comment quite briefly first and then<br />
give you the opportunity of asking questions of me, but first may<br />
I thank you for your pleasant introduction, and all of you for<br />
the very friendly way in which you have greeted me this morning.<br />
I am now nearing the end of this fascinating first visit<br />
to Taiwan and the seat of the Government 0Ã± the Republic of China,<br />
and as you will no doubt be aware, wie leave at noon for the final<br />
stage of this journey I have buen making, the visit to South Korea.<br />
This is not the first journey I have made since becoming<br />
Prime Minister to countries of South East Asi"-and the Pacific,<br />
but this particular group of' countries selected on this occasion<br />
includes those which have not previously been visited by me, except<br />
for one quite inadvertent stopover for an hour or two while we had<br />
an aircraft diverted in the course of a journey I was making a few<br />
years ago to Tokyo. That is the only other time I have ever set<br />
foot in Taiwan and so this has been a true journey of discovery for<br />
me.&amp; I feel that not only have I learned a great deal in the<br />
other countries visited, as I expect to do in South Korea . aleo, but<br />
my visit to Taiwan, base onabled me to come closer to your leaders,<br />
to get to kniow several of them personally for the first time, to<br />
renew old friendships with others, to see something of your quite<br />
remarkable economic development, to see at first hand the treasures<br />
that you have preserved from your thousand years of civilisation<br />
and culture, all these things have been quite fascinating and<br />
stimulating for me and I am sure that I shall be in a better<br />
position to come to judgement with my colleagues c~ f the Cabinet<br />
on matters relating to your country and its problems as a result<br />
of tiis visit here.<br />
I would have liked to express publicly my appreciation<br />
to the Government, to the President and the Vice President, the<br />
colleagues in the administration for the generous hospitality<br />
we have received and for the very enjoyable and instructive time<br />
we have had while we have been with you.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, as I understand it, you might have<br />
a pre-departural meeting with the generalissimo? Can you tell<br />
us any major points to be discussed during this?<br />
P. M. Well, I haven't myself restricted the range of the<br />
discussion, it will be. for the President to indicate matters<br />
to me he might wish to raise. For my part, having already had<br />
the benefit of some useful discussions with him at our first<br />
meeting, there is no special matter which I wish to raise with<br />
him this morning, but I am sure that what passes between us will<br />
be mutually informative and in that sense helpful.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, to what extent, Sir, do the people<br />
of Australia consider themselves Asians<br />
P. M. Well, vwe are not racially Asians, of course, nor are<br />
we by historical development of -the Asian tradition or culture,<br />
but geographically vie are in the area of the world where the<br />
peoples of the South East Asian area and the Pacific generally,<br />
and indeed Asia as a whole, geographically are our neighbours<br />
and in substance, as a result of the relationships wie have<br />
developed over recent years, are very much not only our. neighbours<br />
but our good friends. 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
I think the very fa-ct thiat I have been able in the<br />
course of my own short Prime 11inistership to visit, on the basis<br />
of warm welcome, so many different countries of the area of<br />
differing political outlooks and social structures is confirmation<br />
that Australia does enjoy very good relations with the countries<br />
of the area. This has been, I think, exemplified fully in this<br />
visit where I am journeying to four countries very different in<br />
political and social complexiono. but in each country I have been<br />
most gratified by the warmth of w-. elcome which I and my party have<br />
received. A warmth which I kn-ow reaches not only to me but to my<br />
countrymen whom I represent.<br />
It is only in comparatively recent years that Australia<br />
has become conscious of its increasing involvement in the problems<br />
of the area. This involvement reaches not only into matters of trade<br />
butof political co-operation, and over at least five separate sets<br />
of issues in the last twenty-five years Australia has foutnd itself'<br />
militarily involved in the area, so w; e believe ourselves to be<br />
very much part of the Asian scene.<br />
Q. Sir, I have witnessed your troops in active service in<br />
South Vietnam. If the war cannot be concluded in limited detail<br />
are you going to send more troops down there?<br />
P. M. Well, that is a policy matter which would have to be<br />
discu ,* sed with my own Cabineti colleagues, and on the advice<br />
finally of our own military advisors, and, of course, following<br />
a request to that effect from the Government of South Vietnam.<br />
We don't send troops there without the approval, and indeed at<br />
the invitation, of the Government of South Vietnam.<br />
It will be realised that Australia has other commitments<br />
in other parts of Asia, for example, wie have troops stationed in<br />
Malaysia, Singapore, in Ubon in Thailand, and there is a large<br />
programme of training of our military forc'-s inside Australia,<br />
which draws on our regular forces to a. cozoiderable extent.<br />
So there are some practical limits as to how far wie can go in<br />
a period when wie are also trying to press on with the development<br />
of an under-populated continent, but when I mention that over the<br />
last four years we will have more than doubled our expenditure<br />
on defence, it will be seen that wie are making a grow%-ing<br />
contribution to the security of the area generally and the<br />
percentage of our gross national product devoted to defence is<br />
moving up between 4.5 and<br />
Q. Do you think thl ' t the countries having sent troops<br />
to South Vietnam should have a voice about the future courses of<br />
their forces in Guam and any other places?<br />
P. M. I am sorry, I didn't get the reference in what.<br />
Q. Countries that have sent troops to South Vietnam should<br />
have a voice about the future course of action there, for instance,<br />
in Guam or any other places.<br />
P. M. Well, of course, there was a gathering after the Manila<br />
Conference of those who had forces involved, and I am quite<br />
certain that if there were concrete peace proposals coming forward<br />
we should be consulted at all significant stages of such a<br />
discussion. Wie have no reason to complain in Australia of any<br />
lack of communication, indeed, we are in very frequent contact<br />
with the Government of South Vietnam, I would say through our<br />
Ambassador, virtually on a daily basis, and this is true to an<br />

<p>-3<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, how do you visualise the possibility<br />
of strengthening. the ties of Sino-Australian relations in terms<br />
of economy and culture?<br />
P. M. Well, I think visits such as the one I have been making<br />
and reciprocal visits from your leaders, will be helpful in that<br />
direction. Wde get to know each other more closely and our problems<br />
in more depth and dotail. As to trade, the briefing vie had from<br />
your Cabinet Ministers indicated very good possibilities of<br />
increasing imports into this country from Australia, as your own<br />
economy develops and we would recognise that if this is to be,<br />
then Australia must be looking to ways and means of improving our<br />
purchases from Taiwan. These 4re connections, I think, where we<br />
can be of help to each other.<br />
I suggested last night, and I was glad to find that the<br />
suggestion did not appear as difficult as I thought it might, that<br />
we could have on display perhape at some time in Australia some of<br />
the cultural treasures . hich you have here in Taiwan. One could<br />
think of a variety of ways wh-, ich the knmovledge oif the two<br />
countries can improve one for the other, and it will be my endeavour<br />
to promote this process.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, vie understand that Australia has<br />
recognised Outer Mongolia rec.-ntly. Wie would like to know if<br />
Australia has no tendency to establish an Emibassy to be used as<br />
a listening post w~ hat benefit can it get froma this representation?<br />
P. M. Wiell, I would like to communt on that in a little detail.<br />
It is a fact that the Government recently took a decision to<br />
recLgnise Outer Mungolia. This was not a matter which had been<br />
reached hastily or suddenly by us. It ha-, s been under consideration<br />
for some time and I want to make it clear that the decision was the<br />
exercise of an entirely independent judgement by Australia and was<br />
not the product of any pressure or influence from any other source.<br />
But ie have taken the view that recognition should be given to<br />
countries which observe the international standards appropriate to<br />
membership of the United Nations and we have put that view forward<br />
in respect of Mainland China on earlier occasions. But in the<br />
case of Outer Mongolia, they have been members of the United Nations,<br />
I think, for six years or thereabouts now.<br />
They have, so far as vie have been able to judge, observed<br />
the standards appropriate to membership of the United Nations.<br />
They are members of Ecafe and Australia next year will be host to<br />
Ecafe, an.-of all the Ecafe members attending that conference<br />
Mongolia is the only country which had not, up to this point of<br />
time, received recognition, and this did have a varyinS bearing<br />
on the time of our decision. Another factor that had a bearing<br />
on it was my own visit here.<br />
Now it may seemi strange to some people that one announces<br />
a decision which is not likely to be popular in the host country<br />
just before you visit that country, but I think you must understand<br />
something of the Australian character to rtecognise the significance<br />
and appropriateness of this. I would not like to have come to this<br />
country and have said nothing about this matter, and then<br />
subsequently, afte: r having enjoyed your hospitality, gone away<br />
and announced this decision. It would have been thought outside<br />
either that it had the tactical approval of your Government, in<br />
those circumstances, or else that objections had been raised which<br />
we had not been prepared to accept. So we felt it was fairer and<br />
honest more honest dealing to take our decision on what we<br />
believe to be the merits of the case and announce it before Ly<br />
visit here. 1o4* </p>
<p>-4<br />
The other factor which I would like you to bear in<br />
mind is that Australia has, it will be agreed, been a<br />
consistent supporter of the Republic of China, in the United<br />
Nations. We have joined consistently in backing your own<br />
moves to maintain your independent position and status, and<br />
we were, I think, very helpful to you particularly on this<br />
last occasion, when thanks to -the effLorta of your Foreign<br />
Minister and his colleagues of the Government, a very good vote<br />
was secured on the issue of recognition.<br />
Now Australia is likely to be more persuasive and<br />
have more impact on other countries, if they feel vie do have<br />
an independent judgement. We do exerciae that judgemient honestly<br />
and fairly than if they get the impression that we just go along<br />
automatically with any particular decision, and I think this is<br />
well recognised by your Government as being typical of the<br />
Australian attitude. We like to feel that we act with firmness<br />
and forthrightness but with friendliness and in the case of your<br />
own country we can fairly claim to be staunch friends throughout.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, may I know what is your evaluation<br />
of the cha'_ nces of the Chinese people on the Mainland to regain<br />
their freedom, particularly in view ol" the political troubles<br />
on the Mainland, after your discussions with our President Chiang<br />
and our Vice President?<br />
P. M. I think you would be able to get a much more satisfactory<br />
answer on that matter from your own Govenment here than you could<br />
hope to get from somebody as remote from the Mainland as we are.<br />
I have been trying as I have gone around, and I have asked the same<br />
question in the three governments w-, hich I have visited, what is<br />
their evaluation of what is going on on the Mainland of China?<br />
I am sure that your own government is the best informed of all the<br />
governments I have visited and I would hope in the course of this<br />
morning before I leave, to have some more information on that<br />
matter, as I have a briefing with some of your authorities and<br />
also shall be talkinG with the President, but in Australia vie have<br />
very inadequate facilities for reporting in any . authorative way<br />
in what is going on in either the cities or the countryside of the<br />
Mainland. Any more questions<br />
Q. Some on the latest immigration policy, I Llean your<br />
policy as to be understood or misunderstood by Asia?<br />
P. M. Well, I thinkc the-,: e is a good deal of misunderstanding of<br />
it, not only on the part of the Governmaents of the countries of<br />
Asia. We find a quite understanding attitude amongst them, after<br />
all, there is not a country that I Icnow which doesn't maintain<br />
a policy of immigration control. But in the sense that there has<br />
been some ff-eling in the past of racial discrimination in Australia<br />
I think that experience of Asians who have come to Australia in<br />
recent years has helped to dissipate that very largely, and there<br />
have been liberalisations of policy which have contributed to this.<br />
I pointed out, when a similar question was asked in Hong Kong the<br />
other day, that since the var some thirty thousand people of Asia,<br />
and others who would have not been admitted under the rules which<br />
applied before the war, have come into Australia.<br />
There have been many thousands-who have taken out<br />
naturalisation at the moment there is some twelve thousand students<br />
from Asian countries in our schools and in our universities,<br />
sometimes occupying places in univora ' itioa L. in university categories<br />
on which quotas have to be imposed for Australian students, and<br />
these become very good ambassadors for Australia when they come<br />
back. Those of you who visit our country, I am sure, will find<br />
friendliness, complete absence of discrimination and a warm welcome<br />
to you. But wie have a problem of social integration in a relatively<br />
small population of people and wie think that the trend is in the right<br />
direction and this is intelligently perceived, I believe, by the<br />
governments of the countries of Asia. </p>
