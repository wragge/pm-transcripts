PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTERt, THES HON 1' J KEATING<br />
THlE RESIGNATION OF JOHN BANNON<br />
John Bannon today took the courageous decision of taking the political responsibility for<br />
financial losses associated with thc State Bank, and in so doing has given South Australia<br />
the chance to overcome its difficulties and to grow with the rest of thc country.<br />
John Bannon produced and maintained onc of thc most sound financial positions of any<br />
State in thc Commonwealth. The State's finances wcre not put in difficulty by general<br />
government recurrenh spendlng, but rather by losses generated by a financial institution<br />
which the State owned.<br />
Over thc past decade, John Bannon has effcctivcly presided over the redevelopment of<br />
South Australian industry and commerce to produce a much more efficient and robust<br />
economy. He has done all the things a good Premier should do to keep activities in his or<br />
her State flourishing.<br />
I have come to know John Bannon well over a pcriod of nearly ten years. He has always<br />
bccn a person of substance and integrity, whose serv-ices as a leader in our political system<br />
will be missed.<br />
