TRANSCRIPT OF TIE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP CANBERRA, 6 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I want to say something about the Coalition's trade policy. The Coalition is<br />
basically out of control on the question of trade and the reason it is, is because Dr<br />
Ilewson was embarrassed in Queensland ovcr the issue of sugar tariffs. In an<br />
attempt to divert attention from the divisions betwecn himself and the National<br />
Party over tariffs he has lashed out at the United States and Japan, and in a most<br />
erratic display he is now scking to line Australia up behind Mexico and Chile to<br />
get a trade pact with the Americas while turning our back, as he would, our back<br />
upon Japan, South Korea, Singapore, ASEAN, all the places where our trade is<br />
grcatcst and where our trade is growing fastcst. There is no more important thing<br />
that any Australian political party or leader can do then to orient Australia well in<br />
the area of international trade.<br />
But what we have hcrc is a basically a naive, primitive approach where Dr Hewson<br />
is attcmpting to throw our lot, Australia's lo, in with a country, the United States,<br />
which doesn't want us and for which the greater part of our trade is now managed<br />
with quotas, voluntary restraints, etc. As well, I noticed Mr Hill attacking the<br />
failure of APEC, the one body which keeps Australia trading and part of the Asia-<br />
Pacific, certainly a trade-liberalising sense with Continental Asia, the Asia-<br />
Pacific and the Unitcd States and Canada, APEC, the one body that the Opposition<br />
is attacking. So wc have got Dr Hcwson saying he wants to attack the United<br />
States, but at the same time be part of it. Mr Fischer yesterday said the United<br />
States is trade enemy number one, but today they want to be part of it, and at the<br />
same time line up behind Chile, Mexico to become part of an America's trading<br />
block where we would have to get the consent of their Parliaments, the Mexican,<br />

<p>TEL: ?. Sep. 92 7: 59 No. 001 P. 02/ 04<br />
2<br />
US and Canadian Parliaments, to be part of an area where a very nmodest volume of<br />
our trade and certainly trade growth goes.<br />
Now on top of all that, we have got Mr Lloyd and Mr Fischer wanting to subsidisc<br />
Australian wheat. These are thc Coalition leaders of the Coalition with Dr<br />
R-ewson', where-Dr Hewson says no subsidies, zero tariffs, no sugar subsidies, no<br />
wheat subsidics, but they say, yes you should subsidlise Australian wheat. So you<br />
can sce how erratic the Opposition now is. Once they fall away from the supposed<br />
fall-back to the Fighitback document, which is itself full of holes and blown to<br />
picces, they are entirely erratic, whether it is on trade, whether it is on industrial<br />
relations, whatever It mightl be there is no dcpth and policy substance in them. So<br />
Dr Hewson says no subsidies, Mr Fischer and Mr Lloyd say they want to subsidise<br />
Australian wheat.<br />
And then you have got the spectacle of Mr Johnston, from Toyota, saying that he<br />
is fed up with the Opposition, their " no-listening thing" as he calls it, amiazes him.<br />
He said that the notion that the Opposition want to attack this Government for<br />
stopping the import of Japanese uscd cars, used cars, into our market was a matter<br />
which of course he found complctely inexplicable.<br />
So I make the point that it is entirely natural for Canada and Mcxico to be part of<br />
the United States, nearly 70 per cent of their exports go to the United States. Only<br />
12 pcr cent of our exports go to NAIA, yet our greatest trading partner, Japan,<br />
whcrc we now run a huge trade surplus, Singapore our third largest partner, South<br />
Korca, ASEAN, where the growth in trade has been at 1.51 per cent growth over I<br />
think three years, I will give you the exact figure in a moment. Exports at<br />
around over the past five years from $ 2.6 billion to $ 6.5 billion, we're<br />
supposed to fly over them on the way to California.<br />
J: Andrew Peacock, as far as he is recognised in this dilemma, was saying this<br />
morning that you can't have the best of both worlds.<br />
PM: What wc are trying to do is have the best of all worlds, the Government, wc are<br />
trying to chart for Australia a country which is not naturally part of any bloc, to<br />
have trade liberalising in thc Asia-Pacific through APEC, bilateral trade links with<br />
particular countries like Japan, South Korea, Singapore, ASEAN and that group, as<br />
well as continuing the press for market access into the United States and Canada.<br />
That's the wise approach; thc dumb approach is to try and line up behind Mexico<br />
and Chile to become part of a trading block where we are not naturally a part,<br />
whcre they don't want us, and our exports are now managed by quotas and<br />
voluntary restraints.<br />
Fancy turning your back on the place wherc you live, which is growing the fastest,<br />
where your success is the grcatcst. I mean isn't this the Liberal Party when it really<br />
gets down to it? They've always have got to have some paternal hand on them, it is<br />
the United Statcs in thc end. Mr Fischer may say they are enemy number one but </p>
<p>TEL: r ep Iz z): 1Z I4U VUI r<br />

they want to go back under the skirts of the United States because they are only<br />
safc if they can taxi it round Washington. They don't want the alien markets, as<br />
they see it, of Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia. No, that's too hard for<br />
them. They arc not English-speaking markets, they don't know the culture there,<br />
and for the dear old Liberal Party the only place they call home is either London or<br />
Washington.<br />
J: agricultural exports to Japan, I mean we can't get in there with rice for<br />
example? I<br />
PM: But we get in there in a pretty big way with coal, don't we? With iron ore, with<br />
beef as they liberal ise those beef markets, and they are on a process of trade<br />
liberalisation, and they have been doing it with pressure but again the big<br />
stroke Is GAIT, the big multilateral stroke is GATT and that's where you get a<br />
systemic opening up and that's why the Government has put its greatest effort on<br />
it. Writing to an American President in the middle of an election campaign, hoping<br />
that you will gct some redress on something for which they have taken a political<br />
initiative, and which the administration is saying where they will seek to avoid<br />
impact on markets whcre Australia exports its product, is futile. But no worse than<br />
taking the mindless and unthoughtful step of saying we will be part of the North<br />
American free trade area. The Government thought about these things in the<br />
John Dawkins, Bob Hawke, myself, all discussed these subjects, North American<br />
trade in the middle<br />
J: On Friday Mr Dawkins did say we should be part of NAFTA..<br />
PM: No, he didn't say that at all. lie said we are a trade with North America, the Asia-<br />
Pacific is our area, APEC is the institutional body that we want to see develop,<br />
which we have preposed which the US has adopted, with the whole of the Asia-<br />
Pacific has adopted, an Australian initiative has been adopted in this area which is<br />
going to be a trade libcralising force. Senator Hill, the foreign affairs spokesman,<br />
says we don't want a bar of it, the fact is they are all over the place, Dr l-ewson is<br />
slipping and sliding throughi the North Queensland cane fields, while Mr Fischer is<br />
behind him saying we will subsidise it, while you have got the National Party<br />
saying they will drop out of any arrangement on reductions in tariffs on sugar,<br />
while you have got the car industry saying, don't attack Japan, you're not listening.<br />
The fact is this man is erratic and he is all over the place and his trade policies are<br />
a danger to Australia.<br />
J: Mr Keatirng you mentioned GATT, what is your prognosis now for the outcome of<br />
the trade talk%?<br />
PM: Well this move by the Americans will put more spice into the round, obviously. I<br />
think that there will be more pressure to gct an agreement so that these subsidies<br />
wars, people will desist from them. Obviously the best international backdrop to </p>
<p>TEL: u. ue r -4 v4<br />

good and fair trade is to extend the GATT agreements of the ' 60s in goods into<br />
agriculture and scrvices in the<br />
J: Are you optimistic about a satisfactory agreement though, Or not?<br />
PM: I remain optimistic yes, I think something reasonable will come from it.<br />
do you think there Is any point in any US contact between us and the<br />
Americans<br />
PM: it is like two noisy neighbours, instead of yelling out over the back fence we have<br />
basically gone and callcd the police, we have gone to GAIT and said look letes<br />
bring the Americans under scrutiny here. It is the toughest thing we have done.<br />
J: Mr Dawkins also said last wcek that there are a number of ways we could get back<br />
at thc Europeans who are the true villains in this trade war. Do you agree with Mr<br />
Dawkins?<br />
PM: Well they started the trade war. They started the subsidies, by first of all building<br />
production subsidies and then extending them into cxports, so they promote the<br />
development of large quantities of produce and not content with simply seeing the<br />
butter mountain, or the wine lake, or the rest of it obtained, they then want to<br />
subs idise its exports, the US joined them in that to protect their markets. And the<br />
bcst result in all of that is a general agreement in the GAIT about trade.<br />
J; But how long can this GATT process keep going on?<br />
PM: Well it Is coming obviously to its conclusion.<br />
J: So In the longer run the US actions may actually be in our favour?<br />
PM: The key phrase is to get a good backdrop for international trade, the great growth<br />
in incomes postwar have come from the success of the Kennedy Tokyo round in<br />
GATT and international trade, and a general agreement in that is what we need.<br />
We don't want to be hiding under someone's skirts, and particularly someone who<br />
doesn't want us.<br />
