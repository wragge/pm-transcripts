I.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF MANNING CLARK CENTRE, ANU, CANBERRA<br />
22 FEBRUARY 1994<br />
I count it as a great honour to be asked to open this<br />
Centre tonight I count the late Manning Clark as a<br />
great Australian.<br />
And I may as well say at the beginning, I have absolutely<br />
no doubt that his work and reputation will long out live<br />
his recent detractors.<br />
Generosity will always triumph over meanness. Creativity<br />
over negativity.<br />
I used to pay Manning Clark an occasional visit in<br />
Tasmania Circle on my way home from work.<br />
I was by no means a close friend and on the face we had<br />
not much in common.<br />
Manning was a man of great formal learning. I left<br />
school at<br />
Manning went to Melbourne Grammar, Melbourne University<br />
and Oxford.<br />
I went to De La Salle, Bankstown, Belmore Technical<br />
College, the Federated Municipal and Shire Council<br />
Employees Union, and the Australian Labor Party.<br />
I am a politician. Manning was an historian.<br />
Perhaps for these reasons we talked less about Australian<br />
politics than Australian possibilities, less about<br />
Australia's history than Australia's future.<br />
In fact we found that we had a gnnd dpa in common. 41303 </p>

I know Manning has developed a reputation as a pessimist,<br />
but I never found him to be that. It is true that he had<br />
deep awareness of opportunities lost opportunities for<br />
building a more just society. A kinder and more creative<br />
society. A society with a more independent view, a more<br />
mature identity.<br />
He was disappointed by what he believed had been promise<br />
squandered by faint hearts and narrow minds.<br />
That did not mean he had no regard for what Australians<br />
had achieved, or love for the character and traditions of<br />
the place. His affection for Australia was huge it<br />
defined him.<br />
And he had enormous regard for Australian achievements.<br />
Surely, no one left more evidence of that regard than he<br />
did in his six volume history, his countless other books<br />
and articles on Australian history and in his immense<br />
contribution as a teacher of Australian history.<br />
This Centre will not only bear his name, but I hope carry<br />
on his work.<br />
Among such distinguished academic company and people who<br />
knew Manning Clark very well over a long period, it would<br />
not be appropriate for me to even attempt an appreciation<br />
of Manning's work.<br />
I can only say that from what I know of it and what I<br />
knew of him, I drew a lot of inspiration.<br />
He wanted to believe in Australia and, through all the<br />
doubts he had, he did believe.<br />
And I confess that there have been times in the last two<br />
years when I have wished that he was alive to see some of<br />
the things which are happening in Australia now.<br />
I mean in part the initiatives we have taken on issues<br />
broadly related to our national identity.<br />
I also mean the stand we have taken and the legislation<br />
we passed in response to the High Court decision on<br />
native title and I must say I wish he had been in<br />
Darwin the weekend before last to see a well appreciated<br />
multicultural football match between Collingwood and the<br />
Aboriginal All Stars.<br />
But I also believe Manning Clark would have appreciated<br />
what I think is a new confidence and optimism, a new<br />
sense among Australians of their capacity to carve out a<br />
good society and a creative role in the world.<br />
In other words, I think he would be excited by the signs<br />
that in the 1990s we might be about to truly live up to<br />
both our best traditions and our unique potential.<br />

<p>As I said, I'm not an historian not in the sense that<br />
Manning Clark was and many of the people here are. But<br />
I've been in the Labor Party for 35 years and in the<br />
Labor Party we are &amp; Ul historians.<br />
We know how important having a story is it's just about<br />
the most important thing there is.<br />
Because Manning Clark, as a teacher and writer, did more<br />
than anyone else to unravel and tell that story I know<br />
how much Australia owes him.<br />
Which is why I said at the beginning that I count it as a<br />
great honour to formally open this Manning Clark Centre<br />
and that is what I now formally do. 460.5 </p>
