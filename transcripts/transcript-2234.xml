ELECTION RESULTfS<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
My warmest congratulations go to Sir Henry Bolte on leading<br />
his Liberal Government back for its sixth term of office. Victoria can<br />
be sure of a continuation of" stable, responsible and progressive Government<br />
with Sir Henry and his Liberal team returned to the Treasury Benches.<br />
I am sorry that Mr. Steele Hall was unsuccessful in South Australia.<br />
He was a vigorous champion for his State, and had achieved much in his<br />
two years of office. T here was little variation in voting trends compared<br />
with the last state election in South Australia, but electoral redistribution<br />
was a key factor in Labor's success.<br />
The huge drop in ALP support was the feature of the by-election<br />
in the A. C. T. The Labor Party's first preference vote was down by a<br />
staggering 31 percent fromn 67. 72 percent in, the General Election seven<br />
months ago to 36.06 percent on the votes counted so far. To some<br />
extent, this is a tribute to the personal popularity and standing of the<br />
previous Labor member, the late Mr. Jim Fraser. But such a massive<br />
defection must be cause for concern for the Labor Party.<br />
Despite the field of seven candidates, the Liberal candidate,<br />
Mr. Hermes, has improved marginally the vote for his Party, compared<br />
with the General Election last year. However, it is disappointing that<br />
more of the former Labor vote did not come to us.<br />
For the first time since Jim Fraser entered the Parliament in<br />
1951, the election in the A. C. T. will be decided on preferences, and<br />
so it will be some days before the result is known..<br />
