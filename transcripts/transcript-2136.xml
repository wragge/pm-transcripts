DECLARATION OF HIGGINS POLL<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton NOVEMER 1969<br />
The first thing I would like to do is to express my gratitude<br />
to the electors of Higgins for the majority they gave me. I also want to<br />
express my gratitude to all those who worked so hard during the eleCtion<br />
campaign, manning booths, sending out literature and doing all the work<br />
required for a successful election. I thank you very much indeed for that<br />
and I pledge that I will try to be a representative in the new Parliament<br />
worthy of your work and support.<br />
I am pleased to see that the Government has been returned<br />
with a majority which looks as if it will be a good working majority of<br />
seven or nine, because I feel it would have been, as I said in the campaign,<br />
dangerous indeed for Australia if the Government had not been returned.<br />
And that is the second point I want to make.<br />
Having said that, I think that I should point out that there<br />
was undoubtedly a swing against the Government during the election<br />
campaign. It was a swing greater than would be expected. One had to<br />
expect a swing of some kind back from an all-time high but not one<br />
sufficient to lose 13 or 14 seats, and not one of the magnitude, particularly<br />
in States outside Victoria, which was shown.<br />
I think this is an indication that while the Government has<br />
been returned, the electorate has not been completely satisfied. There<br />
is some dissatisfaction shown by the vote and it is necessary for that to<br />
be identified and rectified. This will be the task of my Government<br />
assuming it is my Government after Friday, and I confidently believe it<br />
will be to do this and to examine our policies searchingly so that in the<br />
next election we can win overall as convincingly as you have allowed me<br />
to win in this division. This we pledge ourselves to do; to examine all<br />
our policies searchingly for that purpose.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
