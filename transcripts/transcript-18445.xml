The Government tabled the first annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Mr Bret Walker SC, into the operation of Australia's counter-terrorism and national security legislation in Parliament today.</p>
<p>The Government established the position of an independent Monitor in response to recommendations from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the independent Security Legislation Review Committee (the Sheller Committee) and the Clarke Inquiry into the case of Dr Mohamed Haneef.</p>
<p>The Monitor plays an important role in making sure our enforcement and intelligence agencies have the powers they need to prevent terrorist acts from occurring.  The Monitor also makes sure that these laws remain necessary, consistent with our international obligations and protect the rights of individuals.</p>
<p>The role of the Monitor underlines the Government's commitment to transparent oversight and regular review of Australia's counter-terrorism and national security legislation.</p>
<p>Although the report does not contain any recommendations, the Government will give careful consideration to the issues raised in this report.  There will be no formal response.</p>
<p>The report outlines the Monitor's extensive agenda for the  next year and we look forward to considering any recommendations from this work in due course.</p>
