<p>E &amp; O E  -  PROOF ONLY</p>
<p>I am here to sign the London Declaration on Combating Anti- Semitism.  And this is why:</p>
<p>A synagogue vandalised in Brussels.</p>
<p>An explosive device detonated at a Jewish community building in Sweden.</p>
<p>A rabbi attacked in Berlin.</p>
<p>Jewish graves desecrated in Prague.</p>
<p>Four Jews shot and killed at a Jewish school in France.</p>
<p>And even in my home city of Melbourne, graffiti was sprayed painted in a shopping centre saying: “The best Jew is a dead Jew”.</p>
<p>All these events  -  and hundreds more like them  -  occurred in just one year: 2012.</p>
<p>Friends, anti-Semitism did not end with the conclusion of the Second World War and the fall of Nazism.</p>
<p>It did not end with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p>It did not end with the foundation of the State of Israel.</p>
<p>It pollutes our world right now.</p>
<p>In the face of Anti-Semitism, there can be no bystanders.</p>
<p>As citizens, as leaders and as nations, we must act.</p>
<p>History and justice demand it.</p>
<p>Do not ask who else should act.</p>
<p>It is us.</p>
<p>Do not ask when we should act.</p>
<p>It is now.</p>
<p>That is why since 2009, leading parliamentarians from around the world have signed the London Declaration on Combating Anti-Semitism. </p>
<p>I am honoured today to be the first Australian parliamentarian to sign this historic document.</p>
<p>I am pleased to sign it in the presence of so many leaders of our Jewish community.</p>
<p>So many of whose families came to this land seeking shelter after the event that cries out to us decades after its horror.</p>
<p>The Holocaust did not begin during the dark days of war.</p>
<p>It began decades and centuries earlier  -  with the hatred, the blood libels, the pogroms and expulsions and, perhaps most significantly, the casual insults and violence that became part of everyday life and society.</p>
<p>The Holocaust began with words.</p>
<p>It culminated in the gas chambers.</p>
<p>It ended with the defeat of Nazi Germany and the liberation of the camps.</p>
<p>That is why through the London Declaration, we say with clear and loud voices.</p>
<p>Never again.</p>
<p>But friends, seven decades on from the war, combatting anti-Semitism is not just a matter of ensuring that we do not forget.</p>
<p>It is about comprehending its full and insidious horrors in the first instance.</p>
<p>And then keeping that knowledge alive.</p>
<p>That's why education is so crucial.</p>
<p>The content of the history we teach in our schools.</p>
<p>The tenor of our public discourse.</p>
<p>The laws by which we regulate our civil interactions.</p>
<p>The tenacity with which, as nations, we stand for what is right.</p>
<p>Friends, I am proud to lead a nation which has done so much to fight discrimination in its laws and in its practices.</p>
<p>Our Parliament debated and passed motions condemning anti-Semitism almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>Our anti-discrimination laws are robust.</p>
<p>Our courts have found that Holocaust denial and vilification of the Jewish people are illegal.</p>
<p>We co-sponsored the UN General Assembly Resolution 60/7, and the creation of the International Day of Commemoration in Memory of Victims of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>And we sponsor regular interfaith dialogue within our own region.</p>
<p>So our record is a good one.</p>
<p>But this Declaration reminds us that combatting anti-Semitism is an active process, not a passive one.</p>
<p>It demands vigilance.</p>
<p>It means remaining alert to new vehicles by which hatred and social poison can be spread, especially through the use of emerging media platforms.</p>
<p>It means exerting ourselves so that future generations understand the importance of civic values like respect and tolerance.</p>
<p>The London Declaration is, above all, a warning and a witness to those who hold offices of public trust.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, another generation of leaders failed the test.</p>
<p>We face the same test  -  and we must not fail it.</p>
<p>Every generation is tested  -  and they must not fail either.</p>
<p>So this statement is a solemn reminder of our responsibilities, and the role Parliaments can play.</p>
<p>A means of reminding ourselves that we too are writing history  -  in our own hands.</p>
<p>I am therefore very proud to be the first Member of the Parliament of Australia to sign the London Declaration.</p>
<p>I do so with great deliberation and profound personal commitment. </p>
<p>And I trust that before long, the names of every Australian parliamentarian will appear alongside my own.</p>
