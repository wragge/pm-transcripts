STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DEATH OF SIR ROBERT REX OF NIUE<br />
I have today sent the following message of condolence t t he Acting Premier of Niue, the<br />
Hon Young Vivian, following the death on II December of Sir Robert Rex, Premier of<br />
Niuc since self govcrnment in 1974:<br />
I was saddened to learn of the death on 11 December of Sir Robert Rex. Please<br />
pass on my sincere personal condolences, and those of the Australian Government<br />
and pcople, to Lady Rex and her family and to the Government and people of Niuc<br />
on this unhappy occasion.<br />
With Sir Robert's passing, not only has Niue lost one of its founding fathers but the<br />
South Pacific region as a whole has lost one of its elder statesmen and most<br />
eminent leaders. He was an active participant in the South Pacific Forum from its<br />
inception in 1971.<br />
I was privileged to meet Sir Robert during his official visit to Australia in January<br />
this year and again at the South Pacific Forum in July in Honiara. Sir Robert's<br />
father was an Australian and I was particularly struck by his undoubted pride in his<br />
Australian connection. I was also very impressed by his wisc and constructive<br />
perspective on regional affairs. Australia has lost a special friend.<br />
Australia will be represented at Sir Robert's funeral on 14 December by the High<br />
Commissioner to New Zealand, Mr Rob Laurie.<br />
