<p>Subjects: Max Moore Wilton</p>
<p>E&amp;OE…………………………………………………………………………………………...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So what prompted Mr Moore Wilton';s decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he';s taking up a position in the private sector.  I';ve known for some time he could well do, he indicated that a little while ago.  I';m very sorry that he';s going.  He';s been a fantastic Departmental Secretary, he';s served Australia and the Government very well.  At a public service level he';s overseen some major reforms, he';s been part of a public service team, he has advised the Government in relation to the economy, national security, social policy changes and in every way he';s been a quite outstanding adviser to me. I wish him well, I know that he';ll tackle his new position with his normal energy and commitment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And the area that he';s had greatest influence?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think generally in making certain that whilst maintaining the best traditions of the public service, the public service is responsive to the wishes and the goals of the elected government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And are you saying which company he';s going to?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not that';s a matter for him, that';s a matter for him. I mean he';s a free agent and that';s a matter for him to talk about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>… a long serving…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he has been somebody who';s worked in the public service for some years, then he went into the private sector and when I became Prime Minister I recruited him back to the public service and he';s given six and a half years of great loyalty and service to me and I thank Max very warmly for the advice he';s given me, the contribution he';s made to the Government and the service he';s rendered to Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any idea on a replacement?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
