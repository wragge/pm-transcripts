    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Â 9 October 1983</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Government will spend $3 million on road works inÂ the Cairns area this financial year.Â </p>
<p>The work will include substantial improvements along more thanÂ 100 kilometres of the Bruce Highway south of Cairns.Â </p>
<p>Specific projects include:</p>
<ul><li>reconstruction of the Bruce Highway from LiverpoolÂ Creek to Moresby ($2 million)</li>
<li>construction of an access road to the new CairnsÂ airport terminal ($ 400,000)</li>
<li>reconstruction of McCoombe Street and Aumuller StreetÂ ($ 300,000)</li>
<li>reconstruction and widening of Lake Street ($ 13,000)</li>
<li>reconstruction and widening of Grove Street ($ 13,000)</li>
</ul><p>The Federal Government has allocated a record amount of $ 272.4Â million for Queensland roads this financial year, which willÂ create about 3,000 jobs in the State.</p>
<p>Work on national roads will provide 140 jobs in Cairns alone.</p>
<p>This will in turn lead to increased spending in local communitiesÂ and will be a factor in improving business activity.</p>
<p>The record expenditure is an increase of 51.3 per cent andÂ includes a 60 per cent increase in allocations for local roads.</p>
<p>Federal funds will include an allocation of $ 65 million for theÂ Bruce Highway this financial year.</p>
<p>This is a record amount.</p>
<p>Substantial work will continue on upgrading the Bruce Highway,Â including completion of the dual carriagewvy between BrisbaneÂ and Nambour.</p>
<p>The Federal Government sees roads as important in both economicÂ and social development terms.</p>
<p>Queensland, and especially North Queensland, has special needs.</p>
<p>It is an area where communications are vital.Â </p>
<p>The boost in road funding to Cairns and the region implementsÂ another of the Federal Labor Party's election commitments toÂ the people of North Queensland.</p>
<p>We. pointed toÂ the urgent need to upgrade North Queensland's roads,Â including local roads.</p>
<p>Now the Federal Government is providing the funds to do that.</p>
<p>Other North Queensland commitments being met include specialÂ assistance to the sugar industry of $ 10 million, $ 1 millionÂ to subsidise the diesel costs to Barrier Reef island resorts,Â abolition of the 20 per cent sales tax on tourist vessels andÂ a second ABC regional radio network.</p>
<p>Keith Wright has released a comprehensive and impressive setÂ of policies for North Queensland.</p>
<p>I have no doubt he will be scrupulous in implementing thoseÂ commitments. I look forward to working closely with Keith Wright as PremierÂ to ensure Far North Queensland fully realises the enormousÂ potential it has for growth and development.<br />Â </p>
