    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong> 9 October 1983</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Government will spend $3 million on road works in the Cairns area this financial year. </p>
<p>The work will include substantial improvements along more than 100 kilometres of the Bruce Highway south of Cairns. </p>
<p>Specific projects include:</p>
<ul><li>reconstruction of the Bruce Highway from Liverpool Creek to Moresby ($2 million)</li>
<li>construction of an access road to the new Cairns airport terminal ($ 400,000)</li>
<li>reconstruction of McCoombe Street and Aumuller Street ($ 300,000)</li>
<li>reconstruction and widening of Lake Street ($ 13,000)</li>
<li>reconstruction and widening of Grove Street ($ 13,000)</li>
</ul><p>The Federal Government has allocated a record amount of $ 272.4 million for Queensland roads this financial year, which will create about 3,000 jobs in the State.</p>
<p>Work on national roads will provide 140 jobs in Cairns alone.</p>
<p>This will in turn lead to increased spending in local communities and will be a factor in improving business activity.</p>
<p>The record expenditure is an increase of 51.3 per cent and includes a 60 per cent increase in allocations for local roads.</p>
<p>Federal funds will include an allocation of $ 65 million for the Bruce Highway this financial year.</p>
<p>This is a record amount.</p>
<p>Substantial work will continue on upgrading the Bruce Highway, including completion of the dual carriagewvy between Brisbane and Nambour.</p>
<p>The Federal Government sees roads as important in both economic and social development terms.</p>
<p>Queensland, and especially North Queensland, has special needs.</p>
<p>It is an area where communications are vital. </p>
<p>The boost in road funding to Cairns and the region implements another of the Federal Labor Party's election commitments to the people of North Queensland.</p>
<p>We. pointed to the urgent need to upgrade North Queensland's roads, including local roads.</p>
<p>Now the Federal Government is providing the funds to do that.</p>
<p>Other North Queensland commitments being met include special assistance to the sugar industry of $ 10 million, $ 1 million to subsidise the diesel costs to Barrier Reef island resorts, abolition of the 20 per cent sales tax on tourist vessels and a second ABC regional radio network.</p>
<p>Keith Wright has released a comprehensive and impressive set of policies for North Queensland.</p>
<p>I have no doubt he will be scrupulous in implementing those commitments. I look forward to working closely with Keith Wright as Premier to ensure Far North Queensland fully realises the enormous potential it has for growth and development.<br /> </p>
