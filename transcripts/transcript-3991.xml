OPEMWG STATEMENT BY TME HON. J. M. FRASJt<br />
INDUSTRIAL RMIATIONS<br />
The decision of the ACTU yesterday Cive months a-Itor the release<br />
of the detailed Liberii National Country Parties policy . on<br />
Indutriat ftelations is a belated attemnpt to bolater Labor's<br />
diminishing suppart amongst ordirvary trade unioni-t84<br />
0I4-his double-hatted role as ACTU and ALP President, Mr Hawke<br />
is* rnaorting to this kind of tactic in an attempt to revive the<br />
niyt. of Labor's claim to a special relationfhip with the union<br />
MOVext. The record of Labor in goverruimet shows this to b* nothing more<br />
than a myth.<br />
-In iq72., under the Liberal' National Country Parties industrial<br />
dispuiite accounted for two million man days 1Qst and $ 32 idllioft<br />
in 1tost. wagC.<br />
In 1974, af tc. r two years. of Labor it-governmeifit-7x and a quarter<br />
milion man days werc lost and wages loat totalled ' 218 million.<br />
That io, man days lost under Labor trebled and wages lost' we: nt<br />
up four times.<br />
In 23 years of Liberal National Country Party Govenmcnt, the<br />
monthl1y Average of Working days lost was 94.000. In two and a<br />
half yeAr3 cf Labor gvcrnmonh-that monthly avirage was 3G7,000<br />
days. That it, four times our fiiure:. L </p>
<p>I , r In government the Labor Party caved in to militant pressure in the<br />
case of export bans relating to beef and wheat.<br />
It has stood by on occasions when thuggery of the worst type<br />
has occurred in industrial relations. The judgement given in<br />
the Builders Laborers Federation deregistration case and the<br />
Sweeney Report into payments' to maritime unions cite examples'<br />
of this nature.-A2<br />
0 i<br />
In the current election campaign, the Labor Party is acting on th<br />
' presumption that it is entitled to the unquestioning financial and<br />
political support of trade unionists.<br />
This is despite the fact that Labor's economic incompetence has<br />
created unemployment on a greater scale than at any time since<br />
the depression of the ' thirties'. Information available to me<br />
indicates that unemployment may go as high as 335,000 ( actual)<br />
in June,-1976<br />
But Labor wants to ignore these facts and go on exerting open<br />
pressure on unionists by enforced stoppages to enable attendances<br />
at political rallies, by pressure to subscribe a days pay to the<br />
ALP through unions, and by pressure to distribute political<br />
literature and exhibit stickers and slogans.<br />
I believe a great number of ordinary members of trade unions<br />
in Australia resent this attempt at ruthless political exploitation.<br />
I believe that these tactics will generate a groundswell of<br />
resentment amongst union members who have no wish to be politically<br />
regimented by militant and unrepresentative union officials.<br />
-2-<br />
The only real relationship that. exists between Labor and the<br />
industrial movement is one of a. Labor government submitting to<br />
the demands of militant unions, or of a Labor government failing<br />
to act in the face of evidence of union extremism.. I<br />
