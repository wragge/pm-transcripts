' I3 Press Statement No. 186<br />
18 February 1974<br />
NATURAL DISASTERS ORGANISATION<br />
Members of the Cabinet spent much of today reviewing the capacity<br />
of the nation to meet major natural disasters when it hits us in any form<br />
Cabinet decided to create a Natural Disasters Organisation which<br />
will absorb the existing Civil Defence 0rganisation and put new emphasis<br />
on the threat of floods, bushfires and other disasters. I have been<br />
authorised by Cabinet to cormaunicate with all the Premiers immediately<br />
suggesting the earliest possible meeting of Ministers to consider our<br />
proposals in detail. My telegrams have already been despatched.<br />
Emergency measures for flood relief taken by the Australian<br />
Government and others will continue uninterrupted. Submissions made to<br />
Cabinet for the proposed n. w Natural Disasters Organisation came forward<br />
under two headings.<br />
One involved the organisation to , be assoiated with our defence<br />
1 forces and the other is concerned with the mitigation'of financial<br />
losses. On the latter, Cabinet agreed to hear the views df the<br />
coriercial insurance companies and to commence inquiries into the<br />
possibility of wider insurance cover than'is at present available.<br />
The Minister for Defence, Mr. Barnard and the Treasurer, Mr. Crean<br />
will make such detailed statements as are appropriate.<br />
Apart from the flood damage suffered by the farmers, there is<br />
evidence enough that ill-planned and over-crowded cities are exposing<br />
people to great dangers. in times of disaster. It can be anticipated<br />
that this Government will look very warily at any future projects that<br />
might expose people or the environment to peril.<br />
A detailed account of Queensland's recent terrible experiences<br />
prepared by my Department, was made available to all Ministers. It<br />
stated among other things that it is still not possible to estimate<br />
the cost of the floods in terms either of human hardship or material<br />
losses.<br />
