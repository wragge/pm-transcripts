    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Is there any doubt that the Baghdad bomb was directed towards Australians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've just spoken in the last few minutes to Neil Mules, who is the head of our Representative Office, effectively our Ambassador.  The good news, the important thing, is that all our men and woman are safe.  They continue to be protected by the Australian Defence Force, and can I make the immediate point - how on earth are you meant to have a diplomatic representation in Iraq at the present time without troops protecting your men and women on the ground?  And this idea that you can have it both ways, you can pull the troops out and still have people there to protect Australia's interests, including our commercial interests, is laughable and absurd.  There is obviously a concern that it was directed.  You never know.  It was close.  It was between the hotel and the office.  You will never know.  But obviously it drives home the point Greg that this is very dangerous and that it's likely that there will be increased attempts in the weeks ahead, in the lead up to the transfer of power, there will be increased attempts to kill and injure and maim in order to stop a transition to a peaceful, democratic Iraq.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Australians in particular?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not Australians in particular.  Everybody in general.  Anybody associated with Iraq's future is a target, is an enemy of the terrorists and the insurgents.  They do not want a democratic Iraq.  And I said last week and I repeat it here tonight, that what is at stake in Iraq over the next couple of months is whether it can hopefully move forward to being a democratic country, or whether it is going to lapse into anarchy and much greater bloodshed.  And that is what is at stake and that is why Australia must finish the job and should not cut and run, and that is why the policy the Government is pursuing is right.  It may not be popular, but as I said in the House today, we did not go into Iraq on the basis of an opinion poll.  We went into Iraq on the basis of what we believed was right, and we are going to maintain our presence and do the job that we went there to do because we believe that is right.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What did Mr Mules and what will the ADF do about protection?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they'll continue to do the fantastic job that they have done to date.  A fantastic job.  And I'm very pleased to say that he told me they had just had lunch and they were in good spirits, and in the typical Australian style, they were getting on with the job.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is there any need to upgrade security for the mission, in particular (inaudible) more troops?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven't had any advice to that effect.  If there were a need, I would no doubt receive that advice.  But I repeat - they have done a magnificent job, but they need protection.  And this ludicrous, insane idea that you can simultaneously pull people out and also maintain a presence, and bear in mind that you're looking after the longer term interests of Australia in this very significant country, including our very legitimate and significant commercial interests in wheat and elsewhere, and people who run around saying that we should be in effect pulling the troops out after the 30th of June are just ignoring that fundamental fact.  Thank you.</p>
