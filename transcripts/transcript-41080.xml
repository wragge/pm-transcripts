    <content><![CDATA[<p>Major Joint Counter Terrorism Team operations by the Australian Federal Police, ASIO and NSW Police are occurring in Sydney.</p>
<p>These operations are designed to disrupt and prevent plans to undertake terrorist attacks in Australia.</p>
<p>I have been kept closely briefed on the progress of the operations by the heads of our relevant security agencies.</p>
<p>However, as the operations are ongoing, it is inappropriate to provide further detail at this stage.</p>
<p>My number one priority, and that of my Government, is the safety and security of all Australians.</p>
<p>The public should be reassured that our security and intelligence agencies are working tirelessly to keep us safe.</p>
<p>In the meantime remain alert, follow the advice given by police and if you do see or hear something suspicious call the National Security Hotline on 1800 123 400.</p>
