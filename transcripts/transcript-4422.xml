PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 14 JUNE 1977<br />
AUSTRALIA TO INCREASE FOOD AID<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, said in London today ( 12 June)<br />
that at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting this week he<br />
would announce a substantial increase in Australia's food aid<br />
programme and a liberalisation in the terms of Australian project aid.<br />
On the question of food aid, Mr. Fraser said he would tell the<br />
Commonwealth leaders that Australia will:' increase its total aid<br />
in foodgrains from the present minimum level of 225,000 tonnes of<br />
wheat to 400,000 tonnes per annum; increase the level of foodgrain<br />
aid channeled through the world food programme to 20% of Australia's<br />
total foodgrain aid; make an annual contribution of wheat to the<br />
interim reserve for emergencies; establish a bilateral foodgrain<br />
reserve for emergencies; give non-grain foods regularly as part of<br />
its aid.<br />
Taking account of these new initiatives, Australia's additional<br />
expenditure on food aid during the first year of operation of the<br />
new programme, 1977/ 78, will be of the order of $ 6.5 million.<br />
However, the programme will pro-,' ide for dramatic increases in<br />
succeeding years it is expected that it will increase more than<br />
fourfold by 1979/ 80.<br />
Mr. Fraser commented that the Development Assistance Committee of<br />
the OECD has recommended that countries should endeavour to raise<br />
their development assistance to 0.7% of their gross national product.<br />
Australia agrees with this target and he will be assuring the<br />
conference that the Australian Government would maintain this<br />
commitment. On the other hand, he understood the problems recipient countries<br />
had with tied aid. To overcome these problems, he would announce to<br />
the Heads of Government that Australia proposed in future: to untie<br />
aid for bilateral assistance projects where this would substantially<br />
assist local suppliers in the recipient country; to meet a significant<br />
proportion of local costs for least developed country recipients; to<br />
undertake a study of the further untying of procurement for bilateral<br />
aid projects. </p>
