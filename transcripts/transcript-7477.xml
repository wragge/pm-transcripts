TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, OLYMPIC STADIUM, SEOUL<br />
1 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E P ROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What does it feel like being in the Olympic<br />
Stadium? PM: It's a great thrill particularly . with the reproduction<br />
up there of the Australian team's involvement and the<br />
highlights they have just shown of Duncan Armstrong's<br />
great swim. I can understand the sense of pride of the<br />
Koreans too in their achievement here of creating these<br />
facilities. Truly, it's truly marvellous.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your message for Melbourne out of<br />
this? What have you learnt?<br />
PM:--I have learnt that Korea has set a standard of excellence<br />
which is going to be hard to match and so if we get thegames,<br />
and I hope we do, then they must come and learn<br />
from Korea. It's a great credit to them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have the Koreans given you any hints about<br />
how Melbourne can get the bid successfully?<br />
PM: Well I have had a bit of a discussion with President<br />
Roh about this and I think that they will be helpful.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can Melbourne afford these resources and<br />
facilities Prime Minister?<br />
PM: It is not just a question of Melbourne<br />
JOURNALIST: Can Australia?<br />
PM: Yes of course we can because they're not just something<br />
for the moment, as it were, of the Olympics. They are<br />
something that will provide a lasting facility as we<br />
learnt from 1956.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you say that the Koreans might help<br />
Australia, in what way are you talking about? </p>
<p>PM: The President has indicated that they have learnt<br />
a lot in the process of actually getting the games and<br />
then of going about the task of building the facilities.<br />
He was very positive about his attitude to us. He<br />
acknowledged the sentimental favouritism, if you like,<br />
of Greece which we understand but it doesn't mean<br />
that that will be the outcome. I think we can look forward<br />
to a great deal of assistance from Korea.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are there any specific plans already or<br />
are they still some way off?<br />
PM: No, nothing specific we talked about, but I certainly<br />
got the impression that a very considerable amount of<br />
help would be forthcoming from that quarter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were there any hints for lobbying the<br />
International Olympic Committee?<br />
PM: Now if I talked about that they wouldn't remain<br />
useful would they.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, since yesterday's press conference<br />
have you had any discussions with the ACTU leadership<br />
on the issue of the CPI?<br />
PM: No. not since then. As I said, I had my briefing<br />
with the ministers before I left and they know what my<br />
thinking is on this and I am sure that they will be handling<br />
it correctly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, three of the main banks<br />
have said this morning that housing interest rates will<br />
be up by the end of this week. Is that a disappointment<br />
to you?<br />
PM: Well, we'll see. Yes it would be if it goes up<br />
much higher. But I said what I think about the stance<br />
of monetary policy and the Treasurer and I have the same<br />
view about that. But, as I said, what happens in the<br />
market is in a sense for the market. But we are not<br />
in a position at this stage of tightening monetary policy<br />
ourselves. JOURNALIST: So you wouldn't expect the Reserve Bank<br />
to validate market increases next week?<br />
PM: No, that is not in my anticipation at this stage.<br />
I have left Australia now and as I have said, I had the<br />
meeting with the ministers and I have confidence in them<br />
that in all areas of relevant policy they will be making<br />
the right decisions.<br />
ends I </p>
