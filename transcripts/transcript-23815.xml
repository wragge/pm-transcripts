    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit New York on 24 and 25 September to participate in a high-level meeting of the United Nations Security Council convened by US President Obama to address the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters.</p>
<p>Combating the threat posed by foreign fighters – including some 60 Australians – who have joined ISIL and other terrorist groups to fight in Iraq and Syria is one of the government’s highest national security priorities.</p>
<p>I will discuss with President Obama and other leaders the urgent need for strong international cooperation to combat ISIL and similar extremist groups.</p>
<p>It is important for Australia and for the world that ISIL is defeated.</p>
<p>ISIL represents not only a humanitarian threat to the people of Iraq and Syria but a very real threat to the safety of the Australian community.</p>
<p>I fully support President Obama’s call for action and Australia will work with our international partners to combat this evil menace.</p>
<p>While in New York I will also deliver Australia’s national statement at the United Nations General Assembly and meet with key leaders ahead of the G20 meeting in Brisbane in November 2014.</p>
<p>11 September 2014</p>
