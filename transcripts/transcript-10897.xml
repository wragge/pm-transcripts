    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much to John Olsen, the Premier of South Australia,</p>
<p> to your wife, Julie, to Martin Cameron, the President of the South</p>
<p> Australian Division, to my many Federal and State parliamentary colleagues,</p>
<p> ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I am delighted to be amongst you on the first day of a bit of a trip</p>
<p> around Australia, talking about, explaining and answering questions</p>
<p> about the plan that was unveiled yesterday. I thank you most warmly,</p>
<p> John for your words of support. I am very proud of many things in</p>
<p> the tax plan, and one of the things of which I am particularly proud</p>
<p> is that we have after decades of rhetoric on the subject, we have</p>
<p> at last done something which will be of lasting and enduring value</p>
<p> in improving the balance of Commonwealth / State financial relations.</p>
<p> It's been around for years. It's dogged both sides of politics.</p>
<p> It has produced some of the less edifying political exchanges that</p>
<p> the Australian people have had to put up with over the years, and</p>
<p> at long last we've devised a plan and an approach that will give</p>
<p> to all of the States of Australia a tax that gives them the capacity</p>
<p> because of the growth in the economy to finance the things for which</p>
<p> they constitutionally responsible.</p>
<p>I think there is a degree of historic symbolism in the fact that in</p>
<p> the one week we have announced that there will be a seventh state</p>
<p> for a new century and that we have delivered a tax plan that, in so</p>
<p> many ways, will help to revitalise the Australian Federation.</p>
<p>I would like, ladies and gentlemen, for this tax plan not to be seen</p>
<p> in isolation. I don't want it to be seen as some kind of aberration</p>
<p> or abstraction, but rather I want it to be seen as the next logical,</p>
<p> albeit, very significant step that has to be taken in order to strengthen</p>
<p> the Australian economy. Some people say to me, things are difficult</p>
<p> in Asia, the world's a bit unsettled economically, Japan is going</p>
<p> through difficulty, other countries are going through difficulty,</p>
<p> this isn't the time to be embracing fundamental reform. Can I</p>
<p> say to those people, that they couldn't be more wrong. It is</p>
<p> because of what is happening in the Asian-Pacific region, that it</p>
<p> is all the more necessary that we go the next step, we travel the</p>
<p> additional distance that is needed to strengthen the Australian economy.</p>
<p> Over the last two-and-a-half years, we have done a number of quite</p>
<p> major things to strengthen and protect the Australian economy. We</p>
<p> inherited budget deficit of $10.5 billion, we put it into surplus</p>
<p> one year ahead of time. We are now very much back in the black. We</p>
<p> are now able to say that in the period of two years we have turned</p>
<p> that into a surplus. We have delivered the lowest interest rates that</p>
<p> Australia has had for thirty years. We have generated 300,000 new</p>
<p> jobs in just over two years. We have the lowest inflation rate in</p>
<p> the OECD area, we have a very high level of business investment. And</p>
<p> there are many other economic achievements of which I could speak.</p>
<p>But I mention those things very briefly because they provide the context</p>
<p> for what we have done in relation to taxation. Taxation is part of</p>
<p> that economic continuum. It's not something that is unrelated</p>
<p> to what we have done in other areas. It's all part of a steady</p>
<p> measured plan to strengthen and make modern the Australian economy,</p>
<p> to equip the Australian economy for the 21st century.</p>
<p>Now, I would be the last person in Australia to in any way under-sell</p>
<p> or under-describe the scale of the taxation plan that was unveiled</p>
<p> yesterday. It is, without argument, the most comprehensive reform</p>
<p> proposed to the Australian taxation system since World War II. It</p>
<p> is built upon a belief that we need a modern taxation system for the</p>
<p> 21st century. It is not just a goods and services tax,</p>
<p> although that's an element. It's not just a revamping of</p>
<p> the Commonwealth / State financial relations, although that is an</p>
<p> element. It does not just involved major reductions in personal income</p>
<p> tax, that is also an element. But when you put it all together it</p>
<p> represents as a plan the investing in the Australian community of</p>
<p> an enormous amount of additional incentive to not only work harder</p>
<p> but to save and to invest.</p>
<p>Let me quote just one example of what I mean by that. You read a lot</p>
<p> in the newspapers of a thing called bracket creep. Now bracket creep</p>
<p> is where you earn a bit more but because of inflation you get sucked</p>
<p> into a higher tax bracket. But one of the particular features of this</p>
<p> tax package, is that between the income of $20,000 a year and the</p>
<p> income of $50,000 a year, and let me remind this audience that 80</p>
<p> per cent of wage and salary earners in Australia are at or below $50,000</p>
<p> a year, so when you talk about $50,000 a year, you are talking about</p>
<p> the overwhelming bulk of our fellow Australians. I think it's</p>
<p> important to keep these proportionalities in mind.</p>
<p>Now under this plan, you will be able to pass from $20,000 a year</p>
<p> to $50,000 a year and that would be the experience of the great bulk</p>
<p> of Australians during their working lives, and you won't go into</p>
<p> a higher tax bracket. Because what we have done is to introduce what</p>
<p> is effectively a marginal rate of 30 cents in the dollar for everybody</p>
<p> earning up to $50,000. Now that may not mean much to some people,</p>
<p> but can I say in terms of incentive it means an enormous amount to</p>
<p> the great bulk of our fellow Australians. How often do you hear the</p>
<p> complaint from some of your employees that it's not worth doing</p>
<p> some extra overtime because the tax man takes half of it. But what</p>
<p> you can now say to him or her that the tax man will only tax 30 cents</p>
<p> at most if the top income is over $50,000.</p>
<p>Now, I dragged that out of the myriad detail of the package to drive</p>
<p> home the point that this is very much a taxation reform for middle</p>
<p> Australia. We have devised tax scales for families for middle Australia</p>
<p> and for the Australian battlers. And I am quite unashamed about that.</p>
<p> Because they are the people who need help. They are the people who</p>
<p> deserve reassurance and they are the people who can be easily frightened</p>
<p> by a dishonest fear campaign about the operation of the goods and</p>
<p> services tax.</p>
<p>I know that in an audience such as this, I probably don't need</p>
<p> to extol the fundamental virtues for business of a goods and services</p>
<p> tax. But let me nonetheless remind you of some of the benefits of</p>
<p> it that are perhaps over looked because they're taken for granted.</p>
<p> I mean every single business operator in Australia because of the</p>
<p> way in which a GST operates will find that the cost of fuel will fall</p>
<p> by 7 cents a litre, because the way we've structured the fuel</p>
<p> taxes is that you'll reduce the excise on fuel by the necessary</p>
<p> amount to allow in the 10 per cent GST so that there is no increase</p>
<p> in the pump price for any person who purchases fuel. And because the</p>
<p> GST is fully rebatable on your business inputs, the net effect of</p>
<p> that, of course is, that you end up that your fuel, and this has got</p>
<p> nothing to do with your fuel concessions which I will come to in a</p>
<p> moment, but because of the way in which the system works, you end</p>
<p> up with a 7 cent reduction a litre in a the cost of all the fuel that</p>
<p> is used.</p>
<p>We have calculated that the introduction of the new system will reduce</p>
<p> the operating costs of Australian business by about $10,000 million</p>
<p> a year because of your capacity to recover tax payed on business inputs.</p>
<p> We've also calculated that it is going to reduce the cost of</p>
<p> exports by in the order of $4.5 billion a year. Now at a time when</p>
<p> Australia must more than ever trade successfully abroad, I can't</p>
<p> think of a more beneficial generic gift to the Australian economy</p>
<p> than a $4.5 billion reduction in the costs of burdening exporters.</p>
<p>We calculated the overall cost reduction for Australian business will</p>
<p> be in the order of 3.5 per cent. We believe that there are very significant</p>
<p> cash flow benefits, particularly for small and medium sized firm.</p>
<p> Any firm with a turnover of less than $20 million a year will be only</p>
<p> required to remit on a three monthly basis. And that will represent</p>
<p> on average that the amount of the GST collected by those firms will</p>
<p> be held on an interest free basis for a period on average of 66 days.</p>
<p> Now that does represent, particularly when compared with the existing</p>
<p> arrangements in relation to wholesales sales tax, which have frequently</p>
<p> been criticised, that represents a very significant improvement so</p>
<p> far as the cash flow situation is concerned.</p>
<p>There will, of course, be a one off price impact of the introduction</p>
<p> of the goods and services tax. Some prices will go up, some will go</p>
<p> down. A South Australian audience will know that one of the important</p>
<p> prices for Australians that will go down, will be the price of the</p>
<p> family motor car. And that is certainly going to fall very significantly.</p>
<p> And there will be transitional measures introduced so that the abrupt</p>
<p> drop in the price of things like cars will not occur so that there</p>
<p> will be an adverse effect, expectation wise, in the operations of</p>
<p> that industry. And I think the transitional arrangements that we're</p>
<p> going to propose in that area will be of very, very considerable benefit.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those once in a lifetime opportunities</p>
<p> that a Prime Minister or a government has to put down a plan that</p>
<p> has a long-term, visionary, positive impact for the benefit of the</p>
<p> country. And the greatest enthusiasm I have for this plan, the greatest</p>
<p> passion I have for it, the greatest commitment I have for it, is not</p>
<p> born out of a narrow political context, it is born out of a deep personal</p>
<p> belief that if this plan can win the support and the approval of the</p>
<p> Australian people, it will be of lasting benefit and it will deliver</p>
<p> lasting improvement to our entire nation.</p>
<p>And that is why I ask you to give it your very strong and your very</p>
<p> active support. Of course it is a mixture of economic vision, of economic</p>
<p> reform and economic improvement and political judgement. There has</p>
<p> never been a successful reform plan put to the Australian people or</p>
<p> any other country in the democratic world that isn't a mixture</p>
<p> of the two. Anybody who tries to sell pure economic theory is doomed</p>
<p> to rejection. And anybody who simply operates on the basis of political</p>
<p> advantage and political expediency deserves to be repudiated by the</p>
<p> public. And what you need is a sensible amalgam of the two.</p>
<p>And what I think, and I direct these remarks particularly to a Liberal</p>
<p> supporting audience, and what we now have on the Australian political</p>
<p> scene, we have a government, a Coalition Government, that has been</p>
<p> willing to tackle some of the fundamental areas that have needed change.</p>
<p> We've encountered some barriers along the way. We've encountered</p>
<p> opposition. We have been grievously hamstrung by the fact that we</p>
<p> don't control the Senate. We have had the Labor Party and the</p>
<p> Australian Democrats and others in the Senate throwing dirt in the</p>
<p> face of the Australian people in terms of rejecting for which they</p>
<p> voted at the last election. But despite that we have continued on</p>
<p> our reform path. And the greatest example of that reform path, is</p>
<p> of course the plan that was unveiled yesterday. And the response of</p>
<p> the Opposition has even been by the standards of automatic opposition</p>
<p> in Australian political history, particularly pathetic and particularly</p>
<p> negative. I thought Mr Beazley's response yesterday was even</p>
<p> uninspired in its negativism. To say that something was the most unfair</p>
<p> thing that has ever been dumped on the Australian public, when even</p>
<p> some of the Government's other strident critics have at least</p>
<p> been willing to acknowledge that there is some merit in it was a,</p>
<p> I think, a particularly pathetic demonstration of automatic knee-jerk</p>
<p> opposition from the Opposition.</p>
<p>He knows, Gareth Evans knows. The former Labor Prime Minister, Mr</p>
<p> Keating knew, Mr Hawke knew. Anybody who has had any acquaintance</p>
<p> with the way this country operates in Government knows that we can't</p>
<p> go on forever with the existing taxation system. And sooner or later</p>
<p> we have got to change it. And how better than to try and change it</p>
<p> than from government. How better to do it than to lay the plan out</p>
<p> before the election, to involve people in it, to involve the States,</p>
<p> to bring them into the process, to offer them part of the action and</p>
<p> part of the reform and part of the change and to involve the entire</p>
<p> Australian community in the process and government is, in the end,</p>
<p> about taking the right decisions for the future. It is not just about</p>
<p> staying in government, comforting and nice as that may be, and much</p>
<p> in all as we'd like it to occur, in the end you are elected to</p>
<p> take decisions that are good for the country's future and that's</p>
<p> what we've tried to do.</p>
<p> When we came into office we took some decisions in getting the</p>
<p> budget back into balance which some people didn't like. But I'm</p>
<p> glad, I really am glad we took all of those decisions, every last</p>
<p> one of them, because given what has happened in Asia I'd rather</p>
<p> be in the black a year ahead of time than lagging behind against what</p>
<p> is now occurring.is what we've tried to do.</p>
<p>When we came into office we took some decisions in getting the budget</p>
<p> back into balance which some people didn't like. But I'm</p>
<p> glad, I really am glad we took all of those decisions, every last</p>
<p> one of them, because given what has happened in Asia I'd rather</p>
<p> be in the black a year ahead of time than lagging behind against what</p>
<p> is now occurring. Yet, if we had listened to Mr Beazley, we'd</p>
<p> have read some of our press critics and listened to them and listened</p>
<p> to some others in the community, we would have soft pedalled on getting</p>
<p> the budget back into surplus. I think if we'd have done that</p>
<p> we'd have now been more vulnerable and more exposed to what has</p>
<p> happened in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>And that is why it's so important that we push ahead with this</p>
<p> taxation plan. You can't muck around if you're going to</p>
<p> have reform. People argued we should have left more things out. The</p>
<p> old dictum about taxation is that if you're going to change it,</p>
<p> the broader the base the lower the rate. If you start leaving food</p>
<p> out, then somebody will want clothing left out. If you leave that</p>
<p> out, you'll want something else left out and then it really isn't</p>
<p> worth doing at all. And the best way to deal with low income earners</p>
<p> in the Australian community is to give them adequate compensation</p>
<p> through the social security and the taxation system and that is what</p>
<p> we've done because one of the many outstanding elements of this</p>
<p> package is that we have embraced some quite fundamental reform of</p>
<p> the social security system. We have given low income earners more</p>
<p> incentive to work rather than to stay on benefits. We have altered</p>
<p> the taper rates, we've increased the levels at which welfare</p>
<p> benefits begin to phase out, because under the existing arrangements</p>
<p> there are some family groupings who find it hardly worthwhile being</p>
<p> in work because the level of social security benefits are so high</p>
<p> and those sorts of incentives to stay out of the workforce are bad</p>
<p> policy and they're bad for our society.</p>
<p>So it's a plan, ladies and gentlemen, which is not just about</p>
<p> taxation. It certainly not a plan which is just about a goods and</p>
<p> services tax. It fundamentally changes the way our taxation system</p>
<p> operates. It is of enormous ongoing benefit to the business community,</p>
<p> it will operate more efficiently and more fairly than the present</p>
<p> system, it does contain major personal tax cuts and they are quite</p>
<p> deliberately skewed in favour of those who have the responsibility</p>
<p> of raising children and I make no apology for that, in fact, it's</p>
<p> one of the proud features so far as I am concerned, of this policy.</p>
<p>It also brings back something that many Australians believe should</p>
<p> never have gone and that is for most Australians effective full tax</p>
<p> deductibility of private health insurance premiums. And that measure</p>
<p> is available free of income tests and anybody, irrespective of income,</p>
<p> will be able to claim either through their tax system or by way of</p>
<p> a direct payment from the government 30 per cent of their health insurance</p>
<p> premiums.</p>
<p>And the final thing that I'd particularly like to mention is,</p>
<p> of course, that this plan is of special benefit, not in an unreasonable</p>
<p> way, but quite importantly, given the significance of it to the national</p>
<p> economy, this plan is of particular benefit to the bush or country</p>
<p> Australia or rural Australia or whatever definition one might like</p>
<p> to use because the changes that we propose in the area of excise on</p>
<p> diesel, not only have we maintained and slightly extended the full</p>
<p> rebate in relation to off-road use of diesel, but we have also introduced</p>
<p> what is effectively a reduction of 25 cents a litre from 43 down to</p>
<p> 18 cents a litre in relation to heavy transport and rail use of diesel</p>
<p> and when you combine that with the fact that every business in Australia</p>
<p> will be able to buy all of their fuel effectively 7 cents a litre</p>
<p> cheaper, it all adds up to something like a $3.5 billion reduction</p>
<p> in fuel costs throughout Australia.</p>
<p>Now, not surprisingly, that's a very special benefit to rural</p>
<p> Australia and deservedly so, because the cost of transportation bears</p>
<p> very heavily on people who live in the non metropolitan areas of Australia</p>
<p> and I said last night, and I will repeat it here today, that I can't</p>
<p> wait for Monday to come when I can get to Queensland, and I can start</p>
<p> pointing out to the people of Queensland  which is not only</p>
<p> a large State but also the most decentralised State in Australia </p>
<p> that in relative terms it will probably gain more and the people of</p>
<p> Queensland will gain more from that diesel fuel change than any other</p>
<p> part of Australia.</p>
<p>And how on earth the new Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, can keep</p>
<p> a straight face in opposing the government's plan is completely</p>
<p> beyond me.</p>
<p>My friends, this has been a very important week in the life of the</p>
<p> government. It's been a week in which the government has kept</p>
<p> face with the commitment that I made on its behalf when it was elected</p>
<p> and that is that we would govern for all Australians. Only the blinkered</p>
<p> and the mean-minded and those of narrow understanding could possibly</p>
<p> argue that the tax package delivered yesterday was a package for the</p>
<p> rich or a package for the privileged.</p>
<p>It was a plan and a package for all Australians. First and foremost,</p>
<p> it's given to the country the prospect and the hope of a taxation</p>
<p> arrangement that will boost the economic growth of the country and</p>
<p> generate more jobs. It's offered the Australian people a tax</p>
<p> plan for the 21st century. It proposes to sweep away a</p>
<p> ramshackle, unfair, inefficient, lopsided indirect tax system and</p>
<p> replace it with a modern, comprehensive one.</p>
<p>It offers the biggest personal tax cuts in decades. It offers a radical</p>
<p> and beneficial overhaul of Commonwealth/State relations and will at</p>
<p> long last deliver to the States of the Australian federation an arrangement</p>
<p> to which they have long been entitled, but equally long denied.</p>
<p>And most importantly of all, it offers to the Australian people the</p>
<p> next necessary building block in further strengthening our economy</p>
<p> against the difficult years that lie ahead, particularly in our part</p>
<p> of the world.</p>
<p> It is a comprehensive plan. It's an integrated plan, it's</p>
<p> not one that can be subject to a process of put and take which undoubtedly</p>
<p> our opponents will endeavour to do. I don't underestimate the</p>
<p> challenge ahead of me and ahead of the government in explaining and</p>
<p> advocating and winning support for the plan. It's had a good</p>
<p> response  of course it has. It's early days and all of</p>
<p> us who believe in it and all of us who want tax reform for Australia,</p>
<p> let me say one thing to you. This is the best opportunity this country</p>
<p> has had for fundamental tax reform at any time since I have been in</p>
<p> politics, and that goes back to 1974.</p>
<p>I saw attempts in the last 1970's  I was part of them.</p>
<p> I was part of attempts in the early 1980's, I watched the former</p>
<p> Labor government try it in the mid 1980's, I was part of the</p>
<p> Opposition in 1993 that tried it then. Now all of those attempts have</p>
<p> failed. This attempt, I believe will succeed. It will succeed because</p>
<p> I think the economic and political balance in this plan is better</p>
<p> than any that have been offered in the past. It will succeed because</p>
<p> it is being offered from the vantage point of government. It will</p>
<p> succeed because I think there is a greater understanding in the Australian</p>
<p> community now that we do need tax reform and I think it will also</p>
<p> succeed because there is a sense in the Australian community if we</p>
<p> don't achieve it this time, it's going to allude us in the</p>
<p> lifetime of most people in this room.</p>
<p>But having said all of those things, it remains a very very big challenge.</p>
<p> And if you want it, if the business community of Australia wants it</p>
<p> and supports it, we need your help energetically to go out and advocate</p>
<p> the cause of taxation reform. Because it does matter to all of you,</p>
<p> you all benefit but most importantly, our country benefits and the</p>
<p> great single justification for this plan above all other plans is</p>
<p> that it will be good for the entire nation. I have always believed</p>
<p> that if you can persuade the Australian people of two things in relation</p>
<p> to a reform  the first is that it's good for Australia</p>
<p> and the second thing is that it's fair to them  then they</p>
<p> will embrace it and they will support it.</p>
<p>And I believe that this plan meets those two criteria and I believe</p>
<p> it will be good for Australia, it will be fair to all Australians</p>
<p> and I ask you to give it your very strong and active support. Thank</p>
<p> you.</p>
<p>A couple of questions. Any questions? Yes?</p>
<p>QUESTION 1:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He wants to know how I am going to make him pass on the price cuts,</p>
<p> is that right? Well, now that you've tempted me, I, well we have,</p>
<p> there are a number of ways in which that will occur. The first and</p>
<p> most obvious one is that when this new plan comes into operation,</p>
<p> there will be a very finely-tuned and heightened sense of individual</p>
<p> scrutiny on the part of every consumer in Australia. They will all</p>
<p> know, they will have their lists and if I know the media of Australia,</p>
<p> they will publish before and after prices. I think you will find the</p>
<p> Tiser' and the Telegraph' and</p>
<p> the Melbourne Sun' will have lists. One on the 30th</p>
<p> of June 2000, showing the prices of all the things you buy pre-GST</p>
<p> and the prices of what they ought to be afterwards and I think a lot</p>
<p> of Australians will carry those lists around, that's the first</p>
<p> comment I'd make. Second comment I make is that the natural forces</p>
<p> of competition will work to ensure it happens and I hear a lot of</p>
<p> men and women in business tell me these days that the competitive</p>
<p> pressures have never been as strong. I understand that. And thirdly,</p>
<p> we are going to invite the ACCC to adopt a surveillance role and to</p>
<p> invest it with some authority in relation to that to ensure that the</p>
<p> full measure of the changes that ought to occur, do in fact occur.</p>
<p> Now, there will be some in the community who will try and behave in</p>
<p> an unscrupulous fashion, they won't have any sympathy from us,</p>
<p> they won't h</p>
