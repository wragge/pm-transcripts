PR. IJE MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH JOURNALISTS AT BALLARAT 19 JULY 1978<br />
Question: Well, what-do you say about the projected f igures?<br />
Prime minister:. 1 haven't' seen any projection, Isve seen -the<br />
newspaper report-but let m'e make a couple of points, because<br />
this is a very serious matter. Emrployment in a number of<br />
industries is very, difficult and Its very -difficult. for a<br />
number ' of' factors. Slage. rates. in -a -two year period went up<br />
by.. over. 50% and that priced imany Australian industries out of<br />
business... N~ ow ' we've been arguing over the last* two years for<br />
wage restraint to try. and get. bao1V to proper relativitie between<br />
the -wageshare! and the prof it: share and over the last twelve months,<br />
for. example, and in spite of. the policies which we've argued<br />
before the. Arbitration Commiss; ion which have not buen-fully.<br />
aacepted by. the'Commission, the share of wages wage inacases,<br />
average earnings have-continued to riSc at a-greater rate than.<br />
the Consumer Price index and that doesn't seem to indicate a<br />
great deal. of restraint which is necessary if we are to<br />
get back, to the levels of employment that we would-like. The<br />
penalty rates in the tourist industry, which is something, which<br />
I'.. referred to at lunchtime,. is something that:. is ' driving<br />
tourists away: fromAustralia to places like Fiji. and Singapore<br />
and-that also, doesn't help A couple of clays ago a major<br />
building., operation in Mlbourne was shut. down., a $ 150 million<br />
project* as 1lundcrutand it., relating to the State Saving. 2s<br />
Ban)% and : it was shut downy as a . result of seven bans' or<br />
so placed upon the construction, guerilla tactict. by. the<br />
Builders Labourers. Federation and under thiese-circumstances<br />
how -can you expect major buildings to be undertaken. in the City..<br />
of: MelIbourne,. and -I ' would say it is a deliberate campaign -by<br />
the; leaders in that-particular industry to prevent buildingtAzing,<br />
place and a deliberate campaign therefore to prevent<br />
expanded employment 4oppoxtunities occuring. In. the demonstration<br />
today,, when.; I arrived in Ballarat, I understand that most. of<br />
those outside the Town Hall were not out of jobas, that-they have.<br />
got jbs, but. they've shut down-. the factory they were operating<br />
in -today so that* they could' demonstrate as though they were.<br />
unemployed. The particular firm for which they.-are working is<br />
losing orders because they,' ve got bans on the f irm and will.<br />
only..., work: 35 hours a week and because of that the firm' gJets.<br />
orders but it can't fill'them -in time and therefore % 4ork is los<br />
While-these. attitudes. Yemain in certain sections* of the union<br />
movement within Australia,. it's going to make -the.-Job-of getting<br />
back. to a level of employment that we all want to see very<br />
difficult. And I make -no bones about it continuation of these<br />
policics by. some-union leaders, by the guerilla tactics, the.<br />
sort-of demonstration that there was; today making, putting<br />
up costs. fo'r industry, unnecessarily, is almost one might think, </p>
<p>-an ef fort to f r'ustrate the of forts of the Government and<br />
the. many. thousands of people throughout Australia to establish<br />
more reasonable circumstances.<br />
Queation: Just on that point, sir,. do you support your-<br />
Ministers attack toclay-on Mr. H-amer and his stand over<br />
wage indexation?<br />
Prime Minister: Whatever M'r. Street saidl-and-whatever<br />
Mr. L-ynch said, about quarterly wage hearings, of course I<br />
support it, because that has been, Government pol icy. We have<br />
argued in the Arbitration Conidssion that change-s in wacje<br />
rate-s every, three months is v'ery unsettling to-business, they<br />
don't know what-decisions are going to be Laken. in relation<br />
to wages, tIherefore they can.' t counlt their costs; going further<br />
into. the future there is an unknown elemnent icnd if' there was<br />
greater stability, wage-rates being.. established every twelvc-<br />
Ynonths, for ex~ ample, that; again would greatly assist i31<br />
creating more employment. Let ne make another poipt in relation<br />
to thiat: when rinflation was running at 16 percent, in the<br />
times of our predecessors, I could understand how employees<br />
would feel left behind if wages were only -adjusted every.<br />
twelve months, but now that inflation is. seven or eight percent<br />
ana-falling, thnt sepnse of injusti ce should not be there if<br />
waget determinations were nuch -Icss frequent than. they now, are√±;<br />
that would assist investment and assist re-establishing<br />
unemploy * ment. at levels which I hope every Australian. wants to<br />
see. But. agaiin, when-1 ; ee the attitudes, the decisions<br />
and-actions of some industrial leaderst union. leader-,' I can<br />
only believe that they. don't want greater employment in<br />
their industry-and are deliberately. trying to subvert economic<br />
recovery in Australia. 0 0 0 </p>
