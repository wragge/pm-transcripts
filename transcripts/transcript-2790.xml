AUSTRALIAN RATIFICATION OF NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFEATION<br />
AND SEABED ARMS CONTROL TREATIES<br />
0The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr E. G. Whitlam, announced<br />
today that arrangements had been made for Australia to ratify two<br />
Treaties relating to the control of nuclear weapons the Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Seabed Arms Control Treaty.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that instruments of ratification were being<br />
deposited today by Australian representatives in the three depository<br />
capitals, London, Washington and Moscow.<br />
" This action fulfills a pledge I gave on behalf of the<br />
Government in my first week in office," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" It reflects the Government's strong and unequivocal support<br />
for efforts to check the spread of nuclear weapons, and for the<br />
principles of arms control contained in the two Treaties."<br />
Mr Whitlam said that to fulfill the principal requirement of<br />
ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Australia was<br />
already negotiating with the International Atomic Energy Agency for<br />
a Safeguards Agreement, which would provide practical arrangements to<br />
prevent the non-peaceful use of nuclear material. </p>
