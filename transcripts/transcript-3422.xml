PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 348<br />
18 October 1974<br />
RELEASE OF TARIFF BOARD REPORT -PHOTOGRAPHIC AND CINEMATOGPAPHIC<br />
APPARATUS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today released the<br />
Tariff Board's report on Photographic and Cinematographic<br />
Apparatus. The report covers a wide range of apparatus including<br />
process~ cameras and enlargers and reducers suitable for use as<br />
cameras but not including other cameras, cinematographic<br />
projectors or slide viewers.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that he had previously<br />
announced the Government's acceptance of the Board's report,<br />
but because changes in tariff rates had implications for<br />
international commitments the Government would not release<br />
its decision or the report pending the completion of necessary<br />
GATT negotiations with overseas countries. These negotiations<br />
have now been concluded.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that in accordance with a decision<br />
taken by the Government in September last year, where it accepted<br />
a recommendation of the Tariff Board in a report received prior<br />
to 19 July 1973, the duties approved for inclusion in the<br />
Customs Tariff would, subject to international commitments,<br />
be those recommended by the Board less 25 per cent. Consequently<br />
a rate of 15 per cent will apply to the majority of goods of<br />
types made in Australia. Currently the process cameras, the<br />
enlargers and the reducers are free of duty while many other goods<br />
are subject to protective duties.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that details of the customs tariff<br />
changes arising from the Government's decision will be announced<br />
when administrative arrangements to implement them have been<br />
finalised.<br />
