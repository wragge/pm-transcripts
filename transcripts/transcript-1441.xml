    <content><![CDATA[<p>The domestic programme we have put before you is the subject of this broadcast.</p>
<p>This programme has veen designed not only to help the individual citizen, but also as an investment for the future.</p>
<p>The contrast between what we have undertaken to do and what the Labor Party recklessly promises has been under the spotlight during this campaign. The Labor Party thinks only in terms of spending. it wants to buy your votes with your money jecause you as a taxpayer would have to foot the bill for the Labor Party's irresponsible promises.</p>
<p>Our own domestic policies continue year in year out and are tied to what we can reasonably afford as a nation. But we have put new proposals to  you on this occasion.</p>
<p>First, we looked at the individual and his needs. That is why we have proposed further assistance to education. We believe  - as you do  - that education is important to every Australian and to the nation.</p>
<p>We have looked constructively at social services and propose a further liberalisation of the means test. This is consistent with our settled policy of enlarging our Social Services programme as circumstances permit. We've not waited for another election to do these things.</p>
<p>We propose to do more this time to help young couples eager to buy their own homes oecause we are proud of the fact that nearly half the homes in Australia today have been constructed since we came to office in 1949.</p>
<p>But our domestic programme, as well as giving direct help is also an investment for the future. 4e propose to spend money in an investment which will return to Australia and Australians richer dividends in rising incomes and higher standards of living.</p>
<p>This we will do through spending on development.Much of our domestic programme is directed to national development which, for us, means people as well as physical resources.</p>
<p>I give you an example. We've undertaken to draw up a programme of water conservation related to national needs. This would not only reduce the hazards of drought; it would expand primary production and this will mean higher farm incomes, more export; more money all round.</p>
<p>We will also discuss with State Governments a million dollar programme extending over a period of seven years expanding what we have been doing on beef roads. his may seem remote to an Australian city-dweller out beef is a solid export earner, and the more we sell abroad the better off are all of us, whether we live in town or country.</p>
<p>As well as basing our domestic programme on both individual and national needs, we believe our home policies must be looked at in conjunction with our foreign policies. You can't plan with any confidence for sustained growth at home without also lookirog to national defence and security. We see our progress inside Australia tied to our security outside Australia. That is the only sensible and responsible way of looking at policy as a wihole. And that is where we and the Labor Party are so far apart in our outlook our beliefs and our basic policies. Reduced to one sentence your choice on polling day is between responsibility and irresponsibility for the nation.</p>
<p>( This talk will be broadcast by the A. B. C. National Network at 7.15 p. m. Tuesday, 22nd November, 1966).</p>
