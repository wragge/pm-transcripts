    <content><![CDATA[<p>The domestic programme we have put before you isÂ the subject of this broadcast.</p>
<p>This programme has veen designed not only to helpÂ the individual citizen, but also as an investment for theÂ future.</p>
<p>The contrast between what we have undertaken toÂ do and what the Labor Party recklessly promises has beenÂ under the spotlight during this campaign. The Labor PartyÂ thinks only in terms of spending. it wants to buy yourÂ votes with your money jecause you as a taxpayer would haveÂ to foot the bill for the Labor Party's irresponsibleÂ promises.</p>
<p>Our own domestic policies continue year in year outÂ and are tied to what we can reasonably afford as a nation.Â But we have put new proposals to Â you on this occasion.</p>
<p>First, we looked at the individual and his needs.Â That is why we have proposed further assistance toÂ education. We believe Â - as you do Â - that education isÂ important to every Australian and to the nation.</p>
<p>We have looked constructively at social servicesÂ and propose a further liberalisation of the means test.Â This is consistent with our settled policy of enlargingÂ our Social Services programme as circumstances permit.Â We've not waited for another election to do these things.</p>
<p>We propose to do more this time to help young couplesÂ eager to buy their own homes oecause we are proud of theÂ fact that nearly half the homes in Australia today have beenÂ constructed since we came to office in 1949.</p>
<p>But our domestic programme, as well as giving directÂ help is also an investment for the future. 4e propose toÂ spend money in an investment which will return to AustraliaÂ and Australians richer dividends in rising incomes andÂ higher standards of living.</p>
<p>This we will do through spending on development.Much of our domestic programme is directed to nationalÂ development which, for us, means people as well as physicalÂ resources.</p>
<p>I give you an example. We've undertaken to draw upÂ a programme of water conservation related to nationalÂ needs. This would not only reduce the hazards of drought;Â it would expand primary production and this will meanÂ higher farm incomes, more export; more money all round.</p>
<p>We will also discuss with State Governments aÂ million dollar programme extending over a period of sevenÂ years expanding what we have been doing on beef roads.Â his may seem remote to an Australian city-dweller outÂ beef is a solid export earner, and the more we sell abroadÂ the better off are all of us, whether we live in town orÂ country.</p>
<p>As well as basing our domestic programme on bothÂ individual and national needs, we believe our home policiesÂ must be looked at in conjunction with our foreign policies.Â You can't plan with any confidence for sustained growth atÂ home without also lookirog to national defence and security.Â We see our progress inside Australia tied to our securityÂ outside Australia. That is the only sensible and responsibleÂ way of looking at policy as a wihole. And that isÂ where we and the Labor Party are so far apart in ourÂ outlook our beliefs and our basic policies. Reduced toÂ one sentence your choice on polling day is betweenÂ responsibility and irresponsibility for the nation.</p>
<p>( This talk will be broadcast by the A. B. C. NationalÂ Network at 7.15 p. m. Tuesday, 22nd November, 1966).</p>
