AUSTRALIAN AID TO INDONESIA<br />
Australia has made available a third instalment,<br />
$ l750,000, in its programme of D. K. ( Devisa Kredit) aid to<br />
Indonesia. This was announced today by the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, Mr E. G. Whitlam.<br />
Mr Whitlan said that the money would be used to provide<br />
Indonesian importers with foreign exchange to buy essential goods.<br />
Goods bought under the programme must be at least<br />
two-thirds Australian in content and have, in the past, included<br />
tin-plate, steel, aluminium and zinc products, machinery, chemicals<br />
0 and pharmaceuticals. The balance-of-payments support given to Indonesia by<br />
the D. K. aid programme since its inception in 1967 had contributed<br />
markedly to the stabilisation of the Indonesian economy.<br />
In addition, the importation of essential raw materials<br />
under the programme was promoting the expansion of Indonesia' s<br />
domestic production. Mr Whitlam said that Australia's D. K. instalments to Indonesia<br />
this financial year would total $ 5.5 million.<br />
Australia's total aid programme to Indonesia in 1972/ 73<br />
will be $ 23 million. </p>
