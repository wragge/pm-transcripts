PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, ORCHARD HOTEL, PERTH<br />
13 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: How much more difficult does the Democrats<br />
decision on preferences going to make your task in<br />
Western Australia, particularly in seats like Stirling<br />
and Cowan?<br />
PM: If it were to stick, it would obviously I think have<br />
some marginal impact but I doubt very much whether the<br />
Democrats can in all seriousness stick to this decision<br />
because it obviously means that the Democrats are asking<br />
people to accept that it makes sense for a Democrat vote<br />
to be a vote for an enlarged uranium mining industry, for<br />
a uranium enrichment industry, for mining in Kakadu Park,<br />
the abolition of the capital gains tax. Now if the<br />
Democrats of Western Australia are saying that's what<br />
they really believe in then their proposal could stick.<br />
But if they don't believe in those things, if they are<br />
against mining in Kakadu Park, if they are against the<br />
uranium enrichment industry, if the Democrats in Western<br />
Australia are against those things, then they can't<br />
expect people to give a Democrat a primary vote and then<br />
a preference to the Liberals and Nationals who are in<br />
favour of all those things.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, has the banking industry<br />
blown any hope of interest rates coming down two<br />
rises Spencer on the AN this morning say he doesn't<br />
believe there'll be any change.<br />
PM: The Commonwealth Bank is of course, in regard to<br />
fixed rate, it has no impact upon variable rate mortgages<br />
and~ is so acknowledged. All the statements of the<br />
banking industry remain in line with what I've been<br />
saying, that they expect conditions are such that<br />
mortgage rates will come down.<br />
JOURNALIST: That's not what they said this morning,<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Well<br />
JOURNALIST: for some months. </p>
<p>PM: Who said that<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Spencer said home loan, home loan<br />
interest rates will probably remain steady for some<br />
months, there are no immediate plans<br />
PM: This is the man from the Commonwealth Bank?<br />
JOURNALIST: That's correct.<br />
PM: Yes, but I'm saying, if you listen to my answer I'm<br />
saying that the banking industry generally is saying that<br />
they will come down. I just do not accept that what he<br />
said. Let's just go to the, what's being said by the<br />
bank industry more generally. I'll just read you a<br />
number of statements from the Age, Age of 20 February,<br />
the economist the conditions already exist or are<br />
falling for an easing of rates, Sydney Morning Herald, 6<br />
March, housing interest rates should fall to 16 percent<br />
by according to economic forecaster, BIS Shrapnel,<br />
12 March, the ABC's PM Program, within Australia almost<br />
everything points to lower Bankers Trust, I<br />
wouldn't be surprised if the current Government's reelected<br />
we see another drop in short term interest rates<br />
within a couple of weeks after the election, another<br />
percent or so. So there you've got it. These are what's<br />
being said by the market generally and simply because you<br />
have a decision here in regard to the fixed rate mortgage<br />
of the Commonwealth Bank and one statement of the<br />
Commonwealth Bank simply does not-negate what the banking<br />
industry generally has been saying. The banking industry<br />
has not changed its statement or have the economists<br />
generally changed their position, that as a result of the<br />
policies in place under this Government there is<br />
expectation that interest rates will fall. I believe they<br />
are correct.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, these comments certainly<br />
suggest a revision of those earlier quotes<br />
PM: They don't suggest anything of the sort, because<br />
that statement, just one person in the Commonwealth Bank<br />
has come out in relation to a position of a fixed<br />
interest, five year fixed mortgage and that is determined<br />
by what they in fact, the interest rates on those five<br />
year securities, particularly the the five year<br />
Government bond and the fact is that that decision<br />
doesn't in any way affect what will happen to their<br />
variable rate mortgages. There is no position from the<br />
banking industry as a whole, or economists generally<br />
which changes what they have been saying and nor should<br />
there be because the conditions are unchanged. The<br />
conditions are that the level of activity is easing and<br />
that the cost of money the banks is falling, the two<br />
conditions which will bring about a fall in interest<br />
rates. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Regardless of what it applies to Prime<br />
Minister, surely when the country's biggest bank takes<br />
that sort of action it does not send a positive message<br />
PM: On the contrary, do you understand the difference<br />
between a fixed five year rate and variable rates. I<br />
mean, if you don't then you're in difficulty.<br />
JOURNALIST: I certainly do. It hardly sends a positive<br />
message PM: On the contrary, you may be trying desperately from<br />
your position to send a different message to what the<br />
banking industry generally and economists generally are<br />
saying.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just a moment. Those statements that I have read<br />
out, which are based upon sensible propositions, have<br />
been unchanged by anyting that's occurred in the last 24<br />
hours. Those statements by banking industry generally<br />
and by economists are not plucked out of thin air because<br />
they decided they wanted to go on AM or be reported in<br />
the newspaper, wanted to see their name in print, they<br />
were based upon two propositions, the two propositions<br />
are unchanged or do you suggest that are? One, that the<br />
economy is slowing, two, that the cost of money to the<br />
bank is declining. Those two fundamental propositions<br />
are the two propositions upon which economists and the<br />
banking sector have said that rates will come down. They<br />
haven't changed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, Mr Spencer was not discussing fixed<br />
interest rates, he said indication rates might fall, was<br />
crystal ball gazing, I believe they will probably<br />
stay somewhat where they are<br />
PM: He said that and against that I have read out to you<br />
the statements, extensively, I mean, I will go on with<br />
them if you like but I don't think you want to be<br />
I've read out the statements from within the banking<br />
industry and economists as to what their expectation is<br />
and I repeat they haven't made those on the basis of<br />
deciding whether on day X they wanted to see their name<br />
iTrprint. They made the statements on the basis of two<br />
fundamental propositions which remain unchanged. I mean,<br />
to refute that position that has been put by economists<br />
and the banking sector you would have to point to two<br />
things haven't changed. You would have to point to<br />
evidence that the economy was not slowing down, do that<br />
if you can. Secondly, you would have to say that the<br />
price of money in regard to variable rate mortgages is<br />
going up you can't because that is not the case. The<br />
two fundamentals remain unchanged. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Well why did the Commonwealth put up what is<br />
essentially a long-term rate?<br />
PM: For a very simple reason. I mean, if you can't<br />
understand this you have a little bit of difficulty and<br />
no wonder then in those circumstances you can't<br />
understand it, you get a bit excited. The fact is that<br />
in regard to the fixed five year rate, basically financed<br />
by instruments, fixed term instruments, five year, and<br />
basically the Government five year bond rate. Now when<br />
we make decisions to reduce the par ratio, the private<br />
asset ratio, then there was not so much need for the<br />
institution they sold off it is a simple basic<br />
arithmetical economic fact. If there is an increase in<br />
selling of f of bonds the price falls, the yield rises.<br />
So the yield on the five year term bond rose and that was<br />
relevant to one thing, it was relevant to the cost they<br />
paid in the financing instrument for their fixed five<br />
year term. Now, lets<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you'll appreciate that a lot of<br />
people won't believe what any politician said on interest<br />
rates until home loan rates actually do fall?<br />
PM: Well I suppose you'll always get people out there<br />
who won't believe what politicians say. I mean, even<br />
whether it is interest rates or who is going to win the<br />
footy. There's a bit of scepticism about politicians..<br />
suggest, by the end of this campaign, there will be a bit<br />
of scepticism about political analysis too if they look<br />
back over what's been said.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr Keating earlier today said that<br />
in his judgement monetary policy would be being relaxed<br />
now if it wasn't for the convention of not making major<br />
decisions during a campaign period. Does that mean that<br />
if Labor's re-elected there'll be an immediate easing of<br />
monetary policy?<br />
PM: I would believe, and let me read so that you have<br />
the whole text as to what Mr Keating said. I'm not<br />
implying that you're going to but what he said which<br />
is relevant he got asked the question are you saying if<br />
it had not been for the election the conditions were<br />
there for immediate ease in monetary policy. He<br />
said, answer, that would be my judgement, but I would<br />
nee~ d to talk to my own advisers, including the Central<br />
Bank, and it's which is consistently in line with<br />
what the Treasurer and I have said in a period before the<br />
election. we would obviously discuss these matters<br />
with the Reserve Bank and its Board. It's judgement and<br />
the judgement I share with the, the Treasurer that the<br />
conditions are there, the conditions are there. I share<br />
Paul's judgement completely, but when we, when the<br />
election's over and we're back there in the decision<br />
making process, we'll obviously have a discussion with<br />
the bank and we would be putting the position obviously,<br />
as the Treasurer has. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you appear to have been<br />
careful with your language during the campaign<br />
PM: Always careful with my language<br />
JOURNALIST: Whenever you've been asked about interest<br />
rate falls you've said the banks say interest rates are<br />
coming down. Are you prepared to say that you guarantee<br />
that there will be interest rate falls after the election<br />
or are you still relying on banks<br />
PM: What I am saying is consistently in line now with<br />
what the Treasurer has put today the we believe and I put<br />
this quite clearly, the Treasurer and I believe that the<br />
conditions are there for a reduction in rates. I mean,<br />
we are not living in a vacuum, we are living in a real<br />
Australian world and that real Australian world is<br />
characterised by these facts that there has been two<br />
easing in the prime rates, that's happened, so the cost<br />
of money to the banks is decreasing. Secondly, we're<br />
living in a world where the evidence is increasing that<br />
the economy is slowing down, that is that the purpose for<br />
high interest rates has been effective. That is we have<br />
had interest rates high to get a slowing of the economy<br />
and the economy is slowing down so when you take these<br />
facts into account then what I am saying is that we<br />
believe that we have got the circumstances for a<br />
reduction in rates that you're talking about.<br />
JOURNALIST: So no guarantees though?<br />
PM: Well I agree completely with what the Treasurer said<br />
that we will discuss this matter with the Reserve Bank,<br />
but we..<br />
JOURNALIST: But you're saying the banks<br />
PM: No I am not saying that because I have made it quite<br />
clear and I'm sure Paul did as well that during the<br />
election campaign, Tony, it was a bit much to expect that<br />
they would bring them down during the election campaign<br />
in a sense that very different position<br />
transcript, something I said some time back, they were in<br />
a difficult position that if they brought them down they<br />
would be accused of trying to help the Government, if<br />
they didn't bring them down, they'd say you should have<br />
brought them down....... rather difficult position. So I<br />
indicated from the beginning of the campaign that I<br />
didn't expect that they would be coming down during the<br />
campaign. JOURNALIST: Are they helping the Opposition by<br />
PM: No, no, I certainly don't make that accusation. I<br />
repeat I think that they are in a rather difficult<br />
situation in an election campaign. I mean, damned if you<br />
do damned if you don't sort of thing. I am simply saying </p>
<p>that I believe that the circumstances are there once the<br />
election is over and we win, for them to come down. The<br />
opposite of course is true, in the hypothetical situation<br />
of a coalition....... but in those circumstances obviously<br />
the interest rates would be set to rise because you must,<br />
you don't need to be an economist to know this, you must<br />
have a situation of rising interest rates if you have a<br />
wages explosion and a blowing of budget surplus. And you<br />
must have a budget surplus blowing exercise because we<br />
still have the situation where the Opposition is trying<br />
to bribe the electorate with this six billion unfunded<br />
set of promises and that means from that source that you<br />
either float a surplus or have massive spending cuts<br />
which of course they will not detail. And on the other<br />
side of the budget outcome you have given back billions<br />
of dollars under their capital gains tax proposal. So<br />
inevitably what the markets can see in that hypothetical<br />
situation would be a position of rising interest rates<br />
but under us they will come down.<br />
0 JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how soon after the election would<br />
you envisage having these discussions with the Reserve<br />
Bank? PM: Well I think they would happen I would imagine<br />
that the Treasurer would be having them reasonably,<br />
reasonably soon after the election.<br />
JOURNALIST: So then we could assume that reasonably soon<br />
after the election-<br />
PM: Well you can't, you can't make any assumptions other<br />
than what I say, in the end, what I say and one's got to<br />
be very circumspect about this, I'd say no more than<br />
this, which I've already said and I'll repeat it again<br />
and it should be quite clear then, so it's fruitless to<br />
go any further. What I say is this that we had high<br />
interest rates to get a slowing of the economy because,<br />
at that level of activity, the economy could not sustain<br />
the level of imports that went with that level of<br />
activity. Next I say that all the evidence is that those<br />
high interest rates are working, that the economy is<br />
slowing down. Third, I say that you have had, as a<br />
result of discussions that we had with the monetary<br />
authorities earlier this year, a lowering of prime rates.<br />
And it follows from those things that I've said that, in<br />
the judgement of the Prime Minister and Treasurer, the<br />
circumstances exist for a lowering of rates. After the<br />
election we will have a discussion with the authorities<br />
on the basis that the Treasurer and I have that view.<br />
Nothing could be clearer than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: But people want some indication of when we<br />
can expect interest rates<br />
PM: People have got the clear indication from what I've<br />
said and that is </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: No they haven't..<br />
PM: On the contrary. The election, as I understand it<br />
and I don't think anyone can change it, is 24 March. The<br />
decision then is obviously one for the Treasurer and<br />
myself to have discussions, as I've said, we'll have them<br />
quite quickly, with the authorities and we will be<br />
putting to the authorities what I've just said that<br />
it's the view of the Government that the conditions are<br />
there for a reduction of rates. Now you really are, are<br />
battling say that you can't understand timetables on<br />
that and the thrust of the Government's intention.<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm not saying I can't understand<br />
PM: Well<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm saying people want..<br />
PM: Well, all I'm saying to you is that if you<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: All I'm saying is if you faithfully transcribe and<br />
transmit to the public what I have unequivocally said,<br />
timetables shouldn't be difficult to understand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, regard to, if I can take you back<br />
to the Democrats decision, regardless of the wisdom or<br />
otherwise of that decision, what effect do you see that<br />
having on the, on your prospects here in Western<br />
Australia and on the overall outcome?<br />
PM: We, I believe, are going to win the election and<br />
I'll say that as I've always said during this election,<br />
not with complacency or cockyness. I've always had that<br />
view, as people who've been travelling with me or been in<br />
Canberra before we started, people know that I've based<br />
that view on a very simple proposition, that I have faith<br />
in the intelligence of the Australian electorate, the<br />
majority of the Australian electorate will understand the<br />
very important distinction in prospects for Australia<br />
that flow from voting for us or voting the Opposition.<br />
I've always been steadfast in my thinking on that and in<br />
regard to Western Australia, and I've been over here<br />
before, I have said consistently and I repeat again on<br />
thris visit, that I don't think that West Australians are<br />
mugs. The proposition that West Australia was going to<br />
be a different land on the electoral landscape is a<br />
proposition which never convinced me because it meant a<br />
very simple thing. It meant, implicitly, people saying<br />
that West Australians-were mugs, that because they were<br />
upset about some aspects of earlier West Australian State<br />
Labor Government activity, that they were going to kick<br />
themselves in the backside by voting against Federal<br />
Labor. They were going to vote for the abolition of<br />
Medicare, they were going to vote for the abolition of<br />
the capital gains tax and the loss of billions of dollars </p>
<p>from the public revenue to be shovelled into the pockets<br />
of the wealthy few, that people in West Australia were<br />
going to do that to themselves to punish for the previous<br />
actions of Western Australian State Labor Government.<br />
Now I've never believed that when it got to the ballot<br />
box on 24 March, that West Australians would do that.<br />
Never. And I've said that consistently and I've got no<br />
reason to believe now. Now you've got to ask well,<br />
with the Democrats, the Democrats have said at this stage<br />
that they are going to suggest that preferences go<br />
against sitting Members. I mean, intellectually, a<br />
brilliant concept, isn't it? I mean, intellectually<br />
brilliant concept our idea of how you cast your<br />
preferences is vote and give your effective vote against<br />
sitting Members. If it's Labor against them, if it's<br />
Liberal against them. I mean, the, the intellectual<br />
basis of it is staggering. But more importantly than<br />
that I believe that the Democrats will erode their vote.<br />
The Democrats in the eastern States, the Federal<br />
Democrats are appalled by the decision. They're appalled<br />
by it for the obvious reason, that it makes nonsense of<br />
all the propositions that the Democrats have put about<br />
what they believe in. That they have this fundamental<br />
belief against uranium mining, they have a fundamental<br />
belief against mining in Kakadu, very fundamental here in<br />
Western Australia because they were cast votes in favour<br />
of those things. So I believe that in fact people who<br />
may have been going to vote Democrat, that is if the<br />
Democrats adhere to this position, just think very<br />
seriously about any wisdom in adhering to that advice.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what will be the effect on your<br />
credibility of the report of Senator Richardson's office<br />
fudging answers to the<br />
PM: Now, I was hoping that someone would come to that,<br />
hoping someone would come to that. Now, the, the fact is<br />
that the answer was yes to an increase in fundings for<br />
urban public transport. Should have been a qualified<br />
yes, I concede that, but the answer, quite clear. This<br />
was the answer the Hawke Government has provided<br />
million per annum for urban public transport. Over the<br />
next few years the Hawke Government expects to increase<br />
the attention given to urban public transport needs.<br />
We've delivered on that already because in the, in the<br />
policy statement you know that what I've done is to<br />
commit $ 85 million extra funding for urban public<br />
transport over the next three years, so we've delivered<br />
on that. If you think that there's going to be any move<br />
to the Liberals as a result of that little story, it<br />
means that you think that people are going to say, yes it<br />
is the case that Labor answered yes to 65 of the ACF<br />
questions and the Libs answered yes to only 32 and that<br />
this little story is going to change those fundmental<br />
statistical facts and that somehow people interested in<br />
the environment are going to vote, either directly or<br />
indirectly, for the conservative parties who opposed the<br />
saving of the Franklin, opposed our decision to stop </p>
<p>mining in Kakadu, opposed our decision to stop logging in<br />
the Daintree and opposed our decision to save the tall<br />
forests of Tasmania, I mean, it's a joke.<br />
JOURNALIST: So the impressions of fudging answers<br />
doesn't have any negative impact?<br />
PM: Well, I've said it would have been more appropriate<br />
to have a qualified, yes, I think that would have been<br />
more appropriate. But the fact is that we have delivered<br />
in terms of the indication of doing more for urban public<br />
transport. $ 85 million and, as I say, fully funded.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just come back to the<br />
interest rates for a moment... are you saying that the<br />
statement by the Commonwealth Bank this morning doesn't<br />
throw a spanner in the works even psychologically of the<br />
expectation that interest rates are going to come down?<br />
PM: I'm saying it doesn't because, in fact, that was<br />
made in the context of a decision by the Commonwealth<br />
Bank in regard to fixed rate mortgages five year fixed<br />
rate mortgage and that is financed by a particular<br />
instrument and the yield on that instrument has gone up.<br />
There is nothing being changed by anything in the past 24<br />
hours which affects the fundamentals of why interest<br />
rates should go down. That is firstly, that high<br />
interest rates have had their effect and the economy is<br />
slowing down and, secondly, that the cost of money to the<br />
banks has declined. Those are the two fundamental facts<br />
unchanged by anything that's happened in the last 24<br />
hours and those are the two fundamental facts which<br />
underlie the basis of the judgement by economists, the<br />
banking industry and the Treasurer and the Prime Minister<br />
that rates will come down.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what is the Government's forecast<br />
for inflation<br />
PM: I beg your pardon.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the Government's forecast for<br />
inflation over the next three years?<br />
PM: Over the next three years? Well, our inflation<br />
forecast for the next year is public, it's six percent<br />
and our judgement is that it will come down after that.<br />
We haven't put out an estimate for the period after that,<br />
but obviously I should put why I think it will go down<br />
further. My answer is this that under the wage tax<br />
agreement that's been negotiated with the ACTU, the<br />
pipeline outcome as you appreciate, Steve, at the end of<br />
this next period will be lower than the one to which<br />
we're going. So it's a legitimate expectation for that<br />
reason that the inflationary rate should come down and I<br />
also think that we're going to have the situation..<br />
that period of increasing competitiveness in our industry<br />
but what Paul and I have been trying to make clear is </p>
<p>that we're going through this restructuring period and<br />
one of the features, one of the facts of the growth in<br />
debt has been this enormous increase in investment in our<br />
industry. Now what we've got are the fundamentals of the<br />
Australian economy changing. We've got more people in<br />
employment with each passing year they're becoming<br />
significantly better trained and educated, you've got<br />
restructuring going on under the award system. Now it's<br />
very difficult to overstate the impact of the sorts of<br />
things that you and I are talking about of, of those<br />
changes in restructuring. I means that your workforce is<br />
going to be more efficiently employed and the training of<br />
your workforce is going to be much easier because you're<br />
not going to have it stultified by an award structure<br />
based upon the concepts of 50 years ago. The award<br />
structure is going to reflect the realities of modern<br />
day processes. So you're going to have better<br />
trained workforce, better structured workforce, working<br />
with better equipment. And these things, together with,<br />
as I say, with wages outcome, all those things together I<br />
believe will lead to a decline, decline in the rate of<br />
inflation. JOURNALIST: The reason I ask the question is because Mr<br />
Paul Keating on the weekend said that the Government<br />
would deliver real wage increases for the next three<br />
years. Given that we don't have inflation forecasts out<br />
that far..<br />
PM: Funny thing that he should be saying that?<br />
Obviously what Paul stated was based upon a set of<br />
assumptions the same as I'm making that the<br />
fundamentals that we've got in place, including the wage<br />
fixing arrangements which will lead to pipeline in<br />
that next period, plus the as I say, these<br />
fundamentals that I'm talking about should lead to that<br />
result. Of course, as far as the welfare of Australian<br />
workers, wage and salary earners with dependents are<br />
concerned, there are the two things that we talk about<br />
standards. I mean, there are standards, present<br />
standards, which are reflected by what happens to wages<br />
and taxes and prices<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke,<br />
PM: Just let me finish those present values, but<br />
very importantly what is emerging now in the campaign as<br />
an increasingly important issue is their future welfare.<br />
Because now we have the situation where Mr Peacock has at<br />
last, made it absolutely clear what was to some extent<br />
had not been before as to the future welfare.<br />
Wage and salary earners in this country have just got no<br />
choice as to what they do. Because Mr Peacock has said,<br />
explicitly, his words, we're not in favour of award<br />
superannuation. They're remarkable unequivocal<br />
statement by the Leader of the Opposition who wants to<br />
become Prime Minister we are not in favour of award<br />
superannuation. So as Paul has indicated, now what that </p>
<p>simply means for an employee aged 35 years who expects to<br />
be working for the whole of the normal working life, that<br />
is a straight statement from Mr Peacock to that person<br />
that he knock a quarter of a million dollars off him in<br />
superannuation. In other words, under Labor, there's<br />
another fifteen dollars a week going to be paid into<br />
superannuation under what we've agreed and Mr Peacock<br />
says no, that's out. So both in terms of present<br />
standards and, importantly in terms of the future, choice<br />
is stark because Mr Peacock is saying if you vote for us<br />
we will be knocking, in respect to that, reasonable sort<br />
of person a 35 year old, out $ 250,000 down the<br />
drain. JOURNALIST: EPAC apparently has got consumption tax on<br />
the agenda re-elected. Now does this reflect the<br />
you know, opinion in non-political circles that it's<br />
necessary and could this be, you know, part of your<br />
thinking, if not<br />
S PM: This is a beauty. I mean, it's a good one to finish<br />
on with the half an hour up. I mean, I've had some long<br />
bows, some long bows in this election, but this has got<br />
to be vying now for the blue ribbon prize for the longest<br />
bow in the election. That EPAC has mentioned the<br />
consumption tax, therefore it's on the hidden agenda of<br />
the Government. My friend, let me tell you this that<br />
when I set up EPAC I meant what I said about EPAC. That<br />
is that it would be a body in which the Government would<br />
have representatives from big business, small business,<br />
the States, local government, welfare organisations and<br />
that there would be discussed in EPAC a whole range of<br />
issues and that the Government would not seek to put any<br />
inhibition upon what was discussed in that body. That's<br />
why it has been a very useful institution over the life<br />
of this Government. Now, it's quite appropriate if the<br />
director of EPAC has gone on the agenda a mention of the<br />
consumption tax well and good. That's in line with the<br />
way EPAC is operated. But if you want to talk about<br />
consumption tax and the likelihood of how it might come<br />
in under either a Labor government or, we'll say this<br />
hypothetical question, of a conservative government,<br />
let's look at the facts. The President of my Party is<br />
not advocating the bringing in of a consumption tax but<br />
Mr Elliott who, if you look at his statement in May of<br />
last year, said that of course he discussed the question<br />
of economic policy of the Liberals with the then Shadow<br />
Treasurer, the Shadow Treasurer, Mr Peacock, he has<br />
been urging and urging and urging and he's not without<br />
influence, he says so you have Mr Howard, now one<br />
doesn't know how much influence he has with Mr Peacock<br />
because they don't trust one another, but he's in favour<br />
of a consumption tax. Dr Hewson's in favour of a<br />
consumption tax, he tried to get it into the Economic<br />
Action Plan. The Liberal Party is riddled with<br />
consumption tax advocates. Not my side. OK, last<br />
question. </p>

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, could I ask one more question on<br />
that EPAC paper?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: They also raised the issue of<br />
privatisation, could you can you tell us whether or<br />
not you'll consider at least some sort of selling off of<br />
Qantas and Australian Airlines?<br />
PM: I've got nothing to add to the answer I've given.<br />
Let me, if we're going to go through this historical<br />
exercise, well that's alright with me, it's the last one.<br />
The position is quite clear. What the people of<br />
Australia are faced with is on one hand the conservatives<br />
who have an ideological hatred of the public sector, an<br />
ideological hatred of the public sector, and I reject<br />
that. I have the view that there are things which must<br />
properly in this country be in the hands of the public<br />
sector. There will never be any flirtation under a Hawke<br />
Labor Government with privatising things like the<br />
Telecom, Australia Post, as there is such flirtation<br />
under the conservatives. Because the people of<br />
Australia, particularly the people of non-metropolitan<br />
Australia, would pay an extraordinarily heavy price if<br />
the conservatives were allowed to inflict their<br />
ideological obsessions upon the people of this country.<br />
In one area I said that it is appropriate that the<br />
questions of funding of the public sector should be<br />
looked at, and that is in regard to the airlines. Now I<br />
simply have said there that the process is being<br />
investigated by a committee of the Party. I'm in no<br />
great hurry about the reception of their report. I'll be<br />
interested to see what they've got to say when it comes<br />
but JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, you've got to get some idea of my priorities,<br />
and I'm not jumping up and down. I mean, I don't get on<br />
the phone every morning to the secretary and say when<br />
am I going to see that report. It just means what<br />
I've been saying this, in terms of the management of<br />
the Australian economy, is a peripheral issue. What will<br />
determine the future of this country is whether you've<br />
got, first of all, an effective wages policy. Secondly,<br />
whether you've got a government which is going to be<br />
prepared, with ongoing terms, to fund its outlays. And<br />
thirdly, whether you've got a government which is going<br />
to be prepared to undertake microeconomic reform and I<br />
recommend to you to look at what's reported in today's<br />
Press, by the meeting of the interest concerned with the<br />
Australian waterfront. All the talk that's been going on<br />
from the conservatives about how they would get in and<br />
take action to fix up the waterfront. The interests, the<br />
users, the shippers, they had their meeting there<br />
yesterday and they said quite clearly that the Federal<br />
Government was to be congratulated for what they were </p>
<p>doing in this area, that that was the only way to go<br />
about it and that the Opposition alternative was<br />
hopeless. Now it's these things that are going to<br />
determine it it's wages policy, it's the broad settings<br />
of macroeconomic policy, a commitment to proceed with<br />
microeconomic reform those are the are the questions<br />
that you raise possible privatisation enterprises is<br />
totally on the periphery of the future welfare of this<br />
country. ends<br />
