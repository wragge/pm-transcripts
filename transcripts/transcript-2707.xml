ANNUAL CONFEPENCE, LIBERAL PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE<br />
OF WOMEN'S SECTION<br />
ST. KILDA. VIC.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William. McMahon, CH, MP.<br />
October 1972<br />
Just as the strength of the family rests with<br />
women, so does the strength of the nation depend upon the quality<br />
of its women. And that leads me to say that I believe the same<br />
principles apply to national political parties like the Liberal<br />
Party of Australia. I don't think we could have succeeded as<br />
well over the last twenty-two years, nor could we have endured<br />
for so long and have such bright prospects as we now have, if<br />
it had not been for the Liberal women.<br />
Here, I am not talking exclusively about women<br />
mem! Ders of Parliament. I am talking about the women of the<br />
Party who comprise the backbone of our electoral and of our<br />
campaign organisations. So today, I want to pay tribute to you on behalf<br />
of the Liberal Party as a whole. But, now I am going to ask you<br />
to work even harder during the next five weeks, or six weeks, in<br />
order to ensure that we have a bigger majority in the House than<br />
we have at the present time. I know you will. And I know you<br />
are going to ensure your return on December 2 with a resounding<br />
victory, and I repeat again with an evcn greater majority than<br />
we have in the House now.<br />
Now this election campaign will, I believe, be<br />
decisive for all of us. It will in fact be a crucial decision.<br />
On December 2 Australians will be making their choice between<br />
a way of life that puts the individual, the family and the<br />
nation first, living in and working in and sharing in the<br />
Government of an Australia which has modern defences, strong<br />
alliances and good neighbours. That is the Liberal way; that<br />
is the Liberal choice. / 2 </p>
<p>We will be choosing between this and a radically<br />
different way of life, a radically different Australia,<br />
compulsorily squeezed and moulded by artificial controls to<br />
conform to Labor's foolish and repulsive socialist policies.<br />
It is, I believe, becoming clearer, as the tide<br />
of public opinion continues to turn in our favour, that<br />
Australians will emphatically reject the wrong-headed visions<br />
of our opponents. I want to emphasise this just as strongly<br />
as I can. Labor's blueprints for remaking of Australian life<br />
are alien to everything on which we have based the nationbuilding<br />
of our post-war generation of progress, growth and<br />
development. In every phase of national and personal life from<br />
external security to ' Private morality, they want to attack the<br />
way of life that the great majority of Australians have built<br />
and which we want to preserve. For these reasons, Australians<br />
are realising that this is an election not between similar<br />
Parties and similar policies, with nothing more than a minor<br />
shade of difference to tell them apart because the differences<br />
between us are sharp and they are real.<br />
So, it will be a major part of the Liberal Party<br />
campaign in the next few weeks to drive home these unbridgeable<br />
differences in public understanding. It is essential that all<br />
of us in the Liberal Party make certain that no Australian goes<br />
to the polls without a clear understanding of these differences.<br />
That is one vital aspect of our campaign. But the most important<br />
message that we should bring to the Australian people is this.<br />
It is the message that in the past eighteen months this<br />
Government has achieved more changes and reforms than any other<br />
Government in history in a comparable period. This pattern of<br />
change and reform matches, I believe, the new aspirations of the<br />
Australians of the 1970' s.<br />
But that is only a beginning. We have shown that<br />
we have a combination of youth and experience in Government which<br />
successfully tranerlates imaginative ideas into constructive and<br />
into responsible action. In the next few weeks Members and<br />
Ministers will be travelling the length and breadth of the nation<br />
and we will convince Australia that the return of this Gpvernment<br />
will be a mandate for continuous, constructive contemporary, and<br />
above all, responsible change. 1<br />
And so I want to put this to all Australians. Put<br />
back a Government that will guarantee your freedom of choice while<br />
it goes on changing and reforming and improving the quality of<br />
life in a dynamic Australia. Whilst we are proud of what we've<br />
done, we are not content. / 3 </p>
<p>Before I go on to examine some specific areas of<br />
policies and issue in this election lot me go bach~ a little over<br />
what we have done in a very short period of Government. I remind<br />
you immediately of the success of Premiers' Conferences and of<br />
the Loan Council. But I want to move now fairly quickly to what<br />
occurred three months ago whcn wco brought down the most<br />
humanitarian, wide-ranging and far-sighted Federal Budget in<br />
memory. We slashed personal taxation. They were the largest<br />
cuts in th~ e nation's history.<br />
We also demonstrated that this is a Government of<br />
roal social conccrn going wel~ l beyond any previous actions.<br />
The Means Test has been c" scd " a we ore pledgod t" its complete<br />
abolition within the next throe years. Pension rates in the last<br />
eighteen months brought an increase of 29 percent in the stanard<br />
rate of pension, never before equalled in so short a time from<br />
$ 15.50 per wcek to $ 20 per week or more than three times the<br />
changes in the cost of living at that time. All other pension<br />
levels went up to give thrm the largest buying power ever.<br />
The wives of all pensioners become entitled to receive benefits<br />
ranging up to an increase Df $ If.? 5 pcr week, and because we<br />
allowed superannuation ponsions and annuities to be treated as<br />
property, many thousands of people will receive further pensions<br />
for tho first time.<br />
Our nursing home and home care reforms will be a<br />
milestone in the care of the aged. For care in the home, there<br />
is now a home care allowance of $ 14.00 a wcek in addition to<br />
their social service benofits.<br />
The personal income tax cut has bcen cut an average<br />
of 10 percent following a 2h percent reduction we made in April.<br />
For the man on the average wage with a wife and four<br />
children, the amount of tax paid is down by a quarter and his<br />
take-home pay is increased by $ 3.10 a week. Dependants'<br />
. Allowances have been increased by $ 52 a year.<br />
We have exempted 600,000 taxpayers from tax completely<br />
by lifting the tax threshold from $ 417 a year to $ 1,041 a year.<br />
pstate duty exemptions have been doubled and the Home Savings<br />
Grant has gone up from $ 5C0 tc $ 750. </p>
<p>In education, 1-ye are allowing u-p to $ 40~ 0 as a deduction<br />
for self-education ex'-enses. Deductions for student children have<br />
gone up from $ 300 to 450, and secondary and tertiary scholarships<br />
have been increased dramatically from $ 53,000 to $ 123,000 a year.<br />
Living allowances have been raised and limits on scholarship<br />
holder's incomes abolished.<br />
We have begun assistance in child care with an initial<br />
million for centres for children in snecial needs and those<br />
from low income families.<br />
These, I assure you, are but nart, and only part, of our<br />
Budget measures, and this I can assure you, is only part of the<br />
story. Let us look at other major ' nolicy decisions. ! We have<br />
within recent weeks, in fact -within the last ten days, implemented<br />
controls on foreign takeovers, and if the advice tendered to me is<br />
correct, and I believe it i3, it will -over 90 ner cent of the<br />
cases. But equally important, I believe, that not only does the<br />
law itself provide a major deterrent, but it is also indicative of<br />
the fact that we will take whatever strona measures are needed in<br />
order to ensure that no foreign takeover takes placeif it is contrary<br />
to the national interest.<br />
We have acted to Protect the environment. We have<br />
established an ambitious new;, framework for urban growth. We have<br />
already established an inquiry into poverty.<br />
1bw these are just some of the things we've done, and they<br />
are the kind of actions which we have shown we can initiate and<br />
implement both capably and responsibly. We will do more, we will<br />
do much more, but no Government can build this nation without<br />
ensuring its basic security.<br />
Not so many years ago we. ir elied for our defence and<br />
security on the might of tie British-and American Navies, and to a<br />
lesser extent uoon thoir airforcoes. World War II and subsequent<br />
events, ' narticularly the dramatic changes that are occurring in<br />
Asia, have changed that basic concept. For centuries the Asian<br />
nations remained unchanged and unchangeable. Today this area of<br />
the world is one of the most changing and dynamic and we are<br />
participating in that change and those dynamic areas whcre the<br />
change is taking place.<br />
There can be doubt, howover that, China in its<br />
international policieCs, continually promotes the idea of<br />
insurgency in other countries, for example, in Thailand and<br />
Malaysia, which are both very important to our security and to<br />
our trade. </p>
<p>People might argue, that is all right, but we cannot<br />
see immediate prospects of danger of an attack upon our nation's<br />
frontier and on Australia itself. For them who argue this way,<br />
I want to give an unequivocal answer. Akny person who is prepared<br />
to take a risk with the security and defence of this country is<br />
acting in a way that is completely intolerable and will not be<br />
accepted by the vast majority of Australian people because the<br />
unexpected can happen.<br />
Let me 4ve you a few illustrations. You will<br />
remember the confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia a few<br />
years ago and the possibility that this could have spilt over into<br />
East Nlew Guinea. You will remember the insurgency in East Malaysia<br />
and in North Malaysia and in Thailand and of the activities of the<br />
Communists in Thailand and the military oerations between India<br />
and Pakistan and you know, too, of the growing presence of Russia<br />
in the Indian ocean. In these circumstances, we just could not<br />
take a risk and any person or party who Promoted the idea that<br />
the risks should be accepted is not worthy of representing the<br />
Australian people. Of course we would wish for policies of<br />
bipartisanship but this is not the nature of politics and cannot<br />
be for long periods anyhow.<br />
So you see there are great and fundamental differences<br />
between the Government and our opponents but let me summarise them<br />
to you. In our regional defences we are building good relations<br />
with Indonesia and the Five Power arrangements with Malaysia and<br />
Singapore were reaffirmed as in good shape during my visits to<br />
those three countries earlior this year.<br />
Labor, the alternative, would pull Australia out of<br />
the Five Power arrangements. We will remain as long as those<br />
nations want us to do so. We continue to support, and give full<br />
support for the ANZUS Treaty as a guarantee of our security, while<br />
continuing to build our self-reliance and our ability to help<br />
others within the region.<br />
Labor would downgrade ANZUS from a primary defonce<br />
treaty to a social welfare document and concept. It would, in<br />
fact, make ANZUS completely lacking in concept, lacking in vitality<br />
for purely defence pu rposes.<br />
Similarily they would write off SEATO as useless, even<br />
though it is a regional arrangement which links the powers in our<br />
part of the world, both to Britain and the Ujnited States and they<br />
would do this through the immediate abolition of National Service<br />
and they would straight away destroy the traditional strength of<br />
the army which military experts state is the basic minimum structure </p>
<p>necessary for the army to be able to field in any significant<br />
force. In fact they would reduce the size of the army from about<br />
41,000 to 26,000 and they would reduce the strength of our army<br />
from about nine to somewhere about five or six battalions.<br />
This would inevitably mean that our army would<br />
immediately drop out of the currency of diplomacy and of deterrence<br />
in the region. Career opportunities in the army would be<br />
irreparably damaged. our security would be undercut, and our<br />
ab~ ility to give our Asian friends our word and be able to back it<br />
up would be non-existent. If this is not the recipe for an<br />
isolationist, friendly, and ultimately defenceless, Australia, I<br />
cannot imagine what is.<br />
They see no problems emerging in the Indian Ocean,<br />
and they would deny ? imerica access to defence communications<br />
installations in Australia. These are all very great differences<br />
between us. I now turn to the important issue of immigration,<br />
because, here again, my Government and the Labor Party are poles<br />
apart. We believe that it is essential that the Government should<br />
control population policies. Through our Liberal Party<br />
immigration policy we exercise this control.<br />
Labor runs away from this responsibility. It wants<br />
the entire migration programme based upon sponsorship by relatives<br />
of migrants already living here.<br />
Now this assumes that the sum total of the individual<br />
wishes of relatives of migrants will always equal the sum -total<br />
of Australia's immigration needs. This is nonsense and many<br />
people in the Labor Party know it and they let their views become<br />
known. My Government combines two processes. A sponsorship<br />
process to encourage family reunions and a process of actively<br />
seeking migrants under Government sponsorshiD to fulfil those of<br />
the nation's needs not met by sponsorship. Labor's policy of<br />
non-control is doubly dangerous. It abandons the means of making<br />
adjustments to meet the nation's varied social and economic needs.<br />
Worse, it ensures that there will be an immediate and substantial<br />
cut-back in immigration followed by a rapidly accelerating change<br />
in the pattern of immigration.<br />
In the past five years, only half of all settlers in<br />
Australia were either Commonwealth or State nominees, only thirty<br />
eight rprcent were privately nominated settlers. To abandon<br />
Government nominated immigration as the A. L. P. would do would have the<br />
effect of reducing settlers by at least one half, despite the<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>weight of expert opinion that migrants put far more into the<br />
economy than they take out of it. We would also lose an essential<br />
supply of skilled workers and these, I believe, areD very important<br />
figures to present to you.<br />
In the past five years, Labor's policy would have<br />
denied Australia 73,700 of the 98,000 skilled workers who came<br />
here as assistant migrants. These skilled workors are essential<br />
for regional development, such as the develonment over in the<br />
North-West of Western Australia and the development as well in<br />
various parts of Queensland, including the alumina developments<br />
and the development of our bauxite deposits.<br />
The other major effects of Labor's snonsorship-only<br />
policy will be an inevitable change in the pattern or the<br />
composition of immigration programmes because of the sponsor ship<br />
rates of various nationalities. These show that the non-European<br />
migrants have by far the highest sponsorship patterns of the<br />
highest sponsorship rates. Under Labor there would be a<br />
pyramiding effect of immigration amongst those migrants with a<br />
traditionally higher sponsorship rate. This would mean the<br />
systematic elimination of immigration from Northern Europa, the<br />
United Kingdom and the 71mericas. Mr. Whitlam has done this with<br />
complete disregard for the national interest. He even admitted<br />
on television, as you probably know and saw, that this policy<br />
was to get him " cff -the hook" on the issue of discrimination.<br />
In summary, therefore, Labor would abandon the<br />
existing immigration policy which, while by no means exclusively<br />
European, is strongly oriented-I in that direction. Labor's policy<br />
would ensure that no selection was to be made on the ground of the<br />
country of origin. It would, in short, ignore the lessons learned<br />
in other countries and it wouldl significantly alter the ethnic<br />
structure of -Australia in the long tcrm.<br />
By contrast, we support the existing immigration<br />
scheme, with intake scale~ d to ensure maximum employment. Skilled<br />
workers, 30 per cent of which wlould be eliminated by Labor, have<br />
benefitted everybody by adding to the nation's nroductivity, and<br />
their substantial demand for goods and services has helped to<br />
sustain employment. This policy, based upon assisted European migration,<br />
has encouraged rapid assimilation and it has given us an integrated<br />
nation with minimal ethnic problems and controlled yet rapid<br />
population growth, with an increasing insurance:-on our defence<br />
potential. / 8 </p>
<p>The last issue I want to mention to you today is<br />
the question of freedom under the law and how it affects our<br />
society. Democracy and the guarantee of individual human rights<br />
to freedom and independence depend upon two concepts: They are<br />
the rule of law and the maintenance of public order and regular<br />
free Parliamentary elections.<br />
The rule of law means this, that everybody has equal<br />
freedom and equal rights under the law which are administered<br />
fairly, impartially and honestly. This means freedom for<br />
everybody, freedom without any sort of discrimination. Tp be<br />
effective, the rule of law requires discipline in the use of<br />
sanctions which in turn require legal enforcement. That is what<br />
the maintenance of public ordcr means.<br />
It is truly said that without law is without liberty.<br />
When we s * oeak of freedom we mean your freedom under the law. It is<br />
not a licence to do as you please without restraint or without<br />
respect to the rights of others. Particularly some young people<br />
think it fashionable or exciting to become involved with the<br />
so-called conscientious breaking of the law through civil<br />
disobedience. Such people are easily exr'loited and manipulated<br />
by a small hard-core group of militant activists because of their<br />
relatively innocent political idealism. This hard-core group<br />
makes no pretence whatsoever of respect for the law or concern<br />
for democracy although, as most of us know, they fully exploit<br />
democratic freedoms to preach their own propaganda.<br />
Our political opponents try to ridicule and degrade<br />
freedom under the law with a smokescreen of self-righteousness<br />
or attacks upon the police. The question must be asked: Why?<br />
Here in Victoria, the Labor Party has answered by<br />
its action in endorsing as a candidate for an unwinnable seat a<br />
young man who is on a run from the law. That endorsement must cast<br />
doubts on Labor's belief in our political system of democracy, or<br />
at least that section of the Labor Party which took part in, or<br />
applauded this candilate, because the endorsement of the young man<br />
did nothing less than throw the concer't of the rule of law of<br />
which I have been speaking into ridicule and contempt.. You would<br />
think that a democratic constitutional party would immediately<br />
disown this sort of action as political delinquency, something to<br />
be condemned. What happenedl? Mr. Whitlam was asked about it, and<br />
he retorded:---" Draft dodging is not a crime." As you know, or<br />
you should know, Mr. Whitlam is, or is alleged to be, a Queen's<br />
Counsel. / 19 </p>
<p>4 9.<br />
And what did Mr. Hawke do? He took part in the<br />
young man's campaircn. Mr. Whitlam, I can assure you, put his<br />
mouth to it, but Mr. Hawke went one better and out his foot in it.<br />
Now Mr. Whitlam and Mr. Hawke are engaged in a contest<br />
about who is going to be the front-runner in the Labor campaign.<br />
Whichever one it is, this provides a fair indication of their<br />
attitude to freedom under the law and the public order.<br />
We are, unfortunately, living in an increasingly violent<br />
society. This year alone, there were twenty-four bombing<br />
incidents in an Australia, previously relatively free from them.<br />
I ask you as Liberal women and those others, those other guests who<br />
come within Liberal women today to ask and to frequently to ask<br />
others this question: Which Party would you trust to preserve law<br />
and preserve the authority of the law from the contempt which<br />
eventually incident by incident will attack the foundation of our<br />
society a foundation, steadily built un by the Liberals over the<br />
years, steadily developed in a way that has given not only the<br />
maximum of security internationally, but which has helped us to<br />
develoo a world of our own where traditional values do matter, where<br />
welfare of our own people is of paramount importance and where we<br />
have created an impression overseas that is one of envy for what we<br />
as people have done.<br />
You, the women of the Liberal Party, who have played<br />
such a magnificent part in developing this as a realistic concept<br />
and making life better and better for every succeeding generation of<br />
Australians deserve, I believe, the wholehearted commendation of all<br />
Liberals and certainly deserve the respect of every Australian.<br />
For these reasons, I have much pleasure in being<br />
invited to come here, and I now officially declare this Conference<br />
open. </p>
