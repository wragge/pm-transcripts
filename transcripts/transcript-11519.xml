<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Family Court matter]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well sir, can I say that I feel very sorry for anybody who, I feel very</p>
<p> sorry for anybody who suffers a family breakdown. I understand that because</p>
<p> of the intense emotions that surround family breakdown that the operations</p>
<p> of the Family Law Court are of course very very controversial. You made</p>
<p> a remark towards the end of your statement that you were told I thought</p>
<p> you said by Judge Jordan that courts do what politicians tell them.</p>
<p>That's wrong. They don't. We have no control over the courts.</p>
<p> We have....I'm sorry, look, I mean you can interject, people can</p>
<p> interject and cat call as much as they like but when it comes to the adjudication</p>
<p> of legal issues in this country the Government does not control the courts.</p>
<p> The Government does not control the adjudication of the court. There are</p>
<p> many aspects of the present Family Law Act that I'm not particularly</p>
<p> happy with as an individual. The Family Law Act was first introduced</p>
<p> into Federal Parliament in 1975. And it was a free vote, it was a conscience</p>
<p> vote. It wasn't a party political issue. The original Family Law</p>
<p> Act was designed by Lionel Murphy and Gough Whitlam and it was introduced,</p>
<p> there was a free vote where Labor and Liberal and then Country Party people</p>
<p> voted on one side and other combinations Â Labor, Liberal and one</p>
<p> or two Country Party people voted on the other side.</p>
<p>I can understand the anger of people about decisions of the court because</p>
<p> divorce and family breakdown generates intense emotion. And the sad fact</p>
<p> is that it's difficult for some people to support one family on their</p>
<p> income now but when their marriage breaks down and they're obliged</p>
<p> to support more than one family it becomes even more distressing. I'm</p>
<p> afraid I don't have a simple answer to your problem. I don't</p>
<p> pretend to know all of the circumstances of it. I can't overturn</p>
<p> and I won't even attempt to a decision of the Family Court because</p>
<p> under the laws of this country the courts are entitled to make their own</p>
<p> adjudications. I can understand your sense of frustration and your personal</p>
<p> distress, and I'm very sorry about it. I feel a great empathy for</p>
<p> anybody who is involved in a domestic family breakdown and feels the loss</p>
<p> of contact with his or her children and the break up of his or her family.</p>
<p> But regrettably we have a legal system in this country....I mean it's</p>
<p> not regrettable, the legal system is not regrettable, but we have a system,</p>
<p> regrettably we have family breakdown and no matter what legal system you</p>
<p> have, no matter what legal system you have in this country you're</p>
<p> going to have people unhappy with the adjudication of the courts. And</p>
<p> for as many people in your situation there would be others in different</p>
<p> situations who would express the same sense of indignation.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Dairy industry and corruption allegations]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, sir, the dairy deregulation procedure is governed, is governed</p>
<p> by State law. The dairy industry at the present time and the quota system</p>
<p> that operates in New South Wales, and the somewhat different system that</p>
<p> operates in Victoria, is entirely controlled by State law not by Federal</p>
<p> law. What the Federal government has said is this Â that if there</p>
<p> is agreement amongst the States and in turn the States are consulting</p>
<p> and talking with their respective dairy industries, if there is agreement</p>
<p> amongst the States we will facilitate the introduction of change and restructuring</p>
<p> through the imposition of a levy which would raise a significant amount</p>
<p> of money through in effect holding up the consumer price at a higher level</p>
<p> than it would otherwise be under deregulation, and using the proceeds</p>
<p> of that levy to in effect compensate people for the withdrawal of their</p>
<p> quotas.</p>
<p>Now, it's a joint Commonwealth-State thing. The legal control of</p>
<p> the industry is in the hands of the State government. The funding of the</p>
<p> levy system is a matter that requires the involvement of the Federal government.</p>
<p> And what we have said is that we see some general merit in a restructuring</p>
<p> of the industry but the people who will be affected by that restructuring</p>
<p> need financial assistance and that is why we've introduced the proposal</p>
<p> for the levy. And we are awaiting the outcome of I understand referenda</p>
<p> that is being held in the various States and we're awaiting responses</p>
<p> from the individual State governments. I know nothing of your claims in</p>
<p> relation to corruption. It's nothing that we're doing that in</p>
<p> any way is related to corruption. What we're saying to the industry</p>
<p> is that if you decide as an industry in cooperation with the State governments</p>
<p> that you want to deregulate then we will provide the mechanism of a federally</p>
<p> raised levy in order to fund the buying out of the quotas and therefore</p>
<p> ease the financial burden of milk people who are affected by the deregulation.</p>
<p> Thank you. Do we have another question.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Employment in regional areas]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you ask me what are the policies to create jobs. The policies to</p>
<p> create jobs are at a number of levels. Firstly general economic policies</p>
<p> do create.....better economic policies do create more jobs. It's</p>
<p> a myth for people to say that there have been no jobs created in regional</p>
<p> Australia over the last four years. If you actually look at the figures</p>
<p> the comparative rise in the number of jobs in regional Australia has been</p>
<p> approximately the same as the rise in jobs in the cities. No, look, I</p>
<p> mean, look, I'm endeavouring to answer your question. I think it's</p>
<p> only fair to others once you've asked your question you let me answer</p>
<p> and we move onto another and people and make whatever judgement they want</p>
<p> to make about both the question and the answer. Now, that is the first</p>
<p> level at which you create it.</p>
<p>The second level in which you endeavour to create jobs is where appropriate</p>
<p> to have specific policies which are designed to provide more job assistance</p>
<p> in individual regions which are harder hit by unemployment. And one of</p>
<p> the things that the rural summit was charged with was the best policies</p>
<p> that could be designed to do that. The third thing is to have general</p>
<p> economic policies that are tilted towards giving a greater advantage to</p>
<p> the regions than the metropolitan areas and I mentioned in my opening</p>
<p> remarks reductions in the price of fuel. Reductions in the price of diesel</p>
<p> fuel are of no benefit virtually to people in the city but they are of</p>
<p> enormous benefit to businesses in the country, and they will provide very</p>
<p> very significant benefits for businesses which operate in country areas.</p>
<p> You have seen a reduction in unemployment in this area but it is still</p>
<p> too high. As to the circumstances of the individual person you mentioned</p>
<p> I would have to have some more detail about that before I could do so.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The answer to the second question is yes and it was found to be quite</p>
<p> unworkable because it would fall a very very, with great discrimination</p>
<p> against those businesses that were involved in high volume turn over and</p>
<p> would disproportionately harm them compared with businesses that have</p>
<p> lower volume but higher margin turnovers. There is just no way in all</p>
<p> the examination that we undertook we could get around that. And that is</p>
<p> why a transaction tax of the type I think you have in mind has not been</p>
<p> introduced anywhere else in the world. ....I beg your pardon. Norfolk</p>
<p> Island. Yeah well I'm sorry. It's been introduced in Norfolk</p>
<p> Island. I thought the answer was none but if you say it's Norfolk</p>
<p> Island, I'm not sure that it's exactly that. But yeah that's</p>
<p> the reason. You asked me about roads. Since coming to office we've</p>
<p> done a number of things that have been of direct benefit to regional roads.</p>
<p> One of those was the introduction of what's called the RONI scheme</p>
<p> Â Roads of National Importance Â whereby the State and Federal</p>
<p> government provide half of the funding each to construct roads of national</p>
<p> importance and as a result of that a number of very significant decisions</p>
<p> have been announced and construction has commenced in relation to Roads</p>
<p> of National Importance. We, of course, have continued to fund at a very</p>
<p> high level and given absolute priority to improvements and extensions</p>
<p> and upgrading of the Pacific Highway as part of the national roads program.</p>
<p> We also provide some specific money to the States which they can use on</p>
<p> a discretionary basis in relation to roads, and they can make their contribution</p>
<p> out of that to rural roads. As to increased funding to roads, well, that's</p>
<p> something that we'll look at in the budget context in the same way</p>
<p> as we do other things.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Cost of education. How much did you pay when you went to university?]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, when I went to university of course there were full fees or Commonwealth</p>
<p> scholarships. The first year my fees were paid in full by my parents.</p>
<p> Well they were. Well as a lot of people were. I didn't have a Commonwealth</p>
<p> scholarship the first year I was at university and my mother was able</p>
<p> to pay my fees. And I had a part time job at the weekend. I worked in</p>
<p> Noth and Kirby's between 11 o'clock and 3 o'clock on Friday,</p>
<p> and on Saturday morning like lots of other people did then and still do</p>
<p> now. They have part-time jobs. And in my second and subsequent....I</p>
<p> know you don't like the answer because it doesn't quite fit</p>
<p> what you expected does it? In the second, third and fourth year, second</p>
<p> third and fourth year I was fortunate enough to win a Commonwealth scholarship</p>
<p> that nearly paid my tuition fees during those years.</p>
<p>Now, as for the HECS system I think the HECS system is very fair to the</p>
<p> entire community and I defend the HECS system very strongly. I think the</p>
<p> idea, I think the idea that the ordinary tax payer should totally fund</p>
<p> the cost of sending young people to university to see those people, many</p>
<p> of them go on to earn quite rightly and quite positively very high incomes</p>
<p> without having made any contribution to the cost of their education, I</p>
<p> don't think that is reasonable. What is good about HECS? Well you</p>
<p> can disagree as much as you choose. I think HECS is a fair system because</p>
<p> what it says to people is that if you can pay it up front then you pay</p>
<p> it up front. If you can't pay it up front you aren't obliged</p>
<p> to pay it until after you start to earn an income and I ask you and I</p>
<p> ask the ordinary taxpayers of this country who don't go to university,</p>
<p> who don't send their children to university, don't you regard</p>
<p> that as a fairer use of your taxpayers' dollars rather than subsidising</p>
<p> the full cost of sending young people to our universities.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Veterans' Affairs grants]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will have those specific issues examined, the ones that you've</p>
<p> raised. I can't let the comment go by about Bruce Scott without saying</p>
<p> that I think he's done a very good job as Veterans' Affairs</p>
<p> Minister and I'm sorry that your view is different. The mail I get</p>
<p> from veteran communities is that Bruce is a very dedicated and conscientious</p>
<p> minister. I can't pretend that every request of veterans has been</p>
<p> met anymore than I can pretend that very request of every other group</p>
<p> has been met. We have delivered on all of our major commitments in that</p>
<p> area, including the introduction of course of the Gold Card which is very</p>
<p> well...I know it's in relation to people over a certain age, and</p>
<p> we are examining the agent orange report that we received recently and</p>
<p> we're not in a position to give a response to that. But I will investigate</p>
<p> the apparent lopsided allocation of the grants.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't get to Nimbin in the next 48 hours. Well I'm</p>
<p> sorry. I promised to go somewhere else and I think it would be very ill-mannered</p>
<p> of me if I didn't keep that particular promise. Look I'll have</p>
<p> a look as to whether I've properly responded to that material you</p>
<p> sent through. I get 4,000 bits of mail a week and I can't remember</p>
<p> everything that comes in. But I have since the first question was asked</p>
<p> by the gentlemen, my ever vigilant principal private secretary has handed</p>
<p> me a note saying that my office did reply in detail to the gentleman's</p>
<p> submission and, in fact, Mr Nutt himself signed the letter. He remembered</p>
<p> it and he made the comment I guess in accordance with what I said that</p>
<p> it was one of those particularly unhappy family law cases. So I wouldn't</p>
<p> want the audience to think that correspondence of that kind is ignored.</p>
<p> You have to understand that it's not always possible for a Prime</p>
<p> Minister to read every submission that's put to him. I mean we're</p>
<p> an open democratic society. Everybody thinks they've got the solution.</p>
<p> We try and examine things on their merits.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Where will privatisation end?]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm rather glad you asked me that question because you say</p>
<p> we're hell bent on selling off Telstra, our assets. Do you know who</p>
<p> we've sold it to? We've sold it to a couple of million ordinary</p>
<p> men and women of Australia. We've sold it to Australians and can</p>
<p> I tell you I know lots of Australians who are very very happy to buy shares</p>
<p> in Telstra, and I even know lots of Labor voters who are very happy to</p>
<p> buy shares in Telstra as well, and they're very very happy to be</p>
<p> share owners. They're very happy to have the nice share increase,</p>
<p> but they they're also happy to hide behind a generalised political</p>
<p> attack. I think selling Telstra to the men and women of Australia is an</p>
<p> exercise in Australian democracy. We're selling it to the men and</p>
<p> women of Australia. That's who we're selling it to.</p>
<p> QUESTION:</p>
<p>[GST on tampons]</p>
<p>J:</p>
<p>The inclusion of tampons in the GST is entirely defensible, entirely</p>
<p> defensible on the grounds that to be effective a taxation reform of this</p>
<p> kind should be based as broadly as possible and that is precisely why</p>
<p> I've taken the view that once you exempt one item then pressure will</p>
<p> arise to exempt another. And you have to look at it in the overall context</p>
<p> and if you look at the overall impact of that on a budget, when you take</p>
<p> into account the increase in allowances that is going to occur, and changes</p>
<p> in taxation it is entirely defensible. And it is not the intention of</p>
<p> the government to change that position. What part of rural Australia do</p>
<p> you come from? In Lismore, yes okay. I'm interested to know, sir.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Regional employment and suicide]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, sir, I agree with you that the teenage suicide rate in this country</p>
<p> is far too high and it's particularly bad amongst males in rural</p>
<p> Australia. That group both by way of the age cohort and the location had</p>
<p> the highest incidence of youth suicide in the nation. Unemployment and</p>
<p> lack of self-esteem has a good deal to do with it. You are right about</p>
<p> the desirability of shifting government activities away from the centre.</p>
<p> As far as possible we're endeavouring to do that. I mean for example</p>
<p> the....well, I mean, let me just give you an illustration, and I don't</p>
<p> come here suggesting for a moment that all wisdom in this country resides</p>
<p> in Canberra. It is true that I've only been engaged for a week in</p>
<p> this particular visit, but I'd point out to the earlier speaker that</p>
<p> this is not the only rural trip that I've undertaken in the time</p>
<p> that I've been Prime Minister and there will be quite a number of</p>
<p> rural trips that I will undertake of a similar kind to get the views of</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>One of the advantages, can I point out to you, of the new arrangements</p>
<p> for the Job Network is that because the Federal government is funding</p>
<p> not only the government owned provider for the contracts it wins, but</p>
<p> also the private providers. And because there are more private providers</p>
<p> and providers overall in the rural and regional areas in the second Job</p>
<p> Network tender, as a result of that there will be over time I believe</p>
<p> an increased number of people employed in the job Network system in rural</p>
<p> and regional Australia. We have endeavoured through programs such as the</p>
<p> Natural Heritage Trust, through programs such as Networking the Nation,</p>
<p> both of which have been fully funded out of the partial privatisation</p>
<p> of Telstra, the sale of shares in Telstra to the men and women of Australia.</p>
<p> Because we've got funds from that we've been able to generate</p>
<p> more employment opportunities in country areas of Australia. But the point</p>
<p> you make about the government having a role in boosting employment in</p>
<p> regional areas is taken. It's a very legitimate point to make.</p>
<p>Well in relation to suicide, I understood the gentlemen to couch the</p>
<p> question in terms of employment. But also can I point out to you that</p>
<p> the reasons for suicide as everybody in this audience will know are to</p>
<p> do....they're to do with a whole range of factors. They're</p>
<p> to do with the breakdown, well the stress of unemployment is one of them.</p>
<p> But the breakdown of personal relationships is another, the breakdown</p>
<p> of families is another, and there are a whole variety of reasons as to</p>
<p> why there is suicide. It is possible for the government, and we have committed</p>
<p> something in order I think of $48 million over a period of four years</p>
<p> for a national suicide prevention program which is....well you can</p>
<p> always say in isolation something is not enough. The sky is the limit</p>
<p> in relation to what you could spend on any individual item. But unlike</p>
<p> some people governments have to stay in touch with the reality of what</p>
<p> can be provided in particular areas. So we do have a comprehensive strategy</p>
<p> to try and improve the situation in relation to youth suicide. We can't</p>
<p> stop it. We can't abolish it. No government can. And people take</p>
<p> their lives for a combination of reasons. Some of those reasons are influenced</p>
<p> by economic circumstances, others are influenced by emotional circumstances</p>
<p> over which no government no matter what political persuasion can have</p>
<p> any control.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Visit to Lismore by Paul Keating, and funding into rural Australia]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I suppose that when Mr Keating came here he had a public gathering</p>
<p> like this. Did he? Did Mr Keating when he came to Lismore, did Mr Keating</p>
<p> have a public gathering....I'll come to the question....No</p>
<p> you've had....now I know you may not like the answer. I've</p>
<p> been in this game long enough and I can tell by the smile, I can tell</p>
<p> by the smile on the face of the questioner that that particular man that</p>
<p> asked me the question has probably never voted for me in his life and</p>
<p> is never likely to, and he's probably a member of the Australian</p>
<p> Labor Party isn't he. But there you are, of course he is. But ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen, let me answer. What the gentleman sooght to say was that</p>
<p> the Keating Government, the Keating Government was better for the bush</p>
<p> than the present government. That was the take out of the statement. Well</p>
<p> even he has the decency to shake his head at that. And of course the Keating</p>
<p> Government, Mr Keating may have made that particular announcement here.</p>
<p> I haven't checked the records, I'm not going to say that the</p>
<p> statement you made is wrong. I'd contrast his visit to this town</p>
<p> and whether or not he was willing to take all questions in an open and</p>
<p> public meeting with my willingness to do that. I think you'll find</p>
<p> that he wasn't and in fact it's been made perfectly clear to</p>
<p> me that he was very reluctant to do that whenever he visited any part</p>
<p> of Australia, and it's one of the things that I set out to do by</p>
<p> contrast when I became Prime Minister. Look the economic conditions for</p>
<p> the Australian bush when Mr Keating was Prime Minister, and I know because</p>
<p> I inherited the conditions when I became Prime Minister, you had interest</p>
<p> rates of over 20%, you had an unemployment rate in this area that was</p>
<p> about 4% higher than what it is now. You had an inflation rate significantly</p>
<p> higher than what it is now. You had a budget deficit which he concealed</p>
<p> of $10.5 billion. So by no stretch of imagination can anybody other than</p>
<p> somebody who has a political commitment to the memory of Mr Keating allege</p>
<p> that the bush was better off under Keating than it is under the present</p>
<p> government.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Mental health care.]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, sir, I have a considerable degree of agreement with you on that</p>
<p> issue. I'm not certain that the path down which mental health went</p>
<p> a few years ago towards the approach that you've outlines was necessarily</p>
<p> the right one. You are right in saying that it is a State responsibility.</p>
<p> I'm not, I mean it's very easy....I mean I suppose you could</p>
<p> have a situation where Federal Government was responsible for everything</p>
<p> and you abolished the States but I don't think may people would support</p>
<p> that. And so I don't think, I mean, I can do other than to say to</p>
<p> you I share some of your concerns and I hope that when Mr Carr comes to</p>
<p> this hall and has his public forum then you might raise the question with</p>
<p> him. I think it would be a very appropriate way. I mean I believe in accountability,</p>
<p> I believe that the Federal government should be accountable for its responsibilities,</p>
<p> and from time to time on huge national issues give a lead even though</p>
<p> it's a State area. And State governments should be made accountable</p>
<p> for their responsibilities. Unfortunately State governments in this country</p>
<p> of both political stripes, whenever they're under criticism on health</p>
<p> they say oh it's because we don't have enough money from the</p>
<p> Federal government and they say that whether there's a Federal Labor</p>
<p> government or a Federal Liberal government. And both State Labor and State</p>
<p> Liberal governments or State National Party governments say exactly the</p>
<p> same thing. And I think it's time that the Australian electorate</p>
<p> said to State members of parliament, you are responsible for B, C and</p>
<p> D, we'll make you accountable, and you said to us you are responsible</p>
<p> for A, B, C and D, and we'll make you accountable for those things.</p>
<p> But I actually think the point you make has got a lot of merit in it and</p>
<p> I would like you to pursue it with Mr Carr when he has his forum here.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Aboriginal issues, and a government apology for the stolen generation.]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I agree with that, I agree with that. What you've just said is,</p>
<p> the last bit of your comment is very similar to comments I made over the</p>
<p> past few days about tackling problems in relations between indigenous</p>
<p> Australians and other Australians. I've said that it's not something</p>
<p> that has to be tackled on the basis of two groups with fixed positions</p>
<p> negotiating with each other, but rather seeing all of us as part of the</p>
<p> one community. And I was asked on a number of occasions why I haven't</p>
<p> had meetings with the Land Councils. And I replied that I hadn't</p>
<p> had separate meetings with the National Farmers Federation either. What</p>
<p> I'd done was to have meetings with community leaders together and</p>
<p> to try and get a sense of community in relation to the tackling of these</p>
<p> problems. You of course in the first part of your question asked me why,</p>
<p> although I had personally on numerous occasions said that I was personally</p>
<p> sorry for any injustices done to Aboriginal people years ago. I've</p>
<p> said that repeatedly. I personally regret any injustices inflicted on</p>
<p> any of my fellow Australians at any time. The point I made and the point</p>
<p> to which I stick is that I don't see that it's appropriate for</p>
<p> a formal national apology to be made by the current generation. Look can</p>
<p> I please finish. ....a formal national apology to be made by the current</p>
<p> generation of Australians in relation to......</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because the current generation of Australians were not involved. And somebody</p>
<p> says so what. Well I think it does matter. And as an Aboriginal elder</p>
<p> said to me in South Australia, he said I don't think you should say</p>
<p> sorry because you didn't steal anybody.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Farming challenges]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think, sir, you've put it very eloquently and we have been, and</p>
