OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH CODE FOR<br />
COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES<br />
The Government has decided to implement the Code of General<br />
Principles on Safety and Health designed to protect<br />
Commonwealth employees from injury through work accidents<br />
and to promote maximum occupational health.<br />
This decision will give a lead to industry and commerce in<br />
cutting down the one million man weeks now lost to Australia<br />
every year through industrial accidents and injuries.<br />
Absences from work through accident and illness are greater<br />
than from industrial disputes and seriously affect national<br />
productivity. The direct cost to the nation of work injuries is now estimated<br />
to be about $ 1,400m a year. In the area of Commonwealth<br />
employment alone for 1975-76 $ 21m went in compensation payments.<br />
This indicates that there is scope for considerable improvement<br />
in industrial safety and health despite the efforts of many<br />
organisations to safeguard their employees.<br />
The Code provides for control of the physical environment<br />
and also for training, consultation between managers and employees,<br />
and their maximum involvement in accident prevention measures.<br />
It defines the responsibilities of people at various-levels in<br />
Commonwealth departments and authorities in promoting safety<br />
and good working conditions.<br />
The Code of Principles supplemented by detailed Codes of<br />
Practice covers all aspects of industrial health and safety<br />
for Commonwealth employees.<br />
These include the scope and definition of safety measures;<br />
safety co-ordination; provision of a safe and healthy working<br />
environment; machine, plant and equipment safety; personal<br />
protective equipment; hygiene; special measures to protect<br />
employees in the-field or in isolated areas; health, medical<br />
and first-aid services; accident records, statistics and<br />
investigation. </p>
<p>2<br />
The Department of Productivity will be responsible for<br />
generally oversighting and evaluating the Code's effectiveness;<br />
the Director-General of Health will have responsibility<br />
for occupational health recommendations.<br />
The Code is a major step forward in the area of occupational<br />
safety and health for Commonwealth employees. Several states<br />
have adopted Codes which follow it closely with minor<br />
revisions. Indeed, a representative of State Labour Departments<br />
assisted in the development of the Code, as of course did<br />
representatives of trade and Public Service unions.<br />
The Department of Productivity will continue working in<br />
association with State Departments of Labour, unions, employers<br />
and other interested groups in the community to improve<br />
safety and health for people at work.<br />

INDEX </p>
<p>FOREWORD On 10 September 1974, the Australian Government agreed that<br />
Ministers direct departments and statutory authorities for which<br />
they have responsibility, to apply the Code of General Principles<br />
on Occupational Safety and Health in Australian Government<br />
Employment.<br />
The Department of Labor and Immigration has responsibility for<br />
the general oversight in relation to the implementation of the<br />
Code except for occupational health recommendations which<br />
will be determined by the Director-General of Health, Department<br />
of Health.<br />
The purpose of this Code is to protect persons employed by<br />
the Australian Government from accidental injury and to promote<br />
the maximum degree of health and well being. Because any<br />
work injury results from inter-reaction between a worker and<br />
his or her working environment, there is no such thing as<br />
absolute safety. Maximum safety cannot be ensured by control<br />
of the environment alone but demands the understanding and<br />
co-operation of all persons at all levels.<br />
Consequently the Code provides not only for the control of the<br />
physical environment, but for training, consultation between<br />
management and employees, and their maximum involvement<br />
in all accident prevention measures.<br />
The Code also defines the responsibilities of persons at all levels<br />
in departments and instrumentalities in the promotion of safety<br />
and good working conditions.<br />
Only two categories of persons are recognised; head officers<br />
and employees. The latter term therefore includes persons at<br />
all levels in the service, all of whom are seen as having responsibilities<br />
for safety commensurate with their positions.<br />
While the Code of General Principles defines responsibilities<br />
for safety and health and states in broad terms the action that<br />
shall be taken to fulfil them, it does not provide detailed information<br />
on the standards required.<br />
This information is to be provided in the corresponding detailed<br />
provisions. These will be collated from accepted standards and<br />
codes of practice, recommendations agreed by the State Departments<br />
of Labour, State regulations and other information as<br />
applicable. The detailed provisions will be issued as separate<br />
publications. These provisions will be taken as providing the criteria by which<br />
observance of the Code is to be judged. </p>
<p>SECTION 1<br />
