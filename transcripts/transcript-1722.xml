NATIONA-L BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
( MR HAROLD HCLT) 21ST NOVEMBER, 1967<br />
( Following Is the text of a broadcast to be made by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Holt, over the ABC' ' s network at 7. 55 pm ( EST) this evening'<br />
During this S3enate election campaign, we heard from our<br />
opponents some very curious interpretations of the now famous A-. delaide<br />
decision of the F'ederal ALP Conference on Viet Nam. The masters of<br />
Labor policy resolved that a Labor Government would withdraw cur armed<br />
forces if the United States did not consent to terms laid down by the A LP.<br />
it is an interesting fact that the Victorian Stat e Conference<br />
of the ALP in June a month before the Adelaide meeting carried a<br />
resolution very similar to the one later accepted by the Federal Conference.<br />
The Victorian resolution also said and I quote:<br />
" A1t Federal Conference and elsewhere, the A LP policy on<br />
the need to withdraw Australian troops should be stated in an<br />
unambiguous and unequivocal way so as to prevent any<br />
confusion in the public mind."<br />
It is also worth recording that the official Victorian Labor Party newspaper<br />
" Fact" said after the Federal Conference that the Adelaide decisions had<br />
formally underpinned Labor's opposition to the Viet Nam war and had<br />
reiterated the position formerly stated by Mr Arthur Calwell.<br />
The Victorian Labor President, Mr W. Brown, said on August 13<br />
that the Labor Party was moving further to the left. He went on:<br />
" The Conference had strengthened policy on the Viet Nam<br />
war. It attached a meaningful set of objectives to what<br />
basically was and remains a ' troops out' policy."<br />
Mr Brown added these significant words " Possibly we could<br />
now say that it is a policy of ' troops out unless..."'<br />
As for Mr Calwell, he said that the Adelaide decisions showed<br />
there had been no weakening of Labor opposition to the continuation of the<br />
war and to Australia's part in it.<br />
Now the history of this episode shows pretty clearly that the<br />
Adelaide resolution was the brainchild of the Left-Wing Victorian Branch<br />
of the ALP. Not so long ago, the present Leader of the Federal Parliamentary<br />
Labor Party had some unkind things to say about the leftists of the Victorian<br />
ALP. One would have thought that he favoured radical changes In the<br />
Labor Party's policy on Viet Nam. But when the masters of Labor policy<br />
spoke in Adelaide, when they wrote the policy down, the Parliamentary<br />
Leader accepted it. He had to accept it or get out. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
But what happens? Mr Whitlam knows that the policy he must<br />
carry out is repugnant to the Australian people so he pretends that it does<br />
not mean what it says. He makes great play of the phrase " holding<br />
operations". He says vaguely that the war may be over in two years. He<br />
suggests that the United States would give a kindly ear to the suggestions<br />
that it should leave the North Vietnamese free to infiltrate the South and<br />
that the American troops in the South should be content to defend themselves.<br />
This ambiguous attitude of the Opposition Leader is the crux of<br />
this campaign so far as the Viet Nam issue is concerned. It is farcical for<br />
him to assert that the United States would act upon, or even consider, the<br />
terms laid down by the Adelaide ALP Conference. The terms indeed could<br />
formally be described as an ultimatum.<br />
It is not good enough for the Leader of the Opposition to say that<br />
he will answer awkward questions about Labor policy two years from now.<br />
He is asking for votes today and he should tell Australia today what a Labor<br />
Government would do about the orders it has received from the policy-makers<br />
of the ALP.<br />
