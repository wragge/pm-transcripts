FOR MEDIA 19 JULY 1982<br />
STATEMENT ON ALCOA, PORTLAND<br />
Alcoa's announcement that,' it intends to defer letting new<br />
contracts and review existing contracts for work on its<br />
aluminium smelter project in Portland, in light of its<br />
decision to defer its planned completion date until about<br />
mid-1985, is a matter of great regret.<br />
The decision will have an impact on economic conditions<br />
throughout Victoria, but it will be a matter of particular<br />
concern to people and businesses in the Portland area.<br />
I know the hardship that will be faced by the people of<br />
Portland. The full resources of the Commonwealth<br />
Department3 of Social Security and Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations will be available to give what<br />
assistance they can. And I shall be visiting Portland<br />
on Monday next, July 26.<br />
Alcoa's decision is a clear reflection of the harsh<br />
reality of the current world economic situation. Alcoa<br />
obviously had not expected that commuodity prices and<br />
world demand would fall in the way that they have.<br />
For years we have all received repeated predictions that<br />
sustained recovery in the major world economies was<br />
imminent: but that recovery has always failed to<br />
materialise. Today it is hard to find anyone who is<br />
prepared to predict when real and sustained recovery<br />
will begin.<br />
The task that we all face in the period ahead is to do<br />
all we can to minimise the impact of world recession on<br />
the Australian economy for as long as it lasts. We<br />
must also be prepared to take full advantage of recovery<br />
when it does eventually come.<br />
The Comamonwealth Government has already' introduced a<br />
number of initiatives to further these objectives.<br />
Our proposal to free electricity authorities from Loan<br />
Council borrowing controls, which was accepted at the<br />
June meetings, has given to the States and their<br />
electricity authorities including the S. E. C. V.<br />
freedom and responsibility for meeting the power needs<br />
of all consumers, including those of resource developers.<br />
One of the reasons why we proposed this new arrangement<br />
was to ensure that there would be no impediment to<br />
electricit~ y authorities in meeting the needs of projects </p>
<p>that had already been attracted to the various States.<br />
Further, the new package of industry assistance measures<br />
announced by the Commonwealth today has improved the<br />
climate for investment by giving to industry improved<br />
depreciation allowances, and a foundation on which to<br />
base long-term planning. We now look to business to<br />
respond positively to those measures; and we look to<br />
labour by moderating its demands for higher wages and<br />
shorter hours to help those decisions bear fruit in<br />
the form of more jobs and increasing real incomes.<br />
Alcoa's decision gives added weight to the need for all<br />
Australians to work together to improve our competitiveness,<br />
our industrial relations, and our reliability as a supplier. </p>
