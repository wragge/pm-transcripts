FOR MEDIA 28 JANUARY 1989<br />
The Federal Government will provide $ 125 million towards<br />
the cost of a world standard sporting complex at Albert<br />
Park, should Melbourne be chosen to'host the 1996 Olympic<br />
Games. The contribution, indexed by the CPI, would be on a<br />
dollar for dollar basis with the Victorian Government.<br />
The Albert Park complex is the only major new facility<br />
that Melbourne needs to stage the Games.<br />
It will include facilities for basketball ( 15,000 seats),<br />
volleyball ( 7000 seats), swimming ( 10,000 seats),<br />
synchronised swimming, diving, badminton and table<br />
tennis. Albert Park was chosen as a project worthy of federal<br />
support because it will provide ongoing benefits to<br />
Australia as a major facility for other international<br />
sporting events.<br />
Construction of the facilities is expected to start<br />
during the 1991-92 financial year and continue through -to<br />
1996. The International Olympic Committee will decide in<br />
September, this year, which city will host the Games.<br />
I am confident Melbourne is a serious and genuine<br />
contender, and I have stressed the city's impeccable<br />
credentials in discussions I have had this weekend with<br />
Mr Juan Samaranch, the President of the IOC.<br />
The Federal Government is also playing its part through<br />
our Embassies and High Commissions by informing IOC<br />
delegates of Melbourne's bid and helping in arrangements<br />
for IOC members to visit Victoria.<br />
We are doing this because we believe the Games would have<br />
significant economic benefits for Australia. Apart from<br />
attracting large numbers of international visitors for<br />
the events themselves, they would provide an opportunity<br />
for tourism promotion of lasting benefit.<br />
A large number of jobs would be created in the lead up t~ o<br />
the Games, and the capital facilities constructed would<br />
be enjoyed for years to come in this city famous for its;<br />
love for and commitment to sport. ( i </p>
