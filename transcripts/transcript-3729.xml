PRM MINISTER' COFREC S'<br />
Following-is the transcrip~ t of the Prim-Miister's pr-s<br />
conference held in. Kingston oni 4 May 1975,<br />
Prime Minister's Press Conference, Jamaica Sunday May 1975-<br />
Ques tion: Is it true that you o proposed a Conow.] th Aid<br />
scheme for Vietnam, as was reported in the local press here?<br />
Prime Minister: No. I haventt been able to read the local press<br />
over the weekend. 1 suppose the story would flow from the [ icet<br />
that on Friday just before we broke up For the wecken-cv!<br />
suggested that there should be a refference in the cOf. nuij.<br />
the end of the conference, to int[-ernational siLuce r<br />
reconcilialLon and reconstruction in Vietnam. It-Lwas abcutL<br />
brief as that, I suggested that there ShOUl'J be somk e r~ e<br />
Question: What is you reactionC esi Lion Prim(,! n sc~<br />
Burnham of Guyana, which is; that if aCIL t. tk'f to-get. a.<br />
redistribution of wealth towards the developing couin!. ry a* nd the<br />
developing countries will be justified in setting ppo,-~'<br />
only organisations to secure that change in the disrribution<br />
world's wealth?<br />
Prime Minister: Well son--. ofi you k
Therefore for the former I will1 rcpeat For the ot. her-I wi. ll<br />
state, that I do nor-answer questions wh-ich are prediLearted onl<br />
somebody else's sumary of what somrre colleague miight. ha-ae said.<br />
When we were discussing the general economic trade mnatters, the<br />
discussion was started by Prime Minister Wilson and the second<br />
speaker was Prime Minister Burnham. Prime Minister Buirnham suggte<br />
that there should be an expert group set up to examine all features<br />
of trade with the objective of sharing the world's wealth more~ / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
equitably. Over the weekend the officials advising the various<br />
Heads of Government have got together and they have produced the<br />
terms of reference for the group of wise men. And I suppose that<br />
those terms of reference and maybe, the personnel in the group,<br />
wil]. be announced before we disperse from Kingston. But Prime<br />
Minister Burnham's basic suggestion was that there should be an<br />
expert committee appointed by the Conference to advise the<br />
Commonwealth Finance Ministers and also delegates from the<br />
Commonwealth to the United Nations General Assembly later in . the<br />
year. And that suggestion has been acted on.<br />
Question: Can you give me your version of the reported friction<br />
between. Australia and New Zealand over the question of nuclear<br />
free zones for the South Pacific?<br />
Prime Minister: The question of nuclear free zones has not been<br />
mentioned in the Conference or, as far as I know, outside it.<br />
I was told there was some reference to friction: there is no<br />
basis for any such report.<br />
Q,' estion: Can I ask your reaction to producer associations per<br />
se, as against producer-consumer associations?<br />
Prime Minister: Well the best thing would be to have producerconsumer<br />
associations. Australia has been a member of such<br />
associations for many years in the past in respect to<br />
primary products. There have in recent years been several<br />
produc. er associations in mineral resources. Australia is a member<br />
of one, she is an observer at another and she is helping to found<br />
a third. The best thing is to have both producers and consumers<br />
in such associations. If, however, consumers will not join s.. ch<br />
associations, producers should go ahead and form their own. It<br />
is certainly one of the trends at the moment that there should be<br />
such associations. One arose from the discussion at the last<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Ottawa the<br />
International Bauxite Association.<br />
Question: Prime Minister what would you reaction be to a<br />
request by white Rhodesians to come to Australia, when they<br />
finally realise that they had to leave their own country or the<br />
country that they are in now? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Prime Minister: This is entirely speculative. Australia like<br />
all other members of the United Nations are bound by certain<br />
resolutions of the United Nations. Australia has followed those,<br />
and particularly since my Government came to office, it has followed<br />
them very strictly.<br />
Question: Would you tell us whether your view of world trade is<br />
closer to that of Mr Burnham or Mr Wilson?<br />
Prime Minister: This is far too simplistic a question. Mr Wilson<br />
supported at the end of the debate on this subject Mr Burnham's<br />
proposal that there should be an expert group. And from what I'm<br />
told the British officials, as well as the other officials,<br />
have co-operated in the terms of reference which ha. ve been drawn<br />
up over this weekend. I know it's a fascinating thing to have a<br />
confrontation between Britain and Guyana, it enthralls me I<br />
haven't been able to sleep over the whole of the weekend as to the<br />
outcome of such a confrontation. But these things never seem to be<br />
quite as dramatic in the outcome:.<br />
Question: While here in Kingston Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of<br />
Singapore, commenting on Australia accepting refugees from Vietnam,<br />
said: " Maybe it was a fit of emotional spasm, a sense of guilt,<br />
maybe some Aussie in a drunken moment may have left something<br />
behind and therefore you feel you have atoned for it, but have you"?<br />
Can I ask you whether that's arational assessment of Australia's<br />
humanitarian efforts. Or alternatively do you regard the<br />
remarks as highly offensive and insulting?<br />
Prime Minister: Assuming you are correctly quoting what Mr Lee<br />
Kuan Yew said, I presume he was inferring that Australian soldiers,<br />
during their service in Vietnam, had left children behind. If<br />
Australian soldiers have children in Vietnam, certainly the<br />
Australian Government would help to bring those children to<br />
Australia. I have not come across any application to bring any<br />
Australian soldier's child to Australia. Perhaps I should add<br />
that there have been quite a number of children brought from<br />
Vietnam to Australia by the Australian Government about 300<br />
of them and they were brought in these circumstances: where<br />
the former South Vietnamese Government had certified that these<br />
children were elegible for adoption and where the Australian<br />
State Governments w, 1o have the constitutional responsibility / 4 </p>
<p>in such matters in Australia certified that there were suitable<br />
parents waiting to adopt. So in those circumstances there has<br />
been a reunion between about 300 eligible children and suitable<br />
parents. My Government arranged some time last year that the<br />
Australian Government would pay the passages of any children from<br />
Vietnam who were coming for adoption in Australia. In this case,<br />
of course, the children were brought in aircraft which belonged<br />
to the Royal. Australian Air Force or were chartered by the Australian<br />
Government. I conclude, I know of no case where an Australian<br />
soldier's child has been nominated to come to Australia. Inquestionably<br />
the Australian Government would have assisted in<br />
bringing any such children to Australia.<br />
Question: But was it done out of a sense of guilt, Prime Minister?<br />
An emotional spasm as Mr Lee Kuan Yew has put it?<br />
Prime Minister: I hesitate to comment on other people's news<br />
conferences, because so often I find that a great deal is lost or<br />
gained in transmission. I've stated the circumstances in which<br />
children from Vietnam have been brought to Australia, and I<br />
believe they are very proper circumstances. There was quite a<br />
deal of agitation to bring many more children, but no greater<br />
number of children could be found for whom the Vietnamese<br />
Government was prepared to give a certificate that they were<br />
available for adoption, or State Governments were prepared to gi'e<br />
certificates that there were suitable parents.<br />
Question: What about adult Vietnamese?<br />
Prime Minister: The Australian Government said that adul. t Vietna imese<br />
could come to Australia if they were the spouses of Australian<br />
citizens or if they were the spouses of Vietnamese students who<br />
were being given temporary permits to remain in Australia to<br />
complete their courses of study. In addition decisions were made in<br />
individual cases where there were Vietnamese adults, whose conduct<br />
in association with Australians over the years would have<br />
placed their lives in jeopardy.<br />
Question: In other words they had to have a connection?<br />
Prime Minister: Of course, yes. </p>
<p>Question: Last week at the conference you were reported as saying<br />
that multinational companies had too much influence and control.<br />
I was wondering why you raised it at this conference and whether<br />
you were seeking some Commonwea'lth initiative?<br />
Prime Minister: I raised the same matter at the conference in<br />
Ottawa where I was asked to initiate the discussion on trade<br />
and ecc: nomic matters. I made a reference to this subject in<br />
the same item this time. I wanted to make the point that<br />
international trade was concerned with commodities certainly, but<br />
it also depended on a very great number of other matters which<br />
militated against the developing countries and in fact, against<br />
what are regarded as developed countries such as Australia,<br />
because international trade depends for its infrastructure on<br />
credit facilities, insurance facilities, transport facilities,<br />
and these are in the hands, very largely, of international,<br />
multinational companies. Most of the countries in the Commonwealth,<br />
certainly the developed countries in the Commonwealth, have<br />
mixed economies, the private sector is predominant and its<br />
companies very often usually in fact multinational companies<br />
that provide the banking, the insurance and the transport<br />
facilities for international trade. Accordingly to deal<br />
with international trade in terms of commodities alone is<br />
to deal with only part of international trade. It maybe that<br />
commodities are the principle preoccupation of Britain among the<br />
developed countries in the Commonwealth. But itwould be quite<br />
absurd for a Head of Government from Canada or Australia or New<br />
Zealand or Singapore, the other deve. oped countries i. n the<br />
Commonwealth to overlook the aspects of international trade<br />
which turn not on commodities, but on banking, insurance and<br />
transport. I should add that I was concerned also, to see that<br />
the discussion turned on increased processing of commodities in<br />
the country of origin, because unquestionably a country's w,. a] th<br />
depends very largely on the extent to which it is processing<br />
commodities. The countries which produce commodities would be very<br />
much wealthier, the gap between them and the developed countries<br />
would be very much reduced, if they were able to process their<br />
commodities to a greater extent. There again, international<br />
companies provide so much of the wherewithal for processing.<br />
They control, in mixed economies, such matters as technology and<br />
capital. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Question: Could I ask you about the British membership of the<br />
European Common Market,. bearing in mind that the British people<br />
will be voting on the referendum in a month's i. ine. Would you<br />
like to see Britain remain a member of the Market?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes. I -said that a few months ago when I was<br />
in Britain and when I was in most of the countries of the<br />
European Economic Community. I said then that there was . no<br />
advantage to Australia in Britain withdrawing from the Market.<br />
I believe the same has been said by the Prime Minister of Canada<br />
and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, in the Common Market<br />
countries including Britain. During the discussion the four<br />
days discussions so far of the Heads of Government Meeting here<br />
there hasn't been a single suggestion that it would be to the<br />
advantage of any of the members for Britain to withdraw from<br />
EEC. There have been several statements that it would be to the<br />
advantage of the members if Britain were to remain in the EEC.<br />
Tribute was paid by several countries to the skill with which the<br />
Wilson Government has renegotiated terms to the advantage of<br />
developing Commonwealth countries. I hesitate to comment on a<br />
matter which is primarily Britaints concern but since this matter<br />
has arisen in the Heads of Government Meeting, since the matter<br />
has been put to me when I have been in Britain, I suppose there<br />
is no particular harm in me giving the same answer as T always have<br />
given. There are many matters of political controversy in my<br />
country and such is the neurosis of some people who were dragged<br />
from the tart shop after 23 years in Government, that<br />
there is any basis whatever for criticising my Government,<br />
that basis will be exploited ad nausem. It is sufficient to<br />
say that my views on Britain remaining in the Common Market haven't<br />
produced a ripple of criticism in Australia. I wouldn't lose a<br />
single vote in Australia by saying that Britain should remain in the<br />
EEC. None of my opponents., none of my rivals, have seen any advantage<br />
for them in saying that I should discourage Britain from staying in,.<br />
I should encourage Britain to get out. This may come as some<br />
surprise to you because it is true that throughout the sixties and<br />
indeed there was an attempt in the seventies, by our opponents<br />
the previous government to make it difficult for Britain to<br />
join the Common Market. Britain is now in. Everybody accepts that<br />
this is the proper thing and nobody thinks it would be to our<br />
advantage and I suppose I am at least entitled to express that,<br />
views on that question nobody believes that it would be to Australia's<br />
advantage for Britain to get out of the Common Market. I<br />
believe there are some people in the Briti'sh Labor Party who<br />
feel that somehow the social democrat governments who are in / 7 </p>
<p>power in Australia, and New Zealand, and Singapore and virtually<br />
in Canada, should somehow rally to the cause of getting Britain<br />
out. The suggestion has been made to all of them. It has been made<br />
for some months. None of them have responded to the<br />
suggestion. Perhaps I could warm to the subject by saying, that<br />
as a person whose ancestors all came from Britain three-quarters<br />
from England and one-quarter from Scotland I don't relish the<br />
thought that England might lapse into the position of Spain<br />
-looking to a mighty empire in the past and a peripheral<br />
influence for the future.<br />
Question: Prime Minister can I revert to your previous question<br />
on the Common Market. In view of what you have said Ministers<br />
have in the past, without perhaps a lot of evidence been saying<br />
in Britian that the entire Commonwealth supports Britain's<br />
continued membership of the European Community. On the strength<br />
of what you have heard here, from your colleagues and in the<br />
Conference and outside it, would you say that they would be<br />
justified in future in continuing to make that claim?<br />
Prime Minister: That the Commonwealth supports Britain's<br />
membership of the European Economic Community?<br />
Question: Yes.<br />
Prime Minister: I believe that would be a correct statement.<br />
Certainly there has been no statement in the Conference which<br />
would in any way cast doubt on that proposition. On the other hand<br />
it would be quite wrong to say that most people have expressed<br />
a view in favour of Britain remaining in. Most people haven't<br />
spoken on this on the relevant items where this matL er would arise.<br />
But everybody who has mentioned it has mentioned it in<br />
two contexts that they believe that Britain should rema-i, in<br />
the Market secondly, that the Wilson Government has been able<br />
to make very beneficial changes as regards each country itself.<br />
Question: But do you think on that second point that there is<br />
likely to be anything in the communique to make that point?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't know. I would certainly support any such<br />
statement in the communique. I think it would be a relevant<br />
feature in the communique and it would be an accurate statement. / 8 </p>
<p>Question: The fact that Britain has used her membership usefully<br />
on behalf of members of the Commonwealth and their relationship<br />
with the community?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes, I believe that that would be an accurate<br />
statement and I believe that it would be a relevant contribution<br />
to the cormmunique. I don't think there can be any doubt that<br />
of all the members of the European Economic Community, none is<br />
in a better place than Britain to speak on behalf of the<br />
developing countries. Britain certainly has a very great<br />
deal of experience in these respects and I think Britain's<br />
heart is in the right place in these matters.<br />
Question: Mr Prime Minister could you explain why your Government<br />
is not able to support New Zealand in its efforts to get a<br />
nuclear free zone in the South Pacific?<br />
Prime Minister: The matter hasn't arisen.<br />
Question: But I thought it has arisen before, if not at this<br />
Con ference?<br />
Prime Minister: It hasn't arisen at this Conference and I'm<br />
only concerning myself with matters at this Conference. I'm<br />
sorry I can't help you to fabricate any confrontation across the<br />
Tasman on this matter. You must be under terrific pressure<br />
from home to substantiate these stories.<br />
Quescion: My question was to explain why Australia does not<br />
support New Zealand?<br />
Prime Minister: The matter has not arisen.<br />
Question: What are the implications for Australia's security of<br />
the fall of Indo-China to the Communists? Do you feel that that<br />
has been discussed enough at this meeting? And do you still feel<br />
faith . in America as an ally for Australia's defence in that area?<br />
Prime Minister: The matter has scarcely been mentioned in the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The matters which are<br />
given most attention at the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
Meeting are the matters which concern several members and<br />
Vietnam has only directly involved Australia and New Zealand.<br />
We were the only nations which participated in the civil war. / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
We did so for several years, but our participation was ended in<br />
each case in December 1972. So you can't really expect that<br />
the question would bulk largely at a Commonwealth Meeting. I<br />
would hope that there would be some reference to reconciliation<br />
and reconstruction in Vietnam because that is something in<br />
which most of us could participate, and I believe, should participate.<br />
You asked me about America's situation. America has been,<br />
is, and will for many years, as far ahead as any of us can see,<br />
continue to be the greatest military country in the world.<br />
What I think we have to realise is that from now on, America's<br />
commitments will require the support of the Administration<br />
and the Congress. People in the past, particularly those adopting<br />
the Westminster system, have found it very puzzling, that if a<br />
Government commits itself to something.. the Parliament doesn't<br />
support it. But of course, in the Aunerican system the President<br />
and the Congress are elected separately and its not for the first<br />
time you have the situation where they have different points<br />
of view. Quite obviously Wilson and the League of Nations is<br />
one that we all remember from our history. But if the President<br />
and the Congress support a commitment then I have no reason whatever<br />
to believe that that commitment would not be effective<br />
in the circumstances which it contemplated. And as regards the<br />
arrangements between Australia, New Zealand and the United States<br />
the ANZUS arrangements I have never heard any President or any<br />
Congressional leader express any doubts as to the validity and<br />
the relevance of the arrangements. And I say in that positive<br />
way because from 1967 onwards I have on visits to Washington<br />
made a point of ascertaining the views of Congress as far as I<br />
could, as well as the Administration. And therefore I can say<br />
that from the last visit I made to Washington which was last<br />
September, Republicans and Democrats, in each house of the Congress,<br />
supported the ANZUS arrangements. I will be seeing these<br />
people as well as the President and the Vice-President next-<br />
Wednesday and Thursday, and I would expect the same situation<br />
to apply. I think we should avoid equating the situation in<br />
South Vietnam with that in any other country in the region.<br />
The reason why South Vietnam's Government failed was principally<br />
two-fold. The first was that they never were prepared to test<br />
public opinion. After the General Agreements in 1954 and after<br />
the Paris Accords in 1973, in each case the South Vietnamese<br />
Government refused to carry out the undertakings to have elections,<br />
or to have a broader-based government. That is, they just<br />
wouldn't budge on that aspect. And of course, they fell. </p>
<p>And the other reason is their situation was seen by their own<br />
citizens to depend on outside support, And no government can<br />
have the respect or support of its population if it is<br />
regarded as depending on outsiders. However the noble the<br />
motives or however the might the resources of those outsiders,<br />
no government has respect or retains support if it is seen to<br />
depend on outsiders, That situation doesn't apply with any<br />
other country in the region.<br />
Question: Could you tell. us what your attitude would be to an<br />
invasion by North Korea of South Korea?<br />
Prime Minister: That is a hypothetical question.<br />
Question: This Conference has spent almost two days discussing<br />
Rhodesia. On Friday you had every bit of 15 minutes to deal<br />
with a whole range of subjects namely, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea,<br />
the future of Portuguese Timor, the power play in the Indian<br />
Ocean. All matters of considerable importance to the peoples<br />
of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. My question is this:<br />
do you think that this Conference has spent so much time on Rhode La<br />
that other matters of vital importance to the Commonwealth,<br />
particularly in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean have been<br />
virtually shut out' And while we are on the subject, do you<br />
approve of long set speeches being given at this Conference?<br />
Prime Minister: It is inevitable t.: La this Conference should have<br />
spent a very great deal of time on Rhodesi. o, It was dealt with<br />
early because some of those who wanted to take part in it,<br />
had to leave this weekend. But it was inevitable that a very<br />
great deal of time should be spent on Rhodesia because at<br />
every Conference. throughout the 1960s and I think back in tha<br />
very great deal of time was spent on Rhodesia. It is a matter<br />
which concerns a very great number of Commnonwealth countries.<br />
Obviously it concerns the African ones, bIut it is a matter upon<br />
which most of the others feel very intensely indeed. Furthermore<br />
this time there was a very great breakthrough in that since our<br />
last Conference;-Portugal had decided to give up her empire. In<br />
those circumstances I don't think we could have expected that<br />
less time would be spent on Rhodesia Zimbabwe than was spent. ./ 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
Now on Papua New Guinea and Timor, these were only passing<br />
references I made. Obviously I would be expected to refer to<br />
Papua New Guinea because the Chief Minister on Thursday sent me<br />
a message asking that the Conference should accept Papua New<br />
Guinea's membership of the Commonwealth when she gained independence,<br />
which will be in a few months time, That was announced to the<br />
Conference on Thursday-and the first business on Friday was<br />
W. accept the proposition. Well natural]. y when I had a few<br />
ninutes I think it was about 10 minutes at the end on<br />
Friday to mention a few subjects which I thought ought to b6<br />
dealt with in the communique I referred to this situation.<br />
Every member of the Comonwealth has been a British colony with<br />
two exceptions, there was Western Samoa and now there is Papua<br />
New Guinea. So inevitably it is a matter which we should acknowledge.<br />
that a colony and a trust territory of ours should be admitted.<br />
Timor was only mentioned in the context of the Portuguese empire.<br />
After all there are some bits of it, apart from Angola, Mozambique,<br />
and Cabo Verde. I would hope later on that there would be some discussion<br />
and that in the coinmuni-que there would be some reference<br />
to the Indian Ocean because about half the Commonwealth countries<br />
are island or littoral or hinterland States of the Indian Ocean.<br />
And several of them have taken initiatives in international<br />
bodies dealing with the Indian Ocean. I think it would be<br />
appropriate for us to refer to them. And the other mater<br />
which I think ought to be mentioned is some aspects of disamname. t<br />
such as the comprehensive test ban treaty which is being<br />
discussed, or this coming week the review conference on the<br />
nuclear non-proliferation treaty.<br />
Question: In the Rhodesia question, as you mentioned you are<br />
going on to Wahsington and this Conference is much concerned<br />
with pressure on Ian Smith of a practical kind. I'm sure<br />
you will be taking up the chrome problem as part of the<br />
sanctions tightening when you're in Washington. But looking at<br />
the thing more broadly, I wonder if you could tell us why either<br />
Australia or other countries remote from Rhodesia should be<br />
concerned with the problem at this summit. I mean in what<br />
sense does it drive you to try to get a formula, why bother<br />
it certainly would be easier politically just not to worry. / 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
Prime Minister: I agree with the unanimous Commonwealth view<br />
on chrome. I wasn't proposing to raise it in Washington, its<br />
not a matter which is of prime concern to Australia. There<br />
will be very much more important matters for me to discuss in<br />
Washington. Now you mention about Rhodesia, why should it take<br />
up so much time and what are the political matters.<br />
Rhodesia has concerned people not only in the Commonwealth, but<br />
in the United Nations for quite some time. It's obviously not<br />
a prime consideration so far as Australia is concerned.<br />
Nevertheless Australia has got obligations under United Nations<br />
resolutions. It's faithfully discharged those obligations,<br />
As regards internal politics I don't say that one gains any<br />
votes in Australia by supporting this question but by the same<br />
token any votes that were going to be lost had been lost already.<br />
And from what I see of the spokesman for Ian Smith in Australia<br />
I would not expect or wish that they vote for us. . Externally<br />
it is important, that Australia should be know! n to support<br />
proper principles ' in this question. Australia cannot afford to<br />
be in the si. uatio. n. in regards to South East Asia or the Indian<br />
or Pacific Oceans that South Africa has got into in Africa.<br />
There is no basis for Australia being put in that way, and nobody<br />
should be under any impression that it is. So accordingly we<br />
support the attitude which is universally expressed in the<br />
Commonwealth and in the United Nations,<br />
QuesLion Apart from what's happened about chrome and New Zealand<br />
and the Tasm. an Sea. We recognise that history has been made<br />
in Tndo-China in the past week and that you. know more than we<br />
do that history has. been made and that you yourself have<br />
described the United States as the greatest military power in the<br />
world, has been forced to withdraw from that part of the world,<br />
You yourself have boasted that Australia has made a tremendous<br />
conLribution to the humanitarian aftermath of the Vietnam war,-<br />
Do you not think that there is not a terrific political vacuum<br />
there which you in Australia may be uniquely placed to fill.<br />
Having talks as you do have with President Ford in the United<br />
States in a few days time, do you see yourself as taking an<br />
initiative here to bring the nations of that part of the world..<br />
together to try to make political headway where there is a<br />
terrific political vacuum? / 13 </p>
<p>Prime Minister: No I wasn't wanting to boast of the huge<br />
humanitarian contribution that we have made. All that I was<br />
saying is that we have done more than others. 1. think there<br />
is room for Australia to do more than she has and for others<br />
to do more than they have. I am not thinking of taking any<br />
particular initiative or being cast in any such role. But I do<br />
believe that international organisations and various countries,<br />
preferably through international organisations, ought to.<br />
do something about reconciling and rehabilitating this country.<br />
It is quite tragic that of all the old colonies in South East Asia<br />
and in Southern Asia, Indo-China has had to wait so long for<br />
independence. There was no earthly reason why South Vietnam,<br />
Cambodia and Laos should be in so much worse a position than say,<br />
the Philippines, which was emancipated by the United States, I<br />
think in ' 46, India and Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Burma which were<br />
emancipated in ' 47, and Indonesia which was emancipated in ' 49<br />
had to put up a bit of a struggle to do so, but it was then Malay-v<br />
in ' 57 and then later on Sarawak, Sabah, Bangladesh with a<br />
terrific t. raurna in the case of Bangladesh all were able to<br />
get independence. But in Indo-China for nearly 30 years the<br />
