SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRESENTATION OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE BANNER<br />
THE LODGE 8 MARCH 1988<br />

I am happy to see this banner handed over to the women of<br />
Australia today.<br />
Its significance is far greater than its historical<br />
importance. It reminds us that Australian women have conducted a<br />
struggle for equality of opportunity over more than eight<br />
decades.<br />
And just as Australian women were in the forefront of the<br />
achievement of franchise rights in the first decade of this<br />
century, they are still trailblazing as we approach the<br />
twenty-first century.<br />
Because since the Suffrage march in 1908, for which this<br />
banner was painted, Australian women have continued marching<br />
in figurative and in literal terms.<br />
And if the women who marched in 1908 could see how far their<br />
cause has prcogressed today, I believe they could only be<br />
impressed. The women's movement is a story of progress from the margins<br />
to the mainstream from rejection to. acceptance as a<br />
legitimate and indeed an invaluable force for change and<br />
reform of Australian society.<br />
Australian women were trailblazers in their fight for social<br />
reform. They led the world by winning the right to vote in<br />
Federal elections in 1902.<br />
There was perhaps a lull in social reform for women after<br />
the Second World war that lasted until the 004900 </p>
<p>But when the Women's liberation movement did arrive, it came<br />
as an intense and sophisticated political movement.<br />
Since coming to power my Government has kept up the momentum<br />
of change. We are constantly developing policies and<br />
programs to help improve their st'atus in all spheres of<br />
society whether they choose to rlive and work in the home<br />
or to pursue a career in the paid workforce.<br />
only last week, I had the honour of launching the National<br />
Agenda for Women, which sets out the Government's<br />
achievements to date and our strategy for the future. It is<br />
the most detailed, practical and comprehensive strategy ever<br />
produced by an Australian government to achieve equality of<br />
opportunity in Australia.<br />
I believe it will be remembered as one of my Government's<br />
most important achievements. It further opens the way to a<br />
more adequate utilisation of the economic potential of<br />
women; and it represents as well a substantial demonstration<br />
of our commitment to fairness and equality of opportunity in<br />
our society.<br />
In preparing the National Agenda, this Government sought the<br />
views of Australian women to an unprecedented extent and we<br />
are responding, to an equally unprecedented degree, to their<br />
expressed needs.<br />
The National Agenda provides detailed action plans for the<br />
next five years and specific objectives to take us through<br />
to the end of the century.<br />
The National Women's Consultative Council played a large<br />
part in the National Agenda consultations, conducting<br />
meetings and inviting submissions.<br />
The Council is the Government's major means of consulting<br />
with Australian women. I take this opportunity to applaud<br />
the efforts of its members and to pay tribute to the<br />
tireless commitment of its cdnvenor Edith Hall.<br />
I believe that just as the women who marched in the Women's.<br />
Suffrage march Jp 1908 were part of' a movement that is a<br />
historical watershed for women so too will the National<br />
Agenda for Womenm be seen as an historical milestone for<br />
future Australians.<br />
This banner is a tangible symbol of the earier struggles for<br />
Suffrage. Today, it serves to remind us that while a great<br />
deal of progress has been made, much more still remains to<br />
be done. .1 it. 004901 </p>
