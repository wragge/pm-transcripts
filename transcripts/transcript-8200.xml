FOR MEDIA 16 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE<br />
QUEENSLAND PREMIER, WAYNE GOSS<br />
The three year campaign to protect Queensland's Wet<br />
Tropics World Heritage area culminated today in the<br />
signing of an agreement giving formal status to the<br />
management scheme for the Wet Tropics World Heritage<br />
Area. Following the election in Queensland in December last<br />
year we moved quickly to ensure the proper management and<br />
conservation of the area.<br />
We met in north Queensland in early March and exchanged<br />
letters of intent which affirmed the two Governments'<br />
cooperative approach to funding and management of this<br />
internationally significant area.<br />
Following this historic agreement a management scheme for<br />
the Wet Tropics was negotiated and established.<br />
The signing of the joint Commonwealth-State management<br />
arrangement today puts into effect a comprehensive scheme<br />
which ensures the protection and management of the area<br />
and ensures Australia maintains its international<br />
obligations under the World Heritage Convention.<br />
Because of the high level of cooperation, the Wet Tropics<br />
Ministerial Council and the Wet Tropics Management<br />
Authority had already been established and held their<br />
first meetings.<br />
Under the Wet Tropics Agreement, both Governments are<br />
committed to ongoing funding on a matching basis.<br />
A total of $ 11 million has been provided for management<br />
of the World Heritage Area by the Commonwealth and<br />
Queensland Governments this year.<br />
The agreement also commits the Queensland Government to<br />
the introduction of legislation to enable its<br />
implementation. The Wet Tropics Management Agency, charged with managing<br />
the area, will be established under new Queensland<br />
legislation and consist of approximately 10 professional<br />
coordination and planning staff. </p>
<p>2<br />
Queensland will be responsible for the day-to-day and<br />
on-ground management operations within the area.<br />
Queensland is in the unique position of having adjacent<br />
World Heritage Areas the Wet Tropics and the Great<br />
Barrier Reef and we are keen to see the two management<br />
authorities work together to present and protect these<br />
internationally significant and unique environmental<br />
sites. </p>
