. PRIME MINISTER WEDNESDAY, 7 NOVEMBER 1979<br />
From the Press Office<br />
SUMMARY OF ABC'S<br />
In the aftermath of the scrapping of the Federal Narcotics Bureau,<br />
a confidential document has been leaked which highlights the<br />
intense bureaucratic power play that has been so much a part of<br />
the battle between the Commonwealth Police, the State Police Forces<br />
and the Narcotics Bureau. The document is a defence by the<br />
Department of Business and Consumer. Affairs against the allegations<br />
made by Mr. Justice Williams in his Interim Royal Commission Report<br />
to the Federal Government.<br />
Julie Flynn<br />
* Defenders of the Narcotics Bureau a~ e particularly bitter<br />
at what they see as a set-up job to get rid of it. I understand<br />
that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs itself<br />
prepared a strong detailed defence of the allegations contained<br />
in the Interim Report. The Department requested that the defence<br />
be included as an appendix to the report when it was due to be<br />
released. But I understand that it wasn't. Rivalry between the<br />
Narcotics Bureau and the Commonwealth Police and to a lesser<br />
extent, State Police Forces, has been intense since the Bureau<br />
was set up in 1969 by the then Minister, Mr. Don Chipp. The former<br />
head of the Commonwealth Police, Mr. Davis, and the head of the<br />
Bureau, Mr. Bates, have waged a long-standing power battle, and<br />
while the Commonwealth Police has now been absorbed by the<br />
Australian Federal Police, it seems that the final victory belongs<br />
to Mr. Davis, who besides being an academic is now a special<br />
adviser on police matters to the Minister for Administrative<br />
Services, Mr. McLeay. I understand that in its defence, the<br />
Department said it was hardly surprising that the report recommended<br />
that the Bureau be disbanded, especially when seen against the<br />
background of the inquiry. It pointed out that in October 1977,,<br />
long before allegations against the Bureau surfaced, it offered<br />
to provide expert assistance to the inquiry, but that offer was<br />
rejected. In contrast, the Commonwealth Police had 16 of its<br />
officers attached on and off to the inquiry. The Department argued<br />
that it was on trial without any opportunity to refute the allegations.<br />
The situation had become so bad that it had been forced to hire<br />
senior counsel to protect its interests when giving evidence to<br />
the Commission. Furthermore, it noted that at no stage did the<br />
Commission why the Australia Federal Police would handle the<br />
responsibilities of the Bureau better, except to say that it was<br />
A larger body. The Department said that no alternatives were<br />
proposed or canvassed in the report, nor was an assessment made of<br />
the improvements that might be expected from such a transfer. It also<br />
said that it remains to be seen if the efficiency of the Federal<br />
Police will be any greater than that of Compol as evidenced in the<br />
Greek social security case. It questions whether the force could<br />
handle the additional responsibilities without additional resources.<br />
The document details a point by point comment on all the allegations<br />
against the Bureau. It says that allegations that there was<br />
distrust between it and other agencies should take into account<br />
the difference between distrust and jealousy and that the law<br />
enforcement working part was evidence that various forces co-operated<br />
and exchanged information regularly with the Bureau. And allegations<br />
that the judiciary, quote generally speaking, unquote, thought that<br />
the Bureau was less efficient than State forces was it said, not </p>
<p>-2<br />
supported by evidence from N. S. W. where most Bureau cases were<br />
heard. on the allegations that the Bureau's arrest and seizure<br />
record was indicitive that it was not doing its job properly,<br />
the Department said that this ignored the fact that most of its<br />
work was surveillance and that it often passed this on to State<br />
forces who then acted upon it. It said that allegations that the<br />
Department spent too much time defending itself were based on a<br />
paper by a bellicose young junior officer written eight years ago.<br />
It said that if it did have to defend itself, that was largely<br />
because of the Commission itself. on the allegations that the<br />
Department was inefficient, the document said that this was a<br />
subjective judgement and did not attempt to take into account the<br />
relative efficiency of other police forces. It is not known why<br />
the document was not included in the Interim Report, but supporters<br />
of the Department are angry that Ministers were not given the<br />
opportunity to hear their defence. The document raises some<br />
interesting questions about the Minister, Mr. Fife's role in the<br />
ultimate decision to disband the Bureau. Knowing that his Department<br />
had so strongly rejected the Commission's criticisms, it appears<br />
that Mr. Fife was either defeated in Cabinet or is in dispute with<br />
his Department.<br />
The role of the Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr. Fife, who is<br />
responsible for the administration of the Narcotics Bureau, camne<br />
under strong attack today in the Federal Parliament when the<br />
opposition launched a censure motion against him for what they<br />
alleged was his incompetent administration of the Bureau and what<br />
the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Hayden, claimed was a cover-up.<br />
Report from Geoff Duncan.<br />
It seems the criticism of the Federal Department of Business and<br />
Consumer Affairs is not limited to the activities of the Narcotics<br />
Bureau. Submissions to the Federal Royal Commission into Drugs<br />
have also made strong attacks on the administration of the Customs<br />
Bureau. The submissions claim that Customs has lost control<br />
of its law enforcement functions, particularly in the area of the<br />
importation of drugs. Interview with a number of senior customs<br />
officers who asked to remain anonymous.<br />
An interesting insight into the operations-of those involved in<br />
drug trafficking has come from an interview with Bruce Stewart,<br />
who is a former associate of a man now being held by British police<br />
who is facing charges of murder in connection-with a New Zealand-<br />
Australian drug syndicate: interview reported.<br />
Tonight Jimmy Carter is facing one of the greatest challenges of his<br />
Presidency with the news that Iran may be preparing to cut off all<br />
oil supplies to the U. S. CIA reports are saying that workers at<br />
Iran's only crude oil port have gone on strike in support of the<br />
Tehran students who overran the United States Embassy.<br />
Eight members of the Townsville Unemployed Worker's Union were<br />
arrested at noon today after refusing to leave the town'Is Department<br />
of Social Security office. They were charged under the Federal Public<br />
Order Protection of Persons and Property Act with disobeying a lawful<br />
order. 0 00---</p>
