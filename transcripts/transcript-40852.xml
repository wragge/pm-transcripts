    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, what’s the latest advice you have on the damage caused by this storm?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Chris, first can I say that the people of North Queensland are in the prayers and thoughts of all Australians. They’re experiencing a shocking cyclone, Tropical Cyclone Debbie, a Category Four downgraded to category three. But the people of Queensland are resilient and strong and we have put in place the biggest pre-deployment of the Australian Defence Force in advance of a natural disaster.</p>
<p>So we are working seamlessly with the Queensland emergency services. The Premier and I have been speaking, she’s acknowledged the teamwork that’s going on. We have Brigadier Chris Field who will be the Recovery Coordinator, Commander of Three Brigade in Townsville. So we’re working very closely together to ensure the people of North Queensland are supported as they recover from this storm.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Has there been any loss of life that you’re aware of?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We’re aware of one fatality, a car accident caused by strong winds. But at this stage it’s not possible to say how much damage has occurred. It’s a very dangerous storm, a very strong storm as you know. There will be damage. But we won’t be able to assess that until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>When you talk about the Defence Force, what kinds of things will the Defence Force do?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>They will provide engineers to restore infrastructure, roads. They’ll provide helicopters to deliver relief. HMAS Choules will be coming up into the region, steaming up to the area where the cyclone has hit. It has the ability to provide – again -helicopter support and also landing craft that are able to get access to areas that have been cut off, whether it’s in the Whitsundays or elsewhere are being cut off from communications because of the storm.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>The Brigadier that you mentioned has experience in disasters in Queensland?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, he has. Brigadier Field was the Chief of Operations in the recovery after the 2011 floods. So he was requested by the Queensland Premier and we’re very pleased to make him available to do this job.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Beyond what the Australian Defence Force is doing, the Government, the Commonwealth Government is also provided some emergency services personnel, experts in storm damage?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, we are providing all of our services across the board. Emergency service, emergency management, Centrelink and we’re also of course reaching out to insurance companies and banks, urging them to be compassionate, considerate and to support the people of North Queensland in the wake of this storm.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>That’s very often the things people worry about; as they see their home being blown away around them, or see rivers of water running through it, how the insurance companies will treat their claims. The difference between storm damage, as we know, is being debated ad nauseam.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>That’s right. That’s why the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer have been in touch with the banking and insurance sectors today, to ensure that they understand how important it is to the Government and indeed to all Australians, that the banks and insurance companies are seen to be very supportive and responsive, compassionate, considerate, flexible in making sure that claims are met. That businesses are supported. The ATO of course will be doing the same in terms of the way it deals with its clients. So right across the board, we are bringing everything, every wing of the national Government, our Government, working with the state Government, to support the people of North Queensland.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>So what is your message to the people of North Queensland tonight, who are still living through a terrifying ordeal?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Stay safe. Stay indoors. Follow the advice of the emergency authorities. Follow their advice. Don’t attempt to go through floodwaters. If it’s flooded, forget it. Stay safe, keep an eye out for your neighbors and your friends. Make sure above all that you follow the advice of the authorities.</p>
<p>All too often, as we know, people get into trouble in the wake of a storm, by getting into floodwaters, by taking risks that they shouldn’t. This is a time to listen very carefully to the authorities. They have your best interests at heart. They understand the situation. Follow their advice and you’ll be safe.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, thank you.</p>
