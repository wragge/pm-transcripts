SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S DEATH PENALTY POSTER<br />
CANBERRA 6 DECEMBER 1989<br />
I am proud to be associated with the celebrations this week<br />
of Human Rights week and with the launch of this poster<br />
against the death penalty, just as I am proud to be a patron<br />
of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group. This<br />
poster we are launching today bears the signatures of the<br />
Governor-General, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the<br />
Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats. So<br />
it provides clear evidence of Australia's commitment to this<br />
most important campaign against the death penalty.<br />
The campaign to abolish capital punishment has gained an<br />
extraordinary momentum since the Second World War. In 1948<br />
during Doc Evatt's Presidency of the UN General Assemblythe<br />
international community expressed its deepest values in<br />
the form of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which<br />
states that<br />
" Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security<br />
of person."<br />
In 1966, the UN adopted the International Covenant on Civil<br />
and Political Rights, the preamble of which sets out that<br />
" frecognition of the inherent dignity and inalienable<br />
rights of all members of the human family is the<br />
foundation of freedom, justice and peace"<br />
Article 6, which deals with the death penalty, declares that<br />
" Every human being has the inherent right to life.<br />
This right shall. be protected by law. No one shall be<br />
arbitrarily deprived of-his life".<br />
Those beliefs that humans have an inherent dignity and an<br />
inherent right to life have been behind all opposition to<br />
the death penalty. And the International Covenant has had<br />
an important role in leading more and more countries to<br />
abolition. I </p>
<p>Australia ratified the Covenant in 1973, under the Whitlam<br />
Government, thus abolishing the death penalty for all<br />
offences. There are now 35 totally abolitionist countries<br />
around the world.<br />
The launch of this Amnesty International poster coincides<br />
with a further significant step in the international<br />
campaign against the death penalty: the debate in the UN<br />
General Assembly which will lead we hope to the adoption<br />
late this week of the Second Optional Protocol to the<br />
Covenant. Countries which become party to this Protocol formally<br />
indicate the abolition of the death penalty within their<br />
jurisdiction. So it is another step down the path to total<br />
abolition, and I would like to commend the Federal Republic<br />
of Germany which first proposed it at the General Assembly<br />
in 1980, and all the Australian officials and<br />
representatives of non-government organisations, especially<br />
Amnesty International, which have worked so hard for its<br />
adoption this week.<br />
Of course changes to statutes and to international<br />
conventions only reflect changes in the attitudes of men and<br />
women around the world. Our task is to raise public<br />
awareness of the compelling arguments against the death<br />
penalty, until it is abolished in every country. I can<br />
assure you that my Government will continue to raise the<br />
issue of capital punishment with countries where it is still<br />
practised, as well as working at a multilateral level to<br />
secure adherence to the ICCPR and its Second Optional<br />
Protocol. My own view is that the taking of life as a punishment<br />
cannot in any circumstances be justified. I reject the<br />
implied infallibility of a legal system that claims the<br />
capacity to take a life on the basis of its finding of<br />
guilt. And I reject the bleak vision of human nature that<br />
sees the death penalty as appropriate punishment. The death<br />
penalty allows no possibility of legal error and offers no<br />
hope of personal rehabilitation.<br />
So in the battle for hearts and minds, it is my profound<br />
hope that the campaign to abolish the death penalty will<br />
attract ever-increasing support, including through the<br />
publicity given to it by Amnesty during Human Rights Week.<br />
You can be assured of my strong support for this campaign<br />
and of my hope that it will succeed.<br />
