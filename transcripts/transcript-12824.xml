As we leave behind our Centenary of Federation year and enter a second century of Australian nationhood, Australians are going forward with a renewed sense of pride in their country';s accomplishments, a greater awareness of the energy and enthusiasm that animates its citizens and a keener appreciation of the opportunities that lie before us all.<br />
Certainly, as I have travelled throughout the country - in our major cities, in regional centres and in the bush where so many elements of our national character were forged â I have been struck by the great confidence that Australians have in their own and their nation';s innate abilities. I am buoyed by a sense of optimism that exists towards our future and the heartfelt conviction that we have the means and the will to meet the challenges ahead. I enter the new year with the indelible impression of a people enthusiastic to prove themselves equal to any task and build for themselves and their children, lives of prosperity, peace and boundless possibility.<br />
This sense of self confidence, although a traditional Australian trait, has been renewed over the past year. The Federation celebrations â most of which were undertaken at local community level â revealed for all Australians the strength of the foundations of this remarkable nation. They imparted an understanding, particularly to young Australians, that the much-admired attributes of our forebears still reside within contemporary Australian society in full measure. In looking back, we have gained added momentum as we move forward.<br />
Equally, if adversity is a mirror through which an individual';s or a nation';s true character is reflected, then Australia';s unreserved commitment to battle terrorism has signalled to the world that the concepts of justice, of decency and of selfless service remain entrenched within the Australian ethos. In the efforts of firefighters, in the continued service of our military personnel in East Timor and throughout the world, and in the work of Australian aid agency staff to relieve suffering and starvation, we see the real strength of this nation. Concepts such as mateship, loyalty and self sacrifice have been proved to be more than mere words - they are being given form and substance by men and women committed to better the lives of others.<br />
However, these values and these virtues are not only apparent when disaster strikes at home or in trouble spots abroad. In the more tranquil waters of every day life, Australians are displaying the Australian spirit and living up to the high standards of decency and hard work they have set for themselves.<br />
The success of Australia';s small business sector â the driver of an Australian economy considered amongst the strongest in the world â is the result of people willing to take responsibility for themselves, their families and, given the vital role small businesses play in every local neighbourhood, their communities. It remains based on men and women willing to have a go.<br />
We see it in the commitment of Australians who are striving to buy their own homes, providing their children with comfort and security. We see it within regional communities who are energetically rebuilding their towns and seizing new opportunities for trade, growth and employment. We see it in the efforts of older Australians who continue to contribute to the cohesion and richness of their communities. It';s apparent in the genuine goodwill of those working for true reconciliation and the building of self reliant and fulfilling lives for all indigenous Australians.<br />
Australia Day is a time for reflection and pride. It is also a time for anticipation and resolve. I have no doubt that the year 2002 will see Australians step forward with confidence and purpose, determined to succeed in endeavours as diverse and remarkable as their country is itself. </p>
