    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was greatly saddened to hear of the death this afternoon of the former Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Keizo Obuchi.</p>
<p>In addition to his life-long commitment to Japanese public life and his service to the Japanese people, Mr Obuchi will be remembered for the significant contribution he made as Prime Minister to improving economic management in Japan and to the reform of the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>I was privileged to meet Mr Obuchi on a number of occasions.  In particular, I remember the warmth of the welcome and the hospitality Mr Obuchi extended to my wife and to me during my visit to Japan last year.</p>
<p>Our thoughts - and those of all Australians - are with his family and with  Prime Minister Mori and the Japanese Government on this sad occasion.</p>
