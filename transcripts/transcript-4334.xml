ADDRESS TO QUEENSLAND CANEGROWERS COUNCIL 28 FEBRUARY 1977<br />
It is a pleasure to be here today to open the Fiftieth Annual Conference<br />
of your Council. The industry you represent has a long record of<br />
sustained progress of which you must be properly proud. Over the fifty<br />
years your Council has existed, the Australian sugar industry's<br />
production has grown more than six-fold. It now exceeds three million<br />
tonnes a year.<br />
The domestic market has made an important contribution to this growth<br />
but the primary factor has been your successful penetration of world<br />
markets where competition has been strong and conditions have been<br />
subject to many and sudden changes. Many commodity markets are subject<br />
to sharp price movements and to the introduction of substitute<br />
products. In your -case, you also deal in a product that can be produced in numerous<br />
parts of the world under widely different climatic conditions. You<br />
have had the energy and skills to overcome these difficulties and to<br />
capture a large export market. Your negotiation of long term export<br />
contracts at stable prices with major purchasers was a notable step<br />
towards establishing a firm and reasonable foundation for in., vestment<br />
and production plans.<br />
The Government is alert to the importance of the industry, -and to<br />
Australia, of these contracts with Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
We have demonstrated our concern and willingness to provide appropriate<br />
support for the industry whenever the question of renegotiation of<br />
any contracts has arisen.<br />
When I was in Japan in June last year, I discussed the long term sugar<br />
contract with Mr Abe, the then Japanese minister for Agriculture and<br />
Forestry. I drew his attention to the deferment of shipments to which<br />
the Australian industry had agreed in an endeavour to ensure the<br />
smooth operation of the contract.<br />
I know that discussions between Australian and overseas commercial<br />
interests regarding the operation of the various contracts have taken<br />
place and are continuing. My Government's objective is to ensure that<br />
at all times the Australian commercial negotiators receive adequate<br />
advice and assistance from the Government. .22/ </p>
<p>from the Government./ 2<br />
The Government has made it clear that, although it is not a party<br />
to the contracts and believes that the matters at issue should be<br />
resolved commercially without Government intervention, it will follow<br />
the negotiations closely.<br />
We will continue to provide appropriate support and assistance to the<br />
industry and to the efforts of C. S. R. Limited to foster the long term<br />
continuity on fair terms of these commercial arrangements. Firm long<br />
term contracts between producers and the consumers are desirable, and<br />
to be encouraged.<br />
In addition however, as the recent volatility of the world sugar market<br />
has once again highlighted, there i5 a need for cooperative and<br />
workable solutions to the problems of producing and consuming nations.<br />
Negotiations are now scheduled for a new agreement to replace the 1968<br />
International Sugar Agreement.<br />
In these discussions, there will be close cooperation between the<br />
Queensland Government, the Australian sugar industry, and the Commonwealth<br />
Government. The industry has shown before that it can cope with short<br />
term downward swings in sugar prices. And that such movements do not<br />
undermine your confidence and ingenuity in finding new and growing<br />
markets. I have no doubt that your industry will continue to maintain its<br />
contribution to the development of Queensland and Australia, and it<br />
is a very valuable contribution. Your 1976 export earnings of some<br />
$ 600 million made a substantial contribution to our export earnings<br />
as a nation and placed Australia mong the top three sugar earning<br />
countries. In terms of productive value, sugar ranks first among Queensland's<br />
rural industries. Over seven thousand producers rely on the production<br />
of sugar cane as their main source of income. Approximately two<br />
hundred thousand people directly depend upon the sugar industry for<br />
their livelihood.<br />
The expansion of the sugar industry has done much to provide employment<br />
opportunities away from the big cities and underpin the growth of<br />
regional towns. Between 1971 and 1976 Mackay's population grew by<br />
14.3%. Cairns by 21.8%. Bundaberg by 20%, and Townsville 19.5%.<br />
By comparison, Sydney and Melbourne grew by 2.9% and 4.1% respectively.<br />
-2-</p>
<p>respectively. This trend towards a better balance in our national development is<br />
to be welcomed. The Coalition Government recognises the importance<br />
of the ru.~ ral industry to Australia, the close inter-dependence<br />
between city and country. We also recognise the difficult situation'<br />
many rural1 producers have been facing.<br />
We recogn~ ise the fact that rural producers have been caught in the<br />
vice of sharply rising costs on the onehand, and often severe<br />
marketing difficulties and depressed world prices for their products<br />
on the other. We recognise the fact that in the three years between<br />
1972/ 73 and 1975/ 76 prices paid by rural producers rose by<br />
whereas prices received rose by only 7%.<br />
We recognise the fact that adverse seasonal conditions have often<br />
seriously aggravated these problems. The Labor Government resolutely<br />
refused to face these facts.<br />
You all remember that their " Rural Policy" was a policy to attack the<br />
rural sector on all fronts. You remember the Coombs Task Force;<br />
the abol-Ition of the superphosphate bounty; the attempt to reduce<br />
the wool reserve price by 20%. You all remember Mr Whitlam<br />
telling a rural audience in 1974: " You never had it so good".<br />
The Coalition Government has adopted policies towards the rural<br />
community in stark contrast to Labor's hostility. Our policies are<br />
designed to assist the rural sector maintain the productive activities<br />
which are so important for the well-being of all Australians.<br />
We have taken a substantial number of specific initiatives to aid<br />
particular rural industries. And I would briefly like to mention the<br />
measures we have taken to assist other important rural industries,<br />
in particular wool, beef, and wheat which, together with your own<br />
sugar ind. ustry constitute the backbone of Queensland's rural strength.<br />
For the 1.976/ 77 season for wool, the Government initially guaranteed<br />
a minimumt reserve price of 234 cents per kilogram clean clip average,<br />
a rise of' 14%. We also undertook to retain not less than such minimum<br />
price throughout the 1977/ 78 season. After the devaluation in November,<br />
the minimium reserve price was raised to 284 cents to give growers the<br />
full benEfit of devaluation. J </p>
<p>benefit of devaluation.!<br />
There has been continued strength in the wool market and the<br />
present price of 322 cents is well above the reserve price.<br />
The beef industry has been facing extremely difficult times.<br />
The plight of many beef growers is recognised by the<br />
Government in its provision in the last budget of a further<br />
million to be made available for carryon loan assistance to<br />
be jointly financed with the States.<br />
Conditions of these loans have been liberalised to enable producers<br />
who-. had already obtained finance to apply once again.<br />
The Government has also suspended the meat export inspection charge<br />
and is contributing in excess of $ 10 million for the tuberculosis<br />
and brucellosis eradication campaign. The best indicators -For<br />
future prosperity in this industry Are the prospects for 7rreater<br />
m-arket access, ? articula-rly to<br />
Japan, the USA, the EEC, the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.<br />
The recent Australia/ Japan ministerial Committee Meeting in Tokyo<br />
resulted in a supplementary global quota of 15,000 tonnes for<br />
the second half of this fiscal year; a special additional quota<br />
of 5,000 tonnes boiled beef and beef ro Japan's school lunch<br />
programme; an undertaking by the Japanese officials to endeavour<br />
t o announce the quota for the next six months as soon as possible<br />
after 1st April.<br />
Negotiations have also led to an increase of 9,000 tonnes in<br />
our entitlement in the US. market for 1977, and probable shipments<br />
of about 70,000 tonnes of beef to the Soviet Union.<br />
It is expected that the'meat board will soon announce a 15,000<br />
tonne order to Egypt and the possibilities are that-this will be<br />
the fore*-runner of a long-term arrangement. Tepossibility!<br />
this year are for record meat sales and the abbatoirs will be<br />
at or near full capacity. Wheat growers have had a less difficult<br />
period, although total production this year will be slightly down.<br />
The first advance on wheat for 1976/ 77 has been increa sed 20% to $ 66<br />
per tonne. The home consumption price for wheat has been increased<br />
by $ 6 per tonne. General initiatives benefitting all primary<br />
producers have also been taken by this Government. </p>
<p>this Government./ The Income Equalisation Deposit<br />
' Scheme supplements the existing tax averaging arrangements. It should<br />
greatly assist primary producers in providing a flexible method of<br />
evening-out fluctuations in farm incomes. It will place them in a<br />
better position to withstand natural disasters and unusually poor<br />
returns. It can be particularly helpful when a producer receives<br />
an abnormally high income from forced sales and insurance proceeds<br />
arising from a natural disaster.<br />
Despite the fact that the Scheme was recommended by the I. A. C.,<br />
Mr Whitlam denounced the Scheme in the Parliament a couple of weeks<br />
ago as the " latest lurk for Pitt and Collins Street farmers".<br />
The Labor Party's hostility towards the rural community has not been<br />
altered ' by its period in Opposition.<br />
The other recommendations of the I. A. C. regarding the averaging of<br />
incomes have not been rejected by the Government and remain under<br />
consideration. A new rural adjustment scheme has been introduced<br />
in cooperation with the ' States. This new scheme replaces a variety<br />
of earlier schemes and like the Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme<br />
it is based on I. A. C. recommendations and will apply to all rural<br />
industries. We have reintroduced the superphosphate bounty. In the case of the<br />
subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers, we have accepted the I. A. C. report<br />
in principle, but a decision has not been taken as to the rate of<br />
subsidy to apply from the end of this year.<br />
Devaluation will, of course, also be of great assistance to the<br />
primary producer. Our competitive position in world markets where<br />
over hal~ f our rural products are sold should be improved. Rural<br />
producers incomes should be boosted.<br />
We are currently proceeding with plans for the establishment Of<br />
a national rural bank. The purpose of this new institution will be<br />
to provide long term finance and specialist services to thE! rural<br />
community. Other taxation reforms which have been introduced will<br />
yield benefits to primary producers as well as to income ea~ rners<br />
gene rally. </p>
<p>earners generally./-6<br />
Indexation of personal income tax is a major ' reform, designed to ensure<br />
that the tax take will not rise automatically as the result of<br />
inflation alone. All taxpayers will benefit; and the revenue foregone<br />
this financial year will total about $ 990 million. Next year, the<br />
amount of tax foregone by the Government is estimated at $ 1050 million.<br />
Investment allowances have been introduced to help lift private<br />
investment'from its depressed levels. Next financial year, the tax<br />
savings to the private sector from this concession are expected to<br />
reach $ 550 million. Farmers will share in these benefits. The<br />
requirements covering the distribution of profits by private companies<br />
have been eased. This will relieve the tax burden on small businesses<br />
which are of great importance in the Australian economy.<br />
Estate duty relief has been introduced in cases where an interest<br />
in an estate passes to a surviving spouse.<br />
Actions demonstrate clearly the Government's willingness to<br />
act quickly and decisively to assist the great rural industries to<br />
maintain their viability and continued growth in our economy.<br />
But the most important thing we can do for rural producers and all<br />
other Australians is to defeat inflation, so that we can have a full<br />
return to economic prosperity.<br />
During 1976 considerable progress was made towards the Government's<br />
three year goal of bringing Australia's economic problems under control.<br />
The strategy we have pursued since being elected is based on the<br />
fundamental recognition that renewed economic growth could occur only<br />
if an environment was created in which the private sector would<br />
emerge with higher levels of production, profits, investment and hence<br />
employment opportunities. Fundamental to that is the control of<br />
inflation. The revival of the private sector also required measures aimed directly<br />
at restoring incentives in the private sector and cutting back on<br />
the growth of government. We have carried through that strategy and<br />
we have already begun to see its fruits.<br />
-6-</p>
<p>see its fruits./<br />
A considerable winding down in the underlying rate of inflation<br />
was achieved during 1976. This was apparent in a number of<br />
important indexes. For instance, in the first three quarters of<br />
1976 the deflator for the major components of gross national<br />
expenditure the sum of all domestic final expenditure, private<br />
and government rose by 2.7% and 2.2% respectively.<br />
I mention these indicators of inflation because much emphasis<br />
sometimes too much is understandably placed on movements in the<br />
C. P. I. as the measure of inflation. In fact of course, that index<br />
merely records price movements for a specifically confined set of<br />
goods and services. Despite the limitations of the its<br />
recent: movement viewed in their proper perspective, confirm other<br />
signs of a marked downward trend in inflation during 1976.<br />
The effect on the C. P. I. of such once-for-all influences as the<br />
health insurance changes have nothing to do with underlyi. ng inflationa."<br />
pressures in the economy. For instance, in t1e second half of 1975<br />
underlying inflationary pressures were great. J<br />
But in the September quarter of 1975 the CPI rose by only it was<br />
artifically depressed by. the introduction of Medibank and was an<br />
inaccurate reflection of basic inflationary forces. This is<br />
demonstrated by the fact that the 1975 December quarter CPI rose<br />
to The most recent December quarter index rise must be<br />
discounted for the effects of changes in health insurance<br />
arrangements. Once this adjustment is made, the CPI increase is<br />
well below the 6.3% increase recorded in the December<br />
quarter of 1975.<br />
The Y: aizi f5act ia that inflation in the second half of 1976<br />
was running at an annual rate some 4 percentage points or more lower<br />
than in the second half of 1975. The C. P. I. figures, adjusted as I<br />
have described, were 10.2% in 1976 and 14.3% in 1975. Whichever way<br />
one looks at the figures, a broadly similar conclusion emerges.<br />
-7-</p>
<p>conclusion emerges<br />
Considerable progress has been made in the fight against inflation.<br />
That there is justification for adjusting the C. P. I. for Medibank<br />
effects is borne out by the deflator for major components of G. N. E.<br />
This broadly based measure of price change automatically adjusts<br />
for Medibank effects. It makes this adjustment because inherent<br />
in its construction is the plain fact that the community must always<br />
pay in one way or another for its health care. Health services did<br />
not suddenly become free on 1 July 1975; nor did they suddenly become<br />
more costly to the community on account of the charges effected on<br />
1 October 1976.<br />
Any rational assessment of the C. P. I. and other indicators of inflation<br />
underlines the progress that was made in the fight against inflation<br />
in 1976.<br />
In other respects too, the economic environment has improved.<br />
The distortions which developed to key economic relationships<br />
during 1974/ 75 began to be corrected during 1976. There has been a<br />
recovery in business profitability.<br />
In the September quarter of 1976 company profits were up 39.4% on a<br />
year earlier. This partial climb bank from the extremely depressed<br />
level to which profits were driven in 1974 and. 1975 is central to the<br />
revival of business confidence; business investment; and, of course,<br />
the creation of new job opportunities.<br />
On the activity front, aggregate expenditures and national production<br />
began to grow again in 1976. Most striking has been the -provisional 7.5% ri.-<br />
in real gross non-farm product between the December quarter of 1975<br />
and the September quarter of 1976. I<br />
-8-</p>
<p>September quarter of 1976.<br />
' A most impressive but little appreciated feature of the growth recorded<br />
in 1976 is that it occurred despite a reduced level of real government<br />
spending. The momentum for growth lay entirely in the private sector.<br />
The growith in demand and production has not yet been translated into<br />
a decline in unemployment. As in the early stages of past recoveries<br />
employers have begun by making fuller use of their existing workforce.,<br />
At today's much higher levels of wage and salary costs, there is an<br />
even stronger incentive than before for employers to seek out<br />
every alt~ ernative means of increasing output before hiring additional<br />
fulltime workers.<br />
The gover~ nment's objective is to get people back into jobs. We are<br />
particularly concerned at unemployment amongst youth and have initiated<br />
a number of innovative schemes to deal with this problem. But<br />
ultimately, the speed with which unemployment is reduced depends on<br />
the degree in wage restraint that is achieved in the course of the<br />
year. In your own State, the signs Of ecOnQ-X-. c -eccYjery are encoir', ac* in-. It appears the<br />
building industry is now sharing in the strong recovery in dwelling<br />
construction activity since 1975.<br />
The buoyant levels of new motor vehicles registration for the second<br />
half of 1L976 suggest that Queensland has shared in the strengthening<br />
of consumption evident for Australia as a whole. In the year to<br />
January .1977 registrations were 13% higher than the previous year.<br />
The corresponding national figure was 2.6%.<br />
Civilian employment in Queensland increased by 3,200 between NOvember<br />
1975 and November 1976. Although this has not been sufficient to<br />
bring about a decline in unemployment, it compares with no change in<br />
employment over the year to June 1976.<br />
As well there has been a recent intensification of planning<br />
activity in the area of natural resource projects in Queensland which will<br />
be of great importance to Queensland and Australia in the<br />
years ahead. Devaluation ahas clearly strengthened the planning<br />
basis for projects of this kind. Some of the largest projected<br />
developmrents are in the coal industry. Projects such as the<br />
Collinsville Project; the proposed expansion of operations at<br />
Blackwater; and the vast Norwich Park, Hail Creek and Nebo projects<br />
in central Queensland will, hopefully, proceed in the years ahead </p>
<p>years ahead,/<br />
resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars and perhaps<br />
as much as a billion dollars being invested in mineral development<br />
in Queensland.<br />
Development of mineral resources, of course, is not something that<br />
can be turned on quickly. The government recognises this fact<br />
and has done a great deal to restore the incentive for exploration.<br />
In this context I must stress that the benefit of devaluation in the<br />
form of increased private investment in natural resource based projects<br />
and in manufacturing, will accrue only after a time lag. You will<br />
readily understand that it takes-time for the businessman to capture<br />
new markets and to plan and implement new investments.<br />
on coming to Government, we made savings of over 000 million<br />
Gopenemdnn g his year we have announced savings<br />
of $ 250 million in the current financial year. And we have<br />
committed ourselves to keeping outlays for 1977/ 78 to within<br />
zero real growth. These decisions are designed to reduce the<br />
deficit and provide the maximum room for income tax reform.<br />
We have already made personal income tax reforms which will amount<br />
to $ 990 million in 1976/ 77 and $ 1050 million in 1977/ 78.<br />
Those that call for immediate reductions in taxation ignore the<br />
magnitude of our tax reforms to date, and they gloss over the fact<br />
that the consequences of tax cuts now would have to be futher<br />
large cuts in government spending which no one has advocated or<br />
further government loan raisings which would involve a significant<br />
increase in interest rates, or a bigger deficit and the printing<br />
of more money which would be disastrous. Our commitment to carry<br />
through tax reforms clear, and so is the significance of the steps<br />
we have already taken. Although tax cuts are inappropriate at<br />
this time we are committed to having further tax reforms when it<br />
is responsible to do so. In this context, the government will be<br />
monitoring the wage situation closely in addition to its<br />
continuing search for economies in the expenditure. Evidence of<br />
a significant moderation in the rate of wage increases would be<br />
an important ore--condition for any further revisions in taxation. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
We have been using all the instruments within our power<br />
monetary policy, budgetary policy, and external policy to the<br />
fullest extent possible in bear down on inflation.<br />
In budgetary policy wehave made the major savings mentioned<br />
earlier. In monetary policy we have moved to prevent excessive<br />
easing in monetary conditions which would be accommodating to<br />
inflation. And the exchange rate is right.<br />
Moreover, -hrough tax indexation and the family allowance scheme,<br />
we established the situation where the community and the rank<br />
and rile trade unionists have accepted wage restraint.<br />
The Government does not however have direct power in respect of<br />
wages and salaries. It is the Arbitration Commission which has<br />
this power, and with this power, a large responsibility. A<br />
responsibility not only for resolving industrial disputes but<br />
for the health of the Australian economy.<br />
Nothing would more quickly and surely undermine the economic<br />
progress which has been made than a flow on of the full six<br />
percent December CPI increase into wages. This would increase<br />
inflation, this would increase unemployment, it would erode the<br />
benefits of devaluation the increased investment, the more<br />
healthy growth and increased job opportunities.<br />
I believe that the community and rank and file unionists<br />
accept the need for wage restraint. Since the end of 1975<br />
we have made considerable economic progress. We intend to make<br />
further progress in fighting inflation and unemployment through 1977.<br />
