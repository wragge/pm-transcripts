    <content><![CDATA[<p>Her Majesty the Queen has accepted my recommendation that Her Excellency Professor The Honourable Marie Bashir AC CVO be awarded Australiaâs highest honour, Dame in the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>This honour recognises a lifetime of achievement for Dame Marie in the fields of psychiatry, tertiary education, indigenous issues, public administration and as the Governor of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Her Excellency has brought warmth, compassion and grace to Australia's oldest public office.</p>
<p>She has been an advocate for the disadvantaged and marginalised in the community, particularly those with mental illness.</p>
<p>Her contribution has also lifted the quality of health care in the Asia Pacific region, training and inspiring many medical practitioners to provide life changing health care to so many.</p>
<p>She has given dedicated service as Chancellor of the University of Sydney and is patron to more than 370 organisations.</p>
<p>Dame Marie is currently the longest serving Vice-Regal representative in Australia and has served as Administrator of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia during absences of the Governor-General.</p>
<p>Her term as Governor of New South Wales ends in October 2014.</p>
<p>Along with her husband Sir Nicholas Shehadie AC OBE, I am sure she will continue to make a positive contribution to Australian public life.</p>
<p>9 June 2014</p>
