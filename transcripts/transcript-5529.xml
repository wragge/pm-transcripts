PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIAWEDNESDAY, MARCH 4 1981<br />
AUSTRALIA/ NEW ZEALAND AIR PASSENGERS<br />
-RELI9F FLIGHTS<br />
With the completion of the last emergency relief flight<br />
between Australia and New Zealand today, I would like to pay<br />
tribute to the Air Force personnel and all others associat , ed<br />
with the exercise, whc worked hard and long hours to see it<br />
* through successfully.<br />
They have good reason to be well satisfied with their work.<br />
All Australians have reason to congratulate the RAAF and the<br />
RNZAF on a job well done.<br />
* The Australian Government also appr; eciatss -he ready co-operation<br />
of the New Zealand Government in mounting and seeing through<br />
this exercise to bring home stranded Australians and New Zealanders.<br />
They would have faced long delays and hardships because of<br />
strikes in both countries.<br />
When the last RAAF emergency relief flight leaves at 5pm AEST<br />
today, the airlift of stranded passengers will close down on<br />
both sides of the Tasman.<br />
-The-backlog of passengers has been largely shifted from Austra: lia<br />
and from New Zealand. It is expected that available commnercial<br />
flights will be able to handle any remaining movements. In the<br />
course of the exercise the Royal Australian Air Force flew 27<br />
' round flights and moved almost 3,300 passengers across the Tasman.-<br />
