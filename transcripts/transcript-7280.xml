PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL MIDNIGHT 25 JANUARY 1988<br />
Today, all around this vast country, from shore to shore and<br />
across the many miles between, Australians are celebrating<br />
our most momentous anniversary -two hundred years of<br />
European settlement.<br />
Australia Day is a focus in our Bicentennial Year when, as<br />
well as celebrating our present achievements, we can<br />
remember the past and what we owe to the people who have<br />
been before us the Aboriginals who have lived on this<br />
continent for some 40,000 years those who settled<br />
Australia in 1788 and those who have made Australia the<br />
home of their choice since then.<br />
we are members of a diverse, multicultural society where<br />
every person adds his or her own unique contribution to the<br />
rich fabric of our lifestyle. One thing and one thing only<br />
defines an Australian today and that is a commitment to<br />
Australia and its future.<br />
The world has seen that Australians are a people of great<br />
courage and determination who are unafraid of meeting a<br />
challenge. We can all feel proud of our country, for<br />
whether it is in matters of domestic economy, in the<br />
international arena, the arts, science, medicine, or on the<br />
sports field, we have proved time and again that Australians<br />
are achievers.<br />
Today's celebration is one of a host of festivities during<br />
our Bicentennial Year and we will have many occasions to<br />
stop and reflect on ourselves and our country.<br />
It is important that we should all make a point on this very<br />
special Australia Day to remind ourselves that we live in a<br />
wonderful country, and to ask ourselves how each and every<br />
one of us can contribute to its future. Australia's<br />
successful progress into the twenty first century depends so<br />
much on the efforts of every single Australian, regardless<br />
of our origins, wherever we live.<br />
Join me in celebrating Australia Day. 004088 </p>
