TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JULES RETRO, ABC RADIO 7ZR, HOBART,<br />
JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JR: Prime Minister Paul Keating welcome to Tasmania.<br />
PM: Thank you Jules.<br />
JR: You finally made it after the Budget.<br />
PM: Well, generally, after each Budget we try and do the rounds and I am<br />
glad to be here again.<br />
JR: Okay can I talk to you briefly about the topic of the moment, the<br />
announcement by the French that they are resuming nuclear testing in<br />
the Pacific? It is a pretty big poke in the eye for us, isn't it? I mean<br />
there has been uproar, there is outrage. I saw Acting Foreign Minister<br />
Senator Bob McMullan on ABC Television's " 7.30 Report" last night,<br />
in effect throwing up his hands and saying look, you know, there is not<br />
much we can do. We can complain officially and loudly, but that is<br />
about it. Would you go along with ACTU President Martin Ferguson's<br />
suggestion that we, as Australians, boycott any and all French<br />
products?<br />
PM: Well I think he made the point which I agree with if Australians wish to<br />
do that, that is a very tangible way of showing their contempt for the<br />
path that France has chosen. I mean for the Government's part we<br />
have said that we condemn the decision, that we deplore it and I made<br />
clear today that that is our position and also announced that we have<br />
consulted with the nations of the South Pacific through the<br />
South Pacific Forum and that we will be sending a delegation to<br />
France of South Pacific Forum countries, lead by Senator Evans, to<br />
express our condemnation and to urge the French Government to<br />
desist from these tests. </p>
<p>JR: Well we are not alone there of course. There are many other<br />
countries doing that. But you would then throw your weight and<br />
influence behind that call by Martin Ferguson?<br />
PM: Well I think it is a matter of, as I say, if people genuinely feel or they<br />
feel for genuine reasons that they believe that they shouldn't be<br />
buying French goods, well that I think is a tangible, useful expression<br />
of their rejection of this. I think from the Government's point of view, as<br />
you know, we have had this battle with France running now for many,<br />
many years over this issue. We were very pleased when Francois<br />
Mitterand suspended testing a couple of years ago. I think the only<br />
and important solace to take from this is that President Chirac has said<br />
that France will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which<br />
should be completed no later than 1996. Now I think the rest of the<br />
world, given that France is a nuclear power, will want to hold France to<br />
that commitment because that is the commitment that matters because<br />
there are a lot of problems now in the world. The Nuclear Nonproliferation<br />
Treaty was far more effective than most people thought it<br />
would be when it was signed in the 1970s. But since the decline of the<br />
old Soviet Union, or the disbandment of it, with a lot of nuclear material<br />
laying about, with these very old and badly supervised power stations<br />
in the Ukraine, the Soviet high seas fleet now rusting away in various<br />
ports with their nuclear materials degrading, all of these things, it is<br />
important that they be brought under a Comprehensive Treaty to see<br />
that there isn't the illegal transfer of nuclear materials. Getting<br />
France's commitment to that is going to be important. So the President<br />
of France has said that this would be an eight test program and then<br />
they will sign up. I think the signing up is going to be important. It is a<br />
very bad call by France to have the tests in the first place. I think this<br />
is very much the Gaullist view, you know, ' we have to protect France'.<br />
The way to protect France is basically to engage it with the rest of<br />
world, with the rest of Europe, in these things like Australia does<br />
chemical weapons treaties, nuclear and non-proliferation and not to<br />
try and develop more sophisticated weapons.<br />
JR: I would like to talk to you briefly about the Republic and the issues<br />
surrounding that. It is a week now, just over a week, since you<br />
delivered your preferred model for the Republic speech. All sorts of<br />
people have now declared their position. The word inevitability has<br />
been mentioned by Liberal Premiers. John Howard has..<br />
PM: Well he declared his position too for the Monarchy.<br />
JR: from possible to probable.<br />
PM: No, he sort of lined up and said I still believe that the current system is<br />
the best.<br />
JR: Okay, but lots of other people have leaned in your direction, you might<br />
say. Are you surprised at the momentum that has been generated in<br />
that past week and would you, had you known how things would pan<br />
out this week, have altered the content of your speech last week? </p>
<p>PM: Well let me answer the second question first. No I wouldn't have.<br />
I think that the model that the Government has chosen and set as its<br />
preferred model, that is of a head of state, a President, chosen by a<br />
majority of two-thirds of House of Representatives and the Senate<br />
sitting in a joint session, but that person enjoying the same powers as<br />
are currently enjoyed by the Governor General, seems to me to give us<br />
the best of all worlds. That is, we end up with an Australian head of<br />
state. The source of that person's power is a derivative power from the<br />
two elected chambers of the Commonwealth the House of<br />
Representatives and the Senate and yet the person has the powers<br />
they need, or may need at some point in the future, to cover some<br />
contingency. So I was not really that surprised that some members of<br />
the Coalition came out and supported it because I thought thoughtful<br />
members of the Coalition probably would.<br />
JR: Is the Republic going to be an issue at the next election?<br />
PM: I think it will be because I think it is very hard for..<br />
JR: You want it to be?<br />
PM: Yes, because I think that..<br />
JR: John Howard doesn't, of course.<br />
PM: No, because John Howard is happy for the Monarch of another country<br />
to be our head of state and he doesn't want to see debate about the<br />
full expression of Australian nationality, sovereignty, individuality,<br />
identity. He doesn't want that. It is a very curious position he is in.<br />
I mean how do you walk around saying, " I want to be the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia and I so believe in who we are and what we have<br />
become that I believe that our head of state must be not one of us, but<br />
the Monarch of another country". I mean it is a tough position to be<br />
arguing and it is almost, I think as Australia faces the turn of the<br />
century and that is the sense of ourselves and our place in the region,<br />
it is almost a disqualifier from anybody who wants to be the Prime<br />
Minister of this country to say that one of us shouldn't be our head of<br />
state.<br />
JR: At the next election John Howard has pretty well made it plain that one<br />
of the issues that is also going to be significant and he has admitted as<br />
such, he is going to make your personality an issue. Do you accept<br />
that your style of politics, your prescriptive brand of politics, the way<br />
you do things..<br />
PM: And getting it done.<br />
JR: do you think it is going to be an issue?<br />
PM: I call it getting the mail through. You see I have looked at all these<br />
people, like Howard, in the past. They had power for years </p>
<p>themselves and did nothing with it. When John Howard left, he left us<br />
with double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, the biggest<br />
Budget deficit in our history, declining competitiveness, our<br />
manufacturing industries closing in every city. We were nowhere and<br />
the terms of trade, that is the price of our minerals and wool and these<br />
other things declining, we were in a parlous position.<br />
JR: He could enumerate a similar list of your record as Treasurer, surely?<br />
PM: No, no he could not. I mean we have had now 26 per cent<br />
employment growth since 1983. We started with a workforce of<br />
6 million, we have now got 8 million. We had five times as much<br />
employment growth per year that he had every year that he was<br />
Treasurer. We are looking at an inflation rate of around 2 to<br />
3 per cent, he was never looking at anything under 10 per cent. As a<br />
consequence, I believe, that you give a country leadership, you take<br />
risks, you point the direction. Howard believes that you follow.<br />
He believes that you pick up the polling data from the Party Secretary<br />
and you go glibly out running the lines that they have been given.<br />
Just take, for instance, on this nuclear issue. Yesterday he was saying<br />
" the Government's response has been entirely appropriate". He has<br />
obviously got some mail from his pollster and today he is saying<br />
" 1no, no, we have got to crank it up a little bit, we need to crank it up<br />
some more". On the Republic can you believe this, he wouldn't give<br />
an answer to that simple question: ' Mr Howard do you believe an<br />
Australian should be our head of state?' He wouldn't answer. Then he<br />
went on on with this obfuscation and wriggling about process and<br />
finally after five days, he sort of pinned himself down to putting a<br />
referendum, but only if he thought a majority of his stacked convention<br />
would actually agree with it. In other words, he faced up to test about<br />
a Republic and failed it. I mean in the last week there were two<br />
statements by Howard. One was the headland speech...<br />
JR: Do you feel sorry for him?<br />
PM: No, he is just not entitled to seek the job I have.<br />
JR: Well let's move on.<br />
PM: I mean other people are entitled to seek it, but not him. It has got to be<br />
somebody that can...<br />
JR: Who meets with your approval?<br />
PM: No. Who believes in Australia and has got something to say and do.<br />
You know, his headland speech was described by one commentator as<br />
mulch, the republic speech was completely empty. Why does Australia<br />
need, essentially, a sort of political vagabond without ideas, with a<br />
fifties view of the world, as their Prime Minister?<br />
JR: OK. Twenty-two minutes past five on ZR ( inaudible) across the state,<br />
and joining us on the program Paul Keating, Prime Minister, is our </p>
<p>guest. Just a little bit more on the next election one of the most, in<br />
fact the most, marginal seat in the country has got to be Bass in the<br />
North of the state Sylvia Smith is holding it by a mere handful from<br />
Warwick Smith, who is the re-endorsed Candidate. [ The] Labor Party<br />
currently holds four out five ( electorates] not by wide margins at all<br />
and Tasmania, of course, is an early very early indicator of how<br />
things were swinging in the last election. It could be pretty important<br />
how things go in the next one?<br />
PM: Indeed. And I think we have earned the right to hold those seats,<br />
Jules, and to win the fifth. Because if you look at the principle<br />
commitments the Government gave at the last election, were to restore<br />
growth to the economy, and employment. We have 630,000 job<br />
growth since the last election. 630,000. The economy has been<br />
growing somewhere between 4 per cent and 5 per cent through that<br />
period. I mean, they are the most difficult things to deliver and to<br />
deliver them with low inflation. So, in terms of the fidelity of the<br />
Government's commitments to it's commitments at the last election -I<br />
believe we have been faithful to them. And if you look at Tasmania, all<br />
of the extra employment that has come in Tasmania since the last<br />
election, has come from Federal Government programs. You have got<br />
a Coalition Government down here, a Conservative Government, that<br />
hasn't been able to do despite the national trend anything with<br />
growth in Tasmania, and were it not for things like we did this<br />
afternoon the Antarctic program, or the grants, or the Landcare<br />
program I was associated with this morning, or the labour market<br />
programs if you net out the employment in Tasmania from<br />
Commonwealth programs, Tasmanian employment has actually shrunk<br />
since the last election.<br />
JR: Well, here's an idea for some extra growth, possibly, certainly in<br />
tourism and to reduce the sense of isolation and separation from<br />
Australia that many Tasmanians have take the case of a family<br />
travelling across Bass Strait either direction, it doesn't matter. They<br />
want to take the car, okay? It costs something like so I am told<br />
$ 500 extra if you travelled the equivalent distance on the mainland.<br />
Now, a scheme to equalise that cost, I'm told again, would cost<br />
something like $ 29 million about the equivalent of building<br />
kilometres of good quality highway a $ 29 million scheme to equalise<br />
the cost of crossing that body of water, which would promote the tourist<br />
trade, which would reduce, as I say, the sense of isolation that many<br />
Tasmanians experience, and would do a tremendous amount for<br />
growth. And it has got bi-partisan approach Bob Collins, Federal<br />
Transport Minister, is looking at it at the moment....<br />
PM: What is he looking at on that at the moment?<br />
JR: Whether it's of sound principle?<br />
PM: If he is, I mean, that's fine with us. I mean, we have kept the support<br />
for cross-Tasman traffic going now for many years most obviously in<br />
the freight equalisation scheme... </p>
<p>JR: It's still more expensive to live here than in many other capitals.<br />
PM: Yes, that may be true. But we have an efficient air transport system<br />
which works right around the country you know, since the Federal<br />
Government de-regulated the airline system, air fares have dropped by<br />
per cent and the number of people travelling has risen by<br />
63 per cent.<br />
JR: But if you want to travel by a car across the Tasman...<br />
PM: I know that. Let's take me I go to Queensland occasionally, I go there<br />
for holidays, I don't take my car with me I fly. And<br />
JR: It's a lot bigger than Tasmania?<br />
PM; I know, but it's still a long way. I mean, from Sydney to Cairns is a lot<br />
longer distance than from Sydney to Hobart. But, let me make this<br />
point I think that what Tasmania... Tasmania has got some great<br />
strengths it has some natural strengths, it has some developed<br />
strengths you can see that in the technological base of the state, you<br />
can see it in the innovation, you can see it in the scientific things I saw<br />
this afternoon the Antarctic. You can see it in things like the<br />
catamarans, you can see it in some of the other high technology<br />
products...<br />
JR: But what deters people from coming here is the cost.<br />
PM: But I'm just making this point I think Tasmanians have got to believe<br />
that they can do anything that can be done on the mainland, and when<br />
that belief permeates through the state government which persists in<br />
this sort of victim mentality: this Coalition view that the place is sort of<br />
victimised just means that businesses stay away from it. They say,<br />
" look, this is not a psychology I want to get tied up with this is not a<br />
winning psychology". And I think all of this sort of general stuff that<br />
says " you know, look, we are disadvantaged we want this and that",.<br />
in other words " we are being preyed upon". Instead of taking the view<br />
" look, we are as good as anybody, we can do our best, we have got<br />
the scientific institutions here, we have got the educations system, we<br />
have all the opportunities, let's think positively, and let's oblige our<br />
state government to think creatively", then you will find businesses<br />
both growing here, and businesses from the mainland coming here.<br />
But, whenever businesses which can lift investment and lift<br />
employment run into this sort of view, " look, basically, we are either all<br />
' ruined, or we are victims, or we don't have a positive enough view of<br />
ourselves" it's poison to them. They just stay right away from it, and I<br />
think that's the thing that matters most. Just have a look at<br />
Queensland Queensland has really got the wind behind its sails. We<br />
used to hear this sort of talk from Queensland not in the last 4 or<br />
years. Look at the result it's tearing away. it's growing way beyond<br />
the national average. </p>
<p>JR: Mr Keating, interest rates. Since the Federal Election, you and<br />
Federal Treasurer Ralph Willis have, on any number of occasions,<br />
said " look, it's all in place the climate is now established for a drop in<br />
interest rates". Reserve Bank Governor Bernie Fraser to an<br />
overseas audience said forget it he has ruled out a cut in interest<br />
rates. He even said " look, they might even go up before they come<br />
down" that's at odd with what you have been saying.<br />
PM: Look, he was asked by somebody in the financial market in London,<br />
and he said " interest rates could rise, fall or stay where they are we'll<br />
just see'. The main thing he said is that the Government has put into<br />
place a solid Budgetary change. And I think people need to<br />
understand let me just give you these figures Jules: Last year, the<br />
Commonwealth sold $ 21 billion worth of bonds, $ 21,000 million worth<br />
of Commonwealth bonds. As a result, the Budget changed. This year<br />
we will need to sell only $ 6 billion. So we have relieved the bond<br />
selling program of $ 15,000 million. If you are selling fewer bonds,<br />
what happens is the price of bonds rises and the yields drop. That is<br />
why long term bonds have fallen by over 1 percentage point since the<br />
Budget and that is a fall in the market. The ten year bond rate is set in<br />
the market, it is not set by the Reserve Bank, it is set in the market.<br />
So if the market, which has already dropped the long term interest rate<br />
by around 1 per cent, over 1 per cent, and we have already seen the<br />
banks drop their fixed rates by 1/ 2 per cent or there abouts. What<br />
Mr Fraser is saying is we will be looking at the longer term portents in<br />
the economy, for wages, inflation, before there is any further<br />
movement. In other words, he is reflecting general Government policy.<br />
Mr Howard ran out immediately with an opportunist line saying<br />
" yakkety yak, yakkety yak, blah, blah, blah, if rates fall down, if rates<br />
fall down it will only be Mr Keating manipulating them down".<br />
The Government will be manipulating nothing. If rates fall, they will fall<br />
for completely legitimate reasons, that is the reasons for a primary<br />
change in fiscal policy.<br />
JR: So Bernie Fraser and the independence of the Reserve Bank is<br />
guaranteed, cast in iron?<br />
PM: The Reserve Bank shares a responsibility under the Reserve Bank Act<br />
to set interest rates in consultation with the Government and that is<br />
where they have been set in the past, last year, that is where they will<br />
be set in the future. But I think the Governor is wisely saying to people<br />
. he is really saying to the markets here, who were getting a bit of a<br />
sort of, what shall we say, thinking they were on the gold seam, " here<br />
we come, rates just sort of plummeting as low as we would like to take<br />
it". He is just reminding them, " hang on, look there is a few other<br />
things here, wages, inflation. We have got low inflation, we have got<br />
good wage outcomes, we want to keep them. Don't jump to<br />
conclusions, just let the natural course of things go" and I can only<br />
endorse that view.<br />
JR: Mr Keating, final question. Freshly elected New South Wales Premier,<br />
Labor man Bob Carr, proudly showed off his new Australian made </p>
<p>wool suit just a couple of days ago and he rather pointedly said well<br />
look what I have got, this is an Australian made suit Merino Gold<br />
I believe the brand was, or the type of wool, I am not sure but, as<br />
I say, he rather pointedly said I am supporting the Australian textile<br />
industry. I wonder who he was possibly sending a message to? Might<br />
it be time for you to hang up your Zegna, your Italian suit. Maybe<br />
some<br />
PM: Well I am not just supporting the textile industry, I am supporting the<br />
coal industry, the petroleum industry, the agricultural industries,<br />
secondary industry, product innovation. When I became Treasurer,<br />
we exported 13 per cent of our GDP. We are now exporting<br />
22 per cent. GDP this year is $ 500 billion. 9 per cent of it is worth<br />
billion of exports.<br />
JR: So wearing an Australian made suit<br />
PM: So when Bob Carr he has probably got about $ 44,999 million to<br />
catch up with me.<br />
JR: You have got a good calculator in your head.<br />
PM: I have, I know because these numbers have been running through my<br />
mind for so long.<br />
JR: Mr Keating thank you for spending time with us this afternoon. Enjoy<br />
the rest of your short stay in Tasmania.<br />
PM: Good on you Jules.<br />
ends </p>
