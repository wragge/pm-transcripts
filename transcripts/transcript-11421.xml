<p>Well, thank you very much, Richard. This is an historic home in the</p>
<p> Australian political panthenon. It, I guess, in time will take its</p>
<p> place beside that famous cottage in Bathurst which, of course, was</p>
<p> the home in which Ben Chifley grew up. And in time perhaps, as we</p>
<p> come to treasure our history a little more than we did in earlier</p>
<p> decades, other homes will also take their place alongside this. But</p>
<p> this is very much a part of John Curtin's background. It reflects</p>
<p> the world in which he grew up. It was a home that, I gather from what</p>
<p> his grandchildren have told me, he played a very large part in building</p>
<p> including the construction even of some of the furniture.</p>
<p>And it is important that we honour our history. He led Australia at</p>
<p> a time when our country was under its greatest security threat ever.</p>
<p> And whatever people's politics are it has to be said resolutely that</p>
<p> he led the country with very great courage and distinction. And it's</p>
<p> only right and proper that the Federal Government of today honour</p>
<p> John Curtin's contribution. I'm delighted that his grandchildren are</p>
<p> with us and I thank them for giving the Western Australian Government</p>
<p> and the Federal Government the opportunity for this. And to the Vice</p>
<p> Chancellor of the Curtin University, who's also with us, which of</p>
<p> course is very deeply involved in remembering Curtin's contribution</p>
<p> to Australia, it will be a further extension of all of that. Our history</p>
<p> is very important to us and as we approach the Centenary of Federation</p>
<p> we're getting a lot more sensitive towards and conscious of our history.</p>
<p> And today is just a small but important contribution to commemorating</p>
<p> a man who gave a great deal to Australia and is well loved and remembered</p>
<p> by millions of Australians.</p>
