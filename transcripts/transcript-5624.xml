FOR MEDIA 23 JULY 1981<br />
DECLARATION OF THE OTTAWA SUMMIT<br />
The Government welcomes the willingness of the members<br />
of the Ottawa Summit to participate in preparations for<br />
global negotiations, and their agreement on the need for<br />
constructive and substantive discussions between developed<br />
and developing countries.<br />
By its recognition of the reality of interdependence and of<br />
common interests, its commitment to substantial assistance,<br />
and its awareness of the need to increase public<br />
understanding of the need for aid, the Ottawa Summit has<br />
made a promising contribution to ending the stalemate which<br />
has for too long hindered progress on the North-South issue.<br />
The Ottawa Declaration clearly opens the prospects for<br />
more constructive meetings later this year in Cancun and<br />
also in Melbourne. </p>
<p>DECLARATION OF THE OTTAWA SUMMIT ( UNDERLINED)<br />
WE HAVE MET AT A TIME OF RAPID CHANGE AND GkEAT CHALLENGE<br />
WORLD ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND PEACE. OUR MEETING HAS SERVED TO<br />
-REINFORCE THE STRENGTH OF OUR COMMON BONDS. WE ARE CONSCIOUS THAT<br />
ECONOMIC ISSUES REFLECT AND AFFECT THE BROADER POLITICAL PURPOSES WE<br />
SHARE. IN A WORLD OF INTERDEPENDENCE, WE REAFFIRM OUR COMMON<br />
OBJECTIVES AND OUR RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUINT THE<br />
EFFECTS ON OTHERS OF POLICIES WE PURSUE. WE ARE CONFIDENT IN OUR<br />
JOINT DETERMINATION AND ABILITY TO TACKLE OUR PROBLEMS IN A SPIRIT OF<br />
SHARED RESPONSIBILITY, BOTH AMONG OURSELVES AND WITH OUR PARTNERS<br />
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.<br />
THE ECONOMY ( UNDERLINED)<br />
2. THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE WE ADDRESSED AT THIS MEETING WAS THE NEED<br />
TO REVITALIZE THE ECONOMIES OF THE INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES, TO MEET<br />
THE NEEDS OF OUR OWN PEOPLE AND STRENGTHEN WORLD PROSPERITY.<br />
3. SINCE THE VENICE SUMMIT THE AVERAGE RATE OF INFLATION IN OUR<br />
COUNTRIES HAS FALLEN, ALTHOUGH IN FOUR OF THEM INFLACTION REMAINS IN<br />
DOUBLE FIGURES. IN MANY COUNTRIES UNEMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN SHARPLY AND<br />
IS STILL RISING. THERE IS A PROSPECT OF MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWT1H 114<br />
THE COMING YEAR BUT' AT PRESENT IT PROMISES LITTLE EARLY RELIEF FROM<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT. THE LARGE PAYMENTS DEFICITS ORIGINATING IN THE 15179-80<br />
OIL PRICE INCREASE HAVE SO FAR BEEN FINANCED WITHOUT IMPOSING<br />
INTOLERABLE ADJUSTMENT BURDENS BUT ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST FOR SOME<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>T IME INTEREST RATES HAVE REACHED RECORD LEVELS IN MANdY COUNIhIES<br />
A1ND, IF LONG SUSTAINED AT THESE LEVELS, WOULD THREAlLN PRODLICi lVi:<br />
INVESTMENT. 4. THE FIGHT TO BRING DOWN INFLATION AND REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT MUST BE<br />
OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY AND THESE LINKED PROBLEMS MUST BE TACKLED AT THE<br />
SAME TIME. WE MUST CONTINUE TO REDUCE INFLATION IF WE ARE TO SECURE<br />
THE HIGHER INVESTMENT AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH ON WHICH THE DURABLE<br />
RECOVERY OF EMPLOYMENT DEPENDS. THE BALANCED USE OF A RANGE OF<br />
POLICY INSTRUMENTED. WE MUST INVOLVE OUR PEOPLES IN A GREATER<br />
APPRECIATION OF THE NEED FOR CHANGE: CHANGE IN EXPECTATIONS ABOUT<br />
GROWTH AND EARNINGS, CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT AND LABOUR RELATIONS AND<br />
PRACTICES, CHANGE IN THE PATTERN OF INDUSTRY, CHANGE IN THE DIRECTION<br />
AND SCALE OF INVESTMENT, AND CHANGE IN ENERGY USE AND SUPPLY.<br />
WE NEED IN MOST COUNTRIES URGENTLY TO REDUCE PUE: LICE BORROWING.,<br />
WHERE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT OR WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES WITHIN<br />
THE LIMITS OF OUR BUDGETS, WE WILL INCREASE SUPPORT FOR PRODUCTIVE<br />
INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION. WE MUST ALSO ACCEPT THE ROLE OF THE<br />
MARKET IN OUR ECONOMIES. WE MUST NOT LET TRANSITIONAL MEASURES THAT<br />
MAY BE NEEDED TO EASE CHANGE BECOME PERMANENT FORMS OF PROTECTION OR<br />
SUBSIDY. 16. WE SEE LOW AND STABLE MONETARY GROWTH AS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCING<br />
INFLATION. INTEREST RATES HAVE TO PLAY THEIR PART IN ACHIEVING THIS<br />
AND ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN HIGH WHERE FEARS OF INFLATION REMAIN STRONG.<br />
BUT WE ARE FULLY AWARE THAT LEVELS AND MOVEMENTS OF INTEREST RATES IN<br />
ONCE COUNTRY CAN MAKE STABILIZATION POLICIES MORE DIFFICULT IN OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES BY INFLUENCING THEIR EXCHANGE RATES AND THEIR ECONOMIES.<br />
FOR THESE REASONS, MOST OF US NEED ALSO TO RELY ON CONTAINMENT OF<br />
BUDGETARY DEFICITS, BY MEANS OF RESTRAINT IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES<br />
' AS NECESSARY. IT IS ALSO HIGHLY DESIRABLE TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY OF<br />
INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES., GREATER STABILITY IN FOREIGN<br />
EXCHANGE AND FINANCIAL MARKETS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SOUND DEVELOPMENT<br />
' OF THE WORLD ECONOMY.<br />
7. IN A WORLD OF STRONG CAPITAL-FLOWS AND LARGE DEFICITS IT IS IN<br />
THE INTERESTS OF ALL THAT THE FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS OF THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL<br />
INSTITUTIONS BE FULLY MAINTAINED. WE WELCOME THE RECENTLY EXPANDED<br />
ROLE OF THE IMF IN FINANCING PAYMENTS DEFICITS ON TERMS WHICH<br />
ENCOURAGE NEEDED ADJUSTMENT.<br />
8. IN SHAPING OUR LONG TERM ECONOMIC POLICIES, CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN<br />
TO PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RESOURCE BASE OF OUR PLANET.<br />
RELATIONS WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ( UNDERLINED)<br />
9. WE SUPPORT THE STABILITY, INDEPENDENCE AND GENUINE NON-ALIGNMENT<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT 10 COOPERAlE W! W<br />
THEM IN A SPIRIT OF MUTUAL INTEREST, RESPECT AND BtINEF IT, RECOCU] ZIN( B<br />
, THE REALITY OF OUR INTERDEPENDENCE.<br />
IT IS IN OUR INTEREST AS WELL AS IN THEIRS THAT THE DEVELOPING<br />
COUNTRIES SHOULD GROW AND FLOURISH AND PLAY A FULL PART IN THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC. SYSTEM COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR CAPABILITIES<br />
AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND BECOME MORE CLOSELY INTEGRATED IN IT.<br />
11. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONSTRUCTIVE AND SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION. S W! ITH<br />
THEM, AND BELIEVE THE CANCUN SUMMIT OFFERS AND EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
ADDRESS OUR COMMON PROBLEMS ANEW.<br />
12. WE REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE ALL AVENUES OF<br />
CONSULTATION AND COOPERATION WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN WHATEVE7R<br />
FORUMS MAY BE APPROPRIATE. WE ARE READY TO PARTICIPATE IN<br />
PREPARATIONS FOR A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE PROCESS OF GLOBAL NEGOTIATIONS<br />
IN CIRCUMSTANCES OFFERING THE PROSPECT OF MEANINGFUL PROGRESS.<br />
13. WHILE GROWTH HAS BEEN STRONG IN MOST MIDDLE INCOME DEVELOPING<br />
COUNTRIES, WE ARE DEEPLY CONSCIOUS OF THE SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS<br />
IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AND THE GRIM POVERTY FACED ESPECIALLY<br />
BY THE POORER AMONG THEM. WE REMAIN READY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPING<br />
COUNTRIES IN THE EFFORTS THEY MAKE TO PROMOTE THEIR ECONOMIC AND<br />
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THEIR OWN SOCIAL VALUES<br />
AND TRADITIONS. THESE EFFORTS ARE VITAL TO THEIR SUCCESS.<br />
14. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING SUBSTANTIAL AND, IN MANY CASES,<br />
GROWING LEVELS OF OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AND WILL SEEK T O<br />
INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF ITS IMPORTANCE,. WE WILL DIRECT THE<br />
MAJOR PORTION OF OUR AID TO POORER COUNTRIES, AND WILL PARTICIPATE<br />
ACTIVELY IN THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE LEAST DEVELOPED<br />
COUNTRI ES.<br />
WE POINT OUT THAT THE STRENGTHENING OF OUR OWN ECONOMIES,<br />
INCREASING ACCESS TO OUR MARKETS, AND REMOVING IMPEDIMENTS TO CAPITAL<br />
FLOWS CONTRIBUTE LARGER AMOUNTS OF NEEDED RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOG3Y<br />
AND THEREBY COMPLEMENT OFFICIAL AID. THE FLOW OF PRIVATE CAPITAL<br />
WILL BE FURTHER ENCOURAGED IN SO FAR AS THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES<br />
THEMSELVES PROVIDE ASSURANCES FOR THE PROTECTION AND SECURITY OF<br />
INVESTMENTS. 1L. THE SOVIET UNION AND ITS PARTNERS, WHOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE<br />
MEAGRE, SHOULD MAKE MORE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AVAILAB: LE, AND TAVE A<br />
GREATER SHARE OF EXPORTS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHILE RESPECTING6<br />
THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND NON-ALIGNMENT.<br />
17. WE WILL MAINTAIN A STRONG COMMITMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND WORK TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE, AND USE<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>EFF ECl IVEL Y, 1 HE FI NANC IAL. RESOUR CES FOR T HE IR I MPORT ANT<br />
RESPONSIBIL ITIES.<br />
18. WE ATTACH HIGH PRIORITY TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS<br />
CREATED FOR THE NON-OIL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BY THE DAMAGING EFFECTS<br />
ON THEM OF HIGH COST OF ENERGY IMPORTS FOLLOWING THE TWO OIL PRICE<br />
SHOCKS. WE CALL ON THE SURPLUS OIL-EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO BROADEN<br />
THEIR VALUABLE EFFORTS TO.-FINANCE DEVELOPMENT IN NON-OIL DEVELOPING<br />
COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF ENERGY. WE STAND READY TO<br />
COOPERATE WITH THEM FOR THIS PURPOSE AND TO EXPLORE WITH THEM, IN A<br />
SPIRIT OF PARNTERSHIP, POSSIBLE MECHANISMS, SUCH AS THOSE BEING<br />
EXAMINED IN THE WORLD BANK, WHICH WOULD TAKE DUE ACCOUNT OF THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF THEIR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS.<br />
19. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCELERATED FOOD PRODUCTION IN<br />
THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND OF GREATER WORLD FOOD SECURITY, AND THE NEED<br />
FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO PURSUE SOUND AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD<br />
POLICIES., WE WILL EXAMINE WAYS TO MAKE INCREASED RESOURCES AVAILAEI-E<br />
FOR THESE PURPOSES. WE NOTE THAT THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS IN MINI)<br />
TO DISCUSS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY PROPOSALS TO BE PUT FORWARD<br />
IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE SPECIALIZED U. N. INSTITUTIONS LOCATED<br />
IN ROME FOR SPECIAL ACTION IN THIS FIELD PRIMARILY DIRECTED TO THE<br />
POOREST COUNTRIES.<br />
WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF WORLD<br />
POPULATION GROWTH. MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE TAKING ACTION TO<br />
DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM, IN WAYS SENSITIVE TO HUMAN VALUES AND<br />
DIGNITY., AND TO DEVELOP HUMAN RESOURCES, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND<br />
MANAGERIAL CAPABILITIES. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE ISSU17S<br />
AND WILL PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS IN THESE<br />
AREAS. TRADE ( UNDERLINED)<br />
21. WE REAFFIRM OUR STRONG COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING LIBERAL TRADE<br />
POLICIES AND TO THE EFFECTIVE OPERATION OF AN OPEN MULTILATERAL<br />
TRADING SYSTEM AS EMBODIED IN THE GATT.<br />
22. WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN THIS SYSTEMS IN THE INTEREST<br />
OF ALL TRADING COUNTRIES, RECOGNIZING THAT THIS WILL INVOLVE<br />
STRUCTURAL ADAPTATION TO CHANGES IN THE WORLD ECONOMY.<br />
23. WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE AGREEMENTS REACHED IN THE MULTILATERAL<br />
TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AND INVITE OTHER COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY<br />
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO JOIN IN THESE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TRADING<br />
ARRANGEMENTS. 24. WE WILL CONTINUE TO RESIST PROTECTIONIST PRESSURES, SINCE WE<br />
RECOGNIZE THAT ANY PROTECTIONIST MEASURE, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF </p>
<p>VERT OR HIDDEN TRADE RESTRI CTIONS OR IN THE FORM OF SUBSIDIES<br />
PROP UP DECLINING INDUSTRIES, NOT ONLY UNDERMINES THE DYNAMISM UURk<br />
ECON'OMIES BUT ALSO, OVER TIME, AGGRAVATES INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENI.<br />
WE WELCOME THE NEW INITIATIVE REPRESENTED BY THE PROPOSAL OF THE<br />
CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF EIGHTEEN THAT THE GATT CONTRACTING PARTIES<br />
CONVENE A MEETING AT MINISTERIAL LEVEL DURING 1982, AS WELL AS THAT<br />
OF THE OECD COUNTRIES IN THEIR PROGRAMME OF STUDY TO EXAMINE TRADE<br />
ISSUES. 2b. WE WILL KEEP UNDER CLOSE REVIEW THE ROLE PLAYED BY OUR COUNTRIES<br />
IN THE SMOOTH FUNCTIONING OF THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM WITH A<br />
VIEW TO ENSURING MAXIMUM OPENNESS OF OUR MARKETS IN A SPIRIT OF<br />
RECIPROCITY, WHILE ALLOWING FOR THE SAFEGUARD MEASURES PROVIDED FOR<br />
IN THE GATT.<br />
27. WE ENDORSE EFFORTS TO REACH AGREEMENT BY THE END OF' THIS YEAR ON<br />
REDUCING SUBSIDY ELEMENTS IN OFFICIAL EXPORT CREDIT SCHEMES.<br />
ENERGY ( UNDERLINED)<br />
28. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT, WITH PERSEVERANCE, THE ENERGY GOALS WE<br />
SET AT VENICE FOR THE DECADE CAN BE ACHIEVED, ENABLING US TO BREAK<br />
THE LINK BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OIL CONSUMPTION THROUGH<br />
STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN OUR ENERGY ECONOMIES.<br />
29. RECOGNIZING THAT OUR COUNTRIES ARE STILL VULNERABLE AND ENERGY<br />
SUPPLY REMAINS A POTENTIAL CONSTRAINT TO A REVIVAL OF ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH, WE WILL ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ALL OUR ENERGY<br />
SOURCES, BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND NEW, AND CONTINUE TO PROMOTE ENERGY<br />
SAVINGS AND THE REPLACEMENT OF OIL BY OTHER FUELS.<br />
TO THESE ENDS WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELY HEAVILY ON MARKET<br />
MECHANISMS, SUPPLEMENTED AS NECESSARY BY GOVERNMENT ACTION.<br />
31. OUR CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH SHORT-TERM OIL MARKET PROBLEMS SHOULD<br />
BE IMPROVED, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE HOLDING OF ADEQUATE LEVELS OF<br />
STOCKS. 32. IN MOST OF OUR COUNTRIES PROGRESS IN CONSTRUCTING NEW NUCLEAR<br />
FACILITIES IS SLOW. WE INTEND IN EACH OF OUR COUNTRIES TO ENCOURAGE<br />
GREATER PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY, AND RESPOND TO PUBLIC<br />
CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY, HEALTH, NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT AND<br />
NON-PROLIFERATION. WE WILL FURTHER OUR EFFORTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, PARTICULARLY IN SPENT FUEL MANAGEMENT.<br />
33. WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO REALIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE ECONOMIC<br />
PRODUCTION, TRADE AND USE OF COAL AND WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER<br />
TO ENSURE THAT ITS INCREASED USE DOES NOT DAMAGE THE ENVIRONMENT.<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>34. WE ALSO INTEND TO SEE TO IT THAT WE DEVELOP TO THE FULLEST<br />
POSSIBLE EXTENT SOURCES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SUCH AS SOLAR, GEOTHERMA~ L<br />
AND BIOMASS ENERGY. WE WILL WORK FOR PRACTICAL ACHIEVEMENTS AT THE<br />
FOURTHCOMING UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON NEW AND RENEWABLE SOURCES<br />
OF ENERGY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION W'ITH<br />
THE OIL EXPORTING COUNTRIES IN THE INTERESTS OF THE WORLD ECONOMIY.<br />
EAST-WEST ECONOMIC RELATIONS ( UNDERLINED)<br />
36. WE ALSO REVIEWED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EAST-WEST ECONOMIC<br />
RELATIONS FOR OUR POLITICAL AND SECURITY INTERESTS. WE RECOGNIZED<br />
THAT THERE IS A COMPLEX BALANCE OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS<br />
AND RISK IN THESE RELATIONS. WE CONCLUDED THAT CONSULTATIONS AND,<br />
WHERE APPROPRIATE, COORDINATION ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT, I14 THE<br />
FIELD OF EAST-WEST RELATIONS, OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES CONTINUE TO BE<br />
COMPATIBLE WITH OUR POLITICAL AND SECURITY OBJECTIVES.<br />
37. WE WILL UNDERTAKE TO CONSULT TO IMPROVE THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF<br />
CONTROLS ON TRADE IN STRATEGIC GOODS AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY WITH THE<br />
U. S. S. R.<br />
CONCLUSION ( UNDERLINED)<br />
38. WE ARE CONVINCED THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC, FREE SOCIETIES ARE E' 3UAL<br />
TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. WE WILL MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER AND WITH<br />
ALL COUNTRIES READY TO WORK WITH US IN A SPIRIT OF COOPERATION AND<br />
HARMONY. WE HAVE AGREED TO MEET AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND HAVE ACCEPTED<br />
THE INVITATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC TO HOLD TH! S<br />
MEETING IN FRANCE. WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN CLOSE AND CONTINUING<br />
CONSULTATION AND COOPERATION WITH EACH OTHER. </p>
