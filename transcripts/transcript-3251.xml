PRIME MINISTER May 1974<br />
FREE ISSUE OF TREES AND SHRUBS TO SERVICEMEN IN QUEENSLAND<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the Australian<br />
Government would assist married servicemen occupying Housing<br />
Agreement homes in Queensland to establish and landscape<br />
their gardens by providing trees, shrubs, lawn seed, top<br />
soil and rotary hoeing free of charge.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that these items were normally provided<br />
for all Service-owned married quarters completed after 1 July<br />
1970 and also in dwellings allocated to servicemen under the<br />
Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements. However, the Queensland<br />
Government had not agreed to accept this provision in the-homes<br />
it~ builds for servicemen.<br />
The new provisions will apply to the original tenants of<br />
houses completed after 1 July 1970, the gardens of which are<br />
presently not established.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Australian Government's<br />
decision to provide landscaping assistance directly to servicemen<br />
occupying Housing Agreement homes in Queensland followed the<br />
refusal of the Queensland Government to bear the cost of<br />
providing these amenities for Australian servicemen.<br />
Mr. Whitlam recalled that he had raised the matter of<br />
providing trees and shrubs for the occupants of Army married<br />
quarters in Queensland with the then Minister for the Army,<br />
Mr. Peacock, as long ago as September 1971.<br />
