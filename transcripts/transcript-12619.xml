<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The issue of AMPâ¦[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I haven't spoken to anybody.  I';m not ringing up companies telling them what to do.  I make speeches and express my view.  I welcome companies that are giving a lead but I';m not going to start ringing up individual managing directors telling them how to run their companies.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My opinion is what you heard a moment ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how do you think the Liberals are travelling in South Australia?  There has been criticism.  I think you have, in fact, criticised them in the recent past over the court of disputed returns here, are you happy with things here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think we're doing brilliantly here in South Australia as far as the Federal Government is concerned.  We have outstanding Cabinet ministers, we hold a record number of seats.  Look, it's tough at a State level and when you lose an election despite the fact that you get more votes than the other side it's always a bit of a let down but given the difficulties of the early months of Opposition we're doing well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Should the Opposition pursue the man who delivered government to the Labor Party or should we get onâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That was a decision taken by the State organisation and I don't have anything to add.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you're going to visit a stem cell research project in just a few minutes, why is it important for you to go there, what are you hoping to find out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's always a good idea to learn more about the technical sides of medical research and it's a debate at the moment that's going on in the national Parliament.  It's a very important issue.  They're having a very good debate.  There's strong views on both sides.  I've got a view, I support the bill, I introduced it and I hope it goes through.  But I want to learn more about the issue and this afternoon is part of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you confident that the bill will go through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the indications at the moment are quite good but I don't want to pre-empt the other stages of the debate.  It is a free vote and I respect the range of views that exist within the Parliament and within my own party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you urge those who don't agree with you to at least take the time, as you're doing, and go and visit a stem cell research centre?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I';m sure that my close colleagues who have a different view from me on this have given the matter a great deal of thought and I respect that and I don't have any gratuitous advice to offer them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the State Government's threatening to pull resources out of Woomera if the Federal Government doesn't stop criticising its efforts.  Is there something that you can do toâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Stop criticising what?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's efforts.  Philip Ruddock criticised the State Government's handling of children in Woomera this week in Federal Parliamentâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think State governments should play games with an important issue like border security.</p>
