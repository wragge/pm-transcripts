<p>Well thank you very much Senator Kemp, Anne-Marie, Fran Kelly, Gough</p>
<p> Whitlam the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, Lady Nancy Gorton, Mrs Heather</p>
<p> Henderson, Senator Faulkner, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is quite an important and I believe significant occasion in the</p>
<p> developing curiosity and growing interest of all Australians, not only</p>
<p> in this country';s history but also in the personalities, the strengths,</p>
<p> the foibles, the weaknesses and the capacities of the 25 Prime Minister</p>
<p> that we've had since Federation. And I do want to compliment the National</p>
<p> Archived getting this material together, I agree entirely with Anne-Marie</p>
<p> that it will become a much used resource, it will be an extraordinarily</p>
<p> valuable aid not only for discipline students of Australian history but</p>
<p> also for that growing army of Australians who increasingly find and not</p>
<p> to their surprise but in an increasingly natural fashion that people who</p>
<p> have risen to high office in this country have had the same capacities,</p>
<p> the same weaknesses, the same abilities and the same responsiveness to</p>
<p> times of challenge and particular stress as men and women who have risen</p>
<p> to equally high office in other countries. I would agree with Senator</p>
<p> Kemp that there is a burgeoning fascination and interest in Australian</p>
<p> history. We do things differently here because we are a different people.</p>
<p> We acquired our political independence in a different way from many other</p>
<p> countries and as a consequence we respond very differently than others</p>
<p> do, no less passionately and intensely in our own way and I think we have</p>
<p> seen in recent weeks in the wake of the awful atrocity of the 12th of</p>
<p> October a depth of national passion and unity in a uniquely expressive</p>
<p> Australian fashion, the like of which I haven';t seen in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the lives and the interests and the commitments of the</p>
<p> 24 predecessors I';ve had in the office, I am now uniquely privileged</p>
<p> to hold, I';ve always found very fascinating. They were a group of</p>
<p> men, so far no women, I have no doubt that will at some time in Australia';s</p>
<p> future, many will hope not too distantly, also be right to say men and</p>
<p> women. They are a cross section, they';re very different, we all</p>
<p> have our views on them, I';ve known some of them very well, naturally</p>
<p> the bulk of them I didn';t ever meet, it fascinated me, most recently</p>
<p> I read David Day';s biography of John Curtin when travelling back</p>
<p> and forth to London earlier this year and needing the full length of both</p>
<p> plane journeys to do so. I found it a fascinating read, its insights into</p>
<p> the times in which Curtin lived, particularly his earlier years. Many</p>
<p> years I was fascinated to read Fin Crisp';s wonderful biograph of</p>
<p> Ben Chifley, the Prime Minister that I was first conscious of as a Prime</p>
<p> Minister. I was born during the first and very short lived prime ministership</p>
<p> of Robert Menzies and first became very interested in politics around</p>
<p> in the time of the 1949 election when Robert Menzies returned to office</p>
<p> and ended the prime ministership of Ben Chifley. Each has been different</p>
<p> and special in their own way. I have never forgotten those words of Tom</p>
<p> Hughes at John Gorton';s memorial service when he said that John</p>
<p> Gorton was both a larrikin and a gentlemen, something that I dare say</p>
<p> most Australian men would like to be described as at different stages</p>
<p> of their life.</p>
<p>So we have had, I think, a very rich and very special group of people,</p>
<p> this is of course not an occasion to start running political rulers over</p>
<p> them. Naturally with my own prejudices I have a long and abiding affection</p>
<p> for the contribution to this country of Robert Gordon Menzies our longest</p>
<p> serving Prime Minister and I';m very delighted that his daughter</p>
<p> Heather is here today. I remember the first weekend that Janette and I</p>
<p> spent at the Lodge after the election in 1996, we had the privilege of</p>
<p> inviting Heather and Peter around and we deliberately chose a drink much</p>
<p> loved of her late father to celebrate with them in a very personal way</p>
<p> our being at the Lodge. But his contribution was immense but I have never</p>
<p> been unwilling to acknowledge the enormous contribution to this country</p>
<p> of John Curtin during World War II in times of extraordinary stress, or</p>
<p> indeed to acknowledge the contribution in a number of areas to economic</p>
<p> change in Australia of the prime ministership of Bob Hawke. The most recent</p>
<p> occupants of the office of course have both been Labor Prime Ministers</p>
<p> and inevitably prior to myself, inevitably, we have been political opponents</p>
<p> and political contestants but I hope all of us who';ve been touched</p>
<p> by the office are generous enough and thoughtful enough of the national</p>
<p> interest to recognise the contribution of all irrespective of their political</p>
<p> backgrounds. When I first came into Parliament Gough Whitlam was Prime</p>
<p> Minister, I entered half way through Gough's three years as Prime Minister,</p>
<p> he was a very dominant parliamentary figure and certainly somebody who</p>
<p> represented an exponent of the art of parliamentary performance that had</p>
<p> a impression on me as a very young Member of Parliament entering in 1974.</p>
<p>The website offers some quite fascinating insights into the lives of</p>
<p> our Prime Ministers. Our longest serving Member of Parliament of course</p>
<p> was Billy Hughes, he served for 51 years, he helped found three political</p>
<p> parties and was expelled from all of them. Frank Ford must have been the</p>
<p> unluckiest Prime Minister, he was the shortest of all terms, eight days.</p>
<p> He apparently lost the ALP leadership ballot to John Curtin by one vote</p>
<p> in 1935 and lost his state by one vote in 1957. Bruce led the first all</p>
<p> Australian born Cabinet, Deakin refused honorary degrees from Oxford and</p>
<p> Cambridge, membership of the privy council and the title of Right Honourable.</p>
<p> Only the lives of Gorton and Whitlam I';m told spanned the lives</p>
<p> of all 25 Prime Ministers. That';s an interesting calculation, I</p>
<p> hope it';s right, but I';m sure I';ll be corrected by one</p>
<p> of the people I';ve named if I';m wrong. Only Lyons and McMahon</p>
<p> had children born while they were Prime Minister. John McEwen had to wait</p>
<p> 33 years in Parliament before he became Prime Minister. He had the longest</p>
<p> wait before becoming Prime Minister of any of the people who';ve</p>
<p> held that office.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen Australian history is encroaching more and more</p>
<p> on the affections and the interests of our fellow countrymen and the women.</p>
<p> The reasons for that are less important than the reality that it is occurring.</p>
<p> We have a special political tradition in this country, fortunately it</p>
<p> draws on the strengths of the heritages that have contributed to the modern</p>
<p> Australia without, I';m pleased to say, drawing on some of the weaknesses.</p>
<p> Our politics is fundamentally very egalitarian, our politics does by and</p>
<p> large reflect the views and the mores of the Australian people. We do,</p>
<p> to use that popular expression, have the political figures we deserve,</p>
<p> some of them, indeed most of them in my experience on both sides have</p>
<p> been very committed men and women, most people who come into the national</p>
<p> parliament in particular do so because they have pretty strong views and</p>
<p> pretty strong passions. Like any group of men and women in a professional</p>
<p> activity some do it rather better than others, and I think back over the</p>
<p> almost 29 years that I';ve been a Member of Parliament I';ve</p>
<p> been privileged to live through, to have an influence and ultimately to</p>
<p> shape many of the national political things that have occurred over that</p>
<p> period of time and it';s been an enormous privilege - so much has</p>
<p> happened since May of 1974 and now November of 2002.</p>
<p>One thing that has happened undoubtedly is that politicians now are infinitely</p>
<p> more accessible in a mass communications way than what we were 29 years</p>
<p> ago. We often lament the demise of the street corner meeting, I do, I</p>
<p> lament the demise of the Town Hall meeting at the eight o';clock</p>
<p> in the evening. I think many of us would be very happy to be able to incorporate</p>
<p> those sorts of things in our daily political lives, alongside the availability</p>
<p> that all of us must have to the media. The media occupies a special role</p>
<p> in political life, it';s often a role productive of tension and acrimony</p>
<p> but I have frequently said that the three great guarantors of liberty</p>
<p> in this country are not what is written in the Constitution or a putative</p>
<p> bill of rights but rather a robust Australian parliamentary democracy,</p>
<p> an incorruptible judiciary and a free press. If we have all of those operating</p>
<p> they will stand the test of time in protecting our freedom, we have those</p>
<p> I believe in abundance in this country and they are our unique guarantors</p>
<p> of the freedom and liberty of the Australian people.</p>
<p>Can I again thank the archives for this project, it';s a wonderful</p>
<p> use of our modest investment and I think it will be a rich store of information</p>
<p> and knowledge for years to come and I know as time goes by and people</p>
<p> reflect further on the history of Australia this website will be an important</p>
<p> part of that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
