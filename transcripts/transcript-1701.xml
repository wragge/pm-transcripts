FOR PR F. No. 11/ 1967<br />
CLCSINc-C? EXPO C7<br />
Ctatement by the Frime i./ inister, Mr. Harold -cit<br />
Three and a half million people had visited the Australian<br />
Favilion at Expo 67 when the E: position closed at the weekend.<br />
The Australian Favilion had been open since April as part of<br />
the international Exposition arranged by Canada to mark its Centennial<br />
of Confederation. The number of visitors was more than 5C( 1 greater than the<br />
most ortimistic estimates of the -lanners and the Favilion itself received<br />
very high ratings from commentators and critics.<br />
Cn Australia's special day at Expo 67 in June millions of people<br />
around the world saw the special programme televised through the satellite<br />
Telstar in outer space.<br />
The Australian Government has offered the A utralian Favilion<br />
building as a gift to the people of 3anada and discussions on its use are<br />
in progress with the City of iMontreal.<br />
The 2C kangaroos and 13 wallabies, which because of quarantine<br />
regulations, cannot be returned to ustralia are being donated to six zoos<br />
on the North American continent.<br />
The coral exhibits are being given to the Montreal Aquarium.<br />
Several enquiries have been received by the Commonwealth<br />
Government about the popular talking chairs and plans for their future use<br />
are being considered. I have sent the following" message to the Commissioner-General,<br />
Sir Valston '-ancock:-<br />
" The great Exposition commemorating the Centennial of Canadian<br />
Confederation is now over. It has been a notable success and you<br />
have all played your part wonderfully well. You have good cause<br />
to be proud of the succecs of the Montreal Exrposition and particularly<br />
of the Australian Favilion.<br />
Many tributes to our Favilion and staff have reached Australia and<br />
have given pleasure to the Government and your fellow countrymen.<br />
During my visit last June I found myself delighted with the effectiveness<br />
with which Australia's image was being presented.<br />
Now that your work Ic done, we look forward to having you all at<br />
home again.<br />
I send my own warm s: ersonal appreciation and thanks to you all<br />
for your efforts. T wcl! d to add a tape to those now famous<br />
talking chairs in which you cculd relax a while after your labours<br />
and hear them recite, ' Australia sends grateful thanks. V! ell done'."<br />
