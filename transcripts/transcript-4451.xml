EMBARGO: 2.00 P. M.<br />
JJU STRALIA&amp;<br />
FOR PRESS 27 JULY 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO ADELAIDE ROTARY CLUBS<br />
It is a great pleasure to be able to speak to you today.<br />
The latest economic indicators have been most encouraging. This<br />
week, the June quarter Consumer Price Index was announced<br />
the increase was 2.4 percent; over the year, excluding<br />
Medibank effects, the index rose 10.2 percent, substantially below<br />
the 15.8 percent increase over the year to June 1976. The<br />
annual inflation rate is now approaching single digit levels,<br />
and the devaluation price effects are being contained.<br />
As we approach the second Budget of our first term of office,<br />
it is now clear that the first Budget last August achieved a<br />
great deal. Expenditures were largely held within Budget<br />
estimates for the first time in some years; the deficit was<br />
substantially reduced; the growvth of the money supply was held<br />
to the budgeted target; investment increased; and most significantly,<br />
the economy began to grow again.<br />
Last week, the latest Commonwealth loan closed, and<br />
I can say that it was a very successful result which will make<br />
very useful contribution to financina the Budget deficit in<br />
the current year. The Treasurer will Se announcing the<br />
loan figures later today.<br />
The Government still runs a large deficit which must be financed<br />
in a responsible way and these two successful Commonwealth<br />
loans will help in this task. They will make the job of<br />
containing money supply growth to responsible levels easier,<br />
they will help the longer run fight against inflation.<br />
One sector of our community which has always been well represented<br />
in Rotary is small business. Small business is a vitally important<br />
sector of our economy. It employs more than 40 percent of<br />
the work force, it constitutes more than 90 percent of all<br />
business enterprises. But during the past five years, small<br />
business has been under considerable pressure.<br />
Some of the problems of the small businessman arise from inflation,<br />
industrial trouble, and in some cases lack of managerial<br />
expertise. But perhaps the most serious problem has been the<br />
difficulty many small businessmen have found in raising adequate<br />
capital to finance their growth and development. 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Unlike the large public company, small business cannot raise money<br />
from the stock market or by the issue of debentures to the public.<br />
And businessmen are sometimes unable to raise the required finance.<br />
The Government is most concerned to ensure that small business<br />
has access to sufficient funds to finance growth. For after all,<br />
growth of small business is vital to full economic recovery for<br />
this country. The Government has already moved to assist the<br />
financial position of small businessmen. Various taxation<br />
reforms have made available to small business substantially<br />
increased profits and cash flow, thereby, placing them in a better<br />
position to finance growth out of retained profits. First,<br />
we have introduced a generous investment allowance a special<br />
tax deduction of 40 percent of the capital cost of eligible new<br />
plant. Second, the initial stage of our scheme for trading<br />
stock valuation adjustment reduces the tax paid by businesses<br />
by discounting the value of trading stock for tax purposes by<br />
half the inflation rate, so for the year just ended, the tax value<br />
of stock will be discounted by 5 percent. Third,, with the<br />
needs of small businesses particularly in mind, the retention<br />
allowance for private companies that is, the proportion<br />
of after-tax business income that a private company may retain<br />
free of the special tax on undistributed income has been<br />
increased from 50 percent to 60 percent.<br />
In addition, small businessmen, like all taxpayers, have<br />
greatly benefitted from the introduction of tax indexation.<br />
We are also taking steps to see what action might be taken to<br />
ensure that loan capital is readily available to small businessmen.<br />
Last year, the Government published a report by Professor Johns<br />
on the availability of finance to small business. His survey<br />
concluded that there was a gap in the supply of medium term and<br />
long term finance to an important number of Australian enterprises.<br />
In the light of that Report and other -representations we have<br />
received, we have set up a task force to examine this matter<br />
further and I hope to receive their report shortly.<br />
In addition, we have appointed Professor Johns to be the first<br />
director of the new Bureau of Industry Economics.<br />
Part of the work of that Bureau will be to undertake detailed<br />
research into longer run economic issues of relevance to the small<br />
business sector.<br />
We have also acted to improve coordination of Commonwealth and<br />
State assistance to small businessmen. Under the new cooperative<br />
scheme, the States are providing counselling services,<br />
management courses.. and in some cases, guarantees for bank loans.<br />
The Commonwealth is providing research and information and<br />
coordinating the whole scheme to ensure a proper pooling of<br />
resources and minimise duplication. Consultation between the<br />
Government and maniufacturers has also been increased by the<br />
establishment of the Australian Manufacturing Council, which<br />
meets for the first time in Canberra today. These measures<br />
taken as a whole should leave no-one in any doubt of the<br />
Government's desire to encourage the growth of small business.<br />
One other factor which undoubtedly would further stimulate<br />
small business would be a significant fall in interest rates.<br />
As a farmer, I am well aware of the benefits which would flow<br />
from an easing of the interest burden. 3 </p>
<p>Government bond rates have had to remain high as part of<br />
our concerted anti-inflationary programme, but as inflation<br />
is brought further under control, there are prospects of some<br />
fall in rates occurring. Those businessmen among you who<br />
are involved in manufacturing industry will know only too<br />
well how much erosion there has been in recent years in our<br />
international competitiveness. Greatly increased costs,<br />
sluggish productivity and poor industrial relations have<br />
resulted in a loss of export markets, and increasing<br />
competition from imports in domestic markets.<br />
It was factors such as these which led to our decision to<br />
devalue last November, and we confirmed our determination<br />
to fight inflation.<br />
It is also clear that recovery of the economy is still being<br />
retarded by overpriced labour costs. Do you know that<br />
based on ruling exchange rates at the time, average weekly<br />
earnings in Australia in 1971 were 17 percent lower than in the<br />
United States, but that now they are over 13 percent higher<br />
in Australia than in the U. S. A survey issued last week by the<br />
Australian Chamber of Commerce and the National Bank showed<br />
that two-thirds of companies wholly or partially absorbed<br />
the last two wage rises without increasing prices, but that<br />
half of these companies did so by reducing their number of<br />
employees. Never was it more true, as Mr Frank Crean to his<br />
credit once observed, that " one man's wage rise, is another<br />
man's job."<br />
It will simply not be possible to reduce unemployment to<br />
acceptable levels unless union leaders and the Arbitration<br />
Commission take a realistic attitude to wage increases.<br />
In the long term, structural change in our secondary industry<br />
is inevitable. And the Government will be encouragng<br />
future development in manufacturing to flow into those<br />
industries which have the best long term prospect for growth.<br />
But for the present, the Government is determined to alleviate<br />
economic and social disruption, and minimise the erosion<br />
of employment opportunities. We have determined, for example,<br />
that 80 percent of the local market for passenger motor<br />
vehicles should be reserved for local producers, this level<br />
is regarded as necessary to avoid disruption of the industry.<br />
The local industry's share of the market has declined this<br />
year below 80 percent. This has coincided with a fall in<br />
demand for new vehicles and the result has been retrenchments<br />
of employees, as occurred in the past week in this States.<br />
We are most concerned at the damaging effects this may have<br />
on the South Australian economy, and the hardship caused to<br />
employees to the car industry and their families. We have<br />
therefore acted to introduce quotas on imported vehicles,<br />
and we have sought reports from the I. A. C. so that we can take<br />
action if necessary to prevent further major dislocation in<br />
this industry. 4 </p>
<p>On my recent trip to Europe, trade was a central issue in all<br />
my discussions with leaders of the European Community.<br />
One matter of primary concern to me was the increasing difficulties<br />
which the protectionist policies of the E. E. C. were causing<br />
Australian exporters of agricultural products. Virtually<br />
all our primary products other than wool are denied access to<br />
European markets. And what is worse, European surpluses<br />
are exported at such vast subsidies that our goods are being<br />
undercut in many of our other traditional markets around the<br />
world. Recently, these policies of exclusion have been<br />
applied not only to agricultural but to Japanese manufactured<br />
goods and steel from Japan and South Africa. The attempt<br />
was also made to make Australia reduce our exports of steel to<br />
the E. E. C. by 25 percent on the grounds that Australia was an<br />
unfair trader. I would not voluntarily contemplate such cuts<br />
and the request has since been withdrawn.<br />
The E. E. C. with its 260 million people.. is the world's largest<br />
trading bloc, accounting for 40 percent of the world's trade.<br />
In 1960, our exports to members of the E. E. C. accounted for<br />
percent of our total exports. Now that proportion has<br />
been reduced to 14 percent. Not because we are any less<br />
efficient, than we were, but because of the restrictive<br />
policies of the E. E. C. As a result of my discussions last<br />
month, the European Commission has agreed to a series of<br />
bilateral trade discussions commencing later this year.<br />
And as a sign of the of the vital significance of these talks<br />
to usl I have appointed a Minister, Mr John Howard, to lead<br />
our negotiating team. Mr Howard will, as the Constitution<br />
requires, head a new Department, but it will be confined to<br />
20-30 people and effectively constitute a secretariat for the<br />
negotiating team.<br />
The matter of primary concern to the Europeans, however,<br />
was not agricultural goods but uranium. Their most pressing<br />
shortage is energy. And they have reached the decision that they<br />
must rely on nuclear energy if they are to meet the needs of<br />
their factories and homes over the next two decades.<br />
Their nuclear industry is already well developed, over 10 percent<br />
of the energy produced in Belgium, Britain, Sweden and<br />
Switzerland, last year was derived from nuclear reactors.<br />
European leaders made it very clear to me that they looked<br />
to Australia which holds one fifth of the world's uncommitted<br />
reserves of uranium to be a stable long term supplier<br />
of uranium. My response was that we were considering the<br />
report of the Fox Inquiry and had not yet reached a decision<br />
on uranium exports, but that their needs would certainly be<br />
taken into account.<br />
I was also able to outline to them the comprehensive<br />
system of safeguards which would apply to any uranium we might<br />
export. They constitute the most stringent safeguards so<br />
far adopted by any country, and will be applied both through<br />
compliance with the requirements of the International Atomic<br />
Energy Agency, and through bilateral agreements,* between Australia<br />
and each user-country. </p>
<p>The European's wish for us to be a stable long-term supplier<br />
of uranium bore striking similarities to our request that they<br />
be a stable long-term customer for our beef and other agricultural<br />
products, and I do not think the logic of this comparison<br />
was lost on them. The development of our uranium resources<br />
of course affects not only the Europeans, it also affects<br />
all Australians, some very closely indeed. The benefits<br />
of mining are obvious, particularly to the economy of the<br />
Northern Territory. But we shall not determine this issue until<br />
other fundamental issues have been resolved. In particular.<br />
no decision will be made on mining until we are absolutely<br />
satisfied that the environment will be fully protected, and<br />
that the needs and interests of the Aboriginal people are<br />
safeguarded.<br />
The issue of uranium is not the only matter on which the interests<br />
of the Aboriginal people require urgent attention. For too long,<br />
the interests of Australian Aborigines have been overlooked<br />
by the rest of our society, their plight as among the most<br />
underprivileged Australians is not always appreciated.<br />
Sickness and malnutrition are rife in many Aboriginal communities.<br />
Child mortality rates and life expectancy for adults are far<br />
worse than for other Australians, and over 50 percent of the<br />
Aboriginal workforce is unemployed. The Government is<br />
giving a high priority to tackling these problems, and in doing<br />
so, to restore self-confidence and dignity to the Aboriginal<br />
people. The Land Rights Act, proclaimed earlier this year, is an<br />
historic achievement, and the Law Reform Commission is<br />
currently studying the feasibility of recognising<br />
Aboriginal customary law as part of the law of the land.<br />
Substantial sums are being paid for Aboriginal health services,<br />
and our aim is to train more Aboriginals as field health<br />
workers, to ensure that there is adequate communication<br />
between those providing and those receiving the service.<br />
The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Ian Viner, recently<br />
announced that we would establish an Aboriginal community<br />
health service using the community itself and traditional<br />
healers to provide the service. This is an appropriate point<br />
perhaps to lay to rest speculation which I have read in the<br />
press about an early election.<br />
I can tell you that there will be a national election in Novemberan<br />
election for the National Aboriginal Conference.<br />
This new body has been set up on the recommendation of a Committee<br />
of Enquiry, all but one of whom were Aborigines.<br />
The N. A. C. will operate under a charter which has already<br />
been tabled in Parliament, and will provide a forum in which the<br />
views of 1-borigine communities can be expressed at Federal and<br />
State level. Another body, the Council for Aboriginal Development,<br />
will also be established. This all-Aboriginal body half<br />
elected by the N. A. C. and half nominated by the Government<br />
will be the formal adviser to the Government on Aboriginal affairs.<br />
We have introduced a number of initiatives which together<br />
amount to a national employment strategy for Aboriginals. / 6 </p>
<p>We are establishing a programme of community development<br />
employment projects. ThiS: programme is directed towards<br />
Aboriginals who live in remote or separate communities,<br />
and who do not form part of the open labour market.<br />
The projects approved under this programme will provide work,<br />
including part-time, contractual and cooperative work, as an<br />
alternative to income support by way of unemployment benefit.<br />
Aboriginal Councils or incorporated groups will receive lump<br />
sums which will enable them to determine the work projects<br />
to be undertaken and allocate resources to them.<br />
You may be aware that in response to the Government's<br />
initiative, two Aboriginal communities in South Australia<br />
have already decided to work on community development projects<br />
instead of receiving the dole.<br />
The Government is also taking steps to expand the number and<br />
variety of employment opportunities for Aboriginals in both<br />
the private and public sectors. A national campaign will be<br />
undertaken with a view to persuading employers at top management<br />
level to train and employ Aboriginals in their establishments.<br />
Support of this will be provided under the National Employment<br />
and Training Scheme. I would be particularly delighted<br />
if Rotary would ensure that all its members were aware of this<br />
Scheme and urged to support it.<br />
Mr Chairman, thank you for inviting me to speak here today.<br />
Gordon Davidson has been extolling the virtues of Adelaide<br />
Rotarians to me for as long as I can remember.<br />
Rotary is an organisation which I personally hold in high regard,<br />
its reputation is largely based on its manifest concern for the<br />
uriderprivileged in our community. This is a concern which the<br />
Government endorses and shares.<br />
I congratulate your social service programmes and I wish you<br />
even greater success in the years ahead.<br />
