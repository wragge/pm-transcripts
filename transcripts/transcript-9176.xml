PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, FAIRBAIRN RAAF BASE<br />
APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, what do you hope to achieve on this visit?<br />
PM: Well it is a visit, I think, which pays recognition to the growth of<br />
Thailand and Indo-China, Australia's involvement with the area, and I<br />
thiink the opening of the bridge is going to symbolise Australia's<br />
constructive engagement with this part of South East Asia. I think that<br />
is the main point. Thailand is the second largest ASEAN economy, it<br />
is growing very rapidly and there is much for Australia to do there, and<br />
for Australians to do there. We will be very pleased, I think, to<br />
participate in this piece of primary infrastructure, the Friendship Bridge<br />
between Thailand and Laos. I am also looking forward to going to<br />
Vietnam to renew the contacts I have had there with the Government<br />
and the Prime Minister, to see if, again, we can do further to develop<br />
that economy with Australian companies. And I think the key message<br />
is all this sets Australia up well in the 21st century. That our children<br />
will have the benefit of closer integration with Asia, a more interesting<br />
growing economy in Australia as a consequence, and to be truly part<br />
of the region.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: We are not doing tarmac doorstops on budget deficits.<br />
J: What about on federal interventions into ALP factional brawls?<br />
PM: About the trip, anything else?<br />
J: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: Yes, I will. But again, as I have said many times we put our views on<br />
human rights clearly and forthrightly, but we also want to maintain<br />
relationships with these countries and that is to see them as total<br />
relationships, and I think that has proven to be a successful policy and<br />
I will be pursuing that here on this visit.<br />
ENDS </p>
