PRIME MINISTER<br />
Transcript Press briefing with John Bowan -7 August 1984<br />
E 0 E Proof only<br />
BOWAN: The two Prime Ministers met for an hour altogether<br />
this morning, of which about three quarters was just a private<br />
meeting between themselves and about twenty minutes or so<br />
with officials. They did discuss the issue of ANZUS and allied<br />
ship visits and in the course of the discussion the<br />
Prime Minister outlined the Australian Government's position<br />
which you are all familiar with. He made it quite clear in<br />
doing that that he was expressing the Australian view and he<br />
was not acting as an emissary of the United States. And then<br />
they had a useful exchange on the issue.<br />
Turning to economic issues they discussed CER and they<br />
reaffirmed the commitment of both Governments to the CER<br />
process and in that context they discussed a number of<br />
investment and trade problems which had emerged under the<br />
previous conservative New Zealand administration..<br />
On motor vehicles the New Zealanders acknowledged that the<br />
arrangements announced by Mr Muldoon during the election<br />
would have reduced preferences to Australian vehicles in the<br />
New Zealand market to a very significantly damaging point and<br />
he acknowledged that this was not viable in the CEfl context<br />
and Mr Lange undertook to review the arrangements at ministerial<br />
level and within one month to'be in a position to come back<br />
and talk to us about it with rather a more satisfactory<br />
position.<br />
On steel the two Prime Ministers reveiwed the recent history<br />
of relations on steel and agreed that they would initiate<br />
discussion by officials and Ministers to find an acceptable<br />
formula for equitable reciprocal access to each other's markets<br />
for rolled steel from the time the new New Zealand rolling<br />
mill comes into production. Now that's planned for 1986<br />
until 1991 when the CER free trade provisions come into<br />
force. On investment Mr Hawke expressed appreciation of the new<br />
New Zealand's Labor Government's decision to lift an embargo<br />
on Australian investment in New Zealand. The two Prime<br />
Ministers agreed that despite Muldoon propaganda there was<br />
really no real current investment impediment to New Zealand<br />
in Australia. And the P. M. indicated that for its part<br />
Australia was determining its arrangements to ensure that<br />
problems did not arise in the future. In that context the<br />
question of the well-known application by the Bank / 2 </p>
<p>BOWAN cant : of New Zealand t~ o open in Australia was<br />
raised.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Bank of New Zealand?<br />
BOWAN: The National Bank of New Zealand. The P. M. indicate~ d<br />
that in the months following the Budget the Treasurer would<br />
bring forward a submission on the entry of foreign banks<br />
and in that context the New Zealand application would be<br />
examined sympathetically.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that month or months?<br />
BOWAN: Months. So that's it ladies arid gentlemen.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the ANZUS talks would Mr Hawke have got<br />
an impression from Mr Lange that. in fact their position<br />
C wouldn't change on the nuclear ships.<br />
BOWAN: Well Barrie I can't go beyond what I've said which is<br />
basically they had a useful exchange on the issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was useful about the exchange?<br />
JOURNALIST: How long did they devote to that discussion?<br />
BOWAN: I don't know Greg, I wasn't there.<br />
JOURNALIST: So this all occurred in the private meeting,<br />
none outside it?<br />
BOWAN: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you say what Hawke said expressing the Australian<br />
view?<br />
C BOWAN: Well the Australian view as you kn'ow is that we accept<br />
visits by allied warships and we will continue to do so.<br />
JOURNALIST: consequence for the future of the alliance?<br />
BOWAN: I don't know about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you know if they agreed to have future talks<br />
with us about it.<br />
BOWAN: I don't know what they agreed. I presume that there<br />
will be continued discussion on the subje-ct.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you there for the last twenty minutes?<br />
BOWAN: Yes I was there for the I think it was a very<br />
friendly meeting. They know each other as you know from<br />
Mr Lange's visit to Australia last July and they have a good<br />
rapport. / 3<br />
-I~ rr. rr </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are they planning to meet agaiLn while they're here?<br />
BOWAN: Not for a specific bilateral occasion like this. They'll<br />
no doubt be running into each other at different social events.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you got any more detail on the cars, what<br />
the preferences, what the effect Would be. Would we sell them<br />
more cars, will they be cheaper ther?<br />
BOWAN: Well I presume that's obviously our concern. With<br />
the proposal that Muldoon put forward it would then have been very<br />
to our position. And the fact that * the New Zealanders have<br />
acknowledged' that certainly leads uIS'to be hopeful that we'll<br />
come up with a better<br />
JOURNALIST: I don't know exactly. what it was Muldoon did in<br />
any particular detail.<br />
C' GARNAUT: a new car industry plan in the course of the<br />
election campaign. One feature of that was to reduce the<br />
margin of preference that Australian vehicles had in the past.<br />
Another feature was that it didn't move towards a great deal<br />
of free access for Australian vehicles And the combination<br />
of those two effects was going to reduce what had been anhistorically<br />
important market for Australia. Australia would<br />
prefer arrangements that increase rather than reduce markets<br />
overseas. JOURNALIST: How much was it going to reduce the market. What*<br />
sort of estimates did we have on that?<br />
GARNAUT: There hasn't been any detailed assessment but it did<br />
look as if it was going to be substantial and Mr Lange<br />
JOURNALIST: What's substantial 20%, 30%, 10%,<br />
GARNAUT: I haven't seen a quantitative estimate but I ' would<br />
C think it would be more like the largest than the smallest.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much is the market preference at this stage?<br />
GARNAUT: Well it's different for different sections of the<br />
industry.<br />
JOURNALIST: of our P. M. going to New Zealand at some stage?'<br />
BOWAN: Not that I'm aware of Peter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Lange tell him he might t'e raising this ANZUS<br />
thing at the South Pacific Forum on nuclear, ships?<br />
BOWAN: I don't know.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you give a bit more detail on the nuclear<br />
ships maybe later? </p>
<p>BOWAN: I'm not sure that we really want to go beyond what<br />
I've said really.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the point of the meeting. I mean can<br />
Mr Hawke get some indication of any change in the New Zealand<br />
attitude between when Mr Hayden was there and now.<br />
BOWAN: Well he wanted to discuss the issue and hear from<br />
Mr Lange his views on it and to take the opportunity to put<br />
across our own views.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did he go beyond our own views in terms of<br />
trying to put together some sort of foram to resolve the<br />
problem or ideas?<br />
BOWAN: I don't know about that Greg.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why is the Government being so reticent?<br />
BOWAN: I think this was a private discussion between the<br />
two Prime Ministers. It's obviously a fairly sensitive issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: When our Prime Minister says that we accept visits by<br />
allied nuclear ships as part of the pact did he indicate the we<br />
believe that we do this because we believe it's necessary for<br />
the continuation of the pact as a workable pact.<br />
BOWAN: I believe that's part of our position.<br />
JOURNALIST: He would have spelt that out as well I take it?<br />
BOWAN: Well I imagine.<br />
JOURNALIST: So is this sort of reticence about something that'Is<br />
1going to be because of our concern or New Zealan-d. s concern<br />
* 1 for their position.<br />
BOWAN: No I think it's just appropriate that the issue be<br />
handled with sensitiveness.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would it be too strong to say that Mr Hawke said<br />
4 to Mr Lange today if the visits didn't go ahead that ANZUS<br />
could break down.<br />
BOWAN: I don't know whether he put that to him?<br />
JOURNALIST: Well there must have been a determined position<br />
before he went in though?<br />
BOWAN: Well I don't really want to go basically beyond the<br />
position that I set out in the beginning.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Mr Hawke give Mr Lange any hints on his<br />
experience in handling the economy, on the National Economic<br />
Summit? </p>
<p>BOWAN: There was a separate meeting of some officials at which<br />
there was some discussion of the Summit and the New Zealanders<br />
plans were certainly raised. I don't know what it was like<br />
in the discussions between them.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was that separate officials' meeting about<br />
besides the Summit.<br />
BOWAN: Well it was really the officials who were basically<br />
in readiness to take part in with the Prime Ministers. There<br />
was a bit of a social gathering first and then there was<br />
some discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was there a discussion on the nuclear ships<br />
BOWAN: No. No formal discussions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did they talk about the future of CHOGRM.<br />
BOWAN: Not as far as I know Peter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did they discuss the gold medal tally<br />
BOWAN: That would almost certainly have been a subject.<br />
Just as a matter of interest the Prime Minister this evening<br />
after the conclusion of the day's festivities will be receivinig<br />
a call by the Indonesian Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Soedarijo<br />
Rustan, who is representing President Suharto here at the<br />
I opening of the PNG Parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has he got any plans to see Rajaratnam while he'~ s<br />
here?<br />
BOWAN: No, no Bruce.<br />
I JOURNALIST: What's the purpose of this call tonight?<br />
BOWAN: Well the Indonesians have indicated that they would<br />
like Mr Soedardjo to pay a courtesy call on the Prime Minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did they mention any specific<br />
BOWAN: No specific topics, no. </p>
