STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ALLEGATION BY MR HAWKE<br />
A Channel Nine news report has tonight broadcast what<br />
purports to be a verbatim account of a conversation<br />
between Mr Hawke and myself in 1991. According to<br />
Channel Nine, these remarks are contained in Mr Hawke's<br />
book. I categorically deny ever making these remarks.<br />
The allegation is deeply offensive and defamatory. it is<br />
clearly intended to personally vilify and politically<br />
damage me.<br />
I have served 25 years in the Australian Parliament, 11<br />
years as a Cabinet Minister and two and a half years as<br />
Prime Minister. People can choose to believe the record,<br />
and what is on the record the real, tangible testaments<br />
of my affection for Australia and devotion to its<br />
interests or they can believe Mr Hawke's alleged<br />
fragment of a private conversation.<br />
