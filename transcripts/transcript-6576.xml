PRIME MINISTERA<br />
FOR MEDIA JANUARY 25 1985<br />
I am concerned at false, misleading and damaging reports<br />
about a letter I sent recently to the Rt. Hon. David<br />
Lange, Prime Minister of New Zealand.<br />
I will not depart from the principles and practice of<br />
this Government by releasing copies of private<br />
communications with foreign Governments.<br />
The facts of the matter are, however, that on<br />
January, after consultation with my colleagues the<br />
Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence, I wrote to Mr<br />
Lange to inform him that I would be visiting the United<br />
States in early February for talks with President Reagan<br />
and senior members of his Administration. I said that I<br />
expected the Americans to want to discuss in some depth<br />
the state of and prospects for the ANZUS Alliance. At<br />
the same time I indicated that it* was important, from<br />
Australia's point of view, that I should explore at<br />
first hand United States thinking on Ithis key matter.<br />
I informed Mr Lange that, in developing views for my<br />
talks in Washington I would value his thoughts on ANZUS<br />
and, in particular, on the longer term management of the<br />
question of ship visits. I stressed that I had no wish<br />
or intention to act in any way as an emissary. But I<br />
knew that the New Zealand and United States Governments<br />
had had a number of bilateral exchanges on the subject,<br />
and that it would be helpful to have his judgement on<br />
where the matter now stood and the prospects of an<br />
agreed outcome.<br />
I noted that Australia, as I knew Mr Lange would<br />
understand, had important and direct interests at stake,<br />
notably the future of the ANZUS Alliance and of two of<br />
Australia's most important bilateral relationships. He<br />
would recall that, when the ALP Government came to power<br />
in 1983, we made it an early objective to initiate a<br />
review of ANZUS, in association with our Treaty<br />
partners. We had firmly concluded from that review that<br />
ANZUS continued to serve fundamental Australian security<br />
interests. </p>
<p>I went on to say that, in the light of this unequivocal<br />
conclusion, the Australian Government would need to<br />
continue to make clear that, whatever New Zealand's<br />
position or policies might be, Australia, as a sovereign<br />
nation which must protect its fundamental security<br />
interests, had its own well-known and clearly expressed<br />
position on visits by United States warships and the<br />
importance of maintaining the neither confirm nor deny<br />
principle. We could not accept as a permanent<br />
arrangement that the ANZUS Alliance had a different<br />
meaning, and entailed different obligations, for<br />
different members.<br />
I said that Australia would be avoiding any public<br />
statements which cast doubt on whether the USA was<br />
applying its policy of neither confirming nor denying<br />
that warships were carrying nuclear weapons in<br />
particular cases and, as New Zealand's Alliance partner,<br />
saw it as important that the New Zealand Government<br />
should do the same.<br />
I indicated that I was leaving Australia on 2 February<br />
for meetings on 6 and 7 February, and I understood that<br />
late in January he and his colleagues would be taking<br />
important decisions on the question of ship visits. if<br />
time constraints permitted, I would greatly welcome any<br />
views he might wish to let me have before I left.<br />
Similarly, I wanted Mr Lange to have an indication of<br />
the very broad lines of my thinking before my meetings<br />
in Washington.<br />
I concluded by saying that I would also be visiting<br />
Brussels and both there and in Washington I planned to<br />
take up trade matters, including issues of concern to<br />
both our countries such as dairy products and progress<br />
in consultations on trade in the Pacific region. I<br />
undertook to pass on to Mr Lange the outcome of my<br />
discussions on my return.<br />
As the-facts I have outlined above indicate, the letter<br />
in no way departs from established Australian policy on<br />
these matters. </p>
