The Prime Minister today encouraged all Australians to mark Remembrance Day by observing a minute's silence at 11am.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said whether Australians are in the office, on a building site, in the classroom or at home, we should all take a quiet moment to reflect on the sacrifices of our fellow Australians in uniform.</p>
<p>Remembrance Day is a day etched in the memories of many, which honours all servicemen and women who have died in wars, conflicts and on peacekeeping operations.  </p>
<p>It marks the anniversary of the armistice which ended the fighting in the First World War in November 1918.</p>
<p>On 11 November, at Remembrance Day services across the country and overseas, Australia pays tribute to more than 102,000 Australians who have lost their lives in the service of our nation.</p>
<p>We also pause to remember the Australians who have served with distinction in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations around the world. </p>
<p>As we take the time on Remembrance Day to reflect on the contribution of past generations of servicemen and women, the Prime Minster also asked Australians to remember those currently serving Australia at home and abroad. </p>
<p>This year we have sadly seen Australians in uniform lose their lives abroad and at home and it is important we recognise the service and sacrifice of these brave soldiers. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs said all Australians owe a debt of gratitude to all who have risked their lives fighting for this country. Lest we forget.</p>
<p>This year marks significant anniversaries of major battles in Australia's military history  -  Tobruk, Greece and Crete 70 years ago; Kapyong and Maryang San 60 years ago; and Long Tan 45 years ago - as well as the centenary of the formation of the Royal Australian Navy.  </p>
<p>The Prime Minister also encouraged Australians to mark Remembrance Day by buying a poppy from the Returned and Services League (RSL) of Australia. </p>
