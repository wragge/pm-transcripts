PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS: PM. NO. 101/ 1971<br />
MASTER PLAN FOR BRISBANE AIRPORT<br />
Joint Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. William<br />
McMahon and the Premier of Queensland, Mr. J.<br />
Bielke-Petersen<br />
The Joint Coimmonwealth/ State Advisory Committee on<br />
Brisbane Airport has completed the first major step in developing<br />
a master plan for the future of Brisbane Airoort. This was<br />
announced today by the Prime Minister, Mr. McMahon and the Premier<br />
of Queensland, Mr. Bjelke-Petersen.<br />
The Committee comprises representatives of the<br />
Commonwealth and State Governments and the Brisbane City Council.<br />
In a joint statement today, the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. McMahon and the Premier of Queensland, Mr. Bjelke-Petersen,<br />
said: " The Committee's chief object was to devise a master plan<br />
which took into account the foreseeable qrowth of aviation in<br />
Brisbane, the latest plans for the further development of the<br />
Brisbane metropolitan area, including port development in the<br />
Brisbane River, the Nudqee area, and the Serpentine Scheme, and<br />
plans for improving the highway network.<br />
" The ecological problems must be considered and it also<br />
had to remove the noise nuisance to the south-west of the Airport<br />
without causing unacceptable noise levels in other closely settled<br />
areas. " It also had to take regard of the need to lift the<br />
building height restrictions over the heart of Brisbane which at<br />
the moment lies below the approach oath of the main runway at<br />
Eagle Farm. " The Conmittee had also to consider that a larger<br />
terminal area would be needed to handle the volume of passengers and<br />
freight which must be expected in the not too distant future".<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier said. " The<br />
Committee has recommended that the runway system should be moved to<br />
the position astride the existing northern boundary of the airport<br />
and that the runways should be so re-aligned as to avoid noise in<br />
any nearby populated area. / 2 </p>
<p>" This means that the building height limit over the<br />
central business district would be abolished.<br />
" In the lone term the Committee recommended that<br />
there could be widely spaced parallel runways and it was with this<br />
in mind that it is proposed that the new terminal area should be<br />
located in a central position between the runways with direct and<br />
convenient surface access from the south-west side of the airport.<br />
" This is a most modern concept". The Prime Minister<br />
and the Premier added that the master plan involved the diversion<br />
of the floodway. However this would not present any major engineering<br />
problem. The floodway would be maintained by appropriate<br />
earthworks and outlet control works to ensure that the probability<br />
and level of flooding upstream of Nudgee Road would not increase.<br />
They added that a more detailed assessment of the<br />
environmental effect on the foreshore would also be made.<br />
The Prim . e inister and the Premier said: " It is<br />
recognised that this future development would be a very extensive<br />
project with the Commonwealth virtually creating a new airport and<br />
with the State and the City of Brisbane financing bigger highway<br />
projects which would not only better serve the general area but which<br />
will also meet the need for speedy -ccess to the airport".<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier said that their<br />
Governments would give prompt consideration to the Committee's<br />
recommendations. Mcanwhile the Prime Minister has asked the Departments<br />
concerned to accelerate the detailed planning of the airport and<br />
see what can be done to provide preliminary estimates as quickly as<br />
possible. CA3NBERRA 16 December, 1971. </p>
