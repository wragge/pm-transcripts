<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning John. Nice to talk to you again.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Good to talk to you too. I hope it's as pleasant a day in Canberra</p>
<p> as it is in Brisbane today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a beautiful day. I went for a walk this morning and it's</p>
<p> one of those stunning autumn days in Canberra.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Okay, well we've got the same here. Let's get into it. What</p>
<p> was the catalyst that made the Government change its mind on accepting</p>
<p> 4000 refugees from what I call Â‘the Yugoslav holocaust'?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well this is a tragedy which is above what I might call the normal</p>
<p> tragedies. The mass movement of people involved is the largest in</p>
<p> Europe since World War II. And Cabinet came to the view yesterday</p>
<p> after a lengthy discussion that Australia had a strong moral obligation</p>
<p> to play its part. Even though we were breaking new policy ground,</p>
<p> even though Australia is a long way from Yugoslavia, even though Australia</p>
<p> is not a NATO country, Australia is by the standards of the world</p>
<p> a relatively affluent, prosperous, successful country. It's very</p>
<p> stable. We have a proud humanitarian record of providing a home and</p>
<p> a haven for displaced people, for people thrown out of their homes</p>
<p> by war. And this applied particularly at the end of World War II.</p>
<p> Now this is a special case and we felt the right thing to do was not</p>
<p> to be hide bound by previous policy, correct though it was in most</p>
<p> circumstances, and remains in most circumstances. But because of the</p>
<p> special character we needed a special response. It's as simple</p>
<p> as that.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Well given that it, as you say, is breaking new ground. I mean there's</p>
<p> a lot of areas that are going to have to be covered here. We are talking</p>
<p> about what I would believe to be the largest ever single intake of</p>
<p> people into this country, the largest ever arrival into this country</p>
<p> as we say in one hit. Now obviously that's going to raise some</p>
<p> pretty serious issues, as you say they're not going to be able</p>
<p> to stay here permanently, it's going to raise some pretty serious</p>
<p> issues about security.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh John, although it's a large number I don't know that</p>
<p> it's true to say it's the largest single number arriving</p>
<p> in one hit. I mean the 4000 obviously all won't come together.</p>
<p> And because it's an emergency situation we have to provide an</p>
<p> emergency response, and I don't beat about the bush in saying</p>
<p> that many of the details are still being worked out. But that's</p>
<p> understandable. Three weeks ago, even two weeks ago, even ten days</p>
<p> ago, this wasn't on the horizon. So therefore there's no</p>
<p> way in which people can turn around and say why weren't you ready</p>
<p> for it. We have to get ready in a special situation and we have people</p>
<p> working on that already. Of course there will be difficulties and</p>
<p> there'll be criticisms, and there'll be people saying you're</p>
<p> doing too much, you're doing too little. I accept all of that</p>
<p> but in the end you either provide some help and you provide a home</p>
<p> and a haven on a temporary basis for people or you turn your back</p>
<p> on them. Now I'm not prepared to see Australia turn its back</p>
<p> on these people. Most Australians would not want to turn our collective</p>
<p> back on these people. We of course are making it clear they are here</p>
<p> temporarily. They are here as guests of the Australian people. They'll</p>
<p> be provided with accommodation, they'll be provided with food,</p>
<p> they'll be provided with medical attention, and they'll</p>
<p> be provided with the basic necessities of life. Naturally we don't</p>
<p> want a situation to arise where taking them is seen as some kind of</p>
<p> victory for Milosevic. That is why they're being taken on a temporary</p>
<p> basis. And it's a basic part of the decision and I discussed</p>
<p> this yesterday with the Opposition Leader Mr Beazley, that when Parliament</p>
<p> comes back we will enact special legislation with effect from yesterday</p>
<p> making it clear that these people are not entitled while they're</p>
<p> in Australia to seek permanent residence or some status change, nor</p>
<p> are they entitled to seek social security benefits. In other words</p>
<p> they are to be legally isolated from the existing refugee and immigration</p>
<p> stream because of the special character of the arrangement. Now, I</p>
<p> think in all the circumstances Australia has clearly done the right</p>
<p> thing. We have an immigration policy which for most situations is</p>
<p> appropriate. In this special situation we needed a special response</p>
<p> and that's the decision that the Government took yesterday and</p>
<p> I believe Australians will support it because they are warm-hearted</p>
<p> decent caring people who feel with me that we do have a moral obligation</p>
<p> to help in this appalling disaster. This shameful mass movement, mass</p>
<p> expulsion of people from their homes on the basis of their race, this</p>
<p> racial persecution being practiced against the Albanians in Kosovo.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Well it is text book genocide as I've often said on this programme.</p>
<p> Now given that we are, and I agree with you, that most fair minded</p>
<p> Australians would say that we are doing the right thing here. Can</p>
<p> you also understand the concern amongst Australians I'm sure,</p>
<p> that these people do not bring with them violence and hatred? I mean</p>
<p> we have seen the violent demonstrations in Sydney and Melbourne by</p>
<p> the Serbian community. Do you believe for example that those people</p>
<p> were adequately brought to account for those demonstrations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, I don't, having not personally witnessed the demonstrations</p>
<p> I can't answer that. I can say though that I publicly condemn</p>
<p> the demonstrations. My view, and I 0believe the view of all Australians,</p>
<p> most Australians, on this is very simple. People have a right to peacefully</p>
<p> demonstrate in this country. And I can understand any Australian of</p>
<p> Serbian descent, particularly those who were born in Serbia, being</p>
<p> concerned about what is happening in their former homeland. That is</p>
<p> only human. But I can also say on behalf of the rest of the Australian</p>
<p> community that we are not interested in the importation into this</p>
<p> country of the hatreds of other nations and that applies in relation</p>
<p> to Serbians, it relies in relation to Ireland, it applies in relation</p>
<p> to the countries of Asia. And it is one thing to respect the diverse</p>
<p> heritage of the Australian people, it is entirely another thing to</p>
<p> extend that respect to the importation of the political differences</p>
<p> of other lands. By and large Australians are not interested in those</p>
<p> political differences, and particularly in relation to people of different</p>
<p> ethnicities who have been born in this country. Australia is their</p>
<p> homeland. It is a little different for somebody who actually participated</p>
<p> in the appalling things that took place in parts of Europe during</p>
<p> World War II. If you've actually lived through those and participated</p>
<p> in it, it's very understandable that you'll carry those</p>
<p> memories with you to your grave. But it's an entirely different</p>
<p> situation in relation to your children. They've been born in</p>
<p> this country. They are of a different generation, a different experience.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just back again, and I know as you've stressed</p>
<p> it's early days yet in the planning of how this is all going</p>
<p> to be handled, but we are talking about as I understand it putting</p>
<p> these people possibly onto camps on defence installations. Will they</p>
<p> then be under the care of members of the armed forces in terms of</p>
<p> security, Making sure that they stay where we want them to stay?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, all of those things are in the course of being considered and</p>
<p> worked out today, and in subsequent days. I'm not going to try</p>
<p> and preempt what the outcome is. It is just not possible, given that</p>
<p> this is an emergency situation, for any group of human beings to have</p>
<p> all the answers straight away. Now I just can't answer that question</p>
<p> and I'm not going to try and answer it because the answer I give</p>
<p> may be wrong. We only took the decision yesterday. The emergency only</p>
<p> arose over the weekend. It was only over the weekend. Other countries</p>
<p> talked about taking people. We have responded very speedily. We are</p>
<p> working away now in relation to all of the details and as and when</p>
<p> they become clear and we've taken decisions we'll make announcements.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Sure, and I might get you back to talk about those when they happen.</p>
<p> Just quickly before we go, you have the Premiers coming to see you</p>
<p> on Friday. One of the key things is going to be the issue of addressing</p>
<p> this national drug plague that we have. Peter Beattie on my programme</p>
<p> this morning was saying he's going to be pushing for trials of</p>
<p> naltrexone, and another detox drug here in Queensland. And he's</p>
<p> also backing the idea of heroin trials in the ACT and Victoria. Do</p>
<p> you see those sort of things as having any merit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well naltrexone is already on prescription. I don't know whether</p>
<p> he's misunderstood that or not. But naltrexone is already on</p>
<p> prescription. The question in relation to naltrexone is whether its</p>
<p> approval on the pharmaceutical benefits list can be fast tracked or</p>
<p> subsidised and the Government is examining that at the moment. And</p>
<p> I could have something to say about that on Friday at the Premiers'</p>
<p> Conference. I will be indicating a series of new initiatives to the</p>
<p> Premiers. I hope they will support them. The Federal Government has</p>
<p> already put just under $300 million nationally into its Tough on Drugs</p>
<p> strategy. We'll be proposing a number of new measures. We need</p>
<p> the cooperation of the States. I'd like to focus on Friday on</p>
<p> those areas where there is common ground between the Federal Government</p>
<p> and the States. As far as heroin trials are concerned I think what</p>
<p> Mr Beattie is saying is that he's backing a heroin trial in somebody</p>
<p> else's State. I don't think he's saying he's backing</p>
<p> a heroin trial in Queensland. With great respect, I mean he either</p>
<p> is for or against a heroin trial. I've made it very plain that</p>
<p> we don't support heroin trials. I'm quite prepared to state</p>
<p> my position. I'm quite prepared to say I am against a heroin</p>
<p> trial, and the Federal Government is against a heroin trial, and we</p>
<p> will not amend the Federal narcotics legislation to allow the importation</p>
<p> of pharmaceutical grade heroin to facilitate a trial anywhere in Australia.</p>
<p> Now that is our position. We're not trying to sort of bob and</p>
<p> weave on this and have two bob each way. We are against a heroin trial.</p>
<p> Now I think Mr Beattie's against a heroin trial in Queensland.</p>
<p> I'm not sure whether he's against a heroin trial in the</p>
<p> ACT or Victoria. Frankly that's his business, that's his</p>
<p> concern. He is talking about trialling another drug. We'll have</p>
<p> a look at that. We're prepared to consider any reasonable suggestions</p>
<p> from the Queensland Government. We naturally expect the Queensland</p>
<p> Government to carry its share of the burden. The Federal Government</p>
<p> is not going to pick up the tab for everything. The States have got</p>
<p> to play their part and this particularly applies to treatment of addicts</p>
<p> because that historically has been entirely a State responsibility.</p>
<p> It's only in the last little while that the Commonwealth came</p>
<p> into that area. That's always in the past been the responsibility</p>
<p> of the States. Now if there have been deficiencies in that area it's</p>
<p> not been our fault. But we are now entering that field and I announced</p>
<p> a lot of money in that area a few weeks ago. But I have got some more</p>
<p> proposals to put and I'll be communicating those to the Premiers</p>
<p> and there'll be more about that very soon. Watch this space so</p>
<p> to speak.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Sure. Well just on that subject, and very briefly if we may, will</p>
<p> these proposals move the focus somewhat from treating the drug problem</p>
<p> purely as a health issue to treating it as a criminal issue? In other</p>
<p> words will we have more focus on enforcement?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can't have an exclusive focus on one aspect. You need a three</p>
<p> pronged approach. You need education, you need tough law enforcement</p>
<p> against the traffickers, and you need treatment, particularly for</p>
<p> people who want to break the habit. And we have tried with our Tough</p>
<p> on Drugs Strategy to focus in an equal fashion on those three areas</p>
<p> without giving priority to one against the other two. And what I say</p>
<p> on Friday to the Premiers will be of a peace with the approach that</p>
<p> we've adopted over the past 12 months. I mean our $290 million</p>
<p> Tough on Drugs strategy includes resources for additional police and</p>
<p> customs. It includes money for education in schools. And it includes</p>
<p> more money for treatment. Now that's tackling it in a balanced</p>
<p> sensible fashion.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for your time this morning. Talk to you again</p>
<p> soon.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
