L I TRAINING SEMINAi. ON DRUGS<br />
CANB: RRA, A. C. T 7 SEPTEMBER 1970<br />
-Seec by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Minister, Your Excellencies, Commonwealth and , tate Ministers,<br />
Officers of the Crown, Federal and State, and our Vi itors from Overseas:<br />
Thank you, Mr. Minister, for the introduction. This Seminar, in one<br />
way, is a function that one can scarcely be pleased to oa-en, because it is not<br />
pleasing that there should be a need for a Seminar to . revent the abuse of drugs.<br />
Yet, in another way, because there is that need, and because it is paramount, it<br />
is pleasing indeed to see the effort that is being made, of which this Seminar<br />
is a part, to combat one of the greatest menaces of our time.<br />
I welcome experts from the United Statec3 Bureau of Narcotics and<br />
Dangerous Drugs who will assist with the technical lectures, and I welcome the<br />
representatives of the Overseas Narcotics Bureau in South East Asia. To that<br />
I add a very warm welcome to the students on the course that is the drug<br />
enforcement officers from within and from without Australia.<br />
The task before us all is a truly international one. Our object is to impede<br />
and, where we can, to eliminate illicit drug traffic and drug abuse. I believe<br />
this Seminar will be a major cortribution to that end. It is the first centralised<br />
course of its kind in Australia and it is being presented by the Commonwealth<br />
Bureau of Narcotics in conjunction with the Training Centre of the Department<br />
of Customs and Excise.<br />
In a very real sense, the task before all of you here is the task of<br />
protection of protecting individual citizens from the madness and death which<br />
they can inflict upon themselves by drug abuse, and of -protecting the community<br />
against the crimes to which such addicts can be driven, should the supply of<br />
their narcotics be cut off.<br />
It is distressing to find that in Australia, where we have so much going for<br />
us, the habit of drug-taking is increasing, as it is increasing amongst our<br />
neighbours in South-East Asia. And it is distressing to find that the sources of<br />
supply are so numerous.<br />
It would be easy for us to say " This is a problem for the countries where<br />
the drugs are produced. Let us stop the menace at its source." But it isn't<br />
as simple as that. For one things, we don't control the activities of the<br />
countries which are the sources of these narcotics. And though destruction at<br />
the source of supply is the ideal and absolute way of killing this vice, if we<br />
cannot do it, there are at least two other points at which successful attacks<br />
can be launched. / 2 </p>
<p>There are the supply routes, which are world wide, and there are the<br />
markets at the end of those supply routes, of which Australia is one. Because<br />
the supply routes are spread throughout the world and more than one country<br />
the markets at the end of those supply routes, it is because of that that this is<br />
such an international problem and that is why this Seminar is so international<br />
in character. How well you succeed in the objects you have that this Seminar is<br />
designed to further will be, I believe, a factor i-n the standard of our societies<br />
for generations to come. And what is happening in our own country, Australia,<br />
today? The truth is that drug abuse is increasing. The smugglers are getting<br />
more numerous and more cunning. There are more pushers at work and they are<br />
fir. Jing more customers among our young people. This must be stopped and we<br />
must marshal all the skills we have to stop it.<br />
The warnings from other countries Wh ich have suffered the problem longer<br />
are quite loud and clear. The drug trail is the downhill trail to crime, to despair,<br />
to poverty, to madness and to death.<br />
Not many years ago the worst drug evil we had in Australia was a bit of<br />
opium-smoking and a few opium dens in the back streets of our big cities, and<br />
this was a problem of quite manageable proportions. But now it's hashish,<br />
marijuana, LSD harder narcotics and more and more young people are<br />
" taking trips" and getting " hooked" and more and more " pads" are to be found in<br />
areas of our cities. The doctors, the hospitals, the psychiatrists and the social<br />
workers, all know what tne Customs and the police and the couts know that<br />
this illicit traffic and these dangerous habits are gettingw orse, and that one of<br />
the greatest tasks before us is to stop it all as soon and as completely as we can.<br />
It isn't easy to quote actual figures on the grovwth of drug abuse, but in the<br />
last eighteen months, seizures of illegal drugs have increased by 300 per cent<br />
and in the last three months drugs to the value of a quarter of a million dollars<br />
have been intercepted. They came from half a dozen countries in Asia, from the<br />
United States and from South Africa.<br />
In 1968, 152 young people between 14 a-id 19 years of age were charged<br />
with drug offences and a further 139 between the ages of 20 and 34. Well, you<br />
may say that isn't many, but there are many who do not get caught and there is<br />
the unhappy fact that the numbers are growing with frightening speed.<br />
For in 1969, not 152 but 284 youngsters between 14 and 19 were charged,<br />
and not 139 between the ages of 20 and 34 were charged but 424 in that age<br />
group, which is a two and a half fold increase in one year. / 3 </p>
<p>The drugs are coming through all sorts of channels from external sources;<br />
some are smuggled into Australia in false compartments of suitcases and bags,<br />
some in household appliances such as food mixers and ctereo speakers and bongo<br />
drums and so on. But you know this better than I do. And yet others come by<br />
mail or are thrown overboard from ships in our ports.<br />
Well, we are developing our own responses to these practices and our<br />
counter-measures are having some success. The strength cf our Narcotics<br />
Squad has been trebled since it was first formed and it is proposed to increase the<br />
numbers again in the near future.<br />
But perhaps I can sum up our task by giving you five points to which the<br />
Australian public should direct their minds.<br />
First the drug traffic and drug abuse in Australia have grown at an alarming<br />
rate of geometric progression in the past few years.<br />
Second, there has been an alarming increase in the number of new addicts<br />
in the younger age groups.<br />
Third, there are about 5, 000 recorded narcotic offenders in Australia.<br />
Marijuana is the most abused drug and in the last three years the quantity smuggled<br />
has increased dramatically.<br />
Fourth, most of the drug traffic is in the larger cities, though I understand<br />
there is evidence that preparations are being made in the smaller Australian<br />
cities to extend this traffic.<br />
And, fifth, there is some production and manufacture of marijuana and LSD<br />
going on in Australia.<br />
These points give you some idea of the problem here. This course<br />
beginning today will, I hope, be a powerful reinforcement for a continuing attack<br />
on the problem. The course itself came into being because for some time<br />
Commonwealth and State Ministers concerned with health and law enforcement<br />
had been discussing the increase of drug abuse in Australia. They set up a<br />
National Standing Control Committee and set it to work to study this problem.<br />
That Committee recommended a specialised central training course for<br />
officers engaged in the suppression of illicit drug traffic. The Ministers decided<br />
to have that course, and my colleague, Mr. Chipp, offered the services cf his<br />
Department to run it.<br />
Those of you who are here to attend that course are directly involved in<br />
the attack on the traffic. You can be assured that the Governments and people of<br />
Australia are completely behind you in your work. / 4<br />
I at. </p>
<p>For in Australia it has been-continually emphasised that where there has<br />
been a co-ordinated and co-operative effort by the various agencies here, and in<br />
Asia, and elsewhere this has had a marked effect on the drug traffic. I think this<br />
course will be a good example of the kind of co-operation which will lead to that<br />
effect. It will be up to you to interrupt the sources of supply. It will be up to you to<br />
apprehend the pushers and the addicts. It will be up to the courts to see that those<br />
who peddle these powders of death receive proper sentences so that they, the<br />
courts, can join in the protection which you are giving to the public of Australia.<br />
Now one final point. We recognise that the problem extends beyond<br />
individual countries. Nc one country can hope to combat the problem in isolation.<br />
Th refore, the question of co-operation and liaison, with Asian countries in<br />
particular, becomes essential to our growing efforts to cut down the illicit entry<br />
of drugs. Some activity has already taken place with that object in view, but my<br />
Government has now decided that it will take the initiative in setting up a more<br />
formal international arrangement between the operational bodies responsible for<br />
anti-narcotic control..... between ourselves, New Zealand, and our Asian friends.<br />
The Government will begin discussions on this matter with Governments<br />
in the South-East Asian area as soon as practicable. Preliminary talks have<br />
already taken place on this matter between the Minister for Customs and Exicse<br />
and Ministers in other countries and these talks indicate that there will be a<br />
large measure of support for this co-operative finternatonal action.<br />
And Ministers agree that irrespective of a country's borders, the<br />
operational bodies must work together to cut off supply routes, and if possible,<br />
the sources of supply and to pass on information through an international network<br />
so that against an international conspiracy, there can be an international defence.<br />
Given this more formal arrangement, and given the enthusiasm which I<br />
believe you will bring to this work, I think that we will have taken another big stride<br />
forward in really getting to grips with this dangerous and growing problem.<br />
Now, Mr. Minister, I declare this Seminar open. </p>
