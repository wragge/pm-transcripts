FOR PRESS: PM No. 15/ 1971<br />
MR EGGLETON'S APPOINTMENT TO THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, _ Mr. Iohn Gorton<br />
The appointment of my Press Secretary, 1Dfr. Tony<br />
Eggleton, as Director of Information for the Commonwealth is<br />
announced today.<br />
At the request of Mr. Arnold Smith, the Commonwealth<br />
Secretary-General, I have agreed to release Mr. Eggleton to<br />
fill this significant post with the Commonwealth Secretariat in<br />
London. Mr. Eggleton is his sixth year as Press Secretary<br />
to the Prime Minister, and during that time has created a record<br />
by serving three Prime Ministers. He has been a loyal and<br />
valued member of my personal staff, and I arn sorry to lose him.<br />
But I am sure his experience in the media and information<br />
fields will enable him to make a real contribution to the work of<br />
the Secretariat, and it is a compliment to Mr. Eggleton that he<br />
should have been invited to fill this new post.<br />
