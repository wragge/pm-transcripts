LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF THE PRIME MNISTER<br />
OF CANADA, MR P. TRUDEAU, AT PARLIAMENT<br />
HOUSE, CANBERRA 19 MAY 1970<br />
Speech ~ Y the Pr~ ime Minister, Mr John Gorton.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
It is my great pleasure on this occasion to propose the<br />
toast of our distinguished guest and I do this for a variety of reasons.<br />
One, Sir, is because we are very glad indeed to welcome you here as<br />
a person, and because we are very glad indeed to welcome you here as<br />
the Prime Minister of Canada.<br />
It is a long time I think 1958 s3ince we last had a visit<br />
from the Prime Minister of Canada, and Sir, this is far too long a time<br />
to intervene before there are reciprocal visits from Prime Ministers of<br />
Australia to Canada and of Canada to Australia.<br />
We have a great deal in common. Your country, Sir, Ithink<br />
became officially at any rate a British country on September 18,<br />
17 39 when the surrender of Quebec to Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham took<br />
place. If it had not been for that little disagreement which was settled<br />
in that way, Australia might not have had to wait so long before out East<br />
Coast was discovered in 1770 because the discoverer of our East Coast<br />
was a Captain Cook who was in the boats which took the soundings to<br />
decide how the army of Wolfe could get to the Plains of Abraham in order<br />
to deal with Q uebec. But at least we have that in common.<br />
Some other things we have not had in common. We have<br />
never been invaded by the hardy colonials who cut their way through the<br />
Maine wilderness in order to invade Canada. But you have repelled on<br />
e very occasion both then and in 1812, the incursions from your neighbour<br />
to your South. We, on the other hand have been delighted to welcome<br />
them when we needed their help in order to remain a country.<br />
But this is not all that we have got. This is only the<br />
beginning. If you take the two countries Canada and Australia the<br />
physical way in which you see them on a map must immediately strike<br />
your imagination. The size is roughly the same... you are bigger, I<br />
know, but the size is roughly the same. Then there are large areas<br />
in both our countries which are underpopulated and which because of<br />
the climatic and other conditions which exist are likely to remain<br />
underpopulated. </p>
<p>2-<br />
We both have populations which, on a world basis, are<br />
not large but are growing, and we both have a vibrant economy,<br />
we both have a feeling of excitement and development in our countries.<br />
We also have a great number of problems in common.<br />
I think you, Sir, have to deal as a Federal Government<br />
with what are called provinces in Canada and there are some<br />
difficulties about arranging things about taxation and other matters.<br />
We have much the same here except, of course, we are not dealing<br />
with provinces. We are dealing with States. But there is that same<br />
difficulty, that same awkwardness in making a Federal system wor'k<br />
which your country and our country both have.<br />
There is, too, the desire that you have and which you<br />
have expressed and which we have, to try and see that as much of the<br />
ownership as possible of the development inside our countries is<br />
retained by the citizens of those countries. Rumour has it, Sir, that<br />
there will be established in Australia something called an Australian<br />
Industry Development Corporation, and rumour also has it that<br />
there will be established in Canada something calledi a Canadian<br />
Development Corporation both with the same objective in mind. So<br />
there is another instance of the approaches to the problems we<br />
have in common. Who is going to pay for the infrastructure for the mineral<br />
developments in your country and in our country? It is extraordinary<br />
how closely our problems parallel each other. This applies even<br />
when we come to the problem that both of us are growing grains of<br />
various kinds which the world does not wish to buy in the quantities<br />
we wish to grow them at the price which is payable for them to be<br />
grown. All of this indicates that what we decided this morning<br />
that there should be, if possible at intervals of not greater than<br />
two years, consultations between Ministers and officials of our<br />
two countries on these various problems, on how we would compete<br />
with each other in the world, but compete in a way which did not<br />
allow one to be used against the other, of how we would explain to<br />
each other the approaches we took on the problems we had and perhaps<br />
learn from each other; of how in the field of science where we have<br />
a unique opportunity in the Barrier Reef to out up an Institute of<br />
Marine Biology, and you in the Arctic have unique opportunities for<br />
scientific investigation in that field will be of benefit to both our<br />
countries. 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
But even mine, may I express our very<br />
great delight that Canada, a country which has naturally in the past<br />
been more oriented towards Europe than t cverds the Pacific, should<br />
now under your Leadership be showing increased interest, increased<br />
desire to understand, increased desire to help those countries whom you<br />
have described as countries which live on the rim of the Pacific.<br />
We are delighted that this interest is extending to the Pacific and to<br />
the countries of South-East Asia, because here is another great<br />
opportunity for two countries such as ours to help, to the top of our<br />
bent, in a region which must be of interest to us both. For our own<br />
part, what happens in South-East Asia is cf continuing concern for us<br />
for we live on the perimeter of it. For your part, , ou are now showing<br />
an interest there too, and if I may say so, Sir, I believe that in doing<br />
that you are play: ing the part of a world statesman for what happens in<br />
Asia in the future and what happens to their people in the future could<br />
well decide the future peace and progress of the world as a whole.<br />
For all these reasons, Sir, for the thinge -we have in<br />
common, the problems we have in common, the ways we can help each<br />
other, the interests we are now having in common in this part of the<br />
world, we are delighted to welcome you, we hope you will come back<br />
and I beli eve that this visit will show that during the decade of the<br />
seventies, our two countries will1, in a region of interest to both of<br />
us, help other people, and by doing that, help the world in general.<br />
So you are welcome, Sir. </p>
