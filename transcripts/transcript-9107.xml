EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KFATING, MP<br />
TO THE UK/ AUSTRALIA TRADE AND INVESTMENT CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOUIMN, 27 JANUARY 1994<br />
Mr Premier and Mis Kennctt, Mr arnd Mrs Hescltine, Sir Derek Hornby, ministcrial<br />
colleagues, Indies and gcntleinea.<br />
I an prateful for the opportunity to open this very important conference.<br />
And let me begi b~ cxtcnding to our guests from the Ulnited Kingdom a vcry wam<br />
wecmet a-thank you for coming.<br />
For those who Interpret the cumrnt debastc about our constitutional arrangements; a3<br />
marking a decline in the rclationship betweeut our two coutres this coinferice offers a<br />
timely corrective.<br />
It is further proof that, far from declining, the relationship has reached a new level of<br />
maturity. It should surprise no one that in 1994 we Australians are debating questions of identity<br />
and sovcrclinry and, because it Is germanec to the debate, our rcmainWig constitutional<br />
links with The United Kingdom.<br />
And it should surprise no one that last night His Royal Highness also formally rcwoised<br />
the truth of this it should not surprise us because few Englishmen have taken such a<br />
close interest in Australia for such a ton&amp; time and few, I suspe~ ct, have such a sympathetic<br />
understanding of the issues which concern us.<br />
These debates reflect nothing more or less than recognition of a chartfing rcality. And the<br />
pivotal change Is thc change in our trading and investment relationship.<br />
That is why this conference comes at such a stratcgic moment it undcrlincs the<br />
unarguable, but little appreciated. fact that the business relationship between our two<br />
countries is stronger than it has bcn for many years and it has the potential to grow much<br />
stronger. It underineis thc fact that our new more independent relationship is mutually rewarding.<br />
It is, to quote Mir Major just a year a~ o, a " new relationship which is well suited to the late<br />
twcntieth century and which holds pentzy of promise for the future".<br />
A new relationship which builds on our common heritage, cultural and institutional<br />
ajffinities and substantial commercial links, while acknowlcdging that the direction of<br />
policy in each country has, of necessity, changed. </p>
<p>To put It in the baldcst terms: as Europe has been to Britain in the last twenty five years<br />
the Asia Pacific has been to Australia in the last decade namely, the place where our<br />
principal interess lie, the placc whert out future lies, thc place where Australia simply<br />
had to find a role.<br />
As N&amp; r Ma jor said " it is perfectly natural for two nations on Opposite sides of the world to<br />
dcvclop distinctive characters, to carvc out paillcular roles in t heir own regions, to pursue<br />
policies which promote their own economic interest-.."<br />
Therc is no doubt that this is much imore widely und erstood and ac~ ptcd than it was even<br />
a year or two ago.<br />
But much less understood, I am sure, is the degree to which the pursuit of our own<br />
interests creates clmplemcmna interests~ and considerable new potential for both of us.<br />
The tact is, the maturing and modernisation of our relationship has enlivened and<br />
enlarged it.<br />
And I might add I am in no doubt that maturing and modernising our constitutional<br />
relationship would have a similar effect.<br />
Lct me quote a few flgures to illustrate the strength of the economic relationship;<br />
IlTe UK is Australia's fourth largest trading partner<br />
our largest services trade partner<br />
our eIl1ith largest export Miarkcet<br />
our third largest source of imports<br />
our fastest growing European export markct<br />
ou thid l rgest souceof tourist<br />
our sccond ;~ reintvfreisnto r<br />
* out second largest destination for investment<br />
our largest foreign investor in manufacturing<br />
The exciting dimension to this profile is, of course, the change in the na= a of<br />
investment.<br />
No longer do British firms invest in Australia because they can get behind tariff wail in<br />
order to scrvice the domestic market.<br />
No longer does Austialia have such a tariff wall.<br />
1instead, Australia has the confidence and ability to compete Internationally in<br />
manufacturing and services, just as we have done for many years in agricultural an~ d<br />
mining products.<br />
The Australian domestic marqct continues to attract British investment becuse, with our<br />
population steadily increasing, the market is expandig.<br />
But today British firms along with firms fromn other countries also invest here because<br />
they know they can compete internationally [ loin an Australian base. I<br />
And, in particular, they know that Australia is an ideal beachhead for thc most dynamic<br />
markets in the world the Asia-Pacific markvis.<br />
Some of you will have sccn in today's Financial Review a summary of a report by Clayton<br />
Utz called Doing Business ut Auvrrafia. The report details just how attractive the<br />
Australian beachhead is. For Instance: </p>
<p>27. Jan. 94 18: 09 No. 008 P. 04/ 08<br />

Operatjngf costs are 40 to 105 per cant cheaper than Singapore. 105 to 286 per cent<br />
cheaper th~ an Hong Kong.<br />
E DO phone costs arc 50 to 85 per cent cheaper than Singapore, up to S0 pcr cent<br />
cheaper than Hong Kong.<br />
Managerial costs are substantially lower.<br />
We have a distinct skills base advantage.<br />
Thet report concludes: " Looking ahead five to ten yemr and beyond, one camiot be other<br />
than optimistic about Australia's future."<br />
And that is the truth of the matter.<br />
The simple fact is that we are a low cost, efficient location for business.<br />
And a low tLx location last year the corporate rate was reduced to 20%, along with<br />
provision6 -accelecrated dcprcciation, an investmnent allowance of up to 30 per cent, and a<br />
150 per cent tax concession for research and developmnent expenditure.<br />
Australia's real unit labour costs are almost ten per cent lower than a decade ago and our<br />
labodumarktsa6re infinitely more flexible and responsive.<br />
Today you may have read that the Australian company, Transficid, outbid all othtdw&gt;*<br />
international competitors for the construction of a $ 80 million oil and gas platform In<br />
Bass Strait.<br />
And the pr'nIpa reason for their success was a benciuark enterprise agrceree which<br />
cut costs by 16 per cent by increasing labour and equipmnt efficiency.<br />
Australia has frec-financial markets operating in the Eas Asia time zone, sophisticated<br />
cost efficient telecommunications and highly developed linkages into the countries of the<br />
Asia Pacific.<br />
For all these reason an ineroasing number of companies arc now making Australia their<br />
springboard ito those Asia Pacific markets companies like Cathay Pacific, Data<br />
General, Microsoft, Dow Corning and Kellogg wbich have located their regional<br />
headquarters here.<br />
Bniih companies arc doing the same. A recent Australian British Chamber of<br />
Commerce study found that eighy per cent of the companies surveyed were using their<br />
local subsidiaries to servicce oflier markets in the region.<br />
Almost half use their subsidiaries as a springboard into South-East Asia. and more than<br />
twenty per cent are using them as a basi. Tor operations In NJ6iihthEst Asia.<br />
Behind these trends we can find individual comipanties positioning thcmsclves for the<br />
futurc. For instance, British Airways' 25 per cent holding in Qantas will givc it improved access<br />
to the Asia-Pacific region and provide Qantas with an opportunity to boost its presence in<br />
world markets, including Europe.<br />
To qjuote a few other examples: </p>
<p>4<br />
Cadbury Schwepps Is doubling its capacity with a view to supplying the Asia-<br />
Pacific which happens to be the fastest growing chocolate market in the World<br />
Vodafone has decided to establish its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Sydney.<br />
British Telecom will locate its Asia-Pacific Centre for Nctwork Management and a<br />
software enineering centre in Sydney.<br />
Tate and Lyle, United Biscuits, B3Th, ICI, BP Oil, Bond Helicopters among othets<br />
arc all using Australia as a base for their trade with the region, and<br />
demonstrating beyond doubt that this is a competitive and cost effective country in<br />
which to do business.<br />
Meanwhile thc implementation of the single market in Europe and further economic<br />
integration promotrd by Maastricht has created opportuinities for Australian companies to<br />
expand their operations in Europe, using the United Kingdom as a base.<br />
I imigine it would surprise a lot of Australians to know that Australia is the fourth largSt<br />
investor int ( he UK a larger Investor in fact than Japan and that the increase between,<br />
1984 and 1992 was fourteen fold.<br />
Uf it is true to say that in recent years Australia has bcoeon a good place to do business, it<br />
is equally true that ia' 1994 and the years to corn it is going to be an even better place.<br />
Over bho twelve mnths to the September quartcr, Australian G3DP increased by abut<br />
three and a half per cent. I<br />
Some commentators think Qiat we will see growth rates reaching four per cent or more<br />
before too ln&amp; and I believe they arc right. I believe we are now well placed to grow at<br />
four par cent orniare for a number of years.<br />
At the same timec the OE~ CD is looking at a rate fur this yea of two per cent-<br />
We have had inflation of two per cent or less for the past two years, and TuLsday's figures<br />
confzm our ability to keep it ainong the lowest in the OECD.<br />
Where once we survived on the margins of the world's most dynamnic mnarkets, we are<br />
now strategically placed alongside them and increasingly integrated 2aih thenm.<br />
But as Max Walsh pointed out today in the qydrMami Anrlerald even Max has<br />
acknowledged it now -the grwth we are achieving, like the new role we are carilng out<br />
to the Asial-Pacifc,' did not bappen by accident.<br />
We have been achieving out current growth rates despite a very weak world economy,<br />
and with a business sector more concerned with clawing back debt than looking for new<br />
investment opportunities.<br />
The Frowth can be directly traced to the stimulus lower interest rates provided in the<br />
housing market, the strength in exports flowing from the lower dollar, and the direct boost<br />
to spending we provided through the Budget.<br />
lntc-rcst rates are now at their lowest levels for 20 years.<br />
We are now around 30 per cent more internationally competitive than a decade ago.<br />
And, since the Oiic Nation statement of Febr-uar-y 1992, we have pTovidcd stimulus from<br />
the Budget equivalcnt to more than two per cent of GDP. T2E7L:. Jan. 94 18: 09 No. 008 P. 05/ 08 </p>
<p>TEL: 27. Jan. 94 18: 09 No. 008 P. 06/ 08<br />
Out of respect for our British guJests I will Dot record here the unending criticism of these<br />
pol icies we have rceived from the Opposition, some business groups and many in the<br />
financial pres".<br />
The figures speak for themselvcs.<br />
But what also Should be spokeni for i the fact that Government policies havc provided<br />
more than short term stimulus: by focussing on the skills of our people, on infratructure,<br />
reschb and incentives for business investuient, they are providing long term benefits to<br />
the operation of the economy and tho opurations of business.<br />
Renlly, the time has come, I think Australian business ought to recoonse that the<br />
present recovery andC the outstanding prospects for the futurc have been made possible by<br />
these policies and policies implemented in the eighties.<br />
Long experience tells mc it is pointless to expect the equivalent of a Faullan coaversion<br />
among Australian business I can assure our British guests that political affctions die A'S<br />
hard In the New World as they do in the Old.<br />
Despite the logic of it. I don't expect to see a niass defection from our increasingly<br />
Inchoate and rudderless political opponents.<br />
But I do expect, and I think it is reasonable for the country to expect, that Austalioa<br />
business will iucrtasingly go out and invest in those areas which will deliver long teTm<br />
riewards to their companies and the pation.<br />
I mean investment in plant, in technology and in people in trining and employment.<br />
Thc capsary to do it is theire: In the past year profits have grown 20 per cent and are now<br />
above t I9M peak. As a Share of GDP, profit share is now approaching rhc peak of the<br />
Late 19WVs and that was an all-time record.<br />
As volumes pick up in the recovery, profits will increase further.<br />
Those who made the effort to export in recent times are today reaping very substantial<br />
rewards.<br />
Those who make the effort now will also reap them as the markets grow.<br />
And the markets till grow'. They will grow in no small measure because of the<br />
successful conclusion to the GAIT; and, in due course, because of the substantial work<br />
now underway in AYEC to remove barriers and facilitate trade and investment in the<br />
. re gion. 1<br />
You are all awarce of the role the Australian Covenimerir played with the U~ rupuy Round<br />
and thc creation-of APEC.<br />
And I can assure you that implementing the GAIT outcome, achieving concrete results in<br />
APEC, and removing bilateral barriers to trade Will continue as issues of the highest<br />
priority for the Ccwcrnnient in the comning year.<br />
Our major domcsiic priority this year might go under the simplc heading of " efficiency*.<br />
We will bc working vcry hard on the microcconurmic reformu agenda; pullinS together the<br />
rail, port, road interface; driving the enterprise bargaining prograili as hard as we and<br />
y'ou can; and implementing the White Paper on employment.<br />
We will be dcveloping and refining industry policy. </p>
<p>27. Jan. 94 18: 09 No. 008 P. 07/ 08<br />

Our industry policies bcar no resemblance to those of earlicr decades.<br />
N~ o longer are inefficient industies protected<br />
Rather, policy is directed at helping industry grasp new opportunities at borne and in the<br />
world trading envirowncut.<br />
The transport pro*= az we undertook almost two year ago in One Nation particularly<br />
the national rail highway has begun to rnatcrialisc, and you wilt see it materialise much<br />
more rapidly in the next teve months.<br />
Our industrial relations reforms demand your cooperation and that of the unions.<br />
Cooperation demands recognition of realities.<br />
Onc of those realities is known to every Australian business leader in this room.<br />
It is that Australian workers have made a maslive contribution to the greater<br />
comnpetitiveness of this country, and that the results wc at.. now seeinig, the opportunities<br />
now presented, would have becti impossible without the trade unions' willingniess to<br />
cooperate in necessary change indeed, oftcn to dK Uv the change.<br />
Tht Accord between the Goveninent and organised labour, in place now for 11<br />
Succ= Ssivc years, has beena instrumental in giving us sustained industrial peace, low<br />
hnflation and the profit share which business is now enjoying.<br />
The unions of course must continue to embrace change.<br />
I noticed tho other day the ACTU President, Martin Ferguson, urging unions to move<br />
more quickly towards enterprise bargains.<br />
Today I urge Australian business to do thc same. 17hc new industrial relations legisation<br />
ensures that minimum standards are maintained, but provides for great flexibility.<br />
EAch and every business = a now tailor its arrangements to meet its business P. eeds and<br />
each and every business this year should make the effort to do so.<br />
Many will want to strike their deals with unions, but there is no imperative. As lone as a<br />
mnajority of employees want to, management can negotiate directly with thcir employees<br />
rather than with unions.<br />
I said yesterday that this recovery is not for the top end of town. Our hard work has not<br />
been for the benefit of speculators and fly-by-night developers.<br />
It has been to create a competitive economy of depth andqu ulizy which will assure<br />
Australia's prosperity in the next century. it has been to deliver opportunity to every<br />
community and every Australian.<br />
The responsibility is on businem. as well 4s government to see that this great opportunity<br />
is not wasted.<br />
Togcther wc also share responsibility for employment and training. There is surely no<br />
greater inhibition to national efficiency than a large pool of unemployed men and women.<br />
The White Paper to be delivered in April will form thie basis of a major strategic assault<br />
on Australia's unctrployment. </p>
<p>TEL: 27. Jan. 94 18: 09 No. 008 P. 08/ 08<br />
I 7<br />
The emphasis will be on putting the long term unemployed back In touch with the labour<br />
market. Education and training will be a priority.<br />
In short, our approach to unemployment will be to give those presently uncmployed a<br />
chance to share in the new prosperity and to contribute to it.<br />
In doing so the whole nation's economic performance will be that much morc cfficient.<br />
If this is to be what it should be a recovery for the whole nation the responsibility falls<br />
on the whole nation to make it so.<br />
For this reason above any otha I am pleased to be with you tonight. This conference ca<br />
be anothcr step on the road to greater prosperity for the people of both our countries.<br />
Today the relationship between the Unitcd Kingdom and Australia is built on both<br />
continuity and change.<br />
The continuity of 205 years of shared history, culture, investment and trade.<br />
The chanse in which we are both engagcd, the change which offers us extraordinary new<br />
opportunities at home and abroad and the change which will, without doubt, ensure that<br />
our relationship is stron and enduring.<br />
