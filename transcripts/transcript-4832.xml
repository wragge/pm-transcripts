    <content><![CDATA[<p>24 Sept. 1978<br />
I congratulate Mr. Kerin on his return to the<br />
Federal Parliament.<br />
While not detracting from Mr. Kerin's convincing win,<br />
the outcome should be seen in perspective.<br />
Werriwa is one of the safest Labor seats in New Wouth Wales<br />
and over the past 26 years Mr. Whitlam's primary vote<br />
has been as high as 69 percent.<br />
It is blue-ribbon seat for the A. L. P. and they were<br />
inevitably assisted by the traditional by-election swing<br />
against the Government of the day.<br />
This year the Government has been forced to make some difficult<br />
decisions in the long-term interests of the nation.<br />
It has shown it is not prepared to shirk its responsibilities<br />
for the sake of short-term political gains.<br />
The Liberal candidate for Werriwa, Mr. Sadl er, is to<br />
be congratulated for a spirited conte . t and I now wish<br />
him well in his campaigning for the N. S. W. State Elections.<br />
