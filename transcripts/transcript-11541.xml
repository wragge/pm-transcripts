<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>We welcome the Prime Minister John Howard. John, thank you so much for</p>
<p> being the first guest of the new century.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well thanks very much John. Good evening to you and your listeners.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Was it a rough day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, entirely predictable. Bronwyn was asked every question from the Opposition.</p>
<p> She answered them. It's a difficult issue this because nursing homes</p>
<p> is a sensitive emotional issue and everybody was incredibly distressed</p>
<p> about those stories regarding the use of kerosene. We have about probably,</p>
<p> what, three-four thousand nursing homes in Australia. The great bulk of</p>
<p> them are wonderful institutions - always have been always will be. You'll</p>
<p> get a few that don't come up to scratch and the department has taken</p>
<p> action in relation to the Riverside Home. And the patients there have</p>
<p> been moved to one run by the Sisters of Charity at St Vincents in Melbourne</p>
<p> and I thank them for helping in this very difficult situation.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, it did take a long time however for the action to be</p>
<p> taken. 56 days since that Riverside story was first discussed and discusses</p>
<p> openly. It's a very very long time for people who have to continue</p>
<p> suffering it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Minister herself acted with incredible speed once she knew about</p>
<p> it. To be fair to her....</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well if we knew about it 56 days ago, assumably she did know about. Is</p>
<p> 56 days.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as soon as she got the information she acted. Now there are certain</p>
<p> legal rights that the licensee of a nursing home has, and all along people</p>
<p> have been calling for her to make preemptive statements. And she's</p>
<p> been very careful not to do that so as not to prejudice the steps that</p>
<p> are being taken.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>So you believe that the delay's excusable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I believe that the Minister has acted appropriately, and promptly.</p>
<p> Clearly the procedures that have been put in place didn't work as</p>
<p> they should of, and she of course as the Minster is setting about ensuring</p>
<p> that that doesn't occur in the future. But the character of modern</p>
<p> government is such that one particular flaw in a departmental procedure</p>
<p> can't automatically mean that the Minister has got to resign. On</p>
<p> that basis you have in any government anywhere in the world you'd</p>
<p> have ministers on a daily resignation basis.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah. But just going back to the period of time it took and given the</p>
<p> reputation that Riverside had, and I talked to Bronwyn Bishop earlier</p>
<p> today, and there had been complaints coming in about it since 1984 I think.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>1988, yes.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well certainly since 1986, and many of them she was saying the previous</p>
<p> government didn't do anything about it. But when she took the job</p>
<p> or when you took the job, collectively as a group you should have looked</p>
<p> at that surely and said well hang on, here's one we've got to</p>
<p> look at. Why weren't spot checks carried out....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there were, there were, this was raised in Parliament today. There</p>
<p> were a whole series of contacts between the department and this particular</p>
<p> home stretching over a period of time. And the view had been taken that</p>
<p> over a period of time it would be a good idea to get the home up to higher</p>
<p> standards. And you've got to remember in these situations John that</p>
<p> there are pluses and minuses about revoking a home's licence to operate.</p>
<p> People don't like being moved and of course I think it's been</p>
<p> evident today that some of the concern expressed by people who are being</p>
<p> moved. These things are very difficult, they're very sensitive. I</p>
<p> understand the hurt and the trauma of relatives and of the elderly people</p>
<p> themselves. As I say you are bound, in a large system, you are bound to</p>
<p> have some that don't come up to scratch and it's the responsibility</p>
<p> of the department and the government to ensure that the procedures work</p>
<p> as well as possible.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah, but given that Riverside had many many complaints leveled against</p>
<p> it, and according to the Minister when she talked to me today said that</p>
<p> it was brought back to standard and then it would slip away again. Why</p>
<p> wasn't it constantly checked? And given also that there were 4,000</p>
<p> complaints and very [inaudible]. I'm not against the [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah well those....no, no, no. Well many of those complaints were</p>
<p> relatively minor. Not minor to the people making them but in the overall</p>
<p> scheme of things. And the great bulk of them according to the Minister</p>
<p> in Parliament today have been resolved. I mean in the end the best policy</p>
<p> with something like this is if a complaint is made is to talk to the people</p>
<p> and try to get them to bring their standards up to scratch. And it's</p>
<p> only as a last resort should you do as the delegate of the Minister did</p>
<p> today, and that is suspend funding a revoke a licence.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>There has also been talk that if some of these people had moved that</p>
<p> in fact could be life threatening. What do you do about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is one of the reasons why you don't hastily decide to</p>
<p> close down a home or move people. I mean that is the very point I make</p>
<p> that what you must try and do in these circumstances is to eradicate the</p>
<p> unacceptable practice and to bring things up to a proper standard.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>But you obviously think 56 days is not too long.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I didn't say that. Clearly the system has not worked as well</p>
<p> as it should have and Bronwyn has said that. But what I do say in relation</p>
<p> to her own personal knowledge of the matter she acted with great speed</p>
<p> once she heard about it and has applied herself quite single mindedly</p>
<p> ever since.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>The people feel very strongly about it and I believe the place is being</p>
<p> picketed now and a number of residences have been moved, and there have</p>
<p> been complaints, very vocal complaints for a number of weeks about it.</p>
<p> Somebody's got to be responsible. Who's accountable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well John, I'm not going to sort of make judgements on the run about</p>
<p> that. I've been in Parliament for most of the last few hours. We've</p>
<p> been sitting, we've been having Question Time. I haven't been</p>
<p> brought up to date on everything that's happened this afternoon.</p>
<p> But John the correct procedures are being put in place. The Minister has</p>
<p> I believe given a very good account of her own actions. As far as the</p>
<p> residents are concerned it ought to be our major concern as a result of</p>
<p> the decision taken by the delegate this morning. Those people have been,</p>
<p> or are in the process of being moved to another nursing home. Now time</p>
<p> will allow other examinations to be made by the Minister about what went</p>
<p> wrong in relation to the system. Her main concern in recent days has been</p>
<p> to ensure that the best procedure is applied in relation to the residents</p>
<p> in this particular home.</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>Is it possible that Riverside will reopen and operate again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know. It's not possible for me to say at this</p>
<p> stage. All I can tell you is that the licence has been taken away and</p>
<p> the funding has been suspended. I have to be careful what I say because</p>
<p> there are rights and interests involved here and I've got to be careful.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I understand. Families and some residents don't want to move.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's, this highlights the awful dilemma of this. It is very</p>
<p> easy for an Opposition, or a media to say it's terrible and to run</p>
<p> an emotional campaign and I understand that. But we have to make the decisions</p>
<p> and many people don't want to move. There are many people who feel</p>
<p> the disturbance of their elderly relatives being moved, is worse than</p>
<p> any alternative. And I understand that, that's why these judgements</p>
<p> are difficult and that's why they should not be arbitrarily arrived</p>
<p> at.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>But that's not the reason for the 56 day delay?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are a number of circumstances to be investigated in relation</p>
<p> to that and once again I am not going to make a . . .</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>But they will be investigated?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look John, the Minister is investigating this thing from start to finish.</p>
<p> She was clearly concerned about the system not having worked effectively.</p>
<p> She took steps to act very rapidly herself once she found out about it.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Did you ask her to cancel the television appearance on Sunday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, the question of whether people appear on a particular program is</p>
<p> something that happens day in and day out in relation to a whole lot of</p>
<p> things. I talk to and my office talks to her a great deal, I am not going</p>
<p> into the details of that.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>So you not going to tell me about . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no what I am going to say to you John is that you know as newsman</p>
<p> that there are a lot of contacts between offices about television appearances</p>
<p> and the idea that the most important thing in this is whether Bronwyn</p>
<p> appears on a particular television program, it may be a fascination of</p>
<p> the media, but it's not her major concern. And I don't think</p>
<p> anybody could accuse her of having been a reluctant appearer on television</p>
<p> last week on this issue or indeed generally. She's been very available,</p>
<p> very accountable and I think very up front about the whole thing.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes, well she was quite happy to talk on the radio program today. And</p>
<p> I don't really think there would have been anything wrong with it</p>
<p> if you had have advised her not to go on it, would there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well John I'm not going to go into that. I have a lot of contact</p>
<p> with my ministers about a lot of things and I can't go into all the</p>
<p> details. All I do say is that my contact with her on those sorts of matters</p>
<p> are always appropriate.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Should she resign?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. This is ridiculous. This is, it is a very difficult, sensitive issue</p>
<p> but to say on the basis of this she ought to resign is just ridiculous</p>
<p> and I certainly don't for a moment think that. I think she has handled</p>
<p> something that's very awkward, very difficult, very sad for the people</p>
<p> concerned, very disturbing for the patients and the relatives with a great</p>
<p> deal of sincerity and candour. And can I just say the other thing that</p>
<p> is very important that the overwhelming bulk of the nursing homes in Australia</p>
<p> operate, they have always operated very well. The overwhelming bulk of</p>
<p> them operated very well under the previous government and they operate</p>
<p> very well under the current government. And most people in the nursing</p>
<p> home industry are professional and dedicated and caring men and women</p>
<p> and I think we've got to keep something like this in a proper perspective.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I agree with you. We will have a short break here and I will talk further</p>
<p> with our Prime Minister John Howard.</p>
<p>[break]</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for staying with us. My special guest is the Prime</p>
<p> Minister of Australia, John Howard. John, you were admired by many Australians</p>
<p> when you admitted that you couldn't keep the deadline for reconciliation.</p>
<p> Geoff Clarke said that it was an honest admission of failure. Did you</p>
<p> see it as failure?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I just saw it as being realistic. I'm still very committed to</p>
<p> reconciliation, but I don't think we should get hung up about the</p>
<p> 27th of May which is when the Reconciliation Council presents</p>
<p> its document. Nor should we get hung up by the 31st of December</p>
<p> when we're meant to respond. Nor indeed should we see reconciliation</p>
<p> as being achieved or defined by a document, it is something that is going</p>
<p> to take a long time. We are making more progress than many of the activists</p>
<p> acknowledge. But we just have to understand that it is a very long process</p>
<p> and it is not achieved by symbolic deeds, it is achieved by patient progress</p>
<p> in a whole number of areas.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>What do you believe does need in a sentence if you can, does need to</p>
<p> be reconciled?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What needs to be changed is the relative disadvantage in health, housing,</p>
<p> education and employment of Aboriginal Australians.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Did you make the date, because I rather suspect you did, I hope I am</p>
<p> right, in the moment of euphoria on election night? Was it something you</p>
<p> . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I didn't actually, I mean the main December dates are in the</p>
<p> Act that was passed in 1991. And what I did on election night was commit</p>
<p> myself to the process of achieving reconciliation by the Centenary of</p>
<p> Federation. Now, I meant that, I wanted to . . . I didn't think so</p>
<p> much about the minute detail, I wanted to commit my Government to the</p>
<p> goal of reconciliation and it's still committed. But what I am saying</p>
<p> now is that if we don't have every I' dotted and every</p>
<p> T' crossed by May or December and we certainly won't then</p>
<p> we shouldn't see the process as having finished or indeed as having</p>
<p> failed. I think it is something that will go on for some time. And I want</p>
<p> to see a greater harmony between different sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community and I think that is best achieved by honestly and patiently</p>
<p> trying to remove areas of disadvantage, not by symbolic gestures which</p>
<p> can mean different things to different people.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Four years as Prime Minister. Is the GST the biggest risk you've</p>
<p> taken?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I think the, in political terms perhaps, but more importantly in national</p>
<p> and human terms I think the Timor commitment because it involved the risking</p>
<p> of lives of young Australian men and women. And that weighed far more</p>
<p> heavily on me, for that reason than anything else.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Could you believe your luck when Kim Beazley started to work you over</p>
<p> on the GST? He didn't handle it very well did he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he handled it very badly, but the reason that he handled it badly</p>
<p> John is that he doesn't have an alternative policy. I mean in the</p>
<p> end if you don't have a thought out policy no matter how propitious</p>
<p> you might think the politics of it are, you get caught out and then .</p>
<p> . . we do have a policy and we've done the hard yards. We've</p>
<p> won an election. We've taken our lumps on the difficult bits of the</p>
<p> GST and very soon on the 1st of July people will start getting</p>
<p> the $47 a week tax cut for an average family and the abolished provisional</p>
<p> tax cuts and all the other provisional tax, all the other benefits that</p>
<p> are going to flow.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Has it been a lack of understanding of those tax cuts that have caused</p>
<p> people to be as critical as they have been of the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think it is inevitable. Everything that has happened in relation</p>
<p> to the scare campaign I expected. And I expect the scare campaign more</p>
<p> or less to go on until the 1st of July. People inherently believe</p>
<p> the negatives and tend to mistrust or remain unconvinced about the positives</p>
<p> until they actually arrive.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>One final question. Is that sweet Honeycomb really a duck destroyer?</p>
<p> Surely not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no I, it's a wicked rumour. I asked him last night. It is a</p>
<p> wicked rumour. He's a very fond resident of Kirribilli House.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Thank you Prime Minister very much for your time and for doing us the</p>
<p> honour of being on our first program.</p>
