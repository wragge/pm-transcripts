PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY TIlE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES, TIlE UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND,<br />
FRANCE AND MONACO<br />
I am pleased to announce that arrangements have been made for me to visit the<br />
United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Monaco from II to 24<br />
September. My visit to Washington will provide a valuable opportunity to reaffirm with the<br />
Clinton Administration and Congressional leaders the vitality and relevance of<br />
the Australia-United States relationship during a period of great fluidity in<br />
international relations. Fundamental Australian interests are engaged in the<br />
defence alliance, strong enonomic ties and processes of policy consultation we<br />
enjoy with the United States. Australia welcomes recent public statements by<br />
President Clinton about US determination to stay engaged strategically in the<br />
Asia-Pacific region and the strong support he has given to the Asia-Pacific<br />
Economic Cooperation ( APEC) process. I look forward to, in particular,<br />
exchanging views with President Clinton on the informal meeting of APEC<br />
leaders he proposes to host in Seattle in November this year.<br />
The United States is Australia's second largest export market billion in<br />
1992) and largest source of imports ($ 12.4 billion). It is also the largest source<br />
of foreign investment in Australia and the most important destination for<br />
Australian direct investment abroad.<br />
Following a two-day program in Washington, I will visit New York where I<br />
shall be meeting with UN Secretary-General Boutros Ghai to discuss the role<br />
of the United Nations in the post-Cold War era and Australia's participation in<br />
UN activities.<br />

In London, I expect to have extensive discussions with Prime Minister Major<br />
on a range of bilateral and international issues of importance to both countries.<br />
The visit will provide an opportunity to underline the Australian Government's<br />
commitment to maintaining a warm and cooperative relationship with Britain<br />
at a time when the external policies of both countries are increasingly oriented<br />
towards their respective regions, and at a time when there is increasing interest<br />
in proposals to amend our constitutional arrangements so as to allow us to have<br />
an Australian head of state.<br />
Britain remains one of Australia's most important economic partners. It is<br />
Australia's eighth largest export market billion in 1992) and third largest<br />
source of imports billion). Britain is also our third largest source of<br />
foreign investment and the second most important destination for Australian<br />
direct investment abroad.<br />
Following an official program in London, I shall visit Balmoral Castle in<br />
Scotland for a private meeting with Her Majesty the Queen.<br />
My visit to Ireland will build on the good will generated by high-level Irish<br />
visits to Australia including, most recently, by President Mary Rohinson. I<br />
look forward to reaffirming the strong community fink-sbefiveeh Australia and<br />
Ireland and to discussing with the Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, and his<br />
Government a range of international economic and political issues of interest to<br />
both countries. I have also been invited to address the National Dail<br />
( Parliament) in Dublin.<br />
I shall have an opportunity to make a very brief visit to the village of Villers-<br />
Bretonneux in Northern France to pay my respects on the 75th anniver'sary of<br />
the decisive campaigns of 1918 in the final months of the First World War. I<br />
particularly want to thank the people of Villers-Bretonneux for the close<br />
friendship they have maintained with Australia since those days.<br />
Before returning to Australia, I shall visit Monaco to take part in the formal<br />
presentation of Sydney's bid to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000.<br />
