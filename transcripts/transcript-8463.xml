SPEECH TO THE IRISH-AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,<br />
ST PATRICK'S DAY BREAKFAST, MELBOURNE<br />
17 MARCH 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much Gerry, Padric Flynn, Your Grace<br />
Archbishop Little, Joan Kirner, Martin Burke, the Irish<br />
Ambassador, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here this morning on<br />
St Patrick's Day. I stayed last night in the Windsor Hotel<br />
in Bob Menzies' old suite, contemplating St Patrick's Day,<br />
and I thought I heard the chandelier moving, and I certainly<br />
saw the wall-paper curl from the walls revealing a sort of<br />
1950s look and beyond it. And I thought of that remark that<br />
was passed so long ago when another famous person was lying<br />
in his deathbed, another Irishman's deathbed in a Paris<br />
hotel, and hie said either something has got to give here,<br />
either the wallpaper or me. And of course, it was him. And<br />
the wallpaper reminded me of that particular occasion in the<br />
Windsor Hotel. But the temptation on St Patrick's Day is, I<br />
think, always to trivialise the Irish. I'm not having a<br />
shot at you Brian, not having a shot at the comedians, but<br />
it is nice to0 be here with the Irish Chamber of Commerce for<br />
the breakfast because it does reflect upon what Ireland does<br />
export. And what Ireland exports to the world is nothing<br />
trivial. It: is everything that counts, its Guiness, poetry,<br />
passion, prose, and politics, and of course people, people<br />
who have shaped nations. And as Padric said, and as Gerry<br />
said, Australia without the Irish, a reflect on it would be<br />
unimaginable!. In fact Australia without the Irish would be<br />
unthinkable, Australians without the Irish would be<br />
unspeakable. For the Irish in Australia have been the fount of Australian<br />
nationalism. It is a bit like Oscar Wilde himself in that hotel room,<br />
that rare combination of folley and mobility, are the Irish.<br />
The jokers in the pack, but also the adventurers, the<br />
lifeblood of the place, the people who know all about<br />
I </p>
<p>independence and its importance. And it is one of the<br />
reasons why ZIll value that history of Ireland by the<br />
Keatings, Padric, that you've given me this morning.<br />
Indeed, my remarks a couple of weeks ago which Gerry refers<br />
to about independence from England, struck a cord with the<br />
Irish press and in Ireland, which I was very surprised at.<br />
I doubt if any two cultures were more fundamentally opposed<br />
than the Irish and the English, in religion, in tradition,<br />
and more part~ icularly in history. Irish history, once you<br />
got passed the Celtic legends, was the history of never<br />
ending resist~ ance to England. In Australia, as Robert<br />
Hughes put it: in his recent work, ' The Fatal Shore', he said<br />
the Irish felt twice colonised, doubly aggrieved.<br />
The remarkable thing is that an Australian identity emerged<br />
from these two broad streams, the English and the Irish, and<br />
of course I t~ hink we must say three, put the Scots in there<br />
as well. In other words, even before post-war European<br />
migration, before we regarded ourselves as having presided<br />
over a multicultural triumph. We in fact pulled off a<br />
multicultural triumph ourselves. An idea that Australia had<br />
been formed out of a traditional difference in hostility.<br />
And it is an amazing to think about that, that Australia as<br />
a nation before our post-war program was formed out of these<br />
peoples with traditional differences and hostilities. An<br />
idea that suggested that Australia was a country wit~ h a<br />
separate destiny, a separate future, and of course a<br />
separate past:.<br />
In 1992, I think two lessons present themselves to me. The<br />
first, that is to turn our multicultural society into an<br />
Australian strength which is becoming, which it will. become.<br />
In second, to recognise that our destiny is separate. That<br />
ours is bound to-be a destiny which is separate. Being<br />
clear to ourselves and the world that we mean to make our<br />
own way, a feeling which will be very important, the<br />
harnessing of national will, reviewing our confidence and<br />
pride in ourselves, including that sort of pride which lifts<br />
us beyond social ' hatred against the original Australians,<br />
the Aboriginals-That manifestation of a feeling which will<br />
give us a much more powerful identity in the world as well.<br />
I said a few things recently about the flag, but let me say<br />
this. We've got to be certain of who we are to take our<br />
place in the world, and we can't fly two symbols wit~ h our<br />
nation for much longer.<br />
A nation is eternally uncertain about its representational<br />
image is of course a nation uncertain about itself. I spent<br />
a decade trying to transform the Australian economy, Brian<br />
remarked on it earlier, to make it a country with an<br />
international economic ambition. It became increasingly<br />
plain to me lthat'another kind of transformation is<br />
necessary, a social transformation, a mental transformation,<br />
because we ar. e not going to make it simply by getting the<br />
nuts and bolts together, by getting the macro-economy right,<br />
or Joan and me getting the railways right, or something else </p>
<p>right, we won't ever get it right until we get that mental<br />
transformation that Australia is a country of its own<br />
character. Australia is a country which will make its own<br />
way in the world. That's the transformation we need to<br />
really pull off our internationalisation, our true<br />
independence. Recent events have made that quite clear to me. The uproar<br />
when I made those quite unexceptional remarks to Queen<br />
Elizabeth on her recent visit. The same sentiments which<br />
have left this country always hesitating, always drawing<br />
back, always missing the main chance, never seizing our own<br />
history. Well that's the one thing the Irish can teach us,<br />
their history and their destiny is forever their own and as<br />
always remains forever Ireland's.<br />
But when it said in Australia that the contribution we made<br />
to Britain in World War I was not returned in full in World<br />
War II when an Australian view is expressed scandal and<br />
outrage. Yet those who care to consult the histories, even<br />
those written by Englishmen, will find that it's not wrong<br />
or even indeed those who recently consult the Financial<br />
Times or the Guardian or the London Times, will find that it<br />
was not wrong. Yet my dissatisfaction and disaffection is<br />
not with Britain or the British, it is with those who cannot<br />
find it in themselves to speak with an unashamed and<br />
wholehearted Australian voice, who not only fail at the<br />
essential task to grasp the future but will not even grasp<br />
the past.<br />
The Irish can teach them something about honouring their own<br />
history and their traditions. But nor am I much impressed<br />
with the new tack of those conservatives, those conservative<br />
Australians, the idea that if we are not tugging the<br />
forelock to Britain, we must be tugging it to Asia. It is<br />
possible, you know, not to tug the forelock to anyone.<br />
Padric, we have got to be in this country like the Irish<br />
are, proud without being silly, parochial without being<br />
unworldly, culturally secure without being culturally<br />
arrogant. This is the great Irish legacy to Australia and<br />
we thank your country for it.<br />
Thank you.<br />
