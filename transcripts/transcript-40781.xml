    <content><![CDATA[<p>We are delighted to announce that Sydney will be the host city for the upcoming ASEAN-Australia Special Summit.</p>
<p>The event, expected to be held in March 2018, will mark the first time Australia has hosted a summit with ASEAN.</p>
<p>The summit is an historic and unprecedented opportunity to strengthen Australia’s strategic partnership with ASEAN and deliver tangible economic and security benefits to Australia.</p>
<p>As a group, ASEAN is Australia’s third largest trading partner. This summit provides an important forum to discuss how we can continue to make our region safer and more prosperous.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit will be the Leaders’ Summit and Retreat. There will also be two major side-events: A Business Summit which will bring together leaders of industry and Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to unlock new opportunities for job-creation, investment and enterprise; and a Counter-Terrorism Conference that will underscore our global leadership and collective regional action to combat terrorism.</p>
<p>The ASEAN-Australia Special Summit will create an enormous economic opportunity for Sydney, increasing visitor numbers to the city for the critical global forum. </p>
