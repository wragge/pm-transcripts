, AUSTR ALl A~ n-<br />
PRIMS MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 22 June 1984<br />
Before my return to Australia from the 15th South Pacific<br />
Forum in Tuvalu I plan to visit Fiji on 29 and 30 August.<br />
Australia and Fiji enjoy a close and constructive relationship<br />
with shared interests not only in the activities of the South<br />
Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission but also in<br />
wider international bodies such as the Commonwealth and the<br />
United Nations.<br />
Mrs Hawke and I had the pleasure of meeting Fiji's Prime<br />
Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and Adi Lady Mara among<br />
other guests at the South Pacific Forum Meeting in Canberra<br />
last August, which I hosted.<br />
Regional issues such as the future of New Caledonia and the<br />
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone proposal are expected to be<br />
discussed extensively at the Forum by the Heads of Government<br />
of the region.<br />
My visit to Fiji will allow Ratu Mara and myself to focus on<br />
matters affecting the bilateral relationship and on<br />
international issues of mutual concern.<br />
The South Pacific Forum will meet on Monday 27 and Tuesday<br />
28 August at Funafuti, Tuvalu.<br />
An informal meeting of Heads of Government will be held on<br />
Sunday 26 August at Amatuku.<br />
The itinerary is: Saturday 25 August Depart Australia<br />
Sunday 26 August Arrive Tuvalu<br />
Wednesday 29 August Depart Tuvalu<br />
Arrive Fiji<br />
Thursday 30 August Depart Fiji<br />
Arrive Canberra </p>
