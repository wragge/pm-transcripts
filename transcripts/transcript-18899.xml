On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I offer warm congratulations to President Barack Obama on his re-election and wish him every success for his second term in office.</p>
<p>Australia has worked closely with President Obama and his Administration over the past four years. I look forward to continuing this friendship. </p>
<p>Australia and the United States are unique partners, linked through culture, values, shared sacrifice and a commitment to international peace and security.</p>
<p>Our Governments and countries share a similar outlook on the world and similar hopes and aspirations for our peoples.</p>
<p>Australia's ANZUS Alliance with the United States has endured for 60 years and continues to make a contribution to the stability and security of our region. </p>
<p>Our economic ties are deep and broad, benefiting both countries.</p>
<p>The United States is one of our top trading partners and our largest investment partner, including in the Australian resources which are helping fuel Asia's economic growth. </p>
<p>We are fellow members of the G20, APEC and the East Asia Summit and will work together on the UN Security Council in 2013-14 during Australia's term as a non-permanent member.</p>
<p>US leadership remains vital to meeting global challenges; international financial stability and global economic growth, peace and security, and the impacts of our changing climate. </p>
<p>Australia has a long history of working with the United States to make a difference on these global challenges.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing to do so with President Obama on behalf of the people we serve.</p>
