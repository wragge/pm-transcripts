PRESS STATEMENT NO. 172<br />
18 January 1974..<br />
VISIT OVERSEAS BY ELIZABETH REID<br />
Elizabeth Reid, Adviser to the Prime rMinistdr,<br />
left today for a study tour that will take her to ten major<br />
European and North American cities. While away she will<br />
also represent Australia at a United Nations forum on the<br />
Role of Women in Population and Development.<br />
The purpose of her visit will be to establish<br />
contact with women and groups in other countries who are<br />
working in the same field and to inform I'erself of developments<br />
elsewhere relating to the status of women. Areas she will be<br />
studying include future patterns of employment for women,<br />
parliamentary and government organisations responsible for<br />
matters relating to women and the evolution of government<br />
policy to cope with the effects of changes in society on<br />
women in employment and in the home.<br />
These problems are at present being discussed<br />
in northern America and within the European Economic Community<br />
where extensive research is being undertaken. Miss Reid's<br />
tour will include visits to the O. E. C. D. in Paris, the I. L. O.<br />
headquarters in Geneva and the E. E. C. headquarters in Brussels.<br />
She will also meet women's groups and trade union and government<br />
representatives. The Australian Government is in a good position<br />
to learn from the experiences of other countries in their<br />
efforts to formulate policies and initiate changes to improve<br />
the status of women.<br />
