SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER. OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TOWN HALL, LIMA PERU 25 APRIL 1975<br />
Thank you Mr Mayor, for the honour you have<br />
done me and all Australians in this ceremony today.<br />
It is surely one of the curiosities of history that<br />
while an Australian Prime Minister was born in South<br />
America, this is the first time an Australian Prime<br />
Minister has paid a visit to the continent. Those<br />
events are separated by 108 years. For the benefit of<br />
Austr Alians who may have forgotten their history, I<br />
remind them that John Watson, the youngest Prime<br />
Minister to take office in Australia, and the first<br />
Labor Prime Minister, was born in Valparaiso. So<br />
I'm delighted that this is the first visit by an<br />
Australian Head of Government to South America.<br />
I'm delighted that my visit should begin in your<br />
historic and beautiful city a city roughly the size<br />
of Sydney, from which I departed three days ago. It is<br />
fitting that these two cities, Sydney and Lima, and our<br />
two countries countries with similar populations and<br />
with many similar hopes and aspirations should be<br />
participants in the first attempt by an Australian<br />
Head of Government to establish direct and personal<br />
links between continents and peoples on opposite shores<br />
of the Pacific ocean.<br />
This morning I laid a wreath at your<br />
national shrine. Some of you may know that today is<br />
also the anniversary of a battle with historic, indeed<br />
sacred, significance in the minds of the Australian<br />
people. Of course our military annals have little in<br />
common, but I was reminded by this concurrence of<br />
events of just how closely the histories of our two<br />
countries are linked with Europe. Australia and Peru<br />
were colonized by great European powers. Both retain,<br />
in their languages, their customs, their histories,<br />
the marks of their former but still continuing links<br />
with European civilization. At the same time both are<br />
the homes of much older indigenous cultures. During<br />
my visit to your city, in particular, to your<br />
archaeological museum and its magnificent collection,<br />
I have seen evidence of the remarkable ancient<br />
civilizations which flourished on the Peruvian coast.<br />
In no city, in no region of the world, is there a<br />
richer and more diverse conjunction of Christian<br />
European and Pre-Christian cultures.-It has been<br />
an unforgettable experience to see the architecture,<br />
and many of the artifacts, of cultures as varied as<br />
the Moche and the Mazca, the Paracas and the Inca<br />
the Brillians and the splendour of whose works have been<br />
rarely surpassed. / 2 </p>

Like Sydney, Lima is a great Pacific port,<br />
and yesterday, as we flew over the ocean that both joins<br />
and divides us, I was reminded of the important part<br />
the Pacific has played in our histories. It was from<br />
this coast from here, from Callao, and a little<br />
later from further. north, from Acapulco that man<br />
first set out on his conquest of the Pacific. From<br />
here the search for the great southern continent,<br />
Australia Del Espiritu Santo, began nearly 400 years<br />
ago. The Spanish mariners, of course, despite their<br />
courageous voyages, were not the ones to find<br />
Australia, but they went remarkably close. Torres<br />
passed the northern tip of the continent in 1606 and<br />
sailed through the strait which now bears his name.<br />
Forty years earlier, Mendana embarked on a course which<br />
would almost certainly have brought him to the east<br />
coast of Australia in -the vicinity of Rockhampton.<br />
He changed course, however, on the advice of his pilot<br />
Gallego a decision which eventually led him to the<br />
Solomon Islands and deprived him of the opportunity<br />
of anticipating by some 200 years, Captain Cook's<br />
discovery of Australia.<br />
We might well speculate as indeed, many<br />
have done on what would have happened if the Spanish<br />
explorers from Peru had found Australia first. As<br />
things turned out, our histories and development have<br />
proceeded in almost total isolation from each other<br />
during the intervening centuries. I believe the time<br />
has come, the occasion has arrived, to explore once<br />
again the opportu~ nities which lie across the Pacific,<br />
on both sides of the Pacific. It is that belief, that<br />
confidence, which has brought me to your city. Lima<br />
for centuries the capital of most of South America,<br />
is now the capital-of a nation with an important<br />
contemporary role, not only in Latin America but in<br />
world affairs. The second general conference of the<br />
United Nations Industrial Development Organisation<br />
was held in Lima this year. I congratulate your<br />
Government on the success of that conference and the<br />
significant contribution made by. Peru. It is<br />
appropriate that the outcome of the conference the<br />
declaration and plan of action on industrial<br />
development and coooperation the Lima Declaration<br />
bears the name of this city.<br />
For two nations so long aind so far apart,<br />
it is remarkable how many attitudes we share and how<br />
closely we have worked together. Peru is a member<br />
of the organisation of American states and the<br />
Andean group, to both of which Australia has<br />
observer status. We share an active concern for the<br />
Third World and in particular the non-aligned<br />
movement. We are both rich in natural resources and<br />
our economies depend greatly on the development and<br />
sale of those resources. / 3 </p>
<p>We were founding members of APEF, The organisation of<br />
iron ore exporters. Australia has observer status at<br />
CIPEF, the group of copper producing states a. nd<br />
there is a prospect of further cooperation in silver.<br />
Australia and Peru have almost identical views, as<br />
coastal states, on the law of the sea. We were members<br />
together of the Security Council in 1973 and 1974.<br />
We are both signdtories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation<br />
Treaty. Having flown to your city across the South<br />
Pacific and experienced once again the serene beauty of<br />
that vast ocean, I recall with pride the efforts of<br />
Australia and other Pacific border states to resist the<br />
poisoning of our seas and skies by nuclear tests.<br />
Some twenty years ago, Mr Mayor, an<br />
important street in Sydney was named General San Martin'<br />
Drive to commemorate one of the heroes of your<br />
independence struggle. Your country asserted her<br />
political independence one and a half centuries ago.<br />
In the past decade, and in the same sturdy spirit, she<br />
has asserted her economic independence as well.<br />
Australia's political independence was achieved more<br />
recently and certainly more peacefully, but our quest<br />
for economic independence, for the ownership and control<br />
of our basic industries and resources, is still going<br />
forward. Much has been achieved by Peru in working<br />
towards this goal. Widely separated as we are from each<br />
other and from many of the scenes of world conflict<br />
and tension Australia and Peru can profit from each<br />
other's example. As medium powers it is very much in<br />
our interests to associate more often and more closely<br />
to help shape a world whose future belongs to us as much<br />
as it does to the mightiest of nations. That is the<br />
true significance of our meeting the conviction<br />
that smaller states, by winning new friends, by<br />
developing new ideas and challenging old<br />
assumptions, by promoting new alliances and new<br />
perspectives in foreign relations, can be a force for<br />
hope and progress in these dangerous and uncertain times.<br />
I am deeply grateful for the hospitality<br />
and warmth shown to me in your country and particularly<br />
in Lima. In sealing, by this ceremony, the friendship<br />
of the peoples of Peru and Australia, I believe we have<br />
laid the basis for a productive and enduring association<br />
between our countries, one that will lead to many<br />
opportunities for useful cooperation and better<br />
understanding in the promotion of a just and peaceful<br />
world. </p>
