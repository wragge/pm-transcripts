PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 460<br />
March 1975<br />
PASSPORTS<br />
Administration of the Passports Act is to become the<br />
responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This<br />
follows a decision in October 1974 that the issue of<br />
travel documents to Australian citizens was appropriately a function<br />
of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who exercises<br />
responsibility for Consular matters relating to Australian<br />
citizens overseas. The reorganisation follows from a<br />
continuing review of the functions of the former<br />
Department of Immigration.<br />
Staff previously engaged in issuing passports in the<br />
Department of Labor and Immigration will be transferred<br />
to the Department of Foreign Affairs.<br />
As from 6 March applications for Australian passports<br />
should be made to the office of the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs in the State in which the applicant lives. For<br />
the convenience of the public, the Department of Labor<br />
and Immigration offices in Darwin, Townsville# Newcastle<br />
and Wollongong will continue to issue passports to local<br />
applicants.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
