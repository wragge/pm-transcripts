    <content><![CDATA[<p>This Easter, Orthodox Christians around the world will gather to remember the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and to celebrate the joy and grace at the centre of their faith.</p>
<p>Australia’s Orthodox communities are part of this vibrant global culture, enriching our nation’s heritage of belief with traditions firmly rooted in the earliest centuries of Christianity.</p>
<p>At this sacred time, all Australians acknowledge the virtues, the wisdom, and the extraordinary acts of love and compassion that have been faith’s best gift to the world.</p>
<p>To respect and forgive each other, to bear with one another and bind ourselves together in common life – these are ideals of meaning and significance not only to those of faith, but to all who value our diverse and harmonious society.</p>
<p>Our democracy rests on an understanding that every individual counts, and our social solidarity rests on the understanding that we should treat others as we would have them treat us. That golden rule resonates today as it did 2000 years ago.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in mind, I pay tribute to our Orthodox communities, and hope Easter brings you peace and time for reflection and contemplation.</p>
