CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIA-KOREA FORUM<br />
CANBERRA 20 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
When President Roh and I discussed, twelve months ago,<br />
the establishment of an Australia-Korea Forum, we hardly<br />
dared hope that this inaugural meeting would take place<br />
in such positive and favourable circumstances.<br />
But globally, regionally and bilaterally, developments<br />
over the last year have served to demonstrate that a<br />
Forum of this nature is not only desirable in theory but<br />
very timely and, indeed, necessary in practice.<br />
Globally, the extraordinary developments in Eastern<br />
Europe, the implementation of reforms within the Soviet<br />
Union, and the continuing emergence of a relationship<br />
built on trust between the superpowers, all give grounds<br />
for hope that we are living within a more secure<br />
international framework.<br />
Regionally, the successful conclusion of the first Asia<br />
Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, held here in<br />
Canberra two weeks ago, revealed a new determination on<br />
the part of regional economies to work together to<br />
achieve our shared goal of prosperity.<br />
And bilaterally, Australia and Korea have continued to<br />
build a very valuable trading relationship, within the<br />
context of increasingly close ties both at the Government<br />
level and at the level of individual contact by tourists,<br />
students and business leaders.<br />
All these developments make even more valid the reasoning<br />
behind this meeting there is a need for a Forum in<br />
which Australians and Koreans can frankly and<br />
constructively exchange views about our rapidly changing<br />
global and regional environment and identify new areas of<br />
cooperation between us.<br />
President Roh and I discussed the establishment of this<br />
Forum both on his very welcome visit to Australia in<br />
November last year and in my visit to Seoul last January.<br />
We are both agreed on the need to encourage creative<br />
thinking and informed debate about our bilateral </p>
<p>relationship, as part of a genuine broadening of that<br />
relationship. It is your task today and tomorrow to undertake that<br />
process S And I am pleased to see your agenda covers such<br />
vital and diverse topics as education and training,<br />
the environment, and cultural links.<br />
I am confident that your diverse areas of expertise, and<br />
the leadership provided by your joint Chairpersons Dr<br />
Brian Scott and Dr Park Pil-soo, will lead to a fruitful<br />
outcome to these discussions.<br />
I want today to make a few introductory comments about<br />
the Australia-Korea relationship to set the scene for<br />
your meeting.<br />
At the outset I want to put on record my personal sense<br />
of gratitude to and respect for the constructive role the<br />
Government of the Republic of Korea, and not least,<br />
President Roh himself, have played both in the<br />
establishment of this Forum and in the APEC meeting<br />
earlier this month.<br />
As you know, the APEC meeting emerged from a proposal I<br />
made in January, while visiting Seoul, for regional<br />
economies to consider again the benefits to be gained<br />
from close economic cooperation.<br />
I launched that proposal publicly the day after I had<br />
discussed it privately with President Roh and the<br />
strong support I received from the President strengthened<br />
my conviction that the time for closer regional<br />
cooperation had indeed come.<br />
Subsequently, in the consultations leading up to the<br />
ministerial meeting, and at the meeting itself here on 6<br />
and 7 November, Korean representatives made important<br />
contributions to the success of the venture.<br />
I am particularly grateful for Korea's invitation to host<br />
the third APEC meeting.<br />
What our cooperation on the establishment of APEC<br />
indicates, of course, is the strong common interests<br />
Australia and Korea share in boosting regional trade and<br />
investment within an open multilateral trading system<br />
and our capacity to work together to achieve those goals. </p>
<p>On all the areas on which APEC reached broad agreement<br />
regional economic analysis, trade liberalisation,<br />
technology transfer and human resources development, and<br />
sectoral cooperation Australia and Korea have much to<br />
contribute and much to gain. Your discussion at this<br />
Forum could usefully consider the complementarity of our<br />
interests in these developments and the processes by<br />
which they can be advanced.<br />
I was particularly pleased that APEC took a united and<br />
clear stand on the need for a liberalisation of world<br />
trading rules.<br />
We must work to ensure a truly open and<br />
non-discriminatory trading and investment system a<br />
system which is free of disruptions to trade and market<br />
signals, and which does not impose unnecessary costs on<br />
consumers and efficient producers.<br />
Ministers at the first APEC Conference were unanimous in<br />
their commitment to achieving a free market system<br />
through the Uruguay Round of the GATT.<br />
I believe their determination combined with the recent<br />
and very welcome proposal by the United States makes it<br />
more likely that the Uruguay Round will reach a<br />
successful conclusion.<br />
We certainly must continue to work to see that it does.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Our two countries have traditionally enjoyed an excellent<br />
relationship but it was one that was narrowly based,<br />
founded on the shared experience of the Korean War and<br />
devoted initially to a relatively small trade, weighted<br />
in Australia's favour.<br />
More recently our common interests and concerns have<br />
become both more evident and more diverse.<br />
As I said a fortnight ago when opening the APEC<br />
Conference, the Australia-Korea trading relationship has<br />
grown spectacularly. The political framework for our<br />
relationship has been strengthened, and the exchange ofpeople<br />
and information has increased.<br />
In 1960-61 total trade was worth $ 3.5 million. In 1988-<br />
89 total trade was approximately $ 3.5 billion, a 1000<br />
fold increase or a 28 per cent compound annual growth<br />
rate. That growth shows no signs of slackening.<br />
In this respect, of course, our trading relationship is<br />
not qualitatively different from that of many in the<br />
region. The growth of intra-regional trade has been one<br />
of the reasons for the emerging sophistication and<br />
dynamism of the region as a whole. </p>
<p>It is a tribute to the determination and creativity of<br />
many individuals that our economic relationship is so<br />
strong. And much has been done by Government to deepen and<br />
broaden those links.<br />
Last September my Government released a Trade and<br />
Commercial Development Program for Korea. Last November<br />
we signed a memorandum of understanding on Science and<br />
Technology. In civil aviation, Qantas and KAL have now finalised<br />
their negotiations for an Air Services Agreement. After<br />
Government to Government negotiations, air services are<br />
expected to commence next year. A Protocol to the 1975<br />
Trade Agreement is at the early stages of development.<br />
Two-way investment of about $ 114 million at the end of<br />
the 1987-88 financial year is smaller than could be<br />
expected given the value of our trade. However, Korea is<br />
a priority country in the Australian Government's<br />
Investment Promotion Strategy and a Korean investment<br />
mission visited Australia in September.<br />
Significant opportunities exist for joint ventures both<br />
within our own or third countries for Korean and<br />
Australia business seeking to diversify their trading<br />
relationships. Of course the Australia-Korea relationship does not rely<br />
solely on mutual economic interests. The political,<br />
social and cultural dimensions of the relationship are<br />
becoming increasingly important.<br />
In addition to the establishment of this Forum, recent<br />
months have seen two missions on industrial relations; a<br />
visit to Australia by members of the Korean Presidential<br />
Commission for Economic Restructuring; and a meeting of<br />
the Joint Cultural Commission, seeking to promote better<br />
cultural ties and exchanges between our two countries.<br />
All of these are welcome and valuable initiatives and I<br />
do not wish, by singling out one, to derogate from any of<br />
the others.<br />
But I do want to make special mention of the industrial<br />
relations missions not only because they illustrate the<br />
diversity of ways in which we can cooperate but also<br />
because, from an Australian point of view, they<br />
demonstrate the dramatically changing regard with which<br />
we are held in the region.<br />
It is my proud claim that under this Government, and in<br />
particular due to our Accord with the trade union<br />
movement, the level of industrial disputation in this<br />
country has declined by nearly 60 per cent. </p>
<p>The Accord has provided a vehicle for improvements in<br />
Australia's international competitiveness and<br />
productivity as well as our domestic goals of increased<br />
prosperity and equity through massive Job growth and<br />
enlargements in the social wage.<br />
It was to preserve such a manifestly valuable system that<br />
the Government had to take such a strong stand against<br />
the Australian Federation of Air Pilots whose pursuit of<br />
narrow self-interests Jeopardised the entire framework of<br />
the Accord.<br />
The broad success of Australia's industrial relations<br />
system, and the immense contribution made to Australia's<br />
economic turnaround by the trade union movement, suggests<br />
our experience may be of interest to our regional<br />
neighbours. And indeed during my discussions with President Roh<br />
earlier this year, it was agreed that Australia would<br />
send to Korea a delegation of union, industry and<br />
Government representatives to explain the development of<br />
Australia's industrial relations strategy since 1983.<br />
The delegation visited Korea in May, held lengthy<br />
discussions with the Korean Minister for Labour and<br />
representatives of Korean trade unions and management,<br />
and also met with President Roh.<br />
President Roh has since written to me commending the<br />
Australian delegation for its professionalism and for the<br />
timely assistance it has rendered to the Government,<br />
employers and trade unions in Korea.<br />
So useful was this initial interchange, that a return<br />
delegation recently visited Australia. I understand that<br />
the visit was again very constructive and successful,<br />
providing the delegation with a more detailed insight in<br />
the workings of the Australian industrial relations<br />
system. So we have a very useful and positive example of the<br />
diversity of ways in which Australia and Korea can learn<br />
from and help each other.<br />
Of course, people-to-people links underpin all these<br />
aspects of our relationship.<br />
In 1988, the year of the Seoul Olympics and the<br />
Australian Bicentenary, nearly 7,500 Australians visited<br />
Korea. More than 9,000 Koreans visited Australia.<br />
The Korean community in Australia number some 12,000<br />
people and there are currently more than 2,200 Korean<br />
students studying in Australia. </p>
<p>I take this opportunity to repeat that these Korean<br />
people, whether in Australia for tourism, study, business<br />
or as migrants making a permanent home in this country,<br />
are very welcome among us.<br />
I can state with absolute certainty that Australians are<br />
coming to a better understanding of the importance to us<br />
of Korea and its economically dynamic neighbours in<br />
Northeast Asia. On Wednesday I will be launching a<br />
report, that I commissioned from Professor Ross Garnaut,<br />
that is both a demonstration of this closer understanding<br />
and a very significant spur to it.<br />
Without discussing it in close detail now, I can say that<br />
the report makes very clear the benefits to Australia of<br />
enmieshment with Northeast Asia.<br />
Recent decisions by this Goverment have begun the process<br />
of policy adjustment to maximise the benefits from that<br />
enmeshment. The impact of the report reaches into virtually every<br />
aspect of Australian life and it will be compulsory<br />
reading for a Forum such as this.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The relationship between our two countries is in very<br />
good shape.<br />
And we are well placed to develop the as-yet unfulfilled<br />
potential for further growth and cooperation between us.<br />
My Government is committed to doing all it can to develop<br />
further the strong links between our countries, and I<br />
look forward to hearing the results of this<br />
Australia-Korea Forum.<br />
In opening this Conference I extend to our Korean guests<br />
a warm welcome to Australia and to our national capital<br />
Canberra, and I wish you all well in your discussions at<br />
this important Forum. </p>
