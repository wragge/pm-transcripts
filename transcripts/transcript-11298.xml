    <content><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I wrote to the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,</p>
<p> Slobodan Milosevic, seeking the immediate release of the two detained</p>
<p> CARE Australia workers, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace.</p>
<p>The Australian government remains deeply concerned at the continued</p>
<p> detention of these two men who at all times have been humanitarian</p>
<p> aid workers solely committed to the relief of human suffering.</p>
<p>The Chairman of CARE Australia, the Rt Hon Malcolm Fraser, is returning</p>
<p> to Yugoslavia today. In my letter, I asked President Milosevic if</p>
<p> he would personally receive Mr Fraser, who is the government's</p>
<p> special envoy in relation to seeking the release of Steve Pratt and</p>
<p> Peter Wallace, in connection with the government's desire to</p>
<p> free the two CARE workers.</p>
