TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP AND<br />
THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND TRANSPORT THE<br />
HON LAURIE BRERETON MP, JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 8 DECEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: and compatibility of the operation of the airport for passengers and<br />
for residents. Now, you will be aware that this been a matter which<br />
has been around for at least 15 years, and the Government in 1989<br />
with the then encouragement and support, indeed pressure of the<br />
NSW Liberal Government decided that Sydney's expansion required<br />
a second parallel runway. That runway was built, built efficiently<br />
again, under time and under budget and it was opened about 4<br />
weeks or so ago. In the meantime we have had a substantial amount<br />
of disquiet about its opening and today the Minister has brought a very<br />
comprehensive package of measures, in addition to those already<br />
announced for noise abatement, to the Cabinet after having heard the<br />
concerns of the community and residents of the surrounding area of<br />
Sydney to the issues. Now, the runway, as you know, was opened<br />
about 4 weeks ago. Before that for most of the last 20-odd years<br />
since the north-south runway was opened into Botany Bay we have<br />
had a cross-intersection of traffic, and we have had the flight plan<br />
arrangements so arranged by air traffic controllers and the Civil<br />
Aviation Authority to accommodate that cross-traffic. It should come as<br />
no surprise to anybody that once that changed and the air traffic<br />
control system had to accommodate 2 parallel lines of traffic or<br />
landings and take-offs to the north and south there had to be a rearrangement<br />
of air traffic control, and a re-arrangement of flight paths<br />
in the area.<br />
You will also be aware that the new control tower and the new control<br />
equipment in the tower is not yet available, and it means that given the<br />
first few weeks of the opening of the airport, there has been a view on<br />
the part of air traffic control managers and operators of aircraft that </p>
<p>they wanted a broader spread for safety until* they became<br />
accommodated to the new environment. In other words, you can't<br />
change a traffic pattern around a major airport that existed for 15 or<br />
years overnight and find everybody back in line on the new runways in<br />
the new systems without a trial and error process a transitional<br />
process. And the transitional process is the one that has basically<br />
brought a lot of residents produced a lot of disquiet, indeed anger,<br />
amongst residents. And they are looking for solutions to ease the<br />
noise burden on them, and to be certain about where the future traffic<br />
movements will be, and how the airport will operate in terms of curfews<br />
etc. Laurie Brereton and I understand those concerns, and today we are<br />
here to do something about them additional to that which we have<br />
already done. Now, in the statement I think you have, you will find<br />
there are a number of key changes here. One is the establishment of<br />
designated flight paths before this we haven't had designated flight<br />
paths we have had a deviation of about 7.8 degrees from the centre<br />
line. But in the past in the last past month, that has been all over the<br />
place, and that has been part of the problem they have been<br />
traversing areas they have never traversed before. These paths will<br />
apply to all jet take-offs and landings there will be penalties for flight<br />
path violation. That is, the adherence to the new flight paths will be<br />
closely monitored and regulations introduced under the Air Navigation<br />
Act to provide a legislative basis for their effective policing, and for<br />
penalties for violation and heavy penalties.<br />
The third element is requirements. for jet aircraft to depart from the<br />
southern end of the main north-south runway, and obtain as much<br />
height as possible over residential areas. In other words, instead of<br />
taking off to the north when the prevailing winds are blowing instead<br />
of taking off to the north from halfway down the runway, they will need<br />
to go right out to the end of the seaward runway which is another<br />
couple of kilometres and take-off from there, and then gain as much<br />
height as possible, which is less fuel efficient for them and more costly<br />
to the airlines. So they have got more time in the taxiing, and costinefficiencies<br />
in the gaining of altitude, but we will be requiring them to<br />
do that. And we are going on then to reaffirm the Government's policy<br />
on operational noise controls, saying that unless otherwise required on<br />
safety or weather grounds, all take-offs must be to the south of the<br />
airport not to the north to the south over Botany Bay. And there will<br />
be no take-offs to the north from the new runway, and the east-west<br />
runway will remain available for use when weather conditions preclude<br />
take-offs on the other parallel runways.<br />
And there are then further decisions about noise treatment measures.<br />
What the Government has decided to do to is to accelerate the<br />
program we have already announced, but instead of it being completed<br />
over 10 years, having it completed over 3 years at a cost of around </p>
<p>million each year. The levy will still stay on the airline industry,<br />
but we the Commonwealth will carry the upfront costs and collect the<br />
levy later. And the insulation programs will commence immediately for<br />
schools and colleges, and we will expect that the school and college<br />
insulation program will be completed by the end of the first term of the<br />
new school year. We are particularly concerned that schools and<br />
colleges and children who have, of course, experienced this noise in<br />
the past, but may now experience it more frequently will find<br />
themselves much more relieved of it, and we will be having the<br />
Department of Administrative Services assisting in the early<br />
commencement of that program.<br />
We go on to talk about Badgerys Creek, saying that we have already<br />
spent $ 150 million acquiring the airport, committing a further $ 120<br />
million to a 2,900 metre runway, commence the EIS and the operations<br />
for a national highway out to there, and also a study to secure a rail<br />
corridor and on how the airport might be developed in the future.<br />
Lastly and importantly, there will be a stringent enforcement of the<br />
curfew arrangements. The curfew regulations under the Air Navigation<br />
Act will be amended to provide for financial penalties for unauthorised<br />
operations under the curfew because we have seen, on occasions,<br />
some substantial incursions into those arrangements. Now, we have<br />
got some maps on the wall behind me I'll point out some points to<br />
these in a minute and then I will invite Laurie Brereton to add to my<br />
remarks, and perhaps deal with some of the points that I haven't. But I<br />
would just like to make these points to you this decision was always<br />
taken by the Government in terms of getting the balance between<br />
social and economic imperatives right. The airport was going to be<br />
built at some time better for the residents to have it built more on their<br />
terms than less on their terms. There were 180,000 people affected by<br />
Mascot airport noise that is now reduced to 90,000. So that has been<br />
cut in half. Now the aim of the game is to reduce the burden of the<br />
change on that 90,000. And the other point I would like to make is that<br />
in the month that the airport has been opened, we have had most<br />
unseasonal summer winds persistent northerly winds which are<br />
unseasonal for this time of year. And once the northerly winds go over<br />
knots, for safety reasons the aircraft are required to take off to the<br />
north. This is unusual so we have got an unusual concurrence of<br />
events. Firstly, the change pattern of air traffic movements which is a<br />
great change from the past and spreads which have come from that<br />
which in any other operational circumstances would be unlikely,<br />
prevailing northerly winds which are way, way different than the<br />
year average with many people in the industry remarking about the<br />
unseasonality of the persistent northerly winds and the take-offs to the<br />
north and also the silly season of a state election campaign, which is<br />
bringing out the worst absolutely the worst in all the political players,<br />
and most particularly of course John Fahey and his ministers. And as </p>
<p>a consequence we have had a very large public debate and a few<br />
public meetings.<br />
Now, before I invite Laurie Brereton to make some points, I will make a<br />
couple of points off the charts and then I will leave the discussion over<br />
to him. But let me repeat the points these are major changes, and<br />
they make a major difference to a lot of people living in the vicinity of<br />
the airport, or certainly under the flight paths.<br />
( discussion of maps)<br />
LB: If I can supplement those remarks, and say the key in terms of the<br />
restriction of the flight path, is that by the time planes arrive on takeoff,<br />
at the Parramatta River, the spread of planes will be restricted to .8<br />
of 1 nautical mile, and that is about a third of the spread that was<br />
allowed under the old arrangements that is the 7.8 degree deviation on<br />
either side. So you can see, at that point, where as the Prime Minister<br />
has said, planes fully laden jumbo's and 747' s will be at about 14 or<br />
1500 feet, it will be flying in a much tighter configuration than has<br />
previously been the case. And of course, that is, that, for the first time,<br />
will be a configuration enforceable at law, in that a corporation that<br />
flies outside of those guidelines will be liable, for prosecution with a<br />
maximum penalty of up to $ 25,000, and this is a significant measure<br />
introduced to make sure that we not only have tight patterns, but that<br />
we have adequate policing of them as well. I might say something<br />
about the curfew as well, because, the Prime Minister has indicated<br />
that Cabinet agreed today to a much tougher approach in respect of<br />
the curfew at Mascot Airport. The curfew at the moment of course<br />
applied between the hours of 11 at night and 6 in the morning, subject<br />
to certain classes of planes being able to fly during the night, and<br />
subject in addition to that, to some exemptions between 11 and 12 at<br />
night and 5 and 6 in the morning, and only to a total of 14 per week.<br />
We found that the exemptions have been taken up as part of the norm,<br />
in the last 12 months there were 257 dispensations granted for flights<br />
in the curfew hours and we intend to take a much tougher approach to<br />
the whole question of the curfew and it will also, for the first time, be<br />
enforceable with penalties of up to $ 25,000. All told today we -have got<br />
a package agreed to by Cabinet of great significance. The bringing<br />
forward of the funding amount to $ 180 million being spent over three<br />
years not ten, paid for off the budget, recouped over the ten years by<br />
the tax on the airlines. The new tight flying paths will restrict greatly<br />
the number of people affected, and indeed, the new arrangements for<br />
maximum climb in commencing take-off from the southern most end of<br />
the runway will also greatly alleviate the noise nuisance that people<br />
are experiencing at the moment. So we think that these measures<br />
combined as they are in this package will tackle the difficulties being<br />
faced by people in Sydney quite comprehensively. It is a fact that the<br />
overwhelming majority are better off at the moment, but that does not </p>
<p>for a moment lift the burden on those who are suffering increase noise<br />
nuisance as a result of these arrangements. But just let me say<br />
something finally about the question of safety, it needs to be<br />
remembered that one of the key benefits of this new parallel runway<br />
configuration is not just a question of extra capacity, lifting it up to<br />
approximately 85 take-offs and landings per hour, but they're take-offs<br />
and landings that are operating on the one axis, without intersecting<br />
flight patterns, and the sort of incident that we saw only in the last<br />
couple of years, we have seen a couple of them, but there was one in<br />
particular with a Thai Airlines DCI 10, a Qantas 747 and an Ansett A320<br />
which could easily have ended in a very considerable disaster, will be<br />
avoided as a result of these arrangements, because simultaneous<br />
take-offs and landings, which is a less safe mode of operation will be<br />
eliminated, so that's a plus for safety. This package is a plus for the<br />
residents affected by noise nuisance in Sydney and if I can just add<br />
one final thing, and that is, I was told this morning that the operators at<br />
the airport had the airport now operating at very close to the capacity<br />
that existed prior to the new arrangements coming into place. In fact, if<br />
you take out the second two weeks of the operation of the new<br />
arrangements, we recorded this year 52 take-offs and landings per<br />
hour, that compares with the same two weeks of last year at 54 per<br />
hour, there has been a further improvement over the last two weeks<br />
and we are very confident that the airport will be operating without any<br />
reduction in its capacity and operating more safely for Christmas. So<br />
are there any questions.<br />
J: Mr Brereton you don't appear to have sped up the building of<br />
Badgery's Creek any faster than what was announced in Working<br />
Nation?<br />
LB: Well I think there has been a great deal of work done, on the contrary,<br />
in respect of Badgery's Creek since the Working Nation Statement<br />
advanced the timetable for Badgery's Creek construction by some<br />
years. The commitment in Working Nation of $ 120 million to build a<br />
full operational strip, that is a 2900 metre strip of sufficient pavement<br />
thickness to accommodate any class of jet up to a 747, was a very big<br />
dollar commitment, and it is one that has been reinforced with our<br />
subsequent commitment of some $ 200 million in road works linking<br />
Badgerys Creek with the national highway system and in turn with the<br />
so that there will be a link between the two airports Kingsford<br />
Smith on the one hand and Badgerys Creek on the other end as is of<br />
course, the study that is already under way with the NSW Government<br />
on reserving a rail corridor so that we can have a public transport link.<br />
So that you genuinely in the future can have these two airports<br />
hubbing back to back. But having said that, we only got that go-ahead<br />
in May of this year and it is a great planning job to be done to make<br />
sure that Badgerys Creek is properly planned and is sequentially<br />
planned so that it can open at the earliest possible date and can be<br />
added to to meet demand over time. Now we have a task force </p>
<p>working at this very moment on that and it is pulling together all of the<br />
disciplines necessary to guarantee that that master planning is done<br />
and done perfectly and that we don't have a half-baked airport out<br />
there, that we have a properly designed and built airport that can meet<br />
the future airport needs of Sydney and take some of this load off<br />
Kingsford Smith, because as the Prime Minister has said, we have had<br />
an expansion in demand between February and November of this year<br />
of 50% on the peak hours of the peak days, and with that demand<br />
coming through from the airlines, it will only be a matter of months<br />
before all of the capacity of Kingsford Smith is used up again, even<br />
with the new ground radar, even with the 85 take-offs and landings per<br />
hour. So, that makes it all the more important to get the planning right,<br />
to build the road, to get the rail link reserved, to build that runway, and<br />
we're committed to doing that and then to get on and open Badgerys<br />
Creek as soon as possible.<br />
J: The spending in the Forward Estimates set aside for Badgerys Creek<br />
into this year's budget<br />
LB: Well the job this year of course is to spend a lot of money on planning,<br />
because it is fair to say that there has not been anywhere enough<br />
planning done on Badgerys Creek to date. I mean, up until April of this<br />
year, no-one had so much as thought of putting a line on a map to<br />
reserve a road corridor to link the two airports. The NSW Government<br />
had simply not accounted for an airport link, road or rail, in its planning<br />
arrangements. Now that's the sort-of fundamental planning I want to<br />
make sure we get right. That's what the master planning must<br />
encompass. That and every other element of development. We don't<br />
want to have an airport that is other than the absolute optimum design<br />
and that Taskforce is working to deliver that result for us now.<br />
J: Does this plan turn the Liberal voters of the North Shore into victims of<br />
winner take all politics as Mr Howard alleges?<br />
PM: Well, there is only one way you can take-off from the north/ south<br />
runway, which has been built for twenty years and that's north over Mr<br />
Howard's electorate, and knowing that, Mr Howard said, when asked<br />
" do you think the Government will go for a third runway?" -this is in<br />
March ' 89 " I think it will, I hope they do, they should have gone for it 6<br />
1/ 2 years ago. There's an overwhelming case for building it", he said,<br />
and, you know, " if they don't build it, they will have totally betrayed<br />
Sydney's interest in the interest of the tourist industry". So that's the<br />
members own views.<br />
.:... i. tn naowrr osow th at it's more concentrated<br />
LB: Can I say something on this score of Mr Howard's comments today.<br />
Mr Howard's electorate is more than 6 nautical miles from the airport.<br />
To get to it you have got to travel over three Labor electorates. The </p>
<p>seats of Grayndler, Sydney and Lowe, and as the Prime Minister has<br />
said, by the time they get to Mr Howard's electorate, under this<br />
arrangement, a Boeing 747 will be travelling at approximately 2250<br />
feet as opposed to the current practice of 1400 or 1500 feet. And if<br />
any, either Mr Howard or his constituents are troubled by that, and I<br />
know that many will be, they should come down to Sydenham and<br />
Tempe and see what real noise nuisance is all about. This is not a<br />
case of doing anything other than getting the optimum efficiency, the<br />
optimum safety and minimising the noise impact, and it will be Labor<br />
electorates that bear the burden now as they always have, and will<br />
continue in the future. And breastbeating from John Howard is really<br />
the last thing that we need now.<br />
PM: hypocritical breastbeating. Can I just say, before I do just make this<br />
point though, John Howard's as are other constituents will benefit from<br />
this because the aircraft will be higher the track that they have had<br />
over their electorates for twenty odd years. So, they will be higher and<br />
therefore the noise profile will be better.<br />
LB: Could I just, I know that John Howard aspires to be Leader of the<br />
Opposition once again, but it is worth recalling what he published last<br />
time he was Leader of the Opposition on his ' Leader of the Opposition'<br />
letterhead in 1989 when he said this in the interests of safety,<br />
airport facilities should be upgraded immediately", including he said<br />
" the construction of the third runway, a decision is needed and the<br />
Government has to face up to its responsibilities". So, it is a bit late in<br />
the day for him to be putting on the performance that we have seen<br />
from him today.<br />
PM: The core point is that aircraft have always taken this track ever since<br />
the seaward runway was built, the original north-south runway. What<br />
we are doing today is making it better, for not only Mr Howard's<br />
constituents but others by getting more height, by making aircraft take<br />
off further back down the runway at the seaward end and obliging the<br />
airlines to spend more money on fuel by getting height and, of course,<br />
we are doing as few governments in the world are doing, none are<br />
doing in fact developing the most comprehensive noise abatement<br />
procedures out through those affected areas.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you think now that may be you made the wrong<br />
decision five years ago, instead of fast tracking Badgerys Creek,<br />
instead of building the third runway now. All the problems the Minister<br />
and yourself have outlined noise and traffic congestion. I mean you<br />
could get rid of that if you accept what the minister said five years ago<br />
when he didn't want the third runway built and you, chief amongst the<br />
lot of them, was hot and strong to build it.<br />
PM: The consensus was with the NSW government, Mr Greiner </p>
<p>J: ( inaudible) it was a Federal government decision.<br />
PM: No, just a second, it was a decision of the Federal Government at the<br />
urging of the NSW government that had to provide a lot of the<br />
surrounding infrastructure and who had no intention of doing anything<br />
for Badgerys Creek, as the Minister has already told you, they didn't<br />
even have the wit or the sense to at least plan a corridor for traffic out<br />
to it. Even at this point. So, let's go through the thing. ' NSW<br />
Government Swoops on the Runway'. Premier Nick Greiner said ' work<br />
on a third runway should start as soon as possible' 20 September<br />
1990. In 1989 the Premier, Mr Greiner urged the Federal<br />
government to cut the red tape and start preparing the runways EIS.<br />
Certainly the State will do all it can and will hasten the study', and he<br />
goes on in that vein. And, there are half a dozen press releases from<br />
him. Then we had John Fahey the current Premier on 18 January<br />
1993 saying about the curfew, that w e should reinvestigate the curfew.<br />
He said ' I think, we have got to remember that when the curfew was<br />
put on it was in relation to a certain decibel level of aeroplanes. That<br />
decibel level of aeroplanes has dropped significantly and it is time we<br />
had the debate.' Ti'me we had the debate about suspending the<br />
curfew.<br />
J: But Prime Minister, I'm not suggesting that you listened to Nick Greiner<br />
and not Laurie Brereton ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Just a second Alan ( Ramsey). I picked up all the nuances of your<br />
question, I don't need additional help, thanks very much. John Sharp<br />
who is the Opposition's spokesman said I have repeatedly called for<br />
the commencement of construction of a parallel north-south runway<br />
and a new international terminal. The quickest, easiest most cost<br />
effective solution to this problem is the construction of a third runway<br />
at Kingsford Smith, not at Badgerys Creek.' Mr Fischer, Leader of the<br />
National Party any further delay in deciding on a third runway at<br />
Mascot would mean loss of life as well as economic insanity'. Charles<br />
Blunt who was then spokesman for transport said he was joining a<br />
petition campaign to add to the mounting pressure on the Hawke<br />
government to build a third runway at Kingsford Smith.' And it goes on<br />
and on. Then, you have got Mr Jull who is the shadow spokesperson<br />
for tourism, aviation and sport the construction of a new third<br />
runway for Sydney should be commenced immediately', he said in July<br />
1989 and Mr Howard saying it should have been built six and a half<br />
years earlier'. I mean, that was the general consensus of the political<br />
parties about this.<br />
LB: Can I just add that it was also the consensus of all the assembled<br />
journalists at all those press conferences that I attended in the days<br />
that I was campaigning about Badgerys Creek. Because, press<br />
conference after press conference people said ' well, aren't you just </p>
<p>interested in local parochial issues, isn't this just a case of looking after<br />
your own backyard?'<br />
PM: We were being urged to introduce a major micro economic reform<br />
question by many of you in the room today.<br />
J: Do you still think<br />
PM: And, any questions from you Geoff ( Kitney) on the basis that some<br />
tricky little ploy about whether a decision is right or not is basically<br />
hypocritical. Of course it is. It needs to be rejected with the contempt<br />
it deserves.<br />
J: No. I still think it's the right decision. I'm asking if you still do.<br />
PM: Well, the airport has been built, it is an actuality.<br />
J: Exactly.<br />
PM: Exactly. Therefore, the decision of the Government, what we have to<br />
do is to make sure that the airport operates effectively, efficiently and<br />
with much more compatibility with residents' interests.<br />
J: What was the advice to you from the airline companies of the double<br />
effect of the designated flight paths and the take offs from the extreme<br />
southern end on their schedules?<br />
LB: It has been indicated to me by my officials that it is likely to lead to a<br />
very minor reduction in the optimum number of planes that they can<br />
squeeze in and out of Kingsford Smith. It will, at the margin, have<br />
some affect, because aeroplanes will have to cross the major northsouth<br />
runway to get onto the taxi way to proceed to the very southern<br />
most tip of runway 34L. That said, it will give us a much better<br />
environmental result and, I think, it is certainly worth the effort.<br />
J: So, the effect of this is that fewer flights will be able to come in and<br />
out?<br />
LB: But, I think you should see that against the backdrop of the tower<br />
coming on stream in February or March of next year and of the ground<br />
radar coming in later next year and the capacity of the airport being<br />
lifted from its present capacity of the high 50s up to 80 to 85 take-offs<br />
and landings per hour. So, this will give us safety and will give us a<br />
good environmental outcome and will not be a great burden for the<br />
airline industry to bear, especially with the very good efforts of the air<br />
traffic controllers that have already seen capacity recover to that which<br />
existed under the old simultaneous operations at the airport. </p>
<p>J: Was any consideration given to allowing take-offs to the north off the<br />
new runway in order to spread the burden of take-off noise?<br />
PM: A policy decision was made about that in 1989 at the time and that has<br />
never been altered.<br />
J: It was a political opposition rather than..<br />
J: There's a hotel in the way!<br />
PM: There is now a hotel in the way apparently, but there we are.<br />
J: Well, that's factually correct, but..<br />
PM: Well, it's there. I don't know whether you haven't seen it as you drove<br />
past.<br />
J: But, it doesn't prohibit take-offs.<br />
PM: Well, you can occupy the top floor.<br />
LB: I think the reality, you need to see this airport for what it is. It is a<br />
parallel runway airport now which will have a maximum capacity<br />
operating those parallels with take-offs to the south preferably, but to<br />
the north when necessary 85 take-offs and landings. But, when there<br />
are big cross winds, it will of necessity drop to about 40 because they<br />
can only use the east-west runway which will remain open. But, to<br />
suggest that we should add to the air port with take-offs to the north on<br />
the new parallel runway, to squeeze it from 85 up to 90, with all of the<br />
environmental consequences that would have for take-offs, twice as<br />
noisy as landings, to the north in a new area, I think, would be a very<br />
bad deal for Sydney. I would much prefer to get on with the<br />
development of Badgerys Creek and see it as the supplementary<br />
airport for Sydney.<br />
J: There is a suggestion it would spread the noise rather have it all<br />
running off the old north-south, having it run off both north-south..<br />
PM: Tom ( Burton) you have got a debate now about the additional noise<br />
affects of a parallel runway system, fair enough. Imagine the debate<br />
we would have had if the Thai's DC10 had collided with the A320<br />
Ansett plane. The vectored directions of their collision would have<br />
then picked up a 747 which Qantas had and the whole lot of them<br />
would have ended up in the overseas terminal. That's what we had on<br />
our hands here. And, as the demand for air traffic out of Sydney has<br />
risen along with all traffic movements of Australia, it was getting<br />
impossible to run that system. The whole system is based on the fact<br />
that only pilots familiar with the system and certificated for it can use it.<br />
So, an international pilot cannot use the cross runway unless that pilot </p>
<p>has flown in and out of Australia, been to the CMA and has a certificate<br />
about the use of the runway.<br />
Now, even with it, I mean, I just picked up a Sydney Morning Herald<br />
report of that incident and it said this, on the day 13 August 1991<br />
simultaneous landings are standard on the two main runways at<br />
Sydney airport. When two planes land at once with one stopping short<br />
of the intersection to allow the other plane to land safely'. So, in other<br />
words if the pilot overflies and then for either water, rain, breaking or<br />
anything, can't stop short of the intersection he collects the one on the<br />
other runway. I mean, that is the system we have had.<br />
J: But, it never happened.<br />
PM: It nearly happened. They were in the international journal Flight<br />
International, I mean Alan ( Ramsey), you would be wringing your<br />
hands, the rhetoric would be dripping out of your column, the papers<br />
would be soaked with the feigned indignation that that cynical remark<br />
you have just made subsumes. Now, the fact is..<br />
J: ( Ramsey) Prime Minister, I would argue you are making cynical<br />
political..<br />
PM: I'm not here to debate with you Alan. Flight International said this<br />
investigators believe that the A320 passed about 33 feet above the<br />
DCIO0'. Now, not long later my predecessor in a VIP aircraft also had a<br />
problem with aborting a flight on the cross wind runway. The fact is,<br />
you don't have to be an air traffic controller to know that a parallel<br />
system of flights in and out of Sydney is far safer than a set of cross<br />
runways and you can have this debate, but if we had a collision on the<br />
cross wind ' runway it would be the incumbent Minister for Transport<br />
right in the slot, we would have hand wringing on a scale that we have<br />
never seen before. So, the parallel system is the right system and the<br />
key is to get it into place and it is, I think, a great pity that John Fahey<br />
has shown no leadership in this, that he has run off hiding with a little<br />
bit of poor politics when in fact he knows the safety issues as well as<br />
Laurie Brereton and I know and he knows that his government<br />
supported it all the way through. I mean, there must be some public<br />
decisions in this country that deserve some integrity of treatment, even<br />
from people like John Fahey.<br />
We have got about three minutes and we have to go off. Question<br />
Time is at 3: 00pm. So, two more questions.<br />
J: What penalties apply to the airlines if they ignore the directive to takeoff<br />
from the southern most end. You say penalties will apply if they<br />
ignore the deviation from the main take-offs to the north. Will they<br />
apply if they.. </p>
<p>LB: They will be directed to the southern most point on that runway and<br />
they will have no option but to take-off from there. That will be the<br />
standard operational practice for where jets commence their take-offs<br />
at Mascot in future.<br />
J: How much will the extra fuel cost and do you think that will fit into<br />
higher ticket prices?<br />
LB: I was told it might cost $ 20 a flight to get these arrangements in place.<br />
PM: Not a ticket is it?<br />
LB: $ 20 a flight, not a ticket. That is $ 20 for the plane, so I suppose it will<br />
depend on the number of passengers, but I don't think it is anywhere<br />
near too great a price to bear for the sort of benefits that will flow from<br />
it.<br />
PM: We will leave it at that. Thanks very much for coming.<br />
