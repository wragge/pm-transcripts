FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 4 NOVEMBER 1981<br />
ADDRESS AT THE 8TH SESSION OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF<br />
THE INTERNATIONAL BAUXITE ASSOCIATION<br />
It gives me great pleasure to addxess you today on behalf of thet<br />
Government of Australia. I welcome you to Australia, and<br />
especially to our national capital, Canberra.<br />
Australia has been a member of the International Bauxite<br />
Association since it was formed in 1974. Our membership<br />
ref lectsZ the importance of bauxite and alumina to Australia:<br />
we are the world's largest producer, and third largest exporter<br />
of bauxite, we are both the largest producer and exporter of<br />
alumina, and we are expanding our production of aluminium.<br />
However, our membership also reflects our desire to assist<br />
developing countries to achieve fair and reasonable returns<br />
for their raw materials exports; and our desire to support<br />
international co-oper-ation on commodity trade matters. We<br />
also see the promotion of domestic processing of raw materials<br />
as a significant means of promoting economic development.<br />
As a significant producer and exporter of bauxite and alumina,<br />
Australia is conscious of the effects of the downturn in the<br />
y iorld aluminium market, and the consequent decline in demand<br />
for bauxite and alumina. The effects on producing nations are<br />
being reflected in significant cutbacks in production, and<br />
being accentuated by downward pressure on prices. No doubt,<br />
the state of the world market and of the world economy in<br />
general will be a principal subject of discussion for ministers<br />
at this Conference. Letme offer two observations relevant to<br />
that subject.<br />
First, as much as we may wish otherwise, the prospects for all<br />
of us are significantly affected by general world economic<br />
conditions. There are things countries can do on their<br />
own account to improve their position, but trade dependent<br />
countries are particularly affected by the economic circumstances<br />
and policies of the major industrialised countries, particularly<br />
dependent. on the industrialised countries cettinq their own<br />
policies right, getting their own economies right. The policies<br />
of the United States Government, for example, and the state of: the<br />
United States economy, are of central important to many parts of<br />
the trading world, not only because the United States is the largest<br />
importer of products that members of this association produce, but<br />
also because world economic conditions are greatly affected<br />
by domestic United States economic conditions. / 2 </p>
<p>AS DELIVERED -2-<br />
Second, and a source of rather more optimism, there are signs<br />
of an underlying strengthening of the demand for aluminium.<br />
It is becoming an increasingly important material in<br />
packaging, building and construction, electricity transmission.<br />
and especially transportation. That tend offers good prospect~ s<br />
for the future for all of us, but especially for those countries<br />
which take advantage of the higher returns available from their<br />
raw materials by encouraging greater domestic processing.<br />
The problems of depressed, and often volatile, world prices<br />
for resources and primary products, a lack of progress in<br />
reducing barriers to trade in commodities of particular concern<br />
to developing countries, and the general impact of the slow<br />
growth of world trade have also served to highlight the<br />
significance of what are often referred to as north-south<br />
issues, issues that primarily concern the obstacles to progress<br />
in the economic development of the poorer nations of the world~.<br />
? Australia has believed for some time that progress on north-south<br />
issues is important for the well-being of the whole world.<br />
There is-, of course, an overwhelming moral and humanitarian<br />
case for'assistance to those people who are living in<br />
unfulfilling conditions of poverty. But progress in promotinr<br />
the dialogue between the north and the south, and in integrati . ng<br />
the South into the world economy to a greater extent is at least<br />
as much a matter of enlightened self interest for the North.<br />
Without such progress, political and economic unrest may worsen,<br />
so heightening East-West security tensions and opportunities for<br />
expanded trade that are of mutual benefit to the North and the<br />
South will certainly be missed.<br />
The reciprocal nature of the benefits from expanded trade<br />
between developed and developing countries needs, I think, to be<br />
much more widely appreciated than it now is. Some 25% of the<br />
West's entire trade is with developing countries, and the proportion<br />
is even higher for the United States and for Japan<br />
so many millions of employment in the factories of Northern<br />
countries is dependent upon trade with Southern-countries. If that<br />
trade did not exist, the economic problems of North America and<br />
of Europe would be infinitely greater than they now are. Moreover,<br />
between 1973 and 1978 compared with an average annual growth in<br />
exports from developing to developed countries of around<br />
exports from developed to developing countries increased at an<br />
average annual rate of over 26%. Without growing markets in<br />
developing countries, employment prospects and prosperity in<br />
developed countries would be significantly lower today, but un~ less<br />
the developed countries are prepared to provide market access -to<br />
developing countries in return, they will cut off an important<br />
source of support for their growth products. All of this<br />
represents an argument from enlightened self interest from the<br />
countries of the North and I suspect that that is the kind of<br />
argument that is most likely to attract them. But it does not<br />
matter which argument attracts the countries of the North so long<br />
as in the coming months there is action on these fronts.<br />
Australia recently hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
Meeting ( C: HOGM) in Melbourne and that was attended by 42 Heads of<br />
Government or their alternates, representing a quarter of the world's<br />
population from both developed and developing countries. An<br />
important outcome of that meeting was the strong positive support<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>AS DELIVERED 3<br />
given to initiatives reflecting both the spirit and the<br />
substance of the North-South issues through the Melbourne<br />
Declaration and through the Communique. The Declaration<br />
signifies the strong commitment of the Commonwealth leaders<br />
to progress in North-South issues, while the Communique<br />
proposes practical action to overcome many problems in<br />
vital areas.<br />
Two weeks ago, 22 Heads of Government representing over<br />
two-thirds of the world's population met in Cancun, Mexico. The<br />
subject of their discussions was also the North-South issue.<br />
The Cancun discussions were conducted, as I am advised, in a<br />
constructive spirit and while the progress that is so essential<br />
has not yet been achieved, while the will to advance our<br />
objective needs to be further strengthened, a basis of understanding<br />
has, I believe, been established and the impetus for continuing<br />
discussions and negotiations which was also developed at the<br />
Ottawa summit and the Melbourne meeting, needs to be maintained.<br />
Australia will continue to emphasise through all channels open<br />
to it the vital importance of getting global negotiations moving.<br />
At the same time, however, we shall continue to promote a number<br />
of special initiatives that would in themselves lead to<br />
improvements in international well-being. Our Foreign Minister,<br />
Mr. Street, will shortly be visiting the United Nations so that<br />
he can advise the Government better on the ways and means in<br />
which Australia, through the agencies of the United Nations, can.<br />
help to promote those global negotiations in general terms and<br />
in the specifics to which we and many other countries are commit: ted.<br />
It is not going to be good . enough for countries to sit back and<br />
let others take the running. I think we all need to do what can<br />
be done in these particular areas.<br />
World food security is a basic and vital goal that is presently<br />
being discussed in many international forums a very important<br />
, part of the North-South dialogue. Australia supports and has<br />
contributed significantly to international efforts to improve<br />
food security. We believe this can be most rapidly achieved<br />
through measures which encourage increased food production,<br />
particularly through the use of appropriate price incentives.<br />
We have taken some initiatives of our own account to assist<br />
developing countries in their food production. We are, in a sense,<br />
throwing open access to the research establishment in Australia<br />
which is a large one Government funded and in universities and<br />
in State Departments to help solve some of the agricultural and<br />
pastoral problems that may be being experienced in developing<br />
countries. We are providing considerable funds for that purpose.<br />
We also consider that food security will be considerably enhanced<br />
by reducted protectionism in agricultural trade of particular<br />
importance to developing countries and by encouraging new donors<br />
to meet international food aid targets. There is, moreover, El<br />
need for guidelines designed to ensure the security of food supplies<br />
to developing countries in global crop shortfall situations.<br />
Official Development Assistance has an important rol-e to play in<br />
development, not only in food but in other areas of great importance<br />
to developing countries. Australia has recently increased its aid<br />
allocation by almost 20%. However, we recognise that official flows<br />
will remain inadequate probably for the task, and in this context,<br />
we believe that private enterprise and private investment have an<br />
important role to play. / 4 </p>
<p>* AS DELIVERED -4<br />
The tendency towards increasing protectionism poses a particular<br />
obstacle to world trade development. Protectionism in<br />
agricultural trade, again of particular importance to developing<br />
countries, and the use of non-tariff barriers to trade are<br />
particularly damaging.<br />
It is our view that reduced protectionism will encourage growth<br />
which will benefit countries of the North and' of the South..<br />
The potential gains from liberalisation of trade are especially<br />
significant for agricultural trade. Indeed, an UNCTAD study<br />
conducted in the 1970s estimated that removal of barriers to<br />
agricultural trade in goods relevant to developing countries<br />
would increase export earnings of developing countries by an<br />
amount equivalent to some $ 30 billion a year in 1980 values.<br />
That is a very significant and substantial amount, and quite<br />
obviously if financial flows were increased by that sum to a<br />
number of developing countries they would be able to do so much<br />
more on their own account.<br />
A strengthening of the GATT offers a potential source of<br />
progress in this context and Australia supports strongly the GATT<br />
ministeiial meeting proposed for 1982. We also very much hope<br />
that maybe for the first time the GATT will be able to pay<br />
adequate attention to the problems of trade in agricultural products<br />
because in the past they have concentrated on industrial products,<br />
and barriers there have been reduced in significant ways, but<br />
barriers in agricultural trade have not really been reduced at all,<br />
especially from the European Community.<br />
We in-Australia are conscious of our fortune in being generously<br />
endowed with many sources of energy, and equally conscious of<br />
the important of energy in development, and of the need for<br />
developed countries to assist developing countries to adjust to<br />
the changing energy situation.<br />
' We support increased lending by the World Bank to developing<br />
' countries for development of energy resources and for conversion<br />
to more efficient forms of energy usage, and we support the<br />
establishment of the proposed World Bank energy affiliate todevelop<br />
new sources of oil and promote alternative energy sources.<br />
Finally, I would like to point to one important achievement<br />
already made through the North-South dialogue: the etablishmient<br />
of the Common Fund for commodities. Australia strongly supported<br />
this initiative. In particular at the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Regional Meeting in Sydney a few years ago, we announced<br />
attitudes markedly different to those of other developed count~ ries<br />
in a real effort to break the deadlock between the positions<br />
adopted by major groups of developed and developing countries.<br />
This is one of the things which is of concern to us; that there<br />
are rigidities in the negotiation process that often inhibits<br />
progress and makes progress difficult. Without being critical of<br />
either grouping, the Group of 77 come to a view, if that view<br />
is to be changed much work has to be done within the Group of 77<br />
itself and if a modification is needed to reach agreement to m.-ake<br />
a sensible advance, that modification can be hard to achieve in a<br />
speedy way through those processes. Equally, of course, the B Group<br />
have their own caucused position and if they need to modify a<br />
position to enable progress to be made through negotiation<br />
the modification of their own situation can b~ e difficult and hard<br />
to achieve. That had been the situation during the negotiations </p>
<p>AS DELIVERED<br />
on the Common Fund, and as a result of it Australia in a sense<br />
deserted the B Group and took a separate and independent position.<br />
In a sense, I suppose, we jumped into the middle ground. But I<br />
believe that breaking of the ranks, if it can be called that,<br />
was instrumental in causing people to assess their positions<br />
to enable progress to be made. But these are matters that all<br />
need to be examined very closely in the preparations for the<br />
global negotiations which we hope will take place in the coming<br />
months. Australian Ministers and officials had followed up with intensive<br />
discussions with many countries that had taken opposing positions<br />
on the Common Fund issue and as we now know, eventually the<br />
dialogue was renewed and the necessary compromises were worked out<br />
and agreement was reached.<br />
The Common Fund, by providing a mechanism for stabilising<br />
commidity prices and commodity trade, does offer mutual benefits<br />
Ito commodity producers and to consumers, and has the potential<br />
to contribute to the economic progress of developing countries<br />
through means in addition to aid, or other than aid, by providing<br />
more event returns for the commodities that they have to sell.<br />
The agreement to the Fund's establishment, moreover, provides an<br />
example of what can be achieved through dialogue pursued in a<br />
determined way. We now urge other countries to ratify that<br />
agreement so that it might come into effect at the earliest<br />
possible date.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, just as there is a need for truly global<br />
negotiations on the broad range of issues that comprise the<br />
North-South dialogue, so too there is a need for international<br />
meetings between countries with specific common interests and<br />
problems.<br />
, The International Bauxite Association provides a forum which<br />
permits member countries to exchange information and views on<br />
matters of common interest and concern. I hope that members<br />
will continue to find the International Bauxite Association<br />
a valuable forum for these discussions.<br />
It gives me very great pleasure indeed to formally declare this<br />
8th Session of the Council of ministers of the International<br />
Bauxite Association open, and to wish you every success in you~ r<br />
deliberations. I hope you not only have a productive time When<br />
you are in formal session, but I hope you also have some time to<br />
see a little of Australia and to enjoy something of AustralianL<br />
hospitality. 000---</p>
