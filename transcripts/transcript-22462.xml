    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened today to learn of the death of Peter Brock in a car accident in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Peter Brock was synonymous with motor racing in Australia having won the famous Bathurst 1000 race a record nine times. Such was his domination of the Mount Panorama event, he became known as the 'King of the Mountain'.</p>
<p>He towered above Australian motor sport in the 1970s and 80s and drove with such precision he was dubbed 'Peter Perfect' by his peers. He held more pole positions and won more races than any other driver since the inception of the Australian Touring Car competition.</p>
<p>He retired from front-line motor racing in 1997 and channelled his energy into promoting youth charities and road safety initiatives.</p>
<p>Peter will be sadly missed by his fans, the motor sport fraternity and the many people and groups he supported.</p>
<p>On behalf of my wife and myself and the Australian Government, I extend my deepest sympathies to Peter's family, friends and the motor racing community.</p>
