PRESS STATEMENT NO. ZZ 2.<br />
April 1974<br />
PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE TO PARTIES IN PRICES JUSTIFICATION<br />
TRIBUNAL INQUIRIES<br />
For some time now it has been apparent that provision<br />
should be made to assist in the presentation of cases in<br />
the consumer interest at Prices Justification Tribunal<br />
inquiries. It is important that adequate presentations be<br />
made to the Tribunal so that it will have all relevant aspects<br />
of the matter before it during its deliberations. I pay<br />
tribute to the quality of the Tribunal's past reports and<br />
do not in any way question the ability of the Tribunal to take<br />
full account of the public interest in all its inquiries.<br />
The arrangements that will now take effect are intended<br />
solely to assist the Tribunal in this onerous task.<br />
In the first place, the Government will, in approved<br />
circumstances, provide assistance in the form of information<br />
and advice to parties making a general public interest case to<br />
the Tribunal. Requests for such assistance should be<br />
forwarded to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet,<br />
which will make any necessary inquiries from other Government<br />
agencies and communicate as appropriate with the party<br />
concerned. In addition to this, the Government will, in<br />
appropriate cases, provide assistance with the cost of<br />
preparation and presentation of submissions to the Tribunal.<br />
In this respect the following arrangements will now operate:<br />
A prerequisite for assitance is that the applicant<br />
has been granted leave by the Tribunal under Section<br />
of the Prices Justification Act to take part as a<br />
party in an inquiry.<br />
Applications may be made on the following grounds:<br />
that the applicant represents the interests<br />
of a substantial number of consumers;<br />
( ii) that the applicant is capable of effectively<br />
representing the interests of consumers before<br />
the Tribunal; </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( iii) that it is desirable that the applicant take<br />
part in the inquiry in order that the interests<br />
of consumers will be adequately and effectively<br />
represented before the Tribunal;<br />
( iv) that the cost to the applicant of taking part in<br />
the inquiry would impose a burden on it that<br />
it ought not fairly be required to bear;<br />
and that in all the circumstances it is reasonable that<br />
assistance be granted.<br />
Any assistance may include financial assistance. A<br />
determination will be made of the contribution to be<br />
made towards the applicant's costs of the inquiry and<br />
the extent of the costs that the applicant should be<br />
left to bear. Assistance may be granted either<br />
unconditionally or subject to conditions.<br />
The determination whether assistance is to be granted,<br />
and if so, the amount of such assistance will be made<br />
by the Prime Minister or by a Minister designated by him.<br />
A person or organisation desiring assistance should make<br />
application to the Prime Minister setting out the following<br />
information: an indication of intention to apply for leave to<br />
take part in an inquiry;<br />
( ii) if an organisation, particulars of the organisation<br />
and the nature of its membership;<br />
( iii) a statement of financial capacity;<br />
( iv) a short statement of the purpose of intervention<br />
in the inquiry;<br />
al estimate of the costs likely to be incurred<br />
in the inquiry; and<br />
( vi) a request for a stated contribution towards costs<br />
with reasons for that request.<br />
An application will finally be determined once the applicant<br />
obtains the leave of the Tribunal to take part in the inquiry.<br />
Applications in relation to participation in past as well as<br />
current or future inquiries by the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal will be considered on the same basis.<br />
