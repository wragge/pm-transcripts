FOR PRESS PM. No. 52/ 1969<br />
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR DARTMOUTH DAM<br />
The Prime Minister and Treasurer met with representatives<br />
of the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in<br />
Canberra today to discuss the financial arrangements for the building of the<br />
proposed dam near Dartmouth on the Mitta Mitta River.<br />
Agreement had been reached by the responsible State Ministers<br />
earlier in the year regarding other conditions that would apply in relation<br />
to this proposal. But agreement to proceed with the project was subject to<br />
the availability of some Commonwealth financial assistance over and above<br />
the usual provision with River Murray Commission Works whereby the<br />
Commonwealth pays one quarter of the capital cost.<br />
It was agreed that the Commonwealth would, in addition<br />
to paying its own share, lend to each of the States at the long-term Bond<br />
interest prevailing at the time when the loan was made one half of their<br />
share of the costs. Such loans would be subject to the usual interest<br />
payments, but repayment of capital would be deferred for ten years and<br />
would take place over the subsequent fifteen years.<br />
The Commonwealth and all States also agreed, without<br />
prejudice that, as soon as the cost of the Lake Victoria works is known,<br />
further discussions will be held on methods of financing them.<br />
This arrangement is subject to confirmation by the New<br />
South Wales Government.<br />
