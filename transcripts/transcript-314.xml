I am credibly informed that as wve sit here, moro or less in<br />
comfor~ t, there are other people clustorinj around foundation stones add<br />
switohos, hanng on our ever~ y uord. That may or may hot bo the case,<br />
but I'vo been inf'ormned that it Is, and so I must got on uith rWy job.<br />
I will follow the order that you followed, S3ir$ and speakz ffirst about<br />
a natt% of uhich I am an utter master, the Tandem Slectro-static<br />
Gonor'atorJ ( Laughter)<br />
There are two things among~ many that oeccito ny a&amp;-iz'ctiori in<br />
Professor Tittertono The first is that he Is a persistent Tollow and<br />
nevor ta! hos " Hol" t for an answer, The socond is that he pronounces this<br />
contromosial viord 11labgratoryll which is, aftor all, much oaoior than<br />
11 . ab-) ratory" Iand Indeed, m~ uch loss liable to misinterprotatpiofl<br />
( Ldueghtor) Nlow I just t-ant to toll you this about titi Tando3 ' ectrostatic<br />
Gonratoro It came up to me because, f'or somo odd roason<br />
thoaah It hasntt worked out too badly from the point of view of the<br />
Univo7-sity, I happen to be their MI-nicter. They brush o-mrybody<br />
asido, they cora Into my rooo and they lay do= m the lau to mle, '. 1ell,<br />
I s~ ioudn't say " lay down the law" be cause I miGht have somo<br />
opportunity of correcting them on that. B~ ut they produco tc.<br />
icoan.-! Jhon this one came up I twas completely baffled as to what It<br />
was, Nzdoed, it vas only yesterday that I said to my uifoe, who is a<br />
perfoct raine of unscientific inforwationg " Do you Ino; w, my, doar, w'hat<br />
Tm-idon Gonarator is?" S3he said, " E3vorybody 11nows that a Tandedm is<br />
bicycle built 20: 0 two". B~ ut I oaid " This one cost hal~ f a illion!"<br />
( Laughtor) She said " It must be studded with diamonds". Yola knoxi,<br />
joi-illod in evory movemaent. B~ ut really, we were quite my~ ifleo<br />
I cant an eye on to Sir 1,, 1ark Oliphant, who is a fount of<br />
visdom for us, and he gave it a benevolent look. Ile saidt ' Yon, he<br />
thoaCght this had a great deal of merit, ' that it would open up a now<br />
phase of' thbis tre-nendously important rosearch work that hae boon<br />
goinE; on in this depar'txont. As for Profossor Tittorton, ho had no<br />
doubt about it. Bly the time he had finished writh me I tiondored<br />
vhether perhapu wo shouldn't have three ( jLaughtoi) you knou Lit a<br />
a. i~ ht price advantage if tie took throo, instead of one. that's<br />
the kind of man he Is*<br />
Then I thought., " No, no,) ve must got back to what ;. eY talk<br />
about i. n politias.., but seldom practise, the 6great principlo of<br />
priorltles". 03o I asked the then almost newly formed Acadeny of'<br />
Sclonco whother It trould care to advise us on this matter# iknd It<br />
Savo tis a high priority. Well that left us defenceloess, if not to<br />
our enemtes at any rate to our friends. And so all that rouained for<br />
Ejo ygiu to onrgaj~ In the triflin-exercise of persuadinG tize Treasury<br />
that half a million pounds vould bo well spent in this direction.<br />
And tkie Treasury, still rooling from the blows of the uIurz'ay<br />
Comtu. uion and uhat was to come thoreafter collapsod# more or los$<br />
and in a small voice said, " All right", fith proper roserv.-ionog and<br />
without creating a procedentf and without all those othor Whings that<br />
