TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UJE, 13 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PM: How are you John?<br />
JL: I am pretty good. What about you?<br />
PM: I am as fit as a fiddle.<br />
JL: Good on you. Before I turn you over to the listeners for a couple of questions, let's take a<br />
couple from my end to begin with. The last time you were here at the end of July, it was just<br />
after Wayne Goss had just crept over the line to win the Queensland election. The result of<br />
that regarded as the fault of the unpopularity of you and the Government in mid July. Is that<br />
why Wayne Goss refers to you as, I quote the Queensland Premier directly, " a Southern<br />
politician"?<br />
PM: Well that depends where you live, I think, in Queensland. I mean from Far North Queensland<br />
down they think everyone is a Southern politician.<br />
JL: Do you see it as being an insult?<br />
PM: Oh, no, I don't think so. It is just one of those things. Look I think Wayne is going to do real<br />
well there. He has taken the job on with great gusto. I mean I think the election campaign..<br />
obviously it didn't turn out for him, the last election, as he expected. But he is the Premier, he<br />
has got on with the job, he is doing a good job and I think Queensland has really got the wind<br />
behind its sails. Whenever you go there, in any part of it, you always feel it has got the<br />
growth, it has got the population growth, it has got a temperate climate, it has got the tourism,<br />
it has got the linkages to Asia, it is really off and running. And the best thing, I think, that can<br />
happen to Queensland is that the Government gets on with the job.<br />
JL: Yes, it has got that terrfic new train that you drove the other day, too?<br />
PM: Well that is right. You see that is the fastest growing growth corrdor in Australia from<br />
Brisbane to the Gold Coast, which reflects again the movement of people into Queensland<br />
and, of course, it was only cars, cars and roads. And under the Better Cities program of the<br />
Commonwealth, we have made a very big contribution to building a new railway from Robina,<br />
the Gold Coast, connecting up to Brisbane which is going to change the lives of hundreds of<br />
thousands of people when it gets going. It is a few weeks from being opened I think.<br />
JL: The latest national accounts confirmed a record of 17 quarters of economic growth in<br />
Australia. In light of that, are you sorry you didn't take the December option for the election?<br />
PM: Oh no, I have been saying all year, John you will have noticed that I think the public expect<br />
us to get full I mean they are only three year Parliaments, they are not five years as in<br />
Britain, or four years as in the United States. They are three years here and cutting them<br />
short you are into a couple of years. And I think the public are cynical about that sort of stuff </p>
<p>Governments sort of trying to grab a time of their choosing and we have kept on with the job.<br />
Look, just in the last week, we have released the Innovation Statement and a big statement<br />
on a change to public housing. In other words, we are using the time and keeping the policy.<br />
And, as you quite correctly say, I was very happy about the fact it is 17 quarters of<br />
consecutive growth 4 1/ 14 years of growth. That is the longest period of growth since 1945.<br />
JL: Okay, let's take a caller. Hello.<br />
C: Hello.<br />
JL: Okay, go ahead talk to the Prime Minister.<br />
C: Yes, good morning Prime Minister. Thank you for speaking to me.<br />
PM: Pleasure.<br />
C: Prime Minister, what commitment are you going to give to small business. Small business is<br />
the largest employer of people in Australia and small business, at this point in time, is<br />
struggling like mad. What can your Government do for us?<br />
PM: Well the biggest thing we can do for you is to give you a growth economy. As you know, the<br />
economy has been growing at between 6 per cent and 4 per cent over the last few years. We<br />
are running, at the moment, at about 3 1/ 2 per cent to 3.7 per cent. And we are seeing a lot<br />
of employment growth. We have had, now, 730,000 jobs since the election. Now all that<br />
increases purchasing power. It increases the buoyancy in the economy and I think the other<br />
point worth noting, is that despite the fact it is the longest period of growth since the war.<br />
Even in our fifth year of growth 4 1/ 4 years behind us, in our fifth year now the broadest<br />
measure of inflation we saw in last week's national accounts came out at just under 3 per<br />
cent, 2.8 per cent. So this, for Australia, is a mighty record. A long period of growth, low<br />
inflation, strong job growth. They are the biggest things that I think the small business<br />
community need.<br />
JL; Now, Prime Minister, can we just go back to the caller because you might have some<br />
specifics in mind as to what you feel the Prime Minister should be doing for small business.<br />
Have you got any specifics in mind?<br />
C: Yes, well small business, at this point in time, is struggling like mad. We have had no flow on<br />
from all the fancy statistics the Prime Minister is giving us. You know we hear statistics, but<br />
small business is still struggling. What can the Government do to help small business?<br />
I appreciate all the statistics, but they are not helping us directly.<br />
PM: Well they are not just statistics. It is actually growth.<br />
C: Well why aren't they helping us then?<br />
PM: Well it is obviously helping some people more than others. But I mean imagine how you<br />
would be unhelped if we had, you know, a recession, or low growth, or we hadn't had that<br />
strong employment growth. I mean it is that strong employment growth that keeps retailing<br />
strong. I mean you look at the retailing numbers over the last few years, that is a measure of<br />
the sort of purchasing power in the economy, or purchasing trends. This affects the small<br />
business community. The other thing in that statement the other day the Innovation<br />
Statement that we did specifically for small business is for those who are in need of capital,<br />
we have now given the banks the right to invest equity rather than debt in the companies. A<br />
lot of smaller businesses don't have enough retained earnings to grow. So what we have<br />
done, in a sea change to banking policy in Australia, we are now saying to the major banks,<br />
you can invest In equity if you like. So let's say a business has got some real potential. But<br />
the owner just can't find the next $ 300,000, or the next $ 1/ 2 million, or even the next<br />
$ 1 million. The banks can invest in that company and then sell their equity later on down the<br />
track when the business is up and running and going strongly.<br />
JL: Can I ask the caller? What do you believe is the problem with your small business? If you<br />
have got a problem with your small business, why have you got a problem? </p>
<p>C: Well we believe people just aren't spending. People are holding back on spending in the<br />
retail areas and we just can't understand why. In days that have gone by 3, 4 and 5 years<br />
ago people would come in buy. Today they are not buying.<br />
PM: What business are you in?<br />
C: This Christmas is probably one of the weakest Christmas's we have ever had.<br />
JL: What sort of business have you got?<br />
C: We are in jewellery.<br />
JL: I see.<br />
PM: Yes. Well, can I just say, it depends also where you are because one of the trends in<br />
Australia has been towards, you know, more shopping centres, large retail shopping centres.<br />
And, if you are in one of those, you tend to pick up the passing trade and traffic. If you are in,<br />
what you may call, a suburban retail situation, you could find if there is another large outlet<br />
nearby that that starts to affect business. And, of course, one of the things which I think<br />
Bishop Rainer said in Victoria about Victoria, in particular, where we have seen gambling now<br />
starting to knock around retail incomes.<br />
JL: Where are you calling from?<br />
C: From Sydney.<br />
JL: Okay. Prime Minister, are you suggesting the same thing may be happening in New South<br />
Wales?<br />
PM: Oh, I think, in New South Wales people up there have been used to it. They have been<br />
pulling the pokies for that many years that they have adjusted to them I think. But the only<br />
other thing I can see to our caller is that it is basically income growth. We have had real<br />
growth in wages this year, you have still got low inflation, you have got the economy growing<br />
quite strongly and you can see we had 112,000 job growth in the month a phenomenal<br />
figure just a week ago.<br />
JL: So are you really saying to the caller that there is not much more that can be done?<br />
PM: Well I don't think from the Government's point of view, in that respect, no.<br />
JL: Do you accept that caller?<br />
C: No, I don't. I would like maybe if the Prime Minister could give a guarantee, or an assurance,<br />
that small business can liaise with him directly?<br />
PM: Well they do that. Well we meet the small business..<br />
C: We could speak to you and directly give you our grievances and I am sure between the small<br />
businesses and the Prime Minister's Department, or the Government, we could try and<br />
improve things because they are really not good at this point in time.<br />
JL: Okay, well..<br />
C: We are in a major regional shopping centre and business is not good.<br />
JL Okay, well the Prime Minister has made the point and I will have to say goodbye to you.<br />
PM: Can I just say, we have a Minister for Small Business and he has regular meetings with the<br />
peak small business councils and, you know, not every small business in Australia is going to<br />
be feeling as though they are doing well. But, again, I can only repeat the point we have<br />
never had a longer period of growth, since the war, than this one and we are having it with<br />
low inflation and strong job growth. </p>
<p>JL: Let me just look at a couple of faxes and notes that have come to us on the Intemnet. This<br />
one is in reference to foreign investment and tariffs. " Prime Minister, we know it is to make<br />
us more competitive with the teeming millions in Asia. But short of reducing our pay to $ 1<br />
dollar an hour, how are we supposed to keep a small business going with all the utopian<br />
requirements for workers your Govemnment demands if tariffs are phased out?"<br />
PM: Well wages is not the problem in Australia. This is still a relatively low labour cost country<br />
and that is why you find all these major businesses around the world, locating their<br />
headquarters in Australia. They have a choice of picking which of the Asian economies they<br />
wish to come to and many have chosen Australia and I don't think wages are a problem here.<br />
I mean this is the point I keep making to Mr Howard. He sees us as a sort of low wage cost<br />
country, that is in there competing on, basically, unskilled jobs and low grade jobs in<br />
manufacturing. The model I see is one of a higher wage country with product innovation,<br />
intellectual content, selling elaborately transformed goods and that is why we changed the<br />
education system from three young people in ten completing secondary school ten years ago,<br />
to nearly eight in ten now. A huge boost to universities etc.<br />
JL: Okay, well we will come to that in a moment or two. Just let me go back to this note that I got<br />
back. I am quoting from Mrs Joy Hutton: " Before the Labor Party decided that tariffs were<br />
set up to protect rich squatters, cow cockies and beastly businessmen, we had full<br />
employment, a basic wage, private health insurance and a good public health system, equal<br />
employee/ employer superannuation contributions, full vaccinations and health screening and<br />
a thriving small business sector, manufacturing everything we needed. It was admitted after<br />
1972 that dropping the tariffs would throw thousands out of work, so expensive retraining<br />
schemes and how to enjoy more leisure courses were introduced. What was the advantage<br />
of rushing in and destroying all those great little businesses?"<br />
PM: Well that is nearly all wrong. That is nearly all wrong. The whole analysis there is wrong. I<br />
mean manufacturing production was falling. By 1983, manufacturing was in such a state that<br />
there had been a one third reduction in manufacturing jobs in about five years. The economy<br />
was growing at less than 2 per cent now it is growing on average around 3 1/ 2 per cent to 4<br />
per cent.<br />
JL: She is talking about early 1970s, when the tariffs were dropped, when Gough Whitlamn..<br />
PM: No, well they weren't dropped. I mean what happened was tariffs rose again in the 70s under<br />
Malcolm Fraser and John Howard. This Govemnment started taking tariffs down in 1987/ 88<br />
and will be down to an average level of 5 per cent by 1996/ 97. In the period since the<br />
Govemnment reduced tariffs, exports have gone from 13 per cent of all we produced to 22 per<br />
cent. That is worth $ 45 billion extra a year in exports. Just imagine where we would be, now,<br />
without it and manufacturing production has doubled and the fastest growing component of<br />
our exports is elaborately transformed goods. Look at cars. Did you know a car now, had we<br />
kept the tariffs that your writer suggests, the average car would now be $ 10,000 or $ 12,000<br />
dearer. And the quality in the last ten years has improved profoundly. I mean you pick up,<br />
now, a Commodore, or a Ford, or a Toyota. You look at the quality of the cars compared to a<br />
decade ago and look at the price. Why should Australians, Australian families, pay an<br />
enormnous price for cars of low quality when they can now get them at much cheaper prices<br />
and higher quality and the same goes for shirts, for shoes, for clothing, for all those things.<br />
That is why our standard of living has come up because we are not putting this huge penalty<br />
on people with tariffs. And the rest of the world Is bringing their tariffs down too. That is what<br />
APEC is about, John. You see Indonesia announced a big package a couple of weeks ago,<br />
China the same.<br />
JL: Can we just have a look at Joy Hutton, very quickly, and Mrs Hutton we will have to finish<br />
with you after this. But just look at what she says here. " We had full employment." Did we<br />
have full employment?<br />
PM: No, not then we didn't. We haven't had full employment since the 1960s and we had that<br />
because, basically, the world was paying us a fortune for primary exports, agriculture and<br />
minerals. That all changed. The game went very sour by the late 70s, early 1980s. When<br />
you and I did that Interview where I talked about the Banana Republic, John, our terms of<br />
trade were at the lowest since the Depression in the 1930s. That is the prices we were paid<br />
for those things. I mean the happy days finished about the time Bob Menzies retired and </p>
<p>from 1965 to 1983, the place turned into sort of industrial archaeology. It was, basically, an<br />
industrial rust bucket. It is not now, fortunately.<br />
JL: Okay, well Joy Hutton, I know that you would have liked to have heard a lot more in answer.<br />
It is very difficult for the Prime Minister to cover it all. It is very for us too and I am sure you<br />
understand, Joy, and thank you for taking the time to send us the fax. Here is one that comes<br />
from I can't tell you where some kitchen specialist fellow. This is to you, Prime Minister.<br />
" Would not be dead for quids. The country may have its problems, but to you and the Prime<br />
Minister I am the luckiest man in the world. I have a lovely wife and two healthy boys. I have<br />
a successful business, a one man show and a couple of cars, a good roof over my head, that<br />
is keeping the dream alive. Best regards and merry Christmas to you and the Prime Minister.<br />
Ric in the Riverina.<br />
PM: Good on you Ric. Yesterday I was in Bendigo and I met a number of people in business and,<br />
in fact, I gave an export award to a business which has developed a vaccine business selling<br />
into Australia, that is veterinary vaccines for animals for the farm sector, selling into Australia<br />
and to Asia. You know, growing strongly, about to double the size of the business, about to<br />
build a second factory. I get those sorts of stories all over the place.<br />
JL: Ok, while we are on that subject, John Howard today is on the headland again. Not the<br />
soapbox, but the headland..<br />
PM: on the headland..<br />
JL Yes, he is expected to talk about the virtues of Australians and the virtues of Australia. Do<br />
you detect any anti foreign investment message coming out of this headland speech?<br />
PM: Well, yesterday he said I am as representative of the Australian mainstream, my values,<br />
my hopes, my aspirations are those of the mainstream Australian community I mean, who<br />
is he trying to fool? He was telling us a couple of years ago, he is the most conservative<br />
leader the Coalition party's have ever had.<br />
JL: People do change.<br />
PM: Oh yes, but he has decided to become a social democrat. I don't know what he'll become<br />
next. A Fabian socialist, maybe a concert pianist. Anyway on foreign investment he has<br />
been saying for years things like this the time has come for Australia to abandon totally all<br />
investment restrictions and abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board Put simply, we<br />
now need all the equity and the investment we can get. On another occasion he said we<br />
really can't have it both ways. If we don't bring capital into Australia, not having enough<br />
ourselves as a nation, we need to put up with a much lower otherwise standard of living<br />
JL: And do you detect an about face coming on that?<br />
PM: I think he is making this case that, particularly in the media, we should be letting Australian's<br />
own it and not foreigners. This is all code, I think, basically for letting Kerry Packer own the<br />
Sydney Momning Herald and The Age as well as the Nine Network in NSW and in Victoria.<br />
JL: Your policy is to try to promote diversity in ownership.<br />
PM: And it has. The cross media rule has kept there is a new set of owners in radio,<br />
independent from the newspapers. A diverse set of owners in the newspapers and a separate<br />
set of owners in television. In the old days, for instance, John Fairfax and Sons owned the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, the Australian Financial Review, it owned Channel Seven<br />
in Sydney and in Brisbane, it owned the Macquarie radio network.<br />
JL: True.<br />
PM: Now, of course, the Macquarie network is owned by different radio groups. Channel Seven is<br />
owned In part and controlled by Mr Kerry Stokes, a completely new and different owner.<br />
JL: Yes, but did it matter when the Fairfax family owned all those things, I mean was Australia<br />
damaged by that ownership? </p>
<p>PM: Well, it meant that you got the view from Jones Street, Broadway transmitted right through<br />
the whole media chain and what was happening was we were getting more concentration. As<br />
they were to drop out, basically their assets would have then fallen to Mr Murdoch and Mr<br />
Packer only. Can I just say this, John Howard said, this which was interesting John, on<br />
foreign ownership of the media he said no I don't have any hang-ups about foreign<br />
ownership. It seems that the people who oppose foreign ownership vigorously and zealously<br />
and almost religiously in the media are, in fact, doing more than anyone else to increase the<br />
level of concentration in ownership because it is the powerful overseas players that have got<br />
the capacity to provide the alternative to News Limited.'<br />
That is in 1991. In 1995 he has gone over again 180 degrees and now he says he is in favour<br />
of Australian ownership in the media and that is only code for one thing, that is, how he can<br />
wriggle out of the claim I put upon him that basically he wants to provide Mr Packer and his<br />
organisation with control of a major television network and the principle newspapers in the<br />
country.<br />
JL: You can understand the point he is making and just back to what you said about the Fairfax<br />
organisation. I worked for the Farifax organisation at the time that they had Channel Seven,<br />
the Herald, the Age, the Financial Review, the lot and the Macquarie broadcasting network<br />
and there was never any editorial interference there I have to say.<br />
PM: Oh, they don't muck about with you mate. They think you might leave and when you leave<br />
the station profits leave with you. So, they gave you a wide berth, but for others though there<br />
was always a line. Look, it is just this thing about John Howard, he is out there saying ' I am in<br />
the mainstream' where he was making a virtue a few years ago saying he is the most<br />
conservative leader the Coalition has ever had. He has now done a back flip on ownership, I<br />
mean, it is all this sort of view and can I just say he is trying to say to people that he will give<br />
them a republic, I hope he doesn't say anything about it because the fact is he doesn't want<br />
one and he has a plan to deny Australians a republic and he has got years of passionate<br />
support for the monarchy behind him.<br />
JL: We had better go to a caller, otherwise we will spend the entire time talking about John<br />
Howard.<br />
C: I'd like to speak to the Prime Minister.<br />
PM: I'm all ears.<br />
C: Good morning, sir.<br />
PM: How are you going?<br />
C: Good. I've been listening to you of late talking about what you are going to do about welfare<br />
housing and giving them some sort of percentage break, what I want to know is what are you<br />
going to do for somebody like my wife and myself who are paying the variable rate of 10.5<br />
per cent and battling?<br />
PM: Let me just tell you what we have done for a start. In the late 1980s, I was the Treasurer and<br />
I deregulated housing lending. Something my predecessor didn't do. What used to happen<br />
in his day is you could get a housing loan for 13.5 per cent, but only to about $ 27,000. They<br />
then gave you a second mortgage which would be at 2 or 3 percentage points above that. So<br />
you would have another $ 20,000 at say 15 per cent. And then you get a personal loan at 18<br />
per cent for the last $ 10,000 or $ 15,000 because banks had to ration money for housing<br />
because they couldn't borrow on the market to lend it. They couldn't bid for it in an open<br />
system. Now they can bid for the deposits in an open system and they can actually lend them<br />
as consolidated mortgages. So, you have a consolidated mortgage or you have the capacity<br />
to get a consolidated mortgage and the rate is around 10.5 per cent. The repayments on that<br />
mortgage would save you thousands a year compared to what would have been the case<br />
before housing was deregulated and you could have one consolidated mortgage.<br />
The other thing is by introducing competition in the banking sector we have got now real<br />
competition in the supply of housing funds. Specialist housing lenders coming out and in that </p>
<p>environment you can see both fixed rate and variable rate mortgages coming down in price<br />
as banks have to respond to one another to now some of the super funds, to now some of the<br />
specialist housing lenders such as the schemes, say, the Macquarie Bank and others are<br />
running against the main four and as a result we are seeing people switching mortgage<br />
lenders and having a much better menu of people to borrow from at much cheaper rates.<br />
JL: Ok, could we ask the caller because I think it is important that we understand, what do you<br />
expect. Can you tell me what your expectations are?<br />
C: Well, John, this is what the people that I talk to in the circles that I move in and they have<br />
basically got the same rate as what I have got. They are just sick of the Prime Minister telling<br />
everybody about what is going on in the welfare system and not helping us because we are<br />
battling too and we are paying the tax.<br />
PM: What is your basic income?<br />
C: I am earning about $ 40,000 a year and I have got the average $ 1 00.000 mortgage.<br />
PM: Yes, ok, but understand the point that there would have been a time in the 1980s where you<br />
wouldn't have got a $ 100,000 mortgage. I mean, you wouldn't have had the house. Can I get<br />
you to understand this point, there would not have been a mortgage for you.<br />
C: Houses were cheaper then.<br />
PM: Cheaper or not..<br />
JL: Wages were down too.<br />
PM: Houses were cheaper, but the difficulty was that you couldn't get a mortgage. If you didn't get<br />
some money from relatives or someone else to bridge some of the gaps you just couldn't get<br />
the mortgages because the banking system couldn't give them to you. And they couldn't give<br />
you a mortgage certainly to that sort of level at these sorts of prices. Can I just say about<br />
housing the other day, what we did in housing is for people further down the income scale..<br />
JL: But, he is worried about him and he is kind of in the middle. He is middle Australia and there<br />
are a lot of people expressing concern for that area.<br />
PM: Indeed, but again, what keeps that mortgage at around that 10 per cent level or for some<br />
people as low as 8.5 per cent, between 8.5 and 10 per cent and the answer is low inflation.<br />
And what keeps that low inflation rate in place? The government's policies and the accord<br />
with the unions. If we didn't have sensible wage outcomes, if we had a tear-away industrial<br />
relations system, you wouldn't be looking now at the broadest measure of inflation turning up<br />
2.8 per cent. It would be back to 5, 6, 7, 8 again and for every percentage point you can just<br />
add that on to your interest rate.<br />
JL: Can I say this to you, I understand the point you are making and I think that people would<br />
understand the point you were making too, but it is very difficult for somebody like the fellow<br />
we are talking to now, earning his $ 40,000 with his $ 100,000 mortgage and he believes he<br />
has a problem. It is very hard to make them feel good about the problem that they have now<br />
by saying it could have been a whole lot worse. It is true, it could have been 10 years ago<br />
more he might not have been even able to buy a house, but it doesn't help much now does<br />
it?<br />
PM: But, what am I to say to you John? That the person who has lent the money, the retired<br />
person, the saver, the person who has put their money in the bank or in a fixed deposit or<br />
some fixed instrument from which the banks have borrowed to lend to your caller, are they to<br />
get such a derisory rate of interest that they don't receive earnings on their deposits?<br />
Because, you see, anything in housing which is in the ranges we are in now is built on a<br />
relatively low inflation rate, low inflation and what is called the real rate of interest.<br />
C: Could I offer something else please?<br />
PM: Sure. </p>
<p>C: I am paying the 10.5 per cent. Would it be possible for you to give it a tax break after 8 per<br />
cent?<br />
PM: No, because what happens then is that the country starts then subsidising investment in<br />
housing and where ever you see a tax subsidy, you will start to see a flow of investment away<br />
from the things that are going to provide the jobs and the income and the security. And that<br />
is basically the plant and the equipment and the capital stock of the country. So, once we<br />
start saying that we are going to start subsiding house mortgages, you can forget the budget<br />
surplus. You can forget growth and investment in manufacturing. Soon you'll start to see<br />
employment levels coming down and it wouldn't be your mortgages you'd start worrying about<br />
then. You would start worrying about your job.<br />
C: But, you are subsidising other people in this country in relation to housing in your policy you<br />
have just announced.<br />
PM: Well, we are subsidising people who are on incomes of $ 18,000 or $ 21,000 or $ 22,000 with<br />
two or three kids. Yes we are and the reason we are doing that is we believe that those<br />
children in those families have a right to a roof over their head. It may not be a private house<br />
as you have it, it may be a house in a housing commission area or it may be a rental. What<br />
we are saying in our housing reforms the other day, is that the Commonwealth will take over<br />
income support or rental support in the private sector and the public sector. At the moment in<br />
the public sector, in public housing, this is done by the States.<br />
JL: Prime Minister, we will have to move on and to my caller I hope you understand we have<br />
given you as much time as we can.<br />
C: Thanks very much, John.<br />
PM: I was glad to speak to him, but can I just say John again, you have got essentially rates of<br />
interest now in housing which are built on that low inflation rate and every percentage point In<br />
that underlying inflation rate is another percentage For instance, let me cut a long story<br />
short. If the inflation rate wasn't three but say six per cent his interest rate wouldn't be 10 per<br />
cent it would 13 per cent.<br />
JL: I think he understands that and I thank you very much for the call. I'm sure that they<br />
understand, but it is very difficult and I understand the difficulty from your point of view to<br />
make people feel better by saying ' Well, you might be doing it tough and he feels he is doing it<br />
tough, but it could be a whole lot worse' And when you say that it is true 10 or 15 years ago,<br />
but it is very hard to cast your mind back and say ' well, thank God I didn't live then.'<br />
PM: I know, but again what do you say to the person who has got a nest egg in savings in<br />
retirement or is just a reasonable saver, who put their money away, to make those housing<br />
rates cheaper essentially the savers have got to subsidise the borrowers. Again, you won't<br />
get that sort of I mean, borrowers these days will demand the real rate of interest. That Is,<br />
a rate of interest above the inflation rate, so if you are talking about say a three per cent<br />
inflation rate and they are talking about four to five per cent real you are talking about seven<br />
to eight per cent and then the banks add their one per cent on and there you have it.<br />
JL: I understand clearly what you are saying, but I also understand it is difficult, particularly<br />
middle Australia feels that they are being a bit neglected, small business feels it is being a bit<br />
neglected too. Let me just read this fax from Helensvale in Old. Mr Keating, I am sure many<br />
people other than myself would be interested to hear why you refused to fly the Australian<br />
flag on the car provided to you by the people of Australia.<br />
PM: I just think getting around in a Commodore with a flag on the front is a bit comical, frankly.<br />
Saying, " here I am, aren't I important. Please notice me." I am just not into that sort of thing.<br />
I am quite happy to join the milling throng of traffic out there without going along like some<br />
potentate with a flag on the front fluttering. If it was on a big limo in New York with the US<br />
President in it you could understand it I suppose, but running around Sydney and Melbourne,<br />
as I do, and Canberra, in a Commodore with a flag fluttering on the front. I mean, I just think<br />
that it just gets a little bit comical to be saying " here I am". </p>
<p>JL: Yeah. Now, Leonora Fenwick of Helensvale from Queensland who sent me the fax I have<br />
to say to you Leonora, that some time ago I asked the Prime Minister the same question in<br />
the street. I saw him in the street, and I said to him I didn't know it was you have you got a<br />
flag on the car? And he gave me exactly the same answer he said, " give us a bekdriving<br />
around here with a flag on the front. Bad enough having people look at you anyway"<br />
So, he gave me the same answer, so he's not pulling your leg. But I'll go to the second<br />
paragraph of your fax also, why without being asked have the Australian people funded a<br />
Republican information kit, printed in 17 underlined languages. Will a similar kit be funded<br />
for the case for the Constitutional Monarchy?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, we have got a Civics Education Program running out there to tell young people<br />
in particular about the shape of the Constitution, the way our public institutions work, to give<br />
them a background in the history of it which is I think a very neutral thing. We proposed it<br />
with the States, and the States are taking it up. And that, I hope, is going to improve the<br />
understanding of the whole institutional structure of Australia by young people getting that at<br />
school. What I did recently was to simply release the speech I made in Parliament, putting<br />
the framework, and to flesh out some of the arguments and the details of that proposal.<br />
JL: Yeah, I also think it should be said to Leonora Fenwick you say here " and why, without being<br />
asked, have the Australian people funded a Republican Information Kit?" I don't think we<br />
elect Government's to have them ask us what they should do at every turn I think that some<br />
faith has to be placed in the Government, and I don't think that any Government would ask<br />
the general public every time it wanted to put it's hand in it's pocket, even though it might<br />
frustrate the general public. We better move on we'll take another call, Prime Minister.<br />
Hello?<br />
C: Hello?<br />
JL: Okay the Prime Minister is here.<br />
C: Yeah. It's Wayne McTeer, I have just got a question to do with... . well, particularly in regard to<br />
the Prime Ministers emphasis on savings, which of course is a terrific thing.<br />
JL: Can you keep your voice up a little bit for us?<br />
C: About the last time that there was a change made to the compulsory superannuation system,<br />
there was also a change made to the company tax rate, where he moved... . he originally had it<br />
at 39%, moved it down to 33% then at that point, he moved it back up to 36% from 33%. And<br />
at the same time, of course, he bought the payments forward. Now, the effect of moving it<br />
from 33% to 36% was to increase the tax by 3% which reduces the amount of funds<br />
available within a company by 3% out of what was 66% in other words, 1 in 11, or So<br />
that little move, reduced the money, or the funds that were available, for investment in a<br />
business there's nothing else you can spend it on, because as soon as you spend it on<br />
something personal, you get taxed at the personal rate, or as soon as you spend it on a car or<br />
something like that, you pay FBT. So, it can only be spent it on legitimate investment things,<br />
so that shift reduced the amount of funds available in all the businesses in the country for<br />
investment in capital equipment which he just said is very, very important, and of course we<br />
all agree with that by Now, what was the logic of that? What is the logic of reducing<br />
the amount of savings, reducing the amount of funds available for investment to businesses?<br />
PM: Well, the answer was that we provided you might remember in the One Nation statement<br />
some 2 or 3 huge concessions to business. One was accelerated depreciation of plant and<br />
equipment, where you could write off an asset over 40 years, you can now write it off over<br />
years. When you could write off an asset over 20 years, you can now write it off over 7. And<br />
where you could write it if over 5 years, you can write it off over 3. This produced a cost to<br />
the Budget of around $ 1500 million to $ 2000 million, and as well as that, we introduced 2<br />
investment allowances so you can write off 120% of certain investments, instead of writing off<br />
100% of their capital costs. That came at about another $ 1 billion. So, in other words, the<br />
Government had given concessions of around $ 3 billion and we had to get the Budget back<br />
into surplus for public savings, which we need for the Current Account and other things, and<br />
you have got to say " well, where should the weight fall? Should it fall on personal tax-payers,<br />
or should it fall to some extent modestly on companies that have been given so much?".<br />
You see, could I also just remind you when the Government came to office, the corporate </p>
<p>rate wasn't 36% it was 46%. And not only that, you paid personal tax on the dividends,<br />
where now you have got the relief of personal taxation on the dividends with a dividend<br />
imputation system. So that now you pay 36%, and you can keep 64 cents in every dollar in<br />
the company. In the 1980s, before I became Minister, you could keep only 22%.<br />
JL: Okay what were you going to say?<br />
C: You partly got elected on dropping the rate from 39% to 33%. And then you said well, that's<br />
going to be off-set by bringing the tax payments forward the company tax payments forward.<br />
Now, almost to the day of when the company tax payments started to go forward, you then<br />
put it back up to 36%.<br />
PM: But who should carry the burden of the change? Should it be the public working people<br />
with an increase in the personal tax rates? Or should it be companies who have been given<br />
so much?<br />
C: It just depends if you want to create jobs, if you want money to I1m ean, the bottom line of<br />
it is, do you want companies and small companies who have got the capacity to create a lot<br />
of jobs to invest in capital equipment? Because that's... . as you know from your own piggery,<br />
there is nothing else you can do with company money like that, bar invest it?<br />
PM: All right. But let me just take this point to you. Not that many years ago, you could keep only<br />
22 cents out of every dollar of company income before this Government introduced it's<br />
reforms. Now you can keep 64 cents you can keep three times as much. You pay your 36<br />
cents, and you can keep 64 cents in the company. You are not forced to distribute. In the old<br />
days, there was a thing called undistributed profit tax you were supposed to distribute. So, it<br />
went to you, and then you paid 60% personal rates at the margin. It's a huge revolution.<br />
Dividend imputation is now costing about $ 3.5 billion a year.<br />
C: We're talking about the last two years.<br />
PM: Yeah, but you can't just talk about the last two years. I have got to run an economy and a<br />
system, and the Budget we had to move the Budget balance from deficit back into surplus,<br />
and that's for the Current Account and investment. In other words, if we don't have a stronger<br />
level of public savings, there won't be the pool of national savings to draw the investments<br />
that you are correctly speaking about.<br />
C: Well, why did you why did you drop it from 39% back to 33%? Before the election it was<br />
back to...<br />
PM: No. We dropped that in, I think, 1989, or 88 from 39% back to 33%. Or it might have been<br />
1993. That is, to try and kick you might recall, in the last election in 1993 we were still<br />
coming out of a recession. So what we did, is we reduced the company rate from 39% to<br />
33%. We gave an investment allowance of 10%, and a second investment allowance of<br />
the ones I mentioned earlier. So in other words, all of that was to promote a big pick up in<br />
investment and it did. And that's why the investment is so strong, and why employment is<br />
so strong. But again, in the end, the Budget had to go back into balance and back into<br />
surplus. In other words, you help when things are slow, by reducing these rates, and putting<br />
these concessions in, and when things pick up again, the sector the business sector was<br />
able to afford a modest increase in the corporate rate.<br />
C: So, the company tax rate is just another economic lever that you can pull and pull every year<br />
or two.<br />
PM: No. It's<br />
C: I mean, it's been pulled twice since 1992 or 93, whenever the last election was.<br />
JL: 93.<br />
PM: Let me just make the point again </p>
<p>C: How can you plan a thing under that basis, and how do you expect people I mean, even<br />
now, you could have made investments and planned future investments in 93, just after that<br />
election, based on a certain rate. And then around about a year or two years later, the<br />
company tax rate is reduced again, and you have reduced the funds available by 9%.<br />
PM: Look, are you trying to argue to me the difference between 33% and 36% in the company rate<br />
is...<br />
C: It was 39%<br />
PM: Let me just get a word in here....<br />
C: It's<br />
PM: I know I can do my mathematics I'm not silly...<br />
C: I realise that.<br />
PM: Are you trying to argue that the difference between 33% and 36% 3% in the company rates<br />
is going to make all the difference in whether you invest or not? Because if you think if you<br />
are arguing that, let me assure you that's not what has happened with investment numbers.<br />
The reason we have got strong investment numbers there since that change, is because the<br />
whole of the economy is doing so well, and partly, that's because the Budget has moved back<br />
into surplus, it's because the pressure is taken off interest rates by reducing the bond-selling<br />
program. Do you know, this year as a result of the Budget last year, we sold $ 20-odd billion<br />
worth of bonds to fund it, this year we are down I think, from memory to about $ 6 billion?<br />
There's a $ 15 billion a $ 15,000 million reduction in the sale of the Commonwealth Bonds<br />
selling program. Do you know the pressure that takes off interest rates? And taking that<br />
pressure off interest rates has helped your business make investments, and given it a future,<br />
and if you had to look at that environment versus three percentage points on the corporate<br />
rate, I mean, there's just no comparison.<br />
JL: Okay. We'll have to move on I appreciate your call, and thank you for it. I hope you have a<br />
happy Christmas, and a tremendously successful next year. And Prime Minister, we're about<br />
to run out of time. What are your plans over the Christmas period are you going to have a<br />
break?<br />
PM: I'll have a couple of weeks off, I think, John and you know, try and regain my sanity in full with<br />
my family. And I know you're having a break yourself, and good on you.<br />
JL: Yeah, well, when we get to the end of the year, we feel like we have done a year, and it<br />
seems the older you get, you start to feel like you have done a couple of years.<br />
PM: This has been a satisfying year for me we have had, as I said, three-quarters of a million job<br />
growth since the election, we have got the Budget back into surplus, we have got the Accord<br />
underpinning the low inflation rate, we have got a framework for a republic out there, we have<br />
threaded together the biggest free-trade area in the world with APEC, I have just done the<br />
Innovation Statement for the business sector, and we have now got this huge public change<br />
in public housing. So, you know, I think that sort of activity I don't mind finishing the year, if<br />
you like somewhat worn down, getting those big changes into place. Because I think that's<br />
what the community reasonably expects Governments to do.<br />
JL: If you could give Australia a Christmas present, what would it be?<br />
PM: I think the continuation of strong growth in the next year which, at present, I think the<br />
Govemnment is giving the country with low inflation and further integrating ourselves, in this<br />
next 12 months, into Asia. I mean, I think they are the two things that are going to matter<br />
most to the sort of economy... . when I'm out of politics, and you're off radio John, they're the<br />
things that will stick to us.<br />
JL: Okay. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas, and I hope you have a a successful New Year<br />
I hope it is a wonderful year again for Australia, because it is a pretty important place to all<br />
of us. I sometimes wonder whether people fully understand the complications of running a </p>
<p>country I know that quite often I don't. But one would hope that you and your Government is<br />
doing it's best, as one would hope if John Howard were running the place, he would be doing<br />
his best as well. What are the chances of him running it?<br />
PM: Well, he might be doing his best, but the question is will his best be good enough for<br />
Australia in this point in it's history? And, you know, just one change there that I didn't<br />
mention in that group was the change in our forest policy, which tries to meet the dual aims of<br />
the environment and a sustainable logging industry. Two weeks ago, we put away under<br />
those deferred forest agreements, six million hectares of forest. And I think getting all<br />
that.... . you know, appreciating the great inheritance we have here on the Continent, and it's<br />
beauty, and it's nature, and at the same time, growing our industries in a way which is<br />
harmonious with the nature and, again, finding our place in that region. I mean, that sort of<br />
totality of view is the thing I think is the Government's trademark, and frankly, I just don't think<br />
the Coalition understands that debate at all. I just don't think that John Howard's view of the<br />
world which is basically to regard Asia as a problem, to not put that sort of premium on the<br />
environment, to not have faith in people to run a decent industrial relations system without<br />
trying to sort of press people into sort of contracts and grind them down I think a<br />
cooperative, inclusive model is the way for Australia to go, and I think the proof of the<br />
pudding is in the eating. We do have this strong growth, we do have the employment, we do<br />
have the low inflation, we do have the integration with Asia and we are getting the place we<br />
are putting a great premium under our environment.<br />
JL: Okay. Thank you very much for your time you have been very generous, as I said at the<br />
onset there wouldn't be too many world leaders who would front up and do it again, but I<br />
thank you very much for doing it, and I hope early in the New Year we can talk to each other<br />
again, and Happy Christmas.<br />
PM: Good John, and have a good holiday.<br />
JL Good. Bye.<br />
ends </p>
