TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH RADIO AUSTRALIA 1 JANUARY 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER AND RICHARD ANDREWS<br />
PUBLIC AFFAIRS RADIO AUSTRALIA<br />
THE INTERVENTION IS TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED IT'S QUITE<br />
PLAIN THAT THE FORMER LEADER WHO IS PRO-SOVIET WAS ACTING<br />
IN A WAY THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. AND THE SOVIETS,<br />
AND THEIR FRIENDS WANTED TO REPLACE HIM WITH ANOTHER<br />
PRO-SOVIET LEADER IN AFGHANISTAN. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT<br />
THAT STRATEGY WAS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL, RUSSIAN TROOPS<br />
WERE NEEDED. IT'S NO WONDER THAT THE COUP OF A COUPLE OF YEARS<br />
AGO HAS CAUSED DISSENT, THAT THERE IS FIGHTING WITHIN THE<br />
COUNTRY, BECAUSE AS WE'RE ADVISED THE REGIME THAT WAS<br />
DEPOSED A DAY OR TWO AGO, WAS A PARTICULARLY BRUTAL ONE.<br />
AND NOT ONE THAT WAS LIKELY TO WIN ANY LASTING SYMPATHY FOR<br />
THE COMMUNIST CAUSE. IF COMMUNISM WAS TO PREVAIL, IF THE<br />
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE WAS TO PREVAIL, IT WAS NECESSARY TO CHANGE<br />
LEADERS. ANDREWS: WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE RAMIFICATIONS FOR REGIONAL<br />
SECURITY OF THE SOVIET ACTION?<br />
WELL IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO LEAD TO A GREATER AREA<br />
OF UNCERTAINTY. IT'S BORDERING AN AREA THAT'S ALREADY A<br />
VERY SENSITIVE ONE, THERE'S NO NEED TO TALK ABOUT PAKISTAN'S<br />
CONCERNS, BUT THEY WILL ONLY BE HEIGHTENED. AND ON THE OTHER<br />
SIDE OF COURSE, THERE'S THE GRIEVOUS AND VERY DIFFICULT<br />
PROBLEM OF IRAN. NOV WITH RUSSIA PLAYING AN IMPERIAL GAME,<br />
AS SHE IS IN AFGHANISTAN, IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE THE<br />
TENSIONS WORSE AND ADD TO INSTABILITY IN THE REGION.<br />
ANDREWS: IF YOU SAY THAT RUSSIA IS PLAYING AN IMPERIAL GAME,<br />
DO YOU SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER SOVIET EXPANSION IN<br />
THE REGION? I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED THAT THE BASIC OBJECTIVE OF THE<br />
EARLIER CZARS HAS ALTERED.... IMPERIAL RUSSIA ALWAYS WANTED TO<br />
EXPAND, AND UNDER THE PRESENT LEADERSHIP WITH A DIFFERENT<br />
PHILOSOPHY THAT BASIC SOVIET DESIGN SEEMS NOT TO HAVE ALTERED.<br />
I'VE GOT NO DOUBT THAT RUSSIA WOULD SEEK TO EXTEND HER INFLUENCE<br />
WHEREVER POSSIBLE, BY ONE MEANS OR ANOTHER. AND IF THAT MEANS<br />
EXPLOITING UNSETTLED CONDITIONS, THEN THEY'LL CERTAINLY DO<br />
THAT. I ASKED THE AMBASSADOR YESTERDAY WHAT HIS POSITION WAS<br />
IN RHODESIA, IN ZIMBABWE. I SAID: " HERE SURELY YOU HAVE A<br />
SITUATION WHERE ALL PARTIES ARE IN AGREEMENT THE PATRIOTIC<br />
FRONT, FRONTLINE STATES, BRITAIN, BISHOP MUZORERA, EVERYONE<br />
NOW ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT THE SOVIET UNION WOULD BE ABLE<br />
TO SUPPORT, AND SUPPORT WHOLE -HEARTEDLY?" ALL THE<br />
AMBASSADOR COULD DO WAS TO SAY THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE<br />
POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS ON THAT ISSUE, THAT PART OF<br />
THE AGREEMENT.. THE FIGHTING WAS GOING TO CONTINUE, THERE<br />
WOULD BE A GREATER SUPPLY OF RUSSIAN ARMS, GREATER INCURSION<br />
OF CUBANS AND OF EAST GERMANS WHICH, YOU KNOW WOULD HOLD OUT<br />
THE PROSPECT AND THE POSSIBILITY, I SUPPOSE, IN THE SOVIET MINDS<br />
OF THEIR INFLUENCE IN THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.<br />
ANDREWS: WHAT WAS THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR'S REACTION TO YOUR<br />
. CRITICISMS OF HIS COUNTRY'S ACTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN?<br />
I THINK IT WAS ACCEPTED, I THINK IT WAS YOU KNOW.<br />
THE EXPLANATION THEIR MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN<br />
WAS SO WEAK, THAT HE MUST HAVE EXPECTED A REACTION. AND<br />
YOU KNOW I'VE SAID ON MA'Y OCCASIONS THAT I REALLY DO BELIEVE<br />
THAT MIDDLE RANKING POiWERS, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, HAVE AN<br />
OBLIGATION TO SPEA; THEIR ilI D ON MATTERS OF THIS KIND.<br />
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T, iMATTERS JUST GO BY DEFAULT. WE ARE<br />
Al INDEPENDENT ., ATIu'lm AND THAT MiEANS THAT THERE'S A VIEW<br />
THAT'S HELD STRONGLY AND WE ,' AiT TO EXPRESS IT. </p>
<p>ANDREWS: IS THE LATEST SOVIET ACTIOIN IN AFGHANISTAN GOING<br />
T HAE ANY EFFECT ON4 AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN POLICY, TWAD<br />
MOSCOW? I DON'T THINK IT ALTERS THAT AT ALL. IN PART OF THE<br />
CONVERSATION, I SAID THAT MY WISH WAS TO PROMOTE BETTER<br />
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND AUSTRALIA. OVER<br />
THE LAST YEAR OR TWO, VARIOUS EVENTS HAD OCCURRED WHICH<br />
INTERRUPTED THAT RELATIONSHIP ( YOU'LL REMEMBER THE BUGGING<br />
DEVICES, DISCOVERED IN OUR EMBASSY IN MOSCOW) AND THAT<br />
VARIOUS MATTERS IN NEGOTIATION WITH THE SOVIET UNION WERE<br />
THEN, YOU KNOW, PUT ON ICE. BUT I'VE POINTED OUT ON MANY<br />
OCCASIONS THAT THE WAY TO IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP IS TO DO<br />
IT BY MEANS OF TRADE OR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND NOT TO<br />
CONCENTRATE ON THE STRATEGIC AND POLITICAL MATTERS WHERE I'M<br />
QUITE CERTAIN THAT WE'VE GOT DIFFERENCES WHICH ARE VERY DEEP.<br />
BUT THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COUNTRIES<br />
AND THERE IS MUCH IN THE TRADE RELATIONSHIP THAT COULD BE<br />
IMPROVED AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT COULD BE<br />
IMPROVED. WE HAD MADE OUR OFFICIALS AVAILABLE TO TRY AND<br />
WORK OUT HARD-HEADED ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD ENABLE THAT TO<br />
TAKE PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY HAVEN'T MADE A GREAT DEAL<br />
OF PROGRESS. DOES THE FACT THAT AUSTRALIA'S JOINED CHINA IN<br />
CONDEMNING THE SOVIET ACTION SIGNIFY SOME KIND OF ANTI-MOSCOW<br />
AL IGNMENT? NO,@ I DON'T THINK SO, WE JUDGE EVENTS AS WE SEE THEM<br />
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I POINTED OUT TO THE<br />
SOVIET AMBASSADOR. IN MANY TERMS WE'RE AN ALIGNED POWER,<br />
BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP US TAIMNkG A TOTALLY INDEPENDENT VIEW,<br />
A VIEW THAT MvIGHT BE IN ADVANCE OR DIFFERENT TO THE UNITED<br />
STATES OR BRITAIN. THERE wAS A Th. IN DURIING OUR WINTER MONTHS,<br />
WHEN AUSTRALIA COULD HAVE BEEN TAKING QUITE A DIFFERENT VIEW<br />
FROM BRITAIN IN RELATION TO RHODESIA. IN THE END WE WERE ALL<br />
TAKING THE SAME VIEW BUT I THIN11K THAT WAS IN LARGE MEASURE DUE TO<br />
AUSTRALIA'S ADVOCACY BEING PREPARED TO STATE A POSITION WHICH<br />
AUSTRALIA BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT, WHICH I BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT.<br />
AND THEN OTHERS WERE PERSUADED TO THAT COURSE. BUT YOU KNOW<br />
IF THEY HADN'T BEEN PERSUADED TO THAT COURSE) IT OBVIOUSLY RAN<br />
THE RISK OF AUSTRALIA BEING AT ODDS WITH, IN A SENSE OUR<br />
CLOSEST FRIENDS. LOOKING GENERALLY AT THE REGION, HOW DO YOU SEE THE<br />
SOVIET ACTION IN TERMS OF THE INDIAN OCEAN ZONE OF PEACE?<br />
I SEE EVENTS THERE AND EVENTS IN IRAN MAKING<br />
A ZONE OF PEACE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. I ALSO<br />
SEE THEIR ACTIVITIES IN VIETNAM AS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT<br />
FOR THAT TO BE ACHIEVED. WHILE THE SOVIET UNION HAS NOT YET.<br />
ESTABLISHED MAJOR USE OF BASES, MILITARY BASES IN VIETNAM,<br />
THERE IS AN OCCASIONAL USE WHICH IS INCREASING. AND I WOULD<br />
EXPECT THEM TO TAKE MATTERS, STEP BY STEP, THAT OBVIOUSLY<br />
ENHANCES THEIR STRATEGIC POSITION. AND QUITE PLAINLY VIETNAM<br />
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UNDERTAKE THE INVASION OF<br />
KAMPUCHEA WITHOUT RUSSIAN MORAL AND M ILITARY SUPPORT MATERIAL<br />
SUPPORT. AND THERE IS A SOVIET VIETNAMESE TREATY WITH DEFENCE<br />
CLAUSES, AS WE KNOW, SO ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE, OVER THE<br />
LAST YEAR OR TWO, TENDED TO BE DISTURBING IN A PART OF THE<br />
WORLD THAT AFFECTS US, THAT WE'RE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN.<br />
BUT ON THE BRIGHTER SIDE,-THE SOLIDARITY AND STRENGTH OF ASEAN<br />
IS VERY MUCH TO BE COMMENDED AND THAT' S AN ARRANGEMENT<br />
BETWEEN NATIONS WHICH IS REALLY CO~ iTRIBUTING VERY GREATLY TO<br />
STABILITY AND PEACE IN THE AREA. AND A CARDINAL PLANK OF THEIR<br />
POLICY OF COURSE IS THAT THERE SHuULDN'T BE INTERFERENCE BY<br />
ANY OF THE GREAT POvIERS, Ai~ jD THAT'S SOINETHING THAT AUSTRALIA<br />
WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTS.<br />
R. A. O. K. SE,' LL THAviKS VERY i-MUCH FOR YOjUR TIME. I PROMISED<br />
OWEN LLOYD THAT I WOJULDN'T KEEP YOU FOR MORE THAN A FEW<br />
MINUTES SEEIN~ G THAT IT 4AS A PUBLIC HOLIDAY.<br />
