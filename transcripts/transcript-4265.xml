PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS I NOVEMBER 1976<br />
ADDRESS AT CHRYSLER INVESTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT<br />
I would like to thank Chrysler for this opportunity to make<br />
some remarks about the Australian motor vehicle industry<br />
generally on the occasion of the announcement of Chrysler's<br />
net-investment proposals.<br />
The motor vehicle industry is, obviously, of great importance<br />
to Australia's national economy and particularly-to<br />
South Australia.<br />
For all Australian industry, primary and secondly, the<br />
present times are difficult.<br />
The waste and extravagance we have seen in the previous<br />
years left the economy floundering and weakened our<br />
competitive position as a nation.<br />
The Government has halted its own runaway expenditure and is<br />
attacking inflation very vigorously. But that struggle<br />
is far from over.<br />
We always said that beating inflation would take a full<br />
parliamentary term and there is no reason to change that<br />
particular judgement.<br />
However, suppliers who now find that tendering has become<br />
more competitive, primary producers who have been suffering<br />
prolonged low returns, employees who have foregone full<br />
wage indexation, can take satisfaction from the fact that the<br />
fight against inflation is being waged successfully.<br />
The attitude that problems can be solved-if the Government spends<br />
more and more of the taxpayers money has been finally laid to rest.<br />
The rate of increase in tie Consumer Price Index has now<br />
fallen for three consecutive quarters.<br />
The increase in the September quarter is the lowest since<br />
the March quarter in 1973, apart from the special circumstances<br />
relating to health care last year. </p>
<p>Recent investment proposals by the motor vehicle industry<br />
are evidence of the faith that overseas investors have<br />
in Australia's economic policies. Without that confidence<br />
I do not believe that investments not only by Chrysler<br />
but also other segments of the motor industry would<br />
have taken place.<br />
This investment shows that the industry appreciates that<br />
the Government of Australia is determined to get on top of<br />
inflation. It indicates confidence in the Government's overall economic<br />
policies, and that the Government welcomes. investment in<br />
Australia. Chrysler has now given a further endorsement of the confidence<br />
shown by the industry and the future of manufacturing in<br />
Australia and in particular the future of motor vehicle<br />
manufacturing in Australia.<br />
The Ford Motor Company has announced-investments totalling<br />
$ 67 million. Nissan and Toyota have also announced substantial<br />
investment programmes, as have General Motors. The<br />
proposals announced today make total investment in the motor<br />
industry rise to very substantial heights.<br />
I believe.-we would not have had these announcements in the<br />
circumstances of last year. That they have been made in the<br />
circumstances of this year indicates confidence in the future<br />
of Australia by the industry and by the companies concerned.<br />
The plans announced by Chrysler are not only important for the<br />
industry as a whole and for Australia but they are also<br />
of special importance for South Australia where motor vehicle<br />
manufacturing is obviously very significant for the industrial<br />
development of the State.<br />
That is why I am delighted as I am sure the Premier is delighted,<br />
that Chrysler had made these particular decisions. They<br />
are of enormous importance to the many people employed in the<br />
industry in this particular State.<br />
The passenger motor vehicle industry, and the components<br />
industry which is associated with it, account for about<br />
9 percent of manufacturing employment in Australia and about<br />
2 percent of total employment This is about the same<br />
percentage as the mining sector. By any account, therefore,<br />
it is important in a national context.<br />
The steel, glass and rubber industries all benefit from motor<br />
vehicle manufacture.<br />
With the industry under pressure because of the consumer<br />
swing from six cylinder to four cylinder vehicles, as well<br />
as from inflation, and from pollution control requirements,<br />
the Government early this year took the decision to support<br />
the 85 percent local content plan for the motor vehicle industry. / 13 </p>
<p>This eases the constraints on the industry and gives it<br />
the opportunity to restructure, within itself, and with<br />
the aim of increasing its own competitiveness.<br />
In June this year the Government also announced that it<br />
would take action to make sure that about 80 percent<br />
of the Australian market for passenger motor vehicles<br />
was reserved for local industry.<br />
Following this decision and in the face of evidence that<br />
imports are likely to be well above 20 percent in the market<br />
next year, the Government referred the particular question<br />
of import restriction to the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
for a report by November 16.<br />
If that report shows that action is necessary to make sure<br />
that local manufacturers hold about 80 percent of the local<br />
market, then action will be taken by the Government to<br />
see that this is achieved. Thus the Government is playing<br />
its part in providing the appropriate environment for long<br />
term planning in this industry.<br />
The Government welcomes the very substantial investments<br />
of this company and other companies.<br />
it is fair enough to say that if this climate had not been<br />
established these investments would not have taken place<br />
because it is not reasonable to expect companies to lay out<br />
very large sums of money if they are not going to know the<br />
climate, and the environment in which they will have to operate.<br />
If it were not for the 85 percent car plan, and for other<br />
later measures, the investment by Chrysler and by other firms,<br />
would not have occurred.<br />
That would have been disastrous for the cities such as Geelong<br />
and States such as South Australia both of which depend<br />
heavily upon manufacturers in the motor industry.<br />
However, ultimately, the future of the industry depends on<br />
the people in it; upon the attitudes and approaches of<br />
people in the industy; on industrial relations in the'<br />
industry and the contribution that the industry and the companies<br />
make providing goods and ' services that are wanted by the Australian<br />
people. Ultimately the success of any enterprise depends upon<br />
the manner and extent-to which particular corporations can<br />
meet the consumer demands and requirements of the time.<br />
In this sense the consumer is the arbiter of what happens.<br />
The Government is determined to play is part.<br />
I would like to believe and I hope it is correct that what is<br />
happening now in the industry will begin a long period of<br />
stable and permanent development in the industry.<br />
We will remember that through the* 1950' s and 1960' s there was<br />
fairly stable and sensible development. Then inflation and<br />
cost rose very greatly, there were also tariff cuts which altered .4 </p>
<p>the competitive position of industry in relation to imports.<br />
As a result of those measures and after-the tariff cutsacross<br />
the board a very large number of imports came<br />
into the industry.<br />
I believe those measures upset the stability that the<br />
industry had known for-some time. Imports in those circumstances<br />
obviously claim too large a share of the market. Development<br />
in Australia, employment and production in Australia were coming<br />
to be seriously threatened.<br />
A number of ad hoc measures were taken over a period to<br />
redress that situation import quotas, and temporary<br />
reductions of local taxes to try and encourage greater<br />
sales of motor vehicles.<br />
I hope the ad hoc * stage is past. We are now into long term<br />
developmental plans that should auger well for the industry.<br />
