PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, JOHN CURTIN HOUSE, 8 DECEMBER<br />
1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there a need of better quality candidates<br />
not only in New South Wales, but federally?<br />
PM: Well, I think that all parties always ought to<br />
strive for the best quality candidates they can get. I<br />
think that the Labor Party in a strange, mysterious,<br />
unco-ordinated way over the years has thrown up some<br />
very, very good members on that. I was particularly<br />
fortunate when I became Prime minister to have a Ministry<br />
there available with tremendous talent, but I think you<br />
can always do better and I think that's true of all<br />
parties. JOURNALIST: Is it a matter for the National Executive<br />
though or for the New South Wales Branch do you think?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not going to get into that discussion<br />
here. That's a matter for discussion within the Party<br />
and I'm running late.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you pleased with the success of<br />
yesterday's meeting between the environmental groups and<br />
O the industry?<br />
PM: Yes, it was good. The spirit was good, I mean, it<br />
would be silly to deny that there weren't, you know,<br />
different positions. I mean, obviously there are, but<br />
there was a willingness to attempt to work together to<br />
get some common-acceptance of what we mean by sustainable<br />
development and we will now, as they've agreed, prepare e<br />
discussion paper which will be circulated and that will<br />
be the beginning. I hope, then of a series of working<br />
groups in various sectors of Australian industry. I hope<br />
that in this way, as we go into 1990 and towards the end<br />
of it, we will be able to get a basis on which we can<br />
agreeably achieve the twin goals of development and also<br />
discharging our responsibility for the protection of the<br />
environment. As I've said, they are not to be seen as<br />
either/ ors. We've got to, as a community, if we are<br />
going to discharge our obligations, have both economic<br />
development and we must discharge our responsibility to<br />
the future generations. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Peacock has said that voters will<br />
all aspects of your Government as wanting.<br />
PM: Well, I would think if I were Mr Peacock at the<br />
moment, at the end of the year, when all the<br />
analyses are that he has failed utterly in his coup to<br />
provide the Liberal Party with appropriate leadership.<br />
If I were Andrew I'd say, mate, just spend the Christmas<br />
holidays examining yourself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Should the Liberals have stuck with John<br />
Howard? PM: who's to know?<br />
JOURNALIST: Happy Birthday, Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
