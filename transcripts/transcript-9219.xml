TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, SHIRE COUNCIL AND LOCAL COMMUNITY COUNCIL<br />
CHAMBERS, MILDURA, 6 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: I might just say a few introductory words and then you can ask me<br />
some questions after that. The point of my coming was to demonstrate<br />
the application of the White Paper for regional Australia. And in the<br />
White Paper we fund an importanf salinity program here in Sunraysia<br />
Mildura, and as a demonstration of that, regional areas that<br />
understand what they are doing and have programs of coherence will<br />
get support, and can get support, from the Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments. And in the White Paper there is the opportunity to<br />
exploit now infrastructure bonds, pool development funds, but more<br />
particularly, funding for regional economic organisations that need<br />
some core funding to let them put strategic plans together. Because a<br />
lesson out of all the studies, the KeltyTs Force, all of the other<br />
studies that we have had, is that regions which are well lead and<br />
coherent in their plans, do better than other regions that aren't.<br />
So what it is, is strategic funding and specific funding for particular<br />
projects from an infrastructure fund. And I am looking forward to today<br />
being involved with that salinity program this afternoon. This morning,<br />
of course, I had a very interesting tour-through the district, looking at<br />
some innovations in horticultural production in grapes, this is going to<br />
be one of the important grape growing areas of Australia for the<br />
Australia wine industry, export industry. And therefore, consolidation<br />
of farms, higher output and productivity, new techniques, mechanical<br />
harvesting, better use of water, all of these things, I think, are<br />
important lessons and I was very pleased to be able to see them<br />
today. Could I just say for the White Paper in general, that there is a great<br />
opportunity here, I think, for regions, but also for all areas of Australia<br />
where unemployment is high, to have people who are long term </p>
<p>unemployed case managed so that they are better trained and placed<br />
for work, so that their prospects of retaining work are enhanced. So,<br />
can I say I have been heartened by the reception it has had from<br />
business, which has been very supportive of it, the various industry<br />
groupings, the Chambers of Commerce, the Metal Trades Industry, the<br />
big companies like BHP. Because of these things, I think, have been a<br />
big confidence boost for it.<br />
J: Mr Keating on the White Paper, it obviously going to be a great test<br />
here because unemployment is 20 per cent here. You hope to get the<br />
national average down to 5 per cent by the year 2000, what will it do to<br />
Sunraysia?<br />
PM: Well, there will always be greater problems in regional areas because<br />
of diminished employment opportunities. But if we can get the output<br />
and productivity of areas like Sunraysia up, there will be more<br />
aggregate employment. But we have also got a policy in the White<br />
Paper called the new opportunities program, which will allow support<br />
of job subsidies under labour market programs to go to regional<br />
proposals that are conceived well and which have got some chance of<br />
using local, otherwise unemployed labour, other than in commercial<br />
things. I wouldn't suggest this is going to be the complete answer to<br />
unemployment in regional areas, far from it, it won't be, but it will help.<br />
J: What per centage?<br />
PM: I don't think I can say that either. But one thing I think you need to<br />
know and remember is, in the 1980s we had just about, in those eight,<br />
nine years between 1983 and 1990-91, we had nearly 2.5 million job<br />
growth. We lost about 300,000 of those in the recession, but we still<br />
kept the 2 million. To get to around 5 per cent unemployment by the<br />
end of the century we have got to create over a million job growth. I<br />
think we can do that.<br />
J: Mr Keating, in light of your own and Mr Howe's statement that the<br />
regional development strategy aims to on what potential of<br />
Australia's regions. Will you talk to the NSW Opposition and tell them<br />
to allow passage of the Irrigation Corporations Bill, debate on which<br />
has been adjourned at the moment, and seems that that may be<br />
threatening the $ 27 million refurbishing of the irrigation project?<br />
PM: I am not aware of the Bill, but now that you have mentioned it I will<br />
acquaint myself with it. I think there will be a lot of privatisation in<br />
some areas of the public infrastructure which is going to be<br />
commercial. We announced a very large one in the White Paper and<br />
that is, the Federal Airports Corporation large airports around<br />
Australia. So, I think, from the Government's point of view we have<br />
been the first Government in Australia to champion large scale<br />
privatisations with a sale of half the stock of the Commonwealth Bank,<br />
and more'latterly, the FAC, Qantas, which is coming up. So, again, it </p>
<p>all gets back to the viability of these projects. I don't know the project<br />
you speak of but I would be very pleased to find out.<br />
J: You will talk to him?<br />
PM: I will talk to him about it, sure.<br />
J: Mr Keating, if regional Australia does have such big potential, why was<br />
out of $ 6 billion only $ 150 million went to regional areas?<br />
PM: You have got to see this not in terms of the way you help regional<br />
areas is by just throwing a bucket of money at them. That has proven<br />
not to work. I think what works is regional communities who know what<br />
they are doing themselves. I mean, you can see this here in Mildura,<br />
in the Sunraysia. The people I met here today are very confident<br />
about regional plans, how they can lift the productivity of the area, how<br />
they can lock that into the world market, how they can draw capitals to<br />
the area. What they need is strategic funding, that is what the White<br />
Paper provides. It has also got mechanisms to draw private funding,<br />
private capital, into public infrastructure works, but might not otherwise<br />
be -available through the public account. So, I think that is the<br />
approach. Any approach which says we will fix the money with a big<br />
cheque from the Budget, really, has never worked, and it won't work<br />
now.<br />
J: Dr Hewson says that regional Australia's expectations have been<br />
raised, but they have just got piddling concessions.<br />
PM: Well Dr Hewson is somebody who is discovering, I mean, Dr Hewson<br />
would need an army map to find his way out of Sydney and Melbourne,<br />
particularly Eastern Sydney. He is obviously somebody who has been<br />
more comfortable in the comfort station of the leafy suburbs of Eastern<br />
Sydney than anywhere else. We are acting on the Report of the Kelty<br />
Taskforce which had the most extensive regional consultations of ainy<br />
taskforce ever. The huge surveys of McKinsey and Company, and the<br />
Industry Commission Report, all say what we need is strategic funding<br />
which supports the regional leadership and some instruments to<br />
finance things that otherwise regional bodies can't finance. Now, if Dr<br />
Hewson thinks that is piddling, that is a reflection on his failure to<br />
understand the aspirations of regional Australia and his failure to read<br />
the reports, which in themselves, I think, are very illuminating. He is<br />
also, can I say, he has been running on this the last day or so, this<br />
question about poverty traps. Let me just say a couple of things about<br />
that. I made this point clear in Parliament yesterday, that is, the<br />
changes to the Social Security system, the changed taper<br />
arrangements, and paying half the married rate of unemployment<br />
benefits to each member of a family, a couple, is going to dramatimlly<br />
change the Social Security system. It is the antithesis of a poverty<br />
trap. A poverty trap is a circumstance where somebody can't earn<br />
more income by virtue of the fact that the marginal effective tax rate, or </p>
<p>the withdrawal rate takes it from them. That is the current position<br />
before the White Paper.<br />
The introduction of the White Paper will mean that couples will be able<br />
to earn much more income by, instead of having a flat cut off of 100<br />
per cent, that is, for every dollar of income earned a dollar of the<br />
benefit is lost, we will go now to a 50, then a 70 per cent taper, and<br />
that withdrawal rate. And that will mean that people won't be in<br />
poverty traps as they are now. But this is the same Dr Hewson who<br />
said that people on unemployment benefits should be chipped off after<br />
nine months, this is Australian families. This is the same person who<br />
said, " if you reach down and pull the unemployed up beside us, you<br />
will pull the rest of us down". These are the people who described the<br />
unemployed in the Social Security Office as riff raff. These are people<br />
not to be listened to.<br />
