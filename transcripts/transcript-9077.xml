TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P<br />
J KEATING, M. P.,<br />
WORK FOR AUSTRALIA LUNCH, THE LODGE, CANBERRA<br />
SUNDAY 12 DECEMBER, 1993<br />
J: Prime M~ inister, another Labor State has fallen to the conservatives, does that<br />
pose problems for you nationally?<br />
PM: Well, I think it's a disappointing result for Lynn Arnold and I think he deserved<br />
better I think his government had tried hard to repair the state's economic<br />
position as we cooperated in fuinding $ 600 million of commonwealth funds into<br />
South Australia to ease the bank problem. But, I think what it means is now<br />
the Labor Party is going to have to rebuild down there and focus on the needs<br />
of South Australia, which I'm sure it will do. It's been in office for I1I years, it<br />
was a long innings, it deserved a better result than this but the people have<br />
made their decision and I think the party has got to take notice of it and build.<br />
J: What difference will it make to federal/ state relations, especially in the Loan<br />
Council, now?<br />
PM: I don't think any difference, basically. I think we've got a very public process<br />
now with the joint national fiscal outlook; everyone knows, basically, where the<br />
fiscal game stands and we treat states as we find them in terms of their<br />
problems.... each state and its problems when they arise. So, I think we'll have<br />
the same cooperative spirit in the Loan Council and the Premiers' Conference<br />
that we've had.<br />
J: Does it make it harder though, to pursue.. inaudible., like industrial relations<br />
and perhaps Mabo, things like that?<br />
PM: Well, Mabo is in a different category. I think that we've actually had some<br />
Coalition states in the past that we've done a lot of cooperative things with, in<br />
terms of micro-economic reform. So, I don't really think that's a problem. I<br />
think that we have a Federal system that works and works well, and I think it<br />
will work well no matter who the Governments are. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, are you satisfied now that the Malaysian matter is entirely<br />
behind us?<br />
PM: Oh, I think so. They've made that clear themselves.<br />
J: Are you confident that jobs will actually flow from the Green Paper this week<br />
people will have to wait around until Cabinet next -year to find out what<br />
the real options are?<br />
PM: Well, obviously, jobs can't flow from a paper the day it is presented but it will<br />
be focusing on the long term unemployed particularly those people who<br />
have carried the brunt of the decline in the labour market, who've been<br />
unemployed for one or two years and we need to try and get them back their<br />
self-esteem, back into employment and back into the mainstream labour<br />
market. We are helped, of course, by the fact that we've had now some real<br />
growth in the economy, as confirmed last week. We're growing now as fast as<br />
any OECD country, we've had about 100,000 job growth in three months<br />
which is very encouraging. And that really leavens up the labour market and<br />
makes the difference in terms of making some of these programs work. So,<br />
we're looking forward to the receipt of the -Employment Task Force. report, to<br />
consider that along with the report which Bill Kelty is presenting on regional<br />
development. And we'll consider the two in the run-up to the Budget which<br />
will now, of course, be an early Budget.<br />
J: Does jobs growth lessen the need for a jobs levy, do you think? I mean, we've<br />
got growth and jobs in the economy?<br />
PM: There's no point in me speculating about what things will emerge from the<br />
policy consideration of it but there is no substitute for growth in the economy.<br />
There's no substitute for growth in employment. And we are seeing growth in<br />
the economy and, of course, we're seeing employment with it. And it's that<br />
aggregate employment which comes from growth which is the key to making<br />
the place that much better. And it means that the programs which do focus on<br />
the long term unemployed are then working in a much more sympathetic<br />
economidc environment.<br />
J: If the Green Paper does recommend the jobs levy given that the ACTU and<br />
others are already pushing for it how much pressure is the government then<br />
under?<br />
PM: The Government's not under any pressure with it. It's a matter of just making<br />
its mind up about what it wants to do by way of new programs and how it<br />
wishes to fu~ nd them.<br />
J: What's your view of the jobs levy?<br />
PM: Well, I've said before, I've got an open mind about it. But, again, I'll see what's<br />
recommended and then consider what we might do and how that ought best be<br />
fujnded. </p>
<p>J: You've said three billion dollars is a bit much to spend on job programs. What<br />
sort of ballpark figure are you looking at?<br />
PM: Well, again, I can't give you that either, off the top of my head, but three billion<br />
is a very big increase in outlays and we need to consider this report carefully.<br />
J: Considering the growth that's going on in the economy now, do you think that<br />
lessens the impetus for having to have a jobs levy?<br />
PM: No, because one can talk about aggregate employment but that's an entirely<br />
different thing to those who are long term unemployed..., those who have been,<br />
already, out of the labour market, have lost self-esteem, lost their skills, lost<br />
their place... and even if the labour market is picking up, as it is, it doesn't<br />
necessarily mean those people will get a job.<br />
J: Are you looking forward to having Bronwyn Bishop as a sparring partner in<br />
the lower house, now?<br />
PM: Well, I think the Liberal Party has decided to let her through. So, from my<br />
point of view I won't be taking much notice of anything Dr Hewson says from<br />
here on in, because I think his days are numbered. If the party wanted to<br />
preserve John Hewson's leadership they would have stopped Bronwyn Bishop<br />
coming into the House of Representatives.<br />
J: So, you can see her as the next leader of the Opposition?<br />
PM: Well, they didn't stop her and it's pretty obvious that she has run for the<br />
leadership all year and she's now made the transition into the House of<br />
Representatives, and I think that's probably, we're seeing the very clear end of<br />
John Hewson's period of leader of the Liberal Party.<br />
J: Just to go back to Dr Mahathir, do you think there's a lesson to be learnt, in the<br />
way all this has occurred, in relations between Australia and Malaysia?<br />
PM: Well, we've had a good thirty year relationship. It's gone back to the time of<br />
the Indonesian confrontation period and other periods earlier than that, I think<br />
it's a pretty robust relationship and I think this proves that.<br />
J: If I could take you back to South Australia for a moment, given the weekend<br />
result, there's been talk of Neal Blewett retiring, would you like to fight a byelection<br />
down there early next year?<br />
PM: I think the Federal Government is presiding over, now, a growth economy. We<br />
said, in One Nation, we'd restart the economy, get it back into growth and get<br />
employment growing. That's what we're doing. I'm quite sure, had the<br />
Coalition won the election, you would have had Dr Hewson strutting around<br />
saying, " Look at all this growth and look at this employment, it's all because<br />
we've arrived." In fact, it's all because of the policies of the Labor Party with </p>
<p>the One Nation package and Investing in the Nation. That's what has restarted<br />
the economy; low interest rates, low inflation and a good economic policy.<br />
And, it is with that promise, not just a return to growth but stronger<br />
employment and setting ourselves up institutionally in the Asia-Pacific these<br />
are the things that are going to be meat and drink to the Australian people. So,<br />
why would the Government worry about testing those policies in the<br />
electorate.<br />
J: Do you think people can separate the state and federal issues?<br />
PM: I think this was exclusively decided on state issues as, in fact, most state<br />
elections are. I think this was determined on state issues and the federal<br />
government will run on its own strengths, on its own policies.<br />
Ends. </p>
