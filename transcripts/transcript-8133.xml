TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, IMPERIAL HOTEL, TOKYO<br />
18 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your final message to the<br />
delegates you are going to meet this morning?<br />
PM: That Melbourne is the best equipped city to stage<br />
the Centenary Games because of the excellence and<br />
preparedness of its facilities; its infrastructure; the<br />
dedication and the sports fanaticism of the people of<br />
Melbourne and of Australia; the security of Australia;<br />
the environment of Australia. All these things plus the<br />
fact that it will mean that if Melbourne gets the 1996<br />
Games that will be only the second time in the centenary<br />
of the modern games that they've been held in the<br />
southern hemisphere.<br />
JOURNALIST: Realistically though what are our chances<br />
tonight? PM: Well, if everyone means what they are saying to us<br />
during the last day or so, they seem pretty good.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you've been focusing some of<br />
your lobbying effort on the black Africans as I<br />
understand it. To what effect?<br />
PM: I think we'll get good support from them.<br />
JOURNALIST: But what about the Atlanta bid?<br />
PM: They are a serious bid. I mean we are in the<br />
situation where all the other competitors are serious<br />
competitors. Our campaign has not been knocking the<br />
others. We recognise their merits, their virtues, the<br />
arguments for them. We simply believe honestly that ours<br />
in the best.<br />
JOURNALIST: If we do lose tonight there'll be a lot of<br />
disappointed people in Melbourne surely.<br />
PM: Sure there will. Sure there will. They would know,<br />
if that is the case, and I hope and believe we will win,<br />
but they can be certain that if Melbourne is not<br />
successful that they ought to be terribly proud of the<br />
great group in the team that has been working I exclude </p>
<p>2<br />
myself from this because I have been doing my bit but<br />
the great organisation under the leadership of John Ralph<br />
has been doing a magnificent job. If I could put it this<br />
way, certainly no stone has been left unturned.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would a second or third put Melbourne in<br />
line for say the 2000 Games?<br />
PM: People have been saying you ought to get this one.<br />
If you don't well then you're in with a very good chance<br />
for the next one. But we're about 1996.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you encouraged by the firming odds?<br />
PM: I'd rather be getting firming than going out.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you aware of this alleged death threat<br />
in 1988?<br />
PM: London.<br />
ends </p>
