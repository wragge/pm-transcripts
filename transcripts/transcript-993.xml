COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH<br />
Rt. Hon. SI R ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERS'<br />
CONFERENCE.<br />
[ Fromt the Parliamentary Debates," 18.8.64.]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister)-by leave-After I<br />
returned from my overseas visit, and Parlia6-<br />
ment not being in session, I gave a long<br />
Press and television interview. It is not<br />
my purpose to repeat all that I then said<br />
Da-bthlee verbatim tape record will be avail-<br />
to honorable members-but I do propose<br />
to say something about some of the<br />
highlights of my work.<br />
For the record, I will say at once that<br />
I propose a little later to lay on the table<br />
-) of the House the text of the final communique<br />
of the Prime Ministers' Conference.<br />
I had intended -to pay a visit to Israel.<br />
Indeed arrangements for this visit were well<br />
advanced when, by reason of illness, I<br />
found, with very great regret, that I had to<br />
cancel my journey to that country. I hope<br />
to make it on a future opportunity. In the<br />
result, I had made sufficient recovery to<br />
go to the Prime Ministers' Conference in<br />
London via Washington. It was necessary<br />
for me to leave London the day after the<br />
Prime Ministers' Conference, in order to<br />
be back in time for important Cabinet<br />
discussions on the Budget.<br />
Two matters emerged from my talks in<br />
Washington. The first was that I was keen<br />
to discover from the Administration<br />
10543/ 64. whether the statement I had made in this<br />
House on the A. N. Z. U. S. Treaty was one<br />
with which they agreed. I should, I think,<br />
quote the substance of what I said in the<br />
House because there had been some controversy<br />
about-the position inside Australia<br />
and there had been, indeed, some misrepresentation<br />
of what the then Minister for<br />
External Affairs had said on this matter.<br />
In this House on 21st April, I said-<br />
The treaty is between the United States,<br />
Australia and New Zealand. Article IV reiads-<br />
" Each Party recognizes that an armed<br />
attack in the Pacific Area on any of the<br />
Parties would be dangerous to its own peace<br />
and safety and declares that it would act to<br />
meet the common danger in accordance with<br />
its constitutional processes."<br />
Of course, this should be in accordance with<br />
constitutional processes. Very few countries go<br />
automatically into a state of war. They all have<br />
certain procedures to go through but, subject<br />
to constitutional processes, which can operate<br />
here just as much as they can anywhere else,<br />
there is a clear statement that the parties will<br />
act to meet the common danger in accordance<br />
with their constitutional processes.<br />
The article goes on-<br />
" Any such armed attack and all measures<br />
taken as a result thereof shall be immediately<br />
reported to the Security Council of the United<br />
Nations. Such measures sh-all be terminated<br />
when the Security Council has taken the<br />
measures necessary to restore and maintain<br />
international peace and security." </p>
<p>Article V reads-<br />
" For the purpose of Article IV, an armed<br />
attack on any of the Parties is deemed to<br />
include an armed attack on the metropolitan<br />
territory of any of the Parties, or on the island<br />
territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific<br />
or on its armed forces, public vessels or aircraft<br />
in the Pacific."<br />
Those words do not produce automatic hostilities,<br />
because reference is made to constitutional processes,<br />
but they contain in the clearest terms a<br />
high-level acceptance of responsibility. It is not<br />
for us to assume thut any great ally of ours will<br />
avoid that any more than we will avoid it.<br />
There is a contract between Australia and<br />
America. It is a contr-ct based on the utmost goodwill,<br />
the utmost good faith and unqualified friendship.<br />
Each of us will stand by it.<br />
I was happy to find in Washington that<br />
my statement was accepted as a completely<br />
accurate interpretation and that the State<br />
Department had, in fact, ciirculated it as a<br />
definite statement On the point. This, I<br />
think, revealed a state of affairs eminently<br />
satisfactory to Australia. It has, as I pointed<br />
out last week when we were debating these<br />
matters, been powerfully reinforced by the<br />
recent statement of President Johnson, and<br />
the terms of the resolution of both Houses<br />
of the Congress. In the second place-and<br />
I think I should report this having regard<br />
to some comments that have been made-<br />
President Johnson very promptly, at the<br />
beginning of our discussions, stated his<br />
pleasure and the pleasure of the American<br />
people at our contribution, to the defence of<br />
South Vietnam. He expressed pleasure both<br />
with the content of our response and the<br />
prompt way in which we had made it.<br />
It is sometimes thought that Australia's<br />
efforts in these fields, being relatively small,<br />
are either of no significance or must provoke<br />
some American criticism. This is not<br />
so. The United States is the greatest power<br />
in the world. It has given enormous aid to<br />
other countries. It must occasionally fel<br />
somewhat isolated. It would be more than<br />
human if it did not occasionally feel that<br />
it was being cast for the role of the world's<br />
gendarme with the major responsibility for<br />
keeping the peace. It is because of these<br />
things that in Washington contributions by<br />
other countries are welcomed as an identification<br />
by other countries of their world<br />
interests with those of the United States.<br />
I have repeatedly said that while we<br />
rely and will continue to rely very much on<br />
the collaboration of the great powers in our own defence, that collaboration involves<br />
mutual obligations which we will<br />
at all times be prepared to honour. This<br />
is well understood. I have not been able<br />
to detect any mental reservations about<br />
the friendship of the United States for Australia<br />
or-and this is of broad importance<br />
-the determination of the United States<br />
to do all in its power to preserve the<br />
peace in South East Asia and to prevent<br />
the spread of aggressive Communism.<br />
This attitude of mind has, in fact, been<br />
illustrated vividly ' by recent events.<br />
When I went on to the conference in<br />
London, I was quite convinced that something<br />
should be said to strengthen the<br />
position of Malaysia and to make it clear<br />
that, as a Commonwealth country, it enjoyed<br />
the support, physically or morally or<br />
both, of all the Commonwealth nations.<br />
Honorable members will be familiar with<br />
what I will call " the new vocabulary<br />
There is a strong opposition to<br />
" 1colonialism and to imperialism<br />
and to what is now called neocolonialism."<br />
As I understand it, " neocolonialism<br />
" is an expression which relates<br />
to a new or derivative form of<br />
" 1colonialism It is, as honorable members<br />
know, an expression frequently used by<br />
the rulers of Indonesia to support their<br />
allegation that the creation first of Malaya<br />
and then of Malaysia did not represent<br />
the termination of colonial rule but<br />
represented an attempt by the former<br />
,, colonial power to use the new independent<br />
body and thus to deprive it otf<br />
some of the attributes of complete political<br />
independence. I<br />
Considerable play has been made of the<br />
fact that the military and paramilitary and<br />
economic aid given to Malaysia ' by the<br />
United Kingdom, Australia and New<br />
Zealand represents some desire on the part<br />
of predominantly European nations to<br />
maintain a position of influence and thus<br />
to treat Malaysia as not fully free. This<br />
notion seemed to me-and I believe that<br />
I will have the support of honorable members<br />
in this view-to have a somewhat<br />
dangerous quality. I therefore had a very<br />
great desire to secure in the conference<br />
some general support for Malaysia, a<br />
support which should include that of the<br />
West Indian, African and Asian members<br />
of the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>A great deal of discussion occurred on<br />
these matters with, at one stage, some<br />
divergence of opinion but in the long run,<br />
I am happy to say, a satisfactory result.<br />
There was ' no disagreement about the<br />
statement in the communique that " they<br />
will maintain their efforts to reduce the<br />
areas of international disagreement with all<br />
the means within their power, while maintaining<br />
both the strength and the resolution<br />
to resist aggression from without or<br />
subversion from within But there was a<br />
difference of opinion as to whether, having<br />
said this, we should give some assurance<br />
tthe Prime Minister of Malaysia of our<br />
sympathy and support in his efforts to preserve<br />
the independence and integrity of his<br />
country. Some thought that an expression<br />
of sympathy was enough. My own view was<br />
that it was inadequate; that one might well<br />
sympathise with people without agreeing<br />
with them or in any way backing them<br />
up. I pointed out, and so did others, that<br />
the word " support" did not necessarily<br />
connote military support or even material<br />
support, since the nature of the support<br />
to be given would be for each member of<br />
the Commonwealth to determine.<br />
I did my best to point out that every new<br />
African nation represented at the Conference<br />
was jealous of its own independence and<br />
would strongly resent any interference in<br />
it by outside people. This, indeed, had been<br />
demonstrated in the case of Kenya and<br />
Tanganyika, each of which had, after independence,<br />
been happy to receive British<br />
military aid against aggressive movements.<br />
I said as strongly as I could that what was<br />
true in the case of African countries was<br />
equally true in the case of Asian countries<br />
Dand that Malaysia was entitled at the very<br />
least to our strong moral support at the<br />
United Nations and around the various diplomatic<br />
posts in the world. I expressed the<br />
view that a Commonwealth which was not<br />
prepared to take a public stand in favour<br />
of the political independence and territorial<br />
integrity of all its members would be a<br />
strange kind of Commonwealth. From our<br />
point of view in Australia this is, of course,<br />
extremely important. We are not supporting<br />
Malaysia, as we do in the most practical<br />
terms, because we have some colonialist<br />
point of view. We have not. But we do<br />
believe that we have obligations to sister<br />
members of the Commonwealth while, of<br />
course-and this may be stated quite frankly -we have some particular interest in the<br />
preservation of Malaysia having regard to<br />
the threat from Communist aggression<br />
which -presses down upon us or in our direction<br />
from the north. I am happy'to say -that<br />
agreement was finally secured upon an expression,<br />
not only of sympathy, but of support.<br />
This was to me one of the crucial<br />
matters in this Conference. The fact that it<br />
was resolved in the manner contained in<br />
the communique, a unanimous document,<br />
is one of the facts which has enabled me<br />
to say, as I have said publicly, that the<br />
Conference achieved valuable results.<br />
It will, I hope, ' be remembered-and I<br />
repeatedly invited the Conference to remember<br />
it-that when Malaysia was created it<br />
secured the unanimous approval of an<br />
earlier Prime Ministers' Conference, it<br />
secured admission to membership of the<br />
United Nations by a unanimous vote and<br />
that, later on, when it was alleged by<br />
Indonesia that the people of the Borneo<br />
territories had been ignored, a special mission<br />
set up by the Secretary-General of the<br />
United Nations had found that there was<br />
approval in those territories of wvhat had<br />
been done.<br />
It follows from all this, as I said to the<br />
Conference, that the validity of the existence<br />
of Malaysia cannot sensibly be challenged.<br />
The challenge to it-in other words the so<br />
called confrontation policy of Indonesiafinds<br />
its expression in actual military aggression<br />
across the frontiers of Malaysia. This<br />
beipg a clear case of military aggression, the<br />
argument that there were unsettled disputes<br />
has a somewhat hollow sound. The plain<br />
fact is that Malaysia is defending itself<br />
against aggression and therefore comes<br />
plainly within the Commonwealth statement<br />
that there should be a resolution to resist<br />
aggression from without or subversion from<br />
within. It became clear, as the Conference proceeded,<br />
that the problems of the new Commonwealth<br />
must be approached patiently<br />
and without illusions. An example of this<br />
fact is to he found in one reference in the<br />
communique. It is as follows-<br />
They discussed the great significance of China<br />
for South and South East Asia. They also discussed<br />
the question of relations with China and<br />
of her membership of the United Nations.<br />
This, it will be seen, conveys very little.<br />
The reason for this is that there were deep </p>
<p>divisions of opinion and of emphasis, and<br />
that these rendered a more positive statement<br />
impossible. I must recognise that from<br />
the point of view of most of the African<br />
countries, Asia, particularly South East<br />
Asia, seems a long way off. They do not<br />
feel that Communist China presents any<br />
threat to them. When I presented views<br />
which are based upon the aggressive policies<br />
and activities of China in and around Laos<br />
and Vietnam, I was told that this was<br />
cold war talk, and that the cold war was,<br />
for purposes of a Prime Ministers' Conference,<br />
an irrelevancy. In some quarters there<br />
even seemed to be an assumption that the<br />
cold war had been created by the West, and<br />
a failure to understand that but for the<br />
tenacity and success of the great Western<br />
powers in resisting the cold war and deterring<br />
a hot one, the Prime Ministers might<br />
have been meeting, if at all, in very different<br />
circumstances. I mention this not by way of criticism but<br />
by way of explaining some of the atmosphere<br />
of a new Commonwealth meeting.<br />
New nations, with different histories and<br />
backgrounds and emotions, cannot be<br />
expected to fall into our inherited patterns<br />
of thought, or to see world conflict in the<br />
same light as those of us who have treaty<br />
associations and obligations and indeed<br />
special regional problems of security and<br />
survival. But I am not at all despondent.<br />
The greatest value of these conferences is<br />
that we are all conscious of our special,<br />
though undefined, relationship to each other,<br />
that we exchange our experience and views<br />
with great vigour, but with personal goodwill,<br />
and that we learn something from each<br />
other. The Conference having noted-I am sure<br />
with great satisfaction-that since the war<br />
more than 20 countries, with a total population<br />
of some 700 millions, had been brought<br />
to sell-government by Great Britain,<br />
and that others will shortly be added to<br />
the list, became involved in a discussion<br />
about Southern Rhodesia. Now, we all<br />
agreed at the outset, and reaffirmed<br />
-unanimously in the communique, that the<br />
authority and responsibility for leading the<br />
remaining colonies to independence must<br />
continue to rest with Britain In spite of<br />
this, and of the further fact that under the<br />
agreed Soufhern Rhodesian Constitution of<br />
1961, there will be an African majority of electors within a period variously estimated<br />
at from five to ten years-I think I heard<br />
somebody say it might be twelve-some of<br />
the African leaders said they wanted a<br />
discussion. It was pointed out to them that<br />
as any further negotiations must be conducted<br />
by Britain and as there were strong<br />
political views and differences in Southern<br />
Rhodesia itself, advice or instruction to<br />
Britain might well complicate a task already<br />
sufficiently delicate and difficult.<br />
In the result, it was agreed that the<br />
Southern Rhodesian problem should not be<br />
discussed in full conference, but in a closed<br />
session with restricted membership.<br />
At the end of the Conference, it was<br />
agreed that the matter could be referred<br />
to in the communique, in the terms which<br />
I now quote-<br />
At the same time, Prime Ministers of other<br />
Commonwealth countries expressed their views<br />
to the Prime Minister of Britain on the question<br />
of the progress of Southern Rhodesia towards<br />
independence within the Commonwealth. They<br />
welcomed the decision already announced by the<br />
British Government that, as in the case of other<br />
territories, the existence of sufficiently representative<br />
institutions9 would be a condition of the grant<br />
of independence to Southern Rhodesia.<br />
We all agreed about that. It continues-<br />
They also noted with approval the statement<br />
already made by the British Government that they<br />
would not recognise any unilaterial declaration of<br />
fndependence--We all agreed about thatanid<br />
the other Prime Ministers made it clear that<br />
they would be unable to recognise any such<br />
declaration. The view was also expressed that an Independence<br />
Conference should be convened which the leaders<br />
of alt parties in Southern Rhodesia should be free<br />
to attend. The object would be to seek agreement<br />
on the steps by which Southern Rhodesia might proceed<br />
to independence within the Commonwealth<br />
at the earliest practicable time on the basis of<br />
majority rule. With a view to diminishing tensions<br />
and preparing the way for such a conference, an<br />
appeal was made for the release of all the detained<br />
African leaders. The Prime Ministers called upon all<br />
leaders and their supporters to exercise moderation<br />
and to abstain from violence; and they affirmed<br />
their belief that the best interest of all sections of<br />
the population lay in developing confidence and<br />
co-operation, on the basis of tolerance, mutual<br />
understanding and justice. In this connection, they<br />
recognised the necessity for giving confidence to<br />
the minority community in Southern Rhodesia<br />
that their interests would be protected.<br />
The Prime Minister of Britain said that he would<br />
give careful consideration to all the views expressed<br />
by other Commonwealth Prime Ministers. At the<br />
same time he emphasised that the Government of </p>
<p>Southern Rhodesia was constitutionally responsible<br />
for the internal affairs of that territory and that the<br />
question of the granting of independence was a<br />
matter for decision by the British Parliament.<br />
Frankness requires that I should tell -the<br />
House that 1, for one, did not associate<br />
myself with this public tendering of adviceadvice<br />
which might be interpreted in some<br />
quarters as instructions-to the Government<br />
of the United Kingdom, which alone, as was<br />
expressly conceded, had the power and the<br />
responsibility. I want to put my position on<br />
record to my brother members of this House.<br />
So that there may be no misunderstanding,<br />
I should make it clear that-<br />
The Australian Government had<br />
already offered friendly advice to<br />
the Government of Southern Rhodesia,<br />
stating our belief that the<br />
end result to be arrived at, if<br />
D aSdomutihtteerdn tRo hotdhees iaC owmimshoendw etoa lthb, e<br />
was a voting roll which would<br />
provide an African majority.<br />
We took the view that if this result<br />
was not achieved in due course, it<br />
would probably be impossible for<br />
the United Kingdom to grant<br />
independence and therefore<br />
Southern Rhodesia could not be<br />
admitted to membership of the<br />
Commonwealth, the Commonwealth<br />
being an association of<br />
independent nations.<br />
D A unilateral declaration of independence<br />
before the necessary conditions<br />
existed had no chance of<br />
Commonwealth recognition, and<br />
would tend unhappily to isolate<br />
Southern Rhodesia from Common-<br />
3wealth affairs.<br />
Those are all views that we ourselves had<br />
put, through me, to Southern Rhodesia.<br />
On the other hand, I indicated to the<br />
Conference that I thought it would be a<br />
dangerous precedent, and an invasion of<br />
domestic jurisdiction, for the Commonwealth<br />
Prime Ministers to get into a<br />
position of sitting, as a body, to examine<br />
the affairs of other members, and pronouncing<br />
public judgments. I said that it was not<br />
difficult to foresee circumstances in which<br />
any one of us might find this intolerable.<br />
This difference of view explains some of<br />
the language of the communique. I was,<br />
of course, as I hardly need to say, not opposed to the idea of a constitutional<br />
conference about Southern Rhodesiaindeed,<br />
that is inevitable-or the<br />
adequate representation of the African<br />
citizens; this is completely proper. But I<br />
felt strongly that -the Government of the<br />
United Kingdom should not -be handicapped<br />
in its negotiations by public state,-<br />
ments which could increase its difficulties<br />
by stiffening resistance. After all, the problem<br />
is not easy, and needs to be solved<br />
in an atmosphere of mutual understanding.<br />
It is proper to remember that there are<br />
many thousands of settlers in Southern<br />
Rhodesia, frequently of long standing and<br />
with no other homes, strongly British in<br />
their allegiance and with legitimate rights<br />
to be protected, who will be unhappy at<br />
becoming a minority in what is now a<br />
fashionable African conccpt-a one party<br />
republican state.<br />
But, Sir, I am sure that most of them,<br />
watching the tides of events in other former<br />
African colonies, realise that there must be<br />
an accommodation, and that -in due course<br />
-and not too long a course-an accelerated<br />
movement towards adult suffrage<br />
must be completed, or the alternative<br />
accepted, of mounting internal disorder, of<br />
hostility among neighbours, and of a result<br />
finally achieved in an atmosphere of hostility,<br />
not friendship, with racial hostilities<br />
unfavorable to the continuance of<br />
European settlement and out of harmony<br />
with those inter-racial relationships for<br />
wich the new Commonwealth has come<br />
to stand.<br />
In the course of the general survey of<br />
world affairs with which we normally begin<br />
in Prime Ministers' Conferences I thought<br />
it proper to make some reference to the<br />
still ' current dispute between India and<br />
Pakistan over Kashmir. This is a dispute<br />
which has considerably embittered relations<br />
between these two great countries and has<br />
led to circumstances which do not aid<br />
the presentation of a common front to<br />
common dangers. Naturally, I had nothing<br />
to say about the merits of the dispute,<br />
about which there are deep differences of<br />
. opinion. All I was concerned to say was that,<br />
if the dispute could be solved by some<br />
mutual accommodation, it should be of great<br />
advantage to all of us. In view of what<br />
has been subsequently said, I should make<br />
it quite clear that the Conference did not </p>
<p>debate the merits or nature of these<br />
differences of opinion. But it did happen<br />
that the distinguished President of Pakistan,<br />
Field Marshal Ayu-b Khan, and the Minister<br />
for Finance in India, Mr. Krishnamachari<br />
who, in the absence of Mr. Shastri, most<br />
ably represented India, both made speeches<br />
of a helpful kind. We all hoped that if the<br />
atmosphere so created continued we might<br />
see a settlement. But quite clearly the<br />
problem is one for the two countries concerned.<br />
I repeat that, as a meeting of Prime<br />
Ministers, we were not sitting in judgment.<br />
We thus by implication re-affirmed our<br />
belief, to which I have referred elsewhere,<br />
that we are not an arbitral body, that we<br />
do not sit in judgment and that we<br />
recognise that there are very important<br />
domestic or intra-Commonwealth problems<br />
in relation to which we should not seek to<br />
impose our views.<br />
We had some discussion, perhaps not<br />
enough, looking back on it, on the importance<br />
of and the problems associated with<br />
economic development in the Commonwealth.<br />
I say not enough, because I felt that<br />
rather too much of our time was devoted<br />
to the problem of Southern Rhodesia. In<br />
the result, the economic problem might<br />
have been dealt with in too general a way<br />
and without useful definition if it had not<br />
been for the fact that the Government of<br />
the United Kingdom put forward a series<br />
of positive proposals. These were put forward<br />
as practical ways in which the<br />
Commonwealth could be given added<br />
vitality, meaning and purpose, as a sort of<br />
co-operative association so as to be able to<br />
help both its own members and the world at<br />
large, and thereby contribute to world peace<br />
by the raising of living standards and the<br />
achievement of economic progress. As the<br />
Communique records, various proposals<br />
were advanced. They were in a broad way<br />
accepted in principle. The final decision was<br />
that they were to be put into study by<br />
officials in the first instance to determine<br />
how best they could be carried into effect.<br />
Some of the proposals were as follows-<br />
That technical assistance on a co-operative<br />
project basis within the Commonwvealth<br />
should be provided to aid the development<br />
and use of resources.<br />
I pause here to say that, as I said in<br />
the Conference itself, it is a mistake to<br />
think of the Commonwealth as an association of rich countries. Some indeed are<br />
very poor. Some, like our own country, are<br />
far from poor but are still heavily involved<br />
in the importation of capital and technical<br />
skill for our own industrial development.<br />
Great Britain alone can be described as a<br />
capital exporting country; but, as the Prime<br />
Minister of Great Britain pointed out more<br />
than once, sometimes with a wry smile,<br />
there is a limit to what a nation with its<br />
own balance of payments problems can do.<br />
We were, therefore, not so much talking in<br />
terms of massive capital assistance as we<br />
were in terms of technical assistance, in<br />
which field so much may be done by one<br />
for another. I return to the proposals-<br />
The . encouragement of closer contacts<br />
between professional and other bodies<br />
within the Commonwealth to strengthen<br />
the links between us.<br />
This is, I think, an attractive proposition.<br />
It is quite true that nobody can attend amodern<br />
Prime Ministers' Conference without<br />
realising, sometimes with a shock, that<br />
we * have very different ideas about the<br />
institutions of government, and indeed, very<br />
different ideas about democracy itself.<br />
Quite a few of the newer Commonwealth<br />
nations have one-party systems in which<br />
the principle of one man, one vote becomes<br />
quite ironical. Some have different ideas<br />
on the rule of law from those which we<br />
entertain. Some have different ideas about<br />
the treatment of minorities from thos(<br />
which we entertain. It would indeed be<br />
quite impossible today to make a speech<br />
about the Commonwealth in which the<br />
point was made, as it used to be made<br />
years ago, that we all had great constitutional<br />
ideas in common; that we all believeJ<br />
in Parliamentary democracy, in the<br />
sovereignty of Parliament, and in the rule<br />
of law. The sober fact today is that some<br />
of us do and some of us do not. But this<br />
is not a matter about which we are to<br />
lecture each other. Indeed, I have constantly<br />
opposed any idea that we are to<br />
interfere in each other's domestic affairs.<br />
Such interference violates the most classical<br />
precepts of foreign policy; it is quite contrary<br />
to the Charter of the United Nations;<br />
and it is in my opinion a matter which<br />
could seriously damage intra-Commonwealth<br />
relations. For these reasons, I was<br />
very glad to find some attention directed<br />
towards the establishment of closer contacts </p>
<p>on matters in which we do have some<br />
common interest and some common desire<br />
for advancement. Examples of these are<br />
obviously to be found in the establishment<br />
of closer contacts between professional and<br />
other bodies in relation to which there is this<br />
community of interest.<br />
Incidentally, Sir, I noticed recently that<br />
the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Calwell)<br />
seemed to be * under the impression that I<br />
lectured the Prime Ministers on the<br />
advantages of private enterprise. I can<br />
relieve his mind; no such incident occurred.<br />
SNobody has been more careful than I have<br />
) been to make it clear that each member of<br />
the Commonwealth is entitled to adopt<br />
whatever system of government it likes,<br />
and whatever economic principles or<br />
policies seem best to it. I have attended the<br />
last nine Prime Ministers' Conferences. In<br />
that time, there has never been a discussion<br />
on private enterprise or socialism. The<br />
proposals continue-<br />
The proposal that we should aim at the<br />
pr~ ovision of financial assistance to the<br />
developing of higher education in<br />
Commonwealth countries.<br />
Here again there is no doubt a limit to<br />
financial aid. We know from our own<br />
experience in Australia that higher education<br />
is not cheap. Indeed the cost of university<br />
education in Australia is mounting at a<br />
mst formidable rate, while we have<br />
.&gt; recently received a report in relation to<br />
-Papua and New Guinea which recommends<br />
further developments of this kind in those<br />
territories. Yet there still remains a field of aid<br />
Yvhich we all thought should be explored.<br />
-It may well be that Australia can aid some<br />
other Commonwealth country or countries<br />
by providing expert advice in the universities<br />
field; by the provision of visiting professors,<br />
lecturers or administrators. For similar purposes,<br />
we must continue to receive in our<br />
own universities students from other countries<br />
and particularly from Commonwealth<br />
countries with whom we have such a special<br />
association and such close engagements.<br />
The next proposal was-<br />
The encouragement of specialised training<br />
and research in public administration<br />
with special emphasis on the needs of<br />
developing Commonwealth countries.<br />
This, I venture to say, is of prime importance.<br />
That wise man, the Prime Minister of Nigeria, who presides over the destinies<br />
of the largest of the African nations, has<br />
more than once said to me that the great<br />
shortage in all these countries is a shortage<br />
of competent administrators. Here, I think,<br />
we can help each other a good deal. The<br />
Government of the United Kingdom had in<br />
mind the establishment of some special<br />
teaching or training body in London or in<br />
connection with some university. I by no<br />
means reject this idea, but I do feel that<br />
in the long run the best training in administration<br />
that can be given to people from<br />
other Commonwealth countries is that they<br />
should be, so to speak, fitted into the public<br />
service of a more experienced nation so that<br />
they may learn something of the rules and<br />
practice of administration and something<br />
of the mental and moral attitudes which<br />
distinguish an advanced Civil Service in a<br />
politically advanced country. The last proposal<br />
I wish to mention was-<br />
The convening of a Commonwvealth<br />
Medical Conference in 1965.<br />
This idea fits into what I was saying<br />
earlier about professional bodies. Such a<br />
conference would do good, because the<br />
problems not only of personal medicine but<br />
of public health are of immense importance,<br />
more particularly in new nations where<br />
medical services may be scanty and the<br />
problems of public health extremely<br />
complex. These various proposals, and there were<br />
others, the nature of which is broadly stated<br />
in the communique, must be converted from<br />
vague expressions of principle into practical<br />
schemes. Our officials will willingly contribute<br />
to this result. If, in some or all of<br />
these matters, an effective result is achieved.<br />
we will, I think, have done a great deal to<br />
put substance into a Commonwealth<br />
relationship the nature of which has so<br />
changed in recent years, and to counter the<br />
scepticism which is frequently expressed as<br />
to the capacity of the new Commonwealth<br />
to endure.<br />
The proposal for a Commonwealth Secretariat<br />
is of course not a new one. It had,<br />
over a period of years, been put forward<br />
in general terms by Mr. Curtin and myself<br />
and others. On this occasion, the idea was<br />
first mentioned in the meeting by some of<br />
the African Prime Ministers. The suggestion<br />
was that there should be established in </p>
<p>London a central clearing house In the<br />
first instance, it was suggested that it should<br />
prepare documents on trade aid and<br />
development and should circulate information<br />
on these matters to all the members<br />
of the Commonwealth. Then, by way of,<br />
further or alternative suggestion, it was<br />
proposed that the Secretariat might assist in<br />
the preparations for the meetings of Primel'<br />
Ministers in the sense of receiving and'<br />
circulating papers, which would make us.<br />
all much better informed of other problems<br />
when we arrived. I myself drew'<br />
attention to the Commonwealth Parliamen--;<br />
tary Association and the small and useful'<br />
secretariat which it has. I felt that a<br />
Secretariat for the Commonwealth on the<br />
Parliamentary Association model might encourage<br />
members to put forward papers and<br />
proposals for circulation, information and<br />
consideration in advance of Prime<br />
Ministers' meetings.<br />
After general debate amongst the Prime<br />
Ministers, it was decided to ask an official<br />
committee to go into the proposal further<br />
and to report back to the Prime Ministers<br />
on what functions a Commonwealth<br />
Secretariat should perform. The view I<br />
stated was and is that the task of the<br />
Secretariat should be to pool and coordinate<br />
and disseminate information of a<br />
factual kind. There should be no question<br />
of a policy o~ r executive role. As the<br />
examination proceeds, there may well be<br />
considerable differences of opinion as to<br />
what a Secretariat should do. Some may wish to have something resembling the<br />
office and -functions of the Secretary-General<br />
of the United Nations, with considerable<br />
executive significance. We must, I put to<br />
the House, be astute to avoid constituting<br />
the Commonwealth as a sort of committee<br />
of the United Nations, with resolutions and<br />
votes. If we are to achieve and maintain a<br />
special significance, it will be by preserving<br />
the informality of our association, and<br />
the basic independence which each Commonwealth<br />
country brings to the conference<br />
table. It was at all times important that<br />
this Conference should produce constructive<br />
results and thus contribute to the<br />
future of the Commonwealth. I think that<br />
I should, therefore, pay tribute -to the<br />
invaluable work of the Chairman. Sir Alec<br />
Douglas-Home exhibited at all stages great<br />
tact and fairness and admirable flexibility<br />
of mind, a broad wisdom and a complete<br />
knowledge of the subjects under discussion.<br />
Without these elements, I would have<br />
doubted more than once whether the Conference<br />
would have a satisfactory conclusion.<br />
It is proper, therefore, that I should<br />
say that what were sometimes acute<br />
differences of viewpoint were in a large<br />
measure reconciled and that in the result<br />
there was a general feeling that the new<br />
Commonwealth had great usefulness and<br />
could make a powerful contribution to<br />
human destiny.<br />
I present the following paper-<br />
Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers,<br />
1964-Final Communique dated 15th July<br />
1964.<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR. COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA. </p>
