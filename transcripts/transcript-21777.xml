    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, a reaction to the incident, a scare at the Embassy this afternoon?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a very serious criminal act. I want to say on behalf of the Australian Government how sorry we are that it's occurred, it's recklessly dangerous. It would be the first time, if the preliminary results are confirmed, that such a biological agent has been sent in Australia.  It will do great damage in the eyes of many Indonesian people to the relationship between our countries, it certainly won't help Schapelle Corby, I want to make that very clear and I plead with people if that is the motivation to think again if they really care.  The Foreign Minister has spoken to the Indonesian Foreign Minister in Tokyo to convey the concern of the Government and the Foreign Minister happened to be with President Yudhoyono so he was able to convey immediately our concern, he's appreciative of the expressions of concern and understands how aghast we are at this development.  But this is a very serious development for our country and I can't overstate the sense of concern I feel that such a recklessly criminal act should have been committed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is this an act of terrorism?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let's wait for the confirmation, but when you send a substance of this type, if the analysis proves correct, it's an act with reckless indifference to human life and I apologise on behalf of the Australian people to the Indonesian Embassy and to the Indonesian Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have any additional information beyond what the Foreign Minister...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't, the preliminary test suggested it was a biological agent and further tests are now being carried out and when further information is available then I will, or the Foreign Minister, will have something more to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And you do believe that this is a result of the Corby conviction in Indonesia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it would be a remarkable coincidence if it were not.  I mean I can't prove that.  But if it is, can I say to those responsible you will not achieve your objective, quite apart from the murderous criminality of doing something like this and the indifference and contempt for human life that it displays it won't achieve the objective, it will have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, this definition - biological agent - I mean could this turn out to be a rather benign substance or does that definition...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, the advice I have is that the definition does mean the, the reference biological agent, does not mean it's benign.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned about an ugly side of Australian character coming out in the reaction to the Corby case?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand the depth of feeling in the community and providing that is expressed in the traditional Australian way, there's nothing wrong with that.  Every country has its uglies, every country has people who behave in a very unfortunate, anti-social way.  We have fewer than most, but this is a deeply distressing incident, it is quite appalling and I condemn it unreservedly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How have the Indonesians reacted to this news?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Foreign Minister was very understanding of our Foreign Minister's call and he appreciates very much the attempts that we are making to find out what sort of substance it is and also to express our concern and convey our reassurance.  I mean, to have a biological agent sent, powder form, anonymously, to your Ambassador is pretty disastrous.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, back-to-back governments have worked, of both political persuasions, have worked very hard over a long period of time to try to get relations with Jakarta on an even keel, we now call ourselves friends, does an incident like this hold a genuine threat of putting relations back, damaging relations with Jakarta?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course it's damaging, I don't think it's going to put the relationship back to where it was a few years ago, but of course it's damaging and that's why I'm so alarmed about it, and so concerned about it.  But it's not helpful, if it's related in any way to the Corby case can I say to the perpetrators you have not achieved your objective, in fact you have made it harder for the poor girl.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
