<p>The Gillard Government today announced a further suite of measures to ensure Australia has a dynamic manufacturing industry which continues to provide skilled and well-paid jobs.</p>
<p>A high-level Manufacturing Leaders Group will be led by Boeing Australia president, Ian Thomas, to help manufacturers seize the opportunities of the Asian Century.</p>
<p>The Government is appointing William Angove as the first Automotive Supplier Advocate to boost sales of Australian-made cars to government and business fleets and to work with the automotive industry to win new markets.</p>
<p>The Government has also agreed that the first funding round of the $236 million Industrial Transformation Research Program (ITRP) will focus on food research.</p>
<p>Food processing is a key area of opportunity as the rise of a large Asian middle class will lift demand for high-quality food products.</p>
<p>The ITRP is designed to develop partnerships between firms and researchers to boost the competitive edge of Australian industry.</p>
<p>Manufacturing employs nearly one million Australians and is an essential part of a broad-based Australian economy.</p>
<p>The sector is facing increased pressure due to the high Australian dollar and competition from low-cost economies in our region, which is why the Government established the Prime Minister's Manufacturing Taskforce.</p>
<p>Today's announcements follow other recent steps including:</p>
<p> * 	Establishing a new Anti-Dumping Commission with increased powers and resources to provide a fair go for Australian manufacturers and farmers.<br />
 * 	Support for innovative manufacturing through the $240 million 16th Cooperative Research Centres selection round, which will open for applications in February 2013.  At least $50 million from this funding round will support the development and application of new technologies to support growth and competitiveness in Australian manufacturing.<br />
 * 	Provision of more than $38 million in Clean Technology Grants for food processors to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and improve productivity.<br />
 * 	Establishing a Centre for Workplace Leadership to encourage higher performing workplaces and stronger leadership capability to boost productivity.</p>
<p>These further steps to strengthen Australian manufacturing and services reflect the recommendations of the Prime Minister's Manufacturing Taskforce, which reported this year.</p>
<p>Early next year the Government will release an Industry and Innovation Statement setting out a long term agenda to strengthen Australian industries, create Australian jobs and seize new opportunities in the Asian Century.</p>
<p>The Statement will outline the Government's plan to encourage the growth of a competitive, productive manufacturing sector built on innovation, quality products and services underpinned by the application of new research and knowledge.</p>
