PRIE MINI! STER<br />
FOR INEDIA 24 SEPTEMBER 19892<br />
MR HAYDEN'S ALL~ EGATIONS AGA1INST MR J. B. REID<br />
A copy of Mr O'Reilly's. letter to mr lieid has been released.<br />
mr O'Reilly makes it clear that whent tho companies Were sold<br />
they had no unsat*. isfied income tax u o~ eLm<br />
at which Mr Reid ceased to h a.% c any connection. with them.<br />
In. other words, tax clue had beent paid.<br />
Mr O'Reilly also nade it clear that Mr~ Raid was only a<br />
trustee for 4,* fa,; nU unrelated to him anft not i~ n any sensea<br />
direct beneficiary from the sale of the companies.<br />
He has also advised that Mr Reid wil~ l have no responnbilitics.<br />
under the special. recoupment legislation the Treasurer<br />
introduced into the Parliament last night. Thait means that<br />
the operations were not bottCom of the harbour operations.<br />
That was what Lhat legislatioa w. as designed to catch. Bottomc<br />
ofJ t -e harbour operations were ones. in which companies were<br />
sold with cu-rent-tax liabilitio. s. which had not been paid<br />
and the companies were then put iLn a position in which they<br />
could aot pay tax.<br />
That is not Mr'Reid's case.<br />
On thle facts set out in Mr O'Reill~ y's letter, it is clear that<br />
Mr Hayden's accusations are scurrilous in the extremne.<br />
Mr Hayden has used privilege of-Parliamnent to give him<br />
immunity against laws designed to protect people from cowardly<br />
. and unjustified allegattions. In the years that I have been in<br />
the Parliament I have not yet seen such a despicable display<br />
of character assassination.<br />
With Mr Hayden, no decent Australian is free from the risk of<br />
character assassination. + Mr Hayden would not mnake these<br />
attacks outside the Parliament.<br />
14r Hayden is more interested in destroying the character of<br />
decent Australians than he is in pursuing important issues of<br />
positive Government.<br />
Australians will judge accordingly. -Ooooooooo---</p>
