FOR PRESS<br />
ND 54 STATEiENT BY THE LINISTER FOR NATION* L DEVELOPI-ENT<br />
( Hon. David Fairbairn, iM. P.)<br />
COMION. IEALTH OFFERS TO FINNCE WORK<br />
ON SNO -Y MOUITAINS ROADS<br />
The Snowy Mountains authority will offer the New South<br />
Wales Government 33A million to help maintain Snowy Mountains<br />
tourist roads for the next 20 years.<br />
The Minister for National Development ( Mr. Fairbairn)<br />
said this today. He said that in addition to contributions for the<br />
maintenance of roads for the use of the public and the S. i. I. A.,<br />
the Authority this summer was prepared to spend '&gt; 50,000 in<br />
restoring the Alpine . ay to its 1965 condition '' hen the<br />
Snowy Mountains Authority, having no further need for the road,<br />
ceased regular maintenance.<br />
This part of the offer was conditional upon the State<br />
accepting future responsibility for the Alpine Way.<br />
Mr. Fairbairn said the $ 3,250,000 would be made<br />
available to the State at $ 200,000 a year for the first ten<br />
years, $ 150,000 a year for the next five years, and $ 100,000<br />
a year for the final five years.<br />
" The Snowy Mountains authority and the Commonwealth<br />
have spent about $ 30 million on the construction of roads to<br />
and within the Snowy Mountains area," Mr. Fairbairn said.<br />
" These roads, including the . Alpine ' ay, were built<br />
for the simple reason that it would have been impossible to get<br />
on with the Snowy i. iountains Scheme without them.<br />
" However, they have proved a major tourist asset to<br />
the State, and this is a side dividend that we are all pleased<br />
to see. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" Mvlost of the roads in the area are still being<br />
maintained at the expense of the Snowy Mountains Authority.<br />
" The , uthority's use of the roads is decreasing and<br />
the tourist traffic is increasing rapidly.<br />
" We estimate that in a few years the traffic<br />
attributable to the operation and maintenance of the Scheme<br />
will be less than 2 per cent of the traffic in the area.<br />
" In these circumstances, we think it is fair to begin<br />
a phased change in responsibility for the upkeep of these roads.<br />
" To begin with, the Federal offer will cover more than<br />
half the estimated cost of maintanance.<br />
" The h uthority's need for the _ ilpine Way ended some<br />
years ago, but it is considered reasonable to restore it to its<br />
former condition before it passes into the care of the State."<br />
, tr. Fairbairn said the Snowy Authority was still<br />
studying a suggestion that it should p; y the State a licence fee<br />
for the occupation of land by hydro-electic and other works.<br />
