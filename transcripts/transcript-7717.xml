PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH DON CHIPP, RADIO 3AK,<br />
MELBOURNE, 21 AUGUST 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
CHIPP: It was about 25 years ago, we almost had a punch-up<br />
the first time we met, a friendly one. It was in John<br />
Gorton's office, solving the problems of the world and I<br />
0 heard this voice about 10 metres away saying, ' who's that<br />
fellow, get him out of here'. And I said who's going to get<br />
me out? You come up here and say like a couple of big<br />
kids we, in high noon fashion confronted each other and I<br />
thought well if he's going to give me one I'll get the first<br />
one in and then we both started laughing at each other, put<br />
our arms around each other, and I think it's fair to say<br />
we've been pretty good buddies ever since.<br />
PM: Fair commentary.<br />
CHIPP: Anyway, welcome to the program. I'm deeply grateful<br />
that you've come on.<br />
PM: Pleasure.<br />
CHIPP: I must say that you're looking fabulous.<br />
PM: Feeling well Don, feeling very well.<br />
CHIPP: It's the clean living, is it?<br />
PM: It's a number of factors, that's part of it.<br />
CHIPP: What's the day in the life of Bob Hawke? I know<br />
you're asked this a million times. What time do you<br />
normally get up?<br />
PM: I wake reasonably early, I read the papers and then<br />
CHIPP: What's that, six o'clock?<br />
PM: Six, half past six. I wake about then. I try and read<br />
as much of the papers as I can Don, and then it's go, go, go<br />
and then I can finish at midnight, 1 o'clock in the morning.<br />
CHIPP: And breakfast. What sort of breakfast do you have? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: When I'm at The Lodge it's always Pritikin. I have<br />
fresh fruit, bran, muesli, wholemeal bread and orange juice,<br />
that's the go.<br />
CHIPP: You're still sticking to that Pritikin diet?<br />
PM: Always when I'm in Canberra I have it at The Lodge and<br />
over in the office. But of course when you're travelling<br />
Don, you can't be absolutely on it. But I try to do it as<br />
much as I can.<br />
CHIPP: But you've put a lot of good health, don't you?<br />
PM: Just look at it this way. What I say Don, is this; if<br />
you're got a motor car or motor bike or something, you know<br />
that the quality and the performance of that engine is going<br />
to depend overwhelmingly on what you put into it. If you<br />
don't put good oil or petrol into the thing it's not going<br />
to perform at its maximum. Now the human body's no<br />
different. CHIPP: Well talking about the performance of the human<br />
body, I was told something just a couple of months ago and<br />
I didn't think you could learn anything when you get to my<br />
age but you can. I've always thought that the body and the<br />
mind needed work and play.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
CHIPP: But somebody has said this to me, this very wise<br />
thing. But there's another thing; work, play and idleness.<br />
Sheer idleness. Now idleness is different to play.<br />
PM: Absolutely. I think<br />
CHIPP: Do you agree with that?<br />
PM: Absolutely. I think the capacity to relax is a secret<br />
of productive and happy living and it's quite right to play<br />
is not necessarily the constituent to give you relaxation.<br />
The capacity to just sit, lay about and part of that also is<br />
the capacity to listen. You've been in politics and public<br />
life a long time. How many good listeners do you know?<br />
CHIPP: Not many.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
CHIPP: In fact they give the pretence of listening but they<br />
don't listen.<br />
PM: That's right. You can see them preparing you know<br />
their spiel while people are there. I mean the essence of,<br />
I think, of intelligent public life is to try and learn as<br />
much from others as you possibly can. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
CHIPP: If I may say so it's one of the things that always<br />
impressed me about you and leading the Democrats I'd come in<br />
with some very vexed problem and you'd sit there and you'd<br />
listen, you wouldn't interrupt and you'd just listen. Would<br />
you believe that Bob Menzies used to do the same thing? He<br />
was known as being an arrogant man but a great listener, and<br />
in the Cabinet he was extremely patient and he had a few<br />
boring Ministers around who used to go on and on. Do you<br />
find it difficult to lose your patience in those sorts of<br />
situations. PM: Sometimes, sometimes but I've always, you know going<br />
back as far as I can remember, I've always thought that it's<br />
just plain stupid to assume that dialogue is just described<br />
as monologue. I mean really you should have the good sense<br />
to listen to what people have got to say the<br />
overwhelming majority of cases that they've got integrity<br />
and mean what they say, that's fine and in the end life is<br />
about not imposing or sometimes you've got to<br />
imposition, but in the end the things are going to stick and<br />
work and the things that people can be persuaded about.<br />
CHIPP: Just as God, who can restrain his tongue when he<br />
knows he's in the right.<br />
PM: Well it's a mixture of the truth and..<br />
CHIPP: How many times do you and Hazel have dinner together<br />
a week on average?<br />
PM: Not too often because I'm virtually always working at<br />
the office, you know, when I'm in Canberra.<br />
CHIPP: You're still not doing sandwich over work?<br />
PM: Not a sandwich. I have a good bloke there where my<br />
dinner and lunch is bought over from The Lodge, it's<br />
Pritikin stuff so none of this sandwich business, mate.<br />
CHIPP: Well what do you do? I mean you're in your office,<br />
do you have a couple of mates in to eat with you? Do you<br />
eat alone or do you work while you eat? I suspect you do<br />
that. PM: I tend to work most of the time while I eat but I often<br />
use it to have my staff in to talk about things or handle a<br />
bit of correspondence or issues that they want some guidance<br />
or opinions on.<br />
CHIPP: But that's not relaxing while you're eating is it?<br />
Is it wise to do it that way?<br />
PM: Well I try and relax a bit at times. I mean I do a<br />
cryptic crossword at times when I'm eating. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
CHIPP: Prime Ministers have lots of interesting little<br />
tidbits to do from time to time, needs the Prime<br />
Ministerial decision. I suppose that's the sort of thing<br />
you'd do over a meal?<br />
PM: my Principal Private Secretary will come in and say<br />
well these things can be handled just a signature or I'd<br />
like your view on this and those sorts of things you can<br />
handle while you're eating.<br />
CHIPP: I know you're a great family man, you love in<br />
the family. It must hurt you a bit not to be able to get<br />
together as a family as often. Do you do that once a year<br />
like at Christmas? Do you still try to do that?<br />
PM: Well as a matter of fact Don, in the very, very near<br />
future we'll all be together because my son Stephen is<br />
having a book he's written on Nookenbah is being launched in<br />
a few weeks time and the whole family is going to be there<br />
in Canberra for the launch that, which we're quite excited<br />
about. CHIPP: Yes, yes. I'll bet you're looking forward to it<br />
then. PM: Yes, I am. I'm very proud of him.<br />
CHIPP: What do you think you're going to do when you get<br />
out of politics, when you do?<br />
PM: Well as I've said Don, I would love to have the<br />
opportunity in fact I will do it to have a series of<br />
interviews with people I've met during my Prime<br />
Ministership. People who in one way or another I think have<br />
had some significant influence in the way the world has gone<br />
or this country has goni. I've felt enormously privileged<br />
Don, to be able to know these people and to or in the<br />
case with them and I would just like to be able to share my<br />
feelings about what those people have done over the wide<br />
areas. So I intend to do a series of television interviews<br />
with people.<br />
CHIPP: You have really met some movers and shakers in your<br />
time, the real heavyweights of the world. Can I ask you<br />
which one stays in your mind? If you walked out of his or<br />
her office ' my God, that was impressive', and you came<br />
away thinking about it for hours afterwards? Is there any<br />
one particular man or woman who had that impression on you?<br />
PM: I think the two that really I'd have to single out<br />
would be Zhao Ziyang and we're all just praying so<br />
fervently that he's going to survive in China and I'd have<br />
to say Mikhail Gorbachev. I had the great privilege of<br />
having about 3 1/ 2 hours with Gorbachev. The most part of<br />
that about 2 1/ 4 hours as I say just the 2 of us with an<br />
interpreter which was a very special sort of privilege and<br />
then another hour or so when Bill Hayden was there. But </p>
<p>( PM4 cont) basically it was still good talking to him..<br />
and I think in answer to your question I'd have to say those<br />
two. Although let me say it's a strange sort of thing that<br />
you know when your with Reagan you never went away with<br />
impression of, you know, the same sort of But I just<br />
think its fair as I've mentioned Gorbachev, if we're talking<br />
about the basis for optimism in the world today I mean<br />
there's a greater basis for optimism now than at any other<br />
stage since the Second World War. I think it's fair that<br />
credit be given to Reagan. I mean<br />
CHIPP: For listening?<br />
PM4: Well for listening and for being prepared to change. I<br />
mean we believed and I think correctly that when he came<br />
to the office of President of the United States Don, that<br />
this status and the stature of the United States had been<br />
weakened and that situation had been able to get away<br />
with murder, and he committed himself to increasing the<br />
credibility and structure of the United States. I think in<br />
a funny sort of juxtaposition Gorbachev needed Reagan and<br />
Reagan needed Gorbachev.<br />
CHIPP: But Gorbachev pricked the balloon of those tight<br />
arsed rednecks in the United States who were always going<br />
around at the White House saying what we need prevalent is<br />
another good war. It certainly fixed those fellows, didn't<br />
it? PM: Yes, well see we're at this conjunction of<br />
circumstances in history where at last, thank God, the<br />
leaders of the communist world have realised that they've<br />
been living a charade, an irrelevancy and that if they are<br />
going to provide improved standards for their people, and<br />
properly to take account of their security considerations,<br />
then they've got to abandon this stupid pretence that a<br />
command economy is the best way of utilising the resources.<br />
So you've that understanding and a commitment on the part of<br />
your Gorbachevs and the people that live in so many parts of<br />
the Eastern Bloc and China, although we can talk about that<br />
seperately. The realisation that they've got to change the<br />
system and fortunately you've got intelligent responses,<br />
including some traditionally conservative people like<br />
Margaret Thatcher and Reagan and Bush. They haven't allowed<br />
their innate political conservatism to blind their<br />
understanding that you must have a constructive response to<br />
these things and this is a unique period in history.<br />
CHIPP: What's your impressions of Margaret Thatcher?<br />
You've got a deep respect for her, haven't you?<br />
PM: I have profound differences of view on many issues with<br />
Margaret Thatcher. But we have a relationship of respect.<br />
I don't question the sincerity and the integrity with which<br />
she holds her views. She has been prepared to be tough to<br />
carry through her position I mean there are lots of<br />
things about what she's done, as I say, I disagree with. </p>
<p>( PM cont) But if you're looking at it in a global sense,<br />
again Margaret Thatcher is one of the earliest of world<br />
leaders to recognise the importance of Gorbachev. She held<br />
out the hand and she said, ' alright, we're ideologically<br />
poles apart. But I recognise that you are dinkum and in me<br />
you have a person who is going to be<br />
CHIPP: Why has she got it in for Malcolm?<br />
PM: Well I can't go into all the details of it but she did<br />
CHIPP: There's a story there, isn't there?<br />
PM: Well in regard to 1979<br />
CHIPP: Robert James Lee Hawke I'll press the question, is<br />
there a story there or is there not?<br />
PM: There is a bit of a story in regard to 1979, the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Lusaka. A bit<br />
of a story there.<br />
CHIPP: And you can't go any further than that?<br />
PM: I don't think either of us were participants. One<br />
day I might tell you a little bit about it and you'll<br />
laugh. CHIPP: You're not going to tell me..<br />
PM: No, I can tell you what it's about. I mean there was a<br />
CHIPP: inaudible<br />
PM: Now, now. I can't go into all the details but I can<br />
give you the essence of what it was about and that was that<br />
there was the workings out of the agreement as to how the<br />
transition from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe would be handled by the<br />
Heads of Government and essentially Margaret had the feeling<br />
that Malcolm jumped the gun a bit in the releasing of this<br />
to the public. I mean that's the essence of the story but<br />
it has some " amusing" aspects to it.<br />
CHIPP: As amusing as Memphis?<br />
PM: I don't want to talk about Memphis. I think life is<br />
more important than<br />
CHIPP: Yes it is. what about your religious beliefs? I<br />
haven't had a talk to you about that for a year or so. Have<br />
you changed in any way towards your belief in a God or your<br />
non-belief in a God? </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PM: No, I'm still agnostic. I've always tried to let<br />
people understand to the extent that they're interested<br />
in what I believe and don't believe that I ceased to<br />
believe in the form and so on that I have never really lost<br />
not only my beliefs but commitment to what I perceive to be<br />
the essential principle of Christianity and of some of the<br />
other religions but essentially of religion in which I was<br />
brought up. I mean what are those essentials? I think<br />
they're very simple basically and that is that all people<br />
are created equal or they are as they say in of<br />
Christianity well all sons and daughters of God as for Jesus<br />
Christ. As my father would put it to me if you have the one<br />
Father then you're all brothers and sisters and that<br />
involves a relationship between human beings. Now that sort<br />
of fundamental has always guided my life.<br />
SCHIPP: Prime Minister, would you mind waiting near the<br />
so we can few people around here?<br />
PM: Well I can see you need it mate, and I<br />
CHIPP: Prime Minister, I want to congratulate you, I'm<br />
going to give you a bad time hopefully in a minute. But for<br />
the moment I want to congratulate you on the strength that<br />
you and the Government have handled the pilots' strike. I<br />
don't know anything more outrageous or contemptible than<br />
what they are doing. They immeasurable damage to our<br />
tourist industry and what they could do to is what I<br />
regard of the most significant achievement of your<br />
Government, namely the Accord. This morning I spoke to<br />
the President of the Air Pilots Federation and he said this<br />
and, I'd like you to comment<br />
( comments were not fed to Canberra)<br />
CHIPP: Well Prime Minister, it's a pretty serious<br />
accusation, it's almost conspiritorial. I'd like you to<br />
S comment on that as far as Australian Airlines are concerned<br />
and maybe Sir Peter Abeles has told you something about<br />
Ansett? PM: I simply don't believe Captain McCarthy and I've been<br />
with the owners of the airlines and operators of airlines<br />
yesterday. It simply is not true and if we're talking about<br />
the president of the Airline Pilots Federation I'd just like<br />
to read what a former president of the Federation, Captain<br />
Tony Fitzgibbon's has said and this is the quote from a<br />
memorandum which he circulated, ' there is no other pilot<br />
group in the world that enjoys your overall pay structure'.<br />
Now that's what they said and he's right. I mean if you'd<br />
just like me to talk briefly about this, I won't take a long<br />
time. What we've got to understand when we're talking about<br />
pilots is that they have attempted to create some mystical,<br />
magical illusion that pilots are somehow different because<br />
they're up there flying aeroplanes, but not only are they<br />
above the world in a physical sense but they are above and<br />
beyond everyone else. Now let's get it straight. First of<br />
all, how long do they work? </p>
<p>-8-<br />
CHIPP: Well on average they told me available 300 hours<br />
a month which is, 1 think, twisting a few figures.<br />
PM: Look what is the average hours worked at the stick?<br />
Eight hours a week at the stick. Now what do you do about<br />
becoming a pilot? I mean are they really some mysterious<br />
group of people? I mean I have learnt to fly. When I<br />
was at oxford I joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve<br />
Squadron. I learnt to fly. So I'm not talking about<br />
something I know absolutely nothing about. I've learnt to<br />
fly Now it's not extraordinarily difficult to learn to<br />
fly. I mean you're a knock-about bloke, I mean you know<br />
tradesmen don't you, a bloke's sort of done 4 or 5 years of<br />
apprenticeship to become a tradesperson. In the very real<br />
sense if your training involved in acquiring the skills in<br />
many trades I mean to become a pilot.<br />
CHIPP: Well I could support that. I was in the Air Force<br />
and we had a 10 hour test. If you couldn't fly after<br />
hours training<br />
PM: inaudible<br />
CHIPP: No you got kicked out, kicked out. So most of us<br />
learnt to fly in about 7 hours.<br />
PM: Yes, I was about 7. Now you and I would be saying in<br />
putting that point that they haven't got an enormous<br />
responsibility, of course they have. A bus driver has got<br />
an enormous responsibility. The other thing again as a<br />
pilot you notice when I first started flying as a passenger<br />
in this country DC3' s were the Now Don, you just<br />
compare flying in those days with now. First of all, you<br />
know they say they're only of the time. Secondly, no<br />
radar to enable them to dodge all the tough and rough<br />
conditions. I mean in terms of actually flying now, it's<br />
easier, infinitely easier, to fly now than it was before.<br />
CHIPP: And safer.<br />
PM: And safer. Now what they've got to understand is sure<br />
it's glamorous but they are nothing special in terms of the<br />
acquisition of skills or their importance to society. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
CHIPP: Let's go to an even more fundamental issue, is it<br />
your view and I ask you this, not only as Prime minister but<br />
your experience in the trade union movement, if they grabbed<br />
this 30 percent outside the guidelines, would you say that<br />
is the end of the Accord? wages breakout, the like of<br />
which we have not seen since 1974?<br />
PM: That's right, although 1981<br />
CHIPP: That was the last one, but the ' 74 breakout was<br />
caused by a pilot<br />
PM: Well it was you had the breakout in ' 81.<br />
The interesting thing is, if I can make the political about<br />
this, because what to some extent in the Financial<br />
Review today, that what's on trial here is the Opposition's<br />
new wages policy because the pilots are practising the<br />
Opposition's wages policy. They say, get away with the<br />
centralised wages system, let there be just negotiations<br />
between employers and their employees, the pilots are<br />
practising the Opposition. It's just a recipe for disaster.<br />
CHIPP: But to be fair, didn't the opposition bring in an<br />
amendment, a private members' bill last week, or tried to<br />
bring it in in the Senate, which would have laid heavy<br />
penalties on the pilots if they wouldn't return to work?<br />
PM: They're talking about legislation penalties, but that's<br />
not the point. The fundamental point about the Opposition's<br />
wages policy is to do away with a centralised system so that<br />
there can, in fact, be negotiations let it be worked<br />
out between the employer and the employee. Now, as I say,<br />
that's a recipe for disaster we've been there, tried it,<br />
done it.<br />
S CHIPP: Well, the President of the air pilots said on this<br />
program, virtually ' if we can't get what we want within the<br />
system, we'll go outside the system and grab it'.<br />
PM: You have said that and what we're saying is OK boys, we<br />
don't want you to go out, we want you to stay in, but the<br />
system Alright if that's what you decide to do<br />
this afternoon then you'll find out what's it's like outside<br />
the system.<br />
CHIPP: Can you confirm that your Government has given a<br />
strict, unequivocal instruction to Australian Airlines that<br />
under no circumstances are they to cave in on this?<br />
PM: The interesting thing is we haven't had to ( tape break)<br />
PM: and they made it quite clear there have been no<br />
directive, they haven't needed to direct them because their<br />
position has been quite clear, as is Ansett's. They know </p>
<p>CHIPP: Well if Australian don't give in it's on principle<br />
that Ansett's would.<br />
PM: Ansett won't give in and Australian won't give in. We<br />
have this position that its operators and the Government are<br />
at one on this because we all know that this would be the<br />
end of the wages<br />
CHIPP: There are about 1600 pilots, there's a nonsense<br />
story coming out of Canberra this morning, that you might<br />
bring the RAAF pilots into it.<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
CHIPP: There wouldn't be enough.<br />
PM: No, no, no, what we've got to face is if they go<br />
outside the system and they don't provide their services,<br />
there's no way in which we can provide an equivalent service<br />
that the two major operators are providing, but what we are<br />
looking at are ways in which we can provide some skeletal<br />
sort of service.<br />
CHIPP: For emergency only?<br />
PM: well perhaps more than emergencies<br />
CHIPP: You're not ruling out that if the worst comes to the<br />
worst you could bring in, without prejudicing defence<br />
requirements, a number of airforce pilots?<br />
PM: I'm not ruling out anything.<br />
CHIPP: I don't want to _ get a heavy talk on the Budget and<br />
S lIi'kme sutrhei s? y ou Thdeo n'nte, w srbouto m caanr ouIn dj ushte re, whiycohu r isn exotn e qoufe sttiheon<br />
best in the country, Thursday of last week and<br />
said simply there's no news. I thought that was<br />
extraordinary in Budget week, that on Thursday there was no<br />
news to talk about.<br />
PM: They're a great newsroom, but what they really meant by<br />
that, what they really meant by that, there was no bad news,<br />
there was nothing, no criticism going around. There's an<br />
enormous amount of news in it. I mean, as you know, the<br />
importance of what we've done in the area of pensions and<br />
superannuation. Enormous news but not bad news. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
CHIPP: Exactly, well that ought to please you. But could I<br />
just put a gloom note<br />
PM: Come on<br />
CHIPP: Yes, I must because there are two messages loud and<br />
clear in that goddamn Budget, mainly that we're going to<br />
have inflation, according to you, of 7.5 percent for the<br />
year and that we're going to be $ 18.5 billion deeper in debt<br />
at the end of the year. Now those two figures are very bad<br />
news. PM: But the good part, and you're right in terms of the<br />
year on your average, but the Budget and Budget papers make<br />
it quite clear that through the year there's going to a<br />
decline, I mean, the rate will be going down, both in<br />
inflation and in regard to the current account deficit. In<br />
other words, we will have in the first part of the financial<br />
year high figures, but they will be coming down through the<br />
year. CHIPP: The latest you can have an election without having a<br />
half Senate is about May isn't it?<br />
PM: That if we go with the half Senate, that's about it.<br />
CHIPP: Are you prepared to rule out today that you will not<br />
have a half Senate election?<br />
PM: I've answered that question, I just said it's not on as<br />
far as I can see it.<br />
CHIPP: It's rule out-<br />
PM: As far as I can see, I can't see<br />
CHIPP: we can now look forward with certainty, there<br />
will be an election in may or before 1990?<br />
PM: That's as I see it, yes. In may or before.<br />
CHIPP: But you're the only one who has got a say in it.<br />
PM: I make the decision, yes.<br />
CHIPP: I put it fair on you, right here and now, as a<br />
buddy. Come on, is there going to be an election in May or<br />
before? PM: There'll be, I believe, an election in May or before.<br />
CHIPP: What sort of circumstances would lead you to going<br />
earlier? </p>
<p>-12-<br />
PM: Well, I've indicated I can go before may.<br />
CHIPP: Well, what sort of circumstances would persuade you<br />
to go earlier than May?<br />
PM: Well I'm not talking about significantly earlier than<br />
May. I mean, it just seems to me, that if you look at the<br />
record of my Government, it's gone from what we did in ' 84,<br />
as you know, as you were fully aware and you agreed with, we<br />
had the election in ' 84 early so that you could synchronise<br />
the Senate and the House of Representatives.<br />
CHIPP: Are you prepared to rule out this morning you won't<br />
go before Christmas?<br />
PM: I don't see it. I don't see it.<br />
CHIPP: A fair question is do you rule it out?<br />
PM: You're asking me to say in regard to every conceivable<br />
or unconceivable circumstance, if, not on. The honest<br />
answer I give you, as far as I can possibly see it, it is<br />
not on.<br />
CHIPP: So if circumstances continue as they are you'd rule<br />
it out?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CHIPP: Thank you. Prime Minister,...... people can talk to<br />
the Prime minister of Australia. We've got a few calls if<br />
you wouldn't mind putting your earphones on and we'll go to<br />
David from<br />
CALLER: Prime Minister, I'd like to say that I support your<br />
S on your line with the pilots and I think most of my<br />
friends feel the same way<br />
PM: Can it just be turned up a bit, I'm not hearing it too<br />
well. CALLER: OK, well look I'm going to get a bit contrary now<br />
unfortunately, but I've got a bone to pick with you on what<br />
I see as a very big contradiction in Government policies.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: Namely the immigration policy and the environmental<br />
statement that you just released.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: Now the statement targets basically soil<br />
degradation and pollution and so forth </p>
<p>-13-<br />
PM4: Yes.<br />
CALLER: But it seems to totally ignore the impact of the<br />
increase in population.<br />
PM4: Yes.<br />
CALLER: Now the ACF policy states that increasing<br />
population is inconsistent with environmental protection and<br />
in fact the CSIRO, I think, state that the upper sustainable<br />
limit is about 22 million in this country, as they see it<br />
and we'll probably be about 29 million population will<br />
lead directly to increased pollution and soil degradation.<br />
Now<br />
S CHIPP: David, would you come to your question please, we've<br />
got a lot of calls.<br />
CALLER: I'd just like to ask you why just totally ignore<br />
it? It just seems that the Government seems to think that<br />
increase in population really has nothing to do with the<br />
environment? PM: No, I don't think that. In fact any scientific study<br />
that you want to look at will point to the fact that in<br />
regard to the major environmental problem facing the world,<br />
that is the Greenhouse effect and depletion of the ozone<br />
layer, the enormous increase in population and<br />
associated human activity is one of the fundamental<br />
contributing factors. Now having said that, you haven't<br />
rendered any intelligent analysis of the issue, you've got<br />
to say alright, what are the sorts of things which you can<br />
do in the context of a growing population to limit the<br />
adverse environmental factors of the way we as human beings<br />
S wceo ndcuacnt amouern d acantdi viatdijeuss t noouwr anadc titvhietriee sa, r e bomtahn y hewraey s anidn wahriocuhnd<br />
the world. The other point I want to make is this....<br />
that our population policy in this country is a component<br />
obviously of two things. One, our natural increase within<br />
the country and our immigration policy. I want to make it<br />
clear to you that, as far as I'm concerned, we have an<br />
obligation to take people from other parts of the world and<br />
we need, I think, to optimise our productive capacity, more<br />
people. So the answer is, sure population is relevant,<br />
intelligently see what you can do to change the pattern of<br />
activities to avoid the worst consequences of excessive past<br />
practices. CHIPP: We now go to Don from Blackburn. Good morning Don.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Don.<br />
CHIPP: Is Bob Hawke stopping you and your wife from having<br />
children? </p>
<p>-14-<br />
CALLER: Yes, I believe there's two forms of discrimination<br />
going on. I'd like to ask Mr Prime Minister a question, is<br />
that both my wife and I have worked extremely hard to get<br />
into our house for many years, we have no need for<br />
Government subsidies or anything such as that. We're<br />
ordinary Australians who pay taxes, but we feel if we have<br />
children we're going to then rely on the Government<br />
to help us out with certain subsidies because we can't<br />
afford to pay the interest rates. The second thing is,<br />
there is discrimination with two sets of interest rates as<br />
far as 13, opposed to 17. I'd like to find out what advice<br />
Mr Hawke has for me.<br />
PM: Well first thing, Don, I want to say is that I know<br />
that high interest rates are hurting but I hope that you<br />
accept that I'm a reasonably intelligent sort of bloke and<br />
that I know that they are causing some discomfort and I<br />
haven't got them there for fun. They are there for a very<br />
simple reason. They are there for the interests of all<br />
Australians, including yourself. We've got a situation now<br />
where the level of activity in the economy is so high that<br />
we're sucking in a level of imports that we can't afford.<br />
Now, we have got to slow the level of activity down. We<br />
couldn't have a Budget policy tighter, we've got the fourth<br />
successive year of real reductions in our Commonwealth<br />
outlays, we've moved the Budget into massive surplus. We've<br />
got a tight wages policy, the third arm of policy is<br />
monetary policy. That means we've got to have tight<br />
monetary policy and high interest rates and that's for your<br />
welfare and the welfare of all Australians because if we<br />
didn't do that, if we laxed these arms of policy then what<br />
would in fact happen, the economy would collapse and<br />
interest rates would go absolutely through the roof. So<br />
Don, they are there because it's necessary. I wouldn't have<br />
interest rates at that level for one second higher than is<br />
necessary. I give you the undertaking that they will come<br />
down as soon as it's responsible to take that action. The<br />
second point in regard to discrimination, you had a<br />
position where there was the regulation of those interest<br />
rates at 13.5 percent, it's now only of the order of 35 to<br />
percent who are in that situation, that commitment was<br />
made and that will be kept.<br />
CHIPP: Thank you very much for your call. We now go to<br />
Gary from Ivanhoe.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Don, happy birthday.<br />
CHIPP: Thank you very much mate.<br />
CALLER: Thank you for the opportunity of talking to Mr<br />
Hawke. Mr Hawke,<br />
PM: Yes, Gary. </p>
<p>CALLER: About two and a half years ago I lost my eyesight.<br />
I'm not whingeing about that, for a year I sat under a rock<br />
and felt sorry for myself, but for the last eighteen months<br />
I've been busting my guts to get back into the workforce and<br />
re-establish myself. I've had a managerial background and<br />
had my own business and so on, but what really gets up my<br />
nose is the fact that the whole system is designed to crush<br />
you, from the point of view, people say ' oh yes, but Gary,<br />
now what you're good for is opening the bloody letters or<br />
answering the phone'. Your equal opportunity, I'm not<br />
blaming you because you probably don't know, but the equal<br />
opportunity philosophy is not working. There's 8,000<br />
visibly impaired people here in Victoria, 44 of them are<br />
looking for work. of those 44, probably 12 will make it.<br />
I'll make it because what this has taught me is that it's<br />
0 taught me that I'm very strong. In fact I had a talk to<br />
your, my local member is Peter Staples and a pretty fair<br />
bloke too<br />
PM: Good bloke.<br />
CALLER: Good bloke, and he said he has to stay at arms<br />
length to the Public Service. He can't ring up one of his<br />
guys and say ' look, have a look at this Gary Farmer and get<br />
him into a position of his ability'.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: It is very frustrating.<br />
PM: Gary, look, let me say two things quickly and the<br />
second thing I hope which will be specifically helpful to<br />
you. First, we are conscious of the need to improve the<br />
whole disabilities program, we've made lots of improvements,<br />
by no means perfect. But look, in regard to your own case,<br />
0 obviously on air I can't discuss it in detail, but would you<br />
do this, please? Would you write to my mate, Chippy, and<br />
just set out your background and your address, I'd like to<br />
correspond with you directly and take into account, because<br />
while Peter is right in saying you can't instruct the Public<br />
Service, you've got to stay at arms length, there's<br />
nevertheless some things that we may be able to help. I'd<br />
like to know the circumstances. If you write to Don I give<br />
you my personal undertaking I'll look at it and see what we<br />
can do.<br />
CHIPP: Gary, you can't do better than that.<br />
CALLER: No, that's great.<br />
CHIPP: OK, fantastic and we'll help you here as well.<br />
Gary thanks for calling and thanks for everyone else who<br />
called. </p>
<p>-16-<br />
PM: Don, I deliberately hadn't said anything about this<br />
point beforehand because I didn't know whether, before I<br />
came on, it had been shared with the public, but it is your<br />
birthday. CHIPP: Yes, indeed<br />
PM: Well you've told me some of the rudenesses, but often<br />
rudeness only occurs because it's properly attracted.<br />
CHIPP: bottle of vitamin E cream?<br />
PM: Well looking at your face, I'd put it on my face. But<br />
sincerely, mate, what you said at the beginning is right,<br />
we've been mates for a long time, had the odd arguments, but<br />
I feel a great friendship for you and I think you're lucky<br />
to have survived this long.<br />
CHIPP: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Yes, yes, sure it helps but<br />
CHIPP: Two things in the world that you've got to do is to<br />
love and be loved. You can do those two things, you're<br />
going to be happy and you're going to live a long time.<br />
PM: Yes I'm not talking in a sensual or serious way,<br />
but love is something that is capable I'm not talking in a<br />
sexist sense-<br />
CHIPP: No, no-<br />
PM: There's more than the physical relations and so you can<br />
have love for an enormous number of people.<br />
CHIPP: I know you love a lot of people. I've seen the<br />
emotions on your face and we're not talking in a<br />
sensual or sexual way and it makes it one of the best things<br />
that you can have.<br />
PM: And mateship is not just between blokes.<br />
CHIPP: That's right.<br />
PM: Well you can have the quality of mateship between<br />
sexes. But any rate, I just want to say to you really happy<br />
birthday, all the best.<br />
CHIPP: Thanks for coming in. Keep on being a good Prime<br />
minister. PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
