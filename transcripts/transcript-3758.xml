EDUCATION<br />
The Prime Minister, the Hon E. G. Whitlam, stated today<br />
that after consultation with the Minister for Education, the<br />

Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education into a<br />
single statutory advisory body to the Australian Government on<br />
universities and colleges.<br />
The Prime Minister said that notwithstanding the<br />
close working relationship which exists between the two Commi sions,<br />
the balanced development of the provision of university and<br />
advanced education throughout Australia would benefit from<br />
the creation of a single body.<br />
The Secretary of the Department of Education,<br />
Mr K. N. Jones, the Chairman of the Universities Commission,<br />
Professor P. H. Karmel, and the Chairman of the Commission on<br />
Advanced Education, Mr T. B. Swanson, have been asked to<br />
reconLmend how the amalgamation may best be put into effect.<br />
The panel, with Mr Jones as convenor, will consult with<br />
interested parties and will make its recommendations in time<br />
f.' r legislative action to be taken during the Budget Session<br />
of the Parliament later this year.<br />
