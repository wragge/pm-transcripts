JOINT PRESS STATEMENT BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAWKE, AND THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER, MR. NAKASONE. 1/ 2/ 84<br />
1. The relationship between Australia and Japan<br />
is of immense importance to both of us. The warmth of<br />
our relations reflects a common commitment to the ideals<br />
of freedom and democracy, as well as the extensive<br />
co-operation which has been developed in many fields.<br />
As we look towards the 21st century, it is<br />
clear that the Asia-Pacific region will contine to<br />
demonstrate the most rapid and dynamic economic development<br />
in the world. Our two countries are committed to further<br />
strengthening our co-operation with other countries in the<br />
region to ensure its peace, stability and prosperity.<br />
Australia and Japan together are able to make great<br />
contributions to the development of the region.<br />
2. The most urgent tasks in today's international<br />
society are the establishment of stable East-West relations<br />
and the achievement of arms control and disarmament. For<br />
this purpose,' we are " dotermined to continue to cooperate<br />
closely-both because ' f common regional interests and from<br />
the standpoint that we are members of the free and democratic<br />
community of nations.<br />
Under the present difficult international<br />
environment, the promotion of disarmament, in particular<br />
nuclear disarmament, is strongly desired. In view of the<br />
important roles of the United Nations and the Committee on<br />
Disarmament in this field, we intend to increase co-operation<br />
and make positive endeavours for the promotion of disarmament<br />
in these fora. We will continue to work together to strengthen<br />
the nuclear. non-proliferation regime and to achieve a<br />
comprehensive nuclear test ban.<br />
' e expess regret that the two most important<br />
nuclear disarmament. negotiations, namely the INF negotiations<br />
and the START talks, have been in the one case unilaterally<br />
suspended by the Soviet Union and in the other adjourned at<br />
Soviet initiative without the setting of a resumption date.<br />
We urge an early resumption of and real progress in these<br />
negotiations. We are particularly concerned that the INF<br />
negotiations should be conducted from a global perspective,<br />
taking into account the security of the Asia-Pacific region<br />
as well. / 2 </p>
<p>The Japanese side also reconfirms that Japan's<br />
basic stance on security is to achieve an effective defence<br />
capability limited to that necessary for self-defence,<br />
to maintain the Japan-U. S. security arrangements and to<br />
seek their smooth and effective operation, and that,<br />
maintaining a solely defensive posture under the Peace<br />
Constitution and its three non-nuclear principles, Japan<br />
will not become a military power nor pose any military<br />
threat to neighbouring countries.<br />
For its part, Australia appreciates that Japan<br />
has a sovereign right to determine its own security and<br />
defence policies and understands Japan's stance.<br />
3. The future outlook of the world economy is<br />
brighter today. as the economics of the industrial nations<br />
are recovering. It is at this time that it is necessary<br />
for us to devote our utmost efforts to the further<br />
development of an ope.. multilateral trading system. We<br />
Jointly recognise that, from this viewpoint, it 4s important<br />
to promote the preparations for-starting a new round of<br />
multilateral trade negotiations.<br />
Global trade expansion is indispe-sable for<br />
maintaining prosperity and stability in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region. The support. of a wide range of countries, including<br />
developing countries, is important in the preparations for a<br />
new round of multilateral trade negotiations. We declare<br />
that Japan and Australia will make cooperative efforts for<br />
the launching of the nogotiations.<br />
The cooperative efforts of Australia and Japan will<br />
be made in close consultation with their trading partners<br />
to ensure effective inputs from the Asia-Pacific region<br />
into the preparatiot for a new round. A new round of<br />
multilateral negotiations should deal effectively with the<br />
wide range of impediments to trade expansion and hence to<br />
world economic recovery.<br />
We share the view that the expansion and development<br />
of economic and trade relations between Japan and Australia<br />
has made and will continue to make a significant contribution<br />
to the economic development of the two countries.<br />
The Japanese side believes that the position of<br />
Australia as a supplier of primary products including minerals<br />
will not decline so long as these Australian products maintain<br />
their competitiveness and their stable supply is assured. The<br />
Japanese side confirms that it has no intention of dealing<br />
with the trade problems with third countries at the expense of<br />
Australia. / 3 </p>
<p>x S..<br />
Australia. irtends making good use of new<br />
opportunities for exporting manufactured goods and services<br />
that are increasing in demand in Japan. Offic'aLs will<br />
discuss measures to promote trade revitalisaton.<br />
The Australian side outlined recent developments<br />
in industriaL relations in Australia. The Japanese side<br />
welcomed the improvement in the industrial relations cLimate<br />
in Australia in recent months. </p>
