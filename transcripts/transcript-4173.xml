MEDIA RELEASE DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. J. D. Anthony<br />
I deplore and strongly condemn the actions of<br />
demonstrators who engaged in outrageous harassrnant and<br />
violence in a protest directed-at the Governor-General and<br />
other citizens in Melbourne last night.<br />
It-is -a responsibility of Australians throughout<br />
the community to reject the techniques being employed on'this<br />
and other occasions by an irresponsible minority of people<br />
fomenting trouble for their own ends.<br />
It is about time that people understood that<br />
Sir John Kerr's action of last November was proper and<br />
inescapable. The continuing attacks on the Governor-General<br />
are in reality attacks on the decision made by the Australian<br />
people in the December election, and on the democratic<br />
system wihich allowed them to make that decision.<br />
The continued harassment and violence directed ait<br />
Sir John and Lady Kerr, and other people, are un-Australian<br />
and will, I believe, be firmly rejected by the great<br />
majority of Australians.<br />
I commend the police forces on the way they are<br />
carrying out very difficult and obviously dangerous work<br />
and assure them that they have the Government's full support.<br />
* Canberra,<br />
24th June, 1976. </p>
