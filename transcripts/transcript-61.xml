WEDDING PRESENT TO THE CROWN PRINCE OF JAPAN<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister<br />
Australia has presented a watercolour, " Mt. Serle,<br />
FLinders Ranges" by Hans Heysen to the Crown Prince of Japan<br />
and his bride on the occasion of their marriage.<br />
Sir Alan Watt, Australian Ambassador to Japan, made<br />
the presentation. The watercolour is a fine example of Heysen's work<br />
and the Crown Prince expressed great pleasure when receiving<br />
it. The painting bears a plaque reading in part " From the<br />
Government and people of the Commonwealth of Australia,<br />
April, 1959".<br />
