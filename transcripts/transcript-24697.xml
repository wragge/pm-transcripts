    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâs statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific.<br />
Â <br />
Successive Japanese Governments have reflected on Japanâs actions during World War II. Prime Minister Abe made a sincere vow for peace in the Australian Parliament in July last year.<br />
Â <br />
Prime Minister Abeâs statement recognises the suffering by Australia and other countries during World War II. Australia has not forgotten this sacrifice and suffering. Those horrors teach us that the countries of our region all advance together, or none of us will advance at all.<br />
Â <br />
Australia and Japan have developed a strong and flourishing friendship because our people and leaders have refused to let the shadows of the past dictate the future.<br />
Â <br />
In the past 70 years, Australia and Japan have created a special relationship based on friendship, trust and shared values. Our nations are united in our commitment to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and above all else, peace.<br />
Â <br />
For decades, Japan has been an exemplary international citizen and contributor to global peace and stability.<br />
Â <br />
Prime Minister Abeâs apology builds on previous statements by the Japanese government. His words should make it easier for other countries to accept Japanâs commitment to a better future for all, and to strengthen their own friendships with Japan.<br />
