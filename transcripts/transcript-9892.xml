J: Mr Keating, are you satisfied this treaty is in Australia's best interests?<br />
PM: Well, I think the signing is going to be a moment in history which is<br />
going to very much shape Australia's future. And I think we feel the<br />
poignancy of that all of us, involved with it. And it will make not only<br />
Indonesia's and Australia's futures more secure, but in making it<br />
secure, it will make the region more secure.<br />
J: Mr Downer says it has been a very rushed secretive affair announced<br />
on Thursday, and suddenly signed on Monday.<br />
PM: It might have been rushed for the Opposition, it wasn't rushed for us. It<br />
took a couple of years in the making, and it's had all of the due<br />
process and consideration, and bilateral discussions that it should<br />
obviously have.<br />
J: But he says there's been no public debate surrounding this treaty.<br />
PM: Well, these sort of treaties require the support of the Government, the<br />
process of the Cabinet, and that is what it has had.<br />
J: Are you concerned about Dr Mahatir's comments?<br />
PM: I haven't seen them. In today's press? I haven't seen today's press.<br />
J He said that Australia<br />
PM: Look, I haven't seen today's press at all. Okay, I'll think I'll leave it at<br />
that. Thanks.<br />
