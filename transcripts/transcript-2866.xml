SUNDAY, 25 MARCH 1973<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, TO<br />
THE VICTORIAN GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE ALP, ST. KILDA TOWN HALL<br />
This is the first General Assembly of the Victorian<br />
Branch since the . House of Representatives elections. It's the<br />
first time I've spoken in this St. Kilda Town Hall since the<br />
great rally winding up the campaign for those elections.<br />
That meeting, the biggest and most enthusiastic political<br />
meeting I've ever attended is now part of Australian history.<br />
Among other things, that meeting symbolised the coming together<br />
of all the elements which now make Victoria a truly great branch<br />
of the Australian Labor Party. We won the elections federally<br />
because we won in Victoria and particularly in the capital of<br />
Victoria and we won in Victoria because the people of Victoria<br />
believed that the reconstruction in 1970 was a genuine<br />
remaking and remoulding of the Branch. That belief was not<br />
misplaced. I'm told by the Press that there's to be a<br />
confrontation today. The only confrontation that my Government<br />
is involved in in Victoria is not in the St. Kilda Town Hall<br />
but further up St. Kilda Road.<br />
In this room are represented all viewpoints of the Party<br />
any member of the Party who wanted to attend can come here today.<br />
Your time and efforts ' created the first Labor Government<br />
federally for 23 years. It's with your help that I'm now<br />
Prime Minister of Australia. I come here to co-operate<br />
not to confront you. I come here to thank you not to<br />
challenge you. You can all be proud of what you have done<br />
to create it. The Australian Government is your Government.<br />
You helped to make it. I come to thank you and to work with you.<br />
I think it's now quite clear what a Labor Government is all<br />
about and I think that the work of this Government has helped<br />
make clear what the reconstruction was all about. The point<br />
at issue in the years before 1970 was whether the aims of<br />
our Party could be achieved through Parliament and whether a<br />
change in the Government party would mean a real change in the<br />
direction of Australian society. The reconstruction was carried<br />
through in the belief that a party which wished to win the<br />
support of half the people of Australia should itself be<br />
representative of the views of at least half the people of<br />
Australia. We believed that such a party would be able to use<br />
Parliament and the Parliamentary system to affect great and<br />
real changes in the nation. We offered a chance to change.<br />
The people took up our offer. We are making the most of the<br />
opportunity they gave us. We have to acknowledge that<br />
significant sections of our people had come to despair of the<br />
Parliamentary system. If we hadn't won on 2 December the<br />
effective survival of the system wouldn't have been able to<br />
get much of an insurance policy. </p>
<p>I believe that what we've done in the last three months<br />
and even more what we are going to do in the next three years<br />
and the next three Parliaments, not only restores Parliament<br />
to its proper role as the effective instrument for economic,<br />
social and political change, but will prove that, if used<br />
properly, Parliament is the real instrument the only<br />
instrument for achieving democratic socialism in our time.<br />
Make no mistake about what we've been doing for the last<br />
three months. The Governor-General himself said in his speech<br />
opening the Parliament, our program is designed to achieve<br />
basic changes in the administration and structure of<br />
Australian society in the lifetime of this Parliament. We are<br />
well on the way towards achieving this. We are determined to<br />
affect our reforms in such a way that our reactionary opponents<br />
will not be able to dismantle what we have created should they<br />
ever again be given the opportunity.<br />
And let me say this in passing about our opponents:<br />
take no comfort at all in the fact that Mr Snedden or Mr Lynch<br />
eminent Victorians as they may be have proved so ineffective.<br />
The real result of their default is that the dominant voice<br />
on the right is the voice of reaction. The Liberal Party is<br />
moving under the control of men who speak the doctrine of<br />
fear and hatred. The voice of the Liberal Parliament which<br />
you now hear the Liberal Party which you now hear in the<br />
Federal Parliament and outside is the echo of the early fifties.<br />
These men haven't been chastened by defeat. They have merely<br />
been further embittered by it. That is, they are a party bent<br />
not on reform but on revenge, and it's our job to see that<br />
they never get that opportunity.<br />
It will be our fault if they get that chance to take<br />
revenge to put the clock back, to dismantle the new structure.<br />
I think it's fair to say that no government in Australia's<br />
history has moved so rapidly and successfully to implement<br />
the program for which it was elected. I have to confess that<br />
when we were compiling the policy speech we anticipated that<br />
it would take much longer to achieve substantial retention of<br />
our promises. Yet setting aside for the moment the great<br />
continuing matters the matters on which it will never be<br />
possible to say we've done enough -' things like schools or<br />
hospitals or cities setting them aside, we've already<br />
implemented or set in train 70 per cent of the specific<br />
promises in our policy speech. The real meaning of this,<br />
the significance of our Party's future and Australia's<br />
future is that by acting so competently we are freeing<br />
ourselves we are preparing ourselves to take the political<br />
debate in Australia to a new and yet even higher level. We<br />
will be able to do this much sooner than we expected in<br />
December. In 1975 we'll not just be standing on our record,<br />
though that record will, I believe, be a very proud one.<br />
We'll be seeking the people's support for a new program,<br />
a new mandate on new issues that will take this nation to a<br />
new and higher level of progress and progress and government. </p>
<p>It amazes me that people at home even some people<br />
abroad have expressed surprise at the speed with which<br />
we moved. Did anyone believe that we wouldn't do what we've<br />
been saying we'd do for years and years. I'd suppose it's really<br />
an illustration of how our opponents in their 23 years<br />
debauched the standards of Parliamentary politics and the<br />
standing of politicians. People had ceased to believe that<br />
politicians could be trusted to keep their word. I remember<br />
before the campaign that the draft resisters gave us only<br />
grudging support. They gave it to us not on the grounds that<br />
we were committed to the abolition of conscription but on the<br />
grounds that we might be more susceptible to pressure than our<br />
opponents. The first act of my first Government the<br />
duumvirate with Barcnard and Hasluck. The first act was<br />
to end the draft, to end national service prosecutions, to<br />
free everybody imprisoned under the Act. Should anybody have<br />
been surprised. We promised to do it. It was something we could<br />
do by administrative action and we did it in the very first week.<br />
Should anybody have been surprised that we immediately withdrew<br />
the vestigial military force, the advisers which had been<br />
left in Vietnam, that we cut off all military aid to South<br />
Vietnam. Admittedly that took longer. It took place in the<br />
second week. But we promised to do it. It could be done by<br />
administrative action and we did it. Could anybody have been<br />
surprised that, in the third week, before Christmas, we had<br />
secured the recognition of the People's Republic of China<br />
and the exchange of diplomatic representatives with them.<br />
We promised to do it. It took over two weeks to do that.<br />
We had to negotiate with another country, but we did it.<br />
We successfully negotiated with them.<br />
Could anybody have been surprised that when America<br />
resumed the bombing of Hanoi, we protested. We did immediately.<br />
Should anybody have been surprised that when the ceasef ire<br />
took place we immediately set in train and in a week secured<br />
the recognition and exchange of diplomatic representatives<br />
with North Vietnam? Now all these things, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
were things which could be done by administrative action or by<br />
negotiation with other countries. We did them all. Nobody<br />
could have done them more effectively, more promptly.<br />
All these things were things for which we sought a mandate,<br />
for which we secured a mandate, on which we discharged the<br />
mandate. Now I suppose this is an appropriate point for me<br />
to bring in some other matters of Foreign Affairs. You might<br />
have read about them.' I noticed in the agenda, that it is<br />
supposed that we say that we should get rid of all U. S. bases<br />
from Australia. We will carry out the mandate for which we<br />
were elected, for which we sought the mandate.<br />
And you will remember that the general context of<br />
a great number of suggestions are made that we are wanting to<br />
break the alliance with the that we are wanting to get<br />
out of ANZUS, and anything that anybody in the Party says<br />
which might have that effect is certain to have the maximum<br />
publicity. But that's not what the Platform says. It's not what<br />
the policy said. It's not what the mandate sought. Because<br />
what the Platform says is: the Labor Party seeks close<br />
continuing co-operation with the people of the United States<br />
and New Zealand to make the ANZUS Treaty an instrument for<br />
justice and peace and political, social and economic<br />
advancement in the Pacific area. And in the policy speech </p>
<p>as in every other respect I've followed it word for word:<br />
the close and continuing co-operation with the people of<br />
the United States and New Zealand to make it an instrument for<br />
justice and peace and for political, social and economic<br />
advancement in the Pacific. That's what the policy speech<br />
said. It's what it had to say because it was in the Platform,<br />
and that's what we want to make ANZUS. We want to make it<br />
what the Platform says it should be. We want to make it<br />
what the policy speech repeated that it should be. We want<br />
to make it what we sought a mandate to achieve. We want<br />
to make it what we were given a mandate to achieve.<br />
Now let me point out that there are five bases<br />
facilities ( that's a more appropriate term in most cases)<br />
which have some defence significance which the U. S. has<br />
arranged to have here. With two of them there has been a<br />
great deal of mystery for a long, long time. One has been<br />
at Alice Springs. It was to look at disturbances in the<br />
atmosphere and attendant phenomena. We revealed to the<br />
people and the Parliament that it was to detect nuclear<br />
explosions in the atmosphere. It's because it's able to<br />
do that that the U. S. felt confident to enter into the<br />
treaty with the Soviet Union and Britain to ban nuclear<br />
explosions in the atmosphere the treaty which China and<br />
France will not sign. The other one was at Amberley<br />
Air Force Base near Ipswich and it was to disturb tremors<br />
in the underground and of course to distinguish earthquakes from<br />
nuclear explsions underground. We are able to reveal that that's<br />
what it did and it's because it's able to do that that the<br />
United States is confidently working towards a comprehensive<br />
nuclear treaty to ban it all. Now, nobody now would say that<br />
these were not valuable. They were valuable. We ought to be<br />
supporting it. And we have promptly ratified every nuclear<br />
treaty which has ever been made. Our opponents had to drag<br />
the chain. We had the conflict. But about those two things,<br />
nobody could learn. They now know what they were for, and<br />
nobody would object to them. They've helped to remove the<br />
spectre of nuclear war from the face of the earth and they<br />
could be effectively done from our part of the hemisphere.<br />
Now the next two things are secret. One is at Pine Gap<br />
near Alice Springs, one is at Nurunga near Woomera. I<br />
emphasise that they are not part of weapons systems. They<br />
can not be used to make war on any country, and the Ministers<br />
whose job it is Foreign Affairs, Defence, Barnard, myself,<br />
Willesee and Bishop all have verified that fact. We know<br />
what goes on there. It's not our secret. One goes till<br />
1976, one goes till 1979. They are expressed in the ANZUS<br />
context. I repeat they are not part of weapons systems.<br />
They can not be used to make war on any country. We can not<br />
disclose any more about their purposes because they're not<br />
our secrets. But ladies and gentlemen, what we want to<br />
recognise is this: that if we seek to govern this country,<br />
the people are entitled to believe that we will do it<br />
responsibly. </p>
<p>We never told the people at the elections that we<br />
would disclose other countries' secrets if we knew them.<br />
We never told the people that we'd break agreements that<br />
went into 1976 or 1979 and we knew this. These were public<br />
documents. Anybody can get copies of the Treaty.<br />
Now you can't now say to people that you'll break<br />
them. We didn't seek a mandate on that. But I urge you if you<br />
want to know more about these, read what Barnard has said after<br />
the discussion in Cabinet and Caucus. Don't go on subsequent<br />
glosses about it. Read what was said. What the Cabinet and<br />
Caucus heard. Then there's a final one, and that's the North West<br />
Cape. Because Australia and the United States entered into<br />
correspondence which said that the Australian Government<br />
had no right to know the messages that went through, we<br />
don't know.* We are determined to find out. The agreement<br />
goes to 1988. But Barnard has said on behalf of the Cabinet<br />
and the Caucus in the Parliament that he will make it this<br />
year we would be negotiating that. We would never have<br />
kept the silly secrecy that there was about the original<br />
thing in Alice Springs the nuclear atmospheric one, or the<br />
silly secrecy about the Amberley one the nuclear underground.<br />
You now know. I can assure you that when in due course it's<br />
regarded as proper to release the information as to what is<br />
done at Pine Gap and Nurunga, you will find it just as acceptable<br />
as you now find what's been done at the old one at Alice Springs<br />
or at Amberley. Then you say that helps to see that the great<br />
powers don't have this ignorance of suspicion of each other which<br />
leads to wars. Because the wars that have taken place this<br />
century have been due to the ignorance of rival powers upon each<br />
other's doing. It's been due to the over-reaction of what great<br />
powers have committed themselves to in ignorance and suspicion<br />
of their rivals. These ones there will allay the suspicion<br />
and remove the ignorance.<br />
The North West Cape is unsatisfactory. No self-respecting<br />
Government should ever have entered into it. No Government in<br />
the world would now enter into such an arrangement. And it's only<br />
fair to give us the opportunity when the Parliament gets up to<br />
negotiate with the Americans to do a proper contemporary thing.<br />
But believe me, we are determined to see in the terms of the<br />
Party Platform that Australia will not be party into undertaking<br />
or entering upon a war without knowing what it's all about and<br />
how it's being done.<br />
We have said through the conferences in the past that<br />
members of Parliament in Australia should have just as much<br />
right to see these things a's United States congressmen and that<br />
has already been conceded it has been agreed there's no<br />
difficulty about that. We achieved that promptly by putting<br />
our cards on the table and it was seen to be reasonable.<br />
Now don't blame the yanks for everything you don't like in this<br />
country. It's not their fault that go many of our companies<br />
and cattle stations are being bought overseas by them. It's<br />
the fault of our predecessors. Don't blame the Republicans<br />
and the Democrats for what the Liberals did. </p>
<p>Now I'll hurry on to some of the other things here.<br />
If things are capable of being done by Federal administrative<br />
action we've already acted because already there's been a very<br />
great deal done to transform the social security systems of<br />
Australia. We already, before Christmas, set up the Interim<br />
Schools Commission which will make its report before the end<br />
of may which will, we expect, be put into force in; tie coming<br />
bcudget and which, with the co-operation of the States, to which<br />
we've written, will mean that the Commonwealth can take over<br />
in the terms of the Party Platform, in the terms of the policy<br />
speech, in the terms of Sir Paul's opening address to the<br />
Parliament, will enable the Commonwealth to assume the<br />
responsibility for planning and financing tertiary education<br />
in Australia on the condition that the money so saved is spent<br />
on other forms of education. It can all be done this year.<br />
As far as we are concerned the report from the Committee which<br />
I set up when I was Minister for Education in the thirteen<br />
days before Christmas will be received before the end of May,<br />
and with the co-operation of the States it will all be fully<br />
implemented in the next scholastic year.<br />
Some of these things involve legislation. It takes a<br />
bit longer to get legislation but we are resolved to see that<br />
our legislation will be in the terms of the mandate we sought<br />
and which we got. Then the remaining thing is of course the<br />
things which have to be done by co-operation with the States.<br />
Things where the Commonwealth can't do it single-handed.<br />
Admittedly, where international affairs are concerned the<br />
Australian Government the national Government is the only<br />
one which has any standing at all. Nobody could have acted<br />
more promptly and fully than we did then. And when there are<br />
administrative things, such as discharging prisoners or<br />
discontinuing prosecutions or entering the draft, we did them<br />
promptly immediately. We've already brought in the first<br />
three weeks of this new Parliament more bills than any Government<br />
has ever brought in federally in such a period all within the<br />
terms of our mandate. We believe they should go through the<br />
Parliament. If any of them are stalled, there's no question<br />
what the public response will be when we put them to the people<br />
at the Senate elections whether or not that is the whole of<br />
the Senate or whether it is jointly with another House of<br />
Representatives election.<br />
You in this State have the great opportunity within the<br />
next couple of months to have a State election and there are so<br />
many things that we can only do by co-operation with the States.<br />
If you want to do anything about the use and the cost of land,<br />
if you want to do anything about public transport, if you want<br />
to do anything about the environment, or the national estate<br />
in general, the federal people can't do it single'handed.<br />
The State people can't do it single'handed. We don't have,<br />
federally, many of the constitutional powers, State governments<br />
don't have financially many of the necessary powers, but between<br />
us we could do any of these things. Now your great opportunity<br />
in a couple of months is to elect a State Labor Government<br />
again. </p>
<p>I've known Clyde Holding for many years. I've worked<br />
with him constantly. There's never a week goes by but we are<br />
in touch with each other and I can assure you that if you want<br />
an effective administration of this nation, of this city,<br />
the only certain way to get it is to have a federal Government<br />
and a State Government which without any inhibitions will<br />
carry out a joint program. Governments, Federal and State,<br />
which are both committed to the Platform of the Australian<br />
Labor Party. I didn't seek a mandate on anything which is<br />
not there. We got a mandate for things that are in there.<br />
I know we will not seek a mandate for anything which isn't<br />
in there, and it will all be in there, the lot of it will be<br />
in his program, between us without division, we will co-operate<br />
in seeing that this Platform is fulfilled. That's where we seek<br />
a mandate. That's the mandate we can expect to get. Now,<br />
the public, in the Victorian elections, will vote for Labor<br />
candidates if they believe that the Labor Party will discharge<br />
the mandate it seeks promptly and fully and that the Party<br />
will back it. Now we've carried out the mandate that we<br />
sought federally. I believe we are entitled to get the<br />
support of this great assembly, the most representative gathering<br />
of any political party in any State in Australia, and I believe<br />
if we get that backing for the mandate we sought and got and<br />
are discharging, that is the best hope of seeing that you have<br />
success in the Mtate elections. The Party backs its Government.<br />
That Government discharges its mandate.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Clyde Holding and I, and our<br />
colleagues between us seek a mandate consistent with the<br />
Party Platform. We have shown federally that fully and<br />
promptly we will discharge that mandate. That's why the<br />
public are supporting the Party federally. I believe that<br />
the public of Victoria are entitled to a reassurance that the<br />
Labor Party will back the Government for which it works<br />
the Governments for which the public gave a mandate. In that<br />
way, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of your next assembly<br />
you can not only have the Prime Minister and his Ministers but you<br />
can have once again a Premier and a Labor Ministry as well. </p>
