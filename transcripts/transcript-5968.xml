PRESS RELEASE<br />
Address by the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. J. D. Anthony,<br />
to a meeting of the Economic Advisory Committee of<br />
the Liberal Party of Australia,' at the Liberal Party Federal<br />
Secretariat, Canberra, Friday 19 November 1982.<br />
I suppose it was predictable that the first reaction of many<br />
people to the Government's proposal for a wage pause has been to<br />
ask, if wages are going to be frozen, why shouldn't prices be<br />
frozen as well. This reaction is predictable, and even<br />
understandable. Those who ask this question, however, must<br />
recognise that it has not been price increases, but excessive<br />
wage increases, which have been destroying jobs over recent<br />
months. Because domestic demand is weak and the world economy has<br />
become increasingly competitive, many businesses have not been<br />
able to put up prices enough to cover increases in costs, and<br />
have been forced to retrench staff.<br />
Freezing prices now would just lock industry in to this<br />
depressed profitability which is forcing the shedding of<br />
labour. That would not reduce unemployment. It would increase<br />
it. The squeeze on profits has, of course, been the result of a<br />
combination of factor's. The world economy is in recession. Real<br />
gross national product in the OECD counts is expected to actually<br />
fall this year, * and unemployment has climbed. It is now over 13<br />
percent in the United Kingdom, 12 percent in Canada and<br />
percent in the United States.<br />
The value of world trade fell last year for the first time<br />
in 20 years, and remains stagnant. Protectionism is growing.<br />
Commodity prices are weak. Real interest rates are high worldwide.<br />
For a time, we were insulated from the recession by<br />
resource-related growth. It has now hit us, and excessive wage<br />
increases made that a double blow. Those who have recently<br />
become unemployed are paying the price.<br />
Wage increases are the one factor making unemployment worse<br />
which we as a nation can, if we have the will, do something<br />
effective about.<br />
Some of the comments on the Government's initiative imply<br />
that until now we had done nothing about unemployment. I find<br />
that sort of comment extraordinary. Step by step, throughout<br />
this year, the Government has put in place a framework of<br />
measures to deal with the emerging economic sitution.<br />
I was very disappointed to read an editorial in the Sydney<br />
Morning Herald on Tuesday, which said, in part, that although the<br />
Government thought that the drought justified an addition of $ 350 </p>
<p>million to the Budget deficit, it did not feel that unemployment<br />
justified the addition of one per cent to the deficit. That is<br />
very unfair comment. It ignores the obvious fact that increased<br />
unemployment benefit payments will boost the deficit by a similar<br />
amount to the drought relief payments and for a similar<br />
purpose, to relieve hardship. It also completely ignores the<br />
many measures the Government took in the Budget and before the<br />
Budget to deal with the worsening economic situation.<br />
It is true that unemployment has increased even more than<br />
was anticipated before the Budget. The Government's present<br />
initiative recognises that, and builds on the medsures already<br />
taken. In March, we brought in a major housing package, designed to<br />
give real assistance to the housing industry, to those seeking to<br />
build homes and to families struggling with their mortgage<br />
repayments. In June, at the Premiers' Conference, we gave an<br />
increase of more than 16 per cent in tax-sharing funds to the<br />
States, and an even larger increase, of 21 per cent, in funds for<br />
local government. At the Loan Council we provided a 10 per cent<br />
increase in State Government borrowing programs, including a<br />
substantial extra allocation for welfare housing. Borrowings by<br />
electricity authorities were freed of restrictions, and we agreed<br />
to an increase of 14 per cent in the programs of other semigovernment<br />
authorities. Those decisions helped make possible<br />
major increases in capital works now in train throughout the<br />
country. In July, we brought in a special package of fiscal measures<br />
to assist industry. The final steps came in the August Budget,<br />
where we concentrated heavily on measures to help cushion the<br />
effects of the difficult economic circumstances which we knew<br />
were facing the country.<br />
The Budget provided'income tax cuts worth $ 1.5 billion in<br />
1982-83. It provided higher family allowances and other major<br />
measures of income support, and a new housing interest rebate<br />
scheme complementing the March package. Most of these measures<br />
are now coming into effect, from 1 November. They are directed<br />
particularly to those likely to be facing harship: those on<br />
lower incomes; families, particularly families struggling to meet<br />
mortgage repayments; pensioners and the unemployed.<br />
Those measures of tax relief and income support<br />
significantly increase the disposable incomes of ordinary working<br />
people and so lay a firm basis for wage restraint. A typical<br />
breadwinner will be receiving benefits of about $ 20 a week, or<br />
around $ 17 after taking account of the indirect tax increases.<br />
That is equivalent to a wage increase before tax of eight or nine<br />
per cent a valuable boost to family incomes, by any standards.<br />
That is a solid basis on which we have called on every<br />
Australian who has a job to sacrifice a future wage increase to </p>
<p>help save the jobs of others and perhaps even his or her own<br />
job. The Budget contained a range of other measures designed to<br />
help employment, including a major expansion of capital works<br />
funding, more money for aged persons' accommodation, welfare<br />
housing, roads and airports. In total, * the Budget provided over<br />
$ 4 billion for capital purposes an increase of 17 per cent on<br />
last year. And to help those seeking jobs, we increased funds<br />
for manpower and training programs by 21 per cent to $ 250<br />
million. Yet the Sydney Morning Herald says we are not willing to<br />
provide one extra cent to relieve unemployment! I think the<br />
facts I have outlined show how shallow this response is.<br />
We are doing all we can, and not only at home. We are<br />
making a significant contribution to helping find ways out of the<br />
world recession. The whole reason for the initiative I will be<br />
pursuing in Geneva next week at the GATT Ministerial meeting is<br />
to try to stimulate world trade. For a country like ours, so<br />
dependent on trade for growth and prosperity, that is absolutely<br />
essential if our industries are to get moving strongly again.<br />
Returning to the initiative which the Government has<br />
launched this week, by inviting the Premiers to come to Canberra<br />
on 7 December to discuss a proposal for a wage pause, I'd like to<br />
make it absolutely clear why we are focussing on wages.<br />
The plain fact is that wage increases have gravely<br />
aggravated our problems, just at a time when we should have been<br />
preparing to meet the tougher climate of a recession. The<br />
economy is now feeling the effects of an extraordinarily badlytimed<br />
major push in wages. That push was spearheaded by a metal<br />
trades package which, taking account of reduced hours, was<br />
equivalent to an increase of over 20 per cent in wages.<br />
The push spread widely. Over the year to the September<br />
quarter, average weekly ordinary time earnings of adult males<br />
employed full-time rose by 18.2 per cent and this does not take<br />
account of reductions in standard hours. That means wages rose<br />
per cent faster than prices over the year to the September<br />
quarter. To put it another way, real wages rose by over five per<br />
cent, more than 10 times the increase of only 0.4 per cent in<br />
non-farm productivity over the most recent 12 months recorded.<br />
Our international competitiveness was severely affected.<br />
Businesses have not been able to pass on the cost increases and<br />
have been forced to retrench staff. In the OECD over the latest<br />
12 months ( to May), the average wages increase was 10.7 per cent<br />
and falling. That compares with our 18.2 per cent to September.<br />
We can contribute to efforts to find solutions to the<br />
international problems, but of course we cannot do much about </p>
<p>4.<br />
them directly. Nor do we have any " magic wand" which will get us<br />
rapidly out of our own difficulties. But I repeat what I said<br />
earlier: the wages front is where we do have a weapon in our own<br />
hands, if only we have the courage and the will to use it.<br />
This is a weapon which cannot be wielded effectively unless<br />
there is a broad consensus behind it. The Government earnestly<br />
hopes that the States will join us in helping to lead this<br />
consensus, which must extend right throughout the community.<br />
I cannot stress too strongly that the essence of the<br />
proposal, and the key to its success in saving jobs, is that it<br />
should put in place an effective economy-wide pause in wages.<br />
Spending the savings we will make in public wages on employmentrelated<br />
activities will be a supplement to that, certainly but<br />
the thrust of the proposal is the wage pause.<br />
It is not easy for a Government to ask the community to make<br />
sacrifices. But that is precisely what the Government is now<br />
doing. We cannot the nation cannot effectively tackle<br />
unemployment without cost.<br />
We want those who have jobs, who have mostly received<br />
substantial wage increases and will all receive substantial<br />
further support from the Budget, to sacrifice a future wage<br />
increase to help save their own jobs, and help restore jobs for<br />
those now out of work.<br />
If the community is not prepared to make that sacrifice, the<br />
outlook for many thousands of Australians is a bleak one indeed.<br />
We know the course we propose is a hard one. It will be<br />
strongly opposed. We know similar efforts have failed before.<br />
But things are much more serious now than they were then, and I<br />
believe there is a mood in the community to face up to difficult<br />
choices. Speaking here to people representing the business sector, I<br />
urge your full commitment to the Government's proposal. The<br />
Government looks to the whole private sector to join with the<br />
public sector in making this proposal work, and securing the<br />
benefits it is designed to bring. </p>
