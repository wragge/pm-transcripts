    <content><![CDATA[<p>BROWN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, first to a domestic issue, Bruce Baird says that Singapore Airlines should be told that the impending execution of Mr Van Nguyen will be a factor in their request to fly from the Australian mainland to the West Coast of the USA. What do you say to that kind of appeal for that sort of pressure?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't support linking the two things and they won't be linked. That would not be in Australia's interests, it would not be good policy. The Singapore Airlines issue is a separate issue. As I think most Australians know, I'm a strong supporter of Qantas, that doesn't mean to say that there isn't a case, in certain circumstances at some time for some changes, but I would not seek to make the link. I don't think that is good policy.</p>
<p>BROWN:</p>
<p>Mr Baird says while he's alive there's still hope. Have you lost hope?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe that the Singapore Government will go ahead with the execution. I do not believe that what is now being said is going to make any difference. I'm sorry to have to say that, but whilst I would like to believe otherwise, in a sense it's being unfair and cruel to the family of the poor man to pretend, when we know that on all the objective criteria, the Government is not going to change its mind.</p>
<p>BROWN:</p>
<p>On the subject of your visit to the Australian troops serving here in Pakistan, you've seen the rugged terrain, you've seen the really serious difficulties with access to that quake zone. When their mission runs out in three months time, would you consider keeping some helicopters on or replacing the Australian helicopters that are so vital to that mission?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a judgment to be made at the time on the advice that we have and what is put to us by the Pakistani authorities. They're only in the early days of their mission, they're doing wonderful work. They're treating 150 people a day, and the morale of the locals has been greatly lifted and they are really doing wonderful humanitarian work. As to what happens in under three months time, I'd have to talk about that when that time comes.</p>
<p>BROWN:</p>
<p>Winter's about to really set in there. How do you think that mission's going to change? How will it get more difficult or how will it be affected by the onset of winter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the onset of winter will mean that people living in the mountains, in the hills, not necessarily in the valley, will be snowed in. I'm sure that their experience will mean that they will be able to handle that. The Pakistani authorities indicated to me that they have got adequate forward provisions of food and blankets and tents to help the people through the most difficult part of the winter. The valuable thing about the medical mission from Australia is that its whereabouts and presence is well known, and people are walking miles a day, some people, four and five hours a day carrying children, in order to get treatment.</p>
<p>BROWN:</p>
<p> You've praised Pakistan for its role in the War on Terror. Islamist militant groups like Lashkar-e-Toiba have trained in Pakistan, trained in territory controlled by the Pakistani military and they have allegedly trained people who have traveled to Australia intent on killing Australians. Are you satisfied that enough has been done to stop that sort of thing from happening?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they were issues that I discussed with both President Musharraf and also the Prime Minister and, you know, in a large country, you can't assert everything is 100 per cent in a country that has had a history of tribalism and a history of violence and a history of terrorism. But I am more than satisfied that the Government of President Musharraf is doing all it can, given the history and the nature and culture of the country, to suppress terrorism. And the best test of all is the extraordinary personal risks he himself takes every day. Unlike me, he has been subject to a number of assassination attempts. The success of the moderate Islam, which Musharraf espouses and practices, is very important in itself in fighting terrorism.</p>
<p>BROWN:</p>
<p> To finish on a domestic issue, on your leadership of the Liberal Party and currently the country, do you accept that you should decide on your future before the Treasurer delivers his next Budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will do what I said I would do in 2003 when I said I'd continue as Leader of the Party. I said that I'd remain Leader of the Party so long as the Party wanted me to and it was in the best interests of the Party that I should do so and nothing has changed.</p>
<p>BROWN:</p>
<p>It remains in the best interests of the party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they are things that are assessed by the Party and by me and I have a job to do and I intend to go on doing it.</p>
<p>BROWN:</p>
<p>It can't have escaped the attention of some of those in the Party who would like to see a transition that you appear at the top of your game. You appear full of energy and you are still loving the job as much as ever.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, the position on the leadership is as I have described it. Of course I am fit and of course I'm committed. That's what I owe the Australian people, they are entitled to have 200 per cent from me while ever I am in this job.</p>
