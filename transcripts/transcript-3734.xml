PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE WILSON q<br />
CHANNEL 7<br />
TAHITI 11/ 5/ 75 FOR REPLAY 12/ 5/ 75<br />
Question : In general terms, what was the most significant<br />
single thing about this trip as far as you are concerned?<br />
Mr. Whitlam : I wouldn't like to dramatise it in the terms<br />
of any-one particular thing. There were two important things<br />
we did; one was to have the far-ranging, frank exchange of<br />
views at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Jamaica,<br />
and the second one was to have a pretty thorough round-up of<br />
views, exchange of views, in Washington with the Administration<br />
and with the Congress. I wouldn't choose which was the more<br />
important of those two.<br />
Question As far as Jamaica went, there was some suggestion,<br />
some criticism that perhaps you adopted a slightly lower profile<br />
than you would have wanted to and perhaps you should have. I'm<br />
obviously referring to the Vietnam question. Why was it that you<br />
didn't push it a little stronger there?<br />
Mr. Whitlam : What we are intent on doing, of course, at the<br />
Commonwealth, is to discuss those things which interest a fair<br />
number of us. Now I did point out, quite briefly, and everyone<br />
immediately accepted the proposition, that on Vietnam which was<br />
obviously a land-mark in world history, we ought to express the<br />
view that nations should con-tribute as much as they can to the<br />
reconstruction and rehabilitation of that country and to bring<br />
it into the community of nations. I raised that, and in fact<br />
it was raised by Mrs. Gandhi and Mr. Lee Kuan Yew in the general<br />
discussion on world and Commonwealth trends and then I later made<br />
the point that there should be a reference to it in the communique<br />
and there was. There was no dispute about it, so it didn't need<br />
to take up very much time. I have seen some suggestions that we<br />
ought to have spent more time on it, or I should have. I don't<br />
see any basis for that. There was no need to spend more time on<br />
this. There were some aspects of Vietnam, such as refugees, which<br />
of course, I did mention to, I suppose half a dozen Heads of Government<br />
there who were interested in these matters New Zealand, Fiji,<br />
Britain, Canada, Singapore and Malaysia.<br />
Question : Of course later with President Ford, this was a major<br />
point of discussion.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: What was a major point?<br />
Question : Vietnam in general, Indo-China of course.<br />
Mr. Whitlam In the general, regional set-up, in the aftermath<br />
of Vietnam, obviously. This was quite an important thing, not<br />
only with the President and the Secretary of State, Dr. Kissinger,<br />
and Deputy Secretary and Assistant Secretaries of State, but also<br />
of course, with the two Houses in Congress. </p>
<p>Question: You said in Washington that as regards reconstruction<br />
there, you weren't going -to shirk your responsibility. We would<br />
be a ready and willing partner to the U. S. Exactly what will we<br />
be doing as regards reconstruction?<br />
Mr. Whitlam In the budget for the financial year which is now<br />
expiring, we made provision, and I think we did in the previous<br />
budget, for reconstruction and rehabilitation in Vietnam, both<br />
South and North. I think we spent about five times as much in<br />
the South as in the North because it's taken longer to get the<br />
structure of reconstruction going in the North. They have not<br />
been accustomed to getting it and they've been a bit suspicious<br />
of international organisations through which we prefer to inake<br />
our contribution. Now, the United States is not likely to make<br />
as big a contribution to these matters because of her recent<br />
experiences * Lhere, but obviously countries like Australia, which<br />
are in a position to contribute, should do so.<br />
Question : Would you Place any sort of time period on reconstruction?<br />
Would we be looking at that sort of thing?<br />
Mr. Whitlam : I wouldn't like to say. I mean what do you mean<br />
by reconstruction?<br />
Question Do we presume that we will provide funds for reconstruction<br />
for the next five years or the next fifteen years or can't you<br />
set a time?<br />
Mr. Whitlam I'd say five's more likely. Because if one thing<br />
is clear, it is the astonishing resilience of the Vietnamese people.<br />
They have had a bigger battering for a longer period, than any<br />
nation in modern times. You would have to go back hundreds of<br />
years before you could think of any nation which has been so<br />
battered or so bruised or even brutalised as the people of Vietnam.<br />
But they have shown an amazing resilience, astonishing, and they<br />
will come through this. They are after all, a nation which has a<br />
very considerable history of identity and they've been willing to<br />
fight against people who wanted to buy into their affairs. They<br />
did it against the Chinese before last century, they did it against<br />
the French in the end of last century and the first half of this.<br />
Question : Do you foresee a period of real stability now in the<br />
Indo-China region?<br />
Mr. Whitlam I'm reasonably optimistic that the energies of<br />
the Vietnamese will be devoted to reconstructing their country.<br />
Question You say you are reasonably optimistic. Can you see<br />
anything going wrong? </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam : It's obvious that things can go wrong. The<br />
astonishing thing is that all the Heads of Government in<br />
countries which are concerned I've seen -them all for hours<br />
at a time in the last six weeks for instance, President Suharto<br />
came downm to Australia and spent a few days with me and then in<br />
the last couple of weeks in Jamaica, I've been with the Prime<br />
Ministers of Malaysia, Singapore and other countries further away,<br />
such as New Zealand of course and Britain, we have discussed all<br />
these matters as well as in North America.<br />
Question : If I might move on now to the question of refugees.<br />
Where do we stand now on the question of accepting adult refugees<br />
from Vietnam?<br />
Mr. Whitlam : The situation has changed quite clearly from the<br />
time when we set out together from Australia because at that time<br />
there was still a Government in office in South Vietnam and whatever<br />
one did in those circumstances had to be done with the concurrence<br />
of that Government. % Well the Government i~ s now defunct and -there<br />
are tens of thousands of refugees who have fled from the country,<br />
so there's obviously a different situation now.<br />
Question : That means we will be accepting them given some<br />
international programme?<br />
Mr. Whitlam : Yes. There has been, for many years of course,<br />
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees organisationan<br />
experienced, a respected body-and we have in all our programmes<br />
for refugees active through that body and that is the sensible,<br />
the humane, the effective way -to work now. We were among the first<br />
to invite the UNHCR to come into this question and we have already<br />
this financial year contributed millions of dollars to his programmes.<br />
Question : When will we work out just how many we are going to<br />
take?<br />
Mr. Whitlam : This will be a matter of international arrangement<br />
clearly. It might be some weeks before one could make any responsible<br />
estiwa. te of such matters.<br />
Question How quickly would you like to see these refugees<br />
catered for? In other words, how quickly do you think we might<br />
see them in Australia?<br />
Mr. Whitlam : Well, obviously, the sooner the better, as long 1<br />
as it can be done effectively or humanely. You want to upset<br />
people as little as possible, you want to settle them down as<br />
quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Question: Would you expect any sort of backlash for this<br />
idea of allowing adult refugees into Australia?<br />
Mr. Whitlam : I don't think we can overlook the fact that<br />
there will be some resentment about people coming into Australia<br />
at a time of unemployment and also people from a very different<br />
way of life, many of them not speaking English for instance.<br />
Now obviously there will be doubts or even resentment among<br />
Australians in this respect and I suppose it was a bit disappointing<br />
that Australians didn't contribute more generously to the fund<br />
which was set up for these matters. But nevertheless, Governments<br />
have to do the right thing whether it's popular or not, so we<br />
will be taking a fair share of refugees under the auspices of<br />
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees the body<br />
which has most experience in this matter, the body which has<br />
done the job best.<br />
Question Do you think that perhaps your whole visit has been<br />
overshadowed by domestic events? Does that disappoint you?<br />
Mr. Whitlam I wouldn't think so. I don't know what you can<br />
suggest. I naturally think that what I was doing was of greatest<br />
importance to the country. The Commonwealth of Nations is an<br />
important body. There are three-dozen of us almost in it and<br />
there is no organisation where the countries of the Indian Ocean<br />
can get together as they can in the Commonwealth and it is also<br />
a valuable body for the countries of the South Pacific. Australia,<br />
really through the Commonwealth, has better assocations with her<br />
neighbours to west and east than through any other organisation.<br />
Then, of course, there was the very timely opportunity to have<br />
an exchange of views with the United States Administration and<br />
Congress at a time when there have been some very big changes<br />
in the world.<br />
Question: You go back to Australia happy with the past two<br />
weeks with no qualms about the coming fortnight?<br />
Mr. Whitlam Of course not. I'm quite content with what we<br />
have been able to do while we have been away. </p>
