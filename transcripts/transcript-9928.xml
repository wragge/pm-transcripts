TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARUAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
28 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: I'll just open up with a few introductory remarks and then let you ask some<br />
questions. There is a hint in the commentary now that now the Government<br />
has got the Australian economy in pretty good shape, it is growing quite<br />
strongly, as you know stronger than, I think, any other western economy.<br />
That it has got very strong job growth, three quarters of a million jobs since<br />
the last election. We have got low inflation with the underlying inflation rate<br />
at around three per cent. So, there is a hint from the commentators that the<br />
public have got now a bit are in a position to make a choice. The hint<br />
being a bit of a cavalier one saying well, now the Government has got us in<br />
this good position, you can sit back and make a choice about where you<br />
want to go now.<br />
The point of much of what I said in the advertisement, which will be run on<br />
the ABC, is to say that we have got a remarkable opportunity, but now is the<br />
time to consolidate it. The point I made yesterday at the opening press<br />
conference of this campaign, that is, no other country, no other nation has<br />
been invested with a continent. We are in the lucky position of sharing a<br />
border with no one, but we will have to unlock the opportunities ourselves. I<br />
made the point that no one out there is against us, but no one out there is<br />
especially for us. We are on our own and we will have to behave as if we<br />
are on our own. That means making every post a winner in terms of<br />
domestic cohesion, in terms of competitiveness, in terms of the environment,<br />
in terms of making the connection with Asia, in terms of unlocking markets,<br />
in terms of building free trade structures in the region, in terms of our<br />
strategic arrangements, in terms of our people to people contacts and that<br />
now is not the time to go back and hanker for some other period when we<br />
had the economy managed on a conflict basis where the so called ruling<br />
group managed by press statement, where our trade arguments were to be<br />
had in the OECD and our strategic conversation exclusively with north<br />
America. These are all very much the symptoms of the view that the<br />
Coalition took in the past.<br />
Now, we have come a long way. In the last three years the economy is well<br />
and truly up and running. The fact that we have been having growth<br />
between six per cent and three per cent and we have kept inflation between<br />
one and three per cent is something the Coalition is incapable of. They have<br />
proved that it is not simply a claim by me. They have proved that in their<br />
seven years of office with high inflation and high unemployment and that this </p>
<p>is an era full of promise for Australia. We are living at the foot of the fastest<br />
growing markets in the world. We have now got a much more highly<br />
educated workforce than we have ever had and we have the added<br />
opportunity of being able to build the country in our own image and put the<br />
premium we wish on the environment. So, we do not just have a good<br />
economic life, but we enjoy all of the bounties of nature that it can offer us.<br />
In other words, we take the full opportunity of the position we are in, but it<br />
has to be consolidated. It is not just going to happen. The inflation rate is<br />
not just going to stay there. The growth won't just there, it is not there by<br />
accident. The employment growth, three times the average rate per year<br />
under the Labor Government than under the Coalition is not there by<br />
accident. The trade relationships with Asia are not there by accident. The<br />
security treaty with Indonesia is not there by accident. APEC is not there by<br />
accident. It is there by design and it is there by design from a competent<br />
government which has taken its mandate seriously and had the imagination<br />
and the courage to get these things done.<br />
I don't think now is the time for any commentator to give the view, well look,<br />
we are really in a pretty good economic position. We now have the luxury of<br />
some sort of caviller choice because the Coalition has no strategy. It has no<br />
coherent philosophy. Mr Howard has had a year in this term as Opposition<br />
leader to give all of you a coherent philosophy and he hasn't. The headland<br />
speechtis have all been flops, every one of them. There has been no policy<br />
detail and as a consequence the notion that they are prepared, he said<br />
yesterday that they were in a position, they had the solutions. Well, he could<br />
have fooled me. I haven't seen the policies or the solutions. He said they<br />
had the drive again, I'm sure it would have escaped all of you in the press<br />
gallery, where the drive was and the team. So, instead of having Kim<br />
Beazley out there, he would have Tim Fischer. Instead of having Gareth<br />
Evans in foreign policy, we would have Alexander Downer. Instead of<br />
having Ralph Willis, we would have Mr Costello. This is not an election for<br />
other than the consolidation of Australia's best interests. And there is only<br />
one way that's going to happen, a further mandate for the government. I'd<br />
be glad to take questions.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you start this election behind by almost a record margin.<br />
PM: Last time I think we started 12 points behind, supposedly.<br />
J: Well, why do you think you are so far behind given all of the things that you<br />
are spelling out to us now, which you claim are positive achievements of the<br />
Government?<br />
PM: Again, I think, the polls as a number of commentators are now agreeing, give<br />
people the opportunity to put some pressure on the government. I don't<br />
think they are an accurate reflection of public opinion, that the weight really<br />
comes on when people have to make a choice and I think that will happen<br />
again.<br />
J: Andrew Robb criicised you for attacking John Howard on a personal basis.<br />
In this second ad here certainly reflects that, what is your reaction to that?<br />
PM: John Howard said yesterday in his opening statement, that I was<br />
untrustworthy. In his opening press statement that I was untrustworthy. He<br />
has called me a liar almost every off day in the last 12. months. As you<br />
know, he has Senator Baume sitting in the Senate every day attacking me </p>
<p>and my private life. I have never engaged in these things and I don't need<br />
to, but the references to me yesterday explicitly being untrustworthy, I think,<br />
need to be picked up and understood. I made no such references to him.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the line in the commercial where the person says that they<br />
may not like you, but at least they trust you is that recognition by you that<br />
you accept that Australian's don't necessarily like you?<br />
PM: Well, John Howard got down to 18 per cent. Remember that famous cover<br />
in The Bulletin Why Does This Man Bother, Mr 18%. On that basis, 82 per<br />
cent of the public presumably didn't like him. I just think anyone who goes<br />
through a long public life like I have or like John Howard has, having the<br />
community say yippee thank goodness we have got them, really! I mean<br />
really, is that what you expect?<br />
J: Nevertheless given it is a very negative line put about you in an ad, what is<br />
the rationale?<br />
PM: The rationale is, I think, to make very clear that Australia has got this far with<br />
leadership, commitment, passion, energy. The very things that John Howard<br />
and his Coalition don't have. That is what the point of it is. In other words, if<br />
you want to keep the great change going, that is the fact that Australia is<br />
now a. completely different country for the better than it was from the<br />
industial archaeology of the early 1980s, of our declining competitiveness,<br />
of the fact that we were no where in Asia, that we had virtually little standing<br />
in the world anywhere and that we are now a competitive outward looking<br />
place with huge growth in exports and elaborately transformed things. In<br />
other words, very much a country and a society completely different than<br />
that which we had, that it has come by leadership. It has come by horse<br />
power. It has come by belief. It has come by passion. It has come by<br />
energy. You can call all that leadership. That is the point of the ad.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the emphasis on Asia and your push into Asia and opening<br />
Australia up to Asia, obviously it is the -key part of your pitch. Do you think<br />
ordinary Australians think about it, that they might share that desire, they are<br />
more concemned and would rather you were home here trying to get them<br />
jobs and certainly not inviting more Asians in to take their jobs, that kind of<br />
feeling.<br />
PM: The growth in Australia's exports since the great reformation of the economy<br />
in the 1980s is now employing one million Australians. There is one million<br />
extra jobs there because of the things the Government has done to make<br />
Australia competitive and to open up market opportunities. When you see<br />
the big Australian farms looking at the wheat markets of the world and<br />
seeing our grain prices harden and improve, that is going to continue as the<br />
Uruguay Round starts to pull back subsidies for grain exports. Market<br />
access is now what it is all about for us. When we say Asia, read two things,<br />
employment and jobs and engagement and security. Security in Asia, not<br />
security from Asia which is the view of the Coalition.<br />
J: John Howard said this morning that there is no law against changing your<br />
mind In politics and that in fact it can be a sign of strength to reassess what<br />
you think. Given that the Labor Party has also changed its mind on some<br />
crucial policy issues over the past years, why shouldn't the Liberal Party be<br />
able to do so as well? </p>
<p>PM: Well, you would have to believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden to<br />
believe what the Liberal's are saying now on Medicare and on wages. After<br />
years of pressing huge declaratory statements, well lets go through just<br />
take 1995 on industrial relations. I will give you some quotations, Mr Howard<br />
is our role in areas like industrial relations which remains the great<br />
undone area of reform in the Australian economy" March 1995.<br />
Because of all of the things that remain to be done in Australia, none is more<br />
important than reforming Australia's old fashioned, out of date industrial<br />
relations system" April 1995. As you know, of all the issues I have been<br />
committed to over the last 10 years, none has been more important, none<br />
more prominent than my absolute commitment to the need to free Australia's<br />
industrial relations system and of all the on costs and above accrued wage<br />
costs, many of these are a direct function of our outdated industrial relations<br />
system", and above accrued wage costs, of course, is code for penalties and<br />
over time et cetera. He said that in July 1995. Not 1985, 1995. He went on<br />
to say on another occasion in the same month you don't even deserve to<br />
be taken seriously on the innovation and the futuristic stakes unless you are<br />
prepared to embrace the 21 st century industrial relations system". Then he<br />
said on 28 July 1995 it will come as no surprise that of all the unfinished<br />
business of economic reform in Australia, none is more important, none<br />
more blindingly in need of action than the area of industrial relations." And<br />
then finally in August he said it is imperative that we undertake<br />
fundamental reforms in industrial relations" to the Cattleman's Union on 28<br />
August' 1 995.<br />
That is a reflection. I could read quotes here for an hour stretching back to<br />
the early 1980s and then because he is advised by his pollsters to go out<br />
and say look, I didn't really mean all that, I'm just a cuddly small TIlib eral who<br />
will now no longer stand for any of those positions I have taken, I am making<br />
a new declaration and you now are required to believe that. The point is on<br />
that matter, John Howard is not entitled to be believed. Is it any wonder,<br />
have you seen any hand wringing from the Business Council or the ACCI<br />
because you know what the word around town is from them: " look, they are<br />
going to do it anyway, he just has to say things to get over the line".<br />
I know that, you all know that so why would you believe that we are going to<br />
accept Mr Howard's policy, but not the policies and philosophies he stood on<br />
for all those years. Or on Medicare, for instance, where he says the<br />
Medicare system is a total disaster. We'll pull it right apart. The second<br />
thing we will do is get rid of bulk billing, it is an absolute rort. The best thing<br />
we could do is to go back, back to pre-Medicare." There is an absolute feast<br />
of quotes. Medicare is a failure. " We will end bulk billing which is a<br />
scandalous waste of money" and it just goes on page after page. That has<br />
been his position. The Liberal Party position is to support private health.<br />
They believe in a private health system for the well-off which gives the<br />
incomes the specialists believe they deserve. That is what they have always<br />
stood for. That is what they still stand for. That is what they would do in<br />
office. So, are we to say after remember this John Howard has opposed every<br />
wage increase since 1987, bar two. He has opposed all the Medicare<br />
changes. A fair and decent industrial relations system and an umpire<br />
wouldn't be there if John Howard had his way. Medicare wouldn't be there if<br />
John Howard had his way. And you are not really asking us to say, at this<br />
point for the most shallow of political reasons because he wants to become<br />
a political chameleon and change his tune that I should after 13 years of<br />
my life fighting him on these things concede the point that he really wasn't </p>
<p>an opponent afterall. He was really in it with us and, of course, he never<br />
was.<br />
J: Prime Minister, there is a problem with health especially with the number of<br />
people dropping out to take private health insurance.<br />
PM: But, Nikki, look, I am not here to go through the whole campaign, the<br />
campaign manifesto, a discussion on the health scheme. I am here today to<br />
talk about, essentially, what the Labor Party and what I have said on behalf<br />
of the Party in that advertisement about the broader portents in the<br />
campaign. I am not here to fill up columns.<br />
J: Mr Keating, over the past several months you have announced several<br />
billion dollars worth of new spending initiatives. When are you going to tell<br />
us how you are going to pay for them?<br />
PM: Like we have done in every campaign. You will always know from us I<br />
mean dare I have the temerity to remind you that we have a surplus Budget.<br />
I know a mere bagatelle, I know.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the Liberal Party today is indicating that they would write to the<br />
Electoral Commission to put a halt to the distribution of statements like the<br />
multicultural statement and your environment statement, saying that it is now<br />
not authiorised election material. What is your reaction to that?<br />
PM: Look I haven't seen that at all. I haven't seen that.<br />
inaudible] on their behalf?<br />
PM: Look I would like to find out what they said before I respond to it.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you going to address health as an issue during the<br />
campaign?<br />
PM: Well you asked me that a minute ago, Nikki, and I gave you the answer.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what do you mean when you talk about consolidation? You<br />
have mentioned it yesterday and today. Do you mean that the pace of<br />
reform would slow down?<br />
PM: No, well look at the front we are moving on. In the middle 80s we had the<br />
worst terms of trade since the depression, our national income was<br />
dramatically cut, we were massively uncompetitive, we had double digit<br />
inflation and double digit unemployment thanks to Mr Howard. We had no<br />
position of substance in the traded goods sectors of Asia, other than the big<br />
bulk trades to Japan.<br />
Since that, and might I say we had three young people in ten completing<br />
secondary school. That is how much they cared about young people. Three<br />
young people in ten completed secondary school. That is now eight young<br />
people in ten and we have taken university places from 320,000 to 560,000.<br />
So we have now got a much more highly educated society. We are 40 per<br />
cent more competitive than we were then.<br />
Exports have gone from 13 per cent of GDP to 22 per cent an increase of<br />
9 per cent of GDP, or $ 45 billion a year. The fastest growing component of<br />
those exports is elaborately transformed goods. We have got a services </p>
<p>sector like we have never had before in tourism, in financial services, in<br />
education services, and the like. We are now relevant in the region around<br />
us. We now have bilateral and multilateral structures which this government<br />
has largely developed and that whole picture of promise, that integration,<br />
has to be completed.<br />
We have to establish the educational institutions like Monash which was up<br />
there last week with me in Malaysia or the University of Melbourne, or any<br />
of the other institutions which are going there of the great teaching hospitals,<br />
of the product markets, of wholesaling, of specialised products. Developing<br />
those things so that they count as assets for Australia forever, i. e.<br />
consolidation. In other words, you can't be driving along in top gear and then throw the car<br />
into neutral and just hope it might drift over the line. It is not going to drift<br />
over the line, it is going to stop. We are going to lose the momentum of it.<br />
It's going to go and what will go with it is, of course, the cooperation at home,<br />
the low inflation, the decent wage outcomes, and we will go back to the sort<br />
of conflict model that we had in the past.<br />
J: Mr Keating, [ inaudible] are you going to provide during the campaign<br />
details of how particular policies would be paid for, say offset the savings,<br />
and so -on?<br />
I<br />
PM: Michelle, I produced for the government, at one time or another,<br />
21 statements that is Budget reviews and May statements and<br />
Prime Ministerial statements, which all had those costings as part of them. I<br />
mean we have raised accountability and public financing to probably the<br />
highest point in the OECD. We publish estimates of outlays and receipts.<br />
We don't only publish estimates of outlays and receipt, we publish trends.<br />
When the Coalition, when John Howard was the Treasurer, he didn't even<br />
publish beyond the next years forward estimates and he never published<br />
them in receipts.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you see Australia's move towards a republic being part of this<br />
campaign particularly in enhancing our image in Asia?<br />
PM: Well I don't think the Liberals understand at all the strength of the Australian<br />
identity and it is one of the things I made clear in that advertisement. They<br />
don't see the importance of it to ourselves, to what we have become, to our<br />
esteem for ourselves, or our relevance and how we are viewed in the region<br />
around us, or in the world at large.<br />
And so anything that gives a further expression to our culture, to what we<br />
have become, to the sort of society we now are, will only make us stronger.<br />
And the republic, of course, is a central part of that.<br />
J: Mr Howard said that if in government he would reduce the uplift factor for<br />
provisional tax for small business. Does he have a valid point?<br />
PM: Oh well, that would have rated maybe half a line in a 3000 lines statement.<br />
That is not policy. That is just, simply, a technical point in the tax system.<br />
We have varied the uplift factor for provisional tax as the years have gone.<br />
Sometimes it has been ten, sometimes it has been eight, it depends what<br />
the economic conditions are. But let him not market that to you as policy<br />
and let you not be so gullible as to receive it as policy. </p>
<p>Policies are about where you go with fiscal policy, whether you have a<br />
cooperative incomes policy, how you then integrate that with monetary<br />
policy. That is what policy is. That is a detail and if he can occupy you to<br />
the point that you even ask a question about it, then I think you have got to<br />
look at his press statements a lot harder.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you concede that the blowout in foreign debt to $ 180 billion,<br />
the fact that there is still 750,000 Australians unemployed, and the fact that<br />
one third of young people who aren't in education or training can't find a job,<br />
that they are the factors that are going to weigh you down in this election<br />
campaign?<br />
PM: No, because for this reason. We have roughly the same population as The<br />
Netherlands, roughly. But you can drive across The Netherlands in about<br />
three hours. Three hours will take you from Sydney to Canberra.<br />
In this country, we have got 300 mile railway lines, the biggest in the world,<br />
the heaviest gauges in the world, four locomotives upfront, two at the back,<br />
one railway system after another through Western Australia, through<br />
Queensland. We have dams all over the country, we have major mining<br />
projects, we have major agricultural investments. These don't happen in<br />
countries of that size. They happen in a few isolated places. Australia<br />
happdrfs to be one of them. That is, we have a continent, but there is only<br />
18 million of us.<br />
If there were 260 million of us in a similar sized land mass as there is in the<br />
United States, we may have a savings base large enough to fund the capital<br />
requirements of that sort of country. We don't and even though we are<br />
trying very hard with superannuation and public savings, the chances are we<br />
will always need private investment. This is a good thing for Australia. A<br />
good thing for Australia that Australian companies can borrow abroad to<br />
develop Australia faster and the loans are forthcoming.<br />
The key matter is whether we can service them and as you know our<br />
servicing capacity has doubled doubled. I mean eight years ago 22 per<br />
cent of our export proceeds went to servicing our debt. Today it is 11 per<br />
cent and what is the Commonwealth's debt in all this, 5 per cent. It is largely<br />
private debt borrowed by private companies for good investments in a huge<br />
continent and that is why comparisons with OECD countries, like The<br />
Netherlands and that, are just way, way beyond the mark.<br />
J: Should there be a televised debate on health?<br />
PM: Well, at this point, John Howard and Andrew Robb have made clear well<br />
let me just make our position clear. I am prepared to join John Howard in<br />
two debates with a moderator in two debates managed by the Australian<br />
Broadcasting Corporation, with a moderator of their choice.<br />
They have written to the parties and have said their choice is Kerry O'Brien.<br />
Andrew Robb has told our Federal Secretary today that the Liberal Party he<br />
and John Howard won't have Kerry O'Brien and we are saying well look, as<br />
far as we are concerned, this is up to the ABC. If the ABC wish to nominate<br />
someone else, that is fine with us. But we want two debates and two<br />
debates between myself, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Beazley, and the<br />
Treasurer, Mr Willis, and another debate between myself, the Deputy Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Beazley and the Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, and their </p>
<p>counterparts who would be Mr Howard, Mr Fischer and Mr Costello; Mr<br />
Howard, Mr Fischer and Mr Downer.<br />
At this point, the Coalition have rejected that proposal. They have rejected<br />
that proposal. They have said they would only have a debate between<br />
Shadow Ministers because I think Mr Howard does not want to be seen<br />
sitting in company with Mr Fischer and Mr Downer.<br />
J: But considering that health is such an important issue and the decline in<br />
private health insurance and all that sort of stuff. Do you support a debate<br />
on health?<br />
PM: I don't think we have got time to debate every single issue. You could have<br />
one on health, Aboriginal policy. You could have one on all sorts of areas.<br />
Governments are run by a core group of Ministers Prime Minister, Deputy<br />
Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Foreign Minister are the first among them.<br />
Therefore, the appropriate format are debates between the Prime Minister<br />
and the alternative Prime Minister and between the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
the Foreign Minister and the Treasurer. Now, at this point, the Liberal Party<br />
has only agreed to a debate between Mr Howard and me, but not with Mr<br />
O'Brien.<br />
ends </p>
