SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT WELCOME BANQUET<br />
XIAMEN, 24 MAY 1986<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCIES, GOVERNOR Hu PING, SECRETARY Hu QILI<br />
MAYOR Zou ERFU<br />
I AM DELIGHTED TODAY TO BE IN FUJIAN PROVINCE, AND TO BE<br />
IN XIAMEN, HAVING JUST RETURNED FROM THE CITY OF ZHANGZHOU.<br />
MANY FUJIANESE HAVE MADE THEIR HOMES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE<br />
WORLD INCLUDING AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY HAVE MADE GREAT<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR NEWLY ADOPTED COUNTRIES.<br />
FROM WHAT I HAVE WITNESSED THIS MORNING, THEIR KINSMEN WHO<br />
HAVE REMAINED IN CHINA ARE ALSO MAKING GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS<br />
TO THIS COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT. I CONGRATULATE THEM ON THEIR<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS. FUJIAN'S TRADING RELATIONS WITH OUR REGION OF THE WORLD<br />
HAVE A HISTORY MUCH LONGER THAN THE MODERN HISTORY OF<br />
AUSTRALIA. FAMOUS FUJIANESE NAVIGATORS CHARTED THE WATERS<br />
OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA. THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY FUJIANESE TRADERS<br />
WHO PLIED THE TRADE ROUTES THROUGH SOUTH-EAST, SOUTH AND<br />
SOUTH-WEST ASIA AS EARLY AS THE 15TH CENTURY.<br />
I </p>
<p>2.<br />
FIVE CENTURIES LATER, THE FUTURE OF FUJIAN'S ECONOMIC<br />
DEVELOPMENT, LIKE CHINA'S AND AUSTRALIA'S, IS TO A LARGE<br />
DEGREE DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP FURTHER ITS<br />
ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND WITH<br />
THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION IN PARTICULAR. CHINA'S OPEN POLICY<br />
REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL AFFIRMATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE. NOT<br />
ONLY IS THIS POLICY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF CHINA'S OWN<br />
DEVELOPMENT; IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT TO THAT OF THE REGION<br />
OF WHICH CHINA IS AN INTEGRAL PART,<br />
THE FUJIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN ADOPTING SPECIFIC<br />
MEASURES TO IMPLEMENT THE OPEN POLICY IN THIS PROVINCE.<br />
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS, THREE ECONOMIC ZONES HAVE BEEN<br />
ESTABLISHED AIMED AT CREATING FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS FOR<br />
FOREIGN TRADE AND INVESTMENT: IN XIAMEN, FUZHOU AND THE<br />
SOUTH FUJIAN TRIANGLE, WHICH INCLUDES ZHANGZHOU. THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ECONOMIC ZONES HAS BEEN A COMPLEX<br />
AND CHALLENGING TASK, BUT ONE WHICH I HOPE IN TIME WILL<br />
BE RICHLY REWARDING IN ITS IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS<br />
OF FUJIAN AND CHINA,<br />
AUSTRALIAN INVOLVEMENT IN FUJIAN IS INCREASING, As PART<br />
OF FUJIAN'S CONTINUED DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS AGRICULTURAL<br />
ACTIVITY IN THE DIRECTION OF EXPORT-ORIENTED CASH CROPS,<br />
FUJIAN IMPORTS CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF AUSTRALIAN WHEAT<br />
AND IS FOR AUSTRALIA AN IMPORTANT CHINESE MARKET. AUSTRALIA<br />
FOR ITS PART IMPORTS A RANGE OF FUJIANESE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING<br />
TEA, GARMENTS, FOODSTUFFS AND HANDICRAFTS. </p>
<p>WE HAVE JUST WITNESSED THE OPENING OF THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
WOOL COMPANY JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN MACQUARIE WORSTED AND<br />
THE ZHANGZHOU JUTE MILL FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF WOOLLEN<br />
TEXTILES, IN A SEPARATE PROJECT, BHP, AUSTRALIA'S LARGEST<br />
COMPANY, AND IPAC ( EXPORT DEVELOPMENT AUSTRALIA) HAVE, IN<br />
CO-OPERATION WITH THEIR CHINESE PARTNERS, BEEN CONSTRUCTING<br />
A CEMENT PLANT IN SHUNCHANG, AND HERE IN XIAMEN, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN FIRM LEIGHTONS HAS COMPLETED AN INITIAL FEASIBILITY<br />
STUDY, FUNDED BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, FOR THE PHASE<br />
TWO DEVELOPMENT OF THE DONG DU PORT, THIS WILL INVOLVE<br />
THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIVE BERTHS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS<br />
AND WILL EXPAND THE PRESENT PORT'S ANNUAL HANDLING CAPACITY<br />
TO 8,5 MILLION TONNES THUS ENHANCING GREATLY XIAMEN'S<br />
AND FUJIAN'S CAPACITY TO SERVICE THE REQUIREMENTS OF A RAPIDLY<br />
EXPANDING ECONOMY, I LOOK FORWARD TO VISITING THE PORT THIS<br />
AFTERNOON, AND TO THE PROSPECT OF AUSTRALIAN COMMERCIAL<br />
PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE,<br />
IT IS, I THINK, AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT THE NATURE OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN INVOLVEMENT IN FUJIAN TO DATE IN THE BUILDING<br />
MATERIALS, TEXTILES AND TRANSPORT SECTORS CONFORMS TO THE<br />
FUJIAN GOVERNMENT'S GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES FOR THE<br />
PROVINCE, OUR ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP MUST ALWAYS BE FOUNDED<br />
ON THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL BENEFIT, </p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FUJIAN, CHINA AND AUSTRALIA ARE<br />
LINKED BY THE PACIFIC OCEAN WHICH IN BOTH CHINESE AND<br />
ENGLISH MEANS AN OCEAN OF PEACE. LET US CONTINUE TO WORK<br />
TOGETHER TO MAKE OURS A REGION OF PEACE IN THE HOPE THAT<br />
THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY WILL BE FOR THE PACIFIC A CENTURY<br />
OF PROSPERITY.<br />
I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST TO THE HEALTH OF OUR HOSTS<br />
IN XIAMEN, TO THE HEALTH OF ALL DISTINGUISHED CHINESE AND<br />
AUSTRALIAN GUESTS HERE TODAY AND TO THE HEALTH OF CHINAAUSTRALIA<br />
AND FUJIAN-AUSTRALIA RELATIONS. </p>
