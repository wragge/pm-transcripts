<p>Well, thank you very much, David; to Alistair Stewart; to my other</p>
<p> Parliamentary colleagues, Stewart MacArthur, Patrick Secker, Judy</p>
<p> Troeth, Dennis Napthine and Roger Hallam and all the other distinguished</p>
<p> guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is the first Sheepvention I've ever opened in my life and I intend</p>
<p> to enjoy myself today. It's the first occasion I've been to the electorate</p>
<p> of Wannon, to the city of Hamilton, since being Prime Minister. But</p>
<p> I'm not unfamiliar with this part of the world. I've been here on</p>
<p> numerous occasions in other capacities. But I'm particularly delighted</p>
<p> to be here today to not only open this, the Sheepvention, but as Prime</p>
<p> Minister to honour the contribution that the wool industry has made</p>
<p> to the wealth and prosperity of Australia from the foundation of the</p>
<p> nation, to say, indeed, hear! hear!</p>
<p>To say one or two things about the sort of general state of the Australian</p>
<p> economy, generally speaking, the Australian economy's in damn good</p>
<p> shape. The Australian economy's as strong as it's been for the last</p>
<p> 25 or 30 years. We have low interest rates, low inflation. We've got</p>
<p> rid of that wretched budget deficit we inherited three years ago.</p>
<p> And we are seen around the world as a very strong economy. But having</p>
<p> said that, I recognise that your own industry faces very big challenges.</p>
<p> I know that the demand for wool around the world is nowhere near as</p>
<p> great as it was. And I know that your industry faces the need, like</p>
<p> so many other industries, to grapple with that situation, to maintain</p>
<p> its competitiveness. And I know that the industry at the present time</p>
<p> is responding, and I hope it does in a very conscientious way, to</p>
<p> the recommendations of the Wool Taskforce. And I know that the industry</p>
<p> has had to grapple with a lot of changes that have been imposed upon</p>
<p> it by world markets and by climatic conditions and by the general</p>
<p> state of the world economy. And in talking about the overall strength</p>
<p> of our economy I do remain very sensitive to the particular problems</p>
<p> of rural Australia and the particular challenges that face the wool</p>
<p> industry of our country.</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity - because it is a very significant</p>
<p> gathering of rural Australia in a very special part of Australia which</p>
<p> has contributed so much not only to the prosperity of the wool industry</p>
<p> but to the prosperity of rural Australia - I want to take the opportunity</p>
<p> of saying to this audience and through you to all the other rural</p>
<p> people of Australia and to the Australian bush that just as we looked</p>
<p> after the interests of the bush in relation to the GST and preserving</p>
<p> the benefits of cheaper fuel that were promised when we brought the</p>
<p> package down in September of 1998, I want to assure you in the decisions</p>
<p> that the Government take in relation to reforming the business taxation</p>
<p> system of our country we are not going to do anything that is going</p>
<p> to damage the interests of the Australian bush. We're not going to</p>
<p> do anything in relation to those reforms that will lessen the competitive</p>
<p> position that you have and lessen the competitive position of Australian</p>
<p> farmers and Australian primary producers. Because one of the distinguishing</p>
<p> characteristics of Australian farmers and one of the things that has</p>
<p> made so many of us so absolutely hopping mad about the American decision</p>
<p> on lamb exports from Australia is that we have an industry in this</p>
<p> country, we have a farm sector in this country, that does not operate</p>
<p> with the protection and the support and the subsidies and the handouts</p>
<p> that are given by the Americans, the Japanese and the Europeans to</p>
<p> their farmers.</p>
<p>What Australian farmers win around the world they win by dint of their</p>
<p> own competitiveness and their own expertise. And I am very, as Prime</p>
<p> Minister, I'm very sensitive towards that. I'm very understanding</p>
<p> of that. And, of course, it goes without saying, the Government remains</p>
<p> determined to do all it can through the relief of the cost of the</p>
<p> levy paid by lamb producers and other industry assistance, it remains</p>
<p> determined to do all it can to ensure that the unfair, unreasonable</p>
<p> anti free trade decision taken by the American administration in relation</p>
<p> to lamb exports does not rob the lamb exporters of Australia of any</p>
<p> of the market they have won over the last year or two and mitigates</p>
<p> as much as we possibly can the impact of that decision on growth of</p>
<p> further markets in the United States in the interests of Australian</p>
<p> lamb producers.</p>
<p>I don't think any audience in Australia would have a better appreciation</p>
<p> than this audience of the importance of winning markets overseas.</p>
<p> Some Australians talk rather foolishly of how it is important that</p>
<p> we erect protective barriers around this country as if in some way</p>
<p> we could close our eyes to the rest of the world. No country can do</p>
<p> that. It's in the interests of Australian primary producers as much,</p>
<p> if not more, than any other section of the Australian community to</p>
<p> see world markets expand and world markets opened up. And it is for</p>
<p> that reason in the interests of our country that we pursue that sort</p>
<p> of approach. But in order to provide our local producers with a proper</p>
<p> base we need good economic conditions in this country. And that is</p>
<p> why I'm very pleased to say that over the last two or three years</p>
<p> we have been able to get interest rates down. I can remember for 10</p>
<p> or 15 years before that when I went around the bush and I said to</p>
<p> people, 'what is the thing that hurts you most?' And invariably the</p>
<p> answer would come back, firstly, high interest rates and, secondly,</p>
<p> high fuel prices. Now, we've been able, over the last few years, to</p>
<p> bring interest rates down. They're not as low as we'd like them to</p>
<p> be but they're a lot lower now than what they were 10 or 15 years</p>
<p> ago. And through the taxation package we're going to reduce quite</p>
<p> dramatically the cost of diesel and the cost of fuel generally throughout</p>
<p> Australia. And that, along with the abolition of the wholesale sales</p>
<p> taxes and many other indirect taxes, that will provide an enormous</p>
<p> boost to the export industry of this country because it will reduce</p>
<p> your cost structure. And if your cost structure comes down, your competitive</p>
<p> position gets better.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, that is a long enough speech at a Sheepvention</p>
<p> or, indeed, any gathering. Can I say to you as somebody who was raised</p>
<p> in a suburb of Sydney, as somebody who has spent most of his life</p>
<p> living in the cities of Australia, that I've always had a tremendous</p>
<p> affection for the people of the Australian bush. I do appreciate that</p>
<p> you have been the backbone of our country. I do acknowledge the contribution</p>
<p> of the wool industry to the wealth and the stability and the prosperity</p>
<p> of Australia. I acknowledge the ongoing contributing of the export</p>
<p> income that is earned for this country by Australia's primary producers.</p>
<p> I know what difficult times you've been through. I know how hard it</p>
<p> is for so many of you now. And I know how rotten it is when you work</p>
<p> your heart out and you're locked out of a world market by the selfish</p>
<p> trading policy of larger countries and larger groupings of countries</p>
<p> like the United States and the European Union. I am a passionate advocate</p>
<p> of our security alliance with the United States. I admire a great</p>
<p> deal about that country but I despise on occasions the hypocritical</p>
<p> trading policy that that country adopts which punish Australian farmers</p>
<p> and punish Australian primary producers. And I want you to know the</p>
<p> depth of our feeling on that and I want you to understand that we</p>
<p> recognise the continuing difficulty you have. We are providing you</p>
<p> with a stronger and better and more benign general economic climate</p>
<p> than this country has had for many years. And I can assure you that</p>
<p> in future decisions we take on the Australian taxation system we will</p>
<p> not harm the interests of the Australian bush. We will not harm the</p>
<p> interests of the Australian wool industry. And, of course, I have</p>
<p> great pleasure in declaring this Sheepvention open for business. Thank</p>
<p> you very much.</p>
