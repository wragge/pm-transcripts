SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN<br />
CANBERRA 4 JULY 1988<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Australia, in this<br />
our bicentennial year.<br />
The relationship between Australia and Japan is of profound<br />
and critical importance to both of us. And it is a<br />
relationship which, over the years, we have built into one<br />
which is warm and friendly.<br />
That is reflected by the fact that you, Sir, are making this<br />
visit to us in your first year in office. You are the<br />
seventh Prime Minister of Japan to do Australia the honour<br />
of a visit in just over three decades. And I recall with<br />
pleasure our previous meetings, including our most recent<br />
meeting in Tokyo shortly after you became Prime minister<br />
last year.<br />
Our friendship is reflected in the very large numbers of<br />
Japanese families who are visiting our country as tourists,<br />
and enjoying our hospitality and the grandeur of out<br />
landscape. Let me say, Mr Prime Minister, that your fellow<br />
countrymen and women are v ' ery welcome guests to Australia<br />
and it is my hope that they return home having experienced<br />
an enjoyable and memorable holiday.<br />
our friendship is reflected, too, in Japan's active and<br />
generous involvement in Australia's bicentennial<br />
celebrations. Your exhibition at Expo 88 in Brisbane, the visit of your<br />
fine sailing ship, the Nippon Maru, and the gift of<br />
flowering cherry trees some of which have been planted<br />
here at our new Parliament House have been, and are<br />
continuing to be, noteworthy contributions to our<br />
celebrations. 14.1<br />

we have appreciated particularly the generosity of both the W(<br />
Japanese Government and the private sector in helping to c<br />
establish the National science and Technology Centre here in ti<br />
Canberra. As you have already seen, the construction of the<br />
Centre is well advanced, and it promises to be a majorB<br />
drawcard for tourists and Canberra residents alike. a<br />
As well as being friends, Australia and Japan are of course<br />
ccolmomsee rcainadl vaalfufeadi rsp. artners across a very wide range of A<br />
We share membership of a very special club -the group ofI<br />
nations clustered around the Western rim of the Pacific. wl<br />
Trade within this region and across the Pacific is growing Ji<br />
at an extraordinary rate. S fi<br />
our two countries, by virtue of our locations, our U<br />
complementary economic structures and the talents of ourI<br />
peoples, stand to gain much from these developments. W m<br />
But, as I have said on numerous occasios h rseiyo r<br />
our region is very much in our own hands. I<br />
If we choose to build upon and accelerate the processes of w<br />
trade liberalisation and economic policy harmonization which p1<br />
are beginning to emerge, there can be no doubt that this t<br />
will truly be the Pacific century.<br />
But the future is far less assured if we do not seize the<br />
opportunities now available. Aq<br />
All nations have a part to play in this process. f<br />
Australia was encouraged by the positive approach to policy A<br />
coordination and trade reform which emerged from the Toronto i<br />
Summit. B<br />
But Japan, by virtue of its economic strength and the sheer<br />
size of its external surplus, has a special responsibility -W<br />
a responsibility not just to secure economic and financial e<br />
stability at home but to ensure the functioning of a viable M<br />
regional and world trading system.<br />
I am pleased to acknowledge that Japan's policies are p<br />
already moving in the right direction. el w<br />
The task of economic restructuring is well underway.<br />
Domestic demand has now replaced exports as the primary 11<br />
engine of Japan's growth a transformation which is already<br />
yielding very encouraging opportunities for Japan's tradingA<br />
partners, including Australia, to gain greater access to the<br />
Japanese market. b<br />

we acknowledge and welcome, Mr Prime minister, the political<br />
courage shown by you and your administration in reaching<br />
that agreement.<br />
But I do not see protectionism as a problem confined to<br />
agricultural trade. It threatens our prosperity across the<br />
whole spectrum of manufacturing and service industries.<br />
And it would be wrong of me to suggest that Australia is<br />
completely satisfied with our access to your markets.<br />
I stress that we are not looking for special favours. What<br />
we want is the opportunity to compete on fair terms.<br />
Japan, as well as the European Community and the United<br />
States, must show their determination to rebuild free and<br />
fair international trade. The opportunity is at hand in the<br />
Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.<br />
We look to Japan to use its considerable influence to help<br />
maintain impetus in the Uruguay round and achieve concrete<br />
results this year at the Mid-term Review.<br />
And I would add that, for our part, we are practicing what<br />
we are preaching. For example, we have already announced<br />
phased cuts in tariffs which will reduce average assistance<br />
to manufacturing by 30 per cent over the next 4 years.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
Australia looks to a steady increase in the range and<br />
quality of our exchanges with the Japanese people. You will<br />
find us a worthwhile partner in any field of endeavour.<br />
Australia is proud of its reputation as a reliable and<br />
important supplier of raw materials to Japanese industry.<br />
But we are also increasingly becoming recognised for our<br />
exports of manufactures and services including tourism.<br />
We are particularly pleased that processed and manufactured<br />
exports are increasing steadily and last year amounted to<br />
more than 20 per cent of our total exports to your country.<br />
We offer an exciting prospect for any investor wishing to<br />
participate in this expanding area of Australian economic<br />
endeavour. I certainly hope that many Japanese investors<br />
will take advantage of the opportunities now on offer here.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
Australia recognises that Japan's economic strength is<br />
complemented by your growing political influence. we<br />
believe that this is a factor for stability in the<br />
Asia-Pacific region. We value and wish to intensify the<br />
political consultations which we have with Japan on global<br />
an d regional issues of concern to both of us, such as arms<br />
control and disarmament. </p>
<p>4.<br />
We do so aware that the leaders of the United States and the<br />
Soviet Union have created a new climate between them in<br />
which reductions in nuclear arsenals can be pursued in a<br />
constructive fashion.<br />
All of us are aware, too, that the process of change<br />
underway in the Soviet Union, while its outcome is<br />
uncertain, does offer the prospect of new challenges and<br />
opportunities for all of us in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
You will be aware of the networks of relationships between<br />
our two countries which have developed over the years,<br />
involving businessmen and women, parliamentarians, students,<br />
scientists, academics, journalists, and trade unionists.<br />
The list of exchanges is now very long.<br />
You can be assured that the Australian Government is<br />
committed to maintaining the momentun of broad based<br />
cultural exchanges. we believe the development of further<br />
exchanges in education would represent a valuable new<br />
element in our relationship.<br />
As an example of the creative vision that is appropriate to<br />
our relationship, our two Governments are co-operating in a<br />
joint feasibility study on establishing in Australia a<br />
futuristic technology centre, or multifunctional polis.<br />
It is envisaged that this unique concept will allow both<br />
Australian and Japanese industry to benefit from direct<br />
interaction with Pacific Basin and European companies by<br />
providing an exciting venue for technical research and<br />
industrial co-operation.<br />
I am confident that, despite differences of language,<br />
culture and history, Australians and Japanese will steadily<br />
move beyond the growing recognition that we share certain<br />
elements of a modern lifestyle, towards a better and more<br />
comprehensive understanding of each other including, very<br />
importantly, a deeper intellectual exchange.<br />
Once again, Mr Prime minister and Mrs Takeshita, welcome to<br />
Australia. You are most distinguished guests. Australia<br />
places great value on its relationship with Japan a<br />
relationship which in the post-war period has brought great<br />
benefit to both countries. I look forward with confidence<br />
to a dynamic and expanding partnership.<br />
