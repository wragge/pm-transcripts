FOR PRESS: OOC/ P FM. No. 130/ 1967<br />
REQUEST IN LORD B RUCE'S WILL<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
The Government has been advised from Equity Trustees,<br />
the Administrators of the V.' ill of the late Lord Bruce, that the former<br />
Prime Minister had requested that his ashes should be scattered<br />
over Canberra. The Government has approved of this being done and will<br />
ask the RAAF to perform the ceremony. The Government will arrange<br />
for a special memorial service to be held during the scattering of the<br />
ashes. It feels that the service should be fully representative of the<br />
Parliament and it intends, therefore, to hold the ceremonies on a<br />
suitable occasion after the resumption of Parliament next year.<br />
CANBERRA, November, 1967 </p>
