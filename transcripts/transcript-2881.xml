THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS, CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 3 APRIL, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are a very considerable number of<br />
decisions which the Cabinet made this morning. Most of them<br />
you can get details about from my colleagues, and I've told<br />
them that you might be asking them details.. There are some<br />
however which come within my responsibility so I'll give a<br />
bit further detail about them.<br />
We decided on two significant improvements'in the<br />
conditions of service for Australian Government employees.<br />
The first deals with maternity leave and the second with<br />
furlough long service leave. Legislation to implement these<br />
decisions will be introduced as soon as possible but the<br />
improved conditions will be effective from 1 January last.<br />
I'll be issuing press statements which will give the details.<br />
They'll go to some pages. They include however, in the case of ( a)<br />
maternity leave a minimum of 12 weeks paid maternity leave<br />
and up to one week's leave with pay for employees who require<br />
it to care for the mother or children. In the case of<br />
furlough an increase in the accrual rate of long service leave<br />
to half a month for each year of service after 10 years,<br />
reduction in the qualifying periods for long service leave<br />
and for payment in lieu. These decisions are consistent with<br />
my Government's policy that as the largest single employer<br />
in Australia, we have a duty to advance the cause of all<br />
employees by establishing new and improved standards of<br />
employment for our own employees. The maternity leave provisions<br />
in particular, of course, have been ILO standards since 1919.<br />
Cabinet decided to establish a task force to apply close<br />
scrutiny to continuing policies of the previous Government so<br />
that room may be found for our own higher priority programs.<br />
The Chairman of the task force will be Dr. Coombs who will<br />
be responsible for the final report. To assist him I have<br />
sought and obtained from their respective ministers the release<br />
of the following officers from their normal departmental duties<br />
so that they can serve on the task force in a personal capacity:<br />
Mr M. A. Besley, First Assistant Secretary, Department of External<br />
Territories, Dr. S. F. Harris, Deputy Secretary, Department of<br />
Overseas Trade, Mr R. D. Phillips, Deputy Director-General,<br />
Department of Civil Aviation, Mr J. 0. Stone, Deputy Secretary,<br />
( Economic), Department of the Treasury. They will be joined on<br />
the task force by Mr P. V. McGuinnes of Mr Hayden's office and<br />
Mr J. J. Spigelman of mine. Mr Walsh will be releasing to you<br />
the letter I've sent to Dr. Coombs.<br />
We have decided to set up a National Commission on social<br />
welfare. The Chairman will be Mrs. Maree Coleman, the Deputy<br />
Chairman will be sought by advertisement. The part~' time<br />
members will be Professor R. G. Brown, professor of Social<br />
Administration at Flinders, Mrs. Sadie Canning, Matron of the<br />
Leonora Hospital, Western Australia, Mrs. Edna Chamberlain,<br />
Head of the Department of Social Work in the university of </p>
<p>Queensland, Professor Harris, Professor of Economics at<br />
James Cook University, Mr Tom Roper, Lecturer in Education<br />
at La Trobe University, Professor E. G. Saint, Dean of the<br />
Faculty of Medicine in the University of Queensland, the<br />
Reverend Keith Seamnan Superintendent of the Adelaide<br />
Central Methodist Mission, Mr Greg Sullivan, of the<br />
N. S. W. Bar, and an A. C. T. U. representative who will be<br />
nominated by the President of the A. C. T. U. Mr Hayden can<br />
give you more details of the terms of reference I have got<br />
them here actually but I don't suppose you want me to take<br />
up time in reading them to you. Now to the other decisions.<br />
Mr Barnard, as Minister for Defence, and I as Foreign<br />
Minister, will be referring to the Joint Select Committee on<br />
Foreign Affairs and Defence any Foreign Affairs and Defence<br />
aspects of the Omega Navigation System. The Attorney-General<br />
will draw up a bill to repeal those sections of the Crimes<br />
Act which permit the deportation of citizens who were born<br />
overseas and the declaration oil organisations by the High Court<br />
or a State Supreme Court. These sections have been in the Act<br />
I think since 1926. Mr Uren can give you the details of the<br />
inquiry into the leasehold system of land tenure. Mr Justice<br />
Else-Mitchell will preside over the inquiry and the terms are<br />
being settled in consultation with him by Mr Uren and Mr Enderby.<br />
Mr Uren will give you the details of the establishment of<br />
Australian-State Land Commuissions. Dr Patterson and Mr Enderby<br />
can give you the details of a survey into a regional township<br />
in the Aligator River area. Dr Patterson can give you details<br />
of our suggestions on a Burdekin River Authority. Mr Crean can<br />
give you details of a technical bill to make defence expenditure<br />
a charge on loan funds. Mr Jones can give you details of the<br />
reappointment of the Select Committee on Road Safety which the<br />
House of Representatives established last year. Senator Wriedt<br />
can give you details of the Wool Research Grants which we've<br />
approved for next financial year. Senator Wriedt is leaving<br />
for a meeting of the International Wool Secretariat tomorrow.<br />
He can also give you details of our proposals for a national<br />
brucellosis and animal tuberculosis campaign, and Mr Morrison<br />
can give you the details of a bill to amend the Marine Science<br />
Institute Bill and details of the Ord River Research Program.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
May I ask you two questions please: one is on the<br />
Rhodesian Information Centre and the powers of the Government,<br />
the Foreign Affairs powers, to close that if the New South Wales<br />
Government doesn't deregister it under the Companies Act.<br />
I'm not clear about those powers, Sir, and the other question<br />
was legislation being introduced by Senator Murphy ultimately<br />
with regard to the integration of law enforcement authorities.<br />
I think some people are worried that this could put too much<br />
power of the law enforcement of an investigation and of a<br />
prosecution character into the hands of one man, and I wonder<br />
how you see this particular problem in terms of a free society?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: First of all, the Rhodesian Information Service.<br />
There are proceedings pending in the Supreme Court of New South<br />
Wales to strip that shop of its title. if it turns out that the<br />
New South Wales law is not adequate to deal with the situation<br />
then we would introduce in the Parliament a bill to implement<br />
the United Nations Security Council resolutions. We would under </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs power have the jurisdiction to pass such a<br />
bill. At present we are supporting the application to take<br />
the title away in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The<br />
other legislation about, say, a Federal Bureau of Investigation<br />
or a bill to unite or co-ordinate the Commonwealth Police<br />
forces the Commonwealth Police Force, the Australian<br />
Capital Territory Police Force, the Northern Territory Police<br />
Force and various law enforcement agencies in different<br />
Federal departments that bill has not been discussed by the<br />
Cabinet at all. There can be no question, however, of any powers<br />
given to any agency exceeding those to which we are accustomed<br />
and to which in particular the Australian Labor Party gives<br />
weight. There can be no question of there not being a due<br />
process of law in all these matters. Not only would we not<br />
wish to diminish in any ways these civil liberties, but the<br />
Constitution probably wouldn't let us.<br />
Can I follow this up with one more question: it's a<br />
question of using these powers at a particular political time<br />
in the. country. Now yesterday the homes of a number of<br />
Croats were in fact entered by police forces with warrants<br />
legally, but these acts did happen at a time when the<br />
Attorney-General was under criticism for not producing enough<br />
evidence in the Parliament of Croat terrorist activities. The<br />
Government has been in power for something like four months<br />
and it could be asked why these visits didn't take place say,<br />
two months ago<br />
PRIME MINISTER: or four years, or two years ago. These<br />
questions can be well asked.<br />
I am particularly implying to this Government. Why<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would be fair to ask why weren't these<br />
actions taken four years or two years ago. I don't propose to<br />
answer questions on that subject because there are Court<br />
proceedings pending.<br />
Prime Minister, could I ask you about your statement in<br />
the House concerning a conspiracy by some public servants. You<br />
indicated that some action was pending and about to be taken.<br />
Would you say what action?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Could you say how many people were involved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I didn't raise the word'conspiracy'<br />
Mr Snedden used that word. On the face of the document as I<br />
said, and I quoted it, there would appear to be conspiracy<br />
between representatives of two Departments at this meeting on<br />
2 March. As I said in the House, I will not say who the persons<br />
were who attended that meeting, and as I said also in the House,<br />
I'm not going to cast dispersions on people who, it might turn<br />
out, don't deserve to have dispersions cast on them.<br />
Sir, will you be making an ultimate report to Parliament<br />
on this, the subject having been raised in the fashion it has been?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: PIRI'MlEMlIN ITsERe: e what happens. </p>
<p>Would you explain why you believe it's a conspiracy,<br />
Mr Whitlam?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is being televised and the people who<br />
see it mightn't have had the advantage of listening to<br />
Question Time so I'll read the passage from the report which<br />
I read at Question Time. You'll remember that this was a<br />
passage from a report made on 5 March by the ASIO representative<br />
at a meeting of representatives of several departments which<br />
was held in Canberra on 2 March apropos of a statement<br />
which the Attorney-General made on 1 March to the effect that<br />
he'd be making a statement on Croatian terrorism, and this is<br />
the extract which I read at Question Time:<br />
" The Department of Foreign Affairs made two points<br />
on the proposed statement, that is the statement which the<br />
Attorney-General, Senator Murphy, said that he would be<br />
making in the Senate. The first was that the statement should<br />
not be at variance with the interim reply given to Yugoslavia<br />
in response for the aide memoire presented to Australia<br />
following the Bosnian Incident in 1972. The Bosnian Incident<br />
you will remember was that in which nine former residents of<br />
Australia ( six naturalised Australians) had been picked up in<br />
an incursion into Yugoslavia. The second was that unless there<br />
were reasons to the contrary, they prefer the statement to be<br />
deferred until after the visit to Australia of the Prime<br />
Minister of Yugoslavia from 20-22 March 1973. The Attorney-<br />
General's Department accepted the first point, but argued on the<br />
seconid point that the Attorney-General might find it necessary<br />
to table the statement at an earlier date."<br />
Sir, on such Inter-departmental Committees does the<br />
representative of the various departments have responsibility<br />
to report to the Head of the Department or the Minister in each<br />
case. In other words, would the Foreign Affairs ñ epresentative<br />
there have a responsibility to report to the Head of the<br />
Department or to report to you as Foreign Affairs Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know what his responsibilities are<br />
to the Department. There are of course a very great number<br />
of Inter-departmental Committees having meetings all the time<br />
and I would imagine there is only a small number of those<br />
meetings which are ever brought to the attention of the<br />
ministers concerned. on this occasion, it is somewhat surprising<br />
that none of the ministers concerned were told about the meeting.<br />
Prime Minister, Senator Murphy has told the Senate that<br />
you in fact are conducting the investigation into this subject.<br />
Can you tell us what procedures have been adopted. Are you<br />
questioning people personally? Have you delegated someone to<br />
do it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The latter.<br />
Can you tell us who?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
What's the aim of the investigation? is it just to confirm<br />
that that report is accurate and what action is open to the </p>
<p>Government if you find that it is accurate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Most of these men would be public servants<br />
and, if this were true, and I'm making no assumptions, I would<br />
assume there has been a breach of duty by one or more public<br />
servants. What will be the penalty if there is a breach?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Whatever the Public Service Act requires.<br />
If any action is taken against any public servants<br />
would you make that action public?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know what the procedure is. In some<br />
cases, action against public servants has to be gazetted.<br />
I wouldn't be conducting the investigation or, if it is<br />
appropriate, imposing any penalties. It's not for me to do.<br />
Sir, is it a member of your staff who is conducting the<br />
investigations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't answer any more on this.<br />
Sir, one more question. When do you hope to have the<br />
findings of this investigation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
Sir, you referred in Question Time to the previous<br />
Government having lied to the Yugoslav Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Are you convinced that such a strong statement is<br />
justified and might this not just have been normal diplomacy<br />
to try and avoid trouble between the Governments?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I think what I said was accurate, it was<br />
strong, and deservedly strong. For many years the Yugoslav<br />
Government has been protesting to Australia bringing it to the<br />
notice of the Australian Government organised activity<br />
against Yugoslav missions and representatives. The previous<br />
Government always said that there was no evidence on which to<br />
prosecute individuals. It always avoided the question that<br />
there was organised activity. Nobody reading or listening to<br />
the ministerial statements last Tuesday would doubt that there<br />
was organised activity. The former Governments of Australia<br />
did not accurately put the position to the Yugoslav Government.<br />
Prime Minister, could you have known publicly about some<br />
of these organisations like J. I. O. and ASIO and D-S-CCould<br />
I ask you about the Australian Secret Intelligence Service<br />
which comes under your ministerial control if you could tell<br />
us who heads that operation, where it has its headquarters and<br />
what its operation is?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will answer no questions on security matters.<br />
Nobody in my position has and I won't and I'm certain you know<br />
that. </p>
<p>Sir, on the March 2 meeting, did ASIO have any<br />
responsibility to report either to yourself as the Head of<br />
the Government or to the Attorney-General as the Administrator?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've already said I don't know what the<br />
duties are in this case. I would have thought that a meeting<br />
which, among other things, discussed a pending statement by<br />
a minister would have been brought to the notice of the<br />
ministers who had departmental officers at that meeting.<br />
I don't know what the duty of the ASIO representative was.<br />
All I should perhaps add at this stage is that from now on<br />
meetings of this character will have agreed minutes.<br />
When did the investigation which you refer to begin?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Immediately after Senator Murphy discovered<br />
the document from which I have quoted this extract. I heard<br />
of this on the 16th, yes.<br />
Prime minister, Senator Murphy rests his case on visiting<br />
the ASIO headquarters in Melbourne on the basis of the discovery<br />
of this document at the ASIO offices in Canberra. We still don't<br />
know why he made a midnight visit to the ASIO offices in<br />
Canberra. Can you tell us why?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know why, but you will see the result<br />
of it and I think you'd be very interested that this information<br />
about this meeting and such a report of it as I've quoted were<br />
discovered as a result of Senator Murphy's visit to the ASIO<br />
quarters in Canberra,<br />
Sir, Senator Murphy has said that this document which<br />
he discovered at ASIO headquarters in Canberra -the original<br />
of it was in the ASIO headquarters in Melbourne -should have<br />
been brought to his knowledge, but was not brought to his<br />
knowledge. Is that not prima facie evidence that the Head of<br />
ASIO has not carried out his responsibilities to his Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know what the duty is this is the<br />
third time I've said it. I do believe that ministers should<br />
have been told of the meeting discussing this matter. I think<br />
Senator Murphy should have been told, but whether it was<br />
ASIO's job to tell him I do not know.<br />
They had the record. They were the ones who kept the<br />
record of it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
He said it should have been brought to his knowledge<br />
and was not.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not saying whether ASIO should have<br />
brought it to his knowledge. I don't know if it was their<br />
job to do it. But I do think it should have been brought to<br />
his knowledgje, yes.<br />
Q: Mr Whitlam, you said that we would be interested in the<br />
information that was found but why weren't we told about it.<br />
We, meaning the public, when Senator Murphy spoke to the Senate </p>
<p>or prior to that the fortnight before, and had it not come out<br />
the way it did, did you ever intend to release this information<br />
which you released today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I wouldn't have released it.<br />
What is the objection of the Government to releasing<br />
the information contained in the document other than the<br />
security aspects of it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That is the reason, and it's a sufficient<br />
one, but Senator Murphy said that in the Senate last week and<br />
he said that it was on the advice of the Director-General of<br />
ASIO. Having read the document I can well believe that he<br />
would have given that advice and I would believe it sound.<br />
But, Sir, surely there's no...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think there's another gentlemen down there..<br />
Prime Minister, can I ask you has the Government considered<br />
the continued appointment of Mr Barber as Director-General of<br />
ASIO? PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Has it considered varying the terms and conditions<br />
of his appointment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Will it do-either of these things?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
You say you don't know. Would a decision on that rest on<br />
the subject of your inquiry that you are carrying out now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't think that the inquiry which is<br />
being conducted into the accuracy or not of the report of this<br />
meeting would concern Mr Barber. Mr Barber was not there.<br />
Prime Minister, why couldn't Senator Murphy have rung<br />
Mr Barber in Melbourne and requested him to provide this<br />
information? What is the reason for that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You ask him.<br />
Prime Minister, as it was the ASIO representative who<br />
wrote the report in attendance at the meeting on March 2 as<br />
an official representative of ASIO and if so to whom does he<br />
report? PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
Did he take part in a discussion?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
Prime minister, on a different topic, you mention the </p>
<p>task force examining the previous Government's expenditures:<br />
is there any suggestion that this task force could also examine<br />
your policy expenditures. Is there any suggestion that some of<br />
those might be curbed in appreciation of this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
This whole idea of a task force you said Eric's going<br />
to release a letter on it can you give us an idea of the<br />
structure. A task force's an institution we haven't heard of<br />
before. Is it going to call for public evidence or is it<br />
going to have access to departments?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It will have access to departments.<br />
Full time? I mean the personnel you've got there are<br />
pretty high-powered<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Aren't they? It won't be taking public<br />
evidence, and I doubt whether they can do it full-time. I expect<br />
them to give a lot of time to it.<br />
Have you set a time on when they report?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
When do you expect a report?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would obviously be before we were discussing<br />
the budget. Sir, it seems clear that one of the reasons for the<br />
task force is concern about inflation. can you give us an idea<br />
of the extent to which the Government is concerned about the<br />
problem how serious it is at the moment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think I'll go into that here. Of<br />
course we're concerned about it. This is one aspect of it.<br />
Prime Minister, in view of the decision in the United<br />
States and also in New Zealand to introduce price control on<br />
the sale of red meat, would you consider taking similar action<br />
here in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wish we could, but the Federal people can't<br />
do it. As Mr Crean pointed out, the States have power in this<br />
respect. Two-thirds of the Australian people live in New South<br />
Wales and Victoria. There is nothing to limit those Parliaments<br />
bringing in price control on red meat as has happened in the<br />
United States and New Zealand. Nothing to prevent them. We<br />
would obviously applaud them doing it, but we can't do it<br />
federally. Will you ask them to do it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. But they really should be able to take<br />
some initiative themselves in these matters. </p>
<p>There's fairly regular correspondence between yourself<br />
and the Premiers..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Correspondence between the Premiers and me<br />
relates to things that we do jointly. There is nothing that<br />
we can do with regard to price control on such commodities.<br />
Prime Minister, there seem to be now only two States which<br />
the previous Government kept at a distance for ideological<br />
reasons Albania and Cuba. Are relations with these two States<br />
being considered? Has there been an approach from. Cuba?-Are our<br />
considerations of this being swayed by in deference-to the<br />
United States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We recognise both Albania and Cuba. We always<br />
have. We don't have diplomatic representatives in or from<br />
Albania or Cuba. We're not discussing having diplomatic<br />
representatives in or from either of them. There is a suggestion<br />
that there should be a Cuban Consulate in Australia. There is<br />
in fact quite a considerable trade between Cuba and Australia.<br />
Prime Minister, the task force will be reconsidering<br />
former Government decisions in a number of areas, but what<br />
state is your review of the former Government's apparent<br />
decisions. I understand you called for all-out standing reports<br />
from the Board. Are you going to consider such decisions as the<br />
decision to protect the Chain Factory at Benalla?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is just what I'm not going to do go<br />
into ad hoc imposition or demolition of tariffs. This is the<br />
matter that Sir John Crawford's looking into.<br />
Sir, on this inquiry, will Dr. Coombs, as the man who's<br />
responsible for it, be mainly full-time on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, he can't be full-time on this because he<br />
is doing a lot of other things too as you know.<br />
Prime Minister, in announcing the Cabinet decisions, you<br />
said that yourself and Mr Barnard had agreed to refer to the<br />
Joint Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs any aspects of<br />
Omega which have defence significance. Does this mean that<br />
Cabinet has decided that Omega does have some defence significance?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, it hasn't discussed it whether there are<br />
Defence or Foreign Affairs aspects of Omega. There are many<br />
people who assert it has. They'll have the opportunity to<br />
ventilate their views and to have those views examined or<br />
exposed in public before the Committee.<br />
And will this delay any decision on the future of<br />
our Government until that Committee has reported?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think we would be making a decision<br />
until the Committee has reported but how quickly the Committee<br />
reports is up to the Committee. All these Parliamentary<br />
Committees, listeners and viewers may not realise are composed<br />
of representatives from all the political parties in the<br />
Parliament. </p>
<p>Have you or the Government considered the abolition<br />
of the D Notice system?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This has never been considered. You must<br />
be from the Nation Review. They're the only D Notices whose.:<br />
existence I would ever acknowledge.<br />
May we take that seriously, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You'll take it as it was meant, I'm sure.<br />
Prime Minister, in the Cabinet decision or endorsement<br />
to refer the Omega question or defence aspects of it to the<br />
Joint Parliamentary Committee, was there any wider discussion<br />
by Cabinet on the question of defence facilities in this<br />
country? PRIME MINISTER: No, not at all.<br />
Prime Minister, did you discuss Senator Murphy's proposed<br />
divorce legislation today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Prime Minister, the Treasury would normally be the<br />
Department that would exercise continuing scrutiny over past<br />
government commitments wouldn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would be one of the Departments, and a<br />
very senior member of that Department is on the task force<br />
Mr Stone. I was going to ask you do you think that the job it was<br />
doing in this respect was deficient so that you had to set up<br />
this Committee two personal staff representatives from the<br />
Government on it. Unusual, the point I'm trying to make<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You're referring to Mr McGuinnes from<br />
Mr Hayden's staff and Mr Spigelman from mine?<br />
Yes, it's unusual to have a mixed committee like that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The fact that it's unusual doesn't make it<br />
improper or undesirable. Mr McGuinnes is not disqualified from<br />
the fact that he used to write perceptively for the Financial<br />
Review, and Mr Spigelman is a well-known author.<br />
Speaking of which, Sir, what is the Government going to<br />
do about the question of open government?. What's happening to<br />
all of the reports that were reviewed by Mr spigelman and by<br />
other Ministers?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We're waiting for some of them to come in<br />
from the Department.<br />
I take it from your answer to Mr Lombard previously that<br />
you don't intend to discuss security matters.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: PNRIoME MINtIThERa: t's right. </p>
<p>11.<br />
That you include Secret Intelligence Service within this<br />
on the basis that it would appear to impinge upon the security<br />
of other countries. What harm could be done to the national<br />
interest by entering in general questions such as are you<br />
satisfied with the operation of the Australian Secret<br />
Intelligence Service? Are you satisfied that it fits in with<br />
our foreign policy and does no harm to it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: V. 11l repeat I'll not answer questions<br />
in Parliament or here or anywhere on security matters. That is<br />
a procedure which is followed has been followed by all my<br />
predecessors. It is a procedure which I shall follow too.<br />
Some of you have mentioned some organisations by name. I will<br />
not confirm or deny or correct any such names. The reason is<br />
obvious. By asking sufficient number of questions and then<br />
getting denials or confirmations or corrections people can<br />
find out about the security procedures of this country. I will<br />
not answer questions on these matters.<br />
Prime Minister, may we ask a question on the role of<br />
Australia on South-East Asia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Could you limit the question?<br />
What new possible role can Australia obtain in South-East<br />
Asia after Labor took over?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's a very wide subject. I've written a lot<br />
of articles on this. You don't want me to to expatiate on this.<br />
The general historical context is that we want peace to be<br />
established in this area. We do not want arrangements such as<br />
were made after the end of the Korean War or at Geneva in<br />
1954 to miscarry a second time. We are therefore in active<br />
consultation diplomatically with all the countries of that area<br />
in the hope that the latest agreements ( ceasef ire agreements)<br />
in Vietnam and Laos will succeed and that such agreements can be<br />
made in the Khmer Republic. Secondly in the overall economic<br />
or social context we want to see that the great disparity<br />
between relatively developed countries such as Australia,<br />
New Zealand and Japan and all the countries in between is<br />
reduced. And there again internationally, diplomatically,<br />
we are doing what we can to see that developed countries help<br />
to raise the standards in developing countries. Even Japan<br />
can't do it single-handed. we can make some impact, but a<br />
marginal one. obviously the countries of Europe east and west<br />
and of North America must also contribute to that end. And a<br />
concluding thing I could point out is that we are the only<br />
country which has never been ruled by another people, except<br />
Thailand. Every other country within thousands of miles has<br />
within the last generation been ruled by other countries. We<br />
ourselves have ruled some other countries, conspicuously<br />
Papua New Guinea. So therefore our policies are designed quite<br />
deliberately to rid Australia of any colonial or colour policies.<br />
I think that was German T. V. wasn't it?<br />
I thought you were going to ask me about the Mercedes. </p>
