PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
TOWNSVILLE TRADES AND LABOR COUNCIL<br />
CENTENARY DINNER<br />
TOWNSVILLE 14 AUGUST 1988<br />
one hundred years ago next week a group of Townsville<br />
workers gathered at Grosskoff's Family Hotel here in<br />
Townsville for an historic meeting.<br />
The bricklayers, carpenters, seamen, wharfies, builders,<br />
laborers, tailors and butchers who came together on 23<br />
August 1888 carried this motion: " That they form themselves<br />
into a branch of the Trades and Labor Council of<br />
Queensland." Tonight we celebrate the one hundred years of hard work,<br />
commitment and solidarity which that resolution initiated.<br />
The Townsville Trades and Labor Council has played a major<br />
role since 1888 in defending and enhancing the interests of<br />
the working men and women of North Queensland. It has also<br />
played a massive role in all aspects of the labor movement<br />
at the local, State and Federal levels.<br />
This century of achievement gives us much to celebrate at<br />
tonight's dinner and I am grateful for having been invited<br />
as your guest of honour to join with you in these<br />
celebrations. It's appropriate on such an occasion to reflect on what it<br />
was that motivated those pioneers of the Townsville Trades<br />
and Labor Council not for the purpose of engaging in idle<br />
speculation, but with the serious intention of measuring our<br />
achievements against their expectations, and of using the<br />
experience gained over the last one hundred years as a guide<br />
in preparing ourselves for the next century.<br />
We can establish with the invaluable assistance of<br />
hindsight that these pioneers were motivated, first, by a<br />
perception that prevailing conditions, in their work place<br />
and in the broader society, were unfair and unjust.<br />
And second, they recognised that this unfairness and<br />
injustice is not insuperable but can be overcome through the<br />
processes of peaceful reform if people of goodwill work<br />
together.<br />
10% 9i6 </p>
<p>That is the truth contained in the wards chosen as this<br />
Trades and Labor Council's motto: " Strength United is<br />
Stronger". our pioneers saw that by working together we can<br />
achieve goals far larger than can be achieved by working<br />
separately. This is the great truth of the Labor movement, which<br />
provides the founding principle of every branch, every<br />
union, every Trades and Labor Council.<br />
And it is the truth which underlies the historic Prices and<br />
1 incomes Accord that currently exists between the industrial<br />
and political wings of the labor movement.<br />
It can fairly be said that never in the history of the labor<br />
movement has there been such a close and constructive<br />
partnership between the two wings of our great movement than<br />
there has been since 1983 in the form of the Accord. This<br />
partnership has allowed your Federal Labor Government to<br />
create one million new jobs, to implement massive<br />
improvements in the social wage, and to establish the<br />
foundations for genuine, sustainable, long-term prosperity<br />
in-this country.<br />
The third factor which must have motivated the founders of<br />
this Trades and Labor Council is related to the previous<br />
two: they were determined to seek industrial and political<br />
reforms which would benefit not just their immediate<br />
supporters but the wider community; they were determined to<br />
achieve not gains which could be quickly eroded by time but<br />
permanent gains which would help build a better Australia.<br />
Over our entire history, the Australi'fi Labor Party and the<br />
Australian trade union movement, in all their levels and in<br />
all their forums, have been dedicated to seeking reforms of<br />
that nature.<br />
Just as we have always done, Labor'today is seeking<br />
improvements not just for the present but for the future<br />
achieving reforms in today's world which will make a better<br />
and more prosperous world for our children tomorrow.<br />
I speak to you tonight as Prime Minister of a Government<br />
unashamedly proud of its achievements in this labor<br />
tradition of reform.<br />
we are creating a more efficient and effective economy, a<br />
more efficient and effective industrial relations system and<br />
taxation system, a more efficient and effective system of<br />
educating and training young Australians, and of ensuring<br />
the health and welfare of all Australians.<br />
J There have been reforms achieved in the interest of all<br />
Australians and achieved with the cooperation of all<br />
Australians. Tonight I want to speak to you about another essential<br />
reform task facing Australians: the task of creating a more<br />
effective and relevant Constitution. 1097 </p>
<p>3.<br />
When the six Australian colonies federated in 1901 and<br />
created the Commonwealth of Australia, they established a<br />
system of Government which solved pretty successfully the<br />
problems and rivalries of that process of nation building.<br />
But they did not establish nor could they realistically be<br />
expected to have established a system which would stand<br />
unchanged through the next century.<br />
As Australia becomes a more complex and mature society, and<br />
as the demands of economic decision-making become sharper,<br />
the limitations and shortcomings of the Constitution become<br />
more apparent.<br />
The need for Constitutional reform becomes more pressing.<br />
On 3 September, Australians are being asked to vote on four<br />
referendum proposals. if they approve these proposals,<br />
Australia will be able to enter the 21st Century with a<br />
Constitution which provides a fairer and more up to date<br />
basis for the system of Government we inherited in 1901.<br />
That is why we are seeking support for four proposals which<br />
will: provide for four year maximum terms for both Houses of<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament;<br />
establish fair and democratic Parliamentary elections<br />
throughout Australia;<br />
recognise local government as an integral part of the<br />
system of government in this country; and<br />
extend rights already in the Constitution so that they<br />
effectively cover all Australians.<br />
These proposals cover four separate areas of our<br />
Constitution, but they share one key and overwhelming<br />
element: they are about benefiting people, rather than<br />
empowering governments.<br />
That is the theme which unites these proposals, and it is<br />
the fact which gives me greatest confidence the four<br />
referendums will succeed.<br />
Since 1945, a federal election has been held on average once<br />
every two years. This is universally recognised as too<br />
c ostly, not only in terms of the $ 50 million that is now<br />
spent to hold each election, but also the increased economic<br />
instability and the restraint on good government imposed by<br />
the ever-present prospect of an election.<br />
It is a fact of life that where as in Australia's case at<br />
present and for some time to come economic reconstruction<br />
is needed, the pain always precedes the gain.<br />
So the first referendum seeks 4 year maximum terms for both<br />
Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
1098 </p>
<p>4.<br />
This will allow Governments to take those tough decisions<br />
without being deterred by the short-term criticism those<br />
decisions almost inevitably inspire.<br />
In other words, success for this proposal will ensure that<br />
governments can get on with governing. That is why, over<br />
the last few years, four-year terms have been adopted by<br />
every State Government except perhaps not surprisingly<br />
Queensland. If this referendum succeeds, it will not alter the powers of<br />
the Senate, including its powers to review, amend or reject<br />
legislation. For better or worse, the Senate's power to<br />
force a Government to the polls will remain untouched. But<br />
in such a circumstance, a Senate would itself have to face<br />
the electorate at the same time.<br />
And the proposal will remove one of the chief causes for<br />
early elections in recent years the need to bring the<br />
timing of elections of the two Chambers back into line.<br />
The second proposal for fair elections goes even more<br />
directly to the issue of democracy.<br />
At this point in the late twentieth century, as we celebrate<br />
our Bicentenary, you would think it would be taken for<br />
granted that a democratic government should be based on<br />
equal representation of its citizens.<br />
Yet this is not the position ini'Australia today at least<br />
not in Western Australia, Tasmania and, starkly, here in<br />
Queensland. Indeed, some of the most extraordinary imbalances in the<br />
Queensland electoral system occur here in Townsville:<br />
one of the three most populous Queensland State seats<br />
Thuringowa is located here in Townsville, 1500<br />
kilometres from Brisbane;<br />
it takes more voters to elect the member for Thuringowa<br />
than it does to elect the three members for Roma,<br />
Gregory and Balonne combined;<br />
three seats based in Townsville contain only 10,000<br />
fewer votes than the eight seats which comprise the<br />
Western and Far Northern Zone; the Townsville seats have<br />
an average enrolment of just over 23,000 voters while.<br />
the eight Western and Far Northern seats have an average<br />
of just under 10,000 voters; and<br />
the vote of a Townsville elector in the Thuringowa<br />
electorate is worth only half the vote of a resident of<br />
Charters Towers, one hour's drive away.<br />
The proposed amendments to ensure fair and democratic<br />
elections are simple. 1099<br />
~ 3. </p>
<p>2.~<br />
They will ensure that the number of voters in each<br />
electorate is within 10 per cent of the average number of<br />
voters in all electorates in each State and Territory.<br />
The huge imbalances, the unfair elections, the blatant<br />
denial of individual democratic rights, the Queensland<br />
gerrymander, will all be consigned to the history books.<br />
Redistributions will occur at least every 7 years, or more<br />
frequently when required.<br />
This point must be clearly understood by people in North<br />
Queensland one of the fastest growing regions of<br />
Australia. Without electoral redistributions, for every new<br />
person who decides to settle here, the existing voters<br />
effectively suffer a reduction in the value of their<br />
electoral representation in State Parliament.<br />
In other words without redistributions, Townsville gets<br />
electorally punished for its success as a growth centre.<br />
These amendments do not impose Commonwealth laws on the<br />
States. They impose constitutional requirements on<br />
Commonwealth and State governments alike.<br />
what they will do is protect the rights of the people by<br />
ensuring that their voices are heard equally on election<br />
day, in Federal elections as in State elections, includingfor<br />
the first time in many decades here in Queensland.<br />
Residents of rural Australia do not need a gerrymander to<br />
recognise their invaluable !, contribution to the ' lifestyle and<br />
the prosperity of this State and this nation.<br />
Indeed, it should be seen as an insult to country people<br />
that a gerrymander has for so long been seen as the<br />
substitute for relevant and effective rural policies.<br />
it is my proud claim our proud claim that no Government<br />
more than this Federal Labor Government has provided those<br />
policies to protect and enhance the true welfare of<br />
Australians living outside the major cities.<br />
This proposal also seeks to fill one of the more glaring<br />
gaps in the Constitution its failure to guarantee the<br />
right to vote. Currently, the qualifications for voting in<br />
any election for a parliament are whatever that parliament<br />
chooses. A " yes" vote for this question will ensure that all<br />
Australians have the constitutionally-guaranteed right to<br />
vote, subject to existing legal disqualifications such as<br />
mental incapacity or imprisonment.<br />
In 1988, it is surely tine to enshrine the right to vote in<br />
the document that is the basis of our democratic government.<br />
1100 </p>
<p>6.<br />
The third referendum proposal seeks to provide, at last,<br />
constitutional recognition of the third tier of government<br />
local government.<br />
There are more than 850 local councils around Australia. In<br />
the last financial year they spent more than $ 6.5 billion on<br />
providing the basic community services that only local<br />
government can provide.<br />
The fact is that local government exists, as a valid,<br />
democratic, accountable and respec~ ea-ETer of administration<br />
in Australia. This referendum will provide a long overdue<br />
and thoroughly legitimate recognition of its status in the<br />
Consti-tution.<br />
Local government organisations throughout Australia are<br />
backing this referendum wholeheartedly not least in<br />
decentralised Queensland, where local government has always<br />
played such an important and constructive role in<br />
administration. The Mayor of Brisbane, Sally-Anne Atkinson, has declared her<br />
support for it.<br />
Townsville of course is where the Minister for Local<br />
Government, Senator Margaret Reynolds, cut her teeth in<br />
local government.<br />
So I was particularly pleased to hear that in the last<br />
month, the Townsville City Council lent its support to the<br />
proposal and is now giving practical assistance through<br />
public statements and media releases.<br />
The fourth and final referendum proposal is as simple,<br />
modest and practical, and as equally deserving of support as<br />
the previous three.<br />
This question asks voters to ensure the rights of:<br />
trial by jury for people facing serious criminal<br />
charges; fair compensation for property taken by any government;<br />
and freedom of religion.<br />
The Constitution does not give a right to trial by jury for<br />
offences against State or Territory laws or for a number of<br />
serious Commonwealth offences; and it gives no right to fa * ir<br />
compensation when property is taken by a State, Territory or<br />
local government or by the Commonwealth in a Territory.<br />
There is no common law protection of the right to religious<br />
freedom. This referendum will rectify each of these shortcomings. 1101<br />
, FJ </p>
<p>A<br />
My friends,<br />
Each of these four proposals stands as a valuable and<br />
significant element in a much overdue renovation of<br />
Australia's Constitution.<br />
Together however they represent something even larger what<br />
I referred to earlier as their shared intention of<br />
benefiting not Governments, not Canberra, not any political<br />
party but, simply, the people.<br />
Since federation, thirty eight referendums have been put to<br />
the Australian people, of which only eight have been<br />
approved. I have never believed that this poor track record accurately<br />
reflects the capacity of the Australian community to achieve<br />
sensible and vital Constitutional change.<br />
in the past, referendum proposals all too often seemed to<br />
emerge from on high, without prior consultation with those<br />
who were being called upon to vote on them.<br />
It was a process almost guaranteed to arouse the suspicions<br />
of the political opponents of the Government of the day, as<br />
well as of those cynics who automatically interpret any<br />
change as a plot to enhance the power of Canberra.<br />
They were seen as having been fornulated by politicians for<br />
politicians. our proposals have been developed by the people for the<br />
people. In 1985 we established the Constitutional Commission a<br />
bipartisan community-based group to study what could be<br />
done to achieve essential constitutional reform.<br />
Specifically, they have been developed by the Constitutional<br />
Commission, chaired by the former Solicitor-General, Sir<br />
Maurice Byers, on the basis of an unprecedented process of<br />
public consultations.<br />
Contrast this against the stance being taken on these<br />
referendums by the opposition.<br />
I can't help thinking of Robert Menzies, efforts in 1944,<br />
during the Curtin years, to create the Liberal Party. In a<br />
speech in Canberra in that-year he had this to say of the<br />
contribution the conservative Opposition had been making:<br />
far too many questions we have found our role to<br />
be simply that of the man who says there is<br />
no room in Australia for a party of reaction. There is<br />
no useful place for a:. policy of negation."<br />
1102* </p>
<p>That was Robert Mlenzies in 1944. But there must be a large<br />
number of Liberals who agree with those sentiments today,<br />
and who are appalled to see their party's current position<br />
on these referendums.<br />
Because now the Liberals have turned the full circle; here<br />
they are again, more than four decades later, as the party<br />
of reaction, confronting new challenges with the oldest word<br />
in their dictionary: " no"<br />
what is even more astonishing is that they are saying " no"<br />
to proposals which they actually support.<br />
The Federal Liberals in the past have urged constitutional<br />
recognition of local government. Now it is actually<br />
proposed in a referendum, they oppose it.<br />
They have urged extending the rights of trial by jury for<br />
serious offences and fair compensation for property acquired<br />
compulsorily by government but now these are proposed in<br />
referendum, they oppose them.<br />
The Liberals have supported longer parliamentary terms. But<br />
now, asked to support a referendum to achieve that very<br />
reform, they oppose it on spurious grounds about an<br />
alleged attack on the powers of the Senate.<br />
The Liberals have also supported the concept of one vote<br />
one value. But again, given the chance to achieve that<br />
reform, their support has turned to opposition.<br />
That's a reversal of policy that a number of Liberals<br />
including the Queensland Liberal leader, Angus mines,<br />
haven't been able to stomach.<br />
As in so many issues, what the leaders of the Party say is<br />
being questioned and undermined from within the Party.<br />
The reason for this series of reversals and somersaults<br />
attests to the leadership vacuum in the Federal Liberal<br />
Party quite simply, John Howard was rolled in the party<br />
room by the Nationals. His principled support for<br />
constitutional reform like so many of the erstwhile Howard<br />
principles has been jettisoned in favour of shortsighted,<br />
self-defeating determination to oppose for the sake of<br />
opposing. To hide its cynicism, the opposition makes the extraordinary<br />
claim that these proposals constitute a grab for power by<br />
Canberra. As I have said in the past, the truth is that opposition to<br />
the proposals means reann the privileges and -poweorfs<br />
politicians and entrhig the inefficiencies of the<br />
present system: 1103 </p>
<p>Opposition to the four year term proposal means support<br />
for disrupting the nation with elections far more<br />
frequently than even our Constitutional founders would<br />
have expected or ever intended.<br />
opposition to the one vote-one value proposal means<br />
allowing politicians to retain the power to manipulate<br />
electoral boundaries.<br />
Opposition to the local government proposal means<br />
turning a blind eye to the existence of the third tier<br />
of government and refusing the benefits of closer<br />
cooperation among Local, State and Federal Governments.<br />
opposition to the rightd and freedoms proposal means<br />
allowing State politicians to retain the capacity to<br />
deny people a number of essential rights.<br />
For too long, the people have been absent from the<br />
mainstream of the Constitution-making and<br />
Constitution-changing processes of this nation.<br />
On 3 September, I believe the people will return to that<br />
mainsttream. By giving constitutional reform back to the people, we have<br />
ensured that the issues being put on 3 September reflect<br />
their priorities.<br />
if these four proposals succeed, the real winners will be<br />
the people of Australia.<br />
My friends,<br />
one hundred years ago, with the foundation of this Trades<br />
and Labor Council, oiar forebears showed they were men and<br />
women with a vision of the future.<br />
They were determined to ensure they were not hidebound by<br />
the unsatisfactory patterns of the past.<br />
Subsequent generations have been the beneficiaries of their<br />
vision and determination. Today, we are their beneficiaries<br />
and that gives us a responsibility to continue their work<br />
of reform.<br />
This referendum campaign offers us a tangible means of<br />
fulfilling that responsibility and it is an opportunity we<br />
cannot afford to forego.<br />
