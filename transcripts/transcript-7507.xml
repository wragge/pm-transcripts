PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PRINCE OF WALES BAY, HOBART,<br />
FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Directors of International<br />
Catamaran Services asked you for a fair hearing I suppose on<br />
the fuel excise rebate?<br />
PM: They have raised the matter with me and they have left<br />
me with a sumbission. I'll have a look at it. I didn't<br />
make them any promises other than that I would read very<br />
carefully their submission.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do they have a valid argument?<br />
PM: They certainly think they have and I've got no more to<br />
say than that I've promised them that I will very carefully<br />
read their submission. They're obviously an enterprise<br />
which deserves the consideration of anything they've put to<br />
you because they've shown that they are a remarkable<br />
enterprise. I'm very proud of them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think a development such as the tourist<br />
ferry on Bass Strait is good for tourism in Australia?<br />
PM: Yes, it's obviously going to be beneficial both in<br />
terms of increased speed, lower cost and what's exciting for<br />
me about it is not just the service they are providing here<br />
across the Bass Strait but the demonstration that they've<br />
already given of their capacity to establish an enormous<br />
export market. I mean they have got orders now for ferries<br />
in the Irish Sea and all over the place, so they've got<br />
something here which at this stage is unique in the world.<br />
There's no-one else like it and so I just have nothing but<br />
praise for them and wish them well.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, the front page of the<br />
Australian said today that ALP strategists were talking<br />
about a September election.<br />
PM: Were they? They haven't talked to me about it. I<br />
mean, I'll probably have something to do with it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it interest you, that date? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM4: Look, I've got nothing to add to what I've said, and I<br />
haven't been coy about it, the election will be held<br />
somewhere from the latter part of this year up until May of<br />
next year. Now I haven't been playing funny fellows with<br />
that, it'll be in there sometime and when we have it,<br />
we'll win.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, for the second time you've held out<br />
the hope that pensioners, that they think they might be<br />
better off c me the next poll. Can you elaborate on that<br />
hint a bit?<br />
PM: Yes, what I can say is this. Let me make it clear, we<br />
are not responding to some suggested grey power or anything<br />
like that. I not only reject that suggestion but find it<br />
offensive because I established with Brian Howe some couple<br />
of years ago now, an expert inquiry under Professor Bettina<br />
Cass. She brought down a very very considered and relevant<br />
report on retirement incomes. So what we did then was to<br />
establish, under Brian Howe and officials, a consultative<br />
force which is talking with pensioner organisations and with<br />
the superannuation industry. In addition to that I<br />
establshed a backbench committee which is going around the<br />
country listening to individual pensioners and groups of<br />
them. Now that's been underway for a very very long period<br />
of time and all I can say is that in the relatively near<br />
future I'll be receiving the reports from those two groups<br />
and out of our consideration of those reports certain<br />
advances will be made which will add to the very proud<br />
record we have in this area. I remind you the time has come<br />
in which the Australian community can compare and contrast<br />
the records of the conservatives and Labor over a similar<br />
period of time. Under the conservatives the real value of<br />
the pension declined by that 2 1/ 2 percent and my<br />
Government, it's increased by 7.7 percent. The period when<br />
Mr Howard was Treasurer, real decline in the value of<br />
pensions, 4.1 percent, up 7.7 percent under us and we are<br />
going to do more and they are going to talk.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if we could just switch to the Wesley<br />
Vale pulp mill. What concerns did the State branch of the<br />
Labor Party raise with you this morning?<br />
PM: obvious ones, obvious ones about the environment and I<br />
listened with interest to what they've got to say and what<br />
they are putting will be part of the whole matrix of<br />
consideration that we take into account when the decision of<br />
the Tasmanian Parliament comes to us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was the discussed?<br />
PM: No.<br />
