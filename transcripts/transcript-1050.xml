01 01 SPEECH BY THE PRI14E MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES KT, CH, QC, MP, AT THE<br />
ENGLISH SPEAKING UI ION, LONDON ON THE<br />
OCCASION OF THE MAUNCHING OF TT E OJINSTON<br />
CHURCHILL MEMORIAL TRUST APPEAL 1ST FEBRUARY, 1265<br />
What we are proposing to do in Australia is to set<br />
about having an appeal which will probably open and close on<br />
one day February 28th, 1965.<br />
You may think this is a little dramatic but we are<br />
celebrating a very dramatic man. Of course donations will be<br />
received and are, I believe already being received before<br />
February 28th. But our modes ambition is that by the close<br />
of that day, we in Australia will have raised Å CA1, OOO, OOO.<br />
We believe that we will. We believe that if we can do that,<br />
much larger sums of money can be expected from much larger and<br />
richer countries, Now having said that, may I say this to you in the<br />
broad. I went down the other day to Westminster Hall and I<br />
was pleased to see how many young men and women and boys and<br />
girls were passing through Westinster Hall, because you<br />
know, men are easily forgotten and the names of even il<br />
greatest of men may suffer some kind of eclipse for a while,<br />
But it is vital that this name should never be<br />
forgotten and it is vital that this man should never be<br />
forgotten. It is vital that his spirit, touched with immortality<br />
as it was, should continue to be immortal, a living thing,<br />
a continiiing presence among many generations to come in<br />
countries which speak the Eriglish language a language in<br />
which he, by the miracle of scionce, was able to address so<br />
mreaanyc hsincgo rethse man, d tosuccohreins g otfh emmi, l liionnssp iroifn gp etohpelme ddurriivnign gthe war,<br />
pessimism underground, None of us who lived through all this<br />
could ever forget it. I think we have a groat task here to<br />
see that it is never forgotten.<br />
Sometimes in the course of one's life one incurs a<br />
debt and the debt may perhaps be discharged by one blow, by<br />
one payment, by one act, but this is not a debt of that kind.<br />
This is a debt which is part of our inheritance; it will never<br />
be fully discharged. If our grandchildren and great-grandchildren are living<br />
in freedom, they will be his debtors, because at the crucial*<br />
moment in modern history it was he more than anybody else who<br />
inspired the public will and who made victory a certainty.<br />
This is a continuing debt, and a continuing debt is not paid<br />
merely by having monument, great thougia it may be, merely by<br />
having some inscription on some tablet in some place. It maust<br />
be paid in a continuing fashion.<br />
And that is the beauty of this conception which was<br />
worked out here in this country and was taken to us and to<br />
other people and was understood and acted upon. This is a<br />
marvellous conception because in 200 years' time, there will<br />
be Churchill fellows, men and women of all sorts of colours,<br />
all sorts of religious beliefs, all sorts of experiences, ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
some of them on a high level of academaic learning andsvme of<br />
them in the practising field of ordinary industry and ordinary<br />
life thousands of thoem, as time goes by, who will corry this<br />
gre at name this proud name, and who will regard it as a matter<br />
of honour to think of him and to perpetuate his memory,<br />
This is a wonderful way of securing a continuing<br />
payment of a continuing debt, and I think that if it is looked<br />
, at in this way, this appeal will be a great success. Its<br />
results will go on.<br />
I trust that as time goes on its funds will be enriched<br />
from time to time by people who see it with the eye of<br />
imaginotion and will be proud of discharging a debt, How<br />
valuable this isl How important this is!<br />
We have looked at in this way in my country, and the<br />
people engaged in the central Connittee in the various bodies<br />
which have been set up cover the full range.<br />
We have not cast the not narrowly we have cast it<br />
wide and I am happy we have had the enthusiastic support of<br />
all. That makes this a notable, historic occasion because<br />
it is the launching of proposals to honour in that abiding<br />
fashion the most historic person whom you or I ever knew or are<br />
ever likely to know# </p>
