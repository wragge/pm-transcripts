The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, said today the<br />
policies of the Queensland Government were pushing up prices.<br />
" The States have the power to control prices but<br />
Mr. Bjelke-' etorsen refusob to use this power," Mr. Whitlam<br />
said. " lie ca,; ipaigned against our referendum last year to<br />
give the. national government the power to control prices."<br />
" Yet prices in Queensland arerasing faster than in<br />
any other State." " South Australia, whore there is a Labor Government,<br />
has used its powers effectively to check the land price spiral."<br />
" This is something every State can do."<br />
" If the Queensland Government co-operated with us<br />
in setting up a Land Commission, as the three Liberal States<br />
are doing, we could reduce the price of land for the home<br />
buyer." " If the Queensland Government allowed the Australian<br />
National Line to operate between Queensland ports it could cut<br />
shipping freights. " If Mr. B3jolke-Petersen accepted our offer to take<br />
financial responsibility for State railways, we could cut<br />
the cost of rail freights."<br />
" If he co-operated with our plan to reduce electricity<br />
costs in Queensland we could check price rises over a vast<br />
range of goods." " Hie refuse$ to work effectively with officials from<br />
other States in formulating anti-inflationary policies."<br />
" There is a limit to what any Government can do to<br />
check prices in a world-wide inflationary situation, but<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen does nothing."<br />
