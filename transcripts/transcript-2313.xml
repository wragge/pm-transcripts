Edited Transcript ANINUAL CONVENTION OF THE 14. S. W. YOUNG<br />
LIBERALS SYDNEY, N. S. IN. 17 OCTOBER 1970<br />
Speeh b ! nim ister, Mr. on Gorton<br />
I think you will agree that this is neither the time nor the place for a long<br />
dissertation on political matters. I am here primarily to express, on behali of the<br />
Government, our gratitude for the assistance we receive from the Young Liberal<br />
Movement throughout Australia.<br />
I don't agree with the speaker who said that we are a pretentious country, or<br />
a country with an inflated idea of our own importance. We may be a little brash, perhaps:<br />
and brashness is a good thing in a young country. We have got something to be a little<br />
brash about, when you consider that in such a short space of time as far as history<br />
goes in the blinking of an eye a harsh continent has been translated into one which is<br />
giving as . high a standard of living to the people in it as any other country in the world<br />
and as great an opportunity as any other country in the world. Now this is something<br />
of which we need not be ashamed.<br />
We also have frontiers and there are not many countries left that have them.<br />
I will admit that too many young Australians stay away in droves from the frontiers.<br />
I am talking of the mining towns in Western Australia, I am talking of the new<br />
developments in Queensland, I am talking of going out where something new is being<br />
built and something new is happening and people can work very hard and get very<br />
high rewards. Well those are frontiers and they are there for those who want to take<br />
advantage of them and the very fact they are there is, I think, of sign~ ificance, in our<br />
national life. So I don't think we are pretentious, and I do think we have ar. agportunity<br />
here as a community of people seeking the answer to the age-old questions of how can<br />
a community best be run.<br />
We have an opportunity to present to the world a pattern which might be<br />
better than any pattern so far devised and therefore I don't think we are pretentious,<br />
though we may be brash. I don't think we have an Inflated idea -of our own importance<br />
because although we haven't got great physical power,, we do have enormous opportunity<br />
and I think the achievements we have already made augur well for the future for the<br />
Young Liberals and the other young members of the Australian community coming<br />
on with them. Nor do I think the Young Liberal movement is without a cause. After all,<br />
there has been a history now of some twenty years of Liberal rule, and of course<br />
all the decisions made in that time were not right and of course some opportunities<br />
during that time were missed. But by and large, most of the decisiorns were<br />
reasonably correct and most of the opportunities were seized and the advancement<br />
that has taken place In that period of time is probably unparalleled in a similar period<br />
of time in any other nation's history. e. a. / 2 </p>
<p>We have reached in this nation towards giving to the individual more opportunities<br />
to express himself in whatever field of endeavour he may wish to engage. Vie have<br />
advanced our material development enormously, and that is important, because only<br />
by advancing materially can you take resources to help the poor and the under<br />
privileged and advance other non-material requirements of a nation. And it not a<br />
reasonable cause to want to continue, and to improve, what has been, I think on any<br />
impartial observer's judgment, very successful indeed. Surely we viould riot be able<br />
now to have ten thousand members of Young Liberals throughout Australia if there<br />
were not achievements to which they could look and which they would seek to better in<br />
the years ahead. So there Is a cause, a significant cause to defend Australia, to<br />
advance Australia, to improve the material benefits of Australia, and to further advance<br />
the non-material requirements of a nation.<br />
I have heard, from time to time, talk of something which is described as a<br />
generation gap. And people who have spoken about it have spoken as if this is some new<br />
phenomenon just suddenly discovered, never having occurred before in the history of<br />
the world. Well, I don't think, for myself, there is a generation gap. I disagree<br />
violently with a lot of young people and a lot of young people disagree violently with<br />
me. But then a lot d-young people disagree violently with a lot of other young people,<br />
and so it is not a matter of a gap between generations. It is a matter of argum-. ents<br />
advanced and arguments rejected and discussion on those arguments.<br />
I can't see myself that there are any new theories advanced which can't be<br />
discussed between the generations. I haven't discovered that, and I hope that by and<br />
large, you haven't discovered that either. There has always been Some difficulty of<br />
communication between parents and children. Always-, Because parents have got into<br />
the habit while the children were very young and while they were growing up, of telling<br />
them what they ought to do instead of sitting down and discussing with them whether<br />
they ought to eat their supper or whether they ought to go to bed at seven'. They have<br />
got into the habit of telling them what they ought to do and it is a little difficult<br />
sometimes for parents to realise that children have reached an age where that no<br />
longer obtains. But this has always been so.<br />
It has also always been true that at a particular period of development young<br />
people thought that their parents knew absolutely nothing, understood absolutely<br />
nothlng, were as dead as a dodo, And then it has also been true that a little later on<br />
when young people have grown up a little bit and when parents have mellowed a little<br />
bit, it has been possible for discussion to take place and for young people to say,<br />
" My gosh. My parents have learned a lot in the last ten years, or five years".<br />
I think it's nonsense.. that's all I want to say about the generation gap. Surely<br />
whatever age anybody is, it is their mind that counts), their ability that counts,<br />
the capacity to analyse that counts and there ought to be able to be a dialogue between<br />
somebody of sixty and somebody of sixteen, given those circumstances. 9 e. / 3 </p>
<p>And there are many things on which dialogue should take place in this country.<br />
Many think now that all that is required is questioning of the society in which they live<br />
criticism, which is quite proper and questioning. B-ut that can't go on for too long,<br />
because the very passage of time itself means that before long, those who today are<br />
questioning, and having the luxury df questioning,. will tomorrow be saddled with the<br />
sometimes agonising discipline of providin,; the answers to the questions they are now<br />
asking. I think it augurs well for Australia that there are groups Of young -people such<br />
as this who now question, but who in questioning are learning because they wiant to be<br />
able to contribute the answers tomorrow will demand. And this again is a reason why<br />
I am so pleased to be here. I will sketch some of the problems that I see will need<br />
to be answered in the years ahead, and these are just some briefly touched on samples.<br />
We hear much today about the question of dissent and the question of how far<br />
dissent should be allowed to go. For myself, I would suggest that dissent mnust be<br />
protected, that there must never be any interference with the right of people to object<br />
to what a government is doing, to attack what a government is doing, to march i~ f they<br />
want to, in order to bring attention to their objection to what a government is doing.<br />
Thbis is a freedom which is essential. But freedom can degenerate into licence at some<br />
stage, and for myself, I don't believe this right should be extended to licence. I don't<br />
believe such a rights of other people are invaded and rejected by those who, wish to<br />
dissent. I think people ought to be able to use the post offices if they want to; I believe<br />
people ought to be able to use the streets if they want to. I believe they should be able<br />
to drive cars and walk-along footpaths and indeed what I am saying is that there are<br />
civil rights for the majority, and those civil rights are as important as are the rights<br />
of a minority to dissent.<br />
This may not be easy and simple finally to clarify. Nevertheless, this is a<br />
question before us now. It will be before us in the future, and we must in this nation,<br />
I believe, reach a solution which will enable both rights to exist and which will prevent<br />
a repetition of what we have seen in other countries o! people in brown-shirts taking<br />
over the streets as bully boys, and people in red-shirts fighting them in the streets so<br />
that all that happens is a difference in the colour of the shirt, and riot a reasoned<br />
argument.... but a situation where the decision goes to those with the greatest muscle<br />
rather than those with the greatest right or the greatest capacity to persuade their<br />
fellow citizens. We will have in the years ahead, problems concerned with what some people<br />
claim to be a racist approach by Australia in the field of immigration.<br />
And this is not a simple or an easy matter. We have a restricted immigration<br />
programme. A policy under which it is easier for a p.: erson with a white skin to enter<br />
Australia than it is for a person of a different colour.<br />
That policy is under attack. I cannot justify it on moral grounds. F'or the<br />
kindniess or cruelty, the competence of incompetence, the worthiness or unworthiness<br />
of man can surely not be judged by the colour of their skins. / 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
Yet though I cannot justify the policy on moral grounds, as I look around the<br />
world I see that wherever there are large communities of different racial origins in<br />
a country, racial problems in that country are greatly increased.<br />
These racial Droblems are not jut betweell those with white okins and those<br />
with black, as in America or Britain but between, -for example, Chinese and Indonesians,<br />
Chinese and Malaya-0. s, Tamils and Ceylonese, Kenyans and Indians,<br />
If it is true that in these circumstances, racial policy is exacerbated and racist<br />
stresses increased, then I do not wish to import these problems into this country; as<br />
I am sure I would do if large communities of different racial origins were established<br />
here. Indeed I think that it would be more immoral to do this than to continue with cur<br />
present policy. I think that it would lead to a growth of racist feeling in Australia whereas we<br />
do not have such feeling now.<br />
But there is a difficult moral problem on which, in the fulniess of time, it will<br />
be for those who are now young Liberals, and young Australians ger. erally to decide.<br />
As for me, I make it clear that I am not going to chiai'ge our present liberalised policy<br />
in any way. And then we will have in the years ahead many, many discussions as to what is<br />
the proper role of a central government and what Io the proper role ofi' a state government.<br />
I have found myself that on this particular problem, the Young Liberals seem to be<br />
more conservative than the people who formed the Party in 1949, and on the whole, adopt<br />
the conservative attitude without giving very many reasons for it as to why that attitude<br />
is adopted: Well, fair enough.<br />
I offer no solution -here, none at all. But I do say that for the proper running<br />
of this nation in the years ahead this is a significant question and one which ought to<br />
attract the attention and the analysis of the young people of Australia who w~ ill, before<br />
long, be in a position where they will have to take sonrie real stand Oan it. I won't<br />
develop that, but I do believe that it is of significance for our whole future.<br />
So all these things those are but some samples all these and many others<br />
will be before us in the years ahead. Many problemo have been overcome and many<br />
more, I think, shortly will be. But there will be no nation ever, and Australia certainly<br />
will never be a nation that has not got new problems before it, new answers required.<br />
And it will only get those answers to the problems now and in the future if there are<br />
sufficient numbers of young people prepared to devote their minds and their efforts<br />
and their attitudes to trying to work out what the best answers in the interests of<br />
the nation may be.<br />
I think I will finish as I began, having given you I hope some indication of why<br />
I am so happy to be with you tonight and having given you I hope some indication that you<br />
really have a cause and that that cause is significant and more significant to you than<br />
it is to me and more significant to your children generally than it will be for me.<br />
Thank you for having me. </p>
