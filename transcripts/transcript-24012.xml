    <content><![CDATA[<p>Your Excellencies, parliamentary colleagues, men and women of our armed forces, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is a proud day for our Navy and a proud day for our country and I am so thrilled to be on this mighty ship.</p>
<p>We are a nation girt by sea. So it is the Royal Australian Navy that guarantees the security of this continent, the free passage of our trade and the safety of our citizens.</p>
<p>While Australia always seeks to make friends rather than foes we can never know what is over the horizon.</p>
<p>The world remains a difficult and dangerous place. Our armed forces deserve the best possible equipment; our friends, our neighbours should know they have the strongest possible ally.</p>
<p>So, <em>HMAS</em> <em>Canberra</em> is our largest ever warship. It is one of the most capable and sophisticated amphibious assault ships in the world. She can also be deployed for humanitarian assistance if disaster strikes our region.</p>
<p>I pay tribute to my predecessor, The Honourable John Howard for initiating this project.</p>
<p>It is fitting that we today acknowledge the presence amongst us of Lieutenant Commander Henry Hall, a veteran of the first <em>HMAS Canberra</em>.</p>
<p>That first <em>Canberra</em> was the only foreign Naval vessel to give its name to a ship of the United States Navy â a sure sign that our Navy protects not only our own country but our friends and our allies too.</p>
<p>Canberra is the home of our democracy. The 84 who died aboard the gallant <em>HMAS Canberra</em> in the 1942 battle of Savo Island remind us that we owe our freedom to the courage of those who serve under our flag.</p>
<p>I know the crew of this <em>Canberra</em> will serve with equal professionalism and patriotism.</p>
<p>May this new <em>Canberra</em> serve for Queen and Country with duty and honour.</p>
<p>Godspeed to her and best wishes to her crew.</p>
<p>Long may she serve the people of this island continent.</p>
