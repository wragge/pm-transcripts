PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW/ TAILKBACK WITH DIANA WARNOCK,<br />
RADIO 6W?, 13 MARCH 1990<br />
E AND 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WARNOCK; The polls as well as that big undecided vote also<br />
show disillusionment and cynicism with the major parties and<br />
move to the independents. Why do you think that has<br />
happened, how much blame do you take for the fact that you<br />
seem to be dealing with a cynical electorate this time<br />
around. PM: Well I think this is somewhat overstated, I have said<br />
Diana that I think one of the main reasons for the move to<br />
votes for the non major parties is the issue of the<br />
environment. I think that is a fact not only in Australia<br />
but around the world if you want to find one particular issue<br />
I think that is it.<br />
WARNOCK: You don't think that there is any reason f or them<br />
to be cynical about both major parties.<br />
PM: Certainly there is reason for them to be cynical about<br />
the Liberal and National parties. As I have said they have<br />
manifestly proved themselves incapable of governing<br />
themselves. They are so bitterly internally divided that the<br />
electorate is entitled to be cynical if people can't as I<br />
have said govern themselves, they can't govern the country.<br />
I don't think there is any reason to be cynical about the<br />
gdv-ernment I mean if you want to look at the sorts of things<br />
that are relevant to people's welfare let's look at them, 1.6<br />
million new jobs which is a creation of jobs twice as fast as<br />
the rest of the world and almost two and three of our kids<br />
staying on in school now as against one and three when we<br />
came into office, investment at the highest level that we<br />
have had in history which means we are re-equipping ourselves<br />
to become more competitive so we can export more goods. if<br />
you look at those sorts of things, if you look at the fact<br />
that in the last three years we have had a $ 17 billion </p>
<p>2. PM4: ( cont'd) surplus that I have done there what has never<br />
been done before in the history of this country. Ok we have<br />
had to do some tough things and I don't like that. We have<br />
had to have interest rates high during this last 12 months or<br />
more but that is not for fun. I mean Bob Hawke is not a<br />
person who wants to hurt himself and he certainly doesn't<br />
want to hurt his fellow Australians but we have had to have<br />
high interest rates otherwise we would have Just been<br />
importing more goods than we could sustain, but our interest<br />
rates are going to come down.<br />
WARNOCK(: Sure nonetheless well I will leave that to people<br />
to decide because we have heard almost ad infinitum what both<br />
parties have had to say about those interest rates during the<br />
election campaign. Nonetheless there remain a very large<br />
core of undecided voters, the Democrats too seem to be<br />
polling an awful lot more than they usually do. They can<br />
expect a much higher vote this time I would suggest. Now<br />
there has been some rather bad news for the Labor Party this<br />
time in that the Democrats in Western Australia and I am sure<br />
you would agree it's a very important state for Labor and for<br />
the ' coalition, the Democrats have decided that they will give<br />
their preferences, they will go against sitting members.<br />
Well obviously there are more sitting members who are Labor,<br />
members here in Western Australia that's a bit of a blow<br />
isn't it.<br />
PM: Well you have to ask yourself whether in fact the<br />
Democrats are going to be able to retain their vote because<br />
the simple fact is if that were done what the Democrats in<br />
Western Australia would be asking voters in voting Democrat<br />
to do would be to vote f or more uranium mining, to vote for<br />
uranium enrichment industry, to vote for mining in Kakadu, to<br />
vote for the abolition of Medicare, to vote for the abolition<br />
of the capital gains tax and these things one had understood<br />
the Democrats were passionately opposed to. But the simple<br />
fact is if they give their second preference to the Liberal<br />
and National Party to bring in a government of Liberal and<br />
National Party the Democrats in Western Australia would have<br />
been voting for all those things, for uranium mining, uranium<br />
enrichment, mining in Kakadu, abolition of Medicare. Now how<br />
serious are the Democrats here. I mean the Democrats in the<br />
rest of Australia are furious with them the Green Movement is<br />
furious with them and they have got to ask themselves a<br />
question how dinkum. are they, they have got to ask themselves<br />
do they really believe that people are going to take them<br />
seriously if they are asking people through the Democrats to<br />
vote for mining in Kakadu, uranium enrichment industry.<br />
That's what the West Australian Democrats stand for, is it?<br />
WARNOCK; I would have thought however, that there were<br />
already bad signs for the Labor Party in Thomastown that byelection<br />
in recent months. I believe that the Democrat vote<br />
went 60/ 40 to the Liberals there instead of as it has in the<br />
past 60/ 40 to the Labor Party. It could be very damaging to<br />
you. PM: Thomastown is history Diana, if you </p>
<p>3. PM: The Liberals took it as a sign though. Tony Eggleton<br />
was saying this morning<br />
PM: If the Liberals want to take it as a sign then what<br />
happened there is the Liberals came last so I am quite happy<br />
if they take it as a sign, quite happy if they take it as a<br />
sign.<br />
WARNOCK: We will " be taking calls in just a moment. There<br />
are one or two other things I do want to ask you about. it's<br />
obviously no accident that you and Andrew Peacock have spent<br />
rather a lot of time in Western Australia during the<br />
campaign. Is WA though still a disaster area, a danger zone<br />
for the Labor Party do you think?<br />
PM: I haven't changed my planning about my campaigning,<br />
Andrew has. I had always intended,, the planning was laid<br />
down to come to WA the number of times that I have. The fact<br />
that Mr Peacock is changing his planning as coming over here<br />
reflects what their researchers told them, and that research<br />
has told them that the easy assumption they made last year<br />
that West Australians were mugs, that was the easy assumption<br />
they made they just said West Australians are mugs they are<br />
just going to, because they have been unhappy with certain<br />
things about the West Australian state government as it was<br />
they are going to vote for Andrew Peacock. That was always a<br />
stupid assumption f or them to make and I am not saying this<br />
now I said this months ago, said it publicly and now they<br />
have come to understand that what Hawks said was right that<br />
West Australians aren't mugs that they are not simply going<br />
to say I a West Australian voter within the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia am going to give myself a kick in the backside by<br />
voting for Andrew Peacock because I may have been unhappy<br />
with something that a previous premier did.<br />
WARNOCK: Well there was some other rather bad news for Labor<br />
concerning Western Australia recently when Graeme Campbell<br />
the member for Kalgoorlie made some very frank comments about<br />
Senator Richardson. That can't have been very helpful.<br />
PM: Well it's been talked about, it's certainly, I mean it<br />
hasn't got'me terribly excited Diana and I have said Graeme<br />
Campbell is a bit of a maverick and got that reputation if<br />
it's a question of the reputation of Graham Richardson being<br />
on the line his achievements are so obvious and outstanding<br />
and recognised here and around Australia. if you look at the<br />
poll and if you look at the Westpoll today on the issue of<br />
Strark Bay which is a thing that got Campbell going look at<br />
the poll what did the poll show, it showed an overwhelming<br />
majority of people in favour for the decision so I am not, I<br />
mean obviously I would rather he hadn't said what he did but<br />
a non event, a non issue.<br />
WARNOCK Well the Greens and the unions have declared<br />
perhaps rather predictably for Labor, but the pilots, the<br />
pharmacists and some tourism industry operators perhaps </p>
<p>WARNOCK: ( cont'd) others as well seem to be against you. How<br />
influential do you think these endorsements and attacks are<br />
during the campaign.<br />
PM: As I said the fact that the remnants of the pilots<br />
federation have set themselves up as Andrew's army is no<br />
minus for me. Don't let's forget what the issue is. These<br />
are the people, these remnants that are blarring around<br />
wherever I go now, these remnants. It's very simple<br />
opposition that they wanted just 12 months ago, they were<br />
going to murder the Australian economy 30% wage increase they<br />
were going to take on the unions, the arbitration system,<br />
their employers, the government, everyone and they were going<br />
to get 30%. Well a great overwhelming majority of Australian<br />
people said not on your nelly, you are not going to destroy<br />
the system and these people are paying the price for their<br />
own silliness in trying to set themselves apart, airline<br />
systems are operating the people are back at work and it was<br />
always going to be the case that they could not, Australians<br />
not just Bob Hawke but Australians were not going to allow<br />
them to win that and the fact that they are now getting up<br />
and saying you know vote f or Andrew and put Labor last is no<br />
WARNOCK: Well the pharmacists are also campaigning against<br />
you very vigorously in some electorates.<br />
PM; In some but the pharmacists have to look at themselves.<br />
I mean the pharmacists through their organisation solemnly<br />
put in writing their commitment to call off this campaign of<br />
duress. Now these people simply Are people whose word means<br />
nothing and they will be judged accordingly. They have got a<br />
full review going on before the tribunal. The tribunal as a<br />
condition of having the review required them to give an<br />
undertaking that this duress would be taken of f. Their<br />
organisation over the signature of their president said that<br />
is what they would do now they are breaking their word. I<br />
don't think Australian people like people who break their<br />
word like that.<br />
CALLER; Iam an immigrant from South Africa, been here 7<br />
years, parents have recently visited us. Now to my knowledge<br />
we used to have an air link to South Africa I know why it was<br />
stopped but this used to be a 12 hour f light f rom here to<br />
Johannesburg. I think we used to have 4 f lights a week.<br />
Mum and Dad had to suddenly go back because my young brother<br />
had a heart attack, they got on a Qantas flight it took them<br />
28-hours to get from Perth to Johannesburg. Now we just felt<br />
that was terrible, now I don't know what we can do about<br />
that. Secondly interest rates and cost of living. To my<br />
calculations, now I am not an economist or anything like that<br />
but just my ordinary working life and home life I feel that<br />
my cost of living has gone up by 19%, how does one work out<br />
the inflation, thanks Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: On the f irst point you are quite right we did have<br />
direct air links before we cut them out, we cut them out for </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) a very simple reason it is part of a worldwide<br />
repugnance against the abhorrent system of apartheid, we have<br />
imposed sanctions arnd pressures upon South Africa and I am<br />
proud of the fact that Australia-has been in the forefront of<br />
that move and I am particularly proud of the fact that as a<br />
result of what we in collaboration with the Commonwealth<br />
countries have done and countries outside the Commonwealth<br />
tkt hat frpR FI1ra iS int. v InflfI. d&amp; sLL. L.<br />
Bi n ticant change in South Africa so that the country which<br />
was unique in the world in imposing a ban upon the capacity<br />
of people to participate in government simply on the colour<br />
of their skin is now moving toward negotiation and dialogue<br />
which hopefully will lead to South Africa becoming a multi<br />
racial democracy so you will get no measure, no change out of<br />
me at all on that one. The facts are very very simple that<br />
what we have done in collaboration with others has meant<br />
that at long last fortunately South Africa is moving in a way<br />
which I hope will lead to it being able to rejoin the<br />
international family of nations and no one hopes for that<br />
more fervently than I do and if that happens and of course we<br />
0 whialvle hita veth eamir wliitnhk sa, cwoeu nwtirlyl whhaivceh sips oretnintgit leldin ksto anbde wpea rwt ilolf<br />
the international family of nations. Now second question<br />
about interest rates, facts there very simple. We have since<br />
we have been in government, since 83, we have followed a<br />
economic policy of growth and that growth has given us a<br />
situation where we have created jobs, 1.6 million new jobs<br />
and that is five times faster than it was before, it's twice<br />
as fast as the rest of the world and it's led to record<br />
investment, we are having our industry now re-equipping<br />
itself, we are competing now in manufactured exports around<br />
the world in a way that's never been done before. We are<br />
exporting cars and car parts to Japan and the United States,<br />
ship building industries, exporting ships around the world,<br />
pharmaceutical industry, a whole range of things and that<br />
growth in fact achieved such proportions last year that we<br />
had to tighten monetary policy because if we hadn't we simply<br />
would have been bringing into the country more imports than<br />
we could possibly afford so we had to Blow things down. Now<br />
I haven't liked doing that but the alternative would have<br />
meant the collapse of the Australian economy and the fact is<br />
now that the banking industry of Australia, the banking<br />
industry who sets rates is saying that under these policies<br />
of this government which are now working, interest rates will<br />
be coming down. The opposite of course would happen if the<br />
other crowd got in because there would be a wages explosion<br />
and a busting of the budget surplus that I have created and<br />
boCth those things would mean a massive rise in interest<br />
rates. CALLER: Prime Minister I wish to challenge you to make a<br />
national broadcast not later than the 22 March as follows,<br />
that you will guarantee that your party, if re-elected to<br />
this parliament, the first bill to be brought to parliament<br />
will be a proclamation that all future elections will be held<br />
on the same week and month of the year an this election, ay<br />
the third Saturday in March and each fourth year from now on,<br />
that's from 1990 as it appears that most people agree on a 4 </p>
<p>6.<br />
CALLER: ( cont'd) year term.<br />
PM: Well unfortunately you are just way out of kilter with<br />
facts. I put a referendum Tom, I put a referendum to the<br />
people asking for a 4 year term and that referendum was<br />
defeated, why was it defeated Tom, because the opportunisticpeople<br />
sitting opposite me in the parliament, the Liberals<br />
and the National Party opposed it. so I put the proposal for<br />
a 4 year term and because of the opportunism of my political<br />
opponents that was defeated. As to going a full term I have<br />
an outstanding record in that regard. I was elected in 83,<br />
March of 83 1 had an election at the end of 84 to bring the 2<br />
elections into kilter, then I went full term from 84 to 87, I<br />
have gone full term from 87 to<br />
CALLER: My name is Brian Kirk, I am 34 years of age I am<br />
married with 2 young children, one 3. one 5. 1 am' dying of<br />
the disease called<br />
PM: I am sorry Brian what was that?.<br />
CALLER: I am dying of the disease of the lungs due to<br />
asbestos, I was exposed when I was working for Westrail and<br />
the government. In your policy speech you said that no<br />
Australian under Labor government is expendable. I and<br />
thousands of my fellow Australians who are now dying of this<br />
avoidable asbestos disease will probably disagree with<br />
you. The government has refused point blank to assist in<br />
funding any research into this disease and up until funding<br />
stopped they have had actually three people benefitted from<br />
the treatment that we were under. Unfortunately I wasn't one<br />
of them, I was on injections that didn't work for me.<br />
WARNOCK: Brian you are asking the Prime Minister whether the<br />
federal government will fund asbestos diseases research, are<br />
you, because we did have a question from another caller who<br />
rang us before the program began to ask us whether the<br />
federal government would fund asbestos diseases research and<br />
the Asbestos Diseases Society.<br />
CALLER: Right. Well I don't know who the caller was.<br />
WARNOCK: Dave Hall was his name, he rang us before the<br />
program began.<br />
CALLER: That's right, actually Dave Hall was the president<br />
of the combined unions of the South West.<br />
WARNOCK: And that's what you are asking the Prime minister<br />
about Brian?<br />
CALLER: Yea.<br />
PM: Let me say of course, first of all my sorrow at the<br />
situation you are in and no words can help you I know, but I<br />
nevertheless extend them to you. On the question of research<br />
of funding for research in medical area there has been an<br />
enormous increase in funding under my government for research </p>
<p>7. PM: ( cont'd) generally but also in regard to medical<br />
research in particular and indeed the relevant body, the<br />
medical research body has had a greater proportion of the<br />
increase in funding than any other section of research in<br />
this country. Now as to what is done with the allocation of<br />
the increased funding that we have made that is not our<br />
decision. I mean we have increased the funds very<br />
substantially for medical research in this country but if you<br />
like Brian, what I certainly undertake to do would be to have<br />
an enquiry made as to what the factual situation is in regard<br />
to allocation of funds, whether it's true that there has been<br />
a cut back in actual research done, that would surprise me if<br />
it is the case. But all I can say Brian is the actual<br />
financial resources for medical research have been<br />
increased, how they have been allocated I don't know, but I<br />
will find out and if you would like to give this station your<br />
address privately I would see that you get a detailed<br />
response because you are entitled to it.<br />
CALLERs I would like to ask the question why is your policy,<br />
your party policy giving so much to the young families of<br />
today. What about the senior citizens, the over 65s who<br />
fought for their country.<br />
PM: Ok now let me answer that question very simply and just<br />
let my preface my answer by saying that yesterday T was up at<br />
Gosnells and talking to a large number of elderly citizens up<br />
there and I talked to them about the issues that you asked<br />
about which I will answer you in a moment and after I had<br />
done that I said to them but I take the view which I hope is<br />
right that the elderly citizens of this country are not only<br />
concerned about the things that are directly relevant to them<br />
like pensions and so on, but I guess you are also concerned<br />
about your children and your grandchildren and I talked to<br />
them about the things I was doing in education and allowances<br />
for young families and they just exploded into applause which<br />
reflected what I thought and that is that elderly people<br />
don't put the sort of dichotomy that you do, that it's one or<br />
the other that they are concerned about their kids and their<br />
grandchildren. But now let me talk about the pension and I<br />
will give you the facts. The facts are very simple. When we<br />
came to office the pension as a proportion of average weekly<br />
earnings was 22.7% and in fact in their 7 years in<br />
government before 1983, the conservatives with all their talk<br />
about their concern for old people they had deliberately<br />
allowed the real purchasing power of the pension to go down<br />
by 2.5% A decline of 2.5% in purchasing power and walked out<br />
of-off ice with the pensioners at 22.7% of average weekly<br />
earning. I reversed that, we have increased the real value<br />
the purchasing power of the pension by over 7% and in f act<br />
next month now within a matter of weeks as a result of<br />
legislation already passed the pension will go to over 25% of<br />
average weekly earnings which will be the highest proportion,<br />
the highest proportion that a pensioner has had of average<br />
weekly earnings for more than 40 years. So there is the<br />
direct answer to your question, facts, not prejudices. I<br />
would make the further point that one of the areas of concern<br />
that have </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) been put to us properly by the pensioners<br />
organisations has been that pensioners paying tax on their<br />
non pension income. As a result of those representations we<br />
have made the decisions now which will mean by next year<br />
of all pensioners# part pensioners, will not be paying tax<br />
and by 1995 no pensioner or part pensioner will be paying any<br />
tax at all. So those are the facts.<br />
CALLER: Do you know what the poverty line is?<br />
PM: The poverty line, that's the one the Henderson Poverty<br />
Line? CALLER: I guess so.<br />
PM: Well no, but it's no good, with respect saying I guess<br />
so because my question to you is a very important one because<br />
there is a great deal of argument and discussion within the<br />
welfare industry as to what is the poverty line, so when you<br />
ask me what is the poverty line I want to know what you mean<br />
because historically there has been a use of the Henderson<br />
Poverty Line. Now that Henderson Poverty Line is now may I<br />
say, basically not accepted within the welfare industry<br />
itself. What the welfare industry has rather said to us<br />
when we are talking about poverty, we should have benchmarks<br />
so I know what the benchmarks are in regard to poverty that<br />
we agreed upon with the welfare sector when we were talking<br />
about what we would do in regard to payments for children<br />
from low income families and I will tell you what those<br />
benchmarks are. They are for a kid up to aged 13, 15% of the<br />
married pension rate and for a kid between 13 and 15, 20% and<br />
it's-on the basis of accepting those measures in consultation<br />
with the welfare industry in this country that we are now<br />
paying over $ 2 billion per annum into low income families for<br />
kids. Now those that are benchmarks which the welfare sector<br />
itself accepted as being relevant.<br />
CALLER: Yes well the pensioners and you have just been<br />
speaking to the previous lady, Mr Keating gave them a very<br />
O small rise and of course the cost of living in WA appears to<br />
be higher than anywhere else in Australia and I know<br />
of pensioners who are selling clothing and jewellery,<br />
anything to try and cope with the cost of living here.<br />
PM: You heard the answer I gave before as to, and this<br />
community of ours in Australia has a choice, a very simple<br />
choice to make and the choice is one in which they can Judge<br />
tI" previous people who deliberately allowed the real<br />
purchasing power of the pension to decline, deliberately<br />
allowed it and walked out of office with the pension at 22.7%<br />
of average weekly earnings or they can choose a government<br />
which will have taken the pension to the highest proportion<br />
of average weekly earnings in 40 years and has legislated to<br />
remove pension income, any pensioners getting income out of<br />
the tax area. Now it's a very simple choice and they can<br />
also make the choice between a party, that is ours, which has<br />
imposed the capital gains tax which will bring in billions of </p>
<p>9. P14: ( cont'd) dollars to ensure that we are able to keep on<br />
looking after pensioners or vote for the alternative who will<br />
take those billions of dollars out of the Commonwealth<br />
revenue which can be used for pensions and pay those billions<br />
of dollars into the pockets of less than 1% of the wealthiest<br />
taxpayers in the country. That's the sort of choice that's<br />
there. CALLER: I have a question for you about the problems of the<br />
pharmaceutical industry. Given that the pharmaceutical<br />
industry in Australia is demonstrably one of the most<br />
efficient in the world, one of the most effective in the<br />
world P14: Could I just interrupt you. When you talk about the<br />
Pharmaceutical industry are you talking about at the retail<br />
level or the manufacturing.<br />
CALLER: Retail level.<br />
PM: The retail level, is demonstrably the most, what did you<br />
say, what was the description of it? Demonstrably the what?<br />
CALLER: Efficient, effective and dynamic in the world.<br />
PM; How's that demonstrated?<br />
CALLER: As far as productivity goes there has been enormous<br />
increases in productivity.<br />
PM: What's the proof of that?<br />
CALLER: The proof of that is in the cost of pharmaceuticals<br />
per head of population and by many other<br />
PM: What are those f igures because I am not trying to be<br />
difficult, but my friend I have spent months with the<br />
representatvies of the pharmaceutical industry and asked them<br />
to produce the figures which they refused to produce before<br />
the inquiry. You see where this becomes very difficult for<br />
0 you is that if these claims were right, these claims that you<br />
just trot out, if they were right why did not the<br />
representatives of the retail pharmacists agree to go before<br />
the Remuneration Tribunal, a tribunal not set up by me, not<br />
set up by me, set up by our conservative predecessors, they<br />
deliberately set it up to handle these matters. When we<br />
couldn't get an agreement with the pharmacists we said<br />
al-Yight we will go to the tribunal set up by the<br />
conservatives and there if all these marvellous things are<br />
right that you are Valking about then one would have expected<br />
that the guild and the pharmacists would have bought out all<br />
these statistics and put them to the tribunal to establish<br />
their case. instead they refused to cooperate. Now that<br />
Just tends to make a person looking at it objectively believe<br />
that they must have had some doubt about their position if<br />
what you assert, you just come on a program and assert that<br />
you are the best in the world. If you are the best in the </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) world why did not your representatives and your<br />
guild and your organisation go before the tribunal and put<br />
the figures, they refused to do it.<br />
CALLER: You are avoiding the question that I am trying to<br />
put to you.<br />
WARNOCK: Go ahead.<br />
CALLER: Irrespective of what you are saying and there is<br />
great argument, what I am trying to say to you is the<br />
industry is at least effective and you must agree with that.<br />
PM: I'll agree that it's effective in that it provides a<br />
service which I recognise and applaude to the community. i<br />
have no question about that, I respect the industry.<br />
CALLER: Thank you. Now what I would like to say to you is<br />
why is there always the confrontational approach through your<br />
Minister for Aged Care with pharmacy, why can't we work<br />
together to improve health care for Australians as a general<br />
and particularly the elderly Australians which are an<br />
increasing proportion of our population and a section of the<br />
community which needs better pharmaceutical care to avoid<br />
preventable illness and hospitalisation and why are you going<br />
to cut $ 250 million out of pharmaceutical benefits to<br />
Australians when we are at a stage in<br />
PM: Let me interrupt there. Your assertion of cutting $ 250<br />
million out in terms of services to Australians is simply<br />
unfounded and I think you know it. You assert that we have<br />
confrontation I wish you would instead of being and<br />
emotional you would stick to the facts and even your industry<br />
will accept that what you are saying is not true. we have in<br />
fact tried at considerable length including with<br />
reprsentatives here from WA. You ask your representatives<br />
from WA I met with them here they came over, they came over<br />
to Canberra, they agreed to when I sat and met with them here<br />

Canberra we sat down, I worked out an agreement with them and<br />
they went off saying to us yes we can sell that and they went<br />
off to the rest of the industry and the rest of the industry<br />
in Australia said to your WA representatives who told me they<br />
had a dealI sorry can't do it. Why, because they wanted a<br />
confrontation, your WA representatives sat down with me,<br />
worked out an arrangement and then the reason it couldn't be<br />
soTd because the rest of your people in the rest of Australia<br />
wanted the confrontation. We wanted it settled so what did<br />
they do then, you say I wanted confrotnation, I amended the<br />
legislation, I amended the legislation to put on the<br />
Remuneration Tribunal directly a representative who had been<br />
involved in retail pharmacy. It hadn't been done before but<br />
I did that to meet your concerns I said alright we will<br />
agree to going back to the position before the decision of<br />
the tribunal, agreed to do that and agreed then to allow the<br />
Remuneration Tribunal to have a total rehearing on the matter<br />
and we said we would accept the decision and you talk about </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) confrontation. There is only one side in this<br />
that wants confrontation and that is your guild who<br />
repudiated the attempt by your WA representations to get an<br />
agreement. Now those are the facts on record and as<br />
acknowledged by the tribunal itself.<br />
CALLER: What I am very concerned about, I am a small<br />
businessman myself.<br />
PM: What sort of business are you in?<br />
CALLER: Marine cargo surveying and insurance life assessing.<br />
PM: What's that, marine-<br />
CALLER: Marine cargo.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: Surveying.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: And insurance life assessing.<br />
PM: How long you been in that?<br />
CALLER: Two years. Now naturally I am concerned like other<br />
small businesses on the high interest rates and how best<br />
PH: Sure, sure.<br />
CALLER: a working<br />
PM: I can understand that, yes.<br />
CALLER: Now what I have is a suggestion, we obviously have<br />
to improve our balance of payments to achieve a surplus. Now<br />
what I recognise and see myself is what I believe anyhow. We<br />
need to have a government sponsored export centralised system<br />
for information and assistance in each major city to<br />
coordinate those small businesses that may wish to export.<br />
The problem we now have at this stage appears to be that a<br />
high number of small businesses would be frightened to death<br />
just at the thought or the prospects of the problems involved<br />
in exporting.<br />
PMf-Sure. Because I am getting the indication that we are<br />
just about out of time do you mind if I just interrupt you<br />
because I want to say thank you very much for your call and<br />
you have hit right on the note that we tried to address in<br />
the decision we have just made at the beginning of this year<br />
which I announced the other day and that is we have had a<br />
system called the export market development grant scheme and<br />
we have decided to supplement that with a new scheme and<br />
together the two schemes will involve an increase in outlays<br />
over the next three years. But one of the particular points<br />
in the new scheme goes directly to what you said because we </p>
<p>12.<br />
P14: ( cont'd) recognise that for individual small businesses<br />
there is exactly the sort of# the apprehension that's<br />
involved in just one small business thinking what can I do by<br />
Myself and so part of this new grant scheme is going to be<br />
involved in assisting associations in this area to bring<br />
small groups together and small individual businesses<br />
together in the hope that by making grants available in that<br />
way we will be able to overcome what I do understand can be<br />
the apprehension for one small business in trying to tackle<br />
something like this itself so your concept is 1000% right and<br />
if again you would like to let Diana have your name and<br />
address I would be more than happy to see that you get<br />
personally sent to you the full details of that scheme<br />
because it's exactly in line with what you have suggested.<br />
CALLERs Just observations virtually. One thing that does<br />
make me feel cross about the opposition proposal in respect<br />
of interest rates. Now I retired in 1980, ton years ago I<br />
invested prudently I thought by investing in SEC and Telecom<br />
P at 10.9% and 12.3% and 2 years later when the Liberal<br />
government was still in power I could have got 17.5% from<br />
both those bodies for 10 years. Now you know to me when I<br />
hear Andrew Peacock talking about reducing interest rates<br />
there was a tremendous escalation and I would like to know<br />
where I can get 17.5% guaranteed by the government for<br />
years at the present time. The other I would like to mention<br />
is the foreign debt overseas, I don't think a lot of people,<br />
certainly people that I associate with understand that the<br />
majority of that is private enterprise. I believe that Paul<br />
Keating said that the Commonwealth Government has not<br />
borrowed overseas in the last 2 years and the third point if<br />
I may<br />
PM: You are going alright so far.<br />
CALLER: Beg your pardon.<br />
P14: You are going alright so far mate.<br />
S CALLER: Well I always believe in two pluses and then one<br />
minus. P14: Ok, here comes the minus for me.<br />
CALLER: With the policies that you have adopted is the<br />
negative gearing. Now this seems to me to f avour the two<br />
income families, as a matter of fact I have had approaches<br />
from financial advisers suggesting that I should borrow<br />
against my investments and invest in property etc at high<br />
interest rates so that I can reduce my income tax. Now you<br />
know to me that is ludicrous.<br />
PM: Firstly in regard to interest rates it is the case that<br />
interest rates in fact reached a higher level under the<br />
conservatives than it did under us. The 90 day bill rate<br />
peaked at 22% in April of 1982 and it's inevitable that </p>
<p>M14 ( cont'd) interest rates would have to explode under a<br />
coalition government for two reasons. one there would be a<br />
wages explosion which they don't really deny and they blow<br />
the budget surplus, again what we have got to understand<br />
there in that the Opposition is trying a straight out bribe<br />
of the electorate, a $ 6 billion bribe of the electorate, $ 6<br />
billion of promises which are unfunded, that means you blow<br />
the surplus and or, that or a combination of massive spending<br />
cuts and they will not come clean with the electorate and to<br />
the extent that they blow the budget surplus and have a wages<br />
explosion that means interest rates go up. On foreign debt<br />
you are right there, 65% of foreign debt is owned by the<br />
private sector. We have made decisions that they can service<br />
that debt and of course are using a lot of that debt to build<br />
up our infrastructure in this country. I mean for instance<br />
if you just look at it when you talk about the debt, a lot of<br />
that debt has gone into the investment for instance of the<br />
North West shelf which is now earning us export income and it<br />
is true that as a result of getting the $ 17 billion surplus<br />
and the Commonwealth budget over the last 3 years we have<br />
paid off our overseas debt, we are indeed net international<br />
creditors to the tune of about $ 4 billion and on negative<br />
gearing just let me say there that the policies that have<br />
been adopted there were adopted with a view to trying to<br />
assist in regard to the whole housing and accommodation<br />
area. WARNOCK: Just one final question from me however, before we<br />
go. What will you do if Labor loses?<br />
PM: Well I don't believe that Labor is going to lose Diana.<br />
I simply say that because I believe the Australian people are<br />
not going to be bribed and I have always taken the view that<br />
they won't buy that sort of proposition so I don't<br />
contemplate,, I don't contemplate losing because I have got<br />
greater faith in the Australian people than that.<br />
