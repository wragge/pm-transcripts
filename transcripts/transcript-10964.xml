<p>Well thank you very much to Rob Borbidge the Premier of Queensland,</p>
<p>   to Joan Sheldon, the Deputy Premier and Treasurer, to Russell Cooper</p>
<p>   the Minister for Police and State member for Crows Nest. I used</p>
<p>   to live next door to Crows Nest but there aren't as many sheep</p>
<p>   in Crows Nest Sydney as there are in Crows Nest Queensland. But</p>
<p>   to my Federal colleague, the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Bruce</p>
<p>   Scott, Bill Taylor the Member for Groom, Senator Bill O'Chee,</p>
<p>   Mr Healy, one of the local State members, Bob Carroll, the State</p>
<p>   President of the Liberal Party and Ian Macfarlane, the Liberal candidate</p>
<p>   for Groom at the next election and anybody else I have missed, ladies</p>
<p>   and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It's a tremendous joy for me to be here this morning. One</p>
<p>   of the best things about being Prime Minister is the opportunity</p>
<p>   to travel around our vast country and to meet different communities</p>
<p>   in their own local centres. And to somebody who grew up in Sydney</p>
<p>   it is always a particular delight to get out into the bush and therefore</p>
<p>   when the opportunity presented itself this morning to be associated</p>
<p>   with this very important project, which is going to be supported</p>
<p>   as you will see in a moment out of the Federation Fund, I leapt</p>
<p>   at that opportunity.</p>
<p>Eighteen months ago when we brought down the 1997 Budget we decided</p>
<p>   that we would make available an amount of $1 billion to fund important</p>
<p>   projects all around Australia which would mark the Centenary of</p>
<p>   Federation in a particular fashion. They wouldn't just be ordinary</p>
<p>   public works programmes, although some of them have a high content</p>
<p>   of what could be so described as public works. But they'd also</p>
<p>   have a little bit of historical significance where they could and</p>
<p>   they'd also relate to a project that part of Australia for</p>
<p>   a long time had wanted to see funded. And in that context, one of</p>
<p>   the first announcements that we made was funding towards the construction</p>
<p>   of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. Something that governments</p>
<p>   within Australia have been talking about almost since federation</p>
<p>   and had really not got around to doing anything about. We also announced</p>
<p>   funding for the Jervois Bay infrastructure program in Western Australia</p>
<p>   that's designed to support the export industries of Western</p>
<p>   Australia which, along with the export industries of Queensland,</p>
<p>   make such an enormous contribution to the national export effort.</p>
<p>And so when we came to Queensland there were a number of very important</p>
<p>   features that struck me about the federation projects. The first</p>
<p>   was that just about every project put up by the Queensland Government</p>
<p>   was worthy of financial support. Unfortunately we didn't have</p>
<p>   a fund of $5 billion, we had a fund of only $1 billion. But I must</p>
<p>   compliment the Queensland Government on the quality of the projects</p>
<p>   that were put forward. And I am very happy to say that the first</p>
<p>   project that we decided to fund which Jones referred to, Bris Tram,</p>
<p>   a $65 million contribution. That was number one on the list from</p>
<p>   the Queensland Government. And the cultural heritage trail which</p>
<p>   we are going to support and which this woolshed is a very important</p>
<p>   part and really epitomises what it is all about. It was also very</p>
<p>   high on the list and therefore I am delighted to say that the Federal</p>
<p>   Government will contribute the sum of $50 million from the Federation</p>
<p>   Fund to the Queensland cultural heritage network.</p>
<p>Now as the Premier said, this network will remind the Queenslanders</p>
<p>   of the turn of the century of what life was like a hundred years</p>
<p>   ago or more. And it is a fact that wherever you live in Australia</p>
<p>   as we approach the centenary of the federation of our country people</p>
<p>   are becoming more and more nostalgic about the events that led to</p>
<p>   federation. They are becoming more respectful of the past. They</p>
<p>   are wanting to preserve links with the past and they are wanting</p>
<p>   to, I guess, educate their children and themselves about what life</p>
<p>   was like a hundred years ago. And this marvellous woolshed is really</p>
<p>   a tribute to that attitude, to that state of mind. And it is really</p>
<p>   wonderful to see all the names on the beams. I was reminded this</p>
<p>   morning that one of the names on the beams, R J Randall, Dick Randall</p>
<p>   was probably the longest serving secretary of the Treasury that</p>
<p>   Australia has ever had. And his signature has probably appeared</p>
<p>   on more bank notes over a longer period of time than any other head</p>
<p>   of the Treasury. And as I look around it is a marvellously and lovingly</p>
<p>   restored and cared for building. And I think it is very important</p>
<p>   that Australians of this generation do visit places like this. And</p>
<p>   the rest of the trail is in the same vein. There is the coastway</p>
<p>   trail as Rob said from Brisbane to Thursday Island. There is the</p>
<p>   North Queensland mining and dinosaur trail. The very important Matilda</p>
<p>   Trail through central Queensland and, of course, the Southern Downs</p>
<p>   Squatters Trail around the Toowoomba area. And it will be a marvellously</p>
<p>   integrated project. It won't be just a series of disjointed</p>
<p>   ideas. There will be a theme about it and there will be a pattern</p>
<p>   to it and it will present an integrated idea of what life is like</p>
<p>   and a reminder of the great cultural heritage of this part of Australia.</p>
<p>   It will generate 2150 jobs in the construction phase and many ongoing</p>
<p>   jobs after that. And it will be responsible for promoting a lot</p>
<p>   of additional local economic activity. And the way in which it is</p>
<p>   structured is, of course, in recognition of the special character</p>
<p>   of Queensland. The one State in Australia where the bulk of the</p>
<p>   people do not live in the capital city of the State and it gives</p>
<p>   to the State of Queensland that very special character.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, in every sense of the word, this particular</p>
<p>   proposition put forward by the Queensland Government suited the</p>
<p>   criteria of the Federation Fund. And I was very happy along with</p>
<p>   all of my colleagues to give it very strong support. And I congratulate</p>
<p>   the Queensland Government in what it's done in putting it forward.</p>
<p>Can I just say two other things and the first of those and, very</p>
<p>   importantly, I am delighted to be here with Rob Borbidge and with</p>
<p>   Joan Sheldon. There is a Queensland election in two weeks time </p>
<p>   so I've read and heard! And may I say that I am happy to stand</p>
<p>   shoulder-to- shoulder in every way with both of them and to support</p>
<p>   the Queensland Government in all that it has done since it was elected</p>
<p>   three years ago. I've had a very close association with the</p>
<p>   Premier of Queensland during that period of time. I have dealt with</p>
<p>   a lot of Premiers, both as Prime Minister and as Treasurer, as Opposition</p>
<p>   Leader and in other positions. And there is none that I have enjoyed</p>
<p>   dealing with more than I have dealing with Rob Borbidge. He is a</p>
<p>   person who has always put the interest of Queensland first and that</p>
<p>   is his responsibility and that is his job and he has done it very,</p>
<p>   very well. And I would never respect a State Premier who didn't</p>
<p>   try and put the interests of his or her State first. I'd think</p>
<p>   something had gone wrong with Federal/State relations if that didn't</p>
<p>   happen. But within that, he has also at all times been a very good</p>
<p>   Australian and he has always seen to the national interest as well.</p>
<p>   And on some occasions I know, and I thank him for it. He has taken</p>
<p>   a bit of political pain in Queensland to support the national interest</p>
<p>   and I respect that and I thank him very warmly for that. </p>
<p>And can I just say that when I read some of the things that are</p>
<p>   written and said about the Queensland election I sometimes wonder</p>
<p>   that some of the commentators need a bit of a reality check. There</p>
<p>   is only one question in that election and that is whether Rob Borbidge</p>
<p>   continues to be the Premier of Queensland or Peter Beattie becomes</p>
<p>   the Premier of Queensland. Any noise on the side is irrelevant.</p>
<p>   I mean that is the choice, that's what it's about and</p>
<p>   that's what people should be concerning themselves about. I</p>
<p>   mean it is very easy when you don't have the faintest possibility</p>
<p>   of ever having to implement the promises you make in an election</p>
<p>   campaign to say all sorts of things. But when you know that at the</p>
<p>   end of the day the acid will be on you after polling day to actually</p>
<p>   do what you say, you then have to adopt a rather more responsible</p>
<p>   attitude. </p>
<p>And it's very easy for minority groups in Australian politics,</p>
<p>   and there are plenty of them to run around offering simplistic solutions</p>
<p>   to difficult problems. To offer the earth whenever there's</p>
<p>   a tiny cell of discontent. To say: yes, I'll stop this, I'll</p>
<p>   do that, and I'll fund something else, knowing full well that</p>
<p>   they will never be asked to do it. That's the easiest, laziest</p>
<p>   and I think the most dishonourable option in politics. If you've</p>
<p>   been in politics a long time you know that at the end of the day</p>
<p>   you can't escape responsibility and you can't escape reality.</p>
<p>   You can't escape decent policy, you can't escape being</p>
<p>   honest with people about what you can and can't do. And I've</p>
<p>   found in Rob Borbidge a man of his word, a man of great honour,</p>
<p>   a great fighter for Queensland. </p>
<p>If he'd have been at the first State of Origin game which</p>
<p>   I was at, I am very happy to say at the Sydney Football Stadium</p>
<p>   last Friday week. And I've got to tell you Prime Ministers</p>
<p>   are strictly neutral in State of Origin games  strictly neutral.</p>
<p>   I mean when the game was going, NSW go I was sandwiched between</p>
<p>   Nick Shahadie and John Laws and Nick in his inevitable style he</p>
<p>   said gee that was a pretty good start wasn't it John?'</p>
<p>   and I just sort of sat there and he said what's wrong</p>
<p>   with you?' and I said Prime Ministers are neutral Nick But</p>
<p>   you'd have been, of course, greatly delighted by the fantastic</p>
<p>   win that Queensland was able to snatch right at the final moment</p>
<p>   and I imagine there won't be too many neutral people at the</p>
<p>   second one. One of the great contributions that Queensland has made</p>
<p>   to Australian sport is a bi-partisan approach to State of Origin</p>
<p>   games.</p>
<p>But I am delighted to be here this morning and to wish the Queensland</p>
<p>   Government well and to say that as far as the Federal Government</p>
<p>   is concerned, I have a very simple minded view and that is that</p>
<p>   the interest of Queensland and the interest of Australia will be</p>
<p>   best served by the re-election of Government led by Rob Borbidge</p>
<p>   and Joan as Deputy Premier and I'll be delighted to continue</p>
<p>   the very close cooperation between our two governments.</p>
<p>Finally, can I simply say to you again, thank you for having me.</p>
<p>   It is a real delight for a Sydney boy to get out of the big smoke,</p>
<p>   to get away from Sydney, to get away from Canberra and to spend</p>
<p>   some time in rural Australia. I am very fond of Toowoomba. I don't</p>
<p>   think there's an inland city in Australia, which is more beautiful,</p>
<p>   and I am looking forward to spending a bit of time there later on</p>
<p>   today. But particularly to those associated with the Jondaryn Woolshed.</p>
<p>   To those associated with the activities of the Cultural Heritage</p>
<p>   Network here in Oakey Creek, congratulations on the tremendous work</p>
<p>   that you are doing. We all feel particularly warm about the bush</p>
<p>   as part of our Australian heritage and this is a magnificent contribution</p>
<p>   to it and the Federal Government is delighted to be associated with</p>
<p>   the Queensland Government in support of it. Thank you very much.</p>
