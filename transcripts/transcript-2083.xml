PRESS STATEMENT TRANSPORT OF DRUGS OF DEPENDENCE AND RECIPROCITYK<br />
OF THIRD PARTY INSURANCE<br />
( Statement by the Ministers)<br />
An urgent investigation will be held into the<br />
security of drugs of dependence during transport and storage.<br />
State and Commonwealth Transport Ministers decided<br />
this today ( July 10) at a meeting of the Australian Transport<br />
Advisory Council in Port Moresby.<br />
The move followed instances of large quantities<br />
of addictive drugs being stolen or lost in transit in various<br />
parts of Australia. This has caused serious concern among health<br />
authorities and members of the National Standing Committee on<br />
Drugs Dependence. Ministers will ask the Advisory Committee on the<br />
Transport of Dangerous Drugs to investigate the problem in<br />
conjunction with representatives of the National Standing<br />
Committee. Ministers also decided today to seek legislation in<br />
all States and Territories to bring about compulsory third<br />
party insurance throughout Australia.<br />
They noted advice from the Standing Committee of<br />
Attorneys-General that there are no Constitutional difficulties<br />
in the way of States and Territories legislating complete<br />
reciprocity between jurisdictions in tP recognition of third<br />
party insurance policies. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Minister's decision was aimed at ensuring<br />
complete reciprocity between the States and Territories in<br />
registration and administration of third party insurance.<br />
