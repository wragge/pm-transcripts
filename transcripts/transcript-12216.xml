    <content><![CDATA[<p>Mr Beazley's statement on Shell/Woodside has only compounded the Opposition's inability to express an attitude on the most important foreign investment decision taken by an Australian Government for at least ten years.</p>
<p>The statement says that the Opposition has "accepted" the Treasurer's decision. This is meaningless sophistry. The Labor Leader will still not tell the public whether or not the Opposition supports or opposes the Treasurer's decision. By definition, Oppositions have no alternative but to accept government decisions.</p>
<p>The failure of Mr Beazley to summon the courage to say whether or not he agrees with the Shell/Woodside decision is a pathetic example of policy weakness.   </p>
