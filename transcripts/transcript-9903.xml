TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE ISTANA HOTEL, KUALA LUMPUR,<br />
16 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I just thought I might open with a few opening remarks and then invite<br />
questions. The first thing I would like to say is It has been a very<br />
enjoyable visit to Malaysia. I have enjoyed again meeting the<br />
Prime Minister and members of the Government, members of the<br />
bureaucracy and the diplomatic corps at a very nice dinner last<br />
evening and I had the opportunity to have quite a long discussion<br />
there'WNith the Prime Minister and again today a very useful discussion,<br />
In the formal settings, where we were able to go through a reasonably<br />
long agenda.<br />
These talks underlined, I think, how deep and strong our bilateral<br />
relationship with Malaysia Is and how we can do much more together,<br />
howi there Is so much compiementarity between our two economies<br />
and, of course, with that long shared history going back so far, It just<br />
makes fairly obvious that we should be doing perhaps more In each<br />
others country and doing more together In third countries.<br />
We talked about a number of specific areas in this regard the<br />
environment, science, health, finance, building and construction,<br />
communication, civil aviation and, as you know, we were very<br />
pleased to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on Education<br />
Co-operation. You might recall that Malaysia has made a very key<br />
decision to allow twinning of universities, which will mean you will see<br />
Australian campuses here in Malaysia and we will be putting our<br />
universities together.<br />
I will be speaking shortly at a Business Forum which underlines how<br />
much dynamiarrt and activity ejlsa * In our commercial relationships<br />
and you might know that later on today I will be having separate<br />
discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar, and also<br />
Tun Daim. And then I go to a reception by the Malaysia-Australia<br />
Foundation, which Is designed to emphasise the strengths of the<br />
people to people links I have been talking about and I am very<br />
heartened by the development of these two bodies. </p>
<p>I have very much enjoyed this visit and I said to the Prime Minister that<br />
I would like to come back and have a more extensive visit one where<br />
I can see more of the countryside and I have Invited Dr Mahathlr to<br />
come to Australia.<br />
So, all In all, it has been a very fruitful time and I have enjoyed it and it<br />
just shows you, I think, how much you can cram Into a relatively short<br />
period of time.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how would you describe you said it was a very good<br />
relationship, would you say now that the hiccups of the past as<br />
Dr Mahathir described them are now behind us?<br />
PM: Well I think what drives Governments and countries are the real<br />
building blocks of relationships and the momentum they have as<br />
societies, and that Is what has driven this relationship right through its<br />
history. And now we are both doing more, we are both more open to<br />
the world, we are prone to drive each other along faster and I hope,<br />
together, do things to drive the region along faster. And the fact that<br />
I am here, I think, is evidence that that Is what I believe and It Is<br />
certahily what the Prime Minister believes.<br />
J: Last night Dr Mahathir said that there was some negative elements In<br />
both societies regarding the relationship. What did you take him to<br />
mean by those negative elements? Do you think there are negative<br />
elements In both societies?<br />
PM: Well I have a penchant for positive elements. That might make me<br />
unusual In some company here. But the fact Is we, I think, you see<br />
Dr Mahathir and I have now had quite a substantial history In<br />
multilateral bodies most recently, at the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting -and I think he made the point last night<br />
convincingly and I reiterated the point in my talks that we all need a<br />
contemporary snapshot of societies. You know you come to Malaysia<br />
In three years time, It will be a different country than the one you are In<br />
today. Go to Australia In three years time, It will be different again to<br />
the one three. years ago. And, I think, that old, deep relationships are<br />
often not only taken for granted but the stereotype remains In one's<br />
mind about them. And the value of visits like this not just for Prime<br />
Ministers and Ministers, but for business people, and for Journalists,<br />
and for everybody else Is to see a contemporary reality. That 18, I<br />
think, which makes very clear that we are countries that live In great<br />
proximity to one another and will have a shared history in the region<br />
and In the world. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, is it fair to say that in the contemporary reality, there are<br />
still more differences between Australia and Malaysia in terms of the<br />
outlook on the specifics of the region than there are with some other<br />
countries like Indonesia?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. No, I think that we all see the sort of boundless<br />
opportunity and the pace of the change doesn't leave much time for<br />
scepticism, or cynicism.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Dr Mahathir said this morning that the relationship was<br />
" as harmonious as it could be". What do you think he meant by that?<br />
PM: Probably what he said,<br />
J: But he seemed to be indicating some reservations still.<br />
PM: Well he thinks it is as harmonious as it could be, it means it is as good<br />
as he thinks it can be and that is very good as far as I am concerned.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what is your response to Mr Goh's proposition that<br />
Australia and New Zealand could one day become members of<br />
ASEAN?<br />
PM: Well I don't think we have been Invited. But, I think, what we want to<br />
do is to see ourselves more Integrated with the region including the<br />
ASEAN economies and the ASEAN economy. And you know we have<br />
been speaking of the proposition of whether we might be able to see<br />
Australasia Australia and New Zealand and AFTA do something in<br />
concert and, I think, were that to happen we would goa'very long way<br />
to drawing the best of the complementarities that might be available<br />
from, if you like, both economies.<br />
J: So trade integration is the first step before any political Joining in<br />
ASEAN?<br />
PM: Well, I think Prime Minister Goh mentioned this the other day for<br />
instance. I think all of us have an open mind about the structures of<br />
the region. But the thing that we are all doing Is we are all in it.<br />
We are Integrating ourselves further, all of us, in the trade and traffic of<br />
the area and smoothing those things out, I think, probably matters<br />
more than the political/ economic structures. So that is getting the<br />
open access and the trade opportunities and the flux of business<br />
moving Is the thing that matters. Now whether that happens<br />
bilaterally, or multilaterally, I think, doesn't much matter. It may<br />
happen somewhat quicker and better if it happens multilaterally and<br />
that is why we are looking at AFTA and Australasia for instance.<br />
The next step about some political involvement in ASEAN is really,<br />
I think, for ASEAN to think about more than for us. </p>
<p>J: So you agree with Dr Mahathir that now Is not the right time for<br />
Australia to become part of ASEAN?<br />
PM: Well we haven't been Invited to become part of ASEAN. Musing about<br />
It is something that has been done from time to time and<br />
Prime Minister Goh was doing that this week.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you said In your speech last night that Australia was<br />
not attempting to become " Asian", yet Dr Mahathir has specifically said<br />
that we can't expect to be part of Asia until our population mix changes<br />
in that direction. How do you reconcile those two views?<br />
PM: Well, I think, quite easily. I think he Is saying is Australia an Asian<br />
country? What I Baid last night was no, It Isn't. And he is really<br />
saying It would only be an Asian country when it was actually Asian, or<br />
predominantly Asian. I wouldn't have thought there Is any need to<br />
reconcile those views. I think we are coming to the same question<br />
from a different angle. Australia is not an Asian country, but it Is an<br />
integral part of the Asia-Pacific economy where we supply half of<br />
East Asia's raw requirements for steel, for energy, for coal, a large part<br />
of its requirements for food, as well as the higher technology areas we<br />
are . n6w seeing our markets grow in and, I think, that Is the point.<br />
So whether you call it us being part of Asia, or the East Asia<br />
hemisphere, or the Asia-Pacific, I think what matters Is that we are an<br />
integral part of that economy and it happens to be the fastest growing<br />
economic region of the world. 1 think that Is what we are speaking of.<br />
I wouldn't want to see Australia described as an Asian country It Isn't.<br />
It Is Australia. It is not European, it Is not North American It Is<br />
Australia.<br />
J: Mr Keating, despite what you have just said, there Is no doubt there is<br />
still tension In the relationship between Australia and Malaysia<br />
Dr Mahathir referred to it and it bubbles up from time to time.<br />
Where do you think that tension comes from?<br />
PM: Well I only had just a briefing as I walked In about the remarks he had<br />
made to you as a group outside of his office and I don't think there is<br />
anything he said that sustains your point.<br />
J But he said that in his speech last night, talking about the hiccups and<br />
how they do come up, we have got to deal with them.<br />
PM: Well hiccups come in all relationships. I mean of course they do.<br />
But they come and go. It Is the strength that underlies it that matters.<br />
J: Mr Keating, was there any discussion on the Dr Mahathir's Idea for the<br />
East Asia Economic Caucus and the possibility of a formal relationship<br />
between Australia and the EAEC? </p>
<p>PM: No, we didn't discuss the East Asia Economic Caucus proposal.<br />
I think, though, what we do welcome is regionai cooperation. That Is<br />
the point I just made to you a moment ago and I am going to have<br />
more to say about that In Singapore tomorrow. I think for us APEC<br />
provides perhaps a core piece of political architecture in the<br />
Asia-Pacific because It Includes the largest country, China, the largest<br />
economy In the region, Japan, and the largest economy In the world,<br />
the United States, as well as the countries of South East Asia and<br />
those other continental countries like Australia.<br />
J: So you have changed your view that the EAEC is Irrelevant?<br />
PM: Well I don't think there is any value In adding to what I thought was a<br />
very succinct answer, Glenn.<br />
J: Prime Minister, were there any discussions about closer defence ties<br />
and was the issue of the Indonesian defence treaty raised by<br />
Dr Mahathir?<br />
PM: No, no, In fact I spoke to the Prime Minister about It last night and said<br />
that I regarded It very much as a declaration of trust between Australia<br />
and-l1idonesia. That Is, that Issues In the past -back in the 60s and<br />
other things which have now passed through we are saying that In<br />
the language of the treaty that we have common strategic Interests,<br />
Australia doesn't have territorial designs on Indonesia, Indonesia<br />
doesn't have territorial designs on Australia. There, Is nothing In the<br />
area but good things to be done together and to. cooperate. And that<br />
cooperation will also extend, of course, to defence cooperation, which<br />
we are already doing. So, In a sense, the treaty, Is a further<br />
development of that defence cooperation which, I think, the Prime<br />
Minister well and truly understands and, of course, that makes the<br />
area much more solid again, compiementing the Five Power Defence<br />
Arrangements,<br />
J: On defence, did you make a plug for Transfield and the patrol boat?<br />
PM: I don't go around making plugs that is for other people to do. But we<br />
talked about the value of developing, you know, core regional strategic<br />
Infrastructure and, obviously, a naval ship building capacity In this part<br />
of the world Is a strong asset. It Is a very strong asset for Australia.<br />
We are, obviously, prepared to share that technology and that asset<br />
with Malaysia. But that Is essentially a decision for their defence force<br />
and their Government to make.<br />
J Mr Keating, Is trying to Integrate with Asia the plan of your Government<br />
alone or the future of Australia? </p>
<p>PM: Oh, I think it is very much an imperative for Australia. That is, we live<br />
in this part of the world, we trade in this part of the world, more and<br />
more of our people to people contacts are in this part of the world, half<br />
of our migration intake is from Asia, the cosmopolitan, multicultural<br />
character of Australia means, I think, that we will look at this part of the<br />
world. This has already become the central focus, I think, of<br />
Australians.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have expressed your Interest to attend the<br />
Asia-EU meeting in Bangkok. Did you discuss this with Dr Mahathir?<br />
PM: No, I haven't no. There are many issues in the sort of International<br />
constellation out there that is one. It is not one that the Australian<br />
Government has put great store on.<br />
J: Is Australia keen to attend the next ASEAN-EU Summit?<br />
PM: Well it depends. We will see how the first one goes.<br />
J: Did you receive an undertaking that Malaysia would not oppose your<br />
presence at the next summit?<br />
PM: We didn't discuss It at all. Not at all. I have never raised the EU-Asia<br />
meetings with Prime Minister Mahathir, or any other leaders of<br />
ASEAN.<br />
J: Did Dr Mahathir accept your Invitation to come to Australia?.<br />
PM: No, but he knows it is there and he knows it is a genuine one.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on a personal level, how were relations? I mean how did<br />
you get on with Dr Mahathir?<br />
PM: Oh, good. But I always do. I had a good meeting with him in<br />
New Zealand and we ended up together a couple of times in Osaka<br />
and, of course, here we had a very, very nice evening last night with<br />
Dr Mahathir and his wife.<br />
J: Dr Mahathir mentioned last night, in his speech, trade agreements.<br />
Is there anything new in the pipeline in the way of formal Government<br />
to Government trade agreements?<br />
PM: No, but we are thinking about what is going to be best for us. We are<br />
not dealing with the same sort of economies and countries we were<br />
when we were speaking about this on the last occasion and I hope<br />
today's discussion will be good for both of us who are thinking about<br />
what that should be. Anyway I found it very encouraging.<br />
