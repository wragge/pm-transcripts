<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the three former prime ministers and the former governor general have come out urging you not to back a US and UK strike without UN sanctions.  Do you have a comment on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I have got a comment.  Right at the moment, Australia is strongly supporting the attempts of the United States and Britain to obtain Security Council support for a resolution on this issue.  It is clearly not in Australia's interests for me to speculate as to what this country might do if those attempts fail.  The right thing for Australia is for me to support those current attempts and to refrain from any comment as to what might be Australia's attitude if those bona fide attempts are not successful.  Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thanks, Prime Minister.</p>
