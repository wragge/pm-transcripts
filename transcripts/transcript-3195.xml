INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION<br />
OF RACIAL DISCRIIIINATION<br />
The Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Whitlam, today reaffirmed the Government's opposition to<br />
racial discrimination and its commitment to the basic principles<br />
of freedom and dignity for all people regardless of race, sex,<br />
language, religion or ethnic origin.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that in 1966 the United Nations General<br />
Assembly had proclaimed 21 March as the International Day for the<br />
. Elimination of Racial Discrimination in commemoration of the<br />
Sharpeville tragedy. The aim was to draw world attention to the<br />
urgent need to eliminate racial discrimination wherever it existed.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Government would continue to<br />
condemn the apartheid policies of the South African Government, but<br />
he did not see the day simply as an occasion to point to the<br />
shortcomings of others. It was also an opportunity to examine<br />
where Australia itself was headed.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that on 21 November last, the Government<br />
had introduced into the Senate two Bills, the Racial Discrimination<br />
Bill 1973 and the Human Rights Bill 1973, both of which had<br />
impori-.! it implications for the prevention and elimination of all<br />
forms of racial discrimination in Australia.<br />
These Bills would be re-introduced in Parliament in an<br />
amended form in the Autumn session.<br />
The proposed legislation on racial discrimination would<br />
implement the terms of the . International Convention on the<br />
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which the<br />
Government would ratify.<br />
This Convention recognised that any doctrine of superiority<br />
based on racial differences was fundamentally false, morally </p>
<p>indefensible and without any social justification,. The Racial<br />
Discrimination Bill condemned racial discrimination as being<br />
unlawful and provided administrative machinery as well as legal<br />
sanctions to prevent and eliminate racial discrimination as far<br />
as possible. Mr Whitlam said that the Bill provided for an Australian<br />
Race Relations Commissioner, and a Race Relations Council. Their<br />
functions would be to promote understanding and tolerance between<br />
racial and ethnic groups.<br />
The Racial Discrimination Bill was a major step in<br />
Australia's program to implement the Decade for Action to Combat<br />
Racism and Racial Discrimination, launched by the United Nations<br />
on 10 December 1973. Australia welcomed the Decade as a positive<br />
and necessary means of tackling the problem.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that other action taken by the Government<br />
' to counter racial discrimination included contributions, totalling<br />
$ 25,000 in 1973/ 74, to the United Nations Educational and Training<br />
program for Southern Africa, the United Nations Trust Fund for<br />
South Africa and the United Nations Fund for Namnibia.<br />
By its actions and votes at the 28th Session of the United<br />
Nations General Assembly in 1973 the Government had clearly<br />
indicated its resolve to help to eliminate all forms of racism and<br />
racial discrimination. </p>
