PRIME MINI1STER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE [ RON P J KE-ATING MP<br />
LAWLESS LIBERALS<br />
The Liberal frontbencher Ian McLachlan's approach to theMabo issue is now one of<br />
seeking to brazenly defy a judgement of the High Court. There should be no place for<br />
him in the shadow ministry of a party which genuinely believes in the laws and<br />
institutions of this country.<br />
For some time now I have highlighted the extraordinary arrogance and hypocrisy in the<br />
approach of many Liberals to the Mabo High Court decision. As conservatives, they<br />
stand by the rule of law and the sanctity of private property. But when a decision of<br />
the highest court in the country doesn't suit their vested interests, they say the court is<br />
in error and the decision should be overturned.<br />
Mr McLachlan's performance on ABC Radio this morning was the most flagrant<br />
confirmation to date of this moral bankruptcy. In effect, he endorsed Professor<br />
Blaincy's view that because some Australians of influence do not like the judgement of<br />
the High Court, the Chief Justice should call his court together to explain themselves,<br />
or resign.<br />
His agreement with the " general thrust" of Prof'essor Blainey's incitement to defy the<br />
Court in Adelaide last night is an indictment of the Liberals, and an indictment of Dr<br />
Hewson for failing to pull him into line.<br />
Mr McLachlan also describcd Premnier Court's legislation legilation which Mr<br />
McLachlan endorses as " the start of a process of reversal of the native title decision".<br />
Dr Hewson should dissociate himself from Mr McLachlan's views, and from the<br />
Western Australian legislation now, or stand accused of the same arrogant refusal to<br />
accept the decision of the Court which even Mr Hugh Morgan describes as " the<br />
keystone of the Constitutional arch".<br />
But where was Dr Hewson while this was occurring? Giving Senator Bishop the<br />
political equivalent of another kiss on the cheek in exchange for her hollow assurance<br />
that she doesn't want his job, The Liberal Party leadership is now a vacuum waiting to<br />
be fillecd<br />
