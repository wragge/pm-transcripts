    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I am pleased to announce that President Olesugun Obasanjo of Nigeria will visit from 27 February to 1 March 2002, the first ever official visit to Australia by a Nigerian head of state.<br />
In 1999 Australia and the world warmly welcomed the election of President Obasanjo, who played a key role in the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Nigeria.<br />
As one of Africa';s foremost statesman, President Obasanjo has used his considerable influence to shape a better future for Africa, working through the Commonwealth and on the wider world stage.<br />
This visit is a measure of the growing links between Australia and Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa.<br />
Our talks will cover a wide range of bilateral, regional and international issues. I expect both of us will take a particular interest in Commonwealth matters in the immediate lead-up to the Coolum CHOGM.<br />
Since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria, relations between Australia and Nigeria have been warm.  Our links are steadily expanding and areas such as trade, capacity building assistance, research and development cooperation and sporting ties will feature during the talks.</p>
