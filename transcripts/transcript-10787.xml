    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, wharfies are staging another seven-day strike from</p>
<p> next Tuesday, what do you think?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's obvious that there is a deep division between the</p>
<p> MUA and the ACTU. The ACTU wants the strike restricted, the wharfies</p>
<p> want to spread it to a lot of areas. My view is very simple, we support</p>
<p> more competition on the waterfront, we support any activity, within</p>
<p> the law of Australia, to give this country a more productive and a</p>
<p> more competitive waterfront. And we will act in all ways to achieve</p>
<p> that aim.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What sort of damage are these wharfies doing to Australia?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, for years we have been denied a more competitive waterfront.</p>
<p> For years we have denied jobs and more export because we've had</p>
<p> a relatively unproductive waterfront and I want to see that changed.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Patricks is considering legal action, would you support that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Patricks, like any other company, are entitled to act within</p>
<p> the law. My view is very simple, we change the law to allow certain</p>
<p> things to occur and I will support any action by Patricks or by the</p>
<p> National Farmers Federation that is within the law.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the union is claiming that Patricks was bringing in</p>
<p> security guards and dogs tomorrow morning at the Brisbane waterfront.</p>
<p> Do you support that sort of action?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I don't know what every individual company in Australia</p>
<p> does and I'm not going to try and answer for it. My view and</p>
<p> my principle is very simple. I support anything that will give us</p>
<p> a better waterfront provided it is within the law.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Democrats and Labor say the Government's, in fact, fanning</p>
<p> this unrest. What do you say to them?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't take much notice of the Democrats.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you fanning it by not intervening, though, or discouraging this</p>
<p> action?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm for a more productive waterfront and I think most Australians</p>
<p> are. Overwhelmingly Australians are fed-up with lack of competition</p>
<p> on the waterfront.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Sydney's the biggest port though, a seven day strike could be</p>
<p> crippling.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if there is a strike it'll be the fault of the MUA and</p>
<p> no one else's fault.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Senator Harradine is backing the Wik Bill being subject</p>
<p> to the Racial Discrimination Act. Are we now headed for a race-based</p>
<p> election?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'm not going to start giving another running commentary</p>
<p> on that issue. I made a very fair offer yesterday and I hope it might</p>
<p> still be taken up. But I'm not going to give a running commentary</p>
<p> on a piece of legislation that is still in front of the Senate. Our</p>
<p> position is very clear. Everyone knows it. We've presented a</p>
<p> fair, decent compromise and the sooner the thing is passed by the</p>
<p> Senate and we can get this issue behind us, the better for all of</p>
<p> us.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Japanese economy, what does the situation there</p>
<p> mean for Australia?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the Japanese economy has a great deal of resilience</p>
<p> and I don't think people should start jumping to conclusions</p>
<p> about difficulties in the Japanese economy. Obviously, like any other</p>
<p> nation, from time to time structural change is necessary. But Japan</p>
<p> has unrivalled strength when it comes to her trade surplus, her savings</p>
<p> ratio, her long history of economic productivity and economic competition.</p>
<p> Japan is a remarkable economy and it would be very foolish for people</p>
<p> to embrace and unnecessarily negative views about the outlook for</p>
<p> Japan.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>We are talking about the corner stone of Asia's economy here,</p>
<p> though. I mean, are you saying that people should just hold back a</p>
<p> bit and not panic yet?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm saying that, fundamentally, the Japanese economy is very</p>
<p> strong, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, how does July the 4th sound for an election?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thought it was American Independence Day.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
