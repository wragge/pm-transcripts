22 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, FAULCONBRIDGE, NSW<br />
E O E<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
( tape break) strongly to the view I have for a long time, long before anybody had<br />
heard of Pauline Hanson or Pauline anybody. I've held the view for a long time that<br />
the paradigms of the ' 50s and ' 60s no longer apply and the world has changed and<br />
there is a link between high unemployment and high immigration particularly where the<br />
balance is too heavily skewed away from skilled migration. And what we have sensibly<br />
done is to reduce the overall level and to shift the balance. It's in the national interest,<br />
it will relieve some of the unemployment pressure and I just disagree completely with<br />
Mr Kennett but you can have those friendly disagreements on matters of high policy.<br />
But I think he is wrong, I believe I'm right and that's why the Federal Government has<br />
taken the decision and it's our responsibility to run immigration policy. We listen to<br />
what the States have got to say, we take the decision and on with the job.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you give me an example of the sort of migrant community you're talking about<br />
where unemployment levels<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I'm not going to start naming individual communities because some smart<br />
alec will then say I'm targeting a particular group. You know as well as I do that the<br />
unemployment rates are very high within particular communities and it's not their fault.<br />
In fact, maintaining the system we've maintained is probably doing them a great<br />
disservice. But we've looked at this thing. It's got nothing to do with race, it's got<br />
nothing to do with Hanson, it's got everything to do with a commonsense decision in<br />
the interests of the Australian people.<br />
