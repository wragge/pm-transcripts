flo SQE ED MT IVES -9 JU LY 1975<br />
( CHECKED AGAINST DAILY HANSARD)<br />
THIS HOUSE HAS BEEN RECALLED SO THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL THE<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA MAY HEAR AND JUDGE ANY ALLEGATIONS OF<br />
IMPROPRIETY, ILLEGALITY, . ALPRACTICE OR MALFEASANCE AGAINST<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY MINISTER. IN ALL THE WELTER OF<br />
INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS, IN ALL<br />
THE ORGY OF TRIVIA DRUMMED UP AS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING.-<br />
ONE CLEAR FACT EMERGES: NO RESPONSIBLE PERSON HAS EXPRESSLY<br />
OR DIRECTLY MADE ANY SPECIFIC CHARGE OF IMPROPRIETY, OF<br />
ILLEGAL OR CORRUPT CONDUCT ON THE PART OF my GOVERNMENT,<br />
MYSELF OR ANY INDIVIDUAL MINISTER. INNUENDO, INSINUATION,<br />
-THE SNEER,. THE SMEAR, CERTAINLY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION<br />
MR MALCOLM FRASER AND HIS DEPUTY, WILLING TO WOUND YET<br />
LAFRAID TO STRIKE, HAVE PROVED ADEPT AT IT; BUT NO SPECIFIC<br />
CHARGES. IF SUCH CHARGES ARE TO BE MADE, THIS IS THE PLACE<br />
TO MAKE THEM. Now. IS THE TIME TO MAKE THEM. Now IS THE.<br />
TIME TO PUT UP OR SHUT UPS<br />
2. THE PRIVILEGES OF THIS PARLIAMENT FULLY PROTECT<br />
MEMBERS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR INFORMATION, EVEN PARTIAL<br />
INFORMATION, EVEN SUSPECT INFORMATION, WOULD WARRANT MAKING<br />
SPECIFIC CHARGES OF IMPROPRIETY AGAINST MINISTERS WHICH THE<br />
LAWS OF DEFAMATION MIGHT RENDER DANGEROUS IF MADE OUTSIDE.<br />
HERE, ALLEGATIONS CAN BE MADE, PERSONS CAN BE NAMED AND<br />
DOCUMENTS CAN BE PRODUCED WITH IMPUNITY AND IMMUNITY. IT IS </p>
<p>29<br />
NOT ONLY A PRIVILEGE WHICH PARLIAMENT BESTOWS BUT A<br />
RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IT IMPOSES. THROUGH THIS PARLIAMENT,<br />
MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE, BUT AN EQUAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY RESTS WITH OPPOSITION MEMBERS, TO PRODUCE<br />
THEIR INFORMATION, IF THEY HAVE ANY, TO FORMULATE THEIR<br />
CHARGES, ! F THEY HAVE ANY. THIS IS THE PLACE TO MAKE THEM;<br />
THIS THE PLACE WHERE THEY SHALL BE ANSWERED. THE<br />
INQUISITION BY INNUENDO IS OVER. THIS IS THE TRIBUNAL IN<br />
WHICH THE OPPOSITION AS MUCH AS THE GOVERNMENT, WILL BE<br />
JUDGED -IN THE HIGHEST COURT, BY THE JURY OF THE PEOPLE.<br />
WE ARE ALL ON TRIAL NOW.<br />
3. THERE IS A SPECIAL AND O VERRIDING REASON WHY THIS<br />
PARLIAMENT IS THE PROPER PLACEI FOR IT IS UPON THE VERY<br />
QUESTION OF PROPER PARLIAMENTARY CONDUCT THAT THE ONE<br />
AUTHENTIC EVENT IN A WEEK OF SQUALID INTRIGUE TURNED NOT<br />
THE. PSEUDO EVENTS OF THE MEDIA BUT THE ONE DEFINITE EVENTIP<br />
TREMENDOUS IN THE LIFE OF A PARTY, OF A NATION, SUPREMELY<br />
TRAGIC IN THE LIFE OF A MAN. ON 2 JULY, I ADVISED THE<br />
GOVERNOR-GENERAL TO TERMINATE THE COMMISSION OF THE MINISTER<br />
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION. As DOCUMENTS WHICH I<br />
MADE PUBLIC ON 2 JULY MAKE CLEAR, I TOOK THAT DECISION AND<br />
WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE THAT DECISION ON TWO GROUNDS. THEY WERE<br />
THE SOLE GROUNDS FOR THAT DECISION. FIRST, THERE WAS A<br />
TOTAL DISCREPANCY BETWEEN A REPLY GIVEN ON LjJUNE AND A<br />
LETTER WRITTEN ON 7 MARCH 1975, SECONDLY, REPORTED </p>
<p>33<br />
ACTIVITIES BY A MINISTERIAL OFFICER, A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE,<br />
WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE A PROFIT FROM HIS<br />
POSITION ON HIS MINISTER'S STAFF. I RECEIVED NO<br />
SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION FOR THESE ACTIVITIES$<br />
4. THE EXPLANATIO1N I SOUGHT FROM THE MINISTER DID NOT<br />
CONCERN THE PROPRIETY OR PRUDENCE CF ANY ACTIVITIES HE HAD<br />
ENTERED INTO As TREASURER CONCERNING PETRODOLLAR LOAN<br />
RAISINGS. EMPHASISE THIS TO DRAW THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MY<br />
DECISION TO TRANSFER HIM FROM THE TREASURY To ENVIRONMENT ON<br />
6 JUNE AND MY DECISION TO ADVISE THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL TO<br />
TERMINATE HIS COMMISSION. THE FIRST DECISION SPRANG FROM MY<br />
BELIEF IN THE UNWISDOM OF HIS ACTION.<br />
IN THE CASE OF HIS DISMISSAL, THE ISSUE WAS VERY<br />
PRECISE; THE STANDARDS WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT SETS AND UPON<br />
WHICH IINSIST, WERE NOT UPHELD. THE PERSONAL INTEGRITY OF<br />
MY COLLEAGUE WAS NOT AN ISSUE AND IS NOT IN DOUBT. THE<br />
FAULT WAS GRIEVOUS, BUT IT LIES NOT IN HIS INTEGRITY OR<br />
REPUTATION AS A MAN OF HONOUR, HE HAS RENDERED REM4ARKABLE<br />
SERVICE TO HIS PARTY AND THE NATION. BUT THE LAPSE FROM THE<br />
STANDARDS WHICH THIS PRIME MINISTER AT LEAST, AND THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT AT LEAST, INSISTS UPON, LEFT ME WITH NO CHOICE.-<br />
AND IN THIS LIES THE SUPREME IRONY OF THE PRESENT<br />
OCCASION. THE DISMISSAL OF A DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, FOR<br />
WHATEVER REASON, CANNOT BUT BE DAMAGING TO ANY GOVERNMENT.-</p>
<p>THIS DISMISSAL OF A DEPUTY LEADER, FROM THE MINISTRY,<br />
PARTICULARLY ONE HELD IN THE REGARD -AFFECTION -OF HIS<br />
PARTY IN AND OUT OF PARLIAMENT AS IS THE HONOURABLE MIEMBER<br />
FOR LALOR, IS A TRAGEDY FOR ALL THE PARTY, NOT LEAST ITS<br />
LEADER. THE COURSE WAS TAKEN BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE TAKEN.-<br />
BECAUSE OF STANDARDS, BECAUSE OF PARLIAMENTARY PROPRIETY.<br />
7. YET THE GOVERNMENT AND PARTY WHICH HAS SET FOR<br />
ITSELF THESE STANDARDS AND WHICH HAS SHOWN IN ACTION HOW<br />
SWIFT, COMPLETE, CONDIGN IS THE PENALTY FOR ANY LAPSE FROM<br />
THEM, IS AT THE SAME TIME BEING SMEARED FOR IMPROPER<br />
CONDUCT. THE HOUSE CAN JUDGE THESE MATTERS FOR ITSELF.<br />
ASK-LEAVE OF THE HOUSE TO PRESENT PAPERS RELATED TO OVERSEAS<br />
LOAN NEGOTIATIONS WITH MR GEORGE HARRIS AND TO NOTE A MOTION<br />
TO AUTHORIZE THE PUBLICATION OF THE PAPERS.<br />
( WHEN LEAVE GRANTED)<br />
8. PRESENT THE FOLLOWING PAPERS:.<br />
LETTERS FROM THE PRIME MINISTER AND REPLIES TO HIM<br />
AND A MEMORANDUM FROM THE SOLICITOR GENERAL COMMENTING ON<br />
THOSE REPLIES'ARISING FROM THE LETTER TO MR HARRIS OF<br />
MARCH AND THE 2 LETTERS TO HIM OF 15 APRIL AND CABLES AND<br />
LETTERS ARISING FROM THE LETTER TO MR HARz&amp; OF 7 MARCH I<br />
MOVE: </p>
<p>A. THAT THIS HOUSE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE<br />
PROVISIONS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS ACT.<br />
1908-J. 974, AUTIIOSISES THE PUBLICATION OF<br />
PAPERS RELATING. TO OVERSEAS LOAN NEGOTIATIONS<br />
PRESENTED TO THE HOUSE BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THIS DAY.<br />
( WHEN LEAVE GRANTED, MOVE MOTION PROVIDED BY THE CLERK)<br />
IASK LEAVE OF THE HOUSE TO HAVE INCORPORATED IN<br />
HANSARD THE TEXTS OF THE PAPERS WHICH IHAVE JUST PRESENTED.<br />
9. STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS HOUSE ARE CENTRAL TO ANY<br />
EXAMINATION OF THE MATTER NOW BEFORE THE HOUSE -THE<br />
OVERSEAS BORROWINGS SOUGHT BY THIS GOVERNMENT. THE BASIC<br />
* FACTS HAVE BEEN STATED IN THIS PARLIAMENT IN ANSWERS TO<br />
QUESTIONS, NONE OF THE SO-CALLED REVELATIONS, NONE OF THE<br />
PHOTOSTATS, THE P URCHASED OR P URLOINED DOC UMENTS, NONE OF<br />
TELEAKS FROM THE DISAFFECTED OR DISLOYAL, ALTER BASIC<br />
FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN WELL KNOWN FOR FIVE MONTHS.<br />
UNTIL WE RECALLED THE PARLIAMENT FOR THIS MATTER,<br />
MEMBERS-OF THE OPPOSITION RELIED ON THE PRESS TO CREATE AN<br />
IMPRESSION OF NEW AND NEVER-ENDING REVELATIONS, WHEN THE<br />
PARLIAMENT WAS SITTING THEY INITIATED NOTHING, ALTHOUGH THE<br />
NATURE AND AMOUNT OF THE PROPOSED LOAN. HAD BEEN PUBLIC </p>
<p>6.<br />
KNOWLEDGE FROM THE SECOND WEEK OF FEBRUARY, WHEN THE SESSION<br />
BEGAN. ON NO OCCASION DID THE OPPOSITIO01 MOVE A SPECIFIC<br />
MOTION DEALING WITH OVERSEAS LOAN BORROWINGS, NOT UNTIL. THE<br />
LAST DAY OF SITTING DID IT MOVE FOR THE SUSPENSION OF<br />
STANDING ORDERS.<br />
11. FOR FOUR MONTHS, THEY TOOK NO OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE<br />
THE MATTER ON THE ADJOlURNMENT OR BY WAY OF AN URGENCY<br />
MOTION*.* IT REFUSED MY REPEATED I NVITATIONS TO PLACE<br />
QUESTIONS ON NOTICE. IT RELIED UPON NEWSPAPERS TO CREATE AN<br />
ATMOSPHERE, AND YET AT THE END OF IT ALL, THE RESEARCH TEAM<br />
OF JOURNALISTS OF THE MELBOURNE AGE, THE PAPER WHICH HAD<br />
BEEN MOST ACTIVE IN THE MATTER, HAD TO CONCEDE THE BASIC<br />
FACT REMAINED AS I STATED IT IN THE PARLIAMENT. IN<br />
YESTERDAY's AGE MR PETER COLE-ADAMS WROTE FROM LONDON:<br />
AS FAR AS WE KNOW AUSTRALI A HAS NOT IN FACT<br />
LOST ANY MONEY AS A RESULT OF THE AFFAIR.."<br />
ICOULD HAVE SAVED THE AGE 8,000 POUNDS STERLING BECAUSE ON<br />
26 MAY I TOLD THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSIT ION:<br />
" THERE HAS BEEN A VERY GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION<br />
ABOUT THIS. LET ME NAIL IT IMMEDIATELY. NOT A<br />
CENT HAS BEEN PAID TO THE GENTLEMAN, NOT A CENT<br />
HAS TO BE PAID TO THE GENTLEMAN. NOT A CENT WILL<br />
BE PAID TO THE GENTLEMAN." </p>
<p>7.<br />
THE AGE WILL NOT QUERY THEM IT WILL JUST CONDEMN, BEHIND<br />
THAT FACT LIE ALL THE OTHER BASIC FACTS WHICH THERE HAS<br />
NEVER BEEN THE SLIGHTEST ATTEMPT To CONCEAL. THEY ARE<br />
THESE: SINCE 1~ 4 DECEMBER 1974 THE MINISTER FOR MINERALS AND<br />
ENERGY MR CONNOR HAD EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AUTHORITY TO BORROW<br />
UP TO $ US10,00 MILLION AND TO DETERMINE ON BEHALF OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE<br />
BORROWING. THE MINISTER WAS ALSO AUTHORISED TO SIGN AND<br />
DELIVER PROMISSORY NOTES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE BORROW] NGI<br />
OR TO AUTHORISE ANY OTHER PERSON IN WRITING TO SIGN AND<br />
* DELIVER THE PROMISSORY NOTES. THAT AUTHORITY WAS REVOKED ON<br />
7 JANUARY 1975 SINCE IT HAD NOT BEEN USED AND IT CINFLICTED<br />
WITH A DEUTSCHMARK LOAN THEN PENDING# ON 28 JANUARY 1975<br />
THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AUTHORISED THE MINISTER TO RAISE A<br />
LOAN NOT EXCEEDING $ US2, OOO MILLION. THE AUTHORITY WAS<br />
REVOKED ON 20 MAY 1975 SINCE NEGOTIATIONS WERE IN TRAIN FOR<br />
A BORROWING OF $ US100 MILLION THROUGH MORGAN STANLEY CO,<br />
INCORPORATED OF NEW YORK. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AUTHORITIES ARE<br />
-USUALLY SOUGHT ONLY WHEN A LOAN MATTER APPROACHES FINALITY.<br />
THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT NEGOTIATIONS OR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT<br />
POSSIBIL ITIES ARE PRECLUDED WITHOUT EXECUTIVE COUNCIL<br />
AUTHORITY. 12. THE PURPOSE OF THE BORROWINGS, AS SET OUT IN THE<br />
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDA FOR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, WAS TO MEET<br />
THE NEEDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FOR ' SUBSTANTIAL SUMS<br />
OF NONEQUITY CAPITAL FROM ABROAD FOR TEMPORARY PURPOSES, </p>
<p>8.<br />
AMONGST OTHER THINGS TO DEAL WITH EXIGENCIES ARISING OUT OF<br />
THE CURRENT WORLD SITUATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY<br />
CRISIS, TO STRENGTHEN AUSTRALIA'S EXTERNAL FINANCIAL<br />
POSITION, TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE PROTECTION FOR AUSTRALIA' S<br />
SUPPLIES OF MINERALS AND ENERGY AND TO DEAL WITH CURRENT<br />
AND IMMEDIATELY FORESEEABLE UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA'<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO CARRY OUT THESE<br />
PURPOSES BY SPENDING THE BORROWED MONEYS ON DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
THE NATION IS EN ERGY RESOURCES. AT MY PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
ON 10 JUNE 1975 1 SAID THAT HENCEFORTH NO PERSON WILL HAVE<br />
ANY AUTHORITY TO DO ANYTHING IN RELATION TO BORROWINGS<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, UNLESS IT IS DONE WITH THE<br />
TREASURER'IS AUTHORITY.<br />
13, THESE ARE THE BASIC FACTS. THE-FUNDAMENTAL FACTS<br />
OF THE AUTHORISATION4S TO THE MINISTER; FIRST TO RAISE UP TO<br />
0 US4" AMI# LLIoONo 0AN0D THEN-TO . RA. ISE NO T MORE THAN $ US2; 000<br />
MILLION, WERE CONFIRMED BY THE MINISTER FOR MINERALS AND<br />
0ENERGY IN PARLIAMENT ON 23 APRIL IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION<br />
FROM THE DEPUTY LEADER O F THE OPPOS. ITI~ ON',* M'R LYNCH',' FROM. THE<br />
VERY OUTSET, AS EARLY AS 13 FEBRUARY -IN THIS HOUSE, ON<br />
THIS MATTER -IFREELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT OPEN GOVERNMENT DID<br />
NOT AND SHOULD NOT APPLY TO TWO FINANCIAL MATTERS -OVERSEAS<br />
BORROWINGS AND THE VALUE OF THE CURRENCY. THE REAL<br />
FINANCIAL UNORTHODOXY, THE REAL BREACH OF CONVENTION, LIES<br />
WITH THOSE WHO WOULD ASSERT THAT A RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT<br />
SHOULD NOT STR IVE TO PRESERVE CONFIDENTIALITY IN LOAN<br />
NEGOTIATIONS, </p>
<p>9.<br />
14L. WHAT WERE THEf-AL" INTERNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD TO CONFRONT? IN 1973 AND 1974<br />
ERUPTIONS OF UNPRECEDENTED MAGNITUDE SHOOK THE FINANCIAL<br />
WORLD. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SURPLUSES FROM THE SALE OF OIL<br />
BEGAN TO ACCUMULATE IN ENORMOUS QUANTITIES IN THE<br />
ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES WORLD,<br />
PRINCIPALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. SURPLUSES AMOUNTING TO NO<br />
C) LESS THAN $ US55 BILLION TO $ US6O BILLION ARE BELIEVED TO<br />
HAVE ACCUMULATED IN THIS WAY IN 1974 ALONE. THIS HUGE SHIFT<br />
IN THE LOCATION OF CAPITAL GREATLY ALTERED THE SITUATION OF<br />
THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OF NEW YORK AND LONDON WHICH HAD<br />
TRADITIONALLY DOMINATED THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL WORLD.<br />
THIS IS NOT TO SAY, OF COURSE, THAT THEY HAVE NOT STRUGGLED<br />
TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOLD ON INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL BUSINESS.<br />
LIKE THE REST OF US, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE HAD TO DEPEND ON THE<br />
OPEC COUNTRIES, THE MIDDLE EAST, FOR FUNDS.<br />
LET ME POINT OUT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY<br />
LARGE BORROWINGS OF PETRODOLLARS, SINCE THE OPEC-<br />
* SURPLUSES BEGAN TO ACCUMULATE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.<br />
IN AUGUST 19714 THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND RAISED<br />
$ US3,11 BILLION, AND THE WORLD BANK HAS MADE A SERIES OF<br />
QUITE LARG BORROWINGS, WE ALSO ARE AWARE OF INDIVIDUAL<br />
BORROWINGS OF $ US1 BILLION OR MORE BY THE UNITED<br />
KINGDOM,' JAPAN AND FRANCE.' BUT IF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
SEEKS IT.-THIS IS SINISTER, THIS IS A SCANDAL. THIS<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS INTERESTED IN OBTAINING LOANS FROM </p>
<p>THAT SOURCE, WE WERE LAST YEAR AND WE STILL ARE. W4E MAKE<br />
NO APOLOGIES FOR IT. IT IS ABSURD TO SUGGEST THAT THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT OR ANY FUTURE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE<br />
TO IGNORE THIS POTENTIAL SOURCE. No GOVERNMENT WILL. BE<br />
ABLE TO FLY IN THE FACE OF ECONOMIC REALITY FOR THE REST OF<br />
THIS CENTURY.<br />
16. SOURCES OF OVERSEAS LOAN DO CHANGES TODAY'S<br />
UNCONVENTIONAL SOURCES ARE TOMORROW'I S TRADITION4AL SOURCES.<br />
K WHENEVER POSSIBLE. PREVIOUS AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE<br />
READILY TURNED TO NEW SOURCES, EVEN THOUGH AT TIMES THERE<br />
HAS BEEN RESISTANCE AND CRITICISM, AT HOME AND ABROADS IN<br />
THE 190O'S AND 1930' s AUSTRALIA BORROWED MAINLY ON* THE*<br />
LONDON MARKET. l AFTER THE WAR WE BEGAN TO LOOK MUCH MORE TO<br />
THE UNITED STATES AND SWISS MARKETS, AND EVEN TO CANADA.<br />
THEN, WITH THE EFFECTIVE CLOSURE OF THE UNITED STATES<br />
CAPITAL MARKET AS A RESULT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE<br />
INTEREST EQUALISATION TAX IN 1963, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT TURNED To EUROCURRENCY RAISINGS IN TH E GERMAN.-<br />
DUTCH AND SWISS MARKETS. THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT ALSO.<br />
BORROWED ON THE JAPANESE MARKET.<br />
178 MANY MEMBERS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO SERVED IN<br />
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS, WILL BE AWARE THAT UNSOLICITED OFFERS<br />
OF OVERSEAS LOANS ARE RECEIVED FROM TIME TO TIME. THE VERY<br />
FACT THAT A NEW SOURCE OF BORROWINGS OF UNPRECEDENTED<br />
MAGNITUDE APPEARED IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAS MEANT THAT THERE </p>
<p>II1<br />
HAS BEEN A GREAT INCREASE IN4 THE OFFERS FROM PEOPLE OUTSIDE<br />
THE TRADITIONAL CHANNELS WHO HAVE CLAIMED TO HAVE ACCESS TO<br />
THESE FUNDS, OBVIOUSLY, A GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS MADE CLEAR<br />
ITS INTEREST IN SEEIKING SUCH FUNDS, AS WE HAVE, WILL<br />
RECEIVE A GREAT MANY SUCH OFFERS. THERE IS NO REASON IN<br />
PRUDENCE OR PROPRIETY WHY THEY SHOULD BE IGNORED, OR JUST<br />
PUSHED ASIDE. TREASURY RECORDS INDICATE THAT OV'ER THE LAST<br />
TEN YEARS FrHERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED NAMES<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH APPROXIMATELY 250 OFFERS CLAIMING ACCESS TO<br />
LOAN FUNDS AVAILABLE OVERSEAS. ALMOST ONE HUNDRED OF THESE<br />
OFFERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS, NO<br />
DOUBT AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE<br />
DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL FUNDS IN THE FINANCIAL WORLD,<br />
18. I HAVE HAD A SCHEDULE PREPARED IN THE TREASURY OF<br />
UNSOLICITED/ UNCONVENTIONAL OFFERS OF LOANS REFERRED TO THE<br />
TREASURER OR THE TREASURY BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN THE.<br />
PE RIOD 1950 TO 1975. THE SCHEDULE LISTS APPROACHES MADE<br />
WITHIN THE PERIOD INDICATED, THROUGH THENSERVING THREE<br />
STATE PREMIER'S SEVEN FEDERAL MINISTERS, TWO SENATORS, FIVE<br />
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, TWO STATE MEMBERS, ONE STATE<br />
TREASURER AND ONE FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESENT<br />
PRIME MINISTER, TO BE PRECISE, THROUGH MY DEPARTMENT, To<br />
PRESS THE POINT IMENTION THAT THE SCHEDULE INDICATES<br />
APPROACHES MADE THROUGH MY OWN GOOD OFFICES AND THOSE, TO<br />
QUOTE LIVING MEMBERS.-OF SENATOR THE HONOURABLE R. C. </p>
<p>12.<br />
WRIGHT, THE HONOURABLE SIR JOHN CRAMER, THE HONOURABLE<br />
DAVID FAIRBAIRN, THE HONOURABLE IAN SINCLAIR, THE RIGHT<br />
HONOURABLE JOHN GORTON, MR MICHAEL MACKELLAR., SENATOR THE<br />
HONOURABLE JOHN WHEELDON, THE HONO URABLE LES JOHNSON, THE<br />
HONOURABLE JIM CAIRNS AND 11R ARMITAGE.<br />
19. SOMETIMES THE APPROACH H AS BEEN MADE TO THE<br />
TREASURER HIMSELF. FOR INSTANCE, IN A LETTER DATED 7 APRIL<br />
0 1961, A MR PISTERMAN OF MELBOURNE, APPARENTLY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ATTORNEY OF A SWISS INSURANCE COMPANY, WROTE TO<br />
0 THE THEN AUSTRALIAN TREASURER, THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HAROLD<br />
HOLD PUTTING FORWARD A PROPOSITION FOR A BORROWINGS OF 205<br />
MILLION SWISS FRANCS IN SWIT* ZERL AND BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT, AFTER EXAMINATION BY THE TREASURY, AND<br />
MR PISTERMAN ABOUT THE PROPOSITION. SUBSEQUENTLY A SENIOR<br />
OFFICER OF THE TREASURY WHO WAS OVERSEAS IN CONNECTION WITH<br />
0 VARIOUS LOAN MATTERS VISITED SWITZERLAND AND HAD<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SWISS INSURANCE COMPANY TO WHOM<br />
MR PISTERMAN HAD DIRECTED HIM. NOTHING CAME OF THE MATTER.<br />
CLEARLY THE GOVERNMENT my GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALONE IN<br />
RESPONDING TO SUCH OFFERS AND FAIRLY IT MAY BE ASSUMED THAT<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS, AS WE SAY, AN OBLIGATION TO CHECK SUCH<br />
REFERENCES. THIS WE HAVE DONE AS HAVE PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENTS, IN THE CASE OF THE AUTHORITY TO THE MINISTER FOR<br />
MINERALS AND ENERGY, GREAT CARE WAS EXERC . ISED, WITH THE<br />
ASSISTANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGAL ADVISERS, TO ENSURE </p>
<p>~ tLZ~. Ufl~ 13.<br />
THAT THE INTERMEDIARY, MR K( HEMLANI, WOULD HAVE NO CLAIMS<br />
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS<br />
PROTECTED AT ALL POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED<br />
BORROWINGS. SWISS LAWYERS WERE ACTUALLY ENGAGED TO ADVISE<br />
AT THE SETTLEMENT STAGE AND ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR A<br />
SENIOR OFFICER AT ATTORNEY-GENERAL'-S DEPARTMENT TO GO TO<br />
SWITZERLAND TO BE PRESENT AT THE SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS.<br />
MR KHEMLANI WAS NOT AN AGENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
HE HAS ALL ALONG BEEN DEALT WITH BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT AS A PERSON REPRESENTING UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPALS.<br />
THE MINISTER WILL TABLE PAPERS RELATING TO THIS<br />
SECOND NEGOTIATION AND HERE, TOO, THE HOUSE CAN JUDGE FOR<br />
ITSELF. I REPEAT NOT A CENT HAS BEEN PAID, HAS TO BE PAID,<br />
WILL BE PAID TO THE GENTLEMAN.<br />
22. THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DELIBERATE CONFUSION CREATED<br />
ABOUT THE MANNER OF USE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THESE OVERSEAS<br />
BO RROWINGS. ANY MONEYS BORROWED BY THE GOVERNMENT WOULD<br />
BECOME PART OF THE LOAN FUND, IN THE PUBLIC ACCOUNT,<br />
REQUIRING AN APPROPRIATION BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR<br />
EXPENDITURE FOR THE PURPOSES OF AUSTRALIA. NONE OF THE<br />
MONEYS COU LD HAVE BEEN SPENT EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH<br />
PARLIAMENTARY APPROPRIATION.<br />
23. LOAN RAISINGS ARE NOT NORMALLY REFERRED TO<br />
CABINET FOR DECISION AND THEY WERE NOT IN THIS CASE. IT<br />
WAS PROPER TO AUTHORISE THE LOAN RAISING NEGOTIATIONS BY </p>
<p>1' 4,<br />
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL INSTRUMENT AND THIS WAS DONE. THE<br />
INITIAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING COMPRISED SENIOR<br />
MINISTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THIS INSTAN4CE MYSELF, THE<br />
THEN TREASURER, THE MINISTER FOR MINERALS AN4D ENERGY, AN4D<br />
THE THEN ATTORNEY-GENERAL. BEFORE MAKING THEIR<br />
RECOMMENDATION TO THE GOVERNORGENERAL, THE MINISTERS HAD<br />
THE ADVICE OF THE FIRST AND SECOND LAW OFFICERS OF THE<br />
CROWN. IT WAS PROPER FOR THE GOVERNORGENERAL TO ACT ON THE<br />
ADVICE OF HIS MINISTERS.<br />
24.1 IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE TREASURY HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT<br />
my GOVERNMENT'IS INTENTION TO AUTHORISE THE MINISTER FOR<br />
MINERALS AND ENERGY TO INVESTIGATE LOAN RAISING OVERSEAS IN<br />
THE TERMS OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AUTHORITY, I FREELY<br />
ADMIT THAT FACT, WHICH APPARENTLY HAS BECOME KNOWN TO THE<br />
OPPOSITION AND THE ELECTORATE THROUGH THE LEAKING OF<br />
DOCUMENTS. IN THE EVENT WE TOOK THE ADVICE OF OTHER<br />
DEPARTMENTS. IN SAYING THAT WE DID NOT ACCEPT THE TREASURY<br />
RESERVATIONS I MAKE NO APOLOGY, AS I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S ORIGINAL CONCEPT OF BORROWING EXTENSIVE<br />
PETRODOLLARS FOR CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT. NOR SHOULD Is IT IS<br />
AN ARROGANT SUGGESTION" THAT A GOVERNMENT, WHATEVER ITS<br />
POLICIES, SHOULD BE FRUSTRATED IN ITS DECISIONS BECAUSE OF<br />
ANY BUREAUCRATIC OPPOSITON.<br />
IS THERE ANY REAL CHALLENGE TO THIS VIEW FROM THE<br />
OPPOSITON? CERTAINLY THERE WAS NONE WHEN IT WAS IN<br />
GOVERNMENT, IF IT NEEDS SUPPORT, I NEED GO NO FURTHER THAN </p>
<p>THE 1968 GARRAN ORATION BY THE FORMER GOVERNoRGENERAL AND<br />
FORMER MINISTER OF THE CROWN, SIR PAUL HASLUCK, WHO<br />
EXAMINED V'ERY CLOSELY THE PROPER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
ADVISERS AND MINISTERS.<br />
26. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER AUTHORITIES, SUCH AS<br />
THOSE QUOTED BY THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL IN THE MEMORAN4DUM<br />
INCORPORATED IN TODAY'IS HANSARD. THIS REACHES TO THE HEART<br />
O OF THE MATTER THE REAL ORIGINS OF THIS PRESENT<br />
CONTROVERSY, OUR DECISION HAD POLITICAL OBJECTIVES, IT<br />
o WAS A DECISION ABOUT POLICIES.<br />
27. THOSE-POLICIES MEET* OPPOSITION FROM MANY<br />
QUARTERS. SOME OF THE OPPOSITION COMES FROM THOSE QUARTERS<br />
WHO PREFER TO BELIEVE THEY ARE THREATENED OR DISADVANTAGED<br />
BY OUR POLICIES AND OUR PROGRAM. THE ALLEGATIONS OF<br />
0 IMPROPRIETY ARE JUST A SMOKESCREEN FOR THE REAL GROUND OF<br />
OPPOSITION. THE WAY TO DESTROY THE POLICIES IS TO DESTROY<br />
Q THE MEN WHO PROMOTE THEM.<br />
it 28. THERE IS NO PART OF THE PROGRAM OF THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT SO DEPLORED AND RESISTED BY THE BUSINESS<br />
ESTABLISHMENT THE NATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT AND THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT, THE ORTHODOX AT HOME AND<br />
ABROAD. THAN OUR DETERMINATION THAT AUSTRALIANS SHALL HAVE<br />
THE MAXIMUM SHARE IN THE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'IS RESOURCES.<br />
29. EQUALLY, THERE WAS NO ASPECT OF OUR PROGRAM WHICH<br />
RECEIVED MORE SUPPORT FROM THE AUSTRAAAN PEOPLE IN TWO </p>
<p>16,<br />
ELECTIONS, IN THE 19741 ELECTION1 IT WAS PERHAPS THE<br />
DECISIVE ISSUE THE ENEMIES OF THAT POLICY KNOW1 THAT THE<br />
PEOPLE SUPPORT IT, THEREFORE, TO0 DISCOURAGE POPULAR<br />
SUPPORT FOR THE POLICY, THE METHODS THROUGH WHICH THAT<br />
POLICY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED MUST BE DISCREDITED,<br />
BECAUSE THE LOAN PROPOSALS WHICH THE MINISTER FOR<br />
MINERALS AND ENERGY WAS GIVEN AUTHORITY TO PURSUE WERE TO<br />
BE THE VEHICLE FOR CARRYING OUT THOSE POLICIES, THE<br />
PROPOSAL ITSELF MUST BE DISCREDITED. THE BORROWINGS WE<br />
SEEK'FOR ENERGY PURPOSES IN4VOLVE PROJECTS OF IMMENSE SCOPE<br />
AND GREAT CONSEQUENCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA BY<br />
AUSTRALIANS. THOSE PROJECTS'INVOLVE IMMENSE SUMS OF MONEY.<br />
31. A FEATURE OF THIS WHOLE AFFAIR HAS BEEN THE WAY<br />
IN WHICH FIGURES HAVE BEEN WILDLY BANDIED ABOUT. THE FACT<br />
IS THAT OVER A PERIOD MR CONNOR-DISCUSSED VARIOUS SUMS WITH<br />
MR KHEMLANi. AT NO STAGE, HOWEVER, WAS THERE AUTHORITY TO<br />
CONCLUDE ANY BORROWING OUTSIDE THE TERMS OF THE TWO<br />
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AUTHORITIES.. IT WOULD BE ABSURED TO<br />
SUGGEST OTHERWISE. EQUALLY THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DELIBERATE<br />
CONFUSION ABOUT TH. E NATURE OF COSTS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN<br />
PAID. IN FACT THE INTEREST RATESPROPOSED AND THE EXPENSES<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOAN, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, WERE NEVER<br />
AT ALL OUT OF THE ORDINARY BY COMPARISON WITH OTHER<br />
GOVERNMENT LOAN RAISINGS OVERSEAS. FOR INSTANCE, DURING<br />
19711-75, THERE WERE TEN OVERSEAS BORROWINGS BY THE<br />
0' </p>
<p>17.<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE GERMANI SWISS AND NEW YORK<br />
MARKETS. THE HIGHEST RATE PAID WAS 10 PER CENT FOR A<br />
GERMAN LOAN OF 200 MILLION DEUTrSCHMARKS IN SEPTEMBER 1.97L1,.<br />
WITH AN ISSUE PRICE OF 99 PER CENT AND TOTAL EXPENSES<br />
ESTIMATED AT 2.22 PER CENT. AS A RESULT THE YIELD TO THE<br />
INVESTOR WAS 10.23 PER CENT AND THE COST TO THE B3ORROWER<br />
10.74 PER CENT, THE INTEREST RATES FOR ALL THE OTHER LOANS<br />
0 WERE INTH E RANGE OF 8 TO 10 PER CENT. EXPENSES OF<br />
BORROWING HAVE ALSO FLUCTUATED, AND IN A NUMBER OF<br />
0 INSTANCES TOTAL EXPENSES HAVE EXCEEDED 5 PER CENT OF THE<br />
FACE VALUE OF A LOAN FOR INSTANCE LOANS RAISED IN<br />
SWITZERLAND IN 1967; 1968 AND-1970 WHEN THE RIGHT<br />
HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN WHO INTERJECTS WAS TREASURER, A Swiss<br />
LOAN RAISED AS RECENTLY AS MARCH 1975 HAD A COUPON RATE OF<br />
8 PER CENT, AN ISSUE PRICE OF 100 PER CENT AND TOTAL<br />
EXPENSES ESTIMATED AT 4.' 37 PER CENTS THE PROPOSAL<br />
BORROWING BEING NEGOTIATED THROUGH MR KHEMLARI HAD A<br />
COMPANY RATE OF 8.35 PER CENT, AN ISSUE RATE OF 100 PER<br />
CENT, AND IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL EXPENSES, INCLUDING<br />
THE COMMISSION, WOULD BE MET BY THE LENDER. THIS WOULD<br />
HAVE MEANT THAT THE YIELD TO THE LENDER AND THE COST TO THE<br />
BORROWER WOULD ALSO BE 8.35 PER CENT.<br />
32. FURTHER, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT SUMS LIKE $ US2,000<br />
MILLION ARE SO VAST AS TO BE UNMANAGEABLE OR UNUSABLE. YET<br />
ONLY THIS WEEK, CONZINC RiOTINTO OF AUSTRALIA LTD, MADE A </p>
<p>18,<br />
SUBMISSION TO THE INQUIRY INTO THE PETROLEUM AND MINING<br />
INDUSTRIES BEINIG CONDUCTED BY THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE<br />
COMMISSION, IN ITS SUBMISSION, CRA CLAIMS THAT AUSTRALIA<br />
WILL NEED TO IN\ VEST MORE THAN $ 4,000 MILLION TO BOOST<br />
MINERAL PRODUCTION BY 1980 TO MAINTAIN AUSTRALIA'IS POSITION<br />
IN THE WORLD MINERALS TRADE. IT IS INVESTMENT OF THIS<br />
MAGNITUDE WE HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT, LET ME RECALL<br />
SOME OF THE MATTERS WHICH WERE CONCERNING THE GOVERNMENTALONG<br />
WITH ALL GOVERNMENTS IN COMPARABLE COUNTRIES WHEN<br />
DRAFTING THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MINUTE OF LAST DECEMBER.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT WAS RISING TO A LEVEL QUITE UNACCEPTABLE TO MY<br />
GOVERNMENT, THE WORLD ENERGY CRISIS HAD SHOWN NO SIGNS OF<br />
EASING, WORLDWIDE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COMPOUNDED BOTH<br />
PROBLEMS. 339 WE SAW ONE OPPORTUNITY TO COUNTER THESE<br />
TEMPORARY, SHORTTERM PRESSURES ON4 OUR ECONOMY AND OUR<br />
ENERGY SOURCES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REAPING LONG-TERM<br />
BENEFITS OF ENDURING SIGNIFICANCE To AUSTRALIA, IF THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY WAS TO BE SEIZED, WE KNEW WE SHOULD ACT<br />
PROMPTLY. WE WANTED TO DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY WE WERE HOPING<br />
TO RAISE QUITE PROMPTLY IN A WAY WHICH WOULD MOST<br />
EFFECTIVELY COUNTER THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS FACING THE<br />
NATION. THESE WERE THE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH PROMPTED OUR URGENCY.<br />
314. THE OPERATION OF THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT WAS OF COURSE<br />
CONSIDERED, THE FORMER ATTORNEY-GENERAL ADVISED ORALLY<br />
THAT IN THE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE OUTLINED, THE </p>
<p>19.<br />
BORROWING COULD PROBABLY BE REGARDED AS A BOR'ROWIING FOR<br />
' TEMPORARY PURPOSES' WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FINANCIAL<br />
AGREEMENT. THERE WERE NO REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FINANCIAL<br />
AGREEMENT FOR CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE PREMIERS FOR A<br />
BORROWING OF THIS KIN4D FOR TEMPORARY PURPOSES. IT IS OF<br />
COURSE USUAL AND PROPER FOR LOANS TO BE SOUGHT OVERSEAS IN<br />
ADVANCE OF LOAN COUNCIL APPROVAL. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />
OF A PROPOSED OVERSEAS BORROWING ARE USUALLY REFERRED FOR<br />
APPROVAL TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LOAN COUNCIL THE<br />
STATES -ONLY WHEN THERE IS A FIRM PROPOSITION TO PUT TO<br />
THEM. IMADE OUR POSITION QUITE CLEAR IN THE HOUSE ON<br />
MAY.* THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION ASKED ME WHEN WOULD THE<br />
GOVERNMENT SEEK APPROVAL OF THE LOAN COUNCIL FOR THE<br />
PROPOSED 2,000 MILLION BORROWING BY THE MINISTER FOR<br />
MINERALS AND ENERGY$<br />
IANSWERED: " IF AND WHEN THE LOAN IS MADE"<br />
HE ASKED " WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LOAN?"<br />
IANSWERED: " FOR MATTERS RELATED TO ENERGY" </p>
<p>PROVIDED WI1TH THE CAPITAL, AUSTRALIA'S VAST<br />
OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP ITS ENERGY RESOURCES COULD BE<br />
QUICKLY REALISED. THE NATION, EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY<br />
WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR URANIUM, OUR<br />
NATURAL GAS, OUR COAL OUR IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES OF<br />
ENERGY. AUSTRALIA'IS WEALTH OF URANIUM RESOURCES OFFERS<br />
VAST OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ENRICHME14T<br />
PLANT. WE ARE DETERMINED TO EXPLOIT WIESTERN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
ENORMOUS NATURAL GAS POTENTIAL THE NORTHWEST SHELF<br />
BELONGING To AUSTRALIA RATHER THAN SELLING OFF THIS VITAL<br />
PART OF AUSTRALIA'S FARM.<br />
36. IN ORDER TO TAP THE* NATURAL GAS RESOURCES IN<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA, NEW SOUTH WALES AND OFF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,<br />
WE HAVE UNDER CONSI DERATION PROPOSALS COSTING OVER $ 1400<br />
MILLION FOR PIPELINES. My GOVERNMENT IS EXPLORING WAYS OF<br />
USING THE VAST COAL DEPOSITS IN NEW SOUTH WALES, QUEENSLAND<br />
AND VICTORIA TO PRODUCE OIL BY HYDROGENATION AGAIN AN<br />
ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE OPERATION. THE GROWING COAL MARKET IS<br />
INHIBITED BY THE LACK OF ADEQUATE PORT FACILITIES. WE MUST<br />
UPGRADE OUR MAJOR COAL PORTS. AUSTRALIA IS HEAVILY<br />
DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN-OWNED SHIPPING FOR THE CARRIAGE OF HER<br />
TRADE. WE. ARE'ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN VESSELS TO<br />
CARRY OUR CRUDE OIL IMPORTS. WE SHOULD NOT BE SO DEPENDENT<br />
ON FOREIGN SHIPPING FOR SUCH VITAL RESOURCES, WE NEED<br />
EQUIPMENT TO ELECTRIFY OUR RAILWAYS IN BRISBANE AND<br />
ADELAI'DE AND MANY TRUNK LINES I . N THE EASTERN STATES,' </p>
<p>21.<br />
37. THESE ARE THE GREAT, THE CHALLENGING USES TO WHICH<br />
WE WERE CONTEMPLATING PUTTING THE FUNDS, ARE WE TO<br />
APOLOGISE FOR SEEKING THESE GOALS? ARE WE TO APOLOGISE FOR<br />
OUR DETERMINATION OUR CONTINUING DETERMINATION -TO SEE<br />
THEM REALISED, OF COURSE, IN ALL SUCH PROJECTS, NOTHING<br />
SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE FULL INVESTIGATION OF THEIR<br />
FEASIBILITY AND COST BENEFITS. QUITE CLEARLY, THERE IS NO<br />
POINT IN INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY OF PROJECTS LIKELY<br />
TO COST AT LEAST $ A3,0OO MILLION, IF ONE HAS NO PROSPECT OF<br />
RAISING SUCH FUNDS. To MAINTAIN AND TO INCREASE OWNERSHIP<br />
BY-THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA OF OUR OWN RESOURCES CALL FOR<br />
IMMENSE SUMS OF MONEY FAR BEYOND EVEN OUR VERY HIGH<br />
* PROPENSITY TO SAVE. WE NEED FOREIGN CAPITAL, BUT AS LOAN<br />
FUNDS, NOT AS EQUITY, IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT WE WERE<br />
AND STILL ARE PREPARED AND ANXIOUS TO BORROW THESE SUMS OF<br />
MONEY ON THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE CREDIT, OUR OWN COUNTRY<br />
AND THE WEALTH OF OUR OWN RESOURCES. AND THE REAL<br />
* OPPOSITION TO THIS LOAN PROPOSAL COMES FROM THOSE HOSTILE<br />
TO THAT OBJECTIVE.<br />
381, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY SOME OF OUR CRITICS THAT<br />
THESE BORROWINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN * INFALTIONARY. IN ECONOMIC<br />
TERMS OF, COURSE, THIS IS PURE NONSENSE, THE PROCEEDS OF<br />
THESE BORROWINGS WOULD OF COURSE HAVE BEEN INVESTED.<br />
OVERSEAS UNTIL THEY WERE REQUIRED, PROBABLY IN NEW YORK<br />
WHERE A GOOD PART OF OUR INTERNATIONAL RESERVES ARE NOW<br />
INVESTED AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS PAST. DOES THE OPPOSITION </p>
<p>22,<br />
SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD BE INFLATIONARY TO IMPORT PIPES,<br />
TANKERS, HYDROGENATION AND ELECTRIFICATION EQUIPMENT,<br />
MINING AND INCLUDING MACHINERY, ALL OR MOST OF WHICH WE<br />
MUST IMPORT. WOULD IT BE INFLATIONARY TO PURCHASE SHARES<br />
IN AUSTRALIAN ENTERPRISES FROM THEIR PRESENT OWNERS IN<br />
LONDON AND NEW YORK?<br />
39. WE SAW OPPORTUNITY THROUGH WHICH THE OBJECTIVES<br />
SO STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE IN THE LAST<br />
TWO ELECTIONS COULD BE PURSUED, THAT PARTICULAR<br />
OPPORTUNITY HAS NOT YET BEEN REALISED. IF THE OPPORTUNITY<br />
PRESENTS ITSELF WITH REASONABLE CHANCE OF SUCCESS, WE SHALL<br />
TRY AGAIN, IT IS OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER EVERY<br />
ALLEGATION, EVERY INNUENDO THROWN UP BY THE OPPOSITION, BY<br />
THE MEDIA, IN ALL THE OUTPOURINGS OF THE LAST WEEK. IN THE<br />
EXACT WORDS OF THE ABSENT RIGHT HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR<br />
. HIGGINS MR ( ORTON, IN A VERY DIFFERNET CONTEXT IN VERY<br />
DIFFERENT DAYS,<br />
" I CANNOT FOLLOW THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION<br />
DOWN EVERY MANHOLE, THROUGH EVERY SEWER<br />
SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR<br />
HIGGINS, OVERWHELMED BY A COMBINATION OF THE PRESENT LEADER<br />
OF THE OPPOSITION AND THE INTERESTS WHO OPPOSED HIS EFFORTS<br />
TO SECURE GREATER AUSTRALIAN CONTROL OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
RESOURCES. </p>
<p>23.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A THIRD LOAN NEGOTIATION BY THE<br />
WAY IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN GIVEN A SINISTER CONNOTATION, AND<br />
THE WAY IN WHICH THE NAME OF A MINISTER BEHAVING WITH<br />
PERFECT PROPRIETY HAS BEEN DRAGGED IN, IT EPITOMISES THE<br />
CONDUCT AND ENCAPSULES THE MOTIVES OF THE OPPOSITION. THE<br />
TELEVISION PROGRAM " THIS DAY TONIGHT" ON 22 MAY ALLEGED<br />
THAT THE TREASURY WAS NEGOTIATING A LOAN WITH TRANSIA<br />
CORPORATION LTD, IN FACT THAT COMPANY HAD BEEN INFORMED IN<br />
FEBRUARY BY THE TREASURER THAT THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT WISH<br />
TO TAKE ANY FURTHER ACTION IN RELATION TO ITS PROPOSAL.<br />
THERE WAS A FURTHER APPROACH FROM TRANSIA CORPORATION IN<br />
APRIL 1975*, THIS TIME THROUGH SIR WILLIAM GUNN', A<br />
S HAREHOLDER OF THE COMPANY AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE BOARD<br />
OF THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
41. A PROPOSAL FOR $ US3.7 BILLION IN LOAN FUNDS WAS<br />
PUT FORWARD. SIR WILLIAM RANG THE MINISTER FOR NORTHERN<br />
AUSTRALIA DR PATTERSON, THE TREASURER BEING UNAVAILABLE, DR<br />
PATTERSON PASSED THE MESSAGE ON TO THE TREASURER, RECEIVED<br />
CONFIRMATION FROM THE TREASURER. THAT THE GoVERNEMNT WAS<br />
INTERESTED IN RAISING LOAN FUNDS AND PASSED A RESPONSE BACK<br />
TO SIR WILLIAM GUNN. ON 20 APRIL 1975 SIR FREDERICK<br />
WHEELER THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TELEPHONED SIR<br />
WILLIAM TO SAY THAT THE GOV'ERNMENT WAS TAKING NO ACTION IN<br />
RESPECT OF PROPOSALS HE HAD MADE. IWAS INFORMED ABOUT<br />
TRANSIA CORPORATION'S INVOLVEMENT ON 23 APRIL 1975 IN<br />
RESPECT OF ANSEPARATE APPRAOCH BY THE COMPANY. ON THIS </p>
<p>OCCASION THE COMPANY WAS REFERRED BY THE TREASURER'S OFFICE<br />
TO THE MINISTER FOR MINERALS AND ENERGY AND SUBSEQUENT<br />
DEALINGS WITH TRANSIA CORPORATION LTD, WERE CONDUCTED BY<br />
THE MINISTER's DEPARTMENT. THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE<br />
TO SATISFY THE GOVERNMENT'IS REQUIREMENTS AS TO THE<br />
VERIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION4 OF FUNDS AND NOTHING AS<br />
EVENTUATED. 42*, THE PAPERS RELATING To TRANSIA CORPORATION CAN BE<br />
MADE AVAILABLE BUT I WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO PUBLISH THEM.<br />
MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE MENTIONED. PEOPLE IN THE<br />
FINANCIAL WORLD ARE NAMED AND THEIR STANDING COMMENTED ON.<br />
THE PAPERS RELATE TO TRANSACTIONS IN A DELICATE AREA OF<br />
BUSINESS AND COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO FEEL<br />
I'N DEALING WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE NORMAL<br />
CONFIDENTIALITY WILL APPLY. SURELY THERE HAS TO BE AN END<br />
TO THE ATTEMPTED DESTRUCTION BY THE OPPOSITION OF THE<br />
COUNTRY'IS GOOD NAME AND REPUTATION AND TO THESE. INSIDIOUS<br />
IMPUTATIONS AGAINST MINISTERS, COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS.<br />
43*. OF COURSE*, IN THAT RESPECT, T . HIS HA S BEEN A<br />
DAMAGING AFFAIR.. THE OPPOSITION-INTENDED IT TO BE A<br />
DAMAGING AFFAIR. NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO CHECK THE<br />
BONA FIDES OR MOTIVES OF NOTORIETY HUNTERS AND SELFSEEKSERS,<br />
ATTEMPTS TO DAMAGE MINISTERS AND THE LABOR PARTY<br />
ARE ONE THING -ATTEMPTS TO DAMAGE AUSTRALIA AND </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA'S CREDIT ARE ANOTHER. THESE HAVE FAILED. OF ALL<br />
THE CHARGES MADE THE ONE THAT CAN BE MOST QUICKLY AND FULLY<br />
DISPRO\ VED IS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DAMAGED<br />
AUSTRALIA' S CREDIT-WORTHINESS BY SEEKIN4G THE PETRODOLLAR<br />
LOAN', THE TRUTH IS THAT AUSTRALIA'IS CREDIT HAS NEVER STOOD<br />
HIGHER.' LAST OCTOBER [ IIOODY'S*, ONE OF THE TWO GREAT NEW<br />
YORK CREDIT RATED AGENCIES, HAVE AUSTRALIA, FOR THE FIRST<br />
QTIME, AN AAA RATING, THE H IGHEST AVAILABLE. ON 9 JUNE, AT<br />
A TIME WHEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL COMMUNITY WAS<br />
COMPLETELY AWARE OF OUR PROPOSAL TO RAISE THE LOANS WHICH<br />
ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT CONTROVERSY, THAT AAA RATING<br />
WAS CONFIRMED BY STANIDARD POOR'S. THE OTHER NEW YORK<br />
CREDIT MATING AGENCY,<br />
414. FOR THE WHOLE PERIOD OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE<br />
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AUTHORITY, OUR CREDIT RATING HAS REMAINED<br />
AT THE HIGHEST. IF THAT IS NOT ENOUGH, LET ME POINT TO THE<br />
EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL $ US100 MILLION LOAN FLOATED IN THE NEW<br />
0 YORK MARKET IN JUNE. NEW YORK INVESTORS EXPRESSED A<br />
CONFIDENCE IN AUSTRALIA'S CREDIT WHICH SOME AUSTRALIANS<br />
SEEM QUITE WILLING TO UNDERMINE. ICANNOT TAKE ANY<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE OUR OPPONENTS'I APPRAOCH MAY<br />
HAVE; BUT WHERE IT REALLY COUNTS AND WHERE IT CAN REALLY BE<br />
TESTED, WE FIND AUSTRALIA'S CREDIT HIGHER THAN AT ANY TIME<br />
IN OUR HISTORY$ </p>
<p>26.<br />
LET ME BRING ALL THESE POINTS TOGETHER IN ONE<br />
SUMMARY OF ALL THE ISSUES INVOLVED. AT NO TIME WAS<br />
PARLIAMENT MISLED ABOUT THE NATURE, SIZE OR SOURCE OF OUR<br />
LOAN PROPOSALS, THEIR PURPOSE WAS TO PURSUE POLICIES IN<br />
THE INTERPESTS OF AUSTRALIAN CONTROL OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
RESOURCES, THE PROPOSAL WAS ECONOMICALLY SOUND. LEGALADVICE<br />
WAS OBTAINED FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGAL ADVISERS<br />
BEFORE THE MINISTER FOR MINERALS AND ENERGY WAS GIVEN<br />
AUTHORITY BY THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL TO PROCEED WITH<br />
NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE LOAN, PROPER CARE WAS EXERCISED WITH<br />
THE ASSISTANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGAL ADVISERS TO ENSURE<br />
THAT THE INTERMEDIARY IN THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE NO CLAIM<br />
AGAINST AUSTRALIA OR THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
AUSTRALIA AND THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WERE PROTECTED AT<br />
ALL POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED BORROWING.<br />
PROPER CHECKS WERE MADE ON THE BONA FIDES OF THE GENTLEMAN<br />
INVOLVED, NOT ONE CENT HAS BEEN PAID OR WILL BE PAID OR IS<br />
LIABLE TO BE PAID TO THE INTERMEDIARY, THERE HAS BEEN NO<br />
IMPROPRIETY ON THE PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
THERE HAVE BEEN NO BREACHES OF THE LAW. AUSTRALIA'S<br />
INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION AS A GOVERNMENT WITH PRIME<br />
BORROWING STATUS REMAINS UNCHANGED, REMAINS AS HIGH AS IT<br />
HAS EVER BEEN. THESE ARE THE REAL MATTERS AT ISSUE, THESE<br />
ARE THE IMPORTANT ISSUES. </p>
<p>27.<br />
46. IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS:<br />
WAS THERE IMPROPRIETY IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT SEEKING A LOAN WHICH WOULD HELP PROMOTE<br />
AUSTRALIA'S IMMEDIATE AND URGENT WELLBEING AND PROMOTE<br />
GREAT LONGTERM AUSTRALIAN OBJECTIVES? WAS THERE ANY<br />
IMPROPRIETY IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE THOSE OBJECTIVES? THE<br />
OBJECTIVES WERE PROPER' THE MEANS WERE PROPER. LET THOSE<br />
WHO SAY OTHERWISE NOW SPECIFY THEIR ALLEGATIONS OF<br />
IMPROPRIETY OR ILLEGALITY SPECIFY THE PRECISE CHARGE, THE<br />
PRECISE BREACH.<br />
47. THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE SOUGHT THE LOAN COMMAND<br />
THE CLEAR SUPPORT OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. THE PURPOSES,<br />
THE MEANS WERE PERFECTLY PROPER. THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
HAVE SHOWN THEIR CLEAR SUPPORT FOR OUR OBJECTIVES IN<br />
PROMOTING AUSTRALIAN CONTROL OF AUSTRALIAN RESOURCES, WHICH<br />
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
CONTROL OVER AUSTRALIA'S DESTINY,<br />
48, IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THESE GREAT OBJECTIVES, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WILL DESPISE THE PETTINESS, THE SELFSERVING,<br />
OF THOSE WHO HAVE CHOSEN THIS ISSUE TO UNDERMINE<br />
THE FULFILMENT OF THOSE OBJECTIVES. THEY WILL QUICKLY SEE<br />
THAT THOSE WHO WOULD USE ANY WEAPON TO DAMAGE THIS </p>
<p>28.<br />
GOVERNMENT, DO NOT GIVE A DAMN IF IN THE PROCESS, THEY<br />
DAMAGE AUSTRALIA HERSELF. THAT IS THE GREAT IMPROPRIETY IN<br />
THIS AFFAIR THE WILFUL ATTEMPT TO DAMAGE AUSTRALIA, HER<br />
CREDIT, THE PEOPLE' IS CHANCE TO CONTROL AND DEVELOP THE<br />
RESOURCES OF THEIR OWN LAND. THOSE EFFORST WILL FAIL AS<br />
THEY DESERVE. AUSTRALIA'S. CREDIT REMAINS UNTARNISHED; AND<br />
ON ANY CHARGE OF IMPROPRIETY OR ANY TOLERATION OF<br />
IMPROPRIETY, THE RECORD WILL SHOW THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS<br />
EQUALLY UNTARNISHED, </p>
