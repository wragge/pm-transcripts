PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. RATING<br />
THE BUDGET<br />
Following meetings today with WA ( Green Senators and<br />
Democrat Leader Kernot and Senator Harradine the<br />
Government has reached agreement to secure passage of the<br />
second tranche of the wholesale sa. les tax increase<br />
announced in the Budget.<br />
The measures meet the concerns of the minor parties in<br />
the Senate which have sought increased assistance for low<br />
income earners and the unemployed to offset announced<br />
increases in the wholesale sales tax.<br />
The measures include an increase in the Additional Family<br />
Payment, further assistance to the unemployed, and<br />
changes to the HECS scheme and Emergency Relief Program.<br />
The Additional Family Payment was raised in three<br />
discussions independent of each other by Green Senators,<br />
Senator Kernot immediately post-Budget and by Senator<br />
Harradine who has argued a case fcr single-income<br />
famil ies.<br />
It also proposed to limit the increase in excise on<br />
kerosene, fuel. oil and heating oil to the 3 cents a litre<br />
that has applied since Budget night. To alleviate the<br />
higher transport costs to Tasmanian industry, Senator<br />
Harradine has urged that * the* Government inc-rease the<br />
Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme and provide<br />
compensation for the Bass Strait passenger service. The<br />
Government has agreed to such an increase.<br />
The necessary legislation for the proposed changes will<br />
be introduced over -the -next few wceks.<br />
The total cost of the measures shown on the attachment is<br />
$ 17 million in this year, rising to $ 144 million by 1996-<br />
97. </p>
<p>The Treasurer and 1[ believe the agreed changes are a<br />
reasonable compromise which do no: undermine the<br />
Government's medium-term debt reduction strategy and are<br />
consistent with the intentions of the Government for<br />
future Budgets.<br />
Even with the proposed changes thi? prospective deficit<br />
remains around 1 per cent of GDP tgor 1996/ 97.<br />
Today's agreement is a welcome development for the<br />
economy. It will help restore confidence to industry and<br />
provide an impetus to the encouraging signs of recovery<br />
already evident in the economy.<br />
