PRIME MINJISTER 4/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, ! 4P<br />
OLD JOCKEY, NEW COLOURS, SAME HORSE.<br />
I congratulate Mr Howard on his election once -again to<br />
the leadership of the Liberal Party.<br />
No one has ever doubted Mr Howard's ambition, his<br />
persistence and his willingness to stay long enough to<br />
see everyone else off the scene though in the post-<br />
Menzies Liberal Party that has not necessarily amounted<br />
to an exceedingly long time.<br />
I said after Mr Downer's election, the problem for the<br />
Liberal Party is the horse not the jockey, and I was<br />
pleased to see Dr Hewson, among others on the<br />
conservative side, take up the refrain. But nothing in<br />
the election of Mr Howard or his remarks at today's press<br />
conference suggests that the Liberal Party understands<br />
what it means.<br />
Having put an old jockey on board the horse, the Liberal<br />
Party is now trying to change his colours. Mr Howard has<br />
declared himself the most conservative leader the Liberal<br />
Party has ever had. In the 1980s he was a leading<br />
advocate of the New Right. Essentially, he sounds<br />
little different these days.<br />
Today he attempted to skirt the issues on which his views<br />
reflect the deeply reactionary basis of his politics. But<br />
it is hard to say what sounded more improbable Mr<br />
Howard talking about I'modernising' Australia, or<br />
suggesting that he was a little liberal after all.<br />
Mr Howard is the Liberal Party's most experienced<br />
parliamentary member. He is said to be its most<br />
articulate spokesman. Yet in his era in office and out<br />
the Liberal Party has been a comprehensive failure.<br />
No one speaks more eloquently of that failure than Mr<br />
Howard. No one speaks better for the fact that the<br />
Federal Liberal Party lacks national vision and a<br />
national perspective.<br />
And no-one speaks better for the dry, regressive, deeply<br />
conservative spirit which has driven every moderate<br />
influence from its senior ranks.<br />
