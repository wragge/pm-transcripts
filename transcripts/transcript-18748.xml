    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>Today I extend Australia's condolences to the nation and people of New Zealand, who have suffered another grievous loss in Afghanistan with the death of three brave soldiers in a bomb blast overnight.</p>
<p>This news is particularly painful coming just two weeks after the deaths of two New Zealand soldiers, and the wounding of six others, in the same province.</p>
<p>The thoughts of the Australian people are today with New Zealand, and in particular with the families who have lost loved ones and with the soldiers who have lost comrades.</p>
<p>New Zealand has made a significant contribution to ensuring Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for international terrorism. </p>
<p>As a valued partner of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), New Zealand is supporting Bamyan Province through the transition to Afghan security leadership.</p>
