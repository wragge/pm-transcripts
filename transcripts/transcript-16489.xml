    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government strongly condemns today's missile launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). </p>
<p>We are deeply concerned by this provocative act which breaches United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718.</p>
<p>Even if the launch involves the deployment of a satellite, Australia considers that the use of missile technology  -  the same technology that the DPRK uses for its offensive ballistic missile program  -  breaches the UN Resolution.</p>
<p>We urge the United Nations Security Council to immediately consider further action.</p>
<p>Instead of engaging in this provocative action, the DPRK is urged to work constructively with others involved in the Six-Party Talks towards resolving the challenges on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>Australia is a strong supporter of the Six-Party Talks and will continue to work closely with member countries to encourage the DPRK to denuclearise and abandon its ballistic missile program. </p>
