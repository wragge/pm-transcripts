PRIME MINISTERI<br />
FOR MEDIASATURDAY, 19 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
The attached letter has been sent to the Premier of<br />
South Australia, Mr Bannon, -today. </p>
<p>PRimE MINSTER C ANDE RRA<br />
19FEB193<br />
My dear Pr er,<br />
I refer to our telephone conversation this evening<br />
and attach the text of a press announcement I am<br />
making about the initial financial assistance the<br />
Commonwealth proposes to provide to South Australia<br />
and Victoria.<br />
The Commonwealth, of course, stands ready to give<br />
urgent and sympathetic consideration to measures<br />
your Government may wish to propose to restore<br />
and rebuild communities, in addition to those already<br />
provided for under the Natural Disasters Relief<br />
Arrangements. As initial instalments of Commonwealth financial<br />
assistance under those arrangements, I propose that<br />
$ 6 million be provided to South Australia and I have<br />
also offered to the Premier of Victoria an advance of<br />
million against the Commonwealth's final<br />
contributions under the NDRA.<br />
The Commonwealth is also prepared to extend categories<br />
of assistance beyond the core measures under the NORA.<br />
Details of these extensions are set out in the attached<br />
press release.<br />
It will, no doubt, be some days before a full assessment<br />
of the damage suffered in South Australia will be clear<br />
and I have asked officers of my Department to keep in<br />
close contact with their counterparts in South Australia<br />
and Victoria so that decisions can be taken expeditiously<br />
to aid in the restoration and rebuilding of communities.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
( MI~ aiClm Fraser)<br />
The Ron. John Bannon, MRA,<br />
Premier of South Australia,<br />
Parliament House,<br />
ADELAIDE S. A. 5000 </p>
