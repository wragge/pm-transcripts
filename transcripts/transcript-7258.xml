Their tour will include New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory. The program of engagements to be undertaken by The Prince and Princest of Wales will focus mainly on the Bicentenary. They will join millions of Australians watching and participating in the Australia Day Celebrations in Sydney on 26 January. The Prince of Wales will take a salute from each of the Tall Ships taking part in the spectacular Parade of Sail in Sydney Harbour on the afternoon of 26 January. The visit by The Prince and Princess of Wales is the first of three Royal Visits planned for the bicentennial year. The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will visit in late April/ early May and The Duke and Duchess of York will visit later in the year. I know all Australians will give The Prince and Princess a warm and sincere welcome as they join with us in our bicentennial celebrations, encompassing a year long program of festive and commemorative events. Full details of their programs in each State are being released by the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. 003286</p>
