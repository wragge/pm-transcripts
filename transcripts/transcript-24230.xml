<p>The Government is pleased Professor Chubb has agreed to continue as Australia’s Chief Scientist until the end of the year to continue his important work in advising on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, which is a priority under the Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda.</p>
<p>Professor Chubb will also continue to work with the Government on developing and implementing science and research priorities through the Commonwealth Science Council.</p>
<p>We have put science at the centre of industry policy and we are building a culture of entrepreneurship that will help Australian industry and the science community work together.</p>
