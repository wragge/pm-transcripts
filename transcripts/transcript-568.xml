YOUNG LIBERAL MOVEMENT CONVENTION<br />
YoWC. A. HALLo SYDNEY<br />
27TH JULY 196<br />
Speech by the Prime Miiniste_ rtheRt. Hcno RG,_ Menez<br />
Sir I am delighted to be here and I am very<br />
sorry that I didn't hear the whole of that last debates<br />
The three speeches that I listened to I thought had a quality<br />
that has almost disappeared at Canberra, ( Laughter) 3revity<br />
and point. But I would like to take exception to the statement<br />
made, a most misleading statement by one of the speakers,<br />
that in Australian Rules football, there are three umpires.<br />
( Laughter). He said this in a rather derogatory fashion.<br />
I take leave to point out that there are five, ( Laughter) and<br />
they are very sharply to be distinguished from those who<br />
officiate in Rugby League in Sydney, ( Laughter) because some<br />
of them have been publicly known to be right. ( Laughter)<br />
Now, the Chairman has betrayed one of my guilty<br />
secrets, He has pointed out that a long time ago, I was a<br />
young Nationalist: indeed, a long time ago I was one of three<br />
fellows who sat down in the study of my own house in Melbourne<br />
and established the Young Nationalist Movement, And so that<br />
I will be on easy terms with all of you, I would like to tell<br />
you that on that occasion, we said to each other, as no doubt<br />
you have many times, " Too many old fellows in this outfit of<br />
ours0( Laughter) " Time we gave the old boys a bit of a stirring<br />
up, What we need is new blcod." We became very formidable.<br />
We stood at street corners; we had tomatoes and occasionally<br />
a little other garden truck ( Laughter) thrown at us, occasionally<br />
a friendly but fragile egg ( Laughter) and by the time I<br />
became a Minister for the first time and, indeed, the second<br />
time and the third time, it will surprise you to know, looking<br />
at my sunny locks, ( Laughter) that I was always referred to as<br />
" one of the more promising young men." So I say this to you<br />
in order to establish that though times have changed for me,<br />
I hope they haven't changed for you. Because, at that time,<br />
we believed and rightly, that the future of our side of<br />
politics depended upon youth and vigour, with a little age and<br />
experience throiwn in we were always prepared to concede<br />
that but, above all, youth and vigouro And this must always<br />
be the motto of a political party that hopes to have a future<br />
and not merely to dwell on its past0<br />
It isn't so long ago, from my point of view,<br />
back before the 1949 election, before the 1946 election, when<br />
I, myself, being Leader of the Opposition, had occasion to<br />
look over the field in Australia and to say " Are we putting<br />
ourselves into shape to win the election and to govern the<br />
country?" This was a serious question, but not a very easy<br />
one to answer at that time because, under the pressure of<br />
adversity, we split up into various groups and factions,<br />
There were about three different political parties, non-Labor,<br />
in New South Wales. I think there were about four in Victoria,<br />
and so it went around Australia until I think when I convened<br />
the original meeting to establish the Liberal Party, I had to<br />
send notices to at least thirteen different organisationso<br />
I know it well because it was all done in my offices as Leader<br />
of the Opposition and by 1944, we were establishing the united<br />
party; by 1945 we had it well under way, In 1946, we won<br />
a few seats, nou too many, we couldn't hope to win an election,<br />
but we won a few seats, and in 1949, we were swept into power<br />
at what was then almost a record level of majority. 3 e. 0 0 o0 / 2 </p>
<p>Now all that happened because we had something<br />
to believe in, not just something to oppose, but something<br />
to believe in. If we have fallen into any dangers in the<br />
last few years, it perhaps is because we have lost sight<br />
of the idea what is it we believe in and have perhaps<br />
concentrated unduly on dealing with our opponents and demonstrating<br />
how wrong they are,<br />
Now, Sir, nobody could be a greater believer than<br />
I am in the Young Liberal Movement, and for those reasons,<br />
because long after I am merely a dusty memory, there will<br />
be plenty of you in this hall tonight who will be occupying<br />
leading posts in the political life of Australia and carrying<br />
great responsibility in that political lifeo But you will<br />
do iG and do it in positions of power ani responsibility orly<br />
if you and nll the rest of us from tim-6o time sit down and<br />
say, " What is it we believe in?"<br />
Modern history is, as you all know, full of<br />
examples of great movements that disappeared because they<br />
had ceased to have any genuine reason for existence. I<br />
remember speaking about the British Commonwealth a penetrating<br />
man saying to me only six months ago, " You know, there is<br />
a lot of argument about the Commonwrealth but the thing I am<br />
always trying to discover is what does it stand for? what does<br />
it believe in." And this is a great problem. It is not<br />
enough just to accommodate the structure to new things or new<br />
events, the important thing is to have a faith to live by,<br />
And that goes for us, in this Party,<br />
Now, Sir, I don't want to make a sort of thoiogical<br />
speech to you, but I do want to say a few things about what I<br />
believe in and what, as I hope, you believe in. This is not<br />
a matter for some casual, contemporary observations, I want<br />
to talk to you about some of the great things, as it seems to<br />
me, that matter in our country and in which your mind and<br />
your heart and your spirit will be determining factors in the<br />
years to come, ' iJhat is the first objective, Sir, of national policy<br />
in Australia? Not just to be in office or to stay there, but<br />
to build something, to build a balanced nation, a strong nation,<br />
a progressive nation, a civilised nation, in which advances<br />
and advantages belong to all the people, Now you may say<br />
that's almost platitudinous, so platitudinous that half the<br />
people have forgotten ito All the people represent our<br />
constituency of thought and of action,, ve must work for all<br />
the people and build for all of the people and have our vision<br />
of a civilised Australia for the benefit of all the people.<br />
A good deal has been said in my time, politically,<br />
about class distinction. We still have a few hopelessly<br />
reactionary people, like socialists and communists, ( the most<br />
reactionary people in the country) who want to whip up something<br />
about class distinction, A Liberal regards this country as<br />
having only one valid class distinction, the distinction between<br />
the active and the idle If the world belongs to the workers,<br />
in the words of the Communist Manifesto and I believe it's<br />
true Ict it belong to the workers,<br />
Let us believe that it is the industrious people in<br />
a country who matter, that they are the contributors to a<br />
national life, and don't let us, as Liberals above all things,<br />
fall into those easy ideas that the modern conception of life<br />
allows you to be idle, to be dependent, to leave it to the<br />
0 a oo o / 2 </p>
<p>Government, and between a yawn and a yawn, cast a vote about<br />
something. This is a wonderful country; it's going to be<br />
more wonderful still, but it will achieve greater wonders<br />
on the hard work and efforts of its people, and not by a<br />
spirit of dependency, not on that kind of attitude towards<br />
governments and what governments ought to do that our<br />
opponents find so easy,<br />
Sir, it's quite true we must always remember it,<br />
that we have a strong and splenaid heritage in Australia,<br />
We can all look back, most of us at any rate, except those<br />
who have only jus-t newly arrived, Ln our forefathers in this<br />
country. We talk easily about the pioneers. We sometimes<br />
forget what remarkable things have been done. It WGoud be<br />
a marvellous thing for all of us if, by some retrospective<br />
photography, we could be taken back fif-y years. That's all,<br />
Fifty years, and look at how things were fifty years ago,<br />
and then look around us today, and there are those here<br />
tonight who in fifty years' time will. look around them and,<br />
remembering how things looked today, will marvel at the<br />
achievements of this country.<br />
We come of a great race of people. We have every<br />
reason to be proud of them but oiir pride in them will be<br />
worthless unless we are determined to be an even greater race<br />
of people ourselves, unless we are determined that the future<br />
that will be looked at, perhaps by another generation in<br />
Australia, is going to be as astonishing as the one we look<br />
at today. These thingsE Sir, don't call for a spirit of<br />
quiet acceptance of what a Government will do. These things<br />
call for a spirit of adventure, they call for a desire to<br />
contribute, a rising level of civic unselfishness, Again I<br />
say to you, don't take those things for granted. Civic<br />
unselfishness. We don't know too many people, do we, who<br />
would answer to that description We know a great number of<br />
people who want something, who want to have it, who want to<br />
be given it. There are not so many people in the country,<br />
outside this room, whose great ambition is to contribute to<br />
the nation. And yet, if Liberalism stands for anything, and<br />
young Liberalism above all, it's for a passion to contribute<br />
to the nation, to be free but to be contributors, to submit<br />
to the discipline of the mind instead of the ordinary, dull<br />
discipline of a regimented mass of people. These are wonderful<br />
things for us to have in our mindso<br />
If I turn away from that to what might be regarded<br />
as more concrete matters, could I just say to you, quite<br />
briefly, something about the objectives of national policy<br />
other than those I have already mentioned, because they are<br />
very important. They represent a constructive task, The<br />
first one of them is that this country must have more and more<br />
and more people year by year, and this means a very active<br />
policy of migration in Australia. It is very hard for me<br />
to realise that when we came back into office Senator<br />
Spoonor will remember with me at the end of 1949, the<br />
population of Australia was about 2-million people less than<br />
it is today, and that is one of the marvels of this period,<br />
that with this enormous increase in population, an increase<br />
of something like 33% or 34%; in that period of time, our<br />
living standards have risen and our growth has been so great.<br />
We must have that population. de cannot indefinitely suppose<br />
that we are going to be allowed to be the trustees of a halfempty<br />
continent, Migration, the determination to maintain<br />
migration, the rise in the population of Australia will continue<br />
to be one of the great challenges to our national future,<br />
0 0 0 0 0 L) 0 0 0 / 1ñ </p>
<p>But, Sir, not only must we build up the population,<br />
we must have a busy and employed population, and the maintenance<br />
of full employment of people and of full employment of material<br />
resources in Australia is not an easy thing to marry to an<br />
active migration programme, Don't forget that because every<br />
migrant who comes to Australia establishes, in the short run,<br />
a capital demand whether it is for a house or roadwork or<br />
school or church or some portion of a hospital, He establislhec<br />
capital demands, and his own labour will rot contribute<br />
correspondingly for some years to come, That's what people<br />
mean when they sa: that a larre migration programme is. in the<br />
short run, full of inflationary tendencies but, in the long<br />
run, the essence of national growth. Therefore we have to<br />
watch these two things together.<br />
In the third place and this appears in so. me quarters<br />
to be rather an unpopular idea, I gather we must restrain<br />
inflation and preserve the value of the currency, and the<br />
value of savings, Some of our opponents, from whatever side<br />
they may come, are a little bit i. nclined to say about us<br />
" Oh, these people arE. obsessed by the idea of stability,'<br />
This is only because they don't understand what stability is.<br />
They think that stability is stagnation It's nothing of<br />
the kind, We are not the apostles of stagnation, but we want<br />
stability, so that we may build a great structure on it.<br />
We are builders, not contemplaters of foundations, Builders.<br />
But if you are going to build a great national structure,<br />
then anybody can tell you that you must have some stability<br />
in the foundations, If you are going to have, coming into<br />
Australia from the other parts of the wcidr, investments<br />
capital which we so badly need for our national development,<br />
you are not going to have it if your economy is in a state of<br />
flux, if the value of your money is declining. We know this<br />
from long and painful experience, but give it stability and<br />
the results flowo<br />
And I want to remind you, all of you, that in spite<br />
of all the problems we have been going through, in spite of<br />
the unpopularity that is attracted by many of the measures<br />
we've taken, the fact is that for the last eighteen months,<br />
the consumer price index in Australia has been stable. For<br />
the last eighteen months, we have had no inflation of the<br />
currency because we have had no perceptible movement upward<br />
in the price level0 This, you would agree if you looked<br />
around at the experience of the rest of the world is a very<br />
remarkable thing, and one of its by-products has been, not<br />
stagnation but a record-breaking movement of investable<br />
capital into Australia from people outside who see in this<br />
country all the possibilities of development in the future,<br />
Sir it will be a pretty poor thing if we have less confidence<br />
in ustralia than foreigners have in Australiaø<br />
Then Sir, there is another aspect of this stability,<br />
falsely so-called stagnation. Just look back, if you<br />
wouldngt mind on the last few months, on the last twelve<br />
months just to see what it is we stand for in the objectives<br />
of policy, Have we been sitting down contemplating this<br />
glorious index figure and saying, " Ah, it's the same now as<br />
it was three months ago, This is fine," Have we just sat<br />
back and looked at our balances of payments overseas ar] d said<br />
how splendid they are, how much recovered they are from the<br />
dangers of two years ago? Not at allo o oo0O </p>
<p>It's over this very period when we have had<br />
stability of this kind, that we've been able to spend<br />
many millions on the Snowy Mountains Scheme under the<br />
Ministerial control of my colleague, Senator Spooner,<br />
millions on uniform gauge works, millions on the Mt.<br />
Isa railway to the coast to develop what will be the<br />
greatest copper mine in the world, full of export income;<br />
coal ports in New South Wales and Queensland, beef roads<br />
in Western Australia, in the Northern Territory, in the<br />
North of Queensland these things add up to almost fantastic<br />
sums of money, and we have been contributing our money for<br />
these purposes at the very time whei we have been maintaining<br />
stability in the currency and in the value of money, I<br />
mention those things becaase to my mind they are practically<br />
conclusive evidence of the falsity of thr claim that stability<br />
means stagnation and that the Liberal 2Paty has lost its<br />
imagination and its drive.<br />
There has been no Party in the history of Australia<br />
that has had such a picture in its mind of Australian<br />
development, There is no Party in the history of Australia<br />
that has so far done more to paint that picture, to bring<br />
it into existence, and with your good help, there will be<br />
no Party over the next ten years tLat will do more to extend<br />
the boundaries of development, so that we may carry a vast<br />
population, so that w3 may improve our security, so that we<br />
may improve the living standards of our people and do it all<br />
on a basis of growing civilisation, ( Applause)<br />
And then, Sir, I would just like to mention a<br />
couple of matters. When I was a boy, in the bush, and many<br />
people think that intellectually I am still there, ( Laughter)<br />
the first political arguments that I ever listened to ( because<br />
I was born in a rather talkative and political family) were<br />
about protection and free tradeo And as it was in the<br />
country, the fashionable thing at that time was to think of<br />
all the manufacturers as evil creatures, battening on the<br />
man on the land you know and because my old man was a<br />
protectionist, he was frequently in strife with the neighbours.<br />
All that is goneo That's as dead as the dodo. The fact is<br />
that it would be a rare person today in either city or country<br />
who didn't realise that the greatest example of interdependency<br />
that we have in Australia is manufacturing on the one<br />
hand and primary production on the other. And I think all<br />
the more advanced leaders and thinkers on both sides have<br />
long since realised that, But today we need to carry our<br />
examination of it a little further.<br />
I said something about population. We must have<br />
more and more people coming here, I said that that presented<br />
a problem, not only to the stability of the currency but a<br />
problem of full employment of men and of materials But if<br />
we are going to have a large migration, we are not going to<br />
have it moving into the rural industries to any perceptible<br />
extento All the leaders of rural industries concede this<br />
point when we have discussions with themn More and more<br />
mechanisation is coming on the land more and more advanced<br />
methods of applied science and greater productivity, with no<br />
necessary increase in the number of people employed.<br />
Consequently, if you are going to bring people into Australia<br />
and have them usefully employed, you must look to the<br />
secondary industries and to the tertiary, service industries<br />
rather than to the primary, This, of course, lends great<br />
point to the necessity of having a growing manufacture in<br />
Australia, to balance our economy, to take up a great<br />
0 . o / 6 </p>
<p>increase in the population and to give us, more and more,<br />
as time goes on, two feet -to stand on,<br />
You know, before the time of many of you, there<br />
was a great depression back in 1929 and a few following<br />
years, and one of the things about -that depression that<br />
everybody ought to know about is this: that at that time,<br />
our manufacturing industries were comparatively small-,<br />
our export industries, as today, were comparatively great,<br />
But because we m~ a lir-it to manufacture in Australia,<br />
because we were, as we confronted the world, standing rather<br />
on one foot, the primary industr-y foot, when the depression<br />
began overseas and reached us, it reached us in the form<br />
of a tragic fall in the prices of wool and wheat and the<br />
commodities that we exported. Fantasti-. NoboQ: T ' U. day,<br />
thinking about tcdt. yls prices, would believe what they were<br />
back in 1929 and 1930, with wool a few pence a pound and<br />
wheat I remember getting down to eighteenpence a bushel,<br />
about 2d. a bushel less than the average freigh-t that had<br />
' to be paid on it to -take it from a country station.<br />
These were tiagic things. That can't happen<br />
to us today because we have manufacturing industries in<br />
Australia which enable us to stand with both feet, and if<br />
we lose a little one way, we hope to gain a little the<br />
othor, We wontt always do it, but at any rate, we have<br />
sought to establish some forma of economic balance, and it<br />
is one of the great tasks of our Government and of our<br />
Party to maintain it, That's the whole case, or rather,<br />
it's the immediate case for maintaining manufacturing in<br />
Australia, not recklessly but soundly, persistently, with<br />
the knowledge that upon the steady growth of manufacturing<br />
industry, the steady growth of Australian population will<br />
primarily depend, I have mentioned to you population, stability,<br />
employment of resources, employment of people, manufacturing<br />
and its relation to immigration, but there is another thing.<br />
We, in Australia, still continue to depend, in terms of<br />
external trade, primarily upon the products of the land<br />
and we will continue so to depOend for many years to come,<br />
Wool, wheat, dairy products meat run through the whole<br />
list -these are the very s~ aplie o. u epr icm and<br />
as another proof of the interdependency of primary and<br />
secondary industry in Australia, the bulk of the export, the<br />
bulk of the money we lay out fLor imports into Australia<br />
and we have imports because we have exports the bulk of<br />
it is laid out on imports for the manufacturing industries,<br />
either in plant or raw materials or whatever it may be.<br />
If you were to abolish the wool industry and the wheat<br />
industry and the others tomorrow, manufacturing in Australia<br />
would come to an end,,<br />
This is a tremendous interdependency, If we are<br />
going to have it then we must never lose sight of the<br />
position of our primary industries. Don't you allow this<br />
to become the perquisite of anybody else. This is our<br />
business. The Liberal Party has always stood for a lively<br />
interest in this matter and I hope th-at it always will,<br />
The primary industries can, unless we are careful,<br />
be costed out of their markets, I have had distinguished<br />
representatives of the wool industry come into my office in<br />
the last thiree-wee . ks and point out to me xv'at they estimated<br />
0 6 v e a o Co o a/ </p>
<p>to be the cost of production of wool and what was the ruling<br />
price and pointing out that the margir., the difference was not<br />
all that great. The same goes for wheat, the same goes,<br />
with modifications, seasonal and otherwise9 in the case of<br />
the great meat industry. And so on. Primary industries<br />
are not operating on large margins in the markets of the<br />
world, and unlike local industries, they have to take what<br />
the world will give them. It is no use the producer of<br />
one of these commodities saying to an overseas buyer " That's<br />
not enough", because he either sells it or he doesn'to<br />
The world controls our export prices and the<br />
great hope of the primary industry consists of a positive<br />
aspect and a negative aspect, Positively, we must oenourage<br />
the productivity of those on the land by bringinc to their<br />
as3istance all the modern improvements of research and applied<br />
science and improved cransport and the like that we can<br />
possibly provideø We do a let of research work in Australia,<br />
splendid research work. The name of the C. SoI. R. O. is<br />
famous in scientific circles all round the world. I am not<br />
yet satisfied that the research work of its scientists<br />
becomes sufficiently or quickly enough known to the man on<br />
the farm I know that it isn't. The fact is thac we have<br />
gaps here. We hav3 little distinctions between Commonwealth<br />
authority and State authority. We have a problem here to<br />
which we are directing our attention. Not as somebody who<br />
wanus to be complacent but as people who are grossly dissatisfied,<br />
we must do more on this level so that we may, without<br />
increasing the population of the farm, increase its productivity<br />
and by increasing its productivity reduce its unit<br />
cost and by doing that, preserving its position in the world<br />
market. These are the very conditions of advancement, and<br />
that means that positively we must encourage productivity and<br />
the reduction of costs for the man on the land.<br />
Negatively, we become properly concerned, as I am<br />
myself about manufacture and its growth and its protection,<br />
We must always remember that secondary industry must make<br />
itself more efficient year by year so that, in the long run,<br />
it doesn't throw too heavy a burden upon the farmer and<br />
grazier in Australia, That's the negative aspect. The<br />
other is the positive aspect, We must keep down costs not<br />
by some simple rule of thumb People argue about these<br />
things as if they had everything to do with wages. They<br />
have something to do with wages no doubt, but more than<br />
anything else they have to do with our efficiency with<br />
our capacity to paddle our own canoe, to get on with the<br />
job. We need today in industry, manufacturing and<br />
primary, pioneers, don't we? And we need the pioneering<br />
spirit people who want to do it better and better and<br />
better and thereby reduce the burden that their own industry<br />
might otherwise cast on the community,<br />
Now, the last thing I want to say to you is thiso<br />
There will be a lot of people who will want to say to you,<br />
" Oh, you know, the Government's all right We have to<br />
support its" ( Because some people still o) ( Laughter)<br />
" We have to support it, but you know, they do an awful lot<br />
in the public sector" that's the phrase the economists<br />
invented " not enough in the private sector," Now, Sir,<br />
if we stand for anything, it's private enterprise, in this<br />
Party top to bottom, young and old, But do we violate the<br />
oo<br />
L </p>
<p>8.<br />
principle of private enterprise when we assist a State<br />
Government to carry out public works without which private<br />
enterprise could not carry on? Let's be sensible about this.<br />
How can you develop a vast manufacturing community in<br />
Australia unless you have schools, and schools are in the<br />
public sector of expenditure, unless you have roads9 unless<br />
you have water supplies, unless you have transport 6 nll<br />
kinds. If you were to look over the average list of public<br />
works that the State Governments bring to us each time at<br />
the Loan Counil you would be hard put to it tc find one<br />
that wasn't d-rectly coming to the aid of the develorment<br />
of this country by private enterprise. You would be hard<br />
put to it to find anybody in a great private enterprise<br />
who didn't acknowledgthat without these provisions, he<br />
coaldn't possibly dpvelop hi. s factory or his business.<br />
Here's a comeback to my old and battered friend<br />
the Senator you see. He's been getting money out of us<br />
for the Snowy Mountains, sometimes honestly ( Laughter) but<br />
alwa-rs successfully, for years and years and yea" H01<br />
dig up the most marvellous hydro-electric scheme with great<br />
irrigation storages and therefore enormous potential for<br />
the increase of productivity in the irrigated areas of the<br />
Murrumbidgee and * Ghe Murray. It's all being spent on the<br />
public account, it's all regarded as activity in the public<br />
sector it's all being performed by private contiact, and<br />
every tittle of the advantage that comes from it in power<br />
or in water, as the case may be is something which directly<br />
or indirectly will assist private enterprise in Australia<br />
to do its job and to get on with the development of the<br />
country, I can sum up my own unsophisticated view very<br />
simply. I don't believe that governments provide enterprise.<br />
I think governments may provide the condition in which<br />
enterprise is encouraged, but if you want enterprise, if<br />
you want vision, you have to go to the individual human<br />
being, It is human beings right through the community who<br />
do things, who think out things, who get on with them. A<br />
few of the human beings are elected to Parliement. But to<br />
compare the mechanism of government, as if it were some<br />
sentient creature with the genius of the human being is<br />
absurd. We stand for the human being, we believe that it<br />
is on his basis, on her basis, that this country is going<br />
to have in the next ten years a degree of expansion unknown,<br />
even in the last decade,<br />
So we look forward, and I particularly tonighL,<br />
looking at you, look forward, because I don't expect to<br />
be around in politics J. n ten years' time and there are a lot<br />
of people who would greet that statement with immense<br />
enthusiasm ( Laughter), but you will be around, and I warn<br />
you that unless you carry thi3 torch on as I believe you<br />
will, I shall turn in my grave and reprove you if you can<br />
hear me. ( Prolonged applause)<br />
Thank you so much, You have convinced meo I think<br />
I'll stay for another couple of years, </p>
