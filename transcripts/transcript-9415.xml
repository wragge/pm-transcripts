TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP AND<br />
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE, HIS EXCELLENCY,<br />
EDUARDO FREI RUIZ-TAGLE<br />
KIRRIBILU HOUSE, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<br />
SATURDAY 12 NOVEMBER, 1994<br />
PM: Well, I might just begin by saying how delighted I am to have the President<br />
in Australia and delighted that we've had a chance to have a discussion<br />
about our bilateral relationship and about the meeting we'll be attending at<br />
APEC. The President has very kindly given me an introduction into the<br />
economics, politics and societal issues in Chile and they are, in some<br />
respects particularly with the development objectives of his country<br />
very similar to Australia. And, I was very glad to have had that point of view<br />
put. The President said to me that he would like to see a stronger bilateral<br />
relationship and I agreed with him that Australia could well do with a beach<br />
head in South America, and Chile rather obviously picks itself on the Pacific<br />
coast. And, we agreed that we should expand that bilateral relationship<br />
and, in Chile's case, use Australia also, as an entree to the Asia-Pacific.<br />
The President impressed upon me the value he sees in developing the<br />
bilateral relationship and getting the political relationship right. And, I<br />
certainly concur in that view. I think, certainly in this part of the world, a<br />
number of good bilateral relationships makes up a larger multilateral<br />
structure and APEC, which we're both going to this weekend, is the end<br />
product of those many bilateral relationships. So, I am delighted to have<br />
met the President, I am delighted that he has given us the honour of coming<br />
to Australia on the way to Indonesia and I will be delighted to be working<br />
with him over these next two or three days, on APEC and further<br />
strengthening our bilateral relationship.<br />
P: For us it was a great pleasure that we were invited to come to Australia so<br />
that we may discuss these matters and discuss areas of common concern.<br />
For us, Chile is a country that for the last few years has looked for<br />
development that included the concepts of justice and equality and, for us,<br />
our presence in APEC is very important, since a great proportion of our<br />
exports seventy five percent of our exports go to the Asia-Pacific </p>
<p>region. And forty percent of our imports also come from the Asia-Pacific<br />
region so this concept of APEC is particularly important to us.<br />
I am very glad we have discussed many of the important themes that will<br />
take place within APEC and we will have other opportunities to discuss<br />
these further. I think it is important that we have a consolidation of our<br />
bilateral communication, that should be based on a political background and<br />
further the development of these relationships between our two countries. I<br />
have mentioned to the Prime Minister that we have a number of<br />
businessmen and academics, a great number who are with us, and we will<br />
actually meet with Australian businessmen later this afternoon. I think that<br />
these sorts of exchanges are very important so that we can have a firm<br />
basis for further bilateral discussions between the two countries, with regard<br />
to investment, particularly.<br />
PM: I think we will take some questions if you would like.<br />
J: I would like to know what is Australia's position, at the moment, with regard<br />
to Chile's entrance to APEC, given that last year you opposed it?<br />
PM: Yes, we did oppose it, I said to the President, not because of any<br />
judgement about Chile, but, rather, about the manageability of APEC. If<br />
APEC grows too greatly before it gets down to undertake its substantial<br />
work it may have its capacity to undertake that work, diminished. But, we<br />
took the view that we would not stand out against Chile's membership, and<br />
we didn't. And, as a consequence, Chile is in APEC and we are delighted<br />
with that and we will work with Chile and, particularly, with the President, to<br />
see that we can do as much as possible together.<br />
J: Do you think that you could do something to improve the relationship<br />
between the two countries, particularly with regards to transport, given that<br />
there are some disadvantages to the current situation with the fluidity of<br />
exchanges between the two countries?<br />
PM: Well, the President and I discussed this. And, I think we agreed that one of<br />
the first things that we have to get right if we want to develop this<br />
relationship further and we do is to get the transportation right. And, I<br />
think that means that we ought to, at the earliest opportunity, develop the<br />
appropriate protocols so that we can establish an air link between Australia<br />
and Chile. So, I think this will be one of the priorities in our relationship.<br />
J: ( inaudible question re investment)<br />
P: The first thing we said was that we have to create the conditions and the<br />
opportunities for these sort of investments to be able to occur. There are </p>
<p>certain areas that the investments could take place in, and we have<br />
specified these. At the moment the Australian investments are principally<br />
to do with mining in our country but we believe there is potential there for<br />
investment within the sector of telecommunications, the infrastructure, and<br />
including the possibility of improving the exchange of advanced technology,<br />
also.<br />
J: ( inaudible question re APEC bettering 20-20 timetable)<br />
PMV: Well, this is one of the things I said yesterday. The Australian. press<br />
intemnalise every advance so quickly, without seeming to understand how<br />
difficult it is to put them in place. No communiques, such as these<br />
declarations, are ever foregone conclusions, particulaly going to such<br />
important matters as trade, across such a vast area of the world. So, I<br />
think the President and I would take -the view that it is first things first. That<br />
is, let's get a very clear declaration from Bogor and, when we have that,<br />
work and see how that can be implemented effectively.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what is your level of concern about Malaysia's possible<br />
dissension from the ( inaudible) timetable?<br />
PM: Well, as far as I know, just as we've had the reporting of reactions to<br />
President Soeharto's draft declaration, that there hasn't been any point of<br />
objection to it. And, why should I or anyone else go grasping at problems if<br />
they don't exist?<br />
I think we may, perhaps, leave it at that and let me conclude by saying by<br />
how absolutely delighted I am to see the President in Australia and how<br />
much I am looking forward to working with him over the course of these<br />
next few days, and in the future on our bilateral relationship.<br />
P: I would like to thank the Prime Minister, again, for the opportunity to discuss<br />
these matters with him and I would like to extend an invitation to him to visit<br />
Chile, when it suits him, so that we can further pursue our discussions and<br />
develop our relationship. We can also show him the reality of Chile and<br />
Latin America as we have seen the reality of Australia and we think that,<br />
also, we could be a gateway into Latin America and into developing a<br />
relationship between Australia and the Latin American continent.<br />
ends. </p>
