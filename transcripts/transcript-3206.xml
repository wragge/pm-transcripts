PRESS STATEMENT NO. 217<br />
8 April 1974<br />
TARIFF BOARD REPORT CIGARETTE PAPER<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
that the Government has accepted the recommendation of<br />
the Tariff Board in its report on Cigarette Paper.<br />
The report covered cigarette tissue paper for use<br />
in the manufacture of cigarettes, cigarette paper or<br />
cigarette papers, but excluded cigarette papers in leaves<br />
or booklets containing a number of loose leaves.<br />
Implementation of the recommendations will mean<br />
that the products covered by the report will be dutiable<br />
at 20%. At present the existing rate of duty for most<br />
cigarette paper is 37.5% General plus 7.5% primage. The<br />
Board also recommended that filigrained ( patterned or embossed)<br />
cigarette tissue be admitted duty free under by-law, and<br />
that cigarette paper from New Zealand be admitted duty free.<br />
