    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government has announced more than $82 million in additional funding to ensure 150,000 cancer patients can access safe and effective treatment each year.</p>
<p>The funding will be delivered under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) to assist patients with essential chemotherapy drug infusions.</p>
<p>Patients undergoing cancer treatment and their families will have certainty that timely access to safe and effective treatment will be available through their hospital or pharmacy.</p>
<p>The Government will also improve patient safety and care by removing unnecessary red tape for clinicians prescribing, processing and claiming for PBS medicines.</p>
<p>Clinicians in public and private hospitals will now be able to use a patientâ€™s medication chart to dispense and claim PBS medicines.</p>
<p>These changes will enable clinicians to spend more time with their patients and less time completing duplicate paperwork.</p>
<p>The new funding will be delivered from 1 January 2014 and will provide $152.66 per infusion to meet the higher costs of providing chemotherapy treatment.</p>
<p>The new funding and simpler administration will deliver real benefits for patients, their families and friends, hospitals, pharmacies and health professionals in the fight against cancer.</p>
