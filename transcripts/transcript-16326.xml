    <content><![CDATA[<p>The winner of a design competition for a national memorial honouring more than 30,000 Australian peacekeepers was announced today.</p>
<p>The memorial, to be built on Anzac Parade in Canberra, has been designed by Super Colossal, a Sydney based architect firm led by Marcus Trimble. </p>
<p>The Australian Peacekeeping Memorial will pay tribute to Australian peacekeepers and their roles in more than 50 peace operations around the world since 1947. Australia has contributed to peace operations in a number of countries including Namibia, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda, East Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Australian peacekeepers have built a reputation for outstanding service, in helping to restore order in dangerous environments and coming to the aid of victims of conflict.</p>
<p>We currently have nearly 1000 personnel engaged in nine peace operations overseas. Australians involved in peacekeeping operations come from the Australian Defence Force, federal and state police forces, and Australian Government agencies.</p>
<p>It is important we acknowledge the contribution our peacekeepers make to security in our region, and the world. This memorial will be a tangible reminder of what our peacekeepers have achieved, particularly those who have lost their lives while peacekeeping.</p>
<p>Now the winning design is selected, the memorial committee will focus on raising enough money to get the project underway.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has committed $200,000 but more is still needed.</p>
<p>The memorial will cost $3.5 million and we encourage Australians to give generously to ensure the efforts of our peacekeepers are honoured through this memorial.</p>
