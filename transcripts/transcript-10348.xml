TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
POST BUDGET ADDRESS<br />
ANA HOTEL SYDNEY<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Michael, to the Leader of the New South Wales opposition, Peter Collins, my<br />
other Federal and State parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
This of course is the second budget in nine months so the Friday post-budget Prime Ministerial<br />
briefing to this particular gathering comes fairly rapidly after the budget that was brought down in<br />
August of last year. And in trying to put what was delivered by the Treasurer last Tuesday night and in<br />
trying to put it into a proper context, I want to invite you to see what governments do in relation to<br />
budgets but also what governments do in relation to other policy decisions and policy announcements<br />
as being a continuum of a three year approach.<br />
It is now 14 months since my government was elected to office in March of 1996 elected with a very<br />
large majority in the House of Representatives but not securing control of the Upper House. We've<br />
faced a number of significant economic problems. 1 said when I become Prime Minister that the<br />
Australian economy that I inherited was something of a curate's egg. There were some good parts<br />
about it, we did have relatively low inflation, and there have been a number of changes which the<br />
Coalition in opposition have very strongly supported implemented by the former government.<br />
But there are number of areas where things were nowhere near as positive and our policy priorities<br />
were directed towards them. The first of those was of course about major changes to Australia's<br />
industrial relations system. Many of you will know that over the last decade, and the varying positions<br />
that I've held in Australian politics and I sometimes think that's just about every one other the last ten<br />
years, different positions I have regarded reform of the industrial relations system and deregulation<br />
of the labour market as being far and away the most important cultural change that needs to be<br />
undertaken by the Australian economy.<br />
The Workplace Relations Bill that finally passed through the Senate was, I have said in the past, about<br />
per cent of what we wanted. It wasn't everything of what we wanted but it went a great deal<br />
further than many of the rather immediate critics at the time said that it did, and the extent of the<br />
changes in that Workplace Relations Act are only now starting to become apparent. And I quite<br />
deliberately commenced my remarks about the budget at this luncheon in drawing your attention to<br />
the significance of the decision that was handed down by the full bench of the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission yesterday. And that particular decision, has in the words of one veteran industrial<br />
relations commentator, put the final nail in the coffin of the award system in Australia. And what that<br />
particular decision has underlined is the supremacy of enterprise bargaining under the industrial<br />
relations system ushered in by the Workplace Relations Act.<br />
What the full bench did yesterday was to reject an agreement that had been entered into between the<br />
major transport employers and the unions in the transport industry an agreement which if approved<br />
would have spread with adverse affects in the Government's view all through the many small<br />
businesses in the transport industry. But the real significance of that decision was the declaration by<br />
the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission comprised I might add of a group of people who<br />
I f606/ 30/ 97 17: 32: 43<br />

I of 6 </p>
<p>16 ay 997http:// w~ vw. nla. gov. au/ pitc/ pressreI/ budgt. litii<br />
have had a life long commitment to the centralised industrial relations system with the<br />
acknowledgment by the full bench that the design features of the Workplace Relations Act meant that<br />
the Industrial Relations Commission had to give supremacy to enterprise bargaining and had to regard<br />
the award system in the future as being very much in the nature of a safety net. Now that is a very<br />
significant decision and it proclaims, in my view, in a very practical way and as the implications of it<br />
spread through thle business community, it will be seen by the business community as signalling the<br />
fact that the Workplace IRelations Act, although not going as far as some would like, although only<br />
going perhaps 80 per cent of the distance that we would have liked when the legislation was first put<br />
into the Senate, it has brought about some fundamental changes to the way in which industrial<br />
relations is conducted in this country.<br />
And right at the moment there is of course another industrial relations issue looming at a political<br />
level. And that concerns the decision I announced four weeks ago when I made a statement on<br />
initiatives to assist small business that we would introduce a regulation to exempt from the operation<br />
of any unfair dismissal laws, any unfair dismissal prohibitions of any kind, small businesses employing<br />
fewer than 15 people. The reason we had a limit of 15 was simply based upon the limitations<br />
contained in the legislation that we were able to get through the Senate. And that particular measure<br />
would have said that any small business employing fewer than 15 people was not liable to any unfair<br />
dismissal constraints in relation to employees that had been in their employee for fewer than 12<br />
months. And we regarded it as entirely as eminently reasonable, entirely fair that an employer in that<br />
situation be able to give somebody a period of 12 months' probation and if any time during that<br />
12-month period the employee did not prove to be satisfactory then it would be reasonable to let the<br />
employee go without facing the threat of any kind of unfair dismissal suit. And the threat of some suits<br />
in relation to small business are very real. Anyway, we brought the regulation down and the Labor<br />
Party and the Australian Democrats have announced that they will disallow the regulation in thle<br />
Senate. And if they secure the support of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, well, that regulation<br />
won't become law. And I made it clear a few days ago and I repeat it again today, that if the Senate<br />
does in fact disallow that particular regulation the Government will immediately incorporate it in the<br />
form of a bill, pass it through the House of Representatives and present it to the Senate and we'll<br />
persist with the presentation of that piece of legislation because we think it is a very valuable element<br />
in the armoury of policy measures that we have to assist the small business community.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen, we identified amongst the negative aspects of the Australian economy that<br />
we inherited in March of 1996, we identified industrial relations reform as being very high on the list<br />
of priorities. But the next area that we identified as being of a major challenge was, of course, the<br />
underlying budget deficit. We inherited an underlying budget deficit of about $ 10.5 billion. Within a<br />
few weeks of taking office the Treasurer and the Minister of Finance declared that our objective was<br />
to achieve a structural surplus during our first term in government. We have, in fact, in the budget<br />
documnentation that has been presented, we have in fact, if it is realised, we have in fact achieved that<br />
was then regarded as an extraordinarily ambitious aim. Because in 1998/ 99 it is estimated, according<br />
to the budget documentation, that we will have turned that structural deficit of $ 10.5 billion into a<br />
structural surplus of $ 1 .6 billion.<br />
And I would have to say to this audience as I would say to any business audience anywhere in<br />
Australia, that over the past few years there has been no theme that has been more regularly repeated<br />
at business gatherings and more regularly put to my party's vote in opposition and in government than<br />
the desirability of this country no longer being a debtor nation, but this country tackling the size of its<br />
budget deficit.<br />
And under the budget announced by the Treasurer on Tuesday night we will, by the year 2000, have<br />
reduced to about 10% of GDP the entire national debt of the Australian nation from a figure of 19.5%<br />
of GDP in 1995. The cycle of debt and deficit is something that I believe had to be tackled as a first<br />
priority by the new government. There was no way that we could do that without understating, as we<br />

<p>1l~ 697 i iila gov. ati/ piic/ lprcssrcl/ bidget. litiinI<br />
did in our first budget, very substantial reductions in government spending. And the budget savings of<br />
between $ 7 billion and $ 8 billion that were announced by the Treasurer in August of last year, of<br />
course, have carried over into this year's budget. And we deliberately embarked upon a team<br />
programme of expenditure reduction. And like any intelligent government we quite deliberately<br />
undertook many measures in the expenditure area involving difficulty for sections of the community in<br />
our first year in government. Any government that has a social conscience as well as an obligation to<br />
govern in the economic interests of the nation must strike a balance between the desire to have a<br />
healthy bottom line and also the social and cultural obligations that are incumbent upon any<br />
government. And it is necessary to strike a balance.<br />
We have imposed, over the last two years, a number of very significant changes in areas such as higher<br />
education, where the imposition of higher HECs charges, I think, restores an appropriate balance<br />
between public subsidy of university education and private provision and private contribution. I have<br />
never believed myself in the notion that a free tertiary education is the birth right of every Australian. I<br />
think the option of free education at a primary and secondary level is something that is very ingrained<br />
in the Australian community. But as far as tertiary education is concerned, I always regarded it as an<br />
exercise in unsustainability and unaffordability to tether the notion that this country could forever<br />
afford to provide free university places for all Australians who could win admission to this nation's<br />
universities. And that is why in the late 1 980s when the former government introduced the H-ECs fee<br />
thle Liberal and National Parties in opposition did not oppose it. In fact, it lured, albeit in a different<br />
form, policy proposals that we had put forward in opposition. And the 1-ECs changes that were<br />
brought in last year have significantly increased the contribution of students towards their education.<br />
But we think that's fair. We think it strikes the right balance. Likewise with changes that we've<br />
introduced in relation to the admission of people into nursing homes. I support the principle that if<br />
people can afford to make a contribution towards their care in a nursing home in the later years of<br />
their life then it is reasonable for that charge to be imposed and that contribution to be sought from the<br />
person. I don't support the view that the untouched inheritance rights of the family of an older person<br />
take priority over the interests of the general body of taxpayers in relation to people in that situation.<br />
I learnt from those two examples, ladies and gentlemen, to underscore the point that in trying to strike<br />
a balance between our economic obligations and our social obligations it is always necessary to seek<br />
an element of compromise. There will always be some who will say-you should have gone much<br />
further. There will always be people who argue that no matter how much is cut out of a budget you<br />
could always cut a lot further. And the answer to that is quite obviously you can. But, of course, you<br />
have to ask yourself whether the cost in terms of the impact of reductions in certain expenditure areas<br />
on individuals is sustainable given the kind of society and the kind of nation we are.<br />
I always believe that there is a truly Australian way of approaching issues of equity between the<br />
economnic imperatives of a government's obligations and the social obligations of that government.<br />
We do not have as big a welfare state, nor as complicated, nor as expensive a welfare state as many of<br />
the nations of western Europe, and thankfully so. Equally, I don't think the Australian ethos would<br />
allow some of the gaps in the welfare system of the United States to be tolerated in this country. And<br />
as in so many things, Australia, I think, has struck a very clever and I think intelligent and certainly the<br />
right balance.<br />
I believe that the budget is sound in all of the important economic elements. It will reinforce the<br />
pressure for lower interest rates within the Australian economy. I don't argue that there is<br />
day-follows-night connection, if I can put it that way, between reductions in the budget deficit and the<br />
level of interest rates. Obviously the rate of inflation, the rate of growth ill wages and other<br />
considerations such as the current account deficit, have an impact on the level of official interest rates.<br />
But quite clearly if a government is working its way towards a substantial surplus and this year we will<br />

repay $ 5.3 billion of debt, of national debt, the Government will not be a borrower for a dollar in the<br />
money markets of Australia in the coming financial year, and that is a very significant achievement.<br />
Obviously if we are doing that then that has a very healthy impact on the climate in which the<br />
monetary authorities set interest rates.<br />
I believe the budget will reinforce the low inflation that exists in Australia at the present time. And in<br />
the long term low inflation, of course, helps to turn around the culture in Australia as far as household<br />
savings is concerned.<br />
In the area of savings we have quite deliberately introduced an across-the-board non-means tested<br />
tax incentive to encourage all kinds of savings within the Australian community. We are utterly<br />
unapologetic about the fact that it is not limited to particular savings. And in this context I want to say<br />
very, very directly and very firmly that this measure is quite purposely designed to attract the<br />
investment and the interest of those in the community who are in a position to save and therefore take<br />
advantage of the measure. This argument that because one particular measure is of greater advantage<br />
to one section of the community than another and therefore for that reason alone is flawed is the<br />
equivalent of arguing that because not every person in the community has children that it is a flawed<br />
economic policy to provide financial assistance to those people who do. The purpose of the savings<br />
measure is to encourage and to reward those people who might be discouraged to save or those<br />
people who have in fact saved. And that is why it is non-means tested. That is why it is not only<br />
available for bank deposits but it is also available for personal superannuation contribution. It is also<br />
available for rental returns on investments. It is also available in relation to certain returns from<br />
business investments. In other words it is an across the board incentive and it will be of particular<br />
benefit to self-funded retirees in our community who would have been completely shut out, utterly<br />
shut out of the matching contributions system of the former government which the savings initiative<br />
has replaced. It will over time make a contribution to turning around the culture against savings in this<br />
country. It will take time, not everybody simply because they are not in a position to save will be able<br />
to benefit, but that won't alter the overall value of the measure and I believe that one of the things that<br />
governments must do in implementing economic decisions and economic measures is not only to have<br />
regard to their real value to the community and this measure has real value, but also must have regard<br />
to the symbolic value of particular measures. And in the 22 or 23 years that I've been in politics, one<br />
of the most frequent entreaties I've had as I've gone around talking at business luncheons, being<br />
interviewed on talkback radio, addressing scores of meetings all around Australia, I've frequently been<br />
asked why is it that we tax savings twice. Why is it that we don't have some kind of tax break on<br />
savings. And I'm very proud to say that the second budget of the Howard government is the Budget<br />
that for the first time in the history of this country introduced a general taxation incentive for savings<br />
in this country and I believe it is a very, very valuable measure.<br />
Mr Speaker... ( I'm still in Parliament I'm sorry!)... the habit dies very hard... you know, you are sort of<br />
on automatic pilot to the Speaker. But ladies and gentlemen, quite understandably people have raised<br />
questions about the impact of the budget and the impact of other economic decisions taken by the<br />
government on the level of unemployment in Australia.<br />
Unemployment was around 8.5% when we came to office and youth unemployment was in the order<br />
of 28-30%. It had gone to a level of 11.2% in the early 1990s and it had come down somewhat, but<br />
slowly, from that level, and it does remain, and I freely acknowledge it as a major social and economnic<br />
challenge for my government. No government can intelligently pretend and no opposition can<br />
intelligently pretend that given the character of our economy, given the Australian commitment to a<br />
decent minimumn wage which is very much part of the culture of this country, that reducing the level of<br />
unemployment is going to be an easy task.<br />
I have quite deliberately avoided committing myself to a particular target. And that was a view I might<br />
say that was expressed frequently by some of my political opponents now when they were members of<br />
06/ 30/ 97 17: 32: 48<br />
16 May 997 </p>
<p>16M y1 97ttp: HAvgvowv vanui/ ap iic/ pressrel/ btdget. litiii<br />
the former government. There are two barriers in Australia to lower unemployment. The first of those<br />
barriers is that our economy is not growing fast enough to generate enough jobs to significantly<br />
reduce the level of unemployment and the way in which you get an economy growing faster is to<br />
remove some of the constraints on growth. And those constraints are interest rates that are too high,<br />
inflation that is too high, budget deficits that are too high and levels of national debt which are too<br />
high, and other constraints of course really account for what is in effect the second reason why<br />
unemployment is too high and that is that there are structural rigidities in the Australian economy<br />
which are working against the employment of people. And the bulk of those structural rigidities are to<br />
be found in the area of industrial relations.<br />
It is my view that, as the value of our industrial relations reforms and perhaps some other changes<br />
which I mentioned earlier in my speech in the area of unfair dismissals, as those changes work their<br />
way through the Australian economy then some of the rigidities that now exist in relation to reducing<br />
unemployment will begin to disappear. I can't pretend to you anymore than I could pretend to any<br />
other audience around this country that that is going to happen quickly, but if can run our economy at<br />
four percent or more and that is certainly in current circumstances an aim that if we can build on the<br />
success of this year's budget is an achievable goal, an achievable aim, then I believe that we will begin<br />
to make some inroads into the unacceptably high levels of unemployment.<br />
1 noted yesterday the remarks made by the governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane to the<br />
effect that growth alone would not reduce our unacceptably high level of unemployment. I agree with<br />
that. You need to take action on other fronts. That is why we made changes to the Workplace<br />
Relations Act and it is why we are proposing further changes in that area. But it is also why we have<br />
introduced a work for the dole scheme. It is also why David Kemp has brought in a completely<br />
different training scheme. It is also why we have under study a number of other proposals in<br />
connection with the introduction of a common youth allowance, and one of those proposals is to<br />
remove the disincentives that currently exist as between young people opting to undertake a course of<br />
study and a course of training or alternatively going on the dole.<br />
But 1 wanted to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the challenge of reducing unemployment<br />
remains a huge one, not only for my government and also for the business community but for the<br />
entire Australian community. It is unrealistic to pretend for a moment that it is something that can be<br />
achieved quickly. But I want to reassure you that it remains very much in my mind, it remains a strong<br />
personal commitment of mine, and a strong belief on my part that the Australian people require of us a<br />
continued commitment in moving towards that goal.<br />
Finally, can I say to you ladies and gentlemen that as I look back over the last 14 months like any<br />
other seasoned politician, and like any other politician who has seen the highs, the lows, the middles,<br />
the ups and downs and the ins and outs of the vicissitudes of Australian politics, I am satisfied that the<br />
principal goals that we set ourselves in March of 1996 are well on the road to being realised. We have<br />
before us at the present time one or two extremely complicated and atypical issues. I will, as you<br />
know, journey into Longreach later this afternoon with my friend and my very decent and magnificent<br />
Coalition colleague Tim Fischer, and can I say it is one of the privileges of public life to share a<br />
platform with Tim Fischer who's one of the most decent, dedicated people in the Coalition firmament<br />
anywhere around Australia.<br />
And I'll be going there to explain to the pastoralists not only of Queensland, but also of Australia that<br />
the plan that the Government after a lot of painstaking work has developed, is a very fair and balanced<br />
response to a very difficult problem bequeathed to this government by what I should best describe as a<br />
somewhat impractical decision handed down by the High Court of Australia. And that plan will deliver<br />
all of the certainty and all of the security which farmers and graziers of Australia are entitled.<br />
Notwithstanding some of the wild allegations to the contrary, the plan does not involve some kind of<br />
mass taxpayer funded handout of freehold titles. One of the major elements of the plan is to ensure 06/ 30/ 97 17: 32: 49<br />
16 May 997 </p>
<p>16 Ma1 997httpia:// , g. vowvi. va u/ pnic/ pressrel/ budget. htini<br />
that if there is any upgrading of title after the proper processes of compulsory acquisition by the State<br />
governments of Australia and that should occur on the basis of the payment by the recipient of the<br />
updated title of a sum appropriate to the improved charactered of that title.<br />
What this plan seeks to do ladies and gentlemen is to strike a balance. It respects native title but it<br />
does recognise that as a result of the Wik decision the pendulum of native title matters has swung too<br />
far in the direction of the Aboriginal community. And the Government's goal and the purpose of the<br />
plan is not to push the pendulum back to where it was before the Mabo decision, but rather<br />
to push thle pendulum back into the centre and that is where I believe the great bulk of the Australian<br />
community want that pendulum to be. Most Australians would dread the thought that the farmers and<br />
graziers of this country were thrown into a sense of insecurity and a sense of instability so far as the<br />
title to their properties were concerned and their capacity to manage those properties was concerned.<br />
Equally, in 1997 1 believe there is a strong constituency in this country for acceptance and recognition<br />
of the concept of native title. There is a desire to have a proper basis of cooperation between all<br />
sections of the Australian community. Those who believe that blanket extinguishment of native title<br />
and pastoral leases is an answer to this very difficult problem ignore the dubious constitutionality of<br />
such an approach. They underestimate the potential compensation bill that would face the Australian<br />
nation. And I think they also disregard the negative symbolism of a sweeping act of general<br />
extinguishment of title that would affect only one section of the Australian community. What I believe<br />
my plan will do is to give to the farmers of Australia the security that I promised them and they are<br />
entitled to have. It will reassure them in their capacity to manage their properties without interference<br />
and without meaning to get the permission of native title claimants and at the same time it will do so in<br />
a character and in a fashion that does not offend the desire of most Australians to achieve a fair and<br />
just solution to this extraordinarily difficult problem.<br />
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, can I thank the New South Wales Division and my own Bennelong<br />
Conference for organising this luncheon. Can I thank the business community of Sydney for the<br />
support that it has continued to give to the Liberal Party and to my Government over the last 14<br />
months. I have regarded communication with the business community as being a very important part<br />
of providing good government. I hope that we have kept faith with that. I hope that that process of<br />
communication will continue not only to the benefit of the Government but to the benefit of the entire<br />
community of Australia.<br />
Thank you.<br />
