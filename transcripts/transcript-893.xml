FOR PRESS LETTER FROM MRS. J. F. KENNEDY<br />
The Prime Minister has received the following<br />
letter from the widow of President Kennedy: January 31, 1964+<br />
" Dear Sir Robert-,<br />
My children and I arc extremely grateful<br />
for the kindness and understanding which you and<br />
the people of Australia displayed in the messages<br />
and other manifestations of sympathy which we<br />
received after the death of my husband. The<br />
generosity and openhearted sincerity of Australians,<br />
acting individually and in groups, helped to provide<br />
us with strength when strength was most needed and<br />
remains a memory of friendship unselfishly offered<br />
at a time of tragedy.<br />
The people of your country showed they<br />
shared with Americans everywhere a feeling of<br />
common loss. I know that this realization has also<br />
affected large numbers of Americans who have become<br />
aware of this selfless spirit of Australian<br />
participation in their time of sorrow.<br />
Mr, Prime Minister, I thank you and your<br />
fellow citizens for your comforting expressions of<br />
sympathy and for showing us so convincingly how<br />
close in spirit our people are. Nothing could have<br />
pleased my husband more. Sincerely, JACQUELINE KENNEDY.<br />
CANBERRA, 18th February, 1964+ </p>
