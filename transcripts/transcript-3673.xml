AUSTRALIAN AID TO REFUGEES IN INDO-CHINA<br />
The Prime Minister, and Actirkg Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, Mr Whitlam, announced today a further contribution<br />
of $ A 1 million for relief work among refugees in Indo-China.<br />
He said that this sum had been offered to the United<br />
Nations HighCojmissioner. for Refugees It was additional<br />
to the $ 200,000 announced on 28 March for the Indo-China operational<br />
group of the International Committee of the Red Cross.<br />
The grants would assist U. N. H. C. R. relief rand<br />
rehabilitation projects for refugees in all parts of Indo-China.<br />
U. N. H. C. R. was one of the international humanitarian<br />
organisations qualified to assist refugees on both sides of<br />
lines of military control in Indo-China. The funds could be<br />
used by U. N. H. C. R. to purchase food, medical supplies and other<br />
commodities if necessary from Australia.<br />
Australian aid for the activities of these organisations<br />
in Indo-China during the current financial year now totalled<br />
$ 2.35 million. He had earlier decided to make available seven Hercules ctransport<br />
aircraft together with other aircraft currently based at<br />
Butterworth for use in an humanitarian role in Vietnam.<br />
The task of the aircraft was to ferry supplies and<br />
materials intended to meet immediate and critical human needs.<br />
He had also given approval for the use of R. A. A. F.<br />
aircraft for the transport from Vietnam of orphans for whom<br />
adoption formalities had been completed in Vietnam and<br />
Australia, and for whom prospective Australian parents were<br />
waiting. He had asked for the co-operation of the State<br />
Premiers in speeding up the processes for admission of these<br />
children to Australia. ( See Attachment) / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
As he had indicated on 28 March, the Government was<br />
keeping the situation under continuing review and he<br />
believed that further generous Australian help could be<br />
expected if such were necessary.<br />
Over and beyond these immediate humanitarian<br />
actions, the Australian Government reaffirmed its<br />
commitment entered into within weeks of assuming office<br />
over two years ago to contribute generously to the<br />
reconstruction of post-war Indo-China.<br />
ATTACHMENT Text of a message sent by the Prime Minister earlier<br />
today to each State Premier:<br />
" You will be aware of my Government's concern that<br />
Australia should play its part in helping to alleviate<br />
the hardship and suffering now being endured by the people<br />
of South Vietnam.<br />
The adoption by Australian parents of numbers of<br />
Vietnamese children has been a note-worthy aspect of our<br />
past contribution to the relief of this suffering in the<br />
past and I should therefore be grateful if in the light<br />
of the rapid escalation of the human problems in South<br />
Vietnam in recent days you could now ask your regulatory<br />
authorities to make special efforts to finalise as<br />
expeditiously as possible decisions on applications by<br />
residents of your State for permission to adopt<br />
Vietnamese children.<br />
The Australian Government for its part will endeavour<br />
to facilitate the entry of such children for whom approved<br />
parents are selected and who:, South Vietnamese authorities<br />
have granted authority to leave.<br />
