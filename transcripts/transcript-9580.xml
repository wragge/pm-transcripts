TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP AT THE SUNBURY CAMPUS OF THE VICTORIA<br />
UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, VICTORIA, 12 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you have any comment on the National Australia Bank<br />
half a per cent drop?<br />
PM: This is certainly a good trend and I think it will come as welcome news<br />
to home owners that some of the financial institutions are now starting<br />
to begin to drop their rates after having seen the Budget. We've seen<br />
now, I think, the National Australia Bank drop its fixed rate by about 1<br />
per cent and, I think, Westpac by about half a per cent a week or so<br />
ago and we are seeing the trend accelerate. So, that's a good thing<br />
and an encouraging thing and this proves the fact that with the long<br />
bond rate coming down after the Budget, and now these housing rates<br />
starting to respond, that a lot of the pressure that we had on interest<br />
rates, the Budget is starting to dissipate.<br />
J: Do you think that will become widespread among the other banks?<br />
PM: Well it's going to be a factor in the financial markets. The Government<br />
this year, as a result of the Budget, is going to be selling $ 15 billion<br />
less worth of bonds -that is, $ 15,000 million less worth of<br />
Commonwealth bonds -and that's taken a lot of the pressure off<br />
interest rates.<br />
ends </p>
