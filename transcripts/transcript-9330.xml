SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
INDONESIAN MINISTERIAL FORUM, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY 23 AUGUST 1994<br />
Well, it's a great pleasure to welcome our Indonesian guests to Canberra for<br />
this Ministerial Forum.<br />
As you know, in 1992, President Soeharto and I agreed that it would be to our<br />
nations' mutual benefit if our Ministers from across the whole range of<br />
government activity got together on a regular and formal basis.<br />
We agreed on the Ministerial Forum because we both had a very strong<br />
sense that, by being a bit more creative and enterprising across a wider<br />
range of Ministerial portfolios, we would find new avenues for cooperation.<br />
Back in 1992, President Soeharto and I realised that the relationship was<br />
moving beyond the single purview of even the most activist Foreign Ministers<br />
and they don't make them much more activist than Gareth and All.<br />
I should mention that the outstanding work that Gareth and All have put into<br />
this relationship over a long time their intelligent and persistent efforts<br />
have been critical in constructing the foundation on which we now build and<br />
our thanks go to them for that.<br />
But Gareth and All would be the first to agree that the A, ustralia-indonesia<br />
relationship is growing richer and deeper by the close engagement of their<br />
colleagues from other portfolios.<br />
Nothing brought this home to me more clearly than the Australia Today<br />
promotion, which I and a large number of my cabinet colleagues attended in<br />
Jakarta in June this year.<br />
And let me again thank Coordinating Minister Hartarto for his great support<br />
as patron of the promotion. E24 Aug .94$' 05 N0 .001 F. 01,-04 </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
The business forum and the trade exhibition, which together formed a key<br />
part of the Australia Today promotion, showed an Australian business<br />
community eager to expand its commercial links with Indonesia.<br />
More than 200 Australian business people made their way to Jakarta in what<br />
was the largest business mission ever to leave Australia.<br />
But in many ways we shouldn't be surprised by this level of interest after<br />
all, our two way trade has grown at a trend rate of 22 per cent for the past five<br />
years to reach $ 3 billion in 1993. And Australia is one of the top ten investors<br />
in Indonesia with investments of over $ 2.5 billion.<br />
Maintaining that strong growth in the commercial relationship is one of the<br />
key aims of this Ministerial Forum. And even in its short life, the Forum has<br />
been a catalyst for growth in new areas.<br />
Let me briefly touch upon just some of those areas because they show us all<br />
just how much is actually being done.<br />
Through the Forum we have developed bilateral agreements on copyright<br />
protection, education and training, customs and health.<br />
We have also set up a program of training and technical assistance to<br />
strengthen Indonesia's intellectual property regime.<br />
The Forum's Working Group on trade, industry and investment has helped to<br />
resolve a number of impediments on the trade and investment front while also<br />
promoting industry collaboration in sectors as diverse as shipbuilding,<br />
aerospace, automotive components, medical and scientific equipment, and<br />
textiles, clothing and footwear.<br />
The Working Group on agriculture and food cooperation has already<br />
facilitated three joint ventures in meat and livestock and two potential joint<br />
ventures in horticulture. And the joint venture in cattle breeding involving the<br />
Australian Heytesbury Pastoral Group should be operational this year.<br />
The Working Group on education and training has promoted cooperation in<br />
areas ranging from university management to training in tourism.<br />
And under the Memorandum of Understanding on Education and Training, we<br />
have identified legal education as a priority area for cooperation.<br />
As part of the reform of its legal system, Indonesia has identified a need to<br />
build its legal teaching profession.<br />
So I am very pleased to announce tonight that the Australian Government will<br />
establish an Austral ia-Indonesia Legal Education Fellowship. 4 i u 9 4 C5, N0 0 C1I R 0 0 -4 </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
This fellowship will enable an eminent Indonesian nominee to undertake a<br />
period of study in Australia which will contribute to legal teaching in<br />
Indonesia, Of course, the things that are happening in the Austral ia-Indonesia<br />
relationship are not confined to the Forum and its Working Groups.<br />
Our Transport Ministers who met here in Canberra last month have laid the<br />
ground work for greater cooperation on transport links between northern<br />
Australia and eastern Indonesia.<br />
In the science and technology fields, we have had an active program of<br />
collaboration and I am delighted that Foreign Minister Alatas and Senator<br />
Cook will tomorrow sign an umbrella agreement on science and technology.<br />
My colleague Brian Howe and his Indonesian counterparts have also been<br />
exploring opportunities for cooperation in housing and urban development.<br />
In the past two years, we have exchanged ministerial-led tripartite industrial<br />
relations missions with Australia supporting trade union training and<br />
occupational health and safety projects in Indonesia.<br />
Following Senator Ray's recent successful visit, our Defence Ministers have<br />
agreed to hold annual meetings.<br />
As you can see, there are few areas of government activity where we're not<br />
doing something new. The relationship is growing in all directions.<br />
For Australia's part at least, it's hard to think of any single bilateral<br />
relationship where so much is going on.<br />
But, of course, our cooperation is by no means confined to the bilateral<br />
agenda. We are working together on many multilateral issues. Links between AFTA<br />
andCER, the ASEAN Regional Forum, regional issues such as Cambodia,<br />
and global issues lke the World trade Organisation, are all areas where<br />
I ndonesi! an -Australi! an cooperation has helped shape productive outcomes.<br />
We are, of course, particularly looking forward to cooperating with Indonesia<br />
and our other APEC partners in ensuring the success of the very important<br />
APEC leaders' meeting which President Soeharto will chair in Bogor in<br />
November.<br />
As I have said before no country is more important to Australia than<br />
Indonesia. The relations between us have never been better or more broadly<br />
based than they are now. T24. Aug. 94 : C0 5 No 01 F . C1 1'. </p>
<p>TEL 4<br />
That's not to say that we won't encounter problems from time to time, or that<br />
we don't have to work hard to make the relationship work. Nor is it to<br />
understate the differences between our societies.<br />
But it is to say that the compelling logic of our geography and our economic<br />
development will continue to open up more and more areas for cooperation.<br />
I have no doubt that this Forum will be fruitful. What we are learning from<br />
each such meeting, from every new contact, is that this relationship between<br />
Australia and Indonesia has much more to give us than we have yet taken<br />
from it that the more things we do together, the more we discover what new<br />
and exciting opportunities lie within our grasp. 24. Hu9.94 6 Ut) No . UU I F U4/ 11 4 </p>
