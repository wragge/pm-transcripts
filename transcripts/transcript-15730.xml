    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh today announced further financial assistance to help families hit by the impact of severe flooding in regional Queensland.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd said he had signed off on a special level of assistance under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) after a recommendation from Ms Bligh.</p>
<p>“I saw the impact of the floods first hand when I visited Charleville and have been in regular contact with Anna Bligh everyday to be briefed on the latest developments,” Mr Rudd said.</p>
<p>“Although areas such as Rockhampton are yet to experience the worst of the flooding, waters are beginning to subside in many other areas of the State and the full extent of damage is being revealed.</p>
<p>“Although the standard Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements already apply we believe special arrangements are warranted to assist small businesses and primary producers to fix the damage and get back on their feet</p>
<p>“That is why we have agreed to grants for registered small and home-based businesses, including farmers, of up to $10,000 or up to $25,000 depending on the extent or cost of losses.</p>
<p>“This money will help local businesses that have experienced severe damage from the floods with activities such as restocking, replanting and cleanup.”</p>
<p>Ms Bligh said eligibility criteria would be determined with the Commonwealth Government and further information would be available from the Department of Communities hotline on 1800 440 074.</p>
<p>She said the last time this funding assistance was activated was to aid in the recovery from Cyclone Larry.</p>
<p>She said the grants would be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and State and Governments on a 50/50 basis.</p>
<p>“NDRRA assistance had been activated for a further five local government areas today - Duaringa and Woorbinda in central Queensland and Booringa, Bungil and Roma Town local government areas in the State's south west.</p>
<p>“With these activations, there are now 51 local government areas where NDRRA assistance measures have been activated as a result of the monsoonal low.</p>
<p>“It also means that this month NDRRA has been activated in a total of 61 local government areas covering more than 72% or almost ¾ of the State's land area.”</p>
<p> Ms Bligh said while floodwaters were receding in Emerald and work was continuing with the recovery and clean-up across the region, Emergency Management Queensland was closely monitoring projected flood levels for the Fitzroy River at Rockhampton.</p>
<p>Personal hardship assistance, aid to restore public assets, payments for counter disaster operations and assistance for primary producers and small businesses have already been activated under the joint State-Commonwealth NDRRA.</p>
<p>Under the personal hardship provisions, people affected by flooding in these local government areas can apply for grants of up to $160 per person and $740 per family for essentials such as food, dry clothes and accommodation.</p>
<p>Assistance for affected producers and small business is in the form of concessional loans of up to $150,000 as well as the new grants announced today.</p>
<p>Eligible producers can also apply for up to 50 per cent of their total freight costs.</p>
<p>Items for transport may include emergency fodder, building and fencing materials associated with primary production, machinery and equipment, water, and animals purchased for restocking. The maximum combined freight subsidy payment per property is $5000.</p>
