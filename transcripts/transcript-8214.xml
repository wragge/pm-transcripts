PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
I have today sent the following message to Mr John Major:<br />
I write on my own behalf, and on behalf of the<br />
Government and people of Australia, to offer you<br />
my warm congratulations on your election as leader<br />
of the Conservative Party.<br />
You will take over as Prime Minister of Great<br />
Britain at a critically important time. Matters<br />
such as the search for a successful conclusion to<br />
the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, the<br />
international response to the Iraqi invasion of<br />
Kuwait, and the establishment of a new order in<br />
Europe and elsewhere, will shape the international<br />
system for many years to come. These challenges<br />
are great, but I am sure that under your<br />
leadership Britain will play a constructive and<br />
creative leadership role in developing<br />
international responses to them.<br />
I have personally derived great satisfaction from<br />
the way in which our two countries have<br />
strengthened and redefined the important links<br />
between us in recent years. Our historical ties<br />
are increasingly being supplemented by a<br />
recognition that across many fields of human<br />
activity Australia and Britain still have much to<br />
offer each other. I hope that this process will<br />
continue utinder your leadership.<br />
I look fox-ward to seeing you in London in January<br />
for the Commonwealth meeting, and to welcoming you<br />
to Australia as a guest of my Government at some<br />
later stacre.<br />
With best wishes<br />
Bob Hawke </p>
