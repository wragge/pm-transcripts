28 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE YOUTH SUICIDE SEMINAR<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you Peter Slipper; to my Ministerial colleagues Senator Amanda Vanstone and<br />
Senator John Herron; Mr Speaker; to my other parliamentary colleagues, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. I want to congratulate the Standing Committee on its initiative in<br />
organising today's seminar and I am particularly pleased that the seminar takes place<br />
against a completely bipartisan background and involving, as it does, people from the<br />
Australian community who in different ways, and some in a very sad and tragic way,<br />
have been touched by youth suicide.<br />
I've been a member of parliament now for almost 23 years and I've interviewed<br />
thousands of constituents about literally hundreds, if not thousands, of different<br />
problems. And all the interviews I've had one that has lived with me for years, and I<br />
think always will, was an interview with a mother and a father of a young man who'd<br />
taken his life in my electorate in Gladesville. The sense of bewilderment and sadness<br />
and despair and questioning of the parenting skills and the way in which that young<br />
man had been brought up and the desire on the part of those two very devoted parents<br />
who according to all the criteria as they understood it, and I must say on their<br />
explanation to me as I understood it, they'd done the right thing by their child but<br />
despite all of that he'd taken his life. And it was certainly one of the most difficult and<br />
yet the most revealing interviews that I've conducted as a member of parliament and I,<br />
as I say, I've remembered it. And it brought home to me as directly as it could as a<br />
local member of parliament the tremendous social problem and the tremendous failure,<br />
I guess, that the high rate of youth suicide in Australia represents. Now I don't<br />
pretend as leader of the Government that we have all the magical solutions and I'm not<br />
coming here to say that what's been tried in the past was completely wrong and what<br />
we're going to try is completely right it's not one of those issues and I'm sure that<br />
the Committee and its treatment of it will understand that everybody, Government and<br />
Opposition members alike, approach this with a positive sense and a sense of<br />
commitment and goodwill. </p>
<p>We have undertaken a number of commitments as Peter mentioned. We've allocated<br />
some additional resources. We have put additional resources into a youth<br />
homelessness pilot project which seeks to address some of the problems of youth<br />
homelessness. We have different strategies in the area of youth unemployment. We<br />
have, of course, committed ourselves to an 18 to $ 19 million programme over a period<br />
of three years. And on top of that we've put some additional resources into parenting<br />
education and we have also tried to address in different ways the problems and<br />
challenges of domestic violence.<br />
There are many tributaries, I suppose, to the problem family breakdown is obviously<br />
a huge part of it. If people feel that the environment in which they live has failed, that<br />
sense of failure can infect them. Mental health is clearly a key element in youth<br />
suicide. Youth unemployment is clearly a key element. I think access in the past to<br />
too easy access to firearms has made it easier for some people in a desperate state of<br />
mind to take their lives. But there have to be a whole number of explanations as to<br />
why we should have, to our great shame, such a high youth suicide rate, particularly<br />
amongst young men. It really is quite extraordinary that a country which in so many<br />
other ways can say we are doing better than many others, but in this area we are really<br />
demonstrably doing much worse.<br />
The kind of approach that will be required to bring about an improvement, I think we<br />
have to be realistic in setting the goals, the goal can be to bring about an improvement<br />
we're not going to get rid of it all together, we're never going to be that successful.<br />
But it does involve pooling the resources of people. It involves pooling the resources<br />
of the great private welfare sector of Australia and those organisations that are<br />
represented here today. It means pooling the experience of members of parliament<br />
from all parties who've dealt at a personal level. It means drawing on the experience<br />
of the medical profession, academics who've studied the patterns and the behaviour. It<br />
also means, of course, drawing on the very sad experiences of parents and siblings and<br />
friends and associates who've lost loved ones through their own hands.<br />
This is one of those social challenges that really is outside the normal constraints of<br />
government so far as the bottom line is concerned. That doesn't mean, of course, that<br />
in any area is there an unlimited source of money but it is one of those things which<br />
marks the kind of society we are. If we have such a high youth suicide rate there must<br />
be something fundamentally wrong that we have to try and put right. And if this<br />
seminar can make a contribution towards it, and I believe it can, the people on the<br />
Standing Committee represent all parts of Australia. They represent people who<br />
understand in different areas of society the difficulties that are faced by these sorts of<br />
social problems. I know that all of them bring a sense of very strong personal<br />
commitment and a very, very strong sense of goodwill towards the Committee's task.<br />
Youth suicide is very much about the failure of our society to offer young people<br />
sufficient hope because it is a sense of helplessness and a sense that there is little hope<br />
and a sense of despair and a sense that you're not useful and you feel alienated and you<br />
feel unwanted. I don't pretend to be anything other than an amateur psychologist. I<br />
don't pretend for a moment that I have anything other than an everyday understanding<br />
of human nature. But it does seem to me, and I leave this thought with you, that it is<br />
that sort of sense of hopelessness and a feeling of no self worth which perhaps more </p>
<p>than anything brings about the conditions of mind that leads a person to take their life.<br />
It is incomprehensible that in a society which has so many young people who display<br />
such tremendous optimism and enthusiasm and hope about the future it seems, to all of<br />
us, quite incomprehensible that side by side with those people who look forward to the<br />
years ahead with boundless enthusiasm, a capacity almost to solve and conquer any<br />
problem or belief that the generation that have gone before them have forgotten more,<br />
that they have forgotten more than they've ever learnt. And that tremendous self<br />
confidence that we encounter in so many of the young people in Australia which is so<br />
endearing and attractive it does seem almost incomprehensible that side by side there<br />
should also be people who feel so out of it and so ignored and so deprived of a<br />
participation in the life of the community that they should feel the pressure to take their<br />
own life.<br />
Now I hope today's seminar makes a contribution towards addressing some of those<br />
problems and I want to say on behalf of the Government that we do regard this as a<br />
very important issue. It's an issue that we will treat in a completely non-political, a<br />
completely bipartisan fashion. It's one of those issues that ought to sit astride party<br />
political differences, I know it has in the past and I know that members of both the<br />
Government and the Opposition here today are determined that that will be the case<br />
now and into the future.<br />
I want to join Peter Slipper in welcoming all of those people from the community who<br />
are here to share their experiences, to pool their information with others. I hope out of<br />
this seminar comes some very useful advice. I'm here today to demonstrate my<br />
personal interest in this issue, the personal support I have for it, the commitment of the<br />
Government and I'll be very interested to hear what comes out of it and I can promise<br />
you that it will be very conscientiously and very intensively addressed. I have great<br />
pleasure in declaring the seminar open. I'm sorry I can't stay any longer I have one or<br />
two other things to do today, including going back to Sydney for a few things. I do<br />
wish the seminar well and thank you very much for inviting me and I hope out of it<br />
comes a number of important initiatives which will, in a practical way, address a<br />
distressing mark against the good name and the compassion and the decency of the<br />
Australian society.<br />
Thank you. </p>
