Cornmonwealth Heads of Government<br />
Regional Meeting<br />
Ausral; a 9-78 12 February 1978<br />
PREIIMINARY TRANSCRIPT<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
by the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser,<br />
and the Secretary-General,<br />
in the . Jli. Jna Room, Hilton Hotel, on 12 February<br />
Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, I would lik-to<br />
elcome you all here and especially the Secretary-General, who<br />
has worked for quite some time and so enthusiastically and constructively<br />
for the particular purposes of the Commonwealth and<br />
through the Commonwealth for the wider purposes of trying to<br />
create a better and a more peaceful world. So, Secretary-General,<br />
welcome. I hope that this conference is as useful and constructive<br />
as other ones that you have attended.<br />
I would particularly like to welcome media from overseas as<br />
well as the Australian media. I recognise one or two familiar<br />
faces. I hope that they will find their time in Australia useful<br />
and maybe also that they will have some time to enjoy themselves.<br />
I am pleased that this meeting which is, I think, the<br />
largest meeting of Heads of Goverrnment to be held here, is being<br />
held in the Commonwealth context I have always believed that the<br />
modern Commonwealth, with its great diversity of nations and<br />
people within it, has the possibility and tne reality of playing<br />
a very useful role in the world where there are often difficult<br />
and, seemingly in the short term sometimes intractable problems<br />
that defy solution. I do believe that the modernCommonwealth<br />
plays a useful and constructive role in world affairs.<br />
I have also believed that Australia has not always been as<br />
constructive and as enthusiastic a member of the Commonwealth as<br />
she ought to. Over the last little while we have tried to redress<br />
that, at least so far as Australia is concerned.<br />
The Commonwealth of Nations does link a cross-section of<br />
the world and it can and is, I believe, making a significant<br />
contribution. What is happening in this conference is in many senses a<br />
new experiment for the Commonwealth. It came out of discussions<br />
at the last meeting in London in which the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting endorsed the concept of regional meetings from<br />
time to time, where regional countries felt and believed that / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
they had common purposes that they wanted to discuss and<br />
regional problems that they would like to tackle, but within<br />
a Commonwealth context, I believe also that this is a particularly<br />
useful part of the world to begin that experiment.<br />
Eepresented here this week there are a number of small states,<br />
very small by world standards, as well as states that are very<br />
large by world standards.<br />
In a full Common wealth meeting or in the United Nations<br />
or in other major international organisations, it is sometimes<br />
difficult for small states, I believe, and I think they believe,<br />
to get the representation and the hearing which is their due<br />
and which is necessary if their particular problems are to be<br />
overcome. So one of the significant matters for discussion at this<br />
meeting are the problems of small states and the Commonwealth's<br />
role in helping to seek ways a: nd means of achieving solutions<br />
to the. ir very real but sometiimes unique problems.<br />
It would be wrong if anyone expected great and dramatic<br />
results from this conference. Major problems in the world are<br />
not generally capable of solution in one step or at one meeting.<br />
They are not of that kind. What they do need, however, is a<br />
commitment by a number of countries, by a number of Heads of<br />
Government to work for a reasonable and proper solution of the<br />
problems. It is a step-by-step process. If this conference can<br />
take some useful steps in helping to overcome regional questions<br />
and at the same time if it can take one or two steps in advancing<br />
matters, such as the differences between countries of the world<br />
in relation to the Common Fund, then this conference itself will<br />
have played a useful role.<br />
In addition to that, of course, there is the intangible,<br />
immeasurable benefit of Heads of Government being able to meet<br />
together, and their officials to meet together, to discuss<br />
problems and to get to know each other that does lead to a very<br />
much better understanding of problems, of attitudes and where<br />
there are, as inevitably there will be differences, does lead to<br />
a much better understanding of each other's point of view. That<br />
is one of the great and intangible benefits of the Commonwealth,<br />
and one of the reasons why the Commonwealth has endured. I have<br />
said on a number of occasions that I believe the modernCommonwealth<br />
is much, much more influential than the old Commonwealth<br />
ever was, the old, somewhat narrow, Commonwealth of five countries.<br />
Certainly if, as I do not think could have happened, that old<br />
Commonwealth of five countries had survived to 1978, it would<br />
not have influence, it would not have impact, it would not be<br />
able to play the constructive role and the useful role that the<br />
modern Commonwealth does at the present time.<br />
On the basis of this meeting I think as you know there are<br />
two days of conference in Sydney; there will be some informal<br />
discussions when'Heads of Government go to Bowral and then the<br />
final meeting will be held towards the end of the week again in<br />
Sydney; the emphasis is on economic and regional issues. There 0./ 3 </p>
<p>is a particularly useful proposal from India for a consultative<br />
group on energy one that is very much welcomed and<br />
supported by Australia an examination of alternative energy<br />
sources. In another way, this is also one of the most interesting<br />
proposals because, as I understand it, one of India's problems<br />
is the question of energy and alternative energy sources for<br />
domestic or industry purposes at the village level. Sources<br />
of energy at that level might well have a very real link with<br />
the energy problems of rsall states, and that could lead to<br />
identi. fication of intere . ts in relation to energy between one<br />
of the largest nations in the world and between a number of the<br />
smallest nations of the world.<br />
There are clearly other econc.: ic issues, the questions of<br />
trade and the questions of access not only within the region<br />
but also countries within the region to countries outside the<br />
region. I mentioned the question of the Common Fund and how I<br />
hope that the discussion during the course of this week of<br />
matters in that area can be advanced. Australia has taken<br />
decisions which certainly gives her own position a new lock and<br />
I think will take a view somewhat closer to that of the Group<br />
of 77. I think it opens up possibilities for a general advance<br />
in t! e long-standing discussion about the Common Fund. As a<br />
commodity exporter Australia does have a number of common interests<br />
with the developing countries. To this extent I thUin we<br />
stand apart from a number of the other so-called developed<br />
countries which do not have that same interest. We therefore<br />
perhaps have a better understanding and concern of the very real<br />
problems that developing countries face that are dependent so<br />
largely on trade and commodities, a trade that is often uncertain<br />
and often unstable as to quantity and to price. The need for<br />
stable and reasonable arrangements at a proper price level is<br />
of enormous imDortance to the developing world.<br />
I believe, Mr. Secretary-General, that this meeting will<br />
contribute to even better regional understanding. I think it<br />
is going to be a constructive meeting. I have already had<br />
discussions with a number of Heads of Government this morning<br />
and yesterday and I think they, too, are looking forward to the<br />
week's discussions.<br />
Before throwing this particular press conference open to<br />
questions, I would like to ask the Secretary-General to address<br />
the gathering in any way you would like to.<br />
SECRETARY-GENERAL:<br />
Thank you, Prime Minister. You have covered the ground<br />
so adequately that there is not too much more that I would<br />
like to add.<br />
I would like to say at what is my first meeting with the<br />
press in Australia in a formal way how very pleased I have been<br />
to note the kind of interest you have taken in the meeting and<br />
the kind of background writing that has occurred in the </p>
<p>4-<br />
Australian media, in radio and television. It has all been<br />
done with deep interest and great understanding and sympathy.<br />
There has been a tendency from time to time in some capitals<br />
where Commonwealth meetings are held for the media to indulge<br />
in a kind of Commonwealth bashing. We have been altogether<br />
free from that approach. There are, of course, many issues<br />
of immense concern and some controversy within the Commonwealth.<br />
It is not free from contrariety within its membership but we<br />
rely very greatly upon an informed public opinion to sustain<br />
the kind of confidence that the leadership of the Commonwealth<br />
now has in it, in its potential and in its works and your own<br />
undersanding is a very important element in building that<br />
infor-n ation and contact with the public. So I look forward as<br />
the conference unfolds to ;-inuing close relationship with<br />
the media and to your continuinb to serve the causes of the<br />
Commonwealth in the many years ah-ad.<br />
I think, Prime Minister, there w-ill be many occasions in.<br />
the next few days when your own quite bold initiatives that<br />
have led to this meeting will be the occasion for justified<br />
praise. I would like on this very first occasion to place that<br />
on record. The Commonwealth owes a great deal all the time to<br />
initiatives of this kind that strike out in new directions and<br />
it is its capacity to respond to them, to absorb them, to mould<br />
them in ways that are relevant to the needs of a very new kind<br />
of Commonwealth that helps to make it continue to be relevant<br />
to its very varigated membership.<br />
I can confirm what you said that there is abroad, beyond<br />
the Commonwealth, a mood which takes it with seriousness. I<br />
think our last meeting in London substantially advanced the<br />
standing and the respect in which we are held in international<br />
circles and I am certain that this new endeavour, for it is a<br />
new endeavour, is bound to lead to similar responses.<br />
The very fact that 12 Heads of Government from countries<br />
as varied in so many ways as those who are here, is<br />
an indication of how seriously they take Australia's comitment,<br />
your own personal commitment, Prime iMinister, to the causes of<br />
the Commonwealth and to the concerns which they at the level of<br />
national leadership feel and articulate within a Commonwealth<br />
forum. I am sure, therefore, that the auguries are good for a<br />
successful meeting.<br />
It is a very wide region and in many ways the enormous<br />
value of this meeting lies in the fact that it brings together<br />
people who have not been together in an intimate way before.<br />
A meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government now seats around<br />
the table some 36 presidents and prime ministers. We will have<br />
seated around the table here just 12. There will be somewhat<br />
more informality and a good deal more intimacy, perhaps for<br />
that reason, a good deal more frankness and straight talking,<br />
but all the better for it. It is out of that kind of exchange<br />
of views that understandings develop and that a convergence of<br />
opinions emerge which sustains Commonwealth relationships. </p>
<p>I would like, Prime Minister, to join you in indicating<br />
for the press our willingness to be as responsive as we<br />
possibly can to your questions.<br />
MR. FRASER: It is over to you.<br />
Q. Mr. Fraser, what is the Australian Government's attitude<br />
to the Common Fund? I gather that it was discussed in<br />
Cabinet last Thursday but there has not been<br />
IMR. FRkASER: No, there has not been anything said yet. The<br />
Common Fund is in som y a complex proposal that will<br />
just be basically about thrue issues. At the last June<br />
meeting a working group was e.: tablished within the Commonwealth<br />
which did prepare a \ ery useful report in<br />
relation to the Common Fund and it was not the sort of<br />
report that was in any way committing on governments but<br />
in helping to define issues that in itself can help to<br />
resolve differences between countries. It was a usef. ul<br />
document. I think the Commonwealth Secretariat believes that<br />
ministers should meet a little later to discuss that<br />
report I do not mean during this meeting, a full<br />
Comonwealth ministerial meeting and Australia certainly<br />
supports that view.<br />
There have been many arguments between the Group of 77 and<br />
Group B countries about how a Common Fund should operate<br />
and how it should be financed, and the decisions Australia<br />
took last week in a sense take it, I think, a considerable<br />
way ahead of the general Group B countries, developed<br />
countries, in its attitude to the Common Fund.<br />
We had earlier stated a view that indicated we would<br />
support the fund being funded by the producers and consumers<br />
of commodities, that comes from the individual<br />
commodity arrangements, and also maybe by governments and<br />
were prepared to consider " other measures" which many<br />
developing countries believed ought also to be financed<br />
through the fund.<br />
We have made the firm decision that the fund should be<br />
funded not only by contributions from producers and<br />
consumers but also direct contributions by governments and<br />
also that it would be proper and I think this is the<br />
more significant change in Australia's attitude that<br />
it would be proper for the Common Fund to fund other<br />
measures which could be involved with transport, distribution,<br />
a number of other matters which are related to<br />
some aspects of commodity trade.<br />
There is a degree of imprecision in relation to the views<br />
people have of other measures and I think we will be<br />
suggesting for consideration that it might be worthwhile / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
for the Commonwealth to establish a working group to<br />
study the nature of other measures and the terms and<br />
conditions that should apply to enable funding to take<br />
place. The vic., s that Australia has taken, take us a step or<br />
two closer to the attitude of the Group of 77 but nobody<br />
is going to get everything they want out of the Common<br />
Fund. There is going to be a process of compromise in<br />
getting the fund operating, but I hope that the attitude<br />
that we are taking will contribute to the debate and<br />
contribute to the debate in a way which will enable a<br />
resolution of the issues. I think the discussion has<br />
gone on too long. We are o. of the significant world<br />
commodity traders and therefore we do understand what<br />
happens when demand changes dramatically or when price<br />
changes dramatically. it can upset the whole internal<br />
economies of a particular country. I believe that the<br />
developed countries need to approach any forthcoming<br />
discussions in relation to the Common Fund with a greater<br />
degree of commitment than they have so far shown.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, in your private discussions with the<br />
prime ministers of Fiji and New Zealand, did you find<br />
that they were enthusiastic and strong supporters of the<br />
aims and the holding of this conference?<br />
Secondly, we were told earlier that in the discussion you<br />
had with the PNG prime minister you both agreed that this<br />
conference should look closely at the problem of drug<br />
trafficking in this region and that perhaps some solutions<br />
or measures for better enforcement might come up. Could<br />
you tell us a little more on that?<br />
MR. FRASER: Part of your question I cannot answer at the moment<br />
because Mr. Muldoon is not yet here. He is coming in a<br />
little later so I have not yet had a bilateral discussion<br />
with him. I will be seeing him. I am going from this<br />
conference almost directly to meet him.<br />
I have not noticed any reluctance on the part of other<br />
Heads of Government in relation to this particular meeting<br />
and in one sense at not a great deal of notice I think it<br />
remarkable that 11 of our guests have been able to come<br />
here at one time because Heads of State and Heads of Government<br />
do get booked up sometimes quite a considerable period<br />
ahead and I know for a fact that more than one of our<br />
guests has made up his mind to come here, despite a<br />
considerable degree of personal inconvenience in relation<br />
to other arrangements that have been made concerning their<br />
own programmes.<br />
I think that the countries of the Pacific are looking forward<br />
to a forum where they believe, and I make that in<br />
broad terms and as far as I know without exception,<br />
looking forward in broad terms to a forum where their own ./ 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
problems can be discussed in a useful and constructive<br />
way where they do not get overshadowed by problems that<br />
loom larger on the world stage when you get into the<br />
major Commonwealth conference or in the United Nations.<br />
I would hope that one of the lasting results of this<br />
kind of meeting might well be the situation in which<br />
the problems of small states and of areas such as the<br />
Pacific that have very real problems which are not<br />
causing trouble really to anyone get proper attention.<br />
W\ hen I say not causing trouble, are not a cause of concern<br />
for world peace or matters of that kind, and can<br />
get proper attention and a proper focus put upon them.<br />
I hope that one of th. ' i. ings we can explore is the ways<br />
and means by which the Com. on,, ealth might be able to<br />
contribute to that particular objective.<br />
Australia, as you know, is very much concerned about<br />
drugs and the attack that seems to be being made on the<br />
Australian consumer market from people outside. There<br />
have been some very large hauls of drugs in Australia<br />
in recent times and while it has not formally been part<br />
of the agenda it has been informally canvassed as a<br />
nmatter that might well be discussed. There are world<br />
arranrgemenits in relation to drugs as you know, but when<br />
the minister concerned in Australia, 1Mr. Fife, was<br />
recently overseas it was certainly his impression that<br />
some additional measures of international co-operation<br />
could be pursued to make our general attack on the drug<br />
position more effective. When I say our general attack<br />
I mean the total attack of nations because it is not<br />
just an individual national problem. It is a problem<br />
that transcends national boundaries to a very great<br />
extent. Personally I would hope that even though it is<br />
not formally on the agenda something might come of this.<br />
SECRET ARY-GENERAL: Prime Minister, before the next question,<br />
perhaps I ought to say in respect of the first part of<br />
the last question, that it is something of a record in<br />
Commonwealth meetings for us to have the kind of hundred<br />
per cent attendance that we have achieved on this occasion.<br />
To my own knowledge Heads of Government meetings<br />
over the last 15 years have never been without some one<br />
or more, usually three or four, prime ministers or<br />
presidents who could not find it possible to come. That<br />
we have achieved this on this occasion is, I think, a<br />
fair indicator of the positive character of the response<br />
to the proposals of the meeting.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, will you be taking up the drug problem,<br />
the drug situation, in your bilateral discussions with<br />
the Malaysian and Singaporean delegations, and also can<br />
you give us an idea as to how much the hosting of this<br />
conference is costing?<br />
MR. FRASER: I cannot give a precise figure. I have seen a<br />
particular figure mentioned, I think, of a million dollars.<br />
I think that is somewhat overstating it and it may be </p>
<p>8<br />
nearer half that figure but I do not want to be held<br />
to that in any sense, shape or form at this stage<br />
because the Australian Government has been concerned<br />
to make sure that our guests are as comfortable as<br />
they can be. There is a fairly busy work schedule<br />
and we want them to be comfortable and well looked<br />
after for the week they are going to be in Australia.<br />
Let me only say that whether my estimate is nearer the<br />
actual figure or whether the estimate that I have seen<br />
printed is nearer the actual figure, in terms of the<br />
broader Commonwealth and for Australia I believe every<br />
cent is very well worth while being spent.<br />
Q. As far as the drug situation in bilateral discussions<br />
with Singapore<br />
MR. FRASER: I have not had bilateral discussions with<br />
Singapore to this point. I welcomed the Prime Minister<br />
obviously this morning and the discussions with Malaysia,<br />
the plane was a little bit late and to avoid keeping all<br />
of you waiting they were suspended and will be resumed<br />
at a later point but I have been mentioning that particular<br />
matter with most of the bilateral discussion that<br />
I have been holding.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, has the refugee question come up in your<br />
discussions so far with Malaysia?<br />
MR.. FRASER: No, it has not been raised. Australia stands<br />
ready to speak to it if it is raised but it has not been<br />
raised yet.<br />
Q. Does Australia have any proposals to put on refugees to<br />
Singapore and Malaysia, Mr. Prime Minister?<br />
MR. FRASER: I do not think in that sense. We do believe it<br />
is very important that the arrangements for handling<br />
refugees that have been established be maintained. The<br />
work of the United Nations is of enormous importance but<br />
we all know there is a very acute problem that is likely<br />
to remain while the problems between Cambodia and Vietnam<br />
remain.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, will this be seen as a good opportunity<br />
for considering a common approach to the next<br />
conference of the law of the sea?<br />
MR. FRASER: I would have thought that the law of the sea<br />
matters will certainly be introduced and I know my Foreign<br />
Minister, Andrew Peacock, has been very concerned that<br />
more progress has not been made in relation to that, but<br />
when you say common approach the purpose of these discussions,<br />
I think, is to discuss, to explore and I certainly<br />
hope that there are some things as a result that we can do<br />
together certainly on a regional basis. One of the things / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
that was indicated last June and which I support very<br />
strongly is that regional meetings of the Commonwealth<br />
ou: ht not in any sense lead to a situation in which<br />
tl:' re is a caucussing or a ganging up on other world<br />
forums, or on the Commonwealth as a whole so if there<br />
is discussion and further exploration of particular<br />
matters, that is one thing. Countries will come to<br />
their own decisions about attitudes they will take and<br />
express in other forums, Commonwealth or otherwise, but<br />
I would hate to see and I am sure everyone here would<br />
hate to see anything that could be construed as caucussing<br />
by countries outside those who are represented,<br />
whether they are within our region or in the wider world<br />
forum. That would be bad and I am sure we would all be<br />
opposed to it.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, does not this conference to a certain<br />
extent overlap with the South Pacific Forum?<br />
MR. FRASER: No, I do not really think it does, in its purpose,<br />
I mean. Countries are obviously represented very often<br />
in rmore than one international organisation. You might<br />
very easily say, does not the Commonwealth itself overlap<br />
with the United Nations. I have said on many occasions<br />
that the Commonwealth is a microcosm of the United Nations<br />
but I also believe that on many occasions, because the<br />
number of tensions that are so often evident at the United<br />
Nations are largely absent from the Commonwealth discussions,<br />
that it is possible for the Commonwealth to make<br />
progress on a particular issue in a way which maybe the<br />
United Nations cannot achieve or cannot achieve so readily.<br />
So, just to suggest that there is more than one organisation<br />
discussing a matter is not to make it as a point of criticism.<br />
Th. South Pacific Forum has a very important regional role<br />
looking purely and simply, really, at the regional problems<br />
of the member countries. This is a larger meeting. I think<br />
it can complement the work of the Pacific Forum because I<br />
believe it can assist the countries of the Pacific in<br />
different ways, perhaps in ways that the Forum itself would<br />
not be able to achieve. The Forum can work for areas and<br />
avenues of co-operation that this larger meeting could not<br />
achieve, again because there is some difference in the<br />
totality of interests. If it is possible in a subject I<br />
mentioned before, for example, to define very real areas of<br />
common concern, how best you supply energy sources at the<br />
village level in India. If that is applicable to the<br />
countries in the Pacific that is a common interest that<br />
would not emerge from Forum discussions. In addition, the<br />
attitudes that are expressed here can by individual countries<br />
be taken into wider forums and if they believe in a certain<br />
matter, they will work for it in that wider forum, whether<br />
it is the Commonwealth or the United Nations. There are two<br />
members of ASEAN here, who might equally say: does it not<br />
cut across the work of ASEAN? Again, I would say very firmly,<br />
no, it does not. ASEAN has a very specific and very important<br />
regional role which from the outside Australia supports. </p>
<p>10<br />
You need to look at the purposes of meetings and their<br />
function. I do very strongly believe that the more<br />
international communication on a personal basis, the<br />
better it is. ' hnen the Head of a Government tells you<br />
somthing and he is sitting next to you, you get quite a<br />
different view of it, very often, than from reading some<br />
words that somebody has sent in a cable. It might even<br />
be saying almost the same thing. It might be using<br />
almost the same words, but you can see his face and look<br />
at hi: expression and it is obviously much better. It<br />
is not often that Heads of Governmient can get together<br />
in this way. Quite specifically in relation to the Forum,<br />
it has got its own very particular and important role<br />
which Australia supports strongly and seeks to encourage.<br />
The matters that will be discussed this week, if anything,<br />
will only strengthen the capacity of Forum countries to<br />
support their own purposes : from within the Forum.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, do you expect there to be questions<br />
about increased aid for the South Pacific nations?<br />
MtR. FRSER: Nobody has raised that and-we have made certain<br />
decisions which individual member countries will be advised<br />
of at the present time in relation to aid but these are<br />
matters that were on the not to a total extent but in<br />
part were on the aid programme. For example, we will be<br />
providing $ 10 million to a very important hydro-electric<br />
project in Fiji, the Development Bank will be providing<br />
the inm: jor part of the funds. I think the total project is<br />
about '$ 75 million and discussions will take place between<br />
Australian and Fiji officials about the manner and distribution<br />
of Australian aid for that particular purpose.<br />
Andrew Peacock will be ready to announce the form and<br />
distribution of the special aid from the C. I. E. C. meeting<br />
and our share of that I think the total contribution<br />
of $ 18 million has already been announced, but its actual<br />
distribution you might remember that at the Paris conference<br />
it was decided that this aid should be in a form that is<br />
quickly distributed to meet particular purposes. The<br />
countries that are represented here that are to be recipients<br />
of part of that amount will be advised. We will be providing<br />
a loan to the Forum shipping line of $ 180,000 which is necessary<br />
so that it can commence operations. There are matters<br />
of this kind in many senses they are not part of the<br />
mainstream of the conference. I think Australia is rather<br />
taking the opportunity to mention these things to the<br />
countries concerned at this particular time. I think it<br />
is on wider issues that the real use of this particular<br />
conference will demonstrate itself.<br />
Q. Mr. Fraser, will you be arguing at the conference that the<br />
unemployment figures for Australia released last Friday<br />
which the acting minister said were higher than expected<br />
will make it harder still for Australia to let in more<br />
imports from the region? / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
MR. FRASER: To put that question into context, obviously it<br />
does not make it easier when there is unemployment but I<br />
am glad that question was asked because over recent times<br />
Australia's trade position has not been adequately understood.<br />
When you look at Australia's imports of industrial<br />
products from developing countries, Australia . stands at<br />
145 a head of our population, the United States at 40 a<br />
head but then you fall to the European Community at 827 a<br />
head and Japan at only 1$ 17 a head. If you look at the per<br />
capita import-of textiles, clothing and footwear which<br />
a-re particularly sensitive items, Australia stands at<br />
from the ASEAN countries for example ' 2.14 a head, the<br />
United States 630, the European Community 510, Japan 250.<br />
On both those bases Australia is importing much more per<br />
capita than three large trading blocs which house very<br />
close to 600 million people. I think countries do understand<br />
that an Australian market of 14 million people<br />
obviously cannot solve the trading problems of our own<br />
region much less the trading problems of the world<br />
espOecially when 25 per cent of our total export, about<br />
nearly $ 5,000 million worth, are subject to import quotas,<br />
bans-prohibitions and all the rest, Non-tariff barriers<br />
in other words, which often destroy any possibility of<br />
trade. Even despite that, from all developing countries<br />
in the five years up to the last statistics we have, 1976/<br />
1977, trade has increased by 40 per cent per annum, from<br />
the developing Commonwealth regional countries represented<br />
here by 32 per cent per annum, from ASEAN countries by 41<br />
per cent per annum, even if trade began on a relatively low<br />
base, a relatively low base soon grows into a very large<br />
sum indeed, at that rate of increase, and I believe that is<br />
recognised. Let me give another comparison. If the ASEAN countries had<br />
the same access to Europe, to North America and to Japan in<br />
textiles, clothing and footwear, as they do to Australia,<br />
they would be exporting an additional : 1,000 million worth<br />
of textiles, clothing and footwear and that, I think, tends<br />
to put Australia's position, which has not always been<br />
adequately understood, into perspective.<br />
Q. Is that the line you have been putting to the Malaysian<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
MR. FRASER: I think this is consistent with views I have been<br />
expressing publicly and privately for nearly a year now,<br />
certainly for the last eight or nine months.<br />
Q. Sir, a general question. IWhy did you decide to initiate,<br />
push and host this meeting? What is in it for Australia?<br />
Is it the start of an attempt by Australia to play a more<br />
influential role in the region, and generally on the world<br />
stage?<br />
MR. FRASER: I do not think in the context of that question. I<br />
happen to believe in the Commonwealth, and I had stated<br />
views directed to that end long before the Commonwealth<br />
conference in London last June. I believe there are many / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
differe'tl ways in which the Commonwealth's purposes can<br />
be advantaged. I had indicated before it might have<br />
been at a speech in New Guinea at their own independence<br />
celebrations, which was quite a long while ago, in<br />
political terms that therCe was room for a more vigorous<br />
and wholehearted com! mitment on the part of Australia to<br />
the Comomonwealth. I believe that is so. Believing that,<br />
it is obvious that it be the purpose of any government<br />
that I lead to give effect to it. It is not a question<br />
of individual countries exerting a leadership role within<br />
the Commonwealth. It is a question of consensus, of<br />
having common views. If Australia or India or Fiji<br />
express views that are generally accepted, then the<br />
Commonwealth will pursue those views. But if a particular<br />
country expresses views that are not going to have a general<br />
consensus amongst other members of the Commonwealth<br />
then the Commonwealth will not go down that particular<br />
path. So it is a consensus organisation and I think it<br />
ought to be. That is not to say that countries should<br />
not try to put forward constructive ideas. I think we<br />
all ought to, all individual members of the Commonwealth,<br />
and I believe all members of the Commonwealth seek to play<br />
that role. What we are doing in relation to the Commonwealth<br />
is not just directed only at that because right from the<br />
earliest times the Foreign Minister was seeking to do more<br />
in relati on to the Pacific. Our aid had been very much<br />
orientated purely to South-East Asia, Papua New Guinea, a<br />
bit further afield but very much South-East Asia and Papua<br />
New Guinea and in terms of the problems they face. Until<br />
Andrew Peacock became Foreign Minister, I believe that<br />
Australia had not given adequate attention in aid terms to<br />
the problems of Pacific countries. We have sought to<br />
redress that in terms of increase so I think you have got<br />
to look at all of this as part of a pattern, part of a<br />
purpose, but I certainly hope it is not looked at as any<br />
attempt of Australia to stand on a pedestal or anything of<br />
that kind because that would be very far from the truth.<br />
It is being in one sense a member of a team, the team being<br />
the Commonwealth, and lending what weight Australia can to<br />
Commonwealth purposes.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, the Common Fund will require uncommonly<br />
large funding if it is to operate effectively. Are the<br />
decisions your Cabinet has taken, presumably in principle,<br />
to support the Common Fund, firm enough for you to now<br />
make a firm commitment that Australia would be a major<br />
contributor to the Common Fund and if so by how much, in<br />
round figures?<br />
MR. FRASER: No, it is not possible to put a figure on it. It<br />
is possible to say, certainly, that Australia would be a<br />
contributor to the Common Fund.<br />
Q. A major contributor, sir?<br />
MR. FRASER: In relation to our population. We need always to<br />
have that in mind because let us not forget that 600 million<br />
people in Europe, North America and Japan and they are fairly<br />
powerful, influential trading groups and Australia's 14 m.<br />
is relatively small by comparison with their approaching .0/ 15 3 </p>
<p>13<br />
600 million. I quite deliberately made the point that<br />
producers and consumers need to be involved in any<br />
funding for a Common Fund. The obligations of getting<br />
stability and trade do not only fall on producers, they<br />
fall on consumers and it has been recognised from time<br />
to time in international wheat agreements, international.<br />
sugar agreements, but I believe also, and I think this<br />
is unfortunate, that very often the greatest progress<br />
towards agreement so far as European countries is concerned<br />
is made at times when there are low commodity prices-because<br />
then it is obviously in their interests to push fo.-: ard<br />
for agreement on the basis of a fairly low base and there is<br />
a tendency to lose interest if prices go in another direc-ion.<br />
But I hope that transitory matters can be put aside and that<br />
everyone can approach the question of a Common Fund with a<br />
very real sense of cosit-ment because without that commitment<br />
it will not be reached, it will not be evolved and from our<br />
own experience in trade, we are looking now, and this a<br />
domestic matter, to try and get a more even balance in meat<br />
prices in Australia and Australians will know what the lack<br />
of that has meant to many people in this country. We are<br />
also operating a commodity arrangement which Australians<br />
alone this is producers and governments or by loans have<br />
funded to try and get more stable prices for wool on the<br />
world market and in many senses what we do does set a stability<br />
in wool prices right around the world. So these things<br />
can be done and it is out of that experience, I think, that<br />
our conviction that arrangements can be made to work is<br />
found, but they will not work unless there is a coemitment.<br />
There needs to be a commitment not only by the developing<br />
countries, as there certainly is, but also by developed<br />
countries who have obligations to help establish stable trade<br />
arrangenents at reasonable nrice levels for commodities. So<br />
who is going to find how much finance there is in this, I do<br />
not know.<br />
Our coi-mmitment to provide funds is there. That is unequivocal.<br />
But you need to look at the totality of funds required<br />
and Australia would certainly be prepared to pay its own<br />
fair and reasonable part in this arrangement as we have in<br />
other international arrangements.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, one follow-up question on trade. The<br />
arguments that you put about Australia's trading position<br />
as it is to the rest of the world, you put them before, as<br />
you said, and Malaysia and Singapore have continued in their<br />
criticism. I am wondering what you are going to be saying<br />
to the Datuk and to Mr. Lee to make them see the error of<br />
their ways. Are you going to be putting any new arguments<br />
to them?<br />
MR. FRASER: I think it would be presumptuous indeed, of me, to<br />
suggest that anyone should see the error of their ways,<br />
certainly anyone anyone at all. There is one point that<br />
I would like to add just before we close. I have not said<br />
it here, but I have said it in Kuala Lumpur and on other<br />
occasions. What Australia can do in terms of trade and 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
access to Australia's market's depends not insignificantly<br />
on the kind of access that we can get to other<br />
ma~ rkets, and the-fact that we are denied access to<br />
many markQ-' ts in Europe, Japan and also in the Unite~ d<br />
State, where wre face non-tLariff barriers which means<br />
absolut'-e barriers, covering matters that could! be worth<br />
up to million on an annual basis, cl early has an<br />
imp1. ic. 1t'ion for tbe Australian economy. It males the<br />
Austr.-, ian econony weaker -than it would otherwise be and<br />
has a seriour; impact on the kind of access that we caii<br />
allowa on, an increasing basis to ohrcountries. I<br />
