EMBARGO: 5.00 pm,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SNA, 26 APRIL 1981.<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Over the past week Federal Cabinet has been considering the<br />
recommendations of the Ministerial committee that has been<br />
reviewing the functions of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
I shall be announcing the Government's decision<br />
on the committee's recommendations to'.-the Parliament in the<br />
coming week.<br />
Since the Government came to office in 1975, we have<br />
established, maintained and strengthened a range of review<br />
procedures and mechanisms designed to make sure that expenditure<br />
is restrained in each sector of Government. But from time<br />
to time the Government must take a: long, -: hard'look at the<br />
totality of its activities, aizA measure its;: achievements<br />
against its goals and its underlying philosophy; it must<br />
renew its-commitment to its philosphy and take steps to ensure<br />
that that philosophy is put into practice by its policies<br />
and its actions". The review of Commonwealth functions was<br />
designed to serve precisely this purpose.<br />
In 1975, the Government committed: itself to. a programme<br />
of reform designed to restore prosperity to Australia.<br />
Essential to that programme was the view-that prosperity<br />
would be promoted best by more limited Government: that<br />
massive Government spending and huge.' budget deficits were<br />
a source of inflation, uncertainty, and unemployment; that<br />
high taxatio * n took income from the hands of individuals who<br />
know best what they need and put it into the hands of<br />
bureaucrats; and that Goverment intervention and regulation<br />
was often a source of inefficiency, destroying incentive or<br />
misdirecting them. Also essential to our programme was the<br />
view that good government does not mean highly centralised<br />
Government; that highly centralised Government gives undue<br />
influence td" a priveleged few,-. removes responsibility from<br />
those who should exercise it and impose uniformity where<br />
people want diversity.<br />
Our approach has been guided by our fundamental nhilosophy<br />
that it is individuals and their needs that count, and that<br />
the greatest possible * decentralisation of decision-making<br />
gives people maximum influence over their own destiny. our<br />
policies sometimes have been misunderstood, or deliberately<br />
misinterpreted, but the results now speak for themselves. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
The review of Commonwealth functions has been undertaken<br />
to continue the process of reform of Government and to<br />
ensure that the hard won gains of the last five years<br />
are not.' lost. li<br />
While the'review has been concerned to further increase<br />
economy and efficiency in Government by eliminating waste,.<br />
duplication and unnecessary cost, it has not been simply a<br />
cost-cutting exercise. The name, the razor gang, given<br />
to the review committee by: the media, implied an entirely<br />
inapproptiate emphasis, the review's objective was to promote.<br />
prosperity, not austerity. The central purpose of the<br />
review was in fact to continue the process of restoring an<br />
appropriate balance between the role of the public sector<br />
and that of the private sector and an appropriate balance<br />
within the public sector between the Commonwealth and the<br />
states.<br />
Accordingly, the activities of all Commonwealth Government<br />
Deoartments and their authorities have been extensively<br />
examined to determine whether functions currently performed<br />
by the Commonwealth can be taken over by, or sold to,<br />
. private enterprise; where the burden of regulations imposed<br />
on private activity by the Commonwealth can be reduced or<br />
eliminated; whether functions' and responsibilities undertaken<br />
or shared by the . Commonwealth can be more appropriately and<br />
efficiently handled by the states, and which Commonwealth<br />
functions might be reduced, performed more efficiently or<br />
eliminated. The importance we attach to this review was clearly indicated<br />
by the fact that the review committee was composed of<br />
senior Ministers and by the fact that the Committee was<br />
chaired by the Deputy Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal<br />
Party, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip<br />
Lynch. I believe that the Cabinet decisions resulting from that<br />
committee's deliberations which I shall announce this<br />
coming week will be seen as confirmation of the Government's<br />
commitment to strong, effective but limited government. But<br />
more than this, they will be seen to be a milestone on the<br />
road to an Australian economy, and an Australian people, which<br />
fully exploits its true potential. </p>
