AUSTRALIAN'INDI GEOUS CRUDE OIL'<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MI NISTER<br />
I n September 1965 the Government announced certain policy<br />
decisions regardin--the use of Australian indigenous crude oil.<br />
Those decisions were a re-affirmation of the policy that the<br />
Government was determined that local refineries use all the crude oil produced<br />
in Australia, and an announcement that the price to be paid by refineries for<br />
* Australian crude would be $ 3.14 cents a barrel at the customs port at the<br />
refining centre nearest to the producin-field. Included in this price was 67<br />
cents a barrel as an " incentive" payment.<br />
This arrangement was to finish on September 17 197-and no<br />
W" Cisions were announced as to what would happen after that date.<br />
At that time the Moonie field was the only one in operdtion.<br />
The production of the Moonie and Barrow fields was, and is, comparatively<br />
small and the extra cost resulting from the crude oil they sell at $ 0.14 cents<br />
a barrel, together with freight costs is already included in petrol prices in<br />
Australia. Subsequently, very extensive oil fields were discovered in Bass<br />
. Strait by Esso/ BHP. Oil from these fields should begin to flow in Aarch 196<br />
and by September 1973 it is expected that the fields will be producing at over<br />
253, 3 barrels of crude oil a day. During that period, this field may well<br />
produce in the vicinity of 61 million barrels. The prospect of such large<br />
quantities of oil which refineries had to buy at a price so much higher than the<br />
O price of imported oil, obviously created a new problem and led to forecasts of<br />
considerable rises in prices of petrol and other petroleum products.<br />
0 Because of the effects that this would have throughout the<br />
economy the Government has most carefully studied the various problems raised<br />
and I nave for some time been engaged in a series of negotiations with Australian<br />
oil producers and refiners.<br />
I now wish to inform the House that the Government re-affirms its<br />
policy that for a period of ten years beginning on September 18 1Q73 refineries<br />
in Australia are to process Australian crude oil in order to provide the full<br />
requirements of the Australian market for petroleum products.<br />
This is of course subject to the need for sufficient imports to<br />
meet the requirements in Australia f3r bitumen, lubricants and fuel oil in excess of<br />
quantities that can be realised from Australian crude.<br />
Secondly the Government announces as policy that for a period<br />
of five years after September 17 1573 when the present policy arrangements<br />
terminate the price that refineries will be required to pay Australian producers<br />
will be import parity. Import parity is defined as the posted prices of overseas oil as of<br />
today, less the discounts allowed off those posted prices as of today, plus<br />
overseas freioghts at the most efficient and economic rates prevailing today, </p>
<p>plus wnarfage where applicable.<br />
To this price will be added a sum for quality differential worked<br />
qut by the modified Nelson method.<br />
From the import parity price so arrived at will be deducted<br />
a sum representation the averagefreight cost. ofAdelivering Australian<br />
oil to the refineries from the port of delivery by the most economical means<br />
possible. This will mean that as from September 1972, for a period of<br />
five years, the price payable for Australian oil should generally be neither<br />
higher, nor lower, than the price now payable for overseas oil except for the<br />
effect of Australian coastal freights.<br />
I now come to the period between March 1969 and September 197?<br />
during which the present arrangement operates, during which the presently<br />
applying high prices for Australian crudes were agreed to be paid, and during<br />
which significant increases in the cost of petroleum products have been<br />
suggested. SI have already said that the cost of oil from Moonie and Barrow<br />
at these hi ; h prices has been absorbed in existing petrol prices, and no<br />
alteration is to be made to the prices payable for oil from those fields until<br />
after September 1970 when the import parity prices which I have described<br />
will apply. In the case of the oil fields discovered by Esso/ BHP we have<br />
agreed by negotiation that there will be a reduction in the prices Australian<br />
refineries are required to pay up to September 1973.<br />
Our agreement is that Esso/ BHP will altogether forego the 67 cents<br />
a barrel known as the " incentive" allowance. In addition, Esso/ BHP will allow<br />
refineries a further discount of 5 cents a barrel.<br />
The result is between vlMarch 1969 and September 1973 the price<br />
to be paid for this oil will be reduced from 14 cents a barrel to $ 2.42 cents<br />
obarrel at the customs port at the refining centre nearest to the producing field.<br />
After September 1970 the price payable for this oil will be import<br />
parity as already explained. This will reduce the price payable still further.<br />
To sum up, Mr. Speaker, the new arrangements made will mean<br />
that the large newly discovered quantities of Australian oil to be used between<br />
March 1369 and September 197 will cost 72 cents a barrel, or a little over 2 cents<br />
a gallon, less than was previously anticipated.<br />
After September 1972 the price payable for Australian crudes will<br />
be no more than the price of imported overseas crudes today except for any extra<br />
cost involved in coastal transportation.<br />
This will not between March 1969 and September 197'. in<br />
itself prevent any increase in the price of petrol. But it will undoubtedly<br />
materially reduce the size of any rise that might take place. </p>
<p>I t. Ave so far spoken only of the pricini policy for Australian<br />
crudes and of the Government's requirement that the Australian market should<br />
be supplied from such crudes.<br />
But we need to discover more oil in Australia.<br />
The Government is therefore currently studying the sep t'rate<br />
question of the need for incenitive for oil exploration in the period after<br />
September 17 19711 Various proposals are under examination and we will in due<br />
course announce the form of incentive, if any, which we will adopt.<br />
In the meantime the arrangements I have just announced will<br />
provide a firm basis upon which industry can plan ahead for the use of<br />
Australian crudes and will reduce any future rise in the price of petroleum<br />
j oducts.<br />
