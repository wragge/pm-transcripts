PRIME MINISTER<br />

FOR MEDIA 21 MARCH 1990<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
( ANBERRRA WEDNESDAY, 21 MARCH 1990<br />
Ladies and ( lentlemen, Friends,<br />
I believe the events of this campaign have confirmed the<br />
accuracy of what I said five weeks ago: that this is the<br />
most import;, nt election since 1949. Now, near the end of<br />
the campaigi,, I want to use the opportunity which you<br />
have given le, not to make new announcements not to<br />
cover all the ground in detail but to sum up; to<br />
describe the: basis on which I believe the Australian<br />
people must make a fundamental choice on Saturday.<br />
The essentiitl differences between Labor and the Liberal-<br />
National Coitlition run deep very deep and they are<br />
threefold. First, we d:. ffer about the sort of Australia we wish to<br />
see in the ,, ears ahead. I have, as you know,<br />
characterisid that difference as a fundamental choice<br />
between the opening of opportunity or the entrenchment of<br />
privilege. Second, we differ over the means of getting to where we<br />
wish to go. Where we have a coherent strategy, the<br />
Peacock-Bluw, t Coalition has totally failed to explain hcsi<br />
it is going to do what it says it will do for instance<br />
in industri: il relations, health, micro-economic reform<br />
and the funding of the binge of promises the Coalition<br />
has made in the campaign.<br />
As Michael :; tutchbury wrote recently, it is " economic<br />
gibberish", an " economic fairy tale".<br />
And the oth,' r difference concerns leadership. The<br />
Australian people face a choice between a Hawke<br />
Government ) r a Peacock Government. It is a choice<br />
between a ujnited and experienced Labor team and a<br />
disunited c,, llection of individuals whose deep<br />
antagonisms have been papered over and very imperfectly<br />
at that only for the time being and only in the short<br />
term pursuit of power. Personal tensions and policy<br />
differences abound, and such is the state of turmoil </p>
<p>2.<br />
within Libezal Party politics that Andrew has even been<br />
heard in this campaign to quote Marx Groucho that is.<br />
My Friends,<br />
When all is said and done, I have staked my Government's<br />
prospects in this election on reason and realism. We<br />
have rejected glitter, glib promises and smoke and<br />
mirrors We have openly acknowledged that tough<br />
decisions have had to be taken in the past, that things<br />
have not been easy for many Australians and that hard<br />
work still lies ahead.<br />
We have triedI above all to appeal to the good sense of<br />
the Australi~ tn people their capacity to recognise that<br />
Mr Peacock's economic analysis of gloom and doom takes no<br />
account of the record job growth we have achieved, the<br />
increase we are seeing in manufactured exports, the<br />
reduced tax rates we have brought about, record<br />
investment levels, the fact that interest rates can now<br />
responsibly come down, the workplace reforms which are<br />
underway as demonstrated only yesterday by the agreement<br />
in the metal industry. We are appealing to the capacity<br />
of the Australian people to distinguish real problem<br />
solving and clear, sensible plans for the future of this<br />
country from snake oil.<br />
That has beer, a hallmark, I suggest, of my Government. I<br />
do not say we have been faultless, but we are I believe<br />
known by the people to stand for sound policy, workable<br />
policy, consistent pursuit of long-term goals. The<br />
Liberals and Nationals offer confusion, a perilous leap<br />
into the dark.<br />
Now, it is the conventional wisdom that many in the<br />
electorate axe cynical about this election; that it is<br />
not really seen as a watershed; that there is no deep<br />
divide between the parties and no fundamental difference<br />
of vision exists; that no ideals are at stake.<br />
To people who think that way, and particularly to those<br />
young people who may believe the election does not engage<br />
their idealisin, and will not affect their stake in the<br />
future of this country, I say, with respect, I hope they<br />
will think again. The stakes are high, the issues<br />
profound. So one of the main things that I have tried to<br />
communicate to the public in this campaign is that the<br />
Liberal-National Party view of Australia's future or at<br />
least the view of those who would really call the shots<br />
departs in th* e most basic and important ways from the<br />
vision of my Government and my Party.<br />
Our disagreements on budget policy, the system of wage<br />
determination, Medicare, the capital gains tax, mining in<br />
Kakadu and all the rest are the deeply trcubling symptoms<br />
of an even dee~ per difference, a difference of principle. </p>
<p>I repeat today wtiat I said here last December that in<br />
this election I am fighting to realise a vision for<br />
Australia an Australia with a modern, diversified,<br />
competitive and export-oriented economy; an Australia<br />
vigorously engaged with the world economy, and enmeshed<br />
in particular with the dynamism of Asia and the Pacific;<br />
an Australia committed to maintaining and enhancing the<br />
quality of life, social justice and the preservation of<br />
our natural enviconment; a self-reliant Australia, not<br />
merely fitting in with the world as we find it but<br />
helping shape it.<br />
Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, if Mr Peacock and Mr Blunt,<br />
and their Coalition, agreed with me that this is the sort<br />
of Australia to which we should aspire as we approach the<br />
next century, thain the choice on 24 March would indeed<br />
only be a choice about means, not about ends. And since<br />
the Opposition has so completely failed to explain just<br />
how it would go about governing Australia, it would be a<br />
pretty empty debate on their side.<br />
But in fact we have a disagreement about the ends<br />
themselves, about the very objectives for which we should<br />
be striving.<br />
For if you reallv believe in economic prosperity fairly<br />
achieved and fairly shared how can you, like the<br />
Opposition, believe in abolishing the capital gains tax,<br />
and in social poLicies of slash and burn which reward the<br />
rich at the expemise of the less well of f, the sick, the<br />
newly arrived mitirant, the Aboriginal Australian?<br />
If you really believe in increasing investment and<br />
employment, and an Australia which works in harmony to<br />
modernise and diversify its economy, how can you justify<br />
a " Who's to know."' attitude towards wage outcomes and<br />
seek to substitute industrial turmoil for steady,<br />
sustained industrial reform?<br />
If you believe in productive investment for a growing<br />
economy, again, how can you believe in abolishing the<br />
capital gains with all the distortion of investment<br />
decisions and thet tax avoidance which that would entail?<br />
If you believe iit boosting national savings and<br />
rulternational competitiveness, how can you oppose award<br />
superannuation, &amp; ond promise billions of dollars in<br />
unfunded Governmetnt spending which will lead to exactly<br />
the opposite result?<br />
If you believe iii an enhanced quality of Australian life,<br />
how can you believe in logging our rainforests and mining<br />
our national parks?<br />
if you believe it, a competitive Australia meshed into the<br />
world economy and trading effectively around the globe,<br />
how can you even toy with the idea of forming an<br />
1; 8 11, </p>
<p>4.<br />
inward-looking sian trade bloc, a proposal which no<br />
country in the cegion would accept; and rightly so.<br />
If you believe i. n a constructive role for Australia in<br />
international affairs, how can you believe in scrapping<br />
the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone in order to leave<br />
open the stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia, or<br />
in slashing aid to our neighbours and other countries in<br />
need, or in dis, nantling the Department of Foreign Affairs<br />
and Trade simply to find a slot for a National Party<br />
Minister? And this comes from the hypocrites who talk in<br />
their policy speaech and I quote about the need to<br />
integrate foreijn, economic and trade policies.<br />
Make no mistake across the board the Opposition's<br />
policies point : learly to the very different sort of<br />
Australia for which the Liberals and Nationals stand.<br />
This would be Australia in which the well-being of the<br />
many will depen-1 upon trickle down from the few. It<br />
would be an Aus:: ralia in which the less well-off are<br />
denied dignity : nd opportunity. It would be an Australia<br />
in which the so.: ial trap door replaces the social safety<br />
net. It would he an Australia used as a laboratory for<br />
irrational expe-: imentation by the New Right. It would be<br />
an Australia in which profit always takes priority over<br />
environmental p-otection.<br />
This is, therefi) re, an election about fundamentals.<br />
Now, my friends the Coalition's approach in this<br />
election has be,! n, in the words of the Financial Review,<br />
" to dredge up old issues and old battles rather than<br />
develop new blu,! prints for the future".<br />
But Labor has g,, ne into this campaign united, with a<br />
positive plan fir Australia's future and above all with<br />
concrete propos; ils to give that plan reality. We know<br />
what we are going to do, and we know how we are going to<br />
do it.<br />
By a positive p. an I mean the following first it is a<br />
plan which is d(. monstrably workable; second it is a plan<br />
which genuinely addresses the long-range needs of the<br />
country; and third it is a plan which is fully funded and<br />
therefore totally credible.<br />
Our methodology going into this campaign was utterly<br />
different from Ihat of the Opposition we identified<br />
offsets and savings first, and the determined what new<br />
programs were al fordable. And we did so for a full three<br />
years. The fin,]. scoresheet from the Minister for<br />
Finance which is attached to the printed copy of this<br />
speech reveal. we have come out exactly on target.<br />
In each of thes( respects the Opposition's alternative<br />
fails the test. ' i </p>
<p>First, take the . rssue of realism. Nowhere else is the<br />
Opposition incapitcity to develop clear and workable<br />
policies more evident than in their chaotic industrial<br />
relations policy and in their health policy fiasco.<br />
Second, take the obligation to address the fundamental<br />
issues affecting Australia. Here the Coalition program<br />
is replete with c; ins of omission like education and<br />
science and of commission like the abolition of the<br />
capital gains tax, the opposition to national savings<br />
through award superannuation, and the dismantling of our<br />
reforms to the very machinery of the Commonwealth<br />
Government itself.<br />
And third, over and above all this, Mr Peacock has been<br />
utterly unable to explain where the money is coming from.<br />
He has in fact been incomprehensible.<br />
Let's be clear; there would be only three options for a<br />
Liberal-National Government in dealing with their fiscal<br />
black hole to eat into the budget surplus, to ditch<br />
their election promises, or to take the meat axe to<br />
social programs. A fourth option is a consumption tax,<br />
but I will resist the temptation to which Mr Peacock<br />
succumbed and not drag out that old chestnut here.<br />
My Friends,<br />
The plan which we have put to the country has been spelt<br />
out in the series of announcements we have m * ade during<br />
the campaign, starting with the Treasurer's statement in<br />
the first week ani. ending with our statements on the<br />
environment and law and justice in the last.<br />
This has been no disparate series of ad hoc proposals.<br />
Each and every one links directly back to the<br />
architecture for the Australia of the future we are<br />
trying to build.<br />
To build that Australia we must increase national<br />
savings. Labor hits clear, workable policies to do this.<br />
We have increased the public sector's contribution to<br />
national savings 1) y 8 percent of GDP. We have boosted<br />
superannuation in a way that will see additional annual<br />
savings equal to a'round 3 percent of GDP. These changes<br />
will do two things address our current account deficit<br />
dfid allow for cont~ inued growth in the capital stock.<br />
Along with other m~ easures, including encouraging growth<br />
and diversification of exports, this is an integral part<br />
of our strategy to tackle Australia's overseas debt.<br />
The Coalition has no policies to boost national savings.<br />
Indeed, their opposition to award superannuation and<br />
their unfunded spending promises would seriously erode<br />
Australia's national savings.<br />
To build the sort of Australia we want we must expand<br />
Australia's productive capacity and exports. This<br />
( i 18 </p>
<p>6.<br />
involves predtictable and affordable wage outcomes to<br />
ensure contiitued investment and employment growth,<br />
improved rectognition of training through award<br />
restructurinti, our ten point program of realistic<br />
micro-reform. better targeted export promotion programs<br />
and strategi~ ts to increase Australia's exports of<br />
services. Peacock and hlunt, by contrast, only offer a free-for-all<br />
wages policy and micro-reform devoid of implementation<br />
plans. Micrto-economic reform through all-out<br />
confrontation means, in the end, no micro-economic reform<br />
at all.<br />
To build the sort of Australia we want, we need positive<br />
programs for the clever country. in putting that<br />
objective hi( oh on the national agenda we have struck a<br />
chord with the Australian community; they know it needs<br />
to be done. Our co-operative scientific research<br />
centres, the Education Completion Allowance and the<br />
disadvantaged schools program represent major innovations<br />
which will di-liver the results. But these vital matters<br />
are complete! y overlooked in the pronouncements of the<br />
Opposition. To build the sort of Australia we want in terms of a<br />
ladder of opp. ortunity for all Australians, we have<br />
offered proposals in childcare, in tackling the new<br />
generation ol. social issues in outer urban and rural<br />
areas, to abolish the concept of the dole with enhanced<br />
programs of iraining and retraining for the unemployed,<br />
and forward looking agendas on women' s issues and<br />
multiculturalism. So here too we have delivered.<br />
To build the sort of Australia we want requires the<br />
strong decisions we have taken to protect the natural<br />
environent. The list of specific environmental issues<br />
on which we disagree with the Liberals and Nationals is<br />
now as long its your arm. But underlying them is a<br />
fundamentally different philosophy.<br />
We put environmental protection side by side with<br />
economic development in judging whether a particular<br />
proposal should go ahead. The Opposition, by stark<br />
contrast, will always consider environmental protection<br />
to be, at best, a secondary consideration. Look at the<br />
1iintree rainforests; look at Kakadu.<br />
And to build the sort of Australia we want we need a<br />
foreign policy which is ahead of the game in a rapidly<br />
changing world.<br />
I an proud that this Government has delivered exactly<br />
that with our initiative on Cambodia, our leadership in<br />
Asia/ Pacific economic cooperation, our constructive role<br />
in the fight to ban chemical weapons, the greater<br />
maturity in our vital relationship with the United<br />
States, our early recognition that change in the Soviet ii 1 9 </p>
<p>Union was rtal and provided new opportunities for<br />
Australia, t" ur uncompromising assertion of Australia's<br />
interest in a free and open international trading system<br />
and our lead role in the Commonwealth on southern Africa,<br />
something which the conservatives would wind back at<br />
exactly the wrong moment in the long history of the fight<br />
to end apartheid.<br />
And whereas we have acted, you will search in vain in<br />
Mr Peacock'.,; campaign statement to find any suggestions<br />
on how he w') uld advance Australia's vital regional or<br />
global trading interests.<br />
My Friends,<br />
We have always acknowledged that the solutions to secure<br />
Australia's future are not simple ones.<br />
To be sure, many Australians, especially those paying<br />
high intere:; t rates, have faced difficulties. To be<br />
sure, there are concerns such as overseas debt which need<br />
careful management. But the way through, the way to<br />
achieve the great potential of this great country, is<br />
sound policy policy based on realism about both our<br />
problems as a nation and our capacities as a nation.<br />
Hollow prom ises and superficial prescriptions are no<br />
answer at aLl.<br />
I want to say to those who intend to vote for third party<br />
and independlent candidates that they should consider with<br />
the greates: care where they direct their second<br />
preferences. This is a vital election and it is I make<br />
no bones about it a tight election.<br />
In no way do I question the right of people to vote for a<br />
third party or independents. But what I do emphasise is<br />
this realityI that when people who wish to vote this way<br />
wake up on 25 March there will be either a Labor<br />
Government or a Liberal-National Government elected to<br />
office in Cainberra with either myself as Prime Minister<br />
or Andrew P~ iacock as Prime Minister. There won't be a<br />
Democrat Government; there won't be a green independents<br />
Government. And so I say specifically to them if you do not want<br />
Medicare gutted, the capital gains tax scrapped, more<br />
dianium mining, a uranium enrichment industry in<br />
Australia, tp-front tuition fees, mining in Kakadu, then<br />
your preferlince between the two major parties must be<br />
Labor. Thai: is the simple imperative.<br />
And I want t~ o urge all my fellow Australians to think<br />
very long and very hard about the fiscal recklessness,<br />
social injus; tice and environmental vandalism that are<br />
absolutely inherent in the Liberal-National policies<br />
revealed in this campaign. They have failed utterly as<br />
an Opposition. to develop workable policies for<br />
Government. </p>
<p>P 8.<br />
Despite all thse deplorable Coalition faults and<br />
failures, I ha~ e not been governing and I am not<br />
campaigning win by default. I ask the Australian<br />
people to vote for Labor not because the alternative is<br />
so demonstrably, dreadful, but because we have the ideas.<br />
the properly d'tfined policies and the capacity to lead.<br />
I believe in the people of Australia and therefore I<br />
believe that g,) od sense will be shown on 24 March. And<br />
then my pledge to my fellow Australians is this that<br />
the Government will shoulder the high responsibility<br />
conferred upon it, and will work with all the strength,<br />
determination .~ nd creativity of which only Labor is<br />
capable to achieve the Australian future of hope and<br />
promise which have described. We have the plan to do<br />
it, we have the will to do it, we have the capacity to do<br />
it, we have the' leadership to do it. And we shall. do it<br />
together. Ii. 2-I </p>
