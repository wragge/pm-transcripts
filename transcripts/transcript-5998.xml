PRIME MINISTER WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 26 19 83<br />
ADVANCE AUSTtRALTA BREAKFAST<br />
I think this is a time when we all like to think about what<br />
Australia means to us. It is a time we ought to think about<br />
the problems, but also about the opportunities for 1983.<br />
1 believe that we all understand that there are many<br />
difficulties ahead of us, and share those with countries<br />
right around the world, but at the same time, I believe in<br />
Australia, above all other places, we are determined to<br />
approach those difficulties together in a positive fashion<br />
and determined to make the most of the opportunities that<br />
are clearly available to Australians.<br />
I would like to think that 1983 was the year, or that this<br />
was the Australia Day when Australians determined that they<br />
just can't sit around and wait for the world. There are so<br />
many people who have their eyes cast across the Pacific,<br />
and there they ask when there is going to be an economic<br />
recovery in the United States, because that is important<br />
for us, it means a great deal for our businesses, it means<br />
a great deal for our traders and commodity prices. But<br />
nobody can give a very firm answer about when that particular<br />
recovery is going to occur.<br />
Some of*. the optimists may be right. The United States might<br />
start to move forward through this year, but on the other hand,<br />
predictions of their recovery have been repetitive over the<br />
last two or three years. I would like to believe that<br />
Australiarts are going to determine this year to do what we can<br />
for ourselves to get a larger share of the action, not sit<br />
around and wait for the United States or Europe or anyone<br />
else, but to recognise that it is a difficult world, it is<br />
sometimes a nasty place outside, and just determine to do<br />
things better, to be more competitive, to be more efficient,<br />
to produce what the world wants and to make sure that we get<br />
a bigger share of the action and therefore more opportunities<br />
for Australians.<br />
I believe that we can achieve this because if you ask<br />
Australians whether anyone else can do something better<br />
than an Australian in one field or another, I think most<br />
Australians are prepared to say that we can do things as<br />
well as anyone. We can win the Ashes, we can do well at the<br />
Commonwealth Games. Our scientists, our technologists, our<br />
sportsmen and women, our artists are right up with the best<br />
in the whole world. So, in the competitive world of bus3iness,<br />
there is no reason why we can't do the best in the world also. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I believe government and people perhaps need to examine<br />
some of their attitudes to make sure that we work very<br />
closely together to make sure that we do what is necessary<br />
to make sure that the problems that we share are properl. y<br />
understood so that they can be overcome.<br />
What is happening with Advance Australia over recent times<br />
is something which all Australians are proud of. America's<br />
Cup Challenge is an example of Australians continuingly being<br />
determnined to do what many people, and some still say, is<br />
impossible, but I haven't got the slightest doubt, whether<br />
it is in this particular challenge round or at some future<br />
time, Australia is going to bring that America's Cup back<br />
to this country and then I think the United States might<br />
find it very difficult to take it back to where it has.<br />
been for so long. But again it is an example of Australians<br />
working together.<br />
There are three or four competitors in that America's Cup<br />
here. Once the real challenger is decided for all Australia,<br />
I have not got the slightest doubt that all those c ' ompeting<br />
very firmly for that honour will work together to make sure<br />
that the Australian flag is carried to victory.<br />
I think we all believe that this is the best country in the<br />
world but Australia is only what we all make of it, what<br />
every one of us adds to Australia, by our own actions, every<br />
day as we go through the year.<br />
I would like to wish you all a very happy Australia Day,<br />
and a good, challenging but successful 1983.<br />
