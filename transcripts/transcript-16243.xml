    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will hold its ninth Community Cabinet meeting in Geelong on Sunday 7 December at Corio Bay College.</p>
<p>This will be the first Community Cabinet held by the Australian Government in Victoria.</p>
<p>Geelong MPs Richard Marles and Darren Cheeseman welcomed the announcement as a great opportunity for the community to meet face to face with the Prime Minister and Federal Cabinet Ministers.</p>
<p>Federal Cabinet has met with more than 4000 people in Community Cabinet meetings in 2008 and held more than 500 one-on-one meetings.</p>
<p>The global financial crisis is putting pressure on local families and it's important that they are able to have their say, directly to Government.</p>
<p>The Government has recently announced a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy during a global crisis and help pensioners, carers, working families, Commonwealth Seniors Card Holders, disability pensioners and veterans deal with the economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Community Cabinet is a further opportunity for Federal Cabinet Ministers to hear first hand about the impact of the Global financial crisis on the real economy.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said today;</p>
<p>“Holding Community Cabinet in Geelong is a great opportunity for me and all the Cabinet Ministers to meet with people from Geelong and talk about local issues and discuss what the Federal Government can do better in Geelong.”</p>
<p>Richard Marles the Federal Member for Corio believes;</p>
<p>“Community Cabinet will be a fantastic moment for Geelong. It is the biggest gathering of Federal Government ministers to have happened in Geelong in our history. It comes at a time when Geelong faces many challenges with the changing economic environment. It is a unique opportunity to make our case about Geelong's future to our country's leaders.”</p>
<p>Darren Cheeseman the Federal Member for Corangamite said today;</p>
<p>“It's an honour for our region to be chosen for a Community Cabinet meeting within the first 12 months of a Rudd Labor Government and reflects the importance the Prime Minister is putting on our region. It will be great for the people of Geelong to meet with and talk to all of the Federal Cabinet Minister's and the Prime Minister.”</p>
