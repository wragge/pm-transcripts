TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE HAWKE AND KEATING 4/ 6/ 85<br />
PM: Well ladies and gentlemen, we have no opening statement.<br />
We are ready for your questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why have you surrounded yourself<br />
by flags. Is that to show thaL<br />
PN: It's a great day for Australia. All over?<br />
JOURNALIST: I am a little puzzled by the reference in one of ' vur<br />
papers, Prime Minister, that there be no death duties. I can't<br />
actually reconcile that with a provision for deeming capital gains<br />
be realized at a certain time. That seems to be a tax on a<br />
notional amount.<br />
PM: Well tliat. I a problem in your comprehension. it has got<br />
nothing to do with the facts of the situation. Quite clearly, a<br />
capital gains tax is not a death duty. It varies in so many<br />
ways. The elements of the capital gains tax are that it is not<br />
a tax on the nominal value of the asset in question. It is on the<br />
real value so that the accumulated amount . in the asset "; which<br />
represents inflation is not covered which would be the case in a<br />
death duty. It is in no sense applicable to or describab-e as the<br />
concept of death duties.<br />
JOURNALIST: But by virtue of the deemed realization provision,<br />
you will be taxing estates and gifts?<br />
PM: You won't be<br />
KEATING: But outstanding tax is now paid on an estate, if there<br />
is Lax payable and a capital gains tax is an income ta;: ed as<br />
capiLal. And the monies which are paid now the Commiszioner<br />
of Taxation ha. a call upon the States which you don't call<br />
death duties, so why therefore make the analogy in respect of<br />
a deemed realization on the real gain, as the Prime Minister<br />
indicates. It doesn't qualify for a death duty. A death<br />
duty is levied upon the full value of an estate and, of course,<br />
there is in this, of course, an exemption for residential homes<br />
as " ell. r. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Keating, were you disappointed that after so mi. uch<br />
work, the tax task force was unable to come up with more<br />
positive action on trusts and income splitting. Would the<br />
Government anticipate going on with work in that area to try to<br />
see how that could be dealt with?<br />
KEATING: Look, Michelle, that is a difficult area because the<br />
problem with trusts is that first of all, you have got unit<br />
property trusts which have been built up over a period public<br />
trusts built up over a period of time with set price earning<br />
ratios which would be disturbed by a rove to company taxation<br />
in, any precipitate way. That is the first point. The second<br />
point is, say, on trusts of a private nature, that if we were<br />
to impose outright company tax on trusts, the likelihood is<br />
that those arrangements would shift then to partnerships, and<br />
then you would have to devise a way of taxing partnerships.<br />
And the likelihood is then that one partner would lease ecquipment<br />
to the other partner. And you have got to then devise a<br />
system of taxation to cover that. The other point I think which<br />
that indicates the difficulty. It is not an easy problem. And,<br />
in the case of discretionary trusts the ones I have just<br />
described you will find very quickly changing arra:; ge;. ents to<br />
accommodate the tax. Now, that would be the main point I think<br />
I would like to make about it.<br />
Sorry, there was one further point I was going to mcake. That is,<br />
in respect of uompanies we talk about in here half imputation<br />
and full imputation and we examine the concept of full integration.<br />
Now, if it is, in the view of the public desirable to see full<br />
integration of companies that is, we would be moving down<br />
or imputation of companies we would be moving down the track<br />
where we are going for an outcome in tax treatment of incorporated<br />
arrangements similar to a trust. So before one takes the<br />
position of imposing tax treatments on a trust to try and bring<br />
them back to the company tax arrangements when one is :-using over<br />
changing the company tax arrangements heading Lowards trusts, it<br />
is not just simply a simple matter then to say, well look, the<br />
clear thina to do here is to tax trusts. If it is to be that<br />
we believe and it is not clear this is not the Government's<br />
position, but it is certainly a view put very solidly that the<br />
full integration of companies is.. a desirabie development.<br />
Full integration of companies would accord with the current<br />
tax treatment of trusts. So therefore, one has to be very clear<br />
about one's objectives in going down the trust route in terms of<br />
the company tax treatment. So, we have left open the possibilities<br />
there of half imputation, full imputation, and integration.<br />
And those issues, 1 . think, are important in de. trmining what the<br />
long run focus of tax treatment trusts should be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does the Government have an estimate of whether or<br />
by how much the public service i. e. the Taxation Depart. ent<br />
would have to be increased to implement the various asoects of the<br />
preferred option? 1 1* 1, 1 </p>
<p>PM: Well a calculation has been made as to the net cost<br />
of the administration of abolishing the wholesale tax and<br />
then bringing in the new broad-based consumption tax.<br />
And the estimate, I think, Paul, and I say this subject to<br />
question, is the net additional cost of the order of $ 80 million.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any extra staff in the Tax Department to<br />
implement KEATING: Oh yes, there would need to be extra people.<br />
JOURNALIST: How many?<br />
KEATING: I'm not s'ure of the number, Wal, but there would be<br />
a lot of extra people if you let the tax evasion and avoidance<br />
industry go on. Simply, we put another 700 on last year on<br />
compliance only because this package represents a fairly<br />
substantial salt upon the instruments of avoidance and evasion.<br />
The savings there in compliance staff offset against firstly,<br />
the losses of staff which would be part and parcel of the<br />
winding up of the wholesale sales tax system. And the additional<br />
staff to operate a consumption tax at the retail level would be<br />
significant, but it has to, I think, be viewed against what the<br />
tax system would otherwise need to try and keep the income base<br />
in some sort of repair.<br />
JOURNALIST: the package is implemented, Prime Minister, does<br />
the Government believe that the next logical step is a system<br />
of taxation indexation in order to ensure that the benefits,<br />
particulaly in the lower marginal tax rates, are in fact<br />
preserved and not eroded over time.<br />
PM: The White Paper makes the point that once you have made<br />
the tax reform the substantial tax reform that that is the<br />
logical next step.<br />
JOURNALIST: And I take it, the Government accepts that, does it?<br />
PM: I believe so, yes. When I say I believe so, I am saying<br />
that in the sense of our general position as government. You<br />
see, we have made it clear from the beginning in the enunciation<br />
of the nine principles that we are not putting a position of<br />
take it or leave it. We are seriously saying to the community<br />
as you will see from the last paragraph we want all the<br />
options, including the preferred option, to be tested. And on<br />
the basis of the preferred option being acceptable broadly across<br />
the community then, the Government, I believe, would say that<br />
that is what logically follows. I </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Keating the Treasury estimates of revenue<br />
collections have notoriously been inaccurate. The provisional<br />
tax estimates for tbLs year is an example in point. When you<br />
are putting figures on what could be collected from fringe<br />
benefits particularly, if they do run under the mark what is<br />
going to happen to the income tax cuts. Are you still going<br />
to work at a zero sum or are you going to set a bigger deficit?<br />
KEATING: Well Mungo, let me just make the point. It is<br />
true we have a discrepancy in the provisional tax outcome<br />
this year. That has arisen, not because of the Treasury's<br />
estimates of income it'nich it has the peculiar and sole<br />
responsibility of estimating but of other estimations by<br />
other agencies about the likely buildup of equipment on farms<br />
etc. Now the point is they've got to be right, no matter<br />
who does them. I take the responsibility for them as<br />
Treasurer. And I take responsibility for these numbers.<br />
But I don't think that given the fact that the Treasury<br />
picked the turnaround in the economy in 1983/ 84, broadly<br />
picked inflation and employmcnt estimates, employment growth<br />
for numbers outcomes in the las-couple of years. I think<br />
their estimating has been pretty good considering the swings<br />
and the magnitude of the swings in the economy. Now on this<br />
particular measure I don't think there's anything in the<br />
Treasury been through greater scrutiny than these numbers.<br />
And on a lot of those numbers we've taken the conservative<br />
i estimate. And I think the conservatizve estimate also applies<br />
in respect of fringe benefits. The fringe benefit assessment<br />
at seven hui: dred million dollars it would effect, if it were<br />
wildly astray, it would effect the figuring. But on a sum<br />
of that magnitude even a modest change would not dramatically<br />
effect the potential for the tax cuts on a revenue neutral<br />
basis. JOURNALIST: The point that I'm trying to make is that there i;<br />
still a very big tax avoidance industry, there are a lot of<br />
tax cuts and a lot of lawyers around, who are going to be as<br />
from this morning, trying to work out ways to drive a train<br />
through anything that you pau up<br />
PM: If not a cart.<br />
JOUJ-' ALIST: OK, try and knock your cart over by a train, if you like.<br />
KEATING: Well lock basically we think the estimates<br />
are firm. They hany together. They would provide tax cuts<br />
of the orders we specify in the document, and it is on<br />
S. a revenue neutral basis. Now there is of course a potential<br />
for some of the brace broadea; nj measures to produce higher<br />
out year earnings, and those earnings would be subject to<br />
Cabinet's approval I,' m sure, as part of the tax relief.<br />
So we're talking about the second full year of the second<br />
year of these measures operating in terms of that revenue<br />
buildup. And on those bases those figures hang together and 4<br />
tax cuts of those orders are appropriate on a revenue neutral<br />
i basis. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke the Opposition leader has refused<br />
to say whether the Opposition will allow legislation to<br />
implement Option C, through the Senate. How do y., u feel<br />
about fighting an election based on that factor?<br />
PM: Well I feel confident. I go back, Laurie to<br />
what I've been saying consistently on this. When we<br />
started this process tax reform during the last election<br />
campaign toe set cut the nine principles. The ninth<br />
principle was that any tax reform would need broad support<br />
in the coin:.-unity. We believe strongly that during the process<br />
of public debate and discussion, leading up to and at the<br />
Summit, w, will get that broad support because the benefits<br />
of this tax reform, I believe, will be so obvious. If the<br />
Government makes t! h judgement, which I believe we'llbable<br />
to, that we have that supportthen we will put it to the<br />
Parliament. Its going to be a very heavy obligation, I believe,<br />
upon the Parliament to recognise the ill of the community.<br />
You talk about the attitude of the Oppos-ition, I think its<br />
been best summed up by one well known radio cormm: entator this<br />
morning wno said " here they go again, negatije, obstructionist<br />
unprepared to look at the package as a whole". I believe<br />
if they do that they w. ill pay a heavy price. We are prepared<br />
to face up to these hard issues. We've done it in the areas<br />
where they refused to in the past. I've listed them before,<br />
hey did ith-work on the deregulation of the financial i., arket.<br />
They knew \., hat ought to be done, but then they wouldn't mTrKe<br />
the hard decision because they thought there might be some<br />
difficulty. Same thing in the dollar float. Same thing in<br />
the entry of foreign banks. They would never face up to the<br />
decisions that needed to be taken to protect and advance the<br />
interest of the Australian community. If they try and go<br />
down that track again of saying yes well we recognise that<br />
these things ought to be done but we're going to try and take<br />
some political advantage out of a particular point. We're<br />
prepared to fight them on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean an election sir if its blocked<br />
in the Senate.<br />
PM: Well I'm not going to the point now of answering<br />
that hypothetical question. What I'm saying is that we've<br />
discharged our obligation, we'll.. go to the Summit. Our<br />
responsibility, our first responsibility'-discharged. Our<br />
second one now is to get the response of the Australian<br />
community. Then we will seek to give effect to that. Now<br />
I am optimistic that, particularly with the involvement<br />
of the Demccrats, who are at lecst accepting their<br />
responsibility to comne to the Summit, -o listen to what<br />
the community has got to say. lCfhc@ see that there is a<br />
broad support for this we'll get that support reflected<br />
in the P&amp; rliament. I am not going to address myself to<br />
the hypothetical questions of refusal by the Parliament to<br />
reflect the desire of the community. We'll deal with that<br />
if it arises. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Ir Iiawke do you think that the ACTU will be<br />
able to resist the tax cuts inherent in Option C, and<br />
if not when do ynu think they're going to give their approval.<br />
PM: Well as I understand the position it's this<br />
Greg. Paul has had extensive discussions with the ACTU, as<br />
he has had with the business community. The understanding<br />
that he has and which he's conveyed to me and the Cabinet,<br />
is that they will go to the Ta&gt;: Summit with their options<br />
open. Ihey will not close their mind to a package which<br />
involves the broad based consumption tax. P.. id essential in<br />
the understanding of your question, I know you understand<br />
it, is that the only way you can get the very substantial<br />
direct tax cuts about 30% the level of , verage weekly<br />
earnings is through the broad based consumpcion tax route.<br />
Now the ficures are stark, they're clear at the level of<br />
average weekly earnings there would be a thirty one dollar<br />
a week cut, for the average weekly earner. That's thirty<br />
one dollars a week more he or she has in tiJ: pay packet.<br />
The cost of the broad based consumption tax approximately<br />
sixteen dollars eighty. Net gain, therefore, of just over<br />
fourteen dollars a week to tnat average earner. Now they<br />
know now and they will know even more clearly by the ti-.<br />
the Summit's finished that it's only by preferred option that<br />
they can get that benefit. They will also know that in that<br />
process. that the lower income people in the community and<br />
those not on direct incomes, but relying on social welfare<br />
payments will be more than protected. Now its our judgement<br />
that as those things become clear to the Trade Union leadership<br />
and their members that they will see that that is an<br />
appropriate path to go. Now as to when they make that<br />
decision, I think the indications are they're imoving that<br />
way. They go to the Summit with an open mind, and I beli. eve<br />
that relatively shortly after the Su-mit, that good sense<br />
would indicate to them that that's the way to go.<br />
JOURNALIST: But will they accept discounting, Praime Minister?<br />
PM: Let me make it clear as we did in principle<br />
seven, of the nine principles. That that is an essential<br />
element. This has got to be clefir. y understood. Let it be<br />
clear from day one of this debate. We will not; 3ou could<br />
not, simply have a situation w. here wage and salary earners<br />
get these substantial benefits, the thirty dollars a week,<br />
which come from the increase in revenue associated with the<br />
broad based cnsumption tax -get that benefit which in<br />
net terms, as I say, at the level of average weekly earnings<br />
is fourteen dollars a week and then say, we grab that<br />
thank you very much. Put we're now going to double dip and<br />
not accept discounting'" wages. That is not on and it was<br />
made clear in principle seven that it was not on.<br />
JOURNALIST: A fist full of dollars perhaps Prime Minister? </p>
<p>PM: No the difference between the fist full of<br />
dollars that's in your mird of 1977-that you had a weak<br />
gutless deceptive governeicnt then, that deliberately deluded<br />
the Australian electorate. Weint into an election and said<br />
there's your fist full of dollars and then within five months<br />
grabbed them back. The distinction is that we have laid<br />
out entirely, and honestly all the implications rhat's<br />
involved in net benefit terms, and the bringing into effect<br />
of that pack: age will be as a result of full and nonest<br />
consultation with the Australian electorate. They with<br />
uswill be making the decision. They, w ith usI think will<br />
adhere to the decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: Whose preferred option is the preferred option?<br />
This morning the ' rcasurer told us that our Cabinet will<br />
support the decision of Cabinet as you've always done. Last<br />
night only Senator Walsh came up with rather a different<br />
preferred option. Does this mea. n we'll get a number of<br />
Senator alsh's preferred options between now and the<br />
Summit cr will we not.<br />
PM: We have outlayed in the Paper a number of<br />
options. T Cabinet las made it clear that Paul Keating and<br />
I, and others who speak on this issue now have the authority<br />
of the Government to put as the preferred option the-one<br />
which is designated in the White Paper. That is the waya<br />
the debate will be conducted between now and the Summit and<br />
at the Summit. I make it clear that as you see in the final<br />
paL graph of the White Paper, we're not saying there it is.<br />
its all closed, you can't talk about anything else, to the<br />
community. We are saying to the community we want you to<br />
test all the options, including the preferred option.<br />
And its our firm belief that a fair analysis of that<br />
preferred option, which is a total package, will lead to its<br />
acceptance. And its not going to be any good in this debate<br />
someone getting up and saying well look there's a bit of<br />
the package I don't like. Because there will be bits of<br />
the package that some people won't like. The obligation<br />
upon everyone in the community now is to look at the<br />
package as a whole, and see whether the community as a<br />
whole benefits from the implementation of the package as a<br />
whole. JOURNALIST: If certain groups do pick out sectionwhich<br />
they don't like, is it then worth assuming that Option<br />
B, given the fact that the White Paper says that it mayE not<br />
be worth going down that route, given the fairly small gain. for a lai<br />
upheaval in the tax Is is not worth going down that route, if there<br />
are problems with Option C.<br />
PM: Wel1 we've made it quite clear that we want<br />
all the options examined. We would say now, if ouL of the<br />
Summit, and the processes leading to the Summityou were<br />
to get a position where there was a clear majority view in<br />
the cormmunity-' that they did; n't want to go down the<br />
preferred option package, then the Government would obviously<br />
have to take account of it. That's what principle nine<br />
says. But the task that faces, particularly Paul and myself </p>
<p>now, cs having the main car-iaze of this matter, is to try and<br />
get the community to see the benefits of the preferred option.<br />
And let me make it clear that you've got to get, and I hope<br />
the Australian Community will see this, they've got to get<br />
their time scales right on this. There's no point in just<br />
looking at this today and say well look, there might be<br />
a bit of a problem about one element of this. As I've said<br />
recently on a number of programmes, we could slide through<br />
today and tomorrow, with this tax system that we've got, and<br />
without a fundamental reform of it. But the future generations<br />
of Australians will pay a very heavy price if having now<br />
fully exposed the haemorrhaging of the revenue base of this<br />
country they say well we're not really going to deal with that.<br />
Because the inevitable result of that soft option, if you like,<br />
of saying we won't really have a thorough going review, is<br />
that the ordinary Australian man and woman, and their<br />
dependants are the ones who will pay more and more, as they<br />
have been over recent years.<br />
KEATING: Can I just add a point to that, in respect to<br />
the 46% rate, and I think this needs to be well understood.<br />
That where we got near the 46 rate in the seventies, the<br />
Labor Government of the day broadened the base of the income<br />
base under the treasurership of Bill Hayden. And that 46%<br />
area was then moved away from average weekly earnings.<br />
Its with the dramatic inflation through the seventies has<br />
started to come back. And about the time it was starting<br />
to impact again, the Fraser Government discovered Bass Strait.<br />
And so again revenue was used to keep average weekly earners<br />
out of the 46% area. It was then moving back to the 46%<br />
area when the Fraser Government gave a tax cut in 1982/ 83<br />
which the budget could not afford and left us with a massive<br />
public deficit. But despite that tax cut, its in the 46%<br />
area now. But there isn't a Bass Strait this time. There<br />
can't be any irresponsible blowout of deficits of a fiscal<br />
deterioration of the kind we had in 1982/ 83. And now<br />
Australia faces a clear choice-+ hat it either does something<br />
about the high marginal rates impacting on average weekly<br />
earnings and finds another base in the tax system or it<br />
doesn't. Because the three billion of new revenue which<br />
Bass Strait provided, or the base broadening which was<br />
provided back in the seventies, is only in part available<br />
now and as far as Bass Strait is concerned is running down.<br />
We've got the company base being eroded by five three<br />
depreciation. The excisers in a position where they can't<br />
contribute very much more to revenue. And if there isn't<br />
some offsetting of these very high marginal rates on" narrow<br />
income base, in another base in the tax system. Well what's<br />
going to happen is what the Prime Minister described. Low<br />
and average income earners are going to be suffering a<br />
high proportion of their extra earnings being lost at that<br />
rate.<br />
PM: Can I just add the statistics so that you really<br />
understand clearly the dimension of this. As of today 39% of<br />
full time earners are at the 46 cents marginal rate. Within<br />
three years that will be far in excess of 50%. There'll be<br />
three million out of the five and a half million full-time<br />
earners. Now we believe that t. e overwhelming majority </p>
<p>of Australians are simply saying its not tenable to go on to<br />
a situation where that extra dollar is going to be eroded to<br />
the extent of half of it by tax. Now you can't substantially<br />
deal with that problem, we believe, other than with the sort<br />
of reform we're talking about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you saying that Option C is a<br />
discrete package and that elements of it are not negotiable.<br />
PM: No I'm not saying that. With respect, Greg,<br />
you could not have listened to what I said a while ago. We<br />
have we believe, accepLed the primary obligation upon government<br />
to these things. To expose the inadequacies of the existing<br />
system. Its lack of simplicity. Its lack of fairness. Its<br />
lack of economic efficiency. Then we've gone through the<br />
stages of saying the things that can be done. The broadening<br />
of the direct tax base. Some actions that can be taken by<br />
moving in regard to the wholesale tax, and perhaps some<br />
level of broad based consumption tax. And have gone through<br />
to the final preferred option. Now we have said, and I repeat<br />
here again, as I've said earlier in this conference, that<br />
we have the obligation of trying to persuade the Australian<br />
people that going that route is the one most likely to<br />
produce a system that will last in terms of fairness and<br />
simplicity, and efficiency. Now if despite our best endea-vurs<br />
of exposition you reach a position where the community is<br />
not prepared to accept that route, then as a Government we<br />
will have to see what elements of reform can be put together<br />
to improve the system. But we have said that on the best<br />
evidence available to us that preferred option, if all the<br />
difficulties can be overcome, is the one most likely to<br />
produce those results. I want to say this, as I've said in<br />
another programme, but its fair to Paul 1Keating that this be<br />
said, as well as to the Government as a'whole. Its not a<br />
question of saying we want to steamroller something through<br />
for some ideological or perceptual reason. We recognise the<br />
difficulties that are involved. Clearly if you have a<br />
broad based consumption tax, then prima facie, that will<br />
be regressive and have an adverse impact upon lower income<br />
people, and particularly upon Social Welfare beneficiaries.<br />
What we've done by dedicating just under two billion dollars<br />
to compensation is to say we believe that we have overcome<br />
those problems. Now its for the community up to and at the<br />
Summit to test whether they are satisfied that those problems<br />
have been overcome. If the community were not satisfied<br />
then we would have to face up to that and see what other<br />
combination of reforms would be possible. But its cur belief<br />
at this time that you will not most effec-ively overcome<br />
the weaknesses of the existing system, and get into place<br />
something that as a community we can be sure of into the<br />
future, other than by that route.<br />
JOURNALIST: What will the Government do to restrict or<br />
reduce fringe benefits to p ople on its ow . n payroll? </p>

we own thiat. I mean this whole question of no intCer-o. ernmeLL<br />
transfers of funds is nonsense. And thiere's a demonstrz. ruic,-<br />
effect, and. the fact that theore s " account-+-abilityr there cLi<br />
is important.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the question of fringe benefits. Yuv<br />
got a new poncnipie coming in! tr. That a tax payable by oneo<br />
section of the comimiunity of those receiving t.! he bellef its<br />
actually has to be paid by their employers byv another<br />
section of the coum,-,, nity. 1, here dJ-that idea come from,<br />
is it som-thing that th1e ACTU wantcd.<br />
PM: Well let me say i-wo thinus about that<br />
let me get rid of that l~ ast ,; nide question or observation<br />
that i-ts something that the AC'U Let me ma'Ke it clear<br />
that in this whole approac: h to tax reform its the Government<br />
which has accepted the obligation of outlining the approach<br />
as to what is necessary to produce, as I say a frairer.<br />
simpler more efficient system. Vie have accepted our<br />
obligation in discharging the primary obligation upon us'<br />
to talk with the Trade Union movement, to tall, witCh the<br />
business community. Our w~ hola! thinking has been in-tormed<br />
by information fromn a range of sources, within arnd outside<br />
Australia. Specifically on the question you asked, our<br />
colleagues in New Zealandl have hrought in the conce,: t_ of<br />
fringc benefits being taxed in the hands of the employers.<br />
And it has seemed to have beeni acceptc: 1 as a sensible<br />
approach there. row we believe that out of the discussion<br />
that will take place leading up to the Summait and at it.,<br />
that that wil]. be accepted as an appropriate way of<br />
aoprcarhi-ncj this. But as on all parts of the package<br />
that's sot. jething on which vwan. to hear views from<br />
the business co7. itu-ity and frmth rade uniors and fruin<br />
others. JOURNALIST: Most of the oosition criticis-m today has<br />
come in re-lation to Option A.<br />
PM: Is this froin Mr Howard Mr -Poacock, becausothey<br />
have different viewvs on the whole question.<br />
JOURNALIS-JWOUeRlNl LItShT: i s is in particu~ ar from Mr J. ezicocK. </p>
<p>11.<br />
PM: Ar Peacock, well that'll have less authority,<br />
yer-, JOURNALIST: He's focussed his criticism on Option A, which<br />
is the broadening of the direct tax base. To what extent does<br />
the Government believe that this broadening of the direct<br />
tax base is non-negotiable as a precondition to switching<br />
to a broad. y based indirect tax.<br />
PM: I have two things to say about it. I repeat<br />
what I've said before, and it is important I have to keep<br />
saying it. That we are not going to h--e Australian<br />
community and say there it is, we've made up our -mind and<br />
we're just going through a charade. e.' e want to hear what<br />
they've got to say about all parts of the options we present.<br />
And the broadening of the tax base, as you will appreciate<br />
is common to all the options. But we want to hear w. hat<br />
people have got to say about it. We believe that when you<br />
look at it you've got to try and get the situation in this<br />
country where those who are not paying tax, either through<br />
evasion, or avoidance, pay a greater contribution to the<br />
common revenue than they are now. No;; if Mr Peacock, who<br />
really after all as know is not an authority on matters<br />
economic or fiscal, if he is saying izs not proper to take<br />
steps to limit evasion and avoidance, well r. hat's the bed<br />
he can make up and lie in it. Its belief tnat one of<br />
the reascns we are ir government, and he is where he is<br />
and where he'll continue to be, is that his party hcs been<br />
traditionally the one which has not only been soft on ta::<br />
avoidance and evasion, but las deliberately created the<br />
conditions in which tax avoidance and evasion has been<br />
able to explode in this country. He wants to take a<br />
position in this tax debate that he wants further to facilitate<br />
evasion and avoidance, let him make that bed and lie on it.<br />
KEATING: Can I just add that Bob, with a caveat which<br />
the Prime Minister's just given. I think you need io see this<br />
package in terms of carrots an-. sticks. And the carrots<br />
are reductions in marginal rates. Obviously if we have a<br />
marginal rate of 10' there will be no propensity or little<br />
propensity to avoid. If you have a marginal rate of 90 there<br />
would be every propensity to avoid, to the extent that you<br />
bring marginal rates down you bring down the propensity to<br />
avoid. In terms of the instruments of avoidance and evasion<br />
the sticks, we have the penalties which were introduced in<br />
the latter parL of last year, . hich have dramatically lifted<br />
the cost to people who wish to undertake avoidance activity.<br />
But as the paper schere-s have been effectively, and are<br />
being effectively dealt with obviously high income taxpayers<br />
are going to move into the shelters, as they are<br />
doing. And if we were to say at the end of this whole<br />
exercise, well look the tax shelters are just too hard to<br />
touch, then you would just have elective taxation in this<br />
country. You would have people deciding whether they would<br />
pay tax by the exploitation of the shelters. Now if<br />
Mr Peacock wants to line up with that sort of a tax system<br />
well let hi; do so. But as far as we're concerned what<br />
we're saying is that there has to be some change. It is<br />
6 </p>
<p>the Liberals primarily who allowed the inflation to run through<br />
the scales in the seventies. It is the Liberals who dragge<br />
the tax system into disrepute by their fa: ilure to do anything<br />
about the bottom of the harbour, and the outright evasion<br />
paper schemes of that period. And it is this disiepute, it is<br />
this non-compliance with the system, the state of mind which<br />
is part of the problem that we're now dealing with. And that's<br />
why it has to be approached in terms of broadening the base.<br />
Moving away pushing out removing the availability of<br />
the instruments of avoidance and minimisation as well as<br />
penalties. But at the same time saying we will reduce<br />
marginal tax rates, we'll reduce the incentive to go into<br />
those schemes. Now there is a view around that once the<br />
loss of innocnce has occurred, that people continue to<br />
develop tax avoidance schemes, that argument has some force.<br />
It has more force if the Government leaves the instruments<br />
available in the system. That's why the base broadening<br />
measures are important in terms of the content of the paper.<br />
They add to the equity and fairness of the proposal.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr ! lawke the Prime Minister gets substantial<br />
fringe benefits. They get the use of the Lodge, Kirribilli<br />
House, they get the use of Cl the VIP plane fleet. Who would<br />
pay tax on those and how much would it be.<br />
PM: I don't know how much it would be but I simply<br />
want to make this point. That what I'm about, and certiainly<br />
what Paul Keating's about, in this exercise is not to have<br />
a situation in which I as Primn-. Minister will derive any<br />
special benefits out of the Tax Reform. The principles that<br />
apply to the community generally should apply to me. And I<br />
want to make it quite clear that I will not be seeking any<br />
special benefits. And I will ensure that at the end of the<br />
road I receive none. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: But by applying this principle doesn't it mean t: Ca.<br />
the taxpayer will then be paying the tax? Really paying doucle<br />
for the Lodge and Cl?<br />
THE TREASURER: Well that's like us paying Telecom.<br />
PM: We went to the point about paying Telecom. I'm simply saying<br />
in the area in which I could be a direct beneficiary out of lower<br />
tax rates, that's not what I'm about and I can assure you I will<br />
not be seeking to be a beneficiary in the result.<br />
JOURNALIST: During the last election campaign you talked about<br />
the desirability of withdrawing the Income Tax Assessment Act in<br />
the interests of simplicity. Do you think that given that one of<br />
the major features of the White Paper is simplicity, and you have<br />
just talked about simplicity, is that really possible now to<br />
withdraw the Income Tax Assessment Act and start all over again?<br />
PM: Well. of course, how the Government will give effect in<br />
legislative terms to the package upon which it decides will be a<br />
matter for serious consideration by the Cabinet on the advice of<br />
the Treasurer. And at this stace of the debate it's not open to<br />
me to say precisely how that will be done. I make this point, and<br />
I'm sure Paul would want to add to it, that from the beginnir: n we<br />
have emphasised our desire, as well as getting a more equitable,<br />
fairer system and a more efficient system, wp also want to make it<br />
simpler. Now the ways in which that will be done will be on the<br />
basis, as I say, of the advice to us from the reasurer. I am<br />
sure that in the result the tax system will be fai-er and simpler.<br />
Paul, I don't know whether you want to add to Lhat.<br />
THE TREASURER: I would just add to those remarks in those terms.<br />
I think an adoption of a proposal around the theme would seem<br />
would certainly produce a fairer, a more simpler and more<br />
efficient tax system. And that is the objective. Now it may be<br />
that one could take the view that what we ought to do is rip up<br />
the book and start again. But I don't know where in practical<br />
terms that would lead you in terms of the kind of legislative<br />
approach or change the tax system. Any progressive tax system<br />
will always have an incentive for people to minimise their tax at<br />
higher levels of marginal rates and invariably a lot of the pot<br />
hole filling and changes, amendments have been made over the<br />
period arise from that. Now my Party believes, as I believe, and<br />
the Prime Minister believes that a progressive scale is<br />
appropriate and therefore with that progressive scale I think we<br />
have in this proposal done what is reasonable in these<br />
circumstances to make the system fairer and more simple.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I just ask you just a follow; up question to that<br />
Mr Keating. One of tie great gaps in the Tax Act is that there is<br />
no definition of income. Given that you are now looking possibly<br />
at introducing a Capital Gainn Tax and you've introduced an assets<br />
test would you consider writing into the Tax Act some definiticn<br />
of income paying to include capital? </p>
<p>THE TREASUR'ER: Well Andrew, there's always been a simple notion<br />
that by the flick of a pen you can solve all of the avoidance,<br />
evasion problems by so called : edefinitions of ir. come. Thats<br />
never been a view that the Treasu-y has aver put to me with any<br />
force. And while with the Capitdl Gains Tax the system would be<br />
far more complete and may leave the prospect for some change in<br />
definition, it's not something we contemplate in this paper. And<br />
I couldn't really give you an answer to that without taking<br />
advice.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister to get back to constitutional basics,<br />
the Governments option are Ministers' bound to prefer the<br />
option. Therefore will Senator Walsh be supporting the preferred<br />
option from now on or will you abandon the Westminister principal<br />
of Ministerial solidarity in respect to tax reformation?<br />
PM: I don't accept that you have letters back to constitutional<br />
basics but I will simply say this, that the Cabinet has made the<br />
decision which is reflected in the White Paper and that is that<br />
the preferred option is clearly there. I would expect to receive<br />
the support of all members of the ministry in that respect.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Keating, while your talking about Senator Walsh.<br />
He seems to dispute your argument about the effect of the 60 cent<br />
marginal rate to encourage avoidance saying that he doenn't think<br />
a cut in that rate would help combat avoidance. Would you care to<br />
comment on that?<br />
THE TREASURER: Well, I gave an example earlier. If you had a<br />
marginal rate of 90' the propensity to avoid would be increased.<br />
If you had a marginal rate of 10%, it would be reduced. And any<br />
movement up or down changes that propensity. JOURNALIST: So you<br />
think he's just wrong? THE TREASURER: I didn't see the point he<br />
made, to be honest Michelle. And so I can't say that he is. But<br />
that is my view and that is, I think, coupled with the other<br />
things removing the avenues, lifting the penalties and se'eing a<br />
change of this kind introduced will do a lot to damage the<br />
psychology of non-compliance. And I think that's the important<br />
thing. The psychology of avoidance and minimisation whijh, in my<br />
view has been no doubt occasion by the compression of the scales.<br />
I mean the point is, if you go back to the 60% rate, well go back<br />
to $ 35,000 where the 60% rate now comes in 1.6 times average<br />
weekly earnings. In the 1950s that group contributed 52% of the<br />
earnings of the personal income tax system. Today they contribute<br />
21. And I think that in itself stands as at some testinony to the<br />
fact that if you compress the rates and lift the taxes you may<br />
think you've got a progressive tax systen You only have a<br />
progressive tax system while you've got compliance. And while<br />
nominally you have a progressive tax system you don't have it<br />
because you don't have'compliance. The 60% rate cost $ 400m. We<br />
earn $ 400m from it out of $ 30,000m, which is a commentary in<br />
itself upon the compliance of the 60% level. So there's no doubt<br />
in my mind that hioh marginal rates have had E very severe im. pact<br />
upon the propensity to avoid. And I think any objective analysis<br />
would lead anyone to that conclusion. </p>
<p>J OU RNX I ST: M r 1' o,' tiriq i. L he Covernment f inal ly. d,: c i d es to<br />

the sta* rting 6( sate of such a new tax shonld be aheF-d of 1. he -3ssage<br />

TH1E TREASUREI Well, John, we'd like to see how the packac,<br />
first of all, is received publicly, how it is recaived Iby the<br />
Summ,-i t. And T think that in the post-summit consideratio of all<br />
of these issues by the Governnieit that kind of issue Could the0-n<br />
appropriately be reattended to.<br />
JOURNALITST: You would be worried about people azrarCi nq therc<br />
affairs before hand.<br />
T HE T RE AS URER: Well, let me say this, with any of these measures,<br />
any notice provides tFaxpayers with a benefit they w.. ouldn't<br />
otherw. ise have in thle normal course of a budget. But this is not<br />
about budgetary changes. This Is -a major proposal for reform . f<br />
the tax system. And because of the difficulties of insLitutional<br />
reform in this country, and the Government's beliefl that we nLeed a<br />
proce-ss of consultation to make the reform possible, then, I think<br />
that's simply one of the problems one has to live . with in this<br />
kind of reform chance. I don't think, I mecan, surely this country<br />
has been t1-alking abou) t the prospect of capital gains taxes now for<br />
four yeacs, and if anybody needed to, as you say,. arranging their<br />
affairs, thcv w. ould have certainly been, daimo th--t-for a . lo:, ri<br />
time. I don't think that the evidenc e of it in this document is<br />
going to changje public perceptions all that much.<br />
JOURNALIST: As the employer have you worked out how mu, 7h the<br />
Commonwealth Is likely to be up for in the tax?<br />
PM: No I haven't. I don't know whether Paul has.<br />
THE TREASURER: 700m across the nation, say, if you work it back.<br />
It's hardly anything that's going to debilitate fiscal policy.<br />
JO0U R N A LA'ST: Mr K( eating, did your Department have a look at the<br />
compensation of incomes in the threshliold? Preparing of facts?<br />
THE ' TfEASUnEfl: Yes, the threshol. d has been increasad to provide<br />
full compensatien fo: everybody above the threshhold. And that<br />
provides full compensation for taxbayers above the threshhold and<br />
below),. the threshhold. Bel~ ow the threshhold people are in thle<br />
Social Security systri. ni. They are, over compensated crd: these<br />
arrangements. </p>
