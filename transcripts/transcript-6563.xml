CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIM AUMAIAISTE<br />
PRINCE PHILLIP PRIZE FOR AUSTRALIAN DESIGN 1984<br />
SYDNEY 28 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
I HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN BEING HERE TODAY FOR THE<br />
PRESENTATION OF THE PRINCE PHILIP PRIZE FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />
DESIGN 198' 4.<br />
QUALITY IN DESIGN IS CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING EFFICIENT,<br />
COMPETITIVE AND GROWING AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES.<br />
ONLY IF WE HAVE SUCH INDUSTRIES CAN WE HOPE TO CAPTURE AND)<br />
HOLD NEW MARKETS BOTH HERE AND ABROAD. THIS IS ESSENTIAL<br />
IF WE ARE TO ACHIEVE THE NEW JOBS AND THE HIGHER LIVING<br />
STANDARDS WE ALL WISH TO SEE.<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT HAS RESTORED STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY NOW THE STRONGEST OF ANY<br />
INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY.<br />
TO HELP PROMOTE GROWTH WE HAVE FORMULATED SPECIFIC<br />
COUNTRY " ACTION PLANS" TO TARGET PARTICULAR MARKETS FOR<br />
EXPORT EXPANSION. BUT WE MUST HAVE THE RIGHT PRODUCTS TO<br />
SELL. AND TO COMPETE ON WORLD MARKETS OUR PRODUCTS MUST BE<br />
BETTER THAN THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.<br />
WHILE COMPETITIVE PRICING IS IMPORTANT, THE SCOPE FOR OUR<br />
INDUSTRIES TO GAIN NEW MARKETS BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY,<br />
WELL DESIGNED AND ENGINEERED PRODUCTS IS TOO OFTEN<br />
UNDER-ESTIMATED.' </p>
<p>2.<br />
I KNOW THAT AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY HAS THE CAPACITY TO<br />
PRODUCE GOODS THAT ARE EQUAL TO, OR BETTER THAN, THOSE<br />
OF OUR COMPETITORS.<br />
BUT BOTH AT HOME AND OVERSEAS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT<br />
" AUSTRALIAN-MADE" IS SYNONOMOUS WITH SUPERIOR DESIGN AND<br />
QUALITY$ THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT CAN ACT AS A CATALYST IN THE<br />
ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS OBJECTIVE.<br />
-IN MY RECENT POLICY SPEECH I ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION<br />
UPON RE-ELECTION TO PROVIDE 150 PER CENT TAX WRITE-OFF<br />
OF ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES IN THE AREA OF RESEARCH<br />
AND DEVELOPMENTS<br />
-WE HAVE PROVIDED UP TO $ 150 MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS FOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN DESIGN AND RESEARCH IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE<br />
INDUSTRY.<br />
-WE HAVE PROVIDED $ 190,000 IN 1984/ 85 FOR THE INDUSTRIAL<br />
DESIGN COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA TO ASSIST IT PROMOTE<br />
INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITY AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
GOOD DESIGNS<br />
HOWEVERi THE BOTTOM LINE WHICH WE SHOULD NEVER LOSE<br />
SIGHT OF IS THE NEED FOR INNOVATIVE AND IMAGINATIVE<br />
PRODUCTS. a 3/ U </p>
<p>AWARDS SUCH AS THE PRINCE PHILIP PRIZE HIGHLIGHT THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IN THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF NEW PRODUCTS.<br />
THESE AWARDS DIRECT ATTENTION TO THE BENEFITS TO BE<br />
DERIVED FROM EFFICIENT INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND INCREASE<br />
AWARENESS OF THE ROLE DESIGN HAS TO PLAY IN THE<br />
SUCCESSFUL MARKETING OF AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTS.<br />
MANY OF THE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AWARDS, EITHER<br />
AS FINALISTS OR PRIZE WINNERS, HAVE BENEFITTED CONSIDERABLY<br />
FROM THE PUBLICITY FLOWING FROM THIS COMPETITION.<br />
THE COUNCIL IS TO BE COMMENDED ON ITS WINNING FORMULA.<br />
THEIR PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS NOT ONLY ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY'S<br />
AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD DESIGN, THEY ALSO<br />
HELP SELL THE PRODUCTS WHICH IN TURN, ALLOWS AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRY TO GROW TO THE BENEFIT OF US ALL.<br />
I KNOW I SPEAK FOR ALL OF YOU IN EXTENDING MY HEARTIEST<br />
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL WINNERS. </p>
