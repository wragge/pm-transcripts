<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  John Howard, no doubt you've seen the pro-republican ad that shows President</p>
<p>   Clinton standing alongside you as he toasts the Queen of Australia. How</p>
<p>   did you feel standing alongside him as he proposed that toast and you drank</p>
<p>   to it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't think I gave much thought to it. I was more interested in</p>
<p>   what I was about to say in my speech of welcome. And, in any event, that</p>
<p>   particular toast has subsequently graduated to the Queen and the people</p>
<p>   of Australia which has been the toast used at Government House now, I think,</p>
<p>   for about 18 months and used more typically now at similar functions. But</p>
<p>   I've got to say, I didn't give a lot of thought to it. I was, frankly, more</p>
<p>   concerned about what I was going to say to the President in my speech, to</p>
<p>   be quite honest.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  I suppose, though, the question is what he thought about it as the most</p>
<p>   powerful, most influential political leader in the world.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't think it really matters on this issue, Kerry, what others think.</p>
<p>   It's a question of what Australians think. I mean.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Isn't it also a question of other people's perception of us as an independent</p>
<p>   nation?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I'll certainly come to that. But the vote on Saturday is something</p>
<p>   for us and us alone to decide and we have to decide what is the best arrangement</p>
<p>   for us. I don't think anybody can seriously suggest we're not an independent</p>
<p>   country. I've just been through the most intense series of negotiations</p>
<p>   of any Prime Minister since World War II in relation to East Timor and if</p>
<p>   anybody suggests that the outcome would have been different if we'd been</p>
<p>   a republic, or we would have won more respect or different respect then</p>
<p>   I think they'd be having a lend of themselves. I mean, frankly, the independence</p>
<p>   argument is the weakest argument of all.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  The Queen is our Head of State. She is the Queen of Australia. Where does</p>
<p>   Her first responsibility lie, to Britain or to Australia?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the Queen is by law the Queen of Australia. By constitutional convention</p>
<p>   the Governor-Generalship has evolved into the effective Head of State of</p>
<p>   Australia. And one of the issues in this whole debate is whether you disturb</p>
<p>   that arrangement and replace it with a model that I think would leave a</p>
<p>   President more vulnerable and less secure than is the Governor-General under</p>
<p>   the present arrangement.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  What difference does the Queen make if, as you say, the system has evolved</p>
<p>   into the Governor-General effectively being our Head of State?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Part of that evolution is the development over hundreds of years of a system</p>
<p>   of government that has created at the APEX an impartial, non-political arrangement,</p>
<p>   which has given us 100 years of incredible stability and one that I'm unconvinced</p>
<p>   can be adequately replicated in a republican proposal, particularly the</p>
<p>   republican proposal that's on offer on Saturday. I mean, this really, in</p>
<p>   the end, is a question of whether you believe a change is going to make</p>
<p>   this country better, more secure, more stable. Now, this is a good and decent</p>
<p>   country no matter what its constitutional arrangement but I'm unconvinced</p>
<p>   that you should discard something that has so manifestly helped to make</p>
<p>   this country stable and successful politically.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Can you understand how many people, including people who have come to this</p>
<p>   country since the days of empire when this system was actually established,</p>
<p>   that they might find it faintly ludicrous that we share our Head of State,</p>
<p>   the Queen of England, the Queen of Australia, the Queen of New Zealand,</p>
<p>   the Queen of Canada, the Queen of the Bahamas, the Queen of Barbados, the</p>
<p>   Queen of Jamaica and so on?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, these are things that people will put in the balance. I respect</p>
<p>   the opposite point of view. I mean, I'm not going around the country personally</p>
<p>   attacking people who have republican views. I mean, I think it's important</p>
<p>   that we have sensible debate. I put those things on one side and then against</p>
<p>   that I say to myself we are a clearly independent country, clearly Sir William</p>
<p>   Deane under the Constitution of Australia effectively discharges the role</p>
<p>   of Head of State. And I ask myself, can you get something as balanced and</p>
<p>   as stable and as good under the republican model on offer on Saturday. And</p>
<p>   my answer to that is no. I mean, to start with, the President under that</p>
<p>   model would be far more vulnerable than is the Governor-General under the</p>
<p>   present system.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  We'll come back to that in a moment, it's an important point, but if our</p>
<p>   Governor-General, Sir William Deane, goes to the United States, he's not</p>
<p>   given the official recognition as our Head of State, the Queen of Australia</p>
<p>   gets that, not Sir William Deane.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think, Kerry, that over recent times many of those practises have</p>
<p>   changed. I mean, there's quite a bit of debate about this. I think previously</p>
<p>   that was probably the case but more recently the Governor-General has magnificently</p>
<p>   represented Australia overseas. I mean, look at the wonderful way he represented</p>
<p>   all of us at that very moving service at Interlaken in Switzerland. I mean,</p>
<p>   he is a person and I think all of the people that have filled that job in</p>
<p>   recent years can act for all of us. And, indeed, one of the problems I find</p>
<p>   with the republican model is I don't really think because of the nomination</p>
<p>   process, the pool of talent for a future President, will be as deep as is</p>
<p>   the pool of talent from which Governors General is now drawn because the</p>
<p>   nomination process will, I'm sure, discourage some people from allowing</p>
<p>   their names to go forward through fear that they might miss out, the embarrassment</p>
<p>   that if their involvement is made known that might compromise the job they</p>
<p>   are now doing. None of that happens under the present arrangement and I'm</p>
<p>   not sure that you'll have the same pool of talent available.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Peter Costello is one who has challenged your argument that the Governor-General</p>
<p>   has become the effective Head of State. But when you use the word effective,</p>
<p>   what does that really mean? Are you comfortable with the proposition that</p>
<p>   while-ever the Queen remains the Queen of Australia and officially our Head</p>
<p>   of State, that under that current system no Australian can ever be our official</p>
<p>   Head of State, they can be the Queen's representative, they can never be</p>
<p>   Australia's true Head of State?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, self-evidently, Kerry, I support the present system and the answer</p>
<p>   to that question, of course I support it.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But you're comfortable with that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Look, I wouldn't be arguing in favour of the status quo if I weren't in</p>
<p>   favour of the present system. I mean, the reality is that under our arrangement</p>
<p>   the ceremonial duties of government are performed by the Governor-General.</p>
<p>   The real executive powers of government are performed by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Well, one of those ceremonial powers is the opening of Olympic Games or</p>
<p>   Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, no, I'm talking about the ceremonial functions of government. There's</p>
<p>   nothing in our system that says that a Prime Minister shouldn't discharge</p>
<p>   ceremonial functions generally.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But it's certainly been a convention in the past, hasn't it, that the Queen</p>
<p>   or her representative has opened Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games in</p>
<p>   Australia?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, I took the view, and I'd take the view if we were a republic,</p>
<p>   that it's appropriate that the Prime Minister do it. And I should say I</p>
<p>   took that view when Paul Keating was the Prime Minister and when nobody</p>
<p>   really, and myself included, thought I would ever be Prime Minister. So.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible] as a republic?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, no, under our present arrangement. The point I'm making is that I think</p>
<p>   it's appropriate, given the Australian character and so forth, that it be</p>
<p>   done by the Prime Minister. But, in the end, something like this can't stand</p>
<p>   or fall on who opens the Olympic Games. I mean.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  How did you, just as a matter of curiosity, how did you communicate that</p>
<p>   to the Queen because on her own website she expresses the view that she</p>
<p>   actually enjoys taking the occasion to mark events like, for instance, the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth Games? And I assume that if you, as Prime Minister, think it's</p>
<p>   more appropriate to open the Olympic Games in Sydney you would also think</p>
<p>   it appropriate to open the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, to be perfectly frank, I haven't communicated anything on that</p>
<p>   to the Queen and I haven't read her website but.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  I'll give you a copy on the way out.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, all right, I'm fascinated that you're a keen reader, fascinated.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  As you know, under the proposed republic model the President would perform</p>
<p>   exactly the same job as the present Governor-General with the same powers</p>
<p>   and limitations so what is it you fear from such a President?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it's not a question of what I fear from the President. I start from</p>
<p>   the premise that we have a very strong and stable and workable system, even</p>
<p>   the republicans [inaudible] acknowledge that, that's why they're trying</p>
<p>   to duplicate it in their system. And I look at the model on offer and I</p>
<p>   see the instant dismissal of the President in the hands of the Prime Minister</p>
<p>   I don't think rival in any republican constitution in the world. I see a</p>
<p>   provision in the bill which says which will go in the Constitution that</p>
<p>   says that the reserve powers of the monarchy will continue. I mean, you're</p>
<p>   getting rid of the monarch but you'll continue the monarchy, which is the</p>
<p>   reserve powers. And I ask myself, can you really continue the reserve powers</p>
<p>   of the Crown in a republic and I wonder about that as a concept. And I think</p>
<p>   it's - whatever some of the lawyers say about that and I think I've got</p>
<p>   Sir Harry Gibbs at least on my side in raising questions about that. But</p>
<p>   the real weakness of this model is, I think, the Governor-General is less</p>
<p>   vulnerable under the present arrangement than would be the president.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Although you'd agree with me that effectively the Prime Minister appoints</p>
<p>   the Governor-General and effectively the Prime Minister can sack the Governor</p>
<p>   General?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well yeah but it's never happened, the latter has never happened.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But it can happen in the same way as you're describing it possibly happening</p>
<p>   under another system. It can happen.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Clearly we are being asked to endorse the new system so we have to examine</p>
<p>   it. What I argue is.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  So putting the existing system under scrutiny in the same way. You do agree</p>
<p>   with me that you right now have the power to sack a Governor-General in</p>
<p>   the same way that you have the power to appoint a Governor-General?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I do.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  You're a politician, and do we trust your appointments..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I'd invite you to look at the record. I mean one of the great things</p>
<p>   about the Governor-Generalship of Australia is that no matter how partisan</p>
<p>   has been the political background of those appointed to that office once</p>
<p>   they have got there they have adopted the a-political traditions of the</p>
<p>   office.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But why would that be any different with a president? [Inaudible] a process</p>
<p>   that, I assume you'd acknowledge, is on the face of it more democratic,</p>
<p>   more open to public consultation, the process of appointing a president</p>
<p>   under this model than it is now?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think the process of appointing the president under this model is</p>
<p>   a bit of Clayton's system. It's a compromise designed to placate the direct</p>
<p>   election republicans.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But how is it a Clayton's system when it needs the agreement from the Opposition</p>
<p>   Leader?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I am talking about the public consultation part of it.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But the part of it that requires you to at least pay lip service.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  That's the bit to which I'm.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  I guess even a Clayton's process is better than none and secondly you've</p>
<p>   got the back up of needing the approval of the Opposition Leader which you</p>
<p>   don't have now, and the approval of two-thirds of the Parliament which you</p>
<p>   don't have now.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  But, Kerry, my main criticism of it is not its Clayton's element, although</p>
<p>   that is criticism, my main criticism is that the president, in my opinion,</p>
<p>   is more vulnerable to arbitrary removal than is the Governor-General under</p>
<p>   the present arrangement.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Why?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well because the mere fact that you have to go through a process of requesting</p>
<p>   the Governor-General's removal, and even Gough Whitlam acknowledged in his</p>
<p>   writings about 1975 that this argument that he could have instantaneously</p>
<p>   got rid of the Governor-General is wrong.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But instantaneous as opposed to writing or phoning the Queen and getting</p>
<p>   her formal agreement.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  But there's also the constraint that I'm sure would apply with any Prime</p>
<p>   Minister of not wishing to directly involve the monarch in a political issue.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But secondly, the Prime Minister who capriciously sacks a president then</p>
<p>   has to face not only eventually the public's view of that but also has to</p>
<p>   get the support of the Parliament within 30 days of that sacking.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, but he would presumably be Prime Minister because the majority of the</p>
<p>   House of Representatives belong to his party.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible] high water if the Prime Minister makes a capricious judgement</p>
<p>   that his party would automatically support him?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Can I just finish though that, I mean, plainly his party is going to support</p>
<p>   him because he would not have dismissed the president other than for a major</p>
<p>   political reason and presumably his party will be on side with him. So I</p>
<p>   don't think the need to refer back to the House of Representatives provides</p>
<p>   any safeguard. But even if he's disavowed, that president is gone.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Why didn't you give the people of Australia their chance for a simple, honest</p>
<p>   expression, yes or no I do want a republic, I don't a republic? Let's work</p>
<p>   out the models later if the majority want it. Why not have that plebiscite,</p>
<p>   that direct expression of democratic opinion?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, what we've done is what we promised to do.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Yes, I understand what you're doing but why not that, as a first step?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, but please, surely that is a very powerful response at a time when politicians</p>
<p>   are attacked for not keeping their word. On this issue I've been fair dinkum</p>
<p>   with the Australian public. I've never disguised my own support for the</p>
<p>   present system. The Australian people elected me Prime Minister knowing</p>
<p>   my views on the present Constitution. I said we'd have a convention. I said</p>
<p>   at the convention if a clear view emerged I'd put it to a referendum. A</p>
<p>   clear view did emerge.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But you also said you wouldn't have a plebiscite. Why no plebiscite?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, because that is the commitment we made that, you see, the problem</p>
<p>   with the plebiscite is that you could end up in constitutional no mans land.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Why?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, let me explain. You can have a plebiscite and people just say yes</p>
<p>   we want a republic. Then you consult the public again and they say well</p>
<p>   we want this type of republic. You then put that type of republic up at</p>
<p>   a referendum which the law requires you to do, and it gets defeated and</p>
<p>   you're in a constitutional no mans land. You've destroyed the legitimacy</p>
<p>   of the existing constitutional arrangement but you've got nothing to take</p>
<p>   its place. I mean the only way you can..</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  This way you have handed the monarchists a very powerful weapon to defeat</p>
<p>   any republic because you are automatically giving them the tool to divide</p>
<p>   republicans.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Kerry, what has been put on Saturday is what Malcolm Turnbull and Kim Beazley</p>
<p>   and John Faulkner and many people in my own party, and a majority, a clear</p>
<p>   majority at the constitutional convention voted for. When I announced at</p>
<p>   the end of the convention that I was going to put this proposal to a referendum,</p>
<p>   Tom Keneally, one of the most prominent republicans in Australia said it</p>
<p>   was the ultimate act of grace for a person in my position with my support</p>
<p>   for the present system to obey the wishes of the Constitutional Convention.</p>
<p>   The public on Saturday will vote on what came out of the convention. We</p>
<p>   didn't hear any talk about plebiscites when the convention ended. People</p>
<p>   were lyrical about the character of the convention and now that, you know,</p>
<p>   people are expressing concerns about the outcome they're searching around.</p>
<p>   Now, I don't think that's reasonable. I kept my word on this. I promised</p>
<p>   the people. I eyeballed them and said, I do not support change but I will</p>
<p>   give the Australian people the opportunity to vote for a model that comes</p>
<p>   out of the Constitutional Convention and that is exactly what I'm doing.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard we're out of time but very quickly on one other issue - interest</p>
<p>   rates. The Reserve has put them up one-quarter of one percent. There is</p>
<p>   some question mark about whether the banks will take that rate even higher,</p>
<p>   with home mortgages at least. What's your response to that? Do they have</p>
<p>   a case for that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't think the banks have a case and I think there will be deep</p>
<p>   anger in the Australian community, very deep anger, if the banks take it</p>
<p>   any further. The Australian banks are strong and stable and that's good.</p>
<p>   They're also very profitable banks and I don't think there'll be much sympathy</p>
<p>   within the Australian community if that quarter of one percent is taken</p>
<p>   any further. They're clearly entitled if official rates go up to adjust</p>
<p>   accordingly, but to go beyond that would not be popular, would not be justified,</p>
<p>   and would not have the support of the Government.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister we're out of time. Thanks for talking with us.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Pleasure.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
