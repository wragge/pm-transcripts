PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES,<br />
HIS EXCELLENCY FIDEL V RAMOS, 18-23 AUGUST<br />
I am very pleased that the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Fidel<br />
Ramos, will visit Australia from 18 to 23 August. This will be the first State<br />
visit to Australia by a President of the Philippines. The President will visit<br />
Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Darwin.<br />
The visit underlines the increasingly warm and diverse relationship between<br />
our two countries and is an important opportunity to build it further.<br />
The commercial relationship between Australia and the Philippines holds<br />
great potential. While bilateral trade grew by 15 per cent between 1993 and<br />
1994, our economic links remain relatively underdeveloped. The significant<br />
program of economic reform which President Ramos has undertaken has<br />
stimulated economic growth in the Philippines and opened up significant new<br />
opportunities for Australian companies. I am pleased that President Ramos<br />
will be accompanied by a high-level business delegation and will participate<br />
in a number of major business seminars while in Australia.<br />
The Philippines is the fourth largest recipient of Australian aid. We have a<br />
developing defence co-operation program.<br />
Australia has a strong and active Filipino community, which I know is looking<br />
forward to welcoming President Ramos to Australia.<br />
I look forward to discussing a wide range of bilateral and regional issues with<br />
President Ramos. In particular, we will discuss our common interest in<br />
APEC, of which the Philippines will be the chair in 1996.<br />
