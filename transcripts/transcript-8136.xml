PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
HON. R. J. L. HAWKE A. C. M. P.<br />
DIETNEMBERS ASSOCIATION BREAKFAST<br />
TOKYO 19 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
Mr Mutoh, Chairman of the Japan-Australia Dietmembers<br />
Friendship League, distinguished members and other guests.<br />
Too often visits such as this are occasions, at least in<br />
public speeches, for fairly pious platitudes, for proffering<br />
the acceptable cliches and avoiding, at all costs, the<br />
delicate or the controversial.<br />
The times we live in and the relationship between our two<br />
nations are too important for this.<br />
And so, without presumption, I wish to speak, as a friend,<br />
directly on issues fundamental to these times and that.<br />
relationship. And there is one message I believe a very<br />
important message which I want to put to this influential<br />
group at the beginning of my official visit to Japan.<br />
It is a message of the firmest confidence for the future of<br />
relations between Australia and Japan, as we enter a new<br />
phase of our friendship within a new world order.<br />
Nine decades ago, at the dawn of the twentieth century, the<br />
six Australian colonies forged a Federal union and created a<br />
single independent nation on our vast continent.<br />
The observer of the Australia-Japan relationship today<br />
cannot fail to be struck by the precise division of those<br />
nine decades into two equal halves. In the first 45 years,<br />
Australians normally regarded Japan as a threat to be<br />
feared; in the second 45 years, Australia and Japan have put<br />
the past behind them and built a stable, business-like,<br />
increasingly prosperous and increasingly friendly<br />
relationship. That relationship has relied on three strong pillars: our<br />
deeply shared commitment to democracy and the rule of law;<br />
our alliance relationships with the United States that<br />
provide the northern and southern anchors of strategic<br />
security in our region; and the complementarity of our<br />
economic strengths that has created a vast and productive<br />
commercial exchange of, principally, our raw materials for<br />
your manufactured goods. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Today each of these pillars remains intact, important and<br />
vital to our relationship.<br />
Yet as we observe the rapid changes taking place in the<br />
world around us<br />
the more constructive superpower relationships, the<br />
astonishing overthrow of the old undemocratic regimes<br />
of Eastern Europe, the unanimity with which the world<br />
community is managing the first post-Cold War crisis in<br />
the Persian Gulf, the seemingly unstoppable dynamism of<br />
our own region<br />
and as our own two societies continue to change<br />
I believe we should ask whether we should be creating a new<br />
phase in our relationship.<br />
For Japan's part, you are no longer merely an emerging<br />
economic power, you are truly a global giant. You lead the<br />
world in crucial industries and your main economic dilemma<br />
a rare and happy one is how to allocate the massive<br />
savings surpluses you have accumulated.<br />
This economic strength is calling forth a louder and more<br />
authoritative influence for Japan in global and regional<br />
affairs and I mean political and strategic affairs, not<br />
just economic. That trend, apparent before, has been<br />
reinforced by the way in which Cold War tensions have been<br />
replaced by the new and complex problems of multipolar<br />
diplomacy and strategy.<br />
For Australia's part, we too are engaging the world on new<br />
terms. We have accepted the need for economic flexibility;<br />
we have steadily internationalised our economy and we are<br />
becoming steadily more capable of sophisticated economic<br />
linkages. And we have proven our commitment to multilateral<br />
diplomacy that is diligent, credible and increasingly<br />
respected.<br />
With all this, I believe we are entitled to conclude that<br />
Australia and Japan should indeed be on the threshold of a<br />
new, and even closer, and certainly more diverse and<br />
sophisticated relationship a third phase in the history of<br />
our relationship that will take us into the next century not<br />
only as people who do a lot of business together but as<br />
colleagues, constructive partners and friends.<br />
Increasingly, we will see each other as more than<br />
complementary and valuable markets.<br />
Australia will look to Japan as a source of the most modern<br />
technologies; a source of diverse investment funds; a magnet<br />
for Australian exports and investment; a regional friend<br />
exercising international political influence. </p>
<p>3.<br />
And I believe Japan will look to Australia as a creative,<br />
vigorous, increasingly diversified partner in an<br />
economically dynamic region; a self-reliant and<br />
self-confident nation constructively involved in the great<br />
issues of our region and our world; a decent, tolerant,<br />
vibrant society enriched by migrants from around the globe<br />
not to forget, of course, an exciting land offering a warm<br />
welcome to your tourists.<br />
These are the kinds of issues that I look forward to<br />
discussing with Prime Minister Kaifu, with you, Mr Mutoh,<br />
and with other political and business leaders on this visit.<br />
Australia and Japan need to broaden our relations to ensure<br />
that they reflect the changing realities and needs of the<br />
1990s.<br />
This morning I want to address in more detail one aspect,<br />
and a critically important one, of that multifaceted task:<br />
the international context in which our bilateral relations<br />
will be operating.<br />
The magnitude of the global changes of recent years leaves<br />
me in no doubt that we have witnessed a permanent and<br />
fundamental shift in international relationships.<br />
But what comes next is not yet clear. The very phrase<br />
" post-Cold War period" sums up much of the uncertainty of<br />
this time. It suggests, correctly, that the only thing we<br />
are sure of is what has gone before us. We do not know what<br />
is yet to come.<br />
We do know that the ending of the Cold War has not led to<br />
the un-invention of weapons of mass destruction nuclear,<br />
chemical or biological. And it has not led to the<br />
disappearance of big armies, national rivalries or reckless<br />
leaders.<br />
And we know too, that different regions of the globe still<br />
have their distinct security problems something, I know,<br />
which is very evident here in Japan as you look at the<br />
complicated security equation in Northeast Asia.<br />
In particular, to those who might have forgotten it in the<br />
euphoria of crumbling walls in Europe, of emerging<br />
superpower cooperation, of real progress towards strategic<br />
nuclear disarmament, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait brought home<br />
forcefully that the new world order does not necessarily<br />
mean a peaceful and safe world order.<br />
In addressing my own parliamentary colleagues on<br />
developments in the Gulf recently, I said that Iraq's action<br />
challenged us to define the way in which the world community<br />
will cooperate in the years ahead. We needed to work out<br />
how to manage such dangers which are by no means unique to<br />
the Middle East before they arise. </p>
<p>4.<br />
That is why Australia has supported the United Nations and<br />
the international rule of law against the clear challenge<br />
posed by Iraq. We believe all nations will suffer if<br />
aggression goes unchecked in the Gulf; and that all nations<br />
will benefit if the United Nations can succeed in giving<br />
practical and irresistible expression to the outrage we all<br />
feel at the invasion of Kuwait. This has been exemplified<br />
by the unparalleled and very welcome cooperation between the<br />
United States and the Soviet Union.<br />
In the light of those judgments, my Government has<br />
condemned Iraq's invasion absolutely;<br />
supported the Security Council's resolutions,<br />
calling for unconditional withdrawal;<br />
implemented the mandatory sanctions imposed by<br />
Security Council resolution 661 to compel that<br />
withdrawal; deployed three ships of the Royal Australian Navy<br />
to join the international effort to enforce those<br />
sanctions; and supported the deployment of Western and Arab<br />
forces to the Gulf, to defend Saudi Arabia and to<br />
deter further Iraqi aggression.<br />
I should add that throughout the difficult weeks since<br />
2 August, my Government has welcomed and admired the clarity<br />
of purpose, the decisive action and the sense of<br />
responsibility which the United States has displayed in<br />
leading the international response to Iraq's aggression.<br />
We deplore the circumstances which might make it necessary<br />
to use military force in the Gulf. But we accept that peace<br />
is bought at too high a price if that price is the<br />
appeasement of aggression.<br />
In this sense, the Gulf crisis has been the first important<br />
international test of the post-Cold War period.<br />
And it is one reason why my visit to Tokyo at this time has<br />
an importance which extends beyond our bilateral<br />
relationship. More than on any other of my three visits to<br />
Japan as Prime Minister, I wish on this occasion to talk to<br />
leaders in Japan about our views of the world and the roles<br />
we perceive for each other in the world.<br />
Because if indeed the new world order is to be peaceful and<br />
safe if we are to create a new Concert of Nations, which,<br />
even more than the Concert of Europe after the Napoleonic<br />
wars, can provide a durable multipolar balance of power<br />
then, make no mistake, Japan will have a critical<br />
contribution to make. </p>
<p>Indeed, it is true to say that today no framework for the<br />
conduct of international affairs could be regarded as<br />
adequate or complete if it lacked Japanese commitment and<br />
involvement. The days are gone when Japan's international<br />
political influence can or should lag far behind its<br />
economic strength and economic interests. The power of your<br />
economy, the strength of your democracy, the talents of your<br />
people, entitle you to a place of leadership as of right.<br />
I want to make it very clear to you that Australia welcomes<br />
that. And we are confident that Japan has the commitment,<br />
courage and understanding necessary to exercise the<br />
responsibilities of leadership that go hand in hand with<br />
that right.<br />
So we hope that Japan will be actively involved in the<br />
affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. In<br />
particular, we welcome Japan's recognition that its<br />
strategic interests and international responsibilities are<br />
deeply engaged in the Persian Gulf, and we welcome your<br />
decision thus far to support the international response to<br />
Iraq's aggression, by financial and other measures.<br />
In the region, for all its economic dynamism, an unswerving<br />
commitment to peace cannot yet be taken for granted. For<br />
our own sakes and for the sake of the region, Australia and<br />
Japan want to see peace, prosperity and democracy.<br />
I sincerely welcomed Prime Minister Kaifu's work in ensuring<br />
that regional issues were given proper attention at the<br />
Houston summit meeting of the G7. We have appreciated<br />
Japan's active involvement in the new processes of Asia<br />
Pacific Economic Cooperation and in the search for a<br />
comprehensive settlement in Cambodia. And we welcome the<br />
emerging Japanese involvement in regional environmental<br />
issues, such as your regional suspension of drift net<br />
fishing. Let me point out however that Australia's position<br />
is for a global ban on this barbaric practice.<br />
We are fortunate in all this to have in the United Nations<br />
an organisation beginning to fulfil the aspirations of its<br />
founders the aspirations that international cooperation<br />
can keep the world peaceful. But it is in line with<br />
everything that I have said today that the structure of the<br />
United Nations needs to be reviewed and reformed so as to<br />
reflect contemporary realities including the reflection,<br />
much more adequately than under present arrangements, of<br />
Japan's own status, contribution and role. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Mr Minister<br />
With Japan's important economic strengths come equally<br />
important economic responsibilities. You well understand<br />
the significance for global economic prosperity of the<br />
maintenance of the open multilateral trading system the<br />
system which has done so much to guarantee the prosperity of<br />
our countries over nearly half a century. In this area,<br />
too, Japanese leadership will be necessary to ensure that<br />
the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations does<br />
not fail. For if it does, the consequences for the world<br />
will be disastrous.<br />
In the collapse of the international trading system in the<br />
1930s, we have a stark reminder of what might happen if<br />
narrow and short-term political self-interest is allowed to<br />
prevail over what we all know to be our long-term common<br />
interest.<br />
We must avoid that outcome at all costs, and Japan's help in<br />
preventing it will be essential. It would be a tragic irony<br />
if, at a time when the military and ideological issues which<br />
have threatened peace for much of the past four decades are<br />
being resolved, the world descends into conflict over<br />
international trade questions.<br />
So let me be quite clear: Japan's preparedness to achieve<br />
genuine reform of trade rules including specifically your<br />
willingness to liberalise further your domestic agricultural<br />
protection will be a true test, and an appropriate one, of<br />
your leadership in the 1990s.<br />
Further liberalisation would directly benefit competitive<br />
agricultural producers, to be sure and it would also apply<br />
very welcome pressure on the other protectionist economies,<br />
notably the European Community, to match your reforms with<br />
rational measures of their own.<br />
Mr Mutoh, distinguished members,<br />
Ultimately it will be up to Japan to determine how you will<br />
resolve these issues of leadership that I have raised today.<br />
Let me close, however, on a very candid note.<br />
We want Japan to be more forthcoming, more confident, more<br />
creative, more outspoken than it has been in the past. Do<br />
not hold back, for you have much to contribute. As we move<br />
into a new exciting era of international relations, this<br />
great country, with its remarkable capacity to adapt to<br />
change and its unparalleled economic and technological<br />
achievements, can and should be an increasingly important<br />
leader for the good of our region and for the good of the<br />
world. </p>
