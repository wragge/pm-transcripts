ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Nearly three years ago, the Commonwealth and all State<br />
Governments decided -to face up to the difficult problem of<br />
relativities in financial assistance grants to the States,<br />
and for the first time in Australia's history, to have a<br />
comprehensive, independent review of the distribution of<br />
those grants. We expect the recommendations of that so-called<br />
review of relativities to be released within a few days.<br />
In all Federations, there is a significant problem that<br />
arises from differences betwecn member States; differences<br />
in population, in size, in incomes, in economic development<br />
and so on. In Australia, before the Second World War, each<br />
State raised its own -tax requirements, including income taxes.<br />
There were very obvious differences in the abilities of the<br />
States to raise revenue and to provide services to their<br />
residents. It was in recognition of this fact that the<br />
Commonwealth Grants Commission was created in 1933). It is<br />
a unique institution among Federal systems. Its task is tQ<br />
assess claims by some States for special grants to compensate<br />
them for their lower tax raising capacity, or their higher<br />
costs, which prevent them from providing public services at<br />
a standard equivalent to those available in the richer, more<br />
popular States of New South Wales and Victoria.<br />
At various stages, all of the less popular States have been<br />
claimant States and have received special grants. Since the<br />
Second World War, the personal income tax has been collected<br />
exclusively by -the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth has give-n.<br />
back a large part of the revenue its gets in the formn of<br />
grants to the States. Initially, these grants simply<br />
reimbursed each StLate a given proportion of the income tax<br />
revenue collected from its residents. Over time, the dist~ ribution<br />
of the grants to the States has been adjusted with the agreement<br />
of all States, to recognise the differences in their capaci-ties<br />
and costs, largely removing the need for the poorer States to<br />
apply for special grants.<br />
it has always been difficult to decide how the total moniLes<br />
available for the States should be divided between them. Over<br />
the years, the decisions on this have reflected recommendations<br />
of the independent Grants Commission, and investigations<br />
undertaken co-operatively by Commonwealth and State officials.<br />
There have however, been significant changes, particularly in<br />
recent times in the distribution of population and in the<br />
economic: structure of Australia and of the various States.<br />

So, at the Premiers' Conference in July, 1977, the States agreed<br />
that a major independent review of the distribution of grants<br />
should be undertaken. That is being done by the Grants<br />
Commission, with the assistance of two additional associate<br />
Commissioners appointed for just this task.<br />
At the next Premiers' Conference and Loan Council Meeting<br />
on the 19th of June, the recommendations for new relativities<br />
between the States will be a major agenda item. But by then,<br />
neither the Commonwealth nor the States will have had time to<br />
consider the report in detail. A detailed examination is<br />
essentiai, for the subject of this report is vital to the<br />
future of all the States.<br />
In the circumstances, I have willingly agreed to Lindsay Thompson's<br />
request that an additional Premier's Conference be held later<br />
in the year to discuss this matter more fully and in a more<br />
considered way. We are currently looking at possible dates<br />
during the Parliamentary recess for this additional Conference.<br />
Nobody other than the Grants Commission itself yet knows what<br />
the recommendations will be, but there is widespread belief that<br />
it will recommend changes, possibly substantial changes, in<br />
the shares going to the various States. of course, it cannot<br />
recommend a greater share for one State, without recommending<br />
a smaller share for others. How to implement the report' s<br />
recommendations will be a difficult question, requiring an<br />
exceptionally high degree of consultation between the States<br />
and-between them an&amp; the Commonwcalth. The Comrmonwealth is<br />
willing to assist the States in their discussion and<br />
decision-mak Kc, but itt is at least as much a matter for<br />
co-operation between the States themselves, for ultimately,<br />
it is their shares, not the total of Commonwealth grants<br />
available to them that is-at issue.<br />
The statesmanship of the leaders ' of all Governments in<br />
Australia will be put to the test in the coming weeks. Decisions<br />
important to the very structure of our Federation will be at<br />
stake. Co-operation and consultation will be required in<br />
abundance. 000---</p>
