PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 AUGUST 1988<br />
I have today sent the following message to the Acting<br />
President of Pakistan, Ghulam Ishaq Khan:<br />
" I was shocked to learn of President Zia Ul Haq's tragic<br />
death. On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, may<br />
I extend to you, and to the Government and people of<br />
Pakistan, our deep condolences and sympathy. Please<br />
also convey my sympathy to the President's family and to<br />
your other countrymen who have suffered personal loss.<br />
President Zia's strong stand in respect of Afghanistan<br />
has been very rightly recognised and acknowledged<br />
throughout the world.<br />
We very much hope that the President's untimely death<br />
will not hamper the progress towards the consolidation<br />
of democracy in Pakistan.<br />
Again, your Excellency, pleace accept my personal<br />
condolences at this tragic time for your country."<br />
