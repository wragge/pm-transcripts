    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government today announced a First Home Owners Boost to ensure first home buyers will be eligible for grants of up to $21,000.</p>
<p>The First Home Owners Boost is a decisive Rudd Government initiative to stimulate housing activity and give first home buyers a better chance in the housing market.</p>
<p>Under the First Home Owners Boost:</p>
<p>     * First home buyers who purchase established homes will have their grant doubled from $7,000 to $14,000; and</p>
<p>     * First home buyers who purchase a newly constructed home will receive an extra $14,000 to take their grant to $21,000.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 first home buyers are estimated to benefit from the scheme.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's First Home Owners Boost is part of the Rudd Government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy during the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>First home buyers will be eligible for the First Home Owners Boost from today (14 October, 2008).</p>
<p>All contracts entered into by 30 June, 2009 will be eligible for this new additional assistance.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government will invest almost $1.5 billion in the housing market through this initiative.</p>
<p>All newly-constructed homes will have to at least meet their relevant State and Territory energy efficiency and sustainability standards.</p>
<p>This initiative will help strengthen the Australian economy during global financial crisis and help protect Australians during the difficult global economic times that lie ahead.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government understands that the economy faces the twin challenges of a subdued housing market and housing affordability levels at record lows.</p>
<p>That is why the Government is committed to action on both fronts.</p>
<p>This measure builds on the Government's $2.2 billion worth of housing initiatives in the 2008-09 Budget, including:</p>
<p>     * A National Rental Affordability Scheme to build 50,000 new affordable rental properties;</p>
<p>     * A Housing Affordability Fund to reduce the cost of bringing new homes to market; and</p>
<p>     * First Home Saver Accounts to encourage young people to save for a new home.</p>
<p>The First Home Owners Boost responds to the housing affordability challenge and will help strengthen residential investment activity in Australia.</p>
