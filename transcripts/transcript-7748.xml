TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, COMON WEALTHFFCE, WHYALLA,<br />
SEPTEMER 1989<br />
E 0E-PROOFONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: The latest Bulletin poll shows the ALP'S drop of<br />
to 43. If a poll was in early September you would be<br />
out of Government.<br />
PM: No that's not right. If a poll now was, in my<br />
judgement, we would win and I tell you what if Mr Peacock<br />
could do a swap with me on the polls he would grab it like a<br />
brown hungry dog. But I'm not going to swap with him though.<br />
JOURNALIST: His rating might be down but their Party's up to<br />
PM: Well I say with an election, no, you've got preferences<br />
to be distributed. We're very, very confident given the<br />
present circumstances it's quite clear that when the election<br />
is held, we'll win. But elections, that's some time of f.<br />
Let's talk about some beautiful things here in Whyalla.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Bulletin magazine, sorry to keep the same<br />
point, has said that because of the pilots dispute that<br />
you've dropped. Do you think that's the reason?<br />
PM: No. All I can say is we're doing polling privately on<br />
the dispute and the overwhelming majority of Australians are<br />
in favour of the Government's position and against the<br />
pilots, which is not surprising because the pilots are trying<br />
to smash the economy and bring a great deal of hardship upon<br />
people. So it's not surprising that people are supporting<br />
the Government's position.<br />
JOURNALIST: The pilots' union have asked you to back of f so<br />
they can negotiate. r~ n i bZ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: That was yesterday's. I don't know what their next<br />
piece of hypocrisy will be but the situation is quite clear<br />
and that is clear from Mr McCarthy. He said they'll have<br />
nothing to do with the Industrial Relations Commission, which<br />
at least is consistent. They have from February of this year<br />
made it clear that they were going to be prepared to<br />
absolutely close down their industry, smash the Australian<br />
economy becuase they a group of 1600 people were<br />
different from all other workers and that they should have<br />
special treatment. I said from day one that is not on. I've<br />
remained immoveable in my commitment to protecting the<br />
Australian economy. What's going on is very simple, it's not<br />
complex, it is that they have resigned, the Federation has no<br />
members in the airline industry and the airlines are going<br />
steadfastly about their business of restoring the Australian<br />
airline operation. That they will do.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the question of the pilots dispute, the<br />
forecast current account figures tomorrow don't look too<br />
good. Do you think that the problem with the pilots dispute<br />
is causing a major problem for the Government, given the loss<br />
of revenue through loss of tourism and foreign dollars coming<br />
into the country?<br />
PM: What you've got to understand is this; of course the<br />
pilots dispute is causing some immediate economic problems,<br />
there's no doubt about that, for the tourist industry, we're<br />
going to help the tourist industry. I've written to the<br />
leaders of the banks, of the finance industry, asking to<br />
accommodate operators during this period because the<br />
fundamentals of Australian tourism remain strong and I'm<br />
going to give them financial assistance when the dispute's<br />
over to help them re-attract visitors.-But as I say, while<br />
there are problems now what we are fighting to protect is a<br />
situation which would be one of chaos, ' I mean absolute<br />
economic disaster. The simple facts are that if the pilots<br />
Swere allowed to get away with saying, ' we're different, we're<br />
going to just thumb our noses at everyone else, get 30% and<br />
tell the rest of the workforce to go hang themselves', then<br />
we would have disaster, mounting unemployment and inflation,<br />
the economy would collapse. That would be bad for the<br />
tourism industry as well as everyone else. So the issues<br />
have been clear to me from the beginning. I think they are<br />
increasingly clear to the people and hopefully I think<br />
they're becoming clearer to pilots. We will have, as I've<br />
said, we'll have at least 50% of capacity by the end of this<br />
month, I think that's a conservative estimate, and the<br />
airline industry is being restored. My only hope is that </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PM cont) individual pilots against whom I have no vendetta,<br />
no vindictiveness, I would hope that as many of them as<br />
possible will sign up with the airlines. It's quite clear<br />
there's not going to be jobs for all of them because with the<br />
productivity changes that are involved in the new contracts,<br />
the airlines will need very, very significantly less pilots<br />
than they had before. But I hope as many of them will join<br />
up now so that they can be part of a restored and<br />
reinvigorated and more efficient and productive airline<br />
industry in this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said earlier 50% by the end of the month but<br />
yesterday it was said 50% by the end of the week back in the<br />
air. PM: No-one has said 50% by the end of the week. It's<br />
consistently been said 50% by the end of the month. I think<br />
no-one now questions that that will be achieved.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you satisified that safety<br />
and training standards are not being eroded in the methods<br />
you are adopting?<br />
PM: Yes, sure. We have, as you know, an independent arms<br />
length authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, which has<br />
statutory responsibility in these matters and they will not<br />
undertake measures or processes which will in any sense<br />
involve a dereliction of their statutory duty.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Department of Statistics figures seem to<br />
point to the fact that retail finance and housing industry<br />
finance is down. Isn't it time to really loosen the brakes<br />
on the economy with interest rates<br />
PM: No, not yet. But I'm very glad you mentioned those.<br />
The two sets of statistics to which you refer the retail<br />
sales down and housing down the sort of things that we want<br />
to see, that's why we've had' tight policy and I can assure<br />
you, and I thank you for raising it, I can assure you that<br />
consistent with what we've said, we will act in this way;<br />
that interest rates won't be kept higher for one day longer<br />
than is necessary but they won't be brought of f one day<br />
sooner than is responsible. We've got to have a situation<br />
where we have a level of activity which is consistent with<br />
growth and employment growth but not at a level which will<br />
suck in too high a level of imports. These two sets of<br />
statistics which you mention today are welcome.<br />
JOURNALIST: But they do point to a slow down in the economy. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: Yes, but you've got to say that the indicators are still<br />
somewhat mixed. For instance, the most recent employment<br />
figures that we had was an increase of some 50,000 in<br />
employment would point to a still continuing high level of<br />
activity. As I've been saying for some weeks now, the<br />
indicators are mixed but that these two which you rightly<br />
refer to are of themselves an indication of the slowing down,<br />
and that's welcome.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the founder of the West German<br />
Greens Party this morning has painted you and your Government<br />
as imposters on the environment question. Would you like to<br />
respond to that?<br />
PM: Well I want to be gentle and charitable as is my normal<br />
nature<br />
JOURNALIST: The pilots would be glad to hear that.<br />
PM: Well if they read my letter they would see that that's<br />
exactly what I am. Well Petra, she was over there when we<br />
were there, she was at the dinner that we gave and she was<br />
very fulsome in her praise at that meeting of the things that<br />
we were doing. I just get a little bit amused about the<br />
monopoly of moral righteousness that people like Petra have.<br />
Now I don't want to get stuck into her. The simple facts are<br />
that I can point to the World Heritage Foundation. For<br />
instance, they've got no reason for running a line for Bob<br />
Hawke and his Government but they have said that no goverment<br />
in the world has done more in this area of protection of the<br />
environment than this Australian Government. They are right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Neal Blewett today was quoted as<br />
discussing the possibility of legalisihg heroine in<br />
Australia, in today's SMH. What's your feeling on that?<br />
PM: I haven't seen the report. There is a fair bit of<br />
discussion going on over the years, not only in this country<br />
but around the world on this issue but that is not on the<br />
Government's agenda. It's appropriate in this whole area of<br />
drug discussion for people to be talking about it but it's<br />
not on the Government's agenda.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one last question. on the<br />
question of the pilots strike and the ACTU Congress coming<br />
up, figures this morning pointing to the Congress suggest<br />
that there's been a dramatic fall away and possibly a trend<br />
in that direction in union membership in Australia. The<br />
methods you have endorsed in solving this pilots dispute<br />
can't be filling the ACTU with any sort of optimism about the<br />
turnaround </p>
<p>PM: We've got a secretary of the ACTU and the incoming<br />
president of the ACTU. The secretary of the ACTU<br />
consistently from day one has been fully supportive of what<br />
we're doing. Mr Martin Ferguson today I don't know whether<br />
you've seen the report yet I recommend you read it and<br />
you'll see that he is fully supportive of the Government and<br />
so he should be because the situation would be if we allowed<br />
a position where those with industrial muscle were able to<br />
hold the community to ransom, there wouldn't only be the<br />
trade union movement who would suffer, everyone would. What<br />
you refer to, and it's a proper thing to refer to about the<br />
pressures upon unionism it's not a unique characteristic of<br />
this country. You have a world in which the processes of<br />
production are dramatically changing, more rapidly you know<br />
they have before in the history of mankind and as the<br />
processes of production change, as you move more to white<br />
collar areas of employment which have not been traditionally<br />
unionised, and the experience of every country in the world<br />
is that there has been some decline in unionism. The thing<br />
that is going for Australian unionism is that you have a<br />
leadership there which is imaginative, which is looking at<br />
what's happening in the rest of the world, which understands<br />
changes that are taking place, and they are saying these do<br />
involve new challenges, it's not good enough just to rely on<br />
the methods and the attitudes and the assumptions and the<br />
presumptions of the past. You have to be prepared to change<br />
your structures, your objectives, your processes of<br />
operation. I think Australian workers generally, and the<br />
trade unions in particular, are fortunate in having a<br />
leadership which understands these things and is acting<br />
accordingly. ends </p>
