PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
HOLEPROOF FACTORY OPENING, MELBOURNE<br />
29 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
T'hank you very much John, Phillip, Allen, John and Robert, and ladies and<br />
gentleman. It is a great pleasure to be here today John, for this opening of what<br />
you say is probably the largest investment of its kind in the industry, certainly in<br />
the State of Victoria, probably in Australia. And it is a celebration of true<br />
entrepreneurship and true management, the entrepreneurship we used to know and<br />
associate that word with, rather then paper shuffling which happened at the end of<br />
the ' 80s, but the entrepreneurship to identified business, to say we can succeed in<br />
it, we will be in it and we will be good at it. And the management which brings<br />
the people, the design engineers, but most importantly the staff, the workers<br />
together in a compact of pride and productivity to make it all work.<br />
And I think that is the new era of Australia, that's the era that John Button and I<br />
hoped for when we made those historic decisions back in the early 1980s to peel<br />
away. exchange controls, to float the Australian dollar and to see the tariff levels of<br />
Australia decline to produce a new wave of new industries. And we are pleased to<br />
be able to say that has happened and is happening, and the term that your chairman<br />
used, -international benchmarking is something which would have been basically a<br />
foreign phrase a decade ago because nobody would have believed that many<br />
Australian companies could actually benchmark themselves with the best of<br />
international practice, which is happening today.<br />
And so to see in this industry one of the most competitive in the world and<br />
particularly one where there has been a high labour content in countries where<br />
there has been cheap labour costs is a very tough industry to compete in. But it has </p>
<p>been competed, competition has been competed with, and in competition we are<br />
seeing the devel6p-ment of quite sophisticated machines and production processes<br />
combined with obviously an enthusiastic labour force to produce a very productive<br />
and competitive process. And I was again very impressed by the technology<br />
which was so unique that the media were not invited to photograph it or to<br />
demonstrate how it works, processes developed by Pacific Dunlop with some of<br />
the best high tech engineering and electronic engineering firms of Australia.<br />
This is a great tribute indeed again to the entrepreneurship of -Pacific Dunlop and<br />
the interest of the production people in producing such a competitive product and<br />
being able to do it so well. Now it is not often as you know I am always bagged<br />
for my suits, you know that but it is not often I walk around with a product of the<br />
factory on, but I have the Holeproof undies on today I can assure you. And I don't<br />
like those little skinny briefs, I like the full ones, I like a bit of room. And when I<br />
saw them going around today, one lady there was packing them and I thought well<br />
I will just grab half a dozen of those because they will get me through the rest of<br />
the year. But the fact is, and I have probably got the socks on as well, in the TCF<br />
apparel stakes I am probably ranking quite well today. In saying so can say I am<br />
very pleased to be so.<br />
Now we are presiding in Australia over a very great change and I think that it is a<br />
unique change, a great partnership between the Government and business, and<br />
John was very kind enough to acknowledge John Button's efforts as the Minister<br />
for Manufacturing Industry for a decade. This must make John just about the<br />
longest serving Minister in this area of policy in the world, certainly in the OECD.<br />
It is a great thing to see something from beginning to fruition, a cultural change of<br />
the variety which John has presided over and which we are seeing in Australia.<br />
Nine years ago in 1982 we exported 14 per cent of the total production of<br />
Australia, today that figure is 23 per cent, that's nine per cent of GDP, nine per cent<br />
of the total production, the difference. Today that is worth $ 36 000 million of<br />
exports that we didn't have back there in 1982. And one can just imagine what our<br />
trade and international debt, our trade deficit would be like, if in fact we didn't<br />
have that $ 36 billion of exports that has occurred over the nine years, growth in<br />
exports. And it is a great story for Australia because we are now exporting more<br />
manufactured products than we export rural products or mining products and of<br />
course a large part of the exports, a significant part, is coming from apparel and<br />
clothing exports of which actually grew at an annual rate of 36 per cent between<br />
1985 and 1991-' 92 when export earnings reached $ 122 million. And in the same<br />
period textile yarn and fabric exports had an average growth rate of 23 per cent.<br />
In other words not only are we making it at home but we are also making it<br />
abroad. And it is that making it abroad which think is one of the things which<br />
really does please all of us, that we are not just able to do it here, we can do it<br />
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Now John Gough mentioned the Textile Clothing and Footwear Development_<br />
Authority, and the Authority is playing a wide ranging role in trying to re-<br />
-establish key sectors of the TCF industries across Australia, but most particularly<br />
in Victoria and they have had a role I understand in the development also of this<br />
new facility, and they have across the whole industry in companies like Hilton,<br />
King Gee, Yakka, Jamison Austechs, Tontine, and we are also giving assistance to<br />
wool tops processing, a plant to be built at Geelong by BWK a project which will<br />
add 35 per cent in the value of Australian wool. In other words we will be<br />
exporting 35 per cent more value instead of simply exporting the raw product.<br />
These are all phenomenal changes and they are happening across industry. This<br />
morning I had the pleasure to join the Premier in visiting Williamstown Dockyard<br />
to see the commissioning of the second frigate which the Navy told me is to a<br />
higher standard than their American counterparts. A much higher standard, on its<br />
sea trials, no faults, a much higher standard on a very highly sophisticated thing.<br />
In the same way that higher technology is again in this plant here. So we are<br />
seeing it across industry and that is the reason why there is so much hope for<br />
manufacturing in Australia and so much hope around the world.<br />
Now just spent a week in Japan and I have seen industry there, but there is<br />
nothing that I don't think in certain sectors that the Japanese can do that we can't<br />
do, or that we can't do things cooperatively. But in what's become a world class<br />
business for Australia, Pacific Dunlop has gone out to the world and has<br />
businesses around the Asia-Pacific area, are developing products which were first<br />
developed here.<br />
So John could I say again congratulations to the company, it has been a marvellous<br />
result, but I think it just proves this point about the partnership between<br />
Government and business, and we have had a debate about tariffs in this country<br />
and while we all believe that we have got to get the tariffs down to levels which<br />
give the consumer a better price and have more productivity, we still believe, we<br />
have got to say we want industries. We just don't want to throw them to the wall,<br />
to let simply imports take the hindmost. And that's why it has always been a fine<br />
judgement about where these tariff levels stop, where the levels actually finish.<br />
And in apparel by the year 2000 it will be around 25 per cent, it won't be around<br />
zero. Which means this business will continue, and I doubt very much it would<br />
continue at zero, as I doubt most other businesses which have got a limited<br />
production run can compete with the huge production runs of countries in the<br />
northern hemisphere. So as always some sense and some judgement and some<br />
understanding of the business needs to be brought to bear by Governments in<br />
determining where tariff levels fall, that's what John Button had the burden of<br />
doing a couple of years ago, and I would like to say we see it as a partnership<br />
between Government and business and if what we are seeing today here is<br />
partnership it speaks volumes for the concept of partnership and getting along.<br />
And the most important partnership is of course a partnership between the<br />
management and the staff, the employees. If there is any lesson to be learned from </p>
<p>4<br />
Japan or any of the newly industrialising countries, it is wherever you see pride in<br />
the product and pride in the value of what one is doing, you see a productive<br />
business and that is part of management's wisdom and part of the goodwill and<br />
wisdom of the staff.<br />
That is obviously here, I congratulate you for it, I salute you for it, but most<br />
particularly it is with very great pleasure indeed that I congratulate Pacific Dunlop<br />
and declare this most modem marvellous plant officially open.<br />
Thank you. </p>
