    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome the historic decision of Indonesiaâs Peopleâs Consultative Assembly (MPR) to approve the separation of East Timor from Indonesia.</p>
<p>The decision faithfully implements the freely expressed will of the majority of the East Timorese people.</p>
<p>It marks a new start for East Timor.</p>
<p>The decision is also a milestone in Indonesiaâs progress towards democracy, beginning with the general elections last June. It will be welcomed by the international community.</p>
<p>The decision will be welcomed by all Australians.</p>
<p>Once the consequential steps are finalised in Indonesia, a United Nations Transitional Authority, UNTAET, will take responsibility for the administration of East Timor and prepare it for independence.</p>
<p>The multinational force, INTERFET, to which sixteen countries are now contributing, is making good progress in restoring peace and security. It will continue until a UN peacekeeping force is ready to take over.</p>
<p>Australia is committed to continuing to work closely with both East Timor and Indonesia to ensure that the transition to independence for East Timor proceeds as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has undertaken to play a significant role in helping East Timor establish itself. The Government also looks forward to rebuilding Australiaâs relationship with Indonesia on the basis of the many important interests that our countries share.</p>
