INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD COLVILLE FOR." SUNDAY REPORT"<br />
Co lviiile<br />
Prime minister, the Olympic boycott, the whole Russ * m<br />
Afghanistan situation, yourself, the American Pres en<br />
obviously very concerned about it. Why is it so ta~~ h. J~.<br />
Can you draw an analogy.<br />
Prime minister LRA 14Y<br />
I think so, yes. I suppose now that it is only t~~ pie<br />
in our community who can remember events in the 19 s. eed,<br />
I was only a child myself. But I was conscious throug. hat<br />
decade of the growing concern of my own parents and obviously<br />
conscious of what was happening at the end of the decade. In<br />
1936 Hitler could have been stopped very,-very easily indeed<br />
when he marched into the Rhineland. Indeed, at that time there<br />
had been a great debate within Germany and the generals had orders<br />
to withdraw if there wa~ s any resistance from France or from<br />
Britain, from anyone. They did not. France at the time had<br />
100 divisions and did nothing. Now, quite plainly, that<br />
particular event encouraged Hitler to believe that France and<br />
Britain would never act, that they were weak, that they were<br />
incompetent, that they were corrupt, that they were decadent.<br />
Therefore, he was encouraged, and Italy was also encouraged<br />
in relation to North African ventures. The invasions, Austria;<br />
Czechoslovakia, within Europe; Ethiopa in North Africa, and<br />
nobody did anything. The old League of Nations was totally<br />
impotent.* So, step by step was set in train a process which<br />
led to the World War and literally tens of millions of young<br />
men and women being killed, a large number of people dying in<br />
camps and under the bombings around the world.<br />
The nearest analogy I can get is that the<br />
Soviets moving into Afghanistan is the same as Germany moving<br />
into the Rhineland. If it does get the appropriate response from<br />
the United States, from the Western Alliance, from France and<br />
Germany and Britain, supported to the extent that we can by<br />
countries such as Australia, recognising the limits of what<br />
14 million people can do, then I believe that terrible process<br />
will not be set in train and we can secure the safety of our<br />
nations, the safety of independent people. Our sons and<br />
daughters will not have to put on uniforms. As I understand it,<br />
that is what President Carter is all about. That is what was<br />
clearly referred to in the Franco-German communique where both<br />
those leaders referred to Afghanistan in terms which said that<br />
they feared that whatever people's motives might be, it would set<br />
in step, in phase, a process which step by step would have the<br />
gravest possible consequences for mankind., That was their way of<br />
describing what could be the first step in other moves that<br />
could really push the human race wver the edge of the cliff.<br />
Now, that really is why we believe it is so important. I am<br />
quite certain that is why President Carter has acted as he has,<br />
why other nations have spoken as they have. It is not because<br />
we believe that a war of that kind is imminent. / 2<br />

Prime minister ( continued)<br />
But we do believe that democracies, independent peoples, need<br />
to have a collective determination, a commitment, to their own<br />
faith, to their own way of life, and be prepared to make some<br />
effort and if you like, some sacrifice to secure it for the<br />
future.<br />
Colville You say that you and Mr. Carter don't necessarily think that<br />
a war may be imminent, but it does sound as if you are saying<br />
that what you are about is staving off, or making sure that<br />
World War Three doesn't happen. Is that going too far?<br />
PrimeMinister-I think that is exactly what the President is about, I really do:<br />
to see that it does not happen, to see that step by step there<br />
is not a chain reaction after Afghanistan which causes that to<br />
happen. Let's again go back to the thirties for a moment. There<br />
was a complete loss of will, loss of determination, loss of<br />
direction by France and Britain, and the United States just<br />
was not concerned with Europe and what was happening. They<br />
thought they could be an island unto themselves, that it was not<br />
really relevant. How sadly they learnt that that was not true<br />
some years later. One of the great difficulties in a democracy. is we~<br />
Are peace-loving people, we do not really like seeing money spent<br />
on armaments. We would much sooner spend it on other things.<br />
There are enormous pressures to believe the world is as we want<br />
it to be and not just as it is. Now, the Soviet invasion of<br />
Afghanistan has pulled us all up with a sudden sharp jolt. We<br />
suddenly realise there are dangers in the world, that a people<br />
can be destroyed, that armies can march. What we are about is<br />
seeing that the aggressor is not so encouraged by lack of reaction,<br />
lack of determination.-and the United States supported by many<br />
other nations around the world not so encouraged by a lack of<br />
reaction that they think we can take another step and another,<br />
which would, as happened in the thirties, ultimately brought a<br />
massive reaction'which of course led to World World So<br />
while I don't think anyone says things of that kind are imminent,<br />
because that would be foolish and overstating the issue, if there<br />
is not an appropriate and sustained Western independent,-nation<br />
reaction to Afghanistan, I do indeed have the gravest cause for<br />
concern about the future.<br />
Colville A lot of Australians are now asking why the Olympics. Why not,<br />
if you are going to take a stand like this one, not cut of f<br />
diplomatic relations, expel diplomats. Why the Olympics. What<br />
is so important about the Olympics?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Let me deal with the why not and I will come to the Olympics in<br />
just a moment. Nobody is out to humiliate the Soviet Union. That<br />
would not help in establishing that more stable and more peaceful,<br />
* more secure world that we want to. Lines of communication have<br />
to stay open. We need to make sure that the signals that get<br />
to the Soviet Union are clear signals. When I say I mean<br />
principally the United States, but Europe also and to the extent<br />
-that we can, countries like Australia. The signals need to be<br />
clear ones. They need to be ones which say " nobody offers any<br />
./ 3 </p>

Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
threat to the Soviet Union. Nobody seeks to encircle the<br />
Soviet Union . Nobody wants to force the Soviet Union to live<br />
apart. But everyone has to comply with certain rules of<br />
international behaviour. The first of those rules is respect<br />
to the integrity and independence of peoples. So, to cut off<br />
all communications, all diplomatic relations, would not help<br />
in getting that message through. It really would not. It might<br />
be a good, emotional reaction if you like, but it would not<br />
assist in the larger and vastly important objective. We need<br />
sustained signals over a long period, maybe over years, to the<br />
Soviet Union which are co-ordinated, consistent, which do not give<br />
them cause for concern or fear but which at the same time let<br />
them know very plainly that the United States and others are<br />
vastly determined, and will not shake in their conviction. Therefore,<br />
if the Soviet Union presses too far there will be a great reaction.<br />
Now, that. is the way to establish security so that, if you like,<br />
why we do not do certain things, why we do not shut off and<br />
isolate the Soviet Union totally.<br />
In trade, our actions are consistent with the United States and<br />
the United Kingdom and other countries. They will remain so.<br />
They have been quite considerable in certain areas. But there is<br />
little point, against the background I have just described, of<br />
Australia taking unilateral action which is not going to be<br />
supported by other countries around the world, which would then<br />
just have an economic consequence for Australia, but which would<br />
have little or no impact on the Soviet Union. Here, I think we<br />
need to understand the trade sanctions can in fact to a<br />
significant extent be hidden from the Soviet people by the<br />
Government of the Soviet -Union. Now, even if they are short of<br />
wheat, and there are difficulties, they can say for example,<br />
crops have failed in America and Canada and Australia and that is<br />
why we cannot get wheat, not letting them know that it is a mark<br />
of extreme disapproval. -But if you come to the Olympic Gamnes,<br />
that is a very public'event. It is very plain. For years all<br />
the people of the Soviet Union have been told that this is going<br />
to be a great event,-with the athletes of the world coming to<br />
Moscow to pay-homage to Moscow'and to the Russian people and to<br />
the first Socialist State of the world. Therefore, they are<br />
expecting the athletes of all nations to go. It is the Soviet<br />
Union that has said it is a great political event, the mark<br />
of approval for the Soviet Union, it is indeed a mark of approval<br />
of the Soviet foreign policy. Now, you do not believe that,<br />
and I do not believe that, but it is what the Soviet people will<br />
be told that counts. So, if Australian athletes go, if American<br />
young men and women go to Moscow, it is quite plain that all the<br />
people of the Soviet Union will be told, especially after recent<br />
events, that the athletes of Australia, the United States and<br />
of other countries are plainly repudiating their own governments<br />
and their own peoples, their own systems and by their presence<br />
in Moscow they are affirming support for the first Socialist State.<br />
That would then bolster the Soviet Government and Soviet people<br />
in the conviction in what they are doing. But if they do not go,<br />
there is something that the Soviet Government then has to<br />
explain. Why is it that the United States, and if it falls that<br />
way, the British, the Germans and the Australians, why is it that<br />
they have not come to Moscow. After the publicity of the last two<br />
or three years, the Government of the Soviet Union I think would have<br />
some difficulty in explaining that to their own people. There </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
would be questions raised and difficulties caused. That, as<br />
we all believe, those who have studied the Soviet Union, would<br />
be the most effective way of bringing the abhorrence of the<br />
free and independent world over the invasion of Afghanistan home<br />
to the Government of Russia and to all the peoples of Russia.<br />
That is why we have argued this cause so strongly.<br />
Colville You and Mr. Anthony have explained in detail why any trade<br />
bans, overall, not just unilateral, to be effective. But can you<br />
understand the Australian people feeling a little cynical that<br />
athletes have to carry the can while the miners and the farmers<br />
apparently go ahead, export their products, and make their<br />
money. Prime Minister<br />
Well, there are restrictions on grain sales, as you know.<br />
Look ' I can understand that feeling and I have enormous sympathy<br />
for athletes in relation to it, but when you look at the larger<br />
issues, the objective which I indicated the United States and<br />
other countries are trying to achieve for a safer and a more<br />
secure world, I do not believe it is asking those athletes to<br />
give up too much, I really do not. Because if the free nations.<br />
of the world, again the United States in the vanguard as they have<br />
to be because it is only they who have the power, but Australia<br />
and many others in support, if we fail in our objective of<br />
establishing-that more secure world what then happens to the many<br />
young men and women who might ultimately have to put on a uniform.<br />
If, looking back through the pages of near history in four or<br />
five years' time and athletes had gone to Moscow and won a medal<br />
and the Soviets were given their propaganda victory, their<br />
propaganda triumph in relation to their own people, if their own<br />
conviction and their righteousness was thus reinforced, and if<br />
they were thus encouraged to pursue by different ways other<br />
Afghanistans, and if that did lead to a much greater disaster,<br />
I do not believe any of those athletes ever after would really<br />
be able to live with their own conscience in what they had helped<br />
achieve. Colville<br />
What has been your reaction to the way that your Olympic boycott<br />
proposals have been received, I suppose not so much in the<br />
electorate because we know that, but say the Parliament, the<br />
Parliamentary debate on it.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think the debate was, in a large sense, a very disappointing<br />
one, because as I believe anyway, the opposition trivialised the<br />
debate. We have spoken about the great issues that are in front<br />
of us, that we are trying to do something about. The Opposition<br />
to a man while condemning the invasion of Afghanistan then seemed<br />
more concerned to try and demonstrate that my motives were, in </p>
<p>5<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
condemning the invasion of Afghanistan, were the wrong motives.<br />
Now, I just do not think that they are prepared to condemn<br />
the invasion of Afghanistan. We do, so why cannot it just be<br />
let at that with a bi-partisan approach to a vastly important<br />
matter. In the end, the House passed, really without dissent<br />
on this particular point, a resolution which said that countries<br />
ought to do what they Can separately or in concert to bring home<br />
our great opposition to the Soviet Union. Then, having supported<br />
that section of the resolution, why does the Labor Party seek<br />
to oppose everything that we have done in a practical way that<br />
will bring that message home to the Soviet Union. Mr. Hayden says<br />
that an effective boycott just as I have would bring the<br />
mood of free peoples home to the Soviet Union more effectively<br />
than anything else that we could do. In those circumstances, why<br />
does he do everything he possibly can to see that an effective<br />
boycott is not brought about. It is not good enough to say,<br />
look, there is an effective boycott, I will join it. If you<br />
believe an effective boycott will send the message to the Soviet<br />
Union you have got to work for it. That is what the Government<br />
is doing and that is what the Government will continue to do.<br />
I think the debate, and many of the attitudes that were<br />
expressed unfortunately trivialised a great and fundamental issue.<br />
I think that is regrettable. 000---</p>
