<p>DEVELOPMENT OF GAS AND OIL DISCOVERIES IN BASS STRAIT<br />STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />The Commonwealth has reached an agreement with the<br />Victorian Government designed to allow production of gas and oil from the<br />Barracouta and Marlin fields of the BHP/ Esso Companies to be achieved<br />at the earliest possible date.<br />This agreement provides that production leases will be<br />granted immediately to the companies under Victorian law, and<br />subsequently replaced by tit les granted by the State and the Commonwealth<br />under the proposed joint legislation.<br />From its discussions with the State and on the advice<br />available to it from its own authorities, the Commonwealth has concluded<br />that in the national interest the development of these two fields both the<br />production of natural gas to meet requirements in Victoria and<br />exploitation of the very substantial oil find in the Marlin field should<br />proceed without delay. This development will involve a very large<br />investment of the order of $ 150 m. The availability of natural gas on<br />a large scale to industries and households in Melbourne and surrounding<br />areas represents a major innovation which will bring great benefits.<br />The effect upon Australia's balance of payments will also be substantial<br />because of savings of foreign exchange through the use of oil and gas<br />produced from an Australian field for the Australian market.<br />The Commo~ awealth has over a period been working out<br />with the States a common code for the exploitation of off -shore oil and<br />gas. Commonwealth Ministers have recently been discussing with<br />State Ministers the possibility of additional provisions within the common<br />code which would offer to a company making a discovery an alternative<br />to the requirement that it would have to relinquish part of its area.<br />These alternative arrangements would allow a company to retain the<br />whole of a location in return for the payment of an additional royalty<br />( known as an override royalty' over and above the standard ten per cent<br />royalty previously agreed between the Commonwealth and the States.</p>
<p>The arrangements which have now been agreed with the<br />Victorian Government will give effect to this type of alternative in the<br />case of the BHP/ Esso discoveries at Barracouta and Marlin. An override<br />royalty of one per cent has been imposed by Victoria and is payable to the<br />State. The Commonwealth has also accepted as part of the<br />arrangements covering these BEP/ Esso discoveries that the standard ten<br />per cent royalty should be divided on the basis that Victoria would receive<br />six per cent and the Commonwealth four per cent instead of the equal<br />division as previously agreed between the Commonwealth and the States.<br />The Premiers of the other States have been informed of the<br />agreement entered into with Victoria in rce spect of these BHP/ Essa discoveries.<br />The Commonwealth wil be continuing its discussions with the States<br />in order to reach finality on the provisions of the common code on a basis<br />which will allow the most effective development of Australia' s off -shore<br />resources of oil and gas.</p>
