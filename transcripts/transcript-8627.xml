PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
COLLINGWOOD FOOTBALL CLUB POST-BUDGET LUNCHEON,<br />
MELBOURNE, 24 AUGUST 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thanks very much Allan ( McAlister), distinguished members of the Collingwood<br />
Club, supporters, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Well I was at 4,539 not so long ago, that's where I started, he told mc no ones good<br />
enough to hold number one in Collingwood so I've advanced from 4,539 to 101; 1<br />
regard that as a real complement indeed. Thanks very much Al and can I say that it<br />
is nice to be associated with Melbourne again and to be sharing the table, not just<br />
with Allan by with my colleague and friend, the Premier Joan Kirner.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Allan just mentioned Tony saying now he knows what it's<br />
like to be a beetle, I spend my time these days between football clubs; Canterbury-<br />
Bankstown in Sydney and Collingwood in Melbourne and I was up in Cantcrbury-<br />
Bankstown last week launching a biography of another tough little player, captain<br />
Terry Lamb, captain of the Canterbury-Bankstown side and at the end of the<br />
biography, the biographer who wrote the book said put a question to him, he said<br />
how would you like to be remembered? He's a little short guy about 5" 5 and he<br />
said tough as nails he said, how would you like to be remembered Terry? He said<br />
tall. And they said you're a streaky, long lank, what were you doing in rugby<br />
league? I said I was on the wing, they said well why didn't you continuc in the<br />
league? I said well I wanted to do something tougher, so I joined the ALP. And<br />
here I am.<br />
1 / 10" d V700" ON' 17 V 6 6nu-s -13 </p>
<p>And that's why I suppose I like the organisations which have a great sense of<br />
tradition and particularly in the clubs who involve their players and also involve<br />
their supporters. And whether it's Collingwood or Hawthorn or Canterbury-<br />
Bankstown or St George the thing that's common about those sorts of club is it's the<br />
old values of the community, the family and the club that holds the show together<br />
where the players are part of it, where the supporters are considered, Allan was just<br />
talking about the 40,000 at Vic Park on Grand Final night where everybody has a<br />
piece of it and where the values go on from year to year and are held down. I mean<br />
even though football clubs are apolitical in Victoria, it's well known in the dark<br />
recesses of Collingwood's history it's had associations with Labor figures and to<br />
have a Labor Prime Minister again associated again keeps that traditional value<br />
their, that old link which has been there.<br />
But despite the values the community and the family and the links with the players<br />
and the traditions, the clubs can also be dynamic and modem and innovative and<br />
we can see that with an old club winning the flag with one of the best<br />
managements of any club in the AFL which is innovative as Allan says, he carries<br />
the weight, they cross the four million mark because Collingwood's past the one<br />
million, they fund the clubs 350,000 or something to the other clubs. They can be<br />
innovative and modern and strong and still be traditional. So they're held together<br />
by tradition and strong values and the same can be said of successful countries.<br />
That is at the end of the decade of the ' 80s, the decade which finished off<br />
monetarism and finished off communism, where we had those two competing<br />
ideologies dead in the water, in the case of one after 70 years and the case of the<br />
other after about 15 or<br />
What we've seen emerge as a successful model, world wide around the world are<br />
the social democracies and just a couple of weeks ago I had a breakfast with<br />
Michel Rocard who was a former President of France and the likely contender for<br />
the French presidency from the Left of politics after Mitterrand. a moderate person<br />
from the Social Democratic Party of France and he was talking about the success<br />
today, the complexities of running a modern society and the clear role for<br />
Government that there has to be in government being involved in making a society<br />
tick, no eschewing a role for government suggesting that there's some sort of pure<br />
market approach where private initiative and private reward is all that needs to be<br />
there to make a society to tick. But one where there's a happy mix between<br />
efficient economies and at the same time a comprehensive social policy married to<br />
it and this is the role of the Social Democratic Parties which are now I think,<br />
becoming clear in a way the model in this sort of post-monetarist, post-communist<br />
era and where people arc brought in and are made to become part or \\ wihai<br />
TT/ ZO'd VOO* ONVO: VT Z6' 6nUSG:-131 </p>
<p>happening in the nation where it works at its best where we're not wasting talent<br />
and where we can see people really feel as though they are part of the whole thing.<br />
I think rather than to speak about the Budg~ et directly and I will in some respects, I<br />
just thought I'd address these values, that is that ideology today is a luxury. The<br />
difficult thing in any society today is gctting that economic growth, getting the<br />
employment and at the same time distributing the wealth. We've always<br />
distributed the wealth in western societies through employment, by and large<br />
through employment. But we're coming to a period where as we are now an<br />
external ly orientated country the focus is on eroductivi1X and it's on efficiency and<br />
that means producing more output for fewer people. A given level of output is<br />
produced by a smaller workforce and if that doesn't mean a pcrmanenft pool of<br />
unemployment, it must mean more output because if we are going to be producing<br />
a greater lcvel of output with fewer peoplc, how are we then to take the people up?<br />
How are we to hold a society together, to not develop for the first time in our<br />
history an underclass of people who are not wanted by society. How do we keep<br />
them in? And the answer is by just growing the thing faster. But how do you grow<br />
it faster and not have wages spill over into inflation, demand spill ovcr into<br />
imports, all the other problems which come with high growth and these are the<br />
complex things that we have to deal with.<br />
This morning I had the pleasure of presenting the -Best -Practice Awards which<br />
were recommended by a Committee set up under a Commonwcalth program<br />
chaired by the Managing Director of BHIP and in there we saw a stack of<br />
companies Toyota, Du Pont, BlIP ct cetera presented with awards for introducing<br />
best practice into divisions, into their companies in general, in divisions of their<br />
companies. And you could see these people all wading through how to produce<br />
and efficient business, how to gct the right investment in the right place, how to<br />
reduce your costs, how to improve the management structure, how to make it<br />
leaner, more efficient, how to get hetter work practices, how to relate to the<br />
employees. Nearly cvcry company that was there had the shop steward or the<br />
union person from the division reprcsented with them today and you can sce that<br />
co-operation moving, the efficicncies growing as thosc companies, many of which<br />
now actually have divisions around thc world, are bringing best practice from their<br />
overseas subsidiarics back into Australia to benchmark against for the way in<br />
which their Australian division operate% or the companies that are wvell and now the<br />
international leadcrs. We've got a couple there today who are international leaders;<br />
one a maker of spectacle optics which is actually the world leader so who does it<br />
benchmark against but itself? But all this sort of quest for efficiency which is what<br />
it has to be about for a country trying to build a new position for itself in the world<br />
as a tradcr of manufactures and a trader of services, the Sheraton Hotel for instance<br />
TT/ MOd V700ON I VO: LT Z6' 6nb&amp; SZ :-131 </p>
<p>was presented the same because they are trading a service and in their hotels they<br />
picked up a Best Practice Award.<br />
So it's a case of trying to do these things so societal advance in the era of mi -cro<br />
processing, robotics, where so much which was done formcrly by people are now<br />
done -by machinesis going to be complex and it's going to be difficult and there's<br />
going to be no one simple solution. Yet the notion that some ideology whether it<br />
be Adam Smith or whoever, or survival of the fittest, or the market knows best or<br />
some simple solution where government is assured and where we are not together<br />
working as a society as the club works, to the players and to the supporters as we<br />
work to the players in our businesses, to the workers or to the customers or<br />
however it might be, if we're not running as a whole wc are not going to make it.<br />
We're not going to be able to do this by some resort to ideology or some simple<br />
view. We need in this country more output. That means more investment. -How do you<br />
get more investment if you're not competitive? What's the key ingredient in<br />
competitiveness? Basically the inflation rate. How do you keep it? Basically by<br />
co-operation, consensus and agreement. You can't keep it by a draconian money<br />
bank with a flame thrower burning business off the pavement, you can only keep a<br />
low inflation rate by agreement, you can't do it basically by regarding the<br />
workforce as enemies of the management and if that's the view, we certainly won't<br />
make it. If the inflation rate is low, the interest rates will be low, and we've now<br />
got bill rates in this country at 5 and 3/ 4 per cent, that's not all flowed through for<br />
those who borrow, but as time goes by, as those margins come down it will, but<br />
we've already seen lower reductions in rates and we can now go through with<br />
lower interest rates. The same in that investment equation for more out put is<br />
depreciation, you've got to have a tax system that works, a depreciation schedule<br />
which is competitive with the rest in the world. Profits have to be good to spur<br />
investment. How do we get a high profit share good enough to refire investment?<br />
Answer: by national agreement about the division of national income. What<br />
proportion of national income goes to profits? What proportion goes to labour?<br />
And just last week I opencd ncgotiations up with the ACTU where for the first time<br />
in our history, nearly three quarters of all wage settlements in this country in the<br />
coming twelve months will be done by enterprise bargaining, by enterprise<br />
agreements and not by a national wage case where we're seeing another leap in our<br />
maturity so that we can negotiate and bargain our way through. But underlying<br />
that, in the end result is a profit share which is high enough to kick investment over<br />
again. And then of course, we can't do all these things if we don't have the savings. So<br />
what are we going to do0? Be out with the savings bowl in the 1990s when China,<br />
Tt/ t7O* d 17QO* O N17O: VT Z6* 6nU' S-131 </p>
<p>the old Soviet states, India, South America rejoin the world economy and look for<br />
savings to invest in their industries, because no matter how competitive we are, no<br />
matter how low our inflation rate, no matter how great our expectations, if we don't<br />
have the savings we won't be able to develop as quickly as we might otherwiise and<br />
we'ye now put into place through occupational superannuation a savings pool<br />
which will stand Australia in great stead through the 1990s, so that can happen.<br />
And the same with rcsearch and developmcnt, and with education. We're not going<br />
to be able to produce more output and run the current account deficit down and<br />
pick up more employment in an economy where only 3 kids in 10 complete<br />
secondary school. That's as it was in 1983, that's now 7 in 10 this year, it will 9 in<br />
In a few years from now and by now not only reforming tertiary education, but<br />
by now recently reformed technical and further education, a role in the which the<br />
Premier played a leading role producing a new national training authority to do for<br />
vocational education what we've been able to do for tcrtiary education, picking up<br />
the advantage of those higher participation rates will actually produce the kind of<br />
educated workforce that you must have to produce the output in the goads we want<br />
to produce in.<br />
We want to play in the international division of labour which brings wealth to<br />
Australia and that means selling product innovation, it essentially means selling<br />
our brains. We don't want to be playing in the international division of labour in<br />
the countries nearby, I don't want to see Australians compete with Indonesians, in<br />
cities like Surabaya where the wage per week for a scmi-skilled process worker is<br />
$ 7ust a week operating state of the art equipment. We can't compete in those<br />
products and to try and push Australian living standards down to try and make it<br />
compete is the wrong way to go. The thing to do is sell the product they can't make<br />
and that's the product which has the natural advantage of our education system,<br />
because even though we wish these countries well in their development it will take<br />
them 50 years, even if they wish to try to catch up to us in education, research and<br />
development, scientific application, applied research and the sort of things we are<br />
capable of doing.<br />
So it's going to be complex, so today when you see the Du Pont's and the BHP's<br />
and the Toyota's and I was at Ford a couple of weeks ago, climbing up those<br />
efficiency levcls and producing products which are bcnchmarked and proccsses<br />
which arc benchmarkcd around the world, it's all part of an inflation, interest rates<br />
depreciation, profit, savings,_ R&amp; D education equation; it doesn't happen with some<br />
ideology, it's not going to happen with a consumption tax and our opponents are<br />
saying put in a consumption tax,-all that-will hc solved. That is we go from a<br />
simple change from taxing income to expenditure, all of a suddcn thc inflation,<br />
interest rate, depreciation, profits, savings, R&amp; D education equation changes<br />
tOOON'VO: VI Z6* 6nU* S132:-131 </p>
<p>overnight. Well of course it doesn't and we're now on the way to actually make<br />
those changes.<br />
I think many Australians forget how far we've come. In 1983 GiDP in this country<br />
was $ 200 billion, this year it will be $ 430 billion. In 1983 there were 6 million<br />
people employed in the Australian workforce, this year it's 7.6 million, it's over<br />
per cent larger than it was in 1983. We often hear people telling us about New<br />
Zealand and how we should adopt their policies. In 1983 when I became<br />
Treasurer, and compared to now the workforce of New Zealand is actually smaller<br />
than it was in 1983. There are fewer people employed in New Zealand today than<br />
there were in 1983. In Australia there's 26 per cent more people employed than<br />
there was in 1983. We had more growth in the Australian economy in the 1980s<br />
than there is total product in the New Zealand economy, that is we had more<br />
growth in our economy than there is total product in that economy across the<br />
Tasman. That's not to belittle them, it's just to make the point don't deprecate what<br />
we've done, people should not deprecate the great successes that we've had and the<br />
same in manufacturing, it's doubled. Manufacturing exports have tripled, exports<br />
of elaborately transformed manufactures have tripled, manufacturing exports this<br />
year are greater than rural exports or mining exports for the first time in our<br />
history. Services have tripled since 1985.<br />
These arc great changes, all important changes in those milestones along the way<br />
of moving along. Now, we believe in this country you can't produce the sort of<br />
society that gives you those sorts of outcomes where there's access to cducation,<br />
whcre you're producing a workforce which is educated to a high standard, where<br />
there are opportunities for employment, where there is high profits, where there is a<br />
decent basis of our productive wealth without having a safety net in there. That is,<br />
decent social policies as well, access to hospitalisation and medical care, as a right.<br />
Not if you can pay for it, as a right. Acccss to education, If you are a kid from a<br />
poor family but you have got it upstairs and you want to do something with<br />
yourself, you get the right. You don't get the right only if your parents can afford<br />
$ 20,000 a year to pay for a fee paying place in the university.<br />
These arc the sort of policies which will crush off the consensus, that view where<br />
the players and the supportcrs have a role in running the club. Because I think if<br />
the players and supporters think that it is only for the club executives, and for the<br />
Captain and the Coach, and the rest of them arc on the outer then what will happen<br />
is that club will diminish very quickly. And the club of Australia will diminish<br />
very quickly if that h ard-hearted-view -that therc is no place to look after people, a<br />
view which was expressed by my colleague, the Opposition leader, thc other night.<br />
When I said a week ago we have got to lean down and pull thosc who arc weak and<br />
poor behind us, hc said if you lean down you will go back with them, you will end<br />
t700" ON'L70: tT Z6SfluVsz 131 </p>
<p>up mediocre like they are. That's not the view that will hold Australia together.<br />
What will hold Australia together is saying we have an egalitarian spirit in this<br />
country, a spirit of fairniess, a spirit of sharing. Not everyone is going to be equal,<br />
but there is a place for everybody. You can put a roof over your head. If you are<br />
sick you get looked after. If you have got kids they go to school, and opportunities<br />
are going to be there for you.<br />
John Hewso n promised us in his Budget reply the other night, a Hong Kong tax<br />
system. But what he didn't tell us is what you get with it, it is a Hofng K-ong social<br />
security system, a Hong Kong housing system, a Hong Kong health system and the<br />
rest. That's not to deprecate Hong Kong, we should admire the success that colony<br />
has had in changing itself to become one of the tigers in the world.-But the fact is,<br />
I don't want to see people on Australian unemployment benefits on $ 32.00 a week.<br />
I don't want to see Australian pensioners on $ 50.00 a week, as they are in Hong<br />
Kong. And by the way, Hong Kong doesn't have a consumption tax, it's kicking<br />
along without one, I don't want to sec that happen to Australians.<br />
We are, bar a decimal point, the lowest taxed country in the OECD. There is only<br />
a decimal point that separates Australia from Japan as the lowest taxed country in<br />
the OECD. We have now got one of the smallest public sectors in the world, but<br />
one of the best. A rcally efficient public sector that looks after people and so this is<br />
the way I believe that we have got to keep thc social wage together, if you want the<br />
high profit share, you want the low inflation rate, the better levels of productivity,<br />
the social wage has got to be there. Medicare, aged care, child care, occupational<br />
superannuation, access to education, these are all part of the fabric of thc place we<br />
as Australia. And to get that fabric and teat it, and rip it, will produce a social<br />
reaction the likes of which we have not experienced.<br />
And the great gains of the ' 80s, and coming from a closed l ittle frightened economy<br />
to an open aggressive thing that is out in the world trading, that must trade on its<br />
inflation rate, its exchange rate, its competitiveness, its tax system, its profit share<br />
-all of that is put a risk if people take thc view that survival of the fittest, if you are<br />
not a millionaire you arc a layabout, and if the system is not for you a few crumbs<br />
fall of the table, that's for the others. If that's the view then I don't think there is<br />
very much left.<br />
Now, in the Budget we put in a couple of important changes. We spent another<br />
billion over the course of the year onigbs-Now, John HeIwson says they are<br />
ntot-real jobs, -they are jobs that have come -off the public sector. But at atime whcn<br />
privatc investment is down, as it is in the State of Victoria, and where thc Budget<br />
deficit is now $ 13.4 billion, Dr H-ewson is advocating that we should cut it back by<br />
$ 7 billion, 2 per ccrit of GDP. You just imagine what that would do to this State.<br />
TT/ e . O'd V0OOON VO: L7T Z6.-6flt-sz </p>
<p>What it would do to the recove. y2 it would kill it stone dead to take $ 7 billion out<br />
of those natural stabilising in the Budget. That is, the payment on unemployrpncpt<br />
benefits, the general Commonwealth spending, the loss receipts, and'the spending<br />
on labour market programs. This year those lahour market programs will take 400,<br />
000 people through them. 400, 000 unemployed Australians will get training, and<br />
or a job as a result of those programs. And why wouldn't we take those people who<br />
have been unemployed for six or nine months, get them the training and give them<br />
the job experience, and the Job Start support, wvage subsidy provided to them so<br />
they can go and get that work experience and then go on to keep that job? Why<br />
wouldn't we do it? Why wouldn't we do it when the national economic condition<br />
demands we should do it?<br />
Also we made a substantial change to Medicare. We are going to spend $ 2.6<br />
billion over six years on Medicare to make it easier for public patients to have<br />
access to public hospitals. So that elective surgery, but important elective surgery,<br />
particularly for the elderly like hip replacements and things which are not acute,<br />
but which are vital, but are in a sense elective, can be catered for without long<br />
waiting lists and so that Medicare is working bettcr. Medicare is running at 8 per<br />
cent of-D . it is one of thc most cost efficient health systems in the world. The<br />
American system is running at over twelve per eent of GDP. In thc United States if<br />
you arrive at a hospital door without your blue cross card in your pocket they turn<br />
you away. Even it you have got a cardiac condition, or whatever it might be, if you<br />
don't have the card, out.<br />
That's not Australia, that's not what we are used to. And that's not what we are<br />
going to have.<br />
So, we havc got a big change in there which will mean that Medicare is a universal<br />
system that gives you medical consultations, 85 per cent rebate, no cost if it is a<br />
hulk billing doctor, and better access through the public hospitals of Australia for<br />
public patients. And also utilising the privatc hospital system better, and also a<br />
program in there to look after waiting lists and bctter distribute the demand for<br />
services betwecn hospital by a computer booking systemn and the rest. As well as<br />
that we have got an incecase for pensioners, singles and married, $ 6.00 and 10.00<br />
a fortnight. We have offered fringe benefits to all pensioners, including part<br />
pensioners, which is a mile stone change in the Budget, rent assistance, improving<br />
rent assistance by better targeting it which will affect 70, 000 people who are often<br />
not well off, who are basically in thc lower income orders who are sitting in there,<br />
in our social security system, and who can deal with that support.<br />
Now thcse arc the sorts of things the Budget has cast I think exactly right for the<br />
time, exactly right for the time. That is, we have got the deficit out at a time where<br />
11/ 80' d VOO'ON VOV :. 131 </p>
<p>private spending is down, wc are trying to inject activity, and all the One Nation<br />
spending is starting to come through. Two wecks ago we ordered 3 million tonnes<br />
of rail steel to build that railway line between Melbourne and Adelaide. We<br />
ordered a million concrete sle~ epers, we have announced a $ 2 billion road program,<br />
$ 400 million then last year and Australia is starting to move again. We had 1.6 per<br />
cent economic growth for the year to June and we are forecasting 3 for this current<br />
financial year ending the 30 June 1993, so the economy is starting to move along<br />
again. In fact, we are now moving faster then Western Europe and the United<br />
States. I mean, I think a lot of people don't understand this is a very large, worldwide<br />
recession we arc experiencing, and a colleague of mine came back from the<br />
United States last week and said, in Australia it is not to be compared with the<br />
atmospherics of the United States in the business community and the community in<br />
general. And in Britain, for instance this year, we finished the year to Junc with<br />
1.6 per cent growth, they finished the year to June with -1.5 per cent growth.<br />
T'here economy contracted by 1.5 per cent over the year to June. So, we are<br />
starting to grow and we have got it going.<br />
Now, we had this debate the other wcek, we said that our starting point, we are<br />
proving tax cuts in 1994-94 and 1995-96, but because the receipts fell away this<br />
year our starting point deficit out there is around the order of $ 5 to $ 6 billion, and<br />
we said we will introduce some compliance measures to improve the starting point<br />
deficit if needs be, if in the end as forecasts the starting point is weaker. Dr<br />
Hewson ran round saying Labor has got secret taxes, these wcre taxes which we<br />
revealed in the Budget paper. Nothing secret about them, but were revealed in the<br />
Budget papers. But of course what he didn't say was this, that the income tax of<br />
Australia is $ 49 billion, the revenue for the income tax system is $ 49 billion. He<br />
wants to introduce a consumption tax at $ 27 billion, it is over half the income tax.<br />
It might be 15 per cent on all goods and services, but it is actually 50 per cent plus<br />
of the current income tax. None of that consumption tax revenue is going to be<br />
paid for, is going to pay for the tax cuts. It is spent wholly on the abolition of<br />
payroll tax and cutting cxcise on petrol, and paying for the lost customs duty which<br />
somes from zero tariffs, and abolishing the wholesale sales tax. None of it goes to<br />
tax cuts. He has got tax cuts in there worth $ 13 billion that have got to be paid for<br />
by cuts in Government spending. So, he is going to cut into, into a Budget of<br />
around $ 110 billion, he is going to cut $ 13 billion out of outlays and that is all<br />
going to happen basically in the welfare area, in the social security and health area.<br />
So, wc are going to hop into all of that to give people tip the top end a tax cut and<br />
try and hold the show together, and at the same time his starting point is exactly the<br />
same starting point we are starting with. That is, wcrc he to win the next election,<br />
and we think that is an unlikely prospect, not withstanding our relative positions at<br />
thc moment, the starting point in 1994-95, 1995-96 is still going to bc as we have<br />
it. That is, ahout 1 1/ 4 per ccnt of GDP and deficit. So, not only has he got to find<br />
t00O0N tO: VT7 z&amp; 6nu~ sz 131 </p>
<p>$ 13 billion for tax cuts, but he has also got to find a couple of billion as we have to<br />
find it out there to start with the same strength in fiscal policy from when the tax<br />
cuts are paid. So, hc has got a sort of $ 12 to $ 15 billion Budget cutting task on his<br />
hands which to date has sort of been hushed up in the media, but once that big<br />
consumption tax hits the economy, the inflation rate, the interest rates, and they<br />
start then ripping away at Medicare he is going to abolish that he said, basically<br />
let the Doctors sct there common fee and charge what they like and you can all<br />
privately insure yourselves which will cost you $ 20.00 to $ 30.00 a week at least to<br />
do that when he starts ripping away at money in the education system, and things<br />
like child care and age care, home and community care, the hostel program,<br />
nursing homes, they all get hopped into and we then wheel out the survival of the<br />
fittest ideology and say this is the way forward, people then turn around and say,<br />
listen mate that was a way forward in 1979 when Thatcher was becoming Prime<br />
Minister; that was the way forward before monctarism was discredited in Europe;<br />
that was the way forward before the social values of social democracies around the<br />
world re-established themselves in the late ' 80s and early 1990s.<br />
So that's what I think all this is about. We have introduced a Budget which is about<br />
right for the economy at this time, letting the shock absorber of the Budget take<br />
some of the strain of the economy, until the economy picks up. Still making those<br />
social changes, national training authority, building the rail highway, f&amp; Xing up the<br />
airline system, creating a proper market for electricity down the East Coast of<br />
Australia by separating power generation from distribution. Repairing Medicare,<br />
getting that strength in there into the public hospital access. Getting those higher<br />
participation rates coming through in schools. These are the social advances we in<br />
the Labor Party continue with, because we want you in the business community to<br />
feel as those you are playing for a club whcre everybody matters: where the<br />
players matter, and where the supporters matter, and whether it be the employers or<br />
the employees, whoever it is, they have all got a role in Australia; that this is a<br />
society where we have a role. So, those values of egalitarianism, as I mentioned at<br />
the start, the family valucs, the traditions of the club are important traditions, and<br />
nonc of us in the political system put them asunder without putting society as we<br />
know it, and the mores as we know them, at risk. And that's why this Budget is<br />
very much a traditional Labor Budget. Very much in the groove, very much about<br />
doing the right things now for Australia. And I just hate to think of the State of<br />
Victoria with a federal Budget with $ 6 to $ 7 or $ 8 billion cut out of it. Watching<br />
their recovery then plummet back into a recession and see the then secondary wave<br />
of damage go through the place, and the secondary wave of despair and gloom.<br />
We're getting out of it, the thing to do now is to come out of it, and don't belicve<br />
that there are simple ideological solutions for the complex task of building a new<br />
industrial socicty for ourselves. We can do it, but wc will only do it the hard way.<br />
And that's all those changes we were talking about at the Best Practice Program </p>
<p>this morning. All those efficiencies things, getting the workforce to work better,<br />
bettcr management, better barmonisation, making it all come together. So, that's<br />
what the Budget is about, it is a scrious attempt, I would like to say to you by<br />
serious people, about seeing Australia through a difficult transition into a very<br />
bright 1990s. A low inflationary environment, with low interest rates, high level<br />
investment, a banking system which has learned its lessons about asset prices and<br />
inflation, a stock of savings, and living in the fastest growing part of the world the<br />
Asia Pacific, with a society all committed to the one goals. So, in the big club, the<br />
club that matters most, Australia, in the Premiership we are after is for the high<br />
income shares around the world in the Asia-Pacific. And not scrabbling down<br />
there in the prelims after a low income share scrabbling with someone else about<br />
the sort of goods we shouldn't bc producing anymore. T7hat's the Australia we want<br />
to produce in, that's why the Budget is simply part of that wholc ethos of playing to<br />
the traditions, the well establishcd traditions of this country.<br />
Thank you<br />
