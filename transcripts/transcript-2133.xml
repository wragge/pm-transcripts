EMBARGO: 8. 50 p. m. on 21 October 1969 PARTY TV INTERVIEW NO. 3<br />
1969 FEDERAL ELECTION<br />
TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON, FOR<br />
ABC TELEVISION NETWCRK<br />
Interviewer: Mr. Patrick Tennison<br />
Q. Prime Minister, the Labor Party says domestic issues<br />
are the main point in this election. Do you agree?<br />
PM. The Labor Party would like Australians to think that<br />
because they don't want Australians to consider their complete lack<br />
of any foreign affairs or defence policy at all. The real issue at this<br />
election, the overriding issue at this election, is the policy of cut and<br />
run which the Labor Party has got. They will walk out on our alliances<br />
with the United States and with the South Vietnamese, and their attempt<br />
there to get democracy working they will walk out on that, unilaterally,<br />
without consultation, without agreement. They will withdraw from<br />
Malaysia / Singapore, break our word there and show that we have a<br />
lack of interest in the region to our North and having alienated our<br />
alliance, having alienated the United States, having, I am quite sure,<br />
deterred Great Britain from ever coming back to the region to our<br />
North in time of need if we won't take any part in it having done all<br />
that they then propose to reduce our own efforts in defence. Perhaps<br />
I shouldn't say " cut and run" perhaps I should say " run and cut" for<br />
they first run, then reduce our Army by a third and deny the Air Force<br />
the strike bomber which our military experts say we need. Of course<br />
they say domestic issues are the most important. Cf course they run<br />
away from discussing defence. This is the overriding thing, because<br />
on this the future, really the future security of Australia depends.<br />
Indeed, the future capacity of Australia to be an independent nation<br />
may depend on these issues.<br />
Q. Well, let us look at it from outside. We have<br />
commitments in Malaysia and Singapore. Do the people of these<br />
countries want us there?<br />
PM. Indeed they do, and indeed they are very disturbed at<br />
any prospect of a change in policy such as the Labor Party proposes.<br />
Let me give you some quotations to indicate this. Tun Razak is the<br />
Minister in Malaysia who is in charge of these affairs, and this is a<br />
quote from him concerning whether our forces should be there or<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
whether they shouldn't. He says: " If forces are in Australia ( that's<br />
Australian forces) I don't think they would be much help in modern<br />
conditions. If we in. Malaysia are attacked, it would be a matter of<br />
hours, not days". And Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister of<br />
Singapore says, " Those who subscribe to the theory that Australian<br />
ground forces should not be in the Singapore/ Malaysian area have no<br />
conception of what is required by the area itself". Now these are<br />
things that people in the area are saying.<br />
Q. But does the Labor Party want to withdraw completely<br />
from Asia? Mr. Whitlam has said he would keep the RAAF at<br />
Butterworth in Malaysia for training purposes anyway.<br />
PM. The Labor Party platform and policy must be carried<br />
out by Labor Party parliamentarians. And the Labor Party platform<br />
and policy is quite distinct. It says: " No plans for the stationing of<br />
Australian armed forces in other countries are now feasible or<br />
acceptable. No Australian troops may be stationed outside of Australia".<br />
It is all very well for Mr. Whitlam on one day to say well, perhaps,<br />
he would leave some Air Force in Malaysia, but we might note that on<br />
the same day Mr. Barnard said Labor would bring the Air Force back<br />
from Malaysia. But this sort of disagreement is not really important.<br />
What is important is that the outside body that runs Labor says there<br />
must be no Australian forces stationed in Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
That will prevail.<br />
Q. Well let's come back home now. You have been criticised<br />
for not saying much about Commonwealth/ State relations in this campaign.<br />
PM. Well, I have said more than the Opposition has said<br />
concerning Commonwealth/ State relations. just have a look at tinat. In<br />
my policy speech I pointed out that there would be in the future a need<br />
not only for increased defence, not only for increased development, but<br />
a need for the increasing requirements of the States as the population<br />
grows and they have to provide the hospitals and the schools and the<br />
other services they provide. I made that clear. And we believe in doing<br />
this in a Federal way. Now we are quite happy to look at the Constitution.<br />
We think it is time it is looked at. But we believe basically in doing it<br />
in a Federal way. What is suggested from the Opposition is to bypass<br />
the States in education completely by setting up some commission to<br />
examine ten thousand schools, ignoring the State Education Departments,<br />
to bypass the States in the development of suburbs, to make the most<br />
massive attempt yet made to centralise in Canberra the running of things<br />
which up till now have been State functions. Not to help but to<br />
centralise them.<br />
Q. Isn't inflation one of our major problems domestically?<br />
What can your policies do about this? / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
PM. No, inflation isn't one of our major problems domestically.<br />
One of our major problems domestically is to make sure inflation<br />
doesn't get out of hand. And we have done that. In spite of the fact<br />
that our workforce is fully employed, in spite of the fact of the growth<br />
that everyone can see, we have still managed to contain inflation and<br />
keep it under control. But it will be one of our major problems. It<br />
will be if the Opposition injects hundreds of millions more into the<br />
economy. Look, the last figures published on employment showed<br />
that for the first time in Australia's history we had more jobs offering<br />
than there were applicants for jobs. Now with your workforce fully<br />
employed like that, with your resources utilised, any thinking person<br />
must know that throwing more money into the economy won't produce<br />
any more, but what it will produce is higher costs and inflation. That's<br />
an easy word to use " inflation". Perhaps the connotations aren't<br />
fully known. What it means is that people on fixed incomes get badly<br />
hit. What it means is that the modest wage-earner gets badly hit.<br />
And of course what it means is that the primary producer has these<br />
extra costs and can't recoup them because he is selling on an overseas<br />
market and on the prices given by an overseas market. This is the<br />
danger posed by the Opposition. It is not a problem now because we<br />
have contained it. It will be an overriding problems if the Australian<br />
people are taken in by what is suggested by the ALP.<br />
Q. There are obviously very vast differences on all or most<br />
of these policy points. Is there some overall philosophy you can see<br />
as distinguishing these differences between the two parties?<br />
PM. What are these vast differences on policy points put<br />
before the people this time? I have had a close look at the Opposition's<br />
policies. There are no precise provisions, no precise suggestions for<br />
development at all. We do have. We propose to build two raiiways.<br />
We propose to take Australia into the atomic age. We propose to set<br />
$ 100 million aside over the next five years for water conservation.<br />
Those are specific proposals. On the other side there are none at all.<br />
We do propose to spend more money increasing our own defences. The<br />
Opposition are completely silent except that they are going to reduce<br />
them by the steps they say they would take. Nowhere in the ALP policy<br />
is there any specific proposal except in the field of welfare and an<br />
already discredited and broken-back health plan. Now, we do have<br />
proposals. They have been spelt out. The establishment of a marine<br />
science institute to let us know more about the Barrier Reef so we<br />
can protect it. The establishment of a film industry. All these things<br />
are in our proposals. There are none none in the proposals of the<br />
Opposition. So it is a bit difficult to say there is a great difference<br />
between them. I think perhaps, though, the major difference is in the<br />
field of economic management. We are determined that we will<br />
maintain the employment we have, maintain the growth we have, the<br />
prosperity we have, and that we will not let inflation spoil these things.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Because if it does, not only are employment and growth in jeopardy,<br />
but overseas capital will not flow here in the way it has been flowing<br />
here, migrants will not be able to be brought in in the quantities in<br />
which they have been brought in. We are determined to avoid that.<br />
Now that is why this year we had to budget for a $ 500 million internal<br />
surplus. What do you think the situation of Australia would be now<br />
the employment situation, the cost situation, the price situation-if<br />
we hadn't done that; if there was another $ 500 million. This would<br />
have got out of control, and it would have made it impossible for us to<br />
do what we are going to do and that is to reduce the income tax burden<br />
on the lower and middle income tax earner. After all, it is the<br />
taxpayer who pays for all these promises. You can't give them and<br />
at the same time allow the taxpayer not to pay them. We have given<br />
an earnest of our interest in social welfare, but we also want to pay<br />
attention to people who have children to bring up, houses to pay off,<br />
and who are themselves earning and need an incentive to earn more.<br />
Perhaps those are differences.<br />
Thank you, Prime Minister. </p>
