PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 23-OCTOBER 1982<br />
LAUNCHING OF THE BOOK, " 16 PRIME MINISTERS"<br />
It is a very nice thing that the whole family is here,<br />
it is nice for that to be so on this occasion. There are many<br />
old friends of Sir Alexander' here and it is good to renew<br />
Ob aquaintances of people who are in the Parliament when I was<br />
first there and when Alex was first there. It does not'<br />
hurt to remind ourselves just for a moment that Alex had an<br />
enormous tradition of service to South Australia and to<br />
Australia as his father had before him, and as I suspect his<br />
son has after him. Australia is certainly very much the richer<br />
for individuals and for families who have that commitment to<br />
the service of Australia in a way which enables them, or in a<br />
sense commands them to devote all their time and all their<br />
energies to trying to do something for this country.<br />
Many of you would know Alex's own history. It is maybe a commentary<br />
on the passage of the years that Alex was one of a significant<br />
number of prisoners of war of the Japanese, and he was in the<br />
Federal Parliament when I first joined it and that must have<br />
been an experience that none would or could ever forget.<br />
Alex was Member for Angas and was re-elected five times. I can<br />
remember electioneering with him, not on his account, but on<br />
one occasion when the Liberal Party very nearly won electorate of<br />
Grey, and the very-obvious respect with which he was held<br />
by everyone who me t him, wherever he went and it was good<br />
to see.<br />
I was speaking with Clyde Cameron here this morning and he<br />
said Sir Alexander was one of those who had friends on all sides<br />
of the House and he was able to expres3 his views and his arguments<br />
in a way that was forceful and clear-cut but in a way which did<br />
not arouse enmity,--in a way which deserts friendship.<br />
That is very much a hallmark of this particular book. There<br />
have been many books written I suppose about politicians and<br />
contemporary figures. I do not think you have published any of these<br />
and if so,-that is to your credit. Idon't think any of these<br />
contemporary works would be worth publishing. There was<br />
one very brilliant one written about rrie of about 100 pages of<br />
totally blank paper. That might have been the best of them. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Alexander's book is something of a very different character<br />
and of very different quality. His own character shines<br />
through the book. He describes the six Prime Ministers and<br />
other ministers also of Australia and the United Kingdom in a way<br />
which is kindl~ i and perspicacious in a way which makes it perfectly<br />
clear that he does not necessarily agree with anything that<br />
they have done, or every aspect of their character, but in a<br />
way which at the same time could not possibly give offence<br />
to anyone, to any friend or relative who might want to read<br />
this particular book. That says a very great deal about<br />
. AMexander, that was his character he had the capacity to<br />
disagree, but to do it in a pleasant and in a friendly way.<br />
It does give us an insight into the six Prime Ministers. I<br />
have read, not every word of the book, but I have certainly<br />
read all of that part of the book which I think is most<br />
relevant to my own experience in relation to three Prime<br />
Ministers. I think he covers the ground very well and gives<br />
an insight into a number of issues of consequence in which<br />
Alex himself played a very significant part.<br />
From what we know of biographies if somebody got up and<br />
said he was going to write about certain people, I suppose<br />
they would have felt nervous about it and what was going to<br />
be said because so often people always seem to want to write<br />
the wounds, the hurts, to try and find out what was wrong and<br />
to try and demonstrate that there was no good whatsoever. I think<br />
that. is the reverse, the very opposite of the kind of book that<br />
this in fact is.<br />
There are many things that could be said. Alex gave a number<br />
of insights into the people concerned, but also in the book<br />
there is an insight of Alexander in the words of some of the<br />
Prime Ministers. Sir Robert Menzies said he was a man of high<br />
education, of wide information, of great purposes with an<br />
uncommon capacity for getting on with people, for presenting<br />
his views strongly but without forfeiting friendship. That<br />
suggests a great deal of what this particular book is all<br />
about;. Courtesy* is one of the things which just seems<br />
to have gone out of the window so far as Federal Parliament<br />
is concerned..,<br />
About enzies' dinners ' at The Lodge , he said, These dinners never lasted<br />
long enough. He was ' an incessant worker and usually returned to ' the House,<br />
soon after 8, but tho~ se interludes enabled memb~ ers to discover the warmer<br />
side . of a man who. wzs the opposite to -what some of his critics<br />
alleged him to The judgements of Menzies, of Holt, to<br />
Gorton and I suspect also of Wilson, Heath and Brookeborough<br />
but those last three were obviously ones I knew not so weL<br />
were good and sensible judgements.<br />
The book also reveals Alex Downer's own concerns, a crcndntmnt-to public<br />
service, to the highest standard in public service. He was a believer,<br />
a leader in the Parliament in the Parliamentary institution.<br />
In the Commonwealth itself he epitomised much of what this<br />
State and much of what the Liberal Party stood and stands for.<br />
,3. </p>
<p>3-<br />
The courage with which Alex finished his book is also very much<br />
a part of the man. It must have been dif ficult. -I hope Mary<br />
that it is something that you have been-looking forward to, and<br />
I am sure it is, that fact that this book is published And<br />
published now in a way which I believe, will get wide acclaim.<br />
There were a number of issues which were important during<br />
Alexander's time. I was in the Federal Parliament during his<br />
long period of service as High Commissioner in the United Kingdom,<br />
there was the great issue of the Common Market and as I would<br />
believe, and it has come through the book, that Alex did not<br />
much like the desertion of the Commonwealth for some new<br />
relationship with the European community. I think later<br />
history might make that judgement to be an accurate ' one.<br />
He subscribed to a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting<br />
which was not necessarily called that at the time, but at<br />
a difficult time when the Commonwealth was going through a<br />
period of transition and moving to a new time and to a new<br />
form. He also describes the battle that Harold Holt put up to try<br />
and prevent British withdrawal from east of Suez at a time<br />
which was obviously difficult through South East Asia and<br />
difficult in relation to Australia as an ally of Britain<br />
and also difficult in r -lation to the United States as an<br />
ally of Britain. In spite of<br />
the arguments put forward by Australia, by New Zealand and<br />
by the United States, the British decision to withdraw was<br />
irrevocable on financial,' resource and economic grounds alone.<br />
The book is an insight into the inner workings and relationships<br />
between leaders of government, between governments of a kind<br />
which we have not had up to this point. -many<br />
of us also remember Alex very much for the speeches he often<br />
gave in the United Kingdom. which were saying things that needed to be<br />
said, but perhaps they were not always heeded as much as they should have been.<br />
This is* a. -valuable book, a thoughtful one and it<br />
says as much about Alexander himself as it does about the<br />
six Prime Ministers. I have very great pleasure in launching.<br />
the book. I wish it well and if there are any other contemporary<br />
historians around, they would particularly do well to read<br />
it. 000---</p>
