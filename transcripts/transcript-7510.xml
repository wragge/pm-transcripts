TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JANA WENDT, A CURRENT AFFAIR<br />
27 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E O E PROOF ONLY<br />
WENDT: The figures are not good are they?<br />
PM: No, some of the figures are disappointing but I must<br />
take issue Jana with an observation you made that we've<br />
heard nothing but bad news. Can I remind you that we've<br />
heard further very good news on the employment front which<br />
gives us the fact now that we have got over one and a<br />
quarter million new jobs, the unemployment rate down very<br />
significantly and that's an employment performance which is<br />
twice as good as the rest of the world. Now that doesn't<br />
take away the bad news. It's not all bad, that's all I'm<br />
saying.<br />
WENDT: Alright, it's not all gloomy but it is pretty sad<br />
isn't it? Your Government's budget forecast in relation to<br />
inflation and trade figures were off course weren't they?<br />
PM: Yes, and certainly on the external account the figure<br />
that we were hoping for of $ 9.5 billion deficit on the<br />
current account will certainly be well beyond that. The<br />
only redeeming element, and I think all your viewers would<br />
understand that we've got to look at this in the longer<br />
term, and that is that we are in the middle of a very big<br />
investment boom at the moment and there is no doubt that the<br />
Australian economy as a result of the retooling, the capital<br />
equipment that's been put in is going to be in a better<br />
position in the period ahead.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, I wonder whether most of our viewers would<br />
understand that they have to look at it in the longer term.<br />
That forecast as you say was way off beam, wasn't it?<br />
PM: Yes, we were under the figure, there's no doubt about<br />
that.<br />
WENDT: We've done in seven months what you forecast that we<br />
would have done in a year. We've done more in seven months<br />
that you forecasted we would have done in a year.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
WENDT: It's a grave error isn't it? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: It is an error, but economic forecasting is not an<br />
exact science and what I'm saying is, and I'll be quite<br />
happy about saying this when I go to the election Jana which<br />
you mentioned, I will ask the Australian people to judge my<br />
Government on its overall performance in economic<br />
management. It's no accident Jana that the performance of<br />
this Government in general economic management, and<br />
particularly in terms of job creation, is held up around the<br />
world as a model.<br />
WENDT: But Mr Hawke it can hardly be that. 4.5 was your<br />
inflation estimate in the budget. We're up to 7.7.<br />
PM: Well as you know if you extract the housing cost<br />
element, which is now the subject by the Commonwealth<br />
Statistician of a review, the figure would have been 6.8%<br />
for the year.<br />
WENDT: But this problem in getting the figures right has<br />
never been quoted by you or the Treasurer before. Why call<br />
it in now when the figures are going against you?<br />
PM: Simply because on this issue you are assuming on the<br />
way it's done now that every Australian household is getting<br />
a new house every quarter which doesn't accord with the<br />
facts. Now this doesn't mean that there isn't a problem in<br />
the housing area. Of course there is and that's why amongst<br />
other things we're having this conference with the Premiers<br />
later this week. But there's a recognition that it is not<br />
necessarily an overall accurate figure and that's why the<br />
Statistician, Jana, is reviewing the way he looks at this.<br />
WENDT: But Mr Hawke can you understand why I ask you now<br />
why should we believe you or the Treasurer when you have<br />
been so wrong in the recent past?<br />
PM: I suggest that you didn't produce this sort of argument<br />
when we were so wrong earlier in our employment forecast,<br />
the only difference of course being that we were<br />
conservatively wrong. When I said in the first part of our<br />
Government that we'd get half a million new jobs in three<br />
years, people scoffed. We easily exceeded that and at every<br />
point from March of ' 83 right through till now we have been<br />
conservative, we have been wrong, below the line in terms of<br />
the amount of jobs that we have created in the economy. But<br />
we don't get attacked for that.<br />
WENDT: Well we'll pay you your dues for that Prime<br />
Minister, but you'd have to admit that this is a tragedy for<br />
Australia PM: Of course it's a tragedy Jana. I want your viewers to<br />
understand that there is no complacency on my part or on<br />
Paul's part. We've shown the preparedness over the years to<br />
make the adjustments in policy that are necessary to deal<br />
with the circumstances that arise. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
WENDT: Your Treasurer hasn't until today admitted that<br />
there was something a little wrong with his approach.<br />
PM: But what you can always do, it's not only for a<br />
Treasurer in this country, you'll find Treasurers in every<br />
democratic country, once they've had the benefit of looking<br />
at how things have worked out over a period of time they're<br />
saying well now we can see what's happened, if we'd now had<br />
the benefit of hindsight and known exactly what was<br />
happening we would have made that decision.<br />
WENDT: I probably could have done that too Prime Minister,<br />
but I'm not the Treasurer.<br />
PM: You're not, but let me just turn that to you. Jana, in<br />
your personal life in decisions you take, if 12 months after<br />
the event you had known the events of that 12 months, would<br />
every decision you'd taken earlier been exactly the same?<br />
We all are wiser with the benefit of the experience of the<br />
previous 12 months, not just Treasurers and Prime Ministers.<br />
WENDT: But Prime Minister, you run the country.<br />
PM: I do run the country, yes.<br />
WENDT: The Treasurer's responsible for the economic running<br />
of the country and basically it's a mess.<br />
PM: No I just absolutely refute the proposition that it's a<br />
mess. The problem that we've got in this country now is<br />
that we've got an economy which is running very strongly,<br />
more strongly than we anticipated it would. Just let me<br />
give you a simple statistic. With investment in this<br />
country it's now running at a higher level as a proportion<br />
of our whole activity higher than it's run for 35 years and<br />
that is the problem of a strong economy which has got to be<br />
slowed down a little bit.<br />
WENDT: Prime Minister, in all of this Mr Keating has come<br />
out and attacked people who own blocks of land and rotary<br />
hoists. Do you think that was a mistake in hindsight?<br />
PM: I think that Paul perhaps would've liked to have<br />
expressed it differently in thinking about it.<br />
WENDT: Would you have preferred him to have expressed it<br />
differently? PM: It's no good in saying what you would like him to have<br />
said, the actual words, but let's make this point, that what<br />
Paul was trying to say was that in regard to the housing<br />
problem that we have in this country that we ought to be<br />
prepared as a community to ask ourselves whether for some<br />
people, as a matter of choice that is, not as a matter of<br />
imposition, some people may not prefer to have their housing<br />
in a medium density type of situation because they prefer to </p>
<p>-4-<br />
be closer to their place of employment than further out<br />
where they would have their separate blocks. Now it is the<br />
case that a lot of people would like to do that. I think<br />
what was unfortunate is that an impression is left that it's<br />
not legitimate for people who want to have that type of<br />
housing that that's still a legitimate aspiration, and<br />
indeed that's how most people will have their housing.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, full confidence in Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Full confidence in Mr Keating. </p>
<p>WENDT: Welcome back.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
WENDT: You have said you have full confidence in Paul<br />
Keating. Have you been entirely satisfied with his<br />
performance over the last few weeks?<br />
PM: Well, yes, I mean what you have got to understand is<br />
that the job of Treasurer is an enormously difficult one and<br />
I look at Paul's performance over six years and I look at my<br />
own. I know there are times when I could've said things and<br />
done things better than I have. You are not dealing with<br />
automatons and perfect human beings. And Paul himself would<br />
say that perhaps he could have expressed things better and<br />
more clearly, but I make my judgement about Paul Keating and<br />
his overall performance and I still believe he is an<br />
outstanding Treasurer.<br />
WENDT: But when he does come out and attack ordinary people<br />
with rotary hoists and blocks of land, I know we've just<br />
spoken about that, don't you think it has the potential to<br />
be outright insulting to people who've been tightening their<br />
belts for so many years now?<br />
PM: I think that some people would misunderstand it. I<br />
accept that, but all I can say to your viewers, I know the<br />
man. He is a person who is committed to trying to improve<br />
the lot of your ordinary viewer and he is a Treasurer who<br />
has, with me and in Government, provided jobs and just let<br />
me come back to this, I mean, you think of jobs. He and I<br />
have created jobs at a rate four times faster than the<br />
conservatives and John Howard did in their seven years. We<br />
are creating jobs more than twice as fast as the rest of the<br />
world. Now I think common fairness, Jana, demands that that<br />
not be forgotten. Now obviously things can be said in a way<br />
which may be taken amiss and if your viewers have felt hurt<br />
or not understood by some of the phrases that Paul's used,<br />
just let me say to you it's not intended. What we want to<br />
see is ordinary Australians have gradually improving<br />
standards and I give them this commitment. It's unqualified<br />
that in this period ahead as a result of what we'll do in<br />
the wages area and in the taxes area that their standards<br />
will improve. That's what they need, it's what they<br />
deserve, it's what we will deliver.<br />
WENDT: Are you saying in the short term or the long term?<br />
PM: I'm saying in this coming financial year there will be<br />
an improvement in standards resulting from tax cuts and<br />
wage increases and taking that into account with inflation. </p>
<p>WENDT: Well, your Treasurer has said today that it's not<br />
going to get any better, the trade figures at least.<br />
PM: No, the trade figures for some months, he said, will<br />
continue to be bad.<br />
WENDT: Till the end of the financial year I believe.<br />
PM: Well that's 88/ 89 in this financial year, we obviously<br />
are not going to see the order of improvement that we had<br />
hoped, but that is not the sole determinant. That's not<br />
the sole determinant of the sorts of issues I have been<br />
talking about and I want your viewers to understand that<br />
while the jargon may be mystifying at times, and Treasurers<br />
often have to talk in the jargon of economics, that what<br />
Paul and this Government is about is trying to create an<br />
Australia in which under the pressures, the external<br />
pressures that exist, we will conduct policy in a way which<br />
will keep going the increase in jobs so that they and their<br />
kids will not only stay in jobs but there will be more jobs<br />
for them and that they will be more rewarding jobs. Now<br />
that's what we are about.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, I understand that you want to appeal more<br />
to women. Here I am and there are a few million listening<br />
to you now. What are you going to say to us?<br />
PM: Well let me give you the background to that. The fact<br />
is that if you look at the voting figures there is, what we<br />
call, the gender gap that something like three percent or<br />
so less women vote for our Party than do men. All I was<br />
saying to my people and it's an obligation that we should<br />
explain to you, to all the women of Australia, the things<br />
that we have done, not just for women as such, but all the<br />
general things that we've done which have made for a better<br />
Australia. Now obviously there has been some failure of<br />
communication. I accept that and I was saying to my<br />
colleagues, we've got to remedy that. The sorts of things I<br />
would like to say to you, Jana, and to all the women that<br />
are listening and I've talked about jobs and I think that<br />
should be important. I think the thing I'd like to say<br />
mostly to the women of Australia is this, not just the women<br />
who are adult and grown up now, but I want to say this to<br />
them. As a result of what we've done over six years, their<br />
girls, their young girls who are growing up are going to<br />
grow up in an Australia in which those girls are going to<br />
have a greater range of opportunity of occupation, of<br />
training and education than has ever been the case before in<br />
this country.<br />
WENDT: Alright Mr Hawke, I hope the message gets through.<br />
Thank you very much for your time tonight.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed Jana.<br />
ends </p>
