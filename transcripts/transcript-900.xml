COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH By<br />
Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZI ES,<br />
M. P.<br />
ON<br />
PRO VISION OF SCIENCE BUILDINGS<br />
AND EQUIPMENT IN SECONDARY<br />
SCHOOLS<br />
MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 5th March, 1964] 1<br />
Ministerial Statement.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister)-by leave-At the last<br />
Federal elections the Government placed<br />
ef oe the people of Australia plans to<br />
sst the provision and equipment of<br />
scibnce teaching laboratories in secondary<br />
schools. It was made clear that the assistance<br />
to be provided for such purposes would<br />
be available to all schools with a complete<br />
-bsence of any discrimination. Procedures<br />
) achieve this end have now been discussed<br />
with all of the States-naturally this<br />
has taken some little timne-and there is<br />
agreement that they raise no special<br />
problem for any State, although the<br />
Tasmanian Minister for Education has<br />
indicated that he would prefer the distribution<br />
to the States to be on the basis<br />
of secondary school enrolments rather than<br />
State Populations as we intend. Where<br />
necessary, all States will co-operate with<br />
the Commonwealth in the carrying out of<br />
the scheme.<br />
The amount for the purpose is œ E5,000,000<br />
annually and it is intended to divide the<br />
amount each year between Government<br />
schools and non-Government schools. The<br />
division will be made by obtaining the numbers<br />
of secondary school pupils enrolled<br />
2929/ 64. in Government schools and the numbers<br />
of secondary school pupils enrolled in non-<br />
Government schools and dividing the total<br />
amount of money available in proportion<br />
to those numbers as certified by the Coinmionwealth<br />
Statistician. This will be done<br />
on an Australia-wide basis and would at<br />
present result in a sum of the order of<br />
œ 3,750,000 being available for Government<br />
secpndary -schools throughout Australia and<br />
a sum of the order of œ 1,250,000 being<br />
available for non-Government schools<br />
throughout Australia. The sum available<br />
for Government schools will then be allotted<br />
to the various State Governments in proportion<br />
to the population of the States as<br />
certified by the Commonwealth Statistician.<br />
Allotment will be made by way of a<br />
grant under Section 96 of the Constitution<br />
and the recipient State will be entirely<br />
responsible for spending the sum allotted<br />
it in ways which, in its opinion, best suit<br />
the requirements of education in that State.<br />
The grant will, however, be made subject<br />
to the conditions that it can only be spent<br />
on the provision of science teaching laboratories<br />
in secondary schools or the provision<br />
of capital equipment for such laboratories.<br />
and it will be subject to the further condition<br />
that the items on which it is spent,<br />
and the source of the funds so spent, are </p>
<p>clearly identifiable in the State Budget. The<br />
Commonwealth has made it clear to the<br />
States that it expects the sums so provided<br />
to be regarded as supplementary and additional<br />
to sums which the State would<br />
normally provide for education. Money<br />
for these purposes will be made available<br />
in the 1964-65 Budget, that is to say, in the<br />
financial year beginning on 1st July, 1964.<br />
The States have been made aware of this<br />
and are no doubt in process of preparing<br />
their plans for the expenditure of the money<br />
to be available to them for these purposes.<br />
In the case of non-Government schools,<br />
the Commonwealth will be solely responsible<br />
for deciding grants. To do so it will adopt<br />
the following procedures: First, it will allot<br />
the amount available for non-Government<br />
schools among the States having regard to<br />
the population of each State, though in<br />
later years it may be necessary not to be<br />
too strictly bound in this regard, because<br />
some States may be rather more advanced<br />
than others in this field. The amount<br />
available for each State will then be<br />
divided into two parts. I am talking now<br />
about the non-Government schools. One<br />
part will be for assistance to non-Catholic<br />
schools within the boundaries of that State<br />
and the other part for assistance to Catholic<br />
schools within the boundaries of that State.<br />
I have used that expression as these are<br />
rather awkward phrases. There are some<br />
non-Catholic schools which are under<br />
church foundation and some which are not.<br />
For example, as some of my colleagues<br />
know, there is the Sydney Grammar School.<br />
This division will be made by obtaining the<br />
number of secondary school pupils enrolled<br />
in non-Catholic schools and the number<br />
of secondary school pupils enrolled in<br />
Catholic schools and dividing the sum avail-<br />
: able in proportion to those numbers as<br />
certified by the Commonwealth Statistician.<br />
The Government will preserve some flexibility<br />
in this procedure so that the division<br />
may, as necessary, be adapted to the needs<br />
of schools for science buildings and equipm.<br />
ent as the scheme develops. There will<br />
thus be for non-Government schools within<br />
the boundaries of each State a sum for<br />
assistance to non-Catholic schools and a<br />
: sum for assistance to Catholic schools.<br />
All secondary schools, whether boys'<br />
schools, girls' schools or co-educational<br />
schools are eligible to receive assistance, and any science teaching laboratory the<br />
construction' of which began after 1st<br />
December, 1963-that is the day after the<br />
election-is a building eligible to be considered<br />
for assistance. No such building<br />
which was constructed before 1st December,<br />
1963, or which was in course of construction<br />
at that date, will however, ' be<br />
considered as eligible to receive assistance.<br />
A school is, however, eligible to apply for<br />
assistance for capital equipment bought after<br />
1st December, 1963. Money for these<br />
purposes will be made available in the<br />
1964-65 Commonwealth Budget; that<br />
during the financial year beginning Ist July,<br />
1964. Schools which are eligible for<br />
assistance and which seek assistance should<br />
therefore make application for such assistance<br />
as soon as possible. Applications<br />
should be made to the Minister in Charg<br />
of Commonwealth Activities in Education,-"<br />
Prime Minister's Department, East Block,<br />
Canberra. It is clear that very many independent<br />
schools will be seeking assistance and that<br />
the Commonwealth will not in the first years<br />
of the scheme-at least in its early yearsand<br />
despite the funds available, as one might<br />
say, in one stroke, be able to assist all<br />
schools that are eligible. It is intended<br />
therefore to select in each State schools to<br />
be regarded as those which fall into<br />
category meriting first consideration fo<br />
assistance. This selection will be done bvythe<br />
Commonwealth having regard to the<br />
number of secondary school pupils at a<br />
school, the number of such students doing<br />
science courses, the teaching facilitie'<br />
already available and similar criteria. Ever<br />
so, all schools falling within this category<br />
will not be able to be assisted initially and<br />
it will be necessary to allot priorities to such<br />
schools within each State's boundaries.<br />
For this purpose, the Commonwealth<br />
hopes to create, within each State's<br />
boundaries, two advisory bodies. One body,<br />
drawn from those responsible for non-<br />
Catholic schools, will be asked to suggest<br />
priorities for such schools and, subject to<br />
the standards proposed being acceptable to<br />
the Commonwealth, to advise on the<br />
amount of assistance extended to each<br />
school. The other body, drawn from those<br />
responsible for Catholic schools, will be<br />
asked to do the same for such schools.<br />
I may say that my colleague, Senator </p>
<p>Gorton, who has been doing a great deal<br />
of work on this, has already discussed this<br />
matter considerably with these representative<br />
groups. When grants are decided by the<br />
Commonwealth they will be made to a<br />
State under section 96 of the Constitution.<br />
I am now talking about non-State secondary<br />
schools. The State concerned would act<br />
as agent for the Commonwealth for the<br />
purposes of payment and would not itself<br />
accept any responsibility for making such<br />
grants. I should, perhaps, emphasize that<br />
these advisory bodies have not yet been set<br />
and . it will be my colleague's next task<br />
-o conduct talks for the purpose of setting<br />
them up. He has already had quite a few<br />
of these. But, in the meantime, so that<br />
honorable members may know the lines on<br />
-which the Commonwealth is proceeding and<br />
) that schools which require assistance may<br />
m-lake application without dela'y, I believe<br />
it appropriate to make this statement in<br />
this place.<br />
I might add that the question of the<br />
standard to which a laboratory ought to<br />
be built, or at least the standard for which<br />
Commonwealth funds should be supplied,<br />
is one that ' has received our attention. For<br />
advice on this matter we are setting up a<br />
small committee which we have asked Mr.<br />
L. C. Robson to chair. Mr. Robson is a<br />
-former headmaster of Sydney Church of<br />
S" gland Grammar School. He is a very<br />
-camous headmaster, with a scientific background,<br />
who has had much experience of<br />
these matters in his capacity of Chairman<br />
of the Committee of Advice of the<br />
-1ndustrial Fund, of which most honorable<br />
jembers will have heard, which has been<br />
engaged for some years in assisting independent<br />
schools to build science teaching laboratories. This committee will be available<br />
to give advice, when asked, to schools<br />
planning to build science laboratories and<br />
will be responsible for advising the<br />
Commonwealth as to suitable and<br />
reasonable standards for laboratories for<br />
particular numbers of students and<br />
Commonwealth assistance will be limited to<br />
providing, or assisting to provide, funds<br />
necessary to build to that standard. This<br />
is the situation regarding this matter at this<br />
moment. I shall keep honorable members<br />
informed of progress in the setting up in<br />
each State of -the advisory bodies to which<br />
I have referred.<br />
In conclusion-this is, I think, a most<br />
interesting and just experiment-there are<br />
a number of different procedures which<br />
could be adopted for making the various<br />
divisions between State Governments<br />
referred to in what I have said. The one<br />
set out earlier appears to the Commonwealth<br />
to meet requirements most nearly<br />
and has been agreed to by five of the<br />
States. It will be the basis used for the<br />
first year of operation. But this is a new<br />
scheme. It must be tested in operation.<br />
In subsequent years it may develop that the<br />
State Governments would -prefer the<br />
Commonwealth to consider some other<br />
system of division between them. If they<br />
do agree that some other system is<br />
preferable in the future, and provided<br />
that the Commonwealth is satisfied<br />
that an agreed proposal is just to all, the<br />
Commonwealth will always be prepared to<br />
listen to suggestions designed to make the<br />
scheme operate harmoniously and to the<br />
greatest benefit of the greatest number of<br />
Australian students.<br />
