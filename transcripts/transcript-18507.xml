The nation's vocational education and training system will be centred on quality teaching and learning, under a revised National Agreement on skills signed up to at COAG today.</p>
<p>The revised National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development aims to deliver a productive and highly skilled workforce.</p>
<p>Under the National Agreement, Governments will have to implement a National Training Entitlement, improve participation and qualification completions and assure the quality of training delivery and outcomes.</p>
<p>States and territories will have to set strict criteria to ensure only quality providers with an established record can access public funding.</p>
<p>States and territories will be required to provide strategies that will continue to support and strengthen the public providers of vocational education and training (TAFE) over the next five years.</p>
<p>The revised National Agreement includes the performance framework that will be used to assess progress against the COAG targets to:</p>
<p> * 	Halve the proportion of Australians nationally aged 20-64 without qualifications at certificate level III and above between 2009 and 2020; and<br />
 * 	Double the number of higher level qualification completions (diploma and advanced diploma) nationally between 2009 and 2020.</p>
<p>The National Agreement is the basis on which the Commonwealth Government will provide $7.2 billion in skills funding to states and territories over the next five years.</p>
<p>In addition the Commonwealth Government will provide $1.75 billion in funding to a Skills Reform National Partnership Agreement, as agreed at COAG today.</p>
<p>In total, that means the Government isproviding almost $9 billion of funding to the states and territories over the next five years to provide the skills that Australian businesses and individuals need to prosper in a rapidly changing economy.</p>
<p>These reforms promise to deliver far-reaching changes that will make a difference to the lives of millions of Australian working families. </p>
