The Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced that the Australian Defence Force would contribute approximately 1,200 personnel to support the clean-up and restoration phase of the flood crisis in Queensland.</p>
<p>This is the biggest deployment of troops for a natural disaster since Cyclone Tracy.</p>
<p>These personnel will be drawn primarily from the Army's Brisbane-based 7th Brigade, but will also include other Army units as well as elements from the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Army Reserve.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the Gillard Labor Government was working hard to make sure Queenslanders were getting all the assistance they need now and in the months ahead.</p>
<p>While many parts of Queensland and Northern NSW are still in the immediate grip of the floods, the Commonwealth has started to plan and provide for clean-up and restoration phase of this natural disaster.</p>
<p>This needs to be completed as quickly as possible so we can move to the reconstruction phase.</p>
<p>The Defence Personnel will form part of a Joint Task Force (JTF) which will work with the Queensland and local authorities to assist during the clean up.</p>
<p>Their activities will include:</p>
<p> * 	Engineering infrastructure assessments<br />
 * 	Road clearance and repairs including the clearing and repair of culverts<br />
 * 	Construction of temporary bridges<br />
 * 	Removal of debris and general clean up<br />
 * 	Water purification facilities<br />
 * 	Building and area searches<br />
 * 	Helicopters for medical evacuations, resupply and transport<br />
 * 	Psychological Support Teams and Environmental Health Officers to provide specialist support to supplement other agencies.</p>
<p>The Minister for Defence Stephen Smith said the Joint Task Force will be supported by C130 and C17 aircraft.</p>
<p>The ADF will also provide expertise for surveying the Brisbane River including the deployment of Navy survey teams, divers and remote underwater vehicles.</p>
<p>These capabilities will find and clear objects on the seabed and assess bridge foundations. </p>
<p>Despite the increase in resources to the recovery efforts the Australian Defence Force will continue to be involved in operations around the world and retain the capacity to respond to unforeseen emergencies.</p>
<p>Defece will also continue to take a major role in emergency response efforts, including search and rescue while the need exists. </p>
