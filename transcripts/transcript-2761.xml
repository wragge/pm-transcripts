PRESS STATELJENT NO. 28<br />
December 1972<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE LEAVE<br />
The Australian Government will support a claim by<br />
Commonwealth Public Service Unions for 4 weeks' annual leave<br />
to be heard on 21 December.<br />
The first meeting of Labor's Cabinet decided not to<br />
oppose the claim for extra leave by Commonwealth Public<br />
Servants. The extra leave provisions will apply only to<br />
members of recognised unions and associations involved in<br />
wvork within the Service.<br />
Departments, however, will assume that all staff are<br />
members unless advised otherwise by a union.<br />
Provision will be made for conscientious objectors<br />
to unionism to obtain the new leave entitlements upon payment<br />
of union dues to a nominated charity.<br />
The Public Service Board had previously opposed the<br />
Public Servants' 4 weeks' leave application.<br />
The new provisions will apply to all Public Servants<br />
whose annual leave is accruing on or after 1 January 1973.<br />
