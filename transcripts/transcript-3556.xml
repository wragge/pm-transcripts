Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at the International<br />
Press Centre in Brussels on 18 December 1974<br />
I am conscious that my visit to Europe-the first<br />
by an Australian Prime Minister for fifteen<br />
years-coincides with a growing sense of crisis<br />
in international economic affairs. Continuing<br />
high rates of inflation, the threat of emergent<br />
recessionary forces, severe balance of payments<br />
problems for many countries, strains on international<br />
monetary mechanisms and the accentuation<br />
of the problems of the developing countries<br />
constitute pressures of a magnitude and<br />
diversity which the world has not faced since<br />
the war. The European Community is the largest single<br />
trading bloc in the world. The impact of these<br />
developments on the relationships between the<br />
Community and other countries and between<br />
member nations within the Community is of<br />
major significance to all the world's trading<br />
countries. As the Head of Government of a trading<br />
nation of growing significance, I believe<br />
these events demonstrate with unmistakable<br />
force the interdependence of the world's economies.<br />
Such a comment may sound trite. There<br />
are times, however, when restating the obvious<br />
The Prime Minister speaks at the International Press Centre in Brussels. </p>
<p>force, some states-including some states in<br />
Europe-have still to ratify the treaty or make<br />
clear their renunciation of nuclear weapons<br />
development. Australia and Belgium are comparatively small<br />
powers. Remote as we are from each other in<br />
terms of distance, we have a great deal in common.<br />
We are affluent nations in a world of widespread<br />
poverty. We are highly industrialised.<br />
We are devoted to regional co-operation. Our<br />
bilateral trade, though modest in scale, has<br />
grown steadily and exhibits a remarkable balance.<br />
Australia's exports to Belgium in<br />
1973-74 were worth SA59 000000: Belgium's<br />
exports to Australia were worth<br />
$ A57 000000. Australia's ties with Europe<br />
have been strengthened since World War II by a<br />
vast immigration program. It is a reminder to us<br />
that modern civilisation in Australia sprang from<br />
the great tide of European colonisation in the<br />
19th century-a process of colonisation in<br />
which Belgium played her part.<br />
To the north, east and west of Australia there<br />
are many nations which were once parts of<br />
European empires. These links with Europe<br />
have left an enduring mark on the newer<br />
nations of Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Australia,<br />
like many other states in her region, has set her<br />
own firm and independent course in world<br />
affairs. In doing so we acknowledge our historic<br />
and cultural debt to Europe and look to the<br />
nations of Europe for support and collaboration<br />
in overcoming the problems shared by all mankind.<br />
I take heart from the great achievement in<br />
international co-operation we have witnessed<br />
in Europe itself-an achievement in which your<br />
own country has played a lasting and a leading<br />
role. </p>
<p>is required and I believe this is such a time. Each<br />
nation has its definable economic interests, but<br />
the circumstances we face today emphasise the<br />
importance of international co-operation-in<br />
the common good and in the enlightened selfinterest<br />
of all the world's trading nations.<br />
In my discussions with European leaders I shall<br />
indicate-as I have already done with the Prime<br />
Minister of Belgium and President of the Commission-<br />
that:<br />
1. Australia recognises its overriding interest<br />
in the stability of the international economy<br />
and is willing to play its role in restoring<br />
stability and promoting development;<br />
2. Australia has its own specific interests and<br />
objectives in economic matters and intends<br />
to pursue them with vigour and determination;<br />
and<br />
3. Australia recognises the imbalance of<br />
world development and attaches great<br />
importance to the problems of developing<br />
countries.<br />
The pursuit of our interest in the restoration of<br />
economic stability must take account of the<br />
actions of the OPEC countries. The problems of<br />
the western world are those of adjustment to a<br />
new international economy. We are seeing a<br />
redistribution of the world's wealth towards<br />
resource-owning countries. The days are past<br />
when the market value of the world's limited<br />
supply of non-renewable resources-for example,<br />
uranium-could be primarily determined<br />
by the cost of their extraction and transportation-<br />
a view which I know is now held within<br />
the Commission. It is pointless for me not to acknowledge<br />
that our interests are those of a<br />
resource-rich nation. Nevertheless, we trade in<br />
many goods, and across the broad range of our<br />
trade Australia's prosperity depends on the<br />
orderly development of the world economy. The<br />
immediate adjustment processes involved in<br />
the present transition threaten to disrupt our<br />
trade in all areas.<br />
The most pressing and immediate problem we<br />
share with the rest of the world concerns the<br />
strains on the international monetary system<br />
and particularly the problem of recycling<br />
petrodollars. We recognise the urgency and the<br />
seriousness of this sudden development.<br />
Australia has only a limited capacity to contribute<br />
to the solution of this problem, but we stand ready to co-operate to the fullest degree possible.<br />
In my discussions with European leaders I<br />
look forward to broadening my understanding<br />
of their attitudes and intentions in this regard.<br />
There are other areas in which Australia can<br />
make a more significant contribution to international<br />
stability. Since the events of the oil<br />
crisis, all countries have become aware of their<br />
need for secure supplies of essential raw<br />
materials. Australia is richly endowed with<br />
resources. We possess major reserves of coal,<br />
iron ore, bauxite, mineral sands and uranium<br />
and important reserves of lead, zinc, manganese,<br />
nickel and copper. Australia has been and<br />
will continue to be a secure and reliable supplier<br />
of all these commodities. We play a significant<br />
and indeed a growing role in the world trade in<br />
minerals. We shall continue to do so. We have a<br />
reputation for honouring our contracts and we<br />
intend to maintain that reputation. We shall<br />
further develop our mineral resources, including<br />
our energy reserves. We shall be willing<br />
sellers seeking willing buyers. Thus we have<br />
agreed to joint discussions with the Commission<br />
on their needs for uranium and on supplies of<br />
natural and enriched uranium from Australia for<br />
this purpose. Insofar as Australia can contribute<br />
to the stability of world energy supplies, we<br />
shall do so.<br />
We recently announced new developments in<br />
our uranium policy. My Government has not<br />
been prepared to approve further export contracts<br />
because of the unsatisfactory nature of<br />
the market which the Commission acknowledges.<br />
In the meantime, however, in cooperation<br />
with private interests, the Australian<br />
Government intends to establish a uranium<br />
milling plant which we expect will be producing<br />
uranium oxide from 1978. By that time we<br />
hope the market will be sufficiently mature for<br />
the negotiation of new export contracts. We<br />
shall ensure that our traditional trading partners<br />
obtain an equitable share of the uranium we<br />
have for export. This attitude has already been<br />
explained to some of our partners, including<br />
Japan, Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany.<br />
And yesterday we discussed with the<br />
Commission their needs for very substantial additional<br />
supplies of uranium in the 1980' s,<br />
none of which is covered by existing contracts.<br />
The Commission supports, in principle, the<br />
enrichment of part of their additional </p>
<p>requirement in Australia and we look forward to<br />
early talks on this total picture for co-operation<br />
to our mutual advantage. We also stand ready<br />
to discuss in full detail the Commission's<br />
requirements for additional supplies of coal<br />
which could treble the tonnage now being shipped<br />
to Europe from Australia.<br />
Experience in recent years reinforces the Australian<br />
advocacy of international commodity<br />
agreements. We continue to believe that such<br />
agreements are an essential mechanism for<br />
achieving predictable prices and supplies to<br />
purchasers and predictable markets to suppliers.<br />
We continue to seek such commodity<br />
agreements in areas of vital interest to us such<br />
as wheat and sugar. The supplies of both these<br />
commodities are now subject to severe cyclical<br />
strains which we believe international agreements<br />
can mitigate. In those areas where international<br />
agreements do not prove feasible, we<br />
shall seek to negotiate long-term agreements<br />
for agricultural commodities which will guarantee<br />
supplies at fair prices. In these ways<br />
Australia seeks to contribute to the long-term<br />
stability of international commodity markets.<br />
Partly in the context of our support for international<br />
commodity agreements, Australia has<br />
taken an active part in the formation of agreements<br />
on bauxite and tin. We recognise recent<br />
fears about the formation of resourceproducing<br />
cartels. We believe, however, that<br />
such international commodity agreements can<br />
contribute to orderly marketing arrangements<br />
and can be designed to balance the interests of<br />
producers and consumers. We have been<br />
particularly concerned to ensure that this balance<br />
is maintained.<br />
In recent years Australia has adopted a more<br />
open and outgoing approach to international<br />
trade. There has been a natural and permanent<br />
shift in Australia's position, flowing from the<br />
rapid expansion of our mineral exports and our<br />
growing self-sufficiency in certain commodities,<br />
particularly oil. It is true that in recent<br />
months we have had to take measures, in<br />
response to domestic unemployment, which<br />
may be construed as a contrary trend. Nevertheless,<br />
the net effect of our currency appreciation<br />
and tariff reductions has been significant.<br />
By the standards of our history. Australia has<br />
moved into a new era of freedom and openness<br />
in international economic policies. The more I consider the problems of the international<br />
economic order, the morelI am convinced<br />
that a retreat into economic isolationism is<br />
no answer for us or any other nation. The temptation<br />
to adopt an inward-looking and excessively<br />
protective economic stance must be<br />
resisted. Attempts to restrict trade further would<br />
be self-defeating. In the longer term it would<br />
result in a much worse situation for us all. I reiterate<br />
our support for the OECD trade pledge of<br />
May this year. The current world situation<br />
makes it all the more important to ensure that<br />
the forthcoming multi -lateral trade negotiations<br />
are successful and provide the conditions for a<br />
further boost to world trade. The nations of the<br />
world must not allow their immediate problems<br />
to detract from these negotiations, which in<br />
themselves would be an expression of confidence<br />
in the world economy.<br />
In recent years Australia has developed a new<br />
spirit of self-confidence and self-reliance. In<br />
many of its policy decisions my Government has<br />
reflected this development and, I believe, has<br />
helped to shape and guide it. Our sense of<br />
national independence has sharpened and<br />
matured. One of the reasons for this has been<br />
the entry of Britain into the Common Market.<br />
We continue to hope that British membership<br />
will encourage the Community to adopt a more<br />
outward-looking approach to the international<br />
economic scene. In the context of Britain's endeavour<br />
to renegotiate the terms of its membership<br />
of the community, the last thing Australia<br />
is seeking is a restoration of her old-style pref<br />
erential relationship with Britain. In the discussions<br />
with the British on the possibility of arranging<br />
a long-term agreement on the supply<br />
of sugar two months ago, we made it clear that<br />
any such arrangement would need to be made<br />
with the Community or at least have the Coinmunity'sendorsement.<br />
We have successfully<br />
adjusted the pattern of our trade to take account<br />
of British membership. The progress which<br />
Australia had made in recent years in diversifying<br />
its export markets, and the generally strong<br />
demand in most world commodity markets over<br />
the past two years, have considerably reduced<br />
the immediate impact on Australia of the Community's<br />
enlargement.<br />
Our ability to overcome these transitional problems<br />
has reinforced our self -confidence. We are<br />
not concerned to turn back the clock. We regard </p>
<p>any renegotiation of Britain's membership as a<br />
matter for Britain and her European partners.<br />
We will, however, continue to press our own<br />
interests as effectively as we can. We will seek<br />
amendments to those areas of Community policy,<br />
including parts of the common agricultural<br />
policy, which adversely affect Australia. We will<br />
not be appealing to British sentiment but to the<br />
interests of Britain and all her partners in the<br />
Community. I am well aware that in political terms consumers<br />
are not as well organised as producers.<br />
Nevertheless, I would have thought that at a<br />
time of high inflation European countries would<br />
see advantages in seeking cheaper food.<br />
Australia has a particularly efficient farming<br />
community, and I stress the advantages to<br />
Europe of allowing greater access to agricultural<br />
imports. In multi-lateral trade negotiations<br />
Australia will press her objective of reasonable<br />
access to world markets for agricultural products<br />
from countries like Australia. In determining<br />
the concessions we will offer in these negotiations,<br />
we will have one basic considerationthe<br />
willingness of others to negotiate on primary<br />
products. We were disappointed that the outcome<br />
of the Kennedy Round was a concentration<br />
on tariff reductions in the industrial sector.<br />
It is our earnest hope that on this occasion<br />
concessions on agriculture will move in parallel<br />
with those in other areas.<br />
This question cannot be separated from the<br />
wish of European countries to obtain secure<br />
supplies of materials, particularly energy<br />
resources. I take one example of immediate and<br />
pressing concern to Australia, the ban currently<br />
imposed by the Community on imports of beef.<br />
Australia, over some years, has made significant<br />
investments specifically for the supply<br />
of beef to Europe and Japan. Our confidence in<br />
the security of future investments must be<br />
affected by the abrupt manner in which Europe<br />
and Japan have sought to shift the burden of<br />
excessive beef supplies primarily to exporting<br />
nations such as Australia. Are we now expected<br />
to engage in further massive investment in coal,<br />
for example, when our legitimate interests can<br />
be treated with such disdain in other areas? We<br />
are proceeding with our attempts to avoid<br />
further market disruption in beef. We have<br />
proposed that a consultative group be established<br />
within GATT for this purpose and I am hopeful that the Community will lend its support<br />
to this suggestion.<br />
Another area in which there is heightened Australian<br />
awareness of our national interest concerns<br />
the role of overseas capital in our economy.<br />
The extent of European investment in<br />
Australia bears witness to the scope of fruitful<br />
co-operation in this area. We believe that overseas<br />
capital must continue to play a significant<br />
role, in partnership with Australian capital, in<br />
promoting our future economic growth. We<br />
have, however, adopted a more selective approach<br />
than hitherto towards such investment.<br />
We have a firm policy objective of promoting<br />
Australian ownership of our resources and<br />
industries. When my Government took office<br />
68 per cent of our energy resources were controlled<br />
overseas. We could not allow such a<br />
trend to continue. Our new investment policy.<br />
while firm on this point, is being applied in a<br />
pragmatic fashion with each case being considered<br />
on its merits.<br />
I referred at the outset to the problems of<br />
developing countries. These nations have<br />
suffered considerable deterioration in their<br />
terms of trade during recent years. Their already<br />
severe difficulties have become more acute.<br />
Many of the matters on which I have already<br />
touched are relevant in this context. The comments<br />
I have made on Australia's development<br />
of its mineral resources are in accord with the<br />
interests of many developing nations. Many of<br />
our partners in the International Bauxite Association<br />
and those proposing the Association of<br />
Iron Ore Exporting Nations are developing<br />
countries. Australia's desire to broaden the<br />
world's access -to agricultural markets and<br />
stabilise those markets is of great importance to<br />
developing nations. The multi-lateral trade<br />
negotiations must make a special effort to accommodate<br />
their needs.<br />
Australia has a special interest and a special responsibility<br />
in promoting the development of<br />
countries in the Asian and Pacific region. We<br />
welcome the steps which the European community<br />
is taking to promote trade and aid with<br />
our neighbours. In particular, I think of the contribution<br />
made through the United Nations<br />
Emergency Fund to those countries hardest hit<br />
by the energy crisis, the declaration of intent for<br />
Commonwealth Asian countries, the com-</p>
<p>munity's efforts to foster ties with ASEAN, as<br />
well as the possible extension of your Association<br />
arrangements to include, among others,<br />
certain of our neighbours in the South Pacific.<br />
I am glad that periodic consultations, either at<br />
ministerial or senior official level, will be taking<br />
place between Australia and the European<br />
Commission. It is my firm hope that my present<br />
visit to Europe, the consultations which will be<br />
held with the Commission in future the specific<br />
discussions of uranium and coal supplies and<br />
the contacts we shall have with individual<br />
member states of the community will enable<br />
Australia to develop a firm, many-sided and cooperative<br />
relationship with the new Europe.<br />
We regard European economic and political<br />
integration as one of the great historical forward<br />
movements of this century. We see a strong<br />
European Community as an essential pillar of<br />
world-wide economic stability. In this context I<br />
give an assurance that Australia will play its full<br />
and proper role in the resolution of the world's<br />
economic difficulties. </p>
