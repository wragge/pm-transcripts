PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS -26 AUGUST 1983<br />
OPENING. OF 50TH ANNIVERSARY CONFERENCE<br />
" AN AUSTRALIAN VIEW OF THE WORLD"<br />
IT WAS WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I ACCEPTED THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS'I INVITATION TO<br />
ADDRESS ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY JUBILEE CONFERENCE,<br />
AS AN INDEPENDENT, NON-POLITICAL ORGANIZATION<br />
DEDICATED TO PrROMOTING INTEREST IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, THE<br />
INSTITUTE HAS OVER THE YEARS MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD<br />
AROUND US. THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br />
FOREIGN POLICY SHOULD NOT BE THE EXCLUSIVE PRESERVE<br />
OF POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS.<br />
A SUCCESSFUL FOREIGN POLICY MUST BE GROUNDED IN<br />
WELL-INFORMED PUBLIC APPRECIATION OF THE ISSUES AND THEIR<br />
IMPLICATIONS. A GOVERNMENT'S FOREIGN POLICY WILL ULTIMATELY STAND<br />
OR FALL ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT COMMA1NDS THE PUBLIC SUPPORT<br />
* AND UNDERSTANDING OF ITS DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCY. / 2 </p>
<p>WHERE SUCH SUPPORT IS NOT FORTHCOMING EVEN<br />
VIGOROUSLY PURSUED POLICIES WILL COLLAPSE, UNITED STATES<br />
POLICY TOWARDS VIETNAM IN THE 1960' WAS A CASE IN POINT.<br />
THE INSTITUTE, PROVIDING AS IT DOES A FORUM AND A<br />
WIDE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF<br />
INFORMATION AND THE FREE EXPRESSION OF VIEWS, IS PERFORMING<br />
AN INVALUABLE SERVICE.<br />
I HAVE BEEN INVITED TODAY TO OFFER AN AUSTRALIAN<br />
VIEW OF THE WORLD, AN AUSTRALIAN VIEW MUST INEVITABLY BE'<br />
SHAPED BY THE FACT THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF WESTERN TRADITIONS<br />
AND ALLIANCES PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN THE ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION,<br />
THE REGION HAS COME TO OCCUPY A CRUCIAL PLACE IN<br />
OUR PERCEPTIONS, ITS DYNAMISM HAS PRESENTED MAJOR ECONOMIC AND<br />
TRADING OPPORTUNITIES THAT HAVE UNDERPINNED AN HISTORICALLY<br />
MOMENTOUS REDIRECTION OF AUSTRALIAN TRADING INTERESTS, ITS<br />
CULTURAL VIGOUR AND THE INCREASINGLY ACTIVE POLITICAL DIALOGUE<br />
WE SHARE WITH COUNTRIES OF THE REGION HAVE STIMULATED CLOSE<br />
INVOLVEMENT BY MANY AUSTRALIANS WITH THE AREA, THIS HAS ALL BEEN<br />
ACCOMPANIED BY CLOSE AND CONTINUING ATTENTION BY MY GOVERNMENT<br />
TO THE PREOCCUPATIONS AND CONCERNS OF THE REGION, </p>
<p>THE CAMBODIAN ISSUE A MAJOR THREAT TO REGIONAL<br />
P. EACE AND STABILITY STANDS OUT. IT HAS SEEN MY GOVERNMENT<br />
SACTIVELY EXPLORING WITH ALL THE PARTIES PRINCIPAL THE SCOPE<br />
FOR PROGRESS. WE HAVE DONE THIS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF AN<br />
ESPECIALLY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ASEAN COUNTRIES DEVELOPED<br />
OVER MANY YEARS. WE HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TO ENCOURAGE RESUMPTION<br />
BY VIETNAM OF ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS.<br />
AT THE SAME. TIME A VIGOROUS AND MOST FRUITFUL DIALOGUE HAS<br />
BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH CHINA AND THE GROUND HAS BEEN LAID FOR<br />
A REVITALIZATION AND EXTENSION OF THE ABSOLUTELY VITAL<br />
RELATIONSHIP WE ENJOY WITH JAPAN.<br />
THIS REGIONAL FOCUS DOES NOTHING TO GAINSAY THE<br />
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE AUSTRALIA ATTACHES TO ITS RELATIONS<br />
WITH THE UNITED STATES AND THE WESTERN ALLIANCE MORE GENERALLY.<br />
WE ARE AN ALIGNED NATION AND REGARD THIS FACT AS BEING BASIC<br />
TO OUR INTERNATIONAL APPROACH.<br />
SINCE PRIME MINISTER JOHN CURTIN MOVED TO FORGE CLOSER<br />
LINKS WITH THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE SEEN THE RELATIONSHIP GROW<br />
INTO A MULTIFACETED, MATURE AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PARTNERSHIP.<br />
THAT RELATIONSHIP IS NOW IN BETTER SHAPE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME<br />
IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD. IT HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED BY A WILLINGNESS<br />
ON BOTH SIDES TO FACE UP TO ISSUES AND TO LOOK AGAIN AT THOSE<br />
ASPECTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP PREVIOUSLY TAKEN FOR GRANTED. THE<br />
UNDERSTANDINGS OF OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS, AND THAT OF NEW ZEALAND,<br />
IN REGARD TO ANZUS IS A CASE IN POINT, OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE<br />
UNITED STATES IS VITAL TO US; ITS VIGOUR MUST BE SUSTAINED. S, </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA DOES NOT SEEK AN EXAGGERATED ROLE FOR<br />
ITSELF IN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE MAJOR ISSUES BEDEVILLING<br />
WORLD ORDER. WE HAVE A REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE LIMITS<br />
TO OUR OWN INFLUENCE. BUT AS A COUNTRY INTIMATELY INVOLVED<br />
WITH. THE ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION, ENJOYING CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE<br />
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES<br />
AND BEING A RECOGNISED PARTICIPANT IN MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS,<br />
WE CAN EXPECT ATTENTION TO OUR VIEWS.<br />
THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TASK MY GOVERNMENT HAS SET<br />
ITSELF IS TO ESTABLISH A NATIONALLY CO-ORDINATED RELATIONSHIP<br />
BETWEEN OUR POLITICAL, DEFENCE, SECURITY AND TRADING OBJECTIVES<br />
WHILE APPRECIATING THAT AUSTRALIA'S DESTINY IS IRRETRIEVABLY<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR REGION, THE FASTEST GROWING AREA OF THE WORLD<br />
ECONOMY. WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE PACE OR PATTERN OF ITS<br />
DEVELOPMENT. BUT WE ARE AIMING TO FASHION A RANGE OF RELEVANT<br />
POLICIES IN A WAY BEST CALCULATED TO ACHIEVE A FRUITFUL AND<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION,<br />
COPING WITH THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
RECESSION AND CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR PEACE AND STABILITY<br />
MUST RATE HIGH ON ANY INTERNATIONAL AGENDA. AUSTRALIA IS DOING<br />
WHAT IT CAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY<br />
THROUGH ITS OWN SOUNDLY BASED DOMESTIC POLICIES AND TO PROMOTE,<br />
TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, PROGRESS IN THE CRITICAL AREA OF ARMS<br />
CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT, </p>
<p>THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR MERITS PARTICULAR<br />
ATTENTION, THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE-CASE BECAUSE RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS HAVE DETERIORATED TO A POINT WHICH<br />
MUST CONCERN ALL OF US.<br />
LOCALIZED CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE ALSO CONTINUE<br />
UNABATED, NO REGION IS IMMUNE. THE MIDDLE EAST, CENTRAL<br />
AMERICA, SOUTHEAST ASIA, AFRICA ARE ALL WITNESS TO CONFLICTS<br />
WHICH NOT ONLY ARE EXTRAORDINARILY COSTLY IN TERMS OF LIVES<br />
LOST BUT ALSO FREQUENTLY CARRY THE RISK OF A BROADER<br />
CONFLAGRATION. IT IS ESPECIALLY TRAGIC THAT IN MANY INSTANCES<br />
THESE CONFLICTS ARE TOTALLY FUTILE AND COULD OR SHOULD HAVE<br />
BEEN AVOIDED. SOME OF THESE SITUATIONS REVEAL A FAILURE OF<br />
MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY THE<br />
UNDERLYING PRESSURES AT WORK.<br />
INDEED IT IS NECESSARY THAT EFFECTIVE STEPS BE<br />
TAKEN TO RESTORE THE CREDIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THOSE<br />
INSTITUTIONS. AUSTRALIA'S CANDIDATURE FOR THE UNITED NATION'S<br />
SECURITY COUNCIL IS A MEASURE OF OUR CONCERN. THE UNITED<br />
NATIONS CAN SUPPLY A MACHINERY WHEREBY COUNTRIES CAN PURSUE s #/ 6 </p>
<p>THEIR NATIONAL INTERESTS, OR OPPOSE THE PURSUIT OF THE<br />
INTERESTS OF OTHERS, BY MEANS SHORT OF THE USE OF FORCE,<br />
ITS POTENTIAL SHOULD BE RECOGNISED AND EXPLOITED,<br />
IN THIS WAY, IDEALLY, PRESSURE POINTS IN<br />
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CAN BE CONTAINED,<br />
PROGRESS, HOWEVER, IS NOT LIKELY TO BE RAPID,<br />
ACCOMMODATION OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS REQUIRES A<br />
SUBTLE AND REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE LIMITS TO PROGRESS,<br />
THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE WHEN THE INTERESTS OF THE<br />
SUPER-POWERS ARE ENGAGED,<br />
BUT COUNTRIES SUCH AS AUSTRALIA ALSO HAVE A<br />
RESPONSIBILITY MY GOVERNMENT WILL NOT SHIRK THIS RESPONSIBILITY,<br />
WE NATURALLY WILL WORK TO PROTECT AND ADVANCE<br />
AUSTRALIAN INTERESTS,<br />
AT THE SAME TIME WE SHALL, WITHIN THE RECOGNIZED<br />
CONSTRAINTS ON OUR OWN CAPABILITY AND INFLUENCE, BRING A<br />
DETERMINED APPROACH TO ESTABLISHING THE CONDITIONS FOR<br />
PEACE, OURS IS A SENSITIVE APPROACH RECOGNISING AT ONCE THE<br />
COMPLEXITY OF THE REAL WORLD BEYOND, AT THE SAME TIME AS<br />
17 </p>
<p>WORKING FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CHANGE. WE SHALL BE DOING WHAT WE<br />
CAN TO PROMOTE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONDITION OF THOSE PEOPLE<br />
LESS FORTUNATELY PLACED THAN OURSELVES.<br />
THIS IS MORE THAN A RHETORICAL COMMITMENT. THE<br />
PROBLEM OF DEVELOPMENT HAS A HUMAN FACE NONE OF US CAN<br />
IGNORE. THOSE AFFLICTED WITH THE SCOURGE OF POVERTY, HUNGER<br />
AND DISEASE MUST NOT BE NEGLECTED, WE SHALL CERTAINLY BE<br />
SUPPORTIVE. BUT IN PART THE SOLUTION LIES, AS MANY OF THE<br />
COUNTRIES OF OUR OWN REGION HAVE DEMONSTRATED, IN AN<br />
APPROPRIATE MIX OF DOMESTIC POLICIES BY THE GOVERNMENTS<br />
CONCERNED. IN PRACTICE THIS WILL OFTEN MEAN COPING EFFECTIVELY<br />
WITH CHANGE. WITHIN THE ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION THE PROCESS OF<br />
CHANGE IS OF QUITE STRIKING PROPORTIONS. RAPIDLY INCREASING<br />
PRODUCTIVITY, GROWING TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY, AND<br />
BURGEONING NATIONALISM CHARACTERISE THE REGION AND PRESENT<br />
AUSTRALIA WITH UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES, RISKS AND<br />
OPPORTUNITIES. AUSTRALIANS MUST ACCEPT THE INEVITABILITY OF THEIR<br />
OWN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE<br />
ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION. HOW SUCCESSFULLY THEY POSITION<br />
THEMSELVES WILL DEPEND NOT ONLY ON HOW ACCURATELY THEY<br />
APPRECIATE THE DYNAMISM OF THE AREA, BUT ALSO ON THE EXTENT<br />
TO WHICH THEY RECOGNISE THE PARTICULARITIES OF EACH COUNTRY </p>
<p>OF THE REGION AND ADAPT THEIR APPROACH ACCORDINGLY,<br />
IMPORTANTLY THIS RECOGNITION SHOULD INCLUDE APPRECIATION OF<br />
THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN ATTITUDE AND EXPECTATION<br />
BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND COUNTRIES OF THE REGION. THE CULTURAL<br />
TRADITIONS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS AT WORK ARE<br />
EXTRAORDINARILY DIVERSE AND MUST BE FULLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.<br />
IN SHORT AUSTRALIA CANNOT AFFORD TO REMAIN COCOONED-FROM<br />
EVENTS AROUND US.<br />
MOST OF THE GREAT ISSUES OF GLOBAL INTEREST<br />
WHETHER THEY BE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, THE<br />
RECESSION, THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR, OR. THREATS TO<br />
PEACE, FIND A REFLECTION IN THIS AREA, I SHOULD LIKE TO PAY<br />
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THIS REGIONAL ASPECT AS ITS<br />
IMPLICATIONS ARE OFTEN ONLY VAGUELY APPRECIATED.<br />
THOSE IMPLICATIONS ARE OFTEN COMPELLINGLY DIRECT<br />
NOT ONLY FOR OTHERS IN OUR AREA, BUT EVEN FOR AUSTRALIA<br />
ITSELF. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC<br />
ENVIRONMENT HAVE CONTRIBUTED IN PART TO THE ACUTE ECONOMIC<br />
DIFFICULTIES WE ARE NOW TRYING TO OVERCOME IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE COMBINATION OF OUR OWN<br />
EXPANSIONARY FISCAL POLICIES, OUR EFFORTS TO LOWER<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT AND CURB INFLATIONARY PRESSURES AND THE </p>
<p>REDISCOVERY THAT AUSTRALIANS ARE PREPARED TO WORK TOGETHER<br />
FOR COMMON PURPOSES HAS LAID THE BASIS FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. MY GOVERNMENT AIMS TO WIDEN, STRENGTHEN AND SUSTAIN<br />
THAT RECOVERY. FOR OUR NEAR NEIGHBOURS THE DAMAGE WROUGHT BY THE<br />
RECESSION HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY GREAT,<br />
BOTH PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND INDONESIA WHICH HAVE<br />
HAD GENERALLY GOOD RECORDS OF ECONOMIC STABILITY OVER THE<br />
PAST DECADE HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO MASSIVE DOMESTIC<br />
ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMS BY THE CONTRACTION IN WORLD TRADE AND<br />
LOW COMMODITY PRICES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS.<br />
A STRONG EXPANSION IN WORLD TRADE AS PART OF THE<br />
PROCESS OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS CRUCIAL TO<br />
THEIR FUTURE PROSPECTS.<br />
THE ISLAND STATES OF THE PACIFIC HAVE ALSO BEEN<br />
BADLY HURT BY THE RECESSION. AUSTRALIA IS PLAYING ITS FULL<br />
PART AS A SOURCE OF THE FINANCIAL AID THAT IS NECESSARY FOR<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL STABILITY OF THOSE NATIONS.<br />
THE COMPLEXITY AND INTIMACY OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
INVOLVEMENT WITH THOSE COUNTRIES WILL FIND A CLEAR </p>
<p>REFLECTION IN THE WORK OF THE FORTHCOMING SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM.<br />
MORE FUNDAMENTALLY THE RECESSION HAS HIGHLIGHTED<br />
HOW CRITICAL HAVE BECOME THE LINKAGES BETWEEN TRADE,, DEBT,<br />
INTEREST RATES AND THE STABILITY OF THE WORLD FINANCIAL<br />
SYSTEM. SUCH LINKAGES MUST BE RECOGNISED AND ADDRESSED. IT<br />
IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE TO DEAL WITH SUCH ISSUES IN A<br />
PIECEMEAL FASHION. a THE ItADHOCERY I OF THE PAST HAS BEEN<br />
SHOWN TO BE ENTIRELY INADEQUATE AND INAPPROPRIATE. IN ITS<br />
PLACE A MORE CERTAIN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MUST-BE BUILT.<br />
THE MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIAL<br />
COUNTRIES ARE CRUCIAL IF MOMENTUM IS TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR<br />
GLOBAL RECOVERY, BETTER EXPORT PROSPECTSi LESS PROTECTION<br />
AND MORE CAPACITY TO SERVICE DEBT. CAREFULLY CO-ORDINATED,<br />
WELL-CONSIDERED STRATEGIES MUST BE PUT IN PLACE.<br />
THE COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF SEVERAL OF<br />
THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION HAS BEEN IMPRESSIVE. THE MANNER<br />
IN WHICH THEY HAVE ADJUSTED TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF<br />
MAINTAINING A COMPETITIVE EDGE IN A TIGHT AND UNFORGIVING<br />
MARKET PLACE HAS LESSONS FOR US ALL. WHILE MISTAKES HAVE<br />
BEEN MADE, THE SPEED WITH WHICH MANY OF OUR NEIGHBOURS HAVE<br />
ALTERED INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES IN LINE WITH CHANGING<br />
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE HAS BEEN STRIKING. MORE* ADVANCED<br />
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, GROUNDED IN AN INCREASINGLY<br />
SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGICAL BASE, IS APPARENT IN THE DYNAMIC ./ 11 </p>
<p>GROWTH PATTERNS OF VERY MANY COUNTRIES OF THIS AREA. THE<br />
ADAPTATION OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF<br />
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY IMPRESSIVE,<br />
AUSTRALIANS MUST RECOGNISE WHAT IS HAPPENING AND<br />
ACCEPT THAT WE EITHER KEEP UP OR LOSE OUT. KEEPING UP WILL<br />
INVOLVE, INTER ALIA, ACCEPTANCE OF PLANNED STRUCTURAL CHANGE<br />
AT HOME. THIS IS FEASIBLE IN A DEMOCRATIC ANDi STILL,<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY EGALITARIAN SOCIETY LIKE AUSTRALIA ONLY IF<br />
THE COMMUNITY IS CONFIDENT THAT THE FRUITS OF ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH, AND THE BURDENS OF ADJUSTMENT, ARE BEING SHARED<br />
EQUITABLY. FOR AUSTRALIA THERE IS ALSO THE SOBERING<br />
REALIZATION THAT OUR OWN F. UTURE IS NOW MORE DEPENDENT ON OUR<br />
NEIGHBOURING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAN THEIRS WILL BE ON US.<br />
THIS SHOULD NOT FRIGHTEN US; BUT IT SHOULD GIVE US CAUSE TO<br />
THINK. COMPLACENCY CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE NO PLACE. RAPID<br />
GROWTH WITHIN THE REGION WILL PRESENT CONSIDERABLE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS. THE RAPID RISE IN<br />
ASIAN LIVING STANDARDS SHOULD SEE SHARP GROWTH IN POTENTIAL<br />
DEMAND FOR MANY AUSTRALIAN PRIMARY PRODUCTS. AUSTRALIA'S<br />
LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY IS IDEALLY SUITED TO CONTEMPORARY ASIAN<br />
NEEDS. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PROVISION OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
SERVICES AND SKILLS ARE CONSIDERABLE. WE MUST HOWEVER BE<br />
PREPARED TO WORK AND WORK HARD TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE<br />
EDGE. WE MUST TAKE SERIOUSLY THE TASK OF EXPLORING THE / 12 </p>
<p>POSSIBILITIES OF CLOSER ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THE<br />
REGION. A SIMPLE STARTING POINT MIGHT BE TO ASK OURSELVES<br />
WHETHER WE ARE MARSHALLING OUR RESOURCES BOTH HUMAN AND<br />
MATERIAL EFFECTIVELY ENOUGH TO ENSURE WE ARE NOT LEFT<br />
BEHI ND? THIS POINT CAN BE MADE NOT ONLY IN RESPECT OF OUR<br />
ECONOMIC AND TRADING RELATIONS WITH SEVERAL OF THE<br />
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OF THE REGION BUT ALSO WITH REGARD TO<br />
OUR BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNER JAPAN.<br />
THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF THE-ECONOMIC<br />
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN HAS BEEN RECOGNISED<br />
BY BOTH SIDES FOR MANY YEARS. CONSTANT REITERATION OF THIS<br />
RECOGNITION HAS, HOWEVER, TENDED TO OBSCURE FOR ALL BUT THE<br />
MOST ASTUTE OBSERVERS THE FACT THAT SUBSTANTIAL STRUCTURAL<br />
CHANGES HAVE BEEN AT WORK, A VIRTUAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE<br />
ECONOMIC BASIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP HAS OCCURRED, FEW HAVE<br />
RECOGNISED IT, EVEN FEWER HAVE PLANNED FOR IT. A<br />
REVITALIZATION IS NOW NEEDED,<br />
THE BALANCE: OF TRADE SURPLUS WHICH WORKED IN OUR<br />
FAVOUR FOR SOME DECADES HAS BEEN SLASHED IN HALF IN THE LAST<br />
HALF DECADE. JAPAN'S RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH, THOUGH STILL<br />
HIGH BY INDUSTRALIZED COUNTRY STANDARDS, HAS DECLINED.<br />
JAPAN HAS HAD TO REASSESS ITS ENERGY AND INDUSTRY POLICIES<br />
AND PUT IN PLACE MAJOR PROGRAMS OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT IN </p>
<p>THE FACE OF A LOSS OF COMPETITIVENESS OF ENERGY-INTENSIVE<br />
INDUSTRIES. WITH THISj THE GROWTH IN THE MARKET FOR RAW<br />
MATERIALS IN JAPAN THE MAINSTAY OF THE RECENT<br />
AUSTRALIAN/ JAPAN TRADE HAS SLOWED AND CAN ONLY BE EXPECTED<br />
TO GROW AT MORE MODERATE RATES DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE<br />
EIGHTIES. FROM 1970 TO 1981 AUSTRALIA'S EXPORTS AS A<br />
PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL JAPANESE IMPORTS FELL FROM 8 PER CENT TO<br />
MARGINALLY OVER 5 PER CENT. THIS DROP IN AUSTRALIA'S SHARE<br />
OF THE JAPANESE IMPORT MARKET REFLECTS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE<br />
CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND THE SCALE OF ADJUSTMENT<br />
NOW REQUIRED ON BOTH SIDES. AUSTRALIA'S EXPORTS TO JAPAN OF<br />
ENERGY FUELS AND INDUSTRIAL RAW MATERIALS WILL REMAIN<br />
IMPORTANT TO JAPAN AND LARGE IN ABSOLUTE TERMS. BUT THE<br />
PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH ARE LESS THAN WAS THE CASE IN<br />
THE PAST, AND WILL DEPEND IMPORTANTLY ON A SUSTAINED<br />
RECOVERY IN THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY.<br />
A MATTER OF RECENT AND PARTICULAR CONCERN TO<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN THE PRESSURE APPLIED BY SOME OF JAPAN'S<br />
MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS TO HAVE HER SWITCH HER BUYING PATTERN<br />
AT THE EXPENSE OF COUNTRIES SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, ATTEMPTS BY<br />
THE MAJORS TO NEGOTIATE SPECIAL DEALS WITH JAPAN THAT<br />
DISADVANTAGE US AS AN EFFICIENT, LOW-COST SUPPLIER SHOULD NOT<br />
BE ALLOWED TO CAUSE NEW PROBLEMS. THERE MUST BE NO CORROSION OF<br />
OUR COLLECTIVE INTERESTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. ,/ 14 </p>
<p>SHOULD JAPAN SUCCUMB TO SUCH PRESSURE THE<br />
IMPLICATIONS FOR AUSTRALIA'S BEEF, STEELMAKING, RAW MATERIAL<br />
AND ENERGY EXPORTS WOULD BE EXTREMELY SERIOUS. ASSURANCES<br />
BOTH MR BOWEN AND MR HAYDEN RECEIVED IN TOKYO THAT JAPAN<br />
WOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS AND CONCERNS<br />
WERE WELCOME, AS ALSO WAS THE ASSURANCE THAT AUSTRALIA'S<br />
TRADING INTERESTS WOULD NOT BE IMPAIRED AS A RESULT OF<br />
PRESSURES ON JAPAN FROM THE THE E. C. AND OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES. MY GOVERNMENT ATTACHES IMPORTANCE TO THESE<br />
ASSURANCES AND WILL BE WORKING TO SEE THAT THEY ARE PUT INTO<br />
EFFECT. WHAT IS NEEDED NOW TO DEVELOP THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN IS HARD WORK,<br />
RESOURCEFULNESS AND IMAGINATION. WE CAN BUILD ON THE HABITS<br />
OF CO-OPERATION BUILT UP WITH-JAPAN OVER MANY YEARS, BUT<br />
EXPECTATIONS MUST BE MORE REALISTI. C AND MOTIVATED BY THE<br />
LONGER-TERM VIEW. WE MUST BROADEN OUR TRADE INTERESTS IN<br />
JAPAN BY ACTIVELY SEEKING OUT TRADE OPPORTUNITIES IN THOSE<br />
SECTORS OF THE JAPANESE ECONOMY WHICH ARE GROWING FAST,<br />
THE RECENT AGREEMENT ACHIEVED BY MR BOWEN WITH<br />
JAPANESE MINISTERS TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE BETWEEN AUSTRALIA<br />
AND JAPAN TO EXAMINE CONCRETE WAYS OF ASSISTING AUSTRALIAN<br />
MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER EXPORTERS TO IDENTIFY MARKET<br />
OPPORTUNITIES AND TO PENETRATE THE JAPANESE MARKET IS A<br />
USEFUL AND VALUABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS NOW NEEDS TO BE BACKED<br />
UP BY A HARD-NOSED, SELF-RELIANT APPROACH THAT COMBINES $ 14/ 15 </p>
<p>MAXIMUM BACKING FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORTS THAT ARE<br />
AVAILABLE WITH A MEASURE OF COMPETENCE AND<br />
PERSISTENCE NOT ALWAYS APPARENT PREVIOUSLY. THE COMPLACENCY<br />
OF THE PAST, ENGENDERED AS IT MAY HAVE BEEN BY THE EXTENT<br />
AND DEPTH OF THE JAPANESE RELATIONSHIP, MUST NOW GIVE WAY TO<br />
A CONSTRUCTIVE EXPLORATION OF WAYS OF CARRYING THE<br />
RELATIONSHIP FORWARD.<br />
THE BASIS OF AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN<br />
IS, AS FOREIGN MINISTER ABE RECENTLY PUT IT TO MR HAYDEN,<br />
" FIRM AND UNSHAKEABLE', TOGETHER WE SHARE A BASIC<br />
COMMITMENT TO THE STRATEGIC INTERESTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL<br />
DEMOCRACIES. BOTH OUR COUNTRIES VALUE THE STABILITY OF THE<br />
ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION AS A WHOLE AND MY GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
WELCOMED JAPAN'S WILLINGNESS TO PLAY AN INCREASINGLY ACTIVE<br />
ROLE IN THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS OF THE REGION.<br />
ITS EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN STRATEGIC INTERESTS<br />
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE JAPAN UNITED STATES TREATY OF<br />
MUTUAL SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION HAS BEEN APPRECIATED.<br />
THE MATTER OF JAPAN'S BASIC DEFENCE POSTURE, AND<br />
PRESSURES ON HER FOR A DRAMATIC ACCELERATION OF HER DEFENCE<br />
SPENDING ARE RELEVANT IN THIS REGARD. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS<br />
WHAT JAPAN DOES IS A MATTER FOR HER TO DECIDE TAKING FULL<br />
ACCOUNT OF ITS OWN DOMESTIC CONSTRAINTS AND REGIONAL<br />
SENSIVITIES. I AM CONFIDENT THE JAPANESE LEADERSHIP<br />
RECOGNISES AND UNDERSTANDS THIS LATTER CONCERN. ,./ 16 </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA FOR ITS PART WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE<br />
JAPAN'S WILLINGNESS TO MAKE A NON-MILITARY CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
REGIONAL SECURITY. JAPAN'S ACTIVE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC<br />
ROLE AIMED AT RESOLVING REGIONAL CONFLICTS AND PRESERVING<br />
STABILITY IS ESPECIALLY VALUABLE.<br />
IT WILL BE APPARENT THAT AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH JAPAN IS AT ONCE COMPLEX AND FAR FROM STATIC. THE<br />
STRENGTH AND SIGNIFICANCE OF AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH<br />
JAPAN IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC SHOULD NEVER BE UNDERESTIMATED.<br />
BUT NOTHING IN THE RELATIONSHIP CAN OR SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR<br />
GRANTED. THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST CARRY NO GUARANTEE OF<br />
BEING SUSTAINED " IN PERPETUITY".<br />
CONSTANT ATTENTION MUST CONTINUE TO BE GIVEN TO THE<br />
FUNDAMENTALS IF OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS ARE TO BE FURTHERED.<br />
THE SAME IS TRUE, IN A QUITE DIFFERENT CONTEXT, OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH CHINA.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN REMARKABLE GROWTH IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
LINKS WITH CHINA AND IN CHINA'S CONTACTS WITH THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. FOR MY OWN PART I WAS ESPECIALLY<br />
PLEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE<br />
ADDRESSED THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION AT THE<br />
SESSION WHERE CHINA ASSUMED HER RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THAT<br />
AUGUST BODY. / 17 </p>
<p>17<br />
THE OPPORTUNITIES OPENING UP AS CHINA HAS DEVELOPED<br />
ECONOMIC POLICIES FACILITATING TRADE AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY<br />
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLE. INDEED WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CHINA<br />
TODAY IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT TO THE WORLD AT LARGE. I DOUBT<br />
THE MOMENTOUS CHARACTER OF THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE THERE IS<br />
AS FULLY APPRECIATED AS IT SHOULD BE.<br />
CHINA HAS MADE A DRASTIC CHANGE IN THE RURAL<br />
SECTOR; THEY HAVE GIVEN THE PEASANTS THE OPPORTUNITY OF<br />
PRIVATE ACCUMULATION. AND THIS HAS HAD A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON<br />
PRODUCTION LEVELS. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE WHOLE CONCEPT IS<br />
BEING INTRODUCED INTO SECONDARY INDUSTRY AND INTO THE<br />
CITIES. IT HAS BEEN DONE IN A QUITE FUNDAMENTAL WAY. THE<br />
CONCEPT OF PRODUCTION TARGETS ARE BEING DISPLACED NOW BY<br />
PROFIT TARGETS, AND IF ENTERPRISES ARE NOT PROFITABLE THEY<br />
EITHER GO OUT OF BUSINESS OR THEY ARE TAKEN OVER BY<br />
ENTERPRISES WHICH ARE PROFITABLE. ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IS A<br />
TOTAL CHANGE TAKING PLACE IN THE BASES OF REMUNERATION<br />
HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY. HORIZONTALLY NOW THERE IS NOT<br />
EQUALITY OF REMUNERATION, INSTEAD THERE IS REWARD ACCORDING<br />
TO OUTPUT. VERTICALLY THERE IS A MUCH WIDER DISPERSION OF<br />
REWARDS ACCORDING TO SKILLS AND RESPONSIBILITY.<br />
AN ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE NOT MERELY IN<br />
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT PRACTISES BUT IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF CHINA<br />
IS THEREFORE TAKING PLACE, </p>
<p>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT, THEREFORE THAT AUSTRALIA HAVE<br />
A STRONG AND CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA. MORE AND<br />
MORE THE CHINESE SYSTEM AND ITS PHILOSOPHY IS BECOMING<br />
COMPATIBLE WITH OUR SORTS OF VALUES. IT IS NOT GOING TO<br />
BECOME A DEMOCRACY IN OUR SENSE, BUT IN TERMS OF ITS<br />
CONCEPTS, AND PRACTISES IT IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE<br />
COMPATIBLE WITH THE WAY WE GO ABOUT THINGS.<br />
PREMIER ZHAO ZIYANG'S AUSTRALIAN VISIT EARLIER THIS<br />
YEAR CERTAINLY SHARPENED MY GOVERNMENT'S APPRECIATION OF THE<br />
POTENTIAL IN THIS SITUATION. PREMIER ZHAO FOR HIS PART TOOK<br />
AWAY, I KNOW, A KEEN APPRECIATION OF THE DYNAMIC SKILLS AND<br />
PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTRY; HE HAS SINCE WRITTEN EXTENDING<br />
ME AN INVITATION TO VISIT CHINA. I HOPE BEFORE MUCH LONGER<br />
TO TAKE UP THIS INVITATION SO AS TO ACQUAINT MYSELF AT FIRST<br />
HAND WITH THE NEW CHINA.<br />
AUSTRALIA AND CHINA HAVE BOTH GAINED FROM THE FACT<br />
THAT RELATIONS TO DATE HAVE BEEN BUILT ON THE BASIS OF<br />
RESPECT FOR AND. UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER'S INDEPENDENCE<br />
AND SOVEREIGNTY. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US AND THEY MUST BE<br />
NARROWED. CAMBODIA IS A CASE IN POINT.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH COMMON GROUND IN<br />
THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN </p>
<p>19<br />
SITUATION, POWERFUL, OFTEN DIFFERENT AND CONFLICTING<br />
INTERESTS ARE INVOLVED, BUT AS A COUNTRY WHICH COUNTS AMONG<br />
ITS CLOSE FRIENDS THE UNITED STATES, ASEAN AND CHINA, AND AS<br />
A COUNTRY ACCEPTED BY VIETNAM AS GENUINELY COMMITTED TO<br />
BRINGING PEACE TO THE REGION, AUSTRALIA IS UNIQUELY WELL<br />
PLACED TO IDENTIFY A BASIS FOR THE NECESSARY DIALOGUE<br />
HOPEFULLY WITH SOME SORT OF USEFUL RESULT,<br />
THIS IS WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT OF A COUNTRY WITH A<br />
RIGHTFUL ROLE TO PLAY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION,<br />
I BELIEVE OUR ROLE IS NOT ONLY RECOGNISED BUT<br />
RESPECTED, SOME PROGRESS IS BEING MADE ALBEIT PAINSTAKINGLY<br />
SLOWLY, IF NOTHING ELSE THE SITUATION HAS BEEN LOOSENED UP<br />
A BIT AND SIGNS OF FLEXIBILITY NOT PREVIOUSLY APPARENT<br />
ARE BEGINNING TO EMERGE, THIS HAS JUSTIFIED THE EFFORT TO<br />
DATE AND SUGGESTS WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK,<br />
WE MUST, HOWEVER, BE WARY OF THE TRAP OF EXPECTING<br />
DRAMATIC RESULTS, ALL HERE TODAY WOULD AGREE THAT ACQUIESCENCE IN THE<br />
STATUS QUO IN KAMPUCHEA WOULD BE INTOLERABLE VIETNAMESE<br />
TROOPS MUST BE WITHDRAWN FROM KAMPUCHEA AND THE PEOPLE OF<br />
THAT COUNTRY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY FREELY TO DECIDE THEIR<br />
OWN FUTURE, ,,, 1/ 20 </p>
<p>THERE IS NOW A VARIETY OF APPROACHES SUGGESTED AS<br />
A MEANS OF SECURING THESE OBJECTIVES. THE BASIS FOR THE<br />
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE APPROACHES IS UNDERSTANDABLE. THE<br />
RECENT ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS' COMMUNIQUE HAS PROVIDED SOME<br />
BASIS FOR OPTIMISM THAT THESE DIFFERENCES CAN, IF NOT<br />
RECONCILED, AT LEAST BE NARROWED. WE SHALL CERTAINLY KEEP<br />
UP OUR EFFORT AIMED AT HELPING TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD.<br />
THE SITUATION IS NO EASIER IN ANOTHER AREA TO WHICH<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS ATTACHED PARTICULAR PRIORITY ARMS<br />
CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT,<br />
THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER THE<br />
CONTROL OF EFFECTIVE AGREEMENTS, WE OWE THIS TO OURSELVES<br />
AND TO FUTURE GENERATIONS.<br />
ACCORDINGLY WE HAVE MOVED RAPIDLY TO ESTABLISH OUR<br />
INTEREST IN AND SUPPORT FOR BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS<br />
FOR GLOBAL AND REGIONAL DISARMAMENT ARRANGEMENTS.<br />
WE ARE WORKING ESPECIALLY HARD FOR THE<br />
REVITALIZATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL NON-PROLIFERATION REGIME<br />
AND FOR THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE WHICH COULD<br />
LEAD TO AGREEMENT ON A COMPREHENSIVE AND FULLY VERIFIABLE<br />
BAN ON NUCLEAR TESTING. / 21 </p>
<p>WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO STAND-BY WHILE ISSUES OF<br />
SUCH CRUCIAL MOMENT TO THE FUTURE OF MANKIND BECOME SOURCES<br />
OF CONFRONTATION RATHER THAN A BASIS FOR CO-OPERATION,<br />
EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO BUILD CONFIDENCE AS A BASIC<br />
PREREQUISITE TO PROGRESS IN THIS CRUCIAL AREA,<br />
WHILE THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY AND INITIATIVE IN<br />
THIS AREA RESTS WITH THE SUPER-POWERS, WE FOR OUR PART<br />
HAVE DELIBERATELY SOUGHT TO PUT INTO PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE<br />
RANGE OF ACTIONS AIMED AT ADDRESSING IN AS IMMEDIATE AND AS<br />
EFFECTIVE A WAY AS POSSIBLE THOSE AREAS WHERE AUSTRALIAN<br />
INTERESTS ARE DIRECTLY ENGAGED OR AUSTRALIAN ACTION STANDS<br />
SOME PROSPECT OF SUCCESS,<br />
THESE MEASURES HAVE INCLUDED:<br />
DEVELOPING IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR ANZUS<br />
TREATY COMMITMENTS, THE CONCEPT OF A NUCLEAR FREE<br />
ZONE IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, I EXPECT THIS MATTER TO<br />
FIGURE PROMINENTLY IN THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM NEXT WEEK,<br />
VIGOROUS CONDEMNATION OF CONTINUED UNDERGROUND<br />
TESTING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY FRANCE IN THE SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC,<br />
CONTINUED PRESSURE FOR NEGOTIATION OF AN EFFECTIVE<br />
COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY, </p>
<p>STRENUOUS EFFORTS, IN CO-OPERATION WITH OTHERS, TO<br />
DEVELOP A TREATY TO OUTLAW ALL FORMS OF CHEMICAL<br />
AND BIOLOGICAL WARFARE<br />
APPOINTMENT OF AN AMBASSADOR FOR DISARMAMENT<br />
THESE MEASURES OF THEMSELVES ARE NOT LIKELY TO<br />
PRODUCE A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE CURRENT GLOBAL<br />
SITUATION. BUT THEY DO REPRESENT A SERIOUS COMMITMENT BY<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO WORKING FOR A MEANINGFUL<br />
DETENTE AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES OF ARMS CONTROL.<br />
THEY SHOULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A QUALITATIVE<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN CONDITIONS WITHIN OUR OWN REGION WHERE, QUITE<br />
LEGITIMATELY, WE AND OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS CAN EXPECT OTHERS<br />
TO RESPECT OUR CONCERNS.<br />
WE ARE CONSCIOUS THAT THERE IS A STRONG<br />
UNDERCURRENT OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT ON THESE ISSUES, NOT ONLY<br />
IN AUSTRALIA BUT IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES THERE IS<br />
GROWING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THE<br />
CURRENT SITUATION, IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SUCH PUBLIC CONCERN<br />
DOES NOT ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND EXPRESSION IN THE<br />
SOVIET UNION. FOR OUR PART, A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT<br />
AND INTERESTED GROUPS IN AUSTRALIA ON HOW BEST TO PURSUE THE<br />
SEARCH FOR PEACE AND STABILITY THROUGH ARMS CONTROL AND<br />
DISARMAMENT IS SOMETHING I LOOK FORWARD TO AND ENCOURAGE. / 23 </p>
<p>MR CHAIRMAN, INEQUALITY, OPPRESSION AND CONFLICT CONTINUE TO<br />
RESTRICT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND AND CAUSE HUMAN<br />
SUFFERING. HENCE THE NEED MY GOVERNMENT FEELS TO WORK TO<br />
ERADICATE SOURCES OF INJUSTICE, TO REVERSE THE TREND TOWARDS<br />
MILITARISM IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TO PROMOTE HARMONY<br />
AND MUTUAL TRUST BETWEEN STATES.<br />
EMBARKING ON THIS COURSE DOES NOT IMPLY ANY RADICAL<br />
REDIRECTION IN AUSTRALIA S APPROACH TO THE WORLD, INDEED AS<br />
I HAVE NOTED BEFORE A HIGH DEGREE OF CONTINUITY, CONSISTENCY<br />
AND CONSENSUS CHARACTERIZE AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN POLICY.<br />
WHAT IS APPARENT IS THAT THE WORLD IS NOT STANDING<br />
STILL. AUSTRALIA S RELATIONS. WITH MOST COUNTRIES ARE IN<br />
GOOD SHAPE, NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE ALWAYS ISSUES AND<br />
SITUATIONS ARISING WHICH OFFER THE PROSPECT OF DEVELOPING<br />
MOST OF THOSE RELATIONS IN MUTUALLY HARMONIOUS AND<br />
BENEFICIAL DIRECTIONS. ESTABLISHED FRIENDSHIPS CAN BE<br />
REINFORCED AND NEW LINKS FORGED, / 24 </p>
<p>SIMILARLY THE BIG GLOBAL ISSUES OF THE DAY WILL NOT<br />
AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO PASS US BY, WE WANT TO DEAL<br />
WITH THE WORLD AS IT REALLY IS, NOT AS WE MIGHT PREFER OR<br />
WANT IT TO. BE.<br />
WE SHALL NOT SHIRK OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. WE WILL,<br />
WHERE APPROPRIATE, SEEK TO REGISTER AS EFFECTIVELY AS WE ARE<br />
ABLE AUSTRALIAN VIEWS AND CONCERNS.<br />
WE ARE WORKING BOTH DELIBERATELY AND<br />
SELF-CONFIDENTLY TO ESTABLISH A RESPECTED AUSTRALIAN<br />
IDENTITY IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA.<br />
THE PRESSURES TO REACT TO CHANGE WILL AT TIMES BE<br />
CONSIDERABLE, BUT THE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED WILL OFTEN<br />
ALSO HOLD OUT THE PROSPECT OF. CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS TO<br />
AUSTRALIAN INTERESTS. THE CHALLENGE IS TO RESPOND<br />
APPROPRIATELY. IN THIS SENSE CHANGE IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE FEARED.<br />
INDEED CHANGE,,,.. PROGRESS IS SOMETHING OFTEN WORTH WORKING<br />
FOR IF NOT FOR ITS OWN SAKE, AT LEAST FOR THE BENEFITS IT<br />
WILL OFTEN BRING. SUPPORT FOR CHANGE MAY INDEED BE A MORAL<br />
IMPERATIVE. WHERE IT IS, WE MUST BE PREPARED TO STAND UP<br />
AND BE COUNTED. THIS MAY SOMETIMES BE THE ONLY WAY TO DRAW<br />
ATTENTION TO AND HOPEFULLY ACHIEVE REDRESS FOR SITUATIONS OF<br />
INJUSTICE, </p>
<p>ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, PROGRESS HINGES ON NATIONS<br />
BEING PREPARED TO WORK TOGETHER. FOR ITS PART MY GOVERNMENT<br />
IS PREPARED TO GET OUT AND GRAPPLE WITH THE ISSUES, TO BRING<br />
A SENSITIVE AND FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO BEAR. WE ARE A<br />
REALISTIC AND CONSTRUCTIVE PEOPLE, AND I BELIEVE AUSTRALIA<br />
CAN MAKE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION. THE STATE OF THE WORLD<br />
AND ESPECIALLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN REGION, DEMAND<br />
IT. </p>
