    <content><![CDATA[<p>Our thoughts are with the families of Mackay, who today are attempting to deal with the impacts of extensive flooding.</p>
<p>Overnight and morning heavy rains have essentially isolated Mackay, with the airport closed and roads to both the north and south blocked and only limited communications available.</p>
<p>Despite this latest blow, I am sure Queenslanders will again rally together, as they did so magnificently last month to help other families in need.</p>
<p>The Federal Member for Dawson, James Bidgood has been in constant contact with my office, local families, small business operators and local government officials since early this morning.</p>
<p>A Disaster Situation has been declared for the Mackay District.</p>
<p>Joint State and Commonwealth-funded Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements have also been triggered for Mackay and 12 other local government areas.</p>
<p>This will enable local families, small businesses operators, primary producers and councils to access a range of assistance measures.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank those emergency service personnel and volunteers who again have again responded to this latest urgent situation without hesitation.</p>
<p>Finally I urge everyone in flood affected areas to stay safe and follow the directions of the experts like the police and emergency services.</p>
