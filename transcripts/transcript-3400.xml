REFERENCE TO I. A. C. ON ROLLING STOCK PRODUCING INDUSTRY<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had<br />

the Commission's Tariff Review program which was commenced<br />
by the Tariff Board in 1971.<br />
The Commission had been asked to report within the<br />
next 18 months on the assistance, if any, needed by the<br />
industry. The Government would then have the benefit of the<br />
Commission's advice when considering extension of the<br />
two year purchase program for modern high performance<br />
