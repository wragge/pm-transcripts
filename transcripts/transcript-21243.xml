    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce almost $18 million in grants under Tough on Drugs for community organisations to provide treatment, rehabilitation and support for those affected by illicit drugs.</p>
<p>Sixty four non-government treatment services will receive funding as part of this announcement for a range of projects to deliver treatment, prevention and support services to help individuals and families recover from drug use and resume a normal healthy life.</p>
<p>Today';s successful recipients represent communities across all states and territories.  Successful organisations in Queensland include:</p>
<p>#61623; Teen Challenge, which is receiving $210,046 to establish a Drug Overdose Visitation Project.  #61623; Gold Coast Drug Council, which is receiving $223,675 to establish a Youth Dual Diagnosis Support Programme.  #61623; We Help Ourselves (WHOS), which is receiving $1,358,495 to establish the WHOS Sunshine Coast service.</p>
<p>These funds are provided under the Non-Government Organisation Treatment Grants Programme, through which the Government is working closely with local communities to help our young people reject illicit drugs.  Since 1998, the Government has provided over $123 million to over 200 projects under this programme.</p>
<p>In allocating these funds to community organisations, the Government receives advice from the Australian National Council on Drugs (ANCD). In preparing this advice, the ANCD draws on its own members'; experience in providing community-based treatment for users of illicit drugs.  I would like to thank the ANCD for its guidance and advice in the fight against illicit drug use in Australia.</p>
<p>Since 1997, the Government has committed more than $1 billion to Tough on Drugs to reduce the supply of and demand for illicit drugs.  Tough on Drugs is working.  The 2001 National Drug Strategy Household Survey reported a 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people using illicit drugs in the previous three years.  Since 1999, there has been a 67 per cent drop in heroin-related deaths for people aged 15 to 55 years.  Australian Government law enforcement agencies have prevented over nine tonnes of illicit drugs from reaching Australian streets since 1997.</p>
<p>I am very proud of the government';s continued commitment to our young people and their families under Tough on Drugs.  Through the partnership between government, individuals and community organisations, we are making a real difference in our communities.  I wish all treatment services funded in today';s announcement and their communities every success in this vital work.</p>
