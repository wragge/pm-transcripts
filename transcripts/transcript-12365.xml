<p>I am frequently asked as I move around Australia and most particularly by children and younger people what is it about my job as Prime Minister that I like and enjoy the most. And I was asked this yesterday by a group of young children who were visiting Canberra as part of a visit by all of those children in Australia who are educated through distance education. I invariably reply, because it is the case, that the thing I enjoy most is the opportunity that it gives me to meet different groups of Australians, men and women in all different walks of life, in different parts of our country. And one never tires because one is constantly fascinated and reinvigorated as one meets new groups of Australians and understands the incredible diversity and vivacity of our population.</p>
<p>Because I guess it';s the Centenary of Federation year and because of the great focus on Australia of the Olympic Games, we';ve had occasion to look at ourselves a lot more over the last year and the world has looked at us a lot more and the world has been pretty pleased at what it';s seen. That is not to say that this country is without blemish or without flaws. But it is a country in good heart. It is a country that has produced and continues to produce great people and we';ve seen a large number of them on display tonight. And if you look back on that special honour roll of distinguished Australians, the past Australians of the Year, you find a great variety of people who';ve made their mark on our nation and impressed the rest of the world. </p>
<p>We are a nation of great individuals. We are a nation of courageous people. We are a nation of contributors and achievers. And past Australians of the Year all qualify for all of those descriptions. And it is therefore with great pleasure that I announce that the Australian of the year for 2001 is Lieutenant General Peter Cosgrove.</p>
