LETTER TO NEW SOUTH WALES PREMIER<br />
KURNELL DISPUTE<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the following letter to the<br />
Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran:<br />
Mr dear Premier, I am writing to you again in respect of the critical<br />
situation at the Kurnell refinery.<br />
I am concerned that bans continue to be applied by<br />
the operators despite undertakings given to the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission in June that they would return to<br />
normal work once the Federal award was suspended.<br />
These bans severely limit the bringing into production<br />
of the new facilities at Kurnell. This has adverse implications<br />
for the supply of petroleum products to the New South Wales<br />
market in general and the Sydney market in particular.<br />
I appreciate that your Government through the Minister<br />
for Industrial Relations, Mines an,, Energy, Mr Hills, has<br />
taken a number of initiatives to have the bans lifted. However,<br />
to date there has not been a successful resolution of the<br />
situation. You -: il aree that it is in the interast of the<br />
people of New South Wales and the Australian community<br />
generally that all available action should be taken to resolve<br />
the situation at Kurnell and to ensure the fullest possible<br />
operations of the facilities.<br />
Under the present arrangements, the operators are<br />
covered by the provisions of the New South Wales State Energy<br />
Authority Act. Accordingly, I ask how you see this matter<br />
developing and how you intend to achieve a full and proper<br />
lifting of the bans at Kurnell. Yours sincerely,<br />
Malcolm Fraser." </p>
