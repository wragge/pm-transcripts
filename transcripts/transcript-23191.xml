    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much. It is an extraordinary honour on behalf of the Government and Iâm confident, all the people of our country to congratulate this champion team and this team of champions.</p>
<p>In our country summer means cricket. A good summer is Australia versus England and a great summer is one where Australia beats England and didnât we whip them in this particular series?</p>
<p>The Ashes are the worldâs oldest, continuous sporting contest. They are proof that the greatest of friendships can coexist with the fiercest of competitions and I just want to say to all of our players â thank you for making every one of us so proud this summer, and thank you for showing the grit and the character which you displayed this summer. </p>
<p>I want to pay tribute to every one of you, but Iâve got to mention Mitchell Johnson â the Man of the Series, Brad Haddin and Chris Rogers â the batsmen who never let us down, Michael Clarke â the Captain courageous and of course Darren Lehmann and Craig McDermott â the coaches who had faith in the players</p>
<p>You made the improbable achievable. Â You were the Improbables because no one expected you to win. Youâve been the Unchangeables â the first team in a hundred years to be unchanged through a whole series â and we want you to become the Invincibles by going on to beat South Africa. </p>
<p>Thatâs your challenge and as itâs pretty obvious we are all willing you to succeed. Congratulations, thank you and go from strength to strength.Â  </p>
