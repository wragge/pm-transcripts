SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOURTH MEETING OF THE COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN MINISTERS'<br />
COMMITTEE ON SOUTHERN AFRICA<br />
CANBERRA 7 AUGUST 1989<br />
The task ahead of this fourth meeting of the Commonwealth<br />
Foreign Ministers' Committee on Southern Africa is an<br />
important one for all members of the Commonwealth.<br />
More than that, you are engaged in an endeavour of truly<br />
global significance.<br />
The scourge of apartheid is an affront to all humanity.<br />
And eliminating that scourge bringing to an end South<br />
Africa's abhorrent practice of institutionalised racism is<br />
an obligation that demands the most committed involvement of<br />
every Government and individual of good will.<br />
The Commonwealth has a proud record of determined and<br />
effective struggle against the racist regimes of Southern<br />
Africa: in the period leading up to the withdrawal of South<br />
Africa from the Commonwealth in 1961;<br />
through the peaceful creation of majority rule in<br />
Zimbabwe; through the development of the Gleneagles Agreement<br />
banning sporting contacts with South Africa;<br />
through the achievement of the Eminent Persons Group in<br />
finding a valid and workable basis for a negotiated<br />
settlement in South Africa;<br />
through our role in developing international sanctions<br />
against South Africa and, with the regrettable exception<br />
of Britain, through our own co-ordinated imposition of<br />
sanctions, including financial sanctions;<br />
through our active support for the emergence of an<br />
independent Namibia;<br />
and through the continuing important work of this<br />
Committee. </p>
<p>, Australia is proud of the role it has played in these<br />
efforts and, indeed, in the broader international struggle<br />
against apartheid.<br />
We remain totally committed to fulfilling our<br />
responsibilities in these tasks.<br />
For all these reasons, then, it is a pleasure to welcome to<br />
Canberra our distinguished overseas visitors, and to wish<br />
this meeting success in the critical work ahead.<br />
We meet against a backdrop of confused signals and<br />
expectations about the current situation in South Africa.<br />
We hear talk of the release of Nelson Mandela and<br />
suggestions of negotiations with representative black<br />
organisations such as the African National Congress.<br />
of course these would be enormously welcome developments if<br />
ever they occurred.<br />
They would be substantial steps down the path towards the<br />
elimination of apartheid.<br />
But let us not forget the basic facts.<br />
The massive convulsions of the mid-1980s in which the<br />
black communities of South Africa were once again confronted<br />
by the violence with which apartheid represses its own<br />
citizens are no longer, due to censorship, the daily diet<br />
of western media reporting.<br />
But in the face of more than three years of consecutive<br />
states of emergency imposed by the South African<br />
authorities, the repression continues still.<br />
The grotesque system of apartheid continues the refusal of<br />
basic political rights to the black South Africans who make<br />
up 75 per cent of the population, the banning of black<br />
organisations, the jailing and exile of black leaders and of<br />
others who seek to speak out against the repression, the<br />
racially segregated Parliaments, the infamous Group Areas<br />
Act with its bizarre injustices of the homelands system.<br />
These are the basic and terrible facts before us.<br />
we can take comfort only from the fact that the internal<br />
contradictions of this system will ultimately bring about<br />
its demise.<br />
The responsibility of the international community not<br />
least of the Commonwealth is to try to bring the South<br />
African authorities to understand this, so that the<br />
inevitable end of apartheid will not be bloody civil war but<br />
a peaceful transition to majority rule.<br />
That is the purpose of sanctions to bring South Africa to<br />
its senses, not to its knees. </p>
<p>Leading South African financial spokesmen including the<br />
Governor of the South African Reserve Bank and the Finance<br />
Minister acknowledge that sanctions are working.<br />
South Africa is now facing a net outflow of capital at a<br />
time when It desperately needs foreign funding to help<br />
support the gross inefficiencies of apartheid.<br />
It cannot service the principal on its debt.<br />
Its agricultural products are subject to boycott in many<br />
countries. It has been forced to halt production of the once<br />
prestigious Krugerrand.<br />
It cannot modernise much of its weaponry or its ageing<br />
warships and fighters.<br />
Its representative sports players are largely confined to<br />
their own country.<br />
All of these factors are telling reminders to white South<br />
Africans that their Government and their country will remain<br />
the pariahs of the international community until they<br />
abandon apartheid completely and forever.<br />
That is the message that must be understood by the<br />
President-presumptive F. W. de Klerk and his colleagues.<br />
The way forward has been outlined with clarity and fairness<br />
by the Eminent Persons Group.<br />
It is a testament to the work of the Group, led by Malcolm<br />
Fraser and General Obasanjo, that they should have made such<br />
an accurate reading of the circumstances in South Africa in<br />
such a short time.<br />
We will not, and we cannot, settle for apartheid with a<br />
so-called human face.<br />
Such a thing is a contradiction in terms.<br />
We insist on real change.<br />
There can be no real change if life in South Africa<br />
continues to be premised on the basis that the colour of<br />
one'q skin determines one's place of residence, one's level<br />
of education, one's rights under the law, one's lifestyle,<br />
the way one participates in the political process, indeed,<br />
one's very place in society.<br />
Some people believe that change can take place in some parts<br />
of South African society while leaving the fundamental<br />
structures of apartheid intact.<br />
The most obvious case is sport. </p>
<p>Some choose to see the end of segregation in sports arenas<br />
and the beginning of efforts to involve young blacks in<br />
sports such as rugby and cricket as evidence that South<br />
Africa has mended its ways and should be readmitted to<br />
international sporting contests.<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth, and now that a<br />
rebel British cricket tour has been agreed on, and that a<br />
rebel rugby tour is being organised with the possible<br />
involvement of Australians, it is even more essential that<br />
we do not mistake the appearance for the reality.<br />
The reality is, of course, that the very structure of South<br />
African society, and the actions and expenditures of the<br />
white minority government, confine non-whites to<br />
second-class participation in all aspects of South African<br />
life, including sports.<br />
Under apartheid's residential segregation, those granted<br />
access to facilities enjoyed by whites have to travel<br />
considerable distances and at great cost and inconvenience.<br />
Under apartheid's education system, young whites have access<br />
to superior sports facilities while the black school system,<br />
starved of funds, cannot offer anything comparable.<br />
The rebel British cricketers, and those in Britain,<br />
Australia and elsewhere who condone such tours may believe<br />
some claim they do believe that these events will actually<br />
help break down the barriers of apartheid. Unfortunately,<br />
the opposite is the case.<br />
The deception involved in organising such tours, the<br />
gloating from South Africa which follows their announcement,<br />
the cosmetic and peripheral multiracial events with which<br />
they are embroidered all underline the fact that they give<br />
comfort and support to the apartheid regime.<br />
Let it be clearly understood that reform, on and off the<br />
sporting field, has a long way to run before desegregated<br />
sport in South Africa becomes a reality.<br />
Until then, there can be no sporting contacts.<br />
Equally, let it be understood that broader international<br />
contacts with South Africa cannot be normalised until<br />
apartheid itself is a thing of the past.<br />
In particular, let it be understood and let this meeting<br />
make perfectly clear that, to achieve this goal of the<br />
total abolition of apartheid, sanctions must be maintained<br />
against South Africa.<br />
I will have the pleasure tomorrow of returning to the issue<br />
of sanctions when I launch the book Apartheid and<br />
International Finance by Keith Oednand Tony Cole. </p>
<p>The work your Committee is undertaking, and will continue at<br />
this Canberra meeting the work of assessing the impact of<br />
sanctions and investigating ways of widening, tightening and<br />
intensifying current economic and other sanctions is<br />
fundamental to achieving our goal of a free and just South<br />
Africa. I emphasise again, as I always have, that I and my<br />
Government see no virtue in sanctions for the sake of<br />
sanctions. They have no virtue other than as an instrument to bring the<br />
South African regime to the bargaining table.<br />
For it is only at the bargaining table that justice can be<br />
done justice that involves not only full democratic rights<br />
for all South Africans irrespective of the colour of their<br />
skin, but economic justice that will see equality of<br />
opportunity for all within a system where the accumulated<br />
capital, entrepreneurship and skills of whites will be fully<br />
welcomed and employed.<br />
So you have a challenging and exhaustive agenda before you.<br />
You will be continuing your dialogue with representatives of<br />
South African opinion and hearing first-hand testimony from<br />
a number of witnesses about current trends and developments.<br />
You will discuss South Africa's destabilisation of its<br />
neighbours and the costs they have incurred as a result.<br />
African members of this Committee need no reminding from me<br />
about the nature of the direct threat apartheid projects<br />
beyond its own borders. For you, it is a daily concern that<br />
goes to the heart of the security and prosperity of your own<br />
societies.<br />
Australia, for one, is committed to continue our efforts to<br />
assist those states and to contribute to their economic and<br />
social development.<br />
We have recently announced a three-year $ 110 million<br />
extension to our existing development assistance program in<br />
Southern Africa, on top of which we will continue where<br />
appropriate an emergency relief assistance involvement.<br />
You will also be discussing the heartening, though still<br />
uncertain, movement forward in relation to Namibia and<br />
deliberations on how the international community can best<br />
assist a smooth and peaceful transition to independence.<br />
Resolution 435 is now being implemented, UNTAG has been<br />
deployed and the refugees are returning home.<br />
Australia is pleased to be assisting this process through<br />
our contingent of 300 engineers in UNTAG.<br />
The Commonwealth has of course already signalled that we<br />
would welcome an independent Namibia into our ranks. </p>
<p>6.<br />
You will in short be preparing the ground for a constructive<br />
and thorough consideration of South Africa by the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kuala Lumpur in<br />
October. I hope that CHOGM itself, at which I look forward to<br />
participating personally, will be able to assist the<br />
progress of dialogue in South Africa leading to genuine<br />
negotiations with authentic representatives of South<br />
Africa's people.<br />
Again nd it gives me much pleasure to<br />
de, Tare open this fourth m eting of Commonwealth Foreign<br />
-Miir--on outnern Af rica.<br />
I wish you success in your deliberations and express the<br />
hope that this will be one more step by the international<br />
community towards bringing about a genuinely free and<br />
multi-racial South Africa. </p>
