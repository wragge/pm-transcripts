FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 21 APRIL 1982<br />
CONDOLENCE MOTION FOR MR HORACE JAMES GARRICK<br />
I move that this House expresses its deep regret at the death<br />
on 6 April 1982 of Mr Horace James Garrick, Member of this<br />
House for the division of Batman from 1.969 to 1977, places<br />
on record its appreciation of his meritorious<br />
public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family<br />
in their bereavement.<br />
All Members o: f this House will be saddened to learn of the<br />
death of one of our former colleagues who died recently.<br />
Horace Garrick was the ALP Member for Batman from 1969 to 1977.<br />
He was born on 26 August 1918 in Melbourne and educated at<br />
the Hawthorn West Central School and Swinburne Technical<br />
College. He was elected to Parliament at the general election on<br />
October 1969 succeeding the then independent Member for Batman,<br />
Sam Benson. He retired from the House on 10 November 1977,<br />
just prior to the general election.<br />
In his maiden speech on 11 March 1970, Mr Garrick<br />
referred to the problems of urban living and the importance<br />
he saw for local government in our three tiered system of<br />
government. He was concerned about the quality of life,<br />
especially in the suburban environment and, of course, was able<br />
to speak of this with first hand knowledge and experience.<br />
He became a member of the Collingwood Council in 1957 and<br />
Mayor of Collingwood from 1960 to 1.961 and again from 1968 to<br />
1.969. He therefore made an important contribution to the<br />
local government scene in Victoria. Additionally, he was a<br />
commissioner with the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works<br />
from 1964 to 1973.<br />
Mr Garrick was re-elected at the general elections of 1972,<br />
1974 and 1975 and throughout this period served the Parliam2nt<br />
as a Member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee<br />
on the Library from 3 March 1976 to 10 November 1977 and as<br />
a Member of th2 Public Works Committee from 18 July 1974 to<br />
11 November 1975. He was a member of the Australian<br />
Parliamentary Mission to the United States and Mexico in<br />
June/ July 1972, a member of the IPU Spring meeting held here<br />
in Canberra in April 1977, and attended the 64th IPU conference<br />
in Sofia in September 1977. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I am sure his sporting activities in his electorate will be<br />
fondly remembered. Hle was a keen footballer and athlete<br />
himself, as well as being a member of sporting organisations<br />
in the area the Collingwood Football Club and the Fitzroy<br />
Bowling Club. He was also a member of the Northcote RSL and<br />
the Preston Social Club.<br />
Members of this House have lost a friend anri colleague, one who was vitallyinterested<br />
in civic affairs and who served the electors of<br />
Batman well.<br />
Tb his family we extend our deepest sympathies. </p>
