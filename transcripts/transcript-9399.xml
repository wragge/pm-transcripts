STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATINJG MY<br />
VISIT TO0 AUSTRALIA BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF<br />
KOREA, KIM YOUNG SAM, 16-19 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
1 am very pleased to announce that the President of the Republic of Korea,<br />
Kim Young Samn, will visit Australia from 16-19 November 1994 as a guest of the<br />
Australian Government. During his time here, he will visit Sydney and Canberra. He<br />
will be accompanied by Madam Kim.<br />
President Kim's visit will follow the APEC leaders' mneeting being hosted by<br />
President Soeharto in Bogor, Indonesia. President Kim and I have worked together<br />
closely in promoting APEC and our discussions will provide a good opportunity to<br />
follow up the outcomes of the meeting. We will also discuss other important regional<br />
economic and security issues in which we share significant common interests.<br />
In the bilateral area, I am particularly interested in examining the scope for developing<br />
further our very healthy economic links and broadening the base of our relationship<br />
through close co-operation in fields such as education and industrial technology.<br />
The ROK is our fifth largest trading partner, with two-way trade totalling $ 6.6 billion<br />
in 1993-94. It is our third largest export market and our exports grew by 18.6 per cent<br />
in 1993-94 alone. Our exports to the ROK are not only growing fast, they are<br />
diversifying. Where manufactures accounted for 10 per cent of exports a decade ago,<br />
they now forin one quarter.<br />
Australia's relations with the P. 0K are am~ ong our most important external linkages.<br />
President Kim's visit is an important further step in the decpcning Of OUr bilateral<br />
relationship. CANBERRA 3 November 1994 </p>
