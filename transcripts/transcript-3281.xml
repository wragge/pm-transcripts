EMBARGO: 5.00 PM<br />
PRIME MINISTER 2 June 1974<br />
Press Statement No. 254<br />
Public Comment by Public Servants,<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the<br />
Governor-General in Council had approved the repeal of<br />
Public Service-Regulation 34( b) which has prohibited<br />
public comment by officers of the Australian Public Service<br />
on administrative matters. Mr Whitlam said the Government<br />
had asked the Public Service Board to issue guidelines to<br />
public servants explaining fully the effects of the repeal<br />
and outlining the new arrangements.<br />
The Prime Minister said the policy of the Government<br />
and the Labor Party was that restrictions on freedom of<br />
expression of public servants and former public servants<br />
should be reduced to the minimum necessary for the<br />
conduct of affairs of state.<br />
" The Government believes that public servants should<br />
have the maximum possible freedom to exercise the social<br />
and political rights enjoyed by other citizens" Mr Whitlam<br />
said. " This is a long-standing Government commitment in<br />
line with our promise to introduce a Freedom of Information<br />
Act for all Australians".<br />
The repeal of Regulation 34( b) was in accordance<br />
with the views of the Public Service Board which had<br />
reviewed the Regulation after representations from the<br />
Council of Commonwealth Public Servants' Organisation.<br />
Mr Whitlam added that the Council of Commonwealth<br />
Public Servants Organisations had been informed of the<br />
Government's decision. Mr Whitlam said that interested<br />
parties would be welcome to give their views on the<br />
question of public comment by public servants to the Commission<br />
of Enquiry into the Public Service which the Government<br />
has announced. He said he had long felt that the blanket prohibition<br />
contained in Regulation 34( b) was wrong and futile, though<br />
he recognised that some restrictions were necessary.<br />
" I expect that the restrictions will be substantially reduced<br />
now that the Reguldtion has been repealed" Mr Whitlams. aid.<br />
