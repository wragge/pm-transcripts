ADDRESS TO THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN.<br />
STATE COUNCIL OF THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
It is good to be in the West again, after the enormous win our<br />
Party had in the last election. In 1977 Western Australia once<br />
again showed clearly the direction in which it wanted our country<br />
to move, and they gave the Liberals an. unprecedented victory.<br />
As you know, the Liberals won nine of the ten House of Representative<br />
seats and for the first time since Federation we have six Western<br />
Australian Liberal Senators. This was a wonderful result, which<br />
we could not have achieved without your support and the full support<br />
of Sir Charles Court who campaigned magnificently and relentlessly<br />
for the return of the Government.<br />
In 1977 we proved again that the people of Australia wanted a<br />
Government with a Liberal philosophy.-a Government with a sense<br />
of national purpose, a commitment to national unity a commitment<br />
to-free enterprise and achievement and a commitment to promoting the<br />
growth and development of this Nation; a Government committed to<br />
seeing that all Australians have a fair go and to providing help to<br />
those-in need while encouraging the initiative that is essential to<br />
a vibrant nation.<br />
Above all, Australians voted for a Government that is not indebted<br />
to any single class or vested interest. A Government dedicated to<br />
the National interest and that governs for all AustralIians. That<br />
is what the Australian people want a Government that can work<br />
together with the community to achieve our great national objectives.<br />
By contrast, the Labor Party is in disarray once again divided<br />
by conflicting interests, riven by factions, committed to negativism.<br />
The ALP is so negative, that they even negate one another. Labor<br />
may be a socialist party but there is nothing collective about<br />
their economic statements. Mr Hayden thinks interest rates have<br />
fallen too far; Mr Hurford says that they haven't fallen far enough.<br />
Mr. Hayden wants to reduce significantly protection for Australian<br />
Industry, but Mr Hurford wants to keep it up. These sorts of<br />
statements are par for the Labor Party course they've always had<br />
a. big handicap. </p>
<p>-2<br />
They had the same problem during the last election. Then, in the<br />
vain attempt to paper over their many differences, they resorted<br />
to 5-way long-distance telephone hook-ups. Well, this year, we're<br />
going to help the ALP we've reduced long distance telephone<br />
charges. While on the subject of Labor Party spokesmen I should say that<br />
there are certain standards which, in the past, all Australian<br />
political leaders have observed. These standards Australians<br />
overwhelmingly endorse, regardless of their Party affiliation.<br />
When Australian political leaders are abroad they do not attack<br />
our country's policies, nor do they undermine the fundamental<br />
values that unite us all as Australians.<br />
Itwas therefore unfortunate that, on his recent trip around Asia,<br />
MrHayden chose to inform the local press that, " Australians too<br />
often leave other countries with the impression that they are<br />
abrasive and insensitive people". These remarks were in bad taste,<br />
they were unnecessary and they should never have been made.<br />
Mr-Hayden. went on to call for the withdrawal of the RAAF squadrons<br />
inL. Malaysia because according to him, these could be interpreted as<br />
an " imperialist intrusion". Mr Hayden disregarded the facts, for<br />
the squadrons are only there because the Government of Malaysia<br />
welcomes their presence.<br />
Mr Hayden also attacked Australia's favourable trade balance with<br />
ASEAN. He said that Australia had to " crunch this thing as quickly<br />
as possible" and " turn around" the trading balance against ourselves.<br />
These remarks were off-hand, ill-considered and damaging to<br />
Australia. And they ignore the fact that Asean exports into<br />
Australian markets have been growing at a rate of 35% per annum.<br />
over the period 1971/ 72 to 1976/ 77.<br />
People who assume the responsibility of political leadership should<br />
not promote foreign criticism of Australia for party political<br />
reasons. Mr Hayden's inexperience is no excuse for this most<br />
regrettable display. Labor's negative approach stands in stark<br />
contrast to this Government's positive and united approach to all<br />
national issues.<br />
our coherent and rational economic policies have enabled Australia<br />
to emerge from an economic morass, a morass for which Mr Hayden,<br />
as the ALP's favourite Treasurer, must take a major responsibility.<br />
Under our sound economic management inflation has fallen dramatically,<br />
interest rates have been reduced significantly and investment has<br />
grown. We have achieved this by a rigorous control of Government<br />
expenditure, by a responsible management of the money supply, by<br />
arguing strongly before the Arbitration Commission for wage restraint<br />
and by making Australia an attractive place in which to invest.<br />
In.. preparing the Budget, we will continue this course, for only in<br />
this way will we overcome inflation and move back to sustained<br />
economic growth. </p>
<p>-3<br />
We will make sure that the maximum benefit is obtained for each<br />
dollar of public money your money. Every Government programme,<br />
without exception, is being scrutinised. Some hard decisions have<br />
to be made, and we shall not shirk our responsibility. We all<br />
know from our own experience that families cannot always afford<br />
all the things they would like to have and as a Nation, we cannot<br />
afford to pay for all the things Governments are asked for.<br />
A responsible Government must have the capacity to say no to<br />
demands that outrun the resources it can reasonably expect from<br />
taxpayers. We will not betray our obligations. Your Government.<br />
will never seek political popularity at'the price of economic<br />
responsibility. We have worked together; we have gained so much<br />
and if anyone thinks we are going to turn off course now, they<br />
mistake the quality of this Government. For we are determined<br />
to keep on the path to lower inflation because' this is the best<br />
guarantee that interest rates will continue coming down and that<br />
in turn will provide the best incentive for business, small and<br />
large, to invest and expand.<br />
Because we have followed these policies and because you have an<br />
enlightened and energetic Liberal Government in Western Australia<br />
there are exciting mining developments taking place here.<br />
Bauxite production in the Darling Ranges now exceeds that at Weipa\<br />
and construction of a third Alumina plant is to commence this<br />
year. With strong Commonwealth and State support, the North-West<br />
Shelf $ 50 million planning and definition study is in progress<br />
and production at the Agnew Nickel Mine will commence soon.<br />
Also, expansion of facilities is underway in the Pilbara despite<br />
the temporary downturn in Japanese demand for iron ore. offshore<br />
petroleum explorations has been stepped up and planning for the<br />
uranium project at Yeelirrie is at an advanced stage. Also, there<br />
is the recent promising diamond prospect in the Kimberleys.<br />
For those who wish to foresee Australia's long-term future, I<br />
suggest to them " Look West" it is a marvellous tonic.<br />
The prospects for this State are unlimited, a great part of<br />
Australia's future lies here. The Commonwealth recognises the<br />
particular growth potential of this State, and has backed<br />
Western Australia in its approach for funds for the development<br />
of the Kwinana Power station, the Muja Power station, the upgrading<br />
of the Kwinana-Koolyanobbing railway and we are increasing<br />
Western Australia's semi-Government borrowing programme in<br />
recognition of this State's above-average population growth.<br />
The development of Western Australia shows that the vital tasks<br />
of getting-the economy back on its feet is a task in which we<br />
must and will succeed. It requires whole-hearted cooperation<br />
between State and Commonwealth Governments. Australians are<br />
entitled to expect such a united effort.<br />
The Agreement reached at the Premiers' Conference on guidelines<br />
for infrastructure financing for new development projects was a<br />
striking example of this cooperation and Sir Charles played a<br />
crucial role in developing this new Commnonwealth-State initiative. </p>
<p>4-<br />
One would not expect there to be total unanimity on all things<br />
between seven Governments. But what is vital is that we all<br />
work together in Australia's interest. Cooperation between<br />
Federal and State Governments covers many fields.<br />
Relations on offshore matters have bedevilled Commonwealth-State<br />
relations for more than a decade.<br />
We are now very near to a happy solution.<br />
It was, of course, open to the Commonwealth, on the basis<br />
of the High Court's decision, to assume all power over the<br />
offshore area, and virtually ignore the States.<br />
That is the course Labor wanted to take. But we took a<br />
very different approach. We believe in cooperation for<br />
Australia's advantage. Liberals believe in shared power, in<br />
shared responsibility. The States will exercise increased<br />
powers over the first three miles offshore. The Commonwealth<br />
is also willing to share with the States responsibility for<br />
activities such as mining and f ishing beyond the three-mile<br />
limit., our cooperation goes further.<br />
We have taken the unprecedented step of consulting the<br />
States during the negotiation of international treaties<br />
and we are prepared to insert into treaties clauses<br />
protecting State's interests.<br />
We have reached agreement on a National Companies and<br />
Securities Scheme. There is close cooperation with this<br />
state on legal aid and family law, and we are moving<br />
to a fully cooperative Commr~ onwealth-State approach on<br />
environmental protection. This cooperation embodies<br />
the spirit of the new Federalism we promised when we camne to<br />
power. As Liberals we know that ever-increasing centralised<br />
power at Canberra may make life easier for the Commonwealth<br />
bureaucracy but too often at the cost of the individual<br />
many thousands of miles away in Perth or Kalgoorlie.<br />
The prosperity of Western Australia, or the whole of Australia,<br />
depends upon trade, upon markets overseas. Sir Charles Court<br />
has tirelessly sought markets overseas to advance the great<br />
mining industries of this State. The Commonwealth Government<br />
is seeking to promote a new export consciousness throughout<br />
all Australian industry.<br />
We are providing new and significant export . incentives and<br />
tax concessions and have undertaken a major campaign to<br />
expand world markets and Australia's access to. them.<br />
We have pursued this course in the knowledge that Australia,<br />
more than many nations, depends on international trade.<br />
A substantially higher rate of growth in world markets<br />
would greatly speed up the rate of our own recovery, and<br />
the rate at which new jobs can be created in Australia. </p>
<p>In my recent discussions in Japan, the United States<br />
and Europe, I have been adding Australia's weight to<br />
those who want to get the world economy moving again<br />
a movement which can only come about if we expand world<br />
trade and halt the spread of unreasonable protectionism.<br />
We have been working for a positive and wide-ranging<br />
agreement at the Geneva Multilateral Trade Negotiations the MTN.<br />
Doug Anthony and Vic Garland have spent the last fortnight<br />
there directly arguing Australia's case. We have insisted<br />
that the MTN must be balanced and include agriculture<br />
as well as industrial products.<br />
President Carter shares these views, and in a recent letter<br />
to me he said about the MTN:<br />
" I will not consider these negotiations a success unless they<br />
lead us toward a significant liberalisation of world trade in<br />
agricultural products." These negotiations have just passeda<br />
critical phase they will be resumed in the European autumn.<br />
Meanwhile, the Bonn Summit beginning tomorrow will review<br />
the situation and major participants -especially the EEC<br />
will have to re-appraise their negotiating mandates.<br />
Australia supported strongly by. the USA has clearly<br />
established a position whereby the MTN must provide additional<br />
access for agriculture, and a code of behaviour on export<br />
subsidies on agricultural products. In particular both<br />
in the MTN itself and on a bilateral level we have been<br />
pressing the European Community to reduce its trade barriers.<br />
We have stated our position<br />
without equivocation and I believe we have had some success<br />
on this front. The justice of Australia's case is being<br />
increasingly recognised by a growing body of world opinion.<br />
In July, The Economist reported that the case for a change<br />
to the EEC's approach has " been most powerfully put by the<br />
United States; most justly by countries such as Australia<br />
and New Zealand".<br />
Just last week, the British Foreign Secretary, Dr. Owen,<br />
told a meeting in Brussels that the EEC was " highly protectionist<br />
particularly of course in agriculture". He said of the EEC:<br />
" We are causing very considerable distortions in the world<br />
agricultural industries because of protectionist policies".<br />
" Some people are now beginning to feel the full force of<br />
it because Australia, New Zealand and the United States are<br />
campaigning " 1 A1 </p>
<p>The British Prime minister, Mr Callaghan, said in June that:<br />
" The Community's Common Agricultural Policy, for example,<br />
needs major reform it is like the cuckoo depriving<br />
the consumer of access to cheaper goods, gobbling up an<br />
unfair proportion of the Community's budget and starving<br />
a number of more worthwhile fledglings in the Community's nest".<br />
The EEC will find it even more costly to ignore the<br />
fairness and economic good sense of Australia's case.<br />
No less than 75 percent of the total EEC budget goes on<br />
agriculture yet agriculture produces only 5percent of their<br />
GDP. The cost of the EEC agricultural support and<br />
subsidy budget is now in excess of $ 8 billion about<br />
for each EEC taxpayer who as a consumer is also burdened<br />
with having to pay double to treble world prices for his<br />
foodstuffs.<br />
The problem for Australia is not only one of lack<br />
of access. There-is also the staggering magniture of new and<br />
growing EEC agricultural export subsidies.<br />
In 1978, EEC export subsidies on items which compete with<br />
Australian agricultural products in overseas will total about<br />
$ 4 billion.<br />
In beef, 150,000 tonnes are to be dumped with export subsidies<br />
of $ 1,000 per tonne; butter 500,000 tonnes subsidies<br />
of $ 2,000 per tonne; wheat and flour $ 1 billion in subsidies;<br />
sugar 3 million tonnes with $ 800 million in subsidies.<br />
These subsidies range from double to treble the world price<br />
of these commodities. These massive subsidised exports have<br />
made major inroads into Australia's markets in Asia, the<br />
Middle East and South America. Where once we supplied<br />
the whole of the market such as flour to Sri Lanka<br />
we have been wiped out. Is it any wonder some of our<br />
primary industries are in difficulty when a bottomless purse<br />
provided by 260 million people is used to subsidise<br />
producers, driving us out of markets by destroying commercial<br />
trading. </p>
<p>I cannot understand people who say we should accept the<br />
EEC's policies on these matters. I cannot understand<br />
the Australian Labor Party counsels of despair except that<br />
it is a party to which despair is second nature.<br />
They attack the Government for trying to get a fair go for<br />
Australia. They would have us meekly accept not only<br />
exclusion from the world's largest, richest market, but<br />
also massive dumping of surpluses on our other marketsmarkets<br />
important for the well-being of many of our industries.<br />
That is not the path your Government will take. We have no<br />
intention of abandoning Australia's national interest in this<br />
or any other area.<br />
At the same time we have not allowed our commitment to getting<br />
a fair go for Australia in the EEC to blunt the momentum of<br />
our movement into other markets. We have consistently<br />
encouraged Australian exporters and given particular attention<br />
to the growing markets in the Middle East and<br />
South East Asia and our trade with new markets has been<br />
expanding rapidly in recent years.<br />
In 1976-77 our exports to ASEAN countries were $ 772 million<br />
a 100 percent increase over 1972-73. In 1976-77 our exports<br />
to South Korea were $ 191 million an increase of 260 percent<br />
over 1972-73. Our exports to Iran in 1976-77 were $ 150 millionan<br />
increase of 480 percent over 1972-73.<br />
We are committed to sustaining our thrust into available markets<br />
and our initiatives include new export incentive arrangements,<br />
strengthening the Trade Commissioner service, the<br />
Australia/ ASEAN Industrial Cooperation Conference, the<br />
Commonwealth Regional Consultative Group on Trade,<br />
the ASEAN/ Australia Consultative Committee, and we are<br />
establishing the Overseas Projects Corporation.<br />
We will continue to expand our trade into those markets<br />
available to us and keep fighting to get into markets<br />
that are closed to us.<br />
I have found an increasing willingness by most nations to adopt<br />
a more flexible and practical approach to the demands of<br />
expanding world trade. There is universal. concern to see that<br />
present sluggish world growth rates are improved.<br />
The ongoing Multilateral Trade Negotiations and the impetus<br />
to them from the Bonn Summit Conference will be6 of enormous<br />
importance to the trading world for the rest of this century.<br />
The nations gathered together have the power to take the world<br />
forward to establish a new, improved trading system, which<br />
will expand markets and employment around the world.<br />
If nations lack the wit, the will, the determination to move<br />
forward they run the risk of moving backward to the tragic<br />
beggar-thy-neighbour policies of the 1930' s </p>
<p>8.<br />
Indeed, present European attempts to allow selection and<br />
discriminatory measures against imports underscore the<br />
real gravity of that danger. Whatever the outcome at<br />
Geneva, because of the domestic economic position of many<br />
of the world's major economies, the international trading<br />
scene is likely to remain difficult, not just for months<br />
but for years.<br />
At this moment, the most important thing that we can do<br />
for Australia is to put our economy to rights, to correct<br />
the grave imbalances of the Labor years. we have made<br />
considerable progress, but much remains to be done.<br />
Together we can make further progress, by using to the<br />
full our natural resources, and our own capacities our<br />
skill, dedication and inventiveness. We need to strengthen<br />
our great industries, our productive and competitive<br />
sinews.<br />
We need to offer stability and predictability in decision<br />
making, and above all we need to utilise the capacity and<br />
potential as yet untapped in our nation. If we do so<br />
we will be better able to withstand whatever stresses<br />
developments in international trade impose on our nation.<br />
We will be better able to take advantage of whatever<br />
opportunities are available.<br />
Make no mistake, we have an opportunity to make Australia<br />
an example to the world an example of how dedication<br />
and a determination to overcome economic problems can<br />
enhance the life of our people to join that narrow band<br />
of countries where decisions are taken because they are right,<br />
not because they are thought to be politically popular.<br />
Such government is only possible where there is a respect<br />
by the Government for the people, and where the Government<br />
has earned the respect of the people.<br />
our pulrpose is to create an Australia in which every<br />
Australian shares in a great national pride. working<br />
together in support of our common objectives.<br />
The opportunities are great the possibilities-exciting.<br />
