<p>New data released today reveals the benefit to schools across the country  -  by sector and state  -  under the Gillard Government's National Plan for School Improvement.</p>
<p>Under the current broken school funding model introduced by the Howard Government, federal school funding will go backwards by a staggering $16.2 billion over the next six years. This is because of falling indexation and the Opposition's refusal to guarantee the extra investment provided for schools in this year's Budget will be delivered.</p>
<p>If the National Plan for School Improvement does not proceed, every school, in every state and territory and in every sector, will be worse off.</p>
<p>If the plan is not implemented, over the next six years:</p>
<p> * 	In NSW, government schools would lose a total of around $3.6 billion ($1.7 million on average per school) and non-government schools would lose a total of around $765 million ($800,000 on average per school);<br />
 * 	In Victoria, government schools would lose a total of around $3 billion ($1.9 million on average per school) and non-government schools would lose a total of around $1.2 billion ($1.7 million on average per school);<br />
 * 	In Queensland, government schools would lose a total of around $3 billion ($2.4 million on average per school), and non-government schools would lose a total of around $1.2 billion ($2.5 million on average per school).<br />
 * 	In WA, government schools would lose a total of around $450 million ($600,000 on average per school) and non-Government schools would lose a total of around $680 million ($2.3 million on average per school)<br />
 * 	In SA, government schools would lose a total of around $750 million ($1.4 million on average per school) and non-Government schools would lose a total of around $190 million ($1 million on average per school)<br />
 * 	In Tasmania, government schools would lose a total of around $500 million ($2.6 million on average per school) and non-Government schools would lose a total of around $160 million ($2.4 million on average per school)<br />
 * 	In the ACT, government schools would lose a total of around $40 million ($500,000 on average per school) and non-Government schools would lose a total of around $60 million ($1.4 million on average per school)<br />
 * 	In the NT, government schools would lose a total of around $640 million ($4.2 million on average per schools) and non-Government schools would lose a total of around $90 million ($2.3 million on average per school)</p>
<p>If the National Plan for School Improvement is implemented, Australian schools will benefit from an extra $14.5 billion in funding over the next six years, as well as higher teaching standards, a stronger focus on early years literacy, and more information for parents and the community.</p>
<p>If states and territories sign up to our plan and this extra investment is delivered, it would mean, on average:</p>
<p> * 	Around $2.2 million extra for every school in QLD;<br />
 * 	Around $1.8 million extra for every school in Victoria;<br />
 * 	Around $1.6 million extra for every school in NSW, Tasmania, and the NT;<br />
 * 	Around $800,000 extra for every school in SA and the ACT;<br />
 * 	Around $300,000 extra for every school in WA.</p>
<p>This extra funding on offer under our plan will help pay for literacy and numeracy coaches, ICT equipment, staff training, homework clubs and intensive support for students who need it. It will help make sure that every student, in every school, is getting a great education.</p>
<p>When it comes to the future of the nation's schools, the choice is clear.</p>
<p>Under the National Plan for school Improvement, Australian schools will be properly funded under a new and fairer funding system, based on the needs of every student in every classroom. There will be higher standards and better results.</p>
<p>Under Tony Abbott, every single Australian school will be on a funding hit list.</p>
