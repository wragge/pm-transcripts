FOR U:. S 15 MARCH 3977<br />
DEATH OF MR J. I. ARMSTRONG<br />
Last Thursday, 10th March, John Armstrong a man who had<br />
held public office in Parliament, overseas and in his home<br />
State of New South Wales over a span of forty years died<br />
suddcnly at Batcmans Bay, on the New South Wales coast<br />
which. he loved so much.<br />
John Armstrong was a straight-forward man blunt, open, forceful<br />
, ithc. ut any trace of sophistry or cynicism. lie was a most likeable<br />
man, with an earthy sense of humour, and he was much respected<br />
by all1 who knew him or worked with him.<br />
He wns also a man of moderation. Many pol: i. ticans forget that<br />
if they speak with hyperbole and rancour, they may oxacerbace<br />
public feel. ings, deepen public divisions and bring disrespect<br />
to Pn. rliament. John Armstrong was well aware of that dangeT and<br />
managed to put forward his point of view with strength and<br />
vigour but tempered with moderation and humour. It is no<br />
wonder that he proved to be a success in the many public offices<br />
he h ld.<br />
And there were many offices which he held over his long career of<br />
public service, In 1934 he became an Alderman oE the City of<br />
Sydney, and three years later he was elected to the Sena te.<br />
He represented New South Wales in the Senate for 24 years, during<br />
which time he was a Minister of the Crown for three years and<br />
latev deputy leader of the opposition for five years.<br />
After lcaving the Senate, he again became active in local government,<br />
and in 1965, he achieved a life-long ambition by being elected<br />
Lord Mayor of Sydney. le brought great flair and imagination<br />
to that offics.<br />
In 1973 he was appointed High Commissioner to London. His sty u<br />
was not thaL V. his predecessors in that of fi. ce, yet he served<br />
AustaTl. ia forthrightly but discreetly. Our continuing good relations<br />
w ith Britain much to his tenure of that office. / 2 </p>
<p>One of the initiatives which John Armstrong long advocated<br />
was the introduction of an Australian honours system. It was<br />
most fitt ing that he was made ai Companion of the Order of Australia<br />
iast Au~ st ral ia Day. Sadly he died before being invres ted with the<br />
inlsign ia of thn Order.<br />
A State funeral was hold for him yesterday : in Sydney. At tihe<br />
Requiem Mass at St. Miary' s Cathedral , which was attended by the<br />
Attorney-General on my behalf, Cardinal Freeman paid tribute<br />
to the " attractivc consistency of his character".<br />
John Armstrong held many positions of power and influence but<br />
throughout he remained himsel f, plainly speaking his views wi thout<br />
p re tens ion.<br />
John Armstrong served his Party and his country el]. I talked<br />
with him only last week and he seemed to be greatly enjoying<br />
his well-earned retirement. It is sad that he could not have<br />
had longer to enjoy it.<br />
The Government extends its profound sympathy to his wife, Joan,<br />
and hi~ s four children.<br />
