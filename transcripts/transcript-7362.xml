PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA28 JULY 1988<br />
His Excellency President Hammer Deroburt of the Republic of<br />
Nauru will visit Australia 8-16 August at the invitation of<br />
the Australian Government.<br />
Australia and Nauru have a longstanding and beneficial<br />
association and I am pleased that President Deroburt will be<br />
joining us as we celebrate our Bicentenary, the more so as<br />
1988 also marks twenty years of independence for the<br />
Republic. He will have the opportunity to visit World<br />
Expo 88 in Brisbane, attend the 5th Festival of Pacific Arts<br />
in Townsville in which Nauru is also participating, and<br />
visit Melbourne and Perth.<br />
In Canberra he will meet His Excellency the Governor-General<br />
and have discussions with me on bilateral and regional<br />
issues of mutual concern.<br />
