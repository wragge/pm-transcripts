    <content><![CDATA[<p>Beijing, People's Republic of China</p>
<p>PM: The world has woken to the news that Margaret Thatcher has died.</p>
<p>I did want to offer my condolences to Margaret Thatcher's family.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher was a woman who changed history for women.</p>
<p>Obviously, Margaret Thatcher and I did not share a political outlook on the world.</p>
<p>But as a woman, I am admiring of her achievements becoming the first woman to lead the United Kingdom, the first female Prime Minister there.</p>
<p>Many around the world will be reflecting upon her life and times today, as is appropriate with the loss of such a significant figure.</p>
<p>For women around the world, they will be reflecting on the loss of a woman who showed a new way forward for women and a way into leadership.</p>
