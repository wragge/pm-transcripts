    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am paying tribute to the work of Major Brian Watters as Chairman of the Australian National Council on Drugs (ANCD) and announcing the release of $2 million in proceeds of crime funding for drug treatment programmes.</p>
<p>Since 1997, over $1 billion has been provided to tackle drug abuse under the Tough on Drugs Strategy, making it the most comprehensive and extensively funded illicit drugs programme ever conducted in Australia.  It is also the most successful.  Through a number of indicators, including the 2004 National Drug Household Survey showing illicit drug use falling, we know that the Strategy is working to make a real and positive impact on people's lives.</p>
<p>Much of the success of the Tough on Drugs Strategy can be attributed to the outstanding work of the ANCD.  Over the past seven years, Major Brian Watters has made an outstanding contribution as Chairman to the fight against drugs and in enhancing partnerships between government and the community.  Major Watters has taken up a new position with the International Narcotics Control Board.  I sincerely thank him for his services as Chairman and wish him every success for the future.  The new Chairman will be announced in the near future.</p>
<p> The fight against drug abuse requires a constant search for new and innovative approaches, and cooperation across sectors.  In this spirit, I have been talking to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator the Hon Chris Ellison, about the possible use of proceeds of crime funds for drug treatment programmes.</p>
<p>Today I am pleased to announce that $2 million in proceeds of crime funds will be provided to support three drug treatment and prevention programmes over the next three years.</p>
<p>   Wesley Rehabilitation Services will receive $660,000 over three years to provide an innovative abstinence-based long term residential care and rehabilitation service for homeless men and women in south-west Sydney.</p>
<p>   Ozcare will receive $652,100 over three years to support a non-residential integrated drug rehabilitation service in the Brisbane north region.</p>
<p>   Odyssey House Victoria will receive $666,000 over three years to provide a short term residential drug rehabilitation and case management programme for people experiencing significant alcohol and drug problems in the Frankston area, in south-east Melbourne.</p>
<p>In tandem with this, the Community Partnerships Initiative will provide funding of $900,000 to help communities with problems associated with drug use:</p>
<p>  Drug Free Australia will receive $600,000 over three years to continue their work in uniting individuals, organisations and government representative bodies to advocate abstinence based approaches to drug issues.</p>
<p>  The Australasian Therapeutic Communities Association (ATCA) will receive $300,000 over three years to further support its work in promoting drug rehabilitation through residential programmes.</p>
