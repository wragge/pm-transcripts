    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Governor-General has today announced the names of many Australians and a number of foreign citizens being honoured within the Australian system of honours and awards as a result of the Bali atrocity and its aftermath.</p>
<p>The Bali honours list includes those caught in the bomb blasts and fires but who nevertheless stayed to assist friends, family members and strangers as well as those who rushed to the scene to help in rescue efforts despite fires and the risk of further explosions.  Their bravery in the face of danger is an inspiration for all Australians and their actions contributed to the safe escape of many people from the bombsites.</p>
<p>The Government is also pleased to see that the outstanding service of volunteers, military personnel and officials is being acknowledged with awards in the Order of Australia, the Public Service Medal and Conspicuous Service Awards.  Their efforts contributed to the initial medical response, hospital treatment in Australia, services to victims and their families and friends and highly effective law enforcement outcomes.</p>
<p>Beyond those recognised by today's awards there are many others who contributed, in one way or another, to the national response to the bombing. On behalf of the Australian Government I commend them for their efforts.</p>
<p>I have also written to state premiers, chief ministers and the heads of Australian Government and non-government agencies requesting they ensure that special efforts are made to acknowledge the service and contribution of their personnel and volunteers who may not have been recognised today.</p>
<p> This terrible event directly affected the lives of many Australians and impacted on those who were caught up in the response.  The Bali honours list pays tribute to many who contributed in important ways to the response and, on behalf of the Australian Government, they are to be commended and congratulated for their bravery and their service in the face of danger and personal challenges in extraordinary circumstances.  </p>
