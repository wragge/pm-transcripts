Prime Minister Julia Gillard today said the Government's $2.2 billion mental health package will provide invaluable assistance to young Australians who suffer from a mental illness.</p>
<p>The 2011-12 Budget delivers a key election commitment made by the Prime Minister to make mental health a key second term priority for the Government.</p>
<p>This package includes $419.7 million over five years to significantly increase youth mental health services including the expansion of two programs pioneered by leading mental health expert Professor Patrick McGorry - headspace and Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centres.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Minister for Health and Ageing Nicola Roxon and Minister for Mental Health and Ageing Mark Butler met with former Australian of the Year Professor Pat McGorry and CEO of Headspace Chris Tanti at the headspace centre in Sunshine, Victoria to see how important these facilities are to young people aged 12 to 25.</p>
<p>A total of $197.3 million will be provided to triple the number of headspace centres across Australia from 30 to 90 to provide young people aged 12 to 25 a place to go to get the care and support they need.</p>
<p>When fully operating, these centres will be able to help 72,000 young people across Australia each year, providing a youth friendly environment where young people can feel safe, respected and supported.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government's mental health package also includes $222.4 million in Commonwealth funding for 12 new Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centres (EPPIC) to be delivered in partnership with the states and territories.</p>
<p>These new centres will be modelled on the existing EPPIC centre, an integrated psychiatric service for young people in Melbourne's west, to provide professional help for young people who require more specialised and intensive treatment.</p>
<p>Together with the four EPPIC centres funded in the 2010 Budget, this means that there will be a network of 16 EPPIC centres, subject to matching funding from the states and territories.</p>
