Doop'*. z the zeotP7oint on Government spending tyhich the<br />
naticnmzl oconomic challenge has in-posed, howeverc, I thin% we<br />
have ocd reason to be piroud of our record in defending and<br />
enha.: c~. ng tho riLghto of Australia's veterano.<br />
Motcl our young people have never e~ zperionced the horrore<br />
of war:. Dut no Auctralian ohould be allowod to forgot the<br />
CCCrifi-c QG code by ox-servicamen and women to encure frecdom3<br />
for futuro cjenoratAonz for without those acicrificaG,<br />
Aucotrolia might not be free today. 00 07O 51' </p>

We have Inc~ eacod appropriationo to the Veterznol Affairs<br />
portfolio fioa $ 2.5 billion in 1982-03 to $ 3.0 billion In<br />
1986-07 mu incicoase in real torrce of 37 pot cent ovor our<br />
time in okgilce. The veterans' allocation now ropresuntc<br />
por cent of tho total Commonwealth Budgut.<br />
In reviowing that record, lot meo takc thiG opo!: tunity to<br />
pay tributo to the fortaor Ilinicter for Vaterano, Afairs,<br />
Senator Arthu.~ r Gietzelt. During the four yeara ho served ac<br />
Iiinistor, Arthur made 1uhat can only be called an outatanding<br />
contribution~ to the veterana of Auatralin.<br />
His achievoaxnt ic not to be moasured solely by ueacuring<br />
the size oC hi dopartment's budget. Arthur concentrated on<br />
the quality~ cG well as the quantity of services provided by<br />
the Goverr. 2,, ot to veterans.<br />
When Arthuar took cn the job, an early priority was to<br />
iisprovo tno otandard of care in repatriation hoGPi talC<br />
throughout nuotralia. Thio waa essential if WO Ore to copO<br />
with tho ohcirp increase in tho numbor of veterano who, as<br />
thoy ago, will need treatmont at thoso hospitals.<br />
Revitalioii g the sin~ major Ropatriation tHospitale led to the<br />
provision of c~ ore than $ 05 million since 1903-34 for now<br />
buildingo.<br />
Another $ 20 oilion was provided for specialiced equipment<br />
at the hoczditalG.<br />
This meano Zirst clase health core continueo to be available<br />
to every voteran who needs it.<br />
We are also trying to improve the ease with which veterans<br />
can gain access to our repatriation services. Several new<br />
information sorvices, such as toll-free telephone lines,<br />
simplifiod information brochures and forms, and a customer<br />
liaison nervice, have been introduced to improve the quality<br />
of contact between veterans and their Department.<br />
A second m~ ajor achievement of the Government undar<br />
Arthur Gictzeltvs administration of this portfolio was the<br />
most comprehensive reform of repatriation legislation in<br />
nearly soven decades. This culminated in the proclamation<br />
of the Veterans' Entitlements Act on 22 may 1936. This Act<br />
simplified what had become an obstacle course that made lifa<br />
unnecessaxily difficult for everyone concerned.<br />
A few other features of the record deserve highlighting.<br />
Aged and r2' tended Care Units have been sot up at all<br />
repatriation general hocpitals to assess patients' needs and<br />
refer then to appropriate treatment and community cervices.<br />
The aim is to ensure that patients can stay in their own<br />
homes as long as possible rather than being forced to call<br />
on institutional care before it is really necessary., 0007532 </p>
<p>A nurslaU home leave ccheme and respite care fogr patient<br />
carers haive also been introduced. New arrangements for<br />
dental, Gitomotrical and physoiotherapy treatment have<br />
further , Iproved aervice delivory in those areas.<br />
We are OLIGUzing that funding for the Australian War Memorial<br />
reflect3 The need to maintain an accurate record of<br />
Austras11un-3 at war. Funding has alrmost trebled cince<br />
1983-84, to $ 9 million.<br />
To sum ~, therefore, I would reiterate that<br />
Arthur C:, tzelt'n strong record of achievement in this area<br />
over th't last four years reflects the Government's very real<br />
cor t~~ tto veterans.<br />
That cca.-tmant is of course Ghared by the now Minister for<br />
VeterarnsO Affairs, Ben Humphreys.<br />
Many of. : 7oau will know by now that Ben Humphreys is a<br />
QueenalandeLr, the son of a TPI pensioner now doceaaed, and a<br />
m~ ember e~ the Colmnslie RSL branch in Brisbane. E2e is also<br />
Vice ' t~ nof the Queenslrnd Branch of the Totally and<br />
Permane Ay Disabled Soldiers' Association of Australia.<br />
Ben servc, d with the flect air arm in 1953-54 as a national<br />
serv4. ciza-, Go lie bringo a knowledge of the services and<br />
service conditions to his new job.<br />
He [~ Las been~ a very 3iffective Member of rarlia-, imnt oince<br />
1977, 11, a-luding as Government Whip since 1013 Although<br />
thin is Mes firrt portfolio, I know Ben is very well<br />
equippcsc?. " Po take up this now job and to contfnuo the very<br />

2n te Liaor Party's policy statement at the recent<br />
oloctie~ t, we clearly stated that under a Lrbor Governnent<br />
vctcEar~ ould be ciuarantood the secure andl digjnified life<br />
they dcezvo.<br />
I or-~ awo-. o that thcro has been a gcat deal of<br />
aprhot. 3on and2 feelingo og Insecurity in the veterans'<br />
comr-unty cince the handinvg down of a Federal Court<br />
ju; Scose111 7hich Loplied thzt the T'P1 pension chould not be<br />

Cabinet colsdered c oubf3ission from Ben Hu=. ohreys on thin<br />
issue citweelt and we detorained that this interpretation<br />
of tho ! eZ nuct not be allowod to stand.<br />
Ou-vic-u ic that the TPI penrcion and the intermodiate rate<br />
uZ disLYIty pension arc -1, uot and deserved compensation for<br />
those CL, 2b~ lod an a result of their war servico. The<br />
Govornnz:. tt agroos with the veterans' community that the TPI<br />
and intc.-o2diate rates of disability pensiono should be paid<br />
for Rimco. 000753 </p>
<p>Thereforo, my~ Government wil~ l introduce into Prliam~ ent an<br />
amendment to the Veterans' rOntitlementC Act and the Goaraen's<br />
War Penclon and Allowanccr3 Act to ensure that Sp~ ecial that<br />
is, TI and Intermediato irate poncniono, once granted,<br />
continue to be payable indeginitely, except whore thore is<br />
evidence o froud, significant inprovement in health or<br />
rec. unptiotn of employment.<br />
I believe thin decision will be applauded by veterans and<br />
indeed bV the Australian comininity, as a fair one and one<br />
which w~ lenshrine in law the approach that all govarnmentn<br />
have ta: Xcn to these poneioni oinco they were introducod.<br />
The doc~ sion reflactG thiG Government's continuing offorts<br />
to protect and enhance the rights of veterans co they<br />
receivo Ty2iat is due to theoi aG componsation 2or thair<br />
service to the nation.<br />
This Govoe nmant com~ nitmont was manifectod In a nurebor of<br />
SPecifc ProoiGOG to voteravn uhich we nado during the<br />
re-cent oloction cmimpaign.<br />
The firet of these wac the promiec that we would maintain a<br />
separate DJopartsment of veterans' Affairs a promise which<br />
we have icpt ns part of the rmaccive reorganising of our<br />
depairtroz al istructures which I announced after the<br />
clectioci.<br />
we also p : orzlsed to extend full medical end hospital<br />
treitnen2-to all roturnod ex-cervicewomen from the Second<br />
World War., This initiative will bonefit come 93 wonan not<br />
currentl: 7 eligible.<br />
A Departnont of Veterans' Affairs study in 1985 ohowed that<br />
many of these women are living in most difficult financial<br />
circumstances. They were discriminated against In pay and<br />
conditions during their war oervice; they are on average<br />
older than their male counterparts; more than a third of<br />
them have never married; and many of then are now elderly,<br />
alone Pnnd in poor health.<br />
I must cetress, however, that extending this benefit to tho~ e<br />
ex-servicowomen is on the understanding that it reflects<br />
their opocial circumstances. It is not to be taken as a<br />
precedent. by other groups. Indeed the Government has<br />
receivod assurances to this effect from the RSL on behalf of<br />
the ox-ocervice community generally.<br />
A further initiative announced during the election campaign<br />
was tho commitment to provide special compensation to<br />
survivinS Australian ex-servicemen illegally interned in<br />
Nazi concentration campo for protracted periods during the<br />
Second world war.<br />
This would be a personal compensation payment of $ 10,000 per<br />
person, given in recognition of the fact that these POW's<br />
were dotained illegally and subjected to brutal treatment<br />
very much harsher than Q-nything permitted under the terms of<br />
the Geneva Convention. 0 007 54 I </p>
<p>Also anncu~ nced in the election was the Government's plans to<br />
expand the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centre<br />
in Albuir, as part of our continuing national improvement<br />
program to ensure that appropriate services are available.<br />
At a diflarent level, I believe that one of the most<br />
significa~ nt events for the vetorans' community in 1987 will<br />
be the Welcome Home March for Vietnam Veterans' in October.<br />
My colleaguos and I have expressed our strong support of<br />
this m~ tch.<br />
in addit ion to a grant we have ziade to assist the<br />
organicers, we will also provide transport for many disabled<br />
and diiiadvantaged Vietnam veterans to give them the<br />
oppoftunity to attend the wolcome home parade.<br />
Many thoucands of Auatralian Vietnam veterans, Including<br />
nursoo0 w~ ill be joined in the w~ arch by their Pmerican and<br />
Now Zead nd comrades.<br />
Mlore thcin 200,000 people attended a similar event for United<br />
Statos V61etnari Veterans in Chicago last year. I urge as<br />
many o2-3,-ou as possible to attend on 3 Octobez, because<br />
recogaition by veterans of other conflicts of the szcrifices<br />
mado byf our Vietnam veterans is integral to wider community<br />
rccogni : ion.<br />
r f~ ro~ y believe that the October parade uil be tho<br />
culmination of a long procoss of reconciliation z~ nd<br />
commun. ty acceptance of itG obligations to the veterana of<br />
Vie taaD.<br />
I belicvo wo' mnust honestly acknowledge that our involvem2ent<br />
in Vietcnom d~ id cause deep divisions in the Auctralian<br />
comnity. But whoteover our individual views on tho marito of<br />
AustaXicn involvement, we mst equally acknowledge the<br />
comr2At2 courage and integrity of our arrned forces who<br />
servead -I Vietnan.<br />
No one cAiould ever have quastioned those charccteristics<br />
nor oheuvd anyone ever have questioned our community<br />
obligntlono to the Vietnam, veterans.<br />
Ladies cnd gontloon,<br />
The Goiznrznt is confident that the excellent relationship<br />
we chcc with the n~ SL and other ex-service organisations<br />
will c , niinuo, for that relationship is a crucial part of<br />
the coo-, u-. ratve 6pirit ue havo fostered within this nation<br />
Ginco r<br />
The ef'-u;: tivenesc of the Government's veterans' affairs<br />
program. in dcpando on our viorking together and siaintaimiing a<br />
mutual ocrhange of information. With Den Humiphrays I look<br />
forward t: o working again with your: N~ ational President and<br />
anecutivze An the yearo ahoad. 0007IL5 </p>
<p>Sir William Koye' contributAon to this work of serving the<br />
voterano' com-unity dese. rveo opecial mention. n~ o and I have<br />
built up a cloco working relationship which has certainly<br />
kept me Lt touch with the nooda and opiniona of veterans,<br />
and whichi hao I bolieve kept him abreaot of the thinking of<br />
tho Govoament on issues affecting veteranc.<br />
The Govcrnment hau a great zoopect for your c: portise and<br />
cecperienco. I know that in the future you will not only<br />
continue ko art un to probloe asi they arise, but that you<br />
will comc kortynrd tith constructive ouggestions as to<br />
effectiia oolutions.<br />
That can. call! be of benofit to every veteran.<br />
Ladico c , a gontlomen,<br />
I hava zut dwelt in any detail on the Government~ s new<br />
defence i.; trateigy as articulated In the recent White Paper.<br />
All votczans and others With an interest in defence policy<br />
trill ho acevor recognise that document as the most effective<br />
and uct. fanrsighted Gtrategy over formulated for the<br />
fulacnot og the most fundanental responGIbility of any<br />
Auztralj. a: Government the defence and security of our<br />
nat ion.<br />
it io a 5; ugthor matter of pride for me that my Government<br />
hao a; tAo a -2&amp; rm and conotructive relationship with the<br />
indeed 7, gratified recently during the visit of senior<br />
meabers o tho US Administration to be told by them that th3<br />
allianco Kelationship between our two countries had never<br />
been clor.<br />
At the eaotime, my Government has opened new channels of<br />
conmunicotion with the Soviat Union, laying the foundations<br />
of a bU[ t. 1raesslikc and mutually beneficial relationship,<br />
deGpitO tl~ o profound political differences which will<br />
continuo io separate us.<br />
Within Th c gramework of those relationships, Australia has<br />
concizt(. rily tried to use whatever influence it has to<br />
enoure vii'blc, verifiablo treaty arrangenentc which may<br />
build a vimre stable, more peaceful world.<br />
It is a r. tter of great importance thereforc that the United<br />
StateG cr~ cd the Soviet union appear to be on the verge of an<br />
agreement to reduce their arsenals of Intermediate N~ uclear<br />
Forces. This would be the first time since the nuclear genie was let<br />
loose in "' 945 that two nations have agreed to reduce tho<br />
number oE their weapons. Previous agreements have limited<br />
the rato of increase of offensive nuclear weapons, but not<br />
achieved actuA cuts. 000701) </p>
<p>No one uiderstands better than veterans the true horrors of<br />
war. Perhaps then, no one should welcome more than veterans the<br />
imminent possibility of such an agreement which may allow<br />
the world at last to divert its resources away from the<br />
creatioc of forces of destruction towards the creation of<br />
the moanu to feed, clothe and shelter our fellow human<br />
beings I speakl tIo you therefore as the leader of the Government<br />
committed to a strong and cffective defence, and to the<br />
cause of peaco.<br />
We are a Government which fully recognises the important<br />
contrikti on which veterans have made to the security of our<br />
country in time of conflict and peril.<br />
I wish to assure you today that those convictions will<br />
continue to guide our policies in the period ahead. 0007 57 </p>
