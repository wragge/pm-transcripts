SPEECH BY THlE PRIME MINISTER<br />
-AT THE LAUNCH OF BOOKLET-! HOMEf SAFETY-FOR SENIOR CITIZENS'<br />
HSBOOKLE. T, aHE AFTPOSNRCtI~ Z~ tS, 4-<br />
VALUABLE PUBLICATION AND IWANT FIRST OF ALL TO PRAISE GEORGE'<br />
GEMR, THE ARTICULATE AND DOGGED MEMBER FOR CANNING, FOR<br />
PUTTING IT TOGETHER.<br />
IT WAS WHILE HE WAS VISITING THE UNITED STATES THAT GEORGE<br />
CAME ACROSS THE IDEA OF A BOOKLET TO HELP ELDERLY -PEOPLE LIVE<br />
SAFELY AT HOME.<br />
HE ADAPTED IT To AuSTRALIAN CONDITIONS AND HAS ENSURED THAT<br />
IT IS DISTRIBUTED TO THE ELDERLY AUSTRALIANS FOR WHOM IT is<br />
INTENDED$<br />
WHEN I SAY THIS BOOKLET WILL BE USE. FUL, I AM NOT IJUST<br />
INVENTING THAT CLAIM. WE SM IT WILL BE USEFUL&amp; BECAUSE OP<br />
THE RESULTS OP A SURVEY Of ELDERLY PEOPLE CONDUCTED BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL ON THE AsaING.<br />
ACCORDING TrO THIS SURVEY, FEWER THAN THREE OUT OF TEN AMONG<br />
THOSE ON NURSING HOME WAITING LISTS ACTUALLY WATEI. TO ENTER<br />
* A NURSING HOME.<br />
MORE THAN HALF STATED THAT THEY WOULD RATHER NOT MOVE AT ALL<br />
-IT SEEMS THAT FOR OLD PEOPLE, BEING ON A WAITING LIST IS A<br />
KIND OF INSURANCE POLICY FOR FUTURE CARE.<br />
WH4EN -ASKED W THEY HAD) -PUT THEIR NAMES DOWN FOR A NURS ING<br />
HOM. j LESS THAN ONE IN TEN SAID THEIR REASON HAD ANYTHING TO<br />
DO WITH HEALTH. MOST WANTED TO AVOID LI VING ALONE, SAYING<br />
THEY FELT UNABLE TO COPE WITH RUNNING A HOUSE, ORt FEARID<br />
LONELINESSp OR WERE RELUCTANT ' TO IMPOSE ON THEIR FAMILIES. </p>
<p>THIS BOOKLET WILL HELP ELIMINATE SOME OF THOSE PERCEIVED<br />
BARRIERS TO STAYING AT HOME AND WILL HELP REDUCE THE<br />
PRESSURES ON PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEY MUST MAKE THE MOVE INTO AN<br />
INSTITUTION. IT IS A PRACTICAL AND COMMONSENSE GUIDE TO LIVING SAFELY IN<br />
THE HOME.<br />
As SUCH IT FITS IN PERFECTLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S VERY<br />
S INF-ICANT -RE-THINK-OF--P-OLICIES-. DIRECIED AT AGED CARE.<br />
S UNDER PAST GOVERNMENTS-THESE-POLI-C I ES-HAVE-BEEN-SOMEWHAT--<br />
IMBALANCED AND-TENDED--TO . BE-TARGETTED _ AWAY_ FROM THE MAJORITY OF<br />
ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO STILL LIVE AT HOME,<br />
ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT OF<br />
ELDERLY AUSTRALIANS LIVE IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE. THE OTHER<br />
NINETY THREE PER CENT LIVE IN HOUSES, UNITS OR FLATS, WITH<br />
NEARLY A QUARTER OF THEM LIVING BY THEMSELVES.<br />
BIIT nOVERNMENT SPENDING ON NURSING HOMES-IS APPROACHING $ 1000<br />
MILLION, WHILE SPENDING ON humu ANu COMMUN1IT CARE SERVIOCC,<br />
TO HELP MAINTAIN PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN HOMES, IS ONLY $ 100<br />
MILLION ABOUT ONE-TENTH OF THE BUDGET FOR NURSING HOMES.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S CENTRAL OBJECTIVE, THEREFORE, IS TO BEGIN<br />
THE PROCESS OF RELATIVELY REDISTRIBUTING RESOURCES FOR CARE OF AGED<br />
PEOPLE AWAY FROM NURSING HOMES TO ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF<br />
RESIDENTIAL CARE AND COMMUNITY CARE. THIS WILL INVOLVE A<br />
SIGNIFICANT BOOST TO THE HOME AND COMMUNITY CARE PROGRAM<br />
WHICH WE ESTABLISHED IN 1985.<br />
THIS WILL INCREASE THE RANGE OF AGED CARE SERVICES AND MEAN<br />
BETTER QUALITY CARE FOR OUR ELDERLY CITIZENS, ./ 3<br />
y. </p>
<p>
INVOLVE THE COMMONWEALTH IN SPENDING AN ADDITIONAL $ 32<br />
MILLION ON HOME CARE SERVICES AND AN ADDITIONAL $ 24 MILLION<br />
ON PROMOTING THE HOSTEL SECTOR AND IN INCREASING ACCESS TO<br />
RESIDENTIAL CARE FOR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS.<br />
THESE EXTRA COSTS WILL BE INCREASINGLY OFFSET BY THE LOWER<br />
COSTS OF REDUCED GROWTH IN NURSING HOME BEDS.<br />
I-SHOULD-EMPHASISETHAT CHANGES __ TO RESIDENTIAL CARE PROGRAMS<br />
WILL NOT AFFECT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY RESIDENTS IN A NURSING<br />
HOME OR HOSTEL. -THERE-WILL BE NO REDUCTION IN THE NUMBERS OF<br />
NURSING HOMES AND-HOSTELS IN ANY STATE AND THEREFORE THERE IS<br />
NO REASON WHY ANY RESIDENTS OR THEIR FAMILIES SHOULD FEEL<br />
INSECURE ABOUT ANY ARRANGEMENTS THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE.<br />
ALL THIS MEANS THAT WE AS. A GOVERNMENT ARE DISPLAYING<br />
OUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT AUSTRALIA'S ELDERLY CITIZENS<br />
ARE WELL CARED FOR.<br />
THE WISHES OF ELDERLY PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO BE SUPPORTED IN<br />
THEIR OWN HOMES ARE AT LAST BEING ADDRESSED.<br />
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE GOING THROUGH TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES, WHICH<br />
HAVE FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO SPEND LESS THAN WE WOULD HAVE<br />
LIKED ON MANY PROJECTS, WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT COMMONWEALTH<br />
SPENDING IS ADEQUATELY'AND EFFICIENTLY DIRECTED TO THOSE IN<br />
REAL NEED.<br />
THE BOOKLET IS A CREDIT TO GEORGE GEAR AND I HOPE IT WILL BE<br />
WIDELY READ AND USED BY ELDERLY PEOPLE., AND THEIR RELATIVES<br />
AND FRIENDS. FOR IT CONTAINS WITHIN ITS PAGES SOME PRACTICAL<br />
STEPS TOWARDS ENSURING A LONGER AND HAPPIER LIFE AT HOME. </p>
