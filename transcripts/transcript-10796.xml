    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;0E................................................</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Can we start with your Government's call to stand Nick Bolkus</p>
<p>   down while he is being investigated by the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<p>   Yesterday Nick Bolkus revealed he was told by the Federal Police</p>
<p>   he is no longer under investigation. Were you aware of that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are asking that he be stood down because he deliberately divulged</p>
<p>   the contents of confidential affidavits which had the effect of</p>
<p>   prejudicing the attempt to recover Christopher Skase's ill-gotten</p>
<p>   gain. I mean, we want him to go because he should never have done</p>
<p>   that, I mean that was the most reckless, irresponsible, cheap, tawdry</p>
<p>   thing for him to have done. That's why we want him to go.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Earlier in the week though the questions were all in the context</p>
<p>   of his being investigated by the Federal Police.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they were certainly were in the context yesterday of him going</p>
<p>   because he had no business divulging the contents of a confidential</p>
<p>   affidavit and the fact that he told the press that, you know, this</p>
<p>   is all off the record and I mustn't be doing it was an indication</p>
<p>   of his guilty state of mind. I mean he has been caught red-handed</p>
<p>   doing something very wrong, indeed reprehensible, for somebody who</p>
<p>   would be the Attorney General of the Commonwealth and that is why</p>
<p>   he should go and most particularly why Mr Beazley should have the</p>
<p>   courage to get rid of him.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Well Nick Bolkus says there were plenty of copies of these affidavits</p>
<p>   floating around in the hands of the press and there were plenty</p>
<p>   of articles around to show that. The Federal Police..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That doesn't excuse it though. Do you mean to say if a libellous</p>
<p>   document comes into your hands and it also comes into my hands I</p>
<p>   can excuse the libel when I publish it by saying, oh Fran Kelly</p>
<p>   already had a copy of it. That is no excuse. That is the most pathetic</p>
<p>   excuse of the whole argument, I mean he did the deed. The fact that</p>
<p>   copies may have been in the hands of journalists does not excuse</p>
<p>   him as the alternative first law officer for what he did.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Ok, well so the Federal Police say the investigation into the leaking</p>
<p>   of the Skase court documents, which as you say, were obviously confidential,</p>
<p>   is continuing. If it is not Senator Bolkus they are looking at,</p>
<p>   can you guarantee that it is not someone in a Government Minister's</p>
<p>   office guilty of the leak in the first place which spurred the first</p>
<p>   press article with all the details.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have been assured by Senator Vanstone and I believe her,</p>
<p>   that it was not her or her office and I have also been told that</p>
<p>   the journalist who broke the story has indicated to anybody who</p>
<p>   cares to ask that the story did not come from Amanda Vanstone's</p>
<p>   office or from Amanda Vanstone.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>It is necessarily, I mean you are running very hard on this. Certainly</p>
<p>   the Government has taken it very hard. To run a censure motion against</p>
<p>   a Senator in the House of Representatives is a very unusual thing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But it is a very serious matter.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Is it also a signal that this attack is a vehicle for you to have</p>
<p>   a big go at Kim Beazley's leadership credentials. You have</p>
<p>   been running pretty hard on that...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have been asking the Australian public to look at what</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley stands for. I mean he stands for higher interest rates,</p>
<p>   he stands for putting the deficit back into the region of $10.5</p>
<p>   billion that we inherited when we came to government. I think it</p>
<p>   is legitimate, as you enter an election year, for the public to</p>
<p>   be aware of what the alternative government stands for. Now on this</p>
<p>   particular issue, we weren't anticipating it necessarily arising</p>
<p>   this week, but you deal with issues as they come along. But certainly,</p>
<p>   in the lead up to the election and there is going to be an election</p>
<p>   in the next 12 months, we all know that...</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>We'll come to that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is only fair and proper that the public see what both sides</p>
<p>   of politics stand for. That's the nature of the contest and</p>
<p>   that's the nature of the choice the public has to make.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Well, let's look at some other issues that have arisen this</p>
<p>   week. You started the year with the resignation of your Speaker,</p>
<p>   Bob Halverson. It was unexpected. Why did Bob Halverson tell you,</p>
<p>   why did he say he was quitting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if you want to know more about Bob's motive, you should</p>
<p>   talk to him. He has made a statement. I indicated my gratitude for</p>
<p>   what he had done as a Liberal Party colleague, as a Chief Opposition</p>
<p>   Whip and as a Speaker and I said that I hope because of his ability,</p>
<p>   perhaps at some stage in the future his services might be available</p>
<p>   in some other way for the country.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>High Commissioner to London, perhaps?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look Fran, what I said is what I said. What he said is what he</p>
<p>   said. I have got nothing more to say.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>There have been media reports that he has told colleagues he had</p>
<p>   lost all respect for you and that is why he was standing down. Did</p>
<p>   he say anything like that or is it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to canvass what was in the conversation. He made</p>
<p>   a statement and that statement stands and I have given a response</p>
<p>   and that's it.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Did you stand by your election policy to move towards a genuinely</p>
<p>   independent Speaker in the House of Reps and, if so, what evidence</p>
<p>   is there to suggest that you have moved towards that at all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, to start with, what I wanted to do was to make parliament</p>
<p>   more accountable. Now I have done two quite dramatic things. To</p>
<p>   start with, unlike Paul Keating, I turn up to every Question Time,</p>
<p>   unlike Paul Keating I allow 20 questions a day. You have to go back</p>
<p>   25 years to find a situation where the government of the day allows</p>
<p>   20 questions a day. We are an infinitely more accountable executive</p>
<p>   to the parliament.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>That's true but you did make specific promises about the role</p>
<p>   of the Speaker. You did, in fact, refer to the Westminster system</p>
<p>   of an independent Speaker.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Speaker has had an enormous independence. Enormous independence.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>What about reports that Government Ministers have....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You keep talking about reports. You keep talking about reports</p>
<p>   Fran.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>You deny that Government Ministers have...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'll tell you what, I believe that our behaviour was</p>
<p>   proper in all ways, entirely proper. There is nothing improper about</p>
<p>   a government, a Minister from time to time in the argument and cut</p>
<p>   and thrust of parliament disagreeing with or putting a contrary</p>
<p>   view to a Speaker's ruling. There is nothing wrong with that,</p>
<p>   that happens all the time. I can remember Fraser doing that. I can</p>
<p>   remember Whitlam doing that. I can remember Hawke doing it and I</p>
<p>   can remember Keating doing it. There is nothing unusual about that.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Let's turn to a major reform of your Government, the $1.7</p>
<p>   billion shake-up of the CES job placement agencies. Are you confident</p>
<p>   your new system can't be and isn't being rorted?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look Fran there are literally hundreds of companies that have won</p>
<p>   contracts. They were won as a result of an arms length tender process.</p>
<p>   See the Labor Party has got a bit of a dilemma on this, they have</p>
<p>   got to make up their mind. In relation to that Natural Heritage</p>
<p>   Trust they say Ministers shouldn't be involved but in relation</p>
<p>   to the job placement system they say Ministers should be involved.</p>
<p>   Now what we did with the job placement was to say: right we will</p>
<p>   give it to the department, the Minister will stay away from it,</p>
<p>   we'll let an independent tender process run and now when a</p>
<p>   few people who have missed out start complaining and alleging rorts,</p>
<p>   the Labor Party is saying: oh Kim, you have got to intervene and</p>
<p>   overturn that decision.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Ok, well let's look at that...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no but I just. What is really happening here Fran, is you have</p>
<p>   got a completely new system. It's an exciting system. Three</p>
<p>   to four times as many job placement points of reference than under</p>
<p>   the old system. This is, we are trail blazing the world with this</p>
<p>   new system and it's obviously got to be given an opportunity</p>
<p>   to work. It comes into operation on the first of May. It is an attempt</p>
<p>   to focus on better outcomes for the unemployed and naturally some</p>
<p>   of those people who have had contracts of various sorts, who have</p>
<p>   missed out in the tender process are going to be unhappy. Now, I</p>
<p>   understand that but I have to say, in defence of the Government,</p>
<p>   we had an independent system, we had it checked by probity experts,</p>
<p>   they all gave it a big tick. Now if people have got complaints then</p>
<p>   there is a procedure for handling those complaints but we played</p>
<p>   by the book on this.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Well that's true but had that....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And that's what really matters.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Has that thrown up some problems? I mean the example we are hearing</p>
<p>   of in Lakemba, the man being awarded a million dollar contract,</p>
<p>   no office, no phone, no desk, no typewriter and now talk he is going</p>
<p>   to sub-contract virtually out all the work. Is that a teething problem</p>
<p>   or is it something you are concerned about and are asking your Minister</p>
<p>   to have a close look at?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fran, you can't have it both ways. You either have an independent</p>
<p>   tender process..</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>But it has got to work.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well hang on, it is. So don't say it is not. It is. I mean</p>
<p>   this is the point. We decided to have an arms length system and</p>
<p>   the fact that you talk about that man in Lakemba, well the system</p>
<p>   doesn't come into operation until the first of May. He complied</p>
<p>   with all of the conditions and the judgement was made, not by David</p>
<p>   Kemp, not by John Howard, not by a member of the Government, it</p>
<p>   was made by an independent tender process. Now what you are really</p>
<p>   saying and what the critics are saying is that independent tender</p>
<p>   process was in some way wrong or corrupt. Now I think that is a</p>
<p>   very dangerous allegation to make. It is unfair and you have got</p>
<p>   to substantiate it before you pursue it.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, yesterday you met with Tasmanian Independent, Brian</p>
<p>   Harradine. You promised him your tax package, when it is revealed,</p>
<p>   will provide some special measures to assist families with children,</p>
<p>   financially. What measures do you have in mind? What did you promise</p>
<p>   Brian Harradine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I didn't go into any particularity but I did repeat to</p>
<p>   him and I repeat now that when we restructure the tax system, families,</p>
<p>   dependent children, will be big winners. I made that plain in August</p>
<p>   of last year when I announced tax reform, we gave families a lot</p>
<p>   of help through the family tax initiative and it has long been one</p>
<p>   of my policy goals in public life to improve the tax system to give</p>
<p>   greater recognition to Australian parents who have the cost and</p>
<p>   the responsibility of raising children. I believe our present tax</p>
<p>   system is still too insensitive, far too insensitive to the cost</p>
<p>   involved in raising children. And that tax position of families</p>
<p>   has steadily declined over the years and I will want to see in that</p>
<p>   tax reform package Australian families get an even better deal than</p>
<p>   what they have so far received under this Government. They have</p>
<p>   done very well under this Government but I want to go further and</p>
<p>   that's basically what I told Brian Harradine.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>And what's the chances of families seeing your tax package</p>
<p>   before the budget comes down in May?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the tax package will come out well before the election so</p>
<p>   people can make a judgement. Beyond that I am not going to talk</p>
<p>   about timing.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, this week there has been a lot of economic news</p>
<p>   which included a trade report that said employment growth will slow</p>
<p>   later this year because of the Asia situation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no the rate of increase will slow. It didn't say there</p>
<p>   would be an absolute downturn.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>All right the rate of increase will slow.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will still go up but it is just that it won't go up quite</p>
<p>   so sharply.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>You told your Party room this week that the election will be when</p>
<p>   the timing is right. There is obviously a lot of speculation about</p>
<p>   election timing. I guess that means when you can win, can you win</p>
<p>   with the employment rate dropping and presumably unemployment going</p>
<p>   up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fran, I am not going to spend the next nine,10,11,12 months speculating</p>
<p>   about whether we can or can't win. Let me say right here and</p>
<p>   now, I don't take the public for granted, I have got to run</p>
<p>   very hard to win the next election. We live in volatile political</p>
<p>   times. I owe the Australian people a conscientious, hard working,</p>
<p>   committed performance as Prime Minister this year, which I intend</p>
<p>   to deliver and I have begun to deliver. I also promised the Australian</p>
<p>   people that we will be exposing the alternative. We will be reminding</p>
<p>   them that that cut in their interest rates which is worth a $100</p>
<p>   a week pay rise will be at risk if Labor wins because of their high</p>
<p>   deficit policy. We'll be drawing their attention to a lack</p>
<p>   of an alternative economic strategy, their desire to end our attempts</p>
<p>   to reform the waterfront, their indifference to tax reform, their</p>
<p>   desire to keep yesterday's taxation system because they don't</p>
<p>   believe in reform.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister if I can ask you finally about image, The Bulletin</p>
<p>   reported this week that John Singleton, the advertising agent,</p>
<p>   told someone, your side, that if he was running Labor's campaign,</p>
<p>   which he is not, it would be Kim Beazley good bloke, John Howard</p>
<p>   mean so-and-so. Is that why you are targeting Kim Beazley's</p>
<p>   image so hard this first week back because you agree with John Singleton</p>
<p>   that Kim Beazley's image is positive with the voters right</p>
<p>   now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven't read that article and I don't know that</p>
<p>   I have found myself in agreement with Labor's erstwhile advertising</p>
<p>   campaign manager ever.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>So you are not concerned about your image perhaps being John Howard</p>
<p>   mean so-and -so...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I tell you Fran I am not going to spend the next eight, nine,</p>
<p>   10,11,12 months analysing the analysis. A Prime Minister or an Opposition</p>
<p>   Leader shouldn't do that. He or she should be talking about</p>
<p>   issues that are relevant to the Australian public. What the Australian</p>
<p>   public wants to know is about our record. They will be reminded</p>
<p>   that we've reduced interest rates by record amounts. We have</p>
<p>   converted a deficit of $10.5 in two years into a surplus, that we</p>
<p>   now have had jobs growth of 145,000 over the last five months.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>But how do you think they see you, Prime Minister, Australian voters?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that doesn't matter. I will find that out at the election</p>
<p>   won't I?</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>Ok, so you are not troubled but your harsh budget cuts and some</p>
<p>   of those measures have made people look at you as, in a negative</p>
<p>   light, as a mean...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fran, I think that most of the Australian community, in the light</p>
<p>   of what has happened in Asia, are applauding the fact that the Government</p>
<p>   had the courage to turn Mr Beazley's concealed deficit of $10.5</p>
<p>   billion into a surplus. It's reduced our interest rates, it's</p>
<p>   protected against the worst of the Asian downturn, it has given</p>
<p>   us the fastest growing economy just about in the Western world and</p>
<p>   for the homebuyer it has been the equivalent of a $100 a week wage</p>
<p>   rise. Now that is not a bad package in two years. I don't think</p>
<p>   the Australian public is unhappy with that. I think they, now, in</p>
<p>   retrospect, admire the courage of a government that was willing</p>
<p>   to do what we did.</p>
<p>KELLY:</p>
<p>It sounds like we are going to hear that list of claims for a long</p>
<p>   time between now and the election whenever that is. Prime Minister</p>
<p>   thank you very much.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
