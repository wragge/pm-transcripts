PRIMIE MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 30 APRIL, 1980<br />
PREFERENCE TO AUSTRALIAN-MADE GOODS<br />
The Government is to introduce legislation providing for<br />
Commonwealth authorities to comply with the Government's policy<br />
of giving preference to Australian-made goods. The legislation<br />
will be designed to over-ride certain aspects of the enabling<br />
legislation of some authorities which could restrict their<br />
freedom to carry out the Government's policy.<br />
While the legislation will generally provide for all Commonwealth<br />
authorities to follow the Government's policy there will be<br />
provision in the legislation for exemption in situations where<br />
a special case could be made.<br />
I have written to the Premiers of New South Wa les, Victoria<br />
and South Australia seeking their views on the possible extension<br />
of the Government's policy of preference to Australian-made<br />
goods, to Commonwealth authorities jointly own. ed or controlled<br />
by the Commonwealth and other State Governments, such as the<br />
Joint Coal Board, the Albury/ Wodonga Development Corporation and<br />
the River Murray Commission.<br />
While there may well be special reasons for exempting certain<br />
authorities or categories of supplies from the Government's policy,<br />
there appears to be no reason why joint ownership as such should<br />
necessarily result in the exclusion of such authorities. </p>
