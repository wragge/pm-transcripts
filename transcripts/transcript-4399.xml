FOR PRESS 17 M~ AY 1977<br />
ADDRBSS AT RC1' d3AbPTON J. R~ nD. UM CAM. KPAIGN<br />
It is very' good to be in Rockhampton again in th-e last week of<br />
the referendum campaign-.<br />
Across Queensland, and aoxoss Australia, support for all ' Lour<br />
referendum proposals is strengthening, and I am confident that<br />
they will be successful on Saturday, because they are fair, just<br />
and sensible, and because they will make a mnajor conitr~ bution<br />
to constitutional development of our country.<br />
They are not like many other referendums which were initiated<br />
solely by Canberra and which. sought to increase Canberra's power.<br />
They come from the 1976 Hobart Constitutional Conventioa-in which.<br />
all. State Parliaments, the Federal Parliament, and local government<br />
were represented. They were supported at the Convention in which<br />
the States bad 72 of the 92 votes aid the Commonwealth had only 16.<br />

four proposals.<br />
The Queensland GoVernment will have to waste even more of the<br />
* ta-xpayers money on misleading anxti-referendun advert isemTen ts if<br />
it is to have any hope of explaining this fact away, and I do not<br />
believe the people of Queensland will be misled or frightened by<br />
deceptive advertising.<br />
It was not just the Convention that supported the changes. All<br />
the major federal parties support tham on a bipartisen basis. 0<br />
Each of the four proposals passed in. the HIouse of Representatives<br />
without a single dissent, and all were passed by anm overwhielming<br />
majority in the Senate. On 21 March, a majority of Que-ensland<br />
State ' National Party MPs supportedI all 11oux propQsals.<br />
Unfortunately they have somersaulted since. But the National<br />
Party Organisation is firm-ly behind the referendxims, and some*<br />
distinguished Queensland statesmnen and women Sir-Gordon Chalk,<br />
Dame Annabelle Rankin and Six Charltes Adermann, have put thmselves V<br />
behind the referendum.<br />
Queenslanders have traditionally takjcn a leading role in<br />
cons ti tuti onal refo-ni, voting in favour of referendums on no less P<br />
than 18 of the 32 referendums since Federation -a far higher<br />
proportion thtan some of the southe'. rn states. I feel corif idenit<br />
that by Saturday night that figuxe will be increased to 22.. / We </p>
<p>-2-<br />
14e deplore the Queensland Governments use of public money to run ani<br />
intensive advertising c&amp; wrpaiqr1 against. the, referendum., The A. B. C.<br />
provides egual time for publicising both sides of the case. Two<br />
hours for the Yes case to b&amp; e piut. and -to -houirs f or advocates of the<br />
?-No case to put their views. _ No Federal fundu are being spent on<br />
advertising the Yes campaign.~ Yet the Qi eens land Government is<br />
spending-huge an. ounts. of . taxpayers ' fund-~ mounit -an--aclertiing__...<br />
campaign which grossly distorts the~ f" ots,"<br />
I-1-. e all know th-at Joh -Bjelke-Peter~ an put-th-e/ interests of Queensland<br />
first Ahen. be fogtagaiinst the 10~ bor Governmnent's attempts to<br />
inv-ade areas of States rights. And we applaud him for this. Buthis<br />
opposition to these referendun~ tz-is completely unjustified-. The<br />
only way it can be explained4 is that-h-v1n g once Justifiably -got<br />
on the anti-cai erra 0orse, he fi~~ i√± t?. dE o~~.<br />
this is tragic-<br />
These referendums are our opportunity to use the amending process the<br />
Founding Fathers built in
Constitution which we are-all rightly proud of is strengthened and<br />
continues to serve the needs of our nation.<br />
The first of the four refere-ndum proposals is for simultaneous election<br />
for the House of PRepresentatives and the senate. The simultaneous<br />
elections proposal was supported unanimously at the-Convent-ion. Those<br />
in favour included Nit. Knox, M4r. Hewitt, Mr. Lickiss, Mr. Porter, Sir<br />
Charles Court, and not leas., Oxr. Bjel-ke-Petersen. Every representati<br />
of the Qu--eensland Government. supported the simnultaneous elections<br />
proposal just seven months ago at the Constitutional Convention. And<br />
this siupport was not surprising.'.--<br />
They bave a question to answjer, why di-' d they change. When we passed<br />
_ the. legislation.* for.-this. referendum we had every reason to be lieve<br />
that Mr. Blelke-Patersen . an d . thie Queensland . TCovernnt--Wdb--plte<br />
behind the legislation. They had voted for it at the Convention.<br />
it is :-iust plain commuon sense that Federal Elections always beheld at<br />
the -same time---that-you should-only -have to Vote in Fbderal ElectioJ<br />
when you have to choose 7-ustralia's Government. This proposal means<br />
we will not have. to vote in as many Federal Elections. It will also<br />
protect the less populous States liLke Queensland,~ When there are<br />
separate elections for the House of Representatives, political leaders<br />
are tempted to confine their campaign to New South Wales and Victoria,~<br />
which have over 60% of House of Representatives seats-But if the<br />
Senate, in which all States are equally Tepresented, is elected at<br />
the same time, the cappaign must be fought vigorously in all six Stat<br />
and * the views of the people of the 5maller States are much more<br />
influential. Some have said that this referendum is unnecessary that simultaneou<br />
elections can be achieved by bringing the House of Representatives<br />
election forward to coincide with that of the Senate. But that is<br />
neither practical nor a desirable method of achieving simultaneous<br />
elections-. Unless the Constitutionl is changed, the only way to bringD<br />
the elections tocgther woul~ d be repeatedly to cut short the tem of<br />
the House of Representatives. The three year term is however alread,<br />
/ relativelI E F I, Fv~. 4 </p>
<p>-3<br />
relatively short one of thie Shortest Parliamtentary terms in the<br />
democratic world. I'urther reducing it would damage good Government-.<br />
i4ost importantly, this proposal will maintain and strengthen the<br />
Senate and the protection it gives Elie States. if this proposal<br />
is not passed, the future of the Senate will ultimately be put in<br />
jeopardy. it was quite by chance that in November 1975 when the House of<br />
Representatives was dissolved, bills ey-dsted which created the<br />
circumstances permitting a Doiuble Dissolution of both Hlouses. Had<br />
Liberal Senators not been liable to face the people themselves, so<br />
that their actions miqht be Jiudged, a number of themn would not have<br />
agreed to block supply. 1, myself, would never have sought the<br />
blocking of supply from a Senate that would not itself have also<br />
faccd the people of Australia. The Senators attitude was sotundly<br />
based because if any Bouse of Parliament were to send another House<br />
to the polls, while not. itself being judqed by the people, it woulld<br />
not survive.<br />
If you subscribe to the fundamental principle that th-e Senate should<br />
not be able to force the Government t~ o the polls unless the Senators<br />
t-hemselves face the voters at the same time, the Constitution milst<br />
be changed to ensure that this will always occur. You can do thisby<br />
voting Yes to.-simultaneous elctions, on 21 May.<br />
Unless the present situation is changed, .1 can foresee two<br />
alternative consequence 8. The Senate-might refuse to check a bad<br />
Government % nless there happened to exist the circuim-stances which r<br />
would permit; a Double Dissolution.. Al tern at ively, if Senators were<br />
to make the Bouze of Representatives go to an election without facing<br />
the people themselves, then there would be a public outcry against<br />
the Senate which could lead to the Senate' s powerB being restricted<br />
or abolished. flither of these alternatives would be bad for<br />
democratic goverment, bad for the States, bad for Australia.<br />
That is why it is important that this re -fcrre-ndun bip passed.<br />
ANo vote on May 21 is a vote for the ultimate destruction ofI.<br />
the Senate and one of the world's best constitutions.<br />
The second rcferendumn proposal is that Whenever a Senator dies orf<br />
resigns, he will be replaced, for thie remainder of his term of office,<br />
by a M~ ember of the same party. This will quarantee that your choice<br />
of par-ties for the Senate cannot be altered by accident or design.<br />
Under the Constitution as it now stands, a Sep-ate vacancy can<br />
completely change the par-ty balance. It is fundamental to our<br />
democracy that only the people sbould determine the balance of the<br />
parties in the Senate-. Aqain, this is of part icxxlar importanlce to<br />
the less populated States becuase it is the Senate in which all<br />
States are equally represented, The importance of this cannot<br />
be understated, and the example Evan Adermann put; to me last night<br />
brings it home. He of ten travels home from Canbcrra with almost<br />
all the Queensland Senators. VWhat would happen, he asked, if the<br />
aeroplane were to be Involved in a tragic! accident? Would the people<br />
of Queensland of any state be content to make the party affiliatiorn,<br />
of their Senators depend on some State Government observi-n a<br />
convention that mighit be breached by considcrations of political<br />
advantage. Constit-utions, are supposedi to rnaxe laws for this sort<br />
of situation not allow it to depend on the political calculations<br />
of State Governments-Once tis propcosal is accept ed, the peoples<br />
choice will be preser-ved until they have an opportunity to ma) c<br />
another choice at the. nc&gt;: t electio-n. / Th-e th ird </p>

The third referendum proposal " is to, give voters in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and NortherrnTerritory the basic right to vote<br />
In all future referendums. This i-s a f~ aetal right all other<br />
Australians have, I k, now of ' sio , rrational or reasonable argument<br />
for denying it to Territorial -vpters. Te have the same obligations<br />
as other Australians-They pay( tax-sl t hey are-oblicged to&gt; obser-ve;<br />
the laws of the Corrnonweal th, they ' v e ' 7for Membezs of Parliament<br />
and tho outcom~ e of referenldums fif fect thei as much as they do<br />
other Australians. Restoring this right will strengthen Australian<br />
democracy. The fourth and final. referendurm pr, Js to set a retiring age<br />
for Federal Judges. Hligh Court&gt;' j.. stices. would retire at 70 and the<br />
retirement age for other Federal. -Court jbdges would be determined<br />
Joy Parliament. The proposal does not affect the terms of judges<br />
already appoint ed to the Bench. Most jobs have retirement ages,<br />
and for good reason. Judges, are as affected by old age as the<br />
rest of uts. In Queensland the judges retiring age is set at<br />
Opposition to the same retiring age for Federal judges certainly<br />
cannot be based on any view that this adversely affects Queensland's<br />
judicial system-It is only fair that after the age of 70 responsibility<br />
should be handed over to younger people. This is even more<br />
Important now that the new system of Federal Family Courts has been<br />
set up.<br />
All1 fouy referendum proposal. s are fair, just aid reasonable. They<br />
have been extensively vonsideied. They have the support of a-li<br />
major Federal parties. They do not involve more power for Canberra.<br />
They will strengthen the Senate :. aad ensuxe that it can better look<br />
after tJ-io interests of the State. They will mak~ e the Constitution.<br />
Work better.<br />
The polls show tbat all referendums have : sbstantial and influential<br />
Stipport in all States. Support for the four proposals is increasing<br />
in Queensland, despite the expensive and futile attempts to distort<br />
thbe proposals. But those people who think the referendum proposition.,<br />
shou-ld be passed, cannot afford to be comrplacent. The referendums<br />
will not pass themselves.<br />
All people who care about constitutional and political reform in<br />
this country have a responsibility to work for the referendums.<br />
If we all do this, then the referendums will be passed, and we will<br />
have n Constitution. which serves Australia's needs more effectively. </p>
