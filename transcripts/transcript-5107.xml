FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 14 JULY 1979<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
In the light of developments, the Prime -Minister has<br />
decided to postpone his planned Address to the Natic<br />
tomorrow night.<br />
It is noted that as a result of the Government's action<br />
in proclaiming legislation regarding the position of<br />
public servants, there is the possibility of the trade<br />
union movement adopting a more reasonable approach to<br />
the dispute involving the A. T. E. A.<br />
The Goverment earnestly hopes good sense will prevail and<br />
the bans and limitations imposed by the union on Telecom's<br />
operation will be lifted as soon as possible.<br />
