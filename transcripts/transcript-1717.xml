FOR PRESS 874 874<br />
IUD 53 STATE . iENTB' THE MINISER FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
( Hon. David Fairbairn, M. P.)<br />
SNOY WATER HELPS FARMERS<br />
The Snowy Miountains Scheme this summer is helping<br />
drought-affected farmers in the iMurray and i. urrumbidgee Valleys.<br />
The iinister for National Development ( 1ir. Fairbairn)<br />
said today that the Scheme would provide nearly one million acre<br />
feet of water this irrigation season for irrigators along these<br />
rivers thus augmenting the natural flows which have been greatly<br />
reduced because of the drought.<br />
He said the Sncwy Mountains Council, in accordance with<br />
the Snowy ;' ountains agreement and in response to requests made<br />
by the River iiurray Commission and the '. ater Conservation and<br />
Irrigation Commission of New South .: ales would provide:<br />
For the lurray, as from iiay 1, 1967 a diversion of<br />
nearly 400,000 acre feet from the Snowy to the<br />
. iurray basin.<br />
For the Tumut/ Murrumbidgee, 70,000 acre feet a month<br />
for eight months from September 1.<br />
" Many representations have been made to me and to the<br />
Snowy ountains Council for releases of water for irrigation<br />
purposes from Lake ucumbene, the principal storage of the<br />
Snowy i. ountains Scheme," 1Mr. Fairbairn said.<br />
" There is apparently a widespread impression that the<br />
lake is full and that the Council is holding back water for use<br />
in generating electricity next winter.<br />
" The situation is that streamflows in the Snowy area<br />
are the lowest recorded since their measurement commenced over<br />
years ago. as a result Lake Eucumbene is only about one<br />
third full. " However, despite the limited resources and the need to<br />
stretch them as far as possible, the Council has guaranteed considerable<br />
quantities of water for the Murray and Miurrumbidgee<br />
irrigators". Mr. F9irbnirn stressed that in the present circumstances<br />
it was not possible for the Couicil to incre;, se these guarantees.<br />
Some reserves had to be held in Lake iucumbene to snfeguard both<br />
irrigators 9nd electricity consumers against the possibility of<br />
an extension of the drought into next senson.<br />
