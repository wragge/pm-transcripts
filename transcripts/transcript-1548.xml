TEXT OF REMARKS MADE BY VICE PRESIDENT C. K. YEN<br />
AT A DINIMR IN T AIPEI APRIL,_ 9<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Holt, Your Excellencies,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
On behalf of the Government and the people of the<br />
Republic of China, I wish to extend to Prime Minister and<br />
Mrs. Holt a warm and sincere welcome.<br />
Prime Minister Holt is not only an outstanding political<br />
leader in his own country, he has also won wide acclaim as a<br />
world statesman. Since his assumption of office as Prime Minister<br />
he has contributed in a significant way to the taintenance of world<br />
peace and justice and to the economic and other developments in<br />
his own country. On several previous occasions I have had the<br />
pleasure of meeting Prime Minister Holt at International Conferences<br />
while he was serving as Treasurer for his government. It is,<br />
therefore, a great pleasure to renew his acquaintance here in Taipei.<br />
Mrs. Holt, as we all know, is an accomplished lady in her<br />
own right. Her dedication to the welfare of her country and the<br />
valuable assistance she has rendered the Prime Minister is truly<br />
worthy of admiration. We are very pleased to have her visit us<br />
and I wish to extend her a special welcome.<br />
Since the end of World War II, Australia has been taking<br />
an increasingly active part in international affairs. She is an<br />
active partictant in programs of economic and technical co-operation<br />
with the Asian countries. A member of the South-East Asia Treaty<br />
Organization, she is also an active member of the Asian and Pacific<br />
Council. Today, Australia is actively helping the Republic of<br />
Vietnam in resisting communist aggression. All these activities<br />
are eloquent testimonials to the wisdom and far-sightedness of the<br />
Australian Government and its political leaders.<br />
The Republic o. China and the Cornnonaealth of Australia<br />
have lon5 enjoyed friendly relations and close co-oparation in<br />
international affairs. Our two peoples are similarly dedicated<br />
to the noble ideals of freedom, justice and peace. With the<br />
re-opening of the Australian Embassy in the Republic of China,<br />
I am certain that the friendly relations betwe. n our two countries<br />
will be furthur strengthened.<br />
I appreciate very much the fact that, despite their heavy<br />
schedule, Prime Minister and Mrs. Holt have oome to visit us. I<br />
am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to have an exchange<br />
of views wiith Prime Minister Holt on the world situation and on<br />
matters of common interest to our two countries. His visit, I am<br />
sure, will be a new milestone in the history of Sino-Australian<br />
relations. Ladies and Gentlemen, I now request that you join me in<br />
a toast to Her Majesty the Queen.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I ask you again to join me in<br />
a toast to Prime iinister and Mrs. Ilt and the prosperity of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia. * X x * X </p>
