SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT PREMIER ZHAO'S<br />
WELCOMING BANQUET<br />
BEIJING 19 MAY 1986<br />
MR PREMIER, IT IS GOOD BE TO AMONG FRIENDS AGAIN IN BEIJING.<br />
THERE ARE MANY FAMILIAR FACES HERE THIS EVENING WHO, IN<br />
DIFFERENT FIELDS, ARE FIRM FRIENDS OF AUSTRALIA. IN THE TWO<br />
YEARS SI'NCE I WAS LAST IN bEIJING I AM GLAD THAT WE<br />
PERSONALLY HAVE KEPT CLOSELY IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER AND<br />
THAT WE AND OTHER LEADERS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN ABLE<br />
FREQUENTLY TO RENEW FRIENDSHIPS THROUGH THE VISITS OF CLOSE<br />
COLLEAGUES. IT IS NOW THIRTEEN YEARS SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC<br />
RELATIONS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA AND THE BILATERAL<br />
RELATIONSHIP HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THEN.<br />
THERE IS NOW A STEADY EXCHANGE OF VISITS BETWEEN THE POLITICAL<br />
LEADERS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES, IN 1983 I WELL REMEMBER<br />
WELCOMING YOU, MR PREMIER, TO AUSTRALIA THE FIRST VISIT BY<br />
A CHINESE PREMIER TO AUSTRALIA AND, OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE<br />
TO MY GOVERNMENT, THE FIRST VISIT OF A FOREIGN HEAD OF GOVERNMENT<br />
TO AUSTRALIA AFTER THE LABOR PARTY WAS ELECTED TO GOVERNMENT.<br />
IN 1984 I VISITED CHINA FOR THE FIRST TIME AS PRIME MINISTER<br />
ALTHOUGH'I HAD BEEN ABLE TO VISIT PREVIOUSLY IN ANOTHER CAPACITY. </p>
<p>AND. IN 1985, WE HAD THE HONOUR OF WELCOMING THE GENERAL<br />
SECRETARY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, HU YAOBANG, TO<br />
AUSTRALIA. MY CURRENT VISIT MARKS THE FIFTH SUCCESSIVE<br />
YEAR THAT CHINESE AND AUSTRALIAN LEADERS HAVE VISITED EACH<br />
OTHERS COUNTRY ITSELF A CLEAR INDICATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL<br />
VITALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP.<br />
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS CLOSE AND GROWING, AND IS ONE DESIGNEDTO<br />
ENDURE, ECONOMIC RELATIONS HAVE GROWN IN LINE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF THE POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP. IT IS A RELATIONSHIP WHICH<br />
OFFERS THE PROMISE OF MAJOR ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO BOTH COUNTRIES<br />
AS TIME PASSES AND WHICH IS WORTH TAKING THE TIME TO ESTABLISH<br />
ON A FIRM FOUNDATION IN THESE FORMATIVE YEARS. I APPRECIATE<br />
THAT AT SOME TIMES THIS WILL REQUIRE THAT PROGRESS ON<br />
PARTICULAR ISSUES MAY BE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN ON OTHER ISSUES<br />
AS COMPLEX QUESTIONS ARE EXPLORED PROPERLY. BUT LET THERE BE<br />
NO DOUBT OF THE DETERMINATION OF BOTH GOVERNMENTS TO WORK<br />
THROUGH AND BEYOND EVEN THESE TIMES, WHICH IN OTHER<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES COULD LEAD TO FRUSTRATION. </p>
<p>THE VOLUME AND VALUE OF OUR TRADE WITH EACH OTHER HAS GROWN<br />
ENORMOUSLY SINCE WE FIRST MET IN 1983, WE ARE CONSCIOUS<br />
OF THE FACT THAT THE GROWTH HAS-BEEN MORE PRONOUNCED IN<br />
AUSTRALIA'S EXPORT TRADE WITH CHINA THAN IN OUR IMPORT TRADE.<br />
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR GENERAL-POLICIES TO PROMOTE<br />
INCREASED COMPETITIVENESS AND AN OUTWARD LOOKING ORIENTATION<br />
FOR AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY, WE HAVE BEEN STEADILY REDUCING<br />
ARTIFICIAL IMPEDIMENTS TO EXPANSION OF OUR IMPORT TRADE. IN<br />
ADDITION, SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHINA ACTION PLAN<br />
AS A RESULT OF YOUR 1983 VISIT TO AUSTRALIA, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE PROMOTION OF<br />
CHINESE EXPORTS.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF EXPANDING EXPORTS IN YOUR<br />
MODERNISATION PROCESS, STRESSED RECENTLY IN YOUR REPORT TO<br />
THE NATIONALPEOPLES CONGRESS. WE ARE PLEDGED TO CONTINUE<br />
TO PURSUE POLICIES WHICH EXPAND TRADE. WE ARE PLEDGED ALSO<br />
TO CONTINUE-TO ENCOURAGE AUSTRALIAN FIRMS TO PARTICIPATE IN<br />
THE EXPANSION OF CHINA'S PRODUCTIVE: CAPACITY FOR EXPORT,<br />
AND TO ASSIST DIRECTLY THE MARKETING EFFORTS OF CHINESE<br />
ENTERPRISES IN AUSTRALIA. WHEN WE. FIRST MET, I HAVE BEEN TOLD,<br />
THERE WAS ONLY ONE SINO-AUSTRALIAN JOINT VENTURE IN OPERATION.<br />
NOW MORE THAN 16 SINO-AUSTRALIAN JOINT VENTURES.' HAVE BEEN<br />
SIGNED AND HAVE EITHER BEGUN OR ARE PREPARING TO BEGIN<br />
OPERATING IN CHINA, AND A FURTHER 37 AGREEMENTS ARE UNDER<br />
DISCUSSION. </p>
<p>CHINA HAS SHOWN ACTIVE INTEREST IN LARGE-SCALE INVESTMENT<br />
IN THE AUSTRALIAN RESOURCES SECTOR, AND YOU AND I WILL<br />
PARTICIPATE IN A SIGNING CELEBRATION TOMORROW WHICH IS THE<br />
FIRST PRODUCT OF THAT INTEREST. SINCE WE FIRST MET THREE<br />
YEARS AGO, THREE AUSTRALIAN BANKS HAVE ESTABLISHED<br />
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES IN BEIJING AND AS A DIRECT RESULT OF<br />
REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO ME IN BEIJING TWO YEARS AGO, WE<br />
WELCOME THE RE-OPENING OF A BRANCH OF THE BANK OF CHINA IN<br />
SYDNEY EARLIER THIS YEAR.<br />
EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, CULTURAL AND SPORTING EXCHANGES<br />
HAVE LENT ADDITIONAL SUBSTANCE TO THE RELATIONSHIP, AUSTRALIA<br />
HAS NOTED CHINA'S DECISION IN 1985 TO EXPAND ITS NATIONAL<br />
EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER FURTHER TODEVELOP ITS<br />
HUMAN RESOURCES POTENTIAL TO MEET THE PRESSING REQUIREMENTS<br />
OF MODERNISATION.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT SEES MUTUAL ADVANTAGE IN A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION<br />
OF EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES WITH CHINA, WE SEE THIS AS<br />
CONTRIBUTING DIRECTLY AND USEFULLY TO CHINA'S MODERNISATION<br />
PROCESS,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTH AUSTRALIA AND CHINA HAVE PLACED<br />
CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR RELATIONS<br />
ON THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONTACTS, </p>
<p>WE HAVE IN AUSTRALIA AN AUSTRALIA-CHINA COUNCIL WHOSE<br />
CHIEF FUNCTION IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING<br />
THROUGH SUCH CONTACTS, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO<br />
ADVISE YOU THAT THE GOVERNMENT, ON THE ADVICE OF THE<br />
FOREIGN MINISTER, HAS APPOINTED A FORMER PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR GOUGH WHITLAM, AS THE NEW CHAIRMAN OF THE AUSTRALIA<br />
CHINA COUNCIL.<br />
THIS APPOINTMENT IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT SINCE BACK<br />
IN 1972 MR WHITLAM WAS THE PRIME MOVER BEHIND THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND<br />
AUSTRALIA, MR WHITLAM'S CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIA-CHINA<br />
RELATIONS WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT AND WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT<br />
HE CAN CONTINUE IN HIS NEW CAPACITY THE PROMOTION OF THE<br />
RELATIONSHIP WHICH HE HELPED BRING ABOUT.<br />
MR PREMIER, THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP<br />
REFLECTS OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON THE ASIA/ PACIFIC<br />
REGION IN WHICH OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE LOCATED, AND ON<br />
THAT REGION'S ASPIRATIONS FOR PEACE, SECURITY AND ECONOMIC<br />
PROSPERITY. IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT TENSIONS STILL EXIST IN THE REGION.<br />
MOST NOTABLY IN INDOCHINA, AFGHANISTAN AND THE KOREAN<br />
PENINSULA, IT IS OUR COMMON HOPE THAT JUST AND PEACEFUL<br />
SETTLEMENTS MAY SOON BE FOUND IN THESE AREAS OF POTENTIAL<br />
DANGER SO THAT ALL COUNTRIES CAN PAR-T-~-tAR MORE FULLY IN<br />
THE DYNAMIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ALREADY OCCURRING<br />
IN MUCH OF OUR REGION. </p>
<p>WHILE IT IS NOT YET ALTOGETHER A REGION OF PEACETHE<br />
PACIFIC REGION AND ESPECIALLY THE WESTERN PACIFIC REGION<br />
HAS EMERGED DECISIVELY IN RECENT DECADES AS THE MAJOR<br />
CENTRE OF WORLD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE HUGE PROGRESS<br />
THAT CHINA HAS MADE OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS HAS<br />
CONTRIBUTED NEW MOMENTUM TO THESE HISTORIC PROCESSES,<br />
THIS GENERATION HAS BEFORE IT THE REAL PROSPECT OF OUR<br />
REGION EMERGING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY AS A PLACE<br />
OF PROSPERITY FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLES, BUT FOR THIS<br />
TO COME TO PASS WE ALL NEED PEACE, AND THE COUNTRIES OF<br />
THE REGION MUST INTEGRATE THEIR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS<br />
ON THE BASIS OF COMPLEMENTARY AND MUTUAL ADVANTAGE,<br />
MR PREMIER, WE HAVE HAD USEFUL DISCUSSIONS TODAY ON A<br />
RANGE OF ISSUES, I LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO THE REST<br />
OF MY PROGRAM IN BEIJING AND TO TRAVELLING TO A NUMBER<br />
OF PROVINCES TO SEE AT FIRST HAND THE PROGRESS REALISED<br />
THUS FAR IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CHINA'S REFORM AND<br />
MODERNISATION STRATEGY,<br />
YOU KNOW MR PREMIER THAT SINCE OUR FIRST MEETING IN 1983<br />
I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, AND IN MANY COUNTRIES, THAT WHAT<br />
IS HAPPENING TO CHINA UNDER THIS STRATEGY IS THE SINGLE<br />
MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORLD TODAY, YOU HAVE<br />
OUR ABIDING BEST WISHES IN YOUR IMMENSELY SIGNIFICANT<br />
ENDEAVOURS, </p>
<p>7.<br />
MAY I PROPOSE A TOAST TO THE HEALTH OF MY GOOD FRIEND<br />
PREMIER ZHAO, AND THE HEALTH OF OUR CHINESE AND<br />
AUSTRALIAN FRIENDS HERE, AND THE CONTINUED HEALTH OF<br />
CHINA-AUSTRALIA RELATIONS, GAN BEI. </p>
