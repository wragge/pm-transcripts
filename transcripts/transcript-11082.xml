<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Welcome to Lateline, Prime Minister, and congratulations on</p>
<p> the anniversary.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Three years on, is Australia what you want it to be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never give up the desire to make the country even better but I think</p>
<p> we've achieved a lot in the last three years but I want to achieve</p>
<p> a lot more over the next three. We've certainly given Australia</p>
<p> an economic strength that I don't think many people thought was</p>
<p> possible three years ago, and that's our proudest achievement.</p>
<p> We really have been able to stare down the worst of the Asian recession,</p>
<p> although we're not completely unaffected by it. The other things</p>
<p> I'm very proud of are that we have rebalanced our foreign policy</p>
<p> in a quite significant way. When I became Prime Minister we seemed</p>
<p> to be the anxious outsider knocking on the door of Asia trying to</p>
<p> win admission and we seemed to be tending to ignore the rest of the</p>
<p> world. I think we've turned from an ÂAsia only' policy</p>
<p> to an ÂAsia first' policy. And just as well we did because</p>
<p> the turn of events in that part of the world would have disappointed</p>
<p> us if we had been too obsessed with that region. I'm also very</p>
<p> pleased at the beginnings of the creation in this country of what</p>
<p> I call a social coalition between the Government, the business sector,</p>
<p> the welfare sector and individuals to tackle Australia's social</p>
<p> problems.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>What do you mean by that exactly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean that there are many problems in our country that the</p>
<p> Government alone can't solve, the welfare sector alone can't</p>
<p> solve, business alone can't solve, individuals can't, but</p>
<p> if we can coalesce, if we can work together with a common purpose</p>
<p> with each doing what it is best at - with the welfare sector doing</p>
<p> the nurturing and the hard-edged dealing at the sharp end in a way</p>
<p> that no other section of the community can. I was reminded of it today.</p>
<p> I met a lady from the St Vincent De Paul Society in Adelaide and she's</p>
<p> been, for 20 years, working with the underprivileged. She says when</p>
<p> she knocks on a door she's welcomed into any household. She said</p>
<p> often if somebody from the Government knocks on the door they're</p>
<p> looked at suspiciously. I think that summarises that those sorts of</p>
<p> organisations have a particular gift and a particular role which we</p>
<p> must support.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>We'll move on a little bit later to talk about those things but</p>
<p> first can we concentrate on the economy.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I say there's one other thing I'm also very proud of</p>
<p> and that is our achievement in getting national gun laws.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Can I concentrate on the economy for a moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I'd like to just throw a few figures at you if I can?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Business investment down more than 16%, the trade deficit at $1.38</p>
<p> billion in January, much worse than expected, exports to Asia down</p>
<p> 30% and the current account deficit at a record high today, is our</p>
<p> fireproofed economy starting to smoulder?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not. In dollar terms the current account's at a</p>
<p> record high but as a percentage of wealth it's not, it's</p>
<p> way below the record high. And our debt servicing ratio, that is the</p>
<p> percentage of our exports that is required to service our debt, is</p>
<p> below 10% and that's the lowest it's been for 15 years.</p>
<p> And that's a better measure of the capacity of our economy to</p>
<p> sustain a deficit. It is true that the last set of business investment</p>
<p> figures were down. It is also true that was from a very high base.</p>
<p> It's also true today that we had an unbelievable retail sales</p>
<p> figure of 5.2 and we have the lowest interest rates in 30 years, the</p>
<p> lowest inflation rate for more than 10 years or more. And all of the</p>
<p> indicators are, particularly the growth indicators, that we have been</p>
<p> performing well. But I've never said that nothing would ever</p>
<p> go wrong, you can't argue that. But if you draw a line through</p>
<p> the normal economic indicators the Australian economy is still performing</p>
<p> very strongly and we want to keep it that way but we have to work</p>
<p> at it.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Latest business investment figures, though, in particular must have</p>
<p> concerned you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I would rather they had been otherwise but I also know that</p>
<p> these things tend to seesaw somewhat. And whilst you should never</p>
<p> throw your hat in the air on the strength of one figure, you shouldn't</p>
<p> cut your throat on the strength of one either. And I think if you</p>
<p> look at the long trend, it's still very strong. But we can't</p>
<p> guarantee that Australia won't be touched in some way. All I</p>
<p> can report is that thus far we have survived better than anybody else,</p>
<p> better than anybody expected and, frankly, better than I expected</p>
<p> and I think anybody in my Government expected.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>When the Asian crisis hit we diverted, in this country, a lot of trade</p>
<p> to Europe but if there is a world-wide slowdown as it's expected,</p>
<p> and particularly in Europe, or even a recession, we're in some</p>
<p> trouble, aren't we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if the rest of the world falls in a heap obviously that is going</p>
<p> to affect us, of course it will. But, on the other hand, if we run</p>
<p> a strong domestic economy then the fact that a number of the key economies,</p>
<p> such as the United States, continue to perform strongly will mean</p>
<p> that we'll continue to do well. But there's no way that</p>
<p> if the rest of the world, the entire world, goes into recession Â</p>
<p> and there's no sign of that incidentally, no sign at all Â</p>
<p> of course we won't be unaffected but I don't expect that</p>
<p> to happen and I don't think many economists do either.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Does it worry you, though, the extent to which we appear to be reliant</p>
<p> at the present moment on the US economy and, indeed, on Wall Street</p>
<p> continuing its record highs?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is always the case, Tony, that the rest of the world relies</p>
<p> a lot on the strongest economy in the world. It's always been</p>
<p> thus. And the interesting thing is that Australia has remained so</p>
<p> strong where the strength of Japan has been fairly sluggish for a</p>
<p> number of years. We have a very strong domestic economy. We are helped</p>
<p> by the United States but the fact that we run a very intelligent,</p>
<p> flexible exchange rate policy has meant that we've been able</p>
<p> to diversify our exports away from Asia to cushion the impact of the</p>
<p> downturn there. So a lot of what has happened has been due to the</p>
<p> strength of the American economy but even more has been due to our</p>
<p> own economic fundamentals being much better and far sharper and more</p>
<p> flexible than they used to be.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>When our dollar came under pressure last year and it fell to 56 cents,</p>
<p> I think it was, the US economist, Paul Krugman, said our Reserve Bank</p>
<p> was told that resistance to hedge fund attacks is futile. The fact</p>
<p> is that as a middle-sized economy we can only really fireproof ourselves</p>
<p> to a certain extent, can't we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think you ought to look at what's happened. I think one</p>
<p> of the spectacular successes of Australian economic management over</p>
<p> the last three years has been the management of the exchange rate.</p>
<p> I think the Reserve Bank of Australia has done a superb job and its</p>
<p> Governor is one of the stars of the whole play.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Were you aware, though, of what was happening when those hedge funds</p>
<p> attacked our dollar?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Tony, as you could imagine as Prime Minister and the Treasurer</p>
<p> we keep in very regular contact with the monetary authorities but</p>
<p> you could also imagine we don't talk about those things and we</p>
<p> don't talk about the future path of monetary policy. One of the</p>
<p> good things about our economic management is that there is a significantly</p>
<p> greater level of independence in the conduct of monetary policy by</p>
<p> the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay, let's talk about the GST. The Democrats are adamant they</p>
<p> won't let a tax on food through. Your Treasurer says it's</p>
<p> all or nothing and that seems to leave you with only two options,</p>
<p> either ditch the package or call a double dissolution.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tony, the vote will be taken on or about the 25th of June.</p>
<p> And there's a lot of water to flow under the bridge. There are</p>
<p> a lot of Senate hearings and there are a lot of declarations to be</p>
<p> made by people between now and then. And I'm not going to start</p>
<p> hypothesising or speculating about what might happen if the Senate</p>
<p> behaves in a particular way. I remain hopeful that the Senate, as</p>
<p> currently constituted, will pass our package. Now, I can't guarantee</p>
<p> that. I ask those who control the numbers in the Senate to remember</p>
<p> the verdict of the Australian people on the 3rd of October,</p>
<p> to remember that no government has more explicitly sought a mandate</p>
<p> in more emphatic detail than we did on our tax reform package. We</p>
<p> couldn't have been more transparent, open and forthright with</p>
<p> the Australian people. And I do ask those who control the numbers</p>
<p> to bear that in mind. But I don't think you're going to</p>
<p> get a final reading on this for some months yet and it really is futile</p>
<p> of anybody, no disrespect or discourtesy intended, to try and sort</p>
<p> of prod me beyond that response.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>What options, though, are open to you? I mean, the double dissolution</p>
<p> is your final option, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tony, you've heard my answer.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So you're ruling out a double dissolution.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm repeating the answer I've just given.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I want to move on to another core issue, unemployment. Peter Costello's</p>
<p> target of 5%, is that achievable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we'd all like lower unemployment. He, incidentally, says</p>
<p> he wasn't particularly aiming for a specific target but he, like</p>
<p> myself and Peter Reith and all the members of the Government, want</p>
<p> a lower rate. I think it is possible to get a lower rate if we can</p>
<p> sustain growth, if we can remove some of the disincentives to re-entering</p>
<p> the workforce that exist in the welfare system at present. And the</p>
<p> taxation package, when passed, will help to do that. We need some</p>
<p> further deregulation of the labour market consistent with the Australian</p>
<p> tradition of a social safety net. I want to make it clear that we</p>
<p> are not a society that is going to walk away from a social safety</p>
<p> net, that's part of the Australian way. But I think consistent</p>
<p> with that there are some further things that can be done. Some of</p>
<p> them were canvassed in the now well documented letter from Mr Reith</p>
<p> to myself which listed a large number of things, some of which, of</p>
<p> course, we won't implement but others we'll certainly very</p>
<p> carefully consider. And I think it's very good that a Minister</p>
<p> newly appointed to the employment portfolio should get into the business</p>
<p> of policy formulation so quickly into his new job.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>There was another letter to you as well last October, an open letter</p>
<p> from five economists. They suggested that a wage freeze would generate</p>
<p> jobs growth and that tax credits would be needed therefore to compensate</p>
<p> low-income earners. Now, do you favour that sort of idea?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we're not disposed to do that. I think there are better</p>
<p> ways of responding to the problem, although one never wants to completely</p>
<p> dismiss all of the proposals put forward by a group like that. But</p>
<p> we certainly don't see any particular merit in relation to the</p>
<p> tax credit proposal because we have quite a comprehensive set of proposals</p>
<p> to reform the Australian taxation system that are going to help low</p>
<p> income earners and give people greater incentive to re-enter the workforce,</p>
<p> more so than proposed by those five economists.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Is there merit in freezing minimum wages?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think that's the problem. That is not the problem.</p>
<p> I mean, it is clear beyond argument that if you have a wages explosion</p>
<p> which is not built on productivity growth you're going to have</p>
<p> a ratcheting up of unemployment. But that is not our problem at the</p>
<p> present time. We don't have a wages explosion and we've</p>
<p> had a very big productivity gain. People in work are much better off</p>
<p> now than they were three years ago because their real wages have risen</p>
<p> and their interest rates have come down. And that's why a bloke</p>
<p> who's got a job is doing very well now but the people who haven't</p>
<p> got jobs, as always, are not doing as well and they are the group</p>
<p> of people that we must continue to address our concerns to.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>It sounds like, though, we can rule out that idea once and for all</p>
<p> - the wage freeze, tax credit trade-off, for example, is not going</p>
<p> to happen from what you're saying.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can only repeat what I've said. I mean, if you are, as</p>
<p> a government, trying to look at a whole range of options but equally</p>
<p> you're going to block off ones that you don't think will</p>
<p> work, well, you can only respond in the way that I have.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Unemployment has some social costs of course...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And you've assumed a moral leadership on the drugs issue but</p>
<p> do you think you can persuade all of the States to sign up to the</p>
<p> idea of zero tolerance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not necessarily seeking them to do it. I mean, I assume</p>
<p> they all agree that we afford zero tolerance to drug pushers and they</p>
<p> all agree that we afford zero tolerance to the use of drugs in schools.</p>
<p> They are the things that I've talked about in the language of</p>
<p> zero tolerance as far as drugs are concerned. I think you've</p>
<p> got to tackle the drug problem in three ways. You've got to have</p>
<p> tough law enforcement measures, and that means co-operation between</p>
<p> the Federal Government and the State police. You must have adequate</p>
<p> education and you must have a lot of resources put in to treatment</p>
<p> of people. And it's only in the last few months that the Federal</p>
<p> Government has started to get into that area and I think it has been</p>
<p> a neglected area in the past. And we're allocating about $120</p>
<p> million out of our Tough on Drugs strategy for education and treatment.</p>
<p> Now, they're the sorts of things that we need to pursue and to</p>
<p> persevere with. And when I talk about zero tolerance in drugs I talk</p>
<p> about it in those two areas. And, quite separately from that, anybody</p>
<p> who's interested in safety in our cities will be interested,</p>
<p> at least, in what has happened in other countries that have followed</p>
<p> zero tolerance policing methods. But in a way that is a separate,</p>
<p> although related, issue.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>It is, but do you favour zero tolerance policing methods as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I favour anything that makes our society safer for the ordinary</p>
<p> law abiding citizen providing it does not unreasonably hurt other</p>
<p> people. And I think any society that has lived through the sort of</p>
<p> things that the people in New York have lived through and then moved</p>
<p> to an era where their murder rate has fallen by more than 50 per cent</p>
<p> are going to be pretty impressed by the things that have brought that</p>
<p> about. Now, I don't think you can necessarily translate that</p>
<p> to Australia because to start with our crime rate is not as bad, nowhere</p>
<p> near as bad. But I think you have to keep a sense of proportion. The</p>
<p> average citizen wants secure homes, safe streets and protection against</p>
<p> random violence and random robbery and burglary. Now, we all have</p>
<p> a responsibility to try and produce the conditions that reduce those</p>
<p> things.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Why have you chosen this time to put yourself into the middle of this</p>
<p> debate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>On drugs? Well, I haven't particularly chosen this time. I am</p>
<p> responding to what I properly see as a continuing national problem</p>
<p> and the drug menace in Australia is quite real. It is not, as some</p>
<p> people say, completely out of control and I think it's an overly</p>
<p> emotional statement to say the country is awash with drugs. But it</p>
<p> is a mounting problem. It worries parents, it worries me both as a</p>
<p> citizen, a Prime Minister as well as a parent and I want to do what</p>
<p> I can in co-operation with Premiers of all political persuasions to</p>
<p> improve the situation. And I do see it as an area where the Prime</p>
<p> Minister of the country has a responsibility at a national level to</p>
<p> try and improve the situation.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Now, the heroin trials that you are so opposed to, they are technically</p>
<p> a matter for the States aren't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not really because my advice is that in order to conduct them</p>
<p> you would need to import into this country pharmaceutical grade heroin</p>
<p> and that would involve an amendment to the federal narcotics legislation.</p>
<p> And it would probably be technically in breach of one of our international</p>
<p> conventions, not that I am saying that that alone is a reason why</p>
<p> you shouldn't do it. We make our own decisions in the end about</p>
<p> what is right for Australia. But we are involved for that reason.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But you would stop a heroin trial going ahead on that basis would</p>
<p> you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We would not agree to nor would we sponsor the amendment of the legislation</p>
<p> to facilitate it and that is what I understand happened in relation</p>
<p> to the ACT. Now, that is the current advice that I have.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So you would stop Jeff Kennett going ahead with the heroin trial if</p>
<p> he chose to do that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is my understanding that in order to have one you need to</p>
<p> import the type of heroin of which I spoke and that at present is</p>
<p> prohibited by federal law and the Federal Government would need to</p>
<p> sponsor a change to the federal law.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Have you told him that you'd prevent him from going ahead with</p>
<p> a trial if he chose to have one?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he is aware from public comments that I have made over a long</p>
<p> period of time what my view is.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>If we could just talk about the trials themselves for a moment. Several</p>
<p> times you have pointed to the Swiss trials to point, to support your</p>
<p> position. But they clai</p>
