FOR PRESS P. M. No 51/ 1970<br />
SUSPENSION OF PARLIAMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Joh:: Gorton<br />
The House of Representatives tonight witne3sed the most<br />
shocking behaviour in the history o Parliamentary government in<br />
Australia. The Opposition, under the direction of Mx. Whitlam, resorted<br />
to planned disruption verging on riot, refused to obey the rulings of the<br />
Chair, refused to leave the service of the House when named, shouted,<br />
rose in a body to defy the Spea. ker, and prevented the business of<br />
Parliament from proceeding.<br />
They have served notice that they believe in mob violence,<br />
not in the role of the Parliament elected by the people, and in so doing,<br />
have struck at the very existence of Parliamentary rule, and have<br />
sought to prevent the Government from governing and the Parliament<br />
from functioning, by the use of force.<br />
I am sure that the Speaker of the House of Representatives<br />
cannot permit this behaviour to continue and will take all measures<br />
necessary to see that it does not.<br />
