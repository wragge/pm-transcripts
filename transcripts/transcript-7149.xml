PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 1 APRIL 1987<br />
NO EARLY EL. ECTION<br />
I have Gtcated consistently that I prefer the Parliament to<br />
run its f% 21 term.<br />
The leadegzhip vacuum and chaos within and between the<br />
opposition Parties, together with their imminent rejection<br />
of the Auo(.&gt; ralia Card legislation for a second time, have<br />
presented the option and may I say frankly, the temptation,<br />
of an earl~ y election.<br />
I am confident that Labor would win-an early election. I<br />
have decided, however, that the election will bo held<br />
towards tho end of this year or early next year.<br />
The Aus~ tralian people want continued strong leadership and a<br />
Government that will continua to guide them through<br />
difficult economic times into renewed prosperity. To have<br />
an early e"' ection may hava brought into question the<br />
Governmert reaolve to make the tough decisions needed to<br />
meet the economic challenge facing this country.<br />
Let me repeat the dimension of this challenge. Through<br />
paying dgautically lower prices for many of our exports the<br />
world haGi cut more than $ 6 billion off the nation's income;<br />
that is, wo are poorer to the tune of $ 1500 per Australian<br />
family. As a nation we have no responsible alternative to<br />
adjusting to that reality.<br />
I want to tell the Australian people that we will not shirk<br />
our responsibilities in making the unpalatable, though<br />
necessary economic decisions: the May Statement will be<br />
tough but fair.<br />
The Australian people overwhelmingly reject the deceptive<br />
voodoo economics being espoused by the Opposition Partiesbigger<br />
handouts, bigger deficits; that is, a certain recipe<br />
for higheg interest rates, higher inflation, massive<br />
increases in unemployment total economic disaster.<br />
when the opposition Parties reject the Australia Card<br />
legislation in the Senate later this week, they will stand<br />
condemned lay the Australian people for denying to the nation<br />
this fundamental instrument for dealing decisively with tax<br />
cheats and welfare frauds. This denial of more than $ 800m a<br />
year to the public purse from those who should be paying is<br />
simply a continuation of the traditional<br />
toward/ Sinclair/ iBjclke Petersen philosophy protect the<br />
privileged and increase the burden on the great honest<br />
majority of the Australian people. </p>
