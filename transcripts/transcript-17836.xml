A new Prisoner of War (POW) Recognition Supplement will provide former POWs with an extra $500 per fortnight in recognition of their special service and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the payment acknowledges the severe hardship suffered by our former POWs.</p>
<p>POWs were particularly subjected to horrific conditions and many returned home with physical and psychological scars that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>The Minister for Veteran's Affairs Warren Snowdon said the new payment was an important initiative to show our gratitude and respect to these worthy Australians.</p>
<p>“We have all seen the footage and heard the stories of our diggers in POW camps.</p>
<p>“The way they looked out for their mates while in these camps reflects the Aussie spirit we are all so proud of,” Mr Snowdon said.</p>
<p>Twenty-one former POWs from the Second World War and Korean War joined the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veteran's affairs at Kirribilli House for the announcement.</p>
<p>The new supplement will apply from September 2011 and is in addition to current benefits available to former POWs.</p>
<p>The measure will be funded in the 2011-12 Federal Budget and will cost $27.2 million over the next four years. </p>
