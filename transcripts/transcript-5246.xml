QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOWING ADDRESS TO BUSINESSMEN'S<br />
LUNCHEON LOS ANGELES<br />
Question I would appear, Mr. Prime Minister, that one of the driving<br />
:: forces in the United States' economy towards inflation might be<br />
the defence spending. What share of your Budget is going into<br />
defence spending, and do you think that is going to be moving?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I believe that defence spending will increase in Australia.<br />
Traditionally, we have kept pretty small forces. A great deal<br />
of defence expenditure f inds its way to the United States, because<br />
of much of the sophisticated equipment that we purchase comes<br />
from your country. But, the proportion of GDP that we spend on<br />
defence would be significantly less than the United States.<br />
We have already called for a review by our own defence people<br />
of their strategic assessment, and for a review of their defence<br />
programmes. I hope both those reviews will be ready to be put<br />
in my hands when I get back to Australia in about two weeks.<br />
Question Prime Minister, what is the reaction of the people of Australia<br />
to your announcement that you would join with the United States<br />
in the boycott of the Olympics in MoscQw?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I believe general support. Your Olympic Committee has gone<br />
further than ours. Ours has committed itself to putting the<br />
Government's views to the International Olympic Committee.<br />
They have kept their final options open at this stage. But<br />
the Government's view is almost identical to that of the<br />
United States Government. Having stated that position, I would<br />
hope that it will be seen that an effective boycott of the<br />
Olympic Games in Moscow might well be the strongest weapon any<br />
of us have in demonstrating to the Soviet Union the depth of<br />
our concern and the depth of our opposition to what they have<br />
done in Afhganistan, because there is not the slightest doubt<br />
that the Soviets want the Olympic Games in Moscow to be a great<br />
public relations operation for their own people athletes from<br />
all the countries of the world going to Moscow virtually paying<br />
homage to the Soviet Union by their presence, competing, and as<br />
the Soviets would want, being defeated in the Soviet Union; to<br />
have a great domestic success. Now, a number of things, trade<br />
sanctions and all the rest, can be hidden their effects can<br />
be hidden from the Soviet people. If there are a large number<br />
of countries that do not go to the Olympic Games, the effects<br />
of that cannot be hidden from the Soviet people. There would be<br />
a wondering why, a questioning. Our people, who have watched and<br />
examined, advisers on Soviet affairs, believe that an effective<br />
boycott of the Olympic Games would bring home the view of / 2 </p>
<p>Q/ A FOLLOWING BUSINESSMEN'S LUNCHEON<br />
-2-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
independent states and nations about Afghanistan, bring<br />
that view home to the Soviet people, more strongly and more<br />
forcefully than almost any other non-warlike act that it would<br />
be possible to take.<br />
-Question<br />
Prime Minister, recent decades have seen a tremendous build-up<br />
of the trading partnership with Japan. Do you foresee a similar<br />
development with Mainland China in decades to come?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. I * think it might be slower. Are you talking about between<br />
Australia and Japan?<br />
. Question<br />
Yes. Prime Minister<br />
We, obviously, will be seeking every opportunity to trade<br />
with China, but there is a very the Japanese and Australia<br />
economies, they are complementary. We both have something that<br />
the other needs, so a rapid growth in trade and relationships<br />
between Japan and Australia was prompted and promoted by the<br />
economic relationship which grew very r~ aturally. I think there<br />
will be great opportunities to trade with China, and I hope<br />
trade both ways. But at the moment, for example, it is much more<br />
one way. There are some things that we sell to China, very little<br />
at the moment that they produce that we need. In some things they<br />
produce they want to compete with a number of others, and are<br />
pretty effective in the business. I believe the opportunities<br />
are there. The practical effect of increased trade will be seen<br />
in coming years. But I doubt if it would be as great as the<br />
growth with Japan.<br />
Question Prime Minister, is there any possibility of the Federal<br />
Government building a studio, for the production and the<br />
benefit of the various States, in the production of feature<br />
films in Australia, and incorporating into that studio operation<br />
the amount of money that is presently spent on the school, the<br />
motion picture school, that is presently operating there?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have not heard that suggestion put forward. The film industry<br />
seems to be moving ahead quite rapidly in Australia. There have<br />
been not only some domestic successes, but international successes<br />
over recent years. For a long while that did not happen in<br />
Australian production. We have also done one or two things to<br />
give the Government Broadcasting Corporation a greater stimulus </p>
<p>. Q/ A BUSINESSMEN'S LUNCHEON -3-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
to get out and produce and to sell by allowing them to keep<br />
the profits of what they produce and sell. Before the Treasury<br />
used to grab it back. So I hope that they will be doing a bit<br />
more. But I had not heard of the suggestion that we should<br />
the Government should build a studio. I think government<br />
should only be a thing that private enterprise or other people<br />
cannot do.<br />
Question I don't private enterprise can do it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. But I make the point the film industry has been highly<br />
successful at the moment, with the facilities and arrangements<br />
that do exist.<br />
Question Prime Minister, ( inaudible) the economy in which the Australian<br />
Government welcomes investment and are there any problems in<br />
connection with the repatriation of profits ( inaudible)..<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
No, and we expect people to make profits. You do not invest<br />
unless you do. In Australia, profits i's an honourable term.<br />
We like people to make prof its. The major overseas investment<br />
has been in the resource industries or manufacturing. But<br />
there are a number of construction firms, or service-based<br />
industries that have also got significant overseas investment.<br />
There is one area -that can become sensitive, and that is<br />
in the investment of land, f arming land, and I think you would<br />
understand that. There are some rules which determine the basis<br />
of foreign investment. In the major resource projects we try and<br />
get 50 per cent Australian partnership in an operation. But if<br />
an overseas corporation wants to do something and cannot get an<br />
Australian partner and can demonstrate that quite clearly, they<br />
will still get approval to go ahead. It is a pretty flexible<br />
policy and one that is quite deliberately designed to encourage<br />
overseas investment in Australia. If you make profits, well,<br />
subject to paying our normal taxes which are the same as any<br />
other corporation has to pay. Well, they are yours to determine<br />
what you do with.<br />
Question Prime Minister, would it be proper to ask about the impact of<br />
Prime Minister Thatcher's Government on the relations with<br />
Australia, with all the changes that are being wrought?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think Prime Minister Thatcher has a tremendous task ahead<br />
of her, which I think she is tackling boldly and with a good </p>
<p>Q/ A BUSINESSMEN'S LUNCHEON<br />
I -4-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
deal of vigour. It is going to be a long haul, because there<br />
are many things that had to be put right, but I know this is<br />
understood in the United Kingdom. As far as I am concerned,<br />
all praise to Margaret Thatcher for what she is doing. I think<br />
a lot of Australians would see it that way also.<br />
Question Prime Minister, the other day I read a speech by your Deputy<br />
Prime Minister, I think it was given in San Francisco recently,<br />
in which he commented at some length upon the concern about<br />
growing protectionism in the United States. I wonder is this<br />
something that is especially noted in Australia, and would<br />
you comment on the general subject of protectionism as you<br />
see it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
In general terms, protection is an evil, but we have to face<br />
that we live in a world where all countries, to a greater * or<br />
lesser extent, practice protectionism. There have been times<br />
in the past where some United States actions have damaged<br />
Australian industries by quantitive restrictions. This is<br />
largely in the primary industry field, although restrictions<br />
have been placed in the past on lead and zinc. I think going<br />
back to the Eisenhower regime there were limits for bans.<br />
When my colleague Doug Anthony was talking about that sort of<br />
thing, he would also I suppose * be having in mind the trade<br />
balance, which is two to one in the United States' favour.<br />
We do not look for people to have a balanced trade balance because<br />
that is just not possible. We have a favourable<br />
balance with Japan for example. The quantitive restrictions<br />
on major bulk commodities and whatever have sometimes inhibited<br />
expansion of trade between Australia and the United States.<br />
I think we made good progress in the MTN so far as the<br />
bilateral relationship was concerned. Access for meat and for<br />
wool and for some other commodities was significantly improved.<br />
I think we made real progress in that area. Our people have,<br />
for a long while, wondered about the rationale of a tariff on<br />
raw wool. The United States was the only country in the world<br />
that had it, and all we could see happening from that was the<br />
wool industry in the United States being damaged, as well as our<br />
own. Under the new arrangementsc, that is going to be very<br />
significantly reduced. Significant progress has been made.<br />
We also of course, have got elements of protection and we are<br />
accused also of sometimes being too protectionist in Australia.<br />
I do not think we are when you take into account the fact that<br />
Australia uses tariffs, sometimes quantitive restrictions but<br />
not very often. We have particular access for the goods from<br />
developing countries. Exports from the ASEAN group have been<br />
growing into our market by over 30 per cent . a year for nearly<br />
years. We import large quantities of textile, apparel and<br />
footwear from developing countriJes. Some manufactured goods<br />
from developing countries. When you look at the sort of<br />
protective devices that Australia pursues and then look at the<br />
protective devices in Europe, well, we are very much novices </p>
<p>Q/ A BUSINESSMEN'S LUNCHEON<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
and learners in the game. I do not know that we want to<br />
become as expert as the Europeans. We would hope that they<br />
might diminish some of their elements of protection. They<br />
spend $ 25 billion a year in wage subsidy and export subsidy.<br />
They are all protective devices, just as much as a tariff.<br />
They have levies and quantitive restrictions and quotas and<br />
labelling devices, and health regulations and all sort of things.<br />
That does inhibit the opportunity for trade. Indeed, much of<br />
our trade with Europe well, it has fallen very greatly over<br />
the last ten years with Britain going into the Common Market<br />
as a result of these devices. If it was not for a standard<br />
trade with Japan and Korea and Taiwan and Hong Kong and South East<br />
Asia, Australia would have been in very real difficulty. But<br />
we have made up for it with a trade offensive in other areas.<br />
Protection is bad. I think we have all got to work at lowering<br />
it. We have also got to face the reality of the domestic<br />
economy sometime which, in a protected world, make some elements<br />
of protection inevitable. No one country I think can afford<br />
a sudden inflow of no protection. A country our size could not.<br />
You can make judgement for the United States.<br />
