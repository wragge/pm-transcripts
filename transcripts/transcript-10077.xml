21 August 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW ON THE AM PROGRAMME<br />
WITH FRAN KELLY, ABC RADIO<br />
] KELLY:<br />
John Howard, the Daily Telegraph spells A Fair Go, in fact it shouts A Fair Go this<br />
morning. Does that spell success for this budget?<br />
] PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it spells truth and it does, I hope spell success and acceptance because it is a fair<br />
go budget. It does the economic job that we were required to do. it gets rid of the<br />
huge liability on the national bankcard that we were left by the formner government but<br />
importantly, it does it in a way that delivers on the great bulk of promises we took to<br />
the last election, particularly in the famifly area and the health insurance area, the capital<br />
gains tax area, small business, and we have kept intact, as we promised we would, the<br />
social security safety net for the less privileged in the community, and it also does it<br />
importantly in a way where the pain is spread around. I mean, better oft' people who<br />
can really afford to do so are being asked via the increase in the superannuation<br />
contributions tax, for high income earners to make their contribution. We're also<br />
saying to high income earners who don't take out private health insurance, if you<br />
continue to refuase to take out private health insurance you can make the contribution<br />
towards strengthening and improving and deepening the fairness of the Medicare<br />
system by paying a surcharge.<br />
So I'm very proud of this budget. It's a budget that reflects the values and the<br />
commitment to the mainstream of the Australian community of the new Government<br />
and I congratulate Peter Costello as Treasurer on the fine job he did of getting the<br />
budget together and delivering it so well last night. </p>
<p>Fax froim 21/ 08/ 96 10: 28 Pg: 2<br />
KELLY: I'l come to some of those specifics you talked about a bit later on but let's talk about<br />
how fair it is. As you say, it does slug the wealthy to some degree, and perhaps an<br />
unexpected degree, but welfare groups this morning are estimating that roughly<br />
of the massive cuts in this budget and the cuts are bigger than the Fightback cuts, the<br />
cuts announced last night, they say that more than 30% of those cuts will be borne by<br />
the poor. Is that a fair budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I just say firstly that they're not bigger than the Fightback cuts. You are looking<br />
at 10 billion of cuts with Fightback.<br />
KELLY:<br />
Isn't this $ 13 billion worth of cuts?<br />
PRIM MINISTEX:<br />
Well we can argue about... this is the problem. Are you talking about one year or over<br />
a number of years? This is the problem. I mean, we've now got into this jargon and<br />
everything is multiplied by three or four, and when you use a one year figure, it<br />
sounds.... KELLY: Is it $ 19 billion over four years, is that the figure?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
My understanding is that this is nothing like the scale of the Fightback cuts, but<br />
anyway, that's a bit academic. The question is, how fair is it. We have certainly saved<br />
money in the labour market program area. I make no bones about that. We believe<br />
that many of those programs were wasteful. The former government's own interdepartmental<br />
taskforce reached the same conclusion. Some programs were returning<br />
seven and eight people back onto the unemployment queues after having passed<br />
through training programs after only a few weeks, or in some cases, a few months.<br />
We are changing that. We are not getting rid of all of the former government's<br />
programs. We are reducing the number of programs down from 28 to about four. We<br />
are going to introduce a new, simplified system of training and apprenticeships. There<br />
will be more apprenticeships under the Howard Government. There will be a training<br />
system attuned to job outcomes and there will be a job placement system which will<br />
involve the substantial privatisation of the Commonwealth Employment Service<br />
process. We will be encouraging people through the use of incentives to find jobs for<br />
people who are out of work. If you provide people in the Australian community with<br />
an incentive you are more likely to get a result. </p>
<p>Fax from What we are doing for the first time in this area is starting to reverse the incentives. If<br />
you give people an incentive to behave in a particular way, they will respond to it. To<br />
a too great an extent in the past, the labour market area and the welfare system in this<br />
country has had some of the incentives the wrong way around and by turning them<br />
around, I believe that we are going to get much better outcomes.<br />
KELLY: All right. By turning them around you may get better outcomes and yet in terms of<br />
unemployment, which most people would agree is the biggest social and economic<br />
problem for this country at this moment, your budget, for all its cuts, for all its<br />
changes, for all the turning around that it does, is doing little to shift the unemployment<br />
level at the end of the first year, I mean staying around the same amount of Is that<br />
good enough?<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
No. No it's not. Of course it's not, Fran and it is true that the fall that we forecast is<br />
very modest. I have two comments on that. Firstly, you don't get rapid improvement<br />
in six or twelve months in an area like unemployment, and secondly and crucially, we<br />
won't get real movement on unemployment until we get small business booming. And<br />
we won't....<br />
KELLY: But Mr Howard, this budget according to your forecasts, we won't get real movement<br />
for four years, will we with growth at three and a half?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just let me finish. You won't get unemployment really falling in<br />
this country until you get small business taking up the slack and to do that, to achieve<br />
that, you've got to get certain things of the back of small business. You've got to give<br />
them a decent industrial relations system which we are desperately trying to do, and if<br />
the Senate passes our law, I hope by the end of the year and it's in operation from the<br />
first of January nex year, we will not only be rid of the unfair dismissal law but we will<br />
have a far less burdensme industriAl relations system. We have delivered on our<br />
capital gaius tax promise. We have cut the provisional tax. I will have the report of<br />
the BeU Committee in a couple of months on cutting paper work by 50% in the first<br />
three years. So as those benefits flow through to small business, which I regarded in<br />
the election campaign, you'd have heard me say it, now I say again, it's the hope of the<br />
side on unemployment. I really do believe that a driven small business sector in<br />
Australia can provide the long sought-after breakthrough in unemployment. it's not<br />
going to come anywhere else and that is why we are so committed to improving the<br />
climate for smail business.<br />
KELLY: Does that mean then that the growth forecast in this budget is predicted to three and a<br />
Fa rom21/ 08/ 96 10: 28 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from : 21/ 08/ 96 10: 28 Pg: 4<br />
half percent basically for the next four years, which is not enough really to bring down<br />
the unemployment levels, does that mean those forecasts will be adjusted as small<br />
business comes on line?<br />
PRJ( ME MINISTER:<br />
Well if the independent, economic data justify the adjustment of forecasts, I mean we<br />
don't politically adjust them in the Prime Minister's office, as occurred with One<br />
Nation.--KELLY: No but I mean you must be expecting something. I mean, three and a half percent<br />
won't bring down unemployment, will it?<br />
PRIME MINIUSTER:<br />
No, three and a half percent is not high enough but all you can do when you're putting<br />
together a budget is to make the best projection on the basis of what current policies<br />
have produced in the economy. As our new policies come onstreamn and have the<br />
beneficial effects, you can then start to make some adjustments.<br />
] KELLY:<br />
It does make 5% unemployment target by the end of the decade look like a dream<br />
though, doesn't it?<br />
PRIMIE NMNITER:<br />
I have always been very wary about specific targets of that kind. My promise to the<br />
Australian people is to try and deliver the lowest possible unemployment level,<br />
particularly in the area of youth unemployment. I am not identifying a particular<br />
target. I saw the former government do that and the whole thing be treated as a bit of<br />
a joke. My promise is to do all I can to reduce unemployment and to direct the<br />
resources and the energies and the skills of this new government towards that end and<br />
I am particularly committed to doing it via a resurgence in the small business sector.<br />
HELLY: Let's talk about promiAses if we can, Prime Minister. You promised in the election to<br />
maintain spending on labour market programs yet you've slashed $ 1.8 billion. You<br />
promised to maintain spending to universities, to the ABC. You promised not to<br />
increase taxes and yet some people will pay a higher Medicare levy and a higher tax on<br />
superannuation after this budget. There's many more promises that have been broken<br />
in last night's budget. How do you justify that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Let me take some of those. To start with, to say that we have broken the promise on </p>
<p>Fax from 21/ 08/ 96 10: 28 Pg:<br />
tax is ridiculous. We haven't increased income tax, saes tax, petrol excise. We are<br />
putting an optional surcharge on the Medicare levy for...<br />
ELLY:<br />
That's not an increased tax, the Medicare levy is not a tax?<br />
PRIM1E MINISTER:<br />
For people... look, it's purely optional. If you take out private health insurance, you<br />
don't have to pay it, and it is an extremely good policy change. Everybody recognises<br />
that it is a goad policy change to say to people who are on high incomes, if you really<br />
believe in the Medicare system, it is essential that it be underpinned by a thriving and<br />
expanding private insurance system, take out a bit of extra insurance. I mean, people<br />
following that election campaign,, what did they remember, what did they really<br />
associate with me as far as promises are concerned? The family tax package<br />
delivered in full, delivered in fifll. The private health insurance rebate delivered in<br />
fulil, in fact a little more generous because the income test is more generous. It went<br />
from 65 to 70 000. The Capital Gains Tax reduction on small business delivered in<br />
fuill. The commitment to maintain Medicare, community rating and bulk-billing<br />
delivered in full. The commitment to ACOSS to maintain the twice yearly indexation<br />
of pensions, to maintain the social security safety net delivered in fuill. It is true in<br />
some areas there have been deferrals, given that the state of the economy that we<br />
inherited. Oh and another one that we delivered<br />
KELLY: Not just the do you concede that some things<br />
PREME M1iNISTER:<br />
Another one that we delivered in full I forgot, and that is the commitment to selffunded<br />
retirees to increase in two stages the tax free threshold for those older retired<br />
Australians so that they are treated equally with people in the same age grouping. So<br />
you are looking at a situation where overwhelmingly the main commitments of the<br />
Government have been delivered and I'm very proud of that. I mean, even in areas,<br />
look at the Superannuation area. We promised to lil the threshold for low income<br />
earners the Superannuation Guarantee levy. That's been delivered in fu~ ll. We<br />
promised that if a person worked all of his life and retired on the proceeds of the sale<br />
of business they'd have a capital gains tax exemption up to half a million dollars.<br />
We've delivered on that in full. The spouses at home superannuation contributions can<br />
now be paid by her husband or wife and get an 18% tax deduction another promise<br />
delivered in full.<br />
KELLY: So you don't accept that because you haven't been able to or have chosen not to<br />
deliver some things in ful1, or deliver some things as promised, you don't accept that </p>
<p>Fax fr* om you've broken your word, made during the election that you would deliver on your<br />
promises, even at the cost of the bottom line?<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
I have every confidence that this Budget will in its aggregate be seen as a budget that<br />
delivers on the great bulk of the commitments that we made to the Australian people at<br />
the last election. The Australian people will understand that because of the<br />
circumstances that we inherited that the delivery of every single commitment was<br />
difficult, but they will respect and I believe applaud the fact that the core commitments<br />
of the Government have been delivered. They have been delivered to famnilies, they<br />
have been delivered to small business and we have delivered importantly, because I<br />
believe in a fair Australian community, they have been delivered in the areas of<br />
maintaining the social security safety net. I mean one thing you can say about politics<br />
in Australia now is that the debate about whether or not we should have a decent<br />
social security safety net is well and truly over. Nobody, on either side of politics<br />
disputes that. I certainly don't. I will never support any attempt by my side of politics<br />
to hack away the basic social security safety net. I'll support measures to prevent<br />
fraud. Our message is that people who are entitled to support ought to get it, but<br />
those people who aren't entitled to support that are trying to help themselves to it<br />
oughtn't to get it and our message to people who are trying to rort the tax avoidance<br />
system is that they won't get any sympathy or any kind of understanding from us. We<br />
do want a fair Australia and part of a fair Australia is to have a social security safety<br />
net which is not the subject of a three yearly put and take whenever there is an election<br />
campaign. ] KELLY:<br />
Well, let's look at two of the groups. Families, as you've mentioned a number of<br />
times, a central promise that you made during the election, delivered in full. You say<br />
your family tax package is a plus for families. Under your family tax package though,<br />
a two income family with both people earning around $ 30 000, they're not big income<br />
earners with two dependent children, will be $ 7.70 better off a week from your tax<br />
break. Now, is that going to buffer them from the increased cost of childcare, the<br />
medical costs, pharmaceutical benefits, the cost of university later in life, that also<br />
comes with this budget.<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well, an enormous amount of those people's child care costs won't change because the<br />
child cash care rebate for example...<br />
KcELLY: I'm talking about the operational costs to community childcare, won't that make an<br />
impact? PRiM MNIS1ER: Farxf t21/ 08/ 96 18: 28 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>Fax from I'm sorry, a very large number of those people, in fact far more of those people use<br />
family day care than use Family day care centres are completely unaffected by the<br />
operational subsidy.<br />
KELLY: But aren't community childcare with two working parents in many cases.<br />
PRIE MIU41STER:<br />
But a lot of those Fran, you should have a look at the profile of a lot of those and a lot<br />
of those now have people who are quite high income earners in some of the inner city<br />
areas. The profile of childcare centres have changed quite dramatically. There's an<br />
enormous growth in the family day care centre and what was happening with the<br />
operational subsidy was it was giving an unfair competitive advantage to the<br />
community based systems over the private ones and in many cases the fee differentials<br />
were not very great at all.<br />
KELLY: Okay, another group. Older Australians. Under this Budget people in nursing homes<br />
or about to enter nursing homes...<br />
PRIME NISTER:<br />
Well not people in nursing homes, the changes are grandfathered...<br />
KELLY: Sorry, okay, people about to enter..,<br />
PIM MINSTER:<br />
Well it's a very very important thing. I mean we are not altering the goal posts for<br />
people who are already there.<br />
KELLY: Okay, people moving into nursing homes over the next three years will be means<br />
tested, they'll pay $ 26 000 1 think it is for the privilege if you like of being admitted.<br />
Do you think older Australians were reckoning on that when they voted for you in<br />
March? PPIME MINISTER:<br />
I think older Australians will understand that if you have that kind of requirement for<br />
people going into hostels, it's not unreasonable to have that kind of requirement for<br />
people going into nursing homes. What's got to be understood about nursing homes is<br />
that there is an absolute starvation of capital resources going into nursing homes and<br />
Faoxm 21/ 08/ 96 10: 28 Pg: 7 </p>
<p>Fax from 21/ 08/ 96 10: 28 Pg: 8<br />
unless we can open up a new stream of capital for nursing homes, the quality of the<br />
buildings, the quality of the amenities and the whole quality of the nursing home<br />
industry is going to decline and I think you will find that a lot of people, including in<br />
the welfare sector who operate nursing homes will see the sense of this decision. I<br />
mean3f, all you are doing is allowing a person who now has to make an upfront<br />
contribution if he or she goes into a hostel, you are putting that person in the same<br />
situation if they are going into a nursing home. You have the ludicrous position now<br />
that some people go into a hostel which is co-located with a nursing home and when<br />
they have to go from the hostel to the nursing home the deposit that's been paid to the<br />
hostel has to be refunded even though they are just going from one side of the road or<br />
one part of the complexc to the other and that really is ridiculous and it just ignores the<br />
expense and the operational difficulties of nursing homes.<br />
KELLY:<br />
Finally Prime Minister, the change in the Senate yesterday, Queensland Labor Senator<br />
Mal Colston resigning from the Labor Party now sitting in the Senate as an<br />
independent. Is that a gift for you at a time when you are trying to get a tough budget<br />
through the Senate?<br />
PPIME WMSTER:<br />
Well I think the situation in the Senate is better now than it was last Friday, let me put<br />
it that way. Mal Colston decided to resign from the Labor Party, you can speak to him<br />
yourself. I welcome the fact that he did say, yesterday when he resigned from the<br />
Australian Labor Party he did say that although he was a life long Labor man and I<br />
respect that, there were certain electoral mandates that the Howard Government had<br />
received and the implication was that he would respect that. Now, if that means that<br />
he is more likely now to vote for certain things, then I welcome that, but we'll have to<br />
wait and see.<br />
KELLY: But it has put a smile on your face hasn't it?<br />
PREME AMSTER:<br />
Well, I'm not unhappy. I'm not unhappy at all and the other thing that's put a smile on<br />
my face is the fact that this Budget is being seen by middle Australia as fair, as<br />
delivering on the commitments we made and is essentially keeping faith with the great<br />
mainstream of the Australian community and I'm very happy about that.<br />
] KELLY:<br />
Prime Minister thank you. </p>
