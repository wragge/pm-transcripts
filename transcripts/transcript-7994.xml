TRRNGCRIPT OF IX?! RVIEW WITH IR3L RICHKRDS, " OFPIG PROGRAM,<br />
ABC, ) 43LBOURNE, 23/ 3/ 00.<br />
3&amp; 310 PROOF ONLY<br />
KRI We have people from around Australia who will talk to you<br />
but a lot of their questions have had to be pro-recorded because<br />
of the difference in time zones, we'll go to some of those first.<br />
While people are calling, if I can start with a question. The<br />
economic downturn recorded in the negative growth figures<br />
released this week. That sconomio downturn in Australia, doss it<br />
make families hurt?<br />
PM Essentially what it means is that Australian families are<br />
going to now got the certainty of lower interest rates. What<br />
we'Iv, had to do Kol was to slow the economay down somewhat because<br />
we were sucking in too many imports and I think all your<br />
listeners understand that. Fortunately now we've got consumption<br />
and production back into kilter which means that with certainty<br />
we can gay that once we're elected then interest rates will comes<br />
down and that means a significant help to Australian families.<br />
KR: Are there wash-ups in other areas. I mean whit* this<br />
machinery will bring downl interest rates, will it for example<br />
cause more bread-winners in Australian families to be unemployed?<br />
PH: No, what we will. know the Listeners don't like<br />
economic jargon, x don't like it if I can avoid it, but the<br />
jargon in we'll get a soft landing and that's the assessment<br />
generally of the economics profession. That we've had to slow<br />
things down but we'll continue to have growth and we'll continue<br />
to have employment growth. Z think we won't havo, we cant<br />
expect to maintain the momentum of employment growth in the<br />
immediate future, the same degree of growth. I mean what we've<br />
had in this period we've been in office Kel, is just fantastic.<br />
We'Vie had employment growth at twice the rats of the rest of the<br />
world and five times faster the r~ te of job creation that existed<br />
under our: predecessors. Now in the immediate future# the rate of<br />
employment growth will not be as high I think as before. We'll<br />
probably have some fall in the participation rate, that's the<br />
number of people wanting to work. There's* very interesting<br />
statistics Kelf which I've used for the campaign and which 1<br />
44./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
think has interested people and r think would interest your<br />
listener@ very much# and that is, with the great economic growth<br />
that we ' ve had under my covernmelto more people have decided that<br />
they want to work# so that the participation rate hot increased.<br />
If we had the same participation rate now a~ when we came to<br />
office# the unemployment rate would be jis : veo n. percent.<br />
KI Right. A lot of those extra people who've decided they want<br />
to work of course are spouses who may not have worked it interest<br />
rates weren't quite as high to they are though.<br />
PHI Rol, there are some, I accept that. There are some woman in<br />
Australia who have made the decision to work because ot economic<br />
circumutances they feel they need to* but what we've got to<br />
understand is that what we've witnessed in Australia, as is<br />
happening In the rest of the world, is that m&amp; ay more woenn are<br />
making the decision that as well as getting the satisfaction that<br />
* they get, and the great satisfaction ou of being wives and<br />
mothers and the satisfaction of that domestic environment, more<br />
and more women are also making the decision that they wish to be<br />
as well, members of the workforce. And me what we've had in this<br />
period since we've been in office# with this growth of 1.6<br />
million new jobs which is unprecedented, the majority of those<br />
have been women, but with many of them wanting to do that as an<br />
act of fulfillment. Now our attitude is this, that for those<br />
women who want to get their complete fulfillment Rel, from<br />
remaining in the home as wife and mother, that's a judgement that<br />
we applaud and that we've tried to assist by the massive<br />
Increases in education payments to wee that their children geat<br />
better educated, the greater provision of ahildcare places, so<br />
that even although they're not working there are places for them<br />
to put their children it they want to go out and do other things<br />
in a non-working environment. but for those who do want to go<br />
and work, to be ' part of their fulfilment, we've brought in<br />
affirmative action, and the women'a movement acknowledges this,<br />
we'Ive done more than has ever been done before to open up the<br />
avenues of employment for women and for the future which is, I<br />
* believe, skost Important. Thu most fundamental thing that we're<br />
doing is to reform the education system so that there won't be a<br />
projudice in the education system which has meant historically<br />
that girls tend to be streamed into a limited range of<br />
opportunities. Under the changes in, the education system that<br />
we'rge making, girl. going into the education system are going to<br />
have open to them the same range of occupations and vocations<br />
that are open to boys# and that's the way it should boo both in<br />
toemsf equity, Rel, and also In terms of economic good sense. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
R. Yes, I've got a thirteen year old daughter who's doing well<br />
in Maths and science and I appreciate that.<br />
PM Well that's beaut isn't it.<br />
KRs Yes, that's important. Listen, I Must Stop asking<br />
questions, but the temptation to ask just one more Lu too great.<br />
In order to reognise the work of the woomen who do stay at homer<br />
would you and your advisers ever consider counting their work,<br />
their own paid domestic work, which is very productive but<br />
doesn't produce cash as part of our GDP, because it could be an<br />
important recognition~ or what they're doing.<br />
PHI I think that that would be a synthetic confection of<br />
recognition, I mean it'. the sort of thing that might appeal to<br />
some politicians who've done nothing in concrete terms. Wt'<br />
much more important to do as my Government has done# to recognise<br />
the significance of the home and to make the decisions, the<br />
tough, hard decisions which are of value to the woman. And if I<br />
could say So# my judgement in that the best single thing that<br />
the Government can have done, and which we'll continue to do# is<br />
in the field of education. There is nothing more important to<br />
the woman than that she has the knowledge tnat her Child is going<br />
to have an equal opportunity to have his or her talent@ fully<br />
developed in the education system. When I came to office, Kel,<br />
after seven years of conservative government, I inherited the<br />
obscenity, nothing loe than that, of a pattern of privilege in<br />
education. After seven years the conservati~ ves had lifted the<br />
retention rate in the education system by a miserable two<br />
percentage pointe, from thirty four percent to thirty ciX<br />
perce. nt . Now that simply meant that they walked out of office,<br />
having virtually not lifted the retention rate at all# and<br />
leaving an Australia with one of the worst retention rate figures<br />
in eduvation in the whole of the world. only one in three of our<br />
kids Stayed on in the education system which meant, I can tell<br />
you, that predominantly that was the kids of the well-to-do. Now<br />
the kids of the rich and the well-to-do have every right to stay<br />
on in education, of course they do# but they have no more right<br />
than the kids that come from lower income or middle income homes.<br />
Pow what love done with my colleagues is to shift that from one<br />
in three to two in three# so I removed that pattern~ of<br />
privilege in educational opportunity and we've done that<br />
deliberately by more than doubling the secondary education<br />
alloyjnces to low to middle income families, trebling Au~ tudy<br />
places. Bo that now we have an Australia where that pattern of<br />
privilege on the education map has' been removed, and kids fromn<br />
all families, if they want to and their parents want them to, are<br />
e o a o / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
stayLng on in school and we're providing infinitely more places<br />
in ThP and in the university mystem. Now doing those things,<br />
doing those things Roe is much more important than some<br />
statistical confection about writing in what truly is important<br />
work, nothing I'm saying wants to underwrite in any way or<br />
understate the Importance of the work that is done in the home,<br />
LL's vital, the nation stops without it. DUt to adopt some<br />
statistical confection which would be extraordinarily difficult<br />
is not doing the things that count for women who are working at<br />
home. What they want Is action.<br />
KR: Okay, let's go to the calls. In fact the first call is<br />
about education which you've been talking about. This was<br />
tuoorded yesterday afternoon. It's Helen from Jamestown in South<br />
Australia. ELENt I'm a concerned country parent, ILving two hundred<br />
kilometres north of Adelaide. My major concern Is the decline of<br />
country education opportunities. Five years ago I left secondary<br />
teaching to have a family and in that time the range of subjects<br />
has declined markably, with now many of our Year 12 subjects only<br />
being offered by correspondence. It's just now good enough. No<br />
allowance has been made for the obvious smaller numbers Ln<br />
tountry schools and all staffing is then absolute set for the<br />
Cities so that ( Inaudible) staffLing itself is a real issue too<br />
and people won't come to the country, why should they, when the<br />
same opportunities don't exist here. My son's about to enter<br />
primary school and I truly fear that there may not be a viable<br />
secondary school In seven years. I don't want to have to<br />
mend my children away to Adelaide to school at my cost# but what<br />
alternative can you offer?<br />
KRR Country education, your reaction to that.<br />
PM: Let me make these points, which I trust you will see as<br />
relevant to your concern. The first thing to say is that the<br />
Commonwealth, by definition, doesn't have direot control over<br />
primary and' secondary education, that is a state matter. What<br />
we've triad to do however, in reocognisLng the Importance of<br />
primary and secondary education is to develop with the states<br />
common curricular standard. so that we van have a situation that<br />
iLreapective of the state, and rcoognLing the fact that each<br />
years tene of thousands of people move interstate and are<br />
prejudice by the differing standards, to try and move to a<br />
situaion in thL country where we have common standards. Now as<br />
far a$ the difficulty of getting teachers to go to country areas<br />
is concerned, no government is going to be able to change the </p>
<p>fundamental facts which drive individuals to make a decision an<br />
to whether they want to live and work in the country or in the<br />
city. I mean that's a fundamental which is in a sense beyond<br />
judgement. But what we can do insofar an education is conoerned,<br />
and what we have done, is to make sure that the allowances that<br />
are paid for people who have to send their kids away from their<br />
local area are fair. We have massively increased'the secondary<br />
education allowance, more than doubled it, in the period vevre<br />
been in office, more than doubled it# and trebled the Auetudy<br />
places. so that means that where there is a financial burden or<br />
cost in keeping the kids in the education system, then we have<br />
directed a massive increase in funds towards that, and in this<br />
campaign, as you would know Helen# I've made a decision to bring<br />
in an additional payment which will help parents who are keeping<br />
their kids on in school, and that is a very significant increase<br />
to meet the cost of the child staying on in school. So as far as<br />
O we can, we've done these things, we've kept up assistance in<br />
regard to isolated parents, Isolated children'@ allowances, and<br />
the test finally Helen, ham got to be in the overall statistics.<br />
What we have now is a revolutLonLsed Australian education<br />
position. Hothing can avoid the total condemnation of our<br />
predecessocse that in seven years they virtually lifted the<br />
retention rate not one wit, whereas I have virtually doubled it<br />
in my seven years. And that means we are creating the beet<br />
building block for the future of this country by making sure<br />
that there is an equality of educational opportunity. Helen, let<br />
me conclude by saying this, I don't pretend that perhaps more<br />
should be looked at for the sort of position you'te talking<br />
about, and I give you my undertaking that in this next period<br />
I'll see that in the discussions that my minister for aducatLon<br />
has with his or her state counterparts, that this particular<br />
situation is looked at to see if there is more than we can<br />
realistically do.<br />
KRt Yes, because you don't run the systems, the state rung the<br />
systems# you just fund them.<br />
' 141 But we want to get as much of our ideas iO as we can and I<br />
think the point that Helen makes is a reasonable one.<br />
KRI Okay, back to the offpeak open line. This is Matilda from<br />
Perth. MATILDAs I would like to ask Hr Hawks in which financial way<br />
would: his Government be prepared to support the one income<br />
familyt S/ 6 </p>
<p>PHI Well let me tell you and it'll take a while because there's<br />
a lot of things I can go into but I'll do it as quickly as I can.<br />
Let me, first of all, may this Matilda. Let's go to tax first of<br />
all, and z hope in this last twenty-four hours that every<br />
Australian will have firmly in his and her mind the concept of<br />
equity in regard to ordinary families and the well-to-do, the<br />
contrast between my position and Andrew Peacock's position.<br />
Matilda, just before we went into this election, we negotiated a<br />
wage/ tax package with the ACTU and under that tax part of the<br />
package Matilda, I just want you to understand this, that for the<br />
ordinary average family, you can take the average weekly earning<br />
figure or twenty eight thousand dollar*# a single-income<br />
familylthey've got twenty-eight thousand dollars. Under the tax<br />
package that z negotiated with Kr Keating and the AOTU, that<br />
family at that level will get a tax cut of seven dollars fifty a<br />
week, seven fifty a week, and I will get thirteen dollars twenty<br />
five. 2n other words, 1' 11 get less than aix dollars a week more<br />
than that average family. Mr Peacock has a tax proposal for a<br />
two-tier tax system. What's the position there? That average<br />
family, under the Peacock proposal, would get a cut of $ 4.73 a<br />
week and he as Prime Minister would get $ 104.76 a week. In other<br />
words he'd give himself a $ 100 a week more as a tax Out that he'd<br />
give to your average single income family on $ 28,000. Now there<br />
I hope in this last twenty-four hours, every Australian voter<br />
will be saying to himself and herself, what sort of an<br />
alternative government and Prime Minister is this. For the sort<br />
of family you're talking about Matilda, he'd give himself a<br />
hundred dollars a week more than he'd give for the average family<br />
In tax auto. xt is a disgraoe, an absolute disgrace that we<br />
should have that sort of situation be put to the Australian<br />
people. Now let me go to the other areas Matilda. Let me go to<br />
the question of family allowance and family allowance supplement.<br />
This year Matilda, under family allowance supplement, I'm through<br />
my Government, paying to the lower income people in this<br />
community over two billion dollars in family allowance<br />
suppluments. do that Matilda we don't get caught up in great<br />
national aggregate figures, let me give you an illustration for a<br />
single income family, you're talking about that, on $ 320 a week,<br />
and it's got three kids, That single income family on $ 320 a<br />
week, is getting from my Oovernment, under the family allowance<br />
supplement, $ 110 a week tax-free, which is equivalent Matilda to<br />
$ 170 a week wage increase. Now there yOu have it. I've talked<br />
about tax, I've talked about the family allowance supplement, lot<br />
me go into the area of health. When I came to office, Matilda,<br />
therv" were two million of my fellow Australians, a great number<br />
of those would've been 2 think from single income families and<br />
lower single income familLes, two million of my fellow<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Australian* had no cover. It they got a hill from the doctor, a<br />
big bill from the doctor or a big bill from the hospital, they<br />
were In strifeg. I've ended that and so for every one of those<br />
families you're talking about nov they have no fear of the<br />
doctor'$ bill or the hospital bill. They are covered by<br />
Medicare, for which obviously under the Opposition is going to be<br />
for the chop# so I look at education# I look at health, I look at<br />
tax. hloo in tax, let me make this point, not only does Mr<br />
Peacock want to give himself a hundred dollars a week more in tax<br />
Cuts than he wants to give for your average family# but he wants<br />
to do something which is outrageous for the sort of people you ' re<br />
talking about Matilda. He wants to scrap the capital gain. tax,<br />
which will be bringing in billion* of dollars in the years ahead,<br />
to be spent on families like the ones you're talking about, on<br />
their education, on their health, on their roads, on all the<br />
things they need and he's going to take those billions of dollar.<br />
away from you, out of the Commonwealth public revenue and shovel<br />
it back Into the pockes of the wealthiest loes than one percent<br />
of the Australian population. So whether you look at tax,<br />
education, health, all the thing. that are important, there's<br />
only one choice to be made. if you think it'. fair to give the<br />
Prime Minister a hundred dollars a week more in tax cuts than the<br />
average family, then you vote for Peacock.<br />
KRt Just going back to the family assistance supplement for a<br />
moment, that will definitely continue in your next terml<br />
PM: Not only definitely continue, we've mad* the decisions,<br />
they're in place that those allowances are indexed. so we've<br />
done what's never been done before. We've not just simply made<br />
dscisions and allow them the value of those decisions and amounts<br />
to he whittled away by inflation. They are indexed.<br />
KRI Michael from Sydney, good morning.<br />
MICHIAEL: Good morning to you Prime Xinister. Could I ask you a<br />
quick question on fairneas? Now I applaud what you've done in<br />
the last many years to Implement your standards of greater<br />
fairness, rather than talking about them, and especially I<br />
applaud this new policy of stopping dole rorting as you've termed<br />
it* But we're all Struggling and we're all having a hard time<br />
paying taxes and mortgages and mo forth. Yet there'* s a lot of<br />
social security rotting going on out there, one of the very<br />
unfortunate ones of course being unmarried mothers benefits and<br />
such-thiings. What can we do about making this fair to everyone<br />
who pays and doesn't mind paying for genuine oases ( inaudibla)<br />
means. 6 / e8 </p>
<p>Ks Michael, let me make these points. I must take up, and<br />
vigorously, with you one assumption in your questLont that it's<br />
not fair to be paying allowances to unmarried mothers. Z mean I<br />
just repudiate that concept. I mean you have the situation of<br />
unmarried mothers arising for a range of reasons and I don't<br />
think Auntralian society in such a compaseLonless, morally<br />
judging community that it's going to say in regard tO people in<br />
that situation that the community hasn't got some obligation to<br />
help* What we've got to do of course, Kl and MiChael, is to try<br />
and make sure that in regard to our range of mocial security<br />
payments, including payments to single parents* that we get them<br />
off the concept of the beneticiary outlook and that's why we're<br />
abolishing the dole as such, the unemployment benefit, the dole,<br />
is going. Because what we're going to say to people, you have no<br />
tight to a benefit as such for being unemployed. What you've got<br />
a right to expect from the community is that the community will<br />
provide a range of training programs to equip you to become part<br />
of the workforce and so the statistics michael are quite amasing<br />
in regard to single parents. We've drastioally reduced the<br />
numbers and proportion of people who are just getting Lngle<br />
parent benefits, and what's happening is that they have been<br />
trained under relevant programs to put them back into the<br />
workforce. I mean Michael, that's the sort of thing that you'd<br />
want to leep that's my concept. We inherited a system where<br />
unemployment benefits had exploded because in the last year<br />
before we came to office there was another quarter of a million<br />
people who had been thrown onto the unemployment scrapheap. Now<br />
we've drastically reduced, enormously reduced the number of<br />
people on unemployment benefits, not only by creating a record<br />
number of jobs Michael, but by specifically creating a range of<br />
training programs so that what people in this country have got to<br />
understand is under Labor it's not a government that's just going<br />
to give them a benefit am of right. What they're going to get<br />
are payments which are going increasingly to equip them to become<br />
part of the workforoe. That's not only right from the point of<br />
view of the community, it's also right from the point of view of<br />
the individual because they want the dignity of being able to<br />
S support themselves.<br />
KR: Yes, in fact because I do this program I've got the figures<br />
in front of me, it's something like eighty-five percent of women<br />
on the supporting mothers benefit are either deserted or divoroed<br />
or separated wives. Ten percent of widows and five percent of<br />
the sort of teenage mothers that Hichael was getting concerned<br />
aboqt but for those deserted wives, they want the opportunity<br />
to retrain and get back into the workforce, which is what you<br />
were talking about, but they can vet caught in poverty traps<br />
/ 9 </p>
<p>can't they, whereby they in faot get more support for their<br />
family if they don't retrain, if they go on a training program<br />
they lose the qualification for that benefit.<br />
PMs But we've moved to very substantially eliminate that problem<br />
of poverty traps whioh has been in fact reaognised by the welfare<br />
sector, KRs Lot's go to carolLne now# from Byron Day.<br />
CAROLIN31 My questions relate to the funding for the<br />
psyohiatrically disabled, and the first question is, is it true<br />
Xr Hawke that sincs the introduction of the Disabilities Act of<br />
1906, nothing has been spent on any specific project for the<br />
pyschiatrLcally disabled. Zs it also true that it was never the<br />
intention of Dr Blewett that the mentally ill should receive<br />
monies from his department and that ( inaudible) mental illness<br />
has been as a state health matter and not as a Commonwealth<br />
roesponsibility. And the third question I would ask you Mr Prime<br />
Minister, is would your Government, If re-elected, introduce a<br />
polioy on mental health? You may appreoLate that we as parents<br />
and carets suffer a great loss through mental illness and the<br />
suffering of our loved ones is beyond desoription. You could<br />
certainly alleviate our problems by positive action in<br />
government, eepeoially in the area of research, and z'd be very<br />
happy to writ, a letter to you if that was okay, and properly<br />
outline out major concerns for the mentally ill.<br />
PHi Thank you very much for your question, could I go to the<br />
last part first. This is not just a flip answer, z would<br />
appreciate it very much it you would write to me and if you'd<br />
write to me care of Parliament House, Canberra, and I will<br />
guarantee not only that 2 will read what you've got to say but<br />
I'll see that the relevant minister in my next administration<br />
also takes it into account. You're into an area where of course<br />
we have the problem which is acknowledged in your number of<br />
questions which I'll try and bring together, that as in the area<br />
of transport and education, so in the area of health, there are<br />
divided responsibilitis between the Iederal government and the<br />
states. What we've tried to do Carolyn, in this area, as in<br />
others, is where we haven't got the direct constitutional<br />
responsibility as we have not, this is an area of state<br />
responsibility, we've recognined that there are real problems for<br />
people like yourself that you talk about, and what my ministers,<br />
and that's pertioularly Heal Blewett, have a major responsibllty.<br />
Khia he's tried to do is, in discussion with the states, to get<br />
some sort of uniform approeoh. and uniform concept of the<br />
responsibility that the community has to the range of people that </p>
<p>you're talking about, and we have been engaged in this in a<br />
number of wayso not only in the area of actual treatment and<br />
discusuions with him an that, but also of courtti, one of the<br />
important areas Carolyn in to try and look at the area of<br />
employment opportunities, and there's been the concoept as you<br />
know in the past, of trying basically, if not intentionly# at<br />
least that was the result# to try and bids people with<br />
disabilities# whether they were mental disabilities or physical<br />
disabilities, to try and put them away and almost pretend they<br />
didn' t exist. Our concept rather Carolyn has been to have an<br />
approach which as far as possible in going to give people with<br />
disabilities, whether they be physical or mental, the greatest<br />
possible opportunity of integrating into the conventional<br />
workforce, because we think that's best for the people concerned<br />
and it's the best thing that th. community should do end no<br />
that's the concept that weeve used in out discussions with the<br />
states in the areas of say where we don't have the primary<br />
responsibility. out I conclude as I began Carolyn# by saying I<br />
would appreciate it if you would write to me and X give you my<br />
personal undertaking that not only will T read the letter but<br />
211 see that it's considered by those with the direct<br />
responsibility. KR: Too* the policy of deinstitutionalisation, pursued by a lot<br />
of the states, has created a lot of pain for the people who are<br />
the immediate family and caters of the mentally ill. They<br />
feel sometimes loot without supports<br />
IN. Yes, and they are entitled to expect appropriate support.<br />
Ras Graham from Brisbane now.<br />
GRAHAM: Whatever your personal views about abortion may be,<br />
there are many Australians who sincerely believe that abortion ie<br />
deliberate killing of innocent unborn human life. Thos. who hold<br />
such a view believe that this is immoral and unjust# that they<br />
should be Compelled to help pay for such murder through Medicare.<br />
S if Labor is re-elected, will you allow an abortion funding<br />
abolition bill, such am the one put forward in the last<br />
Parliament by Alistair Webster# to be put to a vote? tf not# why<br />
not? PHt Well Graham, let me say that you go in your question to<br />
something which is obviously a matter of very deep foeling for a<br />
lot of people. May S may it's not only a matter of depth of<br />
feeling by those who share your view# but what you must<br />
understand is an equally deep foeling by others who have an<br />
/ 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
opposite point of View. I have never tried to hide my posLtion<br />
and 2 restate it. it's probably why Z'm the target of abuse by<br />
some people. I have a clear view Graham, that this is a question<br />
for the woman to determine. wow in saying that Graham, I don't<br />
in any men* e want to be denigratory of your view, I respeat the<br />
depth of the feeling that you and others have on this. I've got<br />
to say with equal honesty to you that it's my view that it's the<br />
right of the woman to make the Judgement. if people want to try<br />
and have a consideration of the piece of legislation I don't mind<br />
first speaking for myself. 2 propose a piece Of legislation<br />
being considered. My view in those circumstances, is that it<br />
should be a conscience vote on this matter. We'd better<br />
postphone the vote for a fairly long time though, to give Me<br />
Blunt the time to make up his mind. ge doesn't seem to know<br />
where he Is on the issue.<br />
XR1 Mind you, the community debate over abortion is beyond<br />
politicians to settle I would assume.<br />
PMs Yes, and that's why I say, Koj I think it ought to be a<br />
conscience vote, but as I say, we'd better postphone it for a<br />
couple of years because Charles Blunt needs a long time to make<br />
up his mind. He's occupied both powitions apparently, within the<br />
4pace of a week.<br />
KR: Let's go to Greg now# from South 6tirling in Western<br />
Australia, near Albany.<br />
cRSO. T'd like to ask the Prime Minister how many children live<br />
in poverty in Australia, and is the number rising or fallLng?<br />
And also, of the one billion trees that they are going to plant,<br />
how many have they planted and how are they doing?<br />
VN: Let's go to children first and then we'll go to the trees,<br />
and I thank you for your question and Z hope there's no cynicism<br />
involved. If there L, the facts will knock you over. The<br />
number of children in poverty has rapidly diminished. I won't<br />
rely on my judgement about the delivery of my promise that there<br />
be no financial need for a child to live in poverty by i990.<br />
Rather, let me quote to you the words from three independent<br />
bodies who work in the area and who don't parade on the periphery<br />
with prejudices. What are these words? rirstly, of Peter<br />
Hollingworth from the Brotherhood, of St Laurence, he said# in<br />
stret income seourity terms the Prime Minister's promise will<br />
have been delivered. Secondly# Julian Disney, who was then the<br />
Chairman of the Australian Council of social Services, he said<br />
that it was a truly remarkable achievement first to have set<br />
and then to have achieved the payments for children in low income<br />
/ 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
families. ThLrd, the Australian jnstLtute of Family Studies who<br />
said, in these ways the benchmarks not by the Government have<br />
been met, and just look what thoeo benchmarks were and what's<br />
involved. We in diseuesLon with the welfare sector, said now how<br />
@ re we going to deliver on this promLee, what's the best way of<br />
delivering on this promise that there'll be no financial need for<br />
a child to live in poverty, and we agreed with them that we<br />
should set benchmarks as a percentage of the married pension<br />
rate. That wan fifteen percent of no pension rate, for a child<br />
under thirteen and twenty percent for a chLld between thirteen<br />
and fifteen. Translated into money terms, that is $ 24.15 a week<br />
for a child under thirteen and $ 35.25 a week for a child between<br />
thirteen and fifteen. now lot me gLve you what that means in<br />
aggregate termse. zt means that this year we're paying over two<br />
billLon dollars, a year, to ahLldren of low-income families to<br />
deliver on that promise, which as X say, all the organisations<br />
say has been done. It means, to give you the example that Z used<br />
earlier in this program, that for a low-income famLly with one<br />
income, $ 320 a week, with three kids that family is getting $ 110<br />
a weGk tax-free@.,<br />
( END O TAPE) a soo/ 13 </p>
<p>-13-<br />
PM: .,,... poverty because you the disastrous situations of<br />
gamily break-ups, ohildren away from home, and that's why the<br />
state governments, local government and the welfare sector has<br />
responded positively to my calling them together as I did, to say<br />
alright now, we've delivered on that part of the promise but what<br />
we've now all got to do together is to make sure that we deliver,<br />
all of Us, the servioee at the points of need and that's what's<br />
been done.<br />
KRs Trees. Con just ask a follow-up question to that? Having<br />
met the financial target, there are then non-finanoial or social<br />
wage targets to be met and the Brotherhood of St Laurence and<br />
ACOSS have put together a package of proposals they call the<br />
Promise the Children package. That includes things like, have a<br />
CIPACt have a children's planning advisory council, if it's<br />
important enough to do it for the economy it's important enough<br />
to do it for children, ratifying the un convention on the rights<br />
of the child, it's a package of things. Have you seen that<br />
package? Have you got a response to it?<br />
PRi We've asked them to meet with us. We've already had a<br />
meeting# not only with the Brotherhood of 8t Laurence but with<br />
the Australian Council of Social Service, and we are in constant<br />
communication, we* ve undertaken that when we're re-lected that<br />
we'll go on with this dialogue. We've also got to do it with<br />
state governments and local governments because so much of the<br />
delivery of relevant services are in the hands of the state and<br />
local governments a. veil. go yes, the answer is we're going to<br />
continue in dialogue, not only with the Drotherhood but with<br />
hCOSS and the other tiers of government, to see that we<br />
delivered. You also know that in the campaign policy speech t<br />
also committed my incoming government to additional programs to<br />
meet the particular problems of the outer-suburban areas and the<br />
smaller towns, because part of the problem Kel, is that a lot of<br />
people in these outer suburban areas or remote towns don't have<br />
the degree of access to services and knowledge about services<br />
that others do so I've committed a fair bit more money to dealing<br />
with the problem in that way. Now the trees. One billion trees.<br />
A very, very snide attempt by some people to say that what Hawke<br />
promised was that he was going to plant one billion trees and we<br />
were all going to go around and plant the trees.<br />
KRi When they'd all been numbered, as they were, yes. </p>
<p>-14-<br />
VMt Yes, what I said at the time was tble, That that billion<br />
would come in two ways. There would be four hundred million, by a<br />
Community planting program, and six hundred million by direct<br />
seeding and regeneration, where we would conduct programs which<br />
are being done now, to accelerate that aspect of Lt, and that we<br />
would being the community into the four hundred million part of<br />
it* Together there'd be a billion ( dollars). Nov I didn't may<br />
that Bob Hawke in Canberra would supervise this. We oat down<br />
with GreenLng Australia, the relevant organisatLon. Greening<br />
Australia has from day one been involved in the concept and in<br />
implementation and Greening AustralLa the body whLh the best<br />
equipped# the most relevant, has expressed a) it's satisfaction<br />
with the concept and b) the way its implementation is going. And<br />
may I say, z want to thank the community groups around Australia<br />
who have responded to put such enormous enthusiasm to this<br />
imaginative and relevant concept.<br />
XRt Look I know you've got a press conference at ten. Could you<br />
stay with us for a few more minutes?<br />
Pis hbout three?<br />
ARS Okay, this is Scott from Newoastle.<br />
GCOTTo Good mornLng Kr Hawke.<br />
PH. Good morning Soott.<br />
IGOTT beat of luck tomorrow.<br />
P~ e Thanks mate.<br />
8COTTI I'm a final year degree student at Newcastle UnLvarsity<br />
and I'm living on Austudy. My question is, many of my colleagues<br />
have the problem where we are working very hard whereas people on<br />
unemployment benefite are receiving probably sometimes twentyfive*<br />
thirty dollars a week more than we are. t appreciate that<br />
you've created more Rustudy places otcetera, but with the change<br />
in emphasis towards retraining, as opposed to unemployment<br />
benefite do you plan to do anything towards making people who<br />
are studying receive at least the same income an people on<br />
unemployment benefits? We have the same personal needs, we have<br />
the needs to buy text books etcetera. The psycholgical<br />
disadvantage L really, really straining on many people. </p>
<p>-IS&amp;<br />
PHI scott, lot mne oak* point, When we came to office, the gap<br />
the wrong way between unemploymenft benefits . and student<br />
allowances was crazy. it was just, in just about every category<br />
of age group, it was worth more for a young person to go on<br />
unemployment benefits than to study* Now we have changed that<br />
around and further in this, there's another part of our<br />
deoisionsp earlier this year, where in regard to another age<br />
category we finally closed that gap, because it was untenable.<br />
that you should have that sort of area of differential. Z ea<br />
it was sifoply, in Australia, generally speaking. generallyo<br />
everywhere in all sorts of categories, it was worth more for a<br />
young person to go on the dole than to go into education. so<br />
what we've done is to close that gap# massively increse<br />
education allowances. But the other part of it Scott, is that<br />
what we're doing is now we're virtually abolishing the concept og<br />
unemployment benefit, vnder my 0overnmentr the concept of<br />
unemployment benefit will disappear and the requirement will bet<br />
it a person isn't in a Job# isn't in the education system and<br />
isn't already in a training scheme, then that person will have to<br />
undergo a training scheme. In' their first nine months there'll<br />
be a job search allowance and that wil, be strictly supervised<br />
to make sure that they are searching for a job# and then after<br />
that they have no right to an unemployment benefit, they only<br />
have a right to get an amount of money which will sustain them in<br />
one or other of a training scheme,<br />
XRI Quick final question and than we'll release you and you can<br />
dash off to your press conference. Rugh Stretton said on thin<br />
program this week, that one of the reasons why home mortgage<br />
interest rates are so high as they are# one of the principle<br />
reasons is because of the deregulation of the financial and<br />
banking sector. And he argues that if we want our children to<br />
have the choice of housing we had, at reasonable interest rate.#<br />
the banking and financial sector needs to be selectively roregulated.<br />
Do you have any response to that?<br />
Flit Yes, I do. Hugh is, by philosophical dispositione more ot a<br />
regulator than not and I respect Hugh, he's been a great<br />
contributor to thinking in this country. I haven't always agreed<br />
with all of his thoughts but I respect Hugh Streeton as a<br />
stimulator of thinking in others. On this point I don't agree<br />
with Hugh. We had a situation bef-ore, where under a regulated<br />
system and with Just a limited number ot banke, what they did<br />
you didn't have to choke off people by raising interest<br />
rates, they'd just stop the supply of money. X guess the tet,<br />
of between the two systems, is simply this, that in the period of<br />
my Government there's been of per annum cents, ten percent per<br />
/ is </p>
<p>-Ifannum<br />
more houses built under lay Government than there were under<br />
my predecessors where they had a totally regulated system. That<br />
doesn't mean however, that you simply think that you end your<br />
obligation and committment to the community in regard to housing<br />
by simply deregulating the financial sector. x hope Hugh would<br />
take account of the fact that in the area of welfare housing,<br />
including just in the last year, we made a very significant<br />
decision which increased the amount of money from just over sevenl<br />
hundred million dollars a year to over eight billion# under the<br />
Commonwealth State Housing agreement, which is going to make more<br />
funds available. And this is a result of decision, not leaving<br />
Lt to the market but hers is a specific decision by government in<br />
consultation with the states to make much more money available to<br />
the states to spend on housing or the relevantly lose fortunate<br />
section of the community. Of course at the same time, int the<br />
earlier stage of out Government, we brought in the first home<br />
owner scheme which now over the duration of my Governmient has<br />
meant that some three hundred and forty thousand people and<br />
families have been put into homes that otherwise would not have<br />
done it. go I think Hugh's got to understand that if you're<br />
talking about housing and government policy, that what you do La<br />
regard to the banks and the deregulation of the financial sector<br />
Lu but one part of a comprehensive approach to housing.<br />
