PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRT-! E MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM 1-cIYV\ HON, C11, ~ P<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, CANBERRA<br />
OUTWARD PORTFOLIO INVESTVIENT<br />
28 SEPTEMBER, 1972<br />
Following my announcement on policy changes in respect of<br />
overseas investment, I now wish to give details of the new exchange<br />
control policy which will apply for the time being to portfolio<br />
investment abroad by Australian residents.<br />
Persons or companies wishing to invest abroad should apply<br />
by letter through their bankers for the necessary Reserve Bank<br />
authority. Applications by individuals for amounts up to $ 10,000<br />
in any period of twelve months in total will normally be readily<br />
approved. Institutional investors, public companies and the like<br />
can normally expect to be permitted to make inves-tments up to<br />
$ 1 million in any period of twelve months. Applications for amounts<br />
in excess of the amounts mentioned will be considered in special<br />
circumstances. Eligible investments will include portfolio investment<br />
overseas in stocks and shares and purchase of real estate, but<br />
will not include investment in loans or other fixed interest<br />
securities. The general arrangements will, of course, be subject to<br />
review from time to time.<br />
This policy change is the first significant relaxation in<br />
the almosta~ mplete embargo on Portfolio investment overseas which<br />
had operated since exchange control measures were introduced in<br />
1939. Policy towards direct investment overseas has, however,<br />
been very liberal for a number of years and will continue unchanged. </p>
