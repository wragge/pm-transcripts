STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT, IN THE<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE<br />
24TH AUGUST, 19 6<br />
NAVAL SUPPORT FACILITY IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
The Government has decided that an investigation will<br />
be commenced this year into the feasibility of establishing<br />
Naval support facilities for the R. A. N. at Cockburn Sound, near<br />
Fremantle. The Royal Australian Navy has indicated the<br />
desirability of such a facility in the short and long term.<br />
It has been decided that before any firm decision<br />
is taken, an expert technical investigation should be carried<br />
out at Cockburn Sound by a firm of consultant engineers to be<br />
engaged through the Commnonwealth Department of Works. The<br />
purpose of this investigation will be to select the most suitable<br />
site for the possible establishment of the facilities, prepare<br />
a design study and cost estimates. The results will be the<br />
essential basis for further consideration by the Government.<br />
The terms of reference for the study and the necessary arrangements<br />
will be completed as quickly as possible.<br />
While the investigation will be directed primarily<br />
to the requirements of the it will of course, take<br />
fully into account the possible needs of Allied Navies for use<br />
of the proposed facilities including, in particular the possible<br />
needs of the Royal Navy. In this context, honourable members<br />
will recall that I said last February, following the talks with<br />
Mr. Healey, the United Kingdom Minister for Defence, that we in<br />
Australia if we were considering in future the establishment<br />
of facilities here for the purposes of our own growing establishment<br />
would take into our thinking the circumstance that these<br />
facilities might at some point of time and in some contingencies<br />
be needed for United Kingdom Service requirements.<br />
-In deciding to have the feasibility study made the<br />
government has also taken into account the continuing development<br />
in the Cockburn Sound area and hence its growing capacity to<br />
provide industrial support. The investigation now ordered into<br />
he question of a further expansion of defence facilities at<br />
Cockburn Sound is in harmony with the Government's general policy<br />
of encouraging regional development in appropriate areas of<br />
Australia in accordance with their particular characteristics<br />
and potentialities. Naturally, the Commonwealth activity will proceed<br />
in the closest collaoration with the Western Australian<br />
Jovernment to ensure that Naval requirements and plans are<br />
properly integrated with those of the Vestern Australian State<br />
authorities for the development of the area. </p>
