PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAIN; T EL. TIERY EMBARGOE UNILDELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
24TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE<br />
SYDNEY 9 OCTOBER 1990<br />
Eleven years have elapsed since the International Iron and<br />
Steel Institute last met in Sydney.<br />
On that occasion this distinguished Conference was addressed<br />
by my predecessor, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.<br />
It is my hope indeed, it is my very firm belief that<br />
this audience will have noted the huge changes that have<br />
been wrought: in Australia over the intervening years<br />
economic, so~ cial and attitudinal.<br />
These changes have created in Australia a more competitive<br />
and more productive economy, and a more outward-looking and<br />
more cooperative society.<br />
It has been nothing short of a dramatic process of national<br />
revitalisation.<br />
Nowhere is t~ his more clear than in the way the Australian<br />
steel industry has been turned around from a basket case in<br />
1983 to a profitable, internationally competitive and<br />
increasingly productive economic player.<br />
One of the important contributions Australia can make to the<br />
future of the world steel industry is the lesson that we<br />
learned, as a medium-sized producer of steel in a small<br />
domestic market, here during the 1980s.<br />
In particular, the lesson of consensus the diligent search<br />
for ways of harnessing the interests of Government, trade<br />
unions and employers to advance the common good is, I<br />
believe, an instructive Australian lesson that deserves more<br />
widespread international recognition.<br />
on many occasions, I have praised the commitment shown by<br />
BHP and the steel unions to making a success of the Steel<br />
Plan that the Government created in 1983. It is a pleasure<br />
to do so once again, in talking to this international<br />
audience that truly knows what it takes to succeed in this<br />
competitive industry. </p>
<p>I want to speak to you more generally this evening about the<br />
turnaround in the Australian economy since the early 1980s,<br />
of which the steel industry provides but one example, albeit<br />
an eloquent one.<br />
As my friend and colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister Paul<br />
Keating told you yesterday, this Government has changed<br />
Australia in ways that were inconceivable before we came to<br />
office in 1983.<br />
We have floated the dollar, abolished exchange controls,<br />
deregulated the finance industry and removed most<br />
restrictions on foreign investment. We have dramatically<br />
by one third slashed tariffs on what was once a heavily<br />
protected manufacturing sector. And we have transformed a<br />
prospective $ 9 billion deficit in our budget to a healthy<br />
surplus.<br />
Would that they could do that in the United States and not<br />
by raising taxes but by doing it the hard way, as we have<br />
done, by reducing outlays. At the same time as we achieve<br />
our fourth successive budget surplus, we are also seeing<br />
revenue as a proportion of GDP declining for the fourth<br />
successive year, to only 25.5 per cent in 1990-91.<br />
We are tackling in decisive ways the inherited<br />
inefficiencies of our micro-economy, with reforms of<br />
telecommunications, civil aviation, land transport and<br />
waterfront, and with a new initiative, in co-operation with<br />
the State Premiers, to make our ninety-year old Federal<br />
structure of Government more up to date and efficient.<br />
We are improving our education system and expanding the<br />
resources we devote to research and development. We want, as<br />
I have said repeatedly to Australian audiences, to be the<br />
clever country, not merely the lucky country.<br />
The exercise of wage restraint by unions has cut real unit<br />
labour costs by more than 10 per cent since 1982-83.<br />
It has brought about the creation of 1.6 million new jobs<br />
a rate of employment growth nearly double the OECD average.<br />
At the same time, the resulting lift in the profit share,<br />
along with a more efficient taxation system including a<br />
cut in company tax and the elimination of double taxation of<br />
dividends has created an investment boom virtually without<br />
parallel in modern Australian history.<br />
Again, it is a uniquely Australian achievement different<br />
sides working together through consensus and, where<br />
necessary, shared sacrifice, to improve the national good.<br />
Only the Prices and Incomes Accord between the trade union<br />
movement and the Government could have achieved the<br />
necessary wage restraint that triggered this process. </p>
<p>By the same token, only under the Accord could improvements<br />
in the social wage for example, our reintroduction of<br />
universal system of health insurance, Medicare have been<br />
delivered to help compensate for that wage restraint.<br />
Perhaps most fundamental of all the changes we have wrought<br />
in Australia has been the change of Australian attitudes.<br />
For much of the post-war era, Australian manufacturers<br />
basically shirked the challenge of international<br />
competition. Governments acquiesced in this saga of lost<br />
opportunities by erecting high tariff walls behind which the<br />
manufacturing sector could shelter, servicing the small<br />
domestic market but ignoring the wider regional and world<br />
markets. The problem was not that Australians could not mount<br />
effective international competition; we did it every day<br />
with our high quality commodity exports.<br />
Our agricultural sector was and remains one of the world's<br />
most efficient a point to which I shall return.<br />
The problem was that we chose the easier option of reaping<br />
the profits of our God-given resources rather than<br />
complementing that with the harder work of creating new<br />
export industries with our hands and our minds.<br />
That basic indisposition was reinforced by a failure to<br />
harness what was potentially a world-class intellectual base<br />
to the task of applied research.<br />
At the same time, our fragmented, craft-based, increasingly<br />
antiquated industrial relations structure was hampering<br />
progress. I can tell you, as a former trade union leader,<br />
that the " us-versus-them" philosophy was deeply entrenched<br />
throughout the Australian economy.<br />
Short term perspectives, measured by the relative gains and<br />
losses of employers and employees in wage bargaining,<br />
heavily outweighed long-term perspectives of what was<br />
actually good for the nation.<br />
In the same way, the confrontationist nature of our<br />
industrial relations structures all too often allowed<br />
disputes to turn into strikes especially when, as often<br />
happened, short-sighted Governments poured fuel on the fire.<br />
To take all these factors together, Australian attitudes<br />
throughout the long post war decades, and especially for<br />
much of the 1970s, could be summed up as the complacent<br />
belief that the world owed us a living and would keep on<br />
buying our commodities to support our high standards of<br />
living. The truth was very different.<br />
The world doesn't owe us a living. </p>
<p>And increasingly, since we came to office in 1983 and in<br />
particular since the nation's terms of trade collapsed in<br />
the mid-1980s under the weight of our over-reliance on<br />
commodities that truth is being appreciated, understood<br />
and acted upon throughout the Australian community.<br />
The magnitude of the challenge facing Australia is at last<br />
being recognised.<br />
That is what has underpinned all the other reforms that I<br />
have outlined, and what has, indeed, made them possible.<br />
For it would not have been possible to impose this kind of<br />
change from above; it has taken the maturity of the<br />
community, its willingness to abandon old habits, its<br />
preparedness to work harder and work smarter, that has made<br />
these reforms possible.<br />
Let me give one detailed example of this.<br />
It used to be the case that our trading partners, with some<br />
justification, expressed concern over the effect of<br />
Australia's industrial relations on our reliability as an<br />
exporter. But such concerns are now simply out of date.<br />
Under the Accord process, industrial disputes have been cut<br />
by nearly 60 per cent; our strike record now compares very<br />
favourably with that of other OECD nations.<br />
At the same time, we are undertaking a fundamental<br />
restructuring of unions and of industrial awards.<br />
The truth is that these days the trade union movement is a<br />
positive factor, not a negative one, in encouraging economic<br />
growth and competitiveness in Australia.<br />
When that truth is better appreciated by our trading<br />
partners we will see further real gains in our economic<br />
relationships. My friends<br />
In recent days, we have seen Germany united and the British<br />
agree to enter the European Monetary System on the one<br />
hand, an exemplar of the complex task of integrating Eastern<br />
and Western Europe and on the other, a significant step<br />
forward in the continuing process of European economic<br />
union. </p>
<p>These developments will present considerable opportunities<br />
to Australian investors and enterprises. And if Europe<br />
plays the leadership role which it should if it avoids the<br />
temptation of becoming self-satisfied, complacent, and<br />
narrow-minded in its pursuit of short-term economic gain<br />
if it harnesses its growing power to a constructive and<br />
united international role then the immense changes taking<br />
place in Europe can be greatly to the benefit of the world<br />
at large.<br />
But it is on our own Asia-Pacific region, the most<br />
economically dynamic in the world, that I wish to address<br />
the rest of my remarks this evening.<br />
As a nation, Australia has been aware for many years of the<br />
critical economic importance to us of the Asia-Pacific<br />
region.<br />
Anyone involved in the Japanese steel industry would<br />
appreciate its reliance, over several decades, on imports of<br />
Australian coal.<br />
But it is only in recent years indeed, I make the claim,<br />
it is only under this Government that Australia has<br />
effectively projected itself as, and has started to be seen<br />
as, a truly active, respected and positive partner in the<br />
region. Indeed, as I said this afternoon in the Federal Parliament,<br />
Australia today stands at a high point of its constructive<br />
influence in the region.<br />
Our contribution to the creation of the framework, recently<br />
embraced by * the UN Security Council, for advancing the<br />
restoration of peace in Cambodia, and our seminal role in<br />
the establishment of APEC, the new forum for Asia-Pacific<br />
Economic Cooperation all attest to that.<br />
APEC is a tangible expression both of the dynamism of the<br />
Asia-Pacific region, and of the region's commitment to see<br />
what more can be done to enhance that dynamism and<br />
prosperity. Eight of Australia's top 10 export markets in 1989-90 are in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
APEC members plus the so-called ' three Chinas' the PRC,<br />
Taiwan and Hong Kong take 68 per cent of Australia's<br />
exports and provide 66 per cent of our imports.<br />
So Australia today is as good an example of regional<br />
interdependence as any economy in the region.<br />
The basis of our trade has always been commodities, and we<br />
will remain an efficient and prolific commodities exporter. </p>
<p>But it is the point of everything that I have said this<br />
evening that Australia now looks to a greater<br />
diversification of our trade with the region.<br />
There is much scope for further manufactured exports,<br />
including from the steel industry, and continued expansion<br />
of regional exports by Australia's service industries such<br />
as tourism, education, the law.<br />
In short, we look to the comprehensive enmeshment of our<br />
economy with that of the region.<br />
It is important that this process not be seen solely as an<br />
economic one.<br />
One of the features of policy making under this Government<br />
has been our capacity to integrate domestic economic<br />
initiatives with international diplomacy.<br />
For instance, we have ensured that Australia speaks with a<br />
loud and clear voice on the great question of trade<br />
liberalisation a question of profound importance for the<br />
Asia-Pacific region and for the world.<br />
And we speak with a credible voice.<br />
Having undertaken significant tariff reform within our own<br />
economy having demonstrated our own political commitment<br />
to a cause that is of fundamental importance to us all we<br />
have been able to play a prominent role in the Uruguay Round<br />
of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.<br />
We established the Cairns Group of nations dedicated to the<br />
liberalisation of agricultural trading rules under GATT.<br />
Throughout the vitally important Uruguay Round, Australia<br />
and its colleagues in the Cairns Group have been able to<br />
exert continuous pressure on those nations particularly<br />
the European Community and Japan who distort global<br />
agricultural markets with their own massive domestic<br />
subsidies.<br />
As I said earlier, Australian agricultural producers are<br />
among the most efficient in the world, and they are<br />
justifiably outraged when those nations that lack our<br />
efficiency threaten, by their inefficiency, the very basis<br />
of world trade on which we all depend.<br />
My friends,<br />
I am saying none of this merely to pat Australia on the<br />
back, or to pretend that we do not still have a long way to<br />
go down the path of economic reform. </p>
<p>7.<br />
My message to this influential group is more challenging. It<br />
is a message to the international community and to our<br />
trading partners in particular to recognise the magnitude<br />
of the changes that have been wrought in this country over<br />
recent years, and to recognise that the process of change<br />
within Australia continues. We will not turn back.<br />
Indeed, let me say it bluntly: it is time our trading<br />
partners brought their attitudes about Australia into line<br />
with the contemporary reality of what is happening in this<br />
country. There is a dramatic turnaround taking place here. We can now<br />
say to the world that we are ready and re-equipped in both<br />
our institutions and our attitudes to be a fully competitive<br />
player and partner in the exciting economic challenges that<br />
await us. </p>
