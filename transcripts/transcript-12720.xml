<p>E&amp;OE........... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen, I';d like to brief you on the just completed</p>
<p> COAG meeting.</p>
<p> I should explain the Premier of New South Wales because of the deteriorating</p>
<p> fire situation in and around Sydney has returned already. And I'm very</p>
<p> pleased to announce that we've had a very successful COAG meeting. The</p>
<p> most important area of agreement has been in relation to a very significant</p>
<p> strengthening of laws across Australian in relation to handguns.</p>
<p>The COAG meeting has endorsed the 28 resolutions made by the Australasian</p>
<p> Police Ministers' Council, and it';s been agreed that the legislative</p>
<p> and administrative measures should be in place by the 30th of June next</p>
<p> year. In two important respects the COAG decision has gone further than</p>
<p> the police ministers. We';ve agreed that handguns will be limited</p>
<p> to a maximum of 0.38 calibre except for specially accredited sporting</p>
<p> events where handguns up to 0.45 will be permitted and details of that</p>
<p> will be worked out quickly and endorsed by a committee of officials to</p>
<p> report to COAG. There has been consultation between the Minister for Police</p>
<p> and Customs and sporting shooters' organisations.</p>
<p>We';ve also noted the importance of removing easily concealable</p>
<p> handguns from the community and as a result we';ve gone further than</p>
<p> recommended by the police ministers in one other area, and we';ve</p>
<p> agreed that semi-automatic handguns with a barrel length of less than</p>
<p> 120 millimetres, and revolvers and single shot handguns with a barrel</p>
<p> length of less than 100 millimetres will be prohibited. Highly specialised</p>
<p> target pistols, some of which have a barrel length of less than 120 millimetres</p>
<p> will be allowed.</p>
<p>Could I say that this is a very important step to making the streets</p>
<p> of Australia safer. I want to thank the Premiers and Chief Ministers for</p>
<p> the highly cooperative spirit and the united approach that';s come</p>
<p> out of this meeting. Issues involving the safety of the population should</p>
<p> always be above any differences of the partisan kind and that has provend</p>
<p> to be the case. We reached what I regard as an eminently reasonable understanding</p>
<p> relating to the cost. There will be a buyback, there will be an amnesty</p>
<p> of both legal and illegal guns. And the buyback will be funded initially</p>
<p> from the $15 million which is left over from the buyback monies from the</p>
<p> post Port Arthur buyback, and the rest the Commonwealth will meet two-thirds</p>
<p> and the states one-third. And I think it';s a very good arrangement.</p>
<p> We were very keen at the Commonwealth level to see the tightest possible</p>
<p> laws. The Premiers and Chief Ministers endorsed that approach and we have</p>
<p> reached a very happy understanding but importantly it';s an extremely</p>
<p> good outcome for Australia and this is particularly important for people</p>
<p> who are worried about crime and worried about the danger to their children</p>
<p> and to themselves. And I';ve frequently said and I';ll say it</p>
<p> again today there are many things I admire about America but one thing</p>
<p> I do not admire about the United States is their gun culture and I will</p>
<p> do everything I humanly can to make sure that culture never seeps into</p>
<p> Australia and spreads into the streets of Australia. I think the ready</p>
<p> availability of handguns is a curse in our kind of society and the more</p>
<p> that we can all do to take them out the better.</p>
<p>Could I report that we had a very good discussion on counter-terrorism</p>
<p> and security matters. We';ll be issuing a communique. We also dealt</p>
<p> with matters relating to water rights. We';ve agreed to circulate</p>
<p> the COAG paper of COAG officials and that matter obviously will be discussed</p>
<p> again at a subsequent meeting of COAG.</p>
<p>But I';d like to thank my colleagues, Premiers and Chief Ministers.</p>
<p> The last time we sat around here I think was stem cells legislation and</p>
<p> it';s coincidental that only yesterday the Senate passed the legislation</p>
<p> and I think that was a very good example of Commonwealth/State cooperation</p>
<p> and that';s what the Australian people want. They want these issues</p>
<p> tackled cooperatively and we';ve been able to do that and we';ve</p>
<p> done it again today with handguns and I think the Australian people will</p>
<p> welcome the result.</p>
<p>PREMIER BRACKS:</p>
<p>Could I just add a couple of comments to the Prime Minister';s assessment</p>
<p> of COAG today. It was an excellent COAG meeting. Very productive, very</p>
<p> cooperative and agreement was reached on almost every item associated</p>
<p> with the COAG agenda. Can I also indicate that the decision made on handguns</p>
<p> is an important decision for the nation and a very important decision</p>
<p> also for Victoria. That means effectively that there's going to be 20</p>
<p> % less handguns now available as a result of a buy-back, restrictions</p>
<p> on some calibres and some types of guns, the handing in of handguns and</p>
<p> the buy-back of those handguns. That takes out of circulation about 20</p>
<p> % of the current handguns that are circulating around our community currently.</p>
<p> I think this is a stunning outcome, a very good outcome, when you think</p>
<p> that the Police Ministers were, at some stage, recommending a different</p>
<p> option which would have meant about 6 % reduction in handguns. The Prime</p>
<p> Minister, the Territory leaders and the Premiers agreed today we should</p>
<p> lift that to 20 % and to make it a tougher and a harder regime that's</p>
<p> important for the safety of our community and I think it's one which we</p>
<p> can all be proud of and I'm very pleased to be a part of that today.</p>
<p>RANN:</p>
<p>Say on behalf on South Australia that I think that we would have let</p>
<p> down the people of Australia today if we hadn't have come out with a very</p>
<p> strong agreement for a major toughening up of the rules relating to handguns.</p>
<p> Every Australian that I meet wants a safer Australia, particularly in</p>
<p> regard to recent events. So this is a substantial, and I think a historic,</p>
<p> agreement between the Federal Government of the States and Territories</p>
<p> to limit, as Steve Bracks said, a 20 % reduction in the number of handguns</p>
<p> available in Australia with a range of other restrictions. In South Australia,</p>
<p> we are actually doing some other things, we are converting firearms offences</p>
<p> that are summary offences into much more serious offences with very hefty</p>
<p> penalties and times in jail. We're also taking action in relation to outlaw</p>
<p> motorcycle gangs. All of us, I think, would be concerned by the fact that</p>
<p> so much crime in Australia seems to come out of outlaw motorcycle gangs</p>
<p> who build fortresses in our cities and we've just announced legislation</p>
<p> that will allow, with the arrangements with the Police Commissioner, for</p>
<p> us to bulldoze bikie fortresses. So this is across the board, I think,</p>
<p> a major step forward to make Australia a safer place.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard and Mr Bracks, you say that 20 % of guns are going to be removed</p>
<p> but both of you wanted stronger plans - 27, 30 % of guns. Is this in any</p>
<p> way watered down what you have…?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A stronger option originally.</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Rann, can I ask if you support today's decision…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Who are you talking to?</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Rann. Why did South Australia originally refuse to sign onto that</p>
<p> agreement at the Police Ministers meeting?</p>
<p>PREMIER RANN:</p>
<p>This is a different agreement on a different area. I mean, what we've</p>
<p> done is actually now reached a different funding formula which we're now</p>
<p> happy with and also, of course, there has been an understanding between</p>
<p> us on how it will apply. As I said, the people of Australia did not want</p>
<p> to see Premiers and Prime Ministers and Chief Ministers disagreeing on</p>
<p> something of such fundamental importance such as the safety of Australians.</p>
<p> So, you know we think that a very good agreement has come out of this</p>
<p> both in terms of the nature and the extent of the buy-back and also the</p>
<p> funding arrangements.</p>
<p>BEATTIE:</p>
<p>To answer your question, everyone acted here today in the national interest.</p>
<p> Yes, there were various models consulted, but when we sat down we wanted</p>
<p> to act in the national interest. And these issues are difficult. I mean,</p>
<p> I know in parts of Queensland there'll be some people who may have some</p>
<p> criticism, but I appeal to all those people regardless of where they are</p>
<p> to think about the national interest because the people who lose today</p>
<p> are the criminals, the people who have illegal handguns. We're talking</p>
<p> about concealed handguns and frankly, I agree with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p> I think that is simply unacceptable in a civilised society to have people</p>
<p> with concealed handguns who are not involved in some law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister threatened to put a curse on Queensland New South</p>
<p> Wales and South Australia over its intransigence over this matter. I mean,</p>
<p> have relations gotten better since then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>… a colouful phrase…</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>… Well let me put it in these terms. I've never felt way about</p>
<p> the Prime Minister. He's always…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p> PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>He's always been very warm in relation to Queensland and I know it's</p>
<p> one of his favourite places…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>And I'm hoping to encourage him to holiday very recently.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Queensland treats me very well, too, so…</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>[inaudible] I';m not quite sure…</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In terms of the amnesty, what period are we talking about and do you</p>
<p> have any estimates on what the totality the buy-back might be in terms</p>
<p> of the cost?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The amnesty's from the 1st of July 2003 until the 1st of January 2004.</p>
<p> The estimates vary quite a lot. I'm not going to at this stage commit</p>
<p> myself to a precise figure, I'm really not going to do that. They do vary</p>
<p> a lot. Could I just take up the point that Phil Hudson asked about watering</p>
<p> down, our position always was that providing you could have a sensible</p>
<p> discipline carve-out for genuine sporting shooters you should get rid</p>
<p> of the rest and that's essentially what's happened.</p>
<p>PREMIER BRACKS:</p>
<p>Could I just add on to those comments from the Prime Minister to talk</p>
<p> also that a resolution today is almost three times as strong as that which</p>
<p> was recommended by the Police Minister. This is toughened up. This is</p>
<p> 20% of handguns coming out of the community. This is a very strong robust</p>
<p> regime and one which makes us much safer.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It does go, in two important respects, significantly beyond the Police</p>
<p> Ministers' recommendation. I mean, that is the point.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How many types of handguns? The Police Ministers have previously discussed</p>
<p> it in numbers of types, how many types of handguns will be banned and</p>
<p> do you know how many individual guns?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think we are banning some hundreds, I think about 350, 300 - 350.</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>But it doesn't remove though - we need to be really clear - it doesn't</p>
<p> remove the competitiveness for Olympic gold medallists or Commonwealth</p>
<p> gold medallists to get on and be internationally competitive and that's</p>
<p> the strength. It protects the community but allows our athletes to be</p>
<p> able to compete and train.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] last Police Ministers' meeting looked at an option of up</p>
<p> to 400 types of handguns. Do you believe that the argument over funding</p>
<p> effectively ruled that off the table?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, in the end the funding thing did not result in a weaker arrangement.</p>
<p> Can I make that clear. It would be wrong of anybody to go away from here</p>
<p> thinking that in some way because of money we ended up with a weaker regime.</p>
<p> We ended up with a regime that does exactly what Peter Beattie said. It</p>
<p> takes the guns away from people who shouldn't have them other than those</p>
<p> who want to engage in Olympic, Commonwealth Games and other recognised</p>
<p> sporting shooting events. And that was the template that I had in mind</p>
<p> when I started talking about this a couple of months ago and I';m</p>
<p> personally very happy with this outcome. It's beyond the Police Ministers.</p>
<p> It's tougher than what they recommended and I think it will be very widely</p>
<p> welcomed in the community. But the sporting shooters have been properly</p>
<p> accommodated and I think any reasonable sporting shooter will see this</p>
<p> as a fair outcome. There will be some people unhappy with it, that's always</p>
<p> the case, but I think by and large a reasonable sporting shooter will</p>
<p> say, well, in an ideal world we might have wished it hadn't happened but</p>
<p> we don't live in an ideal world, we have lunatics in the community, criminals,</p>
<p> who want to use guns and the Governments have done the right thing by</p>
<p> the public but they've also given us an opportunity to continue our sport</p>
<p> under proper conditions and restrictions. And I think that is the sensible</p>
<p> outcome and it's an outcome that Australians will welcome.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What progress was made on water property rights reform?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Water property rights reform, what progress was made?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we discussed the issue. There's obviously a range of views on it.</p>
<p> The concrete things to come out of today's meeting is that we've agreed</p>
<p> to circulate the paper prepared by the Chief Executives' COAG paper and</p>
<p> that details a possible water rights regime. We'll be seeking reaction</p>
<p> on that. That was something that we always knew would need to be the procedure.</p>
<p> There are a range of views on it and obviously there will be debate in</p>
<p> the future on funding. The Commonwealth put on the table a paper outlining</p>
<p> its position. That was noted but obviously not agreed at this stage. I</p>
<p> didn't expect it to be and I didn't seek agreement for it but it's certainly</p>
<p> on the table. Our position is known. The Premiers made their contributions</p>
<p> and outlined the approaches they were taking. This is a difficult issue.</p>
<p> I think we've made a good start. I think there's a recognition of the</p>
<p> need to have, I think, a nationally compatible approach. There will be</p>
<p> debate about points at which compensation becomes payable. There'll be</p>
<p> some who will say it should be the certain point, others will say it should</p>
<p> be a later. We haven't attempted to reach agreement on that but we've</p>
<p> opened the batting and scored a few runs and haven't lost any wickets.</p>
<p> So I think that's a good start.</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>Sorry, before we do this can I just answer your question on this, because</p>
<p> you initially raised it with me, I';m sorry, I just want to make</p>
<p> it clear. I';m not complaining Prime Minister, there are times when</p>
<p> I prefer these questions to go to you Prime Minister and this one, in</p>
<p> fact I';d like to refer a few more your way. But Prime Minister there</p>
<p> are just two points I want to make in this, Queensland';s obviously</p>
<p> signed off on this issue in terms of the COAG agreement today and the</p>
<p> communique, we have clear views on it but there are two things that are</p>
<p> not understood properly in my view. One is that we do need to have, if</p>
<p> we';re going to have reform in relation to water and salinity, and</p>
<p> the Prime Minister';s led in the relation to the issue of salinity</p>
<p> and the states have signed up previously to support the Prime Minister';s</p>
<p> initiative in salinity. But we need to maintain clear ability to bring</p>
<p> about reform and to do it in a way that protects the environment, to give</p>
<p> blanket property rights in my view at an early stage without those reforms</p>
<p> would deny that. Secondly, and I want to make this very clear 'cause this</p>
<p> is not understood in this debate, we have in Queensland and other states</p>
<p> have the same thing, particularly New South Wales, water resource management</p>
<p> plans which are for a period of time, for example 10 years. If there is</p>
<p> any alteration to the water allocation during those 10 years then people</p>
<p> are entitled to compensation, now that is guaranteed by legislation, my</p>
<p> government bought that in recently, the Prime Minister';s made the</p>
<p> point about the need for that to be done at a national level and for co-ordination</p>
<p> and I share his view about it. But don';t anyone think that there</p>
<p> is not already in place as part of water resource management strategies</p>
<p> appropriate compensation if those plans are put in place that are environmentally</p>
<p> and socially sustainable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What will be the penality for continuing to have these guns after the</p>
<p> amnesty';s over?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Severe. I think there are some jail terms aren';t there? Yes there</p>
<p> will be some jail terms. Look I just can';t tell you precisely, there</p>
<p> will be very severe penalties. If they';re not severe enough there';ll</p>
<p> be made even more severe.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister does this ban include those models of guns used in the</p>
<p> Monash shootings.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it takes out all but one or two.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>… Premiers and Chief Ministers believe they have an obligation</p>
<p> under competition policy to compensate farmers for lost water rights?</p>
<p>BRACKS:</p>
<p>Well the question';s premature.</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>Cause this is being evaluated now, the discussion papers are being released,</p>
<p> we all express views, that';s an issue for the future, I';ve</p>
<p> already spelled out my answer to you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does that mean no?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No look I agree with my two colleagues, on both the left and the right,</p>
<p> that this, that is premature, we have as I said opened the batting on</p>
<p> it and we';ll just see how the game progresses, but we';ve started.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>John Anderson wasn';t allowed to come to the wicket, were you disappointed</p>
<p> that the other leaders wouldn';t let him in the room?</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>Oh look the basic decision was that we felt that the whole COAG process</p>
<p> is focused around the leaders and it';s no discourtesy to John, that';s</p>
<p> a very important principle, I have a high regard for John personally,</p>
<p> it';s no discourtesy to him, it';s the process and this is where</p>
<p> leaders sit down.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Given they';ve got a clean sweep of the states, do you think it</p>
<p> was a little churlish of them to lock Mr Anderson out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I';m in furious agreement with everybody and most particularly</p>
<p> the Deputy Prime Minister and there';s no more a gracious and courteous</p>
<p> person in public life. But you know Peter';s expressed the view of</p>
<p> the Premiers and a very non- rancorous meeting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Beattie, has Mr Anderson';s contribution to this debate been</p>
<p> helpful?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Are you talking to me?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No Mr Beattie.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mr Anderson';s contributions are always helpful.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No Mr Beattie.</p>
<p>PREMIER BEATTIE:</p>
<p>Of course he is, you';ve got to remember this is an open society,</p>
<p> it';s a democracy, people are entitled to express their views. What</p>
<p> we';re simply trying to do here is to manage a very complex issue</p>
<p> in a structure way which is what';s been agreed today. You';ve</p>
<p> got to remember this issue is close to the heart of a lot of people but</p>
<p> we want to have long-term land management strategies which are sustainable.</p>
<p> What';s forgotten in this debate is, and I don';t see it in</p>
<p> any of the reports people write about this, and I say this with respect</p>
<p> to all of you, that we have already legislated for compensation provided</p>
<p> there was a water resource plan in place that takes into regard not just</p>
<p> social implications but environmental implications for the future. Now</p>
<p> no-one can sensibly suggest to me in an arid nation that we should pursue</p>
<p> plans and strategies that don';t take into account river flows, land</p>
<p> use, salinity, I mean that would be simply insane. Now we want to keep</p>
<p> appropriate powers in place until we get the reforms to protect the land.</p>
