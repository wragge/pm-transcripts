F76/ 165<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 12 August 1976<br />
WAGE CASE DECISION<br />
The Commnission's decision should add impetus to economic<br />
recovery which is already underway.<br />
It will particularly assist manufacturers and businessmen as<br />
it will allow them to plan ahead and plan for expansion with<br />
greater certainty. It will help stabilise the economic climate.<br />
It will allow businesses to free the money for investment that<br />
would have been used up-in wages if the full 2.5 percent<br />
CPI increase had been-granted~ across the board.<br />
Clearly, the Commission has largely recognised that<br />
recovery of the Australian economy depends on continuing wage<br />
restraint. It has understood and taken into account the government argument<br />
that unemployment will not be controlled until both inflation<br />
and the level of industrial disputes are reduced.<br />
The decision will also have a further dampening affect on<br />
the growth of inflation which will add considerably to consumer<br />
confidence.<br />
The Government believes that most Australians now recognise<br />
the link between excessive wage increases and inflation.<br />
We will continue to intervene before the Commission as strongly<br />
as possible in the interests or our national economic objectives.<br />
