TEXT OF ADDRESS GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE CEDA LECTURE<br />
" AUSTRALIA IN THE WORLD ECONOMY" 1<br />
Under the title " Australia in the world economy" I want to talk<br />
about two aspects of Australia's economic situation, as it<br />
relates to the international economic scene.<br />
First of all I will comment on our domestic economic situation<br />
in international perspective and then discuss the changing<br />
character of the Australian and world economies and what this<br />
means for Australian policy.<br />
The debate over, policy in both these areas is inevitably<br />
concerned with the way in which economic policy and social<br />
policy ought to be linked.<br />
Economic policy cannot be divorced from our aspirations for<br />
Australia and for our way of life.<br />
Very often this requires a balance to be struck between<br />
short-term and long-term considerations, between the policy which<br />
will produce the most rapid growth in our material standard<br />
of living and policies which foster the wider range of individual<br />
and national goals.<br />
Many of the economic problems which Australia is now seeking to<br />
resolve have sprung from the failure to find an adequate<br />
reconciliation of economic and social objectives, or to<br />
realistically assess the inter-action of the two.<br />
In particular there developed a view that we could progress<br />
more rapidly towards a number of social objectives through a<br />
dramatic expansion of Government expenditure, and more rapidly<br />
towards some economic objectives by sharp changes of policy in<br />
some areas.<br />
Inevitably problems resulted. Nor was Australia entirely alone<br />
in this, though perhaps we were an extreme case.<br />
In recent years, indeed, most of the industrialised economies<br />
have been beset with problems.<br />
As a result questions were being raised about the future of the<br />
market-oriented economic system that operates in Australia and<br />
countries outside the Eastern Bloc.<br />
A whole industry of doom-saying sprang up, and for a while<br />
appeared to be flourishing. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Today we hear less of such talk.<br />
Most of those countries and Australia among them have turned<br />
back from the precipice.<br />
Along with most other countries with free enterprise economies<br />
we have started once again to apply policies which pay regard<br />
both to economic realities and to social needs.<br />
Sir Douglas Copland, who was the founder of this Association,<br />
and in whose honour this lecture was established, was a<br />
proponent of the need for more resources to be shifted to the<br />
public sector.<br />
Born a New Zealander, Sir Douglas was not afraid to tell Australians<br />
or others for that matter how he thought they should mould<br />
their futures.<br />
His courage and imagination as exemplified in the title of one<br />
of his last books " The Adventure of Growth" must be admired.<br />
However, his well-known criticism of Australia in the immediate<br />
post war period as a " milk bar" economy reflected an approach<br />
which, boiled down to its basic tenets, sought to substitute<br />
the judgements of the few for the choices, freely expressed<br />
through the market system, of the many.<br />
So far as those judgements involve as they do for example in<br />
the writings of economists such as Galbraith expansion of<br />
public sector spending programs, they were challenged<br />
even then by other economists.<br />
The experience of recent years shows very clearly that substantial<br />
public sector expansion can stimulate inflation and that this<br />
inflation, can put at risk social and economic progress.<br />
Most major overseas countries have now realised that they were<br />
pursuing policies that exacerbated inflation. It has been further<br />
recognised that these policies were also resulting in growing<br />
unemployment. True, some are doing more about it than others.<br />
Nevertheless, given the widely different complexions of the<br />
various Governments, the degree of consensus on the general<br />
economic strategy that should be pursued if there is to be<br />
sustained economic expansion is remarkable.<br />
In the words of the communique following the OECD Ministerial<br />
meeting in June this year " the basic premise on which this<br />
strategy rests, is that the steady growth needed to restore full<br />
employment and satisfy rising economic and social aspirations will<br />
not prove sustainable unless all member countries make further<br />
progress towards eradicating inflation"<br />
In the light of this agreed approach, all OECD Governments have<br />
accepted that considerable care will have to be exercised to<br />
ensure that economic recovery proceeds gradually and steadily<br />
so as to avoid any resurgency of inflationary pressures. / 13 </p>
<p>They have recognised that the high level of unemployment, while<br />
a cause for considerable concern, is not capable of a quick<br />
solution: the OECD Ministerial Communique stated that<br />
" 1restoration of full employment and normal levels of capacity<br />
in the OECD area will be progressive and take a number of<br />
years." Boiled down to simpler language, this means that when our<br />
economies have been allowed to get into the state that many<br />
of them are in and Australia's more than most there are<br />
no magic wands available.<br />
We no longer have any real choice about the kinds of policy to<br />
be followed.<br />
O. E. C. D. countries generally have rejected broad stimulatory<br />
action as a means of reducing unemployment.<br />
When inflation remains a threat, restoring steady growth and<br />
reducing unemployment is achievable not by increasing Government<br />
expenditure but by reducing the rate of growth of such expenditure,<br />
and adopting policies such as lightening the tax burden and<br />
more appropriate monetary policies which such restraint makces<br />
possible. What people have come to regard as the Keynesian approach is now<br />
recognised to be inapplicable in current circumstances.<br />
Virtually all major countries have now proposed reductions in the<br />
rate of growth of central Government spending between their<br />
last fiscal year and their present one.<br />
In the United Kingdom from 28 to 17 percent<br />
In Canada from 19 to 13 percent<br />
In Germany from 19 to 4 percent<br />
In New Zealand from 29 to 5 percent<br />
In the United States from 13 to 9 percent<br />
And of course, Australia, from 23 to 11 percent.<br />
The Australian Government's policies are fully in line with<br />
this general OECD strategy.<br />
I know that there are many who are impatient to see the Australian<br />
economy back on its feet.<br />
Believe me, nobody wants that more than I and the Government<br />
which I lead.<br />
But what we all have to recognise is that we have a long haul<br />
ahead of us.<br />
Not only was the Australian economy in a much worse state than<br />
the economies of most other OECD countries but Australia has also<br />
made a much later start than most others in moving to bring<br />
inflation under control.<br />
This bears particularly on the problem of unemployment. / 4 </p>
<p>Even in those countries which were first to reduce inflation<br />
to more manageable levels, the reduction in unemployment has<br />
so far been comparatively moderate.<br />
In the United States, for example, unemployment in June was 8 percent<br />
compared with 9.1 percent a year earlier.<br />
In Germany unemployment has fallen over the last year from about<br />
4.4 percent to 4.0 percent.<br />
In other major countries unemployment in mid 1976 was higher<br />
than a year earlier.<br />
In the early stages of recovery unemployment may be slow to<br />
come down but if unemployment is to be reduced, and a sound basis<br />
for expanding job opportunities established, the policy approach<br />
we have adopted is the only one.<br />
In Australia-and overseas the lesson is clear. Governments<br />
cannot spend their way out of recession when inflation is running<br />
as it has been.<br />
To attempt to do so would lead, perhaps after a short burst in<br />
activity, to a deepening of the recession and a worsening of<br />
unemployment. There can be no better demonstration of the inappropriateness<br />
of the tradition " pump-priming" approach in periods of rapid<br />
inflation than to look at the record in Australia.<br />
In 1974/ 75 budget expenditures increased by 46 percent and the<br />
deficit rose by almost $ 2,300 million.<br />
In 19 75/ 76 there was a further increase. in expenditure of 23 percent<br />
It would have been much greater but for the direct and indirect<br />
measures the Government took over the latter part of the year.<br />
The deficit rose by a further $ 1,000 million to $ 3,585 million.<br />
Over this period there was an increase of more than 30 percent<br />
in prices.<br />
Yet over this same period there was negligible growth in real<br />
output and Unemployment increased by over 200,000.<br />
The facts are well known.<br />
Let me repeat here the situation which the Government faced when<br />
it came to office at the end of 1975:<br />
At that time the private sector was employing no more people<br />
than it had been 3 years earlier, even though during that period<br />
the labour force had expanded by about 370,000.<br />
Unemployment had risen to a level not recorded in this country<br />
since the 1930' s.<br />
Gross non-farm product in the December quarter of 1975 was still<br />
almost 5 percent below its peak level recorded two years earlier.<br />
The farm sector was in a state of collapse. </p>
<p>The share of company profits in national income remained<br />
depressed at around three quarters of its long run norm.<br />
Real business fixed investment had fallen in the December<br />
quarter to its lowest level for almost 3 years.<br />
And, last but not least, the consumer price index in the<br />
December quarter was 14 percent above a year earlier and<br />
showed no real prospect of a sustained move down.<br />
Some have argued that Australia' s recent economic problems<br />
have had their origins overseas.<br />
External economic trends can and do affect the Australian<br />
economy through the operation of the overseas trade cycle.<br />
But, the structure of the Australian economy has altered over<br />
the post-war period, and we have a much improved capacity to<br />
absorb overseas economic fluctuations without large domestic<br />
effects. In the period 1973-75, for instance, the effect of overseas<br />
economic fluctuations was considerably diminished by:<br />
the broadening of our export base, and<br />
the associated contractual arrangements for<br />
a number of our major minerals exports.<br />
unlike most of the O. E. C. D. countries, we were<br />
also spared any significant direct impact from<br />
the large rise in oil prices overseas.<br />
Inflation overseas would have had some impact upon the<br />
Australian economy, but the pursuit of inappropriate<br />
domestic policies was the prime cause of the economic setback<br />
which we suffered during this period.<br />
The large expansion in Government spending which occurred in<br />
1973 took place at a time when it was clear that private demand<br />
pressures were already excessive.<br />
The Government had come to office in December 1972 on the<br />
false proposition that the economy was headed into a slump.<br />
It became a victim of its own propoganda.<br />
We can see today a similar attempt from the same quarters, to<br />
" talk down" the economy in the hope of electoral advantage.<br />
Then, when the economy none the less fell into recession in 1974<br />
there was the attempt to continue to drive it along by an even<br />
greater boost in Government spending.<br />
Then, when the moment of truth came in last year's budget there<br />
was a frantic effort to slash back the rate of growth of spending.<br />
Of course that moment of truth was just that momentary.<br />
Compounding the problem was the Government's attitude to wages<br />
and salaries in 1973 and 1974.<br />
For quite some time large wage rises were actually encouraged and<br />
supported by the then Commonwealth Government before the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. High unemployment,<br />
combined with high inflation, were inevitable consequences. 6 </p>
<p>In the present situation, the speed with which the recovery<br />
will progress is largely a function of the speed with which<br />
real wages and productivity can be brought into balance.<br />
The amount of wage restraint accepted by the trade union<br />
movement will play a vital role in this.<br />
Wage restraint in the months ahead could help significantly<br />
to speed up the process of reducing unemployment.<br />
It should not be overlooked that the drop in unemployment<br />
in the United States over the past year or so followed a<br />
period of wage and salary restraint.<br />
It is now clear that the rapid real wage gains in Australia<br />
in 1974 were partly at the expense of thosewho lost their jobs.<br />
Those who are in a position to influence wage demands and those in<br />
a position to influence their outcome would do well to ponder these<br />
realities. Restraint now will also make possible a more normal growth in<br />
real wages to resume in the shortest possible time.<br />
The experience of the recent past has particularly affected<br />
those groups in the community most vulnerable to unemployment<br />
the young, the disadvantaged and the unskilled workers.<br />
The large increase in the real level of the minimum wage, for<br />
instance, has been cold comfort to the many unskilled workers<br />
who have lost their jobs during the recession because employers<br />
could no longer afford to keep them on.<br />
Their labour had become too expensive relative to their more<br />
skilled workmates.<br />
Similarly many young people have found employment difficult to<br />
obtain as the relative rates of pay of juniors to adults have<br />
increased. In recent years wage-fixing decisions affecting the minimum wage,<br />
and certain other wage relativities have aimed to improve the<br />
position of those at the lower end of the income scale.<br />
It is easy to understand this approach.<br />
But when that improvement is sought through the wage system<br />
regard also needs to be had to its implications for the employment<br />
prospects of those affected.<br />
The present high rates of unemployment among such groups are a<br />
harsh reminder that the wage system may not be the best mechanism<br />
for giving effect to social considerations in these matters.<br />
Here as elsewhere, decisions taken for the best of motives may<br />
have quite undesirable consequences.<br />
The art of Government is to be able to strike the right balance<br />
between considerations of different kinds. Throughout Australia's<br />
history that problem has had to be faced. </p>
<p>One of the clearest lessons to emerge from the experience of<br />
recent years is that social policies undertaken in disregard<br />
of economic realitics can not only be economically disastrous<br />
they can be socially damaging as well.<br />
Those who are economically disadvantaged through no fault of<br />
their own, should be able to look to Governments for assistance.<br />
This is a much better way of handling the problems than by<br />
distorting the wage structure.<br />
The Government has in fact adopted a number of measures to help<br />
low income groups.<br />
In particular the new family allowances scheme is a most<br />
important step towards the alleviation of poverty in Australia<br />
and is much more efficient and equitable than the previous arrangements<br />
The effect of all' the measures taken by the Government in the<br />
Budget and in the major statement on 20 May is in fact estimated<br />
to increase average disposable income somewhat in real terms in<br />
1976/ 77. D<br />
I have no doubt that the more we can achieve restraint in wage<br />
and salary demands the greater will be the reduction in<br />
unemployment and the larger the increase in total real earnings.<br />
A 1 percent reduction in unemployment would result in increased<br />
wages of about $ 600 million in 1976/ 77.<br />
It is pleasing to see that the approach the Government has<br />
adopted is winning wide acceptance increasingly I believe by<br />
wage and salary earners, by the Arbitration Commission, and by<br />
business. Businesses, for example, have indicated their confidence in<br />
the Government's policies by the announcement of major<br />
investment proposals totalling almost $ 3 billion in the last<br />
6 months.<br />
So far I have been discussing economic problems Australia<br />
has shared with other countries but has suffered in an acute form.<br />
Let me now turn to consider another aspect of our economic<br />
situation the changing structure of the Australian and world<br />
economy and the implications of those changes for policy.<br />
Here again the interaction-of social and economic objectives has<br />
had, and must continue to have, an important place in our consideratiol<br />
of appropriate policy.<br />
This last quarter of a century has seen marked changes in the<br />
structure of the Australian economy, encouraged in part by<br />
deliberate social policy.<br />
Those changes have affected the nature of our economic<br />
relationships with the outside world.<br />
Most significantly, the manufacturing and service industries have<br />
recorded a rapid expansion while the contribution of agriculture<br />
to Australia's gross domestic product declined around 25 percent<br />
in 1950 to less than 10 percent in 1973/ 74. </p>
<p>The mineral industry has also grown rapidly, although still<br />
accounting for less than 4 percent of total output in 1973/ 74.<br />
While we remain relatively large importers of capital equipment,<br />
we now manufacture a-wide range of consumer goods.<br />
our export base has been considerably broadened and diversified.<br />
Products broadly defined as manufactured now constitute between<br />
one-firth and one-quarter of total exports, as do minerals.<br />
The latter have been the fastest growth items in more recent years.<br />
Rural industry has also broadened its base, notably by expansion<br />
of the sugar and beef cattle industries.<br />
We continue,, of course, as the world's largest exporter of wool<br />
and one of the most important exporters of wheat.<br />
Overall, however, our rual exports have declined from around<br />
percent of the total to less than 50 percent.<br />
These and other similar developments reflect a diversification<br />
and broadening of the Australian economy and of our trading<br />
and financial relationships with the rest of the world.<br />
Interdependence there has always been. I<br />
Both its nature, and its extent, have been changing.<br />
We now live in a world which is much more complex, more diverse<br />
in its economic relationships and inter-relationships.<br />
Twenty five years ago the world seemed to many comparatively<br />
settled in its economic relationships and patters of trade.<br />
The non-communist world generally was dominated by the United<br />
States economy.<br />
The world of Commonwealth countries was dominated by Britain.<br />
It is difficult now to appreciate that the dominance of<br />
Commonwealth preferences in our external trade, * and sterling in<br />
our payments and reserves, should have disappeared in such a<br />
comparatively short period.<br />
Today, the United States economy remains the most powerful.<br />
But there are other economic forces notably Japan and Germanyof<br />
much greater relative power than formerly, with which Australia<br />
does not have automatic historical links.<br />
In this changed and changing world we have to make our own way<br />
to a much greater extent.<br />
We have to fight for mnarkets and for access to technology which<br />
formerly came more or less automatically.<br />
We have also to think about the type of economic system within<br />
which we want to trade and develop. / 9 </p>
<p>Australia has long supported the idea of commodity agreements<br />
where such agreements could contribute to greater stability<br />
in international commodity trade.<br />
At the same timie we have tak~ en the view that any such agreements would<br />
need to have regard to underlying market trends and to be practical<br />
both in terms of implementation and financing.<br />
Proposals made by the developing countries over recent years<br />
under the heading " New International Economic Order" envisage<br />
significant, indeed fundamental changes in the present economic<br />
system. Some proposals for commodity agreements, for instance, envisage<br />
that such agreements would be used to transfer resources to<br />
developing countries, by effecting significant price increases<br />
just as the OPEC countries have done in respect of oil prices.<br />
It would not be appropriate here to comment in detail on this<br />
or various other proposals for radical changes in the international<br />
economic system.<br />
Undoubtedly the developing countries need to be able to improve<br />
their standards of living.<br />
Great differences in economic situations between nations, which<br />
are seen to be unreasonable, can unsettle political relationships.<br />
It does not, however, follow that such differences can be<br />
rectified by fundamental changes in the international economic<br />
system. Indeed, many of the changes proposed in the " New International<br />
Economic Order seem likely to lead to less in the way of<br />
development benefits rather than more.<br />
This is because the imbalance between nations lies much less in<br />
the economic system as such than in the policies pursued by some<br />
nations and the historical facts of world economic development.<br />
Because of our geographic position, and our importance as a<br />
supplier of resources, this is a matter of particular importance<br />
for Australia.<br />
We must remain sensitive to the legitimate aspirations of the<br />
developing countries while at the same time supporting<br />
proposals that not only accord with own fundamental economic<br />
interests but also in our judgement with those of the developing<br />
countries themselves.<br />
Associated with the emergence of new and powerful economic forces<br />
in the world there has been a considerable loosening up in external<br />
economic relationships.<br />
For example, there has been a greater preparedness to allow market<br />
forces to operate in the field of trade and payments.<br />
This is by no means universal: important restrictions remain on<br />
international trade, especially on trade in agricultural products<br />
and on capital flows. </p>
<p>We retain, for good reasons, a number of such restrictions<br />
ourselves. By and large, however, it seems fair to say that the last<br />
quarter century has seen a considerable liberalisation<br />
of world trade and payments.<br />
These and other developments in world economic and political<br />
relationships have, I believe, made Australia more reliant<br />
on its own resources and skills.<br />
The apron strings to Britain even to the Anglo-Saxon world<br />
more generally have loosened and frayed and we are today<br />
exposed to a much more diverse, complex set of economic patterns<br />
and flows.<br />
Even as our general interdependence has increased so has our<br />
particular independence.<br />
In this situation there is a balance to be struck between<br />
allowing the operation of purely economic forces and intervening<br />
in the international flow of trade and capital on what might<br />
be described as " non-economic" grounds.<br />
In-the case of Australia, as in other countries, there is a<br />
tradition of intervention in trade flows..<br />
Over the years we have intervened to enable secondary industry<br />
to develop to the point where it is now as large, relatively as<br />
in most so-called advanced industrialised economies.<br />
Indeed it is now about the same relative size as the secondary<br />
sector in the United States economy.<br />
While we should not overlook the natural advantaged that has<br />
assisted part of that growth, there is no doubt also that a<br />
considerable part of it has been due to the protection that has<br />
been given against foreign competition.<br />
Policies of successive Australian Governments have embraced<br />
tariff protection and other measures designed to ensure the<br />
development of a well balanced economy.<br />
This has included:<br />
an adequate manufacturing base to assist in employing<br />
a growing population<br />
and the rcslience to meet the pressures and crises of a<br />
changing and at times threatening world.<br />
Considerable political importance has been attached to peopling<br />
a continent with substantial natural resources but a relatively<br />
small population.<br />
Nor should we overlook the desire of the Australian people to<br />
create a nation that was not just a hewer of wood and drawer of<br />
water for the industrialised world.<br />
In the last few decades, the Australian economy could be said to<br />
have come of age in a structural sense.<br />
It has an extensively developed industrial sector, efficient large </p>
<p>scale rural industrics, a major mining industry which is a<br />
source of basic materials to the giant industrial economies<br />
of the-northern hemisphere and a highly developed structure<br />
of commercial and governmental services to its people.<br />
There can be no turning back from this situation. There can be<br />
no question, for instance, that the Australian economy must<br />
continue to have a substantial manufacturing sector.<br />
This is not to say, however, that questions should not be<br />
raised about the balance between particular industries or within<br />
such industries.<br />
It is in our own interest to make the most efficient possible<br />
use of our resources and to envisage change which helps us to do<br />
SO. In essence, the choice is between higher and lower rates of<br />
economic growth, to the extent that we restrict international<br />
trade and capital movements we tend to forego the opportunity<br />
to have a higher rate of economic growth per head of population.<br />
It should not be necessary to say that economic growth is<br />
imporant.<br />
Expectations of rising standards of living cannot be fulfilled<br />
beyond the limits of the resources available to fulfill them.<br />
It is the rate of economic growth which determines the pace at<br />
which our economy and our society can meet the aspirations<br />
of our citizens.<br />
But that having been said, wve must think beyond economic growth.<br />
Just as individuals have a choice between work and leisure,<br />
governments must often choose policies that are in the broader<br />
national interest), even at some sacrifice of economic growth.<br />
There is a delicate balance to be struck.<br />
To some extent a country's sense of well-being is a relative one.<br />
If Australia falls behind other countries economically, this sense<br />
of well-being will be to that extent reduced. To;; the extent that<br />
we forego our full potential for economic growth, we will be less<br />
able to help the poor and the disadvantaged, both within our own<br />
community and overseas.<br />
We must take this into account in the field of protection policy,<br />
while at the same time ensuring that any significant changes in<br />
levels of protection will not be too sudden or severe.<br />
We will not embark on such foolish ventures as the previous<br />
Government's 25 percent across-the-board tariff cut in 1973.<br />
A reduction which was forecast at the time to involve a loss of<br />
33,000 jobs, it was,' in effect, a decision to export those jobs<br />
overseas. We know the sad effects on many industries of changes that are<br />
too drastic, too sudden. </p>
<p>Indeed the previous Government was forced to reverse engines in<br />
that area and to provide additional protection to certain<br />
industries affected by an unprecedented upsurge in imports.<br />
These additional restrictions,-which now cover about 10 percent<br />
of total imports, are in full accordance with our international<br />
obligations. They have been designed specifically to alleviate potential<br />
serious disruption and will be removed, or replaced by appropriate<br />
long term arrangements, as soon as circumstances permit.<br />
It is important however that we should not delude ourselves that<br />
external policies can be used to assure employment in circumstances<br />
where pressure for domestic wage and price increases remain<br />
excessive. If increased protection is provided in such circumstances, whether<br />
through tariff increases or by other means, it will tend to be<br />
dissipated fairly quickly, leaving the competitive situation much<br />
as it was before.<br />
Many countries using " floating" exchange -rates over recent years<br />
have found that the unemployment effects of rapidly escalating<br />
money wage rates cannot be remedied simply by allowing their<br />
exchange rates to depreciate.<br />
There is no alternative to the pursuit of appropriate domestic<br />
policies to bring inflation under control. This is precisely<br />
what the Government is endeavouring to do.<br />
Our economic future will always depend in part on the caprice of<br />
changing international economic circumstances.<br />
However, with appropriate management of our economic affairs,<br />
we have the capacity to re-establish satisfactory growth in<br />
the Australian economy and to reduce unemployment progressively.<br />
Australia's economic problems arise because of the past pursuit<br />
of inappropriate policies in some cases for many years past.<br />
In these circumstances, solutions are not to be found through<br />
drastic or sudden action.<br />
That would be both economically and socially divisive and<br />
disruptive. Lasting solutions can only be found if the majority of the<br />
people understand and support the basic thrust of the Government's<br />
policies. We believe that the Australian people today do increasingly<br />
understand and support those policies.<br />
Internationally also, Australian Governments will need to continue<br />
to strike a balance between pursuing an independent course of<br />
action and further exposure to the flow of world trade and payments.<br />
As in other areas of our national life, there are policy choices<br />
to be made.<br />
Australia cannot afford to pursue courses,,' f action that would<br />
isolate us from external competition. </p>
<p>As in our domestic affairs, we must face up to the reality<br />
of a competitive outside world.<br />
If we fail to do so, we will run the risk, ultimately, of<br />
becoming a country of second raters.<br />
We have vast natural resources to develop.<br />
If we are to do so, we need to employ our capital and our<br />
labour force as efficiently as possible.<br />
In this field, as in others, the task and the challenge are<br />
ahead of us.<br />
In meeting this challenge we will continue to face the task of<br />
reconciling our economic and social objectives.<br />
Recent experience has made it plain that unless we recognize<br />
economic reality we will fail both in our economic and in our<br />
social objectives as a nation.<br />
There is no way around the fundamental fact that resources are<br />
scarce. Our policies must aim to expand the resources available<br />
to us, because only in that way can Australians hope to realise so<br />
many of their aspirations.<br />
We have seen only too clearly what happens when aspirations run<br />
ahead of resources.<br />
At the same time our policies for growth must also minimize the<br />
social costs of growth.<br />
Achieving that delicate balance is one of our great challenges<br />
as a nation.<br />
As a Government and as a country we cannot afford to fail.<br />
