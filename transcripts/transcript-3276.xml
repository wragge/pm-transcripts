EMBARGOED: 7.30 P. M.<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, QC, MP,<br />
WEDNESDAY 29 MAY 1974<br />
Eleven days ago, we all voted to elect a new House of<br />
Representatives and an entirely new Senate. Any doubt or delay<br />
in the outcome stemmed not from any indecision on the part of<br />
the electors, but from the complexity of our electoral laws.<br />
The thrust and and clear meaning of your decision is beyond doubt.<br />
You have returned the Government which you elected less than<br />
18 months ago. You have returned us with a comfortable majority.<br />
You have strongly re-affirmed our program of 1972 to expand<br />
the opportunities for all Australians, and make those opportunities<br />
more equal for all Australians.<br />
In the House of Representatives, the House which decides<br />
who shall govern, which alone has the right and power to decide<br />
who shall govern, you have given us a solid working majority of<br />
at least five, maybe 7.<br />
Further, you have strengthened our position in the Senate.<br />
You will recall that the Governor-General granted a dissolution<br />
of both Houses on the grounds that the old Senate had twice<br />
rejected six bills. These were bills to provide for more equal<br />
electorates, two senators from each of the two territories,<br />
universal health insurance and the petroleum and minerals authority.<br />
These bills can now be passed and they will be.<br />
Finally although this does not . directly determine the<br />
results of Australian elections the percentage of Australians<br />
Voting for the Australian Labor Party, the percentage of Australians<br />
wanting th ' e return of this Government was decisively in our favour.<br />
Some 200,000 more men and women voted for ALP candidates than for<br />
the candidates of the Liberal and Country Parties, the D. L. P.<br />
and their offshoots.<br />
There should be no uncertainty in any quarter about our<br />
ability and determination to carry out our program and to provide<br />
strong, effective government, for the full term for which you have<br />
once again elected us.<br />
Let me emphasise two points. First, when parties in Australia<br />
go to the people, they present, or have a duty to present, programs<br />
designed for three years, the normal life of a Parliament. That's<br />
what we did in 1972, and again last month. Governments should<br />
be judged on their success or failure in that period. That was<br />
the true meaning behind our successful appeal to you for a fair go.<br />
You upheld that appeal.<br />
Secondly, the nation's business, particularly its economic<br />
affairs, may sometimes call for unpopular decisions. if a<br />
Government, unbeaten and unbeatable in the People's House, can be<br />
forced to an election by an irresponsible chance combination in<br />
the Senate any time the national interest demands tough decisions,<br />
then there is an end to firm, responsible Government. It would be<br />
the beginning of the end of strong parliamentary democracy in<br />
Australia. EMBARGOED: 7.30 P. M. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It is insupportable to suggest that the same upheaval we<br />
have just been through, the same falsification of democracy, to<br />
use Sir Robert Menzies' indelible phrase should ever again be<br />
attempted. It would not just be a question of holding an elected<br />
government to ransom; it would be a matter of holding our whole<br />
Parliamentary system to ransom.<br />
I note a commnent made repeatedly made that the elections<br />
polarised the Australian people that is to say, the poor vote<br />
of thn minor parties and your clear choice between the major<br />
part4-ies represented a sharp dividing of the people. This is SO<br />
much nonsense. What you have done and I congratulate you upon<br />
it is to restore the two-party system to a healthier state<br />
than it has been for twenty years. It is only a sound two-party<br />
system which has made democracy work effectively in the Englishspeaking<br />
world.<br />
So in two ways by rejecting the attempts of Senators to<br />
destroy a duly elected Government, and by restoring strength to<br />
the two-party system you have voted for strong parliamentary<br />
democracy. So this is not just our victory, victory for the team you<br />
elected in 1972 and confirmed in office eleven days ago. Not<br />
just victory for the programn we have tried to implement according<br />
to our pledges. It is your victory, the victory of an intelligent,<br />
aware and, I believe, a basically idealistic people. The support,<br />
the continued confidence of such a people is something profoundly<br />
worth having, and I value it beyond words.<br />
I recall that in the policy speech I said that we Australians<br />
all faced together one of the great historic challenges of our timeto<br />
make democracy work, to make the parliamentary system work and<br />
make it work better. You have responded splendidly to that*<br />
challenge. I said too that we shared with most nations of the world<br />
another challenge the problem of fighting inflation while<br />
fulfilling the wishes, hopes and needs of the nation, and protecting<br />
the weaker sections of the community. This is the continuing task<br />
not easy, not simple, but certainly not insuperable. it requires<br />
co-operation, it requires courage. I am confident we have those<br />
qualities in abundance in this nation.<br />
Exactly one month ago, I asked you to let us get with<br />
the job. We are back at work after the interruption. The Parliamen~ t<br />
will meet as soon as possible after the completion of counting<br />
for the Senate.<br />
The legislative program for the twenty-ninth Parliament will<br />
include the uncompleted business of the last Parliament outlined<br />
by the Queen when she opened the last session threp months ago.<br />
Its work will include the completion of our 1972 program and the<br />
cxpansion of that program as I foreshadowed in the policy speech<br />
one month ago national compensation, national superannuation,<br />
modernisation of Australia's soc'tal welfare system, labour retraining,<br />
help for home owners, national involvement in remodelling our cities<br />
and centres and rebuilding our-education system, the provision of<br />
care and education for pre-school children, the protection of<br />
Australia's resources and the promotion of Australian'ownership. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Fellow-Australians:<br />
The times ahead will not always be easy, but they can<br />
be exciting and purposeful. We face the future as a strong,<br />
prosperous, confident, united, respected nation. Together in the<br />
months and years ahead, we shall all go ahead together. </p>
