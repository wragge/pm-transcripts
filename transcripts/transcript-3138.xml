jAUSTHALIAL PRESS STATEMENT NO.<br />
January 1974<br />
Joint Statement by the Prime Minister, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam,<br />
and the Premier of South Australia, Mr Dunstan<br />
URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT SIGNED<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam and the Premier of<br />
South Australia, Mr Dunstan today signed an Urban and<br />
Regional Development Agreement which will provide assistance<br />
of more than $ 41 million for programs in South Australia<br />
this financial year.<br />
The South Australian Government is the first<br />
State Government to enter into such an Agreement which may<br />
be the initial step towards a long term agreement covering<br />
a wider range of urban and regional development programs.<br />
The signing of this comprehensive Agreement is.<br />
a tangible result of the desire of the Australian and<br />
South Australian Governments to co-operate to improve the<br />
day-to-day lives of South Australians.<br />
This Agreement covers financial assistance for:<br />
The South Australian Land Commission to make land<br />
available at a price people can afford.<br />
The development of Monarto to provide an alternative<br />
to existing cities<br />
The provision of sewerage and water supply to<br />
improve water-quality.<br />
The Area Improvement and the National Estate<br />
Programs.<br />

A total of e24 million is available as a 30 year loan at the<br />
long term bond rate with repayments deferred for the first ten<br />
years mainly to acquire large areas of land for urban use.<br />
The program is aimed directly at increasing the supply of<br />
serviced land on the market, making it available at a price<br />
people can afford to pay and which excludes or greatly reduces<br />
the speculative component, and at helping the co-ordination of<br />
urban development.<br />
Legislation to establish the South Australian Land Commission<br />
was passed by the State Government in October, 1973, and $ 8 million<br />
was made available by the Australian Government last financial year<br />
which was used to acquire 1,220 hectares of land.<br />
South Australia pioneered the program and has shown the way<br />
to other 8tates. It is expected that the first land will be<br />
put on the market in March. </p>
<p>IM'! NAYTO The Australian and South Australian Government have agreed to<br />
accept the Monarto Development Commission's first stage development<br />
plan which provides for a population target of between 25,000 and<br />
30,000 people by the end of 1983.<br />
The development program for this financial year includes land<br />
acquisition, investigations and studies, and furth~ r tree planting<br />
which is expected to cost about S7.5 million.<br />
Under the Agreement signed today, the Australian Government<br />
will supply z; 6 million, or 80 per cent of the total experditure<br />
whichever is the lesser amount, mainly by way of loans and matching<br />
grants. rThe development of iHonarto and growth centres in other Sta: tes<br />
is aimed at encouraging' the rapid development of a small number<br />
of regional growth centres as desirable alternatives to existing<br />
cities. The role of the iMonarto Development Commission is to plan and<br />
manage the development of Monarto and the attraction of population<br />
and industry to the new city. </p>

<p>SE. WERAGE Under the National Sewerage " rogram 25,750,000 will be<br />
made. available to remove existing backlog of unsewered<br />
premises and to improve sewerage treatment, the long term<br />
aim being to ensure that by 1982 all new homes can be<br />
connected to an environmentally adequate sewerage system.<br />
The program also covers the trea. tment of industrial wastes.<br />
An important underlying object ive is the protection of<br />
water supplies from pollution.<br />
This year the Program is being extended to cover smaller<br />
cities and the centres which will benefit from this extension<br />
in South Australia are Whyalla and I-it. Gambier.<br />
The funds will be made available in the form of 30% noninterest<br />
bearing non-repayable grants and the rest as loans<br />
at the long term bond rate.<br />
WATER SUPPLY<br />
Adelaide's water treatment scheme will be assisted under<br />
this agreement by the provision of 34.4 million this year. These<br />
funds will also be in the form of 350 grants and 70/ loans.<br />
Adelaide's water comes from local catchments and the River Murray.<br />
Both of these sources are contaminated and the city's water<br />
supply falls a long way short of international quality standards.<br />
The water tre: ltment scheme is aimed at completely eliminating this<br />
problem over the next 10 years. The various planned treatment<br />
works will be supplemented by measures to protect the water<br />
catchment areas wherover possible. </p>
<p>i'V~ UNT~ ES TATE<br />
A total of 1;: 866,000 will be made available for land<br />
acquisition, studies, restor-tion, preservation and improvement<br />
of landscapes and buildings of special significance.<br />
Under the Natdonal Estate Program in 1973/ 74v $ 262,000<br />
was provided to assist with 14 projects, and considerably<br />
more projects are expected to be undertaken this financial<br />
year. The Australian Government recently approved the establishment<br />
of an Australian Heritage Commission which will play a vital<br />
role in future programs when th-, necessary legislation is passed<br />
by the Australian Parliament.<br />
Projects approved in the program this financial year have<br />
been recommrended to the Minister for Urban and Regional<br />
Development, Tom Uren, by the Interim Committee on the National<br />
Estate.<br />
