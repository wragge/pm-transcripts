COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
OIL PRICING POLICY<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates,' 10 October 1968]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-In September 1965 the<br />
Government announced certain policy<br />
decisions regarding the use of Australian<br />
. indrigeenous acrudfe ofil. i Trhomse decisaions tweireon<br />
of the policy that the<br />
OGovernment was determined that local<br />
refineries use all the crude oil produced in<br />
Australia, and an announcement that the<br />
price to be paid by refineries for Australian<br />
crude would be SA3.14 a barrel at the<br />
* ustoms port at the refining centre nearest<br />
to the producing field. Any amounts of<br />
money that I shall mention during this<br />
speech will be in Australian dollars and<br />
cents. Included in this price was 67c<br />
a barrel as an incentive payment.* This<br />
arrangement was to finish on 17th September<br />
1970, and no decisions were announced<br />
as to what would happen after that date.<br />
At that time the Moonie field was the<br />
only one in operation. The production of<br />
the Moonie and Barrow fields was and is<br />
W comparatively small and the extra cost<br />
resulting from the crude oil they sell at<br />
S3.14 a barrel, together with freight costs<br />
paid by them around the Australian coast<br />
or through the pipeline is already included<br />
O, inv eryp eetrxotle nspirvicee so ili n fiAeludsst rawliear. e dSiusbcsoevqeureedn tlyin,<br />
Bass Strait by Esso-BHP. Oil from these<br />
fields should begin to flow in March 1969<br />
23801/ 68 and by September 1970 it is expected that<br />
the fields will be producing at over 250,000<br />
barrels of crude oil a day. During that<br />
period the fields may well produce in the<br />
vicinity of sixty million barrels of crude oil.<br />
The prospect of such large quantities of oil<br />
which refineries had to buy at a price so<br />
much higher than the price of imported oil<br />
obviously created a new problem and led<br />
to forecasts of considerable rises in prices<br />
of petrol and other petroleum products to<br />
the Australian consumer. Because of the<br />
effects that this would have throughout the<br />
economy generally the Government has<br />
most carefully studied the various problems<br />
raised and I have for some time been<br />
engaged in a series of negotiations with<br />
Australian oil producers and refiners.<br />
I now wish to inform the House that the<br />
Government reaffirms its policy that for a<br />
period of 10 years beginning on 18th September<br />
1970, refineries in Australia are to<br />
be required to process Australian crude oil<br />
in order to provide the full requirements<br />
of the Australian market for petroleum products.<br />
This is, of course, subject to the need<br />
for sufficient imports to meet the requirements<br />
in Australia for bitumen, lubricants<br />
and fuel oil in excess of quantities that can<br />
be realised from the Australian crude, which<br />
is deficient in these quantities but which is<br />
so rich in the lighter distillates-petroleum,<br />
kerosene, dieselene and so on. </p>
<p>Secondly, the Government announces as<br />
policy that for a period of 5 years after<br />
17th September 1970, when the present<br />
policy arrangements terminate, the price<br />
that refineries will be required to pay Australian<br />
producers will be import parity.<br />
Import parity is defined as the posted prices<br />
of overseas oil as of today, less the discounts<br />
allowed off those posted prices as of today,<br />
plus overseas freights at the most efficient<br />
and economic rates prevailing today plus<br />
wharfage where applicable. To this price<br />
will be added a sum for quality differential<br />
worked out by the modified Nelson method,<br />
this quality differential being added because<br />
of the richness of Australian crude in the<br />
lighter distillates. From the import parity<br />
price so arrived at there will be deducted a<br />
sum representing the average freight cost of<br />
delivering Australian oil to the refineries<br />
from the port of delivery by the most<br />
economical means possible. This will mean<br />
that as from September 1970 for a period of<br />
years the price payable for Australian<br />
crude oil should generally be neither higher<br />
nor lower than the price now payable today<br />
for overseas oil, except for the effect of<br />
Australian coastal freights, if any. This in<br />
turn should mean that as from that date the<br />
price of petrol products produced from<br />
Australian crude oil should not be higher<br />
than the price payable today for products<br />
produced today.<br />
I now come to the period between March<br />
1969 and September 1970, during which the<br />
present arrangement operates, during which<br />
the presently applying high prices for Australian<br />
crudes were agreed to be paid, and<br />
during which, as a result of that, significant<br />
increases in the cost of petroleum products<br />
have been suggested. I have already said<br />
that the cost of oil from Moonie and<br />
Barrow at those high prices has been<br />
absorbed in existing petrol prices, and no<br />
alteration is to be made to the prices payable<br />
for oil from those fields until after<br />
September 1970, when the import parity<br />
prices which I have described will apply. In<br />
the case of the oilfields discovered by Esso-<br />
BHP we have agreed by negotiation that<br />
there will be a reduction in the prices Australian<br />
refineries are required to pay up to<br />
September 1970. Our agreement is that<br />
Esso-BHP1 will altogether forgo the 67c a<br />
barrel known as the incentive allowance.<br />
In addition, Esso-BHP will allow refineries a further discount of 5c a barrel. Tresult<br />
is that between March 1969 and September<br />
1970 the price to be paid for oil from this<br />
field will be reduced from $ 3.14 a barrel to<br />
$ 2.42 a barrel at the customs port at the<br />
refining centre nearest to the producing<br />
field. After September 1970 the price payable<br />
for this oil to Esso-BHP will be import<br />
parity as already explained, and this, of<br />
course, will reduce the price still further.<br />
To sum up, the new arrangements made<br />
will mean that the large newly discovered<br />
quantities of Australian oil to be used between<br />
March 1969 and September 1970 will<br />
cost 72c a barrel or a little over 2c a gallon<br />
les than was previously anticipated. After<br />
September 1970 the price payable for Australian<br />
crudes will be, as I have said, no<br />
more than the price of imported overseas<br />
crudes today except for any extra costs<br />
involved in coastal transportation, and will<br />
be still less than the price payable between<br />
March 1969 and September 1970. This<br />
will not, between March 1969 and September<br />
1970, in itself prevent any increase<br />
in the price of petrol for other products but<br />
it will undoubtedly very materially reduce<br />
the size of any rise that might take place<br />
or that would have taken place had this<br />
agreement not been reached.<br />
I have so far spoken only of the pricing<br />
policy for Australian crudes and of the<br />
Government's requirement that the Australian<br />
market should be supplied from such<br />
crudes. But we need to discover more oil<br />
in Australia and the Government is therefore<br />
currently studying the separate question<br />
of the need for incentives for oil exploration<br />
in the period after 17th September<br />
1970. Various proposals are under examination<br />
and we will in due course announce the<br />
form of incentive, if any, which we will<br />
adopt. In the meantime the arrangements 1<br />
have just announced will provide a firm<br />
basis upon which the refining industry can<br />
plan ahead for the use of Australian crudes<br />
and will materially reduce any possible<br />
future rise in the price of petroleum<br />
products. I present the following paper:<br />
Oil Pricing Policy-Ministerial Statcment-<br />
10 October 1968<br />
and move:<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
