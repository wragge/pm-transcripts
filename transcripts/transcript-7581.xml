PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, SHRINE OF REMEMBRANCE,<br />
MELBOURNE 25 APRIL 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: On the eve of today's service in New Zealand<br />
the Prime Minister, David Lange said that there was no hope<br />
of ANZUS ever being resurrected, that the formal ties would<br />
be severed altogether. Does that sadden you?<br />
PM: Yes, well I don't want to inject political<br />
considerations into today. But if that's their decision,<br />
that's their decision. Our commitment to the Alliance is as<br />
strong and constructive as it has ever been, a fact which is<br />
attested to not only by us but by our friends in the United<br />
States. We'll continue to have defence relationships with<br />
New Zealand but of course the quality of that relationship<br />
must necessarily be to some extent diminished by their<br />
absence from the broader relationship.<br />
