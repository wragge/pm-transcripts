PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT<br />
PRIME MINISTER AT EMAIL LTD. 16 October 1978<br />
signify any personal moves by you to become more involved<br />
perhaps in the youth unemployment problem?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think the Government has been very much involved in the<br />
problems of youth and youth unemployment right throughout.<br />
This isn't by any means the first visit I've made--the first to an<br />
apprenticeship school in Sydney--but in Melbourne to an experimental<br />
programme for unemployed youth which is catering for a different<br />
category of young people. They are people who, if you look at<br />
their family backgrounds, might well have had nobody care for<br />
them in their lives and have just given up<br />
QUESTION: It's one of the major problems confronting the Government.<br />
Are you happy with the progress you have been able to make<br />
Sir? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the training programmes I think are going well. We have<br />
about 110,000 people and many many thousands of those are young<br />
people in training at any one time, and tens of thousands of<br />
others have obviously gone through the various training programmes.<br />
Tony Street introduced a revised apprenticeship programme, which<br />
is called CRAFT as you know, and that has been responsible for a<br />
lift in the number of apprentices. But he is constantly examining<br />
the nature, the basis of the training programmes to see if they<br />
can be improved or extended, to see if they are best meeting the<br />
needs of young people, and also of course of industry, because<br />
the two have to mesh in together, and a greater part of the<br />
training, which is being successful, is training on the spot.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that private industry is in fact doing enough in<br />
this field?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We'd like to be able to see private industry doing more, but<br />
if private industry is going to do more they have got to be<br />
operating in a profitable way. They've got to be getting a<br />
larger share of the domestic market and hopefully getting into<br />
exports. One of the exciting things about Australia is in<br />
recent times I've struck a number of industries that are moving<br />
out into the export area, and because they've got stable costs<br />
we are exporting goods to the United States again.<br />
QUESTION: Would your Government be putting more money into apprenticeship<br />
schemes? </p>
<p>2<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
This is one area of the Budget where, in a sense, there was no<br />
restraint in this year, because the sums going to the different<br />
training programmes under Tony Street's department were<br />
enormously expanded. We had said earlier that we didn't want<br />
an opportunity for young men and women of Australia to be cut<br />
short because of a budgetary restriction. So we've demonstrated<br />
by what has happened that much greater funds have been, and<br />
are, going into the various training areas. This is something<br />
that Tony Street has got constantly under examination and<br />
review to see that the programmes are devised best to meet the<br />
needs of young Australians. Also, obviously, to see that they<br />
are run as economically as possible because it's a question of<br />
getting people trained for jobs and the more economically you<br />
can do it the more people you can train for the same number of<br />
dollars. The programmes are large, and they do cost a great<br />
deal, and I think that looking at the sorts of programmes that<br />
are operating in Europe, as the Government has, the training<br />
programmes we have in Australia I think are better. They are<br />
more productive and they give more people more opportunities.<br />
That doesn't mean to say we are complacent about it. If we<br />
find ways and means, through the training programmes, providing<br />
greater assistance to young Australians who find it difficult<br />
to get work, then we certainly will. </p>
