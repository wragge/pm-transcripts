lAUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME -MINISTER<br />
O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE LAUNCESTON<br />
THURSDAY, 23 JANUARY 1986<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you react to claims by the Deputy<br />
Premier of Tasmania that you and Mr Wriedt have been<br />
involved in a plan to buy votes from Tasmanians without<br />
putting any thought into it by going through local<br />
government? PM: Who is the Deputy Premier what's his name?<br />
JOURNALIST: Geoff-Pearsall<br />
PM: No, I haven't had brought to my attention the<br />
comments of Mr Pearsall and all I can say is that like<br />
so many of the desperate statements that are made by<br />
Liberal Party politicians-around Australia today, there's<br />
100 per cent false.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think the issues will be in<br />
Tasmania? PM: Well, that is a question that obviously can be<br />
answered more competently by Mr Wriedt and my colleagues<br />
here because they are in a day-to-day sense involved. But<br />
I would think that one of the issues would be, I think it<br />
certainly ought to be, to work in cooperation with the<br />
Federal Government. Now, I haven't come down here to attack<br />
Mr Gray in personal terms I don't intend to do that but<br />
it is a matter of record that I have been having discussions<br />
with Mr Gray, to have other people there so that there can be<br />
a clear understanding of what in fact has been said. And that<br />
sort of confrontationalism which is characterised in Gray's<br />
approach would certainly be absent in a government led by<br />
Ken Wriedt. And there would be an intention of putting a case<br />
for Tasmanians forcefully and toughly but with the great<br />
advantage of Ken Wriedt and his Ministers knowing intimately<br />
the workings of the Members of the Federal Government<br />
and I think in that way there is no question that the<br />
interest of Tasmania would be advanced. I think that should<br />
be and I guess will be one of the issues. </p>
<p>2.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you say that you can work well with<br />
Mr Wriedt, is that to say that you can't work well with<br />
Mr Gray.<br />
PM: Well, I have made the-comment in answering the question<br />
that in the ' 83/' 84 period and into ' 85 there were occasions,<br />
it is a matter of public record, when what had actually<br />
transpired in discussion~ was misrepresented by Mr Gray.<br />
And it has been subsequently revealed to have been<br />
misrepresented. I don't think those sorts of things make<br />
for the most constructive sort of relationship between<br />
governments. As I say, I-don't want to get into a<br />
detailed personal analysis of Mr Gray. I don't do that<br />
when I go-into states. But that is a matter of record<br />
and I think it is clear that that sort of approach would<br />
be absent in a government led by Mr Wriedt. Let me make<br />
it clear that because we have governments, at a state<br />
level, of the same political persuasion as ourselves,<br />
which is the case in the mainl. and states other than<br />
Queensland, it doesn't mean a cosy relationship in which<br />
the State Premiers simply because we are of the same political<br />
persuasion, don't put their case forcefully. I can assure<br />
you that in the case of Neville Wran and John Bannon,<br />
John Cain and Brian Burke, it is a very, very forceful<br />
presentation of the cases of the states. But the very<br />
fact that we have a knowledge of one another and not merely<br />
at the Premier to the Prime MInister level, but at the<br />
various Ministers levels, is, by definition, helpful in<br />
the capacity to have cases heard and put.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr, Gray says that you have worked against 105con'A<br />
in several areas and is running a large part of his election<br />
campaign on that basis.<br />
PM: Mr Gray again does not tell the truth on this issue.<br />
I had brought to my attention something he said in the<br />
Parliament where he said that on the night that I was<br />
elected Prime Minister I had virtually declared war on<br />
Tasmania. You only have to see the transcripts of what<br />
I said on that night that the opposite was the case.<br />
I said " Tasmanians have not voted for us7 we didn't<br />
get a House of Representatives seat, but I said on the<br />
very night of being elected Prime Minister, I said " I<br />
will be governing for Tasmanians just as much as I will<br />
be for the rest of Australia. And the record is that<br />
in the agreement signed in June of 1984 which finalised<br />
the arrangements about the Gordon below Franklin, in that<br />
document the Premier has signed to the effect that Mr<br />
Hawke has fully honoured all his commitments in regard<br />
to the question of the dam. But having signed that document<br />
and said so, he then seeks to put another point of view.<br />
Now, ultimately that can only mean that his signature<br />
is not worth the paper on which it is written. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is there anything concrete in which Tasmania<br />
would be better off under a Labor Government dealing with<br />
Canberra? PM: I go back to the point I made that you obviously have<br />
a position more beneficial to a state where not only the<br />
Premier but all the Ministers, simply because they know<br />
their counterparts, they have worked with them over many<br />
years. they have a better capacity to deve) Loy relations,<br />
to put cases, in that sort of environmenet~ lan in one where<br />
at the head of the state government you have the personification<br />
of confrontation and of misrepresentation. NOw, it is just<br />
human nature that in that sort of circumstance, the former<br />
is going to get better results.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Gray appears to have shied away from the<br />
privatisation issue in this campaign. And unlike his South<br />
Australian colleague what does that-indicate to you?<br />
PM: It indicates that Mr Gray like the rest of the Liberals<br />
all around Australia are first of all bereft of policies<br />
and can't be trusted when they get into the area of<br />
policy formulation.. Now, let it not be forgotten that in<br />
the development of the privatisation ideas, which until<br />
very recently Mr Howard and other Liberal leaders have been<br />
saying is right at the centre of Liberal thinking for the<br />
next election, don't let it be forgotten that one then Senator<br />
Rae from TAsmania. was the principal adviser to Mr Carlton<br />
on this concept of privatisation.-That is Senator Rae from<br />
this area of Launceston. Principal adviser on this concept<br />
of privatisation. I believe that whatever Mr Gray might<br />
be saying now, because he has learnt that the people of<br />
Australia have rejected the concept of privatisation that<br />
was made quite clear in Adelaide he will be making soft<br />
noises, soft pedalling, saying no it will be a different<br />
story-if he were to be re-elected.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on a national question. You have<br />
just left the Federal Executive discussing Mr Hartley.<br />
PM: No. Correction, I have not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, it is apparently still proceeding.<br />
PM: Yes. But I haven't been at it. That is all I am<br />
saying. JOURNALIST: Do you believe it has got the potential to<br />
turn into a publicly damaging'and embarrassing brawl. You<br />
have criticised factionalism in the ALP in the past. Isn't<br />
this just another example of it.<br />
PM: ON the contrary. Let me make these points firstly.<br />
And I am not pre-judging what will happen, that is a matter<br />
for the Executive to decide. It is perfectly appropriate<br />
that they should consider whether they should<br />
continue to have him in the Party after he has made certain<br />
stgtemens o that is being done. Andi they should<br />
make tat aec ision my Judgemen t is, not beia negative, gut </p>
<p>PM cont: let me make this point about factionalism, I have<br />
had to make it recently and it is something that I really<br />
started to outline early in 1985. A-seminal change has<br />
taken place in the Australian political scene. It is quite<br />
true that there are still groups, factions if you want to<br />
call them that, within the Labor Party. But as I said -early<br />
in 1985, it has become more obviously true as 1985 has gone<br />
on and we have moved into 1986, factionalism has diminised<br />
within the Labor Party. There has been very, very stong<br />
and positive cooperation on the formulation of policies,<br />
and the implementation of them. And the existence of different<br />
factional groupings within the Labor Party has not stopped<br />
both the formulation and the implementation of policy.<br />
I said at the beginning of 1985. and I said this gratuitously<br />
if you like to the Canberra Gallery, I said in 1985 if you<br />
want to talk about factionalism you look at he Opposition<br />
parties That is where factionalism develo'and predominate4<br />
in 1985. And that is exactly what happened. It is operating<br />
now in the Opposition parties in a totally damaging and<br />
negative way. They are completely incapable of formulating<br />
any policies. Why? It is not because they can't think<br />
about policies. I don't think that~ they think terribly<br />
well. But I am not here to insult them in that sense..<br />
The reason why they can't formulate policies on the fundamental<br />
issues of taxation, wages, social welfare policy, is because<br />
they are ridden with groups who have fundamentally opposing<br />
views. You take privatisation. It has been mentioned earlier.<br />
Mr Howard and others are totally committed to the concept<br />
of selling off the public assets which provide services<br />
to the people of Australia. -Totally committed. There are<br />
others who regard that as completely stupid policy. On<br />
the centrally important issue of wages policy. There are<br />
some of them who want to abolish-the Conciliation and ARbitration<br />
Commission. They say they want to get rid of it. Others<br />
say no you can't possibly do that. And that is what their<br />
factionalism is about. Quite different from the Labor Party.<br />
it is operating in a way there to stop the formulation of<br />
policy. -And the Liberals of Australia are quite incapable<br />
of going to the people of Australia and saying this is what<br />
we believe in, this is what we would do in government.<br />
JOURNALIST: None of the Liberals are actually being expelled<br />
by other Llberals?<br />
PM: Let me say if you are talking about expelling. There<br />
are ways and ways of expelling. And Tasmania ought to be<br />
very much aware of the way in which Mr Howard has expelled<br />
Tasmania. He expelled TAsmania from his front bench. All<br />
the TAsmanians were repudiated. So much so that, what is<br />
member for Denison's name Mr HOdgman, said that this is<br />
an attack upon Tasmania. That they were all expelled.<br />
There are ways and ways of getting rid of influences you<br />
don't like. The Federal leadership of the Liberal Party<br />
hates Tasmania. And has expelled from the front bench. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you say that you could probably deal<br />
better with Mr Wriedt as a Premier. In your budget last<br />
year Mr Keating said that Tasmania would not have the special<br />
assistance it got at the last. Premier's Conference to form<br />
part of the base of negotiations for the coming Premier's<br />
Conference, which makes things look bad or grim for Tasmania<br />
if you like. I am just asking what the situation would<br />
be? PM: As far as Commonwealth and Tasmania and budgetary matters<br />
are concerned, let's Just talk about the factual situation.<br />
WE had the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission<br />
before us~ as you know, last year. And there was very considerable<br />
Cor~ Ce v h here in Tasmania, understandably. As a result of those<br />
reecommendations there would be very, very substantial cuts.<br />
Because that is what was recommended. Fortunately for<br />
TAsmania, as distinct from all the rhetoric and so on that<br />
emanated in the first from the Premier of TAsmania. Ken<br />
Wriedt came over to see us. No fanfare, just quietly came<br />
and talked with us. And Cabinet having not at that stage<br />
considered the issue, we were coming to consider it, Our<br />
opportunity to look at the issues in terms of the needs<br />
of Tasmania was very much enhanced by the contribution that<br />
Ken Wriedt made. And in the event, the decision that we<br />
made which I think was very generally welcomed in Tasmania<br />
was to a considerable extent to the credit of Ken WRiedt.<br />
That is * hat * has happened up until know and it confirms<br />
the same sort of analysis that I put to you before about<br />
the way in which that sort of approach, which one identifies<br />
with Ken Wriedt, is more likely to work than the alternative<br />
JOURNALIST: Back onto the Hartley issue, Mr Hawke. For<br />
the National Executive it is a very important decision.<br />
SHouldn't you be there participating and is all the fuss<br />
worthwhile. Mr Hartley seems to be thriving on all the<br />
publicity. PM: You won't regard it as too rude of me, I don't-need<br />
to be told by you or anyone else what MY priorities are.<br />
LEt me point out to you that this is the only occasion<br />
which, at least at a fair distance before the actual polling<br />
date, I can in terms of my other commitments be in Tasmania.<br />
I want to say to the people of Tasmania that I regard<br />
it as more important to do something for which I can't delegate<br />
anyone else. I can't delegate anyone else to be Prime Minister<br />
and come down here into the campaign. I have the capacity<br />
under the constitution of the ALP to have a proxy. I can<br />
have a proxy in Canberra to deal with that matter with which<br />
I have not been unassociated in the past. But I can't have<br />
a proxy down here. I<br />
JOURNALIST: One question on the rural sector if I can.<br />
The Livestock and Grain Producers Association of NSW has<br />
called on the Government to set up an agricultural accord<br />
along the lines of an ACTU/ Government accord. Now that<br />
would involve also I think the problem of compensation claims.<br />
Hlow realistic do y ou think that is? </p>
<p>6.<br />
PM: I don't know that we should commit ourselves to a view<br />
about an accord or a particular term. But let me say this<br />
that no-one understands more.-clearly than I do the very<br />
severe crisis in which the rural sector of Australia is<br />
now passing. Very basically of course, as they themselves<br />
understand, that is because of factors outside the control<br />
of anyone in Australia. That is the corruption of the international<br />
markets as a result predominantly of the action<br />
of the Europeans. And now reaction in response by the United<br />
States. Now when I say there is virtually nothing we can<br />
do about that, we are nevertheless sending our Ministerfor<br />
Trade, Mr Dawkins, to the United States next to talk to<br />
them. I have invited Mr McLachlan of the National Farmers<br />
Federation to go with him for those discussions in the United<br />
States. Now, as far as the situation within Australia<br />
is concerned. We are looking seriously at that. Mr Kerin<br />
today has been meeting with the banks and the representatives<br />
of the farmers to try and ensure that they will not be ultimately<br />
adversely impacted on by the level of interest rates. And<br />
we will be receiving in the Cabinet a submission from Mr<br />
Kerin in the relatively near future as to the sorts of things<br />
that we may be able to look further at to help the farmers.<br />
I have told Mr McLachlan representing the National Farmers<br />
Federation that we will have further discussions with them<br />
in the light of that Cabinet submission. Out of all that<br />
it is possible that some sort of agreement may emerge.<br />
It is too early to say what form if any that would take.<br />
So I make the point, I don't say yes or no to the terminology<br />
of an accord, but the concept of discussion, consultation<br />
and cooperation with the rural community is at the centre<br />
of what we are about. And just how that will be reflected<br />
will be for the events of the next few weeks to bring out.<br />
JOURNALIST: -On ANZUS Prime Minister, did Australia'support<br />
the expulstion of New Zealand from* ANZUS?<br />
PM: No. You will have seen that that has been repudiated<br />
by the spokesman for the representatives cxf the Americans<br />
who were here arid they have been in touch with us to say<br />
that that has been a total misrepresentation of the<br />
position. We have not said that at any stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is suspension a good idea?<br />
PM: It is not a question of suspension. if you have<br />
a position where the United States says it is not going<br />
to be operative as far as they are concerned between the<br />
United States arid New Zealand. What we have simply said<br />
Is in that situation we will ensure that it remains operative<br />
between ourselves and the United States. And it is quite<br />
clear that is how it will be. </p>
