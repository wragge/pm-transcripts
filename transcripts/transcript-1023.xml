FOR PRESS P. M. No, 75/ 1964<br />
DEATH OF SENATOR WADE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert<br />
Menzies<br />
Senator Wade's death is a sad blow; he seemed<br />
to be recovering. He was a man of quiet strength of<br />
character, a really first-class Minister and, as a<br />
colleague, uniformly friendly and helpful.<br />
In sending our sympathy to his widow and son,<br />
we would wish them to know that we share their own sense<br />
of loss.<br />
CANiBERIA, 19th November, 1964. </p>
