PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 22 DECEMBER 1987<br />
Brian Burke, the Premier of Western Australia, has today<br />
announced his intention to retire from active politics on<br />
February when he will resign the Premiership.<br />
I wish to place on record my appreciation for the great<br />
contribution Brian Burke has made since he was swept to<br />
office in the State election of 1983, immediately prior to<br />
the election of my Government. During his tenure, Western<br />
Australia has recorded remarkable growth, due in great<br />
measure to the restructuring reforms which Premier Burke and<br />
his Government have put in place.<br />
Brian Burke's contribution has been a distinguished one and<br />
he has always been an articulate advocate for his State in<br />
his dealings with the Commonwealth. His voice and his<br />
advice will be greatly missed. He is a young man at the<br />
zenith of his powers and popularity who could have remained<br />
as Premier of Western Australia for a decade or more, had he<br />
so chosen. While I greatly regret his decision, I<br />
understand his personal reasons for setting himself a<br />
timetable for his political career.<br />
While Brian Burke's political skills will be mi'ssed, I am<br />
delighted that he will continue to serve Australia in his<br />
new and important posting as our Ambassador to Ireland. He<br />
brings great personal and professional skills to that<br />
position, and I am confident that he will discharge his<br />
duties of fostering and strengthening the historic and<br />
important relationship between Ireland and Australia with<br />
distinction. I look forward to continuing a close partnership with the<br />
new Premier. 0 0 367-3<br />
