MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF WOMEN<br />
ORGANIZATIONS ARRANGED BY THE 4OMEN'S SECTION<br />
OF THE LIBERAL PARTY IN BRISBANE ON<br />
23RD APRIL, 1963.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister_ the Rt. Hon Sir Robert Menzies<br />
I've never discovered quite accurately how one begins<br />
Madam Chairman is that right? ( Laughter) There is a certain<br />
ambiguity about that, but still, wetll let it pass,<br />
I want to thank you very much, in the first place, for<br />
having congratulated me on this event that has recently occurred<br />
in my life. The truth of the matter is that any properly<br />
constituted man finds it almost impossible to say " No" to a<br />
woman ( Laughter) and that is the whole story in brief. All The<br />
Queen had to do was to smile and say, " Now, come, come. What<br />
about it?" and I was sunk with all hands. Some people thiink<br />
that it is in my nature to be given the Order of the Thistle<br />
( Laughter). The motto of the Order is done into English<br />
" Nobody hurts me ( or frustrates me) with impunity". One or two<br />
of my Cabinet colleagues were unkind enough to say when it<br />
was announced that they had known that for many, many years<br />
( Laughter) and thought it quite appropriate. But the best<br />
translation of the lot is in the Scots, where its version is<br />
" Who dare meddle with me?" ( Laughter) You Sassenachs won't<br />
understand that, but all the rest will.<br />
Now, I thought I'd like to talk to you quite briefly<br />
this morning about one or two matters of importance. In the<br />
first place, I am going to tell you at once, to relieve your<br />
minds, that I don't propose to run through a whole series of<br />
figures and facts and give you categories of this or that because<br />
nothing is more tiresome I think, and nothing more difficult to<br />
carry around with you, But I think it proper to say and it is<br />
worth while everybody realising, particularly in Queensland,<br />
that in recent times the amount that has gone on in this State<br />
and is going on, of a developmental kind, with the active and<br />
powerful assistance of the Commonwealth is quite remarkable,<br />
There are some people who think that all you need to<br />
do, if you are going to get some help from the Commonwealth<br />
which means from the taxpayers, is to go along and say, " This<br />
is a pretty good thing to do-what about you paying for it?"<br />
Now, this is not right. The Commonwealth does not carry out the<br />
public works, for example, that the States do. We do to a<br />
limited extant, in our own field. Most of the great public<br />
works in Australia, the great works of development, are State<br />
works, but increasingly the Commonwealth is becoming a contributor<br />
to their cost and we have laid down a rule that there must<br />
be some limit to this kind of thing, some rational limit,<br />
We have laid down a rule that we will be prepared to examine<br />
with a State Government the possibility of financial assistance<br />
for a particular job of work, if that job of work can be related<br />
to the export earnings of Australia.<br />
You see, we have a great responsibility for keeping<br />
this country internationally solvent and that means that we<br />
must have our exports constantly increasing, so that we may<br />
have oversea. s, held in various forms, adequate sums of money to<br />
preserve the solvency of Australia in the international market.<br />
It is a complicated matter, I don't want to look beyond that<br />
point, but it is essential that our export industries should be<br />
oooocoooo/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
encouraged, That is why it is so essential that we should<br />
restrain inflation in Australia because the first industries<br />
to suffer with inflation are the primary industries which are,<br />
to an overwhelming extent, responsible for oir export earnings<br />
sugar, wheat, meat and so on down the listl<br />
Now we have laid down thtis general rule and if I may<br />
apply it to the State of Queensland, it may be interesting.<br />
I don't take them in any particular order, but take the great<br />
railways converton on the Mt. Isa/ Collinsville lines. It turned<br />
out to be impossible to raise the money, to borrow the money<br />
from the World Bank, although at one stage, we had great hopes<br />
that that could be aone and so the Commonw.. ealth Government<br />
stepped in and said, " We will act in place of the 4orld Bank.<br />
Wo will finance this up to the extent of Å 020M,.<br />
Now Å Z2014 is a lot of money. Even for an Opposition,<br />
it is a lot of money, Why did we do this? Well, we did this<br />
because Mt. Isa has every prospect of being the greatest copper<br />
minint hewordand whereas copper was in very short supply<br />
oiny an fewoersd ago there is an increasing chance of a<br />
substantial export market in copper, to say nothing of the<br />
extent to which it saves us from importing copper in the first<br />
instance. ] herefore this is a great export earner and if it<br />
could be doubled or quadrupled that is what is going on at<br />
Mt. Isa then the earnings from the mine are doubled or<br />
quadrupled and that is of tremendous significance in Australia's<br />
balance of payments. Therefore, we are certainly in on this.<br />
Take a small example ( the other is a very big one)<br />
the coal facilities at the port of Gladstone, Now it may seem<br />
a little odd that the Commcnwdualth should come in to Some modent<br />
extent about Å C250,000 on some coal-handling facilities at<br />
a port like Gladstone, but the same principle was applied. The<br />
principle was that if these facilities were increased, then<br />
an export market frcm the port of Gladstone in coal could be<br />
created. We have done the same with coal ports in New South<br />
WA~ ole S Now you may say, " Oh, well, this is all raother<br />
humdrum." It isn't humdrum. When we came back into office<br />
at the end of 1949, after eight years of Labour administration,<br />
Australia wan' exporting coal, Australia was importing coal.<br />
Many of you will remember it. Importing coal. Buying coal<br />
from India, buying coal from South Africa; and because shipping<br />
was scarce in those days, paying the most tremendous freight<br />
rates, charter rates, in order to land the coal in Australia.<br />
Although Australia is full of coal, we were importing it, so<br />
declined h. ad the fortunes of the country become. And, today,<br />
of course, we have an export market in coal. It becomes<br />
increasingly important. The production of coal has gone up<br />
by leaps and bounds and so has its export, and therefore we<br />
said, " Here's a case in which there is a chance to improve the<br />
export earnings of Australia."<br />
Similarly, and Itll still stick to Queensland, you<br />
take the beef roads up in the north, where we are providing,<br />
over a short term of years, Å_ 81 or Å F914, mest of it by way of1<br />
grant, in order to construct properly a series of beef roads<br />
which will onab'e a bigger out-turn of cattle from the cattle<br />
lands to be made. This, of course, will add very very<br />
considerably to the export earnings of Australia because let us<br />
000ae 00oo/ a3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
remember all the time that while you may look at it as the<br />
export earnings of John Brown or of the Mt. Isa company or<br />
whatever it may be, in reality in the broad, this goes into<br />
the great stream of export earnings of the country itself and<br />
if our exports exceed our imports, then we arc accumulating<br />
reserves overseas, If ve don't accumulate reserves ovrseas,<br />
then we are just like a household in which there is no money<br />
in the bank, no savings made, nothing to fall back on for a<br />
rainy day and we musn't allow the nation to be in that State.<br />
There is a great development going on or about to<br />
go on in the Brigalow country and we have undertaken to find<br />
millions of pounds in relation to that, and why? For the<br />
same reason. It will increase the production of exportable<br />
commodities beef, meat of various kinds, whatever the products<br />
may turn out to be.<br />
Now, I am sorry to be tedious about that, but I wanted<br />
you all to understand the principle on which the Government<br />
acts in these matters. It is not just a matter of kissing<br />
going by favour. It must never be a matter of saying " Iell,<br />
we will do that job because there are some votes in it." This<br />
is pretty cheap stuff and politics of a poor order. We have<br />
therefore established the principle that we must be shown first<br />
by a State Government that the operation will come in aid of<br />
the national exports and if it is, then we sit down and we get<br />
down to brass tacks and in a great number of cases we have<br />
helped. We have done it in oJestern Australia. We are about<br />
to do it in South Australia. Wc have done it to a certain<br />
extent in Victoria, though perhaps not as much as the Victorians<br />
would like, Now, so much for that.<br />
The other thing I want to mention to you has nothing<br />
to do with that. It is far removed from it. There has been<br />
a groat deal of argument going on recently about disarmament and<br />
about nuclear-free zones in the world and about a communications<br />
station, an American station, in the North-viest of Western<br />
Australia. I thought I would just like to say a few words to<br />
you about those matters because there is nothing on which there<br />
is so much confusion of thought, particularly among my opponents<br />
who have got it all messed up in their own minds and it is<br />
essential to keep it clear.<br />
First of all, you must realise that the Labour Party<br />
approaches it from the point of their firmly-established<br />
policy that there should be a nuclear-free zone in the Southern<br />
Hemisphere. That is to say, in the Southern Hemisphere no<br />
nuclear -, capons are to be made or stored or used. Now that<br />
sounds wonderful, doesn't it? Vie don't want a nuclear war.<br />
Who does? but we want nuclear power because unless we had<br />
had it, we would have been at war long since. But it sounds<br />
rather attractive to say, " Well, now, you can put the whole of<br />
the world south of the Equator out of the nuclear arena. What<br />
would that moan? Just in the name of coraonsense, what does<br />
that mean? It moans that China, Communist China, north of<br />
the Equator has no prohibitions about nuclear weapons but we,<br />
south of the Equator would. So we couldn't have our allies<br />
use nuclear reapons in our defence but Communist China could use<br />
them against us without reprisal and with impunity. Does<br />
that strike you as a very sensible policy? If ever I knew<br />
anything unrealistic, it is that. And this thinking, this<br />
thinking which would put us in the position of absolutely<br />
letting down our allies and therefore being let down by them,<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>is pretty widespread. We happen and it is to the credit<br />
of the present Government let me say we happen to have two<br />
treaties in which we are in alliance with the United States<br />
ANZUS United States, Australia, New Zealand and the<br />
SEATO treaty in which Great Britain is also one of our partners.<br />
Not that we need to have formal alliances with Great Britain,<br />
but we are together, whatever comes.<br />
But talk about America for this purpose.<br />
America is the greatest free power in the world. If it<br />
weren't for the enormous deterrent strength that the United<br />
States has, this world could have been overrun at ease by the<br />
Communist powers. What could have stood in the way? Therefore<br />
the United States is very important to us. You, you ladies,<br />
the custodians of the future of Australia, have a profound<br />
interest in the security of Australia and the security of<br />
Australia depends more than any other thing on the alliances<br />
that we have in this part of the world with the United States<br />
of America. Great Britain can do something here but sh-e has<br />
enormous tasks elsewhere in the world. We have the United<br />
States and the ANZUS pact and so on.<br />
Do you realise that this Labour policy means<br />
that if the United States became involved in a great war<br />
with Communist China and that would be a world war on a<br />
great scale that the United States couldn't attack Communist<br />
China from any point south of the Equator and would therefore<br />
be utterly handicapped in conducting operations of war.<br />
Suppose look, God knows we don't want it; we pray against<br />
it but suppose the world got into a great war, with the<br />
United States and Great Britain on one side and Communist<br />
China and Communist Russia on the other, and we as one of the<br />
prizes of defeat or victory, and we have an alliance with<br />
the United States can you suppose that Australia would<br />
approve of telling the United States, " You can't have a<br />
submarine with a nuclear weaponon it; you can't have an<br />
aircraft carrier with a nuclear weapon on it; you can't have<br />
an aircraft with a nuclear weapon on it south of the Equator,<br />
otherwise you are breaking the rules that we have laid down.<br />
The effect would be to destroy the Unites Statest capacity<br />
to attack the Communist powers from the south from a point<br />
from which they are most vulnerable the Indian Ocean and<br />
its surroundingsÃ¸ We would simply immobilise our own ally<br />
and, of course, the United States, indeed no great country,<br />
can trifle with its own safety in that way. It would simply<br />
say, " We ignore your rules", and so all we get for our<br />
contribution is a quarrel at that time with the nation whose<br />
victory is essential to ours. Now all that nonsense, as I<br />
call it the suicidal nonsense about a nuclear-free zone,<br />
is clearly to be observed in the approach of the Labour Party<br />
to this signalling station at North-West Cape. Really, they<br />
have a bee in their bonnet on this business. They only just<br />
failed to declare their hostility to it. Nineteen to seventeen,<br />
If the gentleman from Queensland hadntt changed his vote, as<br />
I understand, at the last moment, the hostility to it would<br />
have been confirmed and a Labour Government the one that<br />
you are going to vote for if you vote against us a Labour<br />
Government would have served notice that if it won the next<br />
election, it would term-inate the American rights to conduct<br />
that signalling base in the North-West of Western Australia.<br />
4 </p>
<p>Now what is this signalling station? They have<br />
got an idea that it is going to be a fire control tower, that<br />
somebody will press a button and that will fire a Polaris<br />
missile off a submarine. This is so childish. It has no<br />
foundation in life at all. That is not the way these things<br />
are done. All that this station is for is to enable communiications<br />
to be had from the Administration in the United States<br />
with the United States naval vessels in the Indian Ocean and<br />
South West Pacific, whether they are above the water or under<br />
the water, It is part of the naval forces. And they need to<br />
have the signalling connection with them badly. They have it<br />
in the Pacific. They have it in the Atlantic. They don't have<br />
it in this area, and the one place in which it can be effectively<br />
established is in the North-West of Australia. de are their<br />
ally. Their friend. And they are our friend and, to a large<br />
extent, our protector. Are we to say to them, " No, you can't<br />
have a radio station; the land would still be ours, of<br />
course, but you can't have a radio station, because you know,<br />
you may bo signalling to a submarine and a submarine<br />
Oh, that's a rude word with the Left-Wingers in the Labour<br />
Party, unless it is a Russian submarine in which case it is<br />
quite respectable, thank you.<br />
Well, you know this is puerile and yet, I repeat,<br />
but for the more accident of a single change of vote, the<br />
policy of the next Labour Government would have been to<br />
declare, " Out with this station".* As it is, I am going to<br />
take no chances on this matter. I've got too much sense of<br />
responsibility for this country to take chances on this and<br />
thereforcj, whon the agreement is finally concluded -because they<br />
are still working out a few details when the agreement is<br />
concluded, we are going to put it through Parliament and have<br />
it authorised by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia and it won't be very easy then for a new Government<br />
to tear it up because it will not only have to repudiate the<br />
agreement, it will have to got Parliament also to approve<br />
of the repudiation, and that's not so easy in Australia.<br />
It is essential, from our point of view, tha-t this matter<br />
should be confirmed, made absolutely clear, and the only<br />
reason I am mentioning it to you is that once more it throws<br />
light on what these strange opponents of ours think about the<br />
problems of national security,<br />
Of course it all illustrates this: that they have<br />
gone back to isolationism. They were isolationist before the<br />
war. They had to snap out of it during the war when they<br />
went into office and did it very wel]* Now they have gone<br />
back to isolationism. Everybody in ustralia ought to look<br />
at the map once a week the map of South East Asia once a<br />
week ait least. I go Into the Cabinet room and pull it down<br />
and ? ook at it with regularity. I know it back to front.<br />
What do you see? You see Communist China so aggressive in<br />
philosophy that even Khrushchev is disagreeing with them and<br />
saying, " Now, gently, gently; don't be so extreme". That<br />
is the Chinese Communist outlook. And below them, what have<br />
we got? We have got Burma, which lives under their shadow<br />
and, I would imagine, in the fear of them. We have North<br />
Viet Nam, absolutely violently Communist under Ho Chi Minh-<br />
South Viet Nam, a little outpost of non-Communism involving<br />
today the assistance of the United States and Aus~ ralia;<br />
Laos which is in a state of chronic confusion due entirely<br />
to Communist agitation internally and from ou~ side. We have<br />
Malaya, peaceful, well-governed, quite a rich country, part of </p>
<p>6-<br />
the British Commonwealth; Singapore, the new concept of<br />
Malaysia, and then down here well, wevbo hiado<br />
course which is our ally and down below here, Indonesia<br />
you never know and Australia. Aren't we interested in<br />
seeing that the Communist attack doesn't come too near to us,<br />
or are we going to put our heads in a bag and say, " Well, we'll<br />
pretend~ we didn't know anything about it until it happened.<br />
They can come down; they can infiltrate; they can get hold<br />
of Laos; they can get hold of Thailand; they can wipe out<br />
South Viet Nam." All imaginary things but, really, in terms<br />
of military power, these countries left to themselves couldn't<br />
resist it. And yet, in our Parliament, we have a member<br />
of the Executive of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr. Haylen,<br />
and who is bound to be a Minister if they come into office,<br />
saying, " WIhat's Ma] lya got to do with us? The Commonwealth<br />
Brigade in the reserve ought to be withdrawn from Malaya.<br />
What's it got to do with us?" In other words, what doe3 ' Lt<br />
matter to us if Malaya is overrun by the Communists. This<br />
is wonderful statesmanship, isn't it? This is the kind of<br />
statesmanship that has produced a war or two in modern history.<br />
Don't lot us stand up for anything when we can; let it go,<br />
lot it go let it go, until finally you are in it on the worst<br />
possible terms, with all your outposts taken. It is worth<br />
thinking about this matter, this suicidal attitude towards<br />
what is, after all, the ov . irwhelmingly important thing for<br />
you and for me and for our children and our granchildren, that<br />
this country should be strong, self-respecting, secure and<br />
living on terms of honourable friondship with great free nations<br />
around the world. I once used an expression I daresay that like<br />
most people I repeated it about our great and powerful<br />
friends. I like to have great and poworful friends and so<br />
do you. But this has become a sort of jeering thing now:<br />
" The Prime Minister, of course, he bows his knee to our great<br />
and powerful friends, while of course ' ve, the Labour Party,<br />
so far from bowing the knee, kick them hard, because that's<br />
the way to deal wvith great and powe rful frionds.,"<br />
Now, this is a tremendously s: i-rious matter.<br />
If the next election merely involved some change of emphasis<br />
in how much money you spent inside Australia on this or that,<br />
perhaps it wouldn't matter, but if a change of Government<br />
involves, as I have shown you i does, an utter conversion from<br />
one extreme to the other, from one point to another on the<br />
attitude towards the security of Australia, then I want to say<br />
to you it's a risk no sensible person ought to take. You will<br />
be accused I will be accused of being warmongers. I was<br />
one of the Prime Ministers who, at the Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference agreed on a stateme., nt about disarmament, every word<br />
of which now stands and to which the Labour Party pays lip<br />
service. The operative part on the matters I have been<br />
discussing I actually drafted myself in the Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference. Of course we want to see a slowing-dowm of the<br />
armament race. Of course we wfant to see a substantial measure<br />
of disarmament, but the first thing to remember is that there<br />
are two kinds of arraament in the world. There is the nuclear<br />
weapon and there is what they are pleased to call the conventional<br />
weapon conventional forces, nuclear forces. A lot of<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>7-<br />
people like a few of those silly old men who sit in the street<br />
in England, a lot of people have persuaded themselves that if'<br />
you get rid of nuclear weapons you have solved the problem of'<br />
peace or war in the world. You havent. You have merely<br />
transferred the balance of power from the West to the Communists<br />
and therefore we have said right throughout, " You must deal<br />
with these two matters together. If you are going to reduce<br />
nuclear armaments, and we are all for it, then you must reduce,<br />
correspondingly roduce, conventional armament. You are not<br />
to have a process of disarmament which throws the world out<br />
of balance and gives some tremendous advantage to one side or<br />
the other. So keep it phased; keep it in harmony and get<br />
down to a point where ultimately, someday, the peace will be<br />
kept., we hope, by some properly controlled international<br />
force." 1 But in the meantime, there is -n awful lot of work<br />
to be done, and those people who because of the sheer horror<br />
of thinking about it want te abolish the nuclear forces while<br />
leaving the other forces untouched are just if they go away<br />
with it, making it a certainty that the whole balance of power<br />
would swing around and that the Communist powers would be<br />
able to dominate the world at will. Ind they are not very<br />
gentle. They don~ t have too much of the Christian othic so<br />
far as I have been able to discovcer and the prospect of them<br />
dominating the world is one that would fill any average<br />
Australian with complete horror.<br />
Nqow, I have already spoken too long. Thank<br />
you vary much. I didn't expect to seu anything like so many<br />
of you when I came here this 1--orning. I have to go away<br />
and be spoken to by the r:, erabers of the State Cabinet at<br />
lunchtime and then I think I am on a television exercise<br />
this afternoon and then a meeting in the stadium tonight.<br />
So the day is only really beginning. Thank you very much<br />
for making it begin so well.<br />
