<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Olympics were such a huge success, can the Paralympics really match that do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Itâs not a question of matching it. It will be a success in itâs own right and I believe that the public support for the Paralympics will be terrific. Iâm certainly getting behind it and I know that people all over the country are inspired by it and thereâs a real spirit here. Everythingâs different. You donât try and compare. You just make sure itâs a huge success in itâs own right and I know that it will be.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what about the Australian team?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, theyâll do damn well as they always do. Theyâll be very competitive and they will be very effective. I think itâs going to be a great success. Itâs a great spirit tonight and thereâs enormous enthusiasm amongst the Australian team. Weâve got over 4,000 athletes from 124 different countries. When you think back to the more humble beginnings of the Paralympics in Rome in 1960, itâs got bigger and better every four years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I just ask you, weâre featuring the basketball and of course Australia and the UK contested the final in 1996 â Australia got the gold.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As was appropriate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If it happens again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Iâll be pretty happy. Very happy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thank you very much.</p>
<p>(Ends)</p>
