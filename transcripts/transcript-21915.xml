    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Mr Howard what would you do if Barnaby Joyce rejects the Telstra sale legislation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I don't intend to say anything about that issue. Senator Joyce is entitled to take whatever counsel he chooses and we'll just see how events unfold.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister the Islamic community it seems is a little bit concerned by the anti-terror laws that you've laid down. Do they have anything to fear?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> They have nothing to fear if they are law abiding citizens. These laws are not directed at Islamic people, they are directed at people who might be contemplating terrorist deeds.. Any suggestion that they target one section of the community is quite wrong. I would encourage the Islamic community to continue to work with the government. It is in the interests of the overwhelming majority of the Islamic community of this country which is very law abiding and composed of people who want the best for Australia. It's in their interests that we have these strong laws. These laws could well protect them as much as any other Australian in the future and they therefore should welcome these laws, they should see these laws as a future protection for them as much as for any other Australian.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister yesterday you were keen to rule out the use of a sunset clause. A number of groups today including the Australian Defence Association and also even Commissioner Mick Keelty earlier suggested that they think it might be a good idea or at least wouldn't have a problem with it. Will you consider a sunset clause?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I was asked yesterday, was there a sunset clause contemplated and I answered then as I repeat now that it wasn't part of the original decision. Obviously if people make suggestions we will consider them but I simply said yesterday that it wasn't part of the original decision. The important thing is to get these laws discussed at the meeting with the Premiers, to get the legislation prepared. We are already working on the legislation to discuss the detail with the states and then get them into operation. These laws are very necessary. They will provide additional protection, they will provide additional reassurance, they will anticipate terrorist attacks. Prevention is always better than cure and that applies not only in health but it also applies in terrorism. You can't cure terrorism, you can't bring somebody back to life after they've been killed by a terrorist and therefore laws which are designed to anticipate and to prevent a terrorist act are laws that Australians should support and I believe most Australians will support these laws.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Mr Howard is a one day inquiry enough for laws that will possibly allow the sale of a $30 billion asset?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes particularly as this is an issue that has been trawled over, debated, inquired into, looked at, analysed, pulled apart by different committees and different groups over the years. I mean people who say that we have never inquired into Telstra before are ignoring a number of years of different Senate inquiries and the procedure that the Senate is adopting in relation to this particular Bill is exactly the same as the Senate has adopted in relation to a host of other pieces of legislation. Your - that complaint might have substance if this issue had not been on the public agenda for years and years. It has been and therefore the attention it's been given is entirely appropriate. Thank you.</p>
