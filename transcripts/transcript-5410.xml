ELECTORATE TALK<br />
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE JOBS PEOPLE<br />
Technological change is one of the challenges of a developing<br />
society. Australia cannot, and should not, isolate itself<br />
from it. It affects people and jobs and must be faced up to.<br />
It was against this background that the Government initiated<br />
the Myers Inquiry into technological change in Australia, the<br />
report of which I released last week.<br />
For many years there has been a great deal of public debate<br />
about the merits of technological change, and concern at its<br />
possible adverse effects. That is why the Government decided<br />
to establish an independent and representative committee under<br />
Professor Myers to examine the many implications of technological<br />
change. The Committee comprising members drawn from the academic world,<br />
business and the trade union movement was asked in particular<br />
to report and make recommendations on how the Australian<br />
community could maximise the economic, social and other benefits<br />
of technological change, and minimise any possible adverse<br />
consequences. I believe that the Committee has responded to that task in a<br />
most constructive fashion and that its report will greatly assist<br />
the community and the Government in understanding and dealing<br />
with technological change.<br />
The report will also do much to allay fears in the community<br />
that the introduction of new technology represents a threat to<br />
the well-being of society and in particular a threat to employment<br />
opportunities. Looking first at the benefits, the Committee stresses the strong<br />
positive links between technological changre, economic growth<br />
and improved living standards. It emphasises that it is essential<br />
for Australian industry primary, secondary and tertiary to<br />
keep up with technological developments if it is to compete<br />
internationally and if we as Australians are to realise the full<br />
potential of our economy.<br />
Rather than see the acceptance of new technology as a threat<br />
to employment opportunities the Committee points out that to<br />
resist change may be self-defeating. 1glogf?' I A-ze C-</p>
<p>At the same time, the Committee was in no way complacent about<br />
fears in some sections of the community of so-called<br />
" technological unemployment". These fears usually stem from a<br />
belief either that the pace of technological change has become,<br />
or is likely to become a threat to jobs; or that labour saving<br />
devices will in the future allow society to produce the goods<br />
and services it needs with a significantly smaller workforce.<br />
The Committee's words speak for themselves when it says it has:<br />
" Found no convincing evidence that change will be so<br />
fast or so extensive in the foreseeable future that<br />
significant sect-ions of the community will. be unable<br />
to adjust and will therefore remain unemployed"..<br />
The Committee's Report notes that accurate predictions of the<br />
employment effects of particular technological changes cannot<br />
be made. It shows also that the pessimistic forecasts of the<br />
job destroying effects of new technologies almost invariably<br />
prove to be exaggerated. The Committee also demonstrates<br />
and here it has got very much to the heart of the matter that<br />
the indirect effects of technological changes can in fact create<br />
jobs.<br />
This is because most innovations are adopted because they produce<br />
new things that people want, or because they satisfy existing<br />
needs at lower cost. Either way they are usually accompanied by<br />
higher productivity and increased incomes which will be<br />
distributed as a mixture of higher profits, increased wages and<br />
lower prices to consumers.<br />
The spending of these increases in incomes leads to the creation<br />
of new employment opportunities in the economy, often quite<br />
unrelated to the sector in which the-. initial change took place.<br />
There are, as the Report illustrates, many everyday examples of<br />
these processes at work such as the rising proportion of average<br />
household expenditure on services entertainment, sport and<br />
recreation, meals away from home, travel and education.<br />
It is all too easy to forget that as our living standards<br />
increase, assisted by technological advances; so do our demands<br />
for these goods and services. More people have to be employed<br />
to provide them.<br />
Technological change can, of course, be accompanied by adverse<br />
consequences. The Committee was very much aware of the hardships<br />
that may be imposed on some individuals and their families.<br />
Although it does not see these problems as being widespread the<br />
Committee was concerned that more can be done by governments,<br />
employers and unions alike to protect these people. In particular,<br />
the Committee emphasises the need for a more co-operative and<br />
mutually-supportive approach than has generally prevailed in<br />
Australia in the past.<br />
A great many of the Committee's recommendations are aimed at<br />
fostering such an approach at ensuring, for eicample, that<br />
workers are adequately consulted about the introduction of new<br />
technologies; that the environment in which they work and the<br />
work they do is improved as a result; and that the community in<br />
general is as well informed as possibli about the process and<br />
implications of technological change. </p>
<p>As I said when releasing the Report last week, the Government<br />
strongly supports the general objectives of fostering a more<br />
co-operative approach, as well as a wider understanding and<br />
acceptance of technological change.<br />
I have appointed a special Committee of Cabinet to examine the<br />
Committee's recommendations as a matter of high priority and<br />
I am confident that this consideration will lead. to substantial<br />
acceptance of the Committee's recommendations.<br />
I believe that the Committee's Report has brought out in a very<br />
balanced and constructive way not only the benefits to be<br />
derived from new technologies by the very great majority of<br />
Australians, but also the responsibilities that fall on all<br />
sections of the community to ensure that the introduction of<br />
those technologies is accomplished with the least possible<br />
disruption. 000---</p>
