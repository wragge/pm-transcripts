JAUSTRAL IA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 6 April 1978<br />
COMMITTEE ON AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS<br />
WITH THE THIRD WORLD<br />
The Government has established a high-level Committee to<br />
examine the wide ranges of issues involved in Australia's<br />
relations with the developing countries of the Third World<br />
and to identify policy options for Australia's approach to<br />
this group of states in the future.<br />
The Prixae Minister said the decision reflected the Government's<br />
awareness that the concerted approach of Third World<br />
developing countries to global issues such as food, energy<br />
and the conditions for international economic growth<br />
represented an increasingly important factor in international<br />
relations.<br />
The issues raised critical political, economic and moral<br />
questions. A growing interdependence between states, an<br />
increasing urgency attaching to the global problems and the<br />
need for co-operative solutions compelled attention to the<br />
character of Australia's relationship with the Third World.<br />
Australia had always paid close attention to its bilateral<br />
relations with Third World countries and to the particular<br />
issues involving them. But the Government believed that<br />
recent developments required a more co-ordinated and<br />
comprehensive approach one which recognised the existence<br />
of the Third World as a collective entity and took full<br />
account of the political significance and complexity of<br />
many of the issues which concerned it.<br />
The membership of the Committee, which would be headed by<br />
Professor Owen Harries, of the University of New South Wales,<br />
had been selected to reflect the breadth of the Australian<br />
interests, both within government and in the community<br />
generally, which were involved in our relations with the<br />
Third World. / 2 </p>
<p>The group of eminent people who had agreed to serve on the<br />
Committee were: Associate Professor Owen Harries, of the School<br />
of Political Science, University of New South<br />
Wales ( Chairman)<br />
Mr E. K. Fisk, Professorial Fellow, Department<br />
of Economics, Research School of Pacific Studies,<br />
Australian National University, Canberra<br />
Mr Peter Nolan, Secretary of the Australian Council<br />
of Trade Unions, Melbourne<br />

Mr Neil Mclnnes, Deputy Director-General ( Economic<br />

C anb err a<br />
