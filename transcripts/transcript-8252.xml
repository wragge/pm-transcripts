SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS LIAISON<br />
GROUP'S 1991 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS PROGRAM<br />
CANBERRA 11 FEBRUARY 1991<br />
Bill Ferris<br />
Ian Spicer<br />
Leader of the: Opposition,<br />
Parliamentary Colleagues<br />
At this challenging time in the life of our nation, it is<br />
heartening indeed to see this new initiative of the<br />
Australian business community an initiative that<br />
demonstrates once more our capacity, as Australians, to work<br />
together for the common good.<br />
Australia's ability to become competitive in the<br />
increasingly complex world of trade, investment and finance<br />
is critically important to our hopes for a stronger and more<br />
prosperous nation.<br />
And the launch today of the International Business Program<br />
is an imaginative and timely contribution to this process of<br />
nation building.<br />
The core aims of the International Business Program are:<br />
the development of a stronger and more effective<br />
Australian dialogue on the issue of competitiveness,<br />
and the creation of an effective presence of Australian<br />
trade and industry within the international business<br />
community.<br />
These are goals the Australian Government endorses<br />
wholeheartedly. All of the organisations involved in this venture have, in<br />
years past, made their own contributions to the process of<br />
building the Australian economy and its export trade. </p>
<p>And-there-mus3t-be-considerable; and-legitimate, pride that<br />
these eight national business associations along with<br />
AUSTRADE and the Department of Industry, Technology and<br />
Commerce, have now joined forces to create a year long<br />
program dedicated to promoting Australian competitiveness.<br />
Each Association represented in this program has its own<br />
viewpoint and objectives. But such differences have been<br />
put aside for the common purpose of promoting the interests<br />
of the national economy.<br />
It is in this shared endeavour that I see the enduring<br />
significance of the International Business Program. And let<br />
me add how appropriate I feel it is that this approach is<br />
matched with the bipartisanship being displayed on this<br />
occasion. This reflects the fundamental confidence of both sides of<br />
politics in the capacity of Australians to achieve our goal<br />
of a more competitive and more prosperous Australia.<br />
My Government has long recognised the need for Australian<br />
industry to increase its international competitiveness and<br />
to accept the challenges and opportunities that will flow<br />
from enmeshinig our economy into the regional and global<br />
economy. And we have acted on that need.<br />
Tariff reductions and ambitious microeconomic reforms are<br />
evidence of this Government's commitment to improving the<br />
efficiency and performance of the Australian economy.<br />
At a different level, I might also add how pleased I have<br />
been to assist Australian businesses find and develop<br />
overseas markets for their products. One of the features of<br />
the official overseas visits I make as Prime Minister has<br />
been the participation of delegations of business leaders,<br />
which has included their involvement in direct talks with<br />
foreign Governments. I think all those who have been<br />
involved would agree that this has been a successful<br />
innovation, which has shown just how seriously Australia<br />
regards the challenge of exporting, and how closely business<br />
and government can work to meet the challenge.<br />
But the task is, as we all know, a substantial one, and much<br />
remains to be done. In my statement to the Parliament on<br />
March 12 I will take stock of our progress and outline the<br />
Government's strategy for the further medium and long-term<br />
economic development of Australia.<br />
As for this program we are launching today, it would be<br />
unfair and unwise to expect immediate or spectacular<br />
results. </p>
<p>3.<br />
But I do believe,-from the-wholehearted support-that is<br />
being put into it from all sectors of the productive economy<br />
primary, secondary and tertiary and from Government<br />
itself, that it will, at the very least, be another step<br />
along the road to success, which will complement the other<br />
policy initiatives we are taking and the other positive<br />
efforts being made throughout the Australian community.<br />
The creation of the International Business Program confirms<br />
the synergy between business and Government in this country,<br />
and it represents an opportunity to position ourselves to<br />
make the best international use of our national resources.<br />
So I congratulate all those connected with the International<br />
Business Program and I express my confident hopes for your<br />
full and successful program throughout 1991. </p>
