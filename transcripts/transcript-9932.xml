STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP 13/ 95<br />
CONCLUSION OF THE FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING PROGRAM<br />
The announcement by the French Government that it has concluded its nuclear<br />
testing program in the South Pacific brings to an end a program which should never<br />
have started.<br />
Those six tests put at grave risk the cause of international disarmament and nuclear<br />
non-proliferation, flew in the face of France's international obligations and posed<br />
unacceptable risks to the people of the South Pacific.<br />
I welcome President Chirac's renewed commitment to sign the South Pacific Nuclear<br />
Free Zone Treaty and a genuinely Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996.<br />
But these measures and the conclusion of its testing program do not end France's<br />
obligations to the nations of the South Pacific.<br />
Like the other members of the South Pacific Forum, Australia wants France to close<br />
its testing facilities, retaining only those required for environmental monitoring.<br />
Australia also wants France to provide access for the international community to all<br />
data and sites so an independent and comprehensive assessment of the effects of<br />
its testing can be made.<br />
Australia's opposition to the French tests, as I have consistently said, is not the<br />
result of any hostility to France itself or the people of France, or to France's role in<br />
the Pacific. We have been opposed to this single indefensible decision to abandon<br />
its own moratorium on nuclear testing.<br />
Beyond the immediate and urgent need to conclude a Comprehensive Test Ban<br />
Treaty this year, Australia now looks for a new commitment from France and the<br />
other nuclear weapon states to meet their obligations under Article VI of the Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty for genuine steps towards complete nuclear disarmament.<br />
No-one who heard any of the members of the Canberra Commission on the<br />
Elimination of Nuclear Weapons speak last week can doubt how urgent that need is,<br />
nor that, with the Cold War over, it is now an achievable goal which can increase<br />
global security for all countries. y </p>
