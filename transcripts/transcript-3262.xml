PRIME MINISTER 13 May 1974<br />
PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT TO AUSTRALIAN AUTHORS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced today that<br />
he had approved in principle a Public Lending Right scheme to<br />
benefit Australian authors.<br />
Under the scheme, whose cost would be borne entirely by the<br />
Australian Government, Australian authors would be paid a specified<br />
sum, probably fifty cents, for each copy of their books available<br />
for loan from Australian public libraries.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the undertaking to introduce such a<br />
scheme was given in his policy speech in 1972. A report has been<br />
prepared by a committee made up of representatives of the Literature<br />
Board of the Australian Council for the Arts, the library profession,<br />
the Australian Society of Authors and the Australian Book Publishers<br />
Association. Mr. Whitlam said the plan did not require legislation and<br />
would apply as from 1 April 1974. Amounts equivalent to 25% of the<br />
sums due for a full year would be paid to writers before the end<br />
of the financial year.<br />
The cost of the scheme in its first full year would be<br />
approximately $ 530,000.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the scheme offered justice to Australian<br />
authors which was long overdue. Seven European countries already<br />
had such schemes, and New Zealand introduced one early this year.<br />
Payments based on a stocktaking survey of Australian libraries<br />
would be available to Australian authors, wherever they resided,<br />
and to authors normally resident in Australia. Payments would<br />
not be restricted to books published in Australia. </p>
