EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FEDERATED IRON WORKERS ASSOCIATION<br />
SYDNEY 13 AUGUST 1985<br />
I am very pleased to have been able to Join you here today<br />
for the opening of the Federated Iron Workers new<br />
headquarters.<br />
This new headquarters is a great achievement on the part of<br />
both the FIA leadership and its members. Coming at the<br />
same time as the historic campaign for the amalgamation of<br />
the FIA and the Australasian Society of Engineers nears its<br />
climax gives added point to the occasion.<br />
We have here today a very clear reflection of your<br />
achievements in the past and your confidence in the future.<br />
It is precisely in the same sense that I take pride as<br />
Prime Minister of the Labor Government in being with you<br />
today. It is particularly appropriate that I share that pride in<br />
our achievements and our confidence in the future with you<br />
because you are such an important part of the great<br />
Australian trade union movement which has been so centrally<br />
involved in posting those achievements.<br />
It is about time that some of the nonsense being talked<br />
lately in some quarters about the relationship between the<br />
Federal Government and the trade union movement be<br />
addressed directly, and be demolished.<br />
All Australian Governments of whatever political persuasion<br />
necessarily have a relationship with the trade union<br />
movement. Few will have forgotten the relationship of the<br />
previous Government.<br />
it helped to create the worst economic recession in<br />
Australia for 50 years. It saw Australians worse off in<br />
fundamental economic terms in terms of employment<br />
opportunities foregone, high levels of inflation and a<br />
decline in real living standards. None of this was<br />
necessary. </p>
<p>it was a relationship promoted by a Government which had no<br />
semblance of a wages policy. When their hectoring of the<br />
unions and their lecturing of the Arbitration Commission<br />
did not produce the results they wanted, they moved to<br />
create the environment for, and readily acquiesced in, the<br />
abandonment of any form of centralised wage fixation from<br />
31 July 1981. We have been living with the disastrous<br />
economic and social consequences ever since.<br />
The ensuing wages explosion and associated economic<br />
ineptitude of that Government produced for the first time<br />
in this country's history, simultaneous double-digit<br />
inflation and traumatically high levels of unemployment.<br />
in the 12 months before the change of Government 160,000<br />
jobs disappeared and unemployment increased by over a<br />
quarter of a million. Inflation reached more than twice<br />
the OECD average in the same period.<br />
The Labor Government was elected in March 1983 to turn the<br />
situation around. Australia was then in deep crisis as I<br />
say, the worst economic crisis for more than 50 years; a<br />
searing crisis of the national spirit after seven years of<br />
confrontation and division.<br />
We sought to bring Australians together again, to work<br />
together. Our aim was, together, to beat back the crisis,<br />
to restore hope, to restore growth, confidence and a sense<br />
of United purpose to this nation.<br />
Together we have done it.<br />
We have made the turning around of the economy and the<br />
ending of the confrontationist approaches of our<br />
predecessors the central piece of the Government's<br />
strategy. The Accord with the trade unions has been critical to the<br />
success of this strategy.<br />
From the beginning we were convinced that the continued<br />
success of the Accord was the absolute condition for<br />
achieving a sustained recovery without inflation.<br />
Let no one belittle the achievements that have been won<br />
through the Accord, for Australia's economic recovery in<br />
the last two years has been impressive by any standards.<br />
The latest OECD Economic Survey of Australia clearly and<br />
authoritatively documents the extent of that achievement.<br />
The OECD has registered how the recovery of activity in<br />
Australia has been more rapid than the OECD average, how<br />
unemployment has fallen, and how inflation has been reduced<br />
significantly. The OECD sees the Australian economy " well<br />
placed to enter the third year of recovery with demand<br />
growing strongly and unemployment falling further" </p>
<p>The OECD attributes this achievement at least in part, to<br />
our pursuit of sound Government policies. It recognises<br />
that the Accord with the trade union movement has been<br />
central to the Government's prices and incomes policy,<br />
noting that it has played an important role in the fight<br />
against inflation since its introduction in 1983.<br />
The most dramatic and important measure of the Government's<br />
economic success has been in the creation of new jobs. I'm<br />
proud to proclaim to you as workers that the growth in<br />
employment of around 410,000 since April, 1983 is greater<br />
than has ever been achieved in a comparable period in<br />
Australia. I do not believe that there has been a<br />
comparably important economic achievement for over three<br />
decades. It is unfortunate in the rough and tumble of politics that<br />
the scale of this achievement can be lost sight of by some.<br />
I am not surprised that our political opponents, who<br />
destroyed jobs, should now seek to denigrate the<br />
Government's achievement. But the trade unions and the<br />
Australian community generally can and should take pride in<br />
the achievement. For the growth in employment and the<br />
reduction in unemployment to the lowest level for almost<br />
three years has taken place in the context of a new<br />
spirit of industrial peace and harmony; cb-operation<br />
between government, business and trade unions; and renewed<br />
national confidence and self-esteem.<br />
And we can take pride as a nation in this achievement,<br />
secure in the knowledge that it will continue as we move<br />
confidently towards our goal of creating 500,000 jobs<br />
during our first three years in office.<br />
In the next few months we must address the challenge of the<br />
depreciation that has occurred since the end of 1984. As a<br />
Government we urge all sections of the Australian<br />
community, including the trade union movement, to exercise<br />
restraint until we have absorbed the inflationary impact of<br />
depreciation.<br />
on wages, it is now clear that real growth must be somewhat<br />
lower than would otherwise have occurred. Deferral of the<br />
foreshadowed productivity wage round, discounting and the<br />
timing of future wage adjustments are all relevant in<br />
determining the position the Government will take before<br />
the Arbitration Commission. In this we will be concerned<br />
with creating more jobs and making existing jobs more<br />
secure. I know your members will identify with this<br />
commitment. I have every confidence that the Accord is sufficiently<br />
flexible to again deliver for Australia the kind of wages<br />
growth and industrial environment necessary to create jobs,<br />
just as it has done since early 1983.<br />
The recent economic achievements of our nation which I have<br />
outlined today have depended critically on the co-operation<br />
of the trade union movement. But neither the trade union<br />
movement nor individual unions can ultimately determine the<br />
Government's approach to any issue. </p>
<p>The recent economic achievements of our nation which I have<br />
outlined today have depended critically on the co-operation<br />
of the trade union movement. But neither the trade union<br />
movement nor individual unions can ultimately determine the<br />
Government's approach to any issue.<br />
In this context I should make it clear that no Government<br />
can tolerate, or in any way acquiesce, in the forms of<br />
unionism perpetrated by groups such as the BLF. Their<br />
complete disdain for the law, their frequent resort to<br />
practices of thuggery and physical coercion, have no place<br />
in our society.<br />
My Government will move, on the first day Parliament<br />
resumes, to legislate for the deregistration of the BLF.<br />
our complete refusal to abide the violent extremism of the<br />
BLF in no way diminishes the Australian Government's<br />
commitment to working constructively and deliberately with<br />
the main-stream Australian union movement.<br />
on the other hand, our political opponents are committed to<br />
the destruction of the Accord.. They would propose ending<br />
central wage fixing based on wage indexation, and would<br />
close down the institutions which give form and substance<br />
to the Accord the Economic Planning Advisory Council,<br />
the Advisory Committee on Prices and Incomes and the Prices<br />
Surveillance Authority.<br />
Indeed, they would take the wage fixation process out of<br />
the Arbitration system, leaving it to a process of direct<br />
negotiation between employer and employee, to a process of<br />
trial by strength, to a process that would rapidly<br />
degenerate into a situation of complete anarchy. They<br />
would sabotage the Accord and its achievements and unleash<br />
on this country another debilitating round of inflation and<br />
a new wages explosion of the kind which emerged in 1981<br />
from exactly the same policy as they now espouse again.<br />
Their approach is a recipe for economic disaster.<br />
As I said in my policy speech last year<br />
" The central achievement of the past 20 months<br />
restored growth with reduced inflation, would be<br />
wrecked, with all that would mean for employment, for<br />
interest rates, and for the standard of living of the<br />
weaker sections of the community, especially our young<br />
and our pensioners, for everything that millions of<br />
ordinary Australians can now hope for themselves and<br />
their families."<br />
As members of the FIA you would all be particularly aware<br />
how the processes of the Accord have restored conditions<br />
for a prosperous Australian manufacturing sector.<br />
The Australian manufacturing industry is now better<br />
positioned than it has been for many years. </p>
<p>The Labor Government has given unprecedented attention to<br />
the development of outward-looking, internationally<br />
competitive Australian industries.<br />
in part this has been achieved by an economic policy<br />
approach which has produced an economy more resilientt more<br />
open to change, and more able to respond to changing<br />
economic conditions. In that regard the floating of the<br />
Australian dollar, the admission of foreign banks and our<br />
moves to eliminate unnecessary regulatory controls, have<br />
been important.<br />
It has also been necessary to move deliberately to ensure<br />
that Australian industry structures are made more<br />
responsive to changes in both domestic and international<br />
demand. The turn around in the steel industry bears eloquent<br />
testimony to the success of the approach we have adopted.<br />
As with the economy at large, the situation in this<br />
industry has improved dramatically. Raw steel production<br />
by BHP over the first 12 months of the steel plan was 11<br />
per cent higher than the corresponding figure for the<br />
previous year, with production close to the company's<br />
operating capacity. Authorised capital expenditure by BHP<br />
in the Steel Division topped $ 850 million in July, already<br />
in excess of the figure agreed to in the plan.<br />
Productivity per employee has averaged 256 tonnes in 1984,<br />
well above the 1983 level and above the level of 250 tonnes<br />
of raw steel per employee as aimed for in the plan.<br />
An indication of the commitment of the unions to the plan<br />
is that the number of stoppages in the BHIP Steel Division,<br />
on an average monthly basis, is well below that of the<br />
figures recorded in 1981 and 1982 and similar to that of<br />
the low levels of 1983.<br />
The Steel Division of BHP is now profitable, creating both<br />
the capacity to undertake continued investment and the<br />
incentive to maintain a viable industry with secure<br />
employment. Senior BHiP executives say that the<br />
improvements in competitiveness are paving the way for<br />
expanded steel production for export.<br />
Only to the extent that Australian industry is competitive<br />
can we be confident of making further inroads into the<br />
intolerably high levels of unemployment that still remain,<br />
and being sure that those now in jobs will be able to enjoy<br />
job security into the future. This is fundamental to the<br />
Labor Government's approach to economic management.<br />
It is in the interests of all Australians that the task so<br />
successfully begun in creating many more jobs, be carried<br />
forward. We will only be able to do this in an environment<br />
of co-operation, in an environment where the Government,<br />
the business community and the union movement remain<br />
committed to the task of national reconciliation and<br />
national recovery. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Strong foundations have been established; we must now build<br />
on them, build on them in ways that will guarantee future<br />
prosperity for all Australians.<br />
It is in this spirit and because I know the commitment of<br />
this great union to these fundamental principles that I<br />
am pleased to formally open your Conference today and to<br />
proceed to the official opening of this great new building. </p>
