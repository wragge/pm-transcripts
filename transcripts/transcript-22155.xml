    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will travel to India from 5 to 8 March, visiting New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.</p>
<p>  This visit will be an important opportunity to advance Australia's foreign and trade policy interests with a country of key and growing importance to Australia.  I will be accompanied by a high-level delegation of business representatives with interests in India, whose presence demonstrates the importance Australia places on deepening commercial linkages with India.</p>
<p>While in India I will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and participate in Cabinet talks with Indian ministers representing portfolios of key interest to Australia.  I will also call on the President of India and meet other leading Indian political figures, including Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi.  During my visit it is anticipated that a number of agreements will be signed in various fields including trade, defence, science and air services.</p>
<p>India is an increasingly influential global and regional player whose interests converge with Australia's.  We work together constructively on key international issues - most recently on the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate and at the East Asia Summit - and the discussions I will have while in India will add impetus to our growing strategic relationship.</p>
<p>  In recent years India has embarked upon a path of reform, transforming itself into a dynamic and vibrant economy.  In 2005, two-way trade between Australia and India in goods and services reached $9.4 billion.  My visit will be a timely opportunity to encourage further expansion in our already productive relationship.</p>
