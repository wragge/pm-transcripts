PRIME MINISTER,<br />
TRANSCRIPT Or INTERVIEWfTALKBACK WITH GERRY GANNON, 6W F ABC<br />
RADIO 30 JUNE 1992<br />
E AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
GANNON: At your breakfast this morning you were talking<br />
about economic growth of 4.5% A market analyst I have just<br />
spoken with said a bit optimistic, he reckons may be 2/ 2.5%<br />
PM: I think most of the private forecasters think<br />
as we do. The economy in picking up and it's picking up in<br />
the first instance in Western Australia and in Queensland in<br />
the two large agricultural and mining states. Part of that is<br />
because national economic policy has preferred now for most of<br />
the last decade the things we do comparatively well, where we<br />
have a comparative advantage and we have a comparative<br />
advantage in minerals and we have it in food and the<br />
structural change which has been on now for nearly a decade<br />
has Buited very much western Australia and Queensland and as a<br />
result they are recovering now I think more quickly than the<br />
other states, but we expect across the year quite reasonable<br />
rates of growth.<br />
GANNON: But despite that forecast for growth you don't<br />
see any great joy in the unemployment front?<br />
PM: Employment is picking up in Western Australia,<br />
the trends here an Tin Queensland are quite good and NSW<br />
employment has picked up as well but it is patchy across the<br />
country. See what's happened is businesses have become quite<br />
lean now they are much more productive. That is they are<br />
producing a similar sort of output with fewer people and that<br />
is called productivity. Now as the economy grows they will<br />
reach a point where they have to put more people on. That is<br />
they won't be able to go down their productivity mine any<br />
further looking for efficiencies and they will simply just<br />
have to engage more people and it's that lag between growth<br />
and employment which pulls up behind, it is the lag we are<br />
living through now. </p>
<p>GANNONs So productivity is helping keep some us out of<br />
work in fact?<br />
P~ t That's exactly right.<br />
GANNONs Let's go to some calls and a couple of<br />
listeners who couldn't hang about ask you, what can federal<br />
and state governments do to encourage the planting of<br />
harvestable timber forests and what impact might this have on<br />
unemployment? PM: I think we do have great opportunities in<br />
Au * stralia with forest products and plantation hardwoods and<br />
sof twoods are going to be I think part of our future and some<br />
of the large companies are now into plantations and see this<br />
as a way out of native f orests but I think it is going to be<br />
one of the things we can do well. How much we need to do<br />
beyond the sort or general incentive we have got there for<br />
write of fs and depreciation and low interest rates and the<br />
rest I don't know but, so far there has been no inhibition to<br />
the planting of plantations.<br />
GANNON; Mnother, question Prime Minister, you made some<br />
comments I think it was at the weekend concerning the image of<br />
Australians and the ocker image. A male listener wants to<br />
know what about the image of some of our politicians who sort<br />
of tend to sport an ocker image f rom time to time. Do you<br />
think that might need addressing?<br />
PM: I think the subtle things about Australia I<br />
made the point the other day f or instance the United Nations<br />
representative on the Committee on the Elimination of<br />
Discrimination Against Women, I presented Ambassador Tallaway<br />
with Australia's second report and she made the point that<br />
policy in relation to women in this country is really second<br />
to none around the world the changes through the 1980s.<br />
That's not known around the world, a lot of our cultural,<br />
scientific, technological achievements. For instance in aged<br />
care policy we are now leading the world, that's not known. I<br />
would like other things to be known about Australia other than<br />
we put a-shrimo on the bar0! beqqe you know what I mean.<br />
GA1NNONs But that has served us well.<br />
PM: That served us very well, it served us very<br />
well with an important audience, important market,<br />
particularly in the USA and it does very well and<br />
appropriately typifies the outdoor image of Australia but<br />
there are other images as we know. This is a subtle country<br />
and it's got a lot of texture about it and if that is exposed<br />
to some of the big markets you will get the people who are<br />
interested in those things coming here.<br />
GANNONsGANNON: Let's take some calls. </p>
<p>TERRYt I am not going to complain about anything which<br />
is probably a let up for you. I just want to assure you of my<br />
support I think you are probably in my lifetime, I am 47, the<br />
first really Australian Prime Minister we have had.<br />
PM8 Thank you for saying so.<br />
TERRY: And you are a leader, you are leading us, the<br />
people might not want to go where you want to lead them at the<br />
moment but I think in time they will look back and I think you<br />
will be looked upon kindly.<br />
PM3 Can I just respond and just say this to you,<br />
thank you for the remarks but what I am trying to do in this,<br />
that the old Australia the Australia of the 1970s which was in<br />
the end a piece of industrial archaeology, old smokestack<br />
industries that couldn't survive the competitiveness of the<br />
area we live in or the rest of the world. We have opened it<br />
up so that the areas of comparative advantage which for<br />
instance western Australia enjoys can give Australians higher<br />
levels of growth and wealth and at the same time as we are<br />
doing that structural change which is still continuing despite<br />
the fact that it has been overlaid in the last couple of years<br />
by a recession, when we come out we will come out with a low<br />
inflation recovery and a lot of productive economy into the<br />
1990s which can employ lots of people and as we are doing that<br />
I want us to declare for Australia, to say we are a unique<br />
country and we want to advertise ourselves as unique and<br />
present ourselves as unique. So if I can do some of those<br />
things I will be very happy.<br />
MARIE: I would like to ask Mr Keating why can't the<br />
dependent spouse rebate be substantially increased?<br />
PM: We have increased it a couple of times Marie<br />
over the period of time but most particularly we have put<br />
support into support for children by way of the family<br />
allowance supplement where most of the growth has gone and<br />
into the family allowance. The dependent spouse rebate is for<br />
generally a taxpayer with one dependent and it's mostly for<br />
taxpayers whose family are of f their hands who may have a wife<br />
at home and the DSR is some tax compensation for that<br />
dependency but the main dependency of life is children and<br />
that is why we have always focussed that into them.<br />
MARIE: I just feel that the $ 1,300 or round about that<br />
mark isn't enough incentive for one parent to stay at home and<br />
be a parent and there is too many families where both parents<br />
are going of f to work and if there was more, if that rebate<br />
was a lot greater like triple it or even greater there may be<br />
more incentive for one of the parents to be at home.<br />
PM: It's not meant as an incentive to stay at home,<br />
it's a tax trade off against the tax free threshhold which if<br />
you are in the workforce is $ 5,400, that is before you pay a </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) dollar of tax you have to earn $ 5,400 and the<br />
tax payable on that in some way the dependent spouse rebate<br />
goes to compensate for the benefit which is bestowed on a<br />
taxpayer of being able to earn $ 5,400 free of tax. it's a<br />
sort of an offset but it's not an incentive to stay at home.<br />
ROB; I would like to ask if you intend to introduce<br />
some sort of tax break on income earned from interest because<br />
it's a great worry to retirees particularly since the interest<br />
they are getting is pretty low anyway. There is a good<br />
article in yesterday's West Australian on page 5 by the An~ I<br />
Bank which doesn't mention retirees specifically but it says<br />
there of course it would help to boost the national savings.<br />
I wonder if you have any plans to do that within perhaps the<br />
coming Budget?<br />
PM: A lot of the problem about interest income was<br />
a large part of it was inflationary. If you look a couple of<br />
years back you had 6 or let's say you had a nominal, a<br />
real rate of interest of 4 on top of an inflation rate of 7,<br />
you had a nominal interest rate of 11, but on that 7, the 7<br />
was taxable. in other words we were collecting tax on that<br />
inflationary component as well as on the real rate of in<br />
other words we were collecting tax on the 7 and the 4, well<br />
that 7 is now 1.5 and so as that inflation rate has come down<br />
the distortion of tax upon interest has greatly diminished and<br />
so we are at a position now where the economic system is<br />
working much better than it was in the taxation of interest<br />
income when we had this inflation distortion there, so I know<br />
the rate. are low but so too is the rate of inflation.<br />
GANNON: Do you anticipate some trouble in this area for<br />
instance with self funded retirees who a couple of years ago<br />
when interest rates were like 13, 14, 15% putting their money<br />
in and being able to live of f it, now many of them are finding<br />
they can't live off it.<br />
PM3 Those same high interest rates slowed the<br />
economy down and they were only a -tempo6rary thing. It's the<br />
long run thing that matters and a few years before that the<br />
interest rates were lower again but again then the inflation<br />
rate was around 10%. So if you are inflating around 10 and<br />
your interest rate is around 11 or 12 you are not as well off<br />
as you are inflating around 1.5 or 2 with interest rates of 4<br />
or 5. You are actually better of f now than you were then.<br />
GANNONs So it balances out you think?<br />
PM: Well it's the point I made a moment ago Gerry<br />
that is when we had interest rates of 11/ 12% we had 7 or 8% of<br />
that being inflation and yet we were collecting tax on that 7<br />
or Whereas now we are only collecting tax on the real<br />
interest rate mostly which is 1.5% plus 3.5 or 4 real, so it's<br />
actually better now because people, the prices they face<br />
outside are only of the order of 1 to 2%. </p>
<p>GAN4NON: Someone who is about to saddle themself with a<br />
now mortgage Prim. Minister, have you ever considered giving a<br />
tax break on mortgages?<br />
PM: Well the break we have given on mortgages is<br />
low inflation and we have now got mortgage interest rates<br />
running at around 10% and we have got an inflation rate which<br />
is now still low and coming down and it may be, I am not sure<br />
exactly how the banks housing books look but I think long term<br />
lower interest rates for housing look a pretty strong thing<br />
and that in the best thing. But if one starts tax preferring,<br />
every country in the world that's had mortgage interest<br />
deductability has rued the day it got it because their whole<br />
national savings pattern gets skewed to putting money into<br />
houses instead of into investment and production which gives<br />
people jobs. So there has got to be that nice balance or<br />
neutrality between commercial investment and housing, but once<br />
you tax prefer housing there is not much point in sitting in a<br />
house without a job.<br />
GANNON: So 10% you reckon it's going to go lower?<br />
PM: I don't know, when I was Treasurer I used to<br />
know pretty well the balance of the banks housing books. I<br />
don't off the top of my head now know that, but given the fact<br />
that inflation is low, inflation and trend ways about a<br />
interest rate in housing is quite high now even though it<br />
is historically low. You understand it's low but in relation<br />
to the inflation rate it's still relatively high.<br />
LEWIS: On 19 September 1985 as Treasurer you<br />
disallowed entertainment expenses as a tax deduction. What<br />
about possibly a tax break for the hospitality industry<br />
because if we are getting more clients we can entertain more<br />
people and engage more staff, buy more stock and get the<br />
wheels of hospitality turning.<br />
PM: I don't think in hindsight that the removal of<br />
the deduction for entertainment did the hospitality industry<br />
any harm because what they did they grew then. What happened<br />
restaurants that were charging high prices for lunch time<br />
meals and the rest started charging proper prices and that<br />
attracted a greater level of clientele I think. The other<br />
thing is that what this government has done is open Australia<br />
up to a service economy it never ever had bef ore. before we<br />
removed exchange controls, floated the exchange rate, made the<br />
place more competitive that produced for the first time a real<br />
tourism industry in Australia.<br />
LEWIS: But Prime Minister if more people are using<br />
restaurants and hotels surely that is going to create more<br />
staff and more jobs and more money for the government. The<br />
restauranteurs and the hoteliers are not going to cop all the<br />
lolly and over the years I have seen many many high powered<br />
people and very few of them are putting the snouts in the<br />
trough. </p>
<p>PM: The trouble is the Tax Commissioner can't be at<br />
every table deciding whether a lunch is for business or for<br />
pleasure and that is the problem and the other thing is there<br />
is no reason why lunches should be tax preferred. In other<br />
words restaurants should be tax preferred because if we then<br />
decide that buildings should be tax preferred, mortgages<br />
should be tax preferred, everything else tax preferred there<br />
is no preference for anybody. one industry only gets a<br />
preference at the expense of another but if every industry<br />
gets the same preference there is no general preference, so<br />
once you start, I mean the hospitality industries have had a<br />
boom in Australia in the 80&amp;, an absolute blow out and they<br />
have done it with a neutral tax system but if we go back to<br />
the days of preferring lunches and trying to basically give<br />
those people who can spend time at lunch, particularly a<br />
business lunch and make it deductible I think it is unfair the<br />
rest of the people who are having sandwiches at work and<br />
paying for it etc. It's one debate which I can say happily in<br />
Australia virtually disappeared but when it disappeared it was<br />
in the middle 80. and in the 5 or 6 years since the<br />
hospitality industry have literally expanded as no one in<br />
those industries would have ever believed they could have.<br />
LORETTA: I would like to know why when you were<br />
Treasurer you put gold tax on the gold industry because this<br />
caused a lot of hurt and a lot of unemployment.<br />
PM: It was not we put a tax on it we just removed<br />
the exemption. You see every other mineral is taxed, iron ore<br />
is taxed, nickel is taxed, lead, silver and zinc are taxed,<br />
why not gold.<br />
LORETTA: They put that money back into more research to<br />
do more and make more employment here and a lot of people have<br />
been hurt.<br />
PM: As the point I have just made to the gentleman<br />
before you asked me about -free-lunches and restaurants. Any<br />
industry which is tax preferred will grow faster than ones<br />
that are not but the question is why should they be tax<br />
preferred, why should someone digging gold, mining gold be<br />
preferred over someone mining nickel.<br />
LORETTA: Because that money went back into making more<br />
PM: A lot of went into foreign mining companies and<br />
was shot back overseas and the point is in a country like this<br />
the business corporate savings of Australia should go where<br />
they naturally should go best not where they go by way of tax<br />
preference. LORETTA: But you went to Indonesia and stood there and<br />
really called your own play in front of the whole world. </p>
<p>PM3 Not what I said was that Australians, I was<br />
asked a question about it and I said that Australians need a<br />
representational image of themselves which is unambiguous that<br />
is having a f lag of our own which doesn't have the f lag of<br />
another country in the corner. Just understand this, I don't<br />
have any problems about Britain or with the British<br />
government. I have got the best of relationships with John<br />
Major and the current British government and I have had over<br />
the years with Nigel Lawson before him when ho was the<br />
Chancellor in all the year. I was Treasurer. It's not a<br />
problem at all about Britain# Britain has sensibly acted in<br />
its own best interests. Britain has gone into Europe and<br />
joined the Common Market as I-it sould. We have got to go into<br />
Asia and join the market around here and you have got to go<br />
there looking like yourself, not someone else.<br />
GANNON: Why is all of this so important at this<br />
particular time Prime Minister. People say to me every<br />
morning here on talkback we have got over 10% unemloment a<br />
sluggish economy yet Keating is going arudbgigthe<br />
f lag, the Queen_ and now the oath of alleiance. why are all<br />
these things so important right now~<br />
PM: I am not bagging the Queen, because they are<br />
important in an economic sense. My conservative opponents say<br />
it's a distraction but frankly as you say Gerry, every day you<br />
are talking about the economy, unemployment on radio, there is<br />
no way other than addressing that issue. I don't ever try not<br />
to address it directly but to say you have got to address<br />
that, only that and that nothing else matters, I mean the fact<br />
is that we have a great opportunity now to tie in with the<br />
Asia Pacific. When I was in Indonesia Ian Taylor was up<br />
there, the Deputy Premier opening a representative Western<br />
Australia office in Surabyu and that is the kind of<br />
relationships which we are going to see Western Australia grow<br />
as it links into that part of the world and the rest of<br />
Australia generally.<br />
GANNON i Do our near neighbours in Asia really confuse<br />
us with a British identity because I mean they live next<br />
PM: No they think we are not certain whether we<br />
want to deal with them. They are not sure whether our mind<br />
set is basically in Europe or North America, is it just the<br />
place we fly over, do we really want to deal with them, they<br />
think we are ambivalent about that. But if we actually go and<br />
say to them we are here we do want to deal with you, but we<br />
deal with you as a independent country, we deal with you as a<br />
country with its own traditions, it's own culture, it's not a<br />
derivative of some other place. I mean the best reaction to<br />
all of this stuff has come basically from the Asia Pacific,<br />
from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and that where they are<br />
saying thank God Australia is starting to sort of call its own<br />
tune and that will make an enormous economic difference, not<br />
just social dif ference, "' ut economic dif ference, particularly<br />
to places like Western Australia. </p>
<p>GANNONs Yesterday we discussed on talkback, because you<br />
made some comments about it at the weekend, changing the oath<br />
of allegiance for migrants so it's better to reflect their<br />
commitment to Australia. What brought that on?<br />
PM: Because I think it's time that it happened. We<br />
have tried to do it twice by legislative amendment in the<br />
past, in the 70s and 80s. That is when someone makes a<br />
commuitment, they make a commitment to Australia and its<br />
values, that is the commitment In fact they are making. When<br />
someone goes to a naturalisation ceremony they are making a<br />
commitment to Australia, they are saying I want to be an<br />
Australian, I am committing myself to the values of this<br />
Society. If that is what they think let's say it.<br />
GANNON: There are some people who called us yesterday<br />
who said that they didn't become citizens because of having to<br />
take out the oath of allegiance to the Queen. Are you<br />
conscious that there is a great number of people like that?<br />
PM: You mean they became citizens<br />
GANNON: They didn't become citizens because they were<br />
not prepared to take an oath of allegiance to the Queen.<br />
PM1 There must be a few like that I don't know. I<br />
have a great regard for the job the Queen has done in the<br />
heavy constitution of ceremonial tasks which have been her lot<br />
now for so many years, 40 years. But in this respect in terms<br />
of naturalisation and taking citizenship, the people who do<br />
that do it to become citizens of Australia and pick up the<br />
values of this country, this continent. All I am saying is<br />
let's say so.<br />
GANNON: There was a question too put to me yesterdaty<br />
about MrsKeating. She is Dutch born, is she an Australian<br />
citizen? PM: Yes she is, yea.<br />
RON: I am a 59 year old unemployed person, been<br />
unemployed for nearly 3 years now and Mr Keating's figures on<br />
unemployed with the kids, 15-19 year olds doesn't he trust his<br />
statisticians or does he have to mess about with the figures<br />
because the February figures which I have gone over because I<br />
have got plenty of time because I am unemployed, for females<br />
15-19 40% of them were seeking full time work and with the<br />
boys, 35.7%. The whole thing about this unemployment issue<br />
there is too much money being spent on people like JoblJink all<br />
it is is jobs for the boys, they are a hangover from when they<br />
had JET which was a pretty good thing they had out for getting<br />
women back in the workforce.<br />
PM: Let me just come to the point. There is what<br />
we call the age group, the age cohort 15-19 have 1.3 million </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) young people in it, that is the total population<br />
15-191 122,000 of those are actually In the workforce looking<br />
f or work that's about 9.8% r that's the number. Now that is<br />
getting confused with the notion of those in training and<br />
school and those out of training and school. In other words<br />
there in about 7 in 10 in training and school and 3 in 10 not<br />
in training in school but only 1 in 10 are looking for work.<br />
GANNONi But a great number of those<br />
PM: Even that is too many, that is the point I am<br />
making, there is no point people arguing whether it's 1 in<br />
or 2 in 10 or 3 in 10. The fact is even 10%, 122,000 is still<br />
too many and that is why we are trying to find now a<br />
breakthrough on entry level training wages for young people so<br />
that companies are not bearing the cost of the training but<br />
the Commonwealth will pick up the creation of a training place<br />
in TAPE and that the employers should be picking up simply<br />
that wage component. Now that is a matter which is going to<br />
be and has been disagreed by the workforce and the trade<br />
unions over a long period of time. It's one of the things we<br />
hope we can sensibly discuss and get a breakthrough on it at<br />
this meeting I am holding next month.<br />
CANNON: A great number of those young people who are in<br />
training are unskilled, are only there sheltering from the<br />
harsh reality of unemployment.<br />
PM: 1 don't think that is right. There may be some<br />
but look in 1959 when the economy was booming when there were<br />
a lot of jobs around we still had 7 in 10 staying on in the<br />
secondary schools. That was 3 in 10 in 1983, the Liberal<br />
Party of Australia were quite happy to see only 3 kids in<br />
get a secondary education and 7 in 10 go untrained in the<br />
workforce. That is now 8 in 10 are completing secondary<br />
school and we have added 50% of university places to the<br />
system. That is since 1985 we have added about 120,000 places<br />
to university that is the equivalent of a dozen full<br />
universities and about 35 or 40% of the kids leaving secondary<br />
school now go into universities. A weakness in the system is<br />
now technical and further education and that is why I have<br />
been discussing that with the Premier and with the States to<br />
try and pick up TAPE and make it a better system so as that<br />
now 8 in 10 kids come out of secondary school they either go<br />
into universities or into a much more developed TAPE system.<br />
So they come out with a trained position and they are not<br />
looking for jobs as unskilled people.<br />
JACKs Other than your prowess in parliamentary<br />
slanging matches and your fluency in economic jargon, your<br />
recent investment in a pig farm, have you any qualifications<br />
or experience to justify your Labor Caucus appointment as<br />
Prime Minister? If so what are they? </p>
<p>PM What they are vas and I was one of the feow<br />
people in Australian public life prepared to blow the whistle<br />
on the industrial archaeology which the Liberal Party left us<br />
with. old smokestack industries that were going out<br />
backwards, an uncompetitive exchange rate, not enough jobs<br />
ever to pick up the kind of growth that we are likely to have<br />
in employment and basically trying to turn the place into a<br />
modern industrial state. That's basically what I did as<br />
Treasurer and one of the reasons I think the party elected me<br />
as Prime Minister. Can I just say about the piggery, I have<br />
always practiced, I like to practice what I preach, I have<br />
always said don't go investing in buildings, don't get into<br />
speculation, don't punt on inflation, we don't want the<br />
country buying office bocks, they should be doing productive<br />
j~ sensible things. Now to walk as I did out of the Treasury in<br />
June and the first thing to go and do is buy an office<br />
building in a depressed market and do exactly the thing I have<br />
told everyone else not to do was not something I was going to<br />
do. So I thought what can I do which is productive which will<br />
employ people which will to our comparative strengths,<br />
which will add value, which will do the very thing that I have<br />
been preaching, that is building on comparative strength in<br />
food or in agriculture using high technology, value adding and<br />
exporting. So I decided in the 6 months that I was out to<br />
turn my hand at the things I have been asking other people to<br />
do. GANNON&amp; Why pigs though, why not charollais cattle?<br />
PMI Because I happened to know a f ew people in the<br />
industry and I thought Australia is well placed in the Asia<br />
Pacif ic to do something good about this industry, about the<br />
production of protein and the weakness we always have is in<br />
technology and marketing and I thought I would do that. John<br />
Hewson who said a few words about this or the Liberal Party,<br />
he invested a couple of million dollars in Bellevue Hill. Now<br />
I would rather put an investment in a productive business than<br />
in a piece of real estate playing the old rich game of a bit<br />
of inflation looking after your wealth. That is not the game<br />
I have been playing, it's not the game I have been asking.<br />
Australians to play.<br />
GANNON: So the future looks good for pigs in Australia<br />
does it?<br />
PH$ it looks good for agriculture, adding value and<br />
