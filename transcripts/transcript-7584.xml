CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNUAL DINNER OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN MINING INDUSTRY COUNCIL<br />
CANBERRA 3 MAY 1989<br />
Tomorrow you will be conducting your annual seminar under<br />
the title ' minerals Sustaining the Future'.<br />
It can be predicted with confidence that Australia's future<br />
will remain reliant for many years to come on the export<br />
earnings of our two largest and oldest industries<br />
agriculture and mining.<br />
After all, in 1987-88, processed and unprocessed minerals<br />
contributed some $ 16.6 billion to our export earnings more<br />
than 40 per cent of the total of merchandise exports. That<br />
represents a massive contribution to Australia's wellbeing.<br />
But if the mining industry is to continue this contribution,<br />
many challenges must be overcome in an increasingly complex<br />
international environment.<br />
As one of the world's leading commodity exporters, Australia<br />
is all too familiar with the risks of excessive reliance on<br />
volatile commodity markets. We suffered an enormous loss of<br />
national income some $ 11 billion because of the collapse<br />
of world commodity prices in 1985/ 86.<br />
It is to reduce that vulnerability that the Federal<br />
Government has made such efforts to restructure our economy,<br />
to diversify our exports and to increase our<br />
competitiveness. These efforts.-must continue throughout the<br />
1990s and beyond.<br />
However we need also to address a more immediate threat to<br />
our prosperity one which dramatically magnifies the perils<br />
of our reliance on commodities. I refer to the distortion<br />
of the international marketplace created by the scourge of<br />
protectionism. Protectionism, wherever it occurs, acts to depress world<br />
prices. It stifles demand and imposes substantial costs on<br />
industries and consumers within the protecting countries.<br />
most of the attention about the crippling effects of<br />
protectionism, and much of the pressure for remedial action<br />
that Australia is exerting, has focused on agriculture. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Fair trading producers such as Australia successfully pushed<br />
for agriculture to be placed on the agenda of the Uruguay<br />
Round of GATT negotiations when it was launched in 1986.<br />
Through the Cairns Group, Australia has made reform of<br />
agricultural trade a major priority of foreign and trade<br />
policy, and we recently achieved a very important<br />
breakthrough in Geneva which opens the way for reform.<br />
But that is not to say that other Australian export<br />
industries have not also suffered from the reluctance of our<br />
trading partners to break down the barriers to free<br />
multilateral trade.<br />
In fact, in the crucial coal industry, subsidies and other<br />
support measures in some major economies are seriously<br />
damaging the health of world trade.<br />
For Australia an efficient coal producer and, with the<br />
United States, the largest coal exporter in the world<br />
these subsidies translate into a loss of billions of dollars<br />
in lost export opportunities.<br />
Reducing the massively subsidised coal production in the<br />
European Community and Japan would inevitably open up<br />
greater opportunities for world trade.<br />
In 1987, hard coal production subsidised by the European<br />
Community and Japan totalled 232 million tonnes equivalent<br />
to about 70 per cent of world trade in hard coal.<br />
Subsidised steaming coal production was around 175 million<br />
tonnes about the same volume as the total of world trade<br />
in this product.<br />
And coal subsidies are on the increase.<br />
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, annual<br />
total subsidies paid to the coal industry rose by 70 per<br />
cent in the four years to 1988.<br />
These German subsidies have actually grown faster than the<br />
income that either Australia or the US earns from coal<br />
exports. The Japanese are winding back on uncompetitive coal<br />
production, albeit more slowly than we had hoped.<br />
Nonetheless, coal subsidies in Japan have about doubled over<br />
the last four years.<br />
The United Kingdom is also a substantial subsidiser of its<br />
coal industry. Like Germany, Britain is a very large coal<br />
producer with relatively minor imports. The result is<br />
inevitable: coal prices soar for European homes and<br />
industries. British coal prices are some 180% higher than the prices of<br />
imported coals; in Germany the price is some 250% higher.<br />
At the same time, European taxpayers are paying a heavy<br />
burden to keep the subsidies going. </p>
<p>In the European Community, the coal sector received<br />
subsidies totalling some $ US12 billion in 1986 equivalent<br />
to about $ US25,000 per employee.<br />
In other words, restructuring the coal industries in both<br />
countries would not only have a dramatic effect on improving<br />
the market access for efficient producers like Australia.<br />
It would also lead to lower prices for European consumers<br />
and would reduce the heavy subsidies burden on European<br />
taxpayers. So we learn here the same lesson about protectionism that we<br />
learn in agriculture. It hampers the efficient producer and<br />
it weighs down the domestic consumer and taxpayer.<br />
My colleague the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Michael<br />
Duffy, has recently launched a new Australian campaign to<br />
have coal subsidies addressed effectively in the Uruguay<br />
Round of multilateral trade negotiations.<br />
As we have found with agriculture, progress is certain to be<br />
slow. But we must make the effort because the international<br />
trading system cannot tolerate indefinitely the distortions<br />
and unnecessary costs of Europe's self-defeating coal<br />
policies. We must work for the dismantling of coal protectionism, both<br />
bilaterally and in international forums such as the GATT.<br />
Coal protection featured prominently in discussions<br />
yesterday at the inaugural Australia/ FRG Economic<br />
Consultations, building on my talks in Canberra with<br />
Chancellor Kohl last year.<br />
The issue was also discussed in the Australia/ UK Economic<br />
Consultations in March, and I can assure you I will be<br />
pursuing it further in my visit to both Britain and Germany<br />
next month.<br />
The Government has played a leading role in the Natural<br />
Resource Base Products Negotiating Group, which in the GATT<br />
talks covers all mining and energy products. We will<br />
continue to work closely with industry, through, for<br />
example, the AMIC Trade Committee and the Government's Trade<br />
Advisory Board, in developing our negotiating priorities and<br />
strategy in the Uruguay Round.<br />
The Government is also promoting trade and co-operation<br />
opportunities for the minerals industry through involvement<br />
in a range of specialist bilateral consultative forums with<br />
major markets and some fellow producers. The list already<br />
includes Korea, China, Thailand and Canada, and arrangements<br />
are in train for a new forum with Indonesia.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
What we have done to increase the opportunties for the<br />
mining industry at the international level is being<br />
complemented here in Australia. </p>
<p>You will be aware that the Government is engaged in a major<br />
program of micro-economic reform to improve the efficiency<br />
and effectiveness of our economy.<br />
We have already cut tariffs, floated the dollar, ended the<br />
two airline agreement, deregulated crude oil marketing,<br />
exposed telecommunications to greater competition and<br />
deregulated grain transport and marketing.<br />
Starting next week, a series of ministerial statements will<br />
underline the Government's determination to press ahead with<br />
this program. Together with the April Statement, with its<br />
emphasis on award restructuring as a vital element of wages<br />
and industry policy, those statements will lead to real<br />
productivity improvements throughout the economy.<br />
Perhaps of greatest interest to this audience is our<br />
commitment to effective reform on the waterfront and in<br />
coastal shipping.<br />
This is an essential area of reform shirked by Governments<br />
for decades past where the competitiveness of our<br />
agricultural, manufacturing and mining industries can be<br />
dramatically improved.<br />
The interdependence of mining and coastal shipping is<br />
particularly strong. In 1985/ 86 minerals accounted for over<br />
per cent of total cargo carried on coastal shipping.<br />
So the potential benefits of reform are very large and<br />
action is essential.<br />
As you know, the report of the Inter-State Commission,<br />
released in April, proposes fundamental changes to the way<br />
the waterfront is organised. My colleague Ralph Willis, the<br />
Minister for Transport and Communications, is currently<br />
seeking the views of key participants and the Commission's<br />
recommendations will then be considered by Cabinet.<br />
I am aware that AMIC has welcomed the Commission's<br />
recommendations and I look forward to your co-operation in<br />
implementing reform.<br />
The Government has also received the Report of the Shipping<br />
Reform Task Force, whose recommendations we will be<br />
considering over the next few weeks. I confidently expect<br />
we will be able to announce a program of reforms which will<br />
provide for substantially more efficient and competitive<br />
coastal shipping services.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
These initiatives show our determination to help the mining<br />
industry ' sustain the future' of Australia.<br />
I want to focus now on an issue which is profoundly relevant<br />
to that goal of sustaining the future in a global sense. </p>
<p>You have quoted in your program notes some words taken from<br />
the recent Report of the world Commission on Environment and<br />
Development the . commission which was so ably chaired by<br />
the Prime Minister of Norway, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland.<br />
These quoted words concentrate on the Commission's<br />
recognition of the need to revitalise global economic<br />
growth. So far so good. But you don't quote the words that<br />
immediately follow which provides the all-important " but":<br />
" But many people fear that a more rapidly growing world<br />
economy will apply environmental pressures that are no<br />
more sustainable than the pressures presented by growing<br />
poverty."<br />
Balancing those twin imperatives, the Commission reached its<br />
" overall assessment" that " the international economy must<br />
speed up world growth while respecting the environmental<br />
constraints". That balanced assessment provides the basis for the<br />
Brundtland Report's vision of a sustainable world economy.<br />
we must not succumb to the temptation to put the environment<br />
in one category and development in another, or to imagine<br />
that policy dealing with one does not deal with the other.<br />
If I can quote once more from the Report, this time from its<br />
Foreword, " the environment is where we all live, and<br />
development is what we all do in attempting to improve our<br />
lot within that abode. The two are inseparable."<br />
This Federal Government has certainly proven its credentials<br />
as a Government that recognises the inseparability of these<br />
two values.<br />
We are now creating a means whereby the Australian community<br />
can reach that balance in determining complex issues of<br />
resource use.<br />
Legi slation to establish the Resource Assessment Commission<br />
was introduced into the House of Representatives this<br />
afternoon by my colleague, the Minister for Primary<br />
Industries and Energy, John Kerin.<br />
The RAC will provide a new and important vehicle for<br />
inquiring into, and reporting to the Government on, the<br />
environmental, cultural, social, industry, economic and<br />
other aspects of Australian resources and their uses.<br />
It will be guided by the three policy principles I announced<br />
last November covering the Government's management of<br />
competing claims for resource use. </p>
<p>In summary, these principles are that there should be an<br />
integrated approach to conservation and development; that we<br />
should maximise the net benefits to the community from the<br />
nation's resources; and that we recognise that in some cases<br />
the interests of both conservation and development can be<br />
accommodated while at other times choices will need to be<br />
made. RAC inquiries will not be substitutes for Environment Impact<br />
Statements, which will continue to apply to project<br />
proposals. The Commission's task will be broader: to consider complex<br />
and contentious resource use issues covering whole<br />
industries or regions and to assess the costs and benefits<br />
of alternative or multiple uses of resources.<br />
The P. AC's first reference will be on forestry and timber<br />
resources.<br />
As John Kerin announced, the first chairman of the RAC will<br />
be the Hon. Mr Justice Stewart, currently Chairman of the<br />
National Crime Authority. Mr Justice Stewart has had a<br />
distinguished career and his analytical skills, experience<br />
in the conduct of inquiries and knowledge of government will<br />
serve him, and the community, well in this important new<br />
appointment. As well as advising the Government, the RAC will also<br />
provide a means for significant public involvement. In this<br />
way the Commission's inquiries will make a major<br />
contribution both to informed public debate and to rational<br />
decision making.<br />
The mining industry has pressed for a clear and predictable<br />
process such as this for a considerable time. I believe it<br />
offers all interested parties a very good opportunity to<br />
bring their views on these crucial issues to the<br />
Government's attention.<br />
Complementing the new Commission, the Federal Government has<br />
also sought the States' views on how to improve the<br />
consultative processes between the two levels of government<br />
in both conservation and development portfolios.<br />
We have also invited industry, union and conservation<br />
representatives to participate in a consultative group to<br />
provide another avenue for inputs to the Government.<br />
I hope that through this new consultative group which I<br />
expect will hold its first meeting early in the new<br />
financial year it will be possible to start addressing<br />
issues in a way which will give the general public a clearer<br />
understanding of what concerns are unfounded, what are<br />
problems of substance, and what measures may be necessary to<br />
address them. </p>
<p>I am heartened at the way the Australian Conservation<br />
Foundation and the National Farmers Federation have joined<br />
forces to address Australia's soil degradation problems. I<br />
hope the AMIC and the ACF will find the means to co-operate<br />
in tackling mining issues.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The global view taken by the Brundtland Report attests to an<br />
important change in the public's concern about the<br />
environment. Much of the concern has traditionally, and very properly,<br />
focussed on specific questions: efforts to save the<br />
Franklin river, to protect architectural elements of the<br />
national estate, to safeguard the future of particular<br />
forests or alpine regions with national parks.<br />
But increasingly we are seeing the emergence of genuinely<br />
global environmental problems: the prospects for climatic<br />
change caused by the Greenhouse Effect and the depletion of<br />
the ozone layer, the possibility of the disappearance of<br />
whole species of animals, birds and plants, the massive<br />
consequences of industrial accidents such as Chernobyl or<br />
the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska.<br />
By marking this transition to an increasing adoption of a<br />
global perspective, the Brundtland Report represents a<br />
significant milestone. I have recently invited<br />
Mrs Brundtland to visit Australia because I believe we would<br />
all benefit from hearing her views at first hand.<br />
For Australia's part, we are taking a very active part in<br />
responding to global environmental issues, especially the<br />
Greenhouse Effect and the depletion of the ozone layer.<br />
We have signed the Montreal Protocol which requires<br />
countries to reduce levels of ozone-depleting gases, backing<br />
this up at home with the Ozone Protection Act, one of the<br />
world's most stringent pieces of legislation controlling and<br />
reducing the manufacture and use of chlorofluorocarbons and<br />
halons. Australia needs to be prepared to participate fully and<br />
constructively in what will obviously be an increasing<br />
number of international negotiations and conferences.<br />
In March this year I was represented at an intergovernmental<br />
Conference in the Hague by my Foreign Minister, Gareth<br />
Evans, who played a significant part in negotiating the<br />
Conference resolution.<br />
Federal Cabinet recently formulated a series of principles<br />
to guide Australia's participation in such forums.<br />
I point out to this audience that in formulating these<br />
guidelines for environmental activities, we have placed<br />
proper weight on our economic and trade interests, including<br />
our coal exports. </p>
<p>We decided that in pursuing its international environment<br />
objectives, Australia should support the concept of<br />
sustainable development as a basis for promoting economic<br />
activity in an environmentally sensitive manner and for<br />
protecting and enhancing the interests of current and future<br />
generations. This would involve a commitment to continued, positive,<br />
national and international economic growth in order to<br />
satisfy fully the legitimate socio-economic aspirations of<br />
all communities.<br />
It would also involve the need for close integration of<br />
environment and development policies, including taking full<br />
account of environmental and developmental costs and<br />
benefits in assessing all aspects of economic activity.<br />
We must recognise the need to promote and preserve our<br />
national comparative advantages in addressing outstanding<br />
environmental issues, and to ensure that the burden of<br />
adjustment is carried equitably by the international<br />
community.<br />
An international environmental issue of direct relevance to<br />
the Australian mining industry is the question of mineral<br />
exploration and development in Antarctica.<br />
Mining in-Antarctica is most unlikely to benefit the<br />
Australian mining industry, owing to its adverse effects on<br />
world mineral prices and correspondingly, on the<br />
profitability of Australian mineral developments both in<br />
Australia and overseas. Certainly, subsidised mining cannot<br />
be in the interests of the Australian mining industry, as<br />
AMIC itself has recognised.<br />
My Government has fought subsidies wherever they have<br />
arisen. The prospect of subsidised mining in the Antarctic<br />
represents a direct threat to the unique and fragile<br />
Antarctic environment.<br />
We have all witnessed from the Alaskan oil spill the<br />
appalling damage that can be done to that sort of<br />
environment from unregulated activity. Considered<br />
judgements have to be made about the course of action that<br />
Australia can take which is most likely to result in the<br />
preservation of the Antarctic environment.<br />
The Government will be considering the issue in the<br />
relatively near future. Our objective is clear we simply<br />
must not imperil the unique Antarctic environment and we<br />
will be pursuing with other relevant nations the best course<br />
for ensuring that the Antarctic environment remains<br />
protected. in particular it is a matter I will be taking up with French<br />
Prime Minister Rocard and with other leaders when I am in<br />
Europe next month. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have discussed environmental issues at length tonight in a<br />
forum that might not, at face value, have been the most<br />
receptive to such a discussion.<br />
However I did so because I want to make clear the<br />
Government's determination to achieve a truly balanced<br />
approach to this issue which is of such importance to us<br />
all. I did so as well because I know that as tomorrow's seminar<br />
attests your industry is increasingly becoming involved,<br />
in a constructive way, with the resolution of environmental<br />
issues. I am also conscious of the very considerable contribution<br />
the mining industry itself has made to proper environmental<br />
management, through its work on mine site development and<br />
rehabilitation, and through its involvement in environment<br />
impact assessments of all major projects.<br />
In a broader sense too, the mining industry has played and<br />
will continue to play a most important role in dealing with<br />
the environmental impacts of use of our mineral resources.<br />
The mining and petroleum industries have a good track record<br />
of innovation in developing technologies that save energy,<br />
control emissions and enhance the safety of workers.<br />
The challenge of the future will come from environmental as<br />
well as economic imperatives.<br />
The industries that survive and prosper in the next decade<br />
and beyond will be those that satisfactorily address both<br />
imperatives. </p>
