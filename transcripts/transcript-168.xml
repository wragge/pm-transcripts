HOUSE OF RERESENTATIVES DEBATE ON SOUTH AFRICA<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for External Affairs.<br />
Speaking in the House of Representatives today on the<br />
resolution on South Africa moved by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Calwell,<br />
the Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs, Mr.* Menzies, said:-<br />
The honourable member sentenced himself to half an hour's hard<br />
labour and has now performed the sentence. He began and ended by, I suppose<br />
he would say, twitting me for being so ignorant of the alleged fact that this<br />
matter was before the United Nations a week ago and implied that I am as out<br />
of date as I can be. It is a great pity for the honourable member to become<br />
too eloqu. ent about a matter of that kind unless he gets his facts right. The<br />
fact is that the Security Council sat for the first time to deal with this<br />
matter, or to determine whether it would deal with it, at 5.30 o'clock this<br />
morning, Australian time, and the first business which had to be discussed by<br />
it would be, of course, whether this item should be inscribed and then discussed<br />
in substance. We have, of course, no opportunity to know since 5.30 this<br />
morning, Australian time, what the result has been as to whether it was<br />
inscribed but we do know that that was the first appearance at the United<br />
Nations stage of this matter and so it is a pity that a great deal of this<br />
rhetoric turns out to have been wasted.<br />
As to South Africa's attitude, I would have thought that every<br />
schoolboy knew that South Africa' s attitude is one of complete objection to<br />
this matter being dealt with by United Nations. Somebody says they are<br />
agreeable, but that is a great effort of imagination. The fact is that they<br />
have opposed this matter coming before the United Nations. I have no doubt<br />
they have once more stated the view which their Prime Minister stated only<br />
yesterday in the Parliament at Cape Town, that it is a domestic matter and<br />
that they do not recognise the jurisdiction of the United Nations ick relation<br />
to it. And incidentally, sinrne the honourable gentleman now says that it<br />
is not the shootings so much but the policy of apartheid that we want to deal<br />
with I may tell him that yesterday, in the Parliament at Cape Town, the Prime<br />
Minister stated the position of the Government in relation to jurisdiction,<br />
which is the great question that I was addressing myself to. He stated that<br />
the views of the Government and those views were specifically concurred in by<br />
Sir de Villiers Graaf, the Leader of the Opposition; so there is a bi-partisan<br />
position on this question of jurisdiction in the South African Parliament.<br />
In these circumstances, where you have the party of the present administration<br />
and the party which was the party of Sm-its at one mind in South Africa on this<br />
question of jurisdiction they are by no means of one mind. probably on the<br />
question of internal policy when you find that position, I simply say that<br />
this Parliament as a parliament ant. this Government as a government would be<br />
accepting a grievious responsibility if it sought to invade these policies<br />
of a domestic kind in another country of the British Commonwealth. That after<br />
all, is the essence of what I have said from beginning to end. But, Sir, I<br />
will not take up too muich time on these little imaginary exercises that the<br />
honourable member engaged in. I must want to say this; the motion is much<br />
more violent than the speech. The speech was almost tender at times. The<br />
motion, which has already had great publicity was deliberately designed to<br />
stir up all sorts of feelings of hatred in this community. </p>
<p>-2<br />
The esence of the motion is, of course, its purely political<br />
quality. That is shown by the fact that at no time during the massacres<br />
in Hungary or the widespread killings in Cyprus or the grcat loss of life<br />
occasioned during the Mau Mau attacks in Kenya-whore 13,000 lives were lost<br />
did the Opposition ever submit any resolution or even ask for one. This<br />
time, they think that they see an opportunity of embarrassing the Government<br />
by fanning hatred where there is already too much, and by encouraging<br />
differences in the Commonwealth at a time when mutual urderstandinA was<br />
never more important. That is a broad statement but it is completely<br />
demonstrated by clauses 3, 5 and 6 of the resolution about which I<br />
propose to say something.<br />
Biause 3 says that the opinions expressed by me quite plainly<br />
and temperately I thought in this House will be construed as Australian<br />
condonation of the South African Prime Minister' s statements and attitudes.<br />
That is a most remarkable proposition. Even as a piece of English it has<br />
fantasy in it. I do not kniow what these statements and this attitude are<br />
that have been referred to. I have heard a variety of statements by the<br />
Prime Minister of South Africa. I have heard or read of other things<br />
attributed to him. What these things are that are reforred to in the motion<br />
is not made clear, but o~ ne thing is perfectly clear, and that is that the<br />
South African Prime Minister has done what I venture to say an Australian<br />
Prime Minister would do under similar circumstances. He has promptly ordered<br />
a judicial investigation of those incidents and has appointed two Supreme<br />
Court judges of the highest repute to conduct this investigation.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition says. " We know all that we need to<br />
be told; we know how many people -ocre killed or wounded". But what do<br />
we knov. about the circumstances? Wfhat do we know that enables us, at a<br />
comfortable distance, to sit in judgment on the events in this particular<br />
town on this particular day or night? How can we propose to say, ' We know<br />
everything; we understand the facts porfectly. We sit in judgment. We<br />
condemn!" That is exactly what the judicial investigation will be for.<br />
What I said in this House, was not that the Australian Government<br />
was condoning the events in South Africa. I said the very opposite that<br />
wec were following a policy of non-intervention in what is, though tragic<br />
and terrible, a domestic problem for the Union of South Africa. It is, to me,<br />
a novel and very twisted use of viords to say that non-intervention implies<br />
condonation. The words, of course, are almost exactly opposite in their<br />
significance. ' hen, as a government, we decide not to intervene, that<br />
mea~ ns that we arc not expressing a judgment on domestic policies. Wec may,<br />
as individuals, with tho very limitcd information available to us, think<br />
those policies. disputaole, but as a government, we arc not taking upon<br />
ourselves the grievous responsibility of the sitting in judgment on policies<br />
and on events of which we in Australia, happily, have no experiene, ocing,<br />
as they are, matters of political dispute in South Africa itself.<br />
I now rcfer to the policies or some of their manifestations.<br />
I emphasise that what I tried to indicate on Tuesday and looking at the<br />
Hansard" record I think I did say this was that we are -all entitled to<br />
our own personal feelings which, in the case of most of the people of<br />
j~ ustralia, are feelings of horror and apprehension. But one of the<br />
inhibitions that is laid upon the man who is the head of the Government<br />
of Australia is that his personal feelings are a luxury in wvhich he cannot<br />
publicly indulge when the real problem is what political attitude the<br />
Government should take and express. This is a great responsibility. it<br />
iÃ± oquircs calm judgment and a sense ef responsibility to the future as well<br />
as to the present. That is why we agree with the statement which wias<br />
made by the Prime Minister of Canada a few days ago in his own Parliament.<br />
He said that the oonclusion of his Government -was that at this time no<br />
beneficial purpose would be served by diplomatic protests nor by even more<br />
extreme measures to intervene. 0 *-13 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Turning t3 clause 14 of the motion, I express myself with<br />
restraint when I say that this clause is proof of an absolutely scruffy<br />
political manouvre and, in itself, is a monstrous perversion of the<br />
truth. You havc only to read the clause to sce that that is so. T he<br />
clause states that I drew a parallel between South Africa' s treatment<br />
of the natives in South Africa and Australia' s treatmunt of the indigenous<br />
inhabitants of Australia end its torritorics. Every memiber on this side<br />
of the House knows that that is en utter invention. At no stage did I<br />
say anything of the kind.<br />
I know that there are people some of them in Australia<br />
who constantly foment the idea that this nation has-ill-treated its<br />
abcrigines. I deny this. It is a charge, not only against the Commonwealth<br />
Government, bu.. against the various State Governments. Tho facts<br />
reject it. Nor did I, in my statemont, talk about our treatment of<br />
aborigines in terms of v.. hat goes on in some other countries. What I said<br />
lot me remind everybody of it was that if the domostic jurisdiction<br />
principle is abendcned in the he. at of the moment, so to speak, we may live<br />
to see the dlay when other nations, whether in the United Nations or<br />
otherwise, will icek to discuss our aboriginal policies end claim as a<br />
precedent whatever action occurs in relation to South Africa. That is<br />
what I said. We h~ pe and believe that we will never have incidents of<br />
the kind now under discussion, but all these things are matters of degree;<br />
and a point of principle, once surrendered, is not easily recaptured.<br />
So far' as our territories are concerned we believe, in this<br />
Parliament and I think that most objective onlookers agree that our<br />
policies end administration have been enlightened and progressive. We<br />
have clean hands in respect of our territories. But it is not difficult<br />
to imagine that, with the passage of time, some people who have no interest<br />
in orderly progression towards rising living standards zr. nd sclf-government<br />
will proceed to stir up trouble in those territories, and, having stirred<br />
it up, invite the intervention of other countries, treating the domestic<br />
jurisa3iction principle as having been abandoned.<br />
The clause is, therefore, grossly dishonest in its statement<br />
and deliberately damaging in its implication. I merely add that the<br />
reference to the carriage of passports by indigenous peoples, passports<br />
governing their movements inside their country, shows the length to which<br />
the Opposition will go in order to secure what it believes to be a point.<br />
First, the fact is that in the Soviet Union such passports are required,<br />
but the Opposition in this Parliament has never, to my knowledge, ever<br />
commented upon that or proposed a resolution about it.<br />
Mr. Galvin. Do you approve of it?<br />
Of course I do not approve of it but I do not interfere in<br />
the domestic affairs of the Soviet Union if that is the way in which they<br />
went to run their country, well and good. There are a few people<br />
who ti ink that it is a very good way, but I am not one of them. Not one<br />
word has ever been said by a member of the Opposition protesting against<br />
th; a carriage of domestic passports in the Soviet Union. They cannot<br />
squirm off this hook. And yet they have the strictest rules applying<br />
over a great area of the Soviet Union, and these rules have, if anything,<br />
beep more and mcre intensified during the last four years. It is interesting<br />
to note that the penaltios for infringement of the passport rules in<br />
the 5oviet Union range from six months " corrective" labour to two years<br />
deprivation of freedom.<br />
/ Now I come to clause 5 of the motion. Clause 5 emphasises<br />
that my " gratuitous end maladroit" references to the policies of Australia<br />
i~ n regard to its native peoples may be construod in Asia and Africa in a<br />
qtanncr most damaging to this country. .* 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Now, Sir, that is just about as unpatriotic and damaging a<br />
clause to put in a motion as I have ever reaa in my life. ' What were<br />
these references by me to thc policies of Australia in regard to its<br />
native peoples? Thc Leader of the Opposition will be hard put to it to<br />
find them in mry answcrs in this House. My references<br />
to our own problem I have already said something about this wore made<br />
in the setting which I have just elaborated. These policies arc, I repeat,<br />
honourable and good, and I have yet to learn that they are the subject<br />
of criticism either in Africa or in Asia. The Opposition here, while<br />
piously expressing its fear that my references to these policies may be<br />
construed in Asia and Africa in a manner most damaging to this country,<br />
is plainly expressing its hopes that they will be. How could they<br />
possibly be construed in any other country in a damaging sense unless<br />
other countries are persuaded by people in this House that they are<br />
damaging? Sir, our policies in relation to native peoples, either<br />
inside Australia or in the territories, are aand let me emphasise<br />
this our business and our responsibility and they have been pursued,<br />
as even the Opposition would scarcely care to deny, in a clea-, r and<br />
honourable fashion. May I, having regard to the eagerness of some<br />
people to become engaged in South African politics, repeat what I have<br />
said about our policies? Our policies are our business and our<br />
responsibility, and we are not transferring them to other people. My<br />
answer, Sir, on Thursday was and I quote it<br />
If wie are tco free in asserting that what happens in South<br />
Africa is a matter of international jurisdiction, we may<br />
well step out of the light into the dark-iess en this matter.<br />
We may well find that, the door having been opened in that way,<br />
somebody will be willing to assert at some time or other, in<br />
some circumstances, that we, in relation either to our own<br />
internal population or to the population of our territories,<br />
are also sub. bect to internationalI condemnation and international<br />
jurisdiction.<br />
This is what the honourable gentleman professes to fear, but his near-deputy<br />
leader, at once interjected, when I hL-d made that remark, and said ' And so<br />
we should Mr. Reynolds. If we do wrong.<br />
0 h! if we do wrong. Mark the words that I used and I think<br />
I was quite audible. I said that somebody might be willing to assert that<br />
we are " 1also subjuct to international condemnation and international<br />
jurisdiction". And inediately I said those words a prominent member of<br />
the Labour Party said " And so we should be". Of all the pieces of<br />
humbug that I have met w... ith in a long experience of politics, this is the<br />
supreme example. One of the most pro) minent members of the Opposition has<br />
said publicly in this House that we ought to be condemned for our administration<br />
cf our policies in regard tz) native pecples, that we ought t,%<br />
be dragged before an international jurisdiction. This very same Opposition<br />
brushes that to one side and says, " How terrible that the Prime Minister<br />
should even hint that there is a subject of this kind and so should<br />
attract the hostile attention of other countries".<br />
Now, Sir, wie come to clause 6 of the motion. Clause 6 is the<br />
one that refers to the United Nations and the forthcoming Common-! ealth Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference. Australia is not a member of the Security Council.<br />
Therefore, the d% 2cision as to whether the South African question should be<br />
there debated and made the subjeot of sor.-e decision or direction, is not<br />
ours. I have stated in public, on behalf of this Government, our view on<br />
that matter; but it is not our decision. The Security Council, as I say,<br />
sat early this morning our time, and is presumably discussing the matter<br />
at this moment. I have also, Sir, stated as dispassionately as possible<br />
the principle to which we have adhered for y--. ars in relation to the internal<br />
affairs of other countries. This is not a matter that has suddenly cropped up.<br />
0 </p>
<p>This is a problem which has come up time after time, almost year after<br />
year, and we have consistently taken the view that wie are not going to<br />
intervene in the internal affairs of other countries; and so far aslI<br />
kniow, Sir, our actions on all those occasions have never been seriously<br />
challenged in this Parliament.<br />
I think that I might have been able to regard this policy<br />
of non-interference as the accepted national policy of Australia, for I<br />
had never heard it challenged until the Opposition saw, in these moving,<br />
dreadful, dramatic events in South Africa the opportunity for cashing-in<br />
on a natural emotional reaction in the minds of most of us. But, Sir,<br />
the clause goes on to propose that the events in South Africa not the<br />
policy of apartheid Which the honeurable gentleman has talked about tiis<br />
morning, but the circumstances of these incidents should be taken to<br />
the meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers. Really, can anybody<br />
suppose anything more fantastic? In the first place, the motion indicates<br />
no understanding of what a Commorr~ ealth Prime M1inisters' Conference is and<br />
how it works. Mr. Duthie. N obody else has such an understanding either.<br />
Nm, and you will be deprived of that experience forever. But,<br />
Sir, Connnoncalth Prime Ministers' Conferences do not have matters listed for<br />
discussion. They do not have an agenda. They do not have votes taken.<br />
They do not have majorities. They consist of, say, nine people sitting<br />
trngether, each of them the head of the Government cf his own country,<br />
discussing matters of common interest, informing each other' s minds, learning<br />
from each other's experience, getting to know something more about the problems<br />
of other men. These are not meetings where votes are taken. Indeed, I<br />
should like to~ tell honourable members that even the communique which<br />
emerges at the end of a Commonwealth Primel Ministers' Conference and it<br />
is always a harmless enough document, as you know. cannot contain anything<br />
to the inclusion of which even only one Prim Minister objects.<br />
Now, it is a system that has continued and which I and other<br />
people too, think is one if the most important elements in the present<br />
Commonwealth structure these regular meetings between the heads of<br />
gcvernments of the Commonwealth. Yet, the Lcader of the Opposition, who at<br />
Isayonse time had ambitions to attend a Prime Ministers' conference, seriously<br />
that this matter ought to be listed. The Opposition sa~ s:-" Put it down<br />
on the agenda. Bring along the Prime Minister of South Africa. Let him<br />
be put into the dock and let us all try to cross-examine him". How long<br />
does anybody suppose the Commonwealth would last if that was the way we<br />
went on? How long do they suppose the structure itself would endure if<br />
every time the head of a Commonwealth Go-ornmunt, or a parliament in the<br />
Commonwealth, or somebody in a Commonwalth Government or Parliament,<br />
disagreed with something going on inside another Commonwealth countr and<br />
said " I wiant that listed for the next Prime Ministers' Conference"?<br />
As a matter of fact, I would remind honourable members that<br />
in the past there have been tremendous problems in the Indian sub-continenttremendous<br />
pr-* blems of refugees and vast loss of life after partition<br />
grievous problems. One problem left unsolved, the problem of Kashmir,<br />
a problem w-hich has bedlevilled the relations between India and Pakistan<br />
for years. I proposed at one stage, in London, that wie might have some<br />
talks about it among Prime Ministers, just informally. But it was not<br />
listed. It could not have been listed because at least two or three heads<br />
of governments objected to this matter being made one for formal discussion<br />
by a Prime Ministers' C~ onference. The reason they did so was they they<br />
put on one side whatever might be their ovm views on this particular problem.<br />
They realised that Yihen a meeting of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers<br />
sets itself up as an adjudicator on disputes inside the Coummonwealth then,<br />
as I say, the end of the whole structure is in sight.<br />
It has been said I clo not know with what authority that<br />
the Prime Minister of South Africa would himself have liked an opportunity<br />
of explaining his policies to his brother-Prime Ministers in suitable<br />
e ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
circumstances. I have heard that said, I cannot vouch for it but<br />
it is primarily a matter for him. Personally I would welcome hearing<br />
something on the matter because I appear to bc in a hopeless minority<br />
as I look at the Opposition on this matter. I confess that I do not<br />
kiowv all about South Africa's domestic policies. I do not know all the<br />
implications of what has been called a-partheid and I would like to be<br />
better informed. Now my time has expired and I shall sum up by saying that<br />
this resolution is crude, it is misleading, it is dangerous. it will, 9<br />
I hope and believe, be utterly rejected in this House and by all thoughtful<br />
people with a sense of responsibility. But if, in all the circumstances<br />
which confront us and in view of the honest indignation and shook in the<br />
minds of our people, some resolution is required so that misleading commennts<br />
may not be made on the outright rejection of the one now before us, I say<br />
" tvery well, let us have a resolution". It wVill need to be of an entirely<br />
different kind. I shall move the following amendment That all the wordls<br />
after " that" be 6mitted arnd the i'ollowing wards inserted:-<br />
" This House profoundly regrets the loss of human lives<br />
occasioned in recent incidents in South Africa, is distressed that such<br />
events should have occurred in a member ccuntry of the Commohwealth of<br />
Nations, expresses its sympathy with those who have suffered, profoundly<br />
hopes that order may be re-established as soon as possible and earnestly<br />
hopes that the adjustment of all disputes and differences will be achieved<br />
by orderly and lawf'ul pr~ cesses for the cormnon * oenefi t of the people of<br />
South Africa", </p>
