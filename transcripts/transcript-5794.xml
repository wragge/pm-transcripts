FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 16 APRIL 1982<br />
GAMMON RANGES NATIONAL PARK, SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
Joint Statement by Prime Minister and<br />
Acting Premier of South Australia<br />
The Australian and South Australian National Parks<br />
and Wildlife Services are to co-operate in the<br />
development of a training prog ramme to involve<br />
local aboriginal people in the management of Gammon<br />
Ranges National Park in South Australia.<br />
The Adnjamathana people have close traditional<br />
associations with the Gammon Ranges and it-is<br />
important that they should have a close involvement<br />
in the management of the National Park.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is particularly pleased<br />
that the Australian National Park and Wildlife Service,<br />
which has special experience in aboriginal Ranger<br />
training, should be able to assist the South Australian<br />
Government in a new and important initiative involving<br />
aboriginal people in the protection of their natural<br />
and cultural heritage. 000---</p>
