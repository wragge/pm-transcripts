APPOINTMENT OF SIR MACFARLANE BURiET AS CHAIRMAN<br />

Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
A statement is being released in London tonight<br />
concerning the Commonwealth Foundation. Commonwealth Governments<br />
have appointed Sir IvMacfarlane Burnet, to be the first<br />
Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation. The<br />
statement is as follows<br />
" At their 1965 meeting, the Commonwealth Prime<br />
Ministers approved proposals for the establishment of a<br />
Commonwealth Foundation.<br />
The Foundation is to administer a fund for<br />
increasing interchanges between Commonwealth oranisations<br />
in professional fields throughout the Commonwealth.<br />
The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,<br />
Commonwealth High Commissioners in London and the<br />
Commonwealth Secretary-General held a meeting at the<br />
Commonwealth Relations Office on 9 December in order to<br />
consider aopointments and other preliminary measures<br />
necessary to the establishment of the Foundation.<br />
Commonwealth Governments have agreed that Sir<br />
Macfarlane Burnet F. S SC. D. F. R. C. P.,<br />
shall be the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees.<br />
This is an honorary appointment.<br />
It was also agreed that Mr. G. V. St. J. Chadwick,<br />
C. M. G. should be the first Director.<br />
Sir Macfarlane Burnet is one of the most<br />
distinguished of living Australians.<br />
He is a world figure in the treatment of virus<br />
diseases and a winner ( jointly with Professor Sir Peter<br />
Medawar of London) of the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1960.<br />
He retired this year from the Directorship of the<br />
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute and Prefessorship of<br />
Experimental Medicine in the University of Melbourne, pcsts<br />
which he held from 1944.<br />
He is a Fellow of the Royal Society, President of<br />
the Australian Academy of Science, a member of the Medical<br />
Research Advisory Committee of the World Health Organisation,<br />
a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and<br />
a member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences.<br />
He was knighted in 1951, and awarded the Order of<br />
Merit in 1958.<br />
Mr. G. U. St. J. Chadwick is an Assistant Under-<br />
Secretary of State at the Commonwealth Relations Office. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
He has served in London Ottawa and Paris and is at<br />
present concerned with Lfrican affairs.<br />
He has also made a special study of the professional<br />
links in the Commonwealth.<br />
He is being seconded to the Foundation for ani<br />
initial period of two years.<br />
During this period he will be a servant,' not of the<br />
British Government, but of the Foundation and the<br />
Commonwealth as a whole.<br />
A Board of Trustees is being established by<br />
Commonwealth Goverments.<br />
Details of this will be announced later.<br />
It will now be for the Chairman the Board of<br />
Trustees and the Director to consider together the<br />
detailed arrangements for the setting up of the<br />
Foundation." I am delighted about this appointment which is a great<br />
honour for Australia. The Commonwealth Foundation is one of<br />
the new initiatives in Commonwealth co-operation which has<br />
been agreed on by Commonwealth countries. There are already<br />
a number of useful interchanges between professional orgaisations<br />
in the Commonwealth and it has been demonstrated that these are<br />
an effective way of sharing knowledge and achieving ag-reement and<br />
co-operation. The Foundat--on will serve a useful and important<br />
purpose in furthering these interchanges.<br />
The Foundation will have a permanent Director in<br />
London who is to be Mr. St. J Chadwick formerly of the<br />
Commonwealth Relations Office. Sir Macfarlane as Chairman,<br />
will be required to attend meetings periodically in London.<br />
There will also be a Board of Trustees and Australia?' s representative<br />
on the Board will be the Australian High Commissioner in<br />
London, Sir Alexander Downer.<br />
On behalf of the Commonwealth Government and all<br />
Australians I wish Sir Macfarlane great success in his chairmanship<br />
of this new enterprise.<br />
CANBERRA, 14th December, 1965. </p>
