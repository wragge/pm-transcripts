UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL 9PM CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCE CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA 25 JULY 1984<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Thank you for inviting me to speak to you tonight.<br />
I do so at a time of far reaching change in the Australian<br />
financial system.<br />
Not change for its own sake. And . not unsettling change<br />
without a clear direction. But carefully managed change,<br />
directed to ensure that the financial system olays its full<br />
part in the dynamic, flexible and productive economy that we<br />
are seekina to build in Australia as we move towards the<br />
twenty first century.<br />
We are a skilled and resource-rich nation, in the geographic<br />
neighbourhood of what are now the world's most dynamic<br />
economies: the Japanese economy undergoing continued<br />
industrial transformation at the frontier of technology; an<br />
increasingly outw. ard-looking China achieving impressive,<br />
early success with its modernisation plans; and continued<br />
growth at spectacular rates in the Republic of Korea and<br />
several of the ASEAN states.<br />
Our challenge, as a nation, is to canitalise on the<br />
opportunities which our location and resource endowments<br />
provide. The Australian Labor Government is committed to<br />
seeing that Austialia and its institutions rise to that<br />
challenge. The decisive reversal in our economic fortunes since we tool:<br />
Office from declining output in the year and a half to the<br />
June quarter of 1983, to what the nation; al accounts will<br />
probably come to show as the strongest growth ever recorded<br />
in the year to the June quarter that has just ended,<br />
provides an opportunity for our nation to address long-term<br />
structural problems. </p>
<p>And you will be as aware as we are that many of the<br />
structural problems that have inhibited Australian economic<br />
growth over the last decade have been in financial mar'-ets.<br />
Australians clearly wanted a fresh start in March 1983: a<br />
fresh approach to the longer-t-erm problems increasingly<br />
facing the economy. They wanted a Government which did not<br />
bury its head in the sand when faced with difficulties, or<br />
make promises which it had little or no chance of delivering<br />
on. What was required was imagination, flexibility and<br />
creativity. As a Government we owed it to the Australian<br />
people to demonstrate these qualities.<br />
Our immediate goal to generate strong economic recovery<br />
has now been largely achieved. The Prices and Incomes<br />
Accord was a major factor in reversing the deteriorating<br />
economic performance, and returning us to the path leading<br />
to economic stability and growth.-Continued public<br />
commitment to its principles is vital.<br />
We are confident that the economic recovery will. continue,<br />
at rates of growth that are impressive by the inadequate<br />
standards of Australia in the last decade.<br />
But a short-term economic recovery is not enough. The<br />
hardships of years of recession, the burdens borne by the<br />
unemployed, and the jobs and careers destroyed for so many<br />
of our young people, these have been too great to permit usas<br />
a government and a community, to be satisfied with any<br />
mere temporary restoration of economic growth.<br />
We have achieved economic recovery with the support of the<br />
trade unions, the business community and the State<br />
governments. And we will continue to work with the whole<br />
Australian community as we consolidate the gains that have<br />
been made and implement the reforms that are necessary to<br />
lift our long-term economic growth performance.<br />
The permanent' lifting of our growth performance, to<br />
sustained rates that support full employment for an<br />
increasing population at rising living standards, requires<br />
firm management and reform in a wide range of economic,<br />
social and political areas.<br />
None is more important than the maintenance of favourable<br />
conditions in financial markets.<br />
Now that private investment is clearly lifting itself out of<br />
the trough associated with the collapse of the resources<br />
boom, all levels of Government must find ways of reducing<br />
their demands upon private savings. Otherwise a combination<br />
of high interest and exchange rates will threaten the<br />
recovery we have all striven so hard to bring about. </p>
<p>Paul Ke3ting and I obtained the State Governments'<br />
acceptance of this essential message at t*, ie June meeting of<br />
the Premiers' Conference and loan C'-uncil. The ', oan Council<br />
agreed upon a new approach to the set'uirg o" borrowing<br />
limits for statutory authorities. The aim is to achieve<br />
agreement between Heads of Gox~ ernnient on the level of total<br />
borrowings which is appropriate to current economic<br />
conditions. At the same time the Loan Council has abandoned<br />
much of its outmoded regulatory role, p~ roviding authorities<br />
with greater flexibility in arranging their financing.<br />
Aggregate global limits in 1984-85 will be about the same in<br />
nominal terms as actual raisings in 1983-84, a substantial<br />
decline in real terms and as a proportion of GDP. Further,<br />
under the global approach which we proposed and which the<br />
States have accepted on a trial basis all borrowing is out<br />
in the open. Markets need no longer fear substantial<br />
authorities' borrowings beyond thbse discussed in Loan<br />
Council. rphe forthcoming Budget will also be important. I can tell<br />
you now, from the perspective of the current deliberations<br />
of Budget cabinet, that the simultaneous achievement of a<br />
lower budget deficit, and the provision of a meaningful<br />
personal income tax cut, while providing adequately for<br />
social welfare services to the genuinely needy, is<br />
enormously difficult.<br />
Despite the strong economic growth of the last year, and our<br />
good prospects for continued growth, we simply cannot afford<br />
to address all of our policy objectives to the extent that<br />
we would wish. In this process the interests of particular<br />
sections of the community have to be w~ eighed against the<br />
overall interests of the nation. And there is no doubt that<br />
when the social welfare obligation and demands on the<br />
Government have increased, the choices are more difficult.<br />
And the essential first priority the condition that is<br />
necesary for the Government to achieve all of its long-term<br />
social and economic goals is sustaining the recovery.<br />
In sustaining the recovery the interests of all Australians<br />
require us to maintain our simultaneous attack on the twin<br />
evils of unemployment and inflation. Accordingly, our<br />
Government's economic strategy must reflect a fine balance<br />
between the fiscal stimulus that is useful to support<br />
expansion, and the restraint on that expansion which is<br />
necessary to keep inflation and interest rates on a downward<br />
path.<br />
We will find the right balance this year, just as we did<br />
last year. </p>
<p>in achieving this outcome the Government will not shirk the<br />
hard'decisions that are required by our commitment to find<br />
the right fiscal balance.<br />
While for some this will mean disappointment, it is<br />
essential for long-term national prosperity.<br />
The same longer-term view underpins the emphasis we have<br />
given to the need for a sound approach to the restructuring<br />
of Australia's industrial base. We see an effective<br />
industry policy as critical to realisation of the<br />
Government's objectives of sustained economic growth,<br />
sustained growth in employment and reduction in<br />
unemployment. The rebuilding of the Australian economy Eo provide secure<br />
full employment, and rising Australian living standards,<br />
inevitably involves structural chafnge. [ It involves the<br />
shift of resources into activities in which Australians are<br />
most productive.<br />
Inevitable as such change might be, its implications must be<br />
fully understood and accepted by all concerned. Hence the<br />
importance we have attached to widespread consultation<br />
amongst Commonw-. ealth and State Government~ s, unions, business<br />
and the wider community on the issues involved.<br />
Already we have some runs on the board. Imaginative,<br />
programs are already in place in respect of the steel, motor<br />
vehicles and computer industries, directed at strengthening<br />
the competitive position of those industries while keeping<br />
them open to the stimulus of inteynational competition and<br />
avoiding increasing costs to users of their products.<br />
And alongside these initiatives in manufacturing industry,<br />
our reforms of the financial svste:-have a crucial role.<br />
The finance industry plays a vital. role, as you would all<br />
appreciate, in facilitating the economic growvth we as a<br />
nation need. An efficient financial sector will direct<br />
resources at least cost to the most productive areas of the<br />
economy and3 thus assist in raising the wealth and living<br />
standards of all Australians.<br />
Regrettably, the Australian finance industry has been<br />
operating at less than its full potential. In part this is<br />
because of lack of competition, itself partly the result of<br />
artifical restrictions imposed by Governments. </p>
<p>The Campbell Report presented a thorough-goinq annlysis of<br />
the Issues iuvolvad. The response of the previous<br />
Gover.,.-nent was half-hc-arted. There.: were same changes to the<br />
savings hank recula'ions to enable them to compete more<br />
effectively, and the suggestion to move to competitive<br />
tenders for treasury bonds % qas-taken up. There was long<br />
vacillation about the more difficult recommendations in<br />
the areas of foreign bank entry, financial deregulation and<br />
exchange rate management.<br />
By contrast the Australian Labor Government is committed<br />
firmly to a clear course of reform of the financial system.<br />
This commitment does not arise from any blind faith in the.<br />
inevitable virtues of the free market.<br />
Rather, it stems from our recognition of Ehe practical<br />
necessity to promote restructuring and innovation in order<br />
to advance the economic and sociar well being of all<br />
Australians. To advance this task of reform, the Government commissioned<br />
in May last year a group headed by Vic Martin to examine and<br />
report on the financial system in the light of the Campbell<br />
Report and Labor's own objectives and values.<br />
Of course, as events unfolded, one major change in the<br />
system of financial regulation could not wait for the Martin<br />
Report. Late last year we were confronted with large<br />
capital inflows and rapidly increasing foreign exchange<br />
reserves in the wake of speculation on the authorities'<br />
management of the exchange rate.<br />
These large inflows had the effect of pumping tip cur<br />
domestic money supply and threatening a renewed outbreak of<br />
inflation. We were not prepared to allow our strategy for<br />
economic recovery to be jeopardised in this way.<br />
The decision to float the Australian dollar and abolish mes. t<br />
exchange controls on 9 December la. st was a clear indication<br />
that, when circumstances demand it, this Government is<br />
prepared to act quickly, decisively and effectively.<br />
The float has since proved most successful. The exchange<br />
rate is now free to settle at the levels required to clear<br />
the market. And we have a greater capacity to maintain<br />
monetary conditions appropriate to domestic needs.<br />
In this context, it is pleasing to note that monetary growth<br />
in the financial. year that has just ended fell within our<br />
monetary projection, as revised in December in recognition<br />
of higher rates of real economic growth without increased<br />
inflation. This would not have been possible without the<br />
float. </p>
<p>For the future, it is no longer possible for the financial<br />
system as a whole to approach overseas markets to obtain<br />
additional Australian cash reserves to support domestic.<br />
operations. Better control of the domestic cash base will<br />
permit better control of domestic monetary conditions.<br />
Of course, the process of deregulation and the move to the<br />
floating of the $ A has raised a number of issues which<br />
monetary policy will need to address in 1984/ 85. One of<br />
these is the need to interpret carefully movements in M3 as<br />
a monetary indicator at a time of structural change.<br />
If deregulation increases deposits with the trading banks at<br />
the expense of other financial assets, the measure of<br />
monetary growth upon which we have placed greatest emphasis,<br />
M3, will be artifically inflated. As a result, any given<br />
rate of M3 growth would represent tighter-monetary policy<br />
than would otherwise be the case.<br />
We will need to take this fully into account in formulating<br />
our 1984-85 monetary projections. We will also need to be<br />
prepared to review the target in the light of relative<br />
movements ioi financial assets as well as in the light of<br />
developments in real economic and financial conditions.<br />
The Martin group's Report was published last February. In<br />
the relatively short time since, the Government has taken<br />
several initiatives in the reform of the financial system.<br />
Martin has pointed the way. But we have not always followed<br />
Martin to the letter.<br />
Among the major initiatives since the report was released<br />
has been a reorganisation of the Commonwealth Banking<br />
Corporation to place it on a more equal footing with the<br />
private banks.<br />
The structure of the Corporation Banks has been modernised,<br />
bringing it into line with the practices of private banking<br />
groups. This will permit a more effective organisation of<br />
the Banks' resources, including its capital. In addition<br />
the Government has injected $ 15 million of capital into the<br />
bank and changed policy to enable it to retain more of its<br />
earnings. In future, the savings bank, development bank and<br />
the corporation itself will pay tax, in line with the<br />
obligations of all private banks.<br />
We have also freed up access to foreign exchange dealing,<br />
enabling many merchant banks and finance companies to enter<br />
the long-standing bank preserve in that market.<br />
The logic of the floating of the Australian dollar calls for<br />
a competitive and efficient foreign exchange market. Over<br />
new dealerships have been authorised; many of them have<br />
already begun to operate. Further applications are being<br />
considered. Banks have also been empowered to write forward<br />
contracts to cover capital transactions, a facility<br />
previously available only in the hedge market. </p>
<p>We have as well abolished all maturity and interest rate<br />
controls on bank deposits, commencing from 1 August.<br />
A network of maturity and ii. terest rate zontrols on trading<br />
and saving bank deposits had been part of the regulatory<br />
structure since the. Banking Act was passed in 1945. These<br />
restrictions on bank deposits have limited competition and<br />
restricted the range of financial services offered by banks.<br />
For example, they have prevented the payment of interest on<br />
cheque accounts. Also the short-term maturity controls have<br />
arbitrarily prevented banks from competing in the short-term<br />
money markets and go a long way to explaining the present<br />
domination of those markets by the progressive and<br />
innovative merchant banking industry. The removal of this<br />
restriction will enable the banks and their customers to<br />
benefit from closer competition with these innovators.<br />
Long-term maturity controls limit banks' incentives to<br />
provide long-term loans. This restriction has tended to<br />
discourage finance for investment projects with long lead<br />
times projects that must play a major part in the more<br />
productive, internationally-oriented economy that we are<br />
seeking to build.<br />
As another step, we have established the Australian Payments<br />
System Council to oversee developments in the payments<br />
system, starting with access of non-banks to the cheque<br />
clearance system.<br />
Access to the domestic payments system has in the past<br />
conferred a significant competitive advantage on banks,<br />
offset to some extent by regulations not imposed on non-bank<br />
intermediaries. The payments system in the past has been<br />
dominated by cheques and, more. recently, by bankcard.<br />
However, the development of payments systems in the future<br />
is likely to be dominated by exciting technical achievements<br />
enabling the transfer of funds electronically. The Martin<br />
Group argued that these development should be supervised by<br />
a body concerned to ensure fair competition in access to<br />
these facilities. This body was also intended to promote<br />
the application of uniform technical standards to take<br />
maximum advantage of the very considerable economies of<br />
scale associated with EFT technology. The Payments Council<br />
has been set up to undertake these tasks.<br />
We have also supported in the National Companies and<br />
Securities Commission a proposal to allow finance companies<br />
to issue short form prospectuses. This will allow those<br />
companies considerably more flexibility in organising<br />
approaches to the market for funds.<br />
In short, we have already done in a few short months a great<br />
deal to restructure the financial system. As a result of<br />
close consultations with all concerned, this transition to a<br />
less regulated environment has been achieved in a stable and<br />
orderly fashion. All Australians stand to gain from such<br />
carefully managed change. . t<br />
I </p>
<p>The major item of unfiniished business is the matter of<br />
granting additionl banking licences, including to foreign<br />
equity interests.<br />
While the Campbell report recommended in favour of fairly<br />
unrestricted access to the Australian banking industry, the<br />
Martin Group accepted the traditional Australian attitude in<br />
favour of local participation in any major venture.<br />
Accordingly, the formula developed by the Martin Group was<br />
to allow a limited number of new entrants to the banking<br />
industry with up to 50 per cent foreign participation in any<br />
new entrant.<br />
For several months now, Paul Keating, other members of the<br />
Government, some State Premiers, and I have actively<br />
explored the principle of foreign bank en'ry.<br />
Following a series of mergers over several years, the<br />
banking industry has become increasingly concentrated.<br />
Desirable as this development may be by certain criteria of<br />
efficiency, it has not served to maximise competition.<br />
Additionally the exclusion of foreicn banks has begun to<br />
inhibit the capacity of our banks to operate in some key<br />
overseas economies, whose Governments demand reciprocal<br />
rights of access to the Australian market.<br />
This has limited the capacity of our banks to provide full<br />
banking services to Australian industry, including in<br />
respect of finance for exports.<br />
It was for these reasons that we were able to persuade our<br />
36th National Labor Party Conference held earlier this month<br />
to change our Party's policy platform to permit the entry of<br />
a limited number of foreign participants in banking.<br />
Following the Conference, the Government will be moving<br />
quickly to promote the establishment of new banks in<br />
Australia. Foreign entry will be subject to a number of<br />
conditions, including that every effort is made to ensure<br />
per cent local participation in any new banking venture and<br />
that new banks do not concentrate their efforts in the<br />
low-employment areas of wholesale banking. We will also<br />
insist on a history of very sound prudential management of<br />
depositors' funds.<br />
But, most importantly, we will be looking to new banks with<br />
foreign equity to provide a competitive edge and a range of<br />
improved services to bank customers.<br />
Foreign banks with a history of providing finance to promote<br />
new ventures, emerging industries, restructuring initiatives<br />
and other new opportunities for growth and development will<br />
be particularly well regarded.<br />
S" </p>
<p>Our attitude to new wholly domestically-owned banks remains<br />
unchanged although we will be consiJerir. g the Martin<br />
recommendation to increase maxi. mum shareholdings from 10 per<br />
cent to 15 per cent. Expressions of interest from suitably<br />
qualified domestic entities will, naturally, be welcome.<br />
But one of the main reasons identified by the Martin Group<br />
for permitting foreign participation in new banking ventures<br />
was the limited number of suitably qualified domestic<br />
partners, and we need to be realistic about further<br />
expansion. Through our reforms, we aim to tap the verve and<br />
competitiveness of the non-bank sector and to channel those<br />
energies also into providing heightened competition in the<br />
banking area.<br />
Some financial activities could well be inconsistent with<br />
the broader, pivotal role which banks play in the financial<br />
system. In a world of specialisation, even in the provision<br />
of financial services, there will always be a need for<br />
entities other than banks.<br />
We do not intend to favour banks at the expense of other<br />
financial institutions. We want an efficient financial<br />
sector overall: one which is responsive to the economic and<br />
social needs of Australia; and one which is based on fair<br />
competition amongst a number of efficient and effective<br />
participants. Our achievements in this crucial financial sector of the<br />
Australian economy are, I believe, by any measure<br />
impressive. I sometimes hear the observation in praise<br />
from some of your quarters, in. anguish from some of mine,<br />
that this is the best Liberal Government in memory. The<br />
observation is quaint but of itself unrevealing.<br />
Our changes do not derive from some profound political<br />
philosophy. They are based squarely upon, first, clear,<br />
level-headed perceptions of what is necessary to create the<br />
conditions appropriate for optimum growth and, second, a<br />
commitment to take the action required to give effect to<br />
those conditions.<br />
Our predecessors may have had the perceptions; they<br />
certainly lacked the commitment. We have demonstrated that<br />
we have both and it will be to the enduring benefit of the<br />
whole Australian community.<br />
There are many other important issues raised by the Martin<br />
Group to which the Government will respond in coming months. </p>
