    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit Indonesia from 25 to 27 June for meetings with President Yudhoyono.  The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is an important one for both countries, encompassing political, security, commercial, cultural and people-to-people links.  Indonesia is a significant and important partner in addressing the security threats of our region, including terrorism and people smuggling.</p>
<p>   I am also pleased to announce that I will be visiting Shenzhen, China, from 27 to 29 June to attend a ceremony with Chinese Premier Wen to mark the arrival of the first commercial shipment of LNG from Australia's North West Shelf.  In 2003, Australia concluded its single largest export deal worth $25 billion for long-term supply of LNG to China.  This is an important milestone in our bilateral relationship and a further demonstration of our natural economic complementarities.</p>
<p> While in Shenzhen I will also hold a meeting with Premier Wen and speak at a conference on the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement.  A successful outcome to FTA negotiations will help to build the long-term economic partnership between Australia and China. </p>
