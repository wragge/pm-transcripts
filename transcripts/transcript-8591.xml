TRANSCRIPT OF OPENING REMARKS BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON P J KEATING, MP TO THE NATIONAL MEETING ON YOUTH<br />
TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
22 JULY 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well thank you very much, I think we might call the<br />
meeting to order. Could I begin by saying that I have<br />
already had the pleasure of meeting most of you this<br />
morning, as have my colleagues, but could I say formally<br />
on their behalf and mine welcome to this meeting. It is<br />
very gratifying to see you here and it is a reflection<br />
of, I think, the concern that Australia feels at the<br />
moment for unemployment, the problems which come with it<br />
and particularly as the problem attends our young people.<br />
We all know, I think, that unemployment in the kind of<br />
society we have is not the shock absorber in the economic<br />
system. We don't regard it as a buffer at the end of the<br />
station, we don't believe that a group in a society<br />
should carry the adjustment burden of any economy, in a<br />
transition no matter how important or fundamental, that<br />
that kind of policy approach is unacceptable, and that<br />
the fairness and sense of equality and egalitarianism of<br />
Australia as always deigned that everyone should have a<br />
right to a job regardless of age. And it has been on<br />
that basis that we have as a country operated.<br />
Structural unemployment is of course not a new phenomena<br />
for us or many other countries, but in the last ten or<br />
fifteen years of quite rapid world change, change in<br />
trade, and change in the structure of economies we have<br />
seen this appear. And it is difficult to deal with it,<br />
and we now have compounding that problem unemployment<br />
coming from the cycle of the recession. We are now<br />
emerging into recovery, but thie unemployment is still<br />
with us. It is a social evil and we have got to do what<br />
4e can to beat it, and as a Government, may I say, for<br />
the years 1983, certainly up to 1990, we took the view<br />
that unemployment had to be dealt with and that<br />
employment should be an express outcome of policy, that<br />
employment should not be simply a residual which falls<br />
out the bottom of the growth numbers, but was an express<br />
objective of policy. And that's why I think we have<br />
progressed so far. That is, in the .' 80s we were able to </p>
<p>grow our labour market at about three times the pace of<br />
most comparable countries, and why today the labour<br />
market is still 25 per cent larger than it was in 1983.<br />
But the fact is that growth stopped, unemployment has<br />
risen, and we have now got to do all in our power to get<br />
it down. Yesterday in respect of the fortunes of young<br />
people and youth unemployment, we took I think a great<br />
leap forward in what I think one can conscientiously<br />
describe as an historic change. We arrived at an<br />
agreement, the Commonwealths with the States, to<br />
establish a National Training Authority, that is to make<br />
another path-waayi n e-: idu6fii5ii-eh-Ybid-thit which we have<br />
now through the tertiary system and through compulsory<br />
education. Arnd as all of you who are interested in this<br />
subject know, almost half of the kids who live school are<br />
untrained. And part of the reason for that is that we<br />
have never really had the structures in place to train<br />
them. So, at least from the Governments' perspective,<br />
Governments plural, we put our heads together and I think<br />
came up with a cooperative model which will allow the<br />
Commonwealth and the States to work together for the<br />
benefit of Australian young people, and those mature age<br />
students who will also find themselves in vocational<br />
education. But I think today, that was yesterday, but<br />
today I think we can do more. But we have to advance on<br />
three fronts. Obviously growth is key to whatever we<br />
might do and the economy is now growing again and we<br />
shouldn't be too forlorn about its prospects, there's<br />
every chance that in the year to June the economy will<br />
grow by about 2 per cent. This compares with growth over<br />
the same period in Europe of about 1.7. So we're doing<br />
as well or better than comparable countries. We're not<br />
growing as fast as parts of Asia but we are growing<br />
certainly as fast or faster than Europe or North America.<br />
In the coming year we expect to be growing much faster,<br />
of the order of 4 per cent. And it is, as we all know,<br />
GDP, growth, which pulls up employment. And when one<br />
sees any graphic illustration of employment and growth,<br />
they go together, one line with the other, whenever we<br />
see a lift in GDP, in growth in output, we see a lift in<br />
employment. The problem for us now is we're living with<br />
the lag, the lag which comes from higher productivity,<br />
more output being produced by fewer people, in the first<br />
instance, to see employment pick up later. So growth is<br />
the key, and no matter what we do here today, no matter<br />
how clever we think some of our solutions may be, if the<br />
growth isn't there of course it will retard our progress.<br />
The second front, I think, is education and training.<br />
And that goes right across thie -gammi-t oif the -' Estiem, ffr om<br />
school, primary to secondary education, retention in<br />
secondary education and as we've been prone to say<br />
lately, we've taken that participation rate from 3 in<br />
in 1983 to now 7 in 10 and we want to see that get to<br />
9 in 10 before too much longer, and we've now very<br />
rapidly and dramatically expanded higher education with a<br />
per cent addition of tertiary places since the middle<br />
1980s. </p>
<p>3<br />
The key now is to get that school to work transition into<br />
place and to look at struciured training which can only<br />
really come with the notion that the later teenage years<br />
are years of vocational preparation, and where it's now<br />
up to us to see that there are pathways between school<br />
and work and that it's no longer acceptable for those of<br />
us who are involved in society to take the view that half<br />
of the school leavers can just meander their way through<br />
a labour market untrained to find that opportunities are<br />
denied them. So education and training, I think, is the<br />
second front.<br />
And the third front is to help the unemployed now. That<br />
is, particularly those young people whose later teenage<br />
years will precede the more fundamental transitions from<br />
school to work, the more structured training arrangements<br />
which are portended in the Carmichael Report and in other<br />
places those people who are disadvantaged now, that's the<br />
other front we have to work on to deal with the<br />
unemployed now.<br />
So we've invited you here today, each of you, because we<br />
know you've already done things, and are doing things,<br />
about these problems, about unemployment generally. And<br />
particularly about unemployment for young people and<br />
we're particularly gratified that we've had many young<br />
people themselves participate in the process and give us<br />
the benefit of their views which we will also see again<br />
today, with further expression by them of their opinions.<br />
For the Government's part, we will listen attentatively<br />
to what's said. The process of national meetings on<br />
points of difficulty in society, has been I think a good<br />
one over the last decade or so, and it does give<br />
governments a chance to listen to what the community has<br />
to say and fashion policy accordingly. So we will<br />
listen, we'll take note, we've got a reasonable structure<br />
in our own ideas already, as would be obvious, but we<br />
want to try and assimilate some of the views which are<br />
put today with those ideas and to produce a structure of<br />
value. So the Government will not be responding today, because<br />
to do so would be to not take the views of people<br />
seriously because obviously they can't be considered at<br />
the same time as they're being put. But we will respond<br />
next week, after we digest what has been put today and<br />
when we have the time, the thinking time and the time to<br />
structure a response, a sensible response and to<br />
structure a response sensibly.<br />
So could I just say, I conclude on those remarks again by<br />
saying it's very gratifying to see you here.<br />
Thank you very much for coming. We'll be having an open<br />
session this morning of about, I think, five speeches<br />
including my own, two from two young people representing </p>
<p>4<br />
the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition<br />
Delegation, one from the ACTU, from Bill Kelty and<br />
another from Eric Mayer the chair of the Business in the<br />
Community for Young People and following those speeches<br />
we will then move into closed session, where we can have<br />
a general discussion, and I think, take other<br />
presentations. So with those few words I think we'll move the agenda on<br />
and I might ask now Miss Belinda Cant to address the<br />
meeting. ENDS </p>
