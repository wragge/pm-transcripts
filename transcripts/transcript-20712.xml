    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, I am very much looking forward to my visit to New Zealand. It particularly will mark the 20th anniversary of CER, which has been a remarkably successful expression of the close relations between Australia and New Zealand. In the time I've been Prime Minister I've visited New Zealand regularly and the New Zealand Prime Minister of the time has, of course, reciprocated by her visits to Australia. I enjoy a very close, professional relationship with Helen Clark. We've always managed to deal in a very direct and positive fashion with issues that arise between our two countries. The relationship, which is of historic closeness, is in excellent shape and I hope that my visit will further reinforce the close relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p>I know you may want to ask me some questions about another matter. Can I say that I followed events in New York overnight very closely. And if you look at Dr Blix's report you find him asking the rhetorical question on page five - has Iraq complied actively and unconditionally and genuinely with the requirements of resolution 1441. And the answer both in Dr Blix's report and elsewhere must be that Iraq has not so complied. I believe it is important that the issue be brought to a vote at the Security Council. The matter has now been debated for a very long time. Whilst I'm not wedded to any particular wording the idea contained in the amendment circulated by the British and the Spanish to the effect that a deadline should be set by which time the Security Council may or may not make a determination that Iraq has complied actively and unconditionally with the terms of 1441, that is a good idea. Because, in a sense, Iraq has been playing the world off a break now for more than 12 years and the way in which you prevent that going on indefinitely is to oblige the Security Council to address the issue and answer its own rhetorical question - has Iraq complied actively and unconditionally with the terms of 1441.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you believe a deadline of next week is reasonable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've always said, Joe, that the problem here is not so much time but attitude. The advantage of setting a time, whether it's the 17th or the 24th or the 20th, whatever it is, obviously doesn't...it shouldn't be a long way into the future. The purpose of that is to, I believe, and the value of that is to get the members of the Security Council to focus their minds on this issue. Dr Blix will not make the decision for the Security Council members and neither he should. The members of the Security Council have got to make their decision. They can't rely on Dr Blix. That's not his job. His job is to report facts. He's reported non-compliance, now the Security Council has got to decide what it does.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister, he's reported increased cooperation as well and any deadline will be expressed in hours rather than the months that he has asked for, why shouldn't the Security Council give him the patience that he's asking for?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he's also saying that Iraq has not complied with the terms of 1441. Dr Blix is quite obviously saying to the world, don't expect me to solve your problem for you. And the only way this issue can be dealt with in a decisive fashion and a fashion that doesn't allow Iraq to do what she's done in the last 12 years is for the members of the Security Council to accept their responsibilities and take a decision.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, will you take Australia into war on Iraq if it does not have United Nations Security Council approval?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Frank, that issue is one that I will deal with if and when it arises. I've said all along that we should make every attempt to secure what will be the 18th resolution of the Security Council. When we know the outcome of the Security Council debate, when we know the outcome of the vote, which I believe should take place, then and only then will that issue be addressed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You mean you haven't even discussed it yet. I mean, surely you must be prepared for this. It's very obvious it's not going to be approved.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When that issue is resolved in the Security Council the Government will address the substance of your question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, will you rule out that possibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I am not ruling anything out. I'm not ruling anything out. I'm telling you what the facts are and they are, when the issue has been dealt with by the Security Council we will then decide what action, in the light of that Security Council discussion, we will then decide what action might be taken by Australia. But for me to rule anything in, I'm not ruling anything in, or out at the present time, is patently absurd and robs this country of the flexibility it ought to have to take decisions when all the known facts are available to the Government of the day. Thank you.</p>
