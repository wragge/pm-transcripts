PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF' RE PRE SENT AIVE S<br />
CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCE FROM MR COMMISSIONER COSTIGAN<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
I seek leave to make a Statement relating to the documents.<br />
Last week the Leader of the Opposition asked a number of<br />
questions about the concern expressed by Mr Costigan<br />
regarding the progress of the transition from the Royal<br />
Commission to the National Crime Authority on 6 September.<br />
I informed the House of the position in the following terms:<br />
' It is the wish of the Government to see an<br />
effective transition from the proceedings and<br />
processes of the Costigan Royal Commission to the<br />
National Crime Authority. It is clear that Mr<br />
Costigan and the National Crime Authority have a<br />
different view on the adequacy of the transition<br />
arrangements. While Mr Costigan appears to believe<br />
that there will be problems with the transition,<br />
the National Crime Authority has advised that its<br />
members ' disagree' unanimously with Mr Costigan's<br />
assessment of the situation. Clearly this is a<br />
matter between Mr Costigan and the National Crime<br />
Authority. I am pleased to say that to assist the<br />
House I will table later this day the full<br />
correspondence from Mr Costiqan and the National<br />
Crime Authority on this matter. ( House of<br />
Representatives Hansard 6 September 1984 p.<br />
706).<br />
That is exactly what I did last Thursday. Indeed a broad<br />
view was taken of what documents were relevant to the<br />
exchange of views on the progress of the transition. The<br />
correspondence tabled last Thursday went back to the letter<br />
I sent Mr Costigan on 21 June 1984, upon the passage of the<br />
National Crime Authority Act. This letter confirmed the<br />
arrangements for the transition agreed between the Special<br />
Minister of State and Mr Costigan at their meeting in March<br />
of this year.<br />
On 1 September the Leader of the Opposition read out a list<br />
giving the dates of other correspondence between Mr Costigan<br />
and me. As he indicated, these letters were not included<br />
among those tabled on Thursday. A cursory inspection of the<br />
dates involved would have shown that they all dated back to<br />
at least March, and in a number of cases to 1983.<br />
These letters cover a period well before the transition<br />
commenced, and well before the National Crime Authority had<br />
come into existence. Indeed, the date of the first letter<br />
mentioned by Mr Peacock showed it was written four days<br />
after this Government was sworn into Office. </p>
<p>I at no stage indicated that I was purportinq to table<br />
related correspondence with Mr Costigan extending back to<br />
the commencement of my Government. Nor was this sought by<br />
the Opposition prior to the tabling. But, to make it<br />
crystal clear that this Government has nothing to hide in<br />
this matter, that is what I have just done.<br />
I am sure Honourable Members will be interested to examine<br />
the correspondence which was of such interest to the Leader<br />
of the Opposition last Friday. Let me outline some of its<br />
contents to Honourable Members.<br />
Mr Costigan first wrote to me about his activities on<br />
March 1983, a mere four days after this Government had<br />
formally assumed Office. In that letter Mr Costigan<br />
referred to the investigations which had taken place under<br />
the previous Government. He referred to the methods by<br />
which organised crime had ' raped the Australian community'.<br />
The Commissioner stated:<br />
' Quite frankly, I am appalled at what I have found'.<br />
He referred me to a number of letters he had written to my<br />
predecessor. He reminded me that his previous report had recommended that<br />
a permanent body was needed to maintain the impetus and<br />
trend of his investigations. He expressed concern that the<br />
proposed National Crimes Commission Act had been<br />
' emasculated' by the ' Spender' amendment. Mr Costigan sent<br />
me a further letter 10 days later, following his meeting<br />
with the Attorney-General, raising similar concerns.<br />
I met with Mr Costigan on 30 March 1983, to discuss those<br />
matters and indicated subsequently, in a letter of 11 April,<br />
that the Government had decided to consider the matter at<br />
further length before making any final decisions on the<br />
future of the Crimes Commission.<br />
The Government, as part of its consideration of the issues,<br />
subsequently conducted a National Crimes Seminar in the<br />
Senate Chamber to discuss the kind of body which might be<br />
established. There followed an extensive period of consultation with Mr<br />
Costigan. As the correspondence I have tabled demonstrates,<br />
the Government made every effort to respond to and to<br />
accommodate the requests made by Mr Costigan. Indeed, on 26<br />
October 1983, I indicated that the Government would extend<br />
the Commission then due to terminate at the end of the<br />
year for a further four months. This offer was made<br />
without any written requests from Mr Costigan for an<br />
extension. </p>
<p>I wish to outline the nature of subsequent exchanges in some<br />
detail. Mr Costigan, in reply to my proposal of 26 October<br />
1983, criticised the powers that were proposed for the new<br />
Crime Authority, and indicated his view that no date for the<br />
termination of the Commission should be set until the<br />
legislation was passed. He stated that he found it<br />
difficult to believe that I would wish to have the fight<br />
against organised crime abandoned, but said that if that was<br />
the decision of Government so be it.<br />
Such was my concern over these remarks from Mr Costigan that<br />
I immediately instructed officials to meet with Mr Costigan<br />
as soon as possible to discuss his concerns with him, and<br />
proposed that Ministerial discussions also be held if<br />
necessary. A few days later Senator Evans also met with Mr<br />
Costigan.<br />
Mr Costigan wrote to me on 24 November expressing ' a degree<br />
of optimism' that the handover to the Authority would work.<br />
In the same letter he sought a twelve months extension of<br />
his Royal Commission. I replied by proposing a six months<br />
extension, with a report to be provided in April, but<br />
anticipating a further extension if this was necessary to<br />
ensure that the transition to the National Crime Authority<br />
proceeded smoothly. Mr Costigan replied in February 1984,<br />
saying that he was unable to provide a report by April.<br />
Following further representations from Mr Costigan and<br />
discussion between him and the Special Minister of State, it<br />
was agreed to extend his Commission to 30 September 1984.<br />
Mr Costigan expressed his satisfaction with these<br />
arrangements and the press statement issued at the<br />
conclusion of the meeting was agreed by both parties.<br />
I have gone through these exchanges with Mr Costigan in some<br />
detail to show that the Government made every effort to meet<br />
Mr Costigan's concern about the duration of his Commission<br />
consistent with its overall belief that the Royal Commission<br />
model does not provide a suitable long-term body for<br />
fighting organised crime.<br />
The Government has remained committed to the establishment<br />
of a National Crime Authority able to take over, on a<br />
continuing basis, those of the Costigan Royal Commission's<br />
investigations which bear upon organised crime more<br />
generally than just in connection with the Painters and<br />
Dockers Union.<br />
Through the period of this Government, it has taken Mr<br />
Costigan's comments very seriously. It has sought to be<br />
helpful and to offer support to him. Indeed in his<br />
correspondence, Mr Costigan acknowledged the support I and<br />
other Ministers have given him. </p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge again the Government's<br />
appreciation of the valuable work which Mr Costigan and his<br />
Commission have performed. It is now of vital importance<br />
that the task of fighting organised crime in this country be<br />
carried forward by the Crime Authority.<br />
It is obvious from the correspondence that the Government<br />
and Mr Costigan had differing views about the timetable<br />
which should apply to the winding up of the Royal<br />
Commission. But I warn the Opposition that it would be<br />
unwise to seek to make any capital out of that lest their<br />
hypocrisy be exposed again.<br />
I refer the House to page 4 of Mr Costigan's letter to me of<br />
2 November 1983.<br />
' I have repeatedly requested over the past 18<br />
months some finality on the future of the<br />
Commission, and have asked for it in adequate time<br />
to allow me to do my job properly. Neither<br />
Government has ever attended to that task with<br />
sufficient appreciation of the lead time required<br />
and this is no exception.'<br />
Mr Speaker, this Government is confident that its record of<br />
combatting organised crime will withstand any scrutiny. The<br />
documents tabled today demonstrate that we have given Mr<br />
Costigan total encouragement and support.<br />
My letter of 26 October 1983 to Mr Costigan stated that ' I<br />
personally and the Government collectively support strongly<br />
the work of your Commission and the way in which you have<br />
been conducting your Commission.'<br />
Mr Costigan referred to this interest and support in his<br />
letter of 2 November 1983:<br />
' When I saw you in April this year you indicated<br />
your wish, with which I concurred, that the<br />
Commission should concentrate on painter and docker<br />
activity, with particular reference to drugs. That<br />
is the course I have followed.'<br />
These sentiments give the lie to the Opposition's contention<br />
that we have sought to thwart Mr Costigan's activities, and<br />
have attempted to frustrate the fight against organised<br />
crime. </p>
<p>Again, let us look at Mr Costigan's own words. In his<br />
letter to me of 5 March this year, Mr Costigan wrote:<br />
' I am anxious both that the new Crime Authority<br />
commence operation as soon as possible and that I<br />
hand over to it in an efficient manner the<br />
investigations I am now conducting. Your<br />
Government's determination to establish the body is<br />
welcome to me and in the public interest. My<br />
concern is that there may be a lack of continuity<br />
in the investigations.'<br />
In a letter of 27 February 1984, I had already assured the<br />
Commissioner that, in the context of the transition, the<br />
Government would ' co-operate fully in ensuring the<br />
continuation of those inquiries.'<br />
Mr Speaker, let us compare that concern with the cavalier<br />
attitude of our predecessors. How did they demonstrate<br />
concern for continuity of investigation? How did they seek<br />
to avoid any thwarting of Mr Costigan's inquiries?<br />
Let me quote from Mr Costigan's letter of 24 November 1983:<br />
' the uncertainty surrounding the life of the<br />
Commission has made forward planning very<br />
difficult; by way of example last year my term,<br />
which was due to expire on 31 December, was not<br />
extended until 25 December. Such uncertainty is<br />
very disruptive to the work of the Commission and<br />
harmful to the morale of staff.'<br />
Mr Speaker, that cavalier approach compares starkly with our<br />
constant encouragement and support of Mr Costigan and our<br />
continuing consultation with him.<br />
Mr Speaker, last Thursday I met with the Chairman, Mr<br />
Justice Stewart, and the other members of the National Crime<br />
Authority. We discussed matters relating to the transition,<br />
the winding up of the Costigan Commission and the<br />
considerable amount of work which the members of the<br />
Authority have already carried out as they commence their<br />
task of fighting organised crime.<br />
I asked Mr Justice Stewart, one of this country's most<br />
experienced and knowledgeable fighters of organised crime,<br />
whether there was anything further the Government could do<br />
to assist the National Crime Authority carry out its<br />
responsibilities. He replied that there was not.<br />
I asked him whether he was confident that the National Crime<br />
Authority would be an effective body in fighting organised<br />
crime. He replied that he was. </p>
<p>6.<br />
I suggest that if the Opposition is really interested in the<br />
fight against organised crime it should cease its futile and<br />
deceitful attempt to score political points over this issue.<br />
The Opposition should get behind Mr Justice Stewart, the<br />
Hon. Max Bingham, QC, a former Liberal Attorney-General of<br />
Tasmania, and Mr John Dwyer, QC the latter two members<br />
chosen on the unanimous agreement of the eight participating<br />
governments and support them and the Authority as a whole<br />
in the challenging and important work of fighting organised<br />
crime. </p>
