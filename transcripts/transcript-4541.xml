ELECTORATE TALK<br />
As a result of its achievement in beating inflation, the<br />
Government last week took another step towards restoring<br />
economic activity and raising employment.<br />
On Friday, the interest rate for Australian Savings Bonds was<br />
cut by a half per cent to 9.25 per cent.<br />
During September and October there was a reduction in yields in<br />
Commonwealth Bonds ranging up to more than a half per cent.<br />
It has now affected long and short term bonds and Savings Bonds.<br />
All these cuts add up to the first consistent downward movement<br />
in the whole structure of Government interest rates for more<br />
than four years.<br />
I now look forward to the day when overdraft rates and building<br />
society rates start to come down.<br />
The reduction in official interest rates is of course no great<br />
surprise to the finance community.<br />
Businessmen have seen inflation brought down from a peak of 17<br />
per cent in the years of the ALP government to 9 per cent now-,.<br />
They are looking forward to a further reduction in inflation to<br />
around 6 per cent or 8 per cent during the coming twelve months.<br />
Knowing this, the business community has been expecting interest<br />
rates to begin their corresponding downward movement. The cuts<br />
which have taken place so far are in line with these expectations.<br />
Some company debenture rates have in fact moved downwards in<br />
advance of the declines in Government Bond rates.<br />
Businessmen can look forward with confidence to continuing steady,<br />
gradual and sustainable redccions in official interest rates,<br />
followed in due course by a general movement downward in rates<br />
charged by banks, building societies and finance companies. I<br />
do not believe that can be far off.<br />
Two years ago, the Australian people rejected the inflationary<br />
extravagance and waste of the Whitlam administration and accepted<br />
the Liberal programme of restraint in Government expenditure, tax<br />
reform, and social justice for the disadvantaged. / The </p>

The Government fought hard to keep its pledge of responsible<br />
economic management. The Budget deficit was brought down by<br />
per cent, despite tax cuts on an unprecedented scale.<br />
The growth in the money supply which was more than 20 per cent<br />
a year under Labor's inflation is now under 10 per cent per annum.<br />
These policies led to the breakthrough on the inflation front in<br />
September when the quarterly rate of inflation was brought down<br />
to 2 per cent. This was the lowest quarterly increase in five<br />
years with the exception of the September quarter 1975 which was<br />
artificially low due to the Medibank adjustment.<br />
It is this which has made the further cut in interest rates<br />
possible. It means that 1978 promises to be the best year for<br />
many years.<br />
The Government's Budget last August contained a strategy which was<br />
designed to keep a firm control on inflationary forces during the<br />
closing months of 1977 in order to lay the grounds for the stimulating<br />
effect of the tax cuts from which everyone will benefit when<br />
the new scales come into force in February.<br />
As the Treasurer said in August, and I quote: " The Budget will add<br />
a stimulus to activity through the large increase in disposable<br />
income flowing from tax reductions...<br />
It is a matter of regret that the various Federal Labor Party<br />
economic spokesmen h-avc * set out to attack the Government's<br />
achievements in fighting inflation, lowering taxation, and<br />
reducing interest rates.<br />
Mr. Hayden, Mr. Hurford, and the Party's Deputy Leader, Mr. Uren.<br />
have all attacked this reduction in interest rates over the<br />
weekend. Mr. Uren led the condemnation of the reduction in interest<br />
rates. He was supported by Mr. Hayden who called for expansionary<br />
measures, and by Mr. Hurford who also attacked the Government's<br />
responsible monetary policies.<br />
Their attitude is in sharp contrast with that of the State<br />
Premiers, both Labor and Liberal.<br />
Last week, the New South Wales Premier, Mr. Wran, telexed the<br />
Government calling for a further reduction in interest rates.<br />
That telegram came at a time when the continuous close review<br />
which the Government maintains over the monetary situation was<br />
pointing tothe need for a further downward movement in rates.<br />
The Government was glad to be able to respond so promptly. The<br />
Government appreciates Mr. Wran's statement that this is welcome<br />
news for the building and construction industry, and an action<br />
which will obviously benefit the national economy.<br />
The Deputy Premier of South Australia, Mr. Corcoran, has also<br />
said the announcement is welcome. / The West Australian </p>
<p>3<br />
The West Australian Premier, Sir Charles Court, and the<br />
Victorian Premier, Mr. Hamer, have also welcomed the news<br />
as vindicating arguments put by all Premiers for a significant<br />
reduction in interest rates.<br />
This responsible attitude is in marked contrast to the wild<br />
statements from the Federal Labor Party's spokesmen, Mr. Uren,<br />
Mr. Hurford and Mr. Hayden. Once again, the ALP has demonstrated<br />
its incompetence and irresponsibility in economic matters.<br />
The ALP is a party of high deficits, high taxes, high interest<br />
rates and high inflation.<br />
We should be grateful to Mr. Hayden, Mr. Hurford and Mr. Uren<br />
for once more reminding us of this. The plain fact which the<br />
Labor Party cannot accept is that the Government's policies<br />
are working. </p>
