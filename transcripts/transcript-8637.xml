STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P 3 VEATING, MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN NOMINATION FOR DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE UNITED<br />
NATIONS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORCANISATION<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Government endorses<br />
Dr Geoff Miller_ as Australia's official candidate for the<br />
posfiion of D6i-rector -General of the United Nations Food and<br />
Agriculture Organisation ( FAO).<br />
Australia was instrumental in the establishment of FAO in<br />
1945, and has been active in its work ever since. The world<br />
faces daunting food and agricultural problems including<br />
escalating hunger and malnutrition, serious depletion of<br />
natural resources and disrupted world markets. Given<br />
Australia's role as a major exporter of farm products, we<br />
are very conscious of these issues.<br />
Geoff Miller has had a distinguished career in agricultural<br />
economics, spending 14 years as head or associate head of<br />
leading Australian Government agencies, including the ( then)<br />
Bureau of Agricultural Economics; the national Economic<br />
Planning Advisory Council; the Department of Foreign Affairs<br />
and Trade; and the Department of Primary industries and<br />
Energy. In each of his assignments he has demonstrated his<br />
impressive analytical skills and administrative ability.<br />
Geoff Miller has played a leading role in rural and economic<br />
policy for almost two decades. He has a very strong global<br />
orientation, having led numerous Australian delegations to<br />
world food, agricultural and trade meetings and<br />
negotiations. These included the FAO, the OECD and the<br />
GATT. Geoff Miller is a product of rural Australia with a sound<br />
practical background in agriculture. He also has strong<br />
academic credentials. </p>
<p>2<br />
Australia attaches great importance to the work of the FAO,<br />
and to the advancement of international co-operation through<br />
the UN system. I believe Geoff Miller would make an<br />
excellent Director-General.<br />
Since the election will not be held until November 1993,<br />
Dr Miller will retain his present position in Canberra as<br />
Secretary of the Department of Primary Industries and<br />
Energy. CANBERRA 27 August 1992<br />
