TRANSCRI PT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, ORI ENTAL HOTEL, BANGKOK<br />
4 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: How long do you think it will be before the<br />
uncertainty is cleared up, or is there no i'incertainty?<br />
* PM: Mr Dowding is not claiming victory ton~ ght although he<br />
is optim~ istic that the Government has been returned. He<br />
thinks it could be a day or so before all the details are<br />
finailised as to what the order of the outcome would be but<br />
he, as I say, is not claiming vIictory but thinks-the<br />
Government has been returned.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you draw fromi a cliff-hanger?<br />
PM: Sat isfaction, if that is the outcome, because you have a<br />
situation where you've had such a tremendous concentrated<br />
bitter campaign against the Labor Party in Western Australia.<br />
It was said that WA Inc was going to eipe them out, there was<br />
all the story about interest rates and mortgages, home costs.<br />
I think You have a situation where. as I said when I was in<br />
the campaign over there, that I believe that in the end<br />
politicians and commentators tend to underestimate the<br />
intelligence of the electorate. In the end the majority of<br />
. Aurstrealicans oarer coEncedrne, d, as between two parties, on the<br />
which one is most likely to address the issues which<br />
in a day to day sense affect their well-being. That seems to<br />
be the outcome in West Australia. I might say . too that from<br />
what I'm told at least one seat, perhaps more, has been lost<br />
to Labor because of the change in the voting system. They<br />
brought in the method whereby for the Upper House a tick<br />
against the Labor Party box would ensure that your vote was<br />
valid, and apparently thousands have thought that you could<br />
do the same thing for the Lower House. So it looks as though<br />
Barry Hodge for instance in Melville lost his seat there<br />
by it's thought perhaps 11 votes or something ILike -that. A<br />
couple of thousand votes have been clearly indicated as being<br />
intended for him. So when you take that into account too it<br />
seems to me to be a pretty good outcome. Let me say this,<br />
I'm glad to have been there in the campaign associated with<br />
Labor. We were wanted as distinct from the ban that was put<br />
upon my federal colleagues.<br />
JOURNALIST: There've been big swings against Labor in the<br />
mortgage belt areas, theie'ye been two seats lost. Are you<br />
concerned about that and do Yiou think that there could be a<br />
need to reconsider the economic settings? </p>
<p>PM4: No, we're niot going to change economic settings because<br />
we look as though we've won an election in Western Australia<br />
it wouldn't be very good economic management. No, we'll go<br />
about the process of controlling the economy as we think it's<br />
necessary. Yes, it looks as though there's been some loss of<br />
support in some of those mortgage belt areas but it's not<br />
entirely surprising.<br />
JOURN4ALIST: What do you believe are the federal<br />
implications? PM: I think for Labor we're entitled to be satisfied but niot<br />
complacent. I'm certainly never complacent in politics. But<br />
. I bthienk a lot of people were expecting that this was going to<br />
the one where another Labor government fell. Certainly my<br />
opponent Mr Howard was saying without any doubt that's what<br />
was goinq to happen, although they certainly didn't want him<br />
over there as being any part of the process. But he was<br />
trumpeting another victory for the anti-Labor forces well,<br />
he's wrong again. What his own people think about that in<br />
the federal sphere is a matter of interest I guess.<br />
JOURNALIST: How important is this outcome in terms of Labor<br />
Party morale generally?<br />
PM: It always is better to have a win than a loss. As I've<br />
said before, winning beats the hell out of losing. We've got<br />
a situation now where quite clearly, if you go round<br />
Australia just quickly, let me give you a run down.<br />
Queensland Labor looking better than it ever has. NSW<br />
the government of Greiner already in decay and Labor's morale<br />
up a great deal. We've won in Victoria, Bannon will win in<br />
South Australia, an election coming up in Tasmania we have<br />
a great deal of confidence there we've now won in West<br />
Australia. So, as I say, it would be silly to be complacent<br />
but given all the gloom and doom that was around last year, I<br />
think we're in good shape.<br />
JOURNALIST: You do sound like you're claiming victory for<br />
the Labor Party.<br />
PM: I'm doing no more than what Mr Dowding has done. I ' m<br />
repeating him, I'm not claiming victory, but he is saying he<br />
has optimism, on what's in now, that the Government has been<br />
returned. My comments therefore are based upon that premise<br />
of Mr Dowding.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given those swings in the mortgage belt areas,<br />
are you concerned about implications of that for Labor's<br />
federal seats? </p>
<p>PM: if you were going to an election now there's no doubt<br />
that the tight monetary policy which produced these sorts of<br />
results would be uncomftortable electorally. But we're not<br />
going to an election now, we are conducting economic policy<br />
in a way that's necessary in the light of the present<br />
circumstances. The simple fact of life, which again I think<br />
the electors of Western Australia seem to have understood, is..<br />
that the level of economic activity has been somewhat too<br />
high. We've got to not sit back a little bit because we<br />
can't sustain this Level of imports associated with that high<br />
level of activity. We believe that the policy that we've got<br />
in place will start to have the sort of outcome that we want<br />
and by the time that we go to the next election I don't think<br />
we' 11 have exactly the same circumstances that we've got now.<br />
JOURNALIST: When will that be, in the light of this result?<br />
This result doesn't change the window that I've talked<br />
about. It's the latter part of this year to May of next<br />
year. I've been consistent about that no change.<br />
JOURNALIST: We've seen two very tight elections in the last<br />
six months, Victoria and Western Australia. Do you think<br />
that's the way it's going to be up to and including the next<br />
federal election?<br />
PM: I think Labor wil. continue to win. We'll win the next<br />
federal election. I hope to retain the sort of majority<br />
we'ye got now, perhaps increase it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What part did leadership play, do you think, in<br />
the WA poll?<br />
PM: A great deal. Peter Dowding was clearly intrinsically a<br />
better leader and was perceived to be a better leader. I'm<br />
. thnoetm sehlevrees , t o knock Mr McKinnon, the Liberals will do that<br />
but he was clearly a much better leader and much<br />
more acceptable. So leadership was pretty important.<br />
JOURNALIST: WA Inc clearly played a role in the election. Do<br />
you think it's an issue which was confined to WA or are you<br />
concerned that it could spill over into the federal arena?<br />
PM: If it spills over to the federal arena I tell you who'l<br />
be worried, and it won't be us. If you want to look at where<br />
there is corruption between parties and business, it's not<br />
with Labor. You look at Queensland and NSW, it's the<br />
conservative forces that need to be worried about that issue,<br />
not us.<br />
ends </p>
