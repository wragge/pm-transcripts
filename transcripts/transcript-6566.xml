    <content><![CDATA[<p>11 DECEMBER 1984<br />The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, is toÂ visit Australia on January 15-18 at the invitation ofÂ the Australian Government.</p>
<p>Mr Nakasone will be accompanied by his wife andÂ daughter and also by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,Â Mr Abe, and a party of officials-and business leaders.Â Australia places great importance on the maintenance andÂ further development of the mutually beneficial relationshipÂ between Australia and Japan. This visit will provide theÂ opportunity for a continuation of the broad-ranging discussionsÂ which were commenced in Tokyo during my visit to Japan inÂ January-February this year. It will also be an opportunityÂ for Australia to return the very generous hospitality extendedÂ to me at that time by the Prime Minister Nakasone and the peopleÂ of Japan.</p>
<p>Since my visit there have been important developments in particularÂ major areas of our commodity trade with Japan. In my discussionsÂ with Mr Nakasone I will emphasise the mutually advantageous nature ofÂ our trading relationship with Japan in these commodities, and ourÂ firm expectations about continued access to the Japanese marketÂ on a basis which fully reflects Australia's competitive strength.Â The further development of areas of joint economic interest in our<br />bilateral relationship will be another focus for our talks.Â I anticipate that developments in the international economyÂ and trading environment, regional economic cooperation, andÂ disarmament, will also feature prominently.</p>
<p>Mr Nakasone will visit Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, andÂ will meet the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria.Â Other details of the program are being developed inÂ consultation with the Japanese authorities.</p>
