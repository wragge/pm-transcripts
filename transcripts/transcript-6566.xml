    <content><![CDATA[<p>11 DECEMBER 1984<br />The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, is to visit Australia on January 15-18 at the invitation of the Australian Government.</p>
<p>Mr Nakasone will be accompanied by his wife and daughter and also by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Abe, and a party of officials-and business leaders. Australia places great importance on the maintenance and further development of the mutually beneficial relationship between Australia and Japan. This visit will provide the opportunity for a continuation of the broad-ranging discussions which were commenced in Tokyo during my visit to Japan in January-February this year. It will also be an opportunity for Australia to return the very generous hospitality extended to me at that time by the Prime Minister Nakasone and the people of Japan.</p>
<p>Since my visit there have been important developments in particular major areas of our commodity trade with Japan. In my discussions with Mr Nakasone I will emphasise the mutually advantageous nature of our trading relationship with Japan in these commodities, and our firm expectations about continued access to the Japanese market on a basis which fully reflects Australia's competitive strength. The further development of areas of joint economic interest in our<br />bilateral relationship will be another focus for our talks. I anticipate that developments in the international economy and trading environment, regional economic cooperation, and disarmament, will also feature prominently.</p>
<p>Mr Nakasone will visit Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and will meet the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria. Other details of the program are being developed in consultation with the Japanese authorities.</p>
