Mr Speaker</p>
<p>Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet</p>
<p>Leader of the Opposition and party leaders</p>
<p>Honourable Members</p>
<p>It is truly a privilege to be the first Australian Prime Minister, indeed the first foreign head of government,to address members of the Parliament of New Zealand. </p>
<p>I accept your welcome to this historic chamber as a profound tribute to the friendship between our nations and our people.</p>
<p>I also acknowledge it has been some time since a full bilateral visit by an Australian Prime Minister and I'm glad to be able to put that to right.</p>
<p>But more than that, I don't want familiarity to slide into forgetfulness.</p>
<p>I therefore announce that Mr Key and I have agreed to restore the pattern of regular Prime Ministerial exchanges that we have had in the past. </p>
<p>I look forward to hosting Prime Ministerial talks in Australia next year.</p>
<p>And I look forward to coming back to New Zealand in 2013.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>It is a great honour to address members of this parliament and through it, the people you represent.</p>
<p>Yours is one of the oldest continuous democratic legislatures in the world.</p>
<p>The first to recognise the right of women to vote.</p>
<p>A leader in reconciliation with its First Peoples.</p>
<p>Among the first parliaments to respond to the challenge of climate change by putting a price on carbon.</p>
<p>New Zealand may be a small nation.</p>
<p>But one with a bold vision of its place in the world.</p>
<p>For Australia, New Zealand is the natural partner in all that we believe and all that we hope for.</p>
<p>As I look around this historic House, the plaques and wreaths commemorating battles from the Boer War to Vietnam are snapshots of the shared and lasting bonds between our two nations.</p>
<p>Our ties were indelibly forged in hardship and mateship, from Gallipoli and the Somme to Tobruk, Korea and beyond.</p>
<p>Our soldiers, as has been said, came âfrom the uttermost ends of the earthâ.</p>
<p>And wherever Australian and New Zealand blood has been shed, it remains sacred ground.</p>
<p>Sacred because when our young men were sent to far shores, they went not for wealth or gain.</p>
<p>But to defend common values and a treasured way of life.</p>
<p>The freedom to speak and pray and write.</p>
<p>The freedom to elect leaders and stand safe under the rule of law.</p>
<p>The freedom to succeed that drew men like Peter Fraser and Keith Holyoake from the most modest background to the highest office.</p>
<p>These are what ANZAC means.</p>
<p>A story of courage and conviction told and retold in homes and schools, in the pubs and clubs, throughout the length and breadth of both lands.</p>
<p>A story also infused by the freedom from deference and formality that makes Australians and New Zealanders so different from anyone else and yet so very like each other.</p>
<p>But ANZAC is not a legend confined to records or books.</p>
<p>It is a living story.</p>
<p>A story that lives in the courage of Willie Apiata, Mark Donaldson and Ben Roberts-Smith.</p>
<p>The ANZAC spirit will receive a practical expression from next month when our personnel join together in the new Ready Response Force headquarters to be based in Brisbane.</p>
<p>This Force will provide a robust capability to meet contingencies, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief across the region we love so much.</p>
<p>And, of course, the ANZAC spirit lives on in the most strategically challenging theatre of our times, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Again, a conflict against those  -  terrorists  -  who threaten our cherished way of life and against whom we must prevail.</p>
<p>Today I stand before this Parliament and pay tribute to the men and women of our armed forces.</p>
<p>The road is hard and the price can be very high.</p>
<p>Just two days ago, I attended the funeral of Corporal Richard Atkinson, the 22nd Australian to be killed in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I embraced his family and felt, deeply, their immeasurable grief.</p>
<p>New Zealand has not been spared this anguish. </p>
<p>Not in the past, with the death of Lieutenant Tim O'Donnell, the first member of the New Zealand Defence Force to fall in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And not today, with the terrible news of another sad loss for New Zealand, the death of Private Mila. </p>
<p>We grieve for these men and their families as we grieve for our own.</p>
<p>Because the ANZAC story speaks for both our nations.</p>
<p>An imperishable Trans-Tasman bond.</p>
<p>They can never be replaced, our fallen.  But they shall never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>In the 1890s, there was a possibility that New Zealand and Australia might formally have joined their destinies to each other.</p>
<p>A relic of that aspiration even remains in our Constitution to this day.</p>
<p>But it was never necessary.</p>
<p>Our founders could not have imagined the extraordinary events that would bring our nations far closer than any words or any laws.</p>
<p>Not forged in meeting rooms by old men wearing suits.</p>
<p>But by young men in trenches wearing slouch hats and lemon squeezers.</p>
<p>That is why I say Australia has many alliances and friendships around the world.</p>
<p>Economic and defence partnerships of every kind.</p>
<p>But New Zealand alone is family. </p>
<p>When those 29 men never came home from the Pike River mine, we didn't just mourn for the two Australians.</p>
<p>We mourned for them all.</p>
<p>Family.</p>
<p>When Pike River exploded, New Zealand didn't have to ask Australia to send help.</p>
<p>We just did.</p>
<p>And when natural disasters hit Australia this summer, New Zealand didn't need to be asked to lend a hand.</p>
<p>You just did.</p>
<p>And our gratitude is boundless.</p>
<p>Prime Minister,</p>
<p>Your predecessor, Sir John Hall said there were 1200 reasons that separated Australia and New Zealand </p>
<p>-      the 1200 miles of the Tasman Sea.</p>
<p>The Australia-New Zealand memorial in Canberra tells a very different story.</p>
<p>It is a sculpture unlike any of the other memorials that enshrine my nation's capital.</p>
<p>It is a simple, graceful curve of bronze, representing the handle of a basket used traditionally to collect flax seed.</p>
<p>It embodies the Maori saying that we each hold one handle of the basket.</p>
<p>Shared effort. </p>
<p>Shared memory.</p>
<p>Shared sacrifice.</p>
<p>Underneath that memorial is etched a poem by the New Zealand poet Jenny Bornholdt.</p>
<p>In it she describes the Tasman not as a barrier, but a bridge:  âa bridge of faith.â</p>
<p>A faith anchored and bonded in the past.</p>
<p>But also a faith directed resolutely towards the future.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>It is true we have done great things in the past.</p>
<p>Remarkable things.</p>
<p>Not just in war but in peace as well.</p>
<p>We took sheltered, insular economies and opened themto the world through the remarkable reforms of the 1980s and 90s.</p>
<p>At the same time we opened our economies to each other creating a degree of integration that is unparalleled throughout the world.</p>
<p>It was the first bilateral trade agreement of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>It remains the gold standard in trade liberalisation.</p>
<p>It was not an easy decision as Robert Muldoon and Malcolm Fraser grappled with the realities of a fast-changing world.</p>
<p>But the Agreement was achieved, and it has served us well.</p>
<p>There was another author of CER who deserves our acknowledgement, a great New Zealand diplomat and politician, Hugh Templeton.</p>
<p>It will be my very special honour this afternoon to investMr Templeton with an Honorary Order of Australia for his pivotal role in establishing the CER</p>
<p>Hugh Templeton's career is the story of the modern New Zealand.</p>
<p>He went to London as a junior diplomat in 1954, representing a nation that, like Australia, relied on primary production, sheltered behind tariff walls and called Great Britain âhomeâ.</p>
<p>But as the 70s and 80s unfolded, Hugh and his fellow leaders on both sides of the Tasman and both sides of politics knew it was time to change.</p>
<p>Britain had joined with Europe.</p>
<p>Asia's economic miracle was unfolding.</p>
<p>We could not afford to be left behind.</p>
<p>And we were not.</p>
<p>Our leaders found the courage to change, and those changes were hard.</p>
<p>Perhaps even harder on New Zealand than Australia.</p>
<p>But those decisions were right then, and they remain right now.</p>
<p>CER has been an enduring foundation for new ventures such as the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement and the Single Economic Market initiative.</p>
<p>Thanks to these agreements, our nations are closer than ever before.</p>
<p>Goods and services flow freely.</p>
<p>Our insolvency and copyright laws have been harmonised, along with competition and financial services policy.</p>
<p>Our citizens can work in their chosen profession in each country thanks to mutual recognition.</p>
<p>Students in each country pay only domestic fees for their education.</p>
<p>Reforms unprecedented in their scope and ambition.</p>
<p>Reforms that are hard.</p>
<p>But reforms that have worked.</p>
<p>Two-way goods trade between our two countries has grown at 8 per cent a year since CER.</p>
<p>Trans-Tasman trade is worth around A$21billion orNZ$27 billion a year.</p>
<p>More Australian businesses export to New Zealand than to any other country.</p>
<p>And New Zealand's top export market is Australia.</p>
<p>Now it's time to write the next chapter as we journey towards a Single Economic Market.</p>
<p>During my visit, I've been pleased to discuss with Prime Minister Key the excellent progress being achieved on the SmartGate project to create borderless travel between our two countries.</p>
<p>A joint study will commence this month to examine how we create a truly âdomestic-likeâ aviation experience.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>Prime Minister Key and I will today sign the Investment Protocol to CER, a significant milestone for our two countries.</p>
<p>The Protocol will make investment simpler and cheaper, creating employment and opportunity on both sides of the Tasman.</p>
<p>For New Zealand, this agreement provides the most liberalised access to the Australian investment market.</p>
<p>For Australia, it makes CER our most liberal and comprehensive trade agreement.</p>
<p>And as family, that is how it should be.</p>
<p>But friends,</p>
<p>The âbridge of faithâ extends not just to the past, not just to today.</p>
<p>But to the future.</p>
<p>Today, the world changes more in a decade than it used to change in a century.</p>
<p>And we must deepen our resolve to reform and adapt.</p>
<p>We need to embrace the transformative possibilities that will create the high-skill, high-tech economies of the future.</p>
<p>The possibilities opened up by high speed broadband.</p>
<p>Clean energy.</p>
<p>Smart manufacturing.</p>
<p>Creative industries.</p>
<p>World class skills and training.</p>
<p>All underpinned by rigorous fiscal discipline, constant structural reform and an unswerving commitment tofree trade.</p>
<p>In that context, let me be clear that Australia accepts the verdict of the global umpire and will implement the WTO rulings on the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia.</p>
<p>We accept the obligations of free trade, just as we embrace the possibilities of free trade.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>For Australia, these possibilities are keenly sharpened in the context of the unprecedented change unfolding in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>China's rise, India's growth and the emergence of Indonesia, are changing the strategic contours of the region.</p>
<p>As the global balance of power shifts to the Asia-Pacific, it will throw up real challenges that will need to be collectively managed.</p>
<p>Challenges associated with the inevitable strategic flux brought by the changes unfolding in the Asia-Pacific. </p>
<p>And broader challenges brought by globalisation, such as climate change, food security, natural disasters, people smuggling and pandemics. </p>
<p>But it will also create tremendous opportunities for those brave enough to seize them.</p>
<p>We should not fear this future but embrace it.</p>
<p>Together, we have enduring sources of strength.</p>
<p>The strength we find in each other.</p>
<p>And the strength we find in our people and our history and our values.</p>
<p>If we don't shape the future we want, we may well face a future not of our choosing</p>
<p>And Australia and New Zealand have never been ones to sit on the sidelines of history.</p>
<p>We are both stable, progressive, well-governed countries, respected for our pragmatism and our ideas. </p>
<p>We have highly mobile and educated populations.</p>
<p>We have competitive and resilient economies. </p>
<p>And we have highly capable and effective armed forces.</p>
<p>Harnessed in partnership, these will allow us to confront difficulties and grasp opportunities.</p>
<p>This is why our two nations must remain active and engaged:</p>
<p>Reforming our own economies.</p>
<p>Uniting ourselves across the Tasman.</p>
<p>And reaching out together to the world beyond.</p>
<p>Before us we have the prospect of a Trans Pacific Partnership.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest economic opportunity for our two nations since CER.</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that New Zealand has led the wayas one of the Trans Pacific Partnership founding partners since 2005.</p>
<p>I was proud to stand with Prime Minister Key, President Obama and our seven other partners in November last year pledging to the make the expanded Partnership a reality by the time of APEC this year.</p>
<p>The Partnership could be a stepping stone to an Asia Pacific Free Trade Area</p>
<p>If we achieve that, we will create a free trade community as significant as the EU or NAFTA.</p>
<p>A zone of trade, investment, jobs as big as the Pacific itself.</p>
<p>To do this, we will need not just our own efforts.</p>
<p>But the commitment and energy of many others, foremost our great friend and ally the United States.</p>
<p>An active, engaged America is a fundamental feature of the international system that underpins our stability, security and prosperity.</p>
<p>Australia, like New Zealand, remains deeply committed to this international system and we will work with key emerging players  -  not least China and India  -  to ensure that it continues to deliver the benefits both our peoples have enjoyed for so long.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>We know we can meet the challenges of tomorrow because we've done great things before.</p>
<p>But in the last century, the conflicts and the issues that defined the world were fought out in another hemisphere.</p>
<p>Today they are decided here.</p>
<p>This is the Asia Pacific century, and we are at its heart.</p>
<p>Here under the southern cross, emblazoned on both our flags, we have created two of the most successful societies in the contemporary world.</p>
<p>Two advanced, multicultural democracies, tied by tradition and affection to the old world, but anchored firmly in the new.</p>
<p>This is our time.</p>
<p>A time for optimism.</p>
<p>Because our best days lie ahead.</p>
<p>That is why I come here on this journey of hope.</p>
<p>To celebrate all that is best in us.</p>
<p>And bring closer the future that awaits our grasp.</p>
<p>Drawing together.</p>
<p>Reforming.</p>
<p>Reaching out to the world</p>
<p>And achieving more together than we ever could alone.</p>
<p>Thank you for the privilege of addressing you today.</p>
<p>You honour me.</p>
<p>And you honour my country.</p>
<p>Kia Ora. </p>
