SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE FEDERAL CONFERENCE OF THE HEALTH AND<br />
RESEARCH EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SYDNEY, MONDAY 3 MARCH 1975<br />
It is seven years since I had the pleasure<br />
of opening an annual conference of your association.<br />
It was a memorable conference and a memorable year for<br />
my party. It was in 1968 that Labor formulated its<br />
health scheme. In my speech on that occasion I took<br />
one of the first opportunities available to me to<br />
explain publicly the fundamentals of our health program<br />
and the philosophy behind it.<br />
Since then I have often had cause to be<br />
grateful to your association for the support you have<br />
given us support through two elections, continuing<br />
support for one of the fundamentals of Labor's program.<br />
Experience has taught me to be grateful for the fact<br />
that medical care is not solely in the hands of the<br />
medical profession. Health is too serious a matter<br />
to be left to doctors! Your association is one of the<br />
oldest and largest trade unions in Australia. Your<br />
members include a wide range of workers in public, and<br />
private hospitals, in psychiatric hospitals, child<br />
welfare institutions, ambulance services, universities<br />
and laboratories. No one is better qualified by dayto-<br />
day experience to understand Australia's health<br />
problems, why they exist and how they may be resolved.<br />
You know at first hand the shortcomings and inadequacies<br />
of our hospitals, the lack of equipment and facilities,<br />
the problems of staffing and morale. You have seen the<br />
failings of the antiquated and inefficient private<br />
health insurence scheme. At the same time you have<br />
been in the vanguard of many important industrial<br />
reforms. That is why I value so highly the support<br />
you have given the Government support expressed in<br />
successive conference resolutions. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Anyone who heard my speech to you seven years<br />
ago will be forgiven for thinking that the more things<br />
change, the more things ~ remain the same. For the truly<br />
remarkable thing, the sobering thing, is that so much<br />
of what I said to you in 1968 the facts, the figures,<br />
the arguments of 1968 are still part of the current<br />
debate about health care in this country. The Labor<br />
health scheme, the scheme developed and nurtured in<br />
those days, has of course been modified over the years,<br />
but its essential purpose remains the same. We are<br />
determined to bring universal health insurance to every<br />
Australian. We are determined to ensure that every<br />
citizen, regardless of means, enjoys the best medical<br />
and hospital care that an affluent and advanced society<br />
can provide. It is one thing, of course, to grant universal<br />
health insurance coverage. It is another to see that<br />
those benefits give real security against the cost of<br />
hospital and medical care and that the price of this<br />
guarantee can be met by the community. Labor's scheme<br />
means that for the first time the whole community will<br />
be undertaking responsibility for the community's healthjust<br />
as the community is responsible for the education<br />
of chiLldren. It is a sad and astonishing fact that<br />
Australians can still be brought to court, and even put<br />
in gaol, because of an * inability to pay medical and<br />
hospital bills. It is a sad and astonishing fact that<br />
more than a million Australians have no protection<br />
against medical or hospital expenses. And the people<br />
who remain outside the present system are precisely<br />
those most in need of health insurance coverage.<br />
It is certainly not for want of trying that<br />
seven years after it was first proposed, Labor's health<br />
scheme has still to be implemented. Never in the history<br />
of our country has a major social reform faced such<br />
sustained and unscrupulous opposition. our proposals<br />
have been debated interminably. No policy has been more<br />
thoroughly expounded or widely canvassed. Our health<br />
program was adopted at the ALP Federal Conference in<br />
1969. It was first put to the people at the 1969 general<br />
election and was in fact the central issue in that<br />
campaign. It received a clear mandate from the people<br />
in the 1972 elections and again in the 1974 elections.<br />
So the people have three times voted for it, twice<br />
approved it, twice empowered us to put it into action.<br />
The basic legislation has been passed three times by<br />
the House of Representatives. It was one of the bills<br />
that formed the basis of the double dissolution. It<br />
was passed a fourth time at the joint sitting of both<br />
Houses last August. It has had repeated electoral and<br />
legislative endorsement. If ever a party had a mandate<br />
for its legislation, the Labor Party has a mandate for<br />
its health scheme. / 3 </p>
<p>w<br />

There is something about universal health<br />
schemes that arouses a special fury in the hearts of<br />
conservatives. In every western country social democratic<br />
parties have had bitter and protracted struggles to<br />
implement similar proposals. The British national<br />
health service a scheme very different from ours, a<br />
scheme, nevertheless, much maligned and much misunderstood<br />
has been so widely accepted that no Conservative<br />
Government has dared to undo it. You will remember<br />
the efforts of doctors and conservative politicians<br />
in the United States to sabotage the Medicare scheme.<br />
Similar battles have been fought in Canada and New<br />
Zealand. All these schemes have differed in points of<br />
detail, sometimes quite radically, but all of them have<br />
had one basic purpose to make medical treatment<br />
available to all who need it, to ensure that medical<br />
care is not just another marketable commodity but a<br />
right of every citizen.<br />
Of course it is not just doctors who oppose<br />
the health scheme. If we only had the doctors to contend<br />
with our scheme would have been working long ago. In<br />
fact there are thousands of responsible and fair-minded<br />
doctors who support us. The truth is that our health<br />
scheme arouses the deepest conservative instincts in<br />
our political opponents our opponents in the Parliament<br />
and our opponents in the community. The issues involved<br />
are quite fundamental to the basic political struggle.<br />
That struggle is between those who want greater equality<br />
and those who want to preserve the power and privilege<br />
of a minority. It is perfectly obvious that doctors will not<br />
be a whit worse off under the Labor scheme than they<br />
are at present. I am sure the doctors know this in<br />
their hearts. Their incomes will not suffer; indeed<br />
they will rise. Their practices, their day-to-day routines,<br />
will not change. All that will change from the doctors'<br />
point of view is the method of settling accounts. For<br />
many doctors this process will be more prompt, more<br />
simple and more reliable. I regret to say that doctors<br />
have been the victims of their own scare tactics and<br />
irrational prejudice. After next July, when Medibank<br />
is in operation, they will come to see that their fears<br />
were groundless. They will see that they were hoodwinked<br />
by a minority of extremists and propagandists in the<br />
profession and in the Parliament. I am dismayed at the<br />
lengths to which this great profession has gone to<br />
frustrate the wishes of the Australian people. There<br />
has never been a time when doctors were more at odds<br />
with popular opinion, more insensitive to the community's<br />
needs, or more indifferent to self-inflicted wounds on<br />
their professional reputation. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Misguided as their opposition has been, the<br />
obstruction of the opposition has been even more disgraceful,<br />
their obstinacy on this matter, their utter<br />
contempt for the expressed wishes of the people, have<br />
been staggering. Even when the health bills were passed<br />
at the joint sitting, they proceeded to block our ancillary<br />
legislation to give effect to the Government's measures.<br />
This obliged us to make substantial changes in the method<br />
of financing the scheme.<br />
Even now, with plans for Medibank well advanced,<br />
the Opposition is still threatening and undermining<br />
and misrepresenting our proposals. Mr Snedden last<br />
week told a public meeting in Melbourne that the Liberals<br />
would dismantle Medibank and pull down Labor's plans<br />
for national superannuation and a national compensation<br />
and rehabilitation scheme. These are all programs to<br />
which your association has pledged support. They are<br />
all programs for which the Government has a mandate<br />
from the Australian people. We cannot ignore these<br />
threats. Australians have already seen how a right-wing<br />
Federal Government can destroy a free hospital system.<br />
You will remember that every Australian had free standard<br />
ward hospital treatment for five years in the late<br />
and early ' 50s under an agreement between the States<br />
and the postwar Federal Labor Government. The Menzies<br />
Government broke off that agreement. By June 1953 most<br />
State Governments had re-introduced charges for public<br />
ward patients. Australia's first free hospital scheme<br />
was dismantled. So don't think it cannot happen with<br />
Medibank. It has happened once, and the Liberals would<br />
do it again. Our opponents were never able to decide what<br />
their attitude to the old health scheme should be. They<br />
argued in one breath that no change was needed and in<br />
the next breath that the present scheme can be easily<br />
repaired. When I last spoke to you I drew attention to<br />
some of the central weaknesses of the voluntary scheme.<br />
The Liberals had years to correct the shortcomings of<br />
the private insurance system. They did nothing. Nearly<br />
all the criticisms I made in 1968 can still be made of<br />
the private insurance scheme. It is costly. It is<br />
riddled with duplication and wasteful competition. It<br />
ignores the needs of a million or more Australians who<br />
have no medical or hospital cover. Contributors are<br />
obliged to pay a substantial proportion of the cost of<br />
the health services they receive. The scheme is illequipped<br />
to take account of increases in fee scales.<br />
It imposes unnecessary hardship on pensioners. </p>
<p>Many of these weaknesses were exposed in<br />
the report of the Nimmo Committee in 1969. Nimmo<br />
proposed many reforms to the old scheme. For example,<br />
they suggested voluntary deductions by employers to<br />
achieve a wider voluntary cover. They proposed a<br />
national Health Insurance Commission and standard ward<br />
hospital care without a means test. The Liberals did<br />
none of these things, but all of them have been incorporated,<br />
in various forms, into the Government's present<br />
proposals. And here we find a particularly striking<br />
example of Opposition obstruction and hypocrisy. Early<br />
in 1968 the Senate set up a committee to look into<br />
hospital and medical charges. Mr Justice Nirrmo' s<br />
committee, to which I have referred, was established<br />
by the Liberal Government partly as a counter to the<br />
Senate committee. I do not disparage either of these<br />
inquiries; they did valuable work. But it was clear<br />
that the previous Government was prepared to ignore<br />
both committees when their findings didn't suit them.<br />
Last December the Senate removed important provisions<br />
from our health legislation relating to the supervision<br />
of health insurance organisations. These provisions<br />
were essential to protect the rights of contributors.<br />
We accepted the Senate's amendments last year<br />
because, had we not done so, other important provisions<br />
of the legislation would have been held up. Last week,<br />
however, the Minister for Social Security, Bill Hayden,<br />
brought in new legislation to cover the provisions<br />
deleted by the Senate. The point is that the Senate's<br />
action last December was directly counter to the<br />
recommendations of both the Nimmo and the Senate's own<br />
committee established in 1968. It was counter to an<br />
undertaking given by Dr Forbes when he was Liberal<br />
Minister for Health. Dr Forbes promised on 4 March 1970<br />
that he would implement the Nimmo recommendations<br />
relating to health fund reserves and the establishment<br />
of a special stabilisation account. In other words<br />
the Senate was ignoring the recommendations of its<br />
own committee and the promises of a Liberal Minister<br />
in obstructing our legislation.<br />
The development of social welfare policy<br />
invariably calls for compromise and flexibility. It<br />
has never been our approach to strike dogmatic attitudes<br />
or to ignore criticism. I believe Bill Hayden's<br />
handling of the Medibank negotiations was a model of<br />
firmness and fair play. To listen to our opponents<br />
you would think we had forced through every detail of<br />
our original scheme and done nothing to accommodate<br />
reasonable suggestions from doctors or interested groups.<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
It is worth looking at some of the modifications<br />
we have made in evolving the final shape of the<br />
Medibank scheme. I don't regard these concessions as<br />
any sort of weakness or backtracting since none of them<br />
undermines the essential structure of our plan. Indeed<br />
I acknowledge that many of the suggestions we have<br />
incorporated will do much to widen and strengthen the<br />
scheme. For example, we have decided to allow people<br />
who want additional private health insurance to insure<br />
with private funds; we have agreed to provide full<br />
benefits for medical services in private hospitals; we<br />
have agreed to increase by 30 per cent to $ 16 a day<br />
the bed subsidy payable to patients in private hospitals;<br />
we have agreed to defer our measures to ensure that<br />
doctors adhere to schedule fees and drop premium<br />
payments designed to encourage doctors to bill the<br />
Health Insurance Commission directly. All this was<br />
done in a process of open public debate, in a spirit<br />
of, co-operation and frankness. Yet the AMA and the<br />
Opposition ignore these reforms and modifications. They<br />
mouth slogans about " freedom of choice" and " nationalised<br />
medicine". For those who still give credence to these<br />
rantings I repeat categorically: We cannot nationalise<br />
medicine and we have not attempted to do so. And every<br />
Australian under Labor's scheme will have complete<br />
freedom to go to any doctor he chooses.<br />
There is one class of patient who will gain<br />
particular benefit from the Medibank scheme. I refer<br />
to pensioners. Currently Pensioner Medical Service<br />
patients are entitled to free treatment only for GP<br />
consultations. In future, pensioner patients will have<br />
access to all medical practitioner treatment specialist<br />
as well as general practitioner, procedural and diagnostic<br />
as well as consultations. Under Medibank, all treatment<br />
will be free to pensioner patients whose doctors agree<br />
to bill Medibank directly that is, if their doctors<br />
accept the medical benefits payable for a particular<br />
service and do not charge pensioners an amount on top<br />
of the benefits. For the rest of the community, as you<br />
know, treatment will also be free if doctors bill Medibank<br />
direct. They will not be bound to do so, and will be<br />
free, if they wish, to bill patients in the traditional<br />
way. In this case the patient will have to meet only<br />
per cent of the schedule fee up a maximum amount<br />
of We are offering the States a much better deal<br />
for hospitals than they have now. We are ready to enter<br />
into agreements with the State Governments to share<br />
equally the net costs of operating State public hospital<br />
systems. This will mean, as it did in the late<br />
and early ' 50s, public ward treatment free of means test<br />
and free of charge. For those choosing private treatment<br />
either in a public or private hospital, there will be an<br />
$ 18 a day subsidy towards hospital bed charges. It is<br />
frankly difficult to imagine why any State Government<br />
would refuse such a generous cost-sharing arrangement<br />
and penalise its citizens so severely. It is obvious / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
that hospital charges, which have already risen steeply,<br />
will go higher if the present financing system continues.<br />
We are building on existing and well-accepted<br />
public hospital arrangements. The only innovation is<br />
that honorary medical services ( those in public wards<br />
for which no payment is made to the doctor) will be<br />
eliminated. Doctors will be paid on a sessional or<br />
other contract basis. After all doctors in Queensland<br />
are already paid on this basis, and it is accepted by<br />
the AMA in that State. It is moreover, an increasingly<br />
common practice for many visiting specialists at public<br />
hospitals in all States. So far only Tasmania and<br />
Queensland have agreed to co-operate in our scheme. I<br />
hope the other States will come to accept it for the<br />
sake of their people. We owe it to ourselves and our<br />
families to see that every State Government participates<br />
in the new arrangements.<br />
Medibank will mean substantial savings for<br />
every Australian contributing to a health insurance<br />
fund. I give examples of what contributors will save<br />
in New South Wales. For medical insurance alone, $ 96.72<br />
a year; for medical and public ward hospital insurance<br />
$ 157.04 a year; for medical and intermediate ward<br />
insurance $ 132.72; for medical and private ward insurance<br />
$ 123.76. For all that, it would be a mistake to think<br />
of Medibank merely in terms of money savings of extra<br />
cash in the pocket. It represents a great commitment to<br />
community well-being, a great experiment in social<br />
responsibility, a milestone in the history of progressive<br />
Labor legislation. When Medibank is in operation, when<br />
people come to see and feel the practical benefits of<br />
the scheme and the increased sense of social security<br />
it fosters, there will no longer be any talk of pulling<br />
it down. It will stand, like all great reformist measures,<br />
as a permanent landmark in our legislative history. Its<br />
success will owe much to the steadfast support it has<br />
received inside and outside the Labor Party from social<br />
welfare workers, from hospital workers, from enlightened<br />
members of the medical profession, and not least from<br />
the members of your association, whose annual conference<br />
I now have pleasure in opening. </p>
