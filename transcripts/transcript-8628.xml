PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY APPROX 8: 00 PM<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
TO THE OLYMPIC TEAM DINNER SHERATON WENTWORTH, SYDNEY,<br />
AUGUST 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
An honour to be here In such illustrious company -the<br />
most successful Australian Olympic team-in thirty years.<br />
Twenty seven medals. Fifty two medallists.<br />
Any number of personal bests. High rankings in events<br />
where Australians have never before excelled.<br />
A performance which gives us grounds to believe that<br />
we're entering another golden age of Australian sportand<br />
the performance of the Rugby Union side In Capetown,<br />
and the cricket team in Sri Lanka is further evidence.<br />
I have to say that in those two cases, as in Barcelona,<br />
there was some thing more than winning attachedto the_<br />
per forman~ ce.<br />
There was character.<br />
In the last two months Australia's sportsmen and women<br />
have been outstanding ambassadors for their country.<br />
There have been ample measures of both brilliance and<br />
grit. A terrific sense of purpose and, awareness of what the<br />
spirit of sport is all about.<br />
It's a truism that Australians love their sport.<br />
. In fact-I think-it goes further then -that I think<br />
Australians see in sport the things they value.<br />
Like courage, comradeship competition. Winning.<br />
We value winning when Kieran Perkins swam that<br />
magnificent 1500 metres, Kathy watt, Matt Ryan, Clint<br />
Robinson, the Equestrian Team, the Double Sculls, the<br />
Qarsome Foursome when they won, Australians won too. </p>

We shared their triumph.<br />
All thos e medallists did us 8 bit of good.<br />
So did some of those terrific fourths like Michael<br />
Murphy. And so did a lot of other great performances, including<br />
some desperately unlucky ones like David Green's.<br />
The point is, I think, that it is not the winning which<br />
really moves us.<br />
It beats losing, there's no doubt.<br />
But what really moves us I think is the kelie√± that the<br />
athlete embodies.<br />
The belief we know you had to have to go so far.<br />
We are moved by your faith in yourselves.<br />
Your spirit.<br />
The fact that you are Australian and you have this spirit<br />
this world-conquering spirit moves us.<br />
it's why we honour you tonight.<br />
You have been great ambassadors. You have done us proud.<br />
More than that, you have set us an example.<br />
You remind us of the spirit in this country that made<br />
it a great country, that will assure our future.<br />
So I know I Bpeak for all Australians when I congratulate<br />
you and thank you, and wish you the very best of luck<br />
in everything you do.<br />
