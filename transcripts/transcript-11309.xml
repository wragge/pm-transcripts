    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Indonesian people and government are to be warmly congratulated</p>
<p> on what appears to be a remarkably peaceful ballot.</p>
<p>Indonesia's first fully free elections since 1955, they are a</p>
<p> landmark in Indonesia's history. The electoral campaign and the</p>
<p> enthusiastic voter turn-out represent a real celebration of democracy.</p>
<p> Voting day was a tremendous demonstration of the commitment of Indonesians</p>
<p> to exercise their democratic rights in a peaceful way. All Indonesia's</p>
<p> friends will be heartened.</p>
<p>I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge President</p>
<p> Habibie's personal commitment to holding democratic elections.</p>
<p>The significance of the elections for Indonesia and our whole region</p>
<p> is hard to overestimate. The elections pave the way for Indonesia</p>
<p> for the first time in more than a generation to be governed by a democratically</p>
<p> elected government.</p>
<p>My government looks forward to working closely with whatever government</p>
<p> emerges as a result of the elections. We will continue to place the</p>
<p> highest priority on strengthening our links with Indonesia and supporting</p>
<p> Indonesia's political and economic reform programme.</p>
<p>Australia made a substantial contribution to the elections. We contributed</p>
<p> $15 million in assistance and a 25-strong team of election observers.</p>
<p> The Australian Electoral Commission has been on the ground for months</p>
<p> working with their Indonesian counterparts to help make the elections</p>
<p> a success.</p>
<p>I thank those Australians who helped before and during the elections.</p>
<p> 8 June 1999</p>
