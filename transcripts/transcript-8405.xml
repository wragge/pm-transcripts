JIM WALEY: Tim Ie is fast running out for Labor to dig<br />
Australia out of recession. New Prime Minister, Paul Keating,<br />
has very few shots left in the locker. His first will be the<br />
economic statement to be delivered on February 26th. Mr<br />
Keating is nowr sifting through the wish lists of business and<br />
union leaders lists that include large increases i~ n<br />
government spending, investment incentives for industry, arid<br />
superannuation reform. In the Prime Minister's latest catchcry<br />
he will be trying to do the hat-trick of creating jobs<br />
while keeping inflation down and lowering the foreign. debt.<br />
Mr Keating is with us this morning. To talk with him Sunday's<br />
political editor, Laurie Oakes. Laurie-<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Thanks, Jim. Mr Keating, welcome to the<br />
program. PAUL KEATING: Thank you, Laurie.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: On our last program last year our guest was<br />
also the Prime Minister a different Prime Minister. Has the<br />
change at the top made any difference for ordinary<br />
Australians? PAUL KEATING: Well, I mean this is a Labor Government; there<br />
will be a continuum in the policy but there'll obviously be a<br />
change in direction of some substance and there'll be a change<br />
in style. So, yes, there will be a difference but there will, </p>
<p>from front to back, be a continuum in the general direction.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Well, if that's the case what's in it for<br />
ordinary Australians? They've seen you squabbling for the job<br />
but now you're there what's in it for them?<br />
PAUL KEATING: When I say ' the continuum' the change is one<br />
of internationalising Australia; making Australia an<br />
externally oriented country and making that change, completing<br />
that change, arid in this case bringing Australia out of a<br />
recession and into a recovery. It is that, and the speed of<br />
that change and the quality of it, which I'm addressing myself<br />
to now and which will be different than what obtained in 1991.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: So you are better equipped to do that, in your<br />
view? PAUL KEATING,: Well, I think in the Party's view. That was<br />
what basically the election was about.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: The former Prime Minister is obviously planning<br />
to jump ship fairly soon. Can Labor win a by-election in<br />
Wills? PAUL KEATING: I'd like to think we could, but that's a matter<br />
for Bob. It's always been. It's a matter for anyone who's<br />
served this long in high public office is entitled to do as<br />
they please, I think, and if it's Bob's view that he's better<br />
out of the place, that's fine. If it is his view that he'd<br />
like to stay there, he can certainly stay with, I am sure, the<br />
support of everyone in the Caucus and certainly mine.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: The Party is very pessimistic, though, -about<br />
Wills. If you lost that it would obviously be damaging and<br />
presumably it would be seen as a rejection of your economic<br />
statement, wouldn't it?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well, I should look, let's not jump hurdles<br />
before we come to them but let's also not kid ourselves we're<br />
in a recession. We've been doing badly in the polls. If we<br />
lost Wills last month, this month or next month, in a sense it<br />
would be simply part of what the Labor Party would have to<br />
face whenever it sticks its head up electorally ahead of<br />
getting a recovery going; ahead of putting its changes into<br />
place and having its changes work. So I'd like to think we </p>
<p>could win Wills if it was if it is a vacant position. If it<br />
isn't, well there's no it's only speculation. If it is,<br />
then I'd like to think we could win it. But, by the same<br />
token, were we to were we not to it would be part of the<br />
price we paid for the recession and our general tardiness in<br />
coming out of it.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: If unemployment is still in double digits at<br />
the time of the next general election, can you win that?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well it depends where the direction is, I<br />
think, Laurie. If the direction is unemployment is<br />
stabilised and coming back, the answer is yes. If<br />
unemployment is still rising, much more difficult. It's a bit<br />
like interest rates in the 1990 election. The convention<br />
wisdom was, with interest rates, if you've got high interest<br />
rates you can't win a poll. Now I used to contest that often,<br />
and we did win the 1990 election and I would contest the view<br />
that a win is not possible with high unemployment but I think<br />
the direction of the economy becomes then terribly important.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: So if unemployment is still at 10 or 11 per<br />
cent you can win if the public sees that it's coming down?<br />
PAUL KEATING: If they think the direction if it's<br />
stabilised and heading down and the direction's changed. That<br />
is, the place is coming out and we've preserved all the big<br />
benefits, low inflation, that we've got the exports still<br />
running strongly and Australia will have a secure place in the<br />
LAURIE OAKES: It seems that<br />
PAUL KEATING: The worst thing would be to have a recession<br />
and then find yourself in the 1990s in a terrible long term<br />
economic hole. That we can avoid and I think if the nation<br />
know we've avoided that that we're not going to go the way<br />
of Argentina or some of these other countries that just can't<br />
pay for their imports, that just can't deal with their<br />
inflation rate, that just can't deal with their structure. If<br />
we do all those: things and we can because we're going to<br />
come out of this recession in much better shape than 1982-<br />
83---</p>
<p>LAURIE OAKES: But it's unlikely, isn't it, that unemployment<br />
will be below 10 per cent when you go to the polls or much<br />
below that?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well, let's wait and see.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: You've got no projections on that?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Not at this stage, no.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: The last time you were on this program was back<br />
in June on the clay before your first unsuccessful challenge---<br />
PAUL KEATING,: M~ m.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: And in that interview you promised a touch of<br />
excitement. What's happened? It's been more hesitancy and<br />
uncertainty than excitement, hasn't it?<br />
PAUL KEATING: 1' don't think so, Laurie. I think that Let<br />
me repeat what one Cabinet Minister said to me last week. it<br />
was said to me that the Cabinet meetings are again exciting<br />
are again exciting and I did say at the time that I thought<br />
we lacked a bit of esprit de corps and a touch of excitement,<br />
and I think that's coming back. I mean, I've seen this sort<br />
of You've ju[ st mentioned this line about me being nervous.<br />
I mean you can't win with the journos. For years I was too<br />
arrogant. For years I was insufferably arrogant and for six<br />
weeks I've had me head down working out what we should do with<br />
the place, and how to do it, and now I'm too demure. I mean<br />
now, Laurie, my job is to produce a statement which gives hope<br />
to the Australian people but I'm not going to be doing sort of<br />
bird calls on tele while I'm at it. I'm not going to be in<br />
there cooing around the television sets while I'm doing it. I<br />
mean, it's a serious job of work and it has to be done. One<br />
has to find one's way through it. I'm trying to do in six<br />
weeks what would normally take us six months but the<br />
enthusiasm within the Cabinet, the good will, the focusing on<br />
the job is more than I could have expected.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Do you think that excitement will spread to the<br />
public when the stateament emerges?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well Laurie, look, this Government taught<br />
Australia about economic change. I mean in the decade up to<br />
1983 there was no economic change in Australia. . It's this </p>
<p>Government which produced the economic change. It taught the<br />
press gallery about change; it encouraged the public into<br />
change; and now what's good for the system is the public's<br />
pushing the political system for change. Now, I want to keep<br />
that change going but now we're in the harder parts of the<br />
changes. We're past the big macro changes. We're into all<br />
these areas of the micro-economy wharves, ports, airlines,<br />
telecommunications where you're dealing with States; you're<br />
dealing with p) rivate companies. It's not just things which<br />
are in the Commonwealth exclusive realm. You're dealing with<br />
others so you can't do it as quickly. But I'm trying to do<br />
now things which induce a recovery, but at the same time<br />
provides a long term plan for Australia, that's actually a<br />
long term plan which means we've got to comprehend a lot of<br />
these issues, and to do it in six weeks is hard work that's<br />
going to be difficult to do and we're trying to beat the clock<br />
in a sense. Australia needs it; it needs it now and that's<br />
what I'm about and I mean this is the sort of inter regnum<br />
over Christmas and in the parliamentary period and things<br />
always go down a bit and the journos are always looking for a<br />
story a week and the answer is they can't have one.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Before we go into detail on domestic issues,<br />
you said on that Sunday program back in June that Australia<br />
had to have a better idea about the region we live in. You<br />
said we didn't pay enough attention to New Zealand and, more<br />
importantly, to Indonesia, and certainly not to Japan. Well<br />
now you're the Prime Minister what are you going to do about<br />
that situation?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well I hope a bit quite a bit. And I've<br />
already had the benefit of two very long discussions with<br />
President Bush about the Pacific. I've already put to him our<br />
view that we need a better political and institutional set of<br />
arrangements in the Pacific and the United States should be in<br />
them; that Japan should be playing a key role in trade<br />
liberalisation in the region and itself. And I'm also<br />
interesting myself in issues which affect us, such as New<br />
Zealand. </p>
<p>LAURIE OAKES: Are you going to visit Indonesia and Japan, for<br />
example? PAUL KEATING: I may well do, Laurie. I think if I for<br />
any visits I'll be having they'll be to the Asia-Pacific area<br />
before anywhere else. But my job at the moment is to focus on<br />
domestic issues and to get the domestic issues right.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: You're not going to make the ritual trek to<br />
Washington and the capitals of Europe? Wouldn't that be the<br />
normal thing for a new Prime Minister to do?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well, maybe, but I don't think In fact I've<br />
had the benefit of an American president coming here which<br />
is unusual for us and obviously saves me the time of going<br />
there in a useful exchange of information and views. So I<br />
won't be doing the northern hemisphere thing but I'd like to<br />
be doing the Asia-Pacific thing but I'll be doing the<br />
Australian thing first.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Prime Minister, we'll take a break there and<br />
get on to the detail of the economy in a moment.<br />
PAUL KEATING: Good, Laurie.<br />
( Short commercial break)<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Mr Keating, ACTU President, Martin Ferguson,<br />
says that when you deliver your statement on Wednesday<br />
fortnight you will be on the mat. Is that how you see it?<br />
PAUL KEATING: I don't think so, but I think if he means that<br />
there's an expectation that the Government will deliver a<br />
statement for a recovery and a longer run program of change<br />
for Australia, a plan for Australia, to that extent he's<br />
right. That is, not that we're on the mat but much will be<br />
required of us.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: But if it doesn't get a good reception you're<br />
just about dead politically, aren't you?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well I think it will, that's the point, because<br />
we are doing things to accelerate the recovery but at the same </p>
<p>time doing it the way which does provide a long term for this<br />
place; a plan for the long term. So we're not going just to<br />
have a big fiscal bang that goes up in a puff of expensive<br />
smoke but things we'll be doing will have a long run benefit<br />
and form integrated parts of a long term plan.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: How wide, how broad is it going to be? Is it a<br />
mini-budget in the sense that you'll be looking at pensions as<br />
well as things to create jobs?<br />
PAUL KEATING: It'll have a productive focus, Laurie. I mean<br />
the great need of Australia is to continue to lift its<br />
domestic capacity so it'll have a productive focus.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Does that include things like pension<br />
increases, though? Or will that have to wait until August?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Not necessarily, no, and---<br />
LAURIE OAKES: That won't have to wait?<br />
PAUL KEATING: No it doesn't not necessarily include them<br />
and they are things which more particularly are confined to<br />
budgets but the Cabinet hasn't completed its consideration of<br />
all these issues but I just say it will have a productive<br />
focus about it.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Just while we're on that. What's your view of<br />
welfare? Do you think there's room in a recessed economy for<br />
pension increases at the moment? Can they look forward to the<br />
Budget with some optimism?<br />
PAUL KEATING: This Government increased they extended<br />
increased outlays through the ' 80s which was quite strong but<br />
we had spending failing as a proportion of the total economy<br />
because the economy was growing so fast in the ' 80s. That's<br />
not to say we didn't spend and we spent Every spare dollar<br />
went in either tax cuts or transfer payments. So we lifted<br />
all of those social security benefits and payments and<br />
targeted the system. So we've now got a very closely targeted<br />
system, but as generously applied as fiscal policy in this<br />
country could permit, and I think that still remains our<br />
policy. We'd always like to be improving the system where we<br />
can but budgetary policy matters.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Well ' what about tax cuts? Could they be within </p>
<p>the scope of the statement? Or are they also budgetary<br />
matters? PAUL KEATING: There's a lot been said about them but what<br />
motivated the tax cuts in the past? The answer was<br />
inflation getting inflation down, reducing nominal wages<br />
growth in lieu of tax cut for inflation control, for<br />
inflation. We" ve now broken the back of Australian inflation..<br />
We've got a statistical rate of 1 and an underlying rate of<br />
about So we're down there with the best of them. So I<br />
think that the focus and the target now has to be inflation<br />
and everything else has to fit into that. I mean that's got<br />
to be maintained and we won't, for our part, be doing any<br />
inflation-wrecking, like Dr Hewson with his 15% tax on<br />
everything everyone spends goods and services. Having<br />
broken a 20-year problem we won't be letting that genie out of<br />
the bottle again. That is, we'll be trying to keep it there<br />
and wages our wages policy will be tailored to our policy<br />
on inflation. Tax cuts will simply fit into that context.<br />
Now, whether or not we provide tax cuts, whether or not they<br />
can be useful, what positions we take before the Commission,<br />
will be governed by one thing inflation.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: And when do you decide this? Negotiations are<br />
this week, aren't they, with the ACTU on that---<br />
PAUL KEATING: We're going to meet them in a week or so's<br />
time. LAURIE OAKES: So, is a wage-tax trade-off one of the options<br />
still? PAUL KEATING: It's an option but the primary option is<br />
maintenance of low inflation levels. There's got to be a sort<br />
of a change in attitudes here. In the ' 80s we were always<br />
about aggregate wages growth, aggregate wages growth,<br />
aggregate wages growth targets. Now we're about maintaining<br />
pinning that inflation number.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: There's been a lot of confusion about your<br />
wages policy, partly because of misreporting, I know, but I<br />
guess the key question is, ' Will the Government support an<br />
application for a general wage rise this year?'. </p>
<p>PAUL KEATING: Well, we'll see.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Bob Hawke committed the Government to do that,<br />
didn't he?<br />
PAUL KEATING: But I'm committing the Government to low<br />
inflation rates.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: So a Hawke commitment is not necessarily a<br />
Keating commitment?<br />
PAUL KEATING: It's subordinate to the commitment to low<br />
inflation subordinate to the commitment to low inflation.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: What about the speculation about a likely shake<br />
up in the aviation industry? That's caused more excitement<br />
than anything else, I think, in the run up to this statement.<br />
Are we going to see an open skies policy?<br />
PAUL KEATING: We're looking at options in aviation, Laurie,<br />
again, can I say, the first government in a quarter of a<br />
century to do so. But one thing we are determined about and<br />
that is Australians had a taste of deregulation with Compass.<br />
They had a taste of the low fares and they liked it because<br />
they had mobility which was formerly denied to them. Compass<br />
failed essentially because it was badly managed but one of the<br />
issues in that is ease of access of entry into competition..<br />
So one of the things we are looking at is the provision of<br />
common user terminals by the Commonwealth so that entrants are<br />
not carrying that burden and don't have to squeeze themselves<br />
into the Ansett or Australian terminals to start. In other<br />
words, they're in a competitive environment which is their<br />
own. Now, there's a line between where the Government's role<br />
in this starts and finishes and where the private sector role<br />
starts and fini. shes and we'd like to try and get that line<br />
right but at the same time we want to give Australians the<br />
benefit of the opportunity of competitive fares---<br />
LAURIE OAKES: And these would be new terminals?<br />
PAUL KEATING: New terminals. But not letting the two major<br />
airlines drift back into old habits of higher prices. In<br />
other words, with the competitor out of the way seeing the<br />
fare structure drift back up. We'd like to see room for<br />
competitors but obviously the Government can't be providing </p>
<p>competition. We can't have two, three, four airlines owned by<br />
the Government. That's not going to be on any more than<br />
trying to fix Compass's financial problems were on. But we<br />
can do things which make for ease of entry and ease of<br />
competition and competition will be important to us.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Does that mean you don't want Qantas running<br />
domestic services?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well that's another issue and that is on the<br />
big canvass of policy and that's something which, you know, we<br />
may or may not get around to.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: And will all this affect the privatisation of<br />
Australian and the partial privatisation of Qantas?<br />
PAUL KEATING: The whole environment matters because we've got<br />
these things up for sale. Obviously a bidder is going to say,<br />
' Look, what's on here? What's going to happen after the end<br />
of this year? What's the environment going to That's<br />
for Qantas and Australian and obviously that's on our mind,<br />
too. LAURIE OAKES: In the run up to the leadership challenge you<br />
promised Senator Rosemary Crowley that the Medicare co-payment<br />
would be dumped if you became Prime Minister. Now that's a<br />
Keating commitment., Are you going to stick to it?<br />
PAUL KEATING: My private views about this have been well<br />
known. Over the years, as Treasurer, I never supported copayments<br />
and I wouldn't have supported one in the Cabinet<br />
discussion but there is one and what I've said is we'll debate<br />
this properly in the Cabinet, and we will.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: But if you go into Cabinet and say, ' I want<br />
that dumped; it will be dumped' is that what you are going<br />
to do?<br />
PAUL KEATING: I don't think I should be saying to the Cabinet<br />
you must do this or must do that, but---<br />
LAURIE OAKES: You made a commitment.<br />
PAUL KEATING: But my position is that I don't believe the copayment<br />
was the right way to go.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: And you accept it if Cabinet takes a different<br />
view they make a liar of the new Prime Minister? </p>
<p>PAUL KEATING: Well, let's wait and see, Laurie. Let's wait<br />
and see. I mean, the Cabinet's sensible. They look at all<br />
these things. They've had some chance now to weigh up the way<br />
in which this is working and also to get a greater level of<br />
public reading. So let's wait and see.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Do you agree with some of those committed<br />
royalists, who've changed their mind recently, that this royal<br />
visit's going to cost too much money and it's a ridiculous<br />
extravagance in a recession?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Well, no I don't. The Queen is our Head of<br />
State. She visits here I suppose regularly, but in a sense<br />
irregularly, and I don't think those costs matter. Can I just<br />
say, from my part, this visit was arranged well before I<br />
became Prime Minister, anyway, but any request by the Queen<br />
for a visit would ordinarily be approved of by the Government.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: But it's $ 1.6 million that you could spend on<br />
helping the unemployed creating jobs in your economic<br />
statement. PAUL KEATING: But $ 1.6 million is not going to change the<br />
world and I don't really think that's an issue. I don't think<br />
it's an issue, Laurie.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: What's the ball park for you, looking at<br />
business representatives where some have told you the country<br />
can afford $ 2 billion to kick start the economy. Will you<br />
accept that figure?<br />
PAUL KEATING: We'll make our own judgment about it. We've<br />
been doing that in the 16 or 17 statements we've introduced<br />
since 1983. We've made our mind up about what we thought was<br />
appropriate and what we thought the Budget could stand and<br />
we'll come to the right figure. The public debate's<br />
interesting and it's always interesting and it's relevant.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Do you accept there's some concern about the $ 2<br />
billion figure on the money markets?<br />
PAUL KEATING: Oh;, there could be but I mean money markets are<br />
a bit smarter than I think the media gives them credit for.<br />
They've been around. We turn over $ 40 billion a day in the<br />
dollar. They're not bunnies. They've been around for </p>
<p>nearly a decade.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: We're just about out of time but I suppose the:<br />
overall question people want to know from Paul Keating is have<br />
you abandoned you level playing field philosophy? We've got a<br />
new interventionist Paul Keating who's put all that stuff<br />
behind him.<br />
PAUL KEATING: I just know it's a bit of the program about<br />
level playing field and clothing, textile and footwear. I<br />
mean there was nothing level about asking Australians to pay<br />
300% duty on shirts and 320% on shoes and the rest. The fact<br />
is let's get this clear there is no concept of a level<br />
playing field outside of Australia. Outside of Australia you<br />
just cross the low water mark it's catch as catch can<br />
everywhere. They all cheat. They all muck about. They all<br />
play favourites. But inside you're only cheating yourself if<br />
you run policies which have scarce national savings going to<br />
the wrong places. Now, what we've tried to do is make sure<br />
that our scarce savings go to the most productive places and<br />
the most productive places are not necessarily putting<br />
buttonholes on shirts or collars, which are highly labour<br />
intensive, where we're never going to be competitive, compared<br />
to a very productive place which can actually add to our<br />
national wealth employment in the current account.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Well what about the 30-xxx ( tape failure)<br />
jobs in textile, footwear and clothing industries?<br />
PAUL KEATING: This change was on from 1988. We had a vast<br />
rate of employment growth through the ' 80s. A lot of those<br />
people were taken up and hopefully they will be taken up<br />
again. At the moment we are in a recession but, again, now is<br />
not the time to change structural policy. So if you are<br />
asking me, which is really what you are saying, ' Is there any<br />
revisionism on the vision splendid?' which is to<br />
internationalise Australia emphatically, no, but---<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Mr Keating, we're out of time.<br />
PAUL KEATING: But let me say this, Laurie, that that's not to<br />
say that we are going to be taking an absolutely hard and fast<br />
attitude to every single issue that comes along; that where a </p>
<p>bit of latitude is important and useful that's what we'll be<br />
about. LAURIE OAKES: Thank you.<br />
PAUL KEATING: Thank you, Laurie.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Back to you, Jim.<br />
