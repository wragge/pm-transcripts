E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSION,<br />
NEW DELHI 8.30 28 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how would you assess the concept<br />
of Pierre Trudeau going to China now, given the fact that<br />
America and the Soviet Union have virtually cut off relations,<br />
particularly over the NIF?<br />
PM: They haven't cut off relations. In respect of one area<br />
discussions there has been a walk out on the NIF talks and<br />
that specifically related to the decision in regard to the<br />
Pershing and Cruise missiles. I think it's a good initiative.<br />
The heads of Commonwealth Governments have welcomed it. I<br />
think any attempt to open up discussions between the five nuclear<br />
powers makes sense and I see in this morning's press that the<br />
Soviets have indicated a preparedness to talk with him and he<br />
now has the support of the Commonwealth Heads of Government.<br />
If there is anything we can do to assist in that process, we will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has it taken on a greater importance in the last<br />
couple of days? Earlier on you described it as very ambitious.<br />
PM: Well it is still ambitious and Pierre recognises himself<br />
that it is ambitious. He is not saying that it will succeed.<br />
We will take the view that when you look at the issue involved<br />
that is the question of whether we are going to have nuclear<br />
war or not the possible , destruction of human civilisation as<br />
we know it then I think any effort is worthwhile.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, the Goa declaration is that just mere<br />
platit-udes, or what can it achieve?<br />
PM: Well, may I say just before, going to the Goa declaration<br />
specifically the actual Goa declaration dealing with international<br />
security matters generally is only one of the elements of the<br />
meeting at Goa and I guess in some senses you could say the<br />
least productive because it is a very general sort of statement.<br />
My main area of disappointment with the G~ oa decliration is the<br />
very passing, and by implication, reference to horizontal<br />
proliferation. There is an emphasis upon the issues of vertical<br />
proliferation by the major powers like the nuclear powers and I<br />
believe not sufficient attention is given to the at least in<br />
my judgement equal problem of the spread of nuclear weapons,<br />
but in the other areas of Cyprus and Grenada I think the Goa<br />
weekend has been particularly productive. / 2 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: send weapons to other Heads of Government<br />
and if so which ones, Mr. Hawke?<br />
PM: I made it in the discussions. When we were trying to<br />
irnalise the communique I made the point there and I was<br />
joined in it by Pierre Trudeau in particular that there<br />
wasn't sufficient spelling out of the question of horizontal<br />
proliferation and the dangers involved in that. What is there<br />
is as far as we were able to go.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why did you sign the document if<br />
you were so disappoinited in it.<br />
PM: I think it is an overstatement to say I am disappointed<br />
in it. What you've got to realize<br />
JOURNALIST: They were your words, Sir.<br />
PM: Well, disappointed about one particular issue, I said.<br />
T didn't talk about the document as a whole. You've got to<br />
understand that you are dealing with a range of people that<br />
cover aligned and non-aligned countries, developed and<br />
developing countries and from all the regions. Now, you are<br />
rather unreal if you start off in a context like that thinking<br />
that you're going to get great unanimity on every issue and I<br />
tend to think that given the composition of the meeting it<br />
went just about as far as it could go. My particular<br />
disappointment, however, as I say, is that I think there could<br />
with some degree of realism be more reference to the dangers<br />
posed to the future of the world by the possibility of the<br />
wider spread of nuclear weapons and I said that at the meeting<br />
and I repeat it now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, this meeting has involved a heck of<br />
a lot of time and a heck of a lot of money. Are these meetings<br />
really worth it?<br />
PM: I think so, but I think there is an argument for reducing<br />
the period of the meetings. I believe that if more preparations<br />
were done before the meeting that is with documents being<br />
circulated more specific documents being circulated. See,<br />
we had no specific documents before we got here. I think if<br />
that sort of thing were done, you could concertina the period.<br />
I believe that the meetings are worthwhile in two or three<br />
direct ways. Let me make it clear. The opportunity this is<br />
particularly so for me on the first occasion -of getting to know<br />
personally and quite intimately a range of leaders from all over<br />
the world is very useful. You can conduct sensible discussions<br />
with them in an environment like this which would be difficult<br />
elsewhere and in matters of particular importance to<br />
Australia. Secondly, I think on particular issues this meeting<br />
has been very useful and I cite Grenada. I don't think before<br />
you got here you would have expected, given the divergent views,<br />
from within the Caribbean states and certainly given the strength<br />
in the views of the African countries aqainst the action that<br />
took place, that you would have expected to get a joint<br />
communique in such mild termis as far as the past was concerned<br />
arid constructive as far as the future. Secondly, in regard to </p>
<p>Cyprus, I think the establishment of the working group of<br />
five nations including Australia, to work in association with<br />
the United Nations, does add some hope to the resolution of<br />
that issue, which of course is of particular interest to so<br />
many of us in Australia. So yes, I'm sorry for the length of the<br />
answer, but I think in those general terms and in regard to<br />
specific issues with which we've dealt, the meeting has been<br />
worthwhile. It has demonstrated the utility of the Commonwealth<br />
as an institution and of meetings within it. I repeat I think<br />
there is a case for shortening the meetings and a way of doing<br />
that is by more intensive preparatory work.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, have you been informed of the Victori an<br />
conference decision on uranium and do you believe that this is<br />
likely to undermine your own Government's uranium stance?<br />
PM: I'm not going to talk about those domestic issues here. I<br />
Riave read the cables.<br />
JOURANLIST: What was your response after you read them?<br />
PM: Well I say I'll wait till I get back to Australia to<br />
d-iscuss these, but I think you can see by my demeanour that<br />
I'm not terribly upset.<br />
JOURNALIST: You ' re still fairly relaxed about uranium then.<br />
PM: I don't think one should ever be relaxed about an issue<br />
11ike this. I repeat. You can see I don't look to be shedding<br />
any weight or sweating at the forehead or anything like that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: Come on, I'm not going into any detailed discussion about<br />
that. I can assure you that when I'm back in Australia I'll<br />
be prepared to talk about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, which countries resisted being more<br />
specific on horizontal proliferation and what were the main<br />
reasons they gave?<br />
PM: Well, there were not reasons spelt out. I think it's fair<br />
to say that India has a fairly strong position about this and<br />
about the NPT, but I don't think it's useful to go into<br />
specifics further than that about individual countries.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think there might be a slight touch of<br />
hypocr'isy about some of the Commonwealth nations that have<br />
come to the nuclear issue that is they want the super powers<br />
to scale down nuclear proliferation yet they want to retain<br />
their own right to develop nuclear arms?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not using the word hypocriLsy, but if you look<br />
ait the NPT it is based as they put it on a contract. The<br />
contract is that the powers that have a nuclear capacity will<br />
not proceed with further development and on that basis the<br />
non-possessors will niot seek to acquire and the argument of<br />
the non-possessors is that those whio have got it haven'tL kept<br />
to their part of the bargain, therefore, they are entitled niot<br />
to keep to theirs. Now, putt ing it in simpler termis that is </p>
<p>the exposition. Now, I think it is inadequate to approach<br />
it in that way. I simply make the point that while we've<br />
had an extraordinarily troubled world for the last nearly<br />
years when the world experienced the use of an atomic<br />
weapon, the balances that operate between the powers that<br />
have nuclear capacity and weaponry has operated to prevent<br />
its use. I am hopeful that the considerations involved in<br />
that would continue to produce that result. Now, I am much<br />
more apprehensive for the future of the world where more<br />
powers had nuclear weaponry. Now I don't need to name the<br />
powers involved, but I would think that the considerations<br />
which have operated, produced an absence of nuclear war<br />
between the majors, that those considerations are far less<br />
likely to apply when you do have a spread of nuclear weaponry<br />
and that is why I took the view and continue to hold the<br />
view that we should be at least as concerned about that issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, bearing in mind your preference for shorter<br />
CHOGMs, do you think there is a need for the regional meeting?<br />
PM: Well, Australia has expressed some doubt about those.<br />
It looks as though the matter is still to be discussed but,<br />
as I understand it, Michael Somare is going to be opening his<br />
new Parliament House next year and everyone who would be going<br />
to CHOGRM where it was supposed to be in New Guinea, would be<br />
there for that and I think there may be some attempt to bring<br />
the two things together have the people gathered together<br />
there for the opening and a short meeting in regard to CHOGRM.<br />
Now, that may make sense on this occasion, but I think we ought<br />
to direct attention to the question of the necessity or<br />
otherwise for the sort of regularity into the future. I have<br />
my doubts about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how would you describe the state<br />
of play now between the Soviet Union and the United States?<br />
Would you describe it as dangerous or getting more dangerous?<br />
PM: Well, I think it is fair to say that there has been an<br />
escalation of dangerous rhetoric and yes, I think it is fair to<br />
say that the position between the two major super powers is<br />
potentially more dangerous than it has been for some time, but<br />
I don't want to exaggerate that. The first Soviet indicated<br />
that if the United States, in cooperation with its European<br />
allies, went ahead by the end of 1983 with the station of<br />
the Cruise and Pershing missiles; then that they would withdraw.<br />
Now, having said so consistently and frequently that they would<br />
do that, it seemed to me inevitable that they would do it. I<br />
have the view that after a period of time the talks will<br />
resume. There is no suggestion that they are going to cut out<br />
communication and dialogue in other areas and so it is a pity<br />
tha the breakdown in the NIP talks has taken place, but I<br />
don't despair about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hlawke what was your talks with Mr. Trudeau<br />
about yesterday?<br />
PM: Well, there is a matter of this group of parliamentarians-<br />
!-don't know what they were actually called some groups from<br />
the United States came to sec me earlier in the year and they've </p>
<p>got some concept about parliamentarians for international<br />
peace I don't think that is the exact title of it and<br />
he was asking me all about that and we had a fairly<br />
common view about it that the concept sounded OK, but<br />
perhaps there were more immediate and practical things that<br />
we should be concerned with, but we weren't trying to<br />
completely douse them with cold water.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you talk about Peking?<br />
PM: Yes, I did have a talk with Mr. Trudeau about his visit<br />
to Peking. I wished him well and asked him to convey my<br />
best wishes to Premier Zhao, who I will be meeting myself<br />
within a matter of a few weeks. </p>
