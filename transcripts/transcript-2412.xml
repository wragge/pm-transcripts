COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
TheRt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
MINISTERS OF STATE BILL 1971<br />
Second Reading<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 29 April 1971]<br />
MINISTERS OF STATE BILL 1971<br />
Bill presented by Mr McMahon, and<br />
read a first time. Second Reading<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)<br />
( 2.15)-l move:<br />
That the Bill be now read a second time.<br />
The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary<br />
authority to increase the number<br />
of Ministers by 1. Section 65 of the Constitution,<br />
coupled with section 51, placitumn<br />
36, gives' to the Parliament, and to it<br />
alone, authority to vary the number of<br />
Ministers bf State. The additional Minister,<br />
which it is the purpose of the Ministers of<br />
State Bill to provide, will bring the number<br />
of Ministers of State approved by Parliament<br />
to 27. * Clause 4 of the Bill provides<br />
for payment at the rate applicable to<br />
Ministers not in the Cabinet.<br />
Three major considerations have led me<br />
to propose an increase in the number.<br />
Firstly, I want to allocate to a separate<br />
portfolio some important matters which<br />
could only otherwise be handled by a<br />
senior Minister by adding unduly to the<br />
responsibilities now imposed upon him. I<br />
am thinking particularly of the discharge<br />
of Commonwealth responsibilities in the<br />
fields of Aboriginal Affairs, the Arts and<br />
the Environment. Secondly, there are<br />
administrative advantages in placing with a<br />
single new Minister and Department a<br />
11948/ 71 group of specialised general service functions<br />
which have hitherto been attached to<br />
a number of departments. Thirdly, and in<br />
association with the creation of the new<br />
Department of the Prime Minister * and<br />
Cabinet, ' the additional Minister and<br />
Department will permit the Prime Minister<br />
to discharge more effectively * his main<br />
functions, which are leadership of the<br />
Government'' and administration of the<br />
Cabinet system.<br />
Before discussing these ma * tters further,<br />
I think it will assist honourable members if<br />
I list the functions which at . this stage will<br />
be under the administration of the new<br />
Minister. These are:<br />
1. Aboriginal affairs, including responsibility<br />
for the Council for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs and the Australian Institute of<br />
Aboriginal Studies.<br />
2. Activities relating to the environment,<br />
including icesponsibility for the Office of<br />
the Environment.<br />
3. Activities relating to the arts and letters,<br />
including responsibility for-<br />
Australian Council for the Arts<br />
Australian National Gallery<br />
Commonwealth Art Advisory Board<br />
Historic Memorials Committee<br />
Commonwealth Literary Fund<br />
Commonwealth Assistance to Australian<br />
Composers Advisory Board<br />
4. National Library of Australia.<br />
5. Commonwealth Archives Office. </p>
<p>6. Australian War Memorial.<br />
7. Anzac Agency, Commonwealth War<br />
Graves Commission.<br />
8. Activities relating to the production<br />
of Australian films, including responsibility<br />
for the Australian Film Development Corporation<br />
and the National Film and Television<br />
Training School.<br />
9. Grants to national organisations<br />
World expositions.<br />
11. National Radiation Advisory Committee.<br />
12. Certain general service functions,<br />
including responsibility for-<br />
Australian Government Publishing<br />
Service Government Printing Office<br />
Commonwealth Advertising Division<br />
Commonwealth Stores Supply<br />
and Tender Board<br />
I have decided that, in addition to these<br />
functions, administration of Commonwealth<br />
activities in the rapidly developing<br />
and increasingly important field of tourism,<br />
including the activities of the Tourist Commission,<br />
should be placed with the new<br />
Minister. Overall policy on matters relating<br />
to tourism will remain, as at present, with<br />
the Minister for Trade and Industry.<br />
For the past 3 years, as honourable<br />
members know, Senator Wright has been<br />
the Minister responsible for tourism under<br />
the Minister for Trade and Industry. He<br />
held thisi portfolio in addition to his other<br />
principal duties as Minister for Works. I<br />
take this opportunity to acknowledge the<br />
fine service he has given to the development<br />
of tourism during his term of office.<br />
He has been energetic, enthusiastic and<br />
effective in helping to create a new awareness<br />
in Australia. of the value of tourism<br />
and the great opportunities for its development<br />
on a national scale.<br />
Following a review by the departments<br />
concerned, we have also decided to establish<br />
an Overseas Property Bureau. The<br />
Bureau will be a specialist agency charged<br />
with a functional responsibility for the provision,<br />
management and maintenance of<br />
overseas land and property for Commonwealth<br />
. purposes. It will not detract from<br />
the responsibilities of other departments or<br />
Heads of Mission for the effective operation<br />
of overseas posts and will be assisted by an Advisory Overseas Property Committee<br />
composed of senior representatives<br />
of those departments. The operations of<br />
the Bureau will help departments and<br />
Heads of Mission to concentrate on their<br />
principal task of representation. Administration<br />
of the Bureau will be placed within<br />
the new Department, as an additional general<br />
service function for which the Minister<br />
will assume responsibility.<br />
The administration of Aboriginal affairs<br />
and of Commonwealth functions in the<br />
fields of the arts and the environment are<br />
among those to be transferred to the new<br />
Minister. It is the Government's view that<br />
it is now appropriate to separate these 3<br />
functions from the Prime Minister's own<br />
administration. As Prime Minister, I will<br />
continue to have a deep interest in them.<br />
But it is not necessary, for that purpose,<br />
that I remain the responsible Minister. I<br />
now mention briefly each of these 3 functions<br />
because of their importance in the<br />
new Ministry.<br />
The effect of the successful referendum<br />
in 1967 was to give the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament power to make laws in relation<br />
to the Aboriginals, as it already could for<br />
the people of any other race. Following<br />
the overwhelming vote of the people the<br />
then Prime Minister, Mr Holt, judged that<br />
initially the administration by the Commonwealth<br />
of Aboriginal Affairs should be<br />
within the Prime Minister's responsibility.<br />
A Council for Aboriginal Affairs was<br />
established and a Minister, though necessarily<br />
occupying another portfolio, was<br />
appointed Minister in Charge of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs under the Prime Minister. It now<br />
seems opportune to entrust this important<br />
responsibility to the new Minister, as one,<br />
of his major functions.<br />
As the welfare and development of<br />
Aboriginals affect more than one department,<br />
a ministerial committee will<br />
be appointed to study the special needs<br />
and problems of Aboriginals -and to<br />
advise ways of improving them. In<br />
this connection, I invite the attention<br />
of the House to the statement on Aborignal<br />
Affairs which the Minister for<br />
Social Services ( Mr Wentworth) read on<br />
my behalf at a recent meeting in Cairns of<br />
the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council,<br />
which is composed of Commonwealth and<br />
State Ministers responsible for Aboriginal </p>
<p>affairs. Furthermore, I want to acknowledge<br />
the energy and application of my colleague,<br />
the Minister for Social Services and<br />
the high worth of his contributions in his<br />
role as Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs over the last 3 years. He has established<br />
the portfolio for the Commonwealth<br />
and has contributed in large measure to<br />
the advancement of Australian Aboriginals.<br />
The Government will, of course, continue<br />
to get his counsel in Aboriginal matters<br />
and he will be a member of the ministerial<br />
committee which was referred to in the<br />
statement made by him ori my behalf last<br />
week at the Cairns conference of Ministers<br />
responsible for Aboriginal affairs.<br />
In the field of the arts, the Commonwealth<br />
is becoming increasingly involved<br />
and is giving assistance in a wide variety<br />
of forms. I have no doubt that this is<br />
widely welcomed. We ought to continue to<br />
develop in this field and we will. But the<br />
increasing variety of Commonwealth involvement<br />
again suggests that the time has<br />
arrived where the functions can be transferred<br />
to a new Minister. In addition to<br />
responsibility for the Council for the Arts,<br />
the new Minister will be responsible for<br />
the National Library, for the Australian<br />
National Gallery, and for assistance to<br />
Australian authors and composers. All<br />
these are related functions and can usefully<br />
be put in the charge of the one Minister.<br />
Then there is what has come to be<br />
called ' the environment'. An office to bring<br />
together and generally to superintend the<br />
Commonwealth's work and responsibilities<br />
in the environmental field is a new initiative,<br />
and an important one. Commonwealth<br />
activities in this field are beginning<br />
to gather momentum, and will need the<br />
attention of a Minister. Responsibility for<br />
them, too, may now with advantage be<br />
moved to the new Minister. Putting th ese<br />
proposals* in another way, the Commonwealth<br />
initiatives in Aboriginal affairs and<br />
the arts have now achieved a status and a<br />
level of activity that require separate<br />
administration. It has seemed desirable at<br />
the same time to add what will be a<br />
rapidly developing role in relation to the<br />
environment. The second main reason for creating the<br />
new portfolio is that there is a range of<br />
what might be termed ' general service' activities which are at present allocated<br />
among various departments. In each case<br />
the activities are not directly related to the<br />
primary purpose of those departments, but<br />
they have an important contribution to<br />
make to the effective functioning of the<br />
administration as a whole. Examples are<br />
the activities comprehended within the<br />
Australian Government Publishing Service,<br />
the Commonwealth Archives Office, preparation<br />
for world expositions and the new<br />
Overseas Property Bureau. Each of these<br />
functions involves the provision of services<br />
in important areas for all or a number of<br />
departments. The Government believes that<br />
locating them in the one department,<br />
under the control of one Minister, will<br />
yield significant advantage to the administration<br />
as a whole.<br />
The third main reason for creating the<br />
new portfolio is to permit the Prime<br />
Minister and * his Department to devote<br />
themselves to the matters which are central<br />
to Government. An examination of the<br />
history of the functions attached to the<br />
Prime Minister and his Department reveals<br />
a recurring theme of the detachment from<br />
the Prime Minister of new functions as<br />
they develop sufficient momentum to sustain<br />
a portfolio or department of their<br />
own, or as other opportunity for appropriate<br />
attachment arises. Thius in earlier days<br />
the Department of External Affairs and, in<br />
more recent times, the Department of<br />
Education and Science have been separated<br />
from the Prime Minister's Department. It<br />
is natural that, as initiatives are made and<br />
before they are fully proven, new ministerial<br />
and departmental arrangements should<br />
not be sought. But equally, once the<br />
significance of the new activities has been<br />
proved and accepted, it is appropriate that<br />
they be given separate ministerial and<br />
departmental status. Further than that, it is<br />
important that the Prime Minister, as leader<br />
of the Government, should be able to<br />
give a great deal of attention to the administration<br />
of the Cabinet system. Whatever<br />
other functions may come or go, the Prime<br />
Minister is Chairman of the Cabinet. It is<br />
his function to ensure that leadership is<br />
given; that there is effective co-ordination,<br />
through the Cabinet machinery and by<br />
individual consultation, of the activities of<br />
Ministers, each of whom has full responsibility<br />
and accountability to Parliament; and<br />
that, through the Cabinet machinery and </p>
<p>in other ways, the ever-changing problems<br />
of Government are given full attention and<br />
co-ordinated and speedy resolution.<br />
These are the central functions of the<br />
Prime Minister as leader of the Government,<br />
and he must look to his Department<br />
to give him support in them. It is these<br />
considerations that lie behind the creation<br />
of the new Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet. This Department<br />
will have administrative responsibility for<br />
the co-ordinating role of the Prime Minister<br />
and it will also be geared to give me<br />
advice on the demanding and ever-present<br />
preoccupations of the Government as a<br />
whole. These vary from day to day but<br />
range across such matters as the state of<br />
the economy, the Commonwealth's role in<br />
welfare, relations with the States-so<br />
important in a Federation-and external<br />
relations and defence. These are the<br />
administrative responsibilities of the Prime<br />
Minister as leader of the Government.<br />
When to these -are added the role of leadership<br />
in the Parliament, the duties as<br />
leader of a party, the requirements<br />
imposed as chief spokesman for the Government<br />
both in the Parliament and in<br />
public, and the many representational<br />
obligations that must be accepted, it can<br />
readily be seen that functions which are in<br />
the main administrative, or can be handled<br />
by another Minister and department,<br />
should where practicable be transferred to<br />
them. In short, I believe that the addition of a<br />
new ministerial portfolio to discharge the<br />
functions I have outlined represents a<br />
significant advance in the organisation of<br />
the functions of government. There will be<br />
renewed emphasis upon the importance the<br />
Government attaches to three different<br />
groups of responsibilities-in Aboriginal<br />
Affairs; in the arts; and in the environment.<br />
In each of these the Commonwealth<br />
is increasingly assuming a role in community<br />
affairs at the national level. There will<br />
also be a useful concentration under single<br />
control of a number of ' general service'<br />
activities having a functional or administrative<br />
affinity. By making these changes,<br />
the Prime Minister and his Department<br />
will be released to discharge more effectively<br />
their primary functions. And the<br />
lines of responsibility to the Parliament for<br />
the various functions will be clarified. T<br />
commend the Bill to the House. Debate ( on motion by Mr Whitlam)<br />
adjourned. APPOINTMENT OF ASSISTANT<br />
MINISTERS<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)-<br />
by leave--In association with the<br />
Ministers of State Bill, I wish also to<br />
inform the House of my intention to<br />
appoint Assistant Ministers to support certain<br />
Senior Ministers in the discharge of<br />
their responsibilities. Honourable members<br />
will recall that, since the earliest days of<br />
Federation, Assistant Ministers, Honorary<br />
Ministers or Ministers without Portfolio<br />
have been a recurring feature of ministerial<br />
arrangements. These Assistant Ministers-<br />
I use that term to describe all the<br />
persons I have just referred to-are not<br />
Ministers of State in the strict Constitutional<br />
sense. The Queen's Ministers of<br />
State are, under section 64 of the Constitution,<br />
only those members of the Executive<br />
Council who are appointed to administer<br />
Departments of State. The Assistant Ministers<br />
will be members of the Parliament<br />
who are appointed to assist a particular<br />
Minister in the discharge of his duties.<br />
Because they are not Ministers of State<br />
in the constitutional sense, section 44 of<br />
the Constitution precludes the payment of<br />
any salary to Assistant Ministers in respect<br />
of their duties. All it will be possible to do<br />
will be to make payments to them to meet<br />
out-of-pocket expenses, including travelling<br />
expenses, which they necessarily incur in<br />
the performance of their duties. I intend<br />
that the Assistant Ministers will be sworn<br />
as Executive Councillors. They will thus<br />
form part of the Federal Executive Council<br />
whose function, under section 62 of the<br />
Constitution, is to advise the Governor-<br />
General in the government of the Commonwealth.<br />
The Assistant Ministers will<br />
thus participate in a most important aspect<br />
of the continuing good government of the<br />
Commonwealth. As members of the Federal<br />
Executive Council, the Assistant<br />
Ministers will in general be able to exercise<br />
statutory functions of the Ministers they<br />
are assisting-including the making of<br />
appointments and the performance of<br />
other functions expressly conferred on the<br />
Minister-provided he has authorised them </p>
<p>to this effect. This is made possible by section<br />
19 of the Acts Interpretation Act<br />
which, subject to any contrary intention in<br />
the particular legislation, permits any<br />
Minister or member of the Federal Executive<br />
Council to act for and on behalf of a<br />
Minister referred to in the legislation.<br />
Thus Assistant Ministers will be able to<br />
make appointments and perform other<br />
functions expressly conferred on the Minister<br />
by legislation.<br />
The Assistant Ministers will be assigned<br />
to assist certain Ministers of Cabinet rank,<br />
who have the responsibility, not only of<br />
administering their own departments, but<br />
of taking part in the continuing process of<br />
consultation which is an essential feature<br />
of effective Cabinet government. By<br />
appointing Assistant Ministers in this way I<br />
see the system of Cabinet government as<br />
being strengthened through allowing senior<br />
Ministers to give more time to Cabinet<br />
business. Assistant Ministers will, of<br />
course, work in accordance with the<br />
authority given to them by the Senior<br />
Minister. I see them, within this general<br />
authority, as conducting correspondence<br />
and making inquiries on his behalf. They<br />
will also be able to receive deputations on<br />
behalf of the Minister. I emphasise that<br />
Assistant Ministers will not be able to take<br />
political responsibility in the administration<br />
of any department. This is as it should be.<br />
As Prime Minister Menzies explained in<br />
his ministerial statement on Parliamentary<br />
Under-Secretaries on 27th August 1952, it<br />
is important that Ministers should be<br />
directly answerable to the Parliament for<br />
the administration of their departments.<br />
Again taking up what Sir Robert Menzies<br />
said in that statement, there are<br />
occasions when it would be of great assistance<br />
to a Minister if his Assistant Minister<br />
could, during the Committee stages of<br />
a Bill, sit at the table of the House and<br />
represent his Minister in the discussion of<br />
clauses and amendments as they arise. I<br />
shall be consulting with the Presiding<br />
Officers on this matter to ascertain<br />
whether, to achieve this, an amendment of<br />
Standing Orders will be necessary. Numhers of those who in times past held office<br />
as Assistant Ministers were in due course<br />
elevated to full Ministerial status. I believe<br />
that the experience they obtained as Assistant<br />
Ministers was of great value in preparing<br />
them to assume full Ministerial<br />
status. I am confident that those who will<br />
be appointed to the new positions will<br />
obtain valuable and broadening experience.<br />
To sum up, the new Assistant Ministers<br />
will bring greatly needed assistance to<br />
senior Ministers in the discharge of their<br />
heavy duties, and will contribute to the<br />
better working of the Cabinet system.<br />
Secondly, they will help such Ministers to<br />
achieve more effective supervision of the<br />
activities of the departments to which they<br />
are related. Finally they will, as I have<br />
mentioned, provide important experience<br />
for members from this side of the House<br />
in both the legislative and administrative<br />
fields. I do not intend at this stage to make<br />
specific appointments to the office of Assistant<br />
Minister. These will be left until the<br />
parliamentary recess, when there will be<br />
opportunity to give further consideration<br />
to details of the way in which the Assistant<br />
* Ministers will work and to select members<br />
for the positions. I make the statement at<br />
this stage partly to acquaint the House of<br />
events that will take place before it meets<br />
for the Budget session, and also because<br />
the decision to appoint Assistant Ministers<br />
needs to be seen in the full context of<br />
other changes being made in administrative<br />
arrangements, including particularly the<br />
proposal to appoint an additional Minister<br />
of State. I present the following paper:<br />
Appointment of Assistant Ministers-Ministerial<br />
Statement, 29th April 1971.<br />
Motion ( by Mr Swartz) proposed:<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
Mr WhItiam-May I suggest that this<br />
matter and the Ministers of State Bill be<br />
the subject of a cognate debate in due<br />
course. Mr McMahon-I will agree to that<br />
course being followed.<br />
