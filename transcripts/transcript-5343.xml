PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY PETER HARVEY, CHANNEL 9<br />
( ON FUNDING FOR INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS)<br />
Harvey Prime Minister, how much funding goes from Government into<br />
. independent schools?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A good deal. For independent schools the recurrent payments<br />
vary from about 16% or 17% to 34% or 35% of the cost of<br />
educating children in Government schools. In one sense, it is<br />
cheap so far as the taxpayer is concerned. But the funding is<br />
very significant for independent schools. It is not generally<br />
realised that in recent years Government schools have passed<br />
the resource levels that the Schools Commission thought were<br />
necessary and desirable as minimum objectives. But a very<br />
large part of the independent school system has not reached<br />
those resource levels. In that sense, independent sectors,<br />
at least in physical resources, 1 tha-t is the deprived sector<br />
of education. So funding from Governments, from Commonwealth<br />
and State Governments, is terribly important to the system.<br />
Without it, a large part of it could not and would not survive.<br />
Harvey If this current legal action succeeds, do you see Constitutional<br />
change as essential?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, like all litigants, we hope to win. Then there will be<br />
no problem. If we did not win, there would need to be<br />
discussions, probably with the States, with the Schools Authorities.<br />
You would need to look very carefully at the judgement to see<br />
what it was appropriate to do and what it was not: what could<br />
be done and what could not be. What I have said, if it is<br />
necessary, if it is only way that it could be done, we would be<br />
prepared to face a constitutional amendment over the issue.<br />
Now, against the background in which all political parties<br />
support funding for independent schools, in which all State<br />
Governments support funding for independent schools, I would have<br />
thought it should be possible to devise an amendment that everyone<br />
would be supporting, certainly all political parties and all<br />
Governments. But I do not think that it is the desirable course,<br />
I think it is a last resort course, but one we would not flinch<br />
from if it was the only way of achieving support for the<br />
independent system. 000-</p>
