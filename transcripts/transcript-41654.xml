    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government will provide funding to support the mental health of farmers, mining workers and Indigenous Australians living in rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>Two counselling organisations, Aussie Helpers and Rural and Remote Mental Health, would each receive $1 million to further support the mental health of people living in the bush.</p>
<p>The $2 million investment will assist the organisations to deliver a range of mental health support programs including suicide-prevention measures.</p>
<p>This investment will enable Aussie Helpers, in partnership with Virtual Psychologist, and Rural and Remote Mental Health, to provide more support for people living and working in country communities.</p>
<p>Aussie Helpers’ Virtual Psychologist is a great example of an organisation utilising modern technology to overcome long distances. It provides a 24-hour SMS and phone counselling service for rural and remote communities as well as advice and referral service for local practitioners.</p>
<p>Rural and Remote Mental Health’s initiatives include tailored support for the agricultural and mining sectors as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</p>
<p>Importantly, like the Virtual Psychologist program, Rural and Remote Mental Health’s programs are backed up by a strong online presence and telephone support available 24-7.</p>
<p>Mental illness does not discriminate and it is estimated that nearly half of all Australians will experience mental illness in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government committed to investing in the mental health of all Australians including people living in regional, rural and remote Australia.</p>
<p>The 2018-19 Federal Budget included an additional $338.1 million for mental health funding.</p>
