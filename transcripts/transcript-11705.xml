<p> Well thank you very much Barry. To you Mr Mayor, to my parliamentary</p>
<p> colleagues, Senator Grant Chapman and Senator Alan Ferguson, and to Mr</p>
<p> Graham Gunn, the local State member, ladies and gentlemen. First of all</p>
<p> may I thank the Mayor for his warm words of welcome. This is certainly</p>
<p> the first time that I've visited Quorn. If it's the first time</p>
<p> that a Prime Minister has visited Quorn then I feel doubly privileged</p>
<p> to be amongst you.</p>
<p>I want to say you very quickly and very simply that my visit here this</p>
<p> morning is part of a week long visit that paying to rural and regional</p>
<p> areas of Australia. Not to learn for the first time of some of the difficulties</p>
<p> that you face, but perhaps to learn in a little more detail of some of</p>
<p> the particular challenges that you face. I heard some of them from the</p>
<p> Mayor a moment ago and I'll no doubt hear more as I move amongst</p>
<p> you after I've finished my speech.</p>
<p>At present Australia at a national level is enjoying a fair amount of</p>
<p> economic prosperity. Our general economy is very strong, out budget is</p>
<p> in surplus, our inflation rates are low, our interest rates are low, our</p>
<p> business investment is high. But unfortunately not every part of the country</p>
<p> is sharing in the same degree that general economic strength and that</p>
<p> general economic bounty. And I'm acutely aware of the fact that through</p>
<p> no fault of many communities in Australia, through adverse climatic circumstances,</p>
<p> perverse world markets, the unfair trading practices of the European Union,</p>
<p> and in some areas of the United States, you are not getting the returns</p>
<p> that you deserve. Through a long term decline in other commodity prices</p>
<p> some of the traditional industries of this country, particularly wool,</p>
<p> have been placed under a great deal of strain. And that has had a compounding</p>
<p> affect on local communities and services have been withdrawn from some</p>
<p> towns, although I was pleased to hear from the Mayor that the service</p>
<p> level in this particular community remains very strong.</p>
<p>Now I don't come to you today saying that I've got an answer,</p>
<p> that I've got a magic wand. I'm not good enough that I don't</p>
<p> think any Prime Minister of this country would ever be good enough to</p>
<p> turn around long term changes in world commodity prices. But any Prime</p>
<p> Minister of this country worth his or her salt should first and foremost</p>
<p> understand and acknowledge that there are particular challenges and difficulties</p>
<p> and areas of disadvantage in some parts of the country. My obligation</p>
<p> to you is to better understand your problem and to try and work out ways</p>
<p> in which we can provide some assistance. I can't as I say turn around</p>
<p> commodity prices, I can't change the seasons, but I can ensure that</p>
<p> there is maintained at a federal government level a proper level of government</p>
<p> services.</p>
<p>We can assist in cooperation with the State government in identifying</p>
<p> new areas of economic activity that you may as a community be able to</p>
<p> undertake in order to supplement or replace some of the other areas that</p>
<p> are no longer as viable and as profitable. And in that context I'm</p>
<p> pleased to announce this morning that the federal government will out</p>
<p> of its rural program fund up to the tune of $200,000 a study of alternative</p>
<p> economic activities which may be of benefit to this community. I understand</p>
<p> that that program is going to be augmented with funds from the South Australian</p>
<p> government and I discussed that this morning in very positive terms with</p>
<p> Mr Rob Kerin the acting Premier of South Australia before I left Port</p>
<p> Lincoln. Now that is designed to see if there are areas in which new economic</p>
<p> activity and new economic endeavor can be embraced which may be of longer-term</p>
<p> benefit to this community. I can also confirm to you that the application</p>
<p> being made by some of the areas in this region for emergency assistance,</p>
<p> that the assessment of that has been completed and the recommendation</p>
<p> will be going to the Agriculture Minister Mr Warren Truss in the very</p>
<p> near future, and he'll be giving a response and making an announcement</p>
<p> in relation to that.</p>
<p>I can also assure you that not only here but as I go around other parts</p>
<p> of the Australian bush around regional Australia, I'll be giving</p>
<p> assurances about the government's commitment to the maintenance of</p>
<p> existing service levels at the instance of the Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p> And while it may not be of a particular concern to this community I know</p>
<p> that in many rural communities of Australia the inadequacy of.....the</p>
<p> inadequate numbers, not the inadequacies of the individuals, but the inadequate</p>
<p> numbers of general practitioners and medical services generally is an</p>
<p> issue of particular concern. And I want to say that I can understand the</p>
<p> frustration of country people who have every right to have available to</p>
<p> them both accessible and reasonable affordable medical services in the</p>
<p> same way as your fellow Australians who live in the metropolitan areas</p>
<p> of Australia.</p>
<p>Of course in acknowledging some of the challenges that exist in particular</p>
<p> communities I don't for a moment gainsay the fact that there are</p>
<p> many areas of rural Australia where there is a source of hope and optimism.</p>
<p> And that a lot of the regional areas of this country are doing well and</p>
<p> there are a lot of benefits that are flowing through from the economic</p>
<p> reforms of the government. And I can't let the opportunity go by</p>
<p> without commending to you the benefits for rural Australia of the new</p>
<p> taxation system that is going to come into operation on the 1st</p>
<p> of July. Amongst other things that new taxation system will dramatically</p>
<p> reduce the price of fuel in rural and regional Australia. And therefore</p>
<p> because many farmers rely so heavily on export income, in fact many of</p>
<p> them overwhelmingly, indeed exclusively on export income, it will lead</p>
<p> to a reduction in the price of those, the cost involved in those exports,</p>
<p> and therefore be of long term benefit to rural Australia.</p>
<p>This taxation reform plan will be of great benefit to the Australia economy.</p>
<p> It will not only deliver cheaper fuel and cheaper business costs, but</p>
<p> also will reduce the cost of exports and will also of course be of great</p>
<p> benefit in relation to the personal income tax cuts that are involved</p>
<p> And also as part of the business tax reform plan the reductions in capital</p>
<p> gains tax, the reductions in company tax, the increases in family benefits,</p>
<p> and the increases in pensions and benefits for people who are retired</p>
<p> from the working force. So I wouldn't want to let the opportunity</p>
<p> go by without saying that this is a reform that the government committed</p>
<p> itself to because it believed very very strongly, very very strongly indeed</p>
<p> that this country needed a new modern more progressive taxation system.</p>
<p>The last thing that I do wish to say to you of particular policy relevance</p>
<p> is that I know how important the provision of infrastructure in rural</p>
<p> Australia is. To have not only adequate roads but adequate telecommunications,</p>
<p> adequate information technology facilities, and to have all the other</p>
<p> infrastructure which is the basic obligation of the government, some times</p>
<p> in partnership with the private sector to provide, and that is something</p>
<p> that all people in the Australia community are entitled to have and are</p>
<p> entitled to expect. And in the speech I made on Friday in Melbourne outlining</p>
<p> the government's plans for the next year I linked the sale of the</p>
<p> rest of Telstra, which I know is criticised in some sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community, with the acceleration of additional infrastructure provision</p>
<p> in our Australian community. And to me it makes increasingly less sense</p>
<p> to tie up billions of dollars of public investment in a telecommunications</p>
<p> company when those billions of dollars of public investment could be released</p>
<p> to facilitate a faster rate of investment in the provision of government</p>
<p> infrastructure in particularly, but not only in rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p> And I leave that thought with you Â does it make more sense to invest</p>
<p> those billions of dollars of public money in a telecommunications company</p>
<p> rather than to release them to facilitate the investment at a faster rate</p>
<p> of additional government resources in the provision of much needed infrastructure,</p>
<p> not only but including information technology.</p>
<p>My final word to you is to make and repeat a commitment I've made</p>
<p> many times since becoming Prime Minister to people in rural and regional</p>
<p> Australia. Part of the Australian story, part of the Australian inheritance,</p>
<p> part of what we think of ourselves as being as Australians, is of course</p>
<p> the inheritance of the Australian bush, of rural Australia. And without</p>
<p> the preservation of that not only as a viable economic part of our community</p>
<p> and a massive contributor to our export income. But also as part of the</p>
<p> social make up and the very essence and psyche of our community, the preservation</p>
<p> of that is indispensable for the continuation of the kind of Australia</p>
<p> that I grew up to love as a child and the kind of Australia that all of</p>
<p> us wherever we may live in our country they love. And therefore it's</p>
<p> a very important thing for me personally, as well as in a political dimension</p>
<p> with my obligations as Prime Minister to do everything I can during my</p>
<p> time as Prime Minister to try and ensure that people living in the bush,</p>
<p> living in the regions enjoy as best and as fairly as can be the case,</p>
<p> the benefits of national economic strength. We can't and I don't</p>
<p> pretend that I can solve all of the problems, but I do understand that</p>
<p> they exist. I will do my best not only here but also around Australia</p>
<p> to better learn about them to better understand them, and to better communicate</p>
<p> to my colleagues some of the challenges that you face, and this morning</p>
<p> is an opportunity as your guest to meet you, to learn a little more of</p>
<p> your life here and I hope in a small way to make a contribution where</p>
<p> I can to improving the situation for you. Thank you very much for coming.</p>
