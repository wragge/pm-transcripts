    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia opposes the death penalty at home and abroad.</p>
<p>While Australia respects Indonesiaâs sovereignty, we are asking that Indonesia reconsider its decision to execute two Australian citizens. Â </p>
<p>The government has made representations at the highest levels.Â </p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Minister and I have both made representations to our Indonesian counterparts and are continuing to make every possible effort through the most effective channels to stop Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan being executed.</p>
<p>The Opposition has been fully briefed on our efforts and I thank them for their cooperation. This is appropriate as it is a matter that has spanned five governments.</p>
<p>This is an unimaginably difficult time for the families of these young men. I spoke with both families today and will ensure that the government continues to support them.</p>
<p>Both men are reformed characters and both have helped to rehabilitate other prisoners.</p>
<p>The prerogative of mercy should be extended to them.</p>
<p>In the best interests of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, the government will not make further public comments but I want to assure Australians that our support will continue.</p>
<p>23 January 2015</p>
