THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY AM PROGRAMME<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
KELLY: Prime Minister, the $ 1 billion federation fund, what kind of projects do you have in mind for that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Big projects that involve jobs, projects that will strengthen the national infrastructure of Australia.<br />
I don't intend to have the money flittered away on a hundred obelisks commemorating federation<br />
they're nice but somebody else can raise the money for them. This is a big project fund and I'll be<br />
talking to the State Premiers and the Chief Ministers to get their views. We are using some of the<br />
money for the National Museum in Canberra. Now, that's an important national project and that<br />
will help the people of Canberra. I'll be writing to all the Premiers in the next few days seeking<br />
their views. No doubt they'll have plenty of views and I understand that and I'll be happy to talk to<br />
them. At the end of the day of course I and my colleagues will decide on the projects on which the<br />
money is spent.<br />
KELLY: Well the Democrats and others have immediately labelled it a slush fund.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Gee, they are really clever aren't they? They are saying all the time that we've got to do things to<br />
generate jobs. Nothing generates jobs more than activity. And this is about infrastructure activity<br />
and they're bellyaching about it. I mean you can't please them can you.<br />
KELLY: It's described in one paper as the Government describing it as being available for one major, one<br />
significant project in each State supported by smaller projects in regional areas. I mean that does<br />
ring ' whiteboard' bells, doesn't it?.<br />
PRIAM MINISTER:<br />
Well, I tell you what it won't be that. It will primarily be about big projects, big projects involve<br />
small amounts of work in different areas. And that's what that statement had in mind. This should<br />
be seen very much as providing opportunities for job generation in the regions of Australia. Not<br />
everything will be in the regions but there'll certainly be a lot in the region and it is about job<br />
generation. It is about major projects that will be valuable for decades into the future and it is<br />
appropriate that it be called a federation fund and it's appropriate that it reach its peak when we<br />
celebrate the Centenary of Federation.<br />
KELLY: If it's about job creation, why not get it going now? Why wait a year or so before projects are even<br />
announced? </p>
<p>PRIME MIINISTER:<br />
Well there are other measures in the Budget that are helping job generation., and it's a question...<br />
KELLY: What are those measures?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the very fact that we have turned around a $ 10.8 billion deficit and by year 3 of our first<br />
term, at the end of our first term we will have created a surplus of $ 1.6 billion. Now that is a<br />
magnificent achievement by any measure. We inherited a $ 10.5 billion deficit, all the work of our<br />
predecessors and we're going to have a surplus of $ 1.6 billion. This year, this coming financial<br />
year, we will repay more than $ 5 billion of Mr Keating's debt, $ 5 billion will be repaid. We will<br />
not be a net borrower. All of that exerts fuirther downward pressure on the conditions that affect<br />
interest rates. Now I make no prediction about interest rates. I make no calls about what should<br />
happen. That is a matter for the monetary authorities. But what the Government has done is<br />
deliver on its side of the monetary equation, the Government has taken pressure off interest rates by<br />
cutting the deficit. The Government has repaid massive amounts of the debts of the Australian<br />
people accumulated by the previous government. Nothing can I say to you Fran is more calculated<br />
to lay the foundation of a very sound fuiture. And don't let our opponents come along and say it<br />
would have happened if they'd been in office. They opposed the sale of Telstra which is one of the<br />
methods whereby we have brought about this massive debt reduction. So this is very much a<br />
Budget that lays the foundation for a sound 2 1st century for Australia because what it has done is to<br />
tackle this cycle of deficit and debt. I'm able to say to you this morning that in 1995 our debt to<br />
GDP ratio was just under 20 per cent. By the year 2000 it will be 10 per cent. Amongst the OECD<br />
countries in 1996 we have a debt level now which is lower than the average of the OECD. Now<br />
that is a huge turnaround.<br />
KELLY: With respect though Prime Minister, there has been the Coalition's strategy, debt reduction strategy<br />
has worked on a massive scale but much of that was in last year's Budget. This Budget only makes<br />
a small contribution to cuts, $ 330 million.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, that is, that is not true. But the important thing is whether you do the job. Now the first<br />
job of a new government is to fix the nation's finances and they were in a mess when we came into<br />
power. $ 10.5 billion of deficit and by the end of our first term, and people sneered at us when we<br />
said we'd do it, the Opposition has variously sneered at us or said it was unnecessary. I don't know<br />
they're going to say now. It'll be very interesting. The fact is we have turned it around and we<br />
have done it in a fair way. We have done it at the same time that we have kept our promises. We<br />
gave a $ 1 billion tax package. We're giving $ 600 million of tax relief for people who take out<br />
private health insurance.<br />
KELLY: But that was last year's Budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Why do you say last year? I'm sorry, it comes into operation on the 1st of July. I mean the<br />
important thing is whether you get to your, to the place on the hill. It is whether you get to your<br />
goal. It's not whether you do two-thirds of it in the first year and a third in the second year. With<br />
great respect, that is a silly argument. The important thing is whether you do the job, whether you<br />
get there. And the combination of our budgets in our first term will be that we have turned the </p>
<p>finances of this country around from a $ 10.5 billion deficit to a $ 1.6 billion surplus. We've kept<br />
our promises. We have delivered our family tax initiative. We're delivering capital gains tax relief<br />
to small business. We've seen interest rates fall by We've seen inflation kept at a very low<br />
level. And we are building for the future with a federation fund that is going to renew the<br />
important infrastructure of this country. Now, that is building for the future on a massive scale.<br />
KELLY:<br />
Are you disappointed then that media commentators and others have welcomed this... . or described<br />
this budget today as cautious, that the financial markets haven't welcomed it they say that it's<br />
dampened expectations of a ratings upgrade that business hasn't exactly sort of embraced it?<br />
PRIME M[ NISTER:<br />
Well I don't know who you're reading. I mean, you know...<br />
KELLY: Well, I've read all the papers and I've read a wad of press releases.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you couldn't have read Terry McCrann for example.<br />
KELLY:<br />
No, but I did read I didn't read Terry McCrann's article but I read a lot of others.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, well I think you should. I mean, he's got more readers than, he's got more readers than most<br />
of the other financial writers might...<br />
KELLY:<br />
You've got to perceive there's a lot of front page articles describing you as cautious.<br />
PIME MINISTER:<br />
No, well hang on, hang on Fran, I mean, you made the point. Let me say, Peter Costello has<br />
decisively buried the Keating legacy in more ways than one with a very good budget. It<br />
consolidates our nation's finances around a smaller government dynamic. Importantly, not a slash<br />
and burn and bash the small or smaller government, but one that seeks to make government work<br />
better, delivering the same services more efficiently or cheaply. Now, I think that is a very accurate<br />
description of this budget and you will find across the board there is a recognition of a job well<br />
done. Of course some people will always argue that you should go further. There are always<br />
people who are, no matter how high you jump, they will put the high jump bar up a little higher and<br />
say you've failed unless you jump that extra distance. Now, I know that, that's always happened.<br />
It's my job and the job of the Treasurer to set the balance, to make the judgement of what is the<br />
right trade-off between the economic demands of the country and our concern about the impact of<br />
economic measures on different sections of the community and we have got that balance right. We<br />
are giving massive incentives for people to save. For the first time in federation a government has<br />
given a genuine tax break for savings. It's not a mealy-mouth, restricted, limited, hamstrung break.<br />
It's right across the board, all forms of savings from all forms of investment including, I might say,<br />
personal contributions to superannuation on which no prior tax break has been received by the<br />
contributor. Now, that is a very valuable incentive. We're not discriminating against one form of<br />
saving in favour of another. This is the first time anybody has done anything comprehensive about<br />
that and I think that will be seen particularly by self-funded retirees as a very long overdue reform. </p>
<p>KELLY: Indeed obviously it is a big boost for self-funided retirees. It's a big boost for people who are able<br />
to make big superannuation contributions...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And may I say Fran that self-funded retirees are the one section of the population who, if I can put<br />
it this way, are the poor relations of lower interest rates. The rest of the community think lower<br />
interest rates are a great idea. People who are on fixed incomes, the retired section of the<br />
community, sometimes wonder because it directly affects their income. And therefore some<br />
recognition of the particular position of self-fuinded retirees and of retired people generally was<br />
needed because the Keating L-A-W law plan completely ignored them. Keating's plan was to<br />
reward only the people who were in the workforce and that was particularly discriminatory against<br />
many women and particularly discriminatory against retired people. The Howard-Costello plan is a<br />
tax break right across the board, all forms of saving, all forms of investment including<br />
superannuation, a contribution to the individual. In that sense it's a more balanced, fair measure<br />
that doesn't discriminate against different sections of the Australian community.<br />
KELLY: Prime Minister we're going to run out of time but I must come to jobs. Jobs was always going to<br />
be the big test for this budget. But the Treasurer described the predicted growth in this budget,<br />
three and three quarter percent, as exceptional growth. Now, is it exceptional growth? It's not that<br />
much more than forecast last time and in the last 12 months you didn't manage to shift<br />
unemployment at all...<br />
PRVVME MINISTER:<br />
Well unemployment is predicted, at the financial year starting the 1st of July, is predicted to have<br />
fallen to around<br />
KELLY:<br />
( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hang on, hang on, just remember that we inherited a level which had been deep seated around<br />
and had gone to 11% when Mr Beazley was the Minister for Employment in the former<br />
government. So let us just understand one fuindamental thing. Our critics, the Opposition, had 13<br />
years. They pushed unemployment to 11%. They left us with It was deeply embedded in<br />
the Australian economy and it will take time to remove. And everybody who understands anything<br />
about the economy of this country knows that employment is the last indicator to come right when<br />
things get better. Now we have laid the foundation. We've freed the labour market. I'm very<br />
disappointed that the Labor Party is going to oppose our unfair dismissal provisions. And in doing<br />
so, they are actually destroying the job prospects of thousands of young Australians and they are<br />
maintaining an unreasonable burden on those thousands of small businessmen and women who are<br />
the main vehicles through which job generation will occur. The Labor Party has no credibility to<br />
criticise us on unemployment while it continues to stop us getting rid of Laurie Brereton's stupid<br />
job destroying unfair dismissal law, no credibility at all. Because that even the Labor Premier of<br />
New South Wales, Bob Carr, admits that that particular measure has damaged the job prospects of<br />
thousands of young Australians and it's sheer hypocrisy of Labor to talk about unemployment when<br />
they won't even support that attempt by us to help small business employ young Australians. </p>
<p>KELLY: Well, Mr Howard, one final question. I mean, a week ago you said that this budget would help lift<br />
the fog, the fog that is enveloping your backbench and others in some kind of criticism of your<br />
leadership. Is there enough, or what is it here that will lift the fog in terms of jobs, instead of<br />
spending boost for regional Australia, that will promise the job security to counter the attraction of<br />
Pauline Hanson, persuade them to forget about Wik where is it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's an extraordinary interpretation of what I actually said Fran. What I said, that any stage of a<br />
government's life, when you get preoccupied with budgets and other things, you tend to appear off<br />
the central message of concern to the electorate. I have no doubt at all that this budget will be seen<br />
as a budget that addressed the future. It's a budget that has got the fundamentals of the economy<br />
right after the $ 10.5 billion blackhole that we inherited from the former Finance Minister, Mr<br />
Beazley and the former government. We've now turned that into a surplus in year three of $ 1.6<br />
billion. I think people will applaud that. I think people will be attracted to the savings initiative<br />
because it's uncomplicated and generously across the board and I think they will see the federation<br />
fund as a very valuable future investment in renewing the important infrastructure of Australia,<br />
particularly regional Australia. I think they'll give it a big tick.<br />
KELLY: Prime Minister thank you very much.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A pleasure always. </p>
