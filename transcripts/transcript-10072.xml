PRIME MINISTER<br />
17 August 1996<br />
E&amp;OE....<br />
QUESTION: Mr Howard, welcome to South Australia and I am sure that we all hope that Mrs Howard<br />
is now recovcring well from her operation. I wish to speak to you not as a citizen to the<br />
Prime Minister but because we both belong to the Liberal Party. Liberals uphold the<br />
right of people to control their own lives so long as thcy don't infringe on the riglhls of<br />
others to control theirs, So I feel dismayed and betrayed that another Liberal, Kevin<br />
Andrews, with your support should wish to go against the will of the Australian people.<br />
For 44 years the Morgan Poll has shown majority support for active voluntary euthanasia.<br />
For the past five years it has been an overwhelming 78%. My qucstion is how can you<br />
justify a cruel law that makes criminals of humane doctors. Six surveys show<br />
approximately one quarter of doctors are courageously breaking the law to accede to<br />
requests from their dying, suffering paticnts. And secondly, is the continuation of this<br />
dangcrous situation a good basis for public policy? Would not well supervised rcgulation<br />
be preferable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is precisely because we believe in individual conscience and personal liberty so<br />
strongly that on matters such as this, we do not have a party view. There is no Liberal<br />
Party view on euthanasia. There is a John Howard personal view, There is a Robert Hill<br />
personal view, an Alexander Downer one and so forth. What Kevin Andrews is doing is<br />
exercising his right as an individual Member of Parliamcnt to introduce a Private<br />
18/ 08/ 96 10: 34 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from 18/ 88/ 96 18: 34 Pg: 2<br />
Member's Bill to give expression to his personal view and, if it attracts majority support,<br />
the aggregate personal views of members of the House of Representatives and members<br />
of the Senate. In no way is he in introducing that bill articulating a collective view of the<br />
Liberal Party. I do not know what will happen to ultimately the legislation. I do not<br />
know. I have indicated myself that personally, as John Howard, as a matter of<br />
conscience I do not support the Northern Territory legislation. That's my personal view.<br />
QUESTION: lIxcuse me Mr Howard but you're not answering my question.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I am, I am trying to treat it seriously and treat it in detail. Now as far as Morgan<br />
Polls are concerned, I have never understood it to be a determinant of what a Party does<br />
that it be instructed by the last poll that it reads or that an individual does. The<br />
legislation that this Private Member's Bill seeks to overturn is not legislation of the<br />
Australian Parliament, it is legislation of the Northern Territory Parliament. We do have<br />
the legitimate constitutional power to do it. We have the right to, the national Parliament<br />
has the right to override a law of the Northern Territory Parliament in this area. We do<br />
not have the right to override a law of a state parliament. So what we are doing is quite<br />
constitutional and quite proper. I don't know what the final outcome will be. I just ask<br />
you to accept that just as you have a strong view on this subject as is evident from your<br />
question, and I respect that view, I ask you to accept that there are other Liberals in good<br />
conscience who have equally strong views and I ask you to accept that and I ask you to<br />
allow the elected Members of Parliament to make their personal decisions on it. I don't<br />
know the outcome but I promise you, if the Australian Parliament, whatever direction the<br />
Australian Parliament votes in I will accept and I hope the majority of Australians will<br />
accept. QUESTION: Diana Hill, Adelaide FEC. Mr Prime Minister, you touched on an area that's close to my<br />
heart. I am involved in the education of overseas or international students in a secondary<br />
setting and you touched upon that within your comments about the education policy. I<br />
wondered whether you or the Minister might like to expand a little bit to reassure people<br />
about places for international students in our tertiary bodies.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We don't have any intention of changing current arrangements, none whatsoever. I was<br />
trying to make the point that it's an odd argument that says it's all right to make places<br />
available for people from other countries in our universities but not for Australians, and I<br />
just think what should happen is that they should be made available on the same basis to<br />
Australians, not that they should be taken away from by people overseas. I think it would </p>
<p>Fax from be very myopic of Australia to in any way close its doors to ovcrscas students. I think it's<br />
one of the things that has helpcd build relationships betweeni this country arnd countrics in<br />
the near north for example, that association.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
To the Honourable the Prime Minister. Firstly I would like to thank you for a<br />
tremendous address and also on this occasion I take the opportunity on behalf of the<br />
primary producers of South Australia to sincerely thank your Coalition Governmcnt for<br />
leaving in place the fuel excise on diesel. Without that rebate, Mr Prime Minister, John<br />
Howard, it would have bcri a catastrophe for South Australian farmers on top of<br />
everything else to have that taken away and I'd like you to carry those thoughts back to<br />
your Coalition Members. As a person who Is very interested in the cnvironmcnt, I ask<br />
you the question, will the third of Telstra sale be stalled in the Senate and if' it is, where<br />
will the environmental issucs and the environmcntal concerns that face South Australia,<br />
whcre will they be placed?<br />
PRINIE MINISTIER:<br />
That rcally depends on the Senate, well more particularly it depends on the Labor Party<br />
and the minor parties in the Scriate. There is no doubt that if you want to improve the<br />
environmental circumstances of South Australia, if you want to vote in favour of cleaning<br />
up the Murray Darling. you will vote in favour of a third sale of Testra, and any South<br />
Australian Member of Parliamecnt who votes against a third sale of Teistra is voting<br />
against thecenvironmental future. of this state. So I mcan I think that is unquestionably...<br />
I hope we can get it through. I don't know yet. Robert may want to add somuthing. Ple<br />
may know something that I don't. If he does, I'd love to hear it but on this subject it's a<br />
secret. They run their own show, thcse Soniators, but I hope, we're working on it and will<br />
try very hard but it's certainly in the interests of South Australia that it go through.<br />
IlLL<br />
It is so legitimate to sell a part of one asset to rebuild the capital into another which is<br />
what we're seeking to do sell one third of a telecommunications company which is<br />
owned by the Government, in order to reinvest part of that capital in another asset which<br />
is our natural environment, and an environment that badly needs a major influx of<br />
capital. That's why we've headed down this path and I give credit to John Howard<br />
because many of you won't know but basically, it was John that came to the rcalisation<br />
that we would not be able to fund the environment in the way that was necessary to<br />
restore that natural capital, that we had to ind a new capital sourec and therefore there<br />
were two things we were wanting to do if we cver sold assets. One was to repay de: bt so<br />
we could keep pressure off interust rates. and so forth for the benefit of small business.<br />
but he bclicvcd that there was one other legitimate purpose for which we could use that<br />
capital and that was the reinviestmrcnt of our natural heritage. So the purpose is sound,<br />
the methodology is sound and it is just so crazy that minority parties who claim to have<br />
Fa raN18/ 08/ 96 10: 34 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from been elected on an environmecnt constituency are going to block that capacity to reinvest<br />
S1 billion in our enivironmont. So if you've got any influcnicc on those Grectns or those<br />
Democrats, now is the time because it's an opportunity that simply must not be lost.<br />
QU T: ST ION:-<br />
My question is addressed to the Prime Minister, and firstly If I could say how joyous it is<br />
to bo able to address a Liberal Prime Minister. The last time Nve had one I think I was<br />
eleven so it's certainly a good thing to,.<br />
PR IN1E N11I NISTE R:<br />
H ow old are you now?<br />
QI. ESTION:<br />
24. It's certainly a good thing to be able to do but my question, I have been away for<br />
several weeks so if the Prime Minister could bring me up to date as to the Governmennt's<br />
position, will you be meeting with the Dallai Larna when he visits in the near future?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
My position on that is that if I did rcccive a reqyuest I would consider such a meeting<br />
subject to my being in the country. it is quite possible that I will be in Japan and<br />
lndoncsia for theparticular week that he is here. So if I did have such mceting it would<br />
bc on the basis that Irn meeting him as the spiritual leader of his people, of which he is a<br />
very significant one. And he is a man who's been to this country on a number of<br />
occasions in the past. Trherc is no argumcnt about the character of our policy toward<br />
Chiria. It is a one China policy. I don't see anything at all inconsistent in having a one<br />
China policy and everybody knows what that mcans and certainly the Chincse<br />
Government knows what is meant by a one China policy. Thcre is nothing inconsistcIt<br />
in having a one China policy and meeting the Dalai Lama as the spiritual leader of his<br />
pcoplc. I think it is an utterly sensible and consistent thing to do and it would hc a little<br />
strange if the icircumnstances allowed it for the Prime Minister of this country if it were<br />
mutually convenient for such a meeting to tnke place for him to participate in it. But it<br />
should be understood by verybody as to the basis on which such a rmting would takc<br />
place. QUESTION: Thank you Mr Chairman. Prime Minister I am a young farmer and the trouble is with the<br />
banks at the moment they charge us one hell of a margin when we want to borrow<br />
money. You can borrow the same amount of moncy to borrow a house and get a<br />
considerably less margin. I just wonder what the Federal Govcrment is going to do,<br />
F fom18/ 88/ 96 18: 34 PS: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from well it's the samc for small business as well and just wonder what the Fzderal<br />
Govcrnmen are going to do to the banks to try and address this imbalance bcnvwern<br />
busincss and home loans. It is anything up To a 5 per cent margin and it is really is an<br />
impost on jobs because on a Sl/ 2 million borrowing on a 5 per cent margin is S25.000<br />
and that's a fair wage.<br />
PRIMEMNISTER I don't have a magic wand solution to that but I can say this much, but the reason interest<br />
rates for housing are lower now than what thcy might othcrwisc have bccn is that we<br />
have a lot more competition in the provision of bank lending for housing. Indeed to<br />
those who believe, and there may even be a few of them in the Liberal Party, I don't<br />
know, who believe that competition is not always the right way to go. We'vc had a<br />
classic demonstration in tht past few months of just how valuable competition can be<br />
and that is in the area of housing loans. You would ncvcr have had the falls in housing<br />
interest rates that occurred before the last downward niovcmcnt in the Reserve Bank<br />
interest rate if it hadn't been for the competition injcctcd. into the systcrm by outfits like<br />
Aussie Home Loans and RAMS and all those other org-anisations that are lending in<br />
competition with the banks. Commonwealth Bank moved its interest rate down a few<br />
months ago because it was losing markct share to thc small new entrants who arc<br />
gobbling up loans at a very very rapid rate.<br />
Now I suppose the answer to your question is that if the same circumstances of<br />
competition in making money available to business existed in relation to making money<br />
available for housing then you might start to sce some contraction of that margin, It's<br />
interesting you asked me the question, that was one of the questions I did get at Winton<br />
in Qucensland yesterday. I was asked that self-same question and I think that it is a very<br />
legitimate qucstion to be asked and I think it ought to be discussd. and debated and! I<br />
think the banks ought to be asked it. And I hope the Wallace Inquiry has a look at why it<br />
is and I think it is about competition and I can't smrss too strongly that, I know people get<br />
a bit suspicious of conmpetition on occasions but at the end of the day the consumer<br />
normally benerits from more comnpetition. We're seeing it with telephone charges, we're<br />
going to have Optus providing 20 cent telephone calls and who would have thought that<br />
was likely. I mean, I can remember a rew years ago where we had a pretty spectacular<br />
by-election result here in Adcaidc but everybody thought it would go in the other<br />
direction, Now what you have got in the telecommnunications industry is you've got technology<br />
which should compress price and then you add a bit of competition to that and presto.<br />
you get a better deal for the consumer. Now in housing interest rates you have got a<br />
better deal for the consumecr because thure is more competition. Now in my sort of<br />
rcuble way I would think that if' you got more competition in relation to business loans<br />
you mig~ ht 6vt a repeat of that, I don't know. And some of the economists might tell tre<br />
thcre is complicated reason why it can't occur but I'nm not absolutely certain. But I don't<br />
know the full answer to it but I think pcople in the rural sctor should talk about it as<br />
Faxro'~ 18/ 08/ 96 10: 34 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from loudly and as long as they can and I think that will start to have an influence because I<br />
can sympaihise with you and I can understand why you get so cranky but there is such a<br />
margin between loans, housing loans. W's not just all related to risk and sccurity bccause<br />
that it part of the explanation but it's not the sole explanation for it.<br />
STATE PRESIDENT<br />
Prime Minister on behalf of the South Australian Division I want to thank you vcrv much<br />
Fbr the time you've spent with us this afternoon and the manncr in which you've<br />
addressed us and answered qucstions and I ak delegated to show their apprcciation.<br />
