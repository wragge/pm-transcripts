EMBARGO:<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 20 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The bushfires which have swept through South Australia and<br />
Victoria are the worst Australia has ever known. Over<br />
people have lost their lives and around 2,000 homes have been<br />
burnt to the ground. The fires have destroyed the livelihoods<br />
of many Australian families and I know every Australian joins<br />
with me in extending their deepest sympathy to those<br />
who have lost friends and relations in the fires, and to those<br />
whose homes and possessions have been destroyed.<br />
The thousands of firefighters who have fought the fires with great<br />
determination and bravery deserve our greatest praise, and<br />
thanks without them the devastation would have been<br />
immeasurably worse. The police, the services, and thousands<br />
of voluntary workers have done a wonderful job in backing up<br />
the firefighters and in providing relief from immediate<br />
hardship. They too deserve our thanks. Tens of thousands<br />
of others all around the nation have expressed their concern,<br />
and offered their assistance, through generous contributions<br />
in the form of food, clothing and other supplies, and through<br />
donations to appeals.<br />
The response to the financial appeals has been magnificent,<br />
and the Commonwealth has played a part both by contributions to<br />
those appeals and by providing that donations to the appeals<br />
will be tax deductible. At a time like this a very great<br />
responsibility falls on the Commonwealth Government to do all<br />
it can to ease the suffering, and the financial burdens that<br />
have been created by the fires. The full extent of the financial<br />
assistance that will be needed can only be determined once<br />
the total damage has been assessed. This will take some days<br />
and is likely to run into tens of millions of dollars.<br />
Much of the assistance from the Commonwealth will come under<br />
the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements. I have offered to<br />
the Premiers of South Australia and Victoria that initial<br />
instalments of Commonwealth assistance of $ 10 million in the<br />
case of Victoria and $ 6 million in the case of South Australia,<br />
be paid under the N. D. R. A. in advance of settling final details.<br />
This will enable the two State Governments to make an immediate<br />
start on providing relief and assistance, without excessive<br />
strain to their budgets. / 2 </p>

But the Commonwealth will provide considerable assistance beyond<br />
these obligations. We have already agreed to extend the assistance<br />
to include concessional loans to home owners, small businesses<br />
and primary producers who have lost their property, as well as<br />
for the re-establishment of facilities such as recreation camps,<br />
assistance with the freight costs of stock and fodder, and up<br />
to $ 1,200 per kilometre for materials for boundary fencing will<br />
also be given.<br />
These measures will all be administered by the States. We will,<br />
of course, continue to review the needs of those affected by<br />
the fires and provide any further assistance that may be necessary.<br />
In particular, we are examining in association with the two<br />
State Governments, and the relevant local Governments, the kinds<br />
of additional measures that are needed to help rebuild or<br />
replace devastated community assets in semi-urban areas.<br />
Some things can never be replaced, no measure of assistance can<br />
even start to compensate the relatives and friends of those who<br />
lost their lives in the fires. No measure of assistance can<br />
replace the treasured personal possessions so many people have<br />
lost. All Governments can do is to ensure that the suffering is<br />
not compounded by intolerable financial burdens on people and<br />
communities.<br />
This terrible tragedy has reminded us all of something very<br />
important about Australia and the Australian people. In many<br />
respects Australia is a harsh land. It is the world's driest<br />
continent, and its climate is often severe. To build a nation<br />
in such a difficult environment has been one of the great<br />
human challenges of the last couple of centuries. Yet Australians<br />
have not only met that challenge with vigour and determination,<br />
they have created one of the world's most successful communities.<br />
Above all, that has been made possible by the tradition of<br />
Australian mateship. That tradition grew out of adversity.<br />
It grew because Australians knew and still know that to<br />
overcome hardship and crises we have to help each other, to<br />
work together. The response, not just by Governments, but by<br />
people all over Australia to the great suffering caused by<br />
the fires in Victoria and South Australia, has shown that<br />
when some Australians are in very real difficulties they can<br />
count on each other to pitch in. That is the meaning of<br />
mateship. </p>
