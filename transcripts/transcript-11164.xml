    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister good morning and welcome.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good morning John. Good to be on your program.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Thank you. That's nice of you. Has this whole debate helped shape the succession</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party leadership?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It's not really had any impact on that. We're having a free vote. I decided</p>
<p>   that 19 months ago at the Constitutional Convention. I announced there that</p>
<p>   if there were a referendum then I would allow members of the parliamentary</p>
<p>   Liberal Party a free vote. And we've stuck to that. And given that there's</p>
<p>   a range of views in our party on this subject as there is in the community,</p>
<p>   the differences have been handled with a great deal of stability. And all</p>
<p>   that's happening is that the free vote ends at 6:00pm eastern daylight time</p>
<p>   on Saturday when the polling booths close, and we go back to having a government</p>
<p>   position on all of these things. That doesn't mean to say that inside the</p>
<p>   forums of the government, around the Cabinet table, in the party room, people</p>
<p>   won't continue to put their respective points of view. But you won't after</p>
<p>   the weekend have one person saying well I think this is how we should handle</p>
<p>   the constitution, and another person saying this is a different way that</p>
<p>   I'd handle the constitution. All that's going to happen is that the government</p>
<p>   will again be speaking on constitutional matters with one voice because</p>
<p>   the free vote will have been over. And I think we will have been enhanced</p>
<p>   and strengthened and dignified as a party as a consequence. It's a sign</p>
<p>   of strength and self-assurance that a party can allow a free vote on something</p>
<p>   like this. It's a sign of weakness and concern that you have to try and</p>
<p>   railroad everybody into singing from the same hymn sheet.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah. Well I think most people would agree with that. And you require unity</p>
<p>   to have a government that can run the place properly.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well exactly. I mean we allow a free vote on a few things. We allow a free</p>
<p>   vote on what are traditionally called moral or conscious issues like euthanasia,</p>
<p>   abortion and those sorts of things. And we did have quite a vigorous debate</p>
<p>   on free lines in relation to the overturning of the Northern Territory euthanasia</p>
<p>   law. Remember that, it was a couple of years ago. Now we allowed a free</p>
<p>   vote on that. We emerged from that unscathed. Likewise I decided on this</p>
<p>   issue that it was best to let people because it's an unusual issue, it doesn't</p>
<p>   come along all that often, I thought the best thing to do was to allow people</p>
<p>   a free vote. And that's been taken up.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Will it ever come along again?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I don't know. All I can say is that I think if whatever the outcome,</p>
<p>   I mean let's deal with the two scenarios, and I think it's, can I say, I</p>
<p>   think it's going to be closer.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  I think it's going to be closer than most people think.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I do. I think, I mean I've learnt to expect the unexpected in politics,</p>
<p>   and so has Jeff Kennett and a lot of us in the Liberal Party. I mean you've</p>
<p>   just got to be realistic. And I think over the next few days the television</p>
<p>   and radio advertising campaign by the yes side will be of avalanche proportions.</p>
<p>   They have a lot more money I understand from private sources than does the</p>
<p>   no campaign. I think on Saturday what people are forgetting is that the</p>
<p>   Labor Party is campaigning nationally as a party for the yes vote and therefore</p>
<p>   the Labor Party organisation will mobilise its members and the trade unionists</p>
<p>   to work on the polling booths on Saturday. By contrast on the Coalition</p>
<p>   side, although the National Party is by and large campaigning as a party</p>
<p>   that is restricted to the rural areas of Australia, the Liberal Party of</p>
<p>   course does not have an official position. And whereas I know that a lot</p>
<p>   of individual members of the Liberal Party will be working for the no case</p>
<p>   on polling booths and some for the yes case, which may I say is their right</p>
<p>   if that is their view. And I make it very clear to members of the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party that they are free on Saturday irrespective of the attitude of the</p>
<p>   members in their own constituencies..</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Until six o'clock.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, well, I'm talking about the ordinary members of the party. Well.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  But I think it's a very good idea.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  And I'm just saying to people that I think this thing is going to be a lot</p>
<p>   closer. I do not believe that, you know, the inevitability which people</p>
<p>   are starting to say out of the polls. The polls have been badly wrong in</p>
<p>   the past. So, I think when you add all of those things up I think it is</p>
<p>   going to be close. But I think if the yes vote wins then that will be it.</p>
<p>   You won't, in my opinion, have another referendum for direct election of</p>
<p>   the President. Interesting what Bob Carr said.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yes, very.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I thought Carr's intervention was fascinating and what Carr has done is</p>
<p>   to undercut the Beazley play. The Beazley play is 'yes and more'. What Beazley's</p>
<p>   saying is, vote yes on Saturday even if you are a direct electionist and</p>
<p>   then I'll give you another vote.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah, well Bob Carr's rejected that.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, he has. And Bob Carr, after all, has won a couple of elections and</p>
<p>   he's the most powerful and the most successful Labor leader in Australia.</p>
<p>   He is the politically successfully face of Labor.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah, Prime Minister you wouldn't be saying these nice things about him</p>
<p>   if he'd not said what he said about that.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I'm being realistic. I mean, he is.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  You're being very political too and cleverly political because he did reject</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, he did. I mean, he said, no way. He said that he would rather stick</p>
<p>   with the present system of constitutional monarchy than have a directly</p>
<p>   elected presidency. Now, I don't believe in a directly elected presidency.</p>
<p>   I mean, I am a conservative on this issue. I'm an undisguised conservative.</p>
<p>   I've always said that. I've been utterly consistent. I don't feel we need</p>
<p>   a change. I don't think Australians feel we need - well, they don't feel</p>
<p>   passionately that we need a change and I don't know in the end what they're</p>
<p>   going to do. But I thought Carr really undercut the Beazley play. And what</p>
<p>   Carr was really - Carr was calling it as it is. If the yes vote wins on</p>
<p>   Saturday there will be overwhelming opposition within both the Labor Party</p>
<p>   and the Coalition to have another referendum for a directly elected presidency.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Rupert Murdoch's had a bit to say on the republic issue today. He thinks</p>
<p>   that we'd suffer a loss of self respect if the no case wins. Would we?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No. I think this is the weakest argument of the lot, this sort of international</p>
<p>   independence argument. I've just gone through, in relation to East Timor,</p>
<p>   the most intense and comprehensive series of high level negotiations that</p>
<p>   any Australian Prime Minister's been involved in since World War II. And</p>
<p>   I didn't at any moment, for a nano-second, feel as though I was other than</p>
<p>   the elected, democratically elected leader of a fully independent nation.</p>
<p>   To suggest that there would have been a different outcome in relation to</p>
<p>   East Timor if we'd been a republic, to suggest that our constitutional status</p>
<p>   in any way influenced the receptivity of our point of view, either negatively</p>
<p>   or positively, in any part of the world is patently absurd. That, incidentally,</p>
<p>   is the view of Lee Kuan Yew, the elder Statesman of Asia, who made the observation</p>
<p>   a few years ago, couldn't understand what all this debate was about. Look,</p>
<p>   we'll decide our own constitutional forms. We don't seek the leave or permission</p>
<p>   of any foreign country or any foreigner to decide our own constitutional</p>
<p>   arrangements.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Okay, could I ask you this question that I ask everybody, republicans and</p>
<p>   monarchists, how would the place be different if it became a republic, how</p>
<p>   would our day-to-day lives be different?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, our day-to-day lives would not be altered. And to be fair to them</p>
<p>   I don't think some of the more sensible republicans are saying that our</p>
<p>   day-to-day lives are going to be altered. I think our constitution would</p>
<p>   be less effective. I believe that a President in a republic would, in a</p>
<p>   crisis, be more vulnerable than is the current Governor-General. Day-to-day,</p>
<p>   no improvement, no change, however, the effectiveness of a constitution</p>
<p>   is measured by how it copes in a crisis. Any old constitutional will do</p>
<p>   when everything's going swimmingly, won't it? But it's when you put the</p>
<p>   thing under stress and strain that you find out whether it works. Now, my</p>
<p>   concern is that a President would be more vulnerable on balance under a</p>
<p>   republic, the model we're being asked to support on Saturday, than would</p>
<p>   the Governor-General under the present system. And there are flaws in this</p>
<p>   model. I don't know whether you saw that excellent article by Mr Justice</p>
<p>   Ken Handley, the Judge of the Court of Appeal in New South Wales in the</p>
<p>   Financial Review yesterday. A very eloquent exposure of the possibility</p>
<p>   of sort of litigation over cross dismissals with the Prime Minister, you</p>
<p>   know, with the signed dismissal in his pocket. Now, I'm not suggesting and</p>
<p>   nobody suggests that these things are going to happen everyday, of course</p>
<p>   they don't, but what I am saying is that you measure a constitution by its</p>
<p>   durability through crisis and strain and stress and we've had 100 years</p>
<p>   to measure the current constitution and it worked.</p>
<p>  The one time it was put under real stress was in 1975. And whatever may</p>
<p>   now be retrospectively said by both Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser about</p>
<p>   1975 what the late Governor-General then did was to remit the matter to</p>
<p>   the Australian people. And within a few weeks the Australian people could</p>
<p>   decide whether or not they agreed or disagreed with Mr Whitlam or Mr Fraser.</p>
<p>   Now, that is the essence of a democracy and it worked on that occasion.</p>
<p>   And, of course, the other irony about 1975 is that the republicans are supporting</p>
<p>   a model which they say would still allow the future Australian president</p>
<p>   to do what John Kerr did. So, I mean, I am lost as to quite what they are</p>
<p>   getting at. I thought for some of the Labor republicans maintaining the</p>
<p>   rage was the only thing that mattered in life yet they are now purporting</p>
<p>   to carry forward into a new republican constitution the reserve powers of</p>
<p>   the Crown, it's like having a monarchy without the monarch which is an interesting</p>
<p>   proposition within itself. But that's for them to answer. I thought what</p>
<p>   Sir John Kerr did in 1975 at least provided a democratic outcome. I mean,</p>
<p>   if you look back on 1975 the last person who, in my view, should be criticised</p>
<p>   is the late Governor-General. I think if people felt strongly about 1975</p>
<p>   they should direct their criticism either against Mr Fraser or Mr Whitlam.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Just tell me briefly why you believe people should vote no on Saturday?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think they should vote no because we know the present system works, it's</p>
<p>   very safe. I don't believe in changing something which has manifestly worked</p>
<p>   and contributed to making this one of the most democratic societies in the</p>
<p>   world. That's the main reason why I ask people to vote no. The second and</p>
<p>   less important, but nonetheless important reason, is that I think the model</p>
<p>   being proposed is flawed. I think there's too much power for arbitrary dismissal</p>
<p>   in the hands of the Prime Minister. I also think that the nomination process</p>
<p>   will result in less qualified people making themselves available to be president</p>
<p>   than is now the case with the governor-generalship. See this public nomination</p>
<p>   process will scare away a lot of eminent people.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Do you think a lot of people are confused, just generally confused about</p>
<p>   the entire issue?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, people are confused but, you know, I am not.you know, I understand</p>
<p>   that although I don't think people are as confused as some others would</p>
<p>   allege. I think deep down there is a feeling in the community that well,</p>
<p>   yeah but, I mean, why do we want to change something that works.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yes, I think that's.but I think there is a lot of confusion nonetheless</p>
<p>   and..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, there is confusion but that always happens. That's democracy. People</p>
<p>   have a right to put their point of view. I mean, I have tried to put a measured,</p>
<p>   conservative case on this. I have never been reluctant to nail my colours</p>
<p>   to the mask on this issue but I said the people would have a vote and the</p>
<p>   people are having a vote. But my main pitch is to people simply that look,</p>
<p>   there are some things in this country that need changing and improving because</p>
<p>   they don't work. But we do know that our Constitution works. We do know</p>
<p>   that we are one of fewer than 10 nations that have been continuously democratic</p>
<p>   through the 20th Century. Now, I am not saying all of that is</p>
<p>   due to the arrangements we have for a head of state but they have made a</p>
<p>   contribution, those arrangements, to the stability. And I just don't think</p>
<p>   you should change something unless it's clearly demonstrated that it needs</p>
<p>   changing.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Okay. Now, the Reserve Bank has just announced that expected quarter of</p>
<p>   a point increase in interest rates so the official rate is up .25 of a per</p>
<p>   cent. Not unexpected, but that's the first rise in five years, does that</p>
<p>   mean it's some kind of blow to your economic policies or not?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No. I see it very much as a piece of fine-tuning by the Reserve Bank. The</p>
<p>   bank, of course, has independent control of interest rates and monetary</p>
<p>   policy. Bear in mind that we had a long succession of reductions in interest</p>
<p>   rates at a time when the world economy was in significant recession or certainly</p>
<p>   growth was very slow. The view is now apparently being taken by the Reserve</p>
<p>   Bank similar to the view being taken by the federal reserve system in the</p>
<p>   United States, the American Central Bank, that now that the world economy</p>
<p>   is recovering there is a case for making monetary policy slightly less expansionary.</p>
<p>   And it's a tiny adjustment and whilst as in the past I am not going to speculate</p>
<p>   about the future path of interest rates it is a small adjustment. And I</p>
<p>   refer you to the remarks made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank last week</p>
<p>   when he spoke of the likelihood of less sharp adjustments in the future.</p>
<p>   It's very much a pre-emptive adjustment to make a contribution to constraining</p>
<p>   any inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Look, it will add about $16 a month to the average mortgage so what's your</p>
<p>   message to home owners?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the message is that we don't like any increase. On the other hand,</p>
<p>   we don't like inflation picking up again and if this makes a contribution</p>
<p>   to holding it back in the long run you'll be better off. And in any event,</p>
<p>   mortgage interest rates are dramatically lower now by still more than $300</p>
<p>   a month than what they were three and a half years ago.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Okay. Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time. It's going to be</p>
<p>   interesting on Saturday to see what does come about and I am with you, I</p>
<p>   think it's going to be a good deal closer than a lot of people think.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Thank you John.</p>
