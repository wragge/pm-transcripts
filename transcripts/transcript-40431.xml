    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />
  We have gathered together, our  neighbours of ASEAN and some of the leading powers in the world - India, China,  Russia - are gathered together here with all of our neighbours. </p>
<p>
  Now, we've seen, overnight, two  disturbing reminders of how important it is that we focus on these critical  issues of national security here in Vientiane over the next few days. </p>
<p>
  We saw the latest missile tests  by North Korea, which have been condemned and which I condemned earlier, as  indeed have other governments. These represent continued destabilising,  dangerous and provocative conduct by the DPRK. </p>
<p>
  In addition, we've also seen  overnight, a call by Daesh, or ISIL for lone-wolf terrorist attacks in  Australia, nominating prominent Australian locations for these attacks. Now,  this is consistent with my national security statement of last week, in which I  noted that as Daesh comes under more and more pressure on the battlefield in  Syria and in Iraq, as it is rolled back, as its territory is being taken back,  it will resort to terrorist activities outside of the Middle East. </p>
<p>
  Australians can be reassured  that we have the finest security, intelligence, police forces in the world, and  we are providing them, as you saw in my national security statement last week,  with the laws they need and the resources they need to keep us safe. But at the  same time, we need, more than ever, to cooperate closely, to engage intimately  with our neighbours in the fight against counter-terrorism. Sharing of  intelligence is more important than ever before. And so counter-terrorism, too,  is going to be a key focus of these meetings over the next few days. </p>
<p>
  This is the premier forum for  discussing and resolving issues of national security, economic security in our  region. So I'm very pleased to be here, and I'm here in Vientiane, and I'll be  leaving now to speak with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, in  advance of meetings over the next few days.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong><br />
  Prime Minister, may I ask you -  it seems as though you have met with everyone but Japan’s Prime Minister,  Shinzo Abe. </p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  I’ll be meeting with – </p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Sorry to interrupt - have you  sought a meeting with him? And what's Australia doing to repair that  relationship with Japan post the subs decision, which has caused some friction?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  Can I say that the relationship  with Japan is very, very warm and very close. I spoke with Prime Minister Abe  on several occasions in the course of the G20 meeting. As you probably know,  there are formal bilaterals but in these conferences very often the most  valuable encounters are the less-formal ones, where there can be a very candid  exchange of views and Prime Minister Abe and I had a number of meetings of that  kind. However, we do have a formal bilateral meeting scheduled here. But the  relationship is a very warm one, a very close one. We regard each other as  friends at a personal level. It's a very strong relationship. </p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Prime Minister, how do you  judge the capacity of Daesh to deliver on the threats? Do they worry you?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  Well, of course we are  concerned about terrorism. We have a threat level of "probable", so  it is a real threat. Our security services are relentless - tireless - in  keeping Australians safe. The capacity of Daesh, of course, is much less than they  proclaim it to be but we do have to be very alert to the actions of these lone  actors. Individuals who - as I've described in the national security statement  last week – individuals who for a variety of reasons may be radicalised, often  associated with mental illness, frankly, can be radicalised very quickly and  engage in very destructive, lethal conduct, as we saw in Nice, for example. So  we have to be very alert, we are focused on that, my coordinator of  counter-terrorism, Greg Moriarty, who of course is now heading up the  international policy advice in my office, has been working on and completing a  report, a review, of our measures in the light of these lone attackers - of the  phenomenon of the lone attacker, following the Nice attack. Every time there is  a terrorist incident, wherever it is in the world, we learn as much as we can  about it and then take those learnings to keep Australians more safe. I have  been meeting and will be meeting over the next few days with the leaders of  countries who have experienced very severe terrorist activity in our region  very recently and, of course, as we know from a number of tragic incidents,  including, of course, the Bali bombing, when there is terrorist activity in our  region, very often - almost invariably, for a large-scale attack - Australians  can be put at risk and, indeed, have lost their lives. We're all in it  together. It's got to be a very strong full-court press against terrorism.  We're committed to that. And I'm looking forward to some very candid and constructive  discussions over the next few days. </p>
<p>
  Thanks very much.</p>
