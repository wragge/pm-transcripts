TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER RADIO 6PR<br />
E O E<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Howard.<br />
SATTLER: Thanks for joining us.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a pleasure.<br />
SATTLER: You're sounding a bit laid back.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Am I?<br />
SATTLER: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well let me get excited.<br />
SATTLER: I thought that's you...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And it's terrific to be talking to you again mate.<br />
SATTLER: Well, if you thought this was a great budget you should be. But let's put yourself in the position of a<br />

small business proprietor this morning. Now, would the budget have you going out and advertising for<br />
more staff?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It ought to.<br />
SATTLER: Why? PRIM~' E MINISTER:<br />
Well, to start with there's a big echo in mny microphone, I'm sorry.<br />
SATTLER: You're sound all right here.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah well that's okay. That's important, critical. That small businessman will look at this budget and<br />
he would see that we inherited a deficit of $ 10.5 billion and we've turned it into a surplus of $ 1.6<br />
billion at the end of three years. He'll know that that will exert downward pressure on interest rates.<br />
He will know that from the 1 st of July this year there will be a capital gains tax break for small<br />
business people. He will know that we've cut the red tape in many areas affecting his business. He will<br />
know that we have changed the industrial relations system to make it easier. We would like to go<br />
further on the unfair dismissal front but it looks as though the Senate, through the courtesy of the<br />
Labor Party and the Democrats and Senator Harradine, are going to thwart our attempts to remove all<br />
unfair dismissal restrictions on every small business that employs fewer than 15 people in relation to<br />
people they've had on their books for less than 12 months. And we're trying to do that. Look, can I<br />
say this echo is quite disconcerting.<br />
SATTLER: All right, well we might have that sorted out over there if we could.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah, I'm sorry, everything I'm saying is echoing.<br />
So he would look at this budget and he'd say this is a government that has inherited somebody else's<br />
miess but have put the books of Australia into proper order, this is a government that has built a<br />
sounder economy for the future, this is a government that has already delivered a 1 cut in interest<br />
rates and has now delivered a budget that will improve the climate if the monetary authorities want to<br />
make a further interest rate cut. So on all of the fundamentals that businessman could say to himself:<br />
this is a reliable government, this is a government that attends to first things first, this is a government<br />
that is prepared to clean up other people's fiscal failures and this is a government that is getting<br />
Australia out of debt, that is a good government and it's a government that is creating a good<br />
economic climate for me to run my business.<br />

<p>14 May1997ttp:// xww. tia. gov. au/ pnic/ pressrel/ sattler2. litii<br />
All right. But the last budget didn't do that did it? Because after inheriting a jobless rate of 8.5% it's<br />
gone up to 8.7% and by my estimations there are 30 000 more people on the dole. So would you<br />
admit that so far, on that front, you haven't succeeded?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I didn't think I'd succeed in a year to get rid of unemployment and I never promised that to<br />
anybody at the time of the last election. I said that the best way of reducing unemployment was to get<br />
small business going again. And that is what, on every front, we are endeavouring to do. We've<br />
changed the capital gains tax laws. We've changed the industrial relations law. If the Senate is not<br />
obstructionist we'll change the unfair dismissal laws even further. We've reduced the paperwork<br />
burden. We've reduced the provision tax uplift factor. We've created the circumstances that have<br />
reduced interest rates. We've consolidated the low levels of inflation. Now, over time that will give an<br />
incentive to small business to get out and do more. But it does take time for interest rates to flow... the<br />
benefits of lower interest rates to flow through to the economy. And I simply say to all of your<br />
listeners that we've only been in office 14 months, you can't turn everything around...<br />
SATTLER: But you made some predictions about unemployment in the last budget which didn't come true, is that<br />
right? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The variation is not enormous.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
No, no, but they were wrong. I want to know how confident you are about getting to this 8% in the<br />
next 12 months.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we believe that if all of the predictions that are made about growth it will be achieved. But I'm<br />
not holding out to people that there's going to be a dramatic fall over the next 12 months. I can't<br />
honestly... SATTLER: Well 8% wouldn't be a dramatic fall anyway, would it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, it wouldn't be. It would be the best we've had since 1990, the best we've had since 1990, but it<br />
wouldn't be a dramatic fall. It is going to be a slow business. But there are a number of things in this<br />
budget that over time are going to help them. I mean, the federation fund, over time, will help because<br />
it will be largely devoted towards jobs generating investment. And you can't get away from the fact,<br />
Howard, as I said in the election campaign, but the only way you're going to make a big dent in<br />
unemployment in this country over a period of time is through the small business sector.<br />
SATTLER: But aren't we entitled to feel a bit short changed both by the previous administration and yours<br />

because you've substituted a savings scheme, a savings rebate scheme for Paul Keating's failed L-A-W<br />
law tax cuts. Now, I thought even though that he broke promises there, you wouldn't.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that was his commitment...<br />
SATTLER: Yeah, but didn't you undertake to go along with that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we undertook to have... . we undertook to deliver it in the form of a contribution or other savings<br />
measure. Now, we have delivered it as a savings measure, not of the same amount, I acknowledge<br />
that, and that is a contribution to reducing deficit. And<br />
SATTLER: By about $ 3800 million, is that right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you're multiplying over a period of years, but it makes a contribution, and it doesn't represent, of<br />
course, an increase. It was a commitment made by the former government in 1992. Now, we are<br />
delivering a superior savings scheme. For the first time since federation you've got a national<br />
government that is inviting Australians across the board to save. We're giving them a break for<br />
savings, 15%, all forms of saving. Not just bank savings, all forms of returns on investment. If you<br />
make a personal contribution to superannuation that doesn't already have a tax break you will get the<br />
SATTLER: How many people do you reckon you're going to qualify for this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
About six million.<br />
SATTLER: Really?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Six million people when it is up and running in one form or another we estimate will benefit from this<br />
measure. It is the first time since federation that a government has put its tax incentive where its<br />
mouth is in encouraging people to save. Now, politicians year in and year out have said, you know,<br />
Australians ought to save more, but they've never given them an incentive. For the first time this will<br />
give them an incentive. This will be good for young people saving for a home. It will be good for<br />
people who are making a personal super contribution. It will be very good for self-funded retirees<br />
because for the first time they will get a tax reward for saving. 4 oI~ 1106/ 1370:/ 3947: 1 1<br />

SATTLER: All right, Prime Minister we'll take a short break. I've got to pay a few bills, you'd appreciate that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Go for your life.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
And we'll be back and take some calls in just a moment.<br />
( tape break)<br />
SATTLER: We've got a call, Prime Minister, from Norma. Good morning Norma.<br />
CALLER: Good morning.<br />
SATTLER: And the Prime Minister is listening.<br />
CALLLER: Yes well I'm a pensioner on private rental. I just watched the news on Channel 9 and they said that<br />
you're taking away rental assistance from pensioners.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, that's not right. No, the only change there is that if somebody is living with another person in<br />
subsidised housing commission accomnmodation and thereby getting the benefit of a subsidised rent...<br />
CALLER: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, hang on, could I just please finish because I don't want people alarmed by misinformation. The<br />
only change we're making is that if somebody is living with another person and that second person is<br />
getting a subsidised rent well that person living with them can't also get a rent assistance payment<br />
because otherwise they're double-dipping. Now, that is the only change that's being made there and if<br />
people are spreading stories that we're taking away other amounts then they're wrong.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
All right Norma. Are you living with someone else who's getting subsidy?<br />

No I'm not, I'm living alone.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well your subsidy will not be affected by this budget.<br />
SATTLER: There you go Norma, you'll be okay.<br />
CALLER: Well what about what else he's taking away from pensioners?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look, I mean, if somebody has asked you to ring or whatever that's fine, I mean let's put it on the<br />
table. But can I just say to you that what you have just said is factually wrong. I would never do that<br />
and I resent the fact that people spread these fear stories in relation to the elderly. All we are doing is<br />
preventing the abuse of a situation where you have a double-dip on the welfare system, and that's<br />
wrong. SATTLER:<br />
Well Prime Minister you're giving a lot of attention to the rural areas too in this budget...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes we are, and deservedly so.<br />
SATTLER: Yeah, but is that to save Tim Fischer's political life?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No it is not, because they deserve help, they've done it hard. They've had years of drought and very<br />
indifferent seasons and they're entitled to a decent scheme to replace the rural adjustment scheme that<br />
most reports indicate are simply not working effectively.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
And will it stop the Hanson bandwagon in the bush?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look, this budget is not targeted at the Hanson bandwagon or any other bandwagon. It's targeted<br />
to benefit Australia's future. As far as that bandwagon is concerned, I will deal with issues on their<br />
own merits. And I would say to the farmers of Australia that the best thing that we've done for you is<br />
that we've reduced Australia's debts and that means we are consolidating the conditions for lower<br />
interest rates. Farmers always complain, quite rightly, that governments run up debt. This has been a<br />
budget that's taken a $ 10.5 billion deficit and turned it into a $ 1.6 billion surplus in three years. This<br />

year we will repay $ 5.3 billion of Mr Keating's debts. By the year 2000 we will have halved from<br />
to 10% the debt, the GDP ratio of this nation. Now, all of that will deliver a more stable economy, a<br />
more low cost economny for Australia's rural people and that will do more to help the farmers of<br />
Australia than any cheap populism from an alternative political philosophy.<br />
SATTLER: Listen, I've got an apology to make to you too.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Whly? SATTLER: Because I said yesterday, after I heard the news that Kim Beazley had called upon you to, like the<br />
Labor Party, put Pauline Hanson last in Oxley, that you'd definitely go along with that but you haven't.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look, we will decide in the normal way, when the election comes, how we allocate preferences.<br />
And I'm not going to get caught up with some gimmick by Kim Beazley on that issue. Can I just tell<br />
you that, you know, this man who's trying to get the moral high ground on this issue, at the last<br />
federal election hie put, in my own electorate of Bennelong, he put the Australians Against Further<br />
Immigration ahead of me. Now, I don't care about that, it's totally irrelevant as far as my own seat is<br />
concerned. But I mean, it does sort of show what feet of clay the moralist has on this subject. Now,<br />
the Queensland organisations will decide preferences in the seat of Oxley at the time of the next<br />
election. It's two years off Long way to go Kim. Two years off and we will decide our preferences<br />
then. I'm not going to, sort of, get caught up in some gimmicky stunt by him on that issue.<br />
SATTLER: All right. You're next caller is Ingrid. Hello Ingrid.<br />
CALLER: Good morning. Well there's much done about the pensioners. They've been hit left and right and also<br />
this... SATTLER: But in specifically...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pensioners have not look could I tell you there's one thing that has been done for the pensioners. We<br />
are actually legislating to guarantee that the pension will never fall below 25% of average weekly<br />
earnings. We're legislating that. The first time it's ever been done. So when you say there's been<br />
nothing done for the pensioners, there's been a lot done for them. And keeping prices down and and<br />
we've also got, in relation to people who might be coming on to the pension, we're introducing this<br />
p~ ension bonus scheme that will encourage people in the workforce who don't want to go out to stay in<br />
the workforce. So I'm not going to cop this allegation that the pensioners have been hit right, left and<br />
centre. They have not been hit. We have increased the domiciliary care allowance by 25% and that will<br />

help people who are caring intensively for a frail relative. We have protected the pension by way of the<br />
legislation that I've just cited. And the other stabilising affects on the economy all keep prices down<br />
and that is a great help to pensioners.<br />
CALLER: Well, they got $ 1 .20 rise last year.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we're talking about this year madam. I mean, look, if you're going to make an allegation about<br />
the budget, be specific, be accurate, don't spread misinformation about somnething that clearly is<br />
unsupportable. There is nothing in this budget that is inimical to pensioners. On the contrary, we are<br />
guaranteeing, via the legislation.. the Labor Party did it. They had 13 years to do that and we're doing<br />
it in this budget. We are putting into legislation the 25% guarantee. So I am not going to have<br />
anybody say that this is a budget that's unfair to pensioners. We would never be unfair to pensioners.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Prime Minister, $ 20 million is going to be, extra funds, are going to go into the Native Title Tribunal.<br />
Now, what does that say of what we can expect on that front in the next year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'll tell you what you can expect on that front. You can expect, on that front, you can expect, if<br />
we get our legislation through the Senate, you can expect a number of things. You can expect the<br />
bogus claims to be wiped out. You can..<br />
SATTLER: Quickly? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well as soon as we can get the legislation through the Senate. And the legislation is there. I've had the<br />
Point Plan adopted. And the legislation giving effect to that is being prepared at the present time.<br />
And I want to say to all of your listeners that the advantage of my approach is that it will give to<br />
farmers and pastoralists the security they are entitled to without the downsides of blanket<br />
extinguishment which would be more expensive, potentially unconstitutional and more divisive. And<br />
as I have the opportunity to go around Australia and explain to pastoralists the way my plan will work<br />
they will see that none of them can have their ownership threatened. None of them will be denied the<br />
opportunity to manage their properties without interference.<br />
SATTLER: But a lawyer, should they be rubbing their hands with glee at the profit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look, look, unfortunately the Native Title Act passed in 1993, which I voted against and my party<br />
voted against, created a lot of work for lawyers. The whole thing has created a lot of work for<br />
lawyers. But don't blame me for that. Don't blame my Government. 1 didn't write the Native hTile Act.<br />
It was written by my predecessor, Mr Keating. And it is an appallingly unworkable document and that<br />

is why we're trying to fix it up.<br />
SATTLER: Your next caller, I think from small business Prime Minister, good morning Bronlwyn.<br />
CALLER: Yes, good morning. Mr Howard you claim in the budget that you're helping small businesses, could<br />
you please explain to me why it appears that you're actually cutting places from new enterprise<br />
incentive schemes which is a government programme which helps place unemployed people in their<br />
own small business?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well You've got to talk... you've got to look at all these things we've done for small business and let me<br />
repeat themn. From the I1st of July this year there will be a<br />
$ 250 million injection through a major liberalisation of the capital gains tax system. It will mnean that<br />
anybody in small business who wants to expand their business can sell their existing one and up to<br />
mnillion of the proceeds of that sale will be completely free of capital gains tax. We have made changes<br />
to the industrial relations system. We've reduced the volume of paper work. We've reduced the<br />
provision tax uplift factor. So when you are talking about the totality of the things that we have done<br />
you have to take everything into account. And quite honestly, we believe the best way to help small<br />
business is to ease the conditions in which all small businesses operate.<br />
CALLER: Okay, that's really helping those that are already in small businesses. What about helping those...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well no, it's not only helping those that are in small business. Because if you have a climate of lower<br />
interest rates, if you know that if you take the punt and go into small business you can have a more<br />
benign capital gains tax system, if you know that if you take the punt and go into small business you<br />
can have a more flexible industrial relations system and you can have better flash flows, and if you<br />
know that as a result of this budget in relation to remittances to the Taxation Office of deductions<br />
you've made on account of taxation obligations of your employees you can hold on to your money for<br />
a couple of months, you will take all of those things into account because you will add them all Lip and<br />
you'll say to yourself well, the conditions for my taking the punt are better now than what they were a<br />
year ago. I'm just inviting you I mean, you can pick one isolated thing and say: why have you done<br />
that? But if you're really fair about our approach to small business, and I'm sure you are, you will look<br />
at the whole smorgasbord and you will acknowledge that we have tried for the 14 months we've been<br />
in office, at every turn, and our latest attempt is to further liberalise the unfair dismissal laws and I<br />
invite you to consider that. I mean, right at the moment the Senate is set to thwart an attempt to<br />
completely free every small business under federal awards fromn under 15 employees from the impact<br />
of the, any unfair dismissal laws. Now, the Senate is threatening to break to thwart that. So I just ask<br />
You to look at everything. Not just look at one isolated issue.<br />
SATTLER: And Prime Minister, are you going to take advantage of the Government's offer to work an extra five<br />
years after your normal retirement age? 06/ 30/ 97 17: 34: 16 </p>
<p>14M1a9 7littp://% vxvw. ila. gov. an/ pnic/ prcssrcl/ sattlcr2. htliI<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, well I think, I'm 57 now, well, I'll think about that. Come back to me in five or six years time. I<br />
know don't know if my wife would favour that. I think she would have something very strong to say<br />
about it.<br />
SATTLER: Do you think it will prompt many people to do that?<br />
PIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, 1 think it will prompt a number of people. But the important thing is It's a very important<br />
gesture towards choice. I mnean, what we're really saying is that we value people according to their<br />
worth and their capacity, not according to their age.<br />
SATTLER: Yeah, but is it going to create a logjam at the top of it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no it won't. That's a flirphy. I know some people are saying that but you know as well as I do that<br />
a person who's age 63 in an organisation and somebody's who's age 18 or 19, their jobs and their<br />
experience and their contributions are not interchangeable. They're really not. You can't really<br />
substitute them and any suggestion that you can falls to the ground if you look at each individual<br />
business. SATTLER: All right. Now, what have you got in store for us next year? Because a lot of people are saying you're<br />
just treading water in this budget.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, we're not how can you be treading water when You've laid down the circumstances for a surplus<br />
of $ 1.6 billion when you're repaying $ 5 billion of debt and you're creating the circumstances for low<br />
interest rates. That's not treading water. When you're announcing the best tax incentive for savings in<br />
97 years, when you've announced a federation fund that will pay for major infrastructure projects<br />
around Australia, that's not treading water. It is swimming fr-eestyle dramatically.<br />
SATTLER: Like our girl over there...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Indeed. It is swimming dramatically.<br />
SATTLER: Thanks for joining us on the programme today and I look forward to seeing you when you're coming<br />
over to Western Australia in the next month or two. 10 jj06/ 3107/: 9374: 16<br />
