<p>Your Eminence; your Grace; the Ambassador of Greece; the High Commissioner</p>
<p> for Cyprus; to the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr; to the former</p>
<p> Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam; to many other distinguished</p>
<p> guests including my colleague, the Minister for Immigration, Philip</p>
<p> Ruddock.</p>
<p>May I commence my remarks this afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, by</p>
<p> extending to my colleague, the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr,</p>
<p> my warmest congratulations on his re-election.</p>
<p>It ought not to be lost on this gathering, ladies and gentlemen, that</p>
<p> the first public occasion which I address in Sydney after my election</p>
<p> as the Prime Minister of Australia in March of 1996 was this very</p>
<p> same Greek National Day in that year.</p>
<p>May I say that the reception today is as warm as it was then. And</p>
<p> it will not be lost on those present that Bob Carr has chosen this</p>
<p> particular event as the first occasion to appear publicly after his</p>
<p> re-election as the Premier of New South Wales.</p>
<p>I want, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf, not only of the party that</p>
<p> I lead but also on behalf of the Australian Government and I know</p>
<p> all of the Australian people, to extend our gratitude to Australians</p>
<p> of Greek descent for the enormous contribution that they have made</p>
<p> to the building of the modern Australia.</p>
<p>The Greeks have brought many things to Australia and perhaps it is</p>
<p> appropriate that this event takes place immediately after a free,</p>
<p> democratic and open election because of all the many gifts that the</p>
<p> Greeks made to the world, the gift of democracy is undoubtedly the</p>
<p> greatest gift of all.</p>
<p>And we have just witnessed, as we witnessed last October, as we will</p>
<p> witness again in the years ahead, a peaceful, orderly expression of</p>
<p> democratic will, people putting their case to the public, people seeking</p>
<p> election and then peacefully and lawfully accepting the outcome. And</p>
<p> that is what Australia stands for and that is what Australia will</p>
<p> always stand for.</p>
<p>Australia is a remarkable amalgamation of people who have come from</p>
<p> many parts of the world and it would be unrealistic of me, ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen, to address this gathering at this time without acknowledging</p>
<p> that there are many thousands of Australians of Serbian descent who</p>
<p> have a concern about events that are taking place in their former</p>
<p> homeland. I understand that and that is perfectly human and a perfectly</p>
<p> natural reaction on their part.</p>
<p>Let me say that the great success of the modern Australia has been</p>
<p> our capacity to absorb people from all parts of the world who preserve</p>
<p> a love and a care and a sensitivity to their former homeland but at</p>
<p> the same time, over and above that, they have embraced the traditions</p>
<p> and the freedom and the values and the attitudes of their Australian</p>
<p> homeland which gives them peace, protection and succour. And however</p>
<p> much, however its strong feelings may run on events that are taking</p>
<p> place in the former Yugoslavia, can I say to you, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p> that the argument of the NATO countries is not with the people of</p>
<p> Serbia but rather the government of Serbia.</p>
<p>And, ladies and gentlemen, Australia has opened its doors and made</p>
<p> itself a home to people from everywhere around the world. And the</p>
<p> great success of that experiment and the great genius and the great</p>
<p> achievement of Australia is that our binding commitment to this nation,</p>
<p> respecting our diverse and multicultural heritage, that our binding</p>
<p> commitment to that nation and the values of that nation is the cement</p>
<p> which has bound all of us together. And in that process the people</p>
<p> of Greece have made a special contribution, not only their gift of</p>
<p> democracy, the way in which they have preserved and nurtured their</p>
<p> culture, their traditions, their religion, their family values, their</p>
<p> business values, their business principles and their great commitment</p>
<p> to communal life.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the people of Australia, all</p>
<p> the other Australians, I express my gratitude to the contribution</p>
<p> of the Greeks to the building of the modern Australia. Long may our</p>
<p> country remain a beacon to the rest of the world of freedom, of tolerance,</p>
<p> of racial and religious respect, a nation that truly honours the individual</p>
<p> and the role of the family in the Australian community and a nation</p>
<p> that practices, better than any in the world, that great gift of democracy</p>
<p> which came from the people of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
