TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE REMEMBRANCE DRIVEWAY CEREMONY, BASS HILL,<br />
1 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you for those very kind words, Major General Latchford. Could I<br />
recognise the Mayor, Councillor Max Parker, other distinguished members of<br />
the Council, my Parliamentary colleague, Doug Shedden, members of the<br />
Remembrance Driveway Committee and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here on this occasion. Indeed I have been<br />
delighted with the Australia Remembers ceremonies over the course of this<br />
year and I think it has been a good thing for our country, a good thing for the<br />
soul of the country, to remember those who fought for us and those who died<br />
for us. And, in doing this, we are saying that every Australian is special.<br />
Every Australian particularly who fought for the liberties that we enjoy and<br />
especially those who died for us. And that is why we are here to see this<br />
Remembrance Driveway extended and to make that memory clear.<br />
It is, I think, very poignant that this week we see this trouble in Sarajevo<br />
where the First World War really began 80 years ago, the same city. And it<br />
is a bit depressing to think that 80 years later, we are not free of these sorts<br />
of conflicts and it makes it very obvious that we are not because the conflict<br />
is in exactly the same place as it began. And we have spent most of this<br />
century scrambling out of it. The First World War, of course, saw carnage on<br />
a scale unequalled in human history and then it set up the conditions, of<br />
course, for the rise of Nazism in Europe and Fascism in Italy and, as a<br />
consequence, then with militarism in Japan we saw the Second World War.<br />
And I know that the presumption is, of course, for the victors that the<br />
righteous people won, the good guys won. But, of course, we nearly didn't<br />
win in Europe. Had Hitler invaded Britain in 1940, and had he emasculated<br />
the British Army in Dunkirk, we would have had great difficulty in getting a<br />
beach-head in Normandy or anywhere else in Europe. And had he not made<br />
the mistake of attacking the Russians who carried the war effort and the<br />
burden of the war, really, from 1941 to 1 944 then we would have seen a </p>
<p>different world in which Japan's expansionism may have been more profitable<br />
for them, though it would have taken time to build the United States military<br />
machine up. Countries, like Australia, would have been under even greater<br />
threats than in fact we finally were.<br />
So it would have been a different world and one can't say whether the<br />
democracies would have triumphed in the final analysis. In the Pacific,<br />
I think, we would. But, again, with a neutral Russia, one even wonders about<br />
that. One thing is for certain, there was great sacrifice made all the way through<br />
and we have enjoyed, now, 50 years of peace which is one of the longest<br />
periods certainly the longest period in this century. But one we rejoice in<br />
and one that we thank those who had to fight and, of course, who paid the<br />
greatest sacrifice of all.<br />
These are the things we remember and we want to teach our children about<br />
these things, that liberty always come with a price and the freedoms we have<br />
taken to be our own and are endemic to our way of life are not necessarily<br />
part of the way of life of many people around the world and that the price of<br />
liberty and freedom can often be an expensive one and many Australians<br />
have paid the price.<br />
The Second World War, of course, is the time when Australia's sovereignty<br />
was threatened. It wasn't threatened in the First World War, directly.<br />
It certainly was threatened, directly, in the Second World War and this was<br />
the fight to save Australia and Australia was saved, in part, by the gallantry of<br />
Australian servicemen and women, particularly in the campaigns in the<br />
Pacific, in Papua New Guinea where I am going in another week or so in<br />
places like Kokoda and, of course, before that in the Middle East and in<br />
Europe. So this was great conflict and I think that we make clear that for those who<br />
fought and died that it just had to mean something, that 50 years later it just<br />
shouldn't be something that has happened in the past which has scant<br />
attention paid to it. But that it had to mean something and that we remember,<br />
that we do remember these people and that our children will know about it<br />
and they will remember it too.<br />
So I remember the Remembrance Driveway as being begun in my youth<br />
because I used to motor around here not in a car, but on a bicycle past<br />
those trees and we were conscious then what they meant. We have been<br />
conscious since, probably not as conscious as we should be, but now of<br />
course our consciousness about it will be renewed by this new endeavour<br />
and stands of trees which are there to grace this area and to refresh our<br />
memory and to pay tribute to these people.<br />
I am particularly delighted that so many young Australians can be associated<br />
with this. The LEAP Program is a program which has seen part of the<br />
Greening of Australia right across the country. It has been done by young </p>
<p>people with enthusiasm, under the Commonwealth Department of<br />
Employment, Education and Training programs, and we thank them most<br />
sincerely for their efforts and for their dedication and underline the fact that<br />
this young generation of Australians have felt more poignantly the value of<br />
Australia's environment and its nature, than other generations before them<br />
have. And it is really to them we look for the preservation of this great<br />
continent we have been bequeathed, to keep it in the kind of environmental<br />
shape, to have respect and regard for it and to, perhaps, try and repair some<br />
of the thoughtless damage which has been done.<br />
Well here we are doing that to a dual purpose, to repair it, to replant it, but to<br />
do so in memory of the people who served and were lost. So this is a nice<br />
thing to do. I am delighted that the Committee has committed itself to this<br />
project. Also, I am very pleased that the Roads and Traffic Authority can be*<br />
involved. As is, of course, Bankstown City Council, which has always had I think a<br />
good social heart and a good understanding of these things. But always<br />
more importantly than all that, the community of this area which has always<br />
been quite a clannish community, one that has always felt a sense ofcommunity.<br />
And I think if the Second World War commemoration meant<br />
anything, they really celebrate community action because the things we<br />
always feel good about are the things we do together.<br />
And I suppose the biggest thing we have done together, as a nation, is:<br />
defend this country in the Second World War and it is that community action<br />
we remember and that we commemorate. Again, it is the community actionhere<br />
the community action by the Committee, and the young people, and.<br />
the Government, and the Council but it is the community action of thepeople<br />
of the area of Bankstown, which has in this case Bass Hill, which has<br />
of course always given support to community values and to community<br />
aspirations. So I am pleased to be back here. I used to drive down that road to thedrive-<br />
in theatre, years ago, when it used to be there and around these<br />
grounds on a bicycle. But they will always be special places to me. Morespecial<br />
because of the things we have done today. Congratulations and<br />
thanks. ends </p>
