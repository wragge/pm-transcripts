TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE -SYDNEY 12 January 1984<br />
PM4: W~ ell I'm sure that all Australians Will share my pleasure<br />
at th labour force statistics for the last molith of 1983,<br />
which confirm and strengthen the indications of strong<br />
economnic recovery, particularly in the employment area, which<br />
have ' been evident for some time now. Employment, of course<br />
we're talking in seasonally adjusted terms, which is agreed<br />
as what you have to do, employment increased by 32,000 in<br />
December and that followed a rise of almost 45,000 in November<br />
and in the event unemployment fell by 30,000 in December,<br />
Which brings the unemployment rate down to 9.254 from the<br />
9.6% in November. So, employment up very substantially,<br />
unemployment down, the unemployment rate down. If we put that<br />
into the period of this government it means that those<br />
December figures show that 3ince April of 19831 there's teen an<br />
increase of 159,000 jobs, or an average monthly increase in the<br />
period1 of our government of about 20,000, shows that the promise<br />
that I made to t-he people of Australia in the election campaign<br />
at all points, is being more than fulfilled. I said that we'd<br />
stop the explosion in unemployment, that has been dramatically<br />
achieved. I said we would incrtse employment, that has been<br />
dramatically achieved, about 159,000 new jobs. I indicated that<br />
we had an objective of creating half a million new jobs in the<br />
first 3 years of our government. Clearly we are well on track<br />
to achieving that objective, arnd I believe that, as I say, all<br />
Australians will velcome the fact that the Australian workforce<br />
in ge-neral, and our young people in particular, are now coming<br />
into 1984, into a much more optimistic economic scene than could<br />
possibly have been imagined 12 months ago.<br />
0: DD these figures give you any reason, Prime Minister, -to<br />
revise upwards or downwards the projected decreases or increases<br />
in unamployment and employment?<br />
* TIM: Yes, you will recall that when we brought in the budget,<br />
we were fairly cautious in our projections. We said then that<br />
there would be an increase we thought; of about 90,000 jobs in<br />
1983/ 84, well its quite clear that we are well above that figure<br />
of 90,000. We're running at about 130,000 now in the financial<br />
year so there's got to be a substantial upward revision in our<br />
assessment of the improvement in the employment situation, and<br />
there is no doubt that the assumptions that we made in drawing up<br />
our budget as to the level of outlays, that there would be for<br />
unemployment beneficiaries, will have to be revised downwards.<br />
There'll be a considerable budget saving in that item.<br />
Q: Hlow much do you attribute this success to your government's<br />
own performance, or to your govern~ ment's luck, such as the<br />
breaking of the drought and strengthening of the US e.-Onorny?<br />
PM: There are factors for which we are obviously responsible,<br />
others for which even in excessive enthusiasm, we can't claim<br />
responsibility. You've mentioned two of them, the breaking of<br />
the drought and the recovery in the United States economy, but </p>
<p>but the economic policies of this government have been largely<br />
responsible for the improvement in confidencu, the decline in<br />
industrial disputes. One very important sector of the economy<br />
cf course, is the housing industry, which is regarded by all<br />
economists as being of critical importance, not only in its<br />
own right, but it permeates out of the manufacturing industry<br />
and other areas. And its our policies in regard to housing<br />
which have lifted the industry from the doldrums that we<br />
inherited to the point where now, we are looking at the housing<br />
industry operating fairly close to its capacity. So we have<br />
a significant degree of responsibility and credit to be claimed<br />
for the improvement. I acknowledge, obviously, the beneficial<br />
effects as well, of the breaking of the drought and the overseas<br />
recovery. Q: Given that you expect now the revenues to be greater, does<br />
that mean that you'll be able to keep another of your election<br />
promises, which is to reduce taxes?<br />
PM: I've already said that my. objective is to do two things<br />
basically in the next budget, and I make a qualification in a<br />
moment, let me make it immediately, in that it won't be until<br />
February/ March that we have mere detailed figures about<br />
how the budget has been going and what the figures will be likely<br />
to be turning out at, but with that qualification, we'll be<br />
aiming to do two things, to have tax cuts, and to reduce the<br />
budget deficit so that we will be in a position that as the<br />
private sector recovers, as it is doing, the signs of it are<br />
occurring now, there's been significant employment growth in<br />
the private sector. As that happens, the private sector will be<br />
tending to make more demands on the capital market, so we'll be<br />
wanting to have less demands on the public sector, so we'll want<br />
to bring the deficit back. Those will be twin objectives of the<br />
budget. Q: Sir do you agree that figures like these today, create a more<br />
favourable environment for an early election?<br />
PK: Well its not a question of creating a favourable environment.<br />
We haven't been about, from the day we got in, thinking about<br />
the next election we've been about fulfilling the basic promise<br />
that I made in the campaign of turning the Australian economy<br />
around. Now manifestly we've achieved that. Now the position is<br />
that we will want to have a situation for Australians that we<br />
don't have a multiplicity of elections. There has to be a half-<br />
Senate election sometime between the middle of this year and the<br />
middle of next year. And if there were to be an election at the<br />
end of this year, early next year, that would not be unusual.<br />
That indeed, would be I think, the 22nd or the 23rd time at which<br />
the Australian people had gone to elections with a House of<br />
Representatives and half-Senate election. It would be unusual<br />
not to do it. But none of our policies to this point or between now<br />
and whenever the election is held, will be directed towards that end.<br />
Q: So there will be no early election?<br />
PM: I must be speaking a foreign language. I just said that if<br />
we did have an election this year or early next year, that would<br />
be the 22nd or 23rd time that that had occurred. That that would </p>
<p>3-<br />
bei a normal th-ing to do.<br />
Q Prime MLinister the latest word from Adelaide is that Premier<br />
Ba~ nnon has suggested that you might like to keep your hands out<br />
of politics in South Australia. Do you have any response to that<br />
iYL respect to the possibility of payrises for MPs in Adelaide?<br />
Pbl: That's surprising, because I've always found that John Bannon<br />
wEanted me to have my hands in politics in South Australia. When<br />
he was going for election last time hie couldn't have enough of<br />
my hands in South Australian politics.<br />
Q: Is there anything else you might be able to do to convince<br />
the South Australian and Tasmanian parliamentarians to accept a<br />
lower increase?<br />
P1: Well the constitutional facts are that the federal government<br />
does not have control over state governments, nor should it under<br />
our constitutional setup. All I've been wanting to convey to<br />
all the State Premiers, John Bannon included, and Mr Gray, the<br />
Liberal Premier in Tasmania, is that they as States have a vested<br />
irnterest in the Australian economy operating at its highest growth<br />
le-vels. Now we're going to do that the more that we keep the<br />
accord in place and have wage claims by the trade union movement<br />
kept in line with economic capacity. So they shouldn't regard<br />
th~ e holding and the tight holding of the accord as something which<br />
is irrelevant to them. it is very very relevant, and quite clearly,<br />
others in the workforce are going to look at parliamentarians if<br />
they perceive that parliamentarians are operating differently<br />
to them. And that's not going to be gocd for the accord. The accorC<br />
is not in any danger, despite the hopes of some people that it<br />
might crumble. But it does give ammunition to people. Now let me<br />
maka this clear, as I have to Mr Bannon. We are not saying that<br />
there may not be a case for a significant increase for them.<br />
Ncr are the ACTJ saying that. What they are saying is that they<br />
should follow the same processes as the -trade union movement is<br />
required, that is, the 4.3 percent national increase is there to<br />
be taken as an interim increase. And if they think they have<br />
special circumstances, then they should ask their tribunal to<br />
operate according to the same principles of determination as does<br />
the Commnonwealth Commission. And indeed I would believe that the<br />
ACTUI if the South Australian government would * pursue that course,<br />
would be prepared to even make submissions to such a tribunal, that<br />
there is a case for increases beyond the 4.3 percent. Now I believe<br />
that the State governments, all of them, should understand the<br />
inportance, from their own self-interest, in pursuing that course<br />
of action.<br />
0: Could this reflect on them at the Premiers' Conference?<br />
PM~: Well if they are going to undertake expenditures according<br />
to processes which are different to what the rest of the workforce<br />
follows, its something that I think would be raised.<br />
0: Is that a threat? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: No Of Course that's not a threat. Tts an answer to a<br />
question. No, no, quite spriousl~ die amounts of money involved<br />
are in the sum total of what we're talking about at Premiers<br />
Cc-nferences are miniscule. I mean the amount of money that<br />
will be involved in paying the increases a:: e relatively miniscule.<br />
Vit its a question of the influence they can have on the<br />
attitude of others. And I think that's important.<br />
Can we take it from your earlier comments about early elections<br />
and so on, that an early election is far more likely than not?<br />
P11: No, I'm not getting into this question of speculation.<br />
I simply refer you to the fact that we were planning to have<br />
a referendum and on terms and conditions that were made quite<br />
clear. our intentions on that which dealt with the issue of<br />
simultaneous elections. That intention uas deliberately frustrated<br />
by the Senate. Now during this year, we will have to look at<br />
the fact that those referendums can't be held and we ill have<br />
to look at the historical fact that the normal thing is for a<br />
half-Senate and House of Representatives election to be held<br />
together. That's much more the norral course of events. And<br />
I would tend to believe, without having made any commitment in<br />
this respect of all, I would tend to believe that the people of<br />
Australia, knowing that there's going to be a half-Senate election,<br />
there must be, under the Constitution, be a half-Senate election,<br />
sometime in the second half oZ this year or the early part of<br />
nex~ t year, that they would prefer, I would think, to not have<br />
two elections they'd rather have one the House of Representativ. es<br />
and the half-Senate together. But we'll think about this as we<br />
go along. But if we do make that decision, it will be one which<br />
is totally in accord with the normal historical practice in this<br />
country. 0: is there any possibility that you might put the referendum<br />
legislation back to the Senate for another go before then.<br />
PM: Oh they've had full opportunity to consider this, and they<br />
have decided to reject it. I wouldn't imagine we'd be going back<br />
to -them.<br />
Q: !? rime Minister, Mr Sinclair has reacted angrily to statements<br />
you made this morning. How do you react to those.<br />
PM: Oh well I regard it as a little bit strange that the man who<br />
has the reputation for being the biggest head-kicker of them all<br />
responds so volubly to some calm, en passant observations that<br />
I made. it seems to have upset him very seriously. He must be<br />
wondering whether he's got the numbers for this election he's got<br />
coming up next week.<br />
Q: Would you regard him as a threat in the future?<br />
PM: No.<br />
Q: When do you think would be an appropriate time for Mick Young's<br />
re-entry into the Cabinet? </p>
<p>PM: Oh well I would think we'll looking at that we've got<br />
to-wait until the ballot closes, I d~ on't think that's closed<br />
yet has it it's the end of this week, about the 20th, something<br />
like that. I don't imagine there'll be any other nominations.<br />
If there are not, then I would think it would make sense to have<br />
him back in well before the parliament resumes so that he can be<br />
qettinq across his portfolio. I would think, I haven't made a<br />
firm decision on this, but I would think about the end of this<br />
mronth. 0: Do you have a portfolio in mind for him?<br />
PM: Yes I have, but I think the appropriate time<br />
Care to share it with me?<br />
PMH; No, Mangos. J, no. Not at this stage.<br />
Q: Mr Hawke, tir Keating seems fairly confident that Zoreign<br />
banks will be granted licences, banking licences, after the<br />
Martin report, do you share that confidence?&gt;<br />
PM: Well I read Paul's.. the report of Paul's pleasant<br />
conversation with Mr Howard, and I think he indicated that this<br />
was a matter to be discussed within the Party. It will be<br />
and we'll await the outcome o~ f that discussion.<br />
Would you support the entry of foreign banks?<br />
PI: I'll indicate in the Party discussions what my view is.<br />
Do you think there's a need for more competition within the<br />
baLnking sector?<br />
PbM; Well I understand that there's a belief that competition<br />
is. a good thing, and I wouldn't have though,., Just looking at the<br />
history of Australian economics and politics that the Labor<br />
Party was greatly indebted to the existing private banks, I think<br />
if you look back to the Labor Governmrentsof Scullin, Chifley,<br />
and Whitlam, that the private banks weren't entirely unassociated<br />
with the demise of those governments. So T don't think that any<br />
of ray colleagues in the Labor Party should feel any great<br />
philosophical or idealogical commitment to maintaining the<br />
secured position of those particular banks. I mean I would find<br />
it surprising if any of my colleagues are coming into the Caucus<br />
with a great brief for those banks.<br />
Q: What are your immediate priorities now when you go back to<br />
Canberra? is there any prospect of having another economic summit?<br />
witbin the npyt tw~ lve months.<br />
PM: Oh no, I don't think within. the next? ( Twelve months.)<br />
No I haven't thought it necessary to think about another economic<br />
summit of that dimension. You will appreciate that we passed<br />
legislation to establish the economic planning advisory council,<br />
which continues in a ,, ense as a microcosm of the Summait, and I </p>
<p>-6-<br />
and my Ministers are in continuous consultation with the<br />
bus~ iness community and with the trade unions and with relevant<br />
organisations in the community. Now if there was a view, as<br />
19i14 went on, that somefsay lesser, dimension of meeting than<br />
the~ Swirit of April last year, would be useful, then we would<br />
be well disposed to it, but I haven't got. any current plans in<br />
that regard.<br />
Q: Is Mr Sinclair a threat to Mr Peacock?<br />
PM: Well I guess you'd have to ask Mr Peacock, but it's not<br />
really a battle of the titans, is it? </p>
