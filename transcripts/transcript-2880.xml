, U ST R LIA Press Statement No. 69<br />
3 April 1973<br />
FURLOUGH LONG SERVICE LEAVE<br />
Cabinet today decided that the basic qualification<br />
period for furlough in Australian Government employment<br />
will be reduced from 15 to 10 years.<br />
Pro rata furlough entitlement shall be payable to<br />
officers and employees on cessation after 5 years of service,<br />
providing that in cases where employment ceased through<br />
death, ill health, retrenchment or retirement on account of<br />
age, pro rata furlough entitlements shall be payable after<br />
one year of service.<br />
The accrual rate for furlough shall be three<br />
months for the first 10 years' service and half-a-month<br />
for each year thereafter.<br />
For the purpose of assessing the increased rates<br />
of accrual, ' service' will be calculated retrospectively<br />
to the date of commencing employment.<br />
Those now employed who have taken furlough will<br />
be granted their total furlough entitlement under the new<br />
provisions, less the period of furlough granted.<br />
Furlough will be availableto all employees<br />
including part-time employees and full-time employees employed<br />
for only part of each year.<br />
Officers and employees who had or have the necessary<br />
service with the Commonwealth on or after 1 January 1973<br />
shall be entitled to the new furlough entitlements regardless<br />
of whether they left its service before the passage of the<br />
amending legislation. Commonwealth staff who have transferred from Local<br />
Government bodies will enjoy the same furlough rights as<br />
are now enjoyed by staff who transferred from State Government<br />
into the Commonwealth Public Service.<br />
Legislation will be introduced as soon as possible<br />
to extend the new provisions to all Australian Government<br />
employees.<br />
