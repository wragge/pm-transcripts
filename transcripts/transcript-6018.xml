( Statement by the Pri. M! sDe the &amp; mt Hon lcolrn Fraser, O.<br />
and tYhe cro Rl5&amp; p 1, Hu. nt, M. P.)<br />
The Prime Sinister, Mr Halcolrn Fraser, arid the Minister fcor Transport<br />
and Construction, Mr Ralprj Hunt, today anncunced that the Cor" oW-alth<br />
would fund the electrification of' the Kin,; ston-Bee~ niqh rail line under<br />
the Australian Si1centerinial Road Develcpm. ent ( PSPD) Program an~ d tnat a<br />
contribution would also be rnade to the electrification of Pet; rle-<br />
Caboolture rail line.<br />
nThe Kingston-Seenleigh electrificaton is the first major urban pablic<br />
transport project to be approved under ABRD", they said.<br />
" it is widely recognilsed that urban public trans-port projects can play a<br />
vital. role in reducinq th. e preSsures cn urban arterial roads. For thls<br />
-reason~, the ABP-Program provldes support for urban public transport<br />
projects where such projects will clearly assist in r-educing traflfic or<br />
wear and tear on urban rov~" Mr Hunt ex'plained.<br />
" The electrification of most of the Brisbane subur-ban rail network had<br />
already attracted thousands of forn) er road users to the r'ail s'rstc. jj.<br />
' Th~ e Kingstcrn-Beenleigh project is a lo0gical extension of the network<br />
and willI service one of E-isba-&amp; es fastest grcwlnq rsidentia~, , industria<br />
and com~ nrcial ' re'et ric-Cabc) iire project is a fjrthir<br />
extension of the suoirban retwrk which alss: offers benefits to r: airline<br />
operations". </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" The early approval of the Kingston-Beenleigh project will enable<br />
initial tenders to be called immediately with completion scheduled for<br />
around the end of 1984".<br />
They also announced that ABRD funding would be provided for passenger<br />
interchange projects at a number of locations within the Brisbane area.<br />
Projects to be financed include car/ bus interchanges at Mt Gravatt<br />
( Garden City), Windsor ( Northey Street), and Toowong. Car/ rail transfer<br />
facilities will be developed or expanded at Yeronga, East Ipswich and<br />
Toombul. " The convenient ' park and ride' facilities which interchanges provide<br />
play an important part in enhancing the attractiveness of public<br />
transport usage-. We would envisage support being provided for r. any<br />
more of these facilities during the course of the Six Year ABRD Program",<br />
Mr Fraser and Mr Hunt said.<br />
-T total cost of these projects is estimated at $ 37M.<br />
