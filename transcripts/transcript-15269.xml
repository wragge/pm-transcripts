<p>The horse flu outbreak has had a devastating impact on horse dependent industries in New South Wales and Queensland - with Sydney's Spring Carnival scrapped, racing halted in Queensland and equestrian events on hold in both states.</p>
<p>My Government has been working closely with the industry to ensure that the people it supports - the vast bulk of whom earn modest incomes and work very hard - are supported during this difficult time.</p>
<p>This started with an initial $4 million assistance package which was increased by a further $110 million yesterday in recognition of the seriousness of the horse flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The new financial package includes business assistance grants of up to $5000, income support payments for workers who have lost their job or much of their income and special payments for those who have horses that usually compete or work but cannot due to quarantine restrictions.</p>
<p>A public inquiry into the cause of the horse flu outbreak has been announced and Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran will remain in close contact with the horse racing and horse-dependent industries to ensure the Australian Government is doing all it can to support this important industry.</p>
<p>It is disappointing that the New South Wales and Queensland Governments - who derive many millions of dollars from the horse racing industry - have so far refused to provide any meaningful help to those affected by horse flu.</p>
<p>The Federal Government's strong financial position enables it to provide generous assistance to industries affected by natural disasters. It is a dividend of our strong national economy.</p>
<p>I would hope that in the coming days the New South Wales and Queensland Governments are able to provide assistance packages of their own.</p>
