b TRANSCRIPT OF STATEMENT FOLLOWING TALKS WITH PRESIDENT MUBARAK<br />
KUBBEH PALACE, CAIRO 2 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I have had the' opportunity-of having-an extremely<br />
7 i nteresting._ discuss! on. wi rth ePresident.; And he has been<br />
generous enough to share with-me-his-views-about-the-processes,<br />
as he sees them, that will need to be involved in securing a<br />
resolution of the Israeli-Arab dispute. He also talked about<br />
other areas of conflict and problems in the region most<br />
particularly the Iraq-Iran war and the situation in Lebanon. I<br />
found myself in a very considerable degree of identity of opinion<br />
with the President and I am convinced, as I was in Jordan and<br />
Israel, that here in Egypt there is a total commitment to trying<br />
to accelerate the processes of peace so that out of those<br />
processes peace in the region can be obtained and not merely a<br />
peace which will be formal but one from which can grow greater<br />
degrees of co-operation which will ensure that the economic and<br />
social interests-of people -i-n-the-region can be advanced. As far<br />
as relations between Egypt and Australia are concerned we talked<br />
of a number of matters of mutual concern. I repeated to the<br />
President my interest in trying to ensure that there would be an<br />
increase in the economic and cultural and social relationships<br />
between us and the President agreed with me in this respect.<br />
Finally, I am very pleased to say that I issued an invitation to<br />
President Mubarak to visit Australia and he has graciously<br />
accepted that invitation. And it will be a matter now for<br />
discussion at official level to when he will be able to take up<br />
that invitation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, concerning the Palestinian issue<br />
do you support an independent Palestinian State?<br />
PM: What the position of Australia is on that, as I have said<br />
before and I will repeat again here, is that we believe that an<br />
essential element of the resolution the Israeli-Arab dispute is a<br />
resolution of the Palestinian problem. We recognise the rights<br />
of the Palestinians to self-determination and we have said<br />
including the right if they were to so decide an independent<br />
state. All the discussions that I have had in the region,<br />
including the discussions I have had here, the discussions today,<br />
show me that that is not looked upon as the most likely or the<br />
most appropriate outcome; that it would be neither politically or<br />
economically viable as it's put and that the most likely and most<br />
appropriate outcome of those processes, discussion and<br />
self-determination would involve the confederation of the<br />
Palestinian people with the State of Jordan. </p>
<p>2<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible question<br />
PM: No, what has happened is that gratification has been<br />
expressed for our interest and for the information that I have<br />
been able to convey form Jordan to Israel, Israel to here. And I<br />
have simply said as I have said from the outset if there is any<br />
way however small in which we can be of assistance then we are<br />
prepared to be. And that has been ' welcomed but there are no<br />
specific projects which are on the plate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Jordan, Israel and Egypt are you now convinced<br />
tha~ Tttere is a wil ingness b~ eqeiVffThe two parties t-if6dd a<br />
international conference on the Middle East?<br />
PM: Let's pick up the elements obviously Jordan and Egypt-are at<br />
one on wantingA!; qhold an international conference. _ But let's<br />
make it clear that they are at one also-in their perception onthe<br />
role of that conference. Neither Jordan nor Egypt sees the<br />
international conference as being the medium for settling the<br />
dispute. They see it as providing a framework within which the<br />
necessary negotiations would take place between the parties. And<br />
that's a common position between Jordan and Egypt. And as far as<br />
Israel is concerned you know that Mr Peres negotiated a position<br />
with President Mubarak at Alexandria. He adheres to that<br />
position. And there is, as you know, some apparent disagreement<br />
which has been made public between Mr Peres and the Prime<br />
Minister but as far as Mr Peres, who negotiated that<br />
understanding with Egypt, is concerned he is clearly adhering to<br />
it.-So when-you take all-those--fa-ctors in-account there-is<br />
very considerable degree of common ground in the region on this<br />
issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what have you got out of this trip?<br />
PM: What ha-ve I got-out of it? -i h-ave got the unique___<br />
opportunity and privilege of having being given from Jordan and<br />
Israel and Egypt the most comprehensive exposition of their<br />
thinking, of their exponation of the issues that are involved and<br />
how they see the possible processes working to bring about a<br />
resolution of the Israeli-Arab dispute. I think I am fairly<br />
uniquely placed now in having been given that opportunity I<br />
appreciate it very much. It certainly means that Australia and<br />
the Australian Government is better informed on this issue.<br />
Because we have the confidence of the states immediately<br />
concerned I think we will now continue to be kept informed and as<br />
I say without any exaggeration of our position it will be the<br />
case that if there is any suggestion made to us as to the ways in<br />
which we maybe able to be of some assistance than we are<br />
certainly now much better placed to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can we say that you are very'near to acknowledging<br />
PLO officially now?<br />
PM: It is not a question of being close to acknowledging PLO<br />
officially now. Let me just take a couple of minutes on that.<br />
The position of the Australian Government, and I think<br />
overwhelmingly the Australian people, is that we would not<br />
officially recognise the PLO-while they don't-recognise-the-right </p>
<p>3<br />
of Israel to exist. We have said that we see the capacity of the<br />
PLO to have an important role in the processes of resolving<br />
important issues in this region, that their capacity to exercise<br />
that role will be a function of their readiness to recognise<br />
Israel. And I have said before, those travelling with me have<br />
heard it before, I don't want to take a great deal of time in<br />
putting the point again, but very simply I have expressed the<br />
view that I think the reality is that the PLO now does accept<br />
that Israel exists. Obviously and further than that, that they<br />
accept that Israel is going to continue to exist. I think that<br />
is the reality Unfortunately, the formal expression from the<br />
PLO doesn't match that reality. On the part of Israel, equally,<br />
I think they understand that there is a representative capacity<br />
in--the PLO-and -so--what -seems-to -me to be the-desirable thi-ng,-<br />
both for the PLO, fbr Israel; the-Palestinian people, the states<br />
i-n-the-region,--is.-that--those-realities that I referred to should<br />
be reflected in formal statements. And as far as we are<br />
concerned if the PLO is to adopt the position of saying ' yes we<br />
accept 242, 338 the right of Israel to exist, the repudiation<br />
of terror'. If the PLO says those things than you will have no<br />
trouble as far as Australia is concerned and more importantly<br />
there will also in those circumstances be an obligation on Israel<br />
to accept the PLO as part of the negotiating processes.<br />
