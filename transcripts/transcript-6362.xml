PARTIAL TPUNNSCRIPT, i'ji. jA, 6YDNEY, 11 APRIL 1* 984<br />
sexist parts.. It's not Australia's sons let us rejoice,<br />
it's Australians let us all rejoice and I was perhaps a little<br />
bit pe~ remptory, but after hearing that beautiful rendition I ju~ ot.<br />
couldn't help myself.<br />
JOURNALIST: You were guilty of a Cabinet leak were you?<br />
I was amazed that it hadn't occurred before, it's such<br />
an important item. The-Special Minister of State will be<br />
conferring with the Governor-General about it. God Save the<br />
Queen will be kept as the royal anthem when the Queen is present.<br />
JOURNALIST: referendum.<br />
It didn't have anything to do with a referendum. we just<br />
believed it was time to do this. At the OlIympics I understand<br />
Advance Australia Fair will be used there as it should be and<br />
I think it's just something that the overwhelming majority<br />
of Australians will think is appropriate.<br />
JOURNALIST: And the overwhelming majority of Cabinet.<br />
I think it was a unanimous decision, like most of our<br />
decisions. JOURNALIST: Is this decision imimediate?<br />
Well, the Special Minister of State will be conferring<br />
with the Governor-General as a matter of courtesy and then<br />
the appropriate arrangements will have to be made, people<br />
will be informed, but it's being put into effect as of now..<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect much opposition?<br />
No, not at all. Why should anyone be opposed to Advance<br />
Australia Fair.<br />
JOURNALIST: The R. S. L. probably would.<br />
No, I don't think so. . Their feelings are perhaps more<br />
about the. flag. we've made no CuaQlij onf Lhat.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you discussed it in Cabinet?<br />
Yes we have just decided that there is more time for<br />
discussion needed in the comamunity. There are deeper feelings<br />
about that and I respect them because you have people who<br />
have fought under the existing flag, who have had relatives<br />
that have died and that arouses deep feelings and emotions.<br />
So there is no intention to move precipitately in that area. / 2 </p>
<p>P. M. corit...: But the question of having our own national<br />
anthem is very important. I mean I have found it just<br />
appalling that at previous Olympics, for instance, that you<br />
have the Brits getting up, they win a medal you know they<br />
win one occasionally God Save the Queen, and Australians<br />
getting up and they play the same anthem. Now that's crazy.<br />
JOURNALIST:( inaudible Waltzing Matilda)<br />
Nope. It's a great song, a great part of Australian<br />
tradition# particularly when you are overseas and people want<br />
you to give an Australian item and they expect you to sing<br />
Waltzing Matilda but it's not the most appropriate for-our<br />
national anthem.<br />
JOURNALIST: The sexist aspect of the lyrics -is ' that the oniX<br />
thing that's going to be modified,<br />
Yes,. 2 or 3 things that have been modi fied to take account<br />
of that. That is the first line. I foreget the other two.<br />
I haven't got the exact words now.<br />
JOURNALIST: all Australians to learn the notes I am<br />
sure not everya* woull know the 7: cOtds to Advance Australia Fair?<br />
Yes, as long as the Prime Minister didn't lead by singing<br />
them because that would certainly lose votes. galore.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you know the lyrics Mr Hawke?<br />
Yes, didn't you watch me singing them?<br />
JOURNALIST: Were there any other options given to Cabinet Whet imiht be<br />
a national anthem or was that the only choice?<br />
That was the one that was chosen. 4i the opportunity<br />
of suggesting Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport instead that perhaps<br />
recommended itself to them but there was a great feeling that<br />
Advance Australia Fair was appropriate. </p>
