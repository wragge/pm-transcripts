    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>9 October 1983</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Government will spend more than $5.5 million forÂ roads in the Townsville area this financial year.</p>
<p>The expenditure to replace narrnw bridges and improve roadsÂ throughout the city fulfils another pre-election promise.</p>
<ul><li>Specific projects in the roads program this financial yearÂ include: replacing the narrow Rollingstone Creek Bridge ($1.9Â million)</li>
<li>reconstructing the Giru turn-off on the Bruce HighwayÂ to Palm Creek $1.8Â million)</li>
<li>replacing the narrow Waterview Creek Bridge on theÂ Bruce Highway($ 600,000)</li>
<li>reconstructing Hamell Street ($ 181,000)</li>
<li>about $ 65 million is to be spent up to 1988 upgradingÂ the Bruce Highway.</li>
</ul><p>Funds for Townsville are part of a road program for QueenslandÂ which will cost the Commonwealth $ 2712.4 million this financialÂ year.</p>
<p>This represents an increase of 51.3 per cent overall includingÂ an increase of 60 per cent for local roads.</p>
<p>Before the last election, we promised to upgrade the BruceÂ Highway and to improve local roads.</p>
<p>The Federal Government is now providing the funds to do that.</p>
<p>Other North Queensland commitments we are implementing includeÂ constructing the Burdekin Dam, building a new CommonwealthÂ Government Centre in Townsville, building a new domestic terminalÂ <br />at Townsville airport, aid to the sugar industry and a seriesÂ of measures to boost tourism in North Queensland.</p>
<p>Keith Wright has released a comprohensive and impressive set ofÂ policies for North Queensland.</p>
<p>I have no doubt lhe will be scrupulous in implementing thoseÂ commitments. I look forward to working closely with Keith Wright as PremierÂ to ensure North Queensland fully realises the enormous potential<br />it has for growth and development.</p>
