PRIME Mh<br />
AINISTE<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 OCTOBER 1990<br />
I have today sent the following message to Australians in<br />
Iraq and Kuwait:<br />
At this time of great dif ficulty f or all of you detained<br />
against your will in Kuwait and Iraq, I want you to know<br />
that my symnpathies and those of the Australian Government<br />
and people are constantly with you. I have been<br />
following closely the situation on the ground in Kuwait<br />
and Iraq from the reports of embassy officers in the<br />
region. As you know., Australia has joined the international<br />
community in deploring Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and in<br />
taking concrete measures to reverse its aggression. The<br />
naval commitment we have made to the Multinational Force<br />
is an important part of the United Nations efforts to<br />
respond to the occupation of Kuwait, to secure Iraq's<br />
withdrawal and to ensure that foreign nationals held<br />
against their will are released. It is endorsed by the<br />
overwhelming majority of nations.<br />
I want to assure you that your welfare and that of your<br />
families is very much on my mind and that of my<br />
colleagues in the Government. Our efforts to secure your<br />
freedom and to end the anguish that the current situation<br />
is causing you and your families will continue. The<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working<br />
actively and effectively to protect the welfare of all<br />
Australians in the region, and I think you will agree<br />
with me that their efforts to date have been commendable.<br />
As well as our efforts in Iraq and Kuwait, we will be<br />
doing our best to protect your interests and those of<br />
your families in Australia. On your behalf, I will be<br />
publicly calling on financial and other organisations in<br />
Australia to be fair and sympathetic in financial<br />
dealings which affect you. The Government will be happy<br />
to deal with any particular problems brought to our<br />
attention by your families and friends. In particular,<br />
we will consider sympathetically specific requests for<br />
assistance from any of your dependents who are in<br />
situations of particular need. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I do not underestimate the difficulties you face. The<br />
situation in Iraq and Kuwait is obviously tense and may<br />
worsen. But I know that your courage, determination and<br />
good sense will stand you in good stead as you bear up to<br />
these challenges. Australians have always been at their<br />
best with their backs against the wall, and I know that<br />
you too will find ways to endure the current crisis.<br />
Finally, I want to make clear to you personally that no<br />
matter how long this painful business takes, I and my<br />
Ministers have your welfare as a focus of our efforts,<br />
and your safe return to Australia our firmest hope. </p>
