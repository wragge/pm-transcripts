STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, Tit E HON P J KEATING, MVl<br />
EPAC TASK FORCE ON FUTURE CHILD CARE PROVISION IN<br />
AUSTRALIA Today I have asked EPAC, the Economic Planning Advisory Commission, to establish<br />
a task force to investigate and report on child care provision in Aus~ tralia.<br />
Child care is cnicially important in Australia's economic and social development. It<br />
influences decisions about participation in the workforce, it provides parents with the<br />
opportunity to undertake education, training and other activities; and it gives children<br />
broader experiences which help their social, physical and intellectual development,<br />
Changing work patterns and family arrangements mean that a constructive and<br />
forward-looking review for child-care provision is timely.<br />
We need a child care program that delivers the services that Australian families need<br />
while, at the same time, involving predictable Commonwealth outlays and appropriate<br />
linkages of Commionwealth, State, community and private sector services. Child care<br />
services are also an integral part of the Government's approach to building a highly<br />
skilled and adaptable workforce, as demonstrated by our commitment to mect the<br />
demand for work-related child care by the year 2001.<br />
The Government has already made significant progress towards meeting these goals.<br />
By the end of March 1995, there were 262,500 Commonwealth funded child care<br />
places against a target of 300,000 places by 1996-97. The Minister for Family<br />
Services, Senator Rosemary Crowley, is also overseeing the development of innovative<br />
services, especially in rural areas, and the introduction of the Quality Improvement and<br />
Accreditation System. Better coordinated and more flex~ ible child care services are<br />
also on the agenda of the Council of Australian Governents.<br />
The work of the EPAC task force will complement other work being undertaken. It<br />
will have a mediumn to long-term foctis. While not ignoring current problems and<br />
challenges, the aim will be to set directions for the futuire which will best suit<br />
Australia's economic and social needs,<br />
Given this focus, the EPAC task force will investigate and report on the prospective<br />
demand for child care, best practice in the provision of child care, and the links<br />
between the provision of child care and other children's and family services. </p>

TJERNS OF REFERENCE<br />
EPAC TASK FORCE ON FUTURE CHILD CARE PROVISION<br />
Having regard to the Government's child care policy, including its commitment to incct<br />
the demnand for work-rclated child care by 200 1, EPAC will establish a Task Force to<br />
investigate and report on the prospective demand for child care, best practice in the<br />
provision of child carec, and the links between the provision of child care and other<br />
children's and family services.<br />
For the purposes of the inquiry and report, the focus will be on the provision of paid<br />
child care for children aged 12 years and under by persons other than the immediate<br />
family of the child.<br />
In reporting on these matters, the Trask Force will focus on:-<br />
prospective devclopmnents in family formation, labour force participation and<br />
job patcerns, and the implications of these and related developments for the<br />
demand for child care;<br />
best practice in the provision of child care in each of the sectors of famnily day<br />
care, long day care, outside school hours care and occasional care as evidenced<br />
by examples in both the community aild private sectors in Australia and<br />
overseas; possible futurc structures and trends inl provision of child care and the impact<br />
of government policies on availability, pricing and quality of various forms of<br />
child care;,<br />
medium to long-term goals and mechanisms for child care provision and for the<br />
appropriate linkages of child care and children's services; and<br />
the relationships between suppliers of child care services, families who use child<br />
care services, budget holders in the sector and regulators, and desirable<br />
changes to these inl the medium to long-term.<br />
The Task Force is to have regard to findings of the Law Reform Commission Report<br />
Child C'are for Kids, the Auditor-General's efficiency audit report Mind the Children,<br />
and the Report of' the National Council for the International Year of the Family.<br />
The Task Force is also to have regard to measures already taken by the<br />
Commonwcalth in recent Budgets and by governments as part of the COAG reviewv of<br />
WcomMUnity services provision.<br />
The Task Force is to report to thc Government by the end of July 1996.<br />
The Task Force's findings will be released by the Government and used inl the<br />
Governent's subsequent discussions with the States and the community on this<br />
subject. </p>
<p>TEL:<br />
The report of the task force will therefore assist governments in planning to meet<br />
demand for child care in the future. It will aid both governments and child care<br />
pruvidcisL ill Udciasiiin mid iiii0vl'aitii tlv best and most efictient forms of child<br />
care. It will address problems of coordination in delivery that too often confront users<br />
of family and children's services.<br />
The task force will comprise Patricia Faulkner ( Chair), Bruce Hartnett, Wendy<br />
McCarthy AO, and Glenn Withers AU ( ex-oflicio). A small secretariat for the task<br />
force will operate within EPAC. The terms of reference for the task force and<br />
information on its members are attached.<br />

February 1996. It will report its findings to the Government by July 1996.<br />
