ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr E. G.<br />
Whitlam, today issued the following statement.<br />
" Australia and the People's Republic of China have reached<br />
agreement on mutual recognition and the establishment of diplomatic<br />
relations. I announced on 5 December that I had instructed our Ambassador<br />
in Paris to open negotiations with his Chinese colleague on this matter.<br />
These negotiations have been successful, and the two Ambassadors signed<br />
the attached joint communique at our Ambassador's residence in Paris on<br />
21 December at 9 p. m. ( 7 a. m. on 22 December Canberra time).<br />
It has long been the objective of the Australian Labor Party<br />
to establish diplomatic relations between Australia and the People's<br />
Republic of China. It accordingly gives me great satisfaction to announce<br />
* that this important step has now been taken.<br />
While it has long been recognised that Australia's geographical<br />
position gives it special interests in the Asian region, up until now we<br />
have not come to terms with one of the central facts of that region, the<br />
People's Republic of China. This serious distortion in our foreign policy<br />
has now been corrected.<br />
We have recognised the Government of the People's Republic of<br />
China as the sole legal government of China. It follows that we can give<br />
no recognition to others claiming to be the Government of China. Chinese<br />
policies on both sides of the Taiwan Straits required us, as they have / 2 </p>
<p>required other governments in a similar position, to make a choice in this<br />
matter. We have made the choice which we believe will best serve the<br />
interests of Australia. It is also the choice that has been made by<br />
the United Nations.<br />
Our diplomatic relations with Taiwan came to an end with the<br />
signing of the communique in Paris. It is consequently necessary that<br />
Australian official representation in Taipei, and Taiwan's official<br />
representation in Australia, be vwithdrawn. This will be done before<br />
January 1973, as noted in the communique.<br />
We now look forward to the growth of a more substantial<br />
relationship between Australia and China. I conveyed this hope in<br />
the attached message to Premier Chou En-lai which was passed to him<br />
through the Chinese Ambassador in Paris on 6 December ( Paris time).<br />
Premier Chou responded to this message on 10 December, ( Text attached.)<br />
I am gratified that Premier Chou has reciprocated my wish for a more<br />
substantial relationship and that he has identified some fields of<br />
future cooperation." </p>
