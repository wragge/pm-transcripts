AUSTRALIA<br />
I PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 15 February 1976<br />
VISIT TO NEW SOUTH WALES FLOODS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, visited flood<br />
stricken areas of north western New South Wales today.<br />
The Prime Minister was accompanied by Mrs Fraser, and<br />
by the Minister for Health, Ralph Hunt and the Deputy<br />
Director General of the Natural Disasters Organisation,<br />
Mr. R. Vardanega.<br />
He visited Moree and Walgett, where he talked with local<br />
government officials and with representatives of the NSW<br />
State Emergency Service.<br />
Mr Fraser's aircraft, an R. A. A. F. HS 748, overflew the<br />
flood areas of the North West at an altitude of about<br />
500 feet.<br />
The aerial tour ranged over Goondiwindi, Mungindi,<br />
Bogabilla, Collarenebri, Boomi and Wee Waa.<br />
About one third of the houses in Moree were entered by<br />
floodwaters, which are now receding. Mr Fraser toured<br />
Moree and talked with townspeople whose houses had been flooded.<br />
In Walgett, the town is readying itself for the full force of<br />
the floodwaters which have not yet arrived.<br />
Officials say that stock losses in the North West are extensive.<br />
Although no figures have yet been worked out, sheep losses<br />
are described as huge and cattle losses as drastic.<br />
Flying over the area, the Prime Minister saw flooding extending<br />
to the horizon, cattle and sheep huddled on high ground or<br />
standing in floodwaters, and the bodies of sheep, washed<br />
against fences.<br />
Mr Fraser said emergency services appeared to be working<br />
satisfactorily, although he would be taking upmatters raised<br />
with him.<br />
They concerned the question of an emergency-bridge to link<br />
Walgett with Lightning Ridge, improving the airstrips<br />
at Moree and Walgett, and of the cost of fodder airlifted<br />
to floodbound properties. </p>
<p>mr Fra-ser said the Commonwealth would be participating fully<br />
with the States in the relief measures being undertaken<br />
a:Ã± d the reconstruction which T; ould be necessary.<br />
He said in the past assistance had been available for<br />
the relief of personal Ciardship, to help local government<br />
with public works, and in the form of loans to farmers<br />
at concessional rates of interest.<br />
He said a decision would be made quickly on the question of<br />
fodder drops for starving stock.<br />
In the past farmers had paid the full cost of the hay: with<br />
delivery by air drop being provided as a relief measure.<br />
However, the current high cost of fodder, combined with<br />
low returns from livestock, indicated that this might not be<br />
sufficient during the current floods. </p>
