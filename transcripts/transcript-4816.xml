PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 13 SEPTEMBER, 1978<br />
I14TERVIEW W1ITH MICHELLE GRATTAN,<br />
THE AGE<br />
QUESTION: Let's start on the employment area. You've emphasised the<br />
need to continue to bear down on inflation as the only way<br />
to eventually get unemployment down. Given that policy,<br />
do you believe that unemployment will be less than it is<br />
now in firstly ayears time, or secondly, two years time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think you can put a time scale on these particular<br />
things. It's possible to say that unemployment is going<br />
to fall throughout this year and it has but we have had<br />
less success than we would have wanted in getting a balance<br />
between wages and profits. You've got the figures now for<br />
the last financial year where average weekly earnings went<br />
up a bit more than the Consumer Price Index which doesn't<br />
really indicate much restraint on the part of wage claims<br />
or on the part of decisions by the Arbitration Commission.<br />
. Against that background, there's not the slightest doubt<br />
people are being kept out of jobs by the continued high<br />
level of wages. Now, forces working in the other direction;<br />
our inflation rate is now well below the OECD average, ours<br />
is going down. A number of other important countries are<br />
going up. Most of our major trading partners, with Japan<br />
and Germany as exceptions, their inflation is getting worse.<br />
So our industries are becoming more competitive. They'll<br />
be getting a larger share of domestic markets. They'll be<br />
able to move into export markets. Quite often I'm now<br />
getting reports of people being able to sell overseas.<br />
Only the other day; a Western Australian firm is selling fishing<br />
boats overseas very successfully has done so for up to<br />
half a dozen countries.<br />
QUESTION: But given all that you wouldn't put a time on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I don't put a time on it because you can't tell how quickly<br />
these forces are going to work. Our policies will be<br />
successful. Wage decisions have a capacity to speed up the<br />
process or to slow it down. I don't think they've got the<br />
capacity to frustrate it completely because I don't think<br />
the wage decisions would not be as bad as that. I think what<br />
we have to do is to show a very real concern for those who<br />
are finding it difficult to get jobs with the various training<br />
schemes, the various employment schemes. I am disturbed<br />
that under the training schemes, information since Question<br />
Time, has indicated that a number of State GIovernments may<br />
not be keeping their people on in employment after the<br />
training period. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
I believe that Governments have got an obligation to<br />
set an example in that area. Now we're trying to get<br />
the more precise facts about it. Against the situation<br />
which we had to face, there was clearly no quick<br />
solution. The only other point that I would want to<br />
make is that the Secretariat of the General Agreement<br />
on Tariffs and Trade, in its Annual Report, has in the<br />
last week put out a resounding endorsement of the<br />
Government's policy and basically indicated that other<br />
policies are doomed to failure.<br />
QUESTION: Two specific questions on unemployment. Do you believe<br />
that unemployed young people should be partially supported<br />
by their families and is this what is behind the freezing<br />
of the unemployment benefits for single people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think there are family obligations. I don't believe<br />
somebody should leave school and expect to get unemployment<br />
benefits the next day. I think there are forces in the<br />
society which are intended to weaken family obligations and<br />
I think that's important that that should not continue.<br />
While there are young people who want jobs, who try to<br />
get jobs and find it difficult, we also know that there are<br />
other young people who band together and abuse the system,<br />
don't really try all that hard to get jobs. I think any<br />
employer, at one stage or another, has run across some of<br />
these young people. The higher the level of unemployment<br />
benefits are obviously the greater inducement is to that<br />
latter category to go on abusing the system.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
Again on the young people. Many economists say that minimum<br />
wage rates, and especially for teenagers, are stopping job<br />
growth. Is there any way to free up the ability of teenagers<br />
to get work, at least at the normal wage rates?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's very hard when you've got workers' compensation by<br />
State law . You've got 17% holiday loading. You've<br />
got a very strict system of awards in Australia and very<br />
heavy penalties on employers who breach those laws.<br />
QUESTION: You've considered putting this to the Arbitration Commissioner<br />
at various times...<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
We've considered making special cases in relation to young<br />
people. ( Inaud... ).. well I think one of the things which<br />
might have a greater impact than the suggestion you've made<br />
is if we could get a change in the penalty rate policy. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
I think this enormously hard. Again, because it is<br />
entrenched in awards. If for example, in the tourist industry,<br />
you could get to a situation in which people could be<br />
employed for every five out of seven days in a week there was<br />
an award for that, for the tourist industry, that the amount<br />
of trade and traffic that's been lost because of the<br />
penalty rates on weekends which cause restaurants to shut<br />
down... QUESTION: This applies to more than just young people.<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER:<br />
Yes I know, but it's one of the things that's inhibiting<br />
jobs. It's one of the things that's damaged employment<br />
prospects in general and...<br />
QUESTION: How could you go about getting such a change. Would you<br />
consider putting that in a submission?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There is a good deal of work.. there is a Parliamentary Coimittee of<br />
Inquiry into Tour ism. I think a good deal has been going into<br />
trying to get to educate people to some of the causes and<br />
what might be done to overcome it. You'd be well aware of<br />
the difficulties in getting an entrenched award radically<br />
altered. This is one of avenues that industries, unions<br />
and Government ought to pursue.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that the Federal Government may set some example<br />
in arguing that cause. I haven't heard you argue it before...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think I've been asked the question that-way before.<br />
Let me just say that's it's one of the matters that we are<br />
examining. It's sometimes easy to point to solutions because<br />
of the entrenched nature of awards and the wage fixing process<br />
in Australia and also because of the conservative attitude<br />
of a number of trade unions to these particular matters.<br />
Getting a significant change is very difficult.<br />
QUESTION: Turning to some of the criticisms that have been made of<br />
the Government. Do you think that the Victorian Government's<br />
attacks on the Federal Government, for example, over<br />
unemployment and over wage indexations, are simply pre-election<br />
politicing or do they represent a real philosophic difference? / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think there is A real philosophic difference because<br />
Mr. Hamrer has gone out of his way to tell me that he supports<br />
the thrust and purpose in generality of the Government's<br />
economic policicies, on many occasions.<br />
QUESTION: And yet he and his Ministers have been quite critical<br />
of those matters.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I wouldn't have thoughtso.<br />
QUESTION: They were answered fairly solidly for example, on wage<br />
indexation. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
on wage indexation? But the Premier had spoken to me about<br />
this and I think he conceded in that conversation that<br />
hearings every three months was too frequent. We needed to<br />
get hearings set further apart than that. I think he might<br />
have felt that 12 monthly hearings would be too far apart.<br />
QUESTION: What about on unemployment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But again if he supported the generality of our policies<br />
there can't be a great deal of difference even in that area<br />
and he has made it very plain that he does support the<br />
generality of our policies. One of the things that needs<br />
to be understood is that Commonwealth and States do have<br />
a responsibility to the same people, that they do have a<br />
different role. Whether we like it or not, responsibility<br />
for overall economic management is on our shoulders. We'll<br />
be blamed or we will be praised for the result. Overall<br />
economic management is not one of the responsibilities that<br />
gets sheeted home to the States, even though they can<br />
contribute to a better result or they can contribute to<br />
a worse result. Against that background, and because of<br />
the different responsibilities it's one of the reasons for<br />
example, why a Grand Conference is rather a difficult thing<br />
to achieve in a sensible and sane manner. If you could get<br />
everyone going to a conference quietly, without publicity,<br />
commited to overcoming problems, I think there would be a<br />
very useful exchange of views. But when I read about a<br />
conference in the newspapers, rather than in a more personal<br />
approach by telephone or discussion, or whateverfrflMr. Harer-<br />
. Mr. Wran is going tolave an election, a Federal Conference<br />
Mr. Wran would certainly use it for political purposes as hard asli.<br />
could go and conferences in that broader sense tend to become<br />
political forums rather than forums which will contribute<br />
to a meaningful result. Now that's why this Government is </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
trying to structure consultation and meetings which take<br />
place on a regular basis which enable anyone's ideas<br />
to come forward to us, whether it is from trade unions,<br />
or whether it is from government. You've got the National<br />
Labour Consultative Council which our predecessors abandoned,<br />
sacked. They wouldn't have that sort of regular consultation.<br />
You've got the Labour Ministers meetings, you've got the<br />
Premier's Conferences which take place I think more frequently<br />
over the last three years than in previous times. In all of<br />
these arenas, it is open to people to put forward their<br />
ideas and to interchange ideas. We have pre-Budget<br />
consultations. It might be unfair because I think he was<br />
away, but this year, and Mr. Hawke wasn't here, but the ACTU<br />
was represented and whatever views they had were put to us.<br />
Now they are only some of the consultative mechanisms that<br />
we pursue. If any one of the groups in regular consultation<br />
with us were not in regular consultation has specific views<br />
that are going to be useful, they can put those very views<br />
and that's constructive. That's something we would welcome.<br />
It's quite different saying ' let's have a conference' when you<br />
dont know what views are going to be put.<br />
QUESTION: I think you've made that point fairly thoroughly.<br />
A quite minor matter of curiosity, looking at the Budget.<br />
You've kept a clamp on spending overall, but ASIO's Budget<br />
went up by a quarter, why?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you know there had been a general review of security<br />
from Mr. Justice Hope. I suppose as much as anything that<br />
comes out of that Mr. Justice Hope had recommended that the<br />
organisation needed improving, boosting, additional recruitment.<br />
It had the clamps put on it very severely in earlier times<br />
and wouldn't have grown as other expenditures have grown.<br />
The Government basically accepted that advice. But there is<br />
also advice you know under the new machinery there is advice<br />
of senior officials, a number of senior officials, who advise<br />
the Intelligence and Security Committee of Cabinet. The Budget<br />
has accepted this basic of the Budget as recommended by the<br />
Committee... / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
QUESTION: The Freedom of Information: Bill has aroused widespread<br />
objections more or less across the political spectrum.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Media objections<br />
QUESTION: Well, and some political.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And some political but widespread implies a widespread<br />
comment from the public at large. I have got my doubts as<br />
to whether they would really be conscious of the legislation.<br />
QUESTION: Why not make the Bill rather more liberal, and is it the<br />
politicians or the public servants who would oppose such<br />
liberality?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think you've got to, when embarking on a relatively new<br />
form of legislation as it is for Australia, you've got to<br />
look at the additional demands that might be put on the<br />
Service. The capacity of the service to meet those demands.<br />
Once they are enshrined in statute the requirement is there.<br />
You've had the words in the Public Service Board report<br />
about additional demands on the Public Service from a whole<br />
range of legislation; Administrative Appeals Tribunal,<br />
the Ombudsman, a number of other things. I believe it's<br />
better to be cautious of the initial steps. The reports we get<br />
out of the United States where there is freedom of<br />
information legislation, are not all good; about the way<br />
it operates and how it performs and about its benefits.<br />
I think there is no harm basically in a cautious approach<br />
in the first instance but I think the legislation is likely<br />
to be very closely examined by the Parliament<br />
QUESTION: Some of the Members possibly, likely?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've got no doubt that amendements will be suggested. Now what<br />
additives the Government will adopt, will obviously depend<br />
on what they are. But I think there could be quite a<br />
lengthy Parliamentary scrutiny. I don't know that for a fact.<br />
QUESTION: You are op en to suggestions, though? / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh yes.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think the Public Service is loyal to Government or<br />
do the spate of leaks from it indicate some disaffection?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think a very large part of the Public Service is pleased<br />
with the general progress that Australia is making.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
Why the leaks?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think there are always leaks there always have been.<br />
In think there were more before this Budget than there have<br />
been for a long while.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
Why do you think so?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I find it difficult to answer that. It happened very much<br />
at the last minute. I find it difficult to answer that.<br />
I have called for a report on those matters, as you know.<br />
QUESTION: Has it come in yet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I haven't got the report yet.<br />
QUESTION: Now, the IRB. It was set up partly to protect individual<br />
rights, yet the events of the last week or so seem to have<br />
exposed some problems in the legislation, for example, Miss Biggs<br />
was eventually effectively pressurised into taking another<br />
job in the State Government. Three question: do you think,<br />
one that the IRB should move more quickly to and more strongly<br />
in such a case; secondly, should the legislation be changed<br />
to give the unions a right of appeal in exemption cases;<br />
and thirdly, is there a danger that the legislation could be<br />
exploited by, effectively, mischief makers?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I would hope that mischief makers would not get a<br />
certificate of consciencious objection and that's an area,<br />
where if mischief makers were able to get a certificate there you<br />
have procedures right at the beginning of the process which<br />
could need examination. But, one of the things that hasn't ./ 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
come out of the record of this particular legislation is<br />
that about 150 certificates have been granted and accepted,<br />
operating quietly with no fuss by the unions.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
But now it has been stirred up, we seem to be getting a<br />
spate of them.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, no, there were two, two out of 150, and so the record<br />
I think is a good one. And overwhelmingly, the unions that have<br />
accepted those 150 certificates have shown they are prepared<br />
to abide by the spirit of the legislation. It is worth noting<br />
also that there was very extensive discussion with the<br />
trade union movement before this legislation went through.<br />
Now, all right, there's been the tramways case and case in<br />
Parliament House where the legislation hasn't worked smoothly<br />
for one reason or another. Now I don't believe on the total<br />
record that indicates or gives us any reason to condemn the<br />
legislation or the basis of the legislation or even to indicate<br />
the legislation needs substantial change.<br />
QUESTION: Should there be the right of appeal though, by the union on<br />
certificates. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, its the right of appeal against an individual...<br />
QUESTION: or against the decision...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm not too sure how the processes would have worked, but I<br />
think that if the matter had been pursued and if the union had<br />
in fact come under prosecution or examination from the IRB<br />
as a result of the tramways case, then in those circumstances<br />
the record for granting a certificate in that circumstance<br />
would have also come up for examination. My understanding<br />
is that's so.<br />
QUESTION: Should the IRE move more strongly in these cases?<br />
PRI14E MINISTER:<br />
No. Again, it's a question of taking the intitial steps with<br />
a degree of caution. The Industrial Relations Bureau was<br />
established because we believe there is a role in protecting<br />
individual rights and the maintenance of industrial law.<br />
I think a great deal of fuss has been made over two cases,<br />
but the fact that no fuss was made over 150 cases, they have been<br />
accepted by the unions, the employees concerned, quietly, and<br />
/ 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
we didn't even know about it. I would have thought that<br />
this was good ground to indicate that the law by and large<br />
has been working well.<br />
QUESTION: Except they weren't challenged. This woman's rights<br />
really in the upshot, weren't protected, were they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think that--as I'm advised the making of decisions is a<br />
great stress and strain on a person, and what is did demonstrate,<br />
and I don't think this camne out through the media, is that<br />
here you have one union that was not prepared to recognise<br />
individual rights of conscientious objection.<br />
QUESTION: And the IRE could not protect that woman in that union.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you have to be prepared to go through court cases and<br />
all the rest. And we know quite well that in difficult<br />
circumstances the maintenance of individual rights can entail<br />
a cost in terms of public exposure, can entail a cost in<br />
terms of pressure, publicity...<br />
QUESTION: Should the process be quicker though?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, in industrial relations, if the processes are too quick,<br />
it can get to a very inflammatory situation, you need time<br />
for people to be able to stand back a step and think and<br />
hopefully to do so in a rational and calm manner.<br />
QUESTION: So you weren't disappointed at the IRE's handling of that<br />
situation?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER:<br />
No, I don't think so. Obviously disappointed when you get to<br />
a situation where a union will not accept the right of<br />
conscientious objection because that is a very serious matter.<br />
QUESTION: There has been press criticism lately related to your credibility<br />
and your approval ratings at the polls has been fairly low.<br />
How do you account for those two things? </p>
<p>10<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think, I basically put it down to the overall Withers<br />
affair rather than to the Budget, because I don't agree with<br />
the media headlines in relation to the Budget. I have spoken<br />
to a great many people in many parts of Australia and<br />
I've never had a budget where so many people have made it<br />
perfectly plain they are very glad the Government had brought<br />
in a responsible budget even though there might be some<br />
bits of it they don't like.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
But you think the Withers affair was damaging?<br />
PRIM'E MINISTER:<br />
When you get a Royal Commission report and the result...<br />
you really have only two real courses open to you. Rejection<br />
of that Royal Commission report with the cogency and power<br />
of the findings and of the evidence as many people believed<br />
one course could have been rejection of the report. Arnd the<br />
other course was the one basically which was taken. Quite<br />
obviously either course had very real problems involved in<br />
it. I believe fervently, that the Government took the<br />
only course that was possible, the only course which was<br />
right in the circumstances and, as you know it was the view<br />
of ministers who examined this that the report should not<br />
be rejected.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think you get a fair go generally from the media?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I believe sometimes facts could be better checked.<br />
QUESTION: Is that your only complaint?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if people write opinions, and make it perfectly plain<br />
that they are opinions, I don't think its reasonable to complain<br />
about opinions, but if opinions are drawn from alleged facts<br />
that aren't facts or if opinions are written in terms that<br />
suggest they are facts then I think that that's taking a<br />
path that could be improved. But there have been a number of<br />
cases over a period where facts have not been checked and<br />
things have been written as facts which have been either<br />
without foundation or wrong.<br />
QUESTION: You don't feel that there is a deliberate media campaign<br />
against you? Let me put it more neutrally do you think<br />
there is? / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, maybe I should ask you that question. I've just stated<br />
what I think to be so and I know so that a number of things<br />
that are written have been written without checking and<br />
I think it damages the reputation of the people that do so<br />
and it damages the reputation of the newspapers.-<br />
QUESTION: But do you think this is part of some deliberate campaign<br />
against you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I wouldn't put that sort of motive to it.<br />
QUESTION: A wider question. What qualities do you think a Liberal<br />
leader needs to possess?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER:<br />
A Liberal what?<br />
QUESTION: Leader. The Leader of the Liberal Party.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, I think that is very difficult. It would be easier to go<br />
and ask members in the Party Room that.<br />
QUESTION: I'm not talking about this Liberal Leader, particularly<br />
a liberal leader.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think any leader.. let me put it on that basis, any Prime<br />
Minister, needs to have a degree of strength; needs to be able to<br />
deal with a wide range of subjects, needs to be able to work<br />
with his colleagues, needs to be able to work very long hours.<br />
He needs to be able to stick to a point during a difficult<br />
situation, often over a period of weeks or months, has got to<br />
be prepared to pursue policies which have been devised in<br />
the process of government and through cabinet consensus which<br />
are right in the long term but which can entail costs in the<br />
short term. And hopefully he ought to be able to talk with<br />
people and understand the basic needs and aspiration of<br />
Australians and get out of Canberra and know what the real<br />
world in this country is thinking, what the real people are<br />
concerned about, what their fears are, what their hopes are,<br />
what their aspirations are, what they are worried about today,<br />
what they may be worried about next year. / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
QUESTION: Now, your youngest daughter is now 12. What sort of<br />
Australia do you think she will be living in when she is 21?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A vigorous, vital Australia looking toward the next century<br />
with a great deal of confidence. A fair, compassionate<br />
society and an example to the world.<br />
QUESTION: Anything more specific?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you asked me to predict, what, nine years ahead, I think<br />
to give the thrust of the general direction, you can't be<br />
specific. Hopefully an Australia where there might be a more<br />
tolerant society than there might be at the moment.<br />
QUESTION: Tolerant how?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
People should have a greater tolerance for the views of other<br />
people. outside in the country, I think that there is a great<br />
deal of tolerance, where there are less people that are whipped<br />
up, or persuaded by advocacy to be intolerant. But when you go<br />
into a public bar and have a beer with people, they just take<br />
you as another bloke who wants a beer. And that's as it should<br />
be. But in this city, I think that there is often a great<br />
deal of intolerance, and I don't believe that in the process,<br />
a good example is set to the rest of Australia.<br />
QUESTION: Are you talking about all sections of the city the<br />
politicians, the media, the bureaucracy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the bureacrats aren't in the public eye to the extent that<br />
a lot of other people are. I think I'm probably talking about<br />
politicians and the media, yes.<br />
QUESTION: The less we spend our time with each other I suppose you<br />
could say? / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that might be a better idea if we spent more time<br />
out in the sticks, but I've suggested that to some members<br />
of the media on more than one occasion without much<br />
success. I believe that I would spend much more time<br />
speaking to people outside in many places in this country,<br />
much more than the media, and I think I am therefore<br />
better placed than the media to understand what Australians<br />
are thinking about and what their concerns are. And I think<br />
that past events have demonstrated that I'm sometimes<br />
a better judge of that than the media.<br />
QUESTION: Like elections?<br />
PRIME M4INISTER:<br />
Yes. QUESTION: To go to a specific economic question: your policies involved<br />
large tax concessions initially and then a cutting back from<br />
time to time. Now I know that you make out that taxpayers<br />
are much better off overall than they would have been, but<br />
would a more gradualist approach have been better so that you<br />
would have then avoided this, albeit limited, cutback in the<br />
last budget.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's fair enough to say that with the wisdom of hindsight,<br />
but I don't think I would have played that part of it<br />
differently. Let me go on to make the point that income tax<br />
payers this year are paying $ 3 billion less tax than they would<br />
have been under the Hayden scales. Now, the fact that there<br />
had to be a temporary increase in taxes is an example of tax<br />
indexation working. We said we wanted a situation where<br />
governments didn't get a greater and greater rip-off as a result<br />
of inflation and that if they wanted more money they would have<br />
to tax for it. All right, we've had to do that, but I'd<br />
sooner have to justify what we've done than to be getting more<br />
money from Australians by the process of inflations which<br />
we've stopped. So I take that as a mark of success. But if two<br />
or three estimates of revenue at the time of the budget before<br />
this one we are debating now had not proved to be out, in fact<br />
we wouldn't have had to have this present temporary increase<br />
because we would have been operating on a higher tax base,<br />
and there were two or three estimates alone which accounted<br />
for $ 700 or $ 800 million. Now the estimates alone were made<br />
in good faith at the time on the best advice available. All right,<br />
they proved to-be wrong. Well, that was one of the factors<br />
perhaps the principal one, which has led to the circumstance<br />
in which the temporary increase is necessary.<br />
QUESTION: Briefly, when talking about the first 1,000 days,<br />
what are the three achievements of the first 1,000 days of<br />
which you are most proud, and what is your one major<br />
disappointment? ./ 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The progress in the economy, obviously getting inflation down,<br />
getting into a much better position than most OECD countries<br />
in relation to our inflation moving down and their's moving<br />
up as something central to our economic policy. I think<br />
that's a major issue and in the area of social welfare and<br />
social reform, the change in the system of income tax rebates,<br />
which helped the wealthy, and gave no benefit to the poor,.<br />
to assist in the family allowances in a way, if you like,<br />
that penalise the wealthy and gave the greatest advantage<br />
of those new allowances to the poor, and the less well off.<br />
Arnd coupled with that in the social welfare area is a much<br />
better deal for the handicapped people in Australia.<br />
I was really making that as two areas, and I think in one<br />
. other area also while it's a continuing process I believe<br />
that there is much greater consultation and communication<br />
with community, and I think industrial relations, in spite<br />
of the recent strikes, is much, much better than it was in<br />
the time of our predecessors and official records and<br />
statistics demonstrate that.<br />
QUESTION: And the disappointment?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER:<br />
The disappointment that improvement in the employment<br />
area is as slow as in fact it is. Getting back to a number<br />
of things, it takes a long while to get imbalances in the<br />
economy right, a long while to get wage relativities right.<br />
QUESTION: You continue to have difficulties with the Aurukun and<br />
Mornington Island Aboriginal settlements. Do you rule out<br />
the acquisition of those two settlements at any time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Not absolutely, I made that plain on Monday Conference.<br />
But I also pointed out that that's not a simple answer to<br />
a very complex problem, because if governments are going<br />
to fulfil their obligations to Aboriginal communities,<br />
they are going to have to do it in cooperation. Every state<br />
government has obligations to every person in that state<br />
you can't cut arms out of the state and say there is going<br />
to be different health services, different, different<br />
education services, different other services they're all<br />
part of the:-state. And in these circumstances, the only<br />
way in which Australia can fulfil its obligations to the<br />
Aboriginal people is through the cooperation of governments.<br />
If governments are warring, the Aboriginal people will be<br />
torn apart and acquisition will lead to a long process of<br />
litigation and certainly lead to warring administrations<br />
and therefore it is a path to be pursued very, very much as<br />
a last resort. If the agreement with Queensland can be made<br />
to work properly over the coming months it can also be a </p>
<p>15<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
boost to Aboriginal advancement and development in selfmanagement<br />
and I don't think it should be condemned<br />
as a result of some disappointments which have occured in<br />
the initial months.<br />
QUESTION: You brought in a whole armoury of industrial legislation<br />
yet some is not retained and other parts haven't been used<br />
and often Mr. Hawke still seems to get dragged into<br />
conciliation disputes, for example, the Utah dispute and<br />
the Telecom dispute. Has that legislation in fact done<br />
much to stop industrial dispute?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think the totality of our approach has stopped a good deal<br />
of industrial disruption. I'm quite certain the face that<br />
the Government is prepared to stand and be firm in certain<br />
critical situations has been of enormous importance in<br />
settling certain disputes. For example, the air traffic<br />
controllers, the postal workers. There was one occasion<br />
which I don't think any one hear of in relation to the air<br />
pilots where the strike ended before it began certain<br />
things were said in private, and again on this case, it was<br />
as I believe, the Government making it perfectly plain that<br />
they were not going to let this go on much longer without<br />
significant government intervention and by that we created<br />
a situation in which there was a much greater incentive<br />
than ever before of trade union settlement. On the Saturday,<br />
Mr. Hawke offered six points to provide a basis for the<br />
settlement, those points were developed on the Sunday, expanded,<br />
but basically preserved, and the settlement was achieved. If<br />
we hadn't made the stand the previous week, I don't believe there<br />
would have been any sign of a settlement.<br />
QUESTION: You've got now another two years of running of this Government.<br />
What are your main priorities and what do you want to achieve?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Obviously, continuing the economic progress but at the same<br />
time continuing social reform as we can see new areas of<br />
need; showing concern for disadvantaged people in the community.<br />
QUESTION: Anything specific there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. In broad terms, I think you have to look at the general<br />
thrust and the direction that we want to move in. I . think the<br />
record of the last year or two demonstrates that. I would<br />
want to see continued progress made in Commonwealth/ State<br />
relations there are some things that have gone on in the<br />
last two years that have been of historic importancel because / 16 </p>
<p>16<br />
PRIME MINISTER ( cont)<br />
they have achieved agreement and no discord they are<br />
hardly noticed. We have resolved the problems posed by the<br />
High Court decision on the Seas and Submerged Lands Act<br />
by historic agreements whereby although the power was<br />
ours, we were prepared to share it with the states in all<br />
the matters offshore, a number of ( inaud) settled, and all<br />
the guidelines are set for the resolution of the other<br />
practical areas. Now this is an example of governments sitting<br />
down in a practical way to work out solutions to practical<br />
problems. It's been possible, because this Government, and it's<br />
the first government in the history of Australia, has been<br />
prepared to share power and not say ' look, the power's all ours,<br />
we're going to exercise it all', and if governments overall<br />
can have that approach, I'm quite sure that we can get to<br />
a situation where Australia is better governed with a better<br />
division of responsibilities.<br />
QUESTION: Can you be more specific on the welfare area and what you<br />
want to do?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We have done a great deal in terms of disadvantaged people<br />
in the Australian community and I wouldn't think we had come<br />
to the end of that road yet. And in addition, of course,<br />
the various training programmes under Tony Street's department<br />
are playing a very significant role in helping a number of<br />
people who are disadvantaged in other ways the experimental<br />
programme for unemployed youth which is no longer experimental<br />
which has been expanded, has been remarkably successful for<br />
people who have probably never had a fair go in their lives.<br />
Maybe they never had parents that showed the sort of concern<br />
that one would hope parents would show. And it has been this<br />
Government that has developed programmes and has done something<br />
about it. These are aspects of the Government's record over the<br />
last year or two which don't get much publicity but which are<br />
important in terms of social consciousness and. in terms of<br />
opportunity and concern for people within this community and<br />
again, as a general approach, I would hope that that could<br />
be continued. The other thing of course will be working for<br />
continued economic progress making our industries more<br />
competitive, getting a larger share of domestic markets, getting<br />
into overseas markets. It's quite critical to getting the<br />
Australian people better employed.<br />
QUESTION: Will Sir John Kerr's book cause a fresh controversy and<br />
have you spoken to him since he threw in the UNESCO job?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I saw him in London. I have not read the book.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think it will cause fresh controversy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would hope not because I think that in many senses, I am<br />
sure Sir John Kerr would not want to cause fresh controversy. / 17 </p>
<p>17<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
He was forced into a very difficult position and the<br />
constitutional responsibilities that were on his<br />
shoulders at the time he took the only course, the only<br />
path, that was possibly open to him. Again, let me state<br />
the very simple reason for it. He did it because a<br />
Prime Minister and a Government sought to stay in power<br />
without the authority of the Parliament to pay its bills<br />
and they even went to the banks to try and coerce the<br />
banks into financing the affairs of Government in a manner<br />
that would have been utterly illegal and unconstitutional.<br />
QUESTION: But you don't think on the whole it will stir these things<br />
up again?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I haven't seen-. the book. I would hope not. But I do believe<br />
that he has a right to have his own position if that is<br />
what the book is talking about, explained and understood<br />
because he was put in a difficult position where he was<br />
much maligned and in -many ways very fasely maligned.<br />
QUESTION: How well do you think John Howard's ( inaud) the Budget?<br />
Do you think he would make a good Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think there are a number of people in the Liberal Party<br />
who would make good._ Prime Ministers. He's explained the<br />
Budget very well and he's put the points calmly, quietly<br />
and cogently. He explains his own portfolio well. Other<br />
minister explain their own portfolios well.<br />
QUESTION: Is there anything you would like to any points we haven't<br />
covered you would particularly like to make?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There is one thing I would like to say. I have said it on<br />
other occasions. I believe, quite consciously in Australia,<br />
we need to make a greater effort to have pride in being<br />
Australian and pride in the achievements of this nation.<br />
So often people seek to point out what's wrong, we all know<br />
it's not a perfect society. Why else do people work to<br />
try to make it better but there are -great -chievements<br />
in Australia and it's certainly one of the best places to<br />
live. This may well be the best country in the world to<br />
bring up a family, which will give them more opportunity than<br />
anywhere else. We do . need to build a consciousness in national<br />
pride, and Australian capacity for Australian concern, Australian<br />
industries, Australian inventiveness, pride in Australian<br />
workmanship. We need to build on those things to unite us all<br />
as one people, even though we come from many different lands.<br />
I think that politicians, media and people in public life<br />
generally, have an obligation to build, rather than always<br />
to try and pull down and destroy. We are very much a mocking / 18 </p>
<p>18<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
I know quite well as a journalist it is much easier to<br />
criticise than it is to praise. Praise is dull. But having<br />
said that I also think I have made the same criticism<br />
of politicians and I think we ought to try and concentrate<br />
debate on that as a matter of importance and concern.<br />
I believe that when the general public, especially the<br />
schoolchildren come into this Parliament and listen<br />
they must wonder what the Parliament is about when they hear<br />
some of the debates and see some of the things that go on<br />
and the quite uncouth behaviour that oftens occurs in the<br />
Parliament, to make it plain, rude behaviour that occurs<br />
in the Parliament and the use of language that if it occured<br />
in any modern classroom would have the kids sent out of<br />
class but it is accepted in that Parliament, very often.<br />
I think we have got not only an obligation to try and<br />
build on an Australia which we all ought to love, but at<br />
the same time an obligation to find improved standards and<br />
set an example. 000---</p>
