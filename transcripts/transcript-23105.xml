    <content><![CDATA[<p>Madam Speaker, a short time ago, President Yudhoyono made a statement in Jakarta.</p>
<p>I have to say that I was encouraged by the President’s remarks about the strength of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia, although obviously there are very serious issues which do need to be worked through in the near future between us.</p>
<p>Again, Madam Speaker, I want to express here in this Chamber my deep and sincere regret about the embarrassment to the President and to Indonesia that’s been caused by recent media reporting.</p>
<p>The President indicated that he would shortly be writing to me.</p>
<p>I’d like to reassure the House that I will be responding to the President’s letter swiftly, fully and courteously.</p>
<p>As always, I am absolutely committed to building the closest possible relationship with Indonesia because that is overwhelmingly in the interests of both our countries.</p>
