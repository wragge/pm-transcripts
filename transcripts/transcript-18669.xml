Pak President, welcome to Australia. </p>
<p>It is so good to see you again.</p>
<p>Your visit to this country two years ago and your address to our Parliament in Canberra was a moment of enormous significance in the history of our two nations.</p>
<p>I will long remember your words that day: </p>
<p>We are not just neighbours, we are not just friends ... we are strategic partners.                                                                             </p>
<p>And the decisions made during that visit will be remembered too.</p>
<p>We are here this week because two years ago in Canberra our Governments agreed to a new annual leaders' meeting, agreeing to a closeness of co-operation we share with only a handful of countries.</p>
<p>Last year was the first meeting in Indonesia and this year is the first on our side.</p>
<p>It's especially fitting that we are meeting in Darwin, Australia's “northern capital”.</p>
<p>This city is at the centre of so much of the great and growing economic, strategic and humanitarian co-operation between Indonesia and Australia.</p>
<p>And so I want particularly to pay tribute to the people of Darwin, to the Government of the Northern Territory and my friend the Chief Minister Paul Henderson.</p>
<p>You have done so much to welcome us here this week and to foster relations between our two peoples.</p>
<p>So tomorrow, we will meet as strategic partners with much work to do.</p>
<p>We share a full agenda  -  our dialogue will be a powerful symbolic expression of good will.</p>
<p>But it will be much more than that too.</p>
<p>We will have our sleeves rolled up and there will be very real business to do.</p>
<p>Ours is a busy working partnership. </p>
<p>Travel and study, investment and trade, are all growing, with great opportunities to grow more in coming years.</p>
<p>Our Governments exchange high-level visits every few weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed between APEC, the East Asia Summit, the G20, ASEM, it sometimes feels like you and I meet personally every few weeks!</p>
<p>Our Defence personnel work closely together, in the region and beyond.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of Indonesian peacekeepers serving in the some of the most difficult UN missions are those who serve alongside Australians in South Sudan.</p>
<p>Wearing the blue beret of the United Nations which you yourself, Pak President, wore with such distinction in the Balkans in 1995.</p>
<p>I remember that a few years later, in 1999, as a new parliamentarian, I was privileged to be an election observer in West Timor, witness to the birth of modern Indonesian democracy.</p>
<p>The patient enthusiasm of the people I saw, waiting to cast their precious ballot, is something I will never forget.</p>
<p>That was the 1990s. </p>
<p>You and I have both come a long way since then  -  our countries have come a long way together as well.</p>
<p>Some of the issues for tomorrow are hard  -  terrorism and drugs, people smuggling, natural disasters management  -  threats as difficult as any in our shared history.</p>
<p>It's a remarkable tribute to the relationship between our nations that now, when faced by these hard issues, we turn towards each other, rather than turning away.</p>
<p>I believe problems which once threatened to divide us now only bring us closer together.</p>
<p>For two such diverse and dynamic nations to achieve a relationship of such stability and maturity is the real proof, Pak President, that we can meet the goal you set in Canberra in 2010: to build a “fair dinkum partnership”.</p>
<p>The people of these waters and lands have been neighbours for tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Australia was a friend of the Republic of Indonesia from the moment you proclaimed your independence in 1945.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we meet sharing a partnership.   </p>
<p>And, Pak President, your share in this partnership, as a great neighbour and friend of my country, is high indeed.</p>
<p>I look forward very much to our discussions tomorrow with you and your delegation.</p>
<p>And we are so very pleased to be hosting your visit here in Darwin.  </p>
