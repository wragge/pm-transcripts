    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil. Nice to be with you again.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, thanks for being there so early.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I could have come even an hour earlier.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>There's a bit of a cough there. You're not ill, are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, I'm not. I'm as fit as anything.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Good. Now, will the Queensland election this weekend effect your</p>
<p>   timing of an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it won't. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because it's a Queensland election and Australia has long</p>
<p>   had separate State political cultures. There's an old saying</p>
<p>   in Australian politics that quite often Queenslanders vote differently,</p>
<p>   vote as Queenslanders in Queensland elections and they vote as Australians</p>
<p>   in Federal elections. And I don't believe that the outcome,</p>
<p>   whatever it will be and I don't know what it will be, is going</p>
<p>   to influence what I do, the timing of what I do. The timing of what</p>
<p>   I do will be dictated by national political considerations, will</p>
<p>   be dictated by the desirability of fixing up the native title mess,</p>
<p>   the need to press ahead with reform to the Australian taxation system</p>
<p>   and a willingness to maintain our resolve on economic matters in</p>
<p>   the face of a very difficult world economic environment.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Nobody knows what will happen in Queensland but as such an experienced</p>
<p>   political campaigner as yourself, what do you expect? I was just</p>
<p>   talking to another experienced political campaigner, Laurie Oakes,</p>
<p>   who's quite convinced that seats will be won and they could</p>
<p>   well hold the balance of power, One Nation. Do you think that's</p>
<p>   a possibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to make a prediction 24 hours out. I really</p>
<p>   don't know the opinion polls, of which there have been many.</p>
<p>   I don't know how reliable some of them are - are indicating</p>
<p>   support for One Nation. I think it is too early, particularly with</p>
<p>   the rather unusual, optional preferential voting system where people</p>
<p>   do not have to extend their preferences. That, of course, is quite</p>
<p>   different federally. I'm not going to hazard a guess at this</p>
<p>   stage. I simply say to the people of Queensland that ultimately</p>
<p>   it is a choice between either a Borbidge government or a Beattie</p>
<p>   government. And if you are on the conservative side of politics</p>
<p>   in Queensland and you don't want a Labor government you should,</p>
<p>   by preference, vote Liberal or National. If you can't vote</p>
<p>   for them, well, give your second preference to them otherwise you'll</p>
<p>   end up with a Labor government. Now, that is ultimately still the</p>
<p>   choice and I would hope that Queenslanders, when they vote tomorrow,</p>
<p>   will bear that very much in mind.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How detrimental would it be to Australia's international standing</p>
<p>   if One Nation was to win seats in Queensland and, in fact, hold</p>
<p>   the balance of power?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The only thing that will really be detrimental to Australia's</p>
<p>   international standing would be if people overseas thought the Government</p>
<p>   of Australia held views that were hostile to them.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But you don't think it would be a message that the new right</p>
<p>   has some power in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, look, I think that can be over-exaggerated. I don't want</p>
<p>   to see One Nation win seats anywhere in Australia, I don't,</p>
<p>   any more than I want to see some other parties like the Australian</p>
<p>   Democrats and the Australian Greens have influence because their</p>
<p>   influence has been very negative.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But you would put One Nation in the same basket as the Democrats</p>
<p>   and the Greens.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. They're a difference group altogether. But I'm</p>
<p>   simply saying that this idea that there aren't other parties</p>
<p>   around that have negative policies is misplaced. Now, there are</p>
<p>   some policies of One Nation, of course, that are totally unacceptable</p>
<p>   to me. Absolutely. Any reliance on issues relating to race, any</p>
<p>   suggestion that policies should be determined on that basis have</p>
<p>   always been unacceptable. But you make an enormous mistake, I don't</p>
<p>   mean you, personally, but I think people make an enormous mistake</p>
<p>   in thinking that the only people who are attracted to One Nation</p>
<p>   are people who are intolerant. There are a lot of ordinary, decent</p>
<p>   Australians who feel a sense of insecurity in a time of economic</p>
<p>   change and social change and they somehow or other think there's</p>
<p>   a way out of that and they listen to simplistic solutions like offers</p>
<p>   of two per cent interest rates on bank loans. Now, anybody who thinks</p>
<p>   for 30 seconds will know that that is undeliverable. But if you're</p>
<p>   an unemployed person in rural Queensland and you have no hope of</p>
<p>   getting a job and you think the industry that you once worked for</p>
<p>   is gone because of import competition and somebody comes along and</p>
<p>   says: look, I can solve your problem with a two per cent interest</p>
<p>   rate loan - you listen. Whereas if you're employed and doing</p>
<p>   well, you immediately dismiss it as being a ridiculous proposition.</p>
<p>   Now, I think we have to get out there and talk. I'm speaking</p>
<p>   for my Party and the National Party. I think we've got to get</p>
<p>   out there and talk to those people and listen to them.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Isn't it a bit late, though? I mean, do you think you should</p>
<p>   have been doing it earlier?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, people can always say that. I mean, the initial reaction</p>
<p>   of many commentators was that anybody who was attracted to One Nation</p>
<p>   was simply a racist. That was mistaken. If people have made mistakes</p>
<p>   in relation to One Nation, it's not only the political leaders</p>
<p>   who have made mistakes but there are a lot of other people who've</p>
<p>   made mistakes, but whether you have or you haven't, that's</p>
<p>   the past.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, do you feel you have or not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. I believe that if I had come in much harder at</p>
<p>   the beginning that probably would have given her more prominence</p>
<p>   in the beginning and I don't think the result would have been</p>
<p>   any different.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The interpretation of a speech yesterday is that a double dissolution</p>
<p>   is the way you will go. Is that correct? Will an lection, any election,</p>
<p>   be a double dissolution?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Neil, like any other Prime Minister I'll keep my options</p>
<p>   open on that. Nothing has really changed. Some people got mistakenly</p>
<p>   excited about some remarks I made on radio the other night. I just</p>
<p>   simply make it clear again, of course the option of a double dissolution</p>
<p>   is there. You know how strongly I feel about getting the native</p>
<p>   title mess fixed up. And unless the minor parties and the Labor</p>
<p>   Party in the Senate change their position and pass our Native Title</p>
<p>   Bill, the only way to fix up that mess - because the Senate's</p>
<p>   rejected it twice - is to put it to a joint sitting after the next</p>
<p>   election. Now, that remains the position. The question of ultimately</p>
<p>   what I do in relation to a double dissolution or otherwise is something</p>
<p>   I'll decide further down the track. And no Prime Minister in</p>
<p>   Australian history has said, this far out, precisely what he or</p>
<p>   she was going to do.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>This far out. So it's a way off, is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, next week's a way off. But don't read anything</p>
<p>   into that either. I mean, we are in this sort of situation - you</p>
<p>   can't say anything, you know. But, I mean, it really is quite</p>
<p>   extraordinary. Neil, the trigger is there for a double dissolution.</p>
<p>   I think the Australian people know how important native title is.</p>
<p>   But, as any Prime Minister, I obviously have always intended to</p>
<p>   keep my options open but people shouldn't underestimate or</p>
<p>   misread my determination to fix the native title mess. It's</p>
<p>   very important, particularly to the people of Queensland and to</p>
<p>   the people of Western Australia.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you accept, though, a double dissolution would increase the</p>
<p>   possibility of One Nation winning Senate seats and possibly holding</p>
<p>   a balance of power in the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the quota would be lower, yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Does that concern you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it concerns me, yes. That does concern me. That would be</p>
<p>   a concern. On the other hand, if the Government were to throw in</p>
<p>   the towel on native title that would send a very powerful signal</p>
<p>   to the people of rural Australia that we don't care about them.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It would be very hard to govern with One Nation having the balance</p>
<p>   of power.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've had to govern with a lot of people in the past</p>
<p>   that have made it difficult for us. I find Senator Harradine, although</p>
<p>   he's a reasonable man on many issues to deal with and I admire</p>
<p>   him greatly, I find him not too bad to deal with. I find the antics</p>
<p>   of the Democrats and the Greens on issues where we have a clear</p>
<p>   mandate, quite obstructive. I mean, we went to the people at the</p>
<p>   last election saying we'd sell one-third of Telstra and they</p>
<p>   deliberately tried to frustrate that. In a whole range of areas</p>
<p>   we have faced obstruction. But I just think you have to understand</p>
<p>   that the nature of the Senate voting system is that it will always</p>
<p>   throw up minority parties. We have to live with that. It's</p>
<p>   a more difficult situation for us because the minority parties at</p>
<p>   the present time are parties left of centre. And that, of course,</p>
<p>   means that when we are in government the combination of those minor</p>
<p>   parties and the Labor Party makes life very difficult for us.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, do you think there's a realistic chance of One Nation</p>
<p>   having seats in the Senate after the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's too early to make any prediction about that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take some calls if that's all right. Jane, go ahead</p>
<p>   please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello, Mr Howard. I just want to speak about a couple of things.</p>
<p>   I listen to Pauline Hanson and I hear what she has to say. The first</p>
<p>   thing is that I have never ever heard her say that she doesn't</p>
<p>   like Greeks, Italians, Vietnamese or anybody or that they shouldn't</p>
<p>   be here. All she says is that we're short of jobs in Australia</p>
<p>   and we shouldn't be bringing in any more unskilled migrants.</p>
<p>   And, secondly, she doesn't say she doesn't like Aboriginals.</p>
<p>   All she says is that ATSIC should have to account for every penny</p>
<p>   that is given to them and say where it goes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's true that she has said those things that you have</p>
<p>   just mentioned. But it is also true that she has said that Australia</p>
<p>   is being flooded with Asians. You know as well as I do that when</p>
<p>   you say a country is being flooded with people of a particular racial</p>
<p>   background that is calculated to put a focus on those people unfairly.</p>
<p>   I don't object for a moment to a decent debate about immigration</p>
<p>   levels. I certainly listen to arguments about waste of money, be</p>
<p>   it in ATSIC or anywhere else. And, indeed, I was very critical of</p>
<p>   the Aboriginal Affairs policy of the former Labor government but</p>
<p>   I have never made the claim that this country is being flooded with</p>
<p>   this or that particular group. And language like that can be used</p>
<p>   to generate unnecessary fear within the Australian community. I</p>
<p>   believe in a tolerant, harmonious Australian community. I believe</p>
<p>   that all Australians, irrespective of their background, must be</p>
<p>   treated equally. Now, I know that on occasions she has said that</p>
<p>   as well. But I do think that when you go around saying that a country</p>
<p>   is being flooded with people of a particular group, that is calculated</p>
<p>   to give the impression that - or is calculated to create fear and</p>
<p>   concern and, perhaps, hostility to that group within the community</p>
<p>   and I don't think that is acceptable.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thanks, Jane. Rodney, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Rodney.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I would thought you would have learnt from the Joh for PM'</p>
<p>   campaign in 87. Wouldn't it be best that... well, place</p>
<p>   her last on the ballot sheet? We've been discredited in Asia</p>
<p>   and...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think... can I just take on this Asian stuff about</p>
<p>   being discredited in Asia straight away and say how apologetic and</p>
<p>   defeatist and negative that is about our country. If ever a country</p>
<p>   over the last few months has not been discredited in Asia, it is</p>
<p>   Australia. Under my Government, this country has been a good friend</p>
<p>   of many countries in Asia. It has helped them in their time of need.</p>
<p>   Our reputation in Asia stands taller now than I believe it has stood</p>
<p>   for several years because we have been a genuine friend and just</p>
<p>   because there has been some odd article in a particular journal</p>
<p>   in one country in Asia talking about Pauline Hanson or talking about</p>
<p>   this or that, does not alter the balance of very favourable opinion</p>
<p>   that flows through from all sources within the Asia Pacific region,</p>
<p>   that sees Australia as a proud independent country willing to help</p>
<p>   in Asia's time of need, but not apologising in any way for</p>
<p>   its own democratic processes. Of course we have a range of opinions</p>
<p>   in this country and Asian countries have got to understand that</p>
<p>   that is the Australian way. They've got to understand that</p>
<p>   we are a democracy and people are entitled to express their point</p>
<p>   of view but what matters is the collective Australian image and</p>
<p>   the collective Australian image in Asia is very positive.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil. Good morning Prime Minister. Mr Howard, I think</p>
<p>   there is a perception amongst a lot of average people out there,</p>
<p>   and I think this is the appeal of One Nation, that there is a large</p>
<p>   block of unemployed people who have no interest in looking for work</p>
<p>   and yet are handsomely compensated. At the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>   you have the very rich who are then able to minimise their tax,</p>
<p>   and yet the average worker seems to be getting shafted....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a marvellous commercial, may I say, for tax reform.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes and I hope you will go ahead with that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we certainly will, and I notice incidentally though that</p>
<p>   Mrs Hanson is against it. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Against a GST is she?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, she said that yesterday. I mean you can't have decent</p>
<p>   tax reform in Australia without a broad-based indirect tax. I mean</p>
<p>   you are not even in the game if you are not prepared to entertain</p>
<p>   that. Now, it's very interesting that the caller should make</p>
<p>   that point, yet he really is in a sense arguing against the sort</p>
<p>   of proposition that she's now putting forward. I mean, people,</p>
<p>   once you start being taken at all seriously on the Australian political</p>
<p>   scene you then immediately become accountable for what you are saying.</p>
<p>   I mean, it's all right, you can be a fringe player when nobody</p>
<p>   thinks you are going to win anything and you can say anything you</p>
<p>   like, but once you start being a serious competitor for office,</p>
<p>   then the remarks you make about policy are quite properly scrutinised.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is that what's happening to Pauline Hanson now is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it is, and I think that's fair enough.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Did you notice she said the other day, she'd like to be Prime</p>
<p>   Minister one day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's fair enough. A lot of people want to be Prime</p>
<p>   Minister.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think she's got a show?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard I notice that John Singleton who ran that advertising</p>
<p>   campaign against the GST back in 93 for Labor, has now joined</p>
<p>   the Business Council to promote the GST. You're not going to</p>
<p>   sign him up too are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, we're not. It's a very interesting development though.</p>
<p>   That campaign is independent of the Government. It's a very</p>
<p>   interesting development though, very interesting, because he was</p>
<p>   as you say, the advertising guru for the Labor Party for many years</p>
<p>   and presumably wrote and authorised and promoted the anti-GST campaign</p>
<p>   in 1993, so it's a very very interesting, and I guess from</p>
<p>   the point of view of those who want tax reform, a very positive</p>
<p>   development. Now, I'm not going to try and say anymore than</p>
<p>   that. It's a decision he's made and a contract he's</p>
<p>   entered into with the Business Council, but I do just say that we</p>
<p>   desperately need tax reform in this country. And one of the reasons</p>
<p>   why, if I can go back to the earlier discussion, I think one of</p>
<p>   the reason why there is a transient appeal of new parties to the</p>
<p>   Australian people is that sometimes they see the combat between</p>
<p>   the two major parties as being too much composed of petty point</p>
<p>   scoring and not enough serious political debate. And tax reform</p>
<p>   is a very good example of that. In their earlier positions, both</p>
<p>   Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans have strongly supported taxation reform,</p>
<p>   they strongly supported Paul Keating when he pushed for that in</p>
<p>   the middle 1980s and deep down </p>
<p>I think a lot of Australians feel that rather than the Labor Party</p>
<p>   just automatically oppose what we are doing on tax, they join the</p>
<p>   debate and they embrace the need for tax reform.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Before the election they did say they believed there was all this</p>
<p>   money to be gathered by clamping down on some of the rorts. Have</p>
<p>   you, or has your Government, clamped down on the rorts as toughly</p>
<p>   as you should?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We certainly have, and on that score about before the last election,</p>
<p>   I notice Gareth Evans said, perhaps on your programme the other</p>
<p>   day, that they were only told about it a month before the election.</p>
<p>   That really does stretch credibility. You've been in power</p>
<p>   for 13 years, and only a month before you are thrown out of office,</p>
<p>   are you told by the tax office that there is $800 million of avoided</p>
<p>   tax to be collected. I think that is really asking the Australian</p>
<p>   public to believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is the $800 million there, and if so, how much are we getting now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are getting some hundreds of millions of dollars as a</p>
<p>   result of our clamp down on tax avoidance practices by high wealth</p>
<p>   individuals. The advice we had when we came to office was that the</p>
<p>   $800 million figure was nowhere near as solid as the former government</p>
<p>   had suggested. But we have changed a number of things, some of them</p>
<p>   opposed by the Labor Party to remove tax avoidance, particularly</p>
<p>   in the area of some of the R&amp;D syndicates where there were blatant</p>
<p>   levels of tax avoidance. The Labor Party in fact voted against measures</p>
<p>   to clamp down on those tax avoidance practices. We are very committed</p>
<p>   to seeing that both ends pay their fair share so that the middle</p>
<p>   gets a better break.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Tell me, Mr Howard, have you told Peter Costello to work harder?</p>
<p>   Because he told me that he reckons the tax package was several months</p>
<p>   off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, it's this old game of you know, what's a week,</p>
<p>   what's a months, what's a....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, a month is four weeks.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will be out fairly soon.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>All right, so he's working harder is he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He's always worked hard, he works very hard. I mean, look</p>
<p>   at the terrific job he's done with the Budget.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Interest rates have gone up at the ANZ and St George. Are the banks</p>
<p>   being a bit greedy putting them up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about the future levels of interest rates</p>
<p>   at all. The fundamentals of the Australian economy remain very strong.</p>
<p>   And it is very important that that be borne in mind as we go through</p>
<p>   this rather turbulent period, and I think it is also fair to bear</p>
<p>   in mind how more weak and more vulnerable Australia would have been</p>
<p>   if my Government had not taken the corrective economic measures</p>
<p>   it did when it came to office. But I'm not going to talk about</p>
<p>   the behaviour of the banks and I'm not going to talk about</p>
<p>   future levels of either interest rates or the exchange rate.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I understand that entirely. Have you advised Mr Costello that he</p>
<p>   shouldn't because he did it on this programme, and the dollar</p>
