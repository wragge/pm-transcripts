C d TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE ON DEPARTURE FOR NEW<br />
ZEALAND -1 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: think you'll be able to squeeze in a bit<br />
of business, given you have three days in Auckland?<br />
PM: a serious question?<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you hope to achieve on your New<br />
Zealand visit over the next few days?<br />
PM: Well I'm scheduled to have some discussions with Mr<br />
Palmer, the Prime Minister. We will be covering a range<br />
of issues of mutual concern. Also of course I hope to<br />
see something of our athletes and performance at the<br />
Games. JOURNALIST: The CPI figures yesterday Mr Hawke, what's<br />
your reaction to them?<br />
PM: I'm glad to see that there's some reduction in the<br />
annual rate of inflation. It's not something that we<br />
should get wildly excited about. But the move is in the<br />
right direction.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think with today's balance of<br />
payments as well there might be cause for a further<br />
easing of monetary policy?<br />
PM: Well we'll have to wait and see what the balance of<br />
payments figures show. I don't know what they are. We<br />
have no indication in advance of them. We won't be<br />
moving irresponsibly in the area of monetary policy. As<br />
we've said all along, we'll watch the developments and<br />
make the appropriate decisions.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you're hoping your decision will be<br />
vindicated though by today's figures.<br />
PM: The decision has already been vindicated. The<br />
balance of payments figures, as we've said, the reason we<br />
didn't wait for them is they don't reflect the current<br />
situation at all. They reflect decisions of nine months<br />
ago. </p>
<p>' U JOURNALIST: balance of payments figures are good<br />
today, might it be enough to call an election on Mr<br />
Hawke? PM: We don't just go on one particular thing like that.<br />
I've been fascinated by all the speculation on the<br />
election that you people have been engaging in. Mr<br />
Peacock seems to think about it every day. But we just<br />
go on with the business of governing the country. of<br />
it obviously go virtually its full term. I'll make a<br />
decision in the relatively near future about the date of<br />
the election.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister the Treasurer yesterday<br />
seemed to back away from the idea of an increase in the<br />
fuel tax for road funding.<br />
PM: What idea of an increased tax was there? I mean I'm<br />
not aware of one. I'm simply I at a press conference<br />
responded to a question ' would you have difficulty<br />
selling an idea?'. I was wanting to make clear that<br />
there'd been a very gross misrepresentation about the<br />
proportion of revenue to the Government allocated to<br />
roads under this Government. In fact this last year<br />
slightly up on the proportion of revenue available to the<br />
previous government from oil that was made available to<br />
roads. I was making that point and then someone seemed<br />
to say oh well now he's talking about an increased tax on<br />
petrol for roads. Now I can't help it if people jump to<br />
conclusions. So Mr Keating wasn't running away from any<br />
idea. No idea had been formulated.<br />
JOURNALIST: it could be considered, but be<br />
considered before the next election?<br />
PM: All things are raised. People raise this idea, that<br />
idea. I didn't say simply because I was referring to<br />
what had been happening to the proportion of revenue from<br />
oil going to roads. There was nothing in that and you<br />
ought to read the transcript very carefully. I made no<br />
proposal about an increased tax. You don't want to get<br />
carried away by an analysis of fact and say out of that<br />
analysis of a factual situation which the Prime Minister<br />
gave therefore he is moving to some increased tax. There<br />
was nothing there to sustain that proposal at any point;<br />
So Mr Keating has neither advanced nor retreated from an<br />
idea which wasn't proposed.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I'm afraid you're competing questions there. I<br />
can't hear you. And I've got to go. See you later.<br />
