EMBARGO: 8.30 PM<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G, WHITL4M, QC, M, P,,<br />
TO TH! E ' NATIONAL RURAL PRESS CLUB DINNER, AT THE LAKESIDE<br />
INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, CANBER. RA<br />
4I JULY 13/ 4<br />
ON THE 14 DECEMBER LAST YEAR I WROTE TO DR STUART<br />
HARRIS AND ESTABLISHED A WORKING GROUP ON RURAL POLICY IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, IN THAT LETTER I SAID:<br />
" I ENVISAGE THAT YOUR GREEN PAPER WILL BE<br />
PUBLISHED WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT BUT WITHOUT FORMAL APPROVAL.<br />
IN THAT FORM I HOPE IT WILL PROVIDE A BASIS<br />
FOR WIDESPREAD DIALOGUE IN THE PARLIAMENT,<br />
IN RURAL ORGANISATIONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY<br />
GENERALLY. I<br />
THE DIALOGUE TO WHICH I THEN REFERRED HAS NOW<br />
BEGUN. IAM GRATEFUL, MR CHAIRMAN4 FOR THE OPPORTUNITY YOUR<br />
INVITATION HAS GIVEN ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT DIALOGUE. </p>
<p>4<br />
-2-<br />
AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE<br />
HAS BEEN CREATED BY SENATOR KEN WRIEDT, WHO WILL NOW MORE<br />
APPROPRIATELY BE KNOWN AS THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE,<br />
HIs INITIATIVE TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FARMING COMMUNITY WAS THE<br />
CONVENING OF THE RURAL FORUM, THE FIRST OCCASION ON WHICH<br />
ANY GOVERNMENT HAS INVITED ALL MULTI-PURPOSE FARMING<br />
ORGANISATIONS TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS OF THE INDUSTRY WITH<br />
GOVERNMENT, THIS FORUM WILL NOW BE AN ANNUAL EVENT, I AM<br />
PLEASED THE SECOND MEETING TO BE HELD TOMORROW HAS BEFORE<br />
IT SO WIDE-RANGING AND CONSTRUCTIVE A DOCUMENT AS THE<br />
GREEN PAPER ON RURAL POLICY,<br />
FEW OF MY MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENTS HAVE GIVEN<br />
ME AS MUCH REAL SATISFACTION AS THAT OF SENATOR KEN WRIEDT,<br />
HIS SINCERITY, ABILITY AND COMMITMENT HAVE RECEIVED<br />
CONGRATULATIONS FROM MANY QUARTERS, I UNDERSTAND THAT HE<br />
NOW KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CORRIEDALE AND A<br />
MERINO: INDEED, WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING AN EFFECTIVE<br />
MINISTER, I BELIEVE TO COIN A PHRASE YOU HAVE NEVER<br />
HAD IT SO GOOD, ,/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
THE GREEN PAPER WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED AT THE<br />
RURAL FORUM TOMORROW IS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN RURAL POLICY FOR OVER 20 YEARS. I BELIEVE<br />
THAT ALL OF US WHETHER IN GOVERNMENT OR IN RURAL INDUSTRY,<br />
ARE INDEBTED TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS WORKING GROUP AND WILL<br />
REMAIN SO INDEBTED FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. THE REPORT<br />
IS INDEED A SENSITIVE AND INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION OF THE<br />
PROBLEMS FACED BY RURAL INDUSTRIES AND OF THE PRINCIPLES<br />
WHICH SHOULD GUIDE GOVERNMENT ACTION IN MEETING THOSE<br />
PROBLEMS. BEARING IN MIND THE VERY SHORT TIME IN WHICH<br />
THIS REPORT WAS WRITTEN THE JOB DONE BY THE PEOPLE INVOLVED<br />
IS TRULY QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.<br />
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT IN REQUESTING A<br />
GREEN PAPER INDICATES OUR GENERAL APPROACH TO THE MAKING<br />
OF DECISIONS IN THE RURAL SECTOR AND INDEED FOR OTHER<br />
INDUSTRIES. IT SHOWS THE WAY A LABOR GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE<br />
DECISIONS AFTER FULL PUBLIC ENQUIRY AND FREE PUBLIC DEBATE.<br />
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION,<br />
WHICH IS THE FIRST INDEPENDENT BODY TO INQUIRE INTO, ASSESS<br />
AND REPORT UPON ALL REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. AS YOU WOULD<br />
BE AWARE, THE REPORTS OF THE COMMISSION ARE NOW GENERALLY<br />
PUBLISHED BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT MAKES ITS DECISION SO THAT<br />
MEANINGFUL PUBLIC DEBATE CAN OCCUR. i ,/ 4 </p>
<p>-4IPERHAPS<br />
EVEN MORE THAN OTHER SECTORS I BELIEVE<br />
THAT THE IMAGE OF RURAL INDUSTRIES HAS SUFFERED BY THE<br />
ARROGANT ATTITUDES OF SOME POLITICANS, AND, IF I MAY BE<br />
PERMITTED A SOMEWHAT PARTISAN NOTE, OF ONE PARTICULAR<br />
POLITICAL PARTY, THEY OFTEN MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT<br />
RURAL INDUSTRIES HAVE A RIGHT TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE<br />
WITHOUT PUBLIC INQUIRY AND JUSTIFICATION, THE PROCESS OF<br />
DECISION-MAKING OF THE LABOR GOVERNMENT EXEMPLIFIED IN<br />
THE NEW ROLE OF THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
AND IN THE PUBLICATION OF THIS GREEN PAPER WILL ASSIST<br />
IN BREAKING DOWN THE BELIEF OFTEN THE MISCONCEPTION<br />
OF MANY URBAN RESIDENTS THAT RURAL INDUSTRIES RECEIVE<br />
UNFAIR PRIVILEGES AT THE TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF JUDGING<br />
WHETHER OR NOT A GOOD CASE FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN<br />
PRESENTED AND AS TAXPAYERS THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO RECEIVE<br />
IT. THE REPRESENTATIVES OF RURAL INDUSTRIES HAVE IN THE<br />
PAST UNDERESTIMATED THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATING THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND OF CONVINCING<br />
THEM WHENEVER REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE ARE MADE. THE<br />
PUBLICATION OF THIS GREEN PAPER WILL GO A LONG WAY IN<br />
EDUCATING THE BROADER PUBLIC, INCLUDING ECONOMISTS, ABOUT<br />
SOME OF THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS FACING RURAL INDUSTRY, PROBLEMS<br />
WHICH INVOLVE GOVERNMENT POLICY. 1 11/ 5 </p>
<p>WHILST I WOULD NOT PURPORT TO SUMMARISE THE GREEN<br />
PAPER ITSELF I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME ASPECTS OF THE<br />
REPORT WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE.<br />
FIRST IS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE REPORT EMPHASISES THAT A<br />
NATIONAL RURAL POLICY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF A NATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC POLICY AND THAT IT MUST BE JUDGED IN TERMS OF ITS<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OBJECTIVES.<br />
MANY OF THE REPORT'S MORE SPECIFIC COMMENTS ARE IN FACT<br />
CONCERNED WITH THESE BROADER NATIONAL OBJECTIVES. MUCH OF<br />
ITS VALUE DERIVES FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF PARTICULAR PROBLEMS<br />
AND PROPOSALS MEASURED BY THE STANDARD OF NATIONAL GOALS OF<br />
EFFICIENCY, OF WELFARE AND OF EQUALITY.<br />
ONE SUCH CONSIDERATION WHICH THE WORKING GROUP<br />
IDENTIFIES IS THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS. THE REPORT NOTES<br />
" THE POSITION OF THE CONSUMER IS PROPERLY BEING GIVEN<br />
GREATER CONSIDERATION THAN IN THE PAST". THIS PERSPECTIVE<br />
WILL ENHANCE THE VALUE OF THIS REPORT IN PROMOTING A WIDER<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF RURAL POLICIES. THE WORKING GROUP<br />
CORRECTLY NOTES THAT THE QUITE ABSURD RESTRICTIONS UPON<br />
MARGARINE HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED " THE IMAGE" OF ALL RURAL<br />
PRODUCERS. MANY URBAN RESIDENTS WHO ARE AWARE OF THESE<br />
RESTRICTIONS WOULD REGARD THEM AS TYPICAL RATHER THAN AS<br />
THE ABERRATION THEY IN FACT ARE. IF IN OUR DELIBERATIONS<br />
WE CONTINUE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS,<br />
AS THE REPORT RECOMMENDS, THEN I BELIEVE WE WILL ENSURE THE<br />
BROAD ACCEPTABILITY OF THE DECISIONS WHICH WE MAKE. is 1/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THE GREEN PAPER CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES THE MARKET<br />
AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF ALLOCATING PRODUCTIVE<br />
SOURCES IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. IT ALSO RECOGNISES<br />
HOWEVER, THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS A PROPER ROLE TO<br />
INTERVENE IN THE OPERATION OF THE MARKET, PARTLY TO IMPROVE<br />
THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MARKET OPERATES AND PARTLY TO<br />
COMPENSATE FOR ITS, AT TIMES, HARSH CONSEQUENCES. IN<br />
MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISIONS I BELIEVE IT IS TRUE<br />
THAT WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE PRIMACY OF THE MARKET TO A GREATER<br />
EXTENT THAN SOME THOUGHT OR FEARED POSSIBLE. IT IS<br />
USEFUL TO HAVE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE EMPHASISED IN THE MANNER<br />
THAT IT HAS BEEN BY THE WORKING GROUP,<br />
I WOULD NOW LIKE TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES<br />
OUTLINED IN THE REPORT.<br />
ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING ANALYSES IN THIS DOCUMENT<br />
IS THE DISCUSSION OF UNCERTAINTY AND INSTABILITY IN RURAL<br />
INDUSTRY. THE RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN FOR THE WORKING GROUP<br />
SHOWS THAT FLUCTUATIONS IN BOTH PRICE AND OUTPUT ARE<br />
TYPICALLY GREATER FOR AGRICULTURE THAN FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES.<br />
A SURVEY CONDUCTED FOR THE WORKING GROUP BY THE COMMISSIONER<br />
FOR TAXATION SHOWED THAT OVER 40 PER CENT HAD FLUCTUATIONS OF<br />
PER CENT OR MORE IN THEIR YEAR-TO-YEAR INCOMES COMPARED<br />
WITH NO MORE THAN 23 PER CENT FOR OTHER BUSINESS AND<br />
1/ PER CENT FOR WAGE EARNERS. I </p>
<p>-7-<br />
IN CASE SOME OF YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A<br />
NEW REVELATION FOR ME MAY I QUOTE FROM A SPEECH I DELIVERED<br />
AT A DINNER FOR THE AUSTRALIAN FARMERS' FEDERATION IN<br />
OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. I SAID THEN, " THE CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC<br />
OF YOUR INDUSTRY, WHATEVER GOVERNMENT IS IN POWER, IS ITS<br />
VULNERABILITY. MORE THAN ANY OTHER SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY YOU<br />
ARE SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND IMPONDERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
YOU ARE AT THE MERCY OF THE SEASONS, AT THE MERCY OF WORLD<br />
CURRENCY RELIGNMENTS, OF FLUCTUATING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS,<br />
GLUTS AND SHORTAGES.", THE DETAILED TREATMENT OF THIS MOST<br />
SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF RURAL INDUSTRY PRESENTED IN THE GREEN<br />
PAPER WILL SURELY PROVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT<br />
PRACTICAL MATTERS FLOWING FROM OUR CONSIDERATION OF THE REPORT.<br />
I AM SURE THAT IT WILL BE A FEATURE OF YOUR DISCUSSIONS TOMORROW.<br />
THE REPORT DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN<br />
PROVIDING PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR THE INDUSTRY SUCH AS<br />
QUARANTINE, RESEARCH AND EXTENSION AND IN IMPROVING THE<br />
BARGAINING POWER OF INDIVIDUAL PRODUCERS THROUGH MARKETING<br />
SCHEMES AND THE PROMOTION OF CO-OPERATIVES. FURTHER, THE<br />
REPORT CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES THE SPECIAL ROLE A GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
IN ASSISTING OUR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES TO ADJUST TO ECONOMIC<br />
CHANGES. WE HAVE RECENTLY RECObNISED THE PROBLEMS OF STRUCTURAL<br />
ADJUSTMENT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES AS REQUIRING COMPREHENSIVE<br />
GOVERNMENT ATTENTION AND HAVE MADE SPECIAL PROVISION FOR COUNTRY<br />
TOWNS WHICH DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON A SINGLE FIRM.<br />
THE COMMENTS IN THE GREEN PAPER WILL ASSIST US IN THE FURTHER<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS. ./ 8 </p>
<p>ONE SECTION OF THE REPORT HAS RECEIVED RELATIVELY<br />
LITTLE ATTENTION TO DATE. IT IS THE CHAPTER CONCERNING THE<br />
WELFARE OF RURAL PEOPLE, THE WORKING GROUP ACKNOWLEDGES THE<br />
BREVITY OF ITS EXAMINATION OF THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY SERVICES<br />
IN RURAL AREAS. THE REPORT ASSISTS US IN MOVING AWAY FROM<br />
WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED AN INCOMES MENTALITY. So MANY OF THE NEEDS<br />
OF OUR CITIZENS AND THE PROVISION OF ADEQUATE SERVICES MUST<br />
DEPEND ON BROAD COMMUNITY ACTION AND THAT MEANS GOVERNMENT<br />
ACTION. THE CONCERN OF THE WORKING GROUP TO EXPAND THE SCOPE<br />
AND VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO LIVE<br />
IN RURAL AREAS WILL AFFECT THE GOVERNMENT'S CONSIDERATION OF<br />
THE MORE DETAILED REPORTS WE SHALL RECEIVE ON POVERTY,<br />
EDUCATION, HEALTH AND THE PROVISION OF WELFARE SERVICES.<br />
I TRUST THIS ASPECT OF THE REPORT WILL NOT BE LOST IN YOUR<br />
CONSIDERATION OF WHAT SOME WOULD REGARD AS THE MORE PRACTICAL<br />
ASPECTS OF RURAL POLICY.<br />
IT WOULD BE REMISS OF ME NOT TO MAKE SOME COMMENT ON<br />
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GREEN PAPER AND THE MANY DECISIONS<br />
WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IN RELATION TO RURAL POLICY. PERHAPS I<br />
SHOULD BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMENTS IN THE GREEN PAPER ON<br />
THE DIFFICULTY OF COMMUNICATION WITH PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS.<br />
THIS DIFFICULTY IS OF COURSE ACCENTUATED IN THE HEAT OF AN<br />
ELECTION CAMPAIGN. I NOW COME TO SPEAK TO YOU AT THE ONLY TIME<br />
WHEN A POLITICIAN CAN AFFORD TO BE BIPARTISAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER<br />
AN ELECTION. I BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF THE CRITICISM AND INDEED<br />
VILIFICATION OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNWARRANTED. MUCH HAS<br />
BEEN POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS TOO LONG<br />
NOT TO ACCEPT THAT AS PART OF THE GAME. NEVERTHELESS THE PUBLICATION<br />
OF THIS GREEN PAPER ENABLES US TO PLACE THE GOVERNMENT'S PAST<br />
DECISIONS IN THEIR PROPER PERSPECTIVE. </p>
<p>THE WORKING GROUP MAKES FREQUENT REFERENCE TO<br />
CONCESSIONS AND SUBSIDIES WHICH ARE OF GREATEST ADVANTAGE TO THE<br />
MORE WEALTHY PRIMARY PRODUCERS. MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISIONS<br />
WHICH HAVE BEEN MOST SEVERELY CRITICISED RELATED TO CONCESSIONS<br />
AND SUBSIDIES OF THIS NATURE. THEY HAD BEEN INTRODUCED AT A TIME<br />
WHEN THE PREOCCUPATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WAS TO<br />
INCREASE PRODUCTION TO EARN FOREIGN EXCHANGE. THAT TIME HAS<br />
PASSED. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE IGNORE THE VITAL IMPORTANCE<br />
OF ECONOMICALLY HEALTHY AND EFFICIENT INDUSTRIES, INDUSTRIES<br />
WHICH DESPITE ALL THE ATTENTION GIVEN TO MINERAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
STILL PROVIDE OVER HALF OF OUR EXPORTS, IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT<br />
IT NO LONGER PAYS US AS A NATION TO DEVELOP FARMS MORE RAPIDLY<br />
THAN IT WOULD PAY YOU YOURSELVES TO DEVELOP THEM. POLICIES OF<br />
THIS KIND ONLY EXACERBATE THE PROBLEMS OF MATCHING SUPPLY AND<br />
DEMAND. I AM ACUTELY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S POSITIVE POLICIES DO NOT HAVE THE SAME OBVIOUS<br />
IMPACT ON THE FARMER AS HAS THE WITHDRAWAL OF SOME CONCESSIONS.<br />
ONE EXAMPLE IS OUR DECISION TO ESTABLISH AN ANIMAL HEALTH<br />
LABORATORY TO PROTECT OUR LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY FROM FOOT AND MOUTH<br />
AND OTHER EXOTIC DISEASES. IT WILL COST $ 56 MILLION<br />
APPROXIMATELY THE ANNUAL COST OF THE SUPERPHOSPHATE BOUNTY<br />
YET THE BENEFITS TO RURAL PRODUCERS WILL BE INFINITELY GREATER.<br />
THEY MAY NOT BE REFLECTED IN TERMS OF MONEY IN THE POCKET, BUT<br />
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE DISEASES WHICH THE LABORATORY IS DESIGNED<br />
TO PREVENT WOULD WIPE OUT $ 2,000 MILLION IN EXPORT TRADE<br />
OVERNIGHT, </p>
<p>ANOTHER CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
POLICIES HAVE ASSISTED PRIMARY PRODUCERS INDIRECTLY IS THE<br />
TARIFF CUT, THE VALUE OF THIS IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE GREEN<br />
PAPER'S ADOPTION OF A TARIFF COMPENSATION ARGUMENT FOR RURAL<br />
CONCESSIONS. I NOTE WITH SOME PLEASURE THE EXTREMELY FAVOURABLE<br />
COMMENTS MADE BY THE WORKING GROUP ON THE GOVERNMENT'S EXCHANGE<br />
RATE AND TARIFF POLICIES, THE VALUE OF THE TARIFF CUT IS LESS<br />
TANGIBLE, LESS IMMEDIATE AND LESS DIRECT THAN THE CONCESSIONS<br />
WHICH WE HAVE REMOVED, I SUPPOSE THAT WE ALL COME TO BELIEVE<br />
THAT WE DESERVE WHAT WE ARE USED TO RECEIVING, CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
CHANGE AND PRIORITIES CHANGE: A GOVERNMENT IS NOT BEING<br />
" ANTI-RURAL" IF IT RECOGNISES THAT,<br />
IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE NOW TO ASSESS THAT OTHER REPORT<br />
WHICH HAS RECEIVED SO MUCH ATTENTION IN RURAL AREAS, THE<br />
REPORT OF THE COOMBS TASK FORCE, THAT REPORT REPRESENTED A<br />
CLEARING OF THE DECKS TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN<br />
PRIORITIES AND TO GET RID OF THE ACCUMULATED DEADWOOD OF YEARS<br />
OF AD HOC DECISION-MAKING, WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SEEKS<br />
IS A NATIONAL RURAL POLICY BASED ON SUSTAINABLE PRINCIPLES, PRINCIPLES<br />
THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS CAN ACCEPT, THE GREEN PAPER PROVIDES US<br />
WITH SUCH A SET OF PRINCIPLES, ITS CONVENOR, DR STUART HARRIS,<br />
WAS, I SHOULD NOTE IN PASSING, A MEMBER OF THE COOMBS TASK FORCE,<br />
HE HAS PRODUCED A DOCUMENT WHICH I BELIEVE WILL PLACE AUSTRALIAN<br />
RURAL POLICY ON A MORE SOUND, MORE ACCEPTABLE AND MORE PERMANENT<br />
BASIS, THAT BASIS IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE APPROACH ADOPTED<br />
BY THE EARLIER TASK FORCE OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER, , Il </p>
<p>I SHOULD PERHAPS REFER TO TWO ITEMS UPON WHICH THE<br />
COOMBS TASK FORCE REPORTED BUT UPON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED<br />
NOT TO ACT, DROUGHT BONDS AND THE AVERAGING PROVISIONS OF THE<br />
INCOME TAX LEGISLATION, THE GREEN PAPER REPEATS MANY OF THE<br />
CRITICISMS OF THE AVERAGING PROVISIONS, IT RECOGNISES, HOWEVER,<br />
AS THE GOVERNMENT DID, THAT THEY ARE AMONGST THE FEW EXISTING<br />
MEASURES DIRECTLY ALLEVIATING THE PROBLEM OF INCOME INSTABILITY<br />
FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS, NOT A SUBSIDY BUT A RECOGNITION OF THE<br />
SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES OF RURAL PRODUCTION, THE GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
NOW CONSIDER THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE GREEN PAPER WHICH SEEK<br />
TO REFORM AND SYSTEMATISE OUR TREATMENT OF THIS PECULIAR<br />
CHARACTERISTIC OF YOUR INDUSTRY,<br />
IN THIS RESPECT MAY I MAKE ONE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION<br />
FOR DEBATE, THE GREEN PAPER NOTES THAT, GENERALLY SPEAKING,<br />
ALL RISK CROP INSURANCE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN AUSTRALIA, THE RECENT<br />
FLOODS IN SOME PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY HAVE EMPHASISED THIS GAP,<br />
AS YOU WOULD BE AWARE, WE INTEND TO ESTABLISH AN AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT INSURANCE OFFICE, PERHAPS YOU COULD CONSIDER IN<br />
YOUR DELIBERATIONS TOMORROW WHETHER THIS NEW INSTITUTION SHOULD<br />
ESTABLISH A FACILITY OF THE KIND DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT,<br />
THE ARGUMENT IS OFTEN ADVANCED THAT PEOPLE IN RURAL<br />
AREAS SUFFER FROM SEVERE COST OF LIVING DISADVANTAGES FOR WHICH<br />
THEY SHOULD RECEIVE COMPENSATION, OUR POLICIES ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS<br />
CHARGES AND ON THE PETROLEUM PRICE SUBSIDY SCHEME HAVE BEEN<br />
CRITICISED FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, I THEREFORE READ WITH<br />
PARTICULAR INTEREST THE COMMENTS ON THIS MATTER IN THE GREEN PAPER,<br />
THE WORKING GROUP STATES THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE IN RURAL<br />
AREAS SUFFER COST OF LIVING DISABILITIES IS NOT PROVEN, THEY<br />
HIGHLIGHT THE VALUE IN TERMS OF LIVING STANDARDS OF THE LOWER LAND<br />
PRICES AND THE % M4L= ER NEFD FOR FXPENDITURE ON TRAVEL_ TO AND F WORK, </p>
<p>12.<br />
THE REAL DISABILITY LIES IN THE AREAS OF PUBLIC<br />
SERVICES, THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH HAS RECOGNISED THIS FACTS<br />
ONE OF OUR EARLIEST DECISIONS WAS TO ESTABLISH THE SPECIAL<br />
ALLOWANCES FOR ISOLATED CHILDREN. I DO NOT NEED TO REPEAT THE<br />
HIGH PRIORITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT ATTACHES TO EDUCATION, WE ARE<br />
DETERMINED TO SEE THAT INEQUALITIES IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM ARE<br />
ABOLISHED INCLUDING INEQUALITIES WHICH ARISE FROM GEOGRAPHICAL<br />
CONSIDERATIONS. THERE ARE, OF COURSE, OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES WHICH<br />
REQUIRE HEAVY SUBSIDIES, IT IS A BASIC QUESTION OF PRIORITIES TO<br />
DECIDE WHICH SHOULD BE SUBSIDISED, THE SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES ON<br />
RURAL PASSENGER SERVICES OF STATE RAILWAYS CAN IMPOSE INTOLERABLE<br />
BURDENS ON GOVERNMENT FINANCES. WE HAVE FACED DECISIONS ON SUCH<br />
PRIORITIES. THE RURAL CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT IT COSTS UP TO $ 20,000 PER CONNECTION TO PROVIDE AUTOMATIC<br />
TELEPHONE SERVICES IN AREAS WITH LESS THAN 200 TELEPHONES, TEN<br />
TIMES MORE THAN IN THE CAPITAL CITIES. YET OUR MUCH CRITICISED<br />
DECISION TO INCREASE TELEPHONE RENTALS FOR NON-METROPOLITAN<br />
SUBSCRIBERS WILL REDUCE THE OPERATING LOSSES OF $ 100 MILLION IN<br />
19/ 1-72 ON COUNTRY POSTAL AND TELECOMMUNICATION CHARGES BY ABOUT<br />
$ 18 MILLION PER ANNUM. THIS DECISION SHOULD BE CONTRASTED WITH<br />
THE ISOLATED CHILDREN ALLOWANCES. WE ARE A GOVERNMENT COMMITTED<br />
TO IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH, EDUCATION AND WELFARE. THIS IS A<br />
MATTER OF PRIORITIES; IT IS NOT A MATTER OF ANTI-RURAL BIAS,<br />
PEOPLE MAY CRITICISE OUR PRIORITIES, THAT IS THEIR RIGHT, As<br />
LONG AS THE DEBATE ABOUT OUR ATTITUDE TO RURAL COMMUNITIES IS<br />
CONDUCTED IN THOSE TERMS I WILL BE HAPPY TO PUT OUR CASE. ,/ 13 </p>
<p>13,<br />
NOTHING HOWEVER, EXASPERATES ME MORE THAN THE BASELESS<br />
ACCUSATION THAT LABOR IS AN ANTI-RURAL PARTY OR THAT I AM<br />
PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE CITIES, LABOR IS NEITHER AN URBAN<br />
NOR A RURAL PARTY, WE ARE A NATIONAL PARTY GUIDED BY NATIONAL<br />
CONSIDERATIONS, OF COURSE WE MUST BE CONCERNED WITH THE PLACES<br />
WHERE MOST AUSTRALIANS LIVE, PARTICULARLY AS THE GENERAL ISSUE<br />
OF THE CITIES HAD BEEN IGNORED IN AUSTRALIAN POLITICS UNTIL WE<br />
MADE IT AN ISSUE, THAT DOES NOT DETRACT FROM MY CONCERN, OR<br />
MY PARTY'S CONCERN, FOR THE PROBLEMS AND NEEDS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES,<br />
NOW THAT THE ELECTION IS OVER, LET US STOP THESE<br />
BASELESS ACCUSATIONS, LET US RENEW THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU REPRESENT, I COULD NOT<br />
THINK OF A MORE PROPER BASIS FOR THIS DIALOGUE THAN THE<br />
EXCELLENT GREEN PAPER WHICH YOU WILL DISCUSS TOMORROW,<br />
