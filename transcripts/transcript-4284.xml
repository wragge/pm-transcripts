J. jAUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 3 DECEMBER 1976.<br />
DIAMOND VALLEY DINNER<br />
The annivei-sary we are celebrating tonight is one worth<br />
-celebrating., December 13, 1975 will, -go down-as one of the<br />
really important dates in Australian history.<br />
The 1975 election stands alongside 1949. The Australian people<br />
made one of their crucial decisions they chose freedom,<br />
responsibility, and constitutional government.<br />
Members of the Liberal Party around Australia worked for that<br />
result as never before. And they succeeded om getting the;<br />
Liberal Party's message over to the people.<br />
We all knew that if we failed last year, so many things<br />
Australians valued would be damaged beyond repair<br />
On December 13 last year, the Australian people made clear that<br />
they believed Australia required a profound change of national<br />
direction. In November last year, to achieve this objective we placed before<br />
the Australian people one of the most far reaching programmes<br />
ever proposed by a major party in Australia.<br />
We undertook to give Australia a government which respected the right<br />
of people to build their own lives without being told what<br />
to do by a few people who calimed to know what was good<br />
for everyone. We undertook to take whatever action was necessary<br />
to defeat inflation, restore employment opportunities and put<br />
the Australian economy on a sound footing.<br />
We undertook to adopt a new approach to social security which<br />
stressed the importance of directing assistance to those in<br />
genuine need to those who had suffered most from Labor's inflation.<br />
We undertook to implement major reforms to the Federal system<br />
a radical reassertion of the relevance of federalism and of our<br />
belief that government should be close to the people. / 2 </p>
<p>We put forward a foreign policy and defence apporach<br />
based on a realistic appreciation of Australia's security needs.<br />
Our program me reaffirmed the vitality of the. Liberal Party's<br />
philosophy, and established the relevance of that philosophy<br />
to the needs of Australia.<br />
Our top priority was the economy and in particular the defeat<br />
of inflation. When we came to office we were faced by the worst<br />
unemployment sincethe nineteen thirties; an actual declines in th:<br />
gross domestic product; a depression in company profits;<br />
a decline in business investment to its lowest level in three<br />
years; a desperate situation in the farming sector;<br />
an inflation rate that was fourteen percent higher than it had b.<br />
a year before and showing no substantive indications of declining.<br />
We were also faced by an overvalued currency which placed great<br />
burdens on particular groups in the community manufacturers,<br />
all exporters, import competing industries.<br />
In this situation, we had to establish a balance between the varioarms<br />
of policy in order to create the conditions for a return<br />
to sustained economic growth.<br />
In the light -of comments in recent days, the strategy we have<br />
adopted consistently since the election bears repeating.<br />
Its main elements are the most rigorous restraint on government<br />
spending to rein in. the bloated public sector and free resources<br />
to productive private enterprise; the provision of a wide<br />
range of incentives to industry to resume expansion and provide<br />
employmentopportunities; seizing every opportunity to emphasise<br />
the importance of restraint in wage and salary demands. This<br />
is essential to keep costs down and create conditions in which<br />
employment opportunities can be expanded as rapidly as possible.<br />
We always said that this strategy would take time that it would<br />
be a full three year programme. The strategy we have adopted<br />
is the right strategy. It is the only strategy which is going to<br />
work. We have pursued it consistently throughout this year.<br />
There are already signs that it is achieving success<br />
in the fight against inflation. The 2.2% increase in prices in<br />
the September quarter was the smallest increase with the exceptii<br />
of the Meidbank quarter) since the March quarter 1973.<br />
It is in this context that the decision to devalue the Australian<br />
dollar must be understood. We have always been aware thnt the<br />
Australian dollar was overvalued. Indeed, this has been almost<br />
universally acknowledged. Costs in Australia particularly<br />
wage costs had become out of line with those of our major<br />
trading partners. A case for devaluation could have been made<br />
earlier in the year.<br />
We did not devalue because we considered it essential that the<br />
other major arms of policy budgetary policy, monetary policy anc*<br />
wages policy be brought to focus in the fight against inflation. </p>
<p>Accordingly, on the budgetary side, we reduced the rate of<br />
growth in government spending from 23% to 11%. 1 do not recall<br />
any significant suggestion that we should have been even<br />
more stringent in this regard. The restraint we imposed enabled<br />
us to introduce significant personal and company tax reforms,<br />
including full personal income tax indexation.<br />
A range of incentives for business expansion and to star ' t oil<br />
and minerals exploration moving again were also introduced.<br />
On the monetary side we have imposed considerable restraint<br />
throughout the year.<br />
On the wages side, wehave argued consistently before the Arbitration<br />
Commission in every wage hearing of the absolute necessity<br />
for restraint. In the last six year, wages in Australia's<br />
manufacturing industry increased 130% compared with 53% in<br />
the U. S. and 70%: in West Germany. I recall we were attacked<br />
earlier in the year for arguing as strongly as we did.<br />
E -ren then there were those who predicted that if the government<br />
ba-sed its policies on economic commonsense, the result would<br />
be confrontation with the unions.<br />
Unfortunately, too much credence has been given to the threats of<br />
extremist union leaders ot create further conflict.<br />
There has been a capitulation to threats instead of economic<br />
commonsense. Not enough weight has been given to the great<br />
commonsense of the vast majority of rank and file trade union<br />
members who know full well the importance of restraint at this time.<br />
I believe most are disgusted as Australians with the disruptive<br />
tactics of a few.<br />
This government will not allow an unreasonable burden in the<br />
fight against inflation to fall on wage and salary earners.<br />
There must be an equitable distribution of the burden. All sections<br />
of the community must behave responsibly.<br />
As a result of excessive wage and salary increases the dollar has<br />
remained overvalued throughout this year writh damaging effects on<br />
our exporting industries primary, secondary, mining and import<br />
competing industries.<br />
These are the productive sectors of our economy the sectors that<br />
produce the resources with which governments can provide the<br />
services they should. These are the sectors that had been hardest<br />
hit by cost escalation, that were not indexed to inflation.<br />
Unlike those protected by wage indexation they were out in the cold,<br />
and these are the sectors which devaluation will benefit.<br />
All of these industries have been hit by the escalation of costs in<br />
Australia, and job opportunities in these industries have been<br />
restricted as a result.<br />
The situation we faced last week was that despite substantial<br />
overseas borrowing by the government,' our international reserves<br />
fell by $ 1,000 million in the last twelve months. / 4 </p>
<p>The loss of reserves accelerated in the last few months,<br />
declining by over $ 500 million in two months.<br />
The prospect was for an unacceptable outflow of capital in<br />
December and early January.<br />
Last week the Government's official advisers jointly presented<br />
two options to handle this situation: Further international<br />
borrowings, of around $ 1,000 million, or devaluation.<br />
The government could not accept a situation where uncertainty<br />
and speculation would be sustained. We were not prepared to put<br />
Australia into hock for another $ 1,000 million with no assurance<br />
that this would be sufficient.<br />
Devalua tion was therefore-the only responsible option open to us.<br />
As I said before, it is a most serious matter when a government<br />
is forced to take an action of this kind. It indicates how<br />
severely rising internal costs principally from wage and<br />
salary increases we cannot afford have eroded our international<br />
position. It demonstrates not that our anti-inflationary strategy has<br />
been wrong. Rather it shows the necessity for pursuing that strat<br />
with even greater vigor than before.<br />
Devaluation is a recognition of the reality of our situation.<br />
It will unquestionably assist those of our industries most<br />
damaged by the overvalued dollar. It can therefore have<br />
positive effects. Investment projects which have been deferred<br />
can now get underway with their job and income creating potential.<br />
Mining and exporting industries generally which made such an<br />
important contribution to Australia's prosperity will now have<br />
thier position considerably strengthened. The disastrously<br />
depressed farming sector the gravity of whose position<br />
is often under estimated will obtain an improved position in<br />
world markets.<br />
The competitive position of manufacturing industry competing<br />
with imported goods will be strengthened, and the benefits<br />
of this will flow on to all those dependent on a vigorous<br />
manufacturing sector. Employment opportunities can increase.<br />
These&amp;. industries have taken far too many shocks in the last<br />
few years the Whitlam Government's 25% across the board tariff<br />
cut, inflation, and unrasonable cost increases.<br />
The Government will not take action without proper examination.<br />
If these : re areas where tariffs are operating, and there is not<br />
domestic production, the government willbe looking to see what<br />
can be done. This applies particularly to imports of producers<br />
materials and equipment.<br />
As there is a transfer from imports to domestic production,<br />
production runs in Australia should increase. This should give<br />
Australian manufacturers an opportunity to contain costs.<br />
They have a great responsibility to do so. </p>
<p>The prosperity of these sectors is vital to us all, and the flow<br />
of benefits will spur recovery.<br />
But that will not occur if costs continue to rise, unreasonably,<br />
if inflation does not continue to be controlled.<br />
To ensure that this devaluation is a positive element in economic<br />
recovery, it is therefore essential that our anti infla. tion<br />
strategy be pursued relentlessly.<br />
We intend to bring the other arms of policy budgetary,<br />
monetary and wages policy even more firmly to bear in the fight<br />
against inflation. An immediate review of all government programmes<br />
is being initiated. This review will identify areas where further<br />
savings can be made by the deferrment of expenditures.<br />
Undoubtedly this new stringency is going to mean the deferment<br />
of some projects. It would not be necessary if wage and salary<br />
demands had been adequately restrained. On the monetary side,<br />
it is unfortunately necessaty to increase interest rates.<br />
The Australian savings bond has gone up 0.2% to<br />
The Bank has completed action to establish a new regime of<br />
government bond yields of 0.5% at the short end and substantially<br />
less than that at the long end. The volume of lending by<br />
financial instituttions will also be closely monitored to ensure<br />
that the growth in lending comes back from recent excessive levels.<br />
The wages front and industrial relations are obviously vital.<br />
Restraint is essential. The Government will take every possible<br />
action in its power which can contribute to wage, salary and<br />
price restraint. Let me state the Government's position so that<br />
there can be no possible misunderstanding.<br />
Inflation is the enemy Australia must defeat. It undermines security<br />
destroys the values of savings and incomes, hinders the expansion<br />
of job opportunities, erodes our position in teh world, and<br />
in the end, eats away at confidence in our institutions.<br />
We are going to beat inflation.<br />
We are going to do whatever is necessary to beat inflation.<br />
This is a time when every Australian has to ask themselves<br />
what they are prepared to do. The Government cannot do this<br />
job alone. In 1975, Australia had the third worst strike record<br />
in the western world. This is what is damaging our country more<br />
than anything else the utterly selfish pursuit of advantage,<br />
regardless of its costs to other members of the community.<br />
An increasing number of people are prepared to stand up and sayno<br />
they will not strike without good reason, and they will not<br />
go along with those who urge disruption and conflict.<br />
This week's decision forced us to face again the fundamental question<br />
where do we want Australia to go?<br />
Throughout this year we have acted to help those damaged by inflation<br />
The family allowances scheme has brought thousands of families back<br />
out of poverty; we have restored an expanded home savings<br />
grant scheme to help young couples close the deposit gap).<br />
We have initiated a housing allowqance voucher exp~ eriment to </p>
<p>expand the choice of low income families. We are adjusting<br />
pensions automatically to compensate for price rises.<br />
WE have indexed personal income tax to put an end to<br />
un-legislated tax increases. We have increased the real value<br />
of spending on education to expand opportunities.<br />
We have also begun the major task of decentralising government<br />
power. We have legislated for a federal ombudsman to protect<br />
citizens against officials. We have introduced mandato~ ry<br />
secret postal ballots for all union elections.<br />
These are all important Liberal measures which will be<br />
lasting achievements of this government. Above all, however,<br />
we will be judged by our capacity to restore economic health to<br />
Australia. That is the battle we have been fighting since we were elected.<br />
Our strategy has already achieved significant results.<br />
And it is the right strategy.<br />
In the battle against inflation we need the support of<br />
every person who believes in a free and democratic Australia.<br />
The strategy we have pursued t: hroughout this year is the only<br />
one which will work. In the light of devaluation we will be<br />
pursuing it harder than ever.<br />
We knew this-fight: would be tough. It is tough. It is going<br />
to be tough for a long time. It is a fight we are going to win. </p>
