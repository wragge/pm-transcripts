    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will attend the 37th Pacific Islands Forum leaders' meeting in Nadi, Fiji, from 23-25 October 2006.</p>
<p>Leaders from the 16 Pacific island countries will discuss practical proposals to improve governance and pool regional resources.  They will also consider the findings of a review into regional institutions.</p>
<p> Progress made over the past year by the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) also will be reviewed.  I will be seeking an appropriate acknowledgment of RAMSI's strong contributions to governance, security and the economy, and of the continuing importance of RAMSI as an integrated mission under Australian leadership.</p>
