PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, ORIENTAL HOTEL, 22 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
PM: Ladies and Geritlemen, I will start by going over for<br />
the benefit of the non-Australian contingent an outline<br />
that I gave to them yesterday of the talks that Foreign<br />
Minister, Bill Hayden and I had with the Prime Minister and<br />
Foreign Minister of Thailand and then add some further<br />
comments to that.<br />
In those discussions yesterday I repeated what both Mr. Hayden<br />
and I had said consistently inside our own Parliament and<br />
elsewhere the condemnation by the Australian Government of<br />
Vietnam's invasion and continued occupation of Cambodia.<br />
I added that from our point of view there should be a phased<br />
withdrawal leading to a total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops<br />
from Cambodia. There there should then be an act of<br />
self-determination for and by the Cambodian people and the<br />
creation of the conditions which would permit displaced<br />
Cambodians to return to their country and for normal<br />
relations to be resumed between Vietnam, China, the ASEAN<br />
countries and the international community at large. We<br />
indicated in our discussions yesterday that we attached very<br />
considerable importance to ending Vietnam's present political<br />
and economic isolation and the growing reliance on the Soviet<br />
Union which was, in our judgement, simply entrenching great<br />
power rivalry in the region.<br />
We indicated yesterday to the Prime Minister and the Foreign<br />
Minister that our Government intended offering disaster relief<br />
assistance to Vietnam and you have seen the reference to that,<br />
but that we had taken no decisions in practical terms to resume<br />
development assistance to Vietnam. We have not taken any such<br />
decision. Now, we also pointed out to th Prime Minister and Foreign<br />
Minister that while Australian aid was continuing to be<br />
directed to displaced Cambodians in the Thai/ Cambodia border<br />
area, we also indicated to your leaders that Australia<br />
continued to consider that meeting the humanitarian aid needs<br />
of internees inside Cambodia was also necessary.<br />
One of our main intentions in the discussions was to convey to<br />
the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister our very great<br />
concern Australia's very great concern at the possibility<br />
of any return to power of a regime as brutal as the Khmer<br />
Rouge in Cambodia. </p>
<p>I can say that both General Prem and I agreed that our<br />
discussions had been useful in clarifying the misunderstandings<br />
which had recently arisen. We agreed that both Australia and<br />
Thailand had the same view about the Cambodian situation,<br />
carried disturbing implications for peaceful relations amongst<br />
all the countries of the SE Asian region. And on the main<br />
issues of principle that I have repeated to you-that is the<br />
condemnation of the invasion by Vietnamese forces; the<br />
necessity for-withdrawal of those forces; the creation of<br />
the conditions wherein there can be the free expression of<br />
the will of the Cambodian people; the creation of the conditions<br />
for the return of refugees and displaced persons; and the<br />
emergence of a free and independent, non-aligned Cambodia<br />
on those basic issue of principle, there was a fundamental<br />
agreement between Australia and Thailand and the Prime Minister<br />
and I while noting that there was room for differences of<br />
emphasis and approach in the manner in which each country<br />
sought to give effect to these agreed principles we agreed<br />
and accepted that each country was directing its efforts towards<br />
the achievement of those objectives. And we agreed that we<br />
would continue to work in the closest possible contact and<br />
communications on those matters or mutual interest. So, may<br />
I therefore sum up in respect of that overall coverage which I<br />
had conveyed to the Australian media yesterday, may I sum up<br />
by saying that both Bill Hayden and I could not have been more<br />
satisfied than we were with the talks that took place yesterday.<br />
In addition to those matters in respect of Indo-China generally<br />
we also discussed a number of bilateral matters and those<br />
discussions will lead, we know, to a further strengthening of<br />
the relations between our two countries.<br />
Yesterday afternoon Mr. Hayden signed with your Foreign<br />
Minister a co-financing agreement which is between our two<br />
countries and the handling of the World Bank finance project<br />
within which we will be involved in a managerial capacity.<br />
There had been some suggestion of the difficulty about that.<br />
Those difficulties have been resolved and Mr. Hayden signed<br />
that co-financing agreement yesterday and I also indicated<br />
yesterday that Australia will be joining an association of tin<br />
producing countries a move which had been urged upon us by<br />
your government.<br />
Now, I have in going over those previous matters, indicated to<br />
you our basic position in regard to Cambodia, but I would add<br />
now these observations to what I said to our press yesterday<br />
and what I've outlined to you. I want to emphasise that<br />
Australia recognises the concern of Thailand as a front line<br />
state, its special concerns with the problems in the area to<br />
which I've been referring and it's because Australia recognises<br />
that particular security concern of Thailand that we, as an<br />
Australian Government, have increased our contribution under<br />
the defence co-operation program. That: has been lifted from an<br />
amount of zero some four years ago to an amount of over<br />
$ 4 million now. We will continue to give emphasis to that. </p>
<p>It involves contributions not only' here into Thailand, but<br />
maintaining the availability of a wide range of training<br />
positions for Thai Armed Forces personnel within our training<br />
programs in Australia.<br />
Now, the second point I would make is that Australia has,<br />
through Mr. Hayden and myself referred to our ability to<br />
speak to all the main protagonists in this Indo-China problem. 7-<br />
the ASEAN countries, China, the United States, and Vietnam<br />
itself. But Mr. Hayden, who has had the main carriage of<br />
this, and I have from the beginning made it clear that we<br />
recognise appropriately the modesty of our aspirations in this<br />
regard and we, of course, accept quite straightforwardly, and<br />
it is appropriate to say it here, that the capacity of Thailand<br />
in these matters is potentially greater than our own, but we,<br />
because of the connections and positions we have, will continue<br />
to do what we can.<br />
Now, the final point that I would wish to make in rounding<br />
off the outline of Australia's position is that we have<br />
referred and I did hear again this morning to the dangers<br />
associated with the isolation of Vietnam in its relations with<br />
the Soviet Union. I want to make it quite clear that we<br />
understand that this has been a choice of Vietnam itself.<br />
It made a conscious decision to be dependent upon the Soviets<br />
in this way. We don't say or imply that it has been something<br />
of the making of the ASEAN countries. What we are talking<br />
about and I believe what ASEAN is talking about is trying<br />
to provide some incentives for Vietnam to reduce that dependency.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, that was all I would wish to say at this<br />
stage and I would finally make the observation, however,<br />
generally in regard to our visit. I know I speak for Bill<br />
Hayden when I say this, that we want to thank General Prem<br />
and Air Chief Marshall Siddhi for the cordiality of their<br />
welcome, the frankness of the exchanges between us and the way<br />
in which we have both been able to not merely indicate the<br />
Australian position, but I believe as a result of that, to<br />
leave here now with the relations between our two countries<br />
even stronger than they have been in the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what sort of incentives do you<br />
have in mind?<br />
PM: Well, the position that all of the ASEAN countries and<br />
ourselves have been directing our attention to is one in which<br />
the forces of Vietnam and the Vietnamese Government could be<br />
satisfied that once they have phased withdrawal leading-to a<br />
total withdrawal, that they woul~ d be satisfied that the<br />
vacuum that was left was not going to be filled by the forces<br />
of the Khmer Rouge as a dominant influence and we believe that<br />
that is what we can work for that there are signs on both<br />
sides if you look at the September statement of the ASEAN<br />
countries and certain responses from Vietnam that there is<br />
some evidence of a loosening up of hitherto uncompromising<br />
attitudes and if we can create that situation then we could<br />
obviously be looking to a position where there would be very<br />
sound reasons for the countries of this area and others to start<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
to themselves to have more formal and constructive relations<br />
with Vietnam. It can't be, in our judgement, be seen by<br />
Vietnam itself, or any of the countries of this region, to<br />
be in any of their interests to have this almost total<br />
reliance by Vietnam on the Soviet Union. So, you've got<br />
to move towards the situation where they can see the virtue<br />
in ending that reliance in the way that I've suggested. </p>
