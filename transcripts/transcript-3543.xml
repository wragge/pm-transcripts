PRESS STATEMENT NO. 412<br />
12 December 1974<br />
WORKING PARTIES ON THE ECONOMY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said today the<br />
Australian Government has still not received assurances from<br />
all States that they would co-operate in implementing<br />
joint economic measures, particularly in relation to prices.<br />
Mr Whitlam was commenting on a report that the<br />
South Australian Premier, Mr Dunstan, had claimed that the<br />
Australian Government had ignored offers-by the States to hand<br />
over their powers on prices to the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal. Mr Whitlam also denied that there had been any<br />
breakdown on the Australian Government's part in implementing<br />
recommendations of joint Commonwealth/ State working parties<br />
on prospective joint economic action. I<br />
He said only two State Governments Tasmania and<br />
South Australia had said they would co-operate fully with<br />
the Australian Government on strengthening the powers of the<br />
Prices Justification Tribunal.<br />
He had written to the Premiers as long ago as<br />
16 September. So far Queensland had not replied at all,<br />
Victoria had not yet indicated its attitude and New South<br />
Wales and Western Australia had said they wanted a special<br />
Premiers'm Conference but did not say if they accepted the<br />
proposal. Mr Whitlam said the Australian Government had dealt<br />
promptly with the report from working parties dealing with<br />
various aspects of inflation. The working parties were concerned<br />
with action to limit wage increases; the multiplicity of wage<br />
fixing tribunals; tax penalties on companies granting excessive<br />
wage increases; State legislation to support the jurisdiction<br />
of the Prices Justification Tribunal; Government tendering<br />
procedures; and on control of restrictive trade practices. </p>
<p>2<br />
The working parties had been commissioned by the<br />
Premiers' Conference on 13 August.<br />
The Australian Government was anxious to get State<br />
approval for the transfer of powers recommended by these<br />
groups of Australian and State Government officials, Mr. Whitlam<br />
said.<br />
