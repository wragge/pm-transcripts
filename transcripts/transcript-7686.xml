PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 JULY 1989<br />
I am delighted to announce the appointment of Sir Ninian<br />
Stephen as Australia's first Ambassador for the Environment.<br />
Sir Ninian will clearly bring a wealth of knowledge and<br />
experience to this important assignment, which will involve<br />
the following tasks:<br />
to project and promote the Government's international<br />
environmental policies to the international community<br />
and within Australia;<br />
to advise the Government on international environmental<br />
policy matters;<br />
to represent the Government in bilateral, regional and<br />
multilateral environmental negotiations, meetings and<br />
conferences ( eg the United Nations Environment<br />
Programme, relevant Antarctic Treaty system meetings,<br />
ad hoc conferences such as The Hague); and<br />
to assist in liaison between the Government and domestic<br />
and international non-governmental environmental<br />
organisations.<br />
Sir Ninian will report to two ministers Senator Evans and<br />
Senator Richardson and to me.<br />
Many of the world's environmental problems are global in<br />
nature and can only be successfully tackled by concerted<br />
international action.<br />
Examples include the prospect of global warming induced by<br />
the greenhouse effect, the damage done to the ozone layer by<br />
chlorofluorocarbons and halons, acid rain, the loss of<br />
biological diversity, transfrontier pollution and disposal<br />
of wastes and the over-exploitation of the world's ocean<br />
fisheries.<br />
The need to tackle these problems through international<br />
collaboration is now well recognised.<br />
As a result, an increasing number of initiatives are<br />
developing which require Australian participation in the<br />
fullest possible way. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Some of these initiatives come under the umbrella of the<br />
United Nations, and others arise under different sponsorship<br />
such as within the Commonwealth.<br />
Given the rapidly growing dimension of these problems and of<br />
the international efforts to counter them, Sir Ninian's<br />
appointment will help give Australia a strong and clear<br />
voice in the important international debates on<br />
environmental issues now taking place.<br />
Sir Ninian will be overseas for the next four months, on<br />
previously-arranged assignments. He will take up his duties<br />
immediately in a part-time capacity, and will assume a<br />
full-time role upon his return to Australia. </p>

Mdboumo, ViC, 3( It(<br />
1 am delighted to accept the offer of appointment as Australia's<br />
mmbassador for the Environment.<br />
The position will, I am sure, be both challenging arid absorbing.<br />
I nope that in it I can be of some service to Australia and at<br />
the same time help, as best I can, in tackling those<br />
environmental problems that are now proving of world-wide<br />
concern. Tne issues they raise are, of course, global and Australia has a<br />
real part to play in facing them. They also happen to be ones<br />
which, even more than most international issues, present<br />
opportunities for really constructive dialogue between nations.<br />
Like so many other Australians, I have long had a personal<br />
interest in them and very much look forward to playing an active<br />
part in advancing Australia's concerns through this new<br />
assignment.<br />
