4~ j, A U) ST X A L IA(<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, J~ r NO) VEMPER 1982<br />
A PROGRAM FOR JOBS<br />
Normally I would not be making a statement at this time<br />
especially since recuperation from this operation takes<br />
some weeks. But the proposal for a special Premiers'<br />
Conference which Mr. Anthony has announced is vital to<br />
our economic future. It is vital to creating more jobs.<br />
I simply want to emphasise how important it is for<br />
people in jobs to be willing to give up something to<br />
help those people who cannot get jobs or who are in<br />
danger of losing them.<br />
Very large sums will be provided for constructive<br />
capital works to provide jobs for the unemployed as a<br />
result of a total wage pause across the nation. Such<br />
actions would provide a massive blow against inflation<br />
and a great help to Australians in difficulty.<br />
What fairer way to redress the ills of Australia? Many<br />
people in this nation are being hurt. inflation is<br />
high, unemployment is high, there are worse dangers<br />
ahead, and the Government is determined that they be<br />
avoided.<br />
There has been deepening of world recession, a recession<br />
which has gone on longer than anyone expected. This<br />
recession has hurt more people than anyone would have<br />
believed possible even a few years ago. In many<br />
countries, unemployment is much higher than in<br />
Australia. It is over 12% in Canada, nearly 13% in the<br />
U. K. Under the pressures of recession and of massive<br />
unemployment overseas wage increases have been very low,<br />
and as a result their inflation rates are in many cases<br />
falling and much below Australia's.<br />
Up to the best part of a year ago, many Australians<br />
thought we had it made and hundreds of thousands of<br />
new jobs had been created. But world recession was<br />
starting to hit Australia hard even then and the wage<br />
settlements and reductions in hours that were forced or<br />
negotiated through last year p~ roved a certain kind of<br />
madness. </p>
<p>Average weekly earnings for males have risen at an<br />
annual rate of nearly 17% in the year to the September<br />
quarter. Yet profits were down, our export incomes were<br />
down, our income as a nation was down. Too many felt<br />
that they could pay themselves more and work even less.<br />
It is not possible to have high, rising incomes with<br />
national productivity falling.<br />
Our own madness came at the worst possible time. Last<br />
year's wage decisions and shorter hours came at the very<br />
time when the cold hard world of trade and of recession<br />
was making it harder than ever to sell Australian goods,<br />
to enlarge Australian markets. If our industries can't<br />
sell, they can't employ.<br />
The nation is now divided between the great majority<br />
who have jobs, and the growing minority who do not.<br />
Those working have generally higher wages and better<br />
conditions than ever before.<br />
The cost, however, is high unemployment. The wages that<br />
are paid to those in work are paid partly at the expense<br />
of those out of work. The inequality, the unfairness is<br />
obvious. This is a time when those Australians in work<br />
need to give up something to assist those out of work,<br />
or who may become out of work if nothing is done.<br />
Reasons of common humanity demand it.<br />
There are critical and challenging problems ahead of us.<br />
We must shake off the attitudes, the prejudices that<br />
have led to too much division in the past. We must<br />
reunite this nation in one cause based on the dignity<br />
and on the rights of all Australians, based on our<br />
feelings and our duties to each other as Australians.<br />
The plan of action and assistance which Mr. Anthony has<br />
announced will be asking for some sacrifices from all<br />
Australians who are in work, to assist those who are out<br />
of work. This plan will strengthen and greatly enlarge<br />
the impact of the decisions already taken through this<br />
year, especially-in the budget, to improve the position<br />
of families and taxpayers, to help home buyers and needy<br />
groups, to increase capital works, and to encourage<br />
Australian industry to be modern and efficient so it can<br />
compete and provide jobs in a difficult world.<br />
Many of the budget measures are starting to take effect<br />
in this month of November, because that is when they<br />
become operative, but more is required.<br />
In this plan of action which has been announced, we are<br />
asking for the co-operation of all Governments, of all<br />
States, of local government, of industry, of the great<br />
body of the union movement. There is a role for each </p>
<p>3.<br />
and every Australian in what we propose, in what we<br />
intend. And much more obviously can and will be done if<br />
the States are prepared to join with us in a<br />
full-blooded partnership.<br />
if all governments divert the funds that would otherwise<br />
go into wage increases into constructive capital works,<br />
much additional employment will be created. We would be<br />
suggesting the funds should go into employment-creating<br />
programs that could be started as soon as possible, and<br />
would achieve a permanent benefit to the nation.<br />
I place the highest possible importance on the<br />
implementation of this program of action. I place the<br />
highest importance on other people following this lead<br />
from the Commonwealth.<br />
The wage pause would assist industry to restore its<br />
profitability and thus help renew employment growth<br />
for while government can ease the problem temporarily<br />
the great bulk of new jobs must be provided by private<br />
enterprise. We must get our costs back into line, we must make<br />
ourselves competitive, we must enter the real world<br />
again, we must sell Australian goods no matter how hard<br />
and how difficult the competitive world outside may be.<br />
We must help ourselves.<br />
In Australia we have the best country in the world.<br />
We have the best people. We have more resources than<br />
most. With wrong and foolish policies it is possible to<br />
fritter them all away. If that happens the world will<br />
sit by and wonder. We cannot reach for shallow and<br />
false solutions. None of that is Australia's way. It<br />
is not the Government's way.<br />
I ask you all to rise to support this program. I ask<br />
you all to work for Australian recovery. I ask you all<br />
to be prepared to forego future wage increases to help<br />
other people and to help this nation. I call on<br />
management and labour to produce efficiently and<br />
economically, and to preserve jobs.<br />
By pulling together Australians have beaten depressions<br />
and won wars.<br />
There is no doubt that using the funds that would<br />
otherwise go to paying increased wages for constructive<br />
capital works for the provision of more jobs, will be a<br />
vital step in reversing the trend towards more and more<br />
people being out of work. </p>
<p>4.<br />
It is time we remembered that no one owes us a living.<br />
It is our own effort, as Australians, our own work, our<br />
own determination that will decide Australia's future.<br />
By recognising that we are all part of one nation, we<br />
can build and rebuild the kind of Australia that our<br />
hearts desire. ooo000ooo---</p>
