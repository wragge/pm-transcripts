PRIME MINISTER ' 12 OCTOBER 1979<br />
from the Press Office Summary of<br />
A letter from a Deputy President of the Arbitration Commission,<br />
Mr Justice Staples, which was distributed to his colleagues<br />
in the Commission, has angered the Federal Government which is<br />
seeking legal advice from Senator Durack on Mr Justice Staples<br />
position. The letter was highly critical of the Government's<br />
admendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, likening<br />
some of the provisions to laws in pre-war Germany. Mr Street<br />
commented this morning on the letter:<br />
Mr Street: I have given a copy to the Attorney-General<br />
and no aoubt he will be giving me his comments in due<br />
course. Question: Have you seen Sir John Moore about this<br />
letter you received?,<br />
Mr Street: No, as you know Sir John is not well.<br />
I rang him last night merely to say that this<br />
document was in the hands of the press.<br />
Question: Are you astounded by the tone of it?<br />
Mr Street: I am astounded at the document coming<br />
from somebody with the title of Judge.<br />
Question: It would be extremely difficult-to move<br />
anybody It would require a vote of both Houses of<br />
Parliament. That would seem rather difficult in the<br />
Senate. Could there be any plans to move Mr Justice Staples<br />
sideways?<br />
Mr Street: We haven't even considered anything of that<br />
kind whatever.<br />
Question: Would you like to see him off the Commission Sir?<br />
Mr Street: No comment at all.<br />
Question: Mr Street, you have had it for some time. When<br />
did you dcide to seek legal advice on it?'<br />
Mr Street: Seek legal advice? That is rather a strange<br />
expression. As soon as I got it, which was a day or two<br />
ago, I gave it to the Attorney-General because he is a<br />
man with the title of Judge in a Federal jurisdiction.<br />
Question: Is a Judge not entitled to make any comment<br />
at all on proposed legislation?<br />
Mr Street: I would think it is unusual.<br />
Question: Why do you think he sent you a copy deliberately?<br />
Mr Street: You would have to ask him. ,/ 2 </p>
<p>Question: Mr Street, has Cabinet considered this issue?<br />
Mr Street: No.<br />
Question: So what is the position as it stands at the moment?<br />
Mr Street: The position as it stands at the moment<br />
is that, as I mentioned, I am astounded at the language<br />
of the document coming from someone with a title of Judge,<br />
that I have given a copy of the document to the Attorney-<br />
General, and that no doubt in due course he will be giving<br />
me his comments.<br />
Question: Mr Street does the Government find'it<br />
embarrassing-at all that a Federal Justice has<br />
described the legislation as comparable with pre-war<br />
Nazi Germany?<br />
Mr Street: I think that is a comment on the author.<br />
Question: Mr Street let's be frank. Mr Justice Staples<br />
has been a bit of a thorn in the side of the Government<br />
for some time now. Are you going to do anything about<br />
this? Would you like to do something about it, or in<br />
fac-t are your hands tied?<br />
Mr Street: No, I have no comment to make on that at all.<br />
As I say I have given the document to the Attorney-General.<br />
There is nothing furthr to be said at the present time.<br />
Question: precondition of future appointments that<br />
might prevent that sort of thing happening. Could you<br />
possibly restrict a Justice's duties, Sir?<br />
Mr Street: I wouldn't comment on that at all.<br />
Question: Sir you haven't said anything about his<br />
criticisms themselves. Do you agree with them? Are<br />
they valid criticisms?<br />
Mr Street: I haven't commented on them, and I won't<br />
comment on them until I have the comments back to me from<br />
the Attorney-General.<br />
Question: But you will pursue the legislation?<br />
Mr. Street: Of course.<br />
Question: Are you convinced at this stage that it would<br />
stand up toa constitutional challenge?<br />
Mr. Street: That is our official advice. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Mr. Justice Staples was appointed to the Arbitration Commission<br />
by the Whitlam Government in 1975. Interview with Mr. Bowen,<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition.<br />
Question : Mr. Bowen, do you agree with the criticisms<br />
which Mr. Justice Staples has made of the proposed<br />
legislation.<br />
Mr. Bowen: Yes we do. The legislation deserves the<br />
greatest criticism. We have been opposing it in the<br />
Parliament and it is on the basis of the law that is, that<br />
what the Government is trying to do it has no constitutional<br />
power so to do and accordingly what Mr. Justice Staples<br />
has also said in writing to his fellow commissioners that<br />
it is virtually beyond the powers of a Government so to act.<br />
Question: Do you think, in your opinion, that he is acting<br />
within hsrights as a Judge of the Commission?<br />
Mr. Bowen: I think so, because judges don't forfeit their<br />
individual views of individual rights. He is entitled to<br />
talk to his fellow commissioners, he is entitled to write<br />
to them. He has a point of view, and as he is a qualified<br />
judicial officer I think it is most valuable to think he<br />
can express a view which I would . hope the Government would<br />
take notice of.<br />
Question: It would appear from what Mr. Street said,<br />
and I quote him, that he says: " I am astounded at the<br />
language of the document coming from someone with the title<br />
of a Judge".<br />
Mr. Bowen: Well, Mr. Street has always been very loyal<br />
to Mr. Fraser. I think it's Mr. Fraser's legislation<br />
that they are trying to . push through the Parliament.<br />
The point we must realise in this country is Mr. Fraser's<br />
law is not always the law of the country, and so whilst<br />
Mr. Street says he is astounded, we are equally astounded,<br />
particularly those who have legal training, to think that<br />
the Government would attempt to dictate to a_-court how<br />
it should act. I think that's got no precedent for that<br />
at all.<br />
Question: Why do you think it had to be up to a judge<br />
of the Commission to make the first moves in severe<br />
criticism of the proposed legislation?<br />
Mr.* Bowen: I would think it is because it is of a technical<br />
nature. You would have, to read the fine print to realise<br />
that what the Government was attempting to do was to tell<br />
a court for the first time what it shall or shall not do<br />
in the course of what is called justice. Now, justice knows<br />
no bounds of a Parliament. It knows the bounds of rights<br />
of people, and in this case I think it is meant that it would<br />
have to require a skilled lawyer to really say what was being<br />
done in the legislation. / 4 </p>
<p>Question: Why do you so strongly support Mr Justice Staples?<br />
What in particular of his criticisms to you strongly agree<br />
with. Mr Bowen: Well, the invalidity of the legislation. It is<br />
not a matter of supporting Mr Justice Staples, that we are<br />
happy to do. But if Mr Justice Staples had remained<br />
silent we still would have been opposing this legislation.<br />
In fact we were opposing it quite strenuously in the<br />
Parliament all this week. We have been gagged in the<br />
divisions on the basis that the Government has no power<br />
to do what it is attempting to do. At that stage we<br />
ignorant of Mr Justice Staples letter to his fellow<br />
commissioners. Qu estion: With Mr Justice Staples speaking out, do you<br />
see the future of the Arbitration Commission being in<br />
some kind of jeopardy over a rather crucial situation?<br />
Mr Bowen: think it will strengthen it because the<br />
problem we have in Democracy, unless people speak out, state<br />
what is happening, you can get a weak democracy. Where<br />
you get people who are able to stand up and express their<br />
views as individuals but nevertheless ones which should<br />
be taken notice of you get a much stronger democracy.<br />
I think full marks to Mr Justice Staples for doing what<br />
he has done, because by so doing this legislation ought<br />
to be withdrawn.<br />
Question: You don't see this speaking out as setting a<br />
precedent which may have perhaps unfortunate results?<br />
Mr Bowen: The way the world is going the more that<br />
people speak up and indicate what should be done, the<br />
better. You don't get democracy by silence Whilst<br />
it can be said that perhaps Judges shouldn't be<br />
speaking out on all issues, that we can understand.<br />
But in issues of legislation what is the difference<br />
between a Judge making a statement on the law asagainst<br />
a Member of Parliament making the same statement.<br />
Interview with Mr David Plowman, lecturer in Industrial Relations<br />
at the University of NSW, who says he agrees with Mr Street<br />
that it is unusual for Judges to make such comments, but his<br />
sympathies are with Mr Justice Staples, because it is the<br />
Arbitration Commission which must suffer the consequences of<br />
any changes in the Conciliation Arbitration Act.<br />
He said the area was a very technical one.<br />
Making the trains run on time has become a major headache for<br />
the Wran Government in NSW. Whilst the new Eastern Suburbs<br />
railway is booming, commuters from Sydney's western suburbs<br />
not only have to put up with slow, old and uncomfortable<br />
transport, but far too often the trains just don't arrive.<br />
According to the State's Public Transport Commission there<br />
aren't enough drivers and too many get sick. </p>
<p>Mr Bjelke *-Petersen indicated today that he might be prepared<br />
to soften his stand on his contribution to the Kainpuchean<br />
appeal. His objection to participation in the appeal and<br />
in other foreign aid appeals has been that he didn't know<br />
where the money was going. Interviewed, he said he was<br />
convinced, and he knew aid was going on the black market<br />
in Kampuchea. He said it was a matter of doing the right<br />
thing by the people concerned, and Mr Peacock should take<br />
a plane right to the people and give them the aid, rather<br />
than just send it by sea so that they never get it. The<br />
people for whom the aid was meant never received it.<br />
A group of Adelaide Catholic priests have offered to provide<br />
accommodation for 80 Kampuchean refugees, but-the Federal<br />
Government has turned them down because the number would put<br />
the intake of Indochinese refugees over the quota. The superior<br />
of the group has strongly criticised the Government's stand,<br />
and said he was bitterly disappointed.<br />
The Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Mr Staley,<br />
flew into Perth today, reluctant to speak about a report<br />
that Cabinet will discuss a submission by him on Monday<br />
that will exclude Telecom from operating a new domestic<br />
satellite communications system for.. Australia. The Minister<br />
took pains to emphasise that there were inaccuracies in the<br />
report, but would not say what they were. Interview with<br />
Mr Staley, who said he would not comment on the precise<br />
timings of things before Cabinet, or on any of the specifics.<br />
He said he expects to be able to make a statement to Parliament<br />
within the next few weeks. 000---</p>
