SPEECH NOTES PRIME MINISTER<br />
FEDERATED IRONWORKERS' ASSOCIATION ( FIA)<br />
ANNUAL NATIONAL CONFERENCE 30 MAY 1983<br />
DELIGHTED TO ADDRESS NATIONAL CONFERENCE, LAST<br />
ADDRESSED FTA ON 15 FEBRUARY AND SPOKE OF THREAT<br />
TO VIABILITY OF STEEL INDUSTRY$<br />
WILL REPORT NOW ON LABOR PARTY PROGRESS TO DATE.<br />
BUT FIRST SOME PRELIMINARY COMMENTS ON ANOTHER ISSUE<br />
OF CONCERN TO TH-E TRADE UNION MOVEMENT TAXATION<br />
OF LUMP SUM SUPERANNUATION. LATER, I WILL OUTLINE<br />
PROGRESS IN MORE GENERAL TERMS.<br />
LUMP SUM SUPERANNUATION<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IN THIS AREA -AS PART OF ITS<br />
CONCERN TO SEE THAT THE BURDEN OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY<br />
PROGRAM ALSON AUSTRALIANS IN A RELATIVELY GOOD<br />
POSITION TO BEAR IT.<br />
a ORIGINALLY SUPERANNUATION TAX CONCESSIONS DESIGNED<br />
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PROVIDE FOR OWN RETIREMENT AND<br />
REDUCE DEMAND ON GOVERNMENT PENSIONS SYSTEM, THE TAX<br />
CONCESSIONS ON EMPLOYEES' AND EMPLOYERS' CONTRIBUTIONS<br />
COST AaOUT $ 2 BILLION PER ANNUM. ALL AUSTRALIAN WORKERS<br />
AND TAXPAYERS PAY FOR THIS, BUT THE BENEFITS GO TO,<br />
ONLY 140 PER CENT OF EMPLOYEES, AND MOST OF THE BENEFITS<br />
GO TO A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION OF PEOPLE ON HIGH<br />
I NCOMES. </p>
<p>ALTHOUGH ENORMOUSLY COSTLY, THE SUPERANNUATION<br />
CONCESSIONS WERE NOT ACHIEVING THEIR PURPOSE.<br />
THEY ENCOURAGED EMPLOYEES TO TAKE BENEFITS AS LUMP<br />
SUMS, WHICH WERE OFTEN THEN INVESTED IN WAYS THAT<br />
ALLOWED PENSION TO B3E TAKEN AS WELL.<br />
UNDER NEW ARRANGEMENTS, LUMP SUMS ACCUMULATED BEFORE<br />
MAY 19 WILL NOT BE TAXED. FOLLOWING CONSULTATIONS WITH<br />
ACTU, CABINET WILL CONSIDER TODAY A METHOD OF CALCULATING<br />
THE PROPORTION OF THE LUMP SUM THAT IS FREE OF TAX<br />
THAT IS HIGHLY FAVOURABLE TO SUPERANNUANTSi THAT IS,<br />
ON THE PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL YEARS OF SERVICE<br />
REPRESENTED BY SERVICE BEFORE MAY 19 1983.<br />
ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES WOULD<br />
NEED TO BE SETTLED FOLLOWING CONSULTATIONS WITH UNIONS<br />
AND LIFE OFFICES. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE PORTABILITY,<br />
AND THE PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEES'I CONTRIBUTIONS THAT<br />
SHOULD BE EXEMPTED.<br />
PART OF THE NEW PACKAGE INCLUDES THE TAXATION OF LUMP<br />
SUMS ACCUMULATED BY SERVICE AFTER MAY 19 UNDER THE OLD<br />
ARRANGEMENTS IF LUMP SUM IS USED TO PURCHASE CONTINUING<br />
ANNUITY OR PENSION. LAWS WILL BE CHANGED TO MAKE SUCH<br />
ANNUITIES MORE ATTRACTIVE. THEY WILL ASSIST PREPARATION<br />
FOR RETIREMENT BY SOME RECIPIENTS OF LUMP SUMS. </p>
<p>3,<br />
OVERALL, THE MEASURE MODIFIES A BENEFIT THAT WAS NOT<br />
BEING USED AS IT WAS INTENDED, AND WHICH WAS AVAILABLE<br />
ONLY TO 40 PER CENT OF RELATIVELY-WELL-OFF AUSTRALIANS,<br />
WITH THE LARGEST BENEFITS GOING TO A FEW PER CENT OF<br />
THE MOST WELL OFF,<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY<br />
BASIS OF GOVERNMENT S APPROACH ABSOLUTE URGENCY<br />
OF ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE VERY VIABILITY OF INDUSTRY<br />
AT STAKES<br />
PROBLEMS FACING INDUSTRY ARE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED<br />
UNFORTUNATELY NO EASY OR COSTLESS SOLUTIONS.<br />
PROBLEM IS NOT JUST INCREASED STEEL IMPORTS, RATHER<br />
OVERSEAS PRESSURES HAVE AGGRAVATED OTHER PRESSURES,<br />
INCLUDING FROWTHE DOWNTURN IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY,<br />
OVERSEAS PRESSURES DERIVE FROM A COMBINATION OF THE<br />
EMERGENCE OF SIGNIFICANT EXCESS CAPACITY IN WORLD<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY SINCE MID 1970' s WHICH IS LIKELY<br />
TO PERSIST FOR SOME TIME AND THE CURRENT WORLD<br />
RECESSION,<br />
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS, LIVELIHOOD OF THOUSANDS<br />
OF MEN AND WOMEN WORKING IN STEEL INDUSTRY AT RISK<br />
UNLESS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS IN PLACE A WORKABLE<br />
ASSISTANCE PACKAGE, </p>
<p>WHEN I ADDRESSED YOU ON F-EBRUARY 15 GAVE THE FOLLOWING<br />
COMMITMENTS ON BEHALF OF A FUTURE LABOR GOVERNMENT:<br />
FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT MAINTENANqCE OF STEEL<br />
INDUSTRY<br />
SET OURSELVES THE OBJECTIVE OF MAINTAINING<br />
JOBS OF THOSE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED<br />
ATTEMPT TO ACCELERATED FINALISATION OF IAC<br />
REPORT PREPARATION OF A 10 YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN WITHIN<br />
THE FIRST 100 DAYS.<br />
WILL NOW REPORT ON THE PROGRESS ON THESE COMMITMENTS.<br />
BUT FIRST A BASIC POINT ABOUT JOBS. IAM SATISFIED<br />
ON THE BASIS OF DISCUSSIONS AND PROGRESS TO DATE<br />
THAT THE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE PUT IN PLACE WILL BE<br />
ONE THAT GI-VES THE BEST PROSPECT OF A SECURE<br />
EMPLOYMENT FUTURE IN fHE INDUSTRY,<br />
THIS WILL BE AT CONSIDERABLE COST TO THE REST OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, BUT I FEEL ENTITLED TO ASK OTHER<br />
AUSTRALIANS TO MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE OF THE<br />
EXTREME ECONOMIC RECESSION IN THE STEEL-PRODUCING<br />
AREAS. BUT IN RETURN, THE OTHER AUSTRALIANS, WHO<br />
WILL BE PAYING FOR THIS ASSISTANCE, ARE ENTITLED TO<br />
ASK FOR A FULL-SCALE EFFORT TO RAISE WORK EFFORTj<br />
IMPROVE WORK PRACTICES AND RAISE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY. </p>
<p>WE HAVE NOW REACHED THE FINAL LEG OF THAT PROCESS,<br />
AND EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE NEW ARRANGEMENTS<br />
BY THE END OF JUNE, WHICH WILL BE PRETTY CLOSE TO<br />
THE 100 DAYS. MY MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE<br />
ASKED FOR THIS SLIGHT EXTENSION OF TIME, AND I THOUGHT<br />
IT BETTER TO GET IT RIGHT IN 110 DAYS THAN TO GET IT<br />
WRONG IN 100 DAYS.<br />
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ANYTHING WE DO<br />
WILL BE DIRECTED AT ASSISTANCE TO STEEL-MAKING JOBS,<br />
AND NOT AT ASSISTING STEEL-MAKING COMPANIES AS SUCH.<br />
ANY COMMITMENT THAT WE MAKE TO STEEL-MAKING COMPANIES<br />
WILL BE DESIGNED TO PROTECT JOBS.<br />
WILL BRIEFLY REVIEW DEVELOPMENTS SINCE COMING TO OFFICE.<br />
AS YOU KNOW, SOON AFTER ELECTION MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY<br />
AND COMMERCE INITIATED DISCUSSIONS WITH BHP AND WITH<br />
FIA AND OTHER UNIONS INVOLVED.<br />
HE ALSO WROTE TO CHAIRMAN OF IAC EMPHASISING THE NEED<br />
TO EXPEDITE COMPLETION OF ITS FINAL REPORT.<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY ADVISORY COUNCIL ( WHICH INCLUDES<br />
MANUFACTURERS, UNIONS, USERS, IMPORTERS AND<br />
PARLIAMENTARIANS) IS ENGAGED IN STUDIES ON THE<br />
LONG-TERM FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY ( INCLUDING FUTURE<br />
DEMAND, DESIRABLE WORKFORCE LEVELS, AREAS FOR<br />
IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS AND ASSISTANCE OPTIONS).<br />
-I 4-I I p-st </p>
<p>TRIPARTITE COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY A REPRESENTATIVE<br />
FROM THE DEPARTM,' ENT OF EmPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS, HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE HOW<br />
RETRENCHMENTS MIGHT BE AVOIDED AND A VOLUNTARY<br />
RETIREMENT SCHEME PUT IN PLACE AS AN ALTERNATIVE.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD ITS DEPARTMENTAL ADVISERS<br />
EXHAUSTIVELY EXAMINE ISSUES RAISED BY THE LAC DRAFT<br />
REPORT WITH A VIEW TO FURNISHING ADVICE TO<br />
MINISTERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER LAC FINAL REPORT<br />
IS COMPLETED,<br />
CAN FURTHER REPORT THAT LAST WEEK THE GOVERNMENT<br />
RECEIVED LAC's FINAL REPORT, NOT AT LIBERTY TO REVEAL<br />
RECOMMENDATIONS IN FINAL REPORT, BUT CAN SAY ARE<br />
HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BE BOUND<br />
BY RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT WILL TREAT THE REPORT SIMPLY<br />
AS ONE SOURCE OF ADV/ ICE TO BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH<br />
OTHER ADVICE,<br />
CABINET CONSIDERS A SUB3MISSION BY MINISTER FOR<br />
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE ON STEEL INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE<br />
EARLY THIS WEEK,<br />
REPEAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL BRING TO ITS DELIBERATIONS<br />
THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF FORMULATING AN ASSISTANCE<br />
PROGRAM WHICH OFFERS THE BEST P-ROSPECTS* FOR SECURING<br />
JOBS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY, </p>
<p>IN THE CONTEXT CAN SAY THAT ON PRESENT PLANNING<br />
SHOULD BE ABLE TO FINALISE LONG-TERM STEEL INDUSTRY<br />
DEVELOPMENT PLAN BY THE END OF THE NEXT MONTH. THIS<br />
PLAN IS, OF COURSE, A KEY ELEMENT IN OUR EFFORTS TO<br />
SECURE JOB LEVELS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY.<br />
ENVISAGE THAT THE PLAN WILL INCORPORATE UNDERTAKINGS<br />
FROM BOTH BHP AND THE GOVERNMENT REGARDING PRODUCTIVITY,<br />
TECHNOLOGY, PRICING AND SECURITY OF TENURE FOR<br />
WORKERS AND INVOLVE A TIME FRAME AND DEGREE OF<br />
FLEXIBILITY APPROPRIATE TO CHANGES IN INDUSTRY<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FINAL ASSISTANCE PACKAGE THAT IS AGREED TO<br />
WILL, OF COURSE, NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR REGARD<br />
TO THE DIRECT EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS IN STEEL PRODUCING<br />
REGIONS BUT WILL ALSO NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE<br />
COSTS TO THE COMMUNITY OF A BASIC RAW MATERIAL FOR<br />
USER INDUSTRIES AND THE EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONS FOR<br />
THOSE INDUSTRIES.<br />
FUNDAMENTAL POINT JOBS SLIDE IN STEEL INDUSTRY<br />
HAS BEEN UNMITIGATED DISASTER. REPEAT ASSISTANCE<br />
PACKAGE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE WILL BE ONE THAT GIVES<br />
BEST PROSPECT OF SECURING EMPLOYMENT FOR STEEL<br />
WORKERS. </p>
<p>JOB CREATION POSSIBLE FURTHER C h' 1ENTS I APPROPRIATE<br />
REGARDLESS OF THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO<br />
THE INDUSTRY. THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN STEEL<br />
, PRODUCING REGIONS W'ILL STILL. REMAIN DEPRESSED,<br />
WE CAME TO OFFICE WITH A PLEDGE TO PURSUE EXPANSIONARY<br />
POLICIES WHICH EMPHASrSE JOBS.<br />
OUR BASIC STRATEGY IS TO LAY THE BASIS FOR A DURABLE<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. IT IS ONLY THROUGH SUSTAINED<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT WE CAN CREATE THE LARGE NUMBER<br />
OF JOBS REQUIRED TO MAKE REAL INROADS INTO THE MASSIVE<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE INHERITED,<br />
BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE WE ATTACH TO THE IMMEDIATE<br />
CREATION OF ADDITIONAL JOBS, WE HAVE ALREADY MOVED<br />
IN FULFILMENT OF OUR ELECTION COMMITMENT TO INTRODUCE<br />
A MAJOR NEW JOB CREATION PROGRAMi THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT<br />
PROGRAM. AS ANNOUNCED ON 19 MAY, $ 300MILLION WILL BE MADE<br />
AVAILABLE FOR PROJECTS UNDER THE PROGRAM IN 1983/ 84,<br />
OUR AIM IS TO REACH A LEVEL OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE<br />
PROGRAM WHERE WE WILL BE PROVIDING, IN A FULL YEAR, UP<br />
TO 70,000 FULL TIME JOBS FOR AN AVERAGE DURATION OF SIX<br />
MONTHS, MANY MORE JOBS WILL BE CREATED INDIRECTLY BY<br />
THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR GOODS AND SERVICES AND HIGHER<br />
INCOMES WHICH WILL RESULT. </p>
<p>THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED PARTICULARLY TO BENEFIT<br />
THE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED, ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST<br />
DISADVANTAGED IN THE LABOUR MARKET WHO WOULD BE<br />
LEAST LIKELY TO BE ASSISTED BY GENERAL EMPLOYMENT<br />
GROWTH AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY PICKS UP,<br />
THE MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,<br />
MR WILLIS, IS TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT, WITHIN THE<br />
COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM, SPECIAL PRIORITY IS<br />
GIVEN TO REGIONS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT SUCH AS NEWCASTLE,<br />
WOLLONGONG AND WHYALLA.<br />
IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING<br />
PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED ON 19 MAY, WE WERE FORCED TO MAKE<br />
SOME SIGNIFICANT OFF-SETTING CUTS IN SOME OF THE PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMS. NOT TO HAVE DONE THIS WOULD HAVE<br />
PLACED INTOLERABLE BURDENS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S MONETARY<br />
POLICY AND PUT SERIOUS PRESSURE ON INTEREST RATES, THE<br />
EFFECT THIS WOULD HAVE HAD ON PRIVATE SECTOR SPENDING<br />
WOULD HAVE UNDONE ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE REFLATIONARY<br />
ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES.<br />
IN MAKING CUTBACKS WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED TO ENSURE<br />
THAT THEY AFFECT THOSE MOST ABLE TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN, </p>
<p>THOSE OF US WITH JOBS MIUST EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN OUR<br />
INCOME CLAIMS, JOB CREATICN AND INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE<br />
PROGRAMS WILL sTMPLY BE UJSF'-r'SS IF LABOUR COSTS ARE<br />
ALLOWED TO GET OUT OF CONTROL,<br />
WAGE RESTRAINT IS ESSENTIAL 1F WE ARE TO MAINTAIN A<br />
VIABLE INDUSTRIAL BASE AND CREATE MORE JOBS, BUT THE<br />
GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT WAGE RESTRAINT BY ITSELF<br />
WOULD BE GROSSLY INEQUITABLE,<br />
THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD IS NOT JUST ABOUT WAGE<br />
RESTRAINT, IT DEALS WITH A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHER<br />
MEASURES NECESSARY TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIA'I S SOCIAL AND<br />
ECONOMIC WELL-BEING, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY TAKEN<br />
ACTION IN MANY OF THESE AREAS:<br />
WE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH AN<br />
ECONOMIC PLANN. ING ADVISORY COUNCIL;<br />
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A PRICES<br />
SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITY;<br />
WE ARE TAKING ACTION TO RESTRAIN NON-WAGE INCOMES,<br />
SUCH AS PROFEGSONAL FEES, DIVIDENDS AND DIRECTORS'<br />
REMUNERATI ON;<br />
WE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION AS PART OF OUR<br />
POLICY TO SMASH THE TAX AV'OIDANCE INDUSTRY; </p>
<p>WE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO FACILITATE THE<br />
AMALGAMATION OF UNIONS AND TO ABOLISH THE<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BUREAU;<br />
WE HAVE REDUCED THE CEILING FOR MIGRATION FOR<br />
1983-84 TO BETWEEN 80,000 AND 90,000, WITHIN<br />
THIS GLOBAL FIGURE THERE WILL BE A SHIFT IN<br />
EMPHASIS TOWARDS THE REUNION OF CLOSE FAMILY<br />
MEMBERS OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS AND TO REFUGEES,<br />
AND AWAY FROM THE RECRUITMENT OF SKILLED WORKERS<br />
OVERSEAS; THIS GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITY AND<br />
THE INTERESTS OF ORDINARY AUSTRALIANS, BUT WE<br />
CAN ONLY SUCCEED IN OUR OBJECTIVES IF WE HAVE<br />
THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AND, IN<br />
PARTICULAR, THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT. </p>
