Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced construction will commence over the next twelve months to connect almost half a million new premises to Australia's world class National Broadband Network, providing massive economic and social benefits.</p>
<p>In the biggest rollout of the NBN so far, the fibre network will be delivered to 49 sites around Australia in the next 12 months. This includes 28 new locations.</p>
<p>This rollout builds on the 81,700 premises that are either already connected to the NBN or where connection work is currently underway.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made the milestone announcement in the Illawarra today which will see the NBN rolled out in Dapto and Wollongong over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>This is an important day. Over the next year, NBN Co will have commenced construction of a high-speed fibre broadband network to a further 485,100 homes across Australia.</p>
<p>All Australians deserve the benefits that will be delivered by our world class NBN.</p>
<p>It will enhance every aspect of our lives  -  the way we care for our families and ourselves, the way we share knowledge and information and the way we trade our goods and services.</p>
<p>This announcement puts them on the path to receiving the essential infrastructure that will bridge the digital divide, provide better educational outcomes, improve health service delivery and increase economic opportunities.</p>
<p>The NBN will be a massive boost for the Australian economy, opening up previously inaccessible national and global markets.</p>
<p>A recent Access Economics report found that the internet contributes $50 billion to the Australian economy and that over the next five years that figure will increase to $70 billion.</p>
<p>Importantly, the NBN will allow local communities to thrive as businesses grow without the need to move to major metropolitan cities.</p>
<p>This will mean jobs growth in regional Australia and mean more people will be able to be employed locally.</p>
<p>The release of the 12-month schedule marks the end of the preliminary systems trial phase at the five first releases sites and the beginning of the volume NBN rollout to Australian premises.</p>
<p>NBN Co's 12-month construction program will be updated quarterly, which means in three months, a new rolling 12-month schedule with additional locations will be released.</p>
<p>The first annual indicative three-year schedule will be released early next year.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government is committed to transforming Australia into a leading broadband nation.</p>
<p>The release of the 12 month construction timetable proves this is a reality and well underway.</p>
<p>NBN Co expects it will take an average of 12 months from the beginning of construction in each location for the owners of premises to receive high speed broadband and telephone services.</p>
<p>Detailed mapping information is expected to be made available once network design documents for each area are finalised. </p>
