LABOR'S EXPORT PLAN FOR THE 1990S 28 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
Labor will broaden and strengthen Australia's export drive.<br />
The Government's integrated export strategy is important in<br />
reducing Australia's external deficit. The target is clear:<br />
increased exports and reduced imports. Both, increasingly,<br />
will be achieved. I<br />
The particular measures that I am announcing today with<br />
Senator Button strengthen our overall export strategy.<br />
Labor will establish a new support scheme for exporters<br />
which will see $ 55 million over three years devoted to<br />
encouraging exporters to enter new markets and launch new<br />
products. The new scheme, the International Trade Enhancement Scheme,<br />
will be implemented from July 1990 and be funded at<br />
million in the first year and $ 20 million in the second and<br />
third years. It will support established exporters entering<br />
new markets and launching new products; encourage<br />
collaboration and the development of critical mass by<br />
smaller companies with export potential; and support the<br />
efforts of industry associations and groups to promote<br />
exports. Over the next three years, the money to be allocated by a<br />
private sector Board should support significant new export<br />
development efforts by two hundred or more Australian firms<br />
with the greatest potential to increase exports.<br />
In addition, the-Export Market Development Grant ( EMDG)<br />
Scheme will be extended to cover inbound tourist operators,<br />
at a cost of $ 5 million per annum from 1991-92, and health<br />
and legal services, and intellectual property rights.<br />
The International Trade Enhancement Scheme replaces the<br />
current International Business Development and Innovative<br />
Agricultural Marketing Schemes, which had funding of<br />
million in 1990-91 and $ 8 million in outyears. Thus<br />
total new funding announced today is $ 44 million over three<br />
years as shown in the attached scoresheet.<br />
r 1 </p>
<p>The Statement I am releasing today describes existing and<br />
future export policies in more detail. It highlights<br />
Labor's future commitment to, and broad strategies for,<br />
increasing Australia's exports.<br />
Under Labor, Australia's export performance has been greatly<br />
improved. Total exports have increased on average by 8 percent per<br />
annum since 1983; manufactured exports and services exports<br />
have both increased by over 50 percent, in real terms, since<br />
1984-85.<br />
Consequently the share of manufactures and services in total<br />
exports has increased from 11 percent and 16 percent in<br />
1984-85 to 14 percent and 19 percent, respectively, in<br />
1988-89.<br />
We are now exporting energy control equipment to Thailand,<br />
fishing vessels to Asia and the Middle East, automotive<br />
components to Japan and the United States, optical lenses<br />
throughout the world and pharmaceuticals to Europe.<br />
It is acknowledged that imports have also risen<br />
significantly in recent years. They are declining now,<br />
however, and policy will aim to ensure that the unwinding of<br />
the previous high growth continues. There can, however, be<br />
continued export growth.<br />
Indeed, while past performance has been extremely good,<br />
Australia's export potential is even more exciting.<br />
We have the $ 49 billion worth of foreign exchange earning or<br />
saving projects identified by Access Economics which are<br />
either committed or under construction. Access Economics<br />
identified $ 5 bil'lion extra exports in the pipeline, equal<br />
to around 30 percent of our current account deficit forecast<br />
for 1989-90 of $ 18.5 billion.<br />
Ross Garnaut's report on " Australia and the North East Asian<br />
Ascendency" identifies a potential for around $ 20 billion<br />
worth of exports of processed raw materials, tourism and<br />
education services to North East Asia alone.<br />
Australia will, under Labor, also move increasingly into the<br />
export of Australian ideas and skills through increased<br />
export of telecommunications, education, legal and health<br />
services. Not only is the potential there, but Australia's productive<br />
capacity is increasing to meet it. Rpnnrd investment and<br />
labour force participation levels combined with rpnnrd<br />
training and education mean that Australia under Labor faces<br />
the 1990s as a much more productive country than it was in<br />
the 1980s.<br />
More workers will have more machines to work with, and they<br />
will be better trained and educated. 155-95 </p>

microeconomic reform; clear environmental guidelines; and<br />
innovative international trade diplomacy. 5597 </p>
<p>LABOR'S EXPORT PLAN FOR THE 1990S 2 ERAY19<br />
While Australia has traditionally relied on exports of<br />
commodities, and while these will continue to be important,<br />
increasingly we are broadening and strengthening our export<br />
base. Tourism and exports of services generally have expanded. We<br />
are now exporting energy control equipment to Thailand,<br />
fishing vessels to Asia and the Middle East, automotive<br />
components to Japan and the United States, optical lenses<br />
throughout the world and pharmaceuticals to Europe.<br />
While manufactured and services exports, respectively,<br />
represented 11 percent and 16 percent of total real exports<br />
in 1984-85, in 1988-89 they represented 14 percent and<br />
19 percent.<br />
Since 1984-85 both manufactured and services exports have<br />
increased by over 50 percent in real terms.<br />
Total real exports have grown on average at 8 percent per<br />
annum since 1983. While imports have also risen<br />
significantly, they are declining now and policy will aim to<br />
ensure that the unwinding of the previous high growth<br />
continues. Export growth, however, should continue: indeed,<br />
Government policy will be strongly geared to support such<br />
growth. Australians are increasingly developing an export culture.<br />
This trend will be enhanced under Labor.<br />
My Government's Current Policy Approach<br />
Fundamentally, our export performance depends on the<br />
business sector's ability both to sustain existing markets<br />
and develop new international markets. my whole economic<br />
policy focus has been to internationalise the Australian<br />
economy. The role of government in boosting exports is<br />
significant, as my Government's efforts over the past 7<br />
years illustrate.<br />
First, macroeconomic policy must provide a conducive<br />
setting. By achieving a 12 percent decline in real unit labour costs,<br />
my Government has lifted the corporate profit share from an<br />
average 12.6 percent from 1973-74 to 1982-83, to 16.5<br />
percent in 1988-89.<br />
This has given Australia record job growth and record levels<br />
of business investment. More Australians than ever before<br />
are in the workforce: the participation rate is a record<br />
63.8 percent. Following fifteen years of poor investment<br />
performance ( 2.2 percent per annum growth) the average<br />
increase in business fixed investment in the last five years<br />
has been a remarkable 10.8 percent.<br />
Ui 28 FEBRUARY 1990 </p>
<p>Under Labor, Australia's productive capacity has never been<br />
greater. Second, microeconomic reform is essential. Thirty years of<br />
excessive regulation under the conservatives must be<br />
removed. Because such regulation entrenches attitudes and<br />
supporting behaviour, it will take Labor some time to unwind<br />
it. But under Labor Australians can be sure the job will be<br />
done. The Conservatives have refused to take up my ch'allenge to<br />
show any other period in Australia's history when so much<br />
micro reform has been achieved. Their continued silence<br />
confirms my government's record.<br />
We have cut marginal and corporate tax rates; deregulated<br />
the financial sector, aviation and oil marketing; exposed<br />
increasing areas of telecommunications to competition;<br />
significantly lowered tariffs; cut excessive coastal<br />
shipping and waterfront manning levels: a list of reforms<br />
was released by me last week.<br />
Significantly, we have also increased school retention rates<br />
from 36 percent in 1982 to over 60 percent now; increased<br />
higher education places by 36 percent; made training more<br />
attractive through award restructuring; restructured<br />
apprenticeship training and increased apprenticeship<br />
commencements by two-thirds; and recently declared that we<br />
would introduce a training levy to ensure increased private<br />
sector training.<br />
Last week Paul Keating announced we would seek to retrain<br />
the unemployed rather than push them through a social trap<br />
door. Under Labor we have more Australian workers. They have more<br />
capital equipment, and are better educated and trained.<br />
What better base for future productivity?<br />
Third, under Labor Australia has been at the forefront of<br />
international trade negotiations, particularly through the<br />
Cairns Group created by the Hawke Government.<br />
Our exporters need a favourable international trading<br />
environment. Labor's role extends beyond these areas, however, to an<br />
active industry and export policy. 5 99 </p>
<p>Industry and Export Policy<br />
Since 1983 industry and export policy has focused on<br />
building competitive strength in existing manufacturing<br />
activities; encouraging new technology-based industries of<br />
world standard; increasing the export capability of<br />
industry; working in partnership with companies to extend<br />
trade and investment links in particular world markets;<br />
attracting new investment from overseas sources to<br />
export-based activities; and promoting an export culture<br />
across the country in business, the workforce and young<br />
people. Industry has been set on its most far reaching restructuring<br />
program ever.<br />
Industry wide policy measures have been introduced such as<br />
the research and development tax incentive and Grants for<br />
Industry Research and Development ( GIRD) Scheme; the<br />
National Industry Extension Service's ( NIES's) quality,<br />
management, design and marketing assistance; and measures to<br />
increase the availability of development and venture capital<br />
to industry ( MIC and AIDC).<br />
1988-89 saw the third full year of operations of the<br />
Australia Trade Commission, AUSTRADE, an organisation<br />
established by the Government in 1986 to consolidate export<br />
promotion services into one effective operation. AUSTRADE<br />
is now a commercially driven statutory body led by a Board<br />
comprised mainly of private sector members.<br />
AUSTRADE provides a comprehensive range of international<br />
business consultancy services through a network of 69<br />
offices in 56 countries and a national network;<br />
in Japan, Australia's largest export market, ( exports<br />
to Japan now amount to over $ 11 billion), AUSTRADE has<br />
launched a major export effort in processed foods,<br />
scientific and medical equipment, computer software,<br />
automotive components and pleasure boats;<br />
in the Republic of Korea, ( Australian exports now $ 2.2<br />
billion a rise of 22 percent on 1987-88), AUSTRADE is<br />
focusing on promoting Australian investment<br />
opportunities, joint ventures, industrial collaboration<br />
and export;<br />
in Europe, AUSTRADE is developing strategies to respond<br />
to the rapid economic and political change in Western<br />
and Eastern Europe;<br />
in North America, Australia's second largest export<br />
market for-elaborately transformed manufacture $ 670<br />
million in 1988-89 AUSTRADE is implementing<br />
industry-specific export strategies, including in<br />
industrial, technical and consumer products;<br />
0 0U( </p>
<p>in South East Asia, AUSTRADE is promoting sales of<br />
education services, mining and power systems,<br />
pharmaceuticals, communications, railways -and<br />
agricultural systems.<br />
AUSTRADE-EFIC provides insurance, guarantee and finance<br />
facilities on a commercial basis to support exporters. EFIC<br />
supported exports and investment insurance of more than S5.6<br />
billion in 1988-89, including 12 percent of Australia's<br />
total merchandise exports.<br />
The Export Market Development Grant ( EMDG) scheme supported<br />
over 3500 Australian exporters in the last year alone.<br />
Their contribution to Australia's exports was in excess of<br />
billion.<br />
AUSTRADE is active in assisting Australian companies into<br />
new markets, particularly in Asia, eg. AUSTRADE helped White<br />
Industries to win a $ 500 million coal mining project in<br />
India.<br />
AUSTRADE's international project division also collaborates<br />
with a growing client base in the private sector to provide<br />
international project intelligence and to assist successful<br />
packaging of competitive Australian consortia bids in<br />
offshore projects. AUSTRADE itself is the prime contractor<br />
in eight overseas projects valued at $ 38 million, mainly on<br />
behalf of smaller high technology Australian companies.<br />
AUSTRADE's relationship with business has led to the<br />
formation of a number of AUSTRADE supported private sector<br />
bodies which market Australian technology, goods and<br />
services overseas. These include railway equipment<br />
services, mining systems, agricultural technology, power<br />
generation, education services, and scientific and medical<br />
equipment. A series of industrj based export strategies have been<br />
developed in close collaboration with the private sector.<br />
Thirteen strategies are in place, and an additional eleven<br />
are being developed. Those in train include computer<br />
software, aerospace, education and training, health<br />
services, processed foods; while newly launched strategies<br />
include textiles, information and communication services,<br />
computer hardware.<br />
The AUSTRADE/ DITAC investment promotion program is aiming to<br />
attract overseas investment to increase industrial capacity,<br />
enhance the flow of technology and business skills, and<br />
widen access to foreign markets. In its first year,<br />
1988-89, the program yielded 200 inquiries, and it is hoped<br />
that a significant number will lead to new investment in<br />
Australian export-based activity. 56P) 01. </p>
<p>The Government's DIFF program applies aid funds to assisting<br />
companies to finance large export projects in the region.<br />
Over the past few years, with DIFF support, BHP has designed<br />
and built a $ 50 million cement plant at Shunchang in China;<br />
VTTC supplied over $ 40 million of Australian scientific<br />
equipment to Indonesian universities; and TRANSFIELD is<br />
building steel bridges in Indonesia, involving the supply of<br />
steel and engineering services valued at over $ 300 million.<br />
Industry plans in steel, passenger motor vehicles, heavy<br />
engineering, shipbuilding and textile, clothing and footwear<br />
have exposed our mature, previously highly protected<br />
industries to world competition. This has occurred within a<br />
planned structure which commits employers to substantial new<br />
investment and advanced technologies, and the workforce to<br />
more productive work practices.<br />
Commodity export volumes have increased b~ y over 23 percent<br />
over the past five years. These exports remain vital to our<br />
economy. The Government has reformed the Commonwealth's<br />
Primary Industry Statutory Marketing Authorities to make<br />
them more commercial, flexible and responsive to market<br />
conditions. AUSTRADE has also implemented special marketing<br />
programs, such as the Innovative Agricultural Marketing<br />
Program, to improve marketing performance.<br />
Research arrangements have been reformed and research<br />
funding increased, through Rural Industry Research Funds,<br />
Research and Development Corporations, and the National<br />
Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program<br />
( NERDDP).<br />
We continue to provide price support measures, albeit at<br />
lower levels in some cases, for the wool industry ( through<br />
the reserve price scheme), the wheat, dairy, apples and<br />
pears and dried vine fruits industries ( through<br />
underwriting), and the citrus, wine, and sugar industries<br />
( through tariffs).<br />
Our commodity-specific initiatives include the progressive<br />
commercialisation of the domestic wheat market, more<br />
market-oriented dairy arrangements, the creation of the<br />
Australian Horticu. ltural Corporation and the implementation<br />
of effective fisheries management arrangements.<br />
Tourism has benefited particularly from Government<br />
attention. The Government has increased funding for overseas promotion<br />
through the Australian Tourist Commission by almost 400<br />
percent from $ 10 million in 1982-83 to $ 37 million in<br />
1989-90. We have substantially improved the available<br />
statistical base through the establishment of the Bureau of<br />
Tourism Research -in September 1987.<br />
G 2 </p>
<p>My Government launched the highly successful Paul Hogan<br />
series of television commercials which revolutionised the<br />
promotion of Australia overseas. In co-operation with the<br />
States/ Territories and Industry, we launched a domestic<br />
tourism campaign from 1984-87 to increase awareness of the<br />
importance of tourism and to encourage Australians to<br />
holiday within their own country.<br />
We created the environment for a'dramatic increase in<br />
tourism infrastructure development through an increase in<br />
depreciation rates on buildings for the tourist industry<br />
from 2.5 percent to 4 percent during the period 1984-87, the<br />
easing of FIRE guidelines to allow foreign equity in the<br />
provision of tourism infrastructure, and the organisation of<br />
a tourism investment mission to Japan in November 1987.<br />
We have also provided $ 10 million to the Hunter and<br />
Illawarra regions of New South Wales under the Steel Regions<br />
Assistance Program for the development of tourism<br />
infrastructure projects; restored interlining rights to<br />
Qantas form July 1988; introduced a new approach to<br />
negotiation of air service agreements which ensures all<br />
interests, including tourism interests, are taken into<br />
account; and substantially upgraded infrastructure at major<br />
airports including Sydney, Brisbane and Perth airports.<br />
We introduced an enhanced visa insurance system to reduce<br />
delays and minimise inconvenience to international tourists.<br />
Importantly, we provided over $ 50 million between 1982 and<br />
1988 for capital funding of tourism training facilities in<br />
TAFE Colleges ( 2000 new student places) and $ 70 million per<br />
annum on training placement activities of direct benefit to<br />
the tourism industry through the TAFE system, labour market<br />
programs, CES hospitality placement activity and the skills<br />
training program.<br />
Outcomes The various ' plan' industries have enjoyed spectacular<br />
success. The ' steel plan' has seen an industry that was in crisis<br />
only six years ago become one where BHP is now proudly<br />
proclaiming that their steel output will double by 1992 but<br />
due to the value-added nature of the product, the value in<br />
dollar terms will treble-to more than $ 2 billion.<br />
The shipbuilding industry has revived and is focused on<br />
niche markets overseas. From a zero base in 1984, exports<br />
in train now exceed $ 600 million; over half the industry's<br />
output is destined for world markets. 96 0 3 </p>
<p>In the automotive industry almost $ 3 billion of investment<br />
in new plant and technologies for car manufacture is<br />
underway. Exports of components now exceed $ 500 million and<br />
total automotive exports are forecast to rise to $ 1.2<br />
billion per year by 1992. Following a $ 300 million dollar<br />
investment, Ford Australia will soon be exporting Capri<br />
sports cars to the United States.<br />
In TCF, the signs are promising for the establishment of an<br />
increasing range of export-based ventures in wool, hide and<br />
cotton processing. Five new plants for wool and hides<br />
processing commenced last year. Four of these involve<br />
investment of about $ 90 million and will contribute<br />
significantly to export income.<br />
In the information industries, exports have risen from a<br />
very low base of $ 140 million in 1986-87 to exceed $ 700<br />
million in. 1988-89. The strategy has raised exports by the<br />
19 transnationals which signed Partnerships agreements with<br />
the Government involving commitments to R&amp; D, manufacture and<br />
export from Australia. By 1995, exports are targeted to<br />
rise to $ 1.5 billion, a ten fold increase on the base figure<br />
in 1986-87.<br />
The pharmaceuticals industry strategy, introduced in 1987,<br />
will help to raise Australian exports in real terms from<br />
million in 1987-88 to $ 360 million by 1992-93.<br />
Industry wide policy measures are working to lift<br />
productivity and innovation within Australian enterprises.<br />
Private business enterprise research and development<br />
increased by 89 percent in real terms between 1984-85 and<br />
1987-88. NIES has assisted over 3000 small and medium-sized<br />
firms to improve product quality, design, management skills,<br />
and is preparing Australian firms to enter export markets.<br />
The Bureau of Industry Economics report on Manufacturing<br />
Investment released today provides unambiguous evidence that<br />
the investment surge currently underway is assisting in the<br />
restructuring of.. Australian industry and is leading to a<br />
significant capacity expansion. The capacity expansion will<br />
lead to further rapid growth in manufactured exports in the<br />
1990s.<br />
Access Economics' October 1989 survey of investment projects<br />
( each with a value of more than $ 5 million and with a<br />
potential to earn or save foreign exchange) listed 500<br />
projects worth $ 49 billion under construction or committed.<br />
This survey highlights the sharp contrast of the current<br />
investment surge with the last " investment boom" of the<br />
early 1980s. While the earlier boom was dominated by mining<br />
and minerals processing ( particularly aluminium) the current<br />
surge is spread over a wide range of manufactures and<br />
tourist activities.<br />
) 01 </p>
<p>Access Economics identify 6 major investment projects either<br />
coming on stream or already. under construction which in a<br />
few years are expected to generate close to $ 5 billion per<br />
annum in foreign exchange.<br />
This is equivalent to about 10 percent of the value of goods<br />
and services exports in 1988-89 ( or in terms of our current<br />
account deficit about 30 percent for the same period).<br />
Importantly, the six projects probably have their main<br />
importing stages behind them.<br />
Ross Garnaut's report on " Australia and the Northeast Asian<br />
Ascerdancy" speculates that, due to the neglect over<br />
previous decades, and after allowing for the trade-reducing<br />
effects of geographic isolation, Australia's exports are at<br />
least $ 20 billion less than we should expect.<br />
He then identifies, simply through the North East Asian<br />
market, how the deficiency could be filled: exports of.<br />
semi-processed materials could generate half the<br />
' deficiency', tourism exports one-third, and exports of<br />
education services one-tenth.<br />
Future Labor Export Strategy<br />
Boosting Australia's exports requires an integrated approach<br />
largely directed to general scene-setting, but also<br />
including more specific effort aimed at broad sectors of<br />
great promise ( eg. such as those identified by Garnaut).<br />
The Government's macroeconomic policy will provide known and<br />
affordable wages outcomes, a continued contribution Qf the<br />
public sector to national savings, superannuation policies<br />
to boost private savings, with these public and private<br />
savings allowing further, investment, and therefore lower<br />
weight on monetary policy than would otherwise be the case.<br />
Last week I listed ten priority areas of micro reform to be<br />
pursued throughout my fourth term.<br />
My recent Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation initiative is<br />
one of many we have taken to benefit from our location in<br />
the world's fastest growing region. The Garnaut report<br />
suggested many ways our foreign affairs and international<br />
trade efforts can be directed to co-ordinated pursuit of our<br />
trade objectives.<br />
Because of the significance of our services exports we have<br />
the ambitious objective in the Uruguay Round of the GATT<br />
trade negotiations of securing a new area of agreement for<br />
international trade liberalisation. We know such agreements<br />
are possible because of our rewarding experience under the<br />
Closer Economic Relations Services Protocol with New<br />
Zealand. I-060 </p>
<p>in the Uruguay Round we are seeking a much more liberal<br />
trading environment f or our agricultural producers, an<br />
agreement whose principles will cover all traded services<br />
and strong rules on non-discrimination, national treatment,<br />
and transparency of rules and regulations.<br />
Export Promotion<br />
The EMDG Scheme will remain in place until 1995. Following<br />
the Hughes Report, a number of changes will be made to the<br />
scheme to increase its effectiveness and a new export<br />
development fund will be created to support innovative<br />
export projects.<br />
The new, discretionary scheme for export market development<br />
will be implemented from July 1990 running for four years.<br />
It will be funded at $ 15 million in the f irst year and<br />
million in the second and third years. It will support<br />
established exporters to enter new markets and launch new<br />
products; encourage collaboration and the development of<br />
critical mass by smaller companies with export potential;<br />
and support the efforts of industry associations and groups<br />
to promote exports.<br />
Over the next three years, the S55 million to be allocated<br />
to this scheme by a private sector Board should support<br />
significant new export development efforts by two hundred or<br />
more Australian firms with the greatest potential to<br />
increase exports.<br />
The Exports Market Developments Grants Scheme ( EMDGS) is to<br />
be revised and extended for a further five years, effective<br />
from 1 July 1990. The key changes to the EMDGS are:<br />
the maximum grant will be increased from $ 200,000 to<br />
$ 250,000 and the export ceiling from $ 20 million to<br />
million; the grant rate will be reduced from 70 percent to<br />
percent of eligible expenditure;<br />
the number of incentive payments will be limited to<br />
eight: however, firms that have received eight<br />
incentive payments under the EMDGS will not be excluded<br />
from participating in the new discretionary scheme;<br />
a new category of claimaists Approved Trading Bodies<br />
will be introduced to encourage smaller companies to<br />
collaborate among themselves and with larger companies;<br />
the minimum expenditure threshold is to be increased<br />
from $ 10,000 to $ 30,000, with expenditure after the<br />
first $ 15,000 being eligible for reimbursement under<br />
the Scheme; </p>
<p>the range of eligible services will be expanded to<br />
include health services provided in Australia; film<br />
making, recording and similar services carried out in<br />
Australia on behalf of overseas clients; legal<br />
services; and<br />
the cost of attending education courses in exporting<br />
will be allowed as eligible expenditure.<br />
Industry wide measures will of course continue for the<br />
fourth term. The National Industry Extention Scheme ( NIES)<br />
will be maintained in real terms'through until 1995. Grants<br />
for Industry Research and Development ( GIRD) will remain in<br />
place through to 1995: the discretionary grants scheme<br />
( GIRD) will be expanded to include services and. market<br />
research. Generic technology areas under GIRD in future<br />
will encompass waste management and environmental<br />
management. The research and development tax incentive will operate<br />
through until 1995. The current MIC program will continue<br />
until mid 1991, prior to which a review of the scheme will<br />
decide the future mode of Government assistance to increase<br />
the availability of venture capital. The AIDC will continue<br />
to provide development capital to Australian enterprises<br />
which can profitably compete with imports or deliver<br />
substantial increases in export capability.<br />
Finally, the National Procurement Development Program ( NPDP)<br />
will continue, with an expanded capacity to assist<br />
innovative Australian companies to develop and test<br />
strategic information technology products.<br />
There will also be further expansion of our capabilities in<br />
those strategic technology-based industries, such as the<br />
information, communication, medical and scientific<br />
equipment, and pharmaceuticals industries, where we can<br />
build a significant export base in Australia, especially for<br />
the Asia Pacific region. This will mainly occur through<br />
AUSTRADE marketing strategies and industry development<br />
strategies. Tourism As already stated, tourism promotion has been a major<br />
priority for Labor. On top of previous efforts, last year I<br />
announced new measures to promote tourism. An extra $ 31.25<br />
million in 1989-90 was provided to promote both<br />
international tourism, and to promote Australia as a holiday<br />
venue for Australians.<br />
In response to strong representations from the industry,<br />
inbound tourist operators will in future be eligible for<br />
EMDG grants. 15607 </p>
<p>Other Services<br />
In addition, EMDG will also be extended to cover health and<br />
legal services and intellectual property rights.<br />
AUSTRADE has identified health services as an industry with<br />
potential to be a major foreign exchange earner with<br />
earnings of $ 150 million per annum expected by 1991-92.<br />
The legal services sector had total exports in 1987-88 of<br />
$ 58 million. A recent study jointly commissioned by<br />
AUSTRADE and the Law Council of Australia suggests that the<br />
current figure may be in the order of $ 100 million per<br />
annum. This outlook is hardly surprising given the<br />
international opportunities for our legal services sector<br />
particularly in the Asia Pacific region.<br />
We are actively promoting Australia as an % international<br />
centre for commercial arbitration and dispute settlement<br />
where alternatives are wanted to the normal court processes.<br />
We are also promoting our legal services, by involvement in<br />
international fora such as UNCITRAL. We ensure by this that<br />
Australian professionals and business people have access to<br />
developing international standards and develop the expertise<br />
that can be drawn upon anywhere. We are at the same time<br />
also reducing transaction costs for exporters and importers,<br />
by promoting uniformity in international commercial law.<br />
Telecommunications exports already are significant at $ 400<br />
million ( in 1987-88).<br />
OTC and Telecom are leading the way into substantial markets<br />
offshore. OTC International, Australia's worldwide<br />
communications company, has won major contracts in Vietnam,<br />
Sri Lanka and elsewhere in the region, and is developing a<br />
vast Pacific Area Telecommunications ( PACT) network.<br />
Telecom's international arm has benefited from the<br />
Government's decision to enable Telecom to compete in world<br />
markets and is cr~ ating new export opportunities for Telecom<br />
and importantly, for other Australian high-tech companies.<br />
So far, Telecom has won 150 contracts in 30 countries,<br />
including an $ 86 million contract to manage Saudi Arabia's<br />
telecommunications network.<br />
Total foreign exchange earnings from the education and<br />
training sector are expected to reach $ 400 million in the<br />
1989 academic year an increase of almost 70 percent on the<br />
previous year.<br />
In 1986 the Government responded to growing demand from<br />
overseas students -for Australian education courses by<br />
introducing the full-fee overseas student program. </p>
<p>Revenue earned from fees is retained by institutions to meet<br />
all costs incurred by overseas students, and any surplus is<br />
used to expand facilities which benefit both Australian and<br />
overseas students.<br />
In recognition of the demand for Australian education<br />
services from Asia and the Pacific, the Government is to<br />
establish, under contract, Australian Education Centres in<br />
11 countries in the region.<br />
To ensure that Australia maintains its reptutation for<br />
quality education, a national code of conduct for the<br />
provision of Australian education services has been adopted<br />
by institutions and organisations involved with overseas<br />
students. Of course the Government is aware there are obstacles to<br />
continued growth in these sectors. Late last year my<br />
Government received an IAC Report on International Trade in<br />
Services. We will be responding fully to the detailed<br />
recommendations of this report this year. My Government has<br />
already responded, in part, to the report by sending new<br />
references to the new Industry Commission on export of<br />
education and health services.<br />
Commodities and Raw Material Processing<br />
General macroeconomic and microeconomic as well as trade<br />
policy are most important for promotion of our commodity and<br />
raw material processing exports.*<br />
Garnaut has emphasised particularly improved efficiency in<br />
electricity generation and coastal shipping, and clear<br />
environmental standards as important for improved exports of<br />
processed raw materials. My fourth term micro agenda<br />
highlights the first two items. While an appropriate<br />
balance is not straightforward, I have already stated that<br />
clear environmental gUidelines will be provided across most<br />
sectors over the next year.<br />
My Government has actively pursued strategies in many areas<br />
of processed raw materials, usually tapping expertise from a<br />
wide variety of sources, especially in industry.<br />
For example, reports in four areas of raw material<br />
processing wool processing, skins and hides, fish and<br />
minerals identify areas for action by the industry ( eg. a<br />
co-ordinated marketing effort in the fishing industry) and<br />
for government ( eg. training, transport costs). They have<br />
led to a range of continuing activity, such as AUSTRADE's<br />
Investment Promotion Program for value added in hides,<br />
skins, wool and cotton and information programs to match<br />
Australian firms with interested overseas firms; AIDC's $ 27<br />
million which is available for equity involvement in further<br />
processing of wool, cotton, skins and hides; and the Basic<br />
Metals Industry Council's " Action Plan" aimed at zinc and<br />
titanium oxide. ti </p>
<p>Industry and Government assessments suggest that Australia<br />
could increase value added exports of wool, cotton, skins<br />
and hides from $ 1.7 billion currently ( 1988-89) to<br />
billion by the late 1990s.<br />
Substantial investments to lift capacity and export<br />
capability are underway in wool, hide and food processing,<br />
and rare earths developments are being piloted at several<br />
locations. Our strategy for the fourth term will comprise, first,<br />
development of sector specific marketing plans through<br />
AUSTRADE working in conjunction with industry.<br />
Second, the attraction of domestic and overseas investment<br />
into export-based development by working with companies and<br />
industry organisations.<br />
Third, continuing the agenda set for the Industry Commission<br />
and the Resource Assessment Commission in examining key<br />
factors affecting the business climate for raw material<br />
processing ( eg. a reference on energy generation and<br />
distribution as already mentioned, and references on raw<br />
material pricing and forestry) and establishing new<br />
references as warranted.<br />
