PRIMtZ MINISTaR CA, 4SCRNA<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING NP<br />
The attack on me today by the Opposition's Alexander Downer~<br />
is outrageous. It arises from a flagrant and delibeirate<br />
distortion of accounts which are perfectly normal, and which<br />
have been audited by the accounting firm KP? 40 Peat MarwickC.<br />
My position is not at all comparable to Or Hawon's.<br />
The $ 4million profit referred to by Mr Dowaner arises from<br />
the trading company ( Brown and Hatton wholesale Pty Ltd) on<br />
its trading activities. But when grouped with the primary<br />
producing business-which carries the principal costs of<br />
production the " profito is properly and legitimately<br />
of fset.<br />
This to the normal operation of company grouping and the<br />
grouping provisions of the tax act, and in not tax<br />
minimisation. ] prHewson. and Mr Downer know this, and have resorted to this<br />
distortion to defend Dr Howson's own position. They seek to<br />
rely upon the media's inability to immediately understand<br />
the business and tax arrangements applying within a<br />
particular company or group.<br />
Dr Howson is reported to have minimised his tax by putting a<br />
domestic house into a company.<br />
This is not a device available to the vast majority of<br />
Australians. if Dr Hewson is looking for a comparable example in tax<br />
treatment, I bought a domestic house within one month of'him<br />
buying his home in February 1983. 1 have carried all of its<br />
costs personally and absolutely none have been deducted<br />
against other income, and the house was never placed in a<br />
company for the purposes of tax minimisation.<br />
I have never relied upon such dubious and slick practices.<br />
