    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PM do you feel that you need a house in Melbourne?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think of the plan by Lindsay Fox another businessman in Melbourne?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I don't think there's any need for any additional residences for the Australian Prime Minister anywhere.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do all the praise on the AFP for the raids, the possible disrupt of the terrorist gang in Melbourne and Sydney?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can't comment about operational matters.   I always leave that to ASIO and the Australian Federal Police, except to say that they have my full support in the professional way they carry out these things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you saddened by John Anderson's decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I won't be saying anything about the Deputy Prime Minister until he has spoken.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister apparently Kim Beazley's planning a reshuffle tonight, what...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I won't say anything about that at the moment either. Anything else?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think of this facility here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's terrific.  I think this is an illustration of the effective way that the Australian Federal Police are responding to the modern day needs of police. I think it's a wonderful thing.  They're getting practical, realistic training and the other great thing about it is that it involves the cooperation of regional police forces-and this is the way of the future -  for the indefinite future. The Australian Federal Police will be working closely with their counterparts in  small regional island states of the Pacific and it's very important from Australia's point of view that this be the high priority it is and that is why the Government has provided a lot more money to the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On that...the raids in Melbourne, would you think it's fair if Australian's woke up and saw those- Herald Sun and the Telegraph and were quite concerned by those reports?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think Australians must understand and I'm sure they do, that the Government and through its agencies-ASIO and the Australian Federal Police, is very vigilant indeed about potential threats. We should understand that they are there, that we should also not be unduly concerned and we have highly professional men and women who are looking after our interests and they deserve our continued 24 hour support.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
