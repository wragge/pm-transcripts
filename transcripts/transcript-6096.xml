PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION BY<br />
PRIME MINI* STER, MR BOB HTAWKE, ADELAIDE, 28 APRIL 1983<br />
* THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THE AMENDMENT PUT<br />
FORWARD BY NEW SOUTH WALES.<br />
* CONSISTENT WITH ITS BASIC PHILOSOPHY OF PROMOTING<br />
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, MY GOVERNMENT IS HAPPY TO SUPPORT<br />
REFERENCE OF THE XTERNAL AFFAIRS POWER TO A SUB-COMMITTEE<br />
OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION AND REPORT,<br />
BUT WE CONSIDER THE REFERENCE SHOULD BE ON AN EVEN-HANDED<br />
BASIS. -THIS AMENDED MOTION WOUL~ D ALLOW THE SUB-COMMITTEE TO<br />
PURSUE ITS WORK FREE FROM ANY FETTERS IMPOSED BY A<br />
PARTICULAR DELEGATE'S PREJUDGEMENT<br />
-IT IS APPROPRIATELY DIRECTED TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THE<br />
LEGISLATIVE POWER AS IS s. 51 ITSELF<br />
-AND IT INVITES ATTENTION TO THE COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
WHICH THE COMMONWEALTH, THE STATES AND THE NORTHERN<br />
TERRITORY HAVE DEVELOPED IN HANDLING INTERNATIONAL<br />
TREATIES.<br />
* ALTHOUGH PREFERRING TO HAVE REMOVED THE EMOTIVE LANGUAGE<br />
OF THE PROPOSAL BROUGHT BY QUEENSLAND TO THESE PROCEEDINGS,<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH RECOGNISF. S TH-AT THE QUESTION OF THE<br />
SCOPE OF THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS POWER IS OF CONSIDERABLE<br />
CONCERN TO AT LEAST SOME STATES.<br />
* THE NEW COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED AS A<br />
RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL PARTrNI7R TO APPROACH THE USE OF<br />
THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS POWER, AS INDEED IT APPROACHES<br />
ALL COMMONWEALTH POWERS, IN A SPIRIT OF CONSULTATION AND<br />
CO-OPERATION WITH THE STATES WHERE APPROPRIATE. </p>
<p>SI ulAMH APPY TO ASSURE PREMIERS THAT ON THE PARTICULAR<br />
QUESTION 01' O AUSTRALIA'S APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL<br />
TREATIES, WE GENERALLY AFFIRM THE PRINCIPLES AND<br />
PROCEDURES ENDORSED BY THE JUNE 1982 PREMIERS'<br />
CONFERENCE I WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH PREMIERS AND THE CHIEF<br />
MINISTER WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXAMINED THE<br />
PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES IN DETAIL.<br />
STHE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE THE PRACTICE OF<br />
CONSULTATION DURING TREATY NEGOTIATIONS AND WILL RECOGNISE<br />
THE ROLE STATES HAVE TO PLAY IN IMPLEMENTATION OF TREATIES<br />
IN AREAS TRADITIONALLY GOVERNED BY STATE LEGISLATION.<br />
BUT WE WILL ALSO MAINTAIN A RESPONSIBLE AND CREDIBLE<br />
INTERNATIONAL, POSITION AND ENSURE THAT AUSTRALIA PLAYS ITS<br />
PART IN DEVELOPING WORLD WIDE PRINCIPLES ON SUCH FUNDAMENT.<br />
ISSUES OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN AS HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE<br />
ENVIRONMENT. THIS CARRIES WITH IT THE OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT<br />
SUCHI TREATIES ARE IMPLEMENTED EXPEDITIOUSLY THROUGHOUT<br />
AUSTRALIA, AND WE WILL NOT BE PREPARED TO SEEK TO<br />
QUALIFY THAT OBLIGATION.<br />
I HAVE SOME DISQUIET, AS THE LEADER OF A RESPONSIBLE<br />
FEDEIRAl. GOVERN. LENT, WITH TWO ASPECTS OF THE MOTION MOVED<br />
BY QUeil:-ENS , A\ ND.<br />
THE ' FIRST [ wS THAT ' THE PREMISEIS LYING ijBEIIND THE MOTION<br />
APPEARS TO BE THAT AUSTRALIA CANNOT MEET ITS INTERNATIONAL<br />
OBLIGATIONS CONSISTENTLY WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF A<br />
FUNCTIONING FEDERAL STRUCTURE.<br />
SI TAKE STRENUOUS OBJECTION TO THIS PREMISE<br />
THE RIGHT AND INDEED THE DUTY OF A FEDERAL<br />
GOVERNMENT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF ALL AUSTRALIANS<br />
IN MATTERS RELATING TO THE INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIA<br />
AS A WHOLE IS A FUNDAMENTAL AND NATURAL PART </p>
<p>OF FUNCTIONING FEDERALISM.<br />
COMMONWEALTH ACTION IN RESPECT OF SOUTH-WEST TASMANIA<br />
IS CLAIMED BY SOME TO BE AN ABUSE OF THE EXTERNAL<br />
AFFAIRS POWER<br />
BUT HERE AUSTRALIA HAS RIGHTLY ENTERED INTO AN<br />
INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION TO PROTECT OUR HERITAGE<br />
AS ALL RESPONSIBLE NATIONS SHOULD<br />
WE HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO PERSUADE TASMANIA,<br />
AT WHOSE SUGGESTION THE WILDERNESS WAS NOMINATED FOR<br />
THE WORLD HERITAGE LIST, TO RESPECT THIS AREA OF<br />
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE<br />
LEGISLATIVE ACTION BY THE COMMONWEALTH SUPPORTED BY<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA IS AN ACTION OF LAST<br />
RESORT, BASED PARTLY ON THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS POWER,<br />
TO ENSURE AUSTRALIA DOES NOT BREACH AN EXISTING<br />
INTERNATIONAL AGIEEMENT NOR FAIL IN ITS DUTY TO ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS TO PROTECT ' HE AREA.<br />
THAT ACTION, IF UPHELD BY THE HIGH COURT, WILL BE<br />
SHOWN TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE<br />
CONSTITUTION.<br />
MY SECOND POINT OF CONCERN ON THE ORIGINAL MOTION REFERS<br />
TO WHAT I DISCERN TO BE A POSSIBLE MISREADING OF THE<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL SETTING.<br />
IT NEEDS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO<br />
THE CONSTITUTION, AND LONG RECOGNISED BY THE HIGH COURT,<br />
THAT STATE LEGISLATIVE POWER IS NOT SPECIFIC, BUT<br />
CONSISTS IN THE UNDEFINED RESIDUE OF LEGISLATIVE POWER<br />
WHICH REMAINS AFTER FULL EFFECT IS GIVEN TO SPECIFIC<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL GRANTS OF POWER TO THE COMDIONWEALTH,<br />
INCLUDING THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS POWER.<br />
THE APPROPRIATENESS AND VALIDITY OF PARTICULAR<br />
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATION MUST BE JUDGED AGAINST THE<br />
FULL POTENTIAL OF THE CONSTITUTION AND NOT AGAINST<br />
WHAT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE ' TRADITIONAL'<br />
DISPOSITION OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY. </p>
<p>* THE COMMONWEALTH1 PARLIAMENT ' S POWER TO MAKE LAWS WITH<br />
RESPECT TO EXTERNAL AFFAIRS UNDER SECTION 51( 29) IS AN<br />
INTEGRAL PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION WHOSE IMPORTANCE<br />
WAS FULLY RECOGNISED AT THE TIME OF FEDERATION.<br />
IN 1907 ALFRED DEAKIN STATED ' INDEED ONE OF THE<br />
PRINCIPAL REASONS THAT INDUCED AUSTRALIANS TO FEDERATE<br />
WAS THAT AS REGARD ALL PLACED OUTSIDE THIS CONTINENT<br />
THEY SHOULD SPEAK WITH ONE VOIC11"<br />
* WHILE CHANGES IN GLOBAL CONC8RNS HAVE CONCENTRATED RECENT<br />
ATTENTION ON THE TREATY MAKING ASPECTS OF THlE POWER, IT<br />
MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT TREATY MAKING AND OBSERVANCE IS<br />
ONLY PART OF THE GREATER WHOLE: THE LEGITIMATE CONDUCT<br />
OF AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.<br />
* THE HIGH COURT HAS, OF COURSE, RECOGNISED THAT THE EXTENT<br />
OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY EXPANDING<br />
BUT THE COURT REMAINS AS THE FINAL ARBITRATOR TO PROTECT<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION WERE THERE TO BE ANY ATTEMPTED<br />
CAPRICIOUS USE OF THE POWqR BY A COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT.<br />
IN SUMMARY, THE COMM1ONWEALTH VIEW OF THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS<br />
POWER IS THAT IT HAS EVOLVED IN A MANNER APPROPRIATE TO<br />
PERMITTING THE COMMONWEALTH TO MEET AUSTRALIA'S OBLIGATIONS<br />
AS A RESPONSIBLE MEMBER OF THE INTERNATI6NAL COMMUNITY.<br />
* BUT COM1MONWEALTH GOVERNMENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL<br />
SPECTRUM ARE SENSITIVE TO THE NEED TO COOPERATE WITH THE<br />
STATES AND NOT UNDULY INTERFERE IN THEIR ROLES.<br />
* NEVERTHELESS, I COMMEND TO THlE CONVENTION THE MOTION AS<br />
MODIFIED BY THE NEW SOUTH W4ALES AMENDMENT, WHICH WILL<br />
PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR A BALANCED REVIEW OF THE POWER. </p>
