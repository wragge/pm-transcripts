COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH 13Y<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M.<br />
ON<br />
CZECHOSLOVAKIA Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 22 August 19681<br />
Mr G40RTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
[ 8.01--Mr Speaker, the House is<br />
debating a motion proposed on behalf of<br />
, the Government by the Minister for<br />
kernal Affairs ( Mr Hasluck). The<br />
-tnotion is:<br />
That the House expresses its distress at and its<br />
abhorrence of the armed intervention in Czechoslovaldia<br />
by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,<br />
the East German regime, Poland, Hungary, and<br />
Cilgaria; condemns this action as a breach of the<br />
. ue Nations Charter and of accepted international<br />
conduct; calls for the immediate withdrawal<br />
of the forces unlawfully on Czechoslovakian<br />
territory and expresses the sympathy of<br />
the House for the people of Czechoslovakia in<br />
their ordeal.<br />
It may -be thought, Mr Speaker, that a<br />
parliamentary motion of support for the<br />
Czechs and a condemnation of the invaders<br />
in this place is a frail weapon, at least in<br />
the short term, to set against the tanks and<br />
the tommy guns of the Russian invaders;<br />
but it is a weapon available to us and, in<br />
the long term, in this and other parliaments<br />
C may not be as frail as it at first might<br />
appear. At least it is a weapon which the<br />
Czechoslovakian mission to the United<br />
Nations, at the behest of the Czechoslovakian<br />
National Assembly, asked us to<br />
C'-se, saying:<br />
We appeal to parliaments of all countries and<br />
to the world public opinion and ask them to support<br />
our legitimate requirements.<br />
Tonight, Sir, this Parliament has its chance<br />
to respond to that appeal. The history of<br />
21419/ 68 this sad affair is this: On 5th January this<br />
year Mr Novotny, First Secretary of the<br />
Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, a<br />
Stalin -type, hard line Communist, was<br />
replaced as First Secretary by Mr Alexander<br />
Dubeek. The Communist Party and the Government<br />
of Czechoslovakia began reforms<br />
of the existing political and economic system<br />
in Czechoslovakia. One of their objectives<br />
was to improve the material well-being of<br />
the Czechs by diverting to consumer goods<br />
those resources which had been almost<br />
entirely used for the development of heavy<br />
industry and of defence -to such an extent<br />
that all that was left for the Czechoslovakian<br />
people ' to live on were the base<br />
necessities of life.<br />
The second objective was to infuse some<br />
elements of democracy into the previous<br />
tyrannous, totalitarian Communist system of<br />
government which ' had prevailed in<br />
Czechoslovakia, and so freedom of<br />
speech was permitted, censorship of<br />
the Press, of radio and of television<br />
was abolished. Real discussions began in<br />
the national parliament. The courts were<br />
instructed to administer the law in accordance<br />
with the rule of law. The activities<br />
of the secret police were curbed and the<br />
free practice of religion was permitted. At<br />
the same time the Communist Party, under<br />
Mr Dubcek, remained in control of the<br />
country. The Czech Government reaffirmed<br />
its ' immutable friendship and alliance with </p>
<p>the Soviet Union'. Czech forces remained<br />
committed to the Warsaw Pact and the<br />
military alliance between Russia, Czechoslovakia<br />
and the other Warsaw Pact members<br />
remained as firm as ever. So, Mr<br />
Speaker, there was no abandonment of<br />
military union; there was no abandonment<br />
of Communist ideology. There was merely a<br />
brave experiment, seeking to give material<br />
benefit and seeking to give the right to<br />
think and speak openly and freely to Czechs.<br />
It was sought not to get rid of Communism<br />
but to keep Communism and have a measure<br />
of freedom too.<br />
This brief endeavour was soon to be<br />
crushed. Russia and the Communist regimes<br />
in eastern Europe, who depend for their<br />
existence on Soviet military power, could<br />
not stomach the revival of free speech and<br />
the revival of the rule of law. So at once<br />
a hostile Press campaign against the Czech<br />
Government began. In June of this year<br />
infantry and tank divisions ringed the<br />
frontiers of Czechoslovakia on the north,<br />
on the east and on the south. In July tension<br />
between Czechoslovakia and Russia began<br />
to run high but it appeared to have<br />
abated following a series of meetings<br />
between Czech and Soviet leaders, ending<br />
at Bratislava on 3rd August-the third of<br />
this month-1968. After that meeting, in<br />
the communique issued at its end, the<br />
Czechs pledged their commitment to the<br />
Soviet Union, to the Warsaw Pact and to<br />
Communism, and in return the five other<br />
countries taking part in that conference expressed<br />
their ' firm intention to do everything<br />
necessary to extend all round cooperation<br />
on the basis of the principle of<br />
equality, respect for sovereignty, independence<br />
and territorial integrity'. That was in<br />
the communique issued by Russia and the<br />
other Warsaw powers on 3rd August-this<br />
month. But in spite of that Soviet troops<br />
remained on the border and yesterday at<br />
approximately 8 o'clock in the morning<br />
Canberra time, which was night time in<br />
Czechoslovakia, Soviet and satellite troops<br />
launched an invasion over all the frontiers<br />
of Czechoslovakia in overwhelming strength<br />
while the Czech citizens slept. It is worth<br />
noting at this point, as was said at the<br />
Security Council meeting today, that that<br />
invasion so launched by Communist countries<br />
had obviously taken weeks of preparation.<br />
Millions of leaflets were dropped on Czechoslovakia; massive forces had been<br />
deployed; a dummy radio station and newspaper<br />
had already been set up. This surely<br />
indicates that the Soviet leaders, who<br />
embraced the Czechs at Cierna and Bratislava<br />
and who had issued the communique<br />
I have just quoted to the House, had already<br />
been planning all this invasion at a time<br />
when the public air was filled with smiles.<br />
This must be taken to be a gross act of<br />
perfidy that should be universally condemned<br />
by world opinion.<br />
By morning on the day of the invasion<br />
the country was under military occupation.<br />
Airborne troops had taken over Prague.<br />
Four to five hundred tanks ringed Prague,<br />
and the other centres of population were<br />
under military control. The glimmer of<br />
freedom which had begun to be seen in<br />
Czechoslovakia had gone, at least for now.<br />
The experiment was over, because that<br />
measure of criticism, that measure of free<br />
expression of opinion, that permission of<br />
argument which the Czechs had sought to<br />
introduce into the Communist body corporate<br />
had been judged too dangerous, too<br />
poisonous for that body to imbibe and ttolerate<br />
and to live with. The invade.<br />
believed it impossible for a Communist<br />
government to survive with the consent of<br />
or even subject to any public criticism from<br />
the governed of a Communist countrysurely<br />
in itself, Mr Speaker, an eloquecommentary<br />
on the Communist system J<br />
seen from within.<br />
As the Russian tanks rolled over the<br />
border to occupy the main centres of the<br />
country, as airborne troops dropped<br />
throughout Czechoslovakia, reports came<br />
over the Prague Government Radio. Those<br />
reports announced the invasion, announced<br />
that it was happening without the knowledge<br />
of the President of the Republic,<br />
the Chairman of the National Assembly,<br />
the Premier or the First Secretary of the<br />
Communist Party Central Committee-<br />
Indeed, the Central Committee of tl<br />
Czech Communist Party met and asked for<br />
calm in the population. They sought a<br />
lack of resistance to the marching troops,<br />
for the odds were too great and they did<br />
not wish a repetition of the blood bath r<br />
Hungary. On the next day, 21st August, the<br />
Czech Embassy in London issued a statement<br />
from the Central Committee of the<br />
Czech Communist Party which said: </p>
<p>The invasion of Czechoslovakia and the armed<br />
intervention by five states of the Warsaw Treaty<br />
were made against the will of the Government,<br />
against the will of the President of the National<br />
Assembly and other constitutional organs.<br />
No legal organ of the state power in<br />
Czechoslovakia had given consent to it or<br />
had requested it. Then came statements<br />
from the Czech mission to the United<br />
Nations, issued by the Minister of Foreign<br />
Affairs, transmitting a resolute protest at<br />
the Russian action and demanding the withdrawal<br />
of all armed troops forthwith. Mr<br />
Speaker, the troops remain. The whereabouts<br />
of Czech Government leaders are<br />
unknown. Whether or not they are safe.<br />
whether or not they live, is unknown.<br />
Faced with the need to justify an action<br />
which the world had hoped it would never<br />
see again, a repetition in the same unhalpy<br />
country of that aggression which Hitler<br />
committed in 1938, the Soviet Union now<br />
seeks to pretend that its troops were<br />
invited into Czechoslovakia. It has issued.<br />
through Tass, a long statement which purports<br />
to be the text of an appeal by a group<br />
of members, unnamed, of the Cen-tral Comttee<br />
of the Communist Party of Czecho-<br />
-,. ovakia and of the Government. The -text<br />
of the statement is signed simply and<br />
anonymously: ' A group of members of the<br />
Central Committee of the Communist<br />
Party'. They are still unnamed, or at least<br />
: y were still unnamed this afternoon.<br />
-hey will remain unnamed unless and until<br />
some puppet government can be installed<br />
by the military. Some people who, I believe,<br />
will forever after be reviled by the Czechs<br />
may be bought into accepting the rule of<br />
these invaders.<br />
On this matter our own mission at the<br />
United Nations has cabled us tonight that<br />
the shattering weakness of the Soviet case<br />
was that Malik, the USSR Ambassador to<br />
the United Nations, was unable to name<br />
even one prominent Czech in the Governi'nt<br />
or the Communist Party who could<br />
e identified as one of those who allegedly<br />
had asked for the Soviet intervention. He<br />
did not in fact name any Czech Government<br />
or Party leader at all.<br />
Because of what I have said in recounting<br />
history of this matter and because of<br />
the facts I have previously presented I do<br />
not believe the Russian claim. The Government<br />
does not believe the Russian claim.<br />
I think the Parliament and people of Australia do not believe the Russian claim and<br />
I doubt that anyone really believes the Russian<br />
claim, although it is perhaps significant<br />
that as far as we know only one government<br />
has made a broadcast in firm support of<br />
the Russian action in Czechoslovakia, and<br />
that broadcast was made over Radio Hanoi.<br />
What we have seen is brute military<br />
strength used to crush a military ally, an<br />
ideological partner, because some measure<br />
of free opinion had been risked. All that is<br />
needed to add a postscript, almost tragicomic,<br />
to this sombre story is something<br />
that appears in a letter written by the Soviet<br />
Ambassador to the United Nations to the<br />
Secretary-General of that body. In that<br />
letter the Soviet Ambassador said, on<br />
instructions from his Government, that the<br />
Soviet Union vigorously opposed consideration<br />
of this question by the Security Council<br />
' and takes this opportunity to call once again<br />
upon all states to observe strictly the principles<br />
of sovereignty and independence and<br />
of the inadmissibility of direct or indirect<br />
aggression against other states or peoples'.<br />
There must be, Mr Speaker, no limit to<br />
the impertinence of these people. This is a<br />
perfect example of what George Orwell<br />
called double-think.<br />
There is the history of this sorry matter.<br />
There are the reasons why this Parliament<br />
is asked on behalf of the Australian people<br />
to vote-unanimously, I hope-in condemnation<br />
of this Russian aggression, in support<br />
of the Czech Parliament, which has asked<br />
for our support, in support of the immediate<br />
withdrawal of the invading forces. The<br />
telling of this story may, perhaps necessarily,<br />
have been dull and detailed.<br />
But behind the words that describe<br />
the events that have happened are<br />
human tragedies in Czechoslovakia and<br />
a check to humanity's hopes in the world.<br />
I ask you to imagine the scenes, reported<br />
over Prague radio to a stunned world, of<br />
bloodshed as an invading tank crushed those<br />
who stood in its way and of bloodshed as<br />
a Czech woman was cut down by a tommy<br />
gunner in the streets. Perhaps a transcript<br />
of one such broadcast will underscore this<br />
point. Over the sound of cannon and<br />
machine gun fire which came across on the<br />
broadcast came the announcer's voice as<br />
follows: This is the last appeal. Shooting is heard outside.<br />
The end is near. Dubcek-Dubcek-Dubcek. </p>
<p>And then the broadcast ended-as, for a<br />
while, Czech hopes for freedom are ended<br />
and as, in sadness, are ended the hopes of<br />
so many of us who had hoped that<br />
European Communism might slowly allow<br />
the leaven of freedom to work and might<br />
slowly become more liberal. The falsity of<br />
these hopes, at least for the present but I<br />
hope not for the future, are now starkly<br />
clear. [ Extension of time granted]<br />
I thank the House. I will not trespass for<br />
long on what has been granted to me. Perhaps<br />
it may be said that this event does not<br />
at once impinge on the Australian people,<br />
but it does. Czechoslovakia, striving for<br />
freedom and some independence, never was,<br />
and is not now ' a far away country of which<br />
we know nothing'. Indeed, that excuse for<br />
ignoring its agony, which was once before<br />
used in the time of its former travail,<br />
impinged not only on Australians in the<br />
long run but on the world, since it was one<br />
of those steps which led to World War II. Czechoslovakia is a part of the community<br />
of nations. When the bell tolls for her<br />
attempt at freedom it tolls for attempts at<br />
freedom everywhere.<br />
There may be little enough that we can<br />
do at present but let us do the little we<br />
can. Let us pass this motion in the belief<br />
that in -this Parliament and in the other<br />
parliaments throughout the world, and in the<br />
minds and hearts of people who elect the<br />
members of this Parliament and the other<br />
parliaments of the world, there will come<br />
a force which, in the fullness of time, will<br />
see that the torch of Czech freedom is<br />
again raised high, as I believe it will be; that<br />
in those other countries which now have<br />
crushed Czechoslovakia the leaven still will<br />
work; that they will get those measures of<br />
freedom and, having them, will not feel<br />
in any way impelled to interfere with the<br />
rights of other countries-because in this<br />
way, Sir, and in this way alone, ultimately<br />
lies the path to peace.<br />
