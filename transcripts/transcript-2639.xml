OPENING OF DHUPUMA COLLEGE<br />
GOVE, N. T. 1 JULY, 1~ 72,.<br />
Speech by the Prime Hlinister, The Rt. Hon. William ?' c. ahon<br />
M. P.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, and most importantly, boys and girls:<br />
Thanks for the invitation to come here today to open this<br />
school. Down south, we hear a lot about this very fast-growing<br />
and developing part of the Northern Territory, but not enough<br />
Australians get the chance to come up here personally to see for<br />
themselves what is going on.<br />
On Australia day five months ago, I made a statement about<br />
my Government's policies for aboriginal citizens. It covered<br />
important questions relating to the future progress of the<br />
aborigines themselves. Some of my comments may not be known to you,<br />
so I shall try to tell you what I said in that statement.<br />
We had five changes to make in our programmes and policies<br />
for aborigines. First we wanted to ensure that aborigines have<br />
free and unimpeded access to the rights and privileges of our<br />
society. We want to encourage and assist them to keep and develop<br />
their own culture as a worthwhile and wholesome part of Australian<br />
life. We want to emphasise that overy aborigine has the right to<br />
say how closely and how-soon he will become integraded into the<br />
mainstream of Australian society.<br />
This is more likely to happen when aborigines retain their<br />
own identity, traditions and their own culture.<br />
The third point of my statement on Australia Day was that<br />
our objectives must be based on plans which recognise the wishes<br />
and the aspirations of the aborigines themselves; and which provides<br />
the opportunities to develop their own personalities and abilities:<br />
And which involve the aboriginal people themselves in the working<br />
out of those plans.<br />
The fourth objective is for government programmes to ensure<br />
that aboriginal citizens manage their own affairs as much as this<br />
is practicable in order to improve their potential and ensure<br />
their fullest partici. ation in the national progress: And further<br />
so that handicaps in health, housing, education and vocational<br />
training can be reduced. / 2 </p>
<p>We also want to remove the few rcmaining laws which<br />
discriminate against aborigines.<br />
I cannot emtnhasise enou,-1-01. at this statement of policy<br />
objectives means in effect that Australian as a people, through<br />
the Federal Government, recognise that aborigines have many problems<br />
and difficulties notf7, ce. by '--thcr .7trnlinn. It ma ns thert w,:<br />
will -'-ovoryt!, i1n7 * ssill see that -~ ur abor~ rri-nal citizo: ns have<br />
th cortunities to--reach at least the sam~ e standards of living and<br />
education as are anjoyed b~ y all other Pustralians.<br />
The opening of a newr school is, I believe, a big event in any<br />
community; But the opening of a new school to meet the needs of<br />
aboriginal. communities is an evan bigger event. Soon in these<br />
buildings there will be new, young, fresh minds who will play their<br />
Dart inl the future of our country.<br />
May I snpeac ow.% to the older people here, and particularly to<br />
the parents. * You havo., and] you will see many changes -chancles which<br />
have brought and will bring you and your families benefits as well<br />
as problems. Your children are now grow'ing up in a very different<br />
world to yours, and for that matter even to mine. School will<br />
fire their minds. The: y will ask questions and perhaps question the<br />
authority of their parents.<br />
Seeing these chang-ms might influe'nce parents to take their<br />
children away from schi-ool. You must not let this hap~ pen: It is<br />
better to accerot that our children will wa nt to ' change the worlti.<br />
Some of you may feel that knowledge will loosen the bonds<br />
between children and their parents, and load them to neglect: their<br />
old ways. We must try nnd haln them enjoy both the new and the<br />
old. Schooling should teach children to resnpect both old and new<br />
ways, and should forster a child; love and respect for his parents,<br />
his home and his culture.<br />
To you students I say--Work hard3 at school because every<br />
bit of knowledcae will make you better E1Pedto face the outside<br />
world when you have grown into youn; j men and' women.<br />
Ohupuma College is thc second residential school in the<br />
Northern Territory for aboriginal children. Kormilda, in Darwin,<br />
was the first. A third college is now being built at Alice S-rings.<br />
It will cost a lot of money, but money is not important. What is<br />
important is the onnortunity which these colleges provide for young<br />
UreonAe. Kormil-da means "' tomorrow" and Dhunumua, as you know, means<br />
" looking up" t. These names are well chosen, and -will enourage you<br />
to look up to your life of tomorrow. Twenty-eight of you young<br />
people come fro~ m Kcormilda. I want you to bel-p Dhupuma develon in<br />
the same way. You should think of it, nct sn much as anothe-r school,<br />
but rather ft a place of opportunity and riewarding assocation.<br />
Having said this, it now gives me very great oleasure to<br />
officially declare this College npen. </p>
