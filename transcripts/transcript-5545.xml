ELECTORATE TALK<br />
I want to talk tonight about the threats currently posed to<br />
economic recovery by excessive wage increases and the 35 hour<br />
week campaign.<br />
A surge in labour costs at this time will place Australia's<br />
economic recovpry at risk. We must take steps now to prevtnt<br />
such a surge from occurring. Several major signs of recovery<br />
are now plain to see. Prices are not rising so rapidly,<br />
inflation is down at around 9% last year. The amounts spent<br />
on new factories and development projects have risen greatly.<br />
Resources exploration and development have started up again<br />
in a major way, and about 170,000 additional new jobs<br />
were created last year.<br />
These are significant gains, but they are gains that can<br />
be thrown away. For there are warning signs flashing and<br />
these signs are coming from labour costs. Last year average<br />
weekly earnings rose by 13.7%. Thii increase is far in<br />
excess in the rise in prices. It is half as much again. It<br />
means that real wages last year increased by nearly<br />
Business has to pay for these higher wages with money that<br />
could-otherwise be used to expand production and create more Jobs.<br />
W~ hat we ' Want as Australians is to sell more Australian goods.<br />
Australian industry-is now growing strongly.<br />
We are now exporting products to markets around the world,<br />
selling Australian goods means more jobs in Australian industry.<br />
But if Australian goods cost too much, we won't be able to<br />
sell them in competition with other countries. Selling more<br />
Australian goods means employing more Australians. That is<br />
surely what we all want.<br />
The problem of excessive wage increases is now made worse<br />
by the development of a strong campaign for shorter working<br />
hours. A campaign which seeks shorter hours but<br />
without offsetting reductions in wages or in holidays or<br />
in any of the other costs which must be met by those who<br />
provide the jobs in our community. It is obvious that the<br />
higher the,.. cost of creating a new job the less likely it is<br />
that jobs will be created. If the cost of employing people<br />
is too high then small businesses in particular will think<br />
more than once before they expand their workforce. We have<br />

had enough experience of downward spirals in our economy,<br />
we want now to maintain the momentum of an upward spiral.<br />
That is the way in which prosperity can ' eontinue to spread<br />
through this community.<br />
The threat which a surge in labour costs imposes m ust not be<br />
under estimated. The Government regards this threat with grbat<br />
seriousness.' The people of Australia need to know what is at:<br />
stake in the 35 hour week campaign and in excessive wage<br />
demands. We all need to know about the damage that will--<br />
result unless the Government and the community take a joint<br />
stand for the interests of Australia as a whole. It needs<br />
to be understood that the large wage rises to which I refer<br />
show the effects of campaigns by some militant and greedy<br />
sectional interests which have pushed relentlessly fc~ r too<br />
much. None of us can afford to view such campaigns as being directed<br />
just against individual employers or just against particular<br />
industries. They are a cynical and selfish grab for moremoney<br />
by powerful unions at the expense of the rest of th~ e<br />
country. These campaigns are no better than the antisocial<br />
tax avoidance schemes which are so abhorent to the<br />
Australian community and which the Treasurer, John Howard,<br />
has-done so much to stamp out.*<br />
The 35 hour week campaign shows a heartless disregard of the<br />
need of our young people to have jobs. I-is in effect an<br />
attack by people who have jobs on-those who do not. ' Those<br />
who are attempting to grab an unfair share of prosperity<br />
for themselves at the expense of their fellow citizens are<br />
simply not living up to the responsibilities we all owe<br />
to other people. The future of Australia is limitless if<br />
we are prepared to act together with a sense of responsibility<br />
but -our future can be seriously damaged by a short-sighted<br />
pursuit ~ of selfish gains.<br />
We in the Government stand for the public interest and the<br />
public interest demaands that labour costs must not rise at<br />
a rate which is higher than economic recovery and economic<br />
growth in this country can sustain. Unless this condition<br />
is met all our other efforts to promote economic progress<br />
and prosperity in Auistralia may prove fruitless and the<br />
recovery for which we have worked so hard over recent years<br />
may slip from our grasp. We must unite to make sure that<br />
this does not happen, that we recognise our common interests<br />
as Australians. 000--</p>
