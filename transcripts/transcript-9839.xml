TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, RAAF FAIRBAIRN, CANBERRA, 14 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: A remark on the Lawrence Royal Commission we only have at this<br />
stage Premier Court's summary of the report, and I would like to read<br />
the full report. But I think we have only got to regard the result as very<br />
dubious open to doubt as indeed Commissioner Marks said it would<br />
be in one of his public statements. He also said at that time of that<br />
statement, that the terms of reference had turned out to be fairly<br />
restrictive, he said it was " part of my training not to make assumptions<br />
on half the evidence". In other words, he was saying that it was<br />
restrictive, the evidence and the findings would be open to doubt.<br />
Well, they are open to doubt if what we believe to be the findings are<br />
an accurate reflection of what Mir Court has said, and I just simply<br />
make the point that it was a political Royal Commission set up by the<br />
Opposition, by John Howard and Richard Court for the most base<br />
political motives, it has not a shred of integrity to it in the drawing up of<br />
the Royal Commission's terms of reference, it's been a charade from<br />
front to back, and it was condemned by the Royal Commissioner in<br />
terms of process. And we can only agree with the Royal<br />
Commissioners own observation that it would be open to doubt, and<br />
therefore I regard the whole process as dubious and worthless.<br />
J Do you retain confidence in Dr Lawrence?<br />
PM: I have complete confidence in her, all these claims and counter-claims<br />
it's always seemed to me that her version of these things are fairly<br />
clear anyway, but the key evidence was given by Mr Marquet, the<br />
Clerk of the Upper House, who said it would have been improper for<br />
any Premier or Member of the Executive Government to stop a<br />
Member of Parliament presenting a petition. Like me as Prime Minister<br />
stopping a Member of Parliament presenting a petition in the House of<br />
Representatives or the Senate. That was the knockout evidence, but<br />
of course, it came late and the sequencing of the witnesses was such </p>
<p>that all of the very notable evidence was given by people who are<br />
giving evidence against Carmen Lawrence. So, she has my complete<br />
support and I'm sure the support of everyone in the Government, and<br />
our sympathy for having to go through such a process where we have I<br />
seen the grossest form of personal abuse at the hands of the Liberal<br />
Party. A $ 6 million Royal Commission arrayed against one woman.<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: I haven't seen them the findings in detail.<br />
ends. </p>
