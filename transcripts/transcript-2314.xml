OPENING OF BOTANIC GARDENS<br />
CANBERRA, ACT OCTOBER 1970<br />
S-) eech by the Prime Minister, MrjhnGoton<br />
Mr Minister, Distinguished Guests, Lad; s and Gentleamen<br />
You have heard from my colleague, the Min-: ster for the Interior somiething<br />
of the history of these Gardens, which have indeed been unofficially open for somle<br />
three years. And I have no doubt that many of you over the weekend have wallked, as<br />
my wife and I have walked through these gardens when they were unofficially c.-eil, and<br />
watched them taking shape and -watched the imaginative use of running w.. ater, of native<br />
stone and of groupings of native flora in this lovely area.<br />
It is, as Mr Nixon has said, an event of special relevance in our Cook<br />
Bi-Centenary Year because these gardens are, in a sense, a tribute to Joseph Banks and<br />
the naturalists and botanists who have followed in Bank.-s' footsteps. Because it was<br />
Banks, even more thar. Cook, who urged on the British Government the foundation of<br />
the first colony on our east coast, and it was he and his scientific team who were the<br />
first to take home to England specimens of Australian shrubs and plant.-, collected<br />
when that team came ashore from the " Endeavour" in Botany Bay and at other Doints<br />
along our coast two hundred years ago.<br />
Banks was important in his time, a wealthy young squire who spent on<br />
fitting up in the " Endeavour' for his team of botanists twice the amount a~ money<br />
that the " Endeavour' itself as a ship cost. To give you some indication of the<br />
thoroughness with which he did his job, when he got home with his collection ai<br />
Australian flora, it was described by a world-famous Swedish botanist of the day<br />
as " a matchless, and truly astonishing collection, such as has never been seer.. before,<br />
nor may ever be again. I don't know what Linnaeus, that Swedish botanist woculd have<br />
said had he seen the matchless collection which has now come before us -for its official<br />
opening today, and if this collection here in these gardens is not thoroughly matchless<br />
although I think It probably is but if not, and if it is not unique of its kcind, then I<br />
have no doubt whatever that under the guidance of Mr Shoobridge it very shortly will<br />
be if it isn't already.<br />
This has taken, much work, much effort and much planning. I think it was<br />
Kipling, was it not who wrote " The Lord God made a garden, and gardeas are not<br />
made by saying ' How beautiful' and sitting in the shade. And that is true of any<br />
garden, but particularly of Botanic Gardens such as this, for they spring as do almost<br />
all things of significance and enduring importance, from hard work, hard thinkcing, hard<br />
planning, a genius for a feeling for nature, and then really solid hard sweat as well.<br />
These are the ingredients of gardens. a o. / 12 </p>

We have here, as Burley Griffin was told to make in Canberra, in his brief,<br />
a garden city, and I think he has made one in C-inberra because we have in the city<br />
generally brought together exotic plants from other countries and I may be permitted,<br />
perh aps, to call the oak and the elm an exotic plant as far as Australia is concerned<br />
mixed with our own flora, and they make a delightful combination for the~ eye. But<br />
here in this garden within a garden is a part of Australia of Australian trees alone.<br />
I hope that there will be many such gardens as these throughout Australia,<br />
and I hope that we will never reach a stage when our flora is confined to gardens such<br />
as these, for we would all want to see them growing wild and free around the<br />
countryside. And it is a part of community responsibility to protect flora so that this<br />
can happen. This I believe, is becoming far more ingrained into the consciousness of<br />
Australians. And also, perhaps, it is a task, a simple task that many might tak,-e up<br />
to do what Johnny Appleseed did through the Mid-West of America when he wallked through<br />
just planting apple-seeds as he went, in places he might never see again, hut they<br />
grew -For the benefit of other people. And so could plants and trees and shrubs be<br />
planted, perhaps as a return to what this country gives to those who live in it, -planted<br />
by individuals for the benefit of other individuals later.<br />
Sir, it is my great pleasure to welcome you all here to this official<br />
opening and to say how pleased and proud we are in Australia to have So many<br />
delegates from the International Congress of Parks Administrators. VWe are glad<br />
that your First Congress in the Southern Hemisphere was here, and equally proud<br />
that your new President is our own Director of Parks and Gardens, Mr Shoobricige.<br />
So we are happy to have you in Canberra, and especially glad to have you with us on<br />
this occasion when I now declare these Botanic Gardens open. </p>
