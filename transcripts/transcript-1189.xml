FEDERAL COUNCIL OF THE LIBERAL PARTY OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, TWENTY-FIRST ANNIVERSARY<br />
HOTEL CANBERRA, CANBERRA. 8TH NOVEMBER. 1 965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir, I think I ought not to begin to make a speech on<br />
our anniversary, on our twenty-first birthday, without saying<br />
something about my wife, ( hear hear)( applause) because not only<br />
for twenty-one years, but for twenty-four, for twenty-seven, for<br />
well whatever you say, dear she has been alongside of mO<br />
and every time I have come back ana said, " Oh, no I can't stand<br />
it an longer", she has said, " Well, give it anotAer got" and so,<br />
Pat, wan to say to you on this great honorific occasion that<br />
this dinner ought to be in your honour and not mine.<br />
You know tonight I am going to exert the privilege<br />
of an old man and be a little reminiscent. Do you mind hat?<br />
I think a little reminiscence doesn't come amiss. I was looking<br />
around this afternoon at the meeting of the Council and looking at<br />
a young boy like Andrew Peacock and I sent around a special<br />
emissary to say, " How old is Andrew?" and the answer came back<br />
I hope coirectly he's 26. That means that when we had our meetings<br />
in 1944 in Canberra and at Albury falsely called Owlbury by some<br />
people that goes for West Australia but not for New South Wales;<br />
that means that at that time, young Andrew was five years old,<br />
if not actually mewling and puking, at any rate near enough<br />
( Laughter) to give an air of verisimilitude to an otherwise bald<br />
and unconvincing narrative. Five years old. Think of it.<br />
Would you mind standing up Andrew? ( Applause) Almost in the<br />
cradle when this began. I think this is fascinating; it's<br />
marvellous, and I was reminded of it today when as a result of a<br />
move to which I lent such venerable support as I have the Young<br />
Liberals were here today speaking quite freely and voting quite<br />
freely, I though, " Isn't this wonderful?" because, old man as I<br />
am, I will never forget that it is the young men and young women<br />
who represent the future of our party. THear, hear) ( Applause)<br />
moment we have Shiandce ma1n9y44 , p reasbioduetn twsh ich II w wiillll nosta y bea wgoirvdi ngi no uat a<br />
list of names but we have had many presidents, we Have had<br />
State secretaries, we have had all sorts of marvellous people who<br />
have worked for our party, and among them all I would like to<br />
mention here and now Bob Willoughby. ( Applause) A tiresome fellow<br />
who occasionally tells me where I get o or where I get on but<br />
we will never sufficiently understand the people we have haA both<br />
here and in the State Departments, the State Divisions people<br />
like my friend John Carrick and McConnell and all the rest we<br />
will never fully understand how vastly important they have been<br />
to this party, lo this organisation and to the future of this side<br />
of politics. Well having said that I want to tell you that back<br />
in 1945 I hud a roblem. Might I tell you, being a reminiscent<br />
old boyI as to what had happened? In 1941, I was believe it or<br />
not Prime Minister and in 1941, believe it or not, I was made<br />
to understand that it would be of advantage if I resigned from<br />
being Prime Minister. So being the instant obedient of views,<br />
I sald, " All right", and I did and so I went out and then for a<br />
few weeks another government was in control and then at the end of<br />
that time, in about August or September of 1941, we were beaten / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
by the Labor Party. That produced at once a problem. I'm sure<br />
that all of you who have . ever gone through this painful experience<br />
will understand it perfectly perhaps to be something different,<br />
and so I had a meeting of my party.<br />
We were then a rather, well, smallish majority and we had<br />
a meeting and then not all my colleagues but some of them said to<br />
me, " WelI, you know, we think you ought not to be the Leader of<br />
the Opposition, though we were much the greatest party in Opposition.<br />
And then I propounded a view for which I make no apology which was<br />
that a party which is unwilling to lead is not worth leading. I<br />
mention this tonight because I think it is something that may<br />
perhaps in the future be thought of a little: A party that is<br />
unwilling to lead is not worth leading. And so I resigned, and<br />
from 1941 to 1945, I sat in the Opposition corner, just about where<br />
Jim Cope sits today or words to that effect, do you see? This'<br />
was very interesting. There I sat.<br />
I wasn't on the Executive Committee when the next election<br />
came round. I didn't know what was in the programme. I hadn't<br />
been told. I hadn't been asked. And I mention this because there<br />
are a few people who think that I was leading the Opposition at the<br />
1945 election. I wasn't. I was over there in the corner. And<br />
they had an election and of course being what I am, I went all round<br />
Australia. I was counted out and had things chucked at me, but<br />
I wasn't the leader of anything except myself, and so we were<br />
beaten and having been beaten we came back. 1943. And that was<br />
when tAe road back began.<br />
Now I want to say this to all of you, all of you great,<br />
strong Liberals that was when the road back began, because after<br />
the 1943 election, some of my colleagues came to me and said,<br />
" Would you care to be Leader of the prty?" and I said with my<br />
usual humbleness, " All right". ( Laughter) " I don't mind, but<br />
must be the Leader of the Opposition, which had been denied in<br />
1941, and I must above all things have the right, the clear right,<br />
to develop a new party to agglomerate the whole of our opposition<br />
in Australia. My colleagues having had a severe battering in<br />
the 1945 election, strangely enough said, " Yes, that's O. K.<br />
We'll see to that. So it was agreed.<br />
Now I don't know whether you all realise of course the<br />
older among you realise this perfectly but I have been looking<br />
around among the young to whom I attach all the importance in the<br />
world for the future do you realise that after that election when<br />
our side of politics had the biggest thrashing it ever had we had<br />
fourteen different political organisations in Australia fourteen.<br />
Bill Anderson who took a great part in this matter, he ran a thing<br />
called the..... Services and Citizens was it Bill? Look, we had<br />
fourteen different organisations over the whole of Australia andthe<br />
great thing was to bring them together and have one because<br />
unless we had one we were not only out in 1945, we were out<br />
. crever. And so I sat back in my box, being then a very humble<br />
Leader of the Opposition. These were the days when a Leader of<br />
the Opposition drew a private member's pay and had an allowance of<br />
Å“ 300 a year and lost and lost and lost year by year, and I had<br />
the great good fortune to have with me P. woman who is here tonight<br />
Eileen Lenihan and she had with her Miss Wilkinson whom some of<br />
you know ( Applause). In my brash innocence, I said " All right.<br />
Now I am going to have one party in this country" and we got to work.<br />
I did what I am always pleased to credit myself with the brainwork,<br />
you know. There were fourteen organisations " Well write to<br />
them. They'll write to me." Oh, I had great assistance Bill </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Anderson, he conducted one of the most lively of these factional<br />
groups. He was all on my side. And look, forgetting all names,<br />
in 1944, in that rather revolting building you now wat I mean,<br />
don't you Jock you know, that thing. Ayhow it was that building<br />
that looks flat on the top. We had a meeting and we had a great<br />
argument fourteen different organisations. This was really the<br />
most incredible affair in the world, and the fourteen met. We had<br />
great arguments. I even had a great argument with Tom Playford<br />
where's Tom? Even had a great argument with Tom, but in the long<br />
run, we agreed that instead of being fourteen, we ought to be one.<br />
Now this was a remarkable achievement, and it happened.<br />
And so we were agreed that we would have a meeting at<br />
Albury, fondly called Owlbury by McBride. It's like Freeth who<br />
always insists on Albany being called Owlbany. Anyhow, it was<br />
Albury and we had another great conference, and being what I am,<br />
I sat down and wrote out in my own unfair hand a constitution and<br />
a platform. At this stage, young Bob Willoughby, he came to work.<br />
He s a tiresome fellow, you know who has the signal dishonour of<br />
devoting the whole of his adult life to the service of our party,<br />
and he got to work on it too, Anyhow the constitution and the<br />
platform, And of course they were both altered; in my recollection,<br />
both to the worse, and before 1944 was out there was a new party,<br />
the Liberal Party of Australia, which had begun to ring the bell<br />
all around the world.<br />
Now I wouldn't want you to believe that there were no<br />
problems to be solved. There were great problems to be solved.<br />
One of the very first was this that in my earlier days in politics<br />
and in the earlier days of perhaps nobody else, an how mine we had<br />
financial bodies which raise d the money, which tola the party<br />
organisation what to do. In Melbourne the National Union; in<br />
Sydney,( thank God it was under the control of a very wise and<br />
great man, the late Sir Charles Lloyd Jones) the Consultative<br />
Council. And the first thing that we had to determine in Albury<br />
was whether we would continue to be a party organisation financed<br />
by other people and therefore to that extent controlled by other<br />
people, or whether we would raise our own mone, raise our own funds<br />
and be in command of our own resources. And the first great<br />
decision made by the Liberal Party of Australia was: We will<br />
raise our own funds, we will control our own funds, and ever since<br />
then, nobody has ever been able to say that we were doing what some<br />
moneyed fellows wanted us to do. ( Applause)<br />
And the second thing that happened was that we had to<br />
determine whether the platform of the party and the policy of<br />
the party should be under the control of the organisation. Now,<br />
this was a very great issue, and I want you all to remember this<br />
because as the first draftsman of the platform of the party, I had<br />
a very clear idea that nothing should happen that commandea the<br />
people who were in Parliament. In other words, by a sheer stroke<br />
of luck I anticipated the idea that if the people in Parliament<br />
were told what they were to say, then there would be the thirty-six<br />
faceless men. And this, believe me is one of our great strokes<br />
of fortune. Nobody has ever been able to say that about us " the<br />
thirty-six faceless men" because we have from beginning to end said,<br />
" The platform, the broad principles on which we live, of course we<br />
announce them, of course we do, of course we publish them, but when<br />
it comes to an election policy then we must pay regard to our<br />
leaders, to the Parliamentary Members. We must not have them put<br />
in the position of being tola what they are to say in amplification<br />
of the platform, in pursuance of the platform, in the policy that<br />
they pronounce. And therefore we very early established a system<br />
in which a proper status was organised for the Australian Parliamentary<br />
leaders and party instead of subordination. That's very<br />
important. And this enabled us long afterwards to attack effectively<br />
the thirty-six faceless men. / 4 </p>
<p>1?-<br />
Now having said that,' may Ilgo back a little. You see,<br />
1945, we lost, we were thrashed; 14 we created the new party;<br />
1946 we had some victories, some, not many, and after the 1946<br />
election, all round the club rooms in Sydney, Melbourne, even<br />
Adelaide, they began to say, " Oh, you can never win with Menzies."<br />
This is worth remembering You can never win with Menzies".<br />
And they had all sorts of ideas qite prolific ideas, as to<br />
who ought to do theljob, and notody could agree with anybody<br />
else and so poor ol dMenzies he was still there for the 1949<br />
elections. And in the 1949 elections, look we had the most enormous<br />
gowth, we had the most marvellous entAusiasm reachin a pitch<br />
retmaat rkhaabdl en eavnedr, yboeuenng apspetr oaocf hecda ndbiefdoartee. s and Wew e Aahadd , e ndleivsefleodp eda an<br />
issue. I don tknow that we are entitled to all the credit for<br />
the issue but we had developed one socialism, which up to that<br />
time had teen a sort of academic idea you know, a sort of<br />
debating society idea and which was then taken out of the realm<br />
of academic debate tAank Heaven, by the Chi fley Government whi~ ch<br />
had reduced it to terms in the Air services and in banking<br />
airlines and bankin. And this enabled us in 1948/ 1949 to<br />
concentrate the public attention on socialism as perhaps we could<br />
never have concentrated it before, and so we won in spite of<br />
Menzies. Then of course since then we have had victories in 1951<br />
and 1954 and 1955 and 1958 and 1961 and 1965, in spite of the<br />
old man. This, I think, is rather fascinating. But it is one<br />
thing to say we have won seven consecutive elections. it is<br />
quite another thing to say, " Why have we? What have we done?"<br />
Now this is really the No. 1 question: " Why have we?"<br />
and the only answer to that is to , say, " Well, what have we done?"<br />
I know it is , commonplace to say " Oh , you know his opponents have<br />
made errors." I don't doubt that. Ii'ye usually watched for them.<br />
Suppose our opponents have made errors, what have we done in the<br />
las sxteen years to justi fyging to the country and sayirg<br />
" We want another term. N'ow this is the great question. IOU<br />
can't live on the past. And so I have been saying to myself,<br />
" Well, now, what have we done? What have we done in the laot<br />
sixteen years to give us what I believe to be true an unrivalled<br />
reputation all round the world." This is true * hat have we<br />
done? Well, in international affairs, we started off with the<br />
Colombo Plan. That was ours, you know. Never forget that.<br />
The Colombo Plan, the plan under which Australia and twenty<br />
countries have lent their aid to people in the Eastern world.<br />
ANZIJS. I remember being taken apart by dear old Winston in </p>
<p>London, because he said, " You know, you have forgotten us." And<br />
I said, " No not at all. ANZUS Australia and New Zealand and<br />
the United States. And if anybody who is concerned with the<br />
history of our time who is not bemused by being an intellectual<br />
will just think a little, he will realise that the ANZUS Pact<br />
meant so much to us in Australia and to our security and to the<br />
security of our children and our grandchildren this is out of<br />
the world the ANZUS Pact, and the Americans understand it in<br />
exactly tAe same way as we do.<br />
And then there was another achievement of ours, the<br />
SEATO Treaty the Ã¸ outh East Asian Treaty organization. Well,<br />
now you know all sorts of people they are very clever, they<br />
understand that this doesn't mean a thing. Doesn't it mean a<br />
thing? You know, Dean Rusk himself being challenged as to why<br />
the Americans were in South Viet Nam said, " The SEATO Treaty".<br />
This is right. He is there, the United States is there our<br />
eople are there, many other people are there because this reat<br />
treaty was designed and consummated. It is a treaty against<br />
communist aggression. So therefore SEATO is a wonderful thing.<br />
Then apart from all these things, well, look, I would<br />
weary you if I tried to explain to you how our trusteeship has<br />
been performed. Defence. Some of you heard my colleague this<br />
afternoon on the subject of defence. Defence. Would you have<br />
supposed five years ago that Australia would be doing so much in<br />
defence as it is now? No, not a bit. Defence has been one of<br />
the great things, the development of resources. You know, it is<br />
always easy for people to say, " Oh, well of course, you know,<br />
you just want to leave things alone." * e don't want to leave<br />
things alone. If I were to say to my colleague, my distinguished<br />
Liberal colleague, David Fairbairn, " Tell us about development in<br />
Australia; tell us about uranium tell us about bauxite, tell<br />
us about all these things", the whab story would be so tremendous,<br />
somebody would be bound to say, " Yes, but what is the Government<br />
doing about it?" This is true.<br />
If we were to talk about..... I look across there and I<br />
see Oppy..... talk about Immigration. Immigration. This is the<br />
most fabulous story in the world and this has been going year after<br />
year. Somebody then is heard to say, " Well, of course ou couldn't<br />
do these things without capital from overseas," to which I reply,<br />
v" hy not?" Believe me, all these remarkable things that have<br />
happened in Australia are happenin-because we have money and we<br />
have manpower and they marry together. Now Immigration has<br />
produced a great deal of the manpower and the money has been<br />
produced time after time by investment from overseas. And for<br />
people to say, " We don't want it. We don't want investment from<br />
overseas"/ is almost as if they said " We don't want people from<br />
overseas." Really, ladies and gentlemen, this whole problem,<br />
this whole tremendous earth-shaking problem from our point of<br />
view is one which requires the marriage of money, of peole, of<br />
enterprise, and one of the great fortunes of your Government in<br />
all these years has been to say something and do something about<br />
the marriage of all these developments so that this marvellous<br />
country of ours can proceed.<br />
Now that is all I want to say except one thing. I<br />
mentioned earlier one or two of my younger colleagues in this<br />
conference. You knowi many years ago I was one of the founders<br />
of the Young Nationalist Organisation in Australia and later on,<br />
I saw this and did this and did this.<br />
Look the future of this country doesn't belong to you<br />
of my generation or to others of my generation. It belongs to<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
the young ones of this generation. ( Hear, hear) ( Applause)<br />
It's not just funny for me to think of somebody as mentioned<br />
earlier who was five years old when this movement began. This<br />
is tremendously important. People like me I will be 71 next<br />
December people like me are not to be regarded as eternally<br />
in charge of an organisation or a reat movement. What is<br />
needed is that all of us should understand that it is the young<br />
who not only have the responsibility for the future but who must<br />
have the authority for the future. Now this is tremendously<br />
important, tremendously important.<br />
Oh dear, if I could only sit down carefully and write<br />
my benediction to my successors, I would indeed be happy, and<br />
I want to say to all of the young who are here tonight: This<br />
is your job. The future is not only within your power but<br />
within your responsibility, and so far as we are concerned,<br />
my wife and myself, we hope to live long enough to realise how<br />
well you are doing your job and how much you are doing for<br />
Australia. </p>
