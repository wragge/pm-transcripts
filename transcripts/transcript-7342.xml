PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 JUNE 1988<br />
ECONOMIC DECLARATION FROM TORONTO SUMMIT<br />
The Prime Minister today welcomed the priority given by<br />
lpadurs at tho Toronto Ecnic SviujuiL L. u the reform ot worLd<br />
agricultural trade, but expressed disappointment that the<br />
] padars could not agree tha~ t early steps would be taken at<br />
the M~ id-~ term Review of the Uruyudy Round to wind back farm<br />
subs idies.<br />
Agricultural trade reform was a key issue at the Economic<br />
Summit, It Is pleasing that the leaders at the Summit<br />
explicitly recognised the necessity of ensuring that the<br />
Mid-term Review at Montreal in December adds impetus to the<br />
negotiations on trade liberalisation, especially in<br />
agriculture.<br />
The willingness of the leaders to consider short-term options<br />
for winding back farmn subsidies is an especially welcome<br />
development. But the la'tk of agreement at this stage to the lIplemenitation<br />
of measures at the Mid-term Review for early action on<br />
agriculturo means that all pakLicipants In che process must<br />
work hard between now and December to develop short-term and<br />
long-terin proposals for agricultural trade reform.<br />
Australia urges that the negotiations in Geneva over the next<br />
few months recognise the legitimate interests of the Cairns<br />
Group and develop specific proposals for early action which<br />
cain be endorsed at the Mid-term Review.<br />
The Prime Minister paid tribute to President Reagan and Primne<br />
Minister Mulroney in particular, for pursuing agricultural<br />
trado reform so vigorously at the Summit.<br />
The Prime Ministar endorsed the view of leaders at the Summit<br />
that the GATT must be strengthened and its disciplines<br />
Improved.<br />
The Prime Minister welcomed the commitment of the leaders to<br />
strenqthen efforts to reduce the growth of spending in<br />
cour-stries wit~ h balance of payments deficits and to sustain it<br />
in countries with surpluses. The task for the incoming<br />
President will be to reflect that commitment In significant<br />
early cuts in the fiurjal deficit of the united States. 73 G 1 </p>
