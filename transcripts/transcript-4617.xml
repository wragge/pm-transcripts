CABINET I<br />
FOR PRESS 2 FEBRUARY 1978<br />
MAINLINE RAILWAY UPGRADING PROGRAMME<br />
The Prime' Minister, Mr Fraser, announced today that action was<br />
under way to implement the Government's policy undertaking<br />
to fund a programmne for the upgrading of Australia's mainline<br />
railways.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he had written to the Premiers of<br />
New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia<br />
inviting them to join in a Commonwealth/ State programme for<br />
upgrading their-Stite-ailways that are part of the national<br />
railway network.<br />
This assistance of about $ 70 million over 5 years, beginning<br />
1978/ 79,. was foreshadowed in the supplementary statements to the<br />
Policy Speech.<br />
At a meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council<br />
in December 1976 the Commonwealth asked the States to submit<br />
proposals for financial assistance.<br />
" The examination by the Government of the projects submitted<br />
supports the view that there are critical areas in railways<br />
operations where efficiency and the capacity of the railways<br />
systems as a whole will be greatly enhanced by stratcgic<br />
investment," Mr Fraser said.<br />
There will shortly be discussions between the Commonwealth<br />
Minister and State Transport Ministers on the'details of the offer. </p>
