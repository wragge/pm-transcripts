More than 3.5 million homes, businesses, schools and hospitals will have construction of the National Broadband Network either commenced or completed within the next three years, under a new fibre rollout plan announced today.</p>
<p>Across Australia, the numbers of homes, businesses, schools and hospitals that will see construction begin or be completed by mid 2015 are:</p>
<p> * 	1,010,700 in New South Wales<br />
 * 	691,600 in Victoria<br />
 * 	678,600 in Queensland<br />
 * 	429,200 in Western Australia.<br />
 * 	327,300 in South Australia<br />
 * 	135,300 in the ACT<br />
 * 	65,200 in the Northern Territory<br />
 * 	209,100 in Tasmania</p>
<p>Construction of the national fibre network rollout will begin between 1 April 2012 and 30 June 2015 in these locations, under NBN Co's indicative three year rollout plan.</p>
<p>Today's announcement provides certainty to Australians who have been waiting to hear when they will get access to this critical infrastructure. It also shows the NBN rollout is about to go into high gear.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, the internet is basic infrastructure - Australian families rely on it, and Australian businesses need it. It's become an essential utility - like electricity or water.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Australia's 100-year-old copper network is out of date and can't deliver the modern high speed broadband our economy needs.</p>
<p>We know that unless we upgrade to the NBN, our outdated system will choke Australia's economy in the future, slowing our growth and putting Australia behind the rest of the world.</p>
<p>We need the NBN to secure our economic future, which is why the Gillard Government is delivering high-speed, reliable broadband to every home and business in Australia.</p>
<p>The NBN will also transform service delivery and drive economic diversification for people living in regional Australia.</p>
<p>The NBN is one of the great enablers of the regions, for economic growth and diversification and service delivery.</p>
<p>It will ensure that every community around Australia gets fair and equal access to affordable high-speed broadband, including prices and services that are the same in the regions as they are in the city.</p>
<p>NBN Co released its first 12 month rollout schedule in October 2011. That schedule, updated for the first time in February 2012, continues to be updated quarterly.</p>
<p>The three year rollout plan will be updated each year.</p>
<p>A summary of NBN Co's three year indicative rollout schedule is available at Attachment A.</p>
<p>NBN Co has established an interactive searchable map on its website detailing the rollout, available at: <a href="http://www.nbnco.com.au/rollout/rollout-map.html">www.nbnco.com.au/rollout/rollout-map.html</a>.  </p>
