TRANSCRIPT OF THlE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J7 KERTING, MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, 14 MAY 1992, CANBERRA, WA ROYAL COMMISSION<br />
E Ot PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well thank you for coming. I have issued a statement<br />
to you today saying that recent statements by Mr<br />
Templeman, a Barrister servicing the West Australian<br />
Royal Commission, and todays statement by the West<br />
Australian Commission Chairman, Mr Kennedy, that the<br />
Commonwealth Government has impeded the ability of the<br />
Commission to obtain tax information. Both of those<br />
statements are incorrect.<br />
The Commonwealth Governent has been seriously and<br />
wilfully maligned on this issue. Now today I have<br />
received advice from the Commissioner of Taxation, or<br />
the Treasurer has, and he has passed it on to me, that<br />
a Western Australian Police Unit is working with the<br />
Royal Commission, and that this Unit is empowered to<br />
seek tax information from the Australian Tax Office.<br />
And that minute which you have in front of you with the<br />
number 4 at its top says, that en amendment to the act<br />
in 1989, Section 3( e) was inserted to the taxation<br />
amendmnent act to allow Controlled access for nominated<br />
law enforcement agencies to tax information. Provision<br />
authorises me, that's the Commissioner, to provide tax<br />
information if I am satisfied the information is<br />
relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has<br />
been, or is being committed. And he goes on to say<br />
over the page, " It's my understanding that the Western<br />
Australian Police have a Unit working with, and<br />
assisting the Royal Commission in that State. Section<br />
3 allows us to provide tax information to that Unit for<br />
the purpose of its investigation of a serious offence"<br />
" In other words, as to serious matters there is<br />
potential for us to assist the Royal Commission, says<br />
the Commissioner. This facility was explained by my<br />
office in Perth, to the Royal Commission staff erly in<br />
the process, and we would have supplied available<br />
information had the Police asked for it. In fact there<br />
have been no Police requests for information". He goes<br />
14 2 1 t-lo F </p>
<p>TEL: 14rl1 1a: iL4Ic ' 4<br />
2<br />
have been no Police requests for information". He goes<br />
on to say he understands hie Deputy Commissioner in<br />
Western Australia and his staff are maintaining close<br />
liaison with the Commission. And importantly in the<br />
last paragraph, last sentence he says, the<br />
Commissioner, Mr Boucher says " We stand ready to assist<br />
the Royal Commission by supplying information to its<br />
Police Unit, as authorised by Section Now the<br />
fact is that was explained to the Western Australian<br />
Royal Commission in February in 1991 and the Commission<br />
has not availed itself of the use of that provision.<br />
That provision was inserted after the Government agreed<br />
to give tax information to the Fitzgerald Royal<br />
Comnmision. Now what the West Australian Royal<br />
Commission sought, was not the power of information<br />
about of fences and the prosecution of of fences, or<br />
information on specific of fences, serious of fences, but<br />
a broader power to require of the Commissioner, that<br />
any information requested be provided to the Royal<br />
Commission. In other words, what the Commissioner calls a " fishing<br />
licence", that is, to be asking for information<br />
broadly. So any Western Australian, any Australian,<br />
associated with, in any way, with any person under<br />
investigation by the Commission can have their tax<br />
returns made available to the bevy of Queens<br />
Councillors and Commission staff, as the Commission so<br />
decides. And the . Commonwealth has always taken the<br />
view this is unwarranted invasion of the secrecy<br />
provision to the Tax Act and the privacy of<br />
Australians. And that for serious crime there were no<br />
practical impediments to the Commission seeking<br />
information. Now the Commissioner has made his position clear on<br />
that point. Again in the minute number 4 he says,<br />
" Again I indicated previously the type of access which<br />
the Fitzgerald Commission enjoyed was a wide one. It<br />
was to Information needed for the purposes of the<br />
inquiry, if and when the Royal Commissioner asked for<br />
tax files I was in no position to gain say his claim.<br />
That release of the information was authorised by the<br />
enabling provision". In other words, that is the broad<br />
form of the provision will allow requests of even a<br />
fishing kind.<br />
In other words, the great phalanx of Tax Lawyers and<br />
Barristers who fill up the first class compartments of<br />
Ansett and Australian, from Melbourne, to Sydney, to<br />
Perth every week and to go back with their brief cases<br />
bloated with papers, can go back bloated with the tax<br />
returns of West Australians and Australians generally.<br />
And the Government quite correctly said no to that, no<br />
to that. But we a1so said that we would facilitate<br />
Information. Now it Is not just simply a matter of me<br />
agreeing with a recommendation of the Commissioner, so<br />
to did Mr Willis for the same reasons. And the </p>
<p>TEL: 1 jr . C<br />
3<br />
Commissioner put his view again forcefully in the<br />
minute headed 2, which I have given to you. on my<br />
advice the Western Australian Commissions request for<br />
access was rejected, he told Mr Willis. And he went on<br />
to Say " I would like to reiterate my view that the<br />
confidentially of income tax information is important<br />
to the administration of the tax laws. I do not<br />
consider this position should be further eroded by<br />
giving access to the Western Australian Commission".<br />
And at the bottom he goes on to say, " I again recommend<br />
that the Government not support the Western Australian<br />
Commissions request for access to Income tax<br />
information". And he makes clear in ' the letter headed<br />
2, that the granting of access to information for the<br />
Gyles Royal Commission in NSW was also refused on the<br />
same basis.<br />
Now, can I just say a couple of other things about Mr<br />
Templemn and his remarks the day before yesterday.<br />
And I refer to the Transcript which I think we have<br />
included in the papers I have given you, It is the<br />
document headed 5. At the bottom of the page under<br />
exhibit 3147, about 1/ 3 down the page, at the last<br />
paragraph Mr Teinpieman says, " The Treasurer then<br />
referred to the existing law, and concluded by saying<br />
that in the present case any request for pacific<br />
assistance could be made In the context of an<br />
investigation, subsequent to the completion of the<br />
Royal Commission, provided the information sought<br />
relates to a particular offence by a specified person,<br />
and there in of course, with respect, lies the<br />
difficulty of identifying the particular offence or<br />
specifying a person at this stage of the inquiry.<br />
How could their be any difficulty at this stage of the<br />
inquiry? At this stage the inquiry's reaching Its<br />
final stages. And is Mr Templeman asserting that even<br />
after 210 days of sittings, 497 witnesses, 31,000 pages<br />
of transcripts, 3200 exhibits, a staff of 15 to 18 and<br />
6 senior counsel, at a cost so far of $ 16 million, that<br />
he couldn't even talk about a specified person, and<br />
there in of course with respect he said, or a<br />
particular offence or specifying a particular person at<br />
this stage of the inquiry. I mean, doesn't it strike<br />
you as strange that at this stage of the inquiry, that<br />
this Commission having run this period, can't put a<br />
request through its Police Unit to the Tax Commissioner<br />
for information about a specified offence, concerning a<br />
specified person. Because that's in fact, what is<br />
being said.<br />
Now as I said yesterday, I am not interested in the<br />
apologia, or excuses by highly paid Barristers,<br />
counsel, Servicing Commissions, in giving us some for<br />
taste, or portending, the progress of the Commission.<br />
I am interested only In the possibility of serious<br />
crimes being dealt with, and being dealt with in a<br />
conclusive way. </p>
<p>TEL: 14 11' F. CL<br />
4<br />
And I refer you in that respect to Mr Hartnell, who on<br />
3 may 1991, the AuStralian Financial Review, had this<br />
to say, he said he did not think very kindly of Royal<br />
Commissions at this time, " I am merely saying that the<br />
public has to understand every time you have a Royal<br />
Commission it delays trials. The Royal Commission are<br />
ensuring that the bloodlust doesn't come to early<br />
fruition. When there is an investigative force<br />
professionally set up to Investigate an agreement and<br />
charged with bringing actions under lawful<br />
investigations, I am frankly not in favour of Royal<br />
Commissions. At the present time obviously there are<br />
huge criminal actions being brought which we are<br />
bringing through the Office of the Crown Prosecutor in<br />
Western Australia". And he went on to say that certain<br />
trials could be deferred by up to two years because of<br />
the Western Australian Royal Commission. Now Mr<br />
Hartnell's Security Commission is one of the Parties<br />
provided with access to tax information, and I might<br />
add if you look again at minute 4, so is the NSW<br />
Independent Commission against Corruption and the NSW<br />
Crimes Commission.<br />
So those elements of the media who yesterday published<br />
or telecast Dr Hewson's mealy mouthed statement that<br />
the Government had acted in a preferential way, So as<br />
to protect so called " Labor Mates", might indicate to<br />
the public that a commission which was set up<br />
supposedly to investigate corruption under the former<br />
NSW Labor Government, was given access to the Tax<br />
Office explicitly by an Act of Parliament. So that<br />
should at least demolish that argument.<br />
Could I just make a couple of other points. In a note<br />
for file by an Australian Tax Commission officer on 19<br />
February 1991, he said this, I also outlined Section<br />
3( e) of the Tax Administration Act as a possible<br />
alternative means that the Commission could use to<br />
pursue access to ATO Information. However,<br />
reservations were expressed as to the many problems<br />
that could be encountered", wicks stated that they<br />
would not consider this option.<br />
Now this is a very high handed approach by Mr Wicks.<br />
When a tax officer explained that an avenue of tax<br />
information is available, they said well thank you for<br />
the explanation and the offer, but thank you, but no<br />
thanks. Thank you but no thanks. The Commissioner is<br />
again repeating the offer today in his minute to Mr<br />
Dawkin's where he says, the Tax Office stands ready to<br />
assist the Royal Commission by supplying information to<br />
its Police Unit as authorised under Section 3. And I<br />
refer you also to the introductory note for the<br />
legislation of Section 3( e) which says this: " broadly<br />
proposed Section 3( e) provides the Commissioner of<br />
Taxation with the discretion to disclose taxation<br />
information to an authorised law enforcement agency </p>
<p>T1E L a. 4rLia ' q 1-r 1. No C' 19 F-1 T<br />
officer. Such disclosure is conditional on the<br />
Commissioner being satisfied that the information Is<br />
relevant to the investigation of a serious Crime or<br />
post convictions, confiscation and restraining order<br />
proceedings. The information may be disclosed by the<br />
Commissioner either on his own initiative or in<br />
response to a request by a low enforcement agency<br />
officer," m and it goes on but they're the main points.<br />
" Such disclosures are conditional on the Commissioner<br />
being satisfied that the information Is relevant to the<br />
investigation or a serious offence". I should of<br />
thought the whole point of the investigations In<br />
Western Australia were the investigations of serious<br />
of fences.<br />
But if the notion is that the Commission only needed a<br />
fishing licence approach to the tax system, to call up<br />
tax files of all citizens in this country at the behest<br />
of the Commission or councils before the Commission and<br />
that the question of serious of fences was not an<br />
important consideration in that request by the<br />
Commission to the Government, but begs the question<br />
what does a Commission see as its purpose.<br />
I think I'll conclude on this point, the commissioner<br />
of Taxation has deemed Section 3( e) available to the<br />
Commission as an Investigation process or serious crime<br />
that's the bottom line.<br />
And I just want to make one final point, though not<br />
related to this but related to the debate a Mr Bevan<br />
Lawrence today on the radio program ' AM' criticised me,<br />
I want to brand Mr Lawrence as a hypocrite and I do so<br />
because he campaigned under a banner along St Georges'<br />
Terrace in Western Australia against the Australia Card<br />
on the base is it was incursion into the privacy of<br />
Australians and is now arguing that peoples tax files<br />
should flutter from the Tax Office at the request of a<br />
Royal Commission or its Council even though it may not<br />
be for a serious offence. Now that sort of hypocrisy<br />
and humbug, I think, we can all do without.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what do you think the priorities of the<br />
Royal Commission..<br />
Pm: I remind you again of these factors, Peter, the<br />
Commission sat for 210 days, its issued 859 summonses,<br />
and 497 witnesses have been called, its now taken<br />
31,000 pages of transcripts in its proceedings and<br />
3,200 exhibits, It has 6 senior council and 15-18 legal<br />
staff and its cost to date $ 16 million. You've got to<br />
ask the Western Australian Government what's Its<br />
purpose was in establishing the Commission because<br />
there's one thing that's entirely clear, in terms of at<br />
least some serious of fences committed in Western<br />
Australia or alleged serious of fences, the appropriate<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL 6<br />
prosecuting agencies already had prosecutions In hand<br />
as Mr Hartnell amongst others makes clear.<br />
J: Mr Keating, why was it justified even though the<br />
Fitzgerald..<br />
PM: Well, you'll notice in the minute which is at Number I<br />
that the Second Commissioner, Mr Nolan makes it Clear<br />
that the amendmients should be seen as a one-off<br />
relaxation of Section 16 because of the dividend in<br />
uncovering tax evasion, that is it does not establish a<br />
precedent for the disclosure of tax records. Now it<br />
turns out, I think, that the Tax Of fice was itself<br />
mounting prosecutions in this area independently of the<br />
work of this Commission and this Commission could have<br />
been seen to be helping in those prosecutions. In<br />
other words, there was a revenue dividend from it, but<br />
again that note which was written In 1987 made it quite<br />
clear that it does not seek to establish a precedent.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No but it's not convenience, the Tax Office has been<br />
given a charter by the Parliament to collect the<br />
revenue. I mean efficiency in the collection of<br />
revenue and costs and prosecutorial processes matter,<br />
it's part of the Commissioner's responsibilities to<br />
Parliament.<br />
3: Prime Minister, $ 500 million has disappeared from<br />
Rothwells it's a very serious Investigation, it<br />
goes to the very top of the list in Australian<br />
Government and indeed the Tax Office tried to make it<br />
out as asking for people to flutter bits of paper out<br />
the Tax office window.<br />
PM: if they are seeking a fishing licence that is for a<br />
broad ambit capacity to seek tax information of<br />
Australians, then that does not go to specific<br />
individuals or particular cases.<br />
3: You said for the purpose of the enquiry that it's the<br />
same criteria for the<br />
PM: No that's what you say, that's what you claim. No not<br />
at all, that's not correct. It is as the Commissioner<br />
says, he cannot gainsay. In other words, once you<br />
provide this you can't say, oh look you can have this<br />
and not that. It's a case of you can have what you've<br />
asked for.<br />
J: Do you regret the decision to grant Mr Fitzgerald a<br />
fishing licence?<br />
PM: I think, in the out-turn of it all, no and I didn't<br />
regret it then, but we made amendments subsequently<br />
which have been appropriate and which have obviously<br />
worked and we have similarly denied, as we have the<br />

West Australian Royal Commission, access to the Gyles<br />
Commission in NSW, but the agencies are there and the<br />
Police Units are attached to this Commission.<br />
Apparently the Commission doesn't which to use the<br />
Police Unit.<br />
Why didn't we know this yesterday?<br />
PM: Why didn't you?<br />
3: Yes.<br />
PM: Because one doesn't know what's been said in the course<br />
of the day or what one should be responding to.<br />
3: How do you respond to the request by the Premier of<br />
Western Australia to release information and the Deputy<br />
Speaker Ron Edwards?<br />
PM; I reject them, I reject those requests for the same<br />
reason that the Commission has recommended now to a<br />
succession of Treasurers that they reject the request<br />
to the Commission generally.<br />
3: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: There most be a vote of confidence by the Government in<br />
the secrecy provisions of the Tax Act. That<br />
Australians do have a right to privacy and that if<br />
Commissions which to pursue particular investigations<br />
with some specificity the avenues are available as a<br />
Commissioner of Research for those investigations to<br />
take place. But the notion that the tax office is<br />
going to be ripped open with a can opener, like a can<br />
with a can opener so that anybody can request<br />
information about any particular persons without the<br />
Commissioner having a discretion is, of course, not<br />
acceptable.<br />
J: Couldn't the Commissioner use his discretion, couldn't<br />
he just make sure that it's not a complete fishing<br />
exercise, so that the Commissioner can ensure that it<br />
applies in terms of reference?<br />
PM: The only way we believe that was possible, was-an<br />
amendment to the Act in relation to the Fitzgerald<br />
Commission and that amendment was made, but as the<br />
Commissioner said in the terms of that amendment he<br />
didn't believe he could gain say his claim that the<br />
release, that he could then make judgements.<br />
J: Couldn't he pass an amendment for this Commission to<br />
make it a little bit tighter than the Fitzgerald one so<br />
that the Commissioner could ensure that it was within<br />
the West Australians Terms of Reference?<br />
PM: I think the fact Is that the prosecuting agencies are<br />
established under legislation and one of those happens </p>
<p>TEL: 1-: 1 tN4C P l.<br />
to be the Western Australian Police Force and they are<br />
attached to the Commission.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you agree with Mr Hartnell that the<br />
Royal Commission is simply getting in the way of the<br />
real issue?<br />
PM: I'm not in Mr Hartnell's position and that's a<br />
judgement he has made. Royal Commissions hays produced<br />
findings of value but as to prosecutions I think that's<br />
a matter for judgement in Mr Hartnell's terms<br />
obviously.<br />
J; Mr Keating, the Commission has been prominent up<br />
until now in protecting these of fences and individuals<br />
and that the reason for them seeking this wider power<br />
Is because it has been incompetent up until now.<br />
PM: I don't think, if the implications of Mr Templeman's<br />
remarks are that after all this time and expense that<br />
he's trying to establish some apologia or foretelling<br />
the Commissions progress or its processes on the basis<br />
that a succession of Treasurers in the Commonwealth<br />
Government and the Tax Office have not allowed them tax<br />
information that in floating that notion, as I said<br />
yesterday, I think that is disingenuous.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well that was 8 conclusion I drew yesterday.<br />
3: Costigan and Fitzgerald proved that you have to follow<br />
the money trail and following the money trail has<br />
people showing income and that's the whole point.<br />
PM: The powers this Commission has enjoyed, its terms of<br />
reference and those who've been brought before it are<br />
very, very extensive.<br />
J: Mr Keating, with the nature of this advice from the Tax<br />
Office was pressure put on the Tax Office in the<br />
Fitzgerald case which was commenting obviously<br />
fairly late in the piece on the proposal the next<br />
day by the Attorney-General looks as though it would be<br />
more reluctantly whereas the later advice is much<br />
more robust.<br />
PM: If you look at the minute it says, ' we retain our<br />
concern that the widespread availability of taxation<br />
information for non-tax purposes may lead to a reading<br />
down of our information gathering and access powers by<br />
the judiciary'.<br />
J; In other words, is it going along with government<br />
reluctantly for good reasons.<br />
PM: No, I think it recommended this advice, this is a note<br />
to me I was then Treasurer, from Mr Nolan </p>
<p>TiE. L r1. i.; 21~ 1RNo Ci F I-1'<br />
9<br />
3: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: The Tax Office has never been full bloodedly accepting<br />
of the notion that its resources should be available to<br />
all law enforcement agencies or Royal Commissions.<br />
3: What about the case of Fitzgerald?<br />
PM: No, because in Fitzgerald's case, I think, for the<br />
reasons they say in the minute, they saw sufficient<br />
reason to agree.<br />
3: Surely, there is much more money available from<br />
potential tax evasion from this Commission than the<br />
Fitzgerald Commission, I mean that's more time compared<br />
to the West Australian Commission.<br />
PM: Is that a qualitative judgement by you?<br />
J: .0 projection of revenue issues involved with WA shows<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PM: There may well be, but I'm not aware of them.<br />
3: Surely that's a very relevant piece of policy because<br />
that was a key turning point in criteria on which you<br />
madees<br />
PM: It was a turning point, but since then we've had those<br />
amendments. That's what I'm saying to you in Section<br />
3( s).<br />
J: 3( e) is useful if you are positive this is en<br />
investigative thing prosecuting agency, WA Royal<br />
Commission is not a prosecution..<br />
PM: No you don't. For a start it's got it's own<br />
investigative powers,. its power to call witnesses and<br />
to question to them and they have been extensive have<br />
they not? And beyond that If they are focussing, where<br />
Mr Templeman talks about a number of players in Western<br />
Australia, surely they are not that extensive the<br />
numbers of players that they can't In specific terms<br />
ask the Australian Tax office through their Police Unit<br />
for assistance and advice.<br />
3; Does the saying about a stringent protections of the<br />
privacy imply to Royal Commissions set up by the<br />
Commonwealth Government as implied to ones set up under<br />
the States?<br />
PM: I think it depends upon the letters patent and the<br />
terms.<br />
3: Mr Keating, inaudible At what stage does it<br />
have to get before it can actually require from the Tax<br />
office specific information, does it have to have a<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 1 a~ . r 1 .1:<br />
specific charge in front of it? In other words from<br />
the Royal Commission?<br />
PM: No, it's got to be relating to an offence which Is<br />
serious.<br />
J: How do you establish the offence?<br />
PM: It's described in the legislation it Says anld I'll find<br />
it " it can be punished by imprisonment of up to 12<br />
months or more".<br />
J: MY point is who establishes the offence, does the Royal<br />
Comm~ ission have to establish the offence before the<br />
enforcement agency can ask for Tax Office information?<br />
PM: It's a matter of the qualitative thing whether it's<br />
serious or not.<br />
J: Well is an alleged offence, possible offence or<br />
whatever<br />
PM: obviously where the consequences of the offence are<br />
serious and if they're not serious one would wonder why<br />
they would want information.<br />
J: What's the onus of proof, who establishes that it is a<br />
serious offence?<br />
PM: I think that would be fairly apparent, would it not,<br />
from both the police agency and the Deputy Commissioner<br />
of Taxation.<br />
J: Doesn't that extra situation apply. If the<br />
Commissioner suspects something but can't prove the<br />
PM: Yes, but this is on the notion that you think an<br />
offence is only visible within the information provided<br />
on the Australian Tax Office's computers. This<br />
Commission has been able to follow the transactions at<br />
their source legally and by inquisitorial process of<br />
witnesses.<br />
J: Mr Keating have you met Greg Symons?<br />
PM: I'm not here to discuss the Symons issue, Senator<br />
Richardson or any matters associated with it. I've got<br />
a report coming from Senator Richardson and Senator<br />
Sibra and I'll deal with that when I receive it.<br />
That's it, have you got any more questions on the<br />
Commission?<br />
J: WA Inc inquiry may not be used to capacity. The<br />
minute says there is a friction between the Police Unit<br />
and others associated with the Commission as some have<br />
suggested, who suggested that? </p>
<p>TEL: I4 i: C~<br />
PM: Well I'm reasonably, reliably informed that there Is<br />
some antipathy between the Police Unit and the other<br />
bureaucrats in the Commission.<br />
3: Mr Keating, I sorry I'm still not clear on the answer<br />
to Glenn's question. Can you give us some more<br />
information please on the question of how far the<br />
allegations go before it's able to..<br />
PM: It has to be, I think, demonstrably an allegation that<br />
there is a demonstrable serious offence.<br />
J: There only has to be a reasonable allegation?<br />
PM; Absolutely.<br />
3: Mr Keating, how much damage will your refusal of Carmen<br />
Lawrence's approach today do her politically and to<br />
Labor?<br />
PM: Frankly, with all due respect to Premier Lawrence and<br />
anybody else, politicians asking plaintively by press<br />
release for broad access to the Tax Office and its<br />
resources are not to be taken seriously by the<br />
Commonwealth.<br />
J: Should her promise then to the West Australian people<br />
not to leave a stone unturned when the Commission began<br />
also hold as much weight as that then?<br />
PM: I think in terms of the serious underlying issues<br />
involved there, I think that that promise can be made<br />
good and it's important that It is.<br />
J: With this friction between the Police Unit and the<br />
Commission is stopping the Police Unit<br />
PM: Well that's part of your occupation, why don't you try<br />
and find out. These are the things which journalists<br />
should enquiry about.<br />
3: Mr Keating, are you entirely satisfied form of<br />
bankrupt.<br />
PM: I told you I'm not answering, Tom don't play silly<br />
games with me, I'm not answering questions on it. Have<br />
