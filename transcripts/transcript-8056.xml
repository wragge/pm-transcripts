TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH VINCENT SMITH, RADIO<br />
9 JULY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
VSt Good morning PM.<br />
PM: Good day Vincent.<br />
VS: How are you.<br />
PMs I'm well mate. Most importantly how are you feeling<br />
yourself? VS: I'm feeling terrific thank you.<br />
PM: I'm glad to hear that and all our thoughts are with you<br />
here. And when I say that I mean not only Mine but the people in<br />
my press office and anyone who knows you, all our thoughts are<br />
with you mate.<br />
VS: It's great tolAl'ack and thank you very much for that letter<br />
you wrote, you were one of the first letters that arrived at the<br />
hospital when I first fell ill.<br />
PM: Always had a soft spot for you mate.<br />
VS: It was very kind of you. Hey, how are things going, you're<br />
stirring things up a bit aren't you?<br />
PM: Oh, well I was born with not a spoon in my mouth but a spade<br />
in my hand, you know, for stirring.<br />
VS: Yeah, well you've certainly done it. I mean coming up<br />
tomorrow will be today equals, tomorrow you will have broken<br />
Malcolm Fraser's record as the second longest serving PM in Aust.<br />
PM: Yes I'm and may I take this opportunity of thanking that<br />
part of the Aust population that listens to you, and it's fairly<br />
substantial, for the support I've had over the years; if not<br />
always their vote, I've always felt that I've got a fair go from<br />
the Australian people which has made this period very challenging<br />
and enjoyable.<br />
VS: You've sort of marked it by putting privatisation back on<br />
the agenda though. </p>
<p>PM4 I haven't used that ugly word. But I've simply said to the<br />
party that they have to face up to a simple question. There are<br />
not unlimited resources available to govt and there are certain<br />
things that only govt can and will do; that's in the area of<br />
education, health, welfare for the needy. The private sector<br />
never will and never can be expected to do those things, govt has<br />
got to do those, and yet we have this tendency to believe that we<br />
can waste our resources by doing things that can be just as well<br />
done by the private sect r, like running airlines. So as I say,<br />
I'm not trying to dry ulIc h the party, I operate within the<br />
processes of the party, but I'm really saying that we've got to<br />
face up to these thinfs I mean it's a little bit strangeI<br />
think that Aust is just about the last place where a political<br />
party believes that there is some particular virtue in the govt<br />
owning and running particular enterprises. There is a case,<br />
Vincent, for the govt running things where it can't be done in<br />
S the interests of the people by the private sector but airlines I<br />
think is not one of them.<br />
VS: Although there is an argument from your opponents on this<br />
view that it would be actually cheaper for the govt to run the<br />
airlines in net terms.<br />
PM: That's a nonsense in my opinion. But I don't want to run<br />
the argument publicly. I mean I'm simply saying to my friends<br />
and colleagues in the party that the thing, that within the<br />
party, we've got to sit down and talk through with one another.<br />
I don't want to really conduct the debate in any detail in the<br />
public arena, I am simply putting on notice that we've got to<br />
talk it through pretty astringently.<br />
VS: I noticed in the last 2,000 odd days you thought that<br />
perhaps the lowest point was your statement on no child living in<br />
poverty, what do you think was the highest point.<br />
S PM: On that what I was saying there, why it was a low point<br />
for me was that one of the great achievements of the period has<br />
been the delivery of the govt's promise on what we were<br />
specifically saying, and that is that we would make the finance<br />
available to low income families so that there would be no<br />
financial need within families for kids to live in poverty and of<br />
course all the welfare organisations have said that we've<br />
delivered on that promise of which means in this last year<br />
we've paid out over two billion dollars in assistance, more than<br />
ever been done before and welfare organisations are saying not<br />
matched anywhere else. What upset me is that the magnitude of<br />
that achievement has tended to be clouded and lost by the fact<br />
that in the shorthand version of the speech that that wasn't<br />
spelt out in the detail it was in the accompanying document. </p>
<p>VS: Do you think Brian Burdekin was being unf air at the end of<br />
last week when he said that the States really haven't done enough<br />
towards looking after homeless children after his RC's report.<br />
PM Well there's always more that can be done, there's no doubt<br />
about that. We made a very large sum of money available after<br />
the Burdekin report to the States to assist in the provision of<br />
more facilities for homeless children. But what we've got to do<br />
now is, having made the financial steps that we ' ye taken and<br />
which the welfare community recognises as having met the<br />
financial targets that I Bet, what we've got to do now in<br />
combination with the state govts and the welfare organisations is<br />
to ensure that services are actually delivered in the most<br />
efficient way and that's where part of the problem is.<br />
VS: Okay, can I come back to that last question very quickly<br />
S because I know you've got to go, the high point of the last 2,000<br />
odd days?<br />
PM: Well it is very hard to pick one high point, some of them<br />
are public, some of them are private. If I can take the private<br />
one, a very touching letter I got the other day in regard to this<br />
child poverty thing, when a lady wrote to me and said that she<br />
was annoyed by all this nonsense that was being talked about not<br />
having met the promise. She said that in her case what we'd done<br />
had just transformed their lives, they were a very low income<br />
family and with a number of kids, and that what we had done in<br />
delivering on what I'd said, had changed their life completely<br />
and changed the life of their children. Those sorts of things<br />
are high points for you, they come in private correspondence from<br />
people who have been helped by your decisions. Publicly, I don't<br />
know, I guess in a way, I've got to go back almost to the<br />
beginning and say something that happened there has been a<br />
continuing part of the great satisfaction of this period in govt,<br />
and that was summit in April of 1983 when I just can't describe<br />
S to you the pleasure in seeing captains of industry and trade<br />
union leaders talking with one another and coming up to me and<br />
saying, from both sides you know, we never really talked before,<br />
we never really understood one another's point of view, but we've<br />
now got a better idea of what the other's about. That was a high<br />
point then but it really has continued to be in the sense that I<br />
think now at the end of this period I can look back and say that<br />
we've got a-more co-operative Australia than the one I inherited<br />
in 1983 and that in a sense makes me feel happier than anything<br />
else; that while we still have arguments, of course there will<br />
always be in a democracy some differences, we've enormously cut<br />
down on the number of industrial disputes, a sixty per cent<br />
reduction in industrial disputes, and we're changing now in<br />
industry, work practices and management practices, so that<br />
there's a greater degree of co-operation. That sort of thing<br />
coming from the summit of ' 83 and continuing right through till<br />
now is probably what gives me the greatest satisfaction. I think<br />
Australians, if r can put it simply, Vincent, I think Australians<br />
like one another more now than they did when I became PM. </p>
<p>4 VSs Well that was a keynote of your campaign in ' 83 and even<br />
before you entered Parliament in fact. And Malcolm Fraser<br />
recognised that yesterday too.<br />
PM: Yes, he and others were very generous in their comments, I<br />
thank them for it.<br />
VS: PM wonderful to talk to you, thank you very much for your<br />
kind thoughts<br />
PM: Vincent, can I just say to you, fight the good fight and<br />
know that you've got all the best wishes of people all around<br />
Australia with you mate.<br />
VS: Thank you very much PM, good to talk with you. </p>
