I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE PRESENT ON THE OCCASION OF THE<br />
. SIGNING OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL<br />
CORPORATION AND THE CHINESE MINISTRY OF TEXTILE INDUSTRY.<br />
I CONGRATULATE THE TWO ORGANISATIONS ON THIS SIGNIFICANT<br />
STEP THEY HAVE TAKEN TOWARDS BUILDING A WAREHOUSE IN NANJING<br />
FOR THE HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN WOOL.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST AND MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCER<br />
OF FINE QUALITY WOOL. IN CHINA THE TERM " AO MAO" ( AUSTRALIAN<br />
WOOL) IS SYNONYMOUS WITH EXCELLENC* EAND AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN A<br />
LONG AND RELIABLE SUPPLIER OF WOOL TO CHINA'S TEXTILE INDUSTRY.<br />
CHINA ' S PRODUC TION OF TEXTILES ALSO HAS A LONG AND OUTSTANDING<br />
TRADITION. HERE IN NANJING WE ARE IN THE CENTRE OF A<br />
DISTRICT WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCING SLL. K TEXTILES FOR OVER A<br />
THOUSAND YEARS. IN RECENT YEARS WE NOTE THAT JIANGSU PROVINCE<br />
HAS BECOME THE MOST RAPIDLY GROWING. CENTRE OF CHINA'S TEXTILE<br />
INDUSTRY. CHINA'S COTTON AND OTHER TEXTILES AND GARMENTS<br />
ARE LEADING EXPORTS To AUSTRALIA AND TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT ON WOOL WAREHOUSE PROJECT<br />
NANJING, 22 MAY 1986 p. I. r </p>
<p>2.<br />
WE LOOK FORWARD TO DEVELOPING CO-OPERATION WITH CHINA TO<br />
EXPAND PRODUCTION OF WOOLLEN TEXTILES FOR CHINA'S OWN<br />
MARKET AND FOR EXPORT AROUND THE WORLD. SUCH CO-OPERATION<br />
IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT THE TWO GOVERNMENTS, IN<br />
CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION, HAVEV<br />
AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH THIS<br />
WOOL WAREHOUSE IN CHINA FOR AUSTRALIAN WOOL. THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
WOOL CORPORATION HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN THE BUILDING<br />
AND MANAGEMENT OF WOOL WAREHOUSING, ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THIS<br />
PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT THE WAREHOUSE INCORPORATES STATE<br />
OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINERY.<br />
I RECALL THAT DURING THE VISIT To AUSTRALIA OF GENERALSECRETARY<br />
Hu YAOBANG LAST YEAR, HE AND I DISCUSSED THE<br />
DESIRABILITY OF MORE CONCENTRATED EFFORTS TO PROMOTE<br />
CO-OPERATION IN THE WOOL INDUSTRY. IT IS GRATIFYING TO NOTE<br />
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING<br />
A FIVE-FOLD INCREASE, IN AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR TERMS, IN<br />
WOOL EXPORTS IN THE PERIOD 1984/ 85<br />
THREE JOINT.-VENTURE ENTERPRISES IN WOOLLEN TEXTILES,<br />
ALL OF THEM EXPORTING PRODUCTS TO THIRD COUNTRY MARKETS<br />
MORE JOINT VENTURES UNDER DISCUSSION </p>
<p>THE AGREEMENT SIGNED IN AUGUST LAST YEAR UNDER WHICH<br />
BOTH COUNTRIES ARE STUDYING WAYS TO DEVELOP TRADE AND<br />
ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION IN ALL AREAS RELATING TO THE WOOL<br />
INDUSTRY<br />
AND NOW WE HAVE TODAY'S PROGRESS ON THE WOOL WAREHOUSE.<br />
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE VISIT<br />
TO AUSTRALIA NEXT MONTH BY VICE MINISTER HE ZHENG ZHANG FOR<br />
THE FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING OF THE JOINT-WORKING GROUP ON WOOL,<br />
IT IS THEREFORE MOST PLEASING TO BE PRESENT IN CHINA TO<br />
WITNESS THE FIRST FRUITS OF THE PROPOSAL FOR CLOSER<br />
CO-OPERATION IN THIS FIELD WHICH GENERAL-SECRETARY HU AND<br />
I DISCUSSED LAST YEAR, I WOULD LIKE PERSONALLY TO<br />
CONGRATULATE ALL THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED TO ACHIEVE THIS<br />
RESULT, </p>
