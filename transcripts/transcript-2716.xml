FOR PRESS: PM. NO. 101/ 1972<br />
HOME PAYMENZ~ ASSISTANCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
Mcl~ ahon. C. H., M. P.<br />
The Government has given the closest consideration<br />
to the scheme for tax deductions on housing loans interest, which<br />
the Labor Party has announced and rejected it as unworkable. It<br />
is against the interests of young married people.<br />
Administratively, it is complicated and, if tried,<br />
would have to be abandoned.<br />
The Labor Party's claims that the scheme is superior to<br />
the Government's proposals are false.<br />
The Government's scheme gives the better benefit to a<br />
majority of home owners, particularly those with incomes not<br />
above average earnings who represent more than 70 per cent of home<br />
owners. We offer a straight.-out subsidy a cheque from the<br />
Government for up to $ 250 the first year to help meet interest on<br />
housing loans. It reduces by $ 250 a year in each succeeding year<br />
and is not taxable.<br />
Those eligible must be 35 years or under, building or<br />
buying their own home and living in it.<br />
The grant will also be paid in full to married couples<br />
where only one is under 36 but both are liable for interest and<br />
jointly own the house. It will be paid to the eligible partner.<br />
It is better because it gives a greater benefit to more<br />
young married people in the first three years, which is when they<br />
need it most. U~ nder the Labor scheme, the family man with children<br />
is nenalised. Th~ e larger the family, the greater the penalty. I<br />
give you a few examples. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Under the Labor scheme, a man earning $ 4,000 a year would<br />
be paying $ 800 interest on an average loan.<br />
If unmarried or without dependants, his tax reduction<br />
would be $ 205. If he had a wife and three children, all he would get<br />
would be $ 155. If on $ 5,000, he would pay $ 1,000 in interest and get a<br />
tax reduction of $ 279 if he was without dependants.<br />
If he had a wife only, he would get $ 263. If he had a<br />
wife and two children, he would get $ 237 and if he had a wife and<br />
three children, $ 1225 a figure below the Government's first year<br />
grant. This makes it crystal clear that the married man with<br />
a family is the one penalised.<br />
One other point of important difference is the fact that<br />
under the Governmc-nt* s scheme, young married people will know<br />
precisely what their benefit would be.<br />
Under the Labor scheme, it would go in their tax return<br />
as a deduction and they would not know clearly and quickly what<br />
benefit they were getting.<br />
The Labor scheme will give a big concession to a single<br />
taxpayer who may or may not intend to marry.<br />
fir Whitlam said quite clearly in his Policy Speech that<br />
" all taxpayers whose actual income i~ s $, 4,000 or below will be<br />
eH" Et-' tlcd to deduct 100 per cent of their interest rate payments" s.<br />
This makes the single taxpayer eligible along with young<br />
married people. It gives him a golden opportunity to speculate in home<br />
building and buying at the expense of the Government.<br />
It should be remembered also that on August 9 this year,<br />
the ALP's spokesman on housing ( Mr Uren) said he did not accept that<br />
interest on housing loans should be tax deductible as this<br />
assisted the wealthy rather than the poor.<br />
How right he is. That is precisely what the Labor<br />
stq-iemc would do.<br />
Labor claims that its total benefit on a 25 year loan<br />
would be $ 4,000. But the fact is that a majority of home owners are paying<br />
off their loans in 10 to 12 years because of rising in~ comes.<br />
The claim that Labor's cash benefit over a 10 year period<br />
would be twice that of the Government's scheme is also false. / 3 </p>
<p>Labor is quoting figures which are not related to housing<br />
loan activity as it exists nor does the Labor scheme concentrate<br />
its maximum benefit in the early stages of repayments when the need<br />
is greatest. Furthermore, the Government scheme is not dependant on<br />
the movement in incomes of home purchasers or of changes in tax<br />
rates. It has substance throughout whereas the Labor scheme is<br />
full of shadows.<br />
