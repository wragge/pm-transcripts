TRANSCRIPT OF ' NEWS CONFERENCE, BURSWOOD HOTEL, PERT,<br />
28 NOVMBER 1990<br />
9 s0 9-PROO: F ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, with regard to the election<br />
Of John Major, the Prime Minister-elect of Great Britain,<br />
what's your response to that?<br />
PM* Well I can't speak from any great knowledge of John<br />
Major. I did have the opportunity of meeting him at the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malaysia last<br />
Year and he is obviously a man of considerable ability.<br />
I have already written to him and congratulated him,<br />
wishing him well because Australia has a very<br />
considerable interest in who is leading and the nature of<br />
their leadership in Britain because Margaret Thatcher,<br />
with whom of course I had some arguments on South Africa,<br />
but she was a very great supporter of British-Australian<br />
relationships 4nd particularly she was a great friend to<br />
Australia in terms of her attack upon the common<br />
agricultural policy in the European Community. I'm<br />
certainly hoping that Mr Major will continue that very<br />
strong support.,<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think you'd get on better with Mr<br />
Major than Margaret Thatcher?<br />
PM: In regard to Margaret Thatcher, we had our arguments<br />
and they were pretty considerable, robust arguments in<br />
regard to South Africa. But apart from that, we were<br />
able to cooperate on a large number of matters within the<br />
Commonwealth and as I say, particularly in regard to<br />
developments in Europe she was at one with us in wanting<br />
to see a very considerable modification of the common<br />
agricultural policy. We couldn't have had a better<br />
supporter in Europe on that matter than we had in<br />
Margaret Thatcher.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Morgan Poll has you down 33%, your<br />
lowest ever. XE know it's a long way to the next election<br />
but how do you feel about that?<br />
PM: Well I am feeling quite composed about it. As you<br />
say rightly, it:' s a long way to the last election, I've<br />
just won my fourth one and by the time we go to the next<br />
we'll be ready to win that.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about your own leadership, Mr Hawke?<br />
There's speculation still running. What are you going to<br />
do? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: I'm going to do absolutely nothing. I mean as<br />
Graham Richardson rightly put it, he said his dog wakes<br />
up in the morning at times and barks for no reason at<br />
all. It's a quiet inter-Parliamentary period and a few<br />
of the people in the Gallery have got nothing better to<br />
do. It has no basis.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr Major was the Treasurer who<br />
became Prime Minister. Does that forebode anything for<br />
Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Oh, my God. You see what I mean about, you know,<br />
the media? Mr Major warn the Treasurer, he has become<br />
Prime Minister, does that mean anything for Mr Keating?<br />
That's a measure of the quality of the discussion on this<br />
Issue. JOURNALIST: With regard to the next election, you said<br />
you were going to lead the Labor Party into the next<br />
election but not the next one after that.<br />
PH: Well I wouldn't think so. I mean there comes a time<br />
when you have to say well that's it. Now I have In<br />
saying that this morning I said nothing new, nothing<br />
different. I've said that on several occasions before.<br />
JOURNALIST: Some time after the next election you'll be<br />
pulling the pin?<br />
P34: I think that would be right. I think that would be<br />
close. JOURNALIST: Are you confident on Antarctica, Sir?<br />
PM: Well I think the best way of putting it Is that I'm<br />
extremely hopeful. Let's analyse this. When I took the<br />
initiative on this a year ago not only within my own<br />
Government did I have cynics and sceptics but<br />
internationally they said you've got no chance. Now that<br />
was almost a universal view. But there has been a<br />
massive change as I expected there would be because I<br />
don't think people generally have understood the force of<br />
movement around the world on global environmental issues<br />
and the Antarctic is an environmentally important thing<br />
from an international point of view. Now governments<br />
have been subject to pressures not only from other<br />
governments like my own and the French Government have<br />
been pushing thi. s case, but substantial environmental<br />
interests in all the countries around the world have also<br />
been saying to governments that the Australian initiative<br />
Is something that ought to be supported. Now I'm hopeful<br />
therefore that Chile will see the first steps towards the<br />
achievement of the position which will ensure that there<br />
will never be mining in the Antarctic.<br />
JOURNALIST: And if the initiative doesn't get up? </p>
<p>PM: You ought to know me by now. I don't sort of answer<br />
these hypotheticals if it doesn't get up. I think it<br />
will. Whether you get it In its totality is one step,<br />
I'm not sure but I think now that there is a very, very<br />
considerable body of opinion that there ought to be at<br />
least a finite ban on mining in the Antarctic and we'll<br />
got that, at leasnt, for the first step and I think that<br />
then the move towards a permanent ban is the next step.<br />
JOURNALIST: In foreshadowing an expansion of the marine<br />
reserve system around Australia, what areas do you have<br />
in mind?<br />
PM4: Well this is something that we've just been thinking<br />
about and we haven't made any pre-emptive decisions about<br />
it because as you will appreciate by definition this is<br />
something which involves very much Cooperation with the<br />
States and we're just flagging that we think that this is<br />
something we ought to move to. Now what we'll be talking<br />
about with the State. is what they think about it and<br />
I think we're fortunate in having a model, I think, in<br />
the Great Barrier Reef arrangement that we have with<br />
Oueensland. Sc' those discussions will commence very<br />
shortly with the States.<br />
JOURNALIST: Cape Yfork space base is back in the news<br />
this morning. I wonder can the environmentalists be<br />
absolutely assured that the joint land use study will be<br />
started and finished before any decision on whether to<br />
allow that<br />
PM: We won't be making any decisions in regard to Cape<br />
York without having the benefit of the advice and the<br />
work that comes out of that land use study.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you envisage that under this national<br />
network of marine parks, should it come to that between<br />
the Government and the States, that it will eventually<br />
get world heritage listing for those parks?<br />
PM: Well that's something that could be a logical step.<br />
But let's take it stage by stage. You'll appreciate that<br />
what I've initiated in Australia just very recently is, I<br />
think, a new era in Commonwealth/ State relations and this<br />
is something which Is very much involving the cooperation<br />
with the States and the decisions that we will make will<br />
not just be the decision of the Commonwealth but<br />
decisions taken in cooperation with the States. If<br />
that's the sort of way they want to move with us well<br />
then that's I think you ought to know it.<br />
JOURNALIST: The reports this morning that the Labor<br />
Party is moving to distance itself from the union<br />
movement, how do feel about that?<br />
PM: I feel about that like I feel about most reports in<br />
the media on things like this. I don't take them<br />
terribly seriously. The relationship between the Labor </p>
<p>4<br />
Party and the unhions is one which is nlow of a century's<br />
duration. During that period there have been different<br />
strease and strains but the relationship's endured and<br />
in the period of my Government of course the relationship<br />
with the trade union movement, reflected particularly in<br />
the accord, has been one of very close cooperation. Now<br />
We've shown an adaptability of the things that need to<br />
change in the relationship, well they will come but It<br />
will come as a result of serious discussion between the<br />
two parts of the labour movement. We've shown a great<br />
adaptability and capacity for considering how we should<br />
best develop the relationship in changing times. I mean<br />
you look at the accord, we've adapted that quite<br />
remarkably and I think that's the way we work.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: This is you know, there's an old Let's make it<br />
clear what the Prime Minister has said. I've said<br />
nothing more on this than that the technical definition<br />
of a recession by the economists, God bless their hearts,<br />
in that if you have two successive quarters of negative<br />
growth then that is technically a recession. That could<br />
emerge out of the figures tomorrow. But I've also said<br />
the word recession doesn't I mean I'm not running away<br />
from the word. Obviously there has been a lowered level<br />
of activity and there's been pain in the community. But<br />
what I'm saying and I'll repeat here is that the economy<br />
will go into, I think, considerable recovery in 1991 and<br />
an you will have seen from today's Press, there is very<br />
confirmatory evidence of that in the business Investment<br />
expenditure. So yes, the figures could show that<br />
tomorrow but the important thing is have we got the<br />
essential elements of economic policy which is going to<br />
ensure firstly, that we have recovery and that It's<br />
sustainable and is it a policy which means that we're<br />
tackling the fundamental issues of inflation and the<br />
current account deficit? All the evidence shows that we<br />
are. If you look at inflation first, let's make the<br />
point that all Australians should be very, very proud of<br />
now and take great comfort from and that is that w'ye<br />
got a significant downward movement in our inflation rate<br />
an against what's happening in most of the rest of the<br />
world with inflation going up so that that gap which has<br />
been large in the past is significantly narrowing.<br />
That's good for the future of this country and we'll be<br />
able to cement that position to a very considerable<br />
extent because of the latest wage/ tax deal. Arnd<br />
secondly, in regard to the current account situation,<br />
we're obviously improving there. What we've got to do as<br />
a community is to make sure that we keep having larger<br />
increases in production than we do in consumption.<br />
That's the essence of the challenge.<br />
JOURNALIST: Bob Hogg said last night that Mr Keating<br />
should clarify his leadership intentions. Do you have<br />
any comment on that? </p>
<p>Vr PM: No. Paul and I are very relaxed about this<br />
situation. I wish everyone was as relaxed as we are.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks, a homegrown issue. The principle<br />
of the State Government giving a land endowment to a<br />
private university. Do you see any dangers there?<br />
PM: I see the headlines in today's West Australian. I<br />
Mean I would like not to get into comments on particular<br />
issues if I'm riot across them. I've done no more than<br />
read quickly the story on the front of the West<br />
Australian. I would want to have discussions with<br />
Western Australia and with my Minister on this before I<br />
made any comment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on a similar subject. Mining in<br />
national parks State Government. Do you find that<br />
some sort of an embarrassment today?<br />
PM: Not an embarrassment. Again, I've had a letter on<br />
that from Premier Lawrence and it's been pointed out that<br />
what's been dorte is that in allowing prospecting and the<br />
Possible move t~ o mining in three of the sixty of the<br />
national parks fifty seven are not affected and that<br />
there would only be a decision which would actually allow<br />
mining after a consideration by the Parliament and if it<br />
got to that point then those particular areas would be<br />
excised from the national parks. This is a decision<br />
which the Government has taken here in the light of their<br />
consideration of all the issues. It seems to have been<br />
one which has been carefully taken and which will ensure,<br />
as I say, that overwhelming national parks will<br />
remain free from mining.<br />
