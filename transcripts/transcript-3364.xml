SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE N. S. W. AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY COUNCIL, SYDNEY, SUNDAY<br />
AUGUST 1974<br />
Just three months ago the people of Australia returned a<br />
Labor Government for a further three years. We achieved success<br />
very largely because the people of New South Wales refused to be<br />
moved by the fear tactics of our opponents and the smear tactics<br />
of Sir Robert Askin. They gave us a resounding vote in the<br />
Senate and carried all four of our referendums. And a month agoin<br />
Coogee and in Goulburn they took the opportunity to reply<br />
direct to Sir Robert Askin and his administration. With the win<br />
in Coogee we have taken another step towards a Labor Government in<br />
New South Wales, a Labor Government under Neville Wran.<br />
I take this first opportunity to congratulate the New South<br />
Wales Branch, to congratulate Neville Wran, to congratulate and to<br />
thank all of you, my colleagues in the national Parliament, the<br />
officers and above all the rank and file members for your work,<br />
your support and your achievements over the past three years and<br />
particularly the past three months.<br />
Now, three months after our work together led to'the<br />
reaffirmation by the people of New South Wales and the people of<br />
Australia of Labor's right to govern, it is fitting that here,<br />
at the State Council of the Party, I should repeat what I said<br />
to the nation shortly after those elections. I said:<br />
" There should be no uncertainty in any<br />
quarter about our ability and determination<br />
to carry out our program and to provide<br />
strong effective government for the full<br />
term for which you have once again elected us."<br />
Now just three months after the people delivered their<br />
verdict, delivered it in our favour for a second time in 18 months,<br />
our adversaries inside Parliament and beyond it seek every means<br />
to set that verdict aside. To them it is nothing that the people<br />
have twice returned a verdict in our favour. To them it is nothing<br />
that the people have declared themselves, as firmly as our electoral<br />
system allows, on issue after issue issues of tremendous importance<br />
like the people's health, like Australian ownership of Australian<br />
resources, like restrictive trade practices, like electoral reform.<br />
To them it is nothing that their own nominal leaders have committed<br />
themselves to support our proposals as Mr. Snedden and Mr. Anthony<br />
emphatically did in the case of our amended legislation for the<br />
Australian Industry Development Corporation, and as Mr. Snedden<br />
did on the proposal to establish an Australian Superior Court more<br />
than seven years ago when he himself was Attorney-General. They<br />
rejected our universal Health Scheme put to the people at the<br />
elections of 1969, 1972 and 1974. Now that the joint sitting has<br />
passed the Health Bills, they propose to reject the co]. latere. J<br />
legislation needed to give effect to the scheme. / 2 </p>
<p>7<br />
-2-<br />
The extraordinary thing, the intolerable thing, is that the<br />
opposition Senators have become more obstructive, not less, more<br />
bloody-minded, more irrational since the elections which they<br />
themselves precipitated. In the session just completed they have<br />
held up by outright rejection or postponement or by dragging out<br />
debate, more than half of our Bills 30 out of 56.<br />
This happens in a Senate in which our own strength was<br />
increased from 26 to 29, a Senate happily devoid of DLP<br />
representation. And more often than not, our legislation has been<br />
rejected not by a majority but simply by rounding up just half the<br />
Senate to negative a proposal. If the vote is 30-all, then the<br />
proposal is lost.<br />
So we have this situation: a mere 30 Senators can set aside<br />
the clear decision of the majority of the House of Representativesthe<br />
people's House, the House which determines who shall govern;<br />
they can set those proposals aside even when they plainly express<br />
decisions made not just by the elected government but by the,<br />
people themselves, at two successive elections. This is a travesty<br />
of the Parliamentary system and it is a travesty of democracy.<br />
It is a travesty and it is a tragedy for Parliamentary democracy,<br />
because this system is everywhere under challenge, in Europe,<br />
in North America, even in Britain itself, the home of parliamentary<br />
democracy. And the system is not so strong that it can sustain onslaught<br />
after onslaught, unremitting war on its basic foundations.. That is<br />
what is being done in the Australian Senate. This is not just a<br />
matter of declaring war on the Labor Government. It is a declaration<br />
of war on the system itself.<br />
Mr. Snedden defends he certainly does not command the<br />
conduct of his followers in the Senate by pleading that it is all<br />
perfectly legal and constitutional. In recent history, the<br />
irresponsibility of minorities and chance combinations of<br />
Parliamentarians in France, in Italy, in Greece have repeatedly<br />
undermined parliamentary democracy. That, too, was all perfectly<br />
legal and constitutional but absolutely destructive of the<br />
system. The question is not just one of the effect this obstruction,<br />
this falsification of democracy, has on the ability of duly elected<br />
governments to govern effectively and to carry through its program<br />
and to plan effectively. Even more important is the question of<br />
the people's faith in the system.<br />
If democracy is to survive, if the parliamentary system is to<br />
survive, the people must be able to believe that the system can<br />
procide change through peaceful methods. The strength of parliamentary<br />
democracy is that it combines the opportunity for social change<br />
with political stability. Our opponents are striving for the<br />
minimum of change with the maximum of political instability.<br />
In their efforts to thwart our program for change the program<br />
twice endorsed by the electors, they are attempting to strip<br />
democracy of its true meaning, to deprive it of its real strength.<br />
It is a thoroughly mischievous and highly dangerous exercise. </p>
<p>-3<br />
And never more mischievous, never more dangerous than in<br />
the times through which we are now passing, at a time when<br />
governments around the world are confronting the enormous challenge<br />
of inflation. The really damaging thing about inflation is that if<br />
long continued it eats away at the very fabric of society. It<br />
undermines the things which unite us and magnifies the things<br />
which divide us. To add to this problem a new dimension of political<br />
divisiveness is to put a double pressure on a system already under<br />
tremendous stress. The supreme irony is that this sabotage comes<br />
from a party claiming to be the champion of tradition and the<br />
guardian of the constitution.<br />
Throughout the last 14 years as Leader and Deputy Leader of<br />
our Party I have asserted the primacy of Parliament, particularly<br />
the national Parliament, as the instrument for the fulfillment of<br />
our policies. A little more than seven years ago at the annual<br />
conference of this Branch I said to you:<br />
" The test of a political party such as ours is<br />
its ability to win power through Parliament,<br />
to secure throughout Australia a majority of<br />
votes of our fellow citizens. The people who<br />
vote for us and a vast majority of those who<br />
don't increasingly look to the initiative<br />
which the national Parliament could take and<br />
to plans the national Government could make for<br />
a solution of their problems and the<br />
consummation of their aspirations."<br />
I asserted, and the Party accepted, that if we were to secure<br />
a majority of the votes of our fellow citizens, we ourselves as a<br />
party had to be broadly representative of at least half the people.<br />
This belief was behind the reorganisation and reconstruction of<br />
the party at the national level and in New South Wales and Victoria.<br />
The people responded to our efforts. We did make ourselves more<br />
representative and more responsive and more responsible. The result<br />
has been that twice within 18 months a majority of the people of<br />
Australia have given us a majority in the House of Representatives.<br />
Twice they have chosen our men and our measures. Twice they have<br />
expressed clear support for our policies and for a Labor Government.<br />
How many elections must be fought and won before our opponents<br />
accept the people's verdict, before they abandon their belief in their<br />
divine right to rule? We allow ourselves no such delusion. We<br />
believe our right to govern rests upon the consent of the governed,<br />
a consent and a confirmation twice given. We shall exercise that<br />
right. We shall exercise the right to govern given us by a majority<br />
in the House of Representatives, the people's House, a consent<br />
confirmed a mere three months ago, a consent for us to continue to<br />
implement our program for the next three years. We shall continue.<br />
I shall continue continue to fight to implement our Labor program,<br />
continue to fight against inflation, continue to fight to preserve<br />
parliamentary democracy in this country. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
We are faced with an irresponsible, a discredited Opposition,<br />
a discarded opposition, the most irresponsible and irrational<br />
Opposition in the history of Federation. in these circumstances<br />
we have a double responsibility all of us who form the<br />
Government, all of us in the whole Labor movement who have worked<br />
so hard, so long to create our Government and to give our fellow<br />
citizens the opportunities which our programs offer. When, as has<br />
happened, an opposition defects from the system and sets out<br />
deliberately to sabotage the system, it becomes double important<br />
for us to stand firm and to stand together in defence of our program.<br />
When an opposition deliberately sets out to create a climate of<br />
hysteria, it becomes doubly important that we should not lose<br />
our nerve. When an opposition deliberately sets out to sow the seeds of<br />
panic and division in the community it becomes doubly important that<br />
we should stand strong and united. Thi's is a responsibility that<br />
no section of the movement can avoid. We are in this together.<br />
It is not just the Whitlam Government; it is a Labor government<br />
and it is the people's elected Government.<br />
And it has to be said that there are some sections of the<br />
movement whose co-operation is now most needed. We are not in<br />
the business of union-bashing. We cannot and will not compete with<br />
our opponents in that game. Nor are we going to allow employees to<br />
be made the scapegoats for Australia's present economic problems.<br />
We are not going to ask employees to bear the whole brunt of our<br />
attack upon these problems.<br />
In other words we are not going to follow the policies of our<br />
opponents, which they used in government time and time again and which<br />
they would again use if they had the chance. But employees and their<br />
associations do have to make a choice. We have to recognise that'<br />
actions by unions and employees' associations can have a more damaging<br />
effect upon a Labor Government than all the obstruction and<br />
irresponsibility of our opponents. We can handle our opponents<br />
but we need the co-operation of our supporters and those who claim<br />
to support us.<br />
It is thoroughly shortsighted if individual unions use their<br />
muscle in certain key sectors of industry to win short-term<br />
advantages at the expense of their fellow workers. In-the very<br />
short term these may appear superficially attractive but no union,<br />
still less small sections of any industrial union, can live in<br />
isolation from the rest of the community. What happens to individual<br />
unions ultimately affects the whole of the community, and equally<br />
what happens to the whole community ultimately affects every<br />
unionisnd his family.<br />
Nor can employees ignore the threat which excessive wage claims<br />
or unjustified strikes can make on their industry and their own<br />
employment prospects. As Jim Cairns put it to the State Council<br />
of the Victorian Branch of the Party last month: " In a year like<br />
1974 the economy cannot possibly pay general wage increases of<br />
and more without most of them going quickly into prices, and this<br />
means more inflation." </p>
<p>It can also mean and we must face the fact more<br />
unemployment, especially in industries competing with imported<br />
goods. What all of us in the Labor movement must remember is that<br />
wage claims affect the ability of certain industries to compete with<br />
imports. I know there are some unions and some industries where<br />
wage claims can be dealt with in apparent isolation, where there<br />
is no import competition and added cost of wages can be passed on<br />
to the consumer. There are other industries, however, that are not<br />
so fortunate. In those industries the cost of sudden and immoderate<br />
wage increases cannot be passed on so easily. If they are passed on,<br />
in higher prices, there is a real danger that the industries<br />
will no longer be competitive. They will go to the wall, and jobs<br />
will go with them.<br />
So it is in the interests of all unions indeed, it is the<br />
duty of all unions to ensure that wage claims in our present<br />
economic climate are kept within reasonable and responsible limits..<br />
And this is just as much the duty of unions in non-competitive<br />
industries as it is in industries that are vulnerable to competition.<br />
In fact it is the stronger and more fortunate unions that have the<br />
higher duty the duty to set an example. For we know how tempting,<br />
how human, how natural it is for anyone to seek to catch up with<br />
other employees in other industries who receive a substantial<br />
wage rise. And while I am not for a moment suggesting that no wage<br />
claims are justified, that no one deserves any increase at all,<br />
it is vitally important that wage claims are not made at the expense<br />
of fellow-workers' jobs.<br />
We look to the union movement, and particularly supporters of<br />
the Government, to ensure that wage claims and industrial actions<br />
are responsible. Disputes which affect other workers should be<br />
promptly referred to central union bodies the Labor Councils and<br />
the ACTU. In the interests of other unionists and in the public<br />
interest disputes should be restricted to their proper role as a<br />
last resort, not as the first shot in a process of negotiation.<br />
With respect to wage claims we ask unionists to recognise that a<br />
system of indexation will now be introduced, so that claims should<br />
not now be made and do not need to be made in anticipation of<br />
future price increases.<br />
The only people who can effectively persuade unions to keep<br />
their wages within safe and moderate limits are unionists themselves.<br />
So I urge every man on the job and in the factory to exercise<br />
caution, to remember above all his own and his fellow-workers,<br />
livelihood. For that is precisely what is at stake.<br />
Employees who want to keep a Labor Government should measure<br />
the possible consequences of their actions, not only upon the fortunes<br />
of the Government, but upon their fellow-unionists. And unionists who<br />
want to keep a Labor Government should scrutinise the consequences<br />
of some of their officials who are not Labor, who don't particularly<br />
want a Labor Government, some of whom, indeed, correctly view a<br />
Labor Government as the greatest force for democratic change and<br />
social reform within the Parliamentary system. They reject the<br />
system and therefore they reject our role in it. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
The question employees are certainly entitled to ask is why<br />
they should support and co-operate with a Labor Government. It can<br />
be answered at many levels from the narrowest point of view of<br />
an employee's immediate self-interest to the widest considerations<br />
of the national interest and the national good. We all know from<br />
experience what the alternative is. We all know from experience<br />
what methods a non-Labor Government would use by preference and<br />
calculated design to combat inflation. It is the deliberate<br />
creation of massive unemployment. We are not going to take you<br />
down that road.<br />
Look at the general attitude of our opponents to industrial<br />
affairs over a generation. Never once in 23 years, whether there<br />
was inflation or recession, did their Government fail to lend its<br />
support to the employers in the national wage case. For 20 years<br />
unions had been arguing for the re-introduction of wage indexation.<br />
Only now have we a Government taking a positive attitude to the<br />
question. We have made positive and constructive intervention<br />
before the Arbitration Commission. Within hours of taking office<br />
we re-opened the wage case to secure equal pay for women. Against<br />
bitter opposition we have supported the ACTU policy on abolition of<br />
the penal clauses and the amalgamation of unions. We have taken new<br />
initiatives to protect employees by training and retraining programs<br />
and structural adjustment assistance.<br />
Two things are clearly implicit in our opponents' economic<br />
proposals the creation of massive unemployment and the slashing<br />
of basic public expenditure on schools, welfare, health and cities.<br />
On both counts, employees and their families would be the first to<br />
suffer. For most employees, community spending on these matters<br />
the matters which are basic to the quality of their lives and the<br />
lives of the members of their families'-is every bit as important<br />
as their pay packets.<br />
I want to emphasise as strongly as I can that the current<br />
problem of inflation in no way downgrades the importance of our<br />
Government's total program the program I announced in 1972, the<br />
program I repeated in May 1974, the program once again endorsed<br />
by the people in 1974.<br />
On the contrary, the program is crucial to all our efforts<br />
to protect all sections of the Australian community from the<br />
buffets of economic chancgnd circumstance. The fight against<br />
inflation and the implementation of our program will go on together.<br />
They are not contradictory, they are complementary.<br />
Economic management cannot be put into a compartment. It is<br />
part of the whole process of building a stronger economy and<br />
fairer society.<br />
I have said repeatedly that the attack on inflation is a task<br />
for the whole community. That is no mere slogan. We have had<br />
distressing evidence of the failure of some State governments to<br />
play their full part in an anti-inflationary program. it is certainly<br />
not my intention to shuffle off any part of the Australian Government's<br />
responsibility. I acknowledge that the primary responsibility is ours.<br />
There are many things, however, that we simply cannot do on our own. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
One of them is the stabilisation of land prices. This objective<br />
has been part of our policy from the beginning. It has been<br />
discussed specifically and in detail with the Premiers on at<br />
least six occasions. We put forward proposals at our meetings on<br />
the Albury-Wodonga project at the beginning of last year. we<br />
discussed it again at the special Premiers Conference in May<br />
last year; again at the Constitutional Convention in Sydney in<br />
September last year; again during the referendum campaign in<br />
November and December last year; again at the Premiers Conference<br />
in June of this year. In addition we have made individual approaches<br />
to particular States. Remember that the escalating cost of land is<br />
the greatest single component in the inflationary spiral. The States<br />
have the power to deal with it: yet only one State, South Australia,<br />
has made a serious attempt to co-operate with us. And their<br />
efforts have already shown remarkably successful results. Let me<br />
say in passing that I look forward to co-operating with a N. S. W.<br />
Labor Government on this very issue. There is much that we will<br />
achieve together, and there are many other areas -law reform,<br />
the environment, civil liberties, to name a few -where a State<br />
Labor Government is uniquely placed to legislate for essential reforms.<br />
The real protection which individuals, not least employees,<br />
have against economic mischance lies in the quality and equality of<br />
the services and amenities which the community as a whole provides.<br />
Wages and salaries are becoming less and less relevant in determining<br />
a person's or a family's real welfare. No longer is a person's<br />
income the sole measure of the quality of his life or his family's<br />
life. The quality of his life is determined increasingly by the<br />
things which the community acting as a whole provides for its<br />
individual members, and what the community alone can adequately<br />
provide. Increasingly, a person's standard of living is<br />
determined not by his income but by where he lives and by the<br />
community services provided by the community in which he lives.<br />
His health, his children's education, his opportunities and his<br />
leisure, his sense of security and his real security increasingly<br />
depend on the community's ability or will to provide for them<br />
to provide for the needs of individuals by collective decision<br />
and action and to promote opportunities for individuals by<br />
collective decision and action.<br />
The Labor program the program of your Government is to<br />
ensure that those facilities and opportunities are provided by<br />
the community through its elected representatives more<br />
abundantly and mo! 5e equally, for all Australians wherever they<br />
live, wherever they choose to live or wherever they are obliged<br />
to live. The nearer we approach our goal the further recedes the<br />
threat of individual disaster through economic misfortune.<br />
That is why we shall press on with our program. To abandon that<br />
program is to abandon the hopes of those who have twice supported<br />
us and twice elected us. We are not going to do it.<br />
The fight against inflation will go on. it will be hard.<br />
It will be won. The fight to implement our program, our elected<br />
program, will go on. It will be hard. rt will be won. </p>
<p>8-<br />
From the very beginning of our term of office we have contended<br />
with the problem of inflation. Let it never be forgotton that the<br />
roots of our present inflation were present from the start the<br />
result of a gross undervaluation of the dollar and a flood of foreign<br />
money which our predecessors tolerated and encouraged. We have<br />
worked ceaselessly, resourcefully, on many fronts, to contain<br />
inflationary tendencies. For the past six days I have presided at<br />
meetings of the Cabinet to determine every detail of our Budgetary<br />
strategy. We reject all panic talk of crisis and doom. Average weekly<br />
earnings today, despite inflation, are 3% higher than when we came<br />
to office. There are 270,000 more people in the workforce 270,000<br />
more jobs than there were a year ago. We reject the view that<br />
the deliberate creation of unemployment is an acceptable remedy<br />
for inflation or even a feasible remedy. We reject the view<br />
that the Government's program of reform must be put aside while<br />
the battle against inflation goes on.<br />
We reject the view that the battle against inflation will be<br />
wholly painless or, for that matter, intolerably harsh. It is<br />
no more helpful or realistic to exaggerate the hardship entailed<br />
by successful remedies than it is to ignore the hardship. And there<br />
are those who exaggerate the hardship. There are companies who<br />
belieave we must shelter them from the effects of competition, or<br />
the consequences of their own mismanagement, to prevent people<br />
buying goods more cheaply. We do not believe that everybody in<br />
the community should be forced to pay more for textiles, or cars<br />
or color TV sets than these goods are worth. Still less should<br />
the unionist, the working man and his family, be required to pay<br />
through the nose.<br />
Above all, as realists, we must reject the view that some simple<br />
magic solution, some single " package" of solutions call it what<br />
You Will is the answer to our needs. The Government has acted and<br />
will continue to act on many fronts, in many different ways.<br />
Our program to fight inflation is a flexible one, not a set of<br />
measures that make headlines for a day. It has included our monetary<br />
policy to restrain excess liquidity. it has included revaluation of<br />
the Australian dollar and tariff cuts. It has included attempts to<br />
get clear and unequivocal constitutional authority over prices and<br />
incomes. Remember that very little " fine tuning" is possible in<br />
economic management. Governments can never be surd that their<br />
policies will not have an impact on the economy beyond the level<br />
they intended. when that happens and there are signs that it it<br />
happening now we stand ready to adjust and rectify our calculations.<br />
That is what responsible economic management means a capacity for<br />
prompt and flexible response to changing circumstances. That is<br />
why hard and fast rules and packages are irrelevant to our needs,<br />
and indeed meaningless in any rational discussion of the problem.<br />
Let me give two exampleof our successful response to particular<br />
difficulties. You will remember the recent headlines when Leylands<br />
sacked 1,000 workers. Yet within two weeks all but 50 of those<br />
workers were placed in other jobs. That fact just as important<br />
as the original sackings received almost no attention from the<br />
media. Again, when the recent consumer price index for the June<br />
quarter was issued it quite properly received wide coverage in<br />
the press. I do not quibble with that. </p>
<p>9-<br />
I would have hoped however, that the same wide coverage might have<br />
been given to the subsequent news of a fall in the food price index<br />
the first since we came to power. That was largely accounted for by<br />
a drop in meat prices. It was a result of a concerted and consistent<br />
attack on meat prices by the Government over the past year. Our<br />
actions were successful, but successful policies are unfortunately<br />
less newsworthy than difficulties or problems.<br />
The battle against inflation continues but it is not the only<br />
battle. The Government's measures-to retard inflation will continue,<br />
but they are not our only measures. Our opponents and some sections<br />
of the press seem to suggest that every sphere of government activity<br />
must come to a halt, that our every effort towards building a better<br />
and stronger Australia should be set aside until Australia and all<br />
comparable countries have solved this one problem of inflation.<br />
This is self-defeating nonsense. Just as Australia's problem of<br />
inflation cannot be taken out of the context of the world economic<br />
situation so our efforts to combat inflation must be seen in the<br />
context of our total effort, social as well as economic. The<br />
business of government goes on and that business cannot be<br />
confined to a single economic problem.<br />
The deliberations of Cabinet last week must be seen in that<br />
perspective the perspective of implementing our whole program.<br />
Decisions of the highest importante are being made all the time.<br />
In a single week just last week we have made decisions and<br />
announcements of the greatest importance in addition to deciding<br />
the framework for the Budget.<br />
We approved the first grants ever to be made to reduce<br />
inequalities between local government-areas in Australia. For the<br />
first time since its creation in 1933, the Grants Commission has<br />
recommended grants for local government areas. Our government,<br />
which last year empowered the Commission to-recommend aid for local<br />
government as it has always done for States, approved the granting<br />
of more than $ 56M.<br />
At the special sitting of the House of Representatives on<br />
Friday we at last secured the passage of restrictive trade practices<br />
legislation to prevent collusive price fixing. Because of the stalling<br />
and obstruction of the Opposition, this law has been before the<br />
Parliament for 11 months almost a year. It has been debated four<br />
times in the Senate. But for the Opposition, it could already be<br />
working effectively to reduce prices.<br />
Again on Friday we were at last able to pass the law to provide<br />
the basis for a national highway system and to involve the national<br />
Government in planning for and paying for roads in our cities.<br />
These are all decisions which, quite apart from their intrinsic<br />
value, have a close bearing on the economic situation. They are all<br />
part of our program to build a fairer and stronger Australian economy.<br />
And this is our goal; this is the direction towards which we are<br />
leading Australia towards building a fairer, stronger Australia,<br />
an Australia providing greater equality of opportunities for all its<br />
people and a greater abundance of these opportunities. We are not<br />
going to be deterred from those goals, the goals set in the policy<br />
speeches of 1972 and 1974, the goals adopted by the people of<br />
Australia in 1972 and 1974. We are not going to be stampeded.<br />
We are not going to be panicked. We have to recognise that there are<br />
groups and interests who have a vested interest in spreading panic,~ </p>
<p>10<br />
suspicion and division. Rumour-mongering and scare-mongering is<br />
their stock in trade. We saw appalling examples of it last week.<br />
The hysteria of our opponents who cannot accept their double<br />
defeat must not be allowed to infect the Australian community.<br />
We are certainly not going to allow it to infect the Australian<br />
Labor Government. We do have serious problems. We share these<br />
problems with all comparable countries. We are better placed than<br />
most comparable countries to overcome these problems. We are going<br />
to do so. It won't be done by grand-standing. it won'It be done<br />
by panic, it won't be done by hysteria. It will be done by a cool,<br />
steady, confident government given the co-operation of an<br />
intelligent, responsible community. It will be done by this<br />
Government, this Labor Government which you all have worked for over<br />
so many years and which, given your help and co-operation, wvill lcng<br />
corti. nue to vrork for the true advancement of all the Austral ian<br />
peop 0.. In December 1972 the Labor Party and the entire Labor<br />
movement won a great victory a deserved and long-awaited victory.<br />
Just over three months ago the result was conf~ irmed by the Australian<br />
people in the election of 18 May.<br />
Let us remember why we worked for those victories, and why<br />
the people gave us their support.<br />
I ask you to remember the kind of society we rejected.. in<br />
December 1972 the attitudes and habits we put behind us*.<br />
We rejected complacency. W-e rejected inequality. We rejected<br />
poverty, injustice and fear. We rejected the chronic stagnation<br />
and ' impoverishment of our schools, an unjust and inefficient health<br />
service, miserly pension schemes and social service handouts<br />
that condemned thousands of Australians to hardship and indignity.<br />
We rejected dikapidated cities, antiquated public transport, and<br />
the pollution and destruction of the natural environment. We rejected<br />
Vietnam and conscription. We rejected unemployment as a deliberate<br />
weapon of economic policy. We rejected penal clauses and the whole<br />
apparatus of union intimidation. We rejected the long history of<br />
neglect of the weak and deprived the pensioners, Aboriginals,<br />
migrants and working women. We rejected the takeover of our industries<br />
and resources by foreign interests. We rejected a foreign<br />
policy that stifled our national independence and bound us to<br />
military entanglements and cold-war ideologies.<br />
Such were the attitudes and philosophies we put behind us.<br />
For the millions of Australians who supported us, the election of<br />
December 1972 was indeed a vote for change, for new directions, for<br />
new policies. For those of us in the Party, however, it was more<br />
than that. It was the fulfilment of long-cherished hopes and<br />
dreams, the culmination of years of work and planning by devoted<br />
men and women who were determined on a better and brighter future<br />
for Australia. We must keep those goals before us. By working together<br />
and only by working together we will achieve them. </p>
