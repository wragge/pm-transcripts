PRIME MINISTERI<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, and the Prime<br />
Minister today announced agreement to further assistance<br />
measures for Newcastle earthquake victims.<br />
The special measures for Newcastle were required because<br />
of the extent of losses suffered by householders and<br />
business people as a result of the earthquake.<br />
The measures are to be available as a " safety net" when<br />
people in genuine need are unable to be adequately<br />
assisted by the arrangements already in place.<br />
The special assistance for Newcastle will apply as<br />
follows:<br />
H~ azseholdpra Government assistance will be available for those<br />
who had under-insured 8s well as those who had no<br />
insurance cover.<br />
Grant assistance will continue to be available to<br />
assist those who satisfy the New South Wales<br />
Government's eligibility criteria based on income<br />
and assets.<br />
Those who are ineligible for grants would previously<br />
have not been able to receive any disaster<br />
assistance. However, the Governments have now<br />
agreed to a " safety net" being introduced in the<br />
form of loans at the low rate of 6% per annum. This<br />
measure is in special recognition of the extent of<br />
damage to houses in Newcastle.<br />
The safety net will apply to householders in the<br />
situation of being ineligible for grants but unable<br />
to afford to borrow through commercial channels.<br />
These people will now have access to cheap loans to<br />
restore houses to safe and habitable conditions.<br />
Egmall R. u. nnppa<br />
The New South Wales and Federal Governments have<br />
decided that a special assistance measure is needed<br />
in addition to the low interest loan scheme<br />
previously announced. </p>
<p>2<br />
This special measure will be made available to those<br />
small business which are deemed to have been in a<br />
sound financial position prior to the earthquake but<br />
which are unable to take advantage of the existing<br />
concessional interest loan scheme due to an<br />
inability to service additional debt.<br />
The assistance will be in the form of grants, and<br />
applications will be assessed by a committee<br />
comprising State officers from the Rural Assistance<br />
Authority, Business and Consumer Affairs, Treasury<br />
and the State Bank.<br />
cost Sharing<br />
The costs associated with these special relief measures<br />
will be shared by the New South Wales and Federal<br />
Government under the for cost sharing arrangements<br />
previously agreed to.<br />
Mr Hawks and Mr Greiner also took the opportunity to urge<br />
all Australians to ensure that they have a proper level<br />
of insurance cover for their homes anid businesses.<br />
While the relief measures being made available by our<br />
Governents will assist in alleviating the suffering of<br />
disaster victims, particularly those in most need, the<br />
schemes should not be regarded as an alternative to<br />
normal insurance arrangements.<br />
Those who believe they may be eligible for the new or<br />
existing relief measures should submit claims at the<br />
earliest opportunity.<br />
