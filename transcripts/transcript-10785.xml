    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>President Menem and I have had a very useful discussion for the last</p>
<p> 45 minutes. I would like, Sir, on behalf of the Australian Government</p>
<p> to publicly welcome you to our country for the first time. And to</p>
<p> remark that we are delighted that you have brought such a large number</p>
<p> of Ministers, seven in number, and two Provincial Secretaries and</p>
<p> also a very high level business delegation.</p>
<p>As you all know Argentina and Australia have a number of very strong</p>
<p> common interests. One of those is undoubtedly the common membership</p>
<p> of the Cairns Group and the direct interest we both have in securing</p>
<p> a better trade deal.</p>
<p>I am delighted that during the time of your visit we have had the</p>
<p> opportunity, through our Ministers, to sign a number of agreements</p>
<p> that will lay the foundation of an even stronger relationship. And</p>
<p> I will say a few words about those agreements in a moment. But Mr</p>
<p> President you may wish to make some introductory remarks.</p>
<p>PRESIDENT MENEM:</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Prime Minister.</p>
<p>We are coming to the end of a very successful visit in Australia and</p>
<p> I have only words of gratitude for the Government and the people of</p>
<p> Australia for the warmth and affection with which we have been received.</p>
<p>I was telling the Prime Minister that two Argentine Presidents have</p>
<p> come to Australia to visit, my predecessor, Dr Raul Alfonsin. But</p>
<p> we have not yet had the visit of an Australian Prime Minister to Argentina.</p>
<p> I hope to have your visit soon so we can continue discussing these</p>
<p> agreements and other agreements we must sign, one of them being the</p>
<p> double taxation agreement.</p>
<p>We have an agreement on sports co-operation it is being signed today,</p>
<p> an agreement on mining, on agricultural co-operation and on aviation.</p>
<p> The number of flights between Argentina and Australia will be increased</p>
<p> flying over the South Pole, giving us a possibility of having a greater</p>
<p> exchange between Australia and Argentina and more trade and also a</p>
<p> very important industry for both countries such as tourism.</p>
<p>This is what I wanted to say Mr Prime Minister and thank you very</p>
<p> much for giving me the chance of saying all this. And now I will give</p>
<p> you the floor again Mr Prime Minister if there is anything more that</p>
<p> you would like to say.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Mr President, just two other things.</p>
<p>The first of those is, to remark that during your term Australian</p>
<p> investment in Argentina has jumped from about $20 million to $2.2</p>
<p> billion. One of the notable areas of investment, of course, has been</p>
<p> in the media where Prime Television and Channel 9 Argentina have signed</p>
<p> an agreement. And there are also, of course, very extensive mining</p>
<p> interests.</p>
<p>And finally could I put on record my appreciation of the very strong</p>
<p> support Argentina has given to the allied effort to contain Saddam</p>
<p> Hussein. As you know Australian forces are still in the Gulf and we</p>
<p> greatly appreciate your contribution.</p>
<p>That is all I have to say, Sir, perhaps we could have one or two questions</p>
<p> from the ladies and gentlemen of the media. We could take an Australian</p>
<p> question first.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr President, why has your country never arrested, tried or punished</p>
<p> those responsible for bombings almost four years ago of the Jewish</p>
<p> Centre in Buenos Aires where more than 80 people died? And the earlier</p>
<p> bombing of the Israeli Embassy when more than 30 lost their lives?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT MENEM:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your question. These two terrorist attacks</p>
<p> are being investigated. It is not easy to find those responsible.</p>
<p> We are following several leads and I believe that we have given Israel</p>
<p> the best possibilities to come to our country and to work in this</p>
<p> investigation through their security organisations and intelligence</p>
<p> agencies. And not only that, we have given them the possibility of</p>
<p> having access to all the files, the police files in Argentina and</p>
<p> all the files that have remained in Argentina about the Nazis.</p>
<p>And we have opened all our banking accounts so that an indepth investigation</p>
<p> can be performed as to the resources that could have come to Argentina</p>
<p> after the Second World War. And Argentine co-operation has been full</p>
<p> in this aspect. We have had the CIA, the FBI, Scotland Yard, all the</p>
<p> intelligence services have co-operated to try to find those responsible</p>
<p> for these attacks. And I would also like to remind you that there</p>
<p> are several attacks that have taken place in Israel, perhaps many</p>
<p> years ago and they have not yet found those responsible. How long</p>
<p> did it take before they found those responsible for the attack against</p>
<p> the athletes at the Olympic villa in Germany many, many years ago.</p>
<p> Of course this is not to justify what we are doing in Argentina but</p>
<p> we want you to know that we are investigating and I am sure that we</p>
<p> will find a solution after that investigation. And you know that some</p>
<p> people are already under arrest. Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST (Argentine press):</p>
<p>This question was not translated.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr President, Geoffrey Barker Australian Financial Review. Is Argentina</p>
<p> satisfied that Australia is being sufficiently aggressive through</p>
<p> the Cairns Group in pursuing agricultural trade liberalisation in</p>
<p> all forums?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT MENEM:</p>
<p>Not only in the Cairns Group but before that within GATT and during</p>
<p> the GATT rounds Argentina and Australia have shared in this battle</p>
<p> and as we were saying with the Prime Minister, we will have to continue</p>
<p> this battle. And the attitude taken by Australia has been aggressive</p>
<p> enough and we have to continue fighting within the WTO to obtain more</p>
<p> equitable distribution of the system of agriculture in the world.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
