    <content><![CDATA[<p>Like all Australians I have been saddened by the tragic loss of life and property in the fires burning across Greece. According to media reports, many of the fires continue to burn and more than 60 people have died.</p>
<p>Australians well understand the damage and destruction that such fires can cause. On behalf of all Australians, I express our deep sympathy to the Government and people of Greece. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and with those Greek Australians whose families may have been affected.</p>
<p>Given the loss of life and the scale of the damage Australia will offer $3 million in assistance. </p>
<p>Commonwealth and state officials are also working urgently to ascertain what incident management and fire fighting expertise Australia might most usefully make available to Greek authorities. Australia has highly trained incident managers and wildfire fighters with extensive domestic and international experience. </p>
<p>I have written to Prime Minister Karamanlis to express our sympathy and to convey this offer.  </p>
