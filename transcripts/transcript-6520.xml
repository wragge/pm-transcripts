FOR M4EDIA 23 OCTOBER 1984<br />
LAUNCESTON GENERAL HOSPITAL<br />
In * accordance with a long-standing-Labor Party commitment,<br />
the Federal Government will meet half the capital cost of the<br />
final stage of development of Launceston General Hospital.<br />
The final stage is estimated to cost up to $ 34 million,<br />
and the Federal Government's contribution has an upper<br />
limit of $ 17 million.<br />
The completion of development of the hospital will overcome<br />
severe difficulties caused by the current separation of<br />
services and facilities on opposite sides of Charles Street.<br />
It will enable the hospital to function at full efficiency,<br />
with greater comfort and convenience for patients and staff.<br />
It will also guarantee that people in the north of Tasmania<br />
will have ample access to high quality hospital facilities<br />
for many years to come.<br />
Renovation work on the Queen' Victoria Hospital will also be<br />
included in the project.<br />
To ensure that Launceston hospital is completed as quickly<br />
as possible, I have proposed to the Tasmanian Premier that<br />
feasibility planning be completed by mid 1985, the design<br />
for construction tender finalised early in 1986, and<br />
construction commenced in mid 1986. This should enable<br />
completion of the hospital by the end of 1.989.<br />
The Federal Government's decision follows consideration of the<br />
recommendations of the joint Commonwealth-State Committee of<br />
Review chaired by Sir Keith Shann, which reported earlier<br />
this year.<br />
The Commonwealth Departments of Health and Housing and<br />
Construction will be members of a joint Commonwealth-State<br />
Steering Committee which will oversight all stages of the<br />
development of the project and will participate in the<br />
selection of the consultants to undertake the initial<br />
feasibility study. -1 </p>
