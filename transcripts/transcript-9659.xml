STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MPD<br />
GAS REFORM TASK FORCE<br />
I am pleased to announce today that Mr Ric Chariton, the former Chairman<br />
and CEO of Shell Australia, has agreed to chair the Gas Reform Task Force<br />
which is being created to oversee the implementation of reform in the national<br />
gas industry.<br />
The Task Force will include a senior representative from the Commonwealth<br />
and each participating State and Territory and an independent project team<br />
to provide it with the necessary support.<br />
It will be roquirod to oonsul closely all rolevdr: i i itutrted parties, Incluaing<br />
all sectors of the industry and users, environmental interests, consumers and<br />
unions. This means that the Task Force, through Mr Charlton, will provide<br />
stakeholders in the gas industry with a direct involvement in the gas industry<br />
reform process.<br />
Their invol vement will be vitally important to ensuring that the arrangements<br />
implemented for the natural gas industry are technically, commercially and<br />
environmentally sensible.<br />
The historic agreement on national competition policy reform reached in April<br />
this year set the framework for guiding competition reform across all<br />
industries. It is now essential to ensure these reforms are implemented In key areas,<br />
such as the natural gas Industry.<br />
The first activity of the Task Force will be to produce a scoping report which<br />
identifies the actions required to implement the Council of Australian<br />
Governments' agreement to achieve free and fair trade in natural gas by<br />
1 July 1996. </p>

These actions would be In light of the related reform processes underway,<br />
including: the national competition policy reforms, specific reforms<br />
undertaken by the States, Territories and the Commonwealth, and the<br />
industry's own initiatives.<br />
Part of this task will be to consider the extent of national coordination that is<br />
appropriate for the Implementation of gas industry reform.<br />
As well as large economic benefits, micro-economic reform in the natural gas<br />
Industry will promote switching to gas from other fossil fuels and will therefore<br />
contribute significantly to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.<br />
The Government's One Nation initiatives recently resulted in the opening of<br />
the standard gauge railway line between Melbourne and Adelaide, linking for<br />
the first time Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth via a common<br />
rail gauge. Through a consistent approach to reform in key areas, such as<br />
the natural gas industry, Australian governments are now in a position to<br />
ensure that these * rail gauge" problems do not re-emerge elsewhere.<br />
