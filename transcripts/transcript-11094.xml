    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Senator Harradine, Care workers, Jeff Kennett, Bob Hawke</p>
<p>E&amp;OE............................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Senator Harradine has given an indication that there's not enough</p>
<p> in what you're doing with the GST, it's going to require</p>
<p> a lot more than tinkering at the margins?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Senator Harradine has made a speech. We are going to study that</p>
<p> speech. He has asked a number of questions, he sought a lot of additional</p>
<p> information. As we always do, we will study what he has had to say</p>
<p> and we will answer those questions and we will provide that information.</p>
<p> I haven't read that speech, I've had a report given to me,</p>
<p> but we will analyse very carefully what he has had to say and we'll</p>
<p> respond to the questions that he has raised.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Senator Harradine has said that compensation is not adequate enough</p>
<p> at the moment. How do you respond to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not going to add to anything I've said. We'll answer</p>
<p> the questions he's raised, we'll deal with the points of</p>
<p> information that he's sought, but you're not going to get</p>
<p> me to give some kind of public analysis of Senator Harradine's</p>
<p> response. I don't operate that way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has President Habibie asked you to participate in a unit to go to</p>
<p> East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that implies some kind of military involvement and the answer</p>
<p> is clearly no. But what President Habibie did say to me was that in</p>
<p> the UN supervision of the vote to be taken in Timor, he would like</p>
<p> Australia involved. Australia of course wants to take a very constructive</p>
<p> attitude and we will of course discuss that and a number of other</p>
<p> issues when we meet in Bali next Tuesday. The meeting will be next</p>
<p> Tuesday as a result there are a lot of things that will be on the</p>
<p> table but Australia is a friend of Indonesia, we want to help, we</p>
<p> want to express the concern we feel about what is occurring in Timor.</p>
<p> I welcome the steps that have apparently been taken by General Wiranto,</p>
<p> the Indonesian Defence Minister and the clear commitment that Dr Habibie</p>
<p> has again given to the process of consultation and decision making</p>
<p> in East Timor.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke said in a speech last night</p>
<p> that East Timor was Kosovo in Australia's backyard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't make a habit of commenting on every remark made</p>
<p> by former Prime Ministers and I am not going to comment on that one.</p>
<p> I thought the contribution that Mr Evans made in the Australian</p>
<p> this morning was quite relevant.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If we can go back to the GST  you've clearly got some horse-trading</p>
<p> to do with Senator Harradine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't have anything to add Mr Parry to what I have already</p>
<p> said. We'll have a look at what he said. I am not going to ....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(Inaudible) without going into detail.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well what is the other question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How do you feel your visit to WA has been?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It has been very good. First Prime Minister to go to Kalgoorlie for</p>
<p> 18 years, very interesting visit.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any response to the protestors this morning at the breakfast?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I have forgotten about them actually.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Jeff Kennett was on the cover of a magazine with a couple of young</p>
<p> girls (inaudible) is that appropriate for a Premier to....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jeff is very good at running his own PR. I won't be giving him</p>
<p> any public advice. Good luck to him.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister I know you are going to get cross at me.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never get cross with you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Going back to the detail of what Senator Harradine said. You clearly</p>
<p> have a job in front of you to deal with him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'll analyse that question Geoff and I will send you a letter.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was Senator Harradine's position a surprise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I ll analyse that one too.</p>
