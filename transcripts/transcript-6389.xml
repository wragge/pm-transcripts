TRANSCRIPT OE PRESS CONFERENCE -PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
8 MAY 1984<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
I believe that you probably want to ask me some<br />
questions in regard to the issues and the events that have<br />
arisen today and so I'm available for any questions that<br />
you'd like to put to me. I hope you understand that I do<br />
have to speak in the House before very long, so I can't<br />
be open-ended about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, Mr Peacock says that an imbalance has been<br />
created since your Government came to office. What's your<br />
reaction to that?<br />
That is not correct if it implies some deliberate<br />
action on our part. The facts are very simple. That all<br />
governments have had as the major criterion for determining<br />
the level of immigration intake economic considerations.<br />
That determines the absolute level that comes in. Within the<br />
decisions that are made on that ground there are categories for<br />
the intake of immigrants. Those include the occupational shortages<br />
category, if I can put it that way, the business migration program,<br />
the family reunion component and the refugee component. And<br />
we made a decision in our first year of Government which was<br />
our decision as to intakes that on economic grounds the total<br />
level would be reduced somewhat. It was'. a maximum of 70,000).<br />
That's the gross arrivals, in net terms it will be less than that.<br />
Now we have followed the policies of the previous Governmentbecause<br />
in Opposition we endorsed them. And that meant that<br />
people that were already in Australia, irrespective of their<br />
country of origin, had the rights in regard-to family reunion.<br />
And because of the operation of that and continuation of that<br />
non-discriminatory approach it has meant, as the Minister has<br />
indicated, some relative increase of immigrants of Asian<br />
origin. But I want to emphasise that has not been any deliberate<br />
policy to change the ethnic composition of immigrants coming,<br />
to this country, but merely reflects a continuation by this;<br />
Government of what has been a bi-partisan approach.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Peacock says that until there is a balance<br />
restored between European and Asian migration then that<br />
bi-partisanship will not exist.<br />
Well just let me give you the figures of what's happened<br />
over recent years in regard to the element of Asian refugee<br />
intake. If I go back to the period when it started to increase / 2 </p>
<p>P. M. cont.: significantly which was 78/ 79, I'll give you<br />
the figures from 78/ 79 through. In 1978/ 79 the number of<br />
Asian refugees was 12,000,-I'll round it off to the nearest<br />
thousand 78/ 79: 12,000, 79/ 80: 15,000, 80/ 81: 16,000,<br />
81/ 82: 15,000, 82/ 83: 13,000, and in our first year 83/ 84;<br />
10,000. Now you can see the intake of refugees, which we..<br />
let me say entirely endorsed at the time that it happened,<br />
rose during that previous period,'. it is at a lower level in<br />
83/ 84. And if the opposition are about a debate as to the<br />
level of immigration into this country, and of course that's<br />
a legitimate debate, it seems a strange way of trying to<br />
get there but I can simply repeat what is the incontrovertible<br />
truth and that is that having made a decision: as a Government<br />
about a lower absolute level of immigration in 83/ 84, ther<br />
the components within it, proportions within it, inevitably<br />
follow if you are going to say that in respect of those<br />
people who are here irrespective of their origin, that they<br />
have the same rights in respect of family reunion. You seE!,<br />
I'll just do a quick count of the period that I covered from<br />
78/ 79, that's 12,000, 27,000, 43,000, 58,000, 71,000. 71,000<br />
refugees have come in in that period from 78/ 79 throught to<br />
82/ 83. Now Australians are not going to say in respect of<br />
those people that they haven't got the same rights to exercise<br />
in respect of family reunion and they were entitled to exercise<br />
those rights. They have done that. And inevitably in those<br />
circumstances it will,-reflect the marginal changes in composition<br />
to which I've referred.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Peacock has suggested an increase in European<br />
immigration in total, to increase the total number of migrants<br />
to fix the problem. What do you think of that?<br />
He said to fix the problem? I don't accept the existence<br />
of a problem, because what exists is the application by my<br />
Government of the principles that have been followed<br />
consistently by the previous Government and with . the support<br />
of the Opposition. Now if Mr Peacock is arguing for an increase<br />
in the level of immigration, that the level of immigration is<br />
too high and that can be the only thing that the existing level<br />
is too low and that we should have a higher level then that<br />
is one thing. If he wants to debate that then, of course, that<br />
is a legitimate debate. We simply made the decision in our<br />
first year of office that given the level of unemployment that<br />
we'd inherited where you had hundreds of thousands of Australians<br />
who were unemployed, then it was not a sensible decision to<br />
keep up such a high absolute level of immnigration that had<br />
existed. And I believe that that is a policy and a decision<br />
made last year which would be endorsed by the overwhelming<br />
majority of Australians. Now if he wants to argue that there<br />
should be a significantly higher level of immigration in total<br />
in 84/ 85, well then that is legitimate. I would simply say<br />
to you that in making a decision as to what the absolute le-,. 7e1<br />
of immigration will be in 84/ 85 we will take that decision<br />
on the grounds, the basis, that we did last year. Now what<br />
figure that will come out at I can't say now. But we will<br />
not deviate from the principles that we've followed. If yo-a're<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>P. M. cant: talking about aproblen here weve got to make<br />
it quite clear that if you're saying that there are too marty<br />
Asians compared to non-Asians, to be saying that's the problem<br />
and to meet that " problem", that you've got to bring in more<br />
people from the non-Asian category and therefore get residually<br />
an outcome in absolute terms, then he's entitled to put -that.<br />
But I'm simply saying that we will make a decision about the<br />
absolute level of intake on economic grounds. Once we've<br />
said that we are rnot going to deny the people who have come<br />
into this country under the policies of the previous Government,<br />
which we endorsed, we are not going to deny to them the rights<br />
of family reunion which apply to everyone.<br />
JOURNALIST: If it's not your Government's policy to create<br />
a change in the ethnic composition of the state of society<br />
if it's not your policy if it is however the effect of<br />
the principles on which your policy is based that there is ~ a<br />
change in the ethnic composition of AuStralian society, does<br />
that give you, or do you think that ought to give many<br />
Australians cause for concern or regret?<br />
PM: If what you were looking at: was a drastic change in the<br />
composition, it may become a leqitimatE? area for discussion,<br />
but, as you will see from the quote that I made in the<br />
Parliament today, of what Mr. Peacock said I think it was<br />
on 22 March he was saying himself that it is not right to talk<br />
about Asianisation. He has acknowledgEd that and quite clearly<br />
the dimensions that we are referring to in the total population<br />
now of getting on for 15 million people you can't statistically<br />
assert with any veracity that that situation exists.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr. West has said that one of the<br />
reasons for the change in mix is a diminution from the European<br />
and British Isles -people wanting to come over, but Mr. Peacock<br />
produced figures -allegedly from the Department today saying<br />
that that wasn't in fact the case. Will you look into that?<br />
PM: Certainly I will look into that, but it still doesn't<br />
divert from the basic points that I've been making that once<br />
you've made a decision as to absolute levels and you remain<br />
committed to the element and the rights of family reunion<br />
concept then that must inevitably it is a statistical<br />
inevitability that that will have an impact upon the composition<br />
of your intake.<br />
JOURNALIST: The figures you gave us a second ago were for a<br />
percentage of refugee intakes from Asia. I-take it they don't<br />
include family reunion intakes. Do you have those figures?<br />
PM: I haven't got those in front of me, but no, those are<br />
strictly the refugee figures, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sure, that's right, but I assume what we are tal~ king<br />
about are the total intake.<br />
PM: Yes, but I did say in my comments that if you look at the<br />
aggregates of those that will obviously be reflected in your<br />
family reunion figures. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: I just wanted to make the point that following your<br />
argument, which is obviously quite correct, it also becomes a<br />
statistical certainty, that we will have a higher proportion of<br />
Asians because of the very reasons you advance as you continue<br />
with this policy.<br />
PM: Well, what you have got to say is that as those that are<br />
here and the numbers, as I've indicated, are declining that are<br />
coming in under the refugee program -as they exercise the right<br />
of family reunion then that is going -by definition, that is<br />
going to diminish. So it is not possible to say at this stage,<br />
Max, what the sort-of proportions will be over the next few<br />
years other than to say that what you've got, really, looking at<br />
the Australian situation now is that the people who have come<br />
here from non-Asian sources over a longer period have probably<br />
tended to exercise their family reunion rights earlier and that<br />
is diminishing. You will have the same sort of thing happening<br />
now with this much lower level of Asian immigration that they<br />
are exercising their family reunion right now.<br />
JOURNALIST: So there will be a lag for SOME! years.<br />
PM: Lag to some extent.<br />
JOURNALIST: What I'm suggesting is that you're facing in the<br />
next few years this relative shift, as you described it, of<br />
Asian intake or actual increase over the next few years of<br />
PM: No, of course that depends, Max, on what decision is<br />
tEaken about your aggregate level of immigration. See, it may<br />
well be I'm not saying that this will be the case but it is<br />
quite arguable for instance, that within a year or so's time<br />
the economic situation may well be that your occupational<br />
category component may increase, that you increase the<br />
absolute level so that that mix will change. I'm simply making<br />
the point you cannot<br />
JOURNALIST: The family reunion, say, is what I was talking about.<br />
PM: The family reunion side in respect of those people who<br />
are already here, what you are saying is correct. Of course the<br />
current situation, * as I repeat, reflects the fact that those who<br />
have been here from non-Asian sources for some considerable<br />
period of time have exercised the right.<br />
JOURNALIST: If it's an issue now, it might become an even<br />
greater issue in a few years time.<br />
PM: Just in respect of that component, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, I have to go in a second, can I just ask'one<br />
quick question.<br />
PM: Let me make it clear, ladies and gentlemen, that we must<br />
arrange this press question to suit your convenience, Laurie.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you believe that the Liberals and<br />
the National Party are trying to whip this issue up as an<br />
election issue the issue of Asian immigration? </p>
<p>PM: I'm not going to answer that question because what I was<br />
concerned about in the House today and what I ' 11 be concerned<br />
about in the House when I make my speech is not to try and make<br />
this a partisan issue, to score points off anyone. What I'm<br />
really concerned about, Laurie, is to try, to eliminate what is<br />
potentially an ugly feature of the Australian scene, to try and<br />
eliminate that from the political debate and I'm certainly,<br />
therefore, not going to answer that question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that why you asked the Opposition not<br />
to appeal to, I think you described it as uninformed<br />
emotions, and How do you think those uninformed emotions<br />
might be manifested?<br />
PM: I think all of us have seen some evidence by slogans on<br />
walls and certain observations that have been made about<br />
Asians. One point I will be making in my comments in the<br />
House in a short period is that I have been associated now<br />
for nearly 40 years publicly with the immigration program<br />
and with trying to ensure that there is an elimination of<br />
prejudices in this country. I will certainly also be making<br />
the point that it is worth thinking about the fact, isn't it,<br />
that there has been very prominent in our public life in the<br />
last few weeks there is a person called Dr. Chang, who at<br />
this moment is leading a team fighting to save the life of a<br />
young Australian, Phiona. Now, I don't know where Dr. Chang's<br />
antecedants are. I'm sure they are not in Gundagai or<br />
Tullarook. Do you mind if I finish? And that man is<br />
obviously of Asian origin. Now, he is an Australian and he is<br />
doing a fantastic job within and for Australia and the strength<br />
of this country over th&amp; period since the war derives very<br />
substantially from the fact that we are a country now composed<br />
of people, who, I think were shown in the 1981 census have<br />
people here from I think it is 92 countries of origin<br />
and what as Prime Minister I am concerned. about is trying to<br />
help Australians to understand that the strength of this country<br />
very much derives from the fact that we have this very rich<br />
diversification of source. We are a country of just over<br />
million people and we live in a part of the world which is<br />
going inevitably and inexorably into the future to be interwoven<br />
with our fortunes and Australians must understand these things,<br />
I believe and th ' e overwhelming majority of them do. What I'Im<br />
concerned about today and into the future is to try and ensure!<br />
that-as far as it is humanly possible we eliminate from the<br />
face of public life ' in Australia this divisive issue and one<br />
which is very dangerous potentially.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think it a worthwhile<br />
decision to have shut down the Big Brother movement in the<br />
light of all this debate over the last couple of days?<br />
PM: I don't in a sense want to debase the fundamental issues<br />
that I'm addressing and hoping that Australians will address,<br />
by building that up into an issue beyond its intrinsic importance.<br />
I believe that the decision which was contemplated by the<br />
previous Minister and which has been given effect to by this<br />
Minister is an appropriate one. </p>
