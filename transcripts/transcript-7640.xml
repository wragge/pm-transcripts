TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SYDNEY CONVENTION CENTRE<br />
14 JUNE 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: A message for the Chinese students in<br />
Australia Mr Hawke, do you have one?<br />
PM: Two. First of course to reaffirm the sense of tragedy<br />
that we share with them for what has happened in their<br />
country and second to say to them quite directly that we<br />
will be very accommodating in our approach to any requests<br />
that are made where there is clearly a legitimate concern on<br />
the part of any Chinese student that a return to China in<br />
these circumstances would pose dangers to them. That is the<br />
obvious proper approach for us to adopt and it's the one we<br />
would adopt.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you considering a relief package for<br />
mortgagees? PM: No, it's not a question of considering a package of<br />
relief. All I've said in the past and all I'm prepared to<br />
say now is that we are continually looking at the operation<br />
and impact of economic policies. We will continue to do<br />
that. The position of course is that, as I've said, we've<br />
got to slow down the level of activity in the economy.<br />
We've got a too strong economy. We have to have that as a<br />
continuation of the thrust of policy to slow down the level<br />
of activity so that we get a more sustainable level of<br />
imports. We can't change that basic thrust. Within that<br />
situation we'll continue to examine the impact of what those<br />
policies are producing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any short-term relief for people suffering from<br />
? 2<br />
PM: I've got nothing to add to the answer I've given.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PM: I've got nothing to add to the answer I've given.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Financial Review story wrong?<br />
PM: It wouldn't be the first time, would it. They've got a<br />
good track record of being wrong. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALIST: What implications do you think the turmoil in<br />
China will have on your regional trade initiatives?<br />
PM: I don't think it will have directly any impact on the<br />
initiatives. we've now sounded out the countries in the<br />
region, that's the ASEAN countries Japan, Korea, New<br />
Zealand, the United States and Canada. There is generally a<br />
fairly positive reaction. I think it has its own momentum<br />
now and will not be affected one way or the other by those<br />
events. JOURNALIST: But you're not so optimistic about a settlement<br />
for Cambodia in the light of what you<br />
PM: I simply was saying, I didn't want to leave the<br />
impression that I was saying that those settlement processes<br />
had been derailed, and I've got no reason to believe they<br />
have been derailed. I was simply making the point that one<br />
of the issues that's clearly still to be settled between all<br />
the parties involved, directly and indirectly, is in the<br />
post-withdrawal phase. That's when the Vietnamese troops<br />
have withdrawn by the end of September, what is the sort of<br />
administrative authority, what are the roles that are<br />
available both for the PRK government and for the factions<br />
that have been opposed to the PRK? Now within that overall<br />
question the central issue has been the Khmer Rouge.<br />
There's a legitimate concern widespread that if Sihanouk and<br />
his other colleagues were to come back in and that the Khmer<br />
Rouge were to be part of that process, because of the<br />
superior supply of weaponry and arms that they have and<br />
their past track record, there could be a concern that they<br />
could upset the balance that would be acceptable to everyone<br />
else. Now within that sort of framework there had been an<br />
optimistic assessment that China would not in a<br />
post-withdrawal situation, they or the Vietnamese, that they<br />
would not supply arms to the Khmer Rouge. That been<br />
part of the whole pattern of planning and thinking, that's<br />
if you like to put it, optimism for the future. I simply<br />
raise the question, no more than that, whether with the<br />
recent events in China would there be the same degree of<br />
optimism about the attitude of China in that situation.<br />
That's all I've said. There is no reason to say that I<br />
think what's happened there is going to derail these<br />
important processes. It just is a legitimate question mark<br />
you've got to raise.<br />
JOURNALIST: You've said it's an important trip Prime<br />
minister, which are the most important issues and do you<br />
think they'll prevail over interest rates as far as the<br />
average common sense of working Australians go?<br />
PM: I don't think they're alternatives. I think that in<br />
the six years I've been in office that the Australian people<br />
have come to accept that the visits that I make overseas<br />
have very specific and relevant purposes as far as<br />
Australia's welfare is concerned. There's never really in </p>
<p>PM ( cont): the six years been any question about the<br />
relevance or the appropriateness or the usefulness of the<br />
visits I undertake. I think you will have heard from what I<br />
said here today that in each of the countries I'll be<br />
visiting there are very specific Australian interests, both<br />
in terms of bilateral issues, in terms of regional<br />
considerations and in terms of global issues like the world<br />
trading environment, environmental issues and so on. So I<br />
therefore, in that circumstance, find it difficult to rate,<br />
in terms of priorities, the importance of the various<br />
matters that I'll be discussing with the French and in the<br />
United Kingdom, in the United States, Germany and Hungary.<br />
There are a range of the important issues. Now how do they<br />
rate against issues of compelling importance to people in<br />
Australia at the moment, like high interest rates? There's<br />
not a comparison to be made. I mean, for the person who's<br />
Sbeen hit by a rise in his or her mortgage repayments, I<br />
guess for that person there's hardly anything, if anything,<br />
as important as that. I understand it and I hope that they<br />
will understand from my point of view that I feel deeply<br />
about the pressure that has been imposed upon people by<br />
these high interest rates, particularly for those who can<br />
least afford them. What needs to be understood is what I've<br />
been saying, two things. Firstly, that if we didn't have<br />
these tight policies at the moment then the outcome would be<br />
worse and it would be worse for these very people, the ones<br />
who relatively are least able to look after themselves.<br />
Because if we didn't have tight policies now then the<br />
Australian dollar would collapse and interest rates would<br />
then go through the roof and they'd be very much worse off<br />
and the economy as a whole would be. So I repeat, I have a<br />
very deep feeling of concern that those people who are not<br />
terribly well off are bearing a pretty tough burden at the<br />
moment. The second thing that's one category of what I<br />
say the second, of course, is to remind them that as from<br />
the beginning of next month and the matter now of only a<br />
Scouple of weeks away, those significant tax cuts will be<br />
coming through and those tax cuts, in the average case, will<br />
more than compensate for the increase in interest rates,<br />
interest repayments, that are involved in these higher<br />
rates. I just ask people to understand that and then if we<br />
together can see this fairly tight period through, then<br />
we'll be able to see a situation where there'll be a<br />
reduction in the interest rate situation. But we've got to<br />
see it through now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, was this this afternoon<br />
that your Government had spoken to the Chinese Government<br />
seeking safe passage for two dissidents in the Embassy<br />
there, does that surprise you? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: As Prime Minister, if anything has happened rather than<br />
a report of what's happened, anything that has happened of<br />
which I'm aware, by definition, doesn't surprise me. Now<br />
I'm not putting this particular report into any of those<br />
categories. Where I know about a thing it, by definition,<br />
doesn't surprise me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you had any<br />
PM: But I mean, I'm not trying to be funny or elliptical in<br />
this. I hope you'll appreciate that where you're talking<br />
about a delicate situation now where there may be people<br />
seeking assistance, it doesn't help anyone. It doesn't help<br />
anyone or relations between the countries to speculate or<br />
talk about it. So I'm not trying to do anything other than<br />
to be responsible in this situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: President Bush hadn't been able to get through<br />
to the Chinese leadership. Have you had any response?<br />
PM: Well I haven't had any response to my letter yet. The<br />
letter was sent for delivery to our Embassy earlier this<br />
week, and, well at the end of last week, and I have not any<br />
information yet as to whether the Premier has actually got<br />
it. I hope and assume he has by now, but there's certainly<br />
no indication at this stage of any response.<br />
JOURNALIST: If these reports this afternoon are correct,<br />
presumably you're concerned about potential trade<br />
implications with China?<br />
PM: That's not at the forefront of my mind. I mean you've<br />
got to in these sort of situations if they were to arise<br />
you've got to look at the rights and prospects of<br />
individuals concerned. You can't ignore that. You can't<br />
put trading considerations up there as a barrier to a<br />
consideration of individual human rights. You've got to<br />
take all those considerations into account. We'll do that.<br />
ends </p>
