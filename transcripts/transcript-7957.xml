PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGODUTLELVR CHECK AGAINST<br />
DELIVERY SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FAREWELL TO HMAS SYDNEY, TOBRUK AND OXLEY<br />
FREMANTLE 14 MARCH 1990<br />
Lord Mayor of Perth,<br />
Mayor of Fremantle,<br />
Minister for Police, Graham Edwards,<br />
Parliamentary Colleagues,<br />
Men and Women of the Royal Australian Navy,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
We are here today to farewell the crew of HMAS SYDNEY and<br />
HMAS TOBRUK. They have a rendezvous with history.<br />
On 25 April, with the crew of HMAS OXLEY, they will have<br />
the honour to represent Australia and the Royal<br />
Australian Navy at the Dardanelles for the seventy-fifth<br />
anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli.<br />
Friends, Many of the great landmarks of Australia's unfolding<br />
story are inscribed with the names of ships and fleets<br />
from the eleven little ships of the First Fleet in 1788:<br />
to the vast armada of ocean liners which, after 1946,<br />
throughout the fifties and into the sixties, brought<br />
countless thousands of families to their new home, to a<br />
new life of hope and freedom in Australia. For most of<br />
them, Fremantle was the first Australian port of call.<br />
But in all this story written upon the seas, nothing<br />
matches, as the embodiment of a young nation's pride, its<br />
hopes and fears, the voyage undertaken 75 years ago,-and<br />
symbolised by the journey which SYDNEY and TOBRUIK begin<br />
today. The world had not seen such a voyage before. Its<br />
uniqueness is evident from the vivid description of the<br />
Official War Historian: </p>
<p>" From 24 October 1914, there began to arrive in King<br />
George's Sound, the great, safe, lonely harbour of Albany<br />
in the south-western concern of Australia, transport<br />
after transport, carrying men, horses, guns. At 6.45 a. m.<br />
on 1 November, the Orient l iner QRYIrD, carrying General<br />
William Bridges, his staff, and over one -thousand men<br />
from Melbourne, led the transports out from the harbour<br />
heads. The twenty-six Australian transports formed up<br />
first, in three diviaions, steaming par-&amp; lle), with a mile<br />
between them. The ten New Zealand ships in two similar<br />
divisions foll~ owed, and the warships escorted. Two days<br />
later, two Western Australian trans~ ports, out of<br />
Fremantle, met the fleet at sea. Then, with the British<br />
cruiser MIQTAUI five miles ahead, the IBUK1 arid<br />
MELFIQURL1E four iilas out on either beam, and the SYD FY<br />
far astern, the thirty-eirght transports, ( carrying some<br />
thirty thlousand men and eight thousand liorsts) headed for<br />
Suez en route to England".<br />
We know, of course, that momentous decisions were even<br />
then being made in London, which changed the plan and<br />
led, ii~ timately, to the Dardenelles campaign.<br />
Before new orders were received, HMAS SYDNE~ Y, on<br />
9 November 1914, pursued and destroyed the German raider<br />
EMDEN off the Cocos Islands, allowing the convoy to<br />
proceed unchallenged across the Indian Ocean.<br />
But as a result of the new orders, the voyage ended at<br />
Alexandria on 3 December, and the ANZACS disembarked to<br />
complete their training in Egypt.<br />
Thus it happened, that an army of young Australians,<br />
drawn from every part of a Commonwealth brought into<br />
being only fourteen years previously, encamped in the<br />
shadow of the Pyramids, in the same place where the<br />
armies of Alexander, Caesar and Napoleon had camped<br />
before. Six months after they sailed from home, they were to land<br />
on Gallipoli. Nearly 8,000 of them were to fall there.<br />
Next month, when we assemble to commemorate the<br />
anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove, in the<br />
honoured presence of a significant number of First AIF<br />
veterans, we will be thinking deeply about the true<br />
memning of ANZAC, its meaning for the life and spirit of<br />
this nation.<br />
But let it be said at once:<br />
in honouring the immense sacrifice of Gallipoli, we in no<br />
way glorify war.<br />
Nor do we seek to justify the immeasurable tragedy of the<br />
First World War, still working its way through human<br />
history, in the tremendous events re-shaping Europe<br />
today. </p>
<p>Yet there can be no doubt as to the profound and enduring<br />
impact Gallipoli and all it stands for, has had on this<br />
nation, from the first moment the electrifying news<br />
reached Australia.<br />
But I suggest, my friends and fellow Australians, that<br />
the source of Gallipoli's power to grip the imagination<br />
and stir the spirit of the nation, lies deeper, much<br />
deeper, than Australian pride in courage, endurance, and<br />
prowess in battle, deeper even than the sense of so much<br />
loss and waste.<br />
And I believe that the heart of its meaning can be<br />
discerned, if we reflect for a moment on the very purpose<br />
of our meeting here today to farewell the crews of<br />
SYQNEY, TOQBRUK, and OXi-PY, as they leave home.<br />
The Official War historian, the late Charles Bean, takes<br />
us to the heart of the matter when he asks the question:<br />
" What motives sustained the Anzacs?'<br />
And giving his answers, he wrote this:<br />
" The love of country in the Australians was intense-hQx<br />
satrong, they did not realine until they werA far away<br />
frnm their home:"<br />
This, I believe, leads us to a deep truth about the place<br />
of the Anzacs in the development of this nation and its<br />
sense of national identity, its nationhood.<br />
In those terrible years, 1914 1918, Australians, some<br />
four hundred thousand of them by the end all volunteers<br />
by no means, all of them born here, and fewer still<br />
with parents born here came together; and for the first<br />
time, shared a common endeavour, a common adventure, a<br />
common danger, a common sacrifice not as Western<br />
Australians or South Australians, not as Queenslanders or<br />
Tasmanians but as Australians.<br />
And bonding this splendid company of young Australians<br />
together, in an unbreakable mateship, was the very fact<br />
that they were all so far from home swept, almost<br />
inexplicably, by great tides of history, thousands of<br />
miles from home, thousands of miles of ocean from all<br />
they knew and loved.<br />
And for the first time, Australians, not just as<br />
individuals, but as a nation, came to realise how much<br />
they loved Australia, their home. And sixty thousand of<br />
them were never to come home.<br />
It is this that gives Gallipoli and all that followed its<br />
almost unbearable poignancy. </p>
<p>4<br />
It is this that gives it its true meaning, as a seed<br />
event in the growth of the Australian national<br />
consciousness, and therefore an imperishable place in the<br />
story of our nation.<br />
And this is something, I believe, which gives a special<br />
meaning, an added significance, to this occasion today.<br />
Not only to farewell the men of HMAS SYDNEY, TOBRUK and<br />
OXLEY, and the men and women from HMAS KUTTABUL who will<br />
sail on the TOBRUK in the wake of that memorable convoy<br />
of 75 years ago<br />
but to wish you safe return to the nation you<br />
help to guard<br />
a safe return home, to our beloved country. i : 4 7 </p>
