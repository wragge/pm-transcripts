    <content><![CDATA[<p>-4BAGO AGAINST DELIVERY:-STATEN{ ENT BY THfE PRIT\ E 1\ INISTER6<br />EY1TECTED ABOUT 8.00 p. m. THlE APPOINTMENT OF MR JUSTICE R. 11. FOX<br />AS ARBASSADOR-AT-L&amp; RGE<br />I wish -to inform the House -that the Government<br />has decided to appoint Mr Justice Fox as Ambassador-at-large<br />for a period of twelve months. Mr Justice Fox's primary role<br />will be to represent Australia overseas in international<br />endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation<br />regime. He will represent the Government at international<br />forums and in other initiatives dealing with nuclear nonproliferation<br />and nuclear safeguards.<br />Mr Justice Fox was the Presiding Commissioner of<br />the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry established by the<br />previous Government. After the Inquiry completed its final<br />report in May 1977, Mr Justice Fox, on my reqjuest, pursued<br />enquiries overseas relating to nuclear non-proliferation and<br />safeguards. He has recently returned from this overseas visit<br />during which he consulted more than 200 people representing<br />overseas agencies and individual interests in various<br />countries, amongst others the EEC countries, Sweden, Austria,<br />Brazil, the United States, Canada and Japan, regarding safeguirds<br />against nuclear weapons proliferation and has reported to me<br />on those discussions. I regard Mr Justice Fox's advice as important in<br />enabling the Government to pursue the most effective policy<br />against the spread of nuclear weapons which is a matter of<br />great international concern, and -the most effecti ve arrangements<br />to remove the international instability associated with the<br />spread of sensitive nuclear technology.<br />6 -1,</p>
<p>It is clear from what he ha. s told me that there<br />is developoing a g-reater international awa reness of the<br />importance of preventing proliferation of nuclear weapons.<br />There are many international initiatives being developed<br />in which Australia must be prepared to play its part.<br />One of the most important is the International Nuclear<br />Fuel Cycle Evaluation which is being undertaken on the<br />initiative of the President of the United States. It will<br />evaluate all parts of the present nuclear fuel cycle with<br />the aim of strengthening technology against diversion of<br />nuclear materials to weapons use. It will also examine how.<br />the nuclear power industry might best be structured to procure<br />this result and to operate in the safest possible manner.<br />Mr Justice Fox as Ambassador-at-large will be<br />leading the Australian Delegation to the opening meeting<br />in Washington on-19-20 October of the International Fuel<br />Cycle Evaluation. Mr Justice Fox's leadership will ensure<br />that Australia will contribute to the international fuel cycle<br />evaluation to the maximum extent that its international<br />position and technical expertise in nuclear matters will<br />permit. He will also give policy advice to the Government<br />respecting bilateral-safeguards agreements and on the nonproliferation<br />aspects of commercial contracts for the sale<br />of uranium. Mr Justice Fox, with his background and experiente<br />in this field so well demonstrated by the breadth and quality<br />of the Reports of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry<br />has indicated that he is prepared to accept this task, a task<br />which is most important for Australia. / 3</p>
<p>The appointment demons trates -the -tremendous<br />concern which tho Government has for problems relating' to<br />nuclear weapons proliferation and its determination -to do<br />everything possible -to ensure the safest possible sa-feuiards<br />arrangements around the world. The Government greatly<br />appreciates the Judge being able to make himself available<br />for this most important international endeavour and is<br />grateful to his Honour for accepting this appointment.<br />In accordance with past practice where members of<br />the judiciary have been appointed to executive officers,<br />for example, the appointment of Mr Justice A. E. Woodward<br />when a Judge of the Australian Industrial Court to be<br />Director-General of Security, Sir Owen Dixon, then a Justice<br />of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to the United<br />States and Sir John Latham while Chief Justice of the High<br />Court, to be Australiam Minis-ter to Japan, the Government<br />proposes to introduce legislation -to enable Mr Justice Fox<br />to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach<br />to that status while Ambassadlor-at-large.<br />The Government also proposes to introduce legislation<br />to increase the number of Judges of the A. C. T. Supreme Cou rt<br />from three to four -to allow -the Court to operate as necessary<br />at its present strength during -the period of Mr Justice Fox's<br />appointment as Ambassador-at-large.<br />His Honor has advised me that particularly having<br />regard to the administrative nature of his duties as<br />Chief Justice and indeed the doubt that this assignment<br />will-be completed within a year he proposes to resign as<br />Chief Justice.</p>
