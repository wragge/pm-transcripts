PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY MICHAEL WILLESEE FOR<br />
" WILLESEE AT SEVEN" PROGRAMME<br />
Willesee Prime Minister, thanks for coming in. N''<br />
J<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
Willesee Well, how do you react to rotten vegetables, eggs and manure?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
And also potatoes.<br />
Willesee And potatoes.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is the sort of thing that should not happen in Australia.<br />
People ought to be able to go and express a point of view in<br />
any Australian environment, and I believe, be heard. Now this<br />
is something that makes, obviously, free speech very difficult.<br />
But it also something that causes enormous inconvenience. It<br />
causes danger, and in the case of the old people's home at<br />
Fitzroy where there are a number of frail-aged needing nursing<br />
home care, it caused an enormous amount of concern to the inmates.<br />
Willesee What happened yesterday?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, I was asked to go and open a nursing home in Fitzroy,<br />
from the Melbourne City Mission. They have said, before the<br />
event, that they would have asked whoever was the Prime Minister.<br />
It happens to be the first nursing home that has been built<br />
in Fitzroy that in itself is something of a criticism because<br />
it is an area where that kind of facility is much needed. It<br />
has cost about $ 1 million. There is a large of Government money<br />
in it. Then, the Fitzroy Council said that they were going to<br />
boycott it. A Fitzroy Councillor made some statements about a<br />
large demonstration; that he could not guarantee that the<br />
demonstration would be peaceful. It was boycotted by Mr. Innes,<br />
and State and Federal Labor politicans in effect. There was a<br />
great deal of concern amongst the people running the Melbourne<br />
City Mission, and a great deal of concern amongst people running<br />
that particular nursing home and the patients in the nursing home.<br />
I would have thought it was an apolitical occurrence; a cause<br />
that is not political in itself, but one which all Australians<br />
could support the provision of better facilities for Australia's<br />
elderly people. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Willesee What actually happened when you got there?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
When we got there: or before we g ot there, people had to move<br />
from an open-air environment in a car park and the opening<br />
ceremony was held within the church itself, so it would be secure.<br />
Because people were going to be throwing vegetables and whatever,<br />
it would have been very insecure, and I believe, positively<br />
dangerous, especially for some of the elderly people, if the<br />
opening had-been held on the outside. So, that moved into the<br />
church. Tamie and myself arrived a little later to give them<br />
time for that movement. The police were handling matters well.<br />
We got inside, but not before we had both been pelted by various<br />
missiles. Then, the opening ceremony went on. There was an<br />
inspection of the building. A great deal of noise; more people<br />
gathered; a lot of difficulty for the police. None of that I saw<br />
because I was inside and they were outside. But I understand it<br />
was captured by the television cameras. I also understand there<br />
were some very nasty and unpleasant incidents. A lot of noise,<br />
a lot of shouting, a lot of sloganeering going on, all during the<br />
ceremony. Willesee Do you know who these people are?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not in detail. No. A report is being prepared for me, as is<br />
normal in these circumstances: the organisations that might be<br />
involved. But we do know that the Fitzroy City Council passed<br />
a motion deploring the fact that I had been asked to go, and<br />
that it was plain that some members at least or at least one<br />
member of that Council was helping to organ ' ise a meeting and<br />
members of the Australian Labor Party, State and Federal,<br />
boycotted the opening.<br />
Willesee Have you yet seen security reports?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Not in relation to it. No, I have not. I have asked for a report<br />
to be prepared; as soon as it is ready. Before the event of<br />
course, there was advice that there was going to be a demonstration<br />
but the advice also was that it would probably be a peaceful<br />
demonstration. Well, that advice was very wrong.<br />
Willesee But they must have known a month in advance to take the people<br />
into the hall, into the church? / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That decision was made about 10 minutes before I was due<br />
to arrive. A large number of people had arrived by that time.<br />
Willesee Would you take Mrs. Fraser again, knowing that was going<br />
to happen?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I asked my own office to go through my engagements and to<br />
make an assessment about whether or not Mrs. Fraser ought to<br />
be with me on the engagements that have already been accepted.<br />
So far as I am concerned, if I am asked to do something and it<br />
fits into the programme and I think it is something that I<br />
ought to do, then I believe I have got to do it. Because I<br />
do not believe that any Prime Minister of this country should<br />
allow a mob, a riot, violence of that kind, to run him of f the<br />
track. You cannot have some ground in Australia which is<br />
too unsafe for a Prime Minister to walk over, or to visit.<br />
We cannot have that kind of country here.<br />
Willesee And yet there is the danger of violence begetting violence,<br />
isn't there?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think there is. But if people have a difference with me on<br />
political matters and I know well enough there are a large<br />
number that have that, as there would be in free society, and<br />
that is to be expected but let them argue it in the Parliament.<br />
Let them argue it with words. Let them argue it with reason. I<br />
believe that violence is the hallmark of those who have no<br />
reason, who have no arguments, who are morally and intellectually<br />
defeated, and therefore can only resort to the tactics of the<br />
thug and the bully. Surely, that Fitzroy City Council should<br />
have deplored violence. Surely, the Australian Labor Party and<br />
Mr. Innes as a person who had been asked to go to the meeting<br />
should have deplored the violence.<br />
Willesee Are you per sonally concerned that what is rotten fruit today<br />
may be something a little harder tomorrow?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That process has already started. It started off as eggs and<br />
tomatoes. Potatoes did not land on a mark, but potatoes thrown<br />
over 50 or 60 yards could land quite heavily, especially on<br />
somebody who is old and frail. They could land very, very<br />
hard indeed. I think that what has happened does pose a problem<br />
for those who are concerned with the safety of various people and<br />
the safety of organisations in these circumstances. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Willesee Do you have any plans to combat that?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Let me only say it is being examined right at this moment,<br />
as a result of what happened yesterday.<br />
Willesee<br />
What is your personal reaction?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
One of sadness that this could happen in Australia. Look, I know<br />
we play our politics ruggedly, roughly maybe, if you like. But<br />
I would hoped also, that it can be played in a forthright way,<br />
with people expressing views, ruggedly, but in the proper forum.<br />
Australians ought not to take this kind of politics to the streets.<br />
They really ought to turn their backs upon it and condemn totally<br />
anyone who has anything to do with it. It is un-Australian, in<br />
its origin and in its practice.<br />
Willesee There are those cynical enough to suggest that it is not harmful<br />
to you in an election year. What do you say to that?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Why is it that violence always seem to be against my side of<br />
politics? Is that an accident, or is it organised? There is<br />
no politics in violence if violence is condemned. The<br />
Australian Labor Party has a capacity to condemn violence if they<br />
wish to. They have a capacity to disassociate themselves from it,<br />
by word and by' deed. Mr. Innes had originally accepted that<br />
invitation to go to that particular opening of that old people's<br />
home yesterday. He refused, presumably, once he heard of the<br />
resolution through the Fitzroy Council, and once he heard there<br />
was going to be a demonstration. He needs to ask, was he happier<br />
to organise, or help in organising a demonstration if that is<br />
what he was doing, or would he have preferred to be at the opening<br />
and see the work and committment of a large number of very fine<br />
Australians. Willesee Mr. Prime Minister, thanks for talking with us.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Thank you. 000---</p>
