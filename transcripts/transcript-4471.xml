~ AUSTRALIA,<br />
FOR PRESS 19 AUGUST 1977<br />
IMPROVED COMMUNITY INTERPRETER SERVICES<br />
The Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Malcolm Fraser, said today<br />
that the Government had considered the report of an interdepartmental<br />
working party on interpreters and translators which was tabled in<br />
Parliament on 22 February 1977. The Government has decided<br />
to provide an additional amount of $ 200,000 in 1977-78, in order<br />
that further services may be provided in this area.<br />
" The provision of. these additional funds is evidence of my<br />
Government's c-oncern for the many migrants from non-English<br />
speaking countries who experience difficulties because of<br />
an inadequate knowledge of the English language", Mr Fraser aid.<br />
The Telephone Interpreter Service, now operating successfully<br />
in all.. mainland capitals, will be progressivel~ y introduced in<br />
other centres, commencing with Wollongong this financial year.<br />
A matter of particular concern is the need to improve arrangements<br />
and facilities within Commonwealth departments to assist in<br />
overcoming communication barriers with government clients.<br />
Measures to be progressively introduced in Commonwealth<br />
departments include the identification of jobs requiring<br />
bilinqual staff, keeping records of the language skills of<br />
departmental staff and the display of multi-lingual signs in<br />
all public contact offices.<br />
The Government. dill also be taking action to:<br />
investigate the language needs of Aboriginals; and<br />
examine ways in which services may be provided through<br />
voluntary and ethnic organisations.<br />
On tabling the report in Parliament, the Prime Minister said that<br />
he had sent copies to the State Premiers and invited their comments.<br />
Mr Fraser said he has written again to the Premiers to establish<br />
joint Commonwealth/ State Working Committees. When established<br />
these Committees will provide a means of identifying local needs<br />
and coordinating the activities of the various agencies involved<br />
in the provision of interpreting and translating services.<br />
The Prime Minister emphasised that the Government was concerned<br />
to improve interpreting and translating provisions to the extent<br />
permitted by available resources. It was also necessary in a<br />
period of financial restraint that action be taken to ensure that<br />
any assistance provided was made available first -to those<br />
most in need. This was particularly relevant in thc provision of<br />
community interpreters at Government expense.<br />
