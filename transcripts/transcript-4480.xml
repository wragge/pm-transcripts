FOR PRESS 31 AUGUST 1977<br />
REVIEW OF POST-ARRIVAL PROGRAMMES AND SERVICES TO MIGRANTS<br />
The Government has decided to establish a review of post-arrival<br />
programmes and services provided to migrants by the Commonwealth.<br />
and non-Government organisations supported by Commionwealth<br />
funding.<br />
The Review Group will be headed by Mr. F. Galbally, a<br />
prominent Melbourne barrister.<br />
The Review will commence immediately, and its first meeting will<br />
be in Canberra tomorrow, September 1.<br />
The Government is conscious of the special lancauage, housinT,<br />
employment and other difficulties faced by migrants during<br />
transition from one society to another.<br />
Migrants themselves want to be involved in developing the types<br />
of post arrival services and programmes which can assist in happy<br />
settlement, overcome day to day difficulties and help prevent<br />
serious welfare and other long term problems.<br />
The Revie w provides an opportunity for migrants to participate<br />
in identifying the problems and difficulties and in designing<br />
programmes relevant to the needs of today's migrants.<br />
The aim of the Review is to make sure the changing needs of<br />
migrants are being met as.-effectively as possible.<br />
The Bailey Task Force in its first report recommended that there<br />
be a review of the functions and future role of Good Neiahbour<br />
Councils. The Good Neighbour Councils themselves have called<br />
for a review, and there have been requests from ethnic<br />
orqanisations. In accepting that there should be a review, the Government has<br />
decided that it should be set in the broader context of reviewing<br />
the effectiveness of the Commonwealth's programmes and services<br />
for those who have micrrated to Australia and the assistance it<br />
aives to non-Government organisations providing programmes and<br />
services to migrants. / The emphasis </p>
<p>2<br />
The emphasis will be on seeking better and more effective<br />
services to migrants within existing financial allocations<br />
rather than on greater expenditure.<br />
It will, of course, be essential in the conduct of the Review<br />
that all migrants have an opportunity to contribute. Submissions<br />
will be invited from the general public and from organisations,<br />
and the Review panel will be seeking the views of as many<br />
migrants and migrant groups as possible.<br />
Mr. Galbally is eminently suited to the task of heading the<br />
Review. He has had a long and continuing interest in the legal<br />
and broader problems of migrants, and has three times been<br />
decorated by the Italian Governmentin recognition of his<br />
services to migrants of Italian origin.<br />
Other members of the group will-be Miss F. Merenda,-M. B. E., a<br />
migrant welfare worker who is well known in both the Italian<br />
and the Australian communities in Sydney; Mr. N. Polites of<br />
Melbourne, a migrant social worker who is active in the Greek<br />
community and Stransky of Perth, a schoolteacher and. former<br />
Field Officer of the Good Neighbour Council who was born in<br />
Jugoslav territory and who has been active in interpreting<br />
and ethnic radio.<br />
The Review will report finally to me in six months. </p>

SERVICES TO MIGRANTS<br />
Preamble In the light of the Government's concern to ensure<br />
that the changing needs of migrants are being met as<br />
effectively as possible within the limits of available<br />
resources, it has been decided to establish a Review of<br />
existing post-arrival programs and services. The Review is<br />
to be conducted with regard to the Government's Federalism<br />
policy and ' its objective of encouragiig self-help and<br />
supporting the enterprise and dedication of community groups<br />
and individuals in the provision of such programs and services.<br />

effectiveness of the Commonwealth's programs and services for<br />
those who have migrated to Australia, including programs and<br />
services provided by non-government organisations which receive<br />
Commonwealth assistance, and shall identify any areas of need<br />
or duplication of programs or services. In doing so, the<br />
Review shallexamine welfare and other programs and services<br />
( including in the fields of health, housing,<br />
education and employment insofar as these bear<br />
on the social welfare of migrants);<br />

and services are being provided by other levels<br />
of government and oth~ er non-government organisations..-<br />
2. In particular the Review shall consider:<br />

non-government organisations respectively, and<br />
the appropriate relationship between them which<br />
would ensure the most effective planning and<br />

which programs and services available to the<br />
general community could be better designed to<br />
* ensure that migrants ( especially non-English<br />
speaking migrants) are as well served as others7<br />
which special programs for migrants could be<br />
better integrated wrth, or absorbed into, those<br />
for the general community;<br />
the extent to which migrants may be disadvantaged<br />
through lack of awareness of programs and services<br />
and the difficulties experienced in gaining access<br />
to them7 </p>
<p>the appropriateness of the role and organisation,<br />
and the effectiveness of the operations of the<br />
Good Neighbour Councils, having regard to the<br />
changing needs and composition of the migrant<br />
community; the roles of other non-government organisations<br />
providing significant services to migrants, and<br />
their inter-relationships including with Good<br />
Neighbour Councils;<br />
the role of the Commonwealth in funding non--<br />
government organisations providing services<br />
to migrants and the most appropriate arrangements<br />
for any such funding.<br />
3. The Review is to take account of current or recent<br />
relevant inquiries, including in particular:<br />
the Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and<br />
Health; the Inquiry into Education and Training;<br />
