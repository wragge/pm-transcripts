Australian History Guide; parliament  </p>
<p>E&amp;OE...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen I am announcing this morning the release of the guide to the teaching of Australian history and this represents the culmination of work and a campaign that I commenced almost two years ago to bring back proper, rigorous teaching of Australian history in our schools. And I will be writing to the Premiers and Chief Ministers of the states and territories, forwarding a copy of the history guide and indicating that with effect from the beginning of 2009, the Commonwealth will be requiring the teaching of Australian history as a stand alone subject for years nine and 10 in all schools throughout Australia. This is something that I have been committed to for a very long time. I believe that this country has badly neglected the teaching of Australian history. We have lapsed into teaching it in accordance with a very uncoordinated, haphazard, thematic approach instead of doing it with a proper regard to the narrative and the unfolding and compelling story of Australia. The guide will divide the teaching of Australian history into a number of periods, naturally commencing with the period when this country was occupied by the indigenous people of Australia, the first Australians and culminating with a study of contemporary times. I want to express my thanks to the reference group, which built on the earlier work of Associate Professor Tony Taylor. The Reference Group consisted of Professor Geoffrey Blainey, Dr Nicholas Brown, Dr Gerard Henderson and Mrs Elizabeth Ward. The guide is being released as I speak and I believe that it will provide a comprehensive set of signposts, milestones, for the teaching of Australian history. I think it is quite shameful that in some parts of Australia and in some schools, although it does vary quite significantly around the country, the teaching of Australian history is no longer a stand-alone subject and we have adopted a very indifferent, a very complacent attitude towards it. Now I am very proud that this work, which has been going on now for some time, has culminated with the release of this guide and I believe that the states, if they look to the interests of the education of our children will very strongly support what the Government is doing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you're releasing this in New South Wales where there is already a stand alone teaching of history in years nine and 10. Isn't that reinventing the wheel?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry I didn't hear that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that not a question of reinventing the wheel?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, I am just; sorry I can't hear you because of the plane.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it a question of reinventing the wheel in a state like New South Wales where there is already...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Australia is more than New South Wales and this is a guide for schools everywhere in Australia. I believe that the teaching of history is taken more seriously in New South Wales schools than it is in other parts of the country and to the extent that the guide is already essentially followed in New South Wales, well that is a good thing. I am not seeking to have an argument with the states about this. I am not seeking to have an argument with them at all. What I am seeking to do is to enlist their cooperation and I have had discussions about Australian history with the former Premier of New South Wales who was quite interested in it and one of the former Education Ministers in the state. This ought not to be something that brings forth a partisan political debate. I would have thought both sides of politics are interested in and would support a rigorous, intellectually sound teaching of Australian history. I would have thought everybody would be in favour of that. So... and can I just remind you that the History Summit that was held in 2006 was attended by Mr Carr. He was one of the people that I invited to attend the summit, because I knew of his interest in Australian history. So I am not seeking a political argument with anybody on this, but I am determined though that Australian history, the story of our nation, properly taught, properly organised into the various periods of our compelling story; I am determined that that would be a stand alone subject in Australian schools for years nine and 10 because I think it is essential. How can we understand where we want to take ourselves if we don't understand from where we have come? It's absolutely fundamental that we do this and I would hope to enlist the support of both sides of politics. I don't want history to be taught in a partisan way. I don't want a Liberal version of history any more than I want a Labor version of history. I just want an accurate version of history. I want us to understand our triumphs as well as understanding our failures of our blemishes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, while that plane is going overhead, how determined are you to get the states on board? Are you that determined that you might link it to funding, future state funding in education?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have indicated that it will be part of the funding negotiations but look, we shouldn't have an argument about that. I mean I just can't see how any sensible thinking Education Minister or Premier, whether he or she is Labor or Liberal, I can't understand why they would be opposed to the proper teaching of the history of our country. It belongs to all of us in schools.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How linked will it be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I mean how linked will it be? If someone says, if one of the states comes back and says no...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look I am an optimist. I am hopeful that they won't do that. But we have made it clear that it will be part of the funding negotiation. We've said that. But we believe that they will come on board because it makes sense. I mean I can't believe that any state Premier does not want a proper teaching of history and it does vary around the country. In some parts of Australia it's not taught as a stand alone subject. In fact in most states it's not. In other states it's taught in a very haphazard fashion. It is taught in a more organised fashion in New South Wales, but it varies around the country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is Professor Taylor pleased with your final report?  I believe he referred to it as overly prescriptive?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the nature of these things is that you never get unanimity amongst academics, it's quite impossible to get unanimity academics and everybody likes to have their own point of view accepted to the nth degree.  Professor Taylor did some wonderful work, I don't think anybody can doubt the credentials of the four people that were on the reference group.  Professor Blainey, in my view, is the most eminent historian in Australia.  I think the other people who contributed to the reference group, their reputations are very high and they're reputations that I think have been brought to bear on the preparation of this guide.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Aboriginal history, would you see that as something that's been neglected over the years and generations in Australian schools?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think earlier it was, yes.  I don't think we taught it when I was at school, I wasn't taught much about Aboriginal history.  I think it has been neglected over the years but it's got to be taught as part of a narrative. What I think has been wrong with the teaching of history is that we're taught issues and themes and not adopted a narrative approach. You can't understand what's happened to our country unless you understand the great events, you have to have some understanding of time and continuity, you have to have some understanding of the impact of major world events and you need to have a greater focus and I think this has been neglected for a long time in the teaching of Australian history in many parts of the country.  You've got to have a better understanding of the forces that brought the colonies together prior to Federation.  They're the sort of things that we need, along with all the other great events in Australia history that we need to understand.  You need to understand the impact of the Great Depression on Australia, the colossal tragedy of World War I for Australia, the huge change that occurred to Australia after World War II with economic expansion, national development and mass migration from, initially, Europe.  All of those things are part of a continuity, but you start with the indigenous people and... recognising that they are the first people of this country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will parliament return next week?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's scheduled to meet.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, on a separate matter, Mr Rudd's made a comment on four year fixed terms and a possible referendum.  Do you think there's a mood for change...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When you say a possible referendum, well if Mr Rudd has a particular proposal I'm not aware of it.  You say it's a possible referendum?  Has he actually said if elected he will hold a referendum?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He said he'd like four year fixed terms.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, he said he'd like them.  I mean, I'd like four year terms.  I don't believe in fixed terms, I believe in a parliamentary system in, I mean, my ideal would be to have a longer parliament but I think that's a bit academic on the eve of an election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think there's a mood for change in the electorate though in terms of four year fixed...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have to tell you that you're the first person who's raised it with me in three months.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any legislation that you need to pass in Canberra next week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's always legislation, but parliament is scheduled to meet next week.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much will it cost for parliament to return next week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well parliament, if it meets, that will involve some expense but you do have to pay for democracy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When will the MPs know if they're definitely returning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, parliament is scheduled to meet next week.  I think we're playing games. Ok.</p>
