    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Right Honourable John Key, will visit Australia from March 1 to 2.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have long enjoyed a strong relationship founded on a unique shared history and outlook.</p>
<p>The intensity of our ties has been underscored vividly by the support and sympathy of the New Zealand people during the Victorian bushfires.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand are also close economic partners.</p>
<p>New Zealand is Australia's seventh-largest trading partner and our third-largest destination for investment overseas.</p>
<p>Official discussions are expected to focus on:</p>
<p>     * revitalising work to drive further economic integration through the establishment of a single economic market across the Tasman;</p>
<p>     * cooperation on Pacific and regional affairs; and,</p>
<p>     * key international challenges and opportunities for the two nations, including tackling the global economic crisis and climate change.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Key to Australia.</p>
<p>The two Prime Ministers have previously met in Lima (APEC) and in Port Moresby (Pacific Island Forum Special Leaders' meeting). </p>
