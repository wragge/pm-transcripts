MR, WHITLAM' S POLICY STATFMhENT<br />
Rr. WhiLaml'g lunch time speech wa-0 a pathetic'cry from a per-son<br />
who could not take the umpires vordict. </p>
<p>The Australijan Constitution provides an umpire to protect tho<br />
people of A-uPtralia in just the kird of emergency that Mr. Whitlam<br />
created. unlike the grocat majority of Austrlians Mr. Whitlam does ot<br />
support the umpire. He cannot take thE-_ Ujipire's decision<br />
when it goes against him. </p>
<p>One of the great questions arising that will probably never<br />
bA answered is whether Mr. Whitlam forced the umpite to act in<br />
thi, way knowing that 1-t would have to or did mr. Whitlam<br />
misjudge the character of". Sir John Kerr, a ri he himself had<br />
app~ ointed to be thJ twkp ire. If it were the forier, what<br />
Mr. wihitlam has done is a deliberate act to destroy our constituional.<br />
safeguards. The action of the Coevrnor General has now Leon endorsed by the<br />
Queen. This i preoisely what I would have expected.<br />
Mr. hitlam wants total power for him-self. He has said tfhe<br />
states should leqisiate themselves out of existence. le ha<br />
said he wans to s-riash the Senate.<br />
qe has made it plain he wants to destroy the office of the Governor<br />
General. </p>
<p>As euvery Liberal and National Country Party Leader around<br />
Australia has said, Mr. Whitmam has taken Australia a significant<br />
-tep along a road to establishing an Australian dictatorship.<br />
Iis speech was the cry of a person who wants such a dictatorship, of<br />
a person who brushes as id Constitutional safeguards and the rights<br />
of the Australian people.<br />
It started when he refused to face the people, when he refused<br />
to go for an election.<br />
Why did he refuse to go to the people? Because he knew they<br />
would condemn him. Rather than face the people he would<br />
sooner destroy the Constitution.<br />
If that is Mr. whitlam's policy speech he will be condemned<br />
Sb ecause there is no policy at all in it. There is no policy<br />
in it to deal with inflation or to deal with unemployment.<br />
There is no policy to deal with the revival of business confidence<br />
which is necessary if Australia is going to work its way out of<br />
the present economic tragedy,<br />
MrY Whitlaim's speech was the speech of a man who is bemused<br />
by his own self righteousness and tragically unable to see the<br />
harm he has done to Australia. It was the speech of a man<br />
unable to see that he is leading the Labor Party to destruction<br />
and annihilation. </p>
