in the United Kingdom and had been closely associated with<br />
recent important overseas developments in tis field.<br />

to over twenty Commonwealth countries, mainly for postgraduate<br />
studies at Australian universities.<br />
Fifty aw,_, rds would be made, tenable from the beginning<br />
of the 1961 academic year, but it was expected that a small<br />
number of students would arrive in Australia shortlyto commence<br />
post-graduate study during 1960.<br />
Furthermore, offers of scholarships had now been received<br />
in Australia from the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand,<br />
