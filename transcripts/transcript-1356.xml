PRIME ITSTER'S VISIT TO U. S. AND U. K.<br />
XCHANGE OF TOASTS . fE-N T. E DENT OF TE UNITED<br />
LUN\ XTLON I Tfi' WHITE H3TJE 14th July, 1966.<br />
Kr. Prime M inister and my friends:<br />
A house twice visited by a good friend is a house twice<br />
blessed. So, Lr. Prime rainister, we welcome you back here to the<br />
White house and we are very grateful that you were able to arrange'<br />
your very busy schedule so as to return and pay us a visit.<br />
While you were away, I spoke to my countrymen, and I hope to<br />
yours also, about the Pacific area that we share with many of our<br />
! sian friends. I said the other night, and i should like to reemphasize<br />
it now, that I believe that the Pacific is the great<br />
testing ground of man's yearning for independence, order, and for a<br />
peaceful and productive life. Prime hinister, if we can win<br />
that test in the Pacific we may very well have won the fruits of<br />
oeace for all of our fellow men in the world we would hope, perhaps,<br />
for all time. But if we lose it in the Pacific, we will have lost<br />
achievement and hope, perhaps, for all time too. -3ut we shall not<br />
lose the test, because A--iericans and Australians and Vietnamese,<br />
Mew Zealanders and Koreans, and our other allies shall prove in the<br />
Pacific that agression cannot succeed on an continent, in any<br />
country, against any people in the world in the 20th century. The<br />
Pacific is not an ocean. It is not a region. It is a crucible<br />
in which the free, proud, and peaceful world of tomorrow is today<br />
moulding and taking its shape. 6o, as we meet here this aftbrnoon,<br />
the winds of hope arc blowing fresh and strong off the Pacific and<br />
they are blowing throughout free Asia. Wo are partners in stirring<br />
that excitement. Yes, Lir. Prime ipinister, the partners in<br />
creating the b1iThn dollar Asian Development Aank. Wo are partners<br />
in developing the ekong iver Delta, in denying those who would<br />
destroy the promise of stability and growth, aiid in encoureging<br />
those who would make that promise a reality. And that is the<br />
reat and urgent work that, after your extremely important meetings<br />
in London and here, you will return to Australia to advance, ir.<br />
Prime inister. So today you leave us, not only as our trusted<br />
partner and our cherished friend, but as a man who has left much<br />
behind while the bravery and the nobility of the Australian people,<br />
a new generation of Americans, are living the lessons that their<br />
fathers learned.<br />
I see in front of me Captain Stevens, a teacher at West<br />
Point. It was 25 years ago, that I got out of bed in Townsville<br />
one morning about 3 o'clock with Colonel Stevens, with whom I had<br />
roomed. He died that day over Lae and Salamaua. He left a<br />
little five year old boy, who is now this teacher at West Point,<br />
to carry on for him. But we learned that quarter of a century<br />
ago, Mr. Prime Minister, that one can never ask for finer comrades<br />
on the battlefield, or more willing colleagues in the works of<br />
peace than our Pacific brothers, our Australian allies. And so<br />
it is our prayer today that God grant that your young men and ours<br />
will soon return from conflict to enjoy the peace that we seek so<br />
fervently together. And, until they do return, we will stand<br />
shoulder to shoulder supporting them all the way.<br />
So, gentlemen, I should like to ask you to toast that<br />
bright hope and its living symbol, the very able, courageous, and<br />
distinguished Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia,<br />
Mr. Holt. </p>
<p>2.<br />
M1r. President and gentlemen:<br />
Any man who had been honoured by a luncheon given to him by<br />
the President of this great democracy would treasure that as a<br />
memory for a lifetime. To be so honoured twice in so short a<br />
space of time is not merely a great honour to me and my country,<br />
but it has been tremendously gratifying to my colleagues as they<br />
notified me by cable from Australia. What you have done by your<br />
warm gesture, Mr. President, is a further strand strengthening<br />
these close bonds which have developed between us.<br />
Since I was last with you I have been acroos the Atlantic<br />
to London. As you know, my main purposes in coming abroad were<br />
to see you and to develop a warmer and closer, more intimate<br />
relationship with you. You had kindly suggested that, and so, in<br />
his place, had the Prime M~ inister of Great Britain. I have gone<br />
through this process with Harold W-ilson in London. Last Sunday'<br />
night at Chequers, that historic establishment of Britisn Prime<br />
Ministers, after his wife and mine had left us for the evening,<br />
he kicked his shoes off and lay down on a counch and for three<br />
hours we settled the problems of the world. I told him, Mr.<br />
President, that you had been so generous to me that I felt that if<br />
I had asked you for the Statue of Liberty you would have gladly<br />
g iven it to He said " Wdhy didn't you ask hirm for Fort Knox?"<br />
Wll, he may have felt that it would have been handy. But<br />
earlier in that evening he had taken me on a conducted tour<br />
which you w. zere kind enough to do this for me last night at the<br />
w-ijhite House of Chequers. At one point of the establishment<br />
there is a picture by Rernbrandt illustrating the fable of " The<br />
Lion and the Mouse". It is a wonderful picture, of course,<br />
greatly celebrated and beautifully painted. But when Choquers<br />
was occupied by Winston Churchill, Vlntnused to study this.<br />
He was, as you know, an amateur painter. In fact I think he was<br />
almost a professional painter by the fees he got toward the end.<br />
But he studied the picture. Perhaps it was failing eyesight, or<br />
Rembrandt had left something to the imaination, but he said " I<br />
cannot see the mouse". So he painted in the mouse on the picture,<br />
and there it is. And so you have Rembrandt and Churchill on<br />
this particular picturo. But there was a moral in it, of course,<br />
for me. My countrymen won't like me describing them, as mice.<br />
Indood we produce the largest rat in the world. It stumps itself<br />
along and calls itself a kangaroo. But I remember the moral of<br />
the fable was that little friends may prove great friends. In a<br />
sense, my country is a little friend, because there are less than<br />
12 million of us. But I think of the men that this country<br />
produced when there were 2i million of you and you signed the<br />
Declaration of Independence. I have often rnrvelled at the<br />
greatness of the men you produced from that small conmunity at<br />
that time. I think it was Smuts who said that the great countries<br />
are the countries which produce great men, and you produced great<br />
men as early as the period in w-hich you had something less than<br />
2-2 million. Washington, him'self, Jefferson, Franklin, Alexander<br />
Hamiulton. You know the list of them so much better than I. But<br />
these are Lien whose names stand in the cor1non heritage of<br />
democracy and freedom around tho world.<br />
I talked about myself. Perhaps I could return to that for<br />
a moment, because wie have so mny d~ istinguished press representatives<br />
and columnists -and people of that sort here. I had a recent<br />
example in London of how. important correct reporting can be. Ir!<br />
wife was interviewed by the press while she was there and was asked<br />
what she had been doing. Naturally, being the wife of a politician,<br />
she was quite cautious about this. So they asked her if she had<br />
been doing any shopping. You know nothing can embarrass a politician </p>
<p>3.<br />
any more than to have it reported that his wife had been doing a<br />
lot of expensive shopping. So she said that she had bought a<br />
couple of white rice. This was solemnly reported back in<br />
Australia. Then the cables started to flow in the most intriguing<br />
jargon of the Public Service of the Commonwealth, pointing out<br />
that the import of white mice into Australia was prohibited under<br />
our quarantine arrangements; that these white iuce would have to<br />
be exterminated if they arrived. It would be very embarrassing<br />
for all concerned if the wife of the Primie Minister had to be<br />
subjected to this treatment. Now if the press had only added what<br />
was the fact, that these white mice were made of china and were<br />
designed for our grandchildren, then everybody would have been<br />
happy. But I have had, Mr. President, on this journey, memorable<br />
unforgettable, and very stirring experiences. And you, Sir, have<br />
contributed notably to these in ways which my country will not<br />
forget and certainly I shall not. And then in England, of course,<br />
Ihave these memories also.<br />
But one would expect to find some disap pointments along the<br />
way, and I found one here. I found one when Iwent to England.<br />
Perhaps there wore others, but these are the ones I mention. The<br />
disappointment I found here was to discover how little of the total<br />
story of what is going on in the Pacific area was reaching you<br />
through the columns of the press. There was a vivid, dramatic,<br />
day-to-day reporting of the military operations in South Vietnam<br />
and this, I suppose, is the first war which has been fought on a<br />
television screen for most people, and, therefore, not necessarily<br />
the most objectively understood by most people. And so I was<br />
disappointed that, while I knew of the feeling and appreciation that<br />
your own Adm~ inistration has for this area and its problems, and you<br />
have , iven elophent tostiin-on to that in the words you have given to<br />
us this lunchtime, it was to me, I repeat, a disappointment that wie<br />
didn't hear more of what was going on in this area of the world<br />
which contains half the human race, which, by the end of the centu. ry,<br />
will contain rather more than half the human race, because the rate<br />
of increase there is significantly greater than in the area of<br />
Western Europe or even in these United States. But you and your<br />
colleagues have shown your ovin awareness of the problems of that<br />
area and your determination to play a significant part in seeing<br />
those of us who live there through the challenges and through the<br />
opportunities which lie ahead for us. In England I found some<br />
disappointment in the fact that Great Britain, and even more so the<br />
other countries of Western Eurcpe, seem to be almost oblivious to<br />
the existence of that area of the world, almost as if they had quite<br />
deliberately turned their backs upon a large part of life, history,<br />
and experience in these modern tinies, because so much that is<br />
stirring and exciting in these modern times is occurring in this<br />
area of the world. To brine out the best in the people of a country<br />
you need a cause that will stir the pulse. We have, I am glad to<br />
say, several such causes moving in my own country at this time.<br />
The problem of developing a large continent, of brigng people in<br />
from so many different countries, the challenge of great projects<br />
which have to be opened up, the comparatively recent discovery<br />
Perha: s I should, in saying this, mollify what one has said in a<br />
critical vein of these other countries, because it is only in<br />
comparatively recent times that in Australia, have become<br />
conscious and sensitive to the fact that we, by force of qeography<br />
and circumstances and the history of the future, have a significant<br />
place in Asia and, in particular, in the Asia of tomorrow--. These<br />
were the disappointments. </p>
<p>4.<br />
On the other hand, Mr. President, I was to find in the United<br />
Kingdom an expression, by the Prime Minister, of determination to<br />
support your presence in Vict. iun, of recognition of the need for<br />
the two great democracies of the United States and the United<br />
Kingdom to maintain a close ck-oradeship in the affairs of the world.<br />
And you will shortly be vis: t. d by the Prime Minister, again keeping<br />
close and warm the link betm. cn these two democracies whose leadership<br />
means so much to the we. l-being of mankind. But the primary<br />
responsibility of that leadc" hip falls upon you as the head of the<br />
mighty nation which these days loads the free world. It is an<br />
awesome responsibility and it ib fortunate for all of us who value<br />
freedom, the opportunities, c.-d liberties of free men that vie should<br />
have, as the leader of this , reat democracy in turn leading the<br />
free world, a man of your o cco: u rage, character and resolution.<br />
And the lesson that we shall. uarry out to the rest of the world and,<br />
indeed, I know this is the ju'! nent of the Prime Minister of Great<br />
Britain, is that here wve have a man of resolution determined to see<br />
the issues in Vietnam throua to the end, however difficult or long<br />
that task may be. But you ' rid I, as men who have this stirring of<br />
the pulse for the things thati can be done and perhaps because we<br />
come from great open spaces and can draw a big fresh breath from<br />
the country in which we live and breathe, that we tend to take the<br />
long view, perhaps the visionary view. But the visions help to<br />
provide the causes and the causes help to evoke the qualities that<br />
are the best that lie within us. And we share this great cause in<br />
the Asia of the future. This, to me, has been one of the really<br />
heartening experiences of my journey to the Northern Hemisphere<br />
from down under. Here in this country is the resolution to see<br />
the job through where the difficulties lie and eager determination<br />
to take up thEc oopportunities in comradeship and collaboration with<br />
those of us who live in the sroa to make something of Asia which<br />
will mark a new and hopeful phase in the history of mankind.<br />
Mr. President, this is the sort of hope you leave with me<br />
and which I take back to rmy country. And it is a stirring thing.<br />
It is a comforting thing. It is a heartening thing to be ableto<br />
feel that we can go on throu ih the many difficulties which face a<br />
small people in a large continent with hundreds of millions of<br />
people of different race, different history, different tradition,<br />
different religion, different outlook, inmediately about us, but<br />
confidently facing that future, because we believe that in our own<br />
friendship, our own enterprise, our own willingness to join in the<br />
task of Asia, we will build ourselves new friendships that will<br />
see us through the difficulties that we face. And underlying it<br />
all will be the knowledge that we have a friend, a very powerful<br />
friend, whom you sy-bolize on this occasion. Thank you. for meaning<br />
that strength and that inspiration that is heartening to us all.<br />
In that spirit, from Australia, I salute the President of<br />
the United States. </p>
