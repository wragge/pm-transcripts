PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 7TH DECEMBER 1977<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, CANBERRA<br />
Australia is a country of great potential, great promise. To<br />
realise that potential, Australians need a Government whose<br />
policies reflect certain basic beliefs which most Australians<br />
share.,-a resolve to develop our great resources of mineral<br />
wealth and human initiative, and thus to see our nation grow;<br />
a willingness to defend Australians' independence against<br />
great concentrations of power, whether they be union, business<br />
or government bureaucracy; a determination to see justice done<br />
for all Australians, whoever and wherever they may be above<br />
all a belief in the great creative capacity of free people<br />
responding to. a&amp; rapidhy changing world.<br />
only the Liberal-and National Country Party<br />
coalition can provide such a government.<br />
We govern for no class, we are beholden to no special interests,<br />
we govern for all the Australian people. We have, a structure<br />
of Government which combines broad consultation with effective<br />
decision-making.<br />
The Labor Party, by contrast as this campaign has made clear<br />
once again, is so closely tied to a sectional group, the trade<br />
unions, that its clearest policy position is to give trade<br />
unions privileges beyond the law. In addition, as this campaign.<br />
has once again demonstrated, the Labor Party's decision-making<br />
structure renders it incapable of pursuing a stable and sound<br />
economic policy for Australia.<br />
The tests of this campaign have demonstrated the hopeless policy<br />
confusion that characteris~ sthe Labor Party whenever it is put<br />
under pressure. The conflicts and contradictions between Labor's<br />
multiple spokesmen on economic affairs evokes memories of the<br />
conflicts and changes of course when Labor was in office.<br />
Perhaps this in part is the underlying reason for a most<br />
interesting -feazure of current political life. The working men,<br />
and women of Australia, people who have traditionally supported<br />
the Labor Pa-rty, are recognising in growing numbers that the<br />
kind of Australia they want is now best secured by a Liberal/ NCP<br />
Government. They see the Labor Party's approach as completely<br />
destructive of jobs, of opportunities, of prosperity. / 2e </p>
<p>-2-<br />
But the Labor Party's internal conflicts and structure are<br />
only one part of the explanation. Even more fundamental are<br />
the policies Labor has pursued. To take one example tariff<br />
protection. Mr. Whitlam's doctrinaire stand on tariffs,<br />
()] et-roycd so many thousands of jobs when he was in office.<br />
Then Labor deliberately used unemplo'ment ag an instrument of<br />
policy. On Monday Conference two weeks ago, Mr. Uren explained<br />
Mr. Whitlam's 25 per cent acorss the board tariff cut by<br />
saying that it was designed to correct an " over-employment"<br />
situation. Presumably Mr. Whitlam is well satisfied with the<br />
results, for he is once again threatening industries employing<br />
tens of thousands of Australians. Just last week Labor refused<br />
to give the apparel, clothing and footwear manufacturers any<br />
firm support for the next three years.<br />
In response to these industries' request for support, the<br />
ALP's research officer is reported to have said that no such<br />
support could be given because " we are a free trade party".<br />
Unionists know well that a " free trade party" spells disaster<br />
for Australian living standards and maintaining present levels<br />
of employment in iidustry. This Government<br />
has made clear our commitment to protecting the jobs of tens of<br />
thousands of Australia's working men and women in this period<br />
of high unemployment. Our preparedness to give industry the<br />
protection it needs is just a part of our total economic<br />
strategy a strategy which provides the sound basis necessary<br />
to reduce unemployment in Australia.<br />
The unemployment we are suffering is a tragedy which need<br />
never have occurred. It cannot be beaten by any single policy-, by<br />
any gimmick or quick fix. In the last two years, we have<br />
achieved the single most important victory in this fight<br />
breaking the back of inflation. The rate of increase in consumer<br />
prices has now been held below 2.5 per cent in each of three<br />
successive quarters for the first time in four years. This,<br />
together with the investment we have promoted, our restraint of<br />
Government spending, our wages policy, lower interest rates, and<br />
our tax reforms will lead td, unemployment falling from February.<br />
The Labor Party has no anti-inflation strategy it has scarcely<br />
bothered to pretend that it has. How can inflation be reduced<br />
with a strategy based on faster increases in wage costs; higher<br />
personal taxes; higher Government spending; bigger deficits;<br />
and higher interest rates. Taken in conjunction with Mr. Whitlam's<br />
doctrinaire stand on protection, it is a sure-fire prescription<br />
for a massive increase in unemployment. Beyond this the commitments<br />
in the Labor Party's new economic planning platform<br />
adopted only six months ago constitute a full-fronted attack<br />
on our free enterprise system. They are formulated in words<br />
which only the socialist left of the Labor Party could have<br />
dictated. Labor is committed to emphasising or extending " public<br />
enterprise, in particularl,-in the fields of banking, consumer<br />
finance, insurance, marketing, housing, stevedoring, transport<br />
and in areas of anti-social monopoly". </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The implementation of Labor's policies in current economic<br />
circumstances would unquestionably wreak even more havoc<br />
on the Australian economy than did Labor's last experiment.<br />
In ) 972 the Labor Government inherited an economy in which<br />
inflation and unemployment were relatively low. Now by<br />
contrast, our economy is in the process of recovery and thus<br />
would be far more quickly and permanently damaged by Labor's<br />
policies. Mr. Whitlarn's ., economic policies will<br />
not reduce unemployment among working men and women they<br />
will add to it. His tariff policies will again create another<br />
pool of jobless. His wages policies are a recipt for<br />
prolonged unemployment. Mr. Whitlam's Labor Partv is out<br />
of touch with Australia's working men and'women.<br />
It is no wonder that the Government parties in recent years<br />
have been receiving more and more of the votes of Labor's<br />
traditional supporters. Nor is it only in the employment<br />
area that the Government's policies are recognised as being<br />
the kind of policies which are needed by Australia at the<br />
present time. The related area of personal tax reform has<br />
highlighted in this campaign. In recent years major committee<br />
reports to this Government and our predecessors have emphasised<br />
the great importance of personal tax reform for the economic<br />
health of the -naition the Mathews Committee, the Asprey<br />
Committee, the Jackson Committee.<br />
This Government has given high priority to reducing the burden<br />
of personal taxation. We have introduced completely new tax<br />
scales. We have significantly reduced the marginal rates of<br />
tax. We have abolished personal tax for a quarter of a million<br />
low income earners. By 30th June next taxpayees will have saved<br />
the very substantial sum of $ 3,300 million in tax. Our personal<br />
tax reforms'are essential for economic recovery. They further<br />
ease the upward pressures on wages, they restore incentives,<br />
they provide a non-inflationary stimulus to the economy, they<br />
impose responsibility on Government spending. I say without<br />
hesitation that they are the most important series of tax<br />
reforms ever introduced in Australia. They are reforms which<br />
express the basic philosophy of this Government that Australians<br />
should have a greater say in making decisions which affect their<br />
daily lives.<br />
Efficient and constructive Government has a vital role to play<br />
in realising the goals Australians share, and Governments must<br />
levy taxes to meet their responsibilities. Labor governments<br />
however have gone too far in imposing wishes on individuals. They have<br />
impose. ever-increasing taxes. Our tax reforms go a long way<br />
towards redressing the balance between the legitimate needs of<br />
the individual and the state. Mr. Whitlam has a different<br />
philosophy. He has argued on many occasions the virtues of<br />
Government allocation of people's earnings. </p>
<p>reform. For him the old scales, the old high marginal rates,<br />
and vauge and conflicting promises on tax indexation are good<br />
enough for the time being.<br />
Once again the working men and women of Australia are to be asked<br />
to pay their earnings to inflating government and, a new twist,<br />
to large corporations. I am sure ihis approach will be rejected<br />
by most Australians.<br />
There is yet another area of policy, where this campaign has<br />
highlighted the contrast between the positive and constructive<br />
policies of the Government and the total-absnce of constructive<br />
proposals by the Labor Party. That is the area of Trade Union<br />
reform.<br />
At least one survey has shown that an overwhelming majority<br />
of Australians, and of Trade Union members, take the view that<br />
Trade Unions have become too powerful in Australia.<br />
The Government believes that it has a responsibility to<br />
Australians to recognise this concern, and to express it in<br />
a constructive programme of reform. The time for positive<br />
reforms could not be delayed any longer.<br />
Mr. Whitlam, who depends on Trade Union funds and the votes<br />
of Trade Union delegates in Party conferences, naturally<br />
resists any change in this area-unless it be changes increasing<br />
Trade Union power and granting privileges to Union leaders<br />
far beyond that which the law applies to other Australians.<br />
In this area, the apostle of intervention, pursues a policy of<br />
unmitigated laissez-faire.<br />
This Government is committed to establishing the legal framework<br />
within which business operates, within . which. every<br />
organisation and individual must operate. Law which protects<br />
the community interest.-: z<br />
Unlike the Labor Party, we have taken the view that no one can<br />
be above the law; that individual unionists have a right to be<br />
heard, and to be protected from intimidation.<br />
We have proceeded with our industrial legislation reforms of<br />
which I am confident have the support of the Australian people,<br />
and in so doing we have stood firm against threats and intimidation.<br />
Secret postal ballots for union elections are now compulsory.<br />
WVe hcave set up the Industrial Relations Bureau, to protect the<br />
pub1ic interest and also to act as an industrial ombudsman.<br />
Unions : are now required to provide their members with an annual<br />
audited statement of their financial affairs. We are protecting<br />
individuals against being forced to join unions against their<br />
will. We have strenthened the means of dealing with demarcation<br />
disputes, and damaging secondary boycotts have been banned.<br />
All this adds up to a firm and responsible policy which has the<br />
support of responsible unionists, and which protects the rights<br />
of the individual unionist and the public.<br />
Mr. Willis, the Labor spokesman on Industrial Relations, confirmed<br />
last week that Labor would abolish all of these vital reforms,<br />
and indeed abolish other existing protection against union abuse<br />
of power.<br />
4 </p>
<p>Labor would repeal our laws to protect the public from industrial<br />
disruption. Labor would repeal our laws requiring postal<br />
ballots. Labor would exempt unions from the provisions of the<br />
Trade Practices Act. Labor would exempt unions and their members<br />
from civil actions in respect of otherwise actionable activities<br />
committed during industrial disputes.<br />
Labor's approach is an abdication of responsibility in a vital<br />
area of law. This cave-in to a sectional, powerful vested<br />
interest is completely contrary to the public interest.<br />
Ordinary Australians, including rank and file unionists, reject<br />
this sell-out to a powerful pressure group. They will continue<br />
to support our fair and firm approach in Industrial Relations<br />
which has proven to be successful.<br />
Finally, let me mention one further area where the campaign has<br />
underscored the difference between Mr. Whitlam's Labor Party and<br />
the approach of the Government Social Welfare reform.<br />
Since we were elected, the. Liberal Government has undertaken<br />
some fundamental social reforms, and commentators have found<br />
it difficult to fit these reforms into their conventional<br />
stereotypes of what Governments from our side of politics are<br />
meant to be like.<br />
Our Social Welfare-policies have had as their major priority,<br />
directing assistance to those people most in need. They have<br />
emphasised concern for the individual, careful testing and<br />
evaluation of imaginative schemes and experimentation. Our<br />
Family Allowances have redistributed. Our children's<br />
service progranmes have been reoriented towards day-care for<br />
the children of working mothers. Our experiements in social<br />
welfare such as the housing voucher experiment, and our initiatives<br />
in-the ethnic area reflect our:. concern for minorities, and the<br />
least privileged in our society.<br />
All these initiatives and our explicit recognition of the fact that<br />
without a sound strategy to secure non-inflationary growth'and<br />
development, all the welfare promises in the world are meaningless,<br />
I believe, are building a solid basis of support amongst those<br />
groups that are conventionally regarded as being Labor supporters.<br />
We'have been the Government that<br />
has indexed pensions so that they"-increase automatically in<br />
line with the Consumer Price Index. We have been the Government<br />
that has provided a completely new deal for the handicapped and<br />
those who financially support them.<br />
We have been the Government that redistributed wealth by ending<br />
the concessioaal rebate for children which only benefitted families<br />
of significant incomes and replaced them with family, allowances. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
The Labor Party's reputation as the Party of social concern, is<br />
a vestigial one. A political party can live off one's past<br />
reputation-only for so long. Labor's tax proposals underscored<br />
this in the.. most pointed way. They forgot the impact of their<br />
abandonment of our tax reforms on 225,000 lower income earners.<br />
It was only an after-thought that Mr. Hurford came forward with<br />
his amendments to Mr. Whitlam's proposal'anc I do not believe that<br />
people will forget this.<br />
As I said in my policy speech, the next few years can be exciting<br />
ones for Australians. And as the economic recovery is completed<br />
the Government will be able to focus more fully on the task of<br />
what might be called the fine tuning of ' social programmes.<br />
There are many challenges before us. Technological developments,<br />
particularly in the area of communications will transform our<br />
lives. There is a constant need to protect and enhance<br />
Australians' civil liberties. Already we have done much in this<br />
area, but more remains to be achieved.<br />
Changes in the make-up of our population will bring challenges<br />
in adjusting our social security and other social policies to<br />
the changing needs of our community. We are a multi-cultural<br />
society. There is the constant challenge of encouraging the rich<br />
di versity that is in our midst.<br />
Australia is well-equipped to play a constructive role in meeting<br />
the world energy shortage. Again unlike the. Labor Party we have<br />
a positive policy of energy development.<br />
Beyond our shores there is the challenge of playing a positive<br />
role in securing a safer, and a more . just world.<br />
The Government cherishes the great ideals of freedom and dignity<br />
for all Australians. That is why I believe we will be returned<br />
on Saturday with the overwhelming support of the Australian<br />
people. I7 </p>
