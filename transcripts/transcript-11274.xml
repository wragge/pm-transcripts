    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce that I have appointed Mr Robert Cornall to be Secretary<br />
   of the Attorney-General's Department following the retirement of Mr Tony<br />
   Blunn.</p>
<p>  Mr Cornall is currently the Managing Director of Victoria Legal Aid, a position<br />
   he has held since December 1995. He has extensive experience in the law<br />
   and in administration having in the past been Executive Director and Secretary<br />
   of the Law Institute of Victoria and a partner and managing partner in a<br />
   private legal firm. His work with Victoria Legal Aid involved establishing<br />
   a new organisation and required strong and innovative financial and staff<br />
   management skills.</p>
<p>  Mr Cornall will take up his five year appointment on 24 January 2000.</p>
<p>  In announcing Mr Cornall's appointment, I wish also to pay tribute to Mr<br />
   Blunn who has served the Commonwealth with great distinction in many capacities<br />
   during a career spanning over 40 years. Mr Blunn has chosen to retire with<br />
   effect from 17 December 1999. His advice and dedicated public service have<br />
   been greatly appreciated by the present Government and its predecessors.</p>
