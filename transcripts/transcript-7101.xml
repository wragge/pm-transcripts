JAUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 February 1987<br />
JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, MR BOWEN<br />
AND THE CHIW MINISTER OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY, MR HATTON<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr Bowen and the Chief Minister<br />
of the Northern Territory, Mr Hatton today announced joint<br />
Commonwealth/ State Bicentennial funding for three projects<br />
in Central Australia.<br />
The three prujects are the restoration of the Hermannsburg<br />
mission settlement, the Ghan Railway preservation project<br />
and the Alice Springs Telegraph Station.<br />
The Hermannsburg mission settlement represents a unique and<br />
fairly well preserved example of missionary contact and<br />
influence on Aboriginal life in Australia from 1877.<br />
The Ntaria L. and Trust and Council, who are the owners and<br />
managers of the site, have undertaken to restore the<br />
historic structures in recognition of their significance as<br />
part of the cultural heritage of all Australians.<br />
Australian Bicentennial commemorative funding will allow the<br />
restoration and interpretation of the major historic<br />
structures at the Hermannsburg mission settlement.<br />
The old Ghan played an important role in the development of<br />
Central Australia and is of ma3or historical significance to<br />
the Northern Territory and South Australia. On 6 August,<br />
1929 the first old Ghan train service arrived in the then<br />
town of Stuart. The narrow gauge service was replaced in<br />
1980 by the standard gauge line which connects Alice Springs<br />
to Adelaide.<br />
Some 30 kilometres of the old Ghan railway between<br />
macdonnell Siding and Ewaninga Siding is being restored with<br />
the support of Australian Bicentennial funding. Its<br />
operation as a tourist attraction will commence in 1988 on<br />
the 59th anniversary of the inaugural old Ghan service.<br />
The Alice Springs Telegraph Station project will provide the<br />
opportunity for a 24 hour live-in experience for school<br />
classes at the old telegraph station, five kilometres from<br />
the centre of Alice Springs. </p>
<p>2<br />
Activities for school children will provide an authentic<br />
historic experience in demonstrating an important facet of<br />
early development in the Alice Springs area. The facilities<br />
will also continue to be available to all sections of the<br />
community and visitors to the Northern Territory.<br />
Mr Boweli said that the Commonwealth was pleased to support<br />
three such diverse and distinctive projects in the Alice<br />
Springs region which will preserve important facets of the<br />
region's development.<br />
Mr Hatton said that the projects represent significant<br />
aspects of the region's history. It is also pleasing to<br />
note that the restoration of the Hermannsburg mission<br />
settlement will be undertaken by the Ntaria Council. i LI </p>
