PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PM INTERVIEWED BY GREG CARY ON BRISBANE RADIO 4BC<br />
9/ 03/ 90.<br />
E 0 E Proof only.<br />
GC-$ Welcome Mr Hawke, it's good to see you you're enjoying<br />
the campaign?<br />
PM: As a matter of fact I am, yes.<br />
GC: You talked yesterday in your policy launch of dreams, you<br />
talked of visions. I remember we talked not a long time after<br />
you attained the highest office in our land, you talked of a<br />
dream for our country a vision for our country, if you were to be<br />
beaten March 24 how much of that remains undone?<br />
PM: Well, vision is something which is never accomplished. I<br />
mean because if you think a vision is ever accomplished that<br />
means there is never room for improvement. What I feel about the<br />
seven years is that we've got so much of the building blocks put<br />
in place but the structure's not finished and it will always be a<br />
building that can be extended. But, by building blocks I mean<br />
these things very simply, Greg, the most important building block<br />
is the education of our kids.-There's no more important<br />
building block than that, and when I came to office only one in<br />
three of our kids stayed on in school; in the seven years that<br />
they'd been in office they'd only increased that retention rate<br />
went fromn 34% to 36%, and that was criminal. We've massively<br />
increased that, it's getting up towards two in three of our kids<br />
staying on in school. That means there's another 67,000 kids<br />
each year additional going on and having their education, that<br />
important part of their education so that building block's<br />
in place and the country and the kids themselves are going to<br />
benefit from that. But I want to go on building on that and it<br />
was part of the promises of yesterday to make it easier for<br />
parents to meet the costs of keeping their kids on in school.<br />
One of the very important building blocks that we're getting in<br />
place is the restructuring of our industry. We've got the most<br />
massive investment in industry in our history. That's going to<br />
start to pay off by making us even more competitive by enabling<br />
us to add to our exports of manufactured goods. We want to keep<br />
on doing that. We're reforming our awards so that the awards<br />
under which people work reflect more accurately the sort of<br />
technology with which they are working and that is a massive<br />
reform process. The reform of superannuation. That's a<br />
fundamental building block but now with $ 15 a week going into<br />
each person's pay packet from the employer to give them a </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM ( cont) t superannuation basis in the future and it's adding to<br />
the country's savings. But we want see that go on so the answer<br />
to your question Greg is that a lot of the basis of the vision<br />
f or this changed country is there, it's in place, but we must see<br />
that those building blocks are not smashed and scattered.<br />
GC: To do that, as you said yesterday, we need to be clever, we<br />
need to get away from this concept and I think Donald H~ orne<br />
f irst coined the phrase didn't he some 20 years ago the lucky<br />
country. He was being a little sarcastic he said we'd really<br />
not done the right thing by our natural resources. You said<br />
we'd have to be more clever, in what ways have we been less<br />
clever than we should have been?<br />
PM: Well, I think it's a function of the lucky country syndrome<br />
that there is a paradox about Australia if you look at this<br />
postwar period Greg, we of course suffered in the war and so many<br />
of families lost loved ones and so on, but for Australia the war<br />
paradoxically was a plus. It meant that our, in the post war<br />
period when the rest of the world was devastated, the world paid<br />
us enormous prices for our agricultural products and we had<br />
mineral booms and they paid us enormous amounts for what we dug<br />
up out of the ground as well an what we grew. Life camne pretty<br />
easy relatively for us. And, I guess we weren't clever enough in<br />
a sense to understand that those days couldn't go on for ever.<br />
What I've tried to be about in talking with not at my fellow<br />
Australians is to say, well look it's a very very competitive, a<br />
tough competitive world which doesn't owe us a living. So we've<br />
got to be clever enough to work out what are the things that we<br />
can do in addition to being the best agricultural producer in the<br />
world, to being the best miners in the world. The world can<br />
suddenly pay you much less f or your wheat and your wool and your<br />
meat and your iron ore, your coal and your bauxite, and if they<br />
do you're in the proverbial ditch if they halve your income. So<br />
you've got to be careful enough to work out the sorts of niches<br />
in manufactured goods and exports of services that we can<br />
develop. So, for example, I've put in place taxation incentives<br />
for research and development which are paying off now. We're<br />
finding that we can develop technologies, in particular markets.<br />
One of the most remarkable things is, as I said in my speech<br />
yesterday, we are in fact exporting cars and automobile parts to<br />
Japan and the United States. And we can do those sorts of<br />
things. One of the most exciting experiences I had in the last<br />
year or so I went to this great enterprise in a suburb of<br />
Adelaide, and this is in the area of plastic lenses, glasses.<br />
One of the most competitive, tough markets is the United States<br />
and this f irm in Adelaide has got more than 50% of the United<br />
States market and it's exporting all round the world. So these<br />
are the sorts of things we've got to be clever enough to do and<br />
that's why a central part of my speech yesterday and my proposal </p>
<p>-3<br />
PM ( cont) I was the establishment of these 50 co-operative<br />
research centres. The scientific community is absolutely excited<br />
about it and I owe them a debt of gratitude because Professor<br />
Slatyer, who I've appointed in the last 12 months as my personal<br />
science adviser, and I've established a Science Council, between<br />
them they've come up with this idea and that means with a<br />
spending of quite a lot of money that we will put into it, we<br />
will now have 50 centres of excellence around the country which<br />
are going to develop new ideas in medicine and technology . and<br />
environment control and these sorts of things so that we can<br />
become a leader. Those are the sorts of things I mean by being<br />
clever. GCs Okay, a lot of people would like to talk with you. Just<br />
before they do though, one final question on interest rates.<br />
Liberal Party says they are going down significantly,<br />
substantially, whatever they're going down. You've suggested<br />
they're going down as well. What happens if they hit 19%? What<br />
happens if they hit 20% as some bankers are prepared to say they<br />
might. I know there are plenty saying that they might go down<br />
but can you tell me, can you tell the young home owners<br />
struggling today that they won't hit 19%?<br />
PM: Yes I can on the basis not just because T want to win their<br />
vote by saying it, I don't operate like that, but I do believe<br />
that we have put in place the policies which will mean they'll<br />
come down and the evidence is there. The reason, put simply<br />
Greg, as to why we had to have interest rates high was a very<br />
simple statistic in the last year we had an 8% growth in<br />
consumption and a 4% growth in production. Now that 4% gap was<br />
just filled by bringing in imports and we couldn't go on doing<br />
that so I had a tight fiscal policy, I had a tight wages policy<br />
and I had to tighten monetary policy. That was to slow down<br />
Sdemand. And all the evidence is there, it's acknowledged that<br />
Wthat demand is slowing down and it's on the basis of that slowing<br />
of demand that the banks last month started to lower rates in the<br />
non-mortgage area and it's on that basis that they are saying<br />
that mortgage rates will come down. The important thing for<br />
your listeners is, are those policies which have enabled us to<br />
have the environment for lowering interest rates, are they going<br />
to be kept? They will be under us because we've got a wages<br />
policy which will prevent a wages explosion. Mr Peacock has the<br />
opposite, he's going to allow free~ vorcfl in wages bargaining. He<br />
would have let the pilots have their 30% and it just would have<br />
been mayhem and under his policies that's what would happen as it<br />
did at the beginning of the 800. This wages explosion, that's<br />
one thing that would mean interest rates going up. The other<br />
thing, of course, in that he's got now $ 6 Billion of promises<br />
that he's made and he hasn't funded, so that means the surplus<br />
that we've built up is exploded and take those two things<br />
I </p>
<p>-4<br />
PM ( cont) together you must get a boost in interest rates<br />
under the conservatives.<br />
GC1 Let's talk a little with the people, Natalie good morning<br />
you are talking with the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke.<br />
NATALIE: Hi Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Yes Natalie, how are you?<br />
NATALIE%, I'm fine thank you. I'm 19 and a lot of my friends<br />
and a lot of people in my age group talk about politics and there<br />
seems to be quite a lot of confusion. I think we hear more mudslinging<br />
and denials thani reasons why we should vote for any<br />
party and it seems whoever we vote for it's going to be a donkey<br />
S vote anyway. So my question is how do I make up my mind between<br />
a group of men who are always fighting and bad-mouthing each<br />
other? PM: Well Natalie, that's not what's always happening. I<br />
suggest Natalie, if you really want to have a look at this got<br />
the transcript if you would, get the full speech of Mr Peacock<br />
when he launched his policy at the beginning of this week, and<br />
get mine.<br />
NATALIE: But you are always both saying things about each other<br />
like what you just said then.<br />
PM: I Well, let me say, get his policy speech and get mine and<br />
see who's talking about the real issues of the future. But let<br />
me make this point, Natalie, politics is not simply a business of<br />
Mr Nice Guy. I mean a politician, in my judgment Natalie, has<br />
two responsibilities in a democracy, because in a democracy it's<br />
either you or the other fellow are going to form a government and<br />
0 your responsibilities are twofold. Your first responsibility, of<br />
course, is positively to talk about your own policies which is<br />
precisely what I did yesterday, talked about the building blocks<br />
we've already created and the new proposals for a better future<br />
for Australia. If you don't discharge that positive obligation,<br />
Natalie, you shouldn't be in the business. But you've also got<br />
an obligation to tell. the Natalies of the world, everyone all the<br />
voters out there, what does the alternative mean, and if I<br />
believe as I deeply do Natalie.. that the proposals of the<br />
conservatives are a recipe for disaster for this country, then<br />
it's my obligation to expose that. I mean, for instance Natalie,<br />
you're 19 and that means when I came to office in 1983 you were<br />
only 12. Now you wouldn't know, with respect, the disaster that<br />
had been brought to this country just in that period before I<br />
came to office because the conservatives then were in Government<br />
and they were pursuing the same policies then that they are </p>
<p>PM ( cont) i promising to impose again-Now I've got an<br />
obligation I wouldn't be doing my job if as well as telling you<br />
about my policies I didn't warn you of what the alternative would<br />
mean. G: Prime Minister, Natalie touches on disillusionment that is<br />
widespread in our community just now with both major parties. Do<br />
you want to acknowledge that and two, take any responsibility for<br />
that, or understand why it is the case?<br />
pMs Yes, I've had this question put quite a bit. There's one<br />
feature of it Greg which I think is not just unique to this<br />
country but if we look all round the world we can Bee it. one of<br />
the indisputable facts of life is that in the last few years<br />
O there's been an acceleration of interest in matters<br />
environmental, in every country and I'm glad that that's<br />
happened. Now that's reflected in this country and I think it's<br />
one of the reasons why you see the non-major party vote being up,<br />
some of it in the Democrats and some of it in the Green<br />
candidates. Now that doesn't upset me, I think it's very<br />
important that people should be concerned about the environment.<br />
I've simply made the point, and I make it again to your<br />
listeners, if a person out there listening on your program<br />
regards the environment as the overwhelmingly important issue to<br />
the point where they want to cast their vote for an environmental<br />
candidate, okay okay. But, they've then got to ask themselves<br />
the question if the environment is so important to them, how do<br />
they then cast their preference to ensure that environmental<br />
issues are going to be best looked after? There's only one<br />
answer then and that is they must vote for Labor because we have<br />
the record against the conservatives. You know it all, we saved<br />
the Franklin, we stopped Daintree being logged, we ' ye stopped<br />
Kakadu being mined and on each one of those decisions, on each<br />
Sone of those, the conservatives opposed us. So that's one of the<br />
Wmajor reasons for this increase in the vote of the non-major<br />
parties. GC,. Wendy$ you're talking to the Prime Minister.<br />
WENDYs Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning Wendy.<br />
WENDY: Look, in your policy speech I've not heard any mention<br />
for small businesses that's where there's a husband and wife<br />
and 15 people and less. What relief can we expect considering in<br />
the first seven months of this financial year my interest rates<br />
have doubled that of the last 12 months? Also, superannuation<br />
for everyone is very important, I agree with that but in a<br />
business where our prices are controlled, where are we going to </p>
<p>-6<br />
WEN * DY ( cont) find the money to pay for our employees'<br />
superannuation? PM:. Well, Wendy, let me take the interest rates question first.<br />
I said yesterday that it had given me no pleasure to have to have<br />
a tight monetary policy and it wasn't done for fun. The simply<br />
fact is Wendy that you and other small businesses in Australia<br />
would have been absolutely ruined if in fact we hadn't had those<br />
Policies because if I'd just allowed the explosion of demand to<br />
go on then the economy would have collapsed. We had to soften<br />
the level of demand in this country, we had tight fiscal policy,<br />
tight wages policy, so we had to tighten monetary policy. There<br />
was no alternative other than if we wanted the economy to<br />
collapse. Now, the question Wendy is simply, you've got to ask<br />
yourself# what's more likely to happen to interest rates if Labor<br />
comes in or the conservatives get in? I don't want to go over<br />
all the stuff I've gone over with Greg, but the indisputable fact<br />
is that the banking sector is saying that the policies that we've<br />
brought in has now created a situation in which interest rates<br />
can come down. Prime rates have already started to come down and<br />
under that situation there will be continuation downwards of<br />
interest rates and it will go into mortgage rates. The banking<br />
Industry is saying that but it's equally inevitable<br />
that if the conservatives came in with their wages explosion, boy<br />
would you have to worry then because wages would go through the<br />
roof WENDY: Yes, but we've got to worry now because in this<br />
morning's news it said 10,000 small businesses have gone<br />
bankrupt, and I just don't think anymore can go bankrupt because<br />
you know, you go home at night you don't have to face your bank<br />
manager and there's thousands, hundreds of thousands of us out<br />
there employing people, young people, I've got two apprentices,<br />
Sand you know we are wi lling to give them a chance but how can we<br />
Wgive them a chance when we have continuing high interest rates?<br />
PM: Wendy, let me tell you that you talk about apprentices, the<br />
fact that you've got apprentices reflects into the fact that in<br />
the seven years of my Government there has been a doubling of the<br />
number of apprentices. There's been, if you want to talk about<br />
employment Wendy the fact is that under my Government there's<br />
been five times, five, not one, two, three, but five times the<br />
rate of employment growth as there was under the Liberals and 93%<br />
Wendy, 93% of that employment growth has been in the private<br />
sector and the overwhelming proportion of the private sector is<br />
small business. In other words you've been able to grow. Look<br />
at the other things that we have done<br />
GC: Prime Minister, with respect, for one second, Wendy's doing<br />
it tough and yet you are coming back to her telling her that </p>
<p>-7<br />
GC ( cant): she shouldn't be doing it tough.<br />
PM: No, I'm not saying anything of the sort. As I said<br />
yesterday, I know that Wendy and others have been doing it tough.<br />
I'm saying two things I'm saying that and this is not a<br />
statistic that Wendy, you and Bob Hawke or anyone can avoid in<br />
that last year because of this enormous growth that was taking<br />
place the economy was growing that fast that we had an increase<br />
in consumption of St. We only produced another 4% more and as a<br />
country we made up that gap by sucking in more imports and we<br />
couldn't afford to keep on doing that. The world wasn't going to<br />
keep paying f or Australia's standard of living and so we had to<br />
lower that demand and the only way of doing that was by<br />
tightening interest rates. But, the important point is, now<br />
they are coming down. The banking industry which sets the rates<br />
0 says that, but it's also clear that we won't get the benefit of<br />
those reduced rates if there were a change of Government because,<br />
Wendy, and all the business community out there would be faced<br />
with a wages explosion because Mr Peacock and the others say let<br />
her rip, let the strong use their muscle which they would<br />
C But if you had enterprise bargaining couldn't Wendy say to<br />
her employees now listen I'm doing it A little bit tough I'd<br />
prefer you to take a pay decrease for the next 12 months?<br />
PM1 Well what I can say about that is you look at our history,<br />
if you look at our history what's happened, and this is important<br />
I mean you and I Greg don't have to sit here with Wendy and have<br />
a hypothetical about this<br />
WENDY: Excuse me, let me get in, my interest rates when you<br />
came in, because I've been in business f or 11 years, was probably<br />
only what 12-13%? It's 24% now and what do you say to the<br />
employees who come to me and say look please, please, can I<br />
borrow a hundred dollars f rom you if not I can't make my house<br />
payment? What do you tell these poor people?<br />
PM: I Wendy I say what I said yesterday that I know it's been<br />
hard. I'm simply saying that the alternative was disastrous and<br />
the alternative under the conservatives would even be more<br />
disastrous. They had a situation where they controlled this<br />
country. Under them the 90 day bill rate reached in April of<br />
1982 22%, it's never reached that under us the 90 day bill rate,<br />
they reached the higher rate and they brought about the worst<br />
recession in this country's history because, Wendy, they didn't<br />
have a wages policy. In the last 12 months before I became Prime<br />
Minister you talk about small business collapsing, in the last 12<br />
months before I became Prime Minister, a quarter of a million of<br />
your fellow Australians were thrown onto the unemployment scrap </p>
<p>8-<br />
PM ( cont) I heap, a quarter of a million, not under this<br />
Government. Employment is growing and growing and growing but<br />
the unemployment scrap heap grew under then because they didn't<br />
have a wages policy and Wendy, that's what they'd inflict upon<br />
you again.<br />
CS Wendy, I know you want to say some more but in respect to<br />
the other people who have been lining up and waiting for<br />
sometime, we need to move on, Patty, good morning and welcome.<br />
PATTY: Good morning, good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM1 Good morning Patty.<br />
PATTY: It's indeed heartening to see the family being<br />
recognised in this election. However* it seems ironic to<br />
me anyway, that the policies of both your party and the Coalition<br />
have ignored the plight of the single income family and in fact<br />
discriminate in favour of users of external child care. Now I<br />
say ironic because it seems that family policies now have to be<br />
framed to help solve the very problem created because women have<br />
been forced into the workplace. Now my question therefore is, Mr<br />
Prime Minister, why have you not increased family allowances as<br />
even after the increases and indexation last year, for which we<br />
thank you, their real value in dollar terms has fallen by 100%<br />
since 1982. Now you did give two bucks a week to keep kids at<br />
school in years 11 and 12, that wouldn't even pay transport costs<br />
for one day. Now by chosing rather to increase funding for<br />
external childcare you are abandoning those families which forego<br />
a second income to care for their kids at home which families,<br />
incidentally, are already paying up to 50% more tax than dual<br />
income families.<br />
PM*. Well Patty, let me say that in that exposition, you have<br />
Woverlooked the facts of what we have been doing to assist the<br />
families, including single income families and including the most<br />
needy. Lot me give you the facts, these are not opinions. In<br />
this current year, Patty, we are paying to the lower income<br />
families in this country over $ 2 Billion so that those families<br />
with kids are going to get the assistance they need to meet their<br />
responsibilities, and that's in addition, that over $ 2 Billion<br />
which is paid by way of family allowance supplement to the low<br />
income is in addition to the $ 1.2 Billion that Is being paid in<br />
family allowance. Now just so that we can get those figures Greg<br />
down to our families, so you can get some idea of a single income<br />
family, what that means let's take a single income and this is<br />
a family that this lady Patty is talking about-a single Income<br />
family Greg with an income of $ 320 a week. Now under the family<br />
allowance supplement that I am~ paying there, that family that's<br />
got three kids is getting $ i1o a week tax free, $ 110 a week tax </p>
<p>9-<br />
PM ( cont); free which is equival~ ent to a wage increase of $ 170 a<br />
week. Now that's for the single income family. So, Patty, it<br />
might sound nice to say the things you do, but unfortunately you<br />
refuse to take account of those realities over $ 2 Billion being<br />
paid and being paid out to those in the greatest need and that is<br />
in the area of the single income family with $ 320 a week, an<br />
additional $ 110 tax free.<br />
GCs Patty, I need to let the question and the answer stand<br />
because David is also hanging in there, David welcome.<br />
DAVID: Yes, good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning David.<br />
0 DAVIDz I've been following the campaign, probably not as closely<br />
as what I should, but right throughout this campaign you've given<br />
me the distinct impression that you're frightened of the minority<br />
parties. Why?<br />
PM4: Well, David, you're wrong I'm not frightened of the<br />
minority parties, not frightened at all. What I have said is<br />
tried to, as Greg I think would acknowledge in discussion, I've<br />
acknowledged that I think the votes in minority parties will be<br />
up and the major reason why the votes in minority parties will be<br />
up is that now, as compared with-three years ago, there's a<br />
greater interest in the environment and some people are going to<br />
cast their vote, their primary vote, on the basis of their<br />
concern with the environment. That doesn't worry me, it doesn't<br />
worry me at all. in fact basically I welcome the increase in<br />
interest in the community on the environment. I'm simply saying,<br />
particularly to those people David, that if they have a real<br />
concern about the environment they've got to make their decision<br />
about their second preference because their first preference<br />
W won't decide who governs the country, the second will and they<br />
can decide for Hawke who's made all the major environmental<br />
decisions, or for the conservatives who've opposed them.<br />
GC: Kate, we only have one minute, can you make it kind of<br />
brief. KATE% Yes, good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: 6 Good morning Kate.<br />
KATE: I'm not aware of any attention either parties have given<br />
to people with a disability in your talks and that leading up to<br />
your elections; p and also the specialised equipment which disabled<br />
people need. They should be really tax exempted because there's<br />
on these things, a lot of them are really essential to us. </p>
<p>10<br />
GC: Okay, to be fair to the Prime Minister, and we have to break<br />
for the news, what I will do is if it's okay with the Prime<br />
Minister is take two minutes of your time and record your answer<br />
to that question, we will play that after the ten o'clock news<br />
and hopefully that will keep everybody happy.<br />
PM: Sure, sure.<br />
BREAK FOR NEWS<br />
GC: While the news was on the Prime Minister stayed with us for<br />
a few extra minutes to answer the question just posed by Kate.<br />
XATE: I'm just wondering why there is no attention is given to<br />
people with a disability; and also the equipment that is<br />
S necessary to disabled people, you know the tax exemption on that.<br />
Surely to goodness that could be waylaid and, sheltered<br />
workshops, your Government has phased out all of these sheltered<br />
workshops and it was throwing a lot of people out of employment<br />
you know. If they are to go out and mix with the world, surely<br />
the world can come in and mix with them.<br />
P? 4* rirstly, in regard to the history and then in regard to<br />
the present. What you are saying, of course, in regard to what<br />
we've done in the area of sheltered workshops and so on is just<br />
not accurate. We have in consultation with the States and the<br />
various organisations concerned with the disabled changed our<br />
approach in a way which has been welcomed by the organisations<br />
themselves because our view is that we ought to together do<br />
everything we possibly can to see that every opportunity is given<br />
to disabled people to become integrated into the mainstream of<br />
employment. This is a development which has been welcomed by<br />
everyone concerned in this area. But now to the presents I<br />
Sdidn't ignore the disabled yesterday in my policy speech. Let me<br />
Wjust point out that to help overcome the problems involved in the<br />
education of the disabled children I announced that the Federal<br />
Government will increase from the beginning of next year its per<br />
capita grant for students with disabilities in Government schools<br />
by 20% and it will fund students with disabilities in non-<br />
Government schools at the highest rate for non-Government<br />
schools. And, these changes as I have said, recognise the<br />
benefits of increased integration, something that I just referred<br />
to, and accordingly the new per capita grant level will be<br />
portable so that all children with disabilities can take their<br />
grant with them upon integration into regular schools. This will<br />
cost us $ 4.2 million in a full year. So, we've neither forgotten<br />
them In the past nor in my immediate policies.<br />
GCt Kate, we thank you for your call, we thank everybody else.<br />
we apologise to the many others who wanted to get on, election </p>
<p>CC ( Cont) I campaigns of course, can be a bit of a bother not<br />
only to the electorate but also to politicians who fancy a punt.<br />
Tomorrow we've got the Newmaarket have you had a look at the form?<br />
PM2 No no I haven ' t had a look at the form. I don't know<br />
whether I might be able to have a look at it sometime tonight in<br />
Mount Isa and I hate giving tips without having studied the form,<br />
but having a quick look at it what I'm just saying in Melbourne<br />
these days what you ought to do in go for Colin Hayes outsider,<br />
he got up with Scarlet Bisque the other day at 33-1 and then<br />
Masahan in the Blue Slipper at, what was it about Well,<br />
what's his outsider, his outsider is Franklin Drive at 20-1.<br />
Apart from that he's got Michael Clarke on Leica Western. So if<br />
you really were going for a roughie I suppose you'd go for<br />
Franklin Drive at 20-1. if I wasn't doing that I guess, probably<br />
I might be looking at Strawberry Ranch perhaps..., . what about the<br />
Queensland horse Planet Ruler, what do you think of it<br />
GCs It's a good horse.<br />
PM: Hasn't really struck it down there this time.<br />
GC1 It will run well though, stick with your outsider.<br />
PM; Okay.<br />
C: What price a Hlawke win on March 242<br />
PM: I think the odds are much shorter on that, but we're not<br />
being cocky about it, we're working hard right up to the day.<br />
GC: Thanks for coming by.<br />
qPM: It's been my pleasure. Thank you very much to you Greg and<br />
Iq to your listeners.<br />
Ends </p>
