    <content><![CDATA[<p>Work on the $110 million Tiger Brennan Drive Extension entered a new phase today with about 120,000 cubic metres of land “blasted” at Berrimah Farm in Darwin to make way for the new 7.5km four-lane dual highway extension.</p>
<p>This is one of the single largest projects in Darwin, supporting up to 200 jobs and building the vital road infrastructure for the future.</p>
<p>The project will reduce travel delays and improve safety for about 34,000 vehicles per day and transform the corridor between the rural area, Palmerston and Darwin.</p>
<p>The project is progressing well with much of the land corridor having already been cleared and the culvert construction underway as part of the early works.</p>
<p>Today's blasting symbolises the start of a critical new stage.</p>
<p>Road sealing as part of Stage Two is set to begin towards the end of this year with work on the much anticipated overpasses set to begin in next month.</p>
<p>The project is scheduled for completion in 2010.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has committed $74 million to this vital project with the Northern Territory Government contributing $36 million.</p>
