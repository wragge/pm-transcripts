MEDIA RELEASE(
JAPANESE IRON ORE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
Statement by -the Acting Prime Minister and Minister fo-T-tde<br />
and Resources, Mr Anthony<br />
I am very pleased that the price for iron ore for<br />
delivery to Japan by the Mt Newman partners in the year<br />
commuencing 1 April 1980 will rise by about<br />
This increase, together with last year' s increase,<br />
will go some way towards the achievement of a more realistic<br />
price level for iron ore.<br />
The settlement is consistent with increases achieved<br />
by the major suppliers to the European market. I<br />
I am extremely pleased that, as in 1979, the negotiations<br />
have been completed well before the commencement of the new ore<br />
year in April unlike earlier years when they dragged on for many<br />
months. Canberra 6th February, 1980 </p>
