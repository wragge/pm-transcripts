SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ON<br />
WEDNESDAY, 25TH OCTOBER. 1961<br />
I do not propose to devote any time to what has fallen from the<br />
honourable member for ivacquarie ( Mr. Luchetti). suite frankly, I have never<br />
heard him to worse advantage. He went through a process like the legendary<br />
tiger of lashing himself into a fury with his f ill. In the course of doing so,<br />
he came out strong I think that is the phrase as the champion of privat.<br />
enterprise. This was a magnifirant effort on his part, because when his<br />
party establiblhtd Trans.-lnstralia Airlines, and I hope that is not forgotten,<br />
it sought to establish it legislatively as the one single airline in Australia.<br />
To hear people who sought to do that and were frustrated only by the processes<br />
of the law come out now as dhampions of free enterprise is really more amusing<br />
than unpleasant. The reason why 1 am taking part in this debate is that there has<br />
been an attempt in the last few days to create an air of scandal about sometlin.<br />
to do with my distinguished colleague, the Minister for Civi. L Aviation<br />
( Senator Paltridge), a man i, I might adept thefrase of the honourable<br />
member for Macquarie ( Mr. Luchetti) of undoubted integrity, a man whose word<br />
cannot be doubted, a public-spirited man. 1 refrain from running through the'<br />
whole calendar that he put to Us.<br />
Today I notice that what I might call the juvenile, irresponsible<br />
evening newspapers of Sydney have really gone to town about this. There is a<br />
crisis! Somebody is going to resign! I do not know whethcr it is myself<br />
Mr. Ward I hope so.<br />
MR. ' ENZIES I know you hope it will be me. The honourable member for tast<br />
Sydney ( Mr. 1Ward) hopes that I will resign. That is his one chance of getting<br />
rid of me. I just want to say this about this matter: What is the allegation?<br />
I think it is , ery important that the people of Australia who happen to be<br />
interested in this matter should understand what is the allegation. It<br />
appears to me that the Minister for Civil Aviation tried to persuade, or,<br />
rather, to order East-West Airlines Limited to accept a take-over offer made by<br />
Mr. Ansett, or by his company when? In May 1960: It was an offer which was<br />
rejected by the company and which the company protected itself against very<br />
shortly thereafter by altering its articles of association to provide that<br />
shares could not be transferred except with the approval of the directors<br />
themselves. In other words, they had an offer, they rejected it, they took<br />
steps under their articles of association to make it quite certain that no offer<br />
thereafter could be accepted except with the approval of the directors<br />
themselves, meaning by that, Mr. Shand, ? Mr. Pringle and these other gentlemen we<br />
have been hearing about. All that took place in the middle of 1960. That is<br />
the allegation. Unless it is alleged and I should like to hear it if it is<br />
that tb,, reafter the linister has been putting pressure on them, delivering<br />
ultimatums to them to accept offers which have not been made, because, if there<br />
is one thing that is clear about this it is that the only offer to take them<br />
over that was ever made was made in May 1960. That was rejected, steps were<br />
taken to see that it could not successfully be renewe4 and not since then his<br />
any offer of a take-over been made to them. I have a very considerable respect<br />
for the intelligence of the MinisLer for Civil Aviation. He is a man with a<br />
great record in the administration of this department. He is a man who has<br />
done a great deal for civil aviation in Australia, and if I thought that he<br />
could be ordering people to accept a non-existent offer made by non-existent<br />
people, I would seriously worry about his state of mind. Yet that is the<br />
allegation. If the honourable member for Lalor ( Mr. Pollard), who is<br />
interjecting, does not mind, that is a very important matter. These charges<br />
have been made, I propose to deal with them, and I have made my first point on<br />
that matter. The man against whom this charge which, on the face of it, is<br />
fantastic, as I have just indicated, is made is now represented as somebody who<br />
wants to crush out of existence, this airline. I just want to remind this<br />
House that this is the man who brought into existence for the first time a<br />
system of subsidizing these feeder airlines. But-for what Senator Paltridge </p>
<p>did in his administration, backed by the Government, East-West Airlines Limited<br />
would probably never have made a profit at any time because their profit, even<br />
in the years when they have had a profit has depended on the subsidy paid by<br />
the Commorwealth. I am not quarrelling with that. I thought it was a very<br />
wise d3cision, but it really ought to give people son room for thought to<br />
consider that the man who goes to the trouble of devising a system of subsidies<br />
to maintain East-West Airlines Limited can all of a sudden want to destroythem.<br />
Mr. Ward Ansett gets the bulk of the subsidies.<br />
MR. 1 7NZIES There are all sorts of people who get the subsidies who run<br />
feeder airlines. I am talking about this. I kncw you don't want me to talk<br />
about this matter but I am talking about East-West Airlines; and East-West<br />
Airlines Limited, under his policy not only has received a growing subsidy<br />
through the years since 1957 but have also received, on his recomnendation,<br />
through his instrumentality, more than half of the fleet they possess because,<br />
in point of fact, of the total flect of four D. C. 3s and erie Fokker Friend: hip<br />
used by East-West Airlines Limited that company is indebted to the Commonwealth<br />
for two D. C. 3s and one Fokker Friendship. I am not auarrelling with the<br />
efficiency of this Company. I think they are a very much needed enterprise.<br />
I do not argue about these things. I acknowledge them with pleasure.. But, of<br />
the four D. C. 3s and one Fokker Friendship used by them, East-West Airlines<br />
Limited happen to be indebted to the Commonwealth, through the instrumentality<br />
of Senator Paltridge, the Minister for Civil Aviation, for two D. C. 3s and the<br />
one Fokker Friendship more than half of their operating fleet. So that, in<br />
terms of capital equipment, the bulk of what they have has been found through<br />
him. As for the subsidy they enjoy, they had none until he came along and<br />
produced one. That is the short position about the relationship between the<br />
Minister and this airline, and it is quite clear that, but for this subsidy<br />
payment, this airline would certainly have been unable to pay a dividend on<br />
capital at any time.<br />
I told the House that the Ansett offer, which was an offer of 56s. a<br />
share, was rejected by the company. The company, very naturally, I think, said<br />
" I o, we want to stand on our own feet. . e have local interests and we are<br />
going to preserve them". That, I think, was an admirable point of view. I do<br />
not ouarrel with it at all. After the offer had been rejected, as I have saic,<br />
the articles of association were amnended to make the renewal of any such offer<br />
practically impossible.<br />
The next thing that I want to say is this: Early in March this year,<br />
the Government announced that it was making a review of rural airline<br />
services. That meant, of course, that, subject to subsequent negotiation with<br />
the Commonwealth, there would be, perhaps, some alteration of routes, some<br />
reallocation of air routes, and, under those circumstances, what happened was<br />
that the Director-General of Civil Aviation, Mr. Anderson, on 23rd March, 1961,<br />
wrote again to Mr. Shand setting out the details of East-WJest Airlines<br />
Limited's subsidy for 1960-61 and informing East-Jest Airlines Limited that the<br />
subsidy contract was being terminated pending the outceme of the review being<br />
undertaken by the N. S. 4. Government. T2hat was an elementary business precaution<br />
because it would depend entirely on the re-arrangements that were ultimately<br />
made as to what the subsidy ought to be. This is said to have been a throat<br />
specially directed to East-;' est Airlines Limited. The fact is that a letter was<br />
sent to the Ansett company within two or three days of that advising that<br />
company in those precise terms of a sinilar position that the existing<br />
subsidy contract would be terminated and that it would be re-negotiated as<br />
socn as possible when the recommendtion , f the N. 3. W. Government had been<br />
received. So, Sir, that is that. lo have hoard a good deal of allegations<br />
about that matter but those are the simple facts.<br />
Now, Sir, having said that, I just want to return to this allegation,<br />
which appears to be at the heart, if there is a heart, of this strange series<br />
of charges. Following the rejection by the board of East-West Airlines of the<br />
Ansett take-over bid in June, 1960, it was quite clear that the issue was<br />
dead. But thereafter conversations occurred between the Minister and<br />
representatives of the board of East-West. The first of them indeed, it was<br />
the first personal contact that Senator Paltridge had had with the board of<br />
East-West Airlines was in Canberra in about July 1960; It is a pity to have<br />
to go into all this ancient history, because all this has been vamped up<br />
towards the end of 1961. it was in July 1960, it was on that occasion that my </p>
<p>collocsuo, HIo Minister, saw Mr. Pringle, a director I think vice chairman<br />
of the board of East-West. Mr. Pringlo spoke to him about the Ansett bid and<br />
undertook to tell him the reasons, as a matter of interest, wiy the corpany<br />
had rejected the bid.<br />
Mr. Haylen Ah'<br />
MR. MENZIES -It s figtftlUy funrny, is it not? He tol. d tho Minister why the<br />
company had rejected the bid. The Minister replied, as any Minister would,<br />
that consideration of the matter was entirely one for the board and was not<br />
one on which the Government could be expected to have a view. During the<br />
course of this meeting, Sir, Mr. Pringle indicated that the board did intend to<br />
have some further discussion with the Ansett group about a variety of matters,<br />
because people who are running airlines of this kind in the same State have a<br />
number of matters on whichthey may wish to arrive at agreemsnt, working<br />
arrangements of one kind or another. He asked Senator Paltridge whether he<br />
could arrange this meeting fur him. The Senator said that he preferred not to<br />
do that, because he did not want to have any part in any negotiations that Mr.<br />
Pringle might be contemplating with Ansett. That was his bu-'.-nss.<br />
" evertheless, Mr. Pringle wrote to him in April in these terms. I<br />
direct particular attention to this because this let me remind honourable<br />
members is a man writing as acting chairman of directors, a man who is<br />
supposed to have been threatened in July that he must get on and he must be<br />
taken over by Ansett, although the offer had long since disappeared. This is<br />
the man who is a threatened man, and this is his letter<br />
" Firstly, I would like to convey to you our appreciation for the<br />
friendly and frank talk we had in your office in Canberra on the occasion<br />
when Archie and I visited you."<br />
Archie, I think, is Mr. Smith, the manager of the airline.<br />
" The purpose of my writing you this personal letter is to inform you that<br />
I am taking my directors for a stort holiday to Bramptca Island on<br />
Sunday, 21st August, 1960, where we will be remaining for a period of<br />
seven days. It has occurred to me that this could provide the ideal<br />
opportunity for a friendly tal&amp; with Mr. Ansett along the lines mentioned<br />
in Canberra."<br />
That i s about the working arrangement. This is the threatened man'<br />
" It is felt that such a meeting would be the only way in which we could<br />
ascertain whether or not there is any chance of this company working out<br />
some mutually acceptable agreement with the Ansett group."<br />
That is to say, allthese arrangements that I was describing.<br />
" I do not know Mr. Ansett personally and I would, therefore,, be most<br />
grateful if you could pass this information on to him at an appropriate<br />
time. * ith kind personal regards. Yours sincerely<br />
1 must say, Sir, that 1 have heard that threatened men live a long time, but I<br />
have never in my long experience known a man who had been threatened in this<br />
fashion, the fashion that is now alleged, write a l tter of that kind. The<br />
Minister having said, this is not my business", Mr. Pringle himself got<br />
directly into touch with Mr. ' alker, of Ansetts, and his board in fact had some<br />
discussion with Ansett officers at this paradisical place Brampton Island<br />
wherever it is.<br />
In March of 1961, that is, about six months aft:. r he had seen Eastwest<br />
Airlines at Brampton Island, Lnsett again announced quite flatly that<br />
there was no renewal of his take-over bid for East-West Airlines and<br />
therefore, Sir, it naturally came as some surprise to my colleague, the Ministar<br />
Mr. Pollard What did Dave Drummond say? </p>
<p>Mr. Speaker Order:<br />
MR. 1ENZIES It came as a great surprise to my colleague, the Ministe:, when<br />
ir. Shand, who had seen him at Orange in July of 1961, again raised the question<br />
of an Ansett -take-over bid.<br />
Mr. Pollard But what did Dave Drummond say?<br />
Mr. Speaker Order! The honourable member for Lalor will restrain himself.<br />
MR. MENZIES Senator Paltridge told him that he was not aware of any offer.<br />
i^ r. bhand said that he was referring to th3 offer made a year before. Senator<br />
Paltridge then told him that if he wanted to try to reactivate the old offer,<br />
tat was his business and the business of his board, and not the business of<br />
the Minister. Then, Sir, after this discussion in Orange, Ar. Shand wrote a<br />
latter to the Minister which is, I think though not quite as fascinating as<br />
the first not without interest.<br />
Mr. Bryant " Dear Shane"<br />
MR. MENZIES " Dear Shane" that is how it begins. vWondrfull This is written<br />
to a man who had been threatening and bullying and trying to force them out of<br />
their property. It is the most ludicrous thing in the world. The letter<br />
starts, " Dear Shane". I pronounce it " Shawn", but that is a mere technicality.<br />
" I have given a lot of thought to the talk we had in Orange. I<br />
called at your office when in Canberra last week and found you had<br />
departed for South Lfrica. 1 hope your trip was as interesting as the one<br />
I had there recently. I have been to see Donald Anderson<br />
That is the Director-General, and in all these transactions he is " Dear Donald".<br />
It is all a very happy family business!<br />
" I have been to see Donald Anderson and had a long talk with him.<br />
I now realise some of the tremendous difficulties that you have to cope<br />
with, and hasten to assure you that small as our organization is we want<br />
to help the progressive development of this country and not hinder it.<br />
" Your Department, especially yourself and Donald have done much to<br />
help us develop. I do thank you for all your kindness in the past and<br />
hope you can spare some cf your time to see me in the near future."<br />
It is really the most fascinating story of a wicked, bullying, fraudulent,<br />
lying iinistcr-isn't it that you ever heard in your lifo<br />
Mr. Browne Did he finishwith " fours faithfully"?<br />
MR. ' ENZIES No, " fours sincerely"<br />
Mr. Freoth What was the date of that latter?<br />
MR. MNZIES 12th July of this year.<br />
I do not want to pursue this matter. I set out to deal with the<br />
substance and not with some of the frills. The substance of this matter is tht<br />
it is now said, for reasons that I could only guess at, having regard to the<br />
news of the last day or so, that from the middle of 1960 my Minister was<br />
putting the heat on and delivering ultimatums and trying to force these people,<br />
against their own judgment, to be bought out by a large air industry. Let me<br />
rehearse the facts just once. An offer was made in 1960 and was rejected<br />
out of hand by the board. The articles of association were altered so that no<br />
offer would thereafter be made to the shareholders without the approval of the<br />
directors themselves. No offer was thereafter made. There were two<br />
conferences with these people and each ended up in the writing of letters in<br />
these terms and in this atmosphere. I am asked, as the responsible head of<br />
the Government, as a man who takes groat cride in the loyal service and high<br />
integrity of his r4inistjrs, on this flimsy talk that has been going around to<br />
suspend or dismiss the Minister for Civil Aviation; to appoint a royal<br />
commission to investigate charges which can only be described in all their<br />
nudity, in the way that I have described them the naked facts about them. </p>
<p>I needed only to do that to explain to the House, and I think to the people,<br />
why I certainly will not dismiss this inistor; why I certainly will not go<br />
through Ull this hocus pocus about appointing a royal commisjon about nothing.<br />
That is my position on this matter. I hope that I have made it clear and not<br />
at undue length. 1 understand that the Minister is, in another place, tabling<br />
a mass of corresoondence on this matter. Honourable members who want to read<br />
it may do so. I have not, of course, undertaken in my limited time of half an<br />
hour to cover the whole of this correspondence that has gone on. I am entering<br />
into no charges against the honourable member for New England ( Mr. Drummond).<br />
He is entitled to his own views on this matter and I am entitled to mine. And<br />
my views on this inatter are t. r clear as crystal. If somebody wants to get rid<br />
of Senator Paltridge on these flimsy allegations, I invite him to get rid of<br />
me at the same time. </p>
