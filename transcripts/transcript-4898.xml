PRIME MINISTER 22 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER ON THE<br />
NEW AND PERMANENT PARLIAMENT<br />
HOUSE<br />
Mr Speaker, for the first 27 years of its existence, the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament operated in borrowed premises. In<br />
1913 an international competition was announced for the design<br />
of a permanent Parliament House in the new national Capital.<br />
This was first deferred and then cancelled due to the world<br />
war. Since coming to Canberra in 1927 the Parliament has operated<br />
in a house that was intended to accommodate it for a temporary<br />
period. Now that we approach the Bicentenary of Australia's<br />
settlement by Europeans, the Government has decided that funds<br />
ought to be provided for the design and construction of a<br />
permanent Parliament House.<br />
The permanent Parliament House will be the focal point of the<br />
Bicentenary celebrations in 1988 and largely complete the<br />
Capital's principal national constructions.<br />
From 1955 to the present day successive Parliaments and<br />
successive Governments have considered the question of.. a new<br />
Parliament House.<br />
In 1965, a joint select committee was appointed. Its main<br />
recommendation was to proceed with the new and permanent<br />
Parliament House.<br />
To facilitate this it recommended the establishment of a<br />
" clint" committee which in due course resulted in the setting<br />
up of a Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent<br />
Parliament House.<br />
For a considerable time a decision could not be reached on a site<br />
for that new building. This difficulty was resolved in 1974 with<br />
the passage of the Parliament Act which declared that the new<br />
and permanent Parliament House will be on Capital Hill.<br />
Since 1975, successive Parliaments have appointed the Joint<br />
Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament<br />
House, and the Committee has undertaken the detailed enquiries<br />
which have led to the decision I am now announcing.<br />
on behalf of the Government, I pay tribute to the Committee for<br />
its detailed and painstaking work over recent years. All<br />
Honourable Members are indebted to the Committee for the way </p>
<p>in which it has advanced this matter.<br />
The Government has given thought to the managerial arrangements<br />
needed to ensure that the project goes ahead efficiently,<br />
and that all parties involved are fully consulted at each<br />
relevant stage.<br />
I take this opportunity to outline to the House the proposals<br />
which will be given legislative form early next year. First,<br />
we intend that, at each major stage in the design and construction<br />
of the new building, the Parliament itself will be the authority<br />
to approve the next step to be taken.<br />
It is essential that the Parliament itself take the important<br />
threshold decisions and we shall ensure this happens.<br />
Second, we believe special and flexible administrative<br />
arrangements will be needed to facilitate the work over the<br />
next ten years. Therefore we have decided to create a statutory<br />
authority to be known as the New Parliament House Construction<br />
Authority to control the design and construction of the<br />
new Parliament House.<br />
It will do so in close association with the National Capital<br />
Development Commission and will be responsible to the Minister<br />
for the Capital Territory.<br />
It will have a chairman and four members, one of whom will be<br />
the Commissioner of the N. C. D. C.<br />
The authority will have available the services of an operations<br />
unit, of skilled professional people located within the N. C. D. C.<br />
drawn from the the Department of Construction and<br />
elsewhere and available to carry out the day-to-day directions of<br />
the Authority.<br />
Third, we propose that the Joint Standing Committee on-the new<br />
and permanent Parliament House should be seen as the advisory<br />
authority on behalf of the Parliament. It will be available<br />
to advise the Authority on any relevant matter and to report<br />
to Parliament if it wishes. In effect it will be a watchdog<br />
on behalf of the Parliament.<br />
Some consequential revision of the Joint Standing Committee's<br />
resolution of appointment may be appropriate, and proposals<br />
will be submitted to the Parliament early next year. The<br />
Committee will continue in operation because an immediate problem<br />
will be the design competition and the advice of the Committee<br />
on this will clearly be needed.<br />
The arrangements I have outlined are designed to ensure that<br />
all the talents needed to advance this great project will be<br />
available in a sensible and co-ordinated way. The interests and<br />
requirements of the Parliament remain pre-eminent and our<br />
proposals are designed to that end. </p>
<p>A procedure for selection of an architect was proposed in the<br />
Joint Standing Committee's third report. In general the<br />
Government believes the procedures set out there are appropriate,<br />
but we feel that the new Authority should also be involved<br />
immediately it is established.<br />
I take this opportunity to foreshadow the intention that a<br />
design competition will be conducted, broadly along the lines<br />
of the recommendations in the third Report. In brief, these<br />
were as follows: invitation to architects registered in<br />
Australia to enter a design competition; selection of a few of<br />
the best entrants for development of their ideas to a second<br />
stage; selection of the winning architect and development of<br />
that architect's design.<br />
The total project cost has been estimated at $ 151 million in<br />
May 1978 prices, and funds will be progressively required over<br />
the next ten years.<br />
Significant expenditure will not be incurred for some years<br />
yet, with the larger annual costs falling in the years 1983-87.<br />
Over the last ten years, in 1977-78 prices, an average of<br />
$ 165 million per annum has been spent by the Government on<br />
capital works in Canberra under N. C. D. C. programmes.<br />
The Government believes that it can encompass the construction<br />
of Parliament House within the same order of annual expenditure<br />
on capital programmes for Canberra over the next ten years, and<br />
the expenditure in relation to the new Parliament House will be<br />
taken into account when decisions are made on other public<br />
buildings.<br />
When this Parliament House was constructed in 1927, it was built<br />
as a provisional accommodation, with facilities and services of<br />
a corresponding standard. Over the years, piecemeal extensions<br />
and alterations have been made to the building. . The total area<br />
is now about two and a half times that of the original building. </p>
<p>All Honourable Members know that this accommodation, having<br />
grown haphazardly over the years, is not suited to the needs<br />
of a modern Parliament. The simple fact is that the<br />
Parliament is hampered in the performance of its works in<br />
this building. It would clearly be extraordinarily difficult<br />
to renovate or modify this building to provide necessary<br />
services and facilities for the years ahead.<br />
I should also say that if a new Parliament House is not<br />
built in the near future, it will be necessary to proceed<br />
immediately with substantial extensions to the present<br />
building, extensions which could not be more than a shortterm<br />
stop-gap.<br />
We believe that expenditure of funds on the present building<br />
other than those for essential maintenance would not be<br />
responsible. As a corollary of the decision to proceed<br />
with the new Parliament House, it will need to be accepted<br />
that there will have to be maximum restraint in respect of<br />
additional expenditure on this building. That will mean<br />
that Senators and Members will have to accept basically the<br />
present facilities in the period until the new building<br />
becomes available.<br />
The Government recognises that this decision not to proceed<br />
with short-term expedients will impose upon all those who<br />
work in Parliament House a further measure of inconvenience.<br />
Nonetheless, we believe this inconvenience is justified in<br />
the interests of finding a permanent solution to the problem<br />
of adequately housing the Parliament.<br />
The design of Parliament House will give an unparallelled<br />
opportunity for the architectural design and building skills<br />
of Australians. Here in the Parliamentary triangle, we have!<br />
our great National Library and the new National Gallery and<br />
High Court are already under construction.<br />
The new Parliament House which is now to be built will take<br />
its place amongst the other great buildings which symbolise<br />
our culture, learning and system of justice. It will be the<br />
centrepoint of modern Canberra, the peak of the Parliamentary<br />
triangle, the hub of the Government of the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia, a place in which the affairs of the nation can<br />
be conducted in a more efficient way.<br />
Australians justifiably take pride in this city, which is<br />
the symbol of our nationhood. The new Parliament House will<br />
greatly enhance the national capital, and it will also be a<br />
focal point for the ever-increasing number of Australians<br />
and visitors from overseas who wish to see at first hand the<br />
centre of Australian democracy. </p>
<p>The symbolic importance of the new Parliament House is made<br />
even more important by our anticipation that the opening of<br />
the building will take place in 1988, the bicentennial of the<br />
first European settlement in Australia.<br />
Since that settlement, Australians by working together as<br />
a people sharing common ideals and a common purpose, have<br />
achieved great things. The decision to proceed now with<br />
the design and building of Parliament House reflects a<br />
confidence in the future, in which the people of this nation<br />
can justifiably share.<br />
The 1980' s, the decade of our bicentennial will be a period<br />
of optimism and excitement, a period of growth and development.<br />
I am certain that in this decade by working together with<br />
determination, with common purpose and the sense of national<br />
unity, which the new Parliament House itself will symbolise,<br />
we can make Australia the great country we know it can be.<br />
I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has written<br />
to inform me that the unanimous view of the executive of the<br />
Parliamentary Labor Party is in favour of proceeding with a<br />
new and permanent Parliament House. It is fitting that both<br />
Government and Opposition should concur in their views on<br />
the construction of a House which symbolises our unity as a<br />
nation, which is an expression of our joint pride, faith<br />
and confidence in Australia. OOOO00000000 </p>
