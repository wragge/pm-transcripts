CL:-10 JAN 1968<br />
Tariff Changes<br />
( Statement by the Prime Minister<br />
and Minister for Trade and Industry<br />
Mr. J. McEwen)<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and<br />
Industry, Mr. J. McEwen, today announced a number of<br />
tariff changes which would operate iiarediately.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the changes would add to<br />
the tariff preferences which Australia accorded to certain<br />
manufactured, semi-manufactured and handicraft products<br />
imported from less-developed countries. They would also<br />
provide, he said, for amendments to special rates for<br />
Canada and New Zealand which were consequential to the<br />
Kennedy Round tariff changes which he introduced into<br />
the House of Representatives on 19th October.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that details of the tariff changes<br />
had been published in the Commonwealth Gazette and were<br />
also available from Collectors of Customs in all State<br />
capitals and from the Departments of Trade and Industry<br />
and Customs and Excise in Canberra.<br />
