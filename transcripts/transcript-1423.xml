TRESS, RADIO AND TELEVISION CONEIRENCE GIVEN BY<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. LHAROLD HOLT AT TOWNSVILLE<br />
( A: BERLEY AIR FORCE BASE)<br />
Â® i 23rd October, 1966<br />
HR. H OLT This has clearly been a most successful visit anC: far<br />
exceeded my own bright expectations of it when I knew it was to<br />
come about. The Australian people have responded magnificently<br />
and, of course, both for the President and Mrs. Johnson this has<br />
been a great personal triumph. I am sure. mQet Australians feel<br />
that they have a much more realistic r~ pSrj ltR~ se wonderful<br />
people now they have come close to them in the course of this<br />
visit. I want to speak now, not so much of the personal side of it<br />
but of the significance and implications for this country, for the<br />
United States itself, for other friendly countries, and indeed for<br />
the world as a whole, because what has happened as a result of<br />
this visit to New Zealand and Australia and I have no doubt that<br />
as the President proceeds through the rest of his extensive and<br />
arduous itinerary we shall have accentuated what I am about to<br />
suggest. That is that there will have been a concentratior, in these<br />
various parts of the world on this area, on the problems we are<br />
trying to cope with, on the meaning of the Viet Nam conflict itself.<br />
That can't fr. il to be useful, I believe, in making for a deeper<br />
understanding ef our objectives and how we are going about them.<br />
It will also encourage attention to the Manila Conference itself.<br />
Never in the history of this country that I can recall has there<br />
been such concentrated attention through the public media on<br />
an official visit, and with more than 90 per cent. of the Australian<br />
people able to take advantage of televised programmes, they have<br />
been able to keep close to the events. You people in all sections<br />
of the public communications media have done a wonderful job.<br />
You have conveyed faithfully to the Australian people, and to that<br />
wider audience beyond Australia just what has been happening in<br />
realistic, exciting, intere-tin terms that has made its great<br />
contribution to the success of the visit. But we will have,<br />
as I say, this concentration on the area and its problems.<br />
Inside Australia itself, I am sure this will be of value as<br />
bringing wider support for the undertakings of the Government<br />
and our actions in relation to these obligations. It will make<br />
more clearly known American purpose and that of our allies in<br />
relation to these problems. And I speak not only of Viet Nam<br />
in the sense of resolving a military conflict there,<br />
but in iManila we shall be thinking, after we have reviewed the<br />
current military situation, of the positive and constructive<br />
opportunities that will be open to us to better the lot of the<br />
South Vietnamese even while hostilities proceed; butes we<br />
talk together, I am sure we will be thinking also of what can<br />
be done in relation to the area as a whole how these age-old<br />
enemies of mankind, not the human enemies but the enemies of<br />
which the President spoke so eloqently poverty, disease and<br />
short life expectancy and illiteracy, the lack of the amenities<br />
of life that have meant so much to us. These are things<br />
which I know he wants to be dealing with in a practical and<br />
helpful way. And if the conference succeeds in developing<br />
along these lines, then I believe it will have made a: notable<br />
contribution to human advancement which could, in its<br />
consequences, become a quite historic landmark in the history<br />
of mankind. It is encouraging to know that the Australian view<br />
of how the conference should run, its agenda, the objectives we<br />
should be seeking, are so closely in line with those of the<br />
President and his advisers. I am sure that this is true also<br />
of New Zealand. I have just welcomed the Prime iinister of<br />
New Zealand who, with his official party, will be joining me<br />
on the aircraft we have charturedto take the Australian party to<br />
Manila. We have hopes, but not, I think over-optimistic hopes. / 2 </p>

HOLT ( Contd.)<br />
We realise how difficult it is in a few short days to produce<br />
practical results, but I am sure this will be . a valuable<br />
forward step. We can't fail to develop a more siglificant<br />
and deeper understanding of each other's viewpoints and-recommendations,<br />
and to this extent, there will be an advance made<br />
in our common objectives.<br />
I hope when I come back in a few days and report,<br />
perhaps through many of you here today to the Australian people,<br />
that I shall have news for you and be able to indicate that real<br />
progress has been made. Thank you.<br />
1R. EGGLETON Gentlemen, just one or two questions perhaps.....<br />
Q. Do you think that the visit of the President has given<br />
you encouragement for the Manila talks, Mr. Prime Minister?<br />
1IR. HOLT It certainly has. I think Australia was a tonic and<br />
an encouragement to him. As you know, I have been travelling<br />
with him, at his own request to these functions and to the various<br />
cities he has visited and we have been able to have much good<br />
talk together. And he has reacted in a most positive way<br />
and in a most obvious way so far as I have been concerned<br />
anyhow to the warmth of the welcome he has received. It has<br />
been a remarkable welcome, capped by this visit to Townsville<br />
which holds so much sentimental meaning for him. I knew all<br />
along that this would be on his itinerary not because he had<br />
said so, but from what I knew of the man, I felt he could not<br />
come to Australia and not pay a visit to a city which had meant<br />
so much to him. This w; as apparent right through this morning's<br />
proceedings. Of course, the warmth, the friendliness, the<br />
enthusiasm which he has felt as he has gone around, on his<br />
admission to me has. far exceeded anything he has known in the<br />
United States. And for a political leader, even a great<br />
political leader, it is comforting to know that you are popular<br />
and that what you are doing is so widely supported. It has<br />
been a success not only from our point of view: but a success<br />
in many ways fro..: his own point of view.<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, you have selected the similarities between<br />
your view and that of the United States. Are there, at this<br />
stage, any points of difference between you?<br />
MR. HOLT Not that I am avware of. We shall perhaps discover,<br />
as we hold our discussions together, that there are differences<br />
of emphasis. One of us might want to spend more time on one<br />
aspect of the agenda than the other, but I didn't detect any<br />
differences which were significant enough to be noted in our<br />
talks together. In fact,-I could say quite frankly that there<br />
were no differences ' I could bring to mind anC mention to you here.<br />
Q. Are you more confident now about your prospects for the<br />
general elections than you werc say, last Thursday morning?<br />
i. R. i-OLT Well the short answer is I don't think it has<br />
done us any harm, but I was confident of victory long before<br />
President Johnson came to this country,<br />
Q. Do you think it has changed the views of the Australian<br />
people on Viet iTam?<br />
IR HOLT: I wouldn't claim that, but I do think it has brought a<br />
better understanding for many of those who may have been in some<br />
doubt about the rightness of our objectives. This morning, the<br />
President himself made pointed reference to the fact that in<br />
a democracy, the views even of a minority must be treated with<br />
respect and assured of public mention. And this has been done<br />
in Australia. No-one could deny that. Ours is a robust, forthright<br />
democracy and the people have had an opportunity to consider </p>
<p>MR. HOLT ( Contd.) both sets of views. But what does, I think,<br />
come into the situation is the fact that this State of<br />
Queensland has always struck me as being more conscious of the<br />
threats which can come to Australia than I1aye the more southern<br />
parts of Australia. You are closer, in your experience, to the<br />
threat of invasion. You have knovwn of the activity which<br />
developed in Townsville itself during the last world war, and<br />
there is the fact that the Coral Sea Battle was fought so close<br />
to the people of this northern area. He was impressed by that<br />
I '-know the warmth and enthusiasm and biendliness without<br />
so far as I could detect in Townsville one sour face being<br />
encountered, or one critical banner being displayed.<br />
MR. EGGLETON: I am sorry, gentlemen. Our aircraft is waiting<br />
so that will have to be all. A </p>
