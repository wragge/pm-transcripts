The Advisory Council is an essential feature of the<br />
Federalism policy of the Commonwealth Government. The<br />
Council was established in 1976 with the object of<br />
improving inter-government co-, operation It receives<br />
references from the Premiers' Conference to keep under<br />
consideration and review issues involving intergovernment<br />
co-operation and recommends ways and means<br />
for improving inter-government co-operation.<br />
The inclusion of two Northern Territory representatives<br />
on the Advisory Council will add a new dimension to<br />
the Council: that of a Government in transition to<br />
Statehood; and of a government that is in a position<br />
to view afresh the structures and practices that have<br />
been established to underoin Australia's Federal<br />
system of government.<br />

Council will have 24 members representing Commonwealth,<br />
state, Northern Territory and local government and the<br />
community. The National Secretariat is located on<br />
Hobart. </p>
