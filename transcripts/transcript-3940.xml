PRIME MINISTER'S WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
THE THREAT TO RECOVERY<br />
26 October 1975<br />
During the past week we have had brought home to us<br />
the harsh practical consequences of the Opposition's refusal<br />
to pass the Budget. The violence done to our democratic<br />
institutuions is monstrous enough, but the violence being<br />
threatened to Australia's economy is scarcely less serious.<br />
In its crab for power, in its bid to overturn the elected<br />
Gover.-.. ent, the Opposition is threatening the whole difficult<br />
and fra ile process of economic recovery at the very time<br />
when the first real signs of recovery are beginning to<br />
appear. During the debate on the Budget a month ago I warned<br />
that nothing would be more harmful to Australia's economy<br />
than a * wholly unnecessary constitutional crisis engineered<br />
by the Cpposition. I pointed out that the Budget must be<br />
given a chance to work. By refusing to pass the Budget,<br />
the Opposition is denying that chance. They don't care<br />
about the consequences to the economy. They don't care<br />
about the effects on employment, on business confidence,<br />
on consumer spending or on anything else. They cheerfully<br />
contemplate the wreckage and disruption of the Australian<br />
economyn as long as they get their way.<br />
The Opposition has the gall to claim that the Budget<br />
has failed a Budget which they won't even pass through<br />
the Parliament. They say the Budget isn't working when it<br />
hasn't even been passed. Yet when we look at the latest<br />
figures we can see that the Government's economic policies<br />
are working. On Thursday the consumer price index for the<br />
September quarter was issued by the Statistician. It<br />
showed an increase of 0.8 percent a strikingly low<br />
figure, and the fourth consecutive quarter in which the<br />
rate of price increases has fallen.<br />
Now I don'twant to make too much of that figure.<br />
It would be tempting to claim, by multiplying that figure<br />
by four, that Australia's annual inflation rate is only<br />
3.2 percent, the lowest in the western world. After all,<br />
that's how Mr Lynch, the shadow Treasurer, interpreted previous<br />
quarterly cost-of-living figures: he multiplied them by<br />
four and called that the annual rate of inflation. Well,<br />
I'd be happy for Mr Lynch to tell us now that Australia's<br />
rate of inflation is the lowest in the world, but we have to<br />
be auite realistic about this. We have to remember that<br />
inflation is still a problem in most comparable countries and<br />
that Australia has a long hard battle ahead before inflation<br />
is beaten compoletely. What we can fairly claim is this: / 2 </p>
<p>the latest encouraging figures on the prices front are due<br />
largely to the success of our wage indexation policies.<br />
Wage indexation is an immensely fragile and sensitive<br />
experiment. With goodwill on all sides it can work.<br />
It has taken months of negotiations with the unions and months<br />
of argument before the Arbitration Commission to bring<br />
indexation about. Nothing would be more likely to shatter<br />
the unions' cooperation and put wage indexation at risk than<br />
the Opposition's reckless attack on the elected Government<br />
and the resulting economic disruption.<br />
Let's recall what is in the Budget which the<br />
COposition is holding up. And let's remember that at no<br />
time has the Opposition proposed any credible alternative.<br />
About 3 million Australians something like two-thirds of<br />
all taxpayers will benefit from substantial. tax cuts.<br />
About half a million present taxpayers will be freed from<br />
i: come tax entirely. Pensioners and low-income earners will<br />
gain the greatest benefit. The average wage-earner will pay<br />
almost 30 percent less tax on overtime and additional earnings.<br />
The family man with a wife and two children will be able to<br />
earn more than $ 100 a week free of tax. The old system of<br />
deductions, which favoured the wealthy, will be replaced<br />
by a system of rebates which is fair to everyone. The Government<br />
has introduced a new tax deal for all Australians. What is the<br />
Opposition's alternative? They want double taxation a return<br />
to the discredited system of pre-war years, when the States<br />
imposed income taxes on top of the federal tax, and the smaller<br />
States were worse off than the others.<br />
SFor all of us in Canberra it's been interesting<br />
to see the growing panic and desperation of the Opposition<br />
reflected in their conduct in Parliament. Mr Fraser and his<br />
deputy have resorted to wild and unsubstantiated charges against<br />
Government ministers. Mr Fraser himself made a scandalous and<br />
quite unfounded attack on Frank Crean, the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
accusing him of leaking a confidential document to the Opposition.<br />
The charge was promptly denied. It was baseless. Mr Lynch<br />
then tried to revive his pet Khemlani business by asking a<br />
question based on a newspaper report, and completely ignored<br />
the fact that in the very same newspaper there was a statement<br />
by an Adelaide solicitor denying the report on which the<br />
question was based. The Opposition will stop at nothing to<br />
smear ministers and even implicate their personal staff in<br />
phony charges of misconduct. This week Mr Fraser accused the<br />
Australian Statistician, an officer completely independent of<br />
the Government, of producing fraudulent cost-of-living figures.<br />
The most contemptible aspect of the Opposition's conduct has<br />
been an attempt to put pressure on the Governor-General<br />
himself. We've read and seen their desperate appeals to get<br />
the Governor-General to dismiss the Prime Minister and<br />
presumably install Mr Fraser instead.<br />
The confusion and contradiction of the Opposition in<br />
this affair have been unbelievable. This week, when we<br />
submitted our Budget bills again to the House of Representatives<br />
every Opposition member voted against them in every division.<br />
Yet when the bills went before the Senate the Opposition resorted<br />
to its old stalling tactics and deferred the bills without<br />
actually voting against them. They lack the courage of their own </p>
<p>3.<br />
convi~ ctions. They denounce the Budgct buat ha-ven' t the quts<br />
to vo,-eo aqjain st it. They oppose it in on-e Ho1use butL defer it<br />
in the other. They block the money for running the nation's<br />
affairs, and then claim that_ there's no cons tituti onal<br />
crisis. For months they've criedi doomi and disaster arid<br />
tried to panic the Australian people, buit now, as the full<br />
meaningT of their action dawns upon them, they assure us that<br />
evervthina is normal, that there's no cr. Lsis at all.<br />
They go on parroting the sloga2n that the people must<br />
choose who the Goverinrent should be. Thr-: e fact is that the<br />
-eonle have made that choice. ' Ih* ey made it17 months ago<br />
