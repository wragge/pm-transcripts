PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 April 1987<br />
The Government's newly established Advisory Council on<br />
Multicultural Affairs is to prepare a National Agenda for a<br />
Multicultural Australia. I proposed this to the Council at<br />
its inaugural meeting in Canberra today.<br />
The National Agenda will comprise a program of specific<br />
priorities that will translate our policy of<br />
multiculturalism into a series of concrete initiatives.. It<br />
will need to be developed on the basis of consultation with<br />
a broad range of community interests.<br />
My Government sees multiculturalism as a key social policy<br />
which significantly affects all Australians. It is central<br />
to the pursuit of social justice. There is a need to ensure<br />
that all Australians, regardless of ethnic origins, are able<br />
to enjoy equal life chances.<br />
Through the National Agenda, the Council is being asked to<br />
assess how far Australia has come in achieving these<br />
objectives, and to chart future directions. I envisage that<br />
the Agenda will incorporate policies designed to promote<br />
equity and access in both the public and private sectors, as<br />
well as plans for effective community education.<br />
In determining a National Agenda for a Multicultural<br />
Australia, the Council will look at such areas as the law,<br />
education, employment, health, media, culture, women's and<br />
youth affairs, trade unions and business.<br />
I am confident that the varieties of talents represented in<br />
the Council will ensure that it is well placed to provide<br />
the Government with the best possible advice.'<br />
The 22-member Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs is<br />
charged with providing advice to me and the Minister<br />
Assisting, Mr Young, on ways in which the Government might<br />
advance its objective of encouraging the further development<br />
of our multicultural society. It is chaired by Justice Sir<br />
James Gobbo, of the Victorian Supreme Court, and includes Mr<br />
George Wojak ( Deputy Chairperson), of the Federation of the<br />
Ethnic Communities, Councils of Australia; Mr David Brydon,<br />
Managing Director of ACI International Ltd; Sir Nicholas<br />
Shehadie, Chairman of SBS; and Mr Simon Crean, President of<br />
the ACTU. The Advisory Council, the full composition of<br />
which is attached, will be supported in developing the<br />
National Agenda by the new office of Multicultural Affairs<br />
within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </p>
<p>The National Agenda will look to a multicultural future in<br />
which all Australians, irrespective of background, are able<br />
to participate fully in national life, in which community<br />
resources are fairly available to all, and in which the<br />
skills and abilities of all Australians can be harnessed<br />
without barriers of discrimination and prejudice.<br />
An action-orientated Agenda will make a major contribution<br />
to my Government's commitment to equity. I see<br />
multiculturalism as central to enhancing the quality of life<br />
for the next generation of Australians. </p>
