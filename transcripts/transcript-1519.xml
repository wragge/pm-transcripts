LUNCHEON, CAN3BRRA. A. C. T.<br />
Spech by the Prime Minister Mr. H: Lrold Holt M rch, 1967.<br />
On the 10th Marcr 1967 the Prime inister of<br />
Australia, Mr. Holt, attended a luncheon in the<br />
honour of the National C. pital Plarnin. Cormmnittee<br />
on the occasion of the final meeting oT their<br />
three year term.<br />
Mr. Holt first expressed thanks and appreciation<br />
to the Committee and to . the Chairman, ir. J. U.<br />
Overall the National Capitial Development<br />
Com,.: ijioner.<br />
The Prime Minister then continued<br />
I nm here as a resident a goid part of the time as<br />
an observer now for very many years and ' by their works ye shall<br />
know them'. I think if th: t text is applied to you and the<br />
members of your Committee, Chalirnan, you would get a unanimous<br />
vote of arproval from all around Australia.<br />
Je hve seen uildin here, before our eyes w-ith the<br />
passage of time a truly oeautif l city and a setting hich gives<br />
it an individua ity and marks it out as one of the really l-vely<br />
Capital cities of he world.<br />
I . o buck thirty-one years plus and the transformation<br />
which hai. s occurred, more narticularly over { he recent years, is<br />
to me truly remarkaole. I cmn remeoer when I set off on one<br />
occasion with Jeoff Stc.: et und Jim Fairbairn later to oe killed<br />
in that trugic accident ; hich helped to ive the airport its<br />
name and walked from Parliament House to the National V. ar<br />
Meorial. No., of course I : ould have to take the flippers and<br />
the mask, and snorkel, if I -ere to attempt that journey again<br />
and this is one of the major tr-insformations which have occurred<br />
in the spectacular growth of the city its layout, the actual<br />
pulling together of the outlyipg parts which could not be so<br />
clearly perceived until the ake . as there to jive a sort of<br />
focal centre to them.<br />
but tnia is not . n easy ob which we hatve set you.<br />
It . ould be difficult enough, I thin to plan a lovely city if<br />
you could take your time acout the development of it and if you<br />
had unlimited funds availale to you for your purposes.<br />
Here you don't merely have the sort of restraints<br />
which a responsible 3overnment feels necessary to impose on any<br />
one section of n-tional growth in the interests of others, and'<br />
although It ink re h 4ve treated the Bt-tional C-it 1 by no means<br />
unreasonaoly, I knojz thtt you h-tve felt at times that the<br />
limitations we have placed on you have held dovn the rate of growth<br />
rather more thin you . ould have desired. Yet the performance itself<br />
indicates that we haven't been too nig ; ardly in that regard. At<br />
the thing which really complicates your task enormously, I imapine,<br />
is that you have not merely the problem of ouilding a ueautifui / 2<br />
R. TII'I cArIT:: II)_. L~ C01U. IS0-IOTK </p>
<p>-2-<br />
C-iital City, but of copin with a city population growing more<br />
rapidly than in any other city of size around Australia.<br />
You have got to satisfy the customers who are there<br />
who feel the need for the engineering services that you've put<br />
in; who want to see tres trow w; here they've selected a fairly<br />
oare site as a building sile; who ' ant to feel they'ce -irt of<br />
a fine city and you've got to do all that for them and at the<br />
same time uild a capital which will be a source of national pride<br />
in itself. And, I think, you have succeeded admirably in bot<br />
these directions. The resident of Canberra must feel that his standard<br />
of service and of accommodation compares very favourably with<br />
that of other parts of the Commonwealth and ri-ht through the<br />
period that accompanies this normal uroan growth. You've got<br />
the ouilding of impressive official buildings, of building up<br />
the commercial centres of the national city and all the rest of<br />
it that goes with w: hat is now, I gather, just on a city of 100,000<br />
souls, and rising, what? 100 or tiereabouts?<br />
Commissioner About seven or eight.<br />
Mr. Holt Yes, we have steadied it down a oit I gather. Anyhow,<br />
that is still a very rapid rate of growth for any city to have to<br />
cope with. You have mentioned one or two things which haven't<br />
altogether pleased your Committee e! emoers. The critic, I suppose,<br />
can always find room for improvement.<br />
I, myself, have puzzled for many years and Sir<br />
Rooert disclaimed any responsibility himselT but I could not<br />
find anybody who would claim any responsibility for the King Jeorge<br />
Statue and I know it is one of Doug's ambitions either to bomb<br />
it or to remove it. Even diurin the earlier periods where there<br />
were threats to Australian security, I could only hope that if<br />
we were so unfortunate as to have an enemy attack, they would<br />
choose their targets skilfully.<br />
And so he will have my moral, parliamentary and<br />
ministerial support in action he takes to restore that sweep,<br />
and that sense of proportion which did previously exist in the<br />
vista between Parliament House and the ' ar i: emorial oy the<br />
removal of this particular excrescence.<br />
I am glad to know that you are so amenable to practical,<br />
sensible suggestion that ooth you and the Minister have responded<br />
so readily to my urgings that we convert the cowtrack from the<br />
Airrort into Ci'berra into something a little more respectable;<br />
and the edging which is now going on again has excited my warm<br />
approval. But to do these things in a ractical way coping<br />
with the growing population providin stndards which will at<br />
the one time be a model to the rest of Australia, but won't oe<br />
so far in advamce of the rest of Australia as to create resentment<br />
and acrimony aro nd the other Capital Cities, is a task which calls<br />
for judgment and discrimination, good sense and a-ain I repeat,<br />
I believe you have achieved these things remarkaoly e. ll<br />
It is not so many yeasa. itht ; ie diplomats<br />
appointed to this country, foud. th it fhe amenities in C.: nperra<br />
were so. lacking, that they / had to oase themselves rather uneasily<br />
either in Sydney or occasionally in LMelbournei </p>
<p>4 -3-<br />
I think that appointment to the Australian scene was<br />
re. arded almost in the sense of a period of solitary confinement.<br />
How'ever, I am sure the doyen of the Corps would concede that now<br />
there is quite a degree ol competition to secure appointment to<br />
Australia and in particulir to Canberra as the national centre and<br />
undoubtedly not only has the improvement in Canberra itself helped<br />
to attract the Diplomatic Corps to C noerra but the oresence in<br />
Canoerra of the Diplomatic Corps with their ow'n distinguished<br />
buildings has added to the attraction of the capital city itself.<br />
I am told that we are now attracting just on 600,000<br />
tourists a year. It seems an extraordinary figure to me but I<br />
am in no nosition to c-tilene it and, if it is a fact, then I<br />
think it demonstrates not only that Canoerra: itself has developed<br />
great attractiveness but there is a growing pride around Australia<br />
in the National C-pital.<br />
I can recall as even some of my more recently-acquired<br />
collea ues the sort of controversy that used to go on even at the<br />
time . en we were building the lake people resentful of C: tnberra's<br />
expenditures and contrasting this ,. ith our failure to provide so<br />
much for the things they needed in their centre. 3ut that's been<br />
a diminishing factor almost to vanishimn point.<br />
And today one senses a very different spirit around<br />
the country. People are proud of Canberra, they flock to Canberra<br />
and in that process, I think they have learned to take a growing<br />
interest in the national Parliament in Canberra and in all these<br />
directions your activities have helped.<br />
May I say to those you have mentioned who served on the<br />
Committee for the oeriod of nine years how, grateful we are to them<br />
for the contribution they have made and indeed to thank you all<br />
for what you have done in this honorary way eating into your spare<br />
time and dra-in on your professional talets, the skills and the<br />
experience whicH you so ably possess. All this is deserving of the<br />
appreciation of your Xovernment of the . iustralian people.<br />
So thank you very much for all that you have done and<br />
all that you will ie doing for the growth and oeauty of this Capital<br />
of ours and my thanks to you Mr. Chairman for the opportunity to be<br />
ith you to say thank you and enjoy your company.<br />
