KEATINO, M. P.<br />
KMI 1U HOUSE) SYDNEY<br />
MONDAY 10 JANUARY, 1994<br />
PM: The Govcrnmcnt has today substant~ ally inCrease the disastr relief payment<br />
under the social security system, which Will triple it in Many ase$* for familles, to<br />
just under $ 2000 wad over $ 1000* for a single person. Now, this will be paid to<br />
people who have had their homes damaged or whose Income has been severely<br />
dbslocaed for Instanc firefighters who've not been paid by their eniployt<br />
would qualf. And we've already Issued cheques this morning through the<br />
Department of Social Security, particularly to 8omc of the rcsldens of lannali and<br />
those arvas, and there Is a Social Security holint through which " eoil can<br />
caquirv and have these things paid.<br />
So, the Governent takes the view that this is a natural disaster and a very large<br />
one, the most significant bushflrt we've seen, and It Is appropriate that the<br />
Commonwealth G3overnment help people tougb this period with these<br />
Immediate and peisonal payrments.<br />
J: How will people be a&amp;% essed?<br />
PM: This payment is not Income tested or asst tested. It Is only on the basis of<br />
whether their homes have been damag&amp; d or destroyed, whether they have SWUMfr<br />
material income loss In thc coune of the fire or fighting the fire. So, for instace,<br />
it won't be paid to somcbody who has simply been evacuated and is coming back<br />
t0 their house which is undamaged. But It would be paid to others who have<br />
suffered an employment loss or loss of Income.<br />
1; will this include volunaccr fircfightezs who have lost income?<br />
FM: It will include voluntccr firefghters who have lost Income. Volunteer firefigters<br />
WiO'Ve lost iriCAMC Or have not been paid by their employer we would be able<br />
to pay thcrn this paymcnt. TE0L.: Jan. 94 14: 37 No. 013 P. 01/ 05 </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
1: is therm a limit on the amount Of Monty?<br />
PM:; Well, it's a formula and It would depend on whether sorttone is single, married or<br />
with children and it rises accordingy. With two children under 13 it's about<br />
$ 2000), roughly.<br />
3: How many people do you think would be eliible?<br />
PM: Well, it's very hard to say. But, obviously, with the nature and the extent of the<br />
devastat ion It's going to be quite a significant number of payments.<br />
3: So It's Social Security who are doing the " aissins and proessing?<br />
PM: Soal Security regional offices will handle all of the processing and the paymns.<br />
And, as I'vc said, quite a number of cheques have already been paid this morning.<br />
J: Where will the funding come from?<br />
PM: its hrm the Commonwealth Department of Finance through the Department of<br />
Social Security.<br />
3: Ins ems of the ftr % ie and emergency workers would you like to wso= r<br />
SW1 of public re~ ntion or tribut for them?<br />
PMK: Well, I think this has beent a magnificent effort on the part of the firefighting<br />
strvices. The fact that we have lost 155 hoimes, or thereabouts too many of<br />
course for those who have lost them but considering the scale of the fires Irs<br />
been a very successful firefighting effoil, A Succes only guaraniteed by the<br />
professionalism of those engaged and the volunteets; that is, those who help<br />
occasionally with irefighting and who are engaged, If you like, as part time<br />
firefighters and those ordinary people whove, just docided to pitch in. I think it's<br />
been an absolutely wonderful effort and, as! I said a couple of days ago, it's<br />
Australia at Its begt you see the best things about the country coming out of it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, should you have come back from holidays sooner to deal with this<br />
matter?<br />
PM: No, well, I was back a day or two the acting Prime Minister was dealing with<br />
thIfs matitr from thc moment It became a probleml beyond the normal capacity of<br />
the firefighting s'ervices. And I was kcept Informed and a day later! I had an<br />
Inspection of the area.<br />
J: Does forest managemen nedt er Asse at this time?<br />
PM: Forest management is essentially a Statc issue, particularly in terms of fire control,<br />
and no doubt the state gnvernment will asseess the questions about bumn backs and<br />
T1EL0: . Jan. 94 14: 37 No. 013 P. 02/ 05 </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
all of thc other preventative things which could be material to diminishing the<br />
impac of lage fires. And Also, I tik educating communities who ame In<br />
vulnerable: areas about how they might protect their hom est. lBecause most of tiee<br />
homes awe lost through the rooft. They start burnin in the roots AMs and if thene<br />
In pitcction of the toofs the likelihood is many of the homts, In Jannalli for<br />
Instance, might have been saved. So, this Is something that I think Is worth<br />
assessing after all of this and, no doubt, the whole campaign will be assessed. But,<br />
one would have to Say therm has been expriednce brought to this frmfighting effort<br />
from Past fires and the Success thcroforc, Is, I think, pretty obvious.<br />
I: Can you give us an assessmnrt of how much this IS goinl; to cost Australia In<br />
dollar terms&amp;?<br />
PM: Not I can't do that. I think it would be impossible. There ame obviously big<br />
property losses and then there art also all the other things like timber resources, fot<br />
harvestig, which would have gone. So, at this stage, I think it's impossible to sy.<br />
J: ( inaudible) defence force personnel a bit earlier to help out7<br />
PM: No, there was not a question about bringing them in a bit earler, they came in<br />
whcn they were needed. Normally when fire start they are uinder the control of<br />
emergency bushflnc fighting services and I think you'll fnd Mr Kope" br and<br />
atiers tell you that the cooperation that they'Vc had with the Defence Department<br />
has been exemplary. We've had, really, more reserves and equipment available<br />
than can be used. T hat's still the cane today.<br />
3: NSW has been asking the Federal Government to contribute more to the cost of<br />
Infrastructure, rebuilding etc. Would you consider that?<br />
PM: Well. we're meeting half the cost of fightg the fire because fighting the fire Itself<br />
Is just a very large cost in Itself. Now, normally this would be met by NSW, we'r<br />
going to mecet half of that. But, for the replacement of Infrastructure and other<br />
thin&amp; s themc Is a set of arrangements In place. Thc National Disaster Relief<br />
Arrangemcnts ( NDRA) which has an assessed formula where a state picks up the<br />
first millions at 100 percent and then the Commonwealth comes in for<br />
percent and there's a formula where the Commonwealth picks up more thereafter.<br />
Now, the Premier has asked me to look at that and I've said to hinm to give us any<br />
advice which is germane to the question of the peculiarities of this particular<br />
circumstance and why the NDRA may not be entirely appropriate on this occasion.<br />
We'll look at that but I think in the first instance the main thing is to help them in<br />
the cost of fighting the fire and to help people who've becn affcctcd by thc fi1res<br />
and to keep Commonwealth defence resources wherever they're needed until the<br />
fires are put out.<br />
J: Should the defence -force put more emphasis on firefighting in training and those<br />
sorts Of thills? T1E0L:. Jan. 94 14: 37 No. 013 P. 03/ 05 </p>
<p>TEL 4<br />
PM: Well, I think te defence forces have been no only very, very Useft In the<br />
deployments which we've bad In helicopters and in petso tel, In evacuation and to<br />
fighting fires, but I think they'll probably be very useful in the mopping up<br />
operation. Because of the numbers which they have at their disposal and also the<br />
materials so I think the ADF has been a very Cooperative force in this, rm very<br />
happy to say.<br />
1: Can you give us an Idea of when YOU think this will all be over?<br />
PM: Well I think that's a question you Should properly address to the firefighting<br />
authorities. I think thenc weather couditions, rain and Cooler weather, ha<br />
obviously got to help the containment of fires. I think you'll probably find that the<br />
flrofightlng scrvicc Is now In a containment policy with back burning so that they<br />
can limit the damage which fires might cause when weather conditions changj, U<br />
expectcd later In the week. I think the key objctive of their policy now would be<br />
to be ready for a change In the weather later in the week. So, that now, they can<br />
actually back burn and take advantage of these conditions.<br />
j Do you have a personal message for those directly affected, those who have lost<br />
homes?<br />
PM: WciI, for Mhost who have lost homes one can only exprcss one's deepest sympathy<br />
and concern to sec onc'u possessions gone, Of course, the lose. of life and the loss<br />
To those families of people ones heart goes out to them. To see people<br />
obviously devastated, their possessions, all their worldly goods gone, Is a hean<br />
reniding experience and one doesn't liko to sme that happen to ayboy least of all,<br />
particularly, the people we live amongst.<br />
j Prime Minister, it's gained worldwide attention, have you had any enquiries from<br />
other governments about what is going on here?<br />
PM: No, but I set up some enquiries myself earlier In the week, with New Zealand<br />
about whether they could help, partcularly with water bombers. 11crc were a<br />
couple of Canadian water bombers there but they've already gone bark to Canada.<br />
Isut, I did arrange for these water buckets to be delivered to Australia and, 1 think,<br />
eighty of them were delivered late yesterday on a Hercules. And, they're helping<br />
today to mount a larger anti-flie stormins effort.<br />
J: Is that equipment to be kept here or just on loan?<br />
PM: No, they're on loan for the moment but you need as much as you can bring to bear<br />
as quickly as you can Set It and whether we can use all of those I don't know, but<br />
they're going to be here anyway and some are being used today,<br />
T1EL0:. Jan. 94 14: 3? No. 013 P. 04/ 05 </p>
<p>10. Jan. 94 14: 37 No. 013 P. 05/ 05;<br />
J: ite New Zealand Goveament has also set up an appeal and donated a million<br />
dollars, what's your reaction to that?<br />
PM: Ibat's very commOdabic and I appreciate their concer. I appreciate the<br />
cooperation of the New Zealand Govemment and people in this.<br />
J: Has it been put to you or any talks been held about buying more of these buckets<br />
locally or having better equipment?<br />
PM: Well, there's always been a debate about water bombing; because of the nature of<br />
the Australian bush canopy a lot of the water actually hfts the leaves and doesnr't<br />
get to the base of the fire. And, therefore, they are obviously not as effcctive as<br />
many people think and, of couse, water, heavy water hiltting at great speed can<br />
also damage propeniy, but worse than that, affect materially the health of<br />
firefighters. So, there's no simple solution. I think the key point is if the lite is not<br />
difficult it can be fought with conventional ftirighting means if it is not<br />
difficult it doesn't need water bombing. If it is difIcult, water bombing is less<br />
effective but so, too, Is conventional firefighting. This is a very difficult problem.<br />
A bushfire has a character all of its own and is very difficult to contain. So, it is<br />
the prvntative measures, In the long run, which are woth, I think, thinking<br />
about.<br />
