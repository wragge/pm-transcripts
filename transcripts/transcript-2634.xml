OPENING OF SEVENTEENTH SEATO COUNCIL MEETING<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William McMahon<br />
M. P. 27 June, 1972.<br />
Gentlemen: I welcome you as distinguished delegates to the 17th meeting<br />
of the Council of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation.<br />
Although we are in the depths of winter here in Canberra, I assure<br />
you that our welcome to delegates and their wives, and staff, is<br />
a warm and sincere one. I particularly want to welcome General<br />
Vargas, the retiring Secretary-General. We have known him as a<br />
dynamic and energetic personality. I know, as a former delegate<br />
and so does anyone else who has been connected with SEATO that in<br />
the rugged tenacity and strength of purpose of General Vargas, SEATO<br />
has no greater champion.<br />
The South East Asian Treaty Organisation has occupied an<br />
important position in the affairs of the South East Asian region<br />
since its formation in 1954. Notwithstanding the many changes since<br />
that time, it still has a meaningful role to play so long as<br />
external threats remain to the peace and security of member and<br />
protocol states, the continuing importance of the Manila Treaty<br />
remains self-evident.<br />
That Treaty has contributed to the stability of the region<br />
for almost eighteen years and the Organisation has provided the<br />
machinery for co-operation between member countries. Neither should<br />
we forget that because of its obvious security value to regional<br />
members and protocol states SEATO also contributes to regional<br />
confidence. While the Trcaty and the organisation retain their<br />
value and relevance and they do, despite the critics my<br />
Government will continue to support and sustain the Organisation.<br />
The presence here of the distinguished regional representatives<br />
of Thailand, The Philippines and the Popublic of Vietnam and of the<br />
distinquished representative of Britain, New Zealand, and the<br />
United States, is also clear evidence of the importance these<br />
Governments continue to attach to SEATO.<br />
One has only to recall, that as recently as February of this<br />
year, President Nixon reported to the United States Congress that<br />
the Manila Treaty had made " a valued contribution to peace", and<br />
that the Treaty had been and *'-4, ill be honoured". </p>
<p>W 3.<br />
During my visit, I was very much heartened by the trend towards<br />
closer co-operation among these countries. I was very heartened<br />
by the goodwill and friendliness I found there towards my own<br />
country, and I can assure you they know we are anxious to assist<br />
them with their very real problems. It is interesting to recall that<br />
the Manila Treaty represented one of the earliest examples of<br />
regional co-operation.<br />
It is a sign of the times that the links which bind the<br />
countries of South East Asia are being progressively strengthened,<br />
by increased contacts and exchanges, and through co-operation in an<br />
increasing variety of regional organisations and arrangements.<br />
It is my wish that your deliberations at this Council meeting<br />
should be successful, and that they will contribute further to<br />
regional co-operation, progress and security. </p>
