TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE FRIDAY JUNE 29 1984<br />
HAWKE: Ladies and gentlemen, I'll just make a very brief<br />
preliminary comment and then I'll be available for your<br />
questions. I have not until today felt inclined to go into<br />
any extensive public comment or make myself available in<br />
regard to issues that would be involved with the upcoming<br />
executive and conference. The State Conferences of the<br />
parties have been going on. I did not go to those conferences,<br />
I have been asked to go to them and it wasn't appropriate<br />
or open to go to them all and we thought in the circumstances<br />
we . would go to none. But at the conferences and since<br />
participants in the conferences have quite properly, and I<br />
have no concern about that, engaged in discussions about the<br />
issues and in way at times which has involved my position<br />
and so I thought it was about time that I was available to;.<br />
comment on some of those issues and I therefore make myself<br />
available to you. I make this observation, that while I<br />
am prepared to go to these issues I don't intend to take this<br />
opportunity to exhaust the argu inents that I will be using at<br />
the Executive and the Conference on these or any other matters<br />
because I still regard it as appropriate for the full development<br />
of argu ment and decision-making to take place at those<br />
forums. But having said that I am available for any -questions<br />
you would like to address to me. you<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do/ believe Conference will vote<br />
C to support uranium mining.<br />
HAWKE: Yes, I believe it will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Mininster, Indonesia's Foreign Minister<br />
was reported this morning as saying that if. Auttralia.' s relations<br />
with-Indonesia over East Timor had reached the stage where it<br />
could be advisable for both countries to downgrade their<br />
diplomatic ties. Do you agree with that and what sort of<br />
resolution would you like to see out of the National Conference<br />
on East Timor and Indonesia?<br />
HAWKE: I appreciate that question. I am not going to enter<br />
into a detailed analysis of Dr Mochtar's observations because<br />
I don't believe that the very important question of our<br />
relations with Indonesia would be assisted by doing that.<br />
And let me also make the observation that when we're talking<br />
about relations with Indonesia, we're doing more than that.<br />
Because, inevitably given the very close political association<br />
which exists between the constituent members of ASEAN we are talking<br />
about more than Indonesia when we talk about Indonesia and<br />
therefore I simply content myself with saying in respect of<br />
the first part of your question that I don't think a downgrading<br />
I </p>
<p>-2-<br />
of relations would be in the best interests of the two<br />
countries. I will continue to be having discussions with<br />
my friend and colleague the Foreign Minister, Mr Bill Hayden,<br />
and as we have done since we have been in government, Bill and<br />
I will be attempting to have a position from Australia's point<br />
of view which will enable the maintenance of constructive<br />
relationships between our two countries because that's what<br />
is in the interests of Australians, of Indonesians and of the<br />
countries in the region. And going from that to the latter part<br />
of your quest-ion I therefore say simpl. y that I hope and I<br />
believe that the treatment of this issue by the conference<br />
will be such as to enable Bill Hayden and myself to continue<br />
along that path.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it's right that 99 Labor Party<br />
machine people should be in a position to wreck Australia's<br />
relations with its nearest neighbour.<br />
HAWKE: Well, I think that goes to a broader question. I mean<br />
it's not simply that. I think your question is broader than<br />
that. In a party such as ours, has made the decision to have<br />
open conferences and open discussions about issues, it's<br />
inevitable, Laurie, that in those circumstances, it's going<br />
to discuss a range of issues which can be potentially<br />
damaging. You picked one. All I can say is that I've got<br />
to express the hope which I do, not only in regard to that<br />
issue but to all others, that the 99 people at the Conference<br />
will understand that what they are dealing with is not simply<br />
their own view about a particular issue, but that there is<br />
an obligation upon all of us at that Conference to understand<br />
that the Labor Party is an instrument for advancing the interests<br />
and welfare of Australians. And it has always been such.<br />
More often than not it's been in Opposition and therefore in<br />
that condition of Opposition perhaps you can greater, to a<br />
greater degree, exercise the luxury of putting points of view<br />
about particular issues.. In government I believe that there<br />
will be a sharpened appreciation of the responsibility that<br />
we all have to conduct ourselves in a way which is going to)<br />
enable the continued advancement of the interests of the great<br />
majority of Australians. And from the first day that we have<br />
been in government, not only I, but I believe the government<br />
as a whole, has understood the obligations we have not simply<br />
to the Party as such, but the obligations we have to Australia.<br />
That's been the hallmark of our government. It's the basic<br />
explanation of why the stocks of this government have increased<br />
substantially since the election. Now we have been successful<br />
for that reason and I am confident that the majority of the<br />
delegates will have the same view.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, will you allow separate issues<br />
such as those of foreign banks to intrude upon issues such<br />
as East Timor?<br />
HAWKE: Will I allow issues such as the foreign...<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you approve that separate issues such as<br />
that of Indonesia and East Timor, by separate issues I mean<br />
for example, foreign banks, to intrude upon the Conference's<br />
consideration and debating on issues such as Indonesia? </p>
<p>-3<br />
HAWKE: I must confess that I have difficulty in following<br />
the question but let me make these observations which I<br />
hope are relevant to what's in your mind. The agenda of<br />
the Conference will be drawn up in a way which has area<br />
by area, dealt with economic, foreign affairs and defence,<br />
energy and resources within which uranium will come. And<br />
speaking for myself, and I would think speaking for the<br />
majority of delegates, I will address myself to the issue.:<br />
before the chair on the basis of the merits of that issue.<br />
And as far as I'm concerned, there won't be any concept<br />
of what I say on this issue will be shaped by some perception<br />
of another issue. Each issue has to live on its own merits,<br />
as far as I'm concerned.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why does the National Executive<br />
need to intervene in the decision by the State Conference,<br />
Victorian State Conference, last weekend regarding reaffiliation.<br />
HAWKE: I understand from the National Secretary that there<br />
are two pieces of correspondence either received or on the<br />
way, in respect of that issue, and the matter will, by the<br />
appropriate processes of the constitution of the Partybe<br />
before the Party. the<br />
JcJJBNALIT: Mr Hawke do you want to see/ Executive next week<br />
take a final decision on that matter and what position will<br />
you be supporting at that meeting?<br />
HAWKE: I have made it quite clear earl. ier this year in a<br />
number of public statements that I believe that any union<br />
has the right to be affiliated. I have made it quite clear<br />
on number of occasions that in respect of the unions in question<br />
here that they have the right to be affiliated. I have at all<br />
points made the distinction and I make it again, and it's<br />
very important that it be understood between the union and<br />
individuals, and let me make it clear if in respect of any<br />
individuals it is claimed and can be established that they<br />
are or have recently been members of any proscribed organisation<br />
then they as individuals, can seek, certainly they cannot<br />
expect any special treatment. They would have, if they<br />
wished to become members of the Labor Party, serve that period<br />
of waiting before being able to become members. As far as the<br />
unions are concerned, I believe that the unions have the right<br />
to be affiliated. I do not believe that you can have a situation<br />
where men and women of Victoria who are clerks, men and-women<br />
who are members of the shop assistants' union and so on with<br />
the other two unions, if they by their democratic processes<br />
have elected their leadership and by their democratic processes<br />
have-indicated a desire to be members of this Party then I believe<br />
they have the right through their unions to be members.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have a majority support on the Executive<br />
for that point of view, Prime Minister?<br />
HAWKE: I hope so.<br />
JOURNALIST: A final decision next week.<br />
HAWKE: Well I think there has been an assumption that if<br />
the National Executive is to make a decision different from </p>
<p>4<br />
that made by the Victorian Conference there may be some attempt<br />
to have the matter raised at the Conference. I would hope that<br />
if the view that I put is accepted by the Federal Executive<br />
that people would say well that's fair enough... I'm not sure<br />
that they will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you also concerned that without the union<br />
affiliation the Victorian branch remains in the hands of the<br />
Socialist Left?<br />
HAWKE: Well,-I'm not a member of the Socialist Left so the<br />
answer to that question is fairly obvious. I would prefer that<br />
within this delightful party of ours which has its factions,<br />
fractions or however you describe them. I guess its human<br />
nature that I prefer the shade to which. I belong to be more<br />
dominant. And I guess that is quite clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, Mr Hartley said two days ago, that the Left<br />
already controls four state branches and two territories and<br />
is close to controlling the Party nationally. Do you agree<br />
with. that?<br />
HAWKE: Well, I think there have been many occasions on public<br />
record in the past where I don't agree with Mr Hartley and this<br />
is another.<br />
JOURNALIST: What effect would it have if Mr Hartley was to<br />
be endorsed as number three on the Victorian Senate ticket?<br />
HAWKE: Fortunately, that's hypothetical and I am not addressing<br />
myself to a hypothetical question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you in all conscience, Mr Hawke, as Prime<br />
Minister of this country, phase out those uranium mines in<br />
the Northern Territory and stop Roxby Downs going ahead?<br />
HAWKE: I don't believe I'm going to be faced with that<br />
( i hypothetical position.<br />
JOURNALIST: What form do you expect your pro-uranium policy<br />
to take?<br />
HAWKE: I would think that the position that will be adopted by<br />
the conference would be the position which I advanced before the<br />
Caucus and for which I obtained a Caucus-majority.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what happens if the National<br />
Executive endorses your view on the unions and the Victorian<br />
state branch decides to dig in?<br />
HAWKE: Well I don't know what they'd be digging in. There<br />
are a couple of observations that one could make.<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm saying if they resist.<br />
HAWKE: The authority of the federal party is paramount.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if the Left of Victoria say that they':<br />
be pushing at Conference for a complete ban on visits to this country<br />
by nuclear powered warships. What effect would that have do<br />
you think? </p>
<p>HAWKE: Well, it's again hypothetical. I mean that's a view<br />
that they have expressed. Let me make this point, Peter,<br />
that the position of the Party has been quite clear on this;<br />
issue. I have no expectation that it will be changed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, following on from that. If<br />
a Labor government is elected in New Zealand on Saturday<br />
fortnight, how would you cope with it, the Labor pledge<br />
that there'll be no visits by nuclear-powered or armed<br />
warships to New Zealand waters. Is it the end of ANZUS<br />
as Sir Robert-. says?<br />
HAWKE: Well, we'll have to see. And let me say I wish my<br />
friend and colleague, David Lange, that in a fraternal sense<br />
good luck, although I can't interfere and don't in the<br />
process of elections over there, but we would have to<br />
see in that hypothetical situation what a Labor government<br />
would do. Now I don't know what they would do.<br />
JOURNALIST: But the policy is quite clear.<br />
HAWKE: I repeat I don't know what a Labor government would<br />
do. And what my government would do and say would have to<br />
depend upon what it was that we were looking at. I don't<br />
accept at this stage what an incoming Labor government in<br />
New Zealand would do on this issue. I don't know.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you expect to happen over the future of<br />
strategic bases in Australia, at conference?<br />
HAWKE: I've already answered that question. Well not exactly<br />
but it's in the same category as referring to the nuclear<br />
ships visits. The position of the party has been clear in<br />
the last, in recent conferences. I don't expect it to change<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what would you say to those<br />
members of your party who would either want to maintain the!<br />
C. current policy on East Timor, as in the resolution of the last<br />
conference, or even toughen it up by insisting that<br />
de-recognition take place immediately.<br />
HAWKE:' I would say, and it really is a variation on what<br />
said before, I would say that Bill Hayden is absolutely correct<br />
in what he has said publicly, he says it with my endorsement.<br />
We have maintained close communication and consultation, one<br />
with the other, on this issue, from the first day of government.<br />
Bill has very correctly said that if we are concerned, as we<br />
must be, with the interests of the people of East Timor, then<br />
we shouldn't do things which are going to make it more<br />
difficult for the Australian Government to be of relevant<br />
assistance. And I think that any course of action along the<br />
lines which are implied in your question, explicit in your<br />
question, would make it more difficult for our government<br />
to not only have constructive relations, but within that<br />
constructive relationship to be of assistance to the people<br />
of East Timor.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Caucus uranium motion implies rather<br />
than explicitly supports new contracts for existing mines. In<br />
the motion which your supporters, which your supporters will<br />
put to Conference, will the support for new contracts be </p>
<p>-6<br />
more explict?<br />
HAWKE: There should be no doubt that what is intended by the<br />
Caucus resolution, which I was instrumental in achieving, means.<br />
That the existing mines in the Northern Territory are able to<br />
have new con-tracts, in other words, they are able to go to<br />
completion. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, pressure of work kept you away<br />
from the state conferences of your Party, will pressure of<br />
work keep you away from the Olympic Games in Los Angeles?<br />
HAWKE: I have not at any stage had any intention of going<br />
to the Olympic Games?<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what was it that you were doing<br />
that was more important that addressing the various state<br />
branches of the Labor Party which were electing delegates<br />
which will, who ultimately form Labor Party policy?<br />
HAWKE: Well, you know one of the reasons why we were<br />
enjoying and will continue to enjoy the very substantial<br />
support of the Australian electorate is that we have a<br />
capacity to get our priorities right. And last year we<br />
had to prepare our first budget and it was a remarkably<br />
successful budget. I have been engaged in the last few<br />
weeks just before coming here, and when I leave this<br />
delightful gathering will go straight back to the less<br />
exotic atmosphere of the Expenditure Review Committee,<br />
where we will continue the shaping of the budget for<br />
84-85. And may I say you're talking about relatively<br />
important things. I think it is rather unfortunate that<br />
given all the excitement and drama of the conferences thait<br />
there has been a tendency to overlook the fact that in the<br />
same period this country has seen the conjunction of the most<br />
favourable range of economic statistics that this country<br />
has seen, I would think, in the last decade. All the evidence<br />
is coming out day.. after day of the overwhelming success of the<br />
Government in its economic planning. You can look not merely at<br />
the national accounts figures, but the figures in regard to<br />
investment that are coming out, the figures in regard to<br />
retail sales generally, cars in particular. There has not:<br />
been, I think for a decade, a more consistently favourable<br />
conjunction of economic statistics. Those things aren't<br />
happening by accident, it's because this government has<br />
got its priorities right and I will continue to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: You're expressing confidence in winning in<br />
all these major issues. What sort of margin do you think<br />
you are going to win by, is it going to be close?<br />
HAWKE: I would think it's obviously correct to say that<br />
on some of the issues it will be quite close. But I don't:<br />
want to reduce such important issues to the language of the<br />
sporting domain, but it is the case if you ever go to the<br />
races, that the bookmaker pays the same amount if your<br />
favoured steed has won by a short nostril as if it wins by<br />
the length of the straight. </p>
<p>7.-<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can we interpret from your answer<br />
to my last question that the popularity of your<br />
government is dependent on you not taking a major role in<br />
formulating party policy.<br />
HAWKE: Well, you are the-ones for interpretation and I am<br />
at times amazed by the capacity for misinterpretation that is<br />
evident, if you engaged in that particular piece of interpretation<br />
well that'll be for you.<br />
JOURNALIST: I was after your interpretation.<br />
HAWKE: No you said can we interpret. You said can we<br />
interpret. If you want to put the question to me, what wo'uld<br />
my interpretation be you do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your interpretation?<br />
C HAWKE: Of what?<br />
JOURNALSIT: What is your interpretation of the answer to<br />
my last question?<br />
HAWKE: What's the interpretation of my answer to your last<br />
question, you'll have to do better than that?<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there Any practicable way that an Australian<br />
Government could apply a ban to the export of uranium to<br />
France? HAWKE: It could be done. It would involve a breaking of<br />
contractual commitment and I think it is clear, and people<br />
will have to take this into account. There is no doubt that<br />
if that were done, it would involve no damage to France. It<br />
all, by definition, would involve damage to Australia.<br />
CQUESTION: Are you suppo rting the continuation of that ban..<br />
PM: That's an issue that I would rather keep for discussion atthe<br />
Conference, and I say that because/ as you know in the period<br />
leading up to the Conference there's . a lot of discussions going on<br />
between different groups. I don't thi'nk it would help to take that<br />
any further.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, do we take it on your uranium stand<br />
that there can be therefore no accommodation with the Northern<br />
Land Councils demands that contracts be allowed for those two<br />
new mines?<br />
PM: Well, under the Caucus decision that is not open. One of the<br />
interesting things is going to be in the uranium debate -is t~ o see<br />
whether those who in the past have passionately used as an argument<br />
against uranium mining the position and attitude of the aborigines,<br />
whether they will use the same argument on this occasion.<br />
YOU<br />
QUESTION: Do/ accept that opinion, is divided on the issue of uranium. then<br />
Mr Hawke? The Chairman of the National Aboriginal Conference in<br />
the Northern Territory came out yesterday very strongly against<br />
uranium mining, including -the potential dangers to the At-original<br />
people? </p>
<p>-8<br />
PM: Well, it's been made quite clear to us that the majority position<br />
of those speaking on behalf of Aborigines is in favour of it.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, do you think it was proper-for you to call<br />
Justice Ludeke at the time he was considering academic salaries?<br />
PM: Call him. Yes, we wanted to find out whether in fact there<br />
was a possibilityof an a~ ument being put, or the matter being re-opened<br />
in regard to phasing. of course, what ' s improper about that?<br />
QUESTION: What is the Australian Government's attitude to the<br />
situation on the Irian Jaya border. Do you see a role for the<br />
United Nations to handle the refugee<br />
PM: That's a good question. I am glad it: has been raised.<br />
I can't I think you will appreciate-develop* a detailed<br />
answer to it, but I am glad it has been raised, because the previous<br />
questions in regard to our relations with Indonesia have been out<br />
in regard to East Timor. And I believe that the issues in the<br />
area to which you refer are in some sense more important. We have<br />
adopted a position of saying here, you have an issue between two<br />
sovereigi: indepE-ident countries. We have not sought to impose our<br />
position upon them. And we've done that on the basis that the<br />
evidence to this stage has been one of goodwill between the -two<br />
countries, and in particular if I may say so from personal knowledge,<br />
on the part of Prime Minister Somare a very positive attitude -towards<br />
President Suharto, and Indonesia. , And so we hope -that the processes<br />
between the two countries directly involved will involve a resolution<br />
of this problem, and I still express the view that I think that's<br />
what will happen. We have expressed to both countries our obvious<br />
interest in the issue and our concern that: it does not lead to<br />
difficulties and greater problems between the two. The two countries<br />
, are aware of our interest and our attitude* And as for the question<br />
of the role of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to<br />
which you refer, it may be that there is a possibility of a greater<br />
role there. But, I go back to my basic point that this is<br />
something which really needs to be determined, hopefully, between<br />
C the two countries involved. There is a tendency still for some<br />
Australians to think of Papua New Guinea as something less than a<br />
totally sovereign independent country. B3ecause of the relationship<br />
we have we make a mistake it we'allow, even implicitly, that<br />
Papua New Guinea is a completely sovereign independent nation, as is<br />
Indonesia, and therefore the resolution of the problem between.-them<br />
and their border must be basically between them. I simply say on<br />
behalf of the Australian Government that we stand read, if between them<br />
they feel there is some role that we. can nlay, stand ready to helo. But we<br />
do. not believe that we should, as I say even implicitly, think -that<br />
they anything less than a total right to solve the matter between<br />
themselves.<br />
QUESTION: Yet, Prime Minister there are sections of your Party<br />
who don't seem to be cognizant of those sensitivities and wou: ld<br />
seek to impose a view through a resolution at the National ConfEerence.<br />
PM: Well, anyone who believes that resolutions at National Conference<br />
are going to resolve issues are wrong. They are not.-But certai1ly<br />
they are not going to resr'lvp issues between two other sovereign<br />
independent nations. Perhaps if Igo back to the answers that I gave<br />
earlier, that if we are to be concerned about the interest of t: he<br />
people concerned that is ' in East Timor-the people of that<br />
region and Irian Jaya, the people there in the border area, </p>
<p>.9<br />
PM: cont<br />
then we ought so to conduct ourselves in the way which maximises<br />
the capacity for the Australian Government to be of practical and<br />
constuctive assistance if we are sincere about wanting to help<br />
the people concerned.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, does the Australian Government have<br />
a view about the large scale trans-migration program that is<br />
about to take off in Irian Jaya, and given the sensitivity of the<br />
whole situation there and the effect that such a w1hl~ sale program<br />
would have on a relatively small melanesian pr! eople of Irian Jaya<br />
what is that Australian view, and have you expressed any view<br />
to Jakarta?<br />
PM: At a recent conference of the group of nations concerned with<br />
Government assistance to Indonesia, the Australian delegation did<br />
raise the question of what was the view of the Indonesian Government<br />
about the importance of the trans-migration program. That was<br />
raised, the question was raised, but Peter not in a way which could<br />
carry tie implication that we can tell a sovereign independent nation<br />
what it does about its internal, economic, demographic, social policies.<br />
And if the Government of Indonesia was to start telling me what I<br />
should do about our internal policies you could be assured that I<br />
would on behalf of this country be making it quite clear that the<br />
internal decisions internal economic, and social demographic<br />
decisions-about Australia were the business of Australia. And I<br />
would be very definite on behalf of this country in saying whether<br />
it was to Indonesia, or to any other country, the decisions within<br />
Australia are decisions to be made by the Government of Australia.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, isn't that the same attitude that Mr Gromyko expressed<br />
to Mr Hayden?<br />
PM: Yes, it is I guess, and I would simply say that in regard to<br />
the question of individual human rights that there is a question<br />
which transcends international boundaries in terms of the rights<br />
of nations'to express views about those is; sues of individual human<br />
rights. And Bill Hayden was acting, not only with my complete support<br />
but, in accordance with I think international standards in doing that.<br />
I don't know that you can draw exactly the same parallel between<br />
a question of how there is an abuse of individual human rights, and<br />
a decision about a relocation program of people . frcin one part of a<br />
country to another. As far as Indonesia is cDncerned is it being<br />
put that there is not some basic general agreement that it makes<br />
sense within Indonesia to look at a position where you've got this<br />
great majority of some now 140 million people living on two islands.<br />
You've got other areas which offer greater opportunities for<br />
development in economic terms and individual terms. There is<br />
obviously a sound argument for that sort of position. I don't think<br />
you can equate that'Laurie', with the treatment of Sakharov which by<br />
any standards is repugnant. </p>
<p>10<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, you've been critical in the past of human rights<br />
violations'in the Soviet Union_ o you have a responsibility to<br />
apply the same philosophy to human rights violations in Irian Jaya,<br />
and I think particularly inc~ the case of Arnold Ap..<br />
PM: If the evidence were available that you had an anal ' ag~ ods<br />
situation in regard to Ap as you do in regard to Sakharov, and<br />
I don't accept on the basis -of what's beenput before me, that* there is<br />
an analogy yes, we would. You can't draw a distinction on the<br />
question of the fundamental violation of human rights that's happening<br />
in regard to Sakharov and say, well yes, we'll criticise that in<br />
the Soviet Union but not somewhere else. All I can iay* isi that. on the<br />
evidence that is available to me, and I think to the Foreign Minister,<br />
you are not in a position to draw that analogy.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, going back to uranium. Is it realistic for<br />
people in the Northern Territory to believe on purely economic<br />
optimum and economic rights that the at luka and Coongarra mines<br />
could be given the go-ahead and giv en /~ Iqeta eeomnshv<br />
been suggested before.<br />
PM: Well, as it's not going to be a proposition that will be put<br />
at the conference or that I think wil. l be carried, well then as<br />
far as the policy of the Party would be then it would not be<br />
realistic to expect that.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, a representtiv~ e of the Free West PapUa Movement,<br />
Mr Uenk Joku when he was in Canberra earlier this week, mentioned that<br />
he had hoped Australia would consider taking refugees in the future<br />
direct from Irian Jaya? What was your reaction to that?<br />
PM: Look, you are getting to the question of a purely hypothetical<br />
question and I don't believe generally speaking that they are helpful.<br />
What I must say, in answer to that is that I hope that* the situation in<br />
Irian Jaya will be capable of being resolved in a way that is not<br />
going to involve that sort of situation, and I repeat that my<br />
Government stands ready, to try and be of assistance in ensuring that<br />
appens. And I don't believe that interests of Australia, or-Indonesia<br />
or Papua New Guinea is served by me going into that hypothetical<br />
situation. </p>
