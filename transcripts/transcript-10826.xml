    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that today's Special Premiers'</p>
<p> Conference has endorsed a set of principles that will transform Commonwealth-State</p>
<p> financial relations as promised in the Howard Government's Tax</p>
<p> Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system.</p>
<p>These principles will provide the States and Territories with a stable</p>
<p> and growing source of revenue to fund important community services,</p>
<p> such as roads, hospitals and schools. It will allow the States to</p>
<p> reduce their reliance on a range of narrow and growth reducing taxes.</p>
<p>I congratulate State and Territory leaders on their co-operative and</p>
<p> constructive approach to today's meeting.</p>
<p>A copy of the Agreement on Principles is attached. This will guide</p>
<p> further work on the implementation details, leading up to our consideration</p>
<p> of a draft Intergovernmental Agreement at the 1999 Premiers'</p>
<p> Conference.</p>
