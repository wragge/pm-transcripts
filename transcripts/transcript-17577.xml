As kids prepare to head back to school, the Gillard Labor Government is encouraging an estimated 1.3 million Australian families to take advantage of the Education Tax Refund to help parents with the pressure of back-to-school costs.</p>
<p>Eligible families can claim refunds on a range of back to school items including computer equipment and textbooks.</p>
<p>The beginning of the school year can be tough for parents facing education costs, but the Education Tax Refund means eligible parents know they will receive a refund for half of claimable expenses come tax time.</p>
<p>Families can claim 50 per cent of eligible education expenses, up to a maximum refund of $794 for high school children and $397 for primary school children on back-to-school items.</p>
<p>Parents should make sure they keep their receipts in order to make the claims.</p>
<p>The Education Tax Refund is a $4.4 billion Government initiative that is helping families with the cost of living whilst giving their children the best education opportunities.</p>
<p>This initiative, along with the Child Care Rebate and Paid Parental Leave scheme, reinforces the Gillard Labor Government's commitment to helping families struggling with tight family budgets.</p>
<p>Parents who receive Family Tax Benefit Part A for children in primary or secondary school are eligible for the Education Tax Refund, as well as independent students, and parents who receive some other allowances.</p>
<p>From 1 July this year, the Government will also extend the Education Tax Refund to include school uniforms. This means parents will be able to claim for school uniforms bought in the new financial year.</p>
<p>An education campaign starting this weekend will ensure eligible families know what and how much can be claimed and remind parents to hang on to their receipts.</p>
<p>The information campaign will reach eligible families through TV, print, radio and online.</p>
