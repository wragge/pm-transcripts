PRIME MINISTER TUESDAY 26 JUNE 1979 37<br />
From the Press Office<br />
SUMMARY OF ABC'S<br />
A special conference has been called by Mr. Justice Staples<br />
in the Arbitration court in Melbourne tomorrow to try and<br />
sort out the Telecom dispute. The Australian Telecommunications<br />
Employees Union has lodged a claim for a 20 percent across<br />
the board payrise for its members employed by Telecom. To<br />
support the claim the union has imposed a series of work bans<br />
which are already seriously affecting telephone and telex<br />
services out of Sydney. The problems are likely to shift to<br />
other States in the next few days. Interview with General<br />
Manager of Industrial Relations for Telecom and General<br />
Secretary of ATEA, Mr. Mansfield.<br />
It was reported today that Mr. Fraser has moved to end a<br />
s ic survey which was being carried out by an American<br />
cc.= any along the Great Barrier Reef. The survey had been<br />
apzrjved by both the Federal and Queensland Governments.<br />
Reorted from Brisbane that Mr. Fraser's intervention was<br />
ur-inece ssary.<br />
Report from Brisbane: Last week's story on " PM" obviously<br />
caused the Prime Minister some embarrassment because it<br />
w-as on June 4 that he had announced that " there should be<br />
no further exploration for petroleum in the Great Barrier<br />
Reef region". On Thursday, two days after we reported on<br />
the survey work, Mr. Fraser wrote to his Minister for<br />
National Development, Mr. McLeay and drew his attention<br />
to the statement of June 4. He pointed out, in the letter<br />
that the seismic surveys were contrary to the spirit of<br />
the Government's policy. The letter asked Mr. McLeay to<br />
ensure that no survey work take place in the Barrier Reef<br />
region. Last night, Mr. Fraser's office let it be known<br />
that the letter had been sent. The story was duly reported<br />
this morning with headlines such as " Fraser moves quickly<br />
over Reef petroleum exploration" in the Financial Review,<br />
and " PM stops Reef survey" in the Brisbane Courier-Mail.<br />
Mr. Fraser's decisive action, however, was just a little<br />
bit too late, as the Queensland Premier, Mr. Bjelke Petersen<br />
gleefully revealed after seeing Mr. Fraser's headlines. In<br />
fact, the survey was completed last week and the ship is<br />
already heading back for its own base in Perth.<br />
Bjelke Petersen said that he was at a loss to understand<br />
reports of Mr. Fraser's putting an end to the work, and<br />
a-sid he would bring the facts to Mr. Fraser's attention when<br />
he saw him in Canberra later this week at the Premier's<br />
Conference. Bjelke Petersen: First of all, Canberra gave approval<br />
wi-en this matter was raised by Mr. Camm, not through Cabinet<br />
but through himself and his Department. They gave an<br />
agreement, a green light to go ahead with it, and I have a<br />
letter to that effect. Of course, I don't know what prompted<br />
the Prime Minister to come in and say he would stop it because<br />
it has stopped. It's finished long ago. The ship's gone.<br />
Question: When did it stop?<br />
Mr. Bjelke Petersen: I don't know. But the ship's gone<br />
long ago. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Question: Mr. Premier, what are they doing, what is the<br />
survey for?<br />
Mr. Bjelke Petersen: Well, the survey is just by a large<br />
world organisation that does this sort of work in connection<br />
with shipping lanes, or fishing, or anything at all.<br />
But nobody can get a permit unless the Government, State and<br />
Commonwealth grant it, so that gets rid of the argument<br />
that it's going to be definitely used and oil drilling is<br />
going to start. That's not correct.<br />
Question: These surveys aren't cheap though. Obviously<br />
th-ey are going to charge a lot of money and they must be<br />
looking for money from mineral companies?<br />
Bjelke Petersen: They might be. They can be looking<br />
ozr money from people who are interested in all these other<br />
areas and it gives Governments a very clear, or interesting<br />
: cture of the seabed as such from a shipping lane point of<br />
Vlew. Question: What I am saying is, it wouldn't be economical<br />
just to do it for the shipping lanes would it?<br />
Mr. Bjelke Petersen: No, well anyway they no doubt know<br />
their business and they are prepared to spend money to do<br />
these things and obviously that's their concern. I'm not<br />
interested in whether they make money out of it or not.<br />
Question: Did-n't you ask when you granted the permit?<br />
, Mr. Bjelke Petersen: I didn't grant the permit. The<br />
Commonwealth and thTe Mines Minister, the two Ministers were<br />
the ones that organised it and they both agreed.<br />
Question: Don't they have to provide the information why<br />
they are doing the survey. When they ask<br />
Mr. Bjelke Petersen: No, they don't have to provide the<br />
information at all. There is nothing to it.<br />
Question:_ Do you know for a fact the survey hasn't been<br />
commissioned by oil companies?<br />
Emr. Bjelke Petersen: It hasn't been commissioned by oil<br />
o-panies, no. I am not aware of that at all. I am sure<br />
:-at is o correct, because they haven't got a permit to-<br />
N -ze haven't got an authority.. to-go in drilling there.<br />
The Government hasn't given them that authority.<br />
Rep~ ort Just a footnote to the story, I rang Geophysical<br />
Services International in Perth a short while ago. A spokesman<br />
confirmed that the survey was completed last week and the ship was<br />
on its way back to Perth. / 3 </p>

The State Premiers are bracing themselves for some savage<br />
cuts in funding from the Commonwealth at the Premier's<br />
Conference which begins on Thursday. Economist Allan Woods<br />
of Syntec interviewed.<br />
Federal Cabinet has meeting today to discuss, among other<br />
things, how Australia can conserve fuel. It is believed that<br />
one of the proposals is to reduce the speed limit to 90 kph<br />
across the country. Executive Director of Australian Institute<br />
of Petroleum says this would reduce the country's petrol<br />
consumption by from 10% to 15%: interviewed.<br />
Troops of Zimbabwe Rhodesia have carried out a helicopter<br />
attack on an outer suburb of Zambian capital, Lusaka, where<br />
it is believed officials of the patriotic front, ZAPU, live.<br />
Lusaka is to be the venue for the forthcoming Commonwealth<br />
in August to be attended among others by Mr. Fraser and<br />
rs. Thatcher. Reuters AAP says the raid was carried out<br />
about an hour and a half ago.<br />
The ALP called today for a national media policy to replace<br />
what it has described as the present piecemeal ad hoc<br />
developments by the Federal Government. Senator Susan Ryan<br />
said the ABC should be re-structured and measures taken in<br />
the commercial sector to stop ownership being concentrated in<br />
too few hands. Senator Ryan interviewed.<br />
There has been an announcement from the finance company,<br />
Beneficial in response to the publicity about the company.<br />
The company delivered a letter to the Adelaide Stock Exchange.<br />
The Directors said they believed it was their responsibility<br />
to comment on the recent publicity concerning the possible<br />
effects on the company of the publicly known difficulties<br />
affecting ASL and the Bank of Adelaide Finance Corporation of<br />
Australia group. The Directors said the company continues to<br />
cperate soundly, has available unused borrowing limits within<br />
its trustees and has substantial unused lines of credit.<br />
They said " in view of the unprecedented circumstances currently<br />
f. cing the finance industry, the Company's major shareholders<br />
have been involved in preparing a package of measures which<br />
will further strengthen the capital base and provide additional<br />
borrowing facilities in order to demonstrate publicly their<br />
on-going substantial support for the long-term success of the<br />
m. r&amp; any"<br />
Dr. Shelley Phillips has published a book, released today,<br />
e---led " Young Australians" based on a survey of 2000 children<br />
