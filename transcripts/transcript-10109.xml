19 September 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
LAUNCH OF AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INTERNET SITE<br />
TOKYO JAPAN<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much for those words of introduction. Those of you who have<br />
attended my earlier speech will know that this is the first occasion that I've visited<br />
Japan as Prime Minister and I'm pai-Ecularly happy to be asked to inaugurate The web<br />
site which will make yet another contribution, an importani one, to enhancing the<br />
business and econoinic links between Australian and Japan.<br />
I thought Australia had a well earned reputation for voraciously devouring new<br />
technology but I do not think wve can possibly m'atch a rate of growth of 10 per cent a<br />
month which was mentioned as the rate at which internet use is now occurring in<br />
Japan, We clearly have; in common a rapid assimilation with the new technology and I think<br />
the contribution that this site and the contribution that the internet generally will make<br />
will be particularly apparent in the area of small and medium sized businesses. One of<br />
the remarkable features of the communications revolution of recent times is the way in<br />
which the tools of that revolution the personal computer, the facsimile machine an~ d<br />
the mobile telephone have in a sense empowered small business and dismantled many<br />
of the market barriers and the costs involved in world-wide information seeking and<br />
the way in which this site in its own small but very important way will improve the<br />
access to small and medium sized businesses to market opportunities, is in many<br />
respects its most attractive feature.<br />
understand that through the opening of this site Australia is taking a lead that no<br />
other foreign agency has a site of this capacity, sophistication oi-breadth and in the<br />
long term the site is a further means of developing Australia's commercial and national<br />
image aniongst the Japanese people. FaIx r o~ 19/ 091/ 79: 646 Pg: 1 </p>

Fax from One of the features of a facility suoh as this is that it equalises the opportunity for<br />
people wanting access in whether they comne from regional areas or large cities and the<br />
Australians amongst us will understand that that will have a particular resonance in<br />
relation to recent political debate. For example Japanese retailers looking for sources<br />
for importing food will be guided directly to options of buying Atlantic salmon from<br />
Tasmania and live abalone from Ulladulla and so on.<br />
This internet, this site can help deliver good business results but at the end of the day<br />
because it is all about working hard nd keeping one's competitiveness up to the mark,<br />
a constant theme of the economic relationship between Australia and Japan.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate those responsible for this site and I have very<br />
great pleasure in declaring it officially open. Thank you. </p>
