    <content><![CDATA[<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to a break?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. I will be having a couple of weeks off like so many others</p>
<p>   and spending it with my family and I certainly hope that Australians</p>
<p>   have a very restful and happy Christmas. I hope those of us who</p>
<p>   are able to spend it in happy circumstances and comfortable circumstances</p>
<p>   will remember that there are many Australians who don't have</p>
<p>   that kind of Christmas. </p>
<p>Perhaps all of us can help those magnificent organisations, like</p>
<p>   the Salvation Army and the Smith Family, who do so much to help</p>
<p>   the less fortunate in our community at Christmas time. It is a time</p>
<p>   of celebration and thanksgiving but it should also be a time of</p>
<p>   remembering those in our community who are not as well off as the</p>
<p>   rest of us.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>At the end of the year do you write your own report card?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do I write it, yes I do, in a very private sense. It has been a</p>
<p>   tough year and I have had some ups and downs, but the important</p>
<p>   thing is that the fabric of the Australian nation finishes the year</p>
<p>   in very good shape. Economically, we are probably the fastest growing</p>
<p>   economy in the industrialised world - Can I say that again - Australia</p>
<p>   is probably the fastest growing economy in the industrialised world.</p>
<p>In a short period of time we have turned a $10.5 billion deficit</p>
<p>   into a prospective surplus of probably a couple of billion dollars</p>
<p>   in next financial year. We have lowered interest rates to levels</p>
<p>   they were at in the late 1960s. We have got one of the world's</p>
<p>   lowest inflation rates. We have seen a turn around in the last few</p>
<p>   months in employment growth - 145,000 jobs created in the last three</p>
<p>   months. We have seen record levels of business investment. We have</p>
<p>   seen the Australian economy weather the financial turbulence which</p>
<p>   has swept through the Asia-Pacific region so much so that we are</p>
<p>   able to help the weaker economies of that region from the position</p>
<p>   of pride and strength. And you add all of that together, I am entitled</p>
<p>   to say that, the Australian economy and therefore the economic fabric</p>
<p>   of the nation finishes the year in very good shape. That is not</p>
<p>   said complacently but it is said proudly against the background</p>
<p>   of the year in which the Government has had many critics, but in</p>
<p>   which it has attended to the things that are really important to</p>
<p>   this nation's future, and that is, building a sound economic</p>
<p>   framework on which we can be base further economic expansion.</p>
<p>It has also been a year in which we have seen a record level of</p>
<p>   average Australians buy a share - that is in Telstra - of one of</p>
<p>   the largest corporate floats this country has ever seen. 600,000</p>
<p>   Australians for the first time in their lives bought shares this</p>
<p>   year and 92 per cent of the employees of Telstra bought shares in</p>
<p>   that company under the special offer that the Government made available.</p>
<p>   And they are the battlers and the workers the people - that you</p>
<p>   say - many of whom come from struggle street. They were able to</p>
<p>   participate, 92 per cent of them, that is a thumping endorsement</p>
<p>   from the employees of that company in the wisdom of the Government's</p>
<p>   policy.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do you think there is a weakness within the Government in its capacity</p>
<p>   to sell that story?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I guess you could always say that. A Government never sells its</p>
<p>   story well enough and if you are saying to me we have got to sell</p>
<p>   even harder, yes, of course, that is the answer. </p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>What about the negatives? Has the rorts affair, the travel rorts</p>
<p>   affair - not that you were pioneers of that, as you know, it has</p>
<p>   been going on for years but you seem to pay the price of it - has</p>
<p>   that been damaging?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That was damaging, of course, it is always damaging when you lose</p>
<p>   ministers of great quality like John Sharp, of course it is.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And is there a way back though for John Sharp?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there is always a way back for people of ability and fundamental</p>
<p>   decency, of course there is.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>In the short term or long term?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't talk about that, we haven't had the Auditor</p>
<p>   Generals' Report yet. The important thing about that is that</p>
<p>   I enforce very high standards at a considerable personal cost. But</p>
<p>   I told the Australian people that we wouldn't have the temporising</p>
<p>   on these issues of the Hawke and Keating Governments. We did enforce</p>
<p>   tougher standards. I paid a price in the short term but in the long</p>
<p>   term I think the Australian people will respect that. </p>
<p>We didn't handle the nursing home situation well but that</p>
<p>   problem is now behind us. The family home is rock-solid safe and</p>
<p>   guaranteed and I think the other thing that people can look forward</p>
<p>   to in the New Year is that we will be offering the Australian public</p>
<p>   a dramatically improved taxation system where rates of personal</p>
<p>   income tax will be lower and the competitive position of Australian</p>
<p>   business under its taxation system will be vastly improved and that</p>
<p>   means jobs and more exports.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I am just suprised that, on the tax front, that you haven't</p>
<p>   seemingly embraced a wider debate. There is a lot of scholarship</p>
<p>   happening internationally about alternatives to the GST. It seems</p>
<p>   that we are equating the GST with tax reform.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am not doing that. I am not talking about a GST. There is</p>
<p>   no way that we are going to have a GST, alone, that's crazy.</p>
<p>   This is a total tax reform. You have got to fix up the business</p>
<p>   side, you have got to fix up the personal income tax side, you have</p>
<p>   got to rationalise the indirect tax system. Anybody who seeks to</p>
<p>   describe what we are doing, as just about the introduction of a</p>
<p>   broad-based indirect tax, is wrong.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I know you know how bad it is, but I had a letter from Joe, who</p>
<p>   works at Safeway and he was pretty excited because he got a promotion</p>
<p>   - he is only on $23,500 - but he got an extra $3,000. His wife is</p>
<p>   a full-time carer and she is at home looking after the two kids,</p>
<p>   but because of $3,000 he went in at 35.5 per cent in tax, he lost</p>
<p>   $1,065 and he lost 50 cents for every dollar. He finished up with</p>
<p>   $435 out of the $3,000. Now that is no encouragement for work is</p>
<p>   it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The only way you will fix that and help Joe and give him the incentive</p>
<p>   to get another $3,000 raise is to reform the personal income tax</p>
<p>   system. At the moment what happens is you get onto an ordinary wage</p>
<p>   and you are paying the top marginal rate of tax. When I left school</p>
<p>   you had to be earning 19 times average weekly earnings - not that</p>
<p>   I was on that when I left school - to pay the top marginal rate</p>
<p>   of tax. You now have to only earn 1.4. Now that is disgraceful and</p>
<p>   that will stifle incentive, not only of the Joes' but of every</p>
<p>   other person who is trying hard to get ahead and look after their</p>
<p>   families. What we want is a tax system that gives those people the</p>
<p>   incentive to work harder, to know that if they get a rise then they</p>
<p>   will keep the great bulk of it themselves. You can only do that</p>
<p>   if you reform the whole system.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well no one has read the Act. The Act is a shambles for a start.</p>
<p>   We better pay our way. So we will take a break and come back talking</p>
<p>   to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[TAPE BREAK]</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister it seems that in spite of all those things you say,</p>
<p>   the country has been very disillusioned about this whole Wik, Mabo,</p>
<p>   nasty language, and I see that Noel Pearson has said that if</p>
<p>   you don't change your tune, there will be war between indigenous</p>
<p>   and non-indigenous Australians. What does the leader of the nation</p>
<p>   say to the rest of the nation about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that kind of language is inflammatory, it's unhelpful</p>
<p>   to the cause that he's meant to espouse, and that is the cause</p>
<p>   of reconciliation. There won't be war between indigenous and</p>
<p>   other Australians.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>And will you be backing down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I won't be backing down because our legislation is already</p>
<p>   a fair compromise. I mean if I'd been like a trade union leader,</p>
<p>   I'd have produced a piece of legislation as a ridiculous ambit</p>
<p>   claim and then bit-by-bit made concessions and then reached a mid</p>
<p>   point. But I didn't do that. I spent four or five months travelling</p>
<p>   around Australia talking to people, including probably four or five</p>
<p>   meetings with Aboriginal leaders, including Mr Pearson, and including</p>
<p>   an initial meeting of just Mr Pearson and myself. Now I started</p>
<p>   off in good faith wanting to reach a result, a middle point that</p>
<p>   was fair to both sides, and I've done that. I mean what I've</p>
<p>   produced was not universally satisfactory to the farming community</p>
<p>   of Australia. You remember when I went to Longreach the people holding</p>
<p>   placards at Longreach weren't leaders of the Aboriginal community,</p>
<p>   they were people who thought I was being too accommodating to the</p>
<p>   Aboriginals.</p>
<p>Now I've produced a fair, decent, balanced outcome. It preserves</p>
<p>   the right of indigenous people to make native title claims over</p>
<p>   pastoral leases. It guarantees the principles of the Mabo decision.</p>
<p>   It guarantees...</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>Let's come back to that point about the native title over</p>
<p>   pastoral leases. Are you conceding that there will be circumstances</p>
<p>   in which they can co-exist?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm conceding that the principles of the Wik decision and</p>
<p>   the Mabo decision will be maintained in my legislation, yes. I am.</p>
<p>   I mean this is the extraordinary thing that I'm the bloke that's</p>
<p>   actually produced legislation that upholds the principles of Mabo</p>
<p>   and Wik and for my pains I'm being called racist. Now that</p>
<p>   is wrong and the more people do it, can I say, the more determined</p>
<p>   one becomes to maintain the fairness and the integrity of my position.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>Racist scum, not just racist. Is there a place in this kind of</p>
<p>   so-called pursuit of reconciliation for that sort of language?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that sort of language is completely negative to the cause</p>
<p>   of reconciliation. But you have to understand that Noel has a long</p>
<p>   history of espousing the Labor side of the argument. I mean it's</p>
<p>   not a surprise. What I find a bit interesting is that the Labor</p>
<p>   Party has apparently not embraced him with the alacrity with which</p>
<p>   they embraced Mrs Kernot.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>You'll be putting this legislation back to the Senate without</p>
<p>   change?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>Right. What do you say to pastoralists, I've just had one</p>
<p>   on here this morning and Noel Pearson has made public statements</p>
<p>   to say that they will not in any way seek to claim pastoral leases</p>
<p>   in the area covered by the Land Council of which he's Chairman,</p>
<p>   yet they are doing just that. Massive ambit claims for exclusivity</p>
<p>   in possession and use. Now these people are out there trying to</p>
<p>   make a quid, they face a Christmas of massive uncertainty, they</p>
<p>   don't really know where they stand. What do you say to them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I'm saying to them is that if we hadn't had to deal</p>
<p>   with the Labor Party and the Independents in the Senate we'd</p>
<p>   have fixed this thing up months ago. The people who are delaying</p>
<p>   the resolution of this issue are the Labor Party, the Democrats,</p>
<p>   Senator Harradine and people like Mr Pearson who want the debate</p>
<p>   and the rancour to go on. And they keep arguing that they seek reconciliation,</p>
<p>   and we all do. We all want to live in peace and harmony with each</p>
<p>   other, irrespective of the colour of our skin and irrespective of</p>
<p>   where we came from. And everybody has a compassion for the original</p>
<p>   Australians, I certainly do and all of my Party members do.</p>
<p>But we've got to get this thing fixed. It's in everybody's</p>
<p>   interest to bring certainty and predictability and unless our legislation</p>
<p>   goes through we're going to have years of rancour and argument</p>
<p>   and endless litigation and that is why, I just say again to those</p>
<p>   who oppose it, let the legislation go through, let us put this issue</p>
<p>   behind us, and let us focus on the future instead of endlessly debating</p>
<p>   the past.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>You started here this morning by saying that you hope people have</p>
<p>   a wonderful Christmas and there would be people in different circumstances</p>
<p>   to you and others. Could I just put a couple of plugs in here. One,</p>
<p>   in the first instance, for carers who work 365 days a year, 24 hours</p>
<p>   a day. They get no holiday pay, no sick pay, no superannuation,</p>
<p>   no car allowance, no transport, no nothing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>None whatever.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>What kind of benefit can you find out of billions of dollars that</p>
<p>   exist from Telstra sales, there's money to be spent on Aborigines</p>
<p>   and land funds and God knows what, and the carers just seem to be</p>
<p>   left behind.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have made a number or changes, we have provided increased</p>
<p>   support for respite care, and the thing that many carers want is</p>
<p>   to have a few weeks off. They're very happy to do it, they</p>
<p>   do it out of love and concern for the people they're looking</p>
<p>   for, but they do want to rest every so often and we are providing</p>
<p>   more resources for that. And we're also significantly increasing</p>
<p>   the Domiciliary Care Allowance, I know that's a jaw-breaking</p>
<p>   description but it's really the allowance that assists people</p>
<p>   who are looking after loved ones who have a profound incapacity</p>
<p>   or a profound disability. Now those two items were announced I think</p>
<p>   in the last budget.</p>
<p>It's an area that remains under constant review and I do agree</p>
<p>   with you that some of the most heart-rending stories that I've</p>
<p>   had from people who've sat in my office and talked about the</p>
<p>   personal trauma and difficulty of caring for, particularly an intellectually</p>
<p>   retarded family member. You're trying to hold a family together</p>
<p>   in a small residence. One woman spoke of her difficulty, she had</p>
<p>   a 25 year old profoundly handicapped adult son, and another 17 year</p>
<p>   old son who was trying to sit for his HSC, and she said in a very</p>
<p>   small dwelling the strain and attention, and yet she wanted to go</p>
<p>   on, what she wanted above all was some kind of relief, some kind</p>
<p>   of respite from it.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>You also said at the beginning that it's a time for families,</p>
<p>   you've been a strong advocate of the family. And yet we live</p>
<p>   in a world where it seems that young people face increasing alienation,</p>
<p>   drug addiction and suicide and so on. Are there any circumstances</p>
<p>   in which you would introduce a home-maker's allowance, where</p>
<p>   one of the spouses would be given a choice to stay at home for a</p>
<p>   figure of approximately say $350 a week, acknowledging that that</p>
<p>   may well be in contemporary society the most important job the country</p>
<p>   can do.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we've already gone down that path with our family tax</p>
<p>   initiative, it's not as much as that.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>No it's not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But it is a start, and one of the things for which I've been</p>
<p>   criticised by some sections of the media, but for which I defend</p>
<p>   very strongly is that we've tried to give men and women, parents,</p>
<p>   a greater choice as to the kind of childcare that they provide.</p>
<p>   Now that's not to say that John Howard seeks to dictate a lifestyle,</p>
<p>   but what it does say is that John Howard is in favour of giving</p>
<p>   men and women, mothers and fathers, greater choice. And those who</p>
<p>   seek an arrangement whereby one parent cares full time, they ought</p>
<p>   to be given more help.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>We've got to go to the news. One final thing, I spoke to the</p>
<p>   chief executive of a disability home for disabled children and the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth State Disability Agreement is up for grabs, you may</p>
<p>   not have been across this yet. But there's talk about many</p>
<p>   of the services having to be cut back because the money isn't</p>
<p>   available. Surely it's this time of year too when you'd</p>
<p>   look at those, there's not a lot of them, but by gee they have</p>
<p>   a tremendous (inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've had a look at that and I can guarantee that the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth will provide generously for a renewal of the Commonwealth/State</p>
<p>   Disability Agreement. The Ministers met at the end of November,</p>
<p>   they made good progress, and they hope that an agreement will be</p>
<p>   signed in February. It's too important to be damaged by any</p>
<p>   Commonwealth/State wrangling.</p>
<p>ALAN JONES:</p>
<p>We've got to go to the news. Thanks for your time, and have</p>
<p>   a good Christmas and we look forward to seeing you in 1998.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I wish all of your listeners a very happy and peaceful, and</p>
<p>  of your listeners a very happy and peaceful, and</p>
<p>   above all safe Christmas and New Year.</p>
