PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 24 AUGUST 1990<br />
The Government has appointed Professors Stuart Harris and<br />
David Throsby and Dr Roy Green to chair the working groups<br />
on ecologically sustainable development.<br />
The formulation of strategies for ecologically sustainable<br />
development is one of the most pressing and important tasks<br />
facing my Government.<br />
As indicated in June when the Government's discussion paper,<br />
Ecologically Sustainable Development, was released for<br />
public comment, nine sectoral working groups are being<br />
established. The working groups will include<br />
representatives of industry, the conservation and trade<br />
union movements and State/ Territory and Commonwealth<br />
Governments, and the CSIRO. Consumer organisations will<br />
also be represented on relevant groups.<br />
As well as the discussion paper, the working groups will<br />
have before them the comments which the Government has<br />
received on that paper. The Government is very pleased with<br />
the extent of the responses and the seriousness with which<br />
the issues raised have been addressed. Many respondents<br />
have identified a number of additional cross-sectoral issues<br />
that they consider warrant attention. The Chairs of the<br />
working groups are being asked to take all these<br />
cross-sectoral issues into account in the development of<br />
their sectoral proposals.<br />
The Government will make public the additional issues<br />
identified in the comments. The Government will itself be<br />
considering all the issues raised in comments on the<br />
discussion paper.<br />
Each Chairperson will chair three working groups.<br />
Professor Harris will be responsible for the mining,<br />
manufacturing, and energy production and distribution<br />
working groups; Professor Throsby for the transport, energy<br />
use and tourism working groups; and Dr Green for the<br />
agriculture, forestry and fisheries working groups.<br />
The Chairs will consult together and with Ministers<br />
regularly to ensure that questions raised in the<br />
commentaries as well as those signalled in the discussion<br />
paper are fully and consistently integrated into the work of<br />
the sectoral working groups. </p>
<p>The Chairs are also being asked to ensure that interested<br />
groups and individuals who are not represented on the<br />
working groups have the opportunity to bring information and<br />
views to the attention of the working groups. Other member7s<br />
of the groups will assist in this broader consultation.<br />
The experience, training and qualifications of the three<br />
chairpersons makes them eminently qualified for their task.<br />
Stuart Harris is currently Professor, Department of<br />
International Relations in the Research School of Pacific<br />
Studies at the Australian National University. He has an<br />
extensive research background and has held important posts<br />
in academic institutions and the public service. Professor<br />
Harris was previously Director of the Centre for Resource<br />
and Environmental Studies at the Australian National<br />
University, and Secretary of the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade.<br />
David Throsby is Professor of Economics at Macquarie<br />
University. He has wide experience as a resource economist:<br />
and has acted as a consultant to a number of major<br />
international organisations, including the FAO, UNESCO, the:<br />
World Bank, and many State, Federal Government and private<br />
sector agencies.<br />
Roy Green has been Director of the CSIRO Institute of<br />
Natural Resources and Environment since January 1988. Prior<br />
to that he has had wide experience in industry and<br />
government. Previous major appointments have included<br />
Secretary to the Australian Science and Technology Council,<br />
Deputy Secretary of the Department of Science and Executive<br />
Adviser in the Department of Industry, Technology and<br />
Commerce. Copies of the Commonwealth discussion paper, Ecologically<br />
Sustainable Development, can be obtained from Australian<br />
Government Publishing Service ( AGPS) bookshops in each<br />
capital city. Any further comments on the discussion paper<br />
will be forwarded to the Chairs for their consideration.<br />
A related Treasury paper, Economic and Regulatory Measures<br />
for Ecologically Sustainable Development, was published in<br />
the Economic Round-up of June 1990 and can be obtained from<br />
AGPS bookshops. </p>
