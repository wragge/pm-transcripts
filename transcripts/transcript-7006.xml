    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />FOR MEDIA 25 SEPTEMBER 1986<br />I am pleas~ d to announce that the Prime Minister of India,<br />Mr Rajiv Gandhi, has accepted an invitation to visit Australia<br />from 14 to 16 October as a guest of the Government.<br />I welcome O1r Gandhi's visit and, in particular, look forward to<br />discussing with him international political and economic issues<br />of mutual concern, including the very important issue of the<br />situation in southern Africa on which we have worked closely<br />together in the Commonwealth context.<br />Australia and India share many common values and traditional<br />connections, especially as members of the Commonwealth and as<br />littoral states of the Indian ocean, and I look forward to our<br />two countrieG working together more closely in the future in the<br />region. India plays an important role in international affairs,<br />and is a major force in maintaining the stability of the Asian<br />region. As the world's largest democracy, it is influential in<br />promoting the ideals shared by all societies committed to the<br />pursuit of freedom and peace. Mr Gandhi's visit will reinforce<br />the friendly relations between our two countries and also help to<br />give more substance to the bilateral relationship, including in<br />the economic area.<br />in Canberra, Mr Gandhi will hold official discussions with myself<br />and senior Cabinet Ministers, meet the Governor-General, and<br />address the National Press Club.<br />He will also visit Sydney where he will1 be talking to senior<br />Australian business and trade union representatives under the<br />auspices of EPAC, and meet with the New South Wales Government,<br />and the Indian community.</p>
