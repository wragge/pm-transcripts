CHECK AGAINST DR-LIVERY ENM ED UNTIL DELIVER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PMIME MINISTER<br />
DEDICATION OF NATIONAL MEMORIAL TO THE ARMY<br />
CANBERRA 1 NOVEMER 1989<br />
Throughout the cities and the country towns of the nation,<br />
Australians have proudly built memorials to those of our<br />
fellow citizens who have served in thq Australian armed<br />
forces.<br />
The cairns, plaques, memorial halls and avenues of honour<br />
all bear silent but eloquent testimony to those who offered<br />
their lives as hostages for liberty and those who gave<br />
their lives to create a better world.<br />
Today we dedicate a new memorial a memorial to the<br />
Australian Army here in the heart of the nation; here on the<br />
grand sweep that connects the seat of parliamentary<br />
democracy with the Australian War Memorial; here in this<br />
avenue that proudly bears the name Anzac.<br />
Since before the Federation of the nation Australian armed<br />
forces have been defending and protecting the interests of<br />
the Australian people in times of danger<br />
Providing assistance to civil authorities in the event of<br />
natural disasters; supporting peace-keeping missions<br />
overseas in difficult situations, such as today in Namibia;<br />
safeguarding the national estate in time of war.<br />
This memorial serves to honour the memory of all those<br />
involved in those great tasks not just the recognised, the<br />
famous, the generals, the winners of medals but all who<br />
served their country in the Australian Army. That lack of<br />
distinction, that egalitarianism, is of course very fitting<br />
and it is very Australian. It recognises the fact that<br />
courage, dedication and professionalism in the face of<br />
adversity were the characteristics not just of the few but<br />
were part of the baggage that every Australian digger took<br />
with him on service overseas.<br />
It cannot have been an easy task to translate into the<br />
tangible structures of this sculpture all the nation's sense<br />
of respect for, and gratitude to, its armed forces. But I<br />
congratulate the sculptors, and all those involved in this<br />
project. They have given us a memorial that does capture in<br />
permanent. form our national sense of debt to the army.<br />
I, I </p>
<p>It will help remind us that too many theatres of war have<br />
seen the deaths of too many young Australians.<br />
But it will also remind us residents of Canberra and<br />
visitors alike that it was through such sacrifice that we<br />
can now enjoy the freedom, prosperity and independence that<br />
we must not take for granted. 2879 </p>
