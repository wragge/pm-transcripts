PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 September 1985<br />
Federal Cabinet this week discussed the future of phosphate<br />
mining on Chriptmas Island.<br />
Following the meeting the Prime Minister sent the following<br />
message to the Administrator of Christmas Island:<br />
" In 19u4 the Christmas Island phosphate operation was<br />
restructured in an attempt to restore the commercial<br />
viability of the Phosphate Mining company of Christmas<br />
Island Ltd.<br />
unfortunately, the expectations of the restructuring<br />
programme have not been fulfilled.<br />
The Commonwealth will not support an uneconomic<br />
phosphate operation.<br />
Therefore the Commonwealth had decided that the present<br />
uneconomic phosphate operation will cease before the<br />
end of the 1986.<br />
The cessation of mining operations is to be orderly and<br />
to assist with th is, selective redundancies will apply.<br />
Termination payments will be in accordance with award<br />
conditions at mainland parity rates.<br />
The feasibility of alternative commercial enterprises<br />
on Christmas Island will be looked at immediately.<br />
However, any prospects will not have an influence on<br />
the decision to close the present uneconomic phosphateoperation.<br />
The Government has established a working party, including<br />
union, ACTU, Government and otner community representatives<br />
to consider and report as a matter of urgency on the<br />
future of Christmas Island." </p>
