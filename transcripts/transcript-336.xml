LIBERAL PARTY RALLY, CITY HALL$ BRISBANE<br />
21st June. 1961<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon, R. G.-Menzies<br />
Mrs Chairman, Mr. Morris, parliamentary colleagues and ladies and<br />
gentlemen: For some time now, in spite of comments to thie contrary<br />
I have thought we were right in what we have been doing. Two<br />
nights ago in Townsville, Townsville not being served with<br />
television but with broadcasting, I listened to my distinguished<br />
opponent, the Leader of the Opposition making what I thought was a<br />
singularly generous and powerful speech in my favour. And that<br />
encouraged me very much. But tonight looking at this remarkable<br />
meeting, I confess to you that I am utterly certain that we are<br />
right; and that we will form the next Government in Australia.<br />
( Applause) In spite of the fact that I have had a lot of<br />
experience, good, bad and indifferent, frankly I did not believe<br />
that you had not made a mistake in taking the City Hall for the<br />
opening meeting of the Convention, because I have many happy<br />
memories of this hall I've been counted out most scintifically<br />
in this hall ( Laughter) Itve been enfiladed by gentlemen who not<br />
only disapproved of my politics, but of my ancestry ( Laughter)-<br />
and I thought " This is a gamble,; what a risky thing this is to do,<br />
to take the City Hall because evon if it has 1500 people in it, it<br />
will look half empty." Now that's a very grim expr~ ssion " half<br />
empty", because when my friends of the newspaper press are In<br />
favour of the man who has 1500 in a hall that will hold 3,000,<br />
they say " This vast hall was at least half full." ( Laughter)'<br />
But when they are not so much in favour of him they dwall on the<br />
fact that it was " practically half empty". ( Laughter) I think I<br />
understand that that's very good colour. But tonight I must say<br />
that even in my heyday, I can't remember a finer crowd, a greater<br />
arowl of people in this hall than you have tonight.<br />
I've just been up in the north and for those of you<br />
who in spite of the intensely depressed state of the economy,<br />
still have a television set, may have seen a rather dreary looking<br />
old fellow on it tonight at a quarter to seven. I looked at it;<br />
I thought it was terrible. ( Laughter) But ray wife who, being a<br />
wife can detect a husband's faults quickly, thought it wasn't bad.<br />
But at any rate those of you who saw it and listened to it, will<br />
know that not for the first time in my life I have been excited<br />
about a visit to ti-ic developing areas of this most developing<br />
State. It's no mere piece of humbug on my part to say ti-at I<br />
believe, I roally believe, we ought to get over the problems of<br />
the week or the month if we can, occasionally, and have a look at<br />
the future of this country, our country. If we do that, then, in<br />
my opinion, wo will all increasingly look north, not just because<br />
of some theory that we ought to have more people in the north for<br />
some reasons of defence, or something of that kind, but because in<br />
the northern part of Australia we have at least two, and probably<br />
maore of the groatest potential developing industries that this<br />
country will stimulate, and from which this country will benefit<br />
in the next 10 years. Mincrals I must be a little alliterative<br />
on this matter, I was going to say " minerals and cattle"<br />
minerals and rieat. And there is no doubt about it that in spite<br />
of the fact that the tasks are enormous, this country is going to<br />
see a development in its north which I balieve will be exciting to<br />
people all over Australia. ( Applause) </p>
<p>But, Sir, a little time ago I thought perhiaps one ought<br />
to say something to people about the policies that we are<br />
pursuing and the reasons for them, because sometimes they are<br />
shrouded in mystery, i know. So I gave myself the pleasant<br />
exercise of writing down questions which I was going to answer<br />
Myself. Now that, of course, is a cross-examiner's dream, isn't<br />
it? Wdrite the question down; and then write the answer.<br />
Having thought about that, and having realised that it had been<br />
done before I decided " Wdell I'll put down questions quite<br />
bluntly, as I know people are putting them to us".<br />
Tonight I thought I would talk to you about some of<br />
them, because, after all, you are the core of Liberalism in this<br />
State and you must have been troubled by questions; and<br />
sometimes, for all I know, you may have found it difficult to<br />
answer them to your own complete satisfaction. So I thought it<br />
might be a little helpful to all of us. You don't need to be<br />
converted to our cause, but perhaps you do need to be<br />
strengthened in our cause, to be made more effective in our<br />
cause; because our cause is the cause of Australia. So I will<br />
take a few of these questions it depends entirely on the clock<br />
as to how many I deal with. And not only on the clock, but on<br />
your patience. I have heard this question put: " Well what would have<br />
happened if the Government had not taken these unpopular economic<br />
measures? IW-ouldn't the boom have faded away quietly on its own<br />
account, and no harm done?" Now this question is put by people<br />
who know that in 1960 we were having a tremendous boom and it<br />
wasn't without in! terest to me, two night ago, to find that our<br />
opponents agree, because the Leader of the Opposition, Mr.<br />
Calwell, agreed that there was a boom and that something had to<br />
be done about it. The differe7nce between him and me is that his<br />
idea for curing the boom of 1960-61 is to have a referendum on<br />
the Constitution in ' 62, or ' 63, which doesn't seem to me to be<br />
tremendously relevant to the problems that we are dealing with.<br />
But there was a booraT. There was a boom which was<br />
leading to a high degroe of inflation, to a high stimulus in<br />
costs and prices. I hoar a gre) at deal about housing, very<br />
properly so it's a great problem. But in the boom conditions<br />
of 1960 every house was costing more, every block of land that<br />
somebody wanted to buy on which to build a house was costing more.<br />
Thoro was a high degree of speculation going on. Thero was an<br />
under-supply of labour. We easily forget it, but thero was a<br />
groat shortage of labour in 1960, and the re sult was that people<br />
" bid-up" for the labour thay wanted, for the resources theiy<br />
wanted. I don't need to tell you, for example, that the<br />
Australian iron and steel industry is at least as efficient as<br />
any corre sponding industry anywhere in the world. Australian<br />
steel could be exported, profitably, to the United States of<br />
America. This is the proof of the efficiency of our industry, of<br />
its management, of the people who work in it. And yet so great<br />
was the demand on our resources in this tremendous booma of 1960<br />
that instead of being exporters of steel, we became importers of<br />
steel. The Australian steel industry could not satisfy the<br />
demand. So we were importing at that time, and beforo it, many<br />
maillions of pounds worth of steel every year this in a country<br />
that can produce steel as cheaply as we can. Of course all that<br />
had its effect on our balances of money overseas, en our<br />
international solvency, because if your reserves overseas keep<br />
running down, then you are going to get into trouble. Therefore,<br />
perhaps, I don't need to labour the point that there was a great<br />
boom, Now, Sir, booms don't come to an end on their own<br />
account with satisfactory results for ordinary people, I was </p>
<p>born almost in the middle of the 90' s this is a remote period<br />
of antiquity that is beyond the understanding of some of you<br />
here tonight the middle of the 90' s, right on top of the great<br />
boom of the 90' s, which was a land boom, and the great Bank smash<br />
of the 90' s, which followed it. And there were people for the<br />
next 10 years in Australia who lived in straitened circumstances<br />
because a boom had happened and a boom had burst. I accept no<br />
responsibility whatever for the well-being of speculators, none<br />
whatever. If they bring it off, well good-luck to them; and if<br />
they don't I've no feeling for them whatever. ( Applause) People<br />
who gamble on the affairs of the community are not my concern.<br />
But I have an irremoveable obligation so long as I<br />
lead this country, to people who can be the victims of a<br />
speculative boom, and who can suffer from a crash of that boom.<br />
It would have boon a monstrous thing for any Government to say<br />
" Well let the boom run its course. If we do something about it<br />
we'll hurt somebody; that will be very unpopular." If we think<br />
there's a boom in the motor car industry as there unquostionabj<br />
was and we do something to damp it down, then there wi1 be<br />
somebody in that industry who will say, " Look what they have done<br />
to me". I understand that, I understand that.<br />
But my business, and your business, is to look for the<br />
good of the groat majority of the people, to be willing to impose<br />
discomfort or inconvenience, or some sacrifice on people who are<br />
benefiting from the boom if the result is that the boom is<br />
brought down to a normal state of affairs in which people of<br />
modest incomes, people of fixed incomes, can feel that their<br />
money is worth what it appears to be worth.<br />
There is another aspect of this matter I don't want<br />
to labour it unduly, and that is that a boom in Australia gives<br />
rise instantly by some of the black magic of economics to an<br />
enormous demand for imports into Australia. When wages have been<br />
pushed up to premium rates, when there is a shortage of labour,<br />
when all these boom conditions obtain, then people want to buy<br />
more goods than they ever bought before. And there is a limit<br />
to what they can buy out of the production of their own country.<br />
So more and more imports cone in; added to which, if I may say<br />
so to you, there is a certain anount of snobbery about buying.<br />
I was talking to a manufacturer a comparatively small<br />
manufacturer in my own loctorate recently, a . ood man who has<br />
built up a business and he was able to produce two articles to<br />
me, one made by him in his factory, and another one imported<br />
from the United States of Amirica. They were of the same<br />
material and they were identical in design and in quality. But<br />
the American one could be sold in the shops at almost twice the<br />
price of his. You know there's a lot of that, isn't there? A<br />
tremendous lot of it.<br />
Whether that is so or not and I believe it is so<br />
the fact is that in a boon condition the demand for imports<br />
grows at the most phenomenal rate. There must be quite a few<br />
people about you meet then don't you? who think that there is<br />
no trouble about that: if you want an imported article you pay<br />
for it at the shop. The process begins there; it doesn't end<br />
there. Because the follow who sells it to you has to pay for it.<br />
If he has bought it from an importer, the importer has to pay for<br />
it overseas. So he is drawing money fron overseas for these<br />
imported goods; and the money is the product of what we have sold<br />
overseas whether it is wheat or neat or wool or butter or<br />
whatever it may be plus what we have been able to borrow<br />
overseas on capital account. ' We refer to this balance<br />
sometimes as our " balnce of payments" and sonetimes as our<br />
" overseas reserves". But if you run then down too low by an </p>
<p>uncommon spate of buying of imports, as we were doing in<br />
Australia, then you know you can got to the point at which you<br />
can't pay for your imports. That is a stage we have never<br />
reached; that is a stage we are never going to reach while we<br />
are in Government. Ne are not prepared to contemplate an<br />
international bankruptcy on the part of this country. Nobody<br />
need imagine it for one moment. Therefore when you find this<br />
tremendous boom and this tremendous demand for goods something<br />
has to be done about it if worse things are not to happen to the<br />
groat majority of the people.<br />
I said something about housing. Perhaps I ought to<br />
add that these conditions in 1960 were lifting the price of the<br />
building allotment lifting the price of the house that was to<br />
be built, lifting The price of the goods to be put into the<br />
house, whether they were refrigerators or washing machines, or<br />
any of what the economists in their delightful jargon call<br />
" durable consumer , oods". Lots of people didn't know they were<br />
going up in price because they would say, " You know we can get<br />
that refrigorator for 17/ 6 per week" nobody knows how long,<br />
how many weeks but " it's 17/ 6 a week and I think we could<br />
afford that". And so it goes on.<br />
Under this boon of consumer credit, under the enormous<br />
development of hire purchase, in itself a Lost useful<br />
arrangement, people wore incurring debts in a boom which, in a<br />
burst after the boom they would never be able to honour. That<br />
doesn't please me; and I hope it doesn't please you. I wouldn't<br />
want to see a boom that was followed by a burst which led to an<br />
inability on the part of hundreds of thousands of good decent<br />
hard-working people to honour the obligations they had entered<br />
into in relation to house or home or equipment.<br />
Therefore, Sir, we rogarded it, and I am sure that on<br />
reflection the people of Australia will agree with us, as<br />
imperative that we should take steps to get rid of the boom and<br />
bring matters back to a position of some normality. When we did<br />
that we weren't unaviare of the fact that we were about a year off<br />
an election; we weren't unaware of the fact that you don't win<br />
an election unless people vote for you; we weren't unaware of<br />
the fact that policies to get rid of inflation are always<br />
unpopular in the short run because they restrict the activity of<br />
a nuEber of businesses, and of a number of people. But we<br />
thought our decisions were designed to save very many people from<br />
grievous disaster. I would like you to look back over the last almast 12<br />
years now. We have had two or three of these relatively minor<br />
economic crises and each tine our popularity rating has sunk<br />
almost to the floor. I can rcmember at the end of 1953 or the<br />
middle of 1953, beinj told by staunch supporters, candid fiends<br />
" You're sunk. You're gone. The Government is so unpopular it<br />
can't recover". Those are the encouragr. ents that one's friends<br />
heap on one under these circu: stances. But we did recover. And<br />
we won. At the last election in 1958, in spite of it all, and<br />
the prophecies of gloom, io caule back with the largest Dajority<br />
that any Government has had in the history of the Comi:, onwealth.<br />
( Applause) The gruat thing on those matters is never to be<br />
afraid because there is some unpopularity attaching to what is<br />
done, to get rid of fear, to cast it out. The great thing is to<br />
have a belief in the people of Australia, which I have profoundly<br />
deep dowm in me, a belief that this is a natijn of honest, decent<br />
people who respect firmness, who respect what they believe to be<br />
intelligence, and who are honest and are not looking for some<br />
cheap advantage. We must have faith in ourselves because we have<br />
faith in our people. </p>
<p>Now, Sir, I have ta: ken a very long time to answer that<br />
particular question so I had better turn to the next one,<br />
because this is a very popular one. I have had this put to me<br />
by great friends of mine and I understand why they put it.<br />
One of the things we did early last year there were<br />
certain exceptions in relation to Japan and so on was to get<br />
rid, in substance, of import licensing. Import licensing, may I<br />
remind you, was never devised as a protective measure. A lot of<br />
people thought that it was. I myself, at least 10 times a year<br />
made it quite clear in public statements that it wasn't a<br />
protective measure. We are entitled, internationally, to introduce<br />
import licensing in order to protect our balances of<br />
payment, and for no other reason. If an Australian industry<br />
is to be protected it ought to be protected by the tariff; and<br />
the tariff board is there to investigate whatever claims may be<br />
made. This is the traditional, sound method of protecting<br />
Australian industry. But when we took off, in substance, import<br />
licgnsing, which had already half disappeared over a course of<br />
years, we were at once accused of having left Australian industry<br />
naked to its enemies.<br />
Therefore, perhaps I ought to tell you one simple fact.<br />
You've heard people say " But, you know, you removed import<br />
licensing; we have a flood of imports now. This seems to be the<br />
wrong thing". And when one of my interlocutors comes to me and<br />
is in a picturesque mood he'll say to me " How can you justify<br />
importing into Australia frogs legs in aspic?" Well in the way<br />
of justifying that matter I can remind them that only lunatics<br />
eat fr, gs' legs in aspic! ( Laghter) I suppose about Z200.<br />
worth of these ridiculous things have come into Australia.<br />
But putting those silly little things on one side,<br />
here are the facts. Since February of last year, taking the<br />
year 1960, after the lifting of import restrictions, œ 241m. more<br />
of imports came into Australia, f2lm. more as a result of the<br />
lifting. Of the œ 241m. œ 190m. consisted of raw materials for<br />
Australian manufacturing production, plant and equipment for<br />
Australian production, and for Australian transport. Some 82%<br />
of all these added imports were things calculated to improve<br />
production and distribution in Australia. I occasionally think<br />
that if we hadn't lifted the import ban I night have had other<br />
deputations containing some of the same people who would say to<br />
me " You're depriving us of the raw materials we need in our<br />
industry". Now I'll come to the favourite charge, one you've<br />
hoard made many times. I wrote it down in this way: " But the<br />
Cormmonwcalth Govorrmiont changes its policy so frequently that<br />
people are bewildered. They don't know where they are for more<br />
than a few months. What do you say about that?" Now that's a<br />
fair question isn't it? I haven't watered that one down have I?<br />
I've heard about it; I've heard it put to me chopping and<br />
changing, start and gc. Now I want to say something to you<br />
about this. We have not at any time changed our policy you must<br />
distinguish between the policy and the way you give effect to it.<br />
The broad policy of the Liberal Party has not substantially<br />
changed in the last 12 years; but we havve had to deal with an<br />
enormous vriety of changing circumstances. The application of<br />
our policy to these matters has, I think, been employed to the<br />
considerable satisfaction of the people of Australia. The<br />
policy is one thing; the way you give effect to it is another.<br />
Now our policy let's got this clearly in our minds<br />
is to produce economic stability not boom and burst economic </p>
<p>stability as the foundation for notional development. Every new<br />
building must have a firm foundation. Building this now<br />
country of Ours, with all these enormous opportunities you sop<br />
them in your own State, in Queensland we can't develop these<br />
resources without having capital to our hands, because all these<br />
things take groat investments. How are you going to get capital<br />
to your hand if your economic position is one of instability, if<br />
inflation goes rip-snorting along? Do you suppose that people<br />
in other countries who entrust Australians with a great deal of<br />
their capital, would do it if the finances of this country were<br />
blowing around like those of a South American Republic? Don't<br />
believe it for one moment. Wiatever some of my opponents may say<br />
about these matters, the people who count around the world have<br />
the greatat belief iz what we are doing, and in the object that<br />
we have to maintain a stable foundation for a great Australia.<br />
4e were told, not so long back, a few months back,<br />
before the end of last year, that all these strange measures we<br />
were taking would disturb people overseas, that we were ruining<br />
our prospects of getting investments into Australia. The answer<br />
is that in 1960, the boom year, we had a record amount of<br />
investment in Australia. But in 1961, the year in which we are<br />
told that the economy is wrecked, we are having a bigger<br />
investment from overseas than we had last year. ( Applause) I<br />
don't want you to think that that is just a matter of Government<br />
borrowing, I'm not talking about Government borrowing. You may<br />
think that some plausible old boy like me can go away and borrow<br />
a bit of money on the public account perhaps I can, I don't<br />
know, but I've done it a bit in my time. But I'm not talking<br />
about that. I'm talking about private capital investment in<br />
Australia which now amounts to hundreds of millions a year. If<br />
we didn't have it our balances of payments problem would have<br />
become completely hopeless of being contained years ago. Why do<br />
we want this money? I know that there are those wlho say " It's a<br />
very great mistake to let foreigners get investrents in your own<br />
country". Well let me tell you this, or remind you of it.<br />
Australia has an increasing population that nobody<br />
dreamed of once t We have a large irmigration programme. We are<br />
today, what, l-j millions? At our present rate of advance many<br />
of those in this hall tonight will see a population of<br />
millions in : Lustralia. More and more as time goes on this is<br />
becoming a considerable country in terms of human beings. But<br />
it happens to be a country roughly the same size as the United<br />
States of America. It has resources of many of which as yet we<br />
know nothing. We haven't found oil yet, effectively; but I<br />
have yet to meet a knowledgeable man who isn't confident that we<br />
will. The indications are all there. used to thin1: of the<br />
north as a dry and very arid country. lie knew that we had soqe<br />
lead and zinc at Broken Hill and we know that we had groat coal<br />
resources on the east coast of Australia and so on. We'vle onlr<br />
just begun to realise in Australia, haven't we, the immense<br />
resources that have been unearthed of uranium, the tremendous<br />
resources of bauxite, with all the prospects of aluminium<br />
industries in the very, very near future. The more the<br />
geologists go out, and the Yeophysicists go out, the more the<br />
mineral wealth of Australia will be tapped. But you can't<br />
tap it without enormous investments, not only of skill, but of<br />
money. Ten million people can't produce all the capital that is<br />
needed to develop a country that may hold 50 or 60 millions when<br />
it is developed. This is elementary common sense.<br />
Therefore w( e, as a Government have always been in<br />
favour of people investing their capital in Australia, producing<br />
employment for thousands and th. usands of people. Making<br />
profits? Yes. But bringing to Australia something without<br />
which we would become a stagnant community. If our policies </p>
<p>were as silly, as changeable, as some people think I don't<br />
imagine for one moment that the hard-headed people in the United<br />
States, in Great Britain, on the Continent, would regard AustraJa<br />
as the greatest field for investm ent that is now open to then<br />
outside their own countries.<br />
That is our policy stability, development. But we<br />
have, of course, changed the applications; even since November<br />
of last year we've made changes. And people have laughed and<br />
said " There you are, they don't know their own minds". May I<br />
remind you of this: every change that we have made since our<br />
announcements of November, 1960 has been in the direction of<br />
softening the severity of one o1 the measures announced in<br />
November. Didn't we make it clear at the very beginning that we<br />
weren't putting these things onfor fun; we weren't having a<br />
credit squeeze for fun; we weren't having increased sales tax<br />
for fun; we weren't doing what we were doing about deductibility<br />
of interest in Company transactions for fun? U4e were doing it to<br />
quell a boom, and, that as we succeeded, these measures would be<br />
relaxed. That is exactly what has happened.<br />
Take the motor car industry, a very important<br />
industry. We started off in November by doing two things: first<br />
there was the general credit policy which involved through the<br />
Central Bank, the Reserve Bank, a tight control of advances<br />
policy; and second, we increased sales tax on motor vehicles by<br />
By early this year it became clear, on the evidence,<br />
that this was having a double effect. A lot of people were<br />
saying " Well we won't buy a car yet, the Government can't keep<br />
on the extra sales tax in election year when it is producing a<br />
Budget, let's wait four or five months and we'll get it without<br />
the 10% tax". It was therefore quite clear that there was an<br />
undue sag in the demand for cars and motor vehicles. When this<br />
was established we didn't sit there pig-headedly saying " No, we<br />
said what we were going to do in November and nothing can<br />
change it". We said " That's right, the effect is too great". So<br />
we got rid of the added Sales Tax. Somebody says that's a<br />
bewildering change of direction. I would have thought it was<br />
the obvious logical result of the broad policy that we had<br />
announced. You company men, you take the great problem of whether<br />
you can deduct for income tax purposes the interest that you pay<br />
on money borrowed, sometimes on very short term, interest<br />
deductible before the profit is struck. Quite frankly we thought<br />
that this was leading to an abnormal expansion of credit so we<br />
said " We're going to limit the extent to which it can be<br />
deducted". WJe brought in a measure that was, I agree, a bit<br />
rough and ready, the best that could be worked out at the time;<br />
and by the time it operated it had a great deal of effect. Then<br />
we had to consider whether that measure which was to peter out<br />
at the end of June ought to be replaced by a permanent measure.<br />
Quite frankly you couldn't work out a permanent measure that<br />
wouldn't produce the most tremendous uncertainty in the business<br />
community. Therefore we said " We'll drop it; we won't go on<br />
with it after the end of June". Was this a bewildering change<br />
of front? I would have thought that every man in this hall<br />
tonight who has anything to do with companies, or their management,<br />
would have found it a very agreeable decision on the part<br />
of the Government; and a very sensible application of its broad<br />
policy. Therefore don't let us be too upset about the<br />
allegation that we change our minds. </p>
<p>I give you a third example, a very important one.<br />
That there were boon conditions in the building industry last<br />
year, as I've said to you, is unquestionable, and something had<br />
to be done about it. We applied our rules. It became apparent,<br />
not in a hurry but by about April of this year, that there was<br />
an undue fall in the rate of house construction. We didn't<br />
leave it alone. Ue at once got to work to see what could be<br />
done; and uhat have we done?<br />
I would just like to toll you this because it is<br />
perhaps overlooked. In order to restore the level of home<br />
building, not to an exorbitant rate, but to a proper and healthy<br />
rate, we, the Government of the Commonwealth, were in touch with<br />
the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank was in touch with trading<br />
banks. The trading banks themselves much to their credit, not<br />
being banks that usually lend money to a great extent on housing<br />
because it is not a normal banking transaction, have in fact boon<br />
laying out more money, substantially more money, in the housing<br />
field. The savings banks? Why we made an arrangement only a<br />
month or six weeks ago which involved the Commonwealth Savings<br />
Bank in finding another œ 5m. on housing ovor the last three<br />
months, or two months. At the last Loan Council meeting last<br />
year's State works programme, a substantial percentage of which<br />
is paid for out of the Commonwealth Budget, and therefore out of<br />
Commonwealth taxes, was maintained and was added to by œ lOm. of<br />
which œ 6m. in the cut-up is an addition to last year's housing<br />
vote. These are large sums of money. You can hardly say that a<br />
Government is unconscious of the housing problem if by those<br />
direct means it succeeds in putting into circulation œ 6m. and<br />
and another œ 3m. on the other item that I mentioned. This<br />
is a large sum of money to be going into added operation at this<br />
time of the year.<br />
We did that because we weren't particularly afraid of<br />
being told that we had changed our minds. We hadn't changed our<br />
minds. We were giving effect to our policy, which was to pull<br />
the boom down to normal and relax the severity of -i= easures as<br />
opportunity offered, and as occasion required.<br />
There is just one other matter that I want to put to<br />
you. I had almost forgotten this but my friend, the Chairman,<br />
told me last night that this was something I ought to say<br />
something about. Not long ago my colleague Mr. Holt, the Treasurer,<br />
made a statement to the House about a drawing that we had made<br />
from the International Monetary Fund. Now I ari not going to bore<br />
you stiff by talking about these intricacies of international<br />
finance, but Australia happens to belong to the International<br />
Monetary Fund, we are a subscribing member, we've put a bit of<br />
money into it in our day, just as other countries that belong to<br />
it have, and we have certain drawing rights. Not a bad idea.<br />
If you put a bit of money in the Bank it's rather useful to know<br />
that you might be able to take it out when you want it. It's as<br />
simple as that. We had drawing rights in the International<br />
Monetary Fund, and we made a drawing. Not because we were<br />
desperate about our international reserves, but because it is a<br />
very good second line of defence if your imports remain high.<br />
This was done before imports began to fall, quite recently.<br />
In the course of making our drawing we submitted a<br />
document to the Intornational Monetary Fund. I may say that that<br />
fund, which is managed by some of the shrewdest and ablest<br />
banking minds in the world, were good en. ugh to say that our<br />
policy in Australia was, to then, a classical example of the<br />
right policy to pursue in dealing with an inflationary boom. So<br />
you see of course they don't have votes in Australia so they </p>
<p>can't help me at the next election it's rather nice to think<br />
that they thought that way. But when you make a drawing you put<br />
a document in; and when this document was published in the<br />
House, tabled in the House there was no secret about it one<br />
or two newspapers, I regret to say, or perhaps I should be more<br />
particular7 one or two rather hurried sub-editors in newspapers,<br />
put a flaring headline on the report " Credit Squeeze until June,<br />
1962". Probably some of you saw it. It must have had a very<br />
depressing effect on a lot of people. It was quite untrue. The<br />
document didn't say that at all. So that there may be no<br />
risunderstanding I would like to read to you the two material<br />
paragraphs from the document that we presented to the fund. I<br />
don't think you will quarrel with a word of them. Tho first is<br />
this " Economic conditions in Australia are subject to rapid<br />
change"<br />
as indeed they are in this country of drought and fluctuating<br />
wool prices, and what have you<br />
" and are influenced by a number of external factors outside<br />
the Government's control. Policy has therefore frequently<br />
to be adapted to meet a shift in conditions. The<br />
declarations of policy made here must therefore be understood<br />
as applying only to conditions as they now appear.<br />
Should any major shift in the direction, or emphasis of<br />
policy become necessary during the currency of the arrangement<br />
the Australian Government would be ready to consult<br />
with the Fund, and, if necessary, reach new understandings<br />
before any further request is made".<br />
There's nothing in that, is there, that indicates that we have<br />
padlocked ourselves until June, 1962? It's too silly, because<br />
since that headline you have seen two or three of these<br />
relaxations that I have talked about. Those of you who read the<br />
paper and cast a wintry look on the financial columns of the<br />
press will have noticed only two days ago the Commonwealth Bank<br />
has just made a substantial release, another C17-2. to the trading<br />
banks out of the special reserve deposits. This headline was<br />
always what they call, in homely terms, " a furphy", and was<br />
based, I suppose, on the next pararaph:<br />
" Seasonal needs apart, the monetary authorities"<br />
that's in Australia<br />
" intend to keep a firm control over the liquidity position<br />
of the banks"<br />
that's quite right, the Banks would want that, and they do it<br />
themselves " with a view to limiting during the year ending June, 1962<br />
the amount of outstanding bank advances to a total that would be<br />
consistent with the maintenance of financial stability".<br />
Now if that isn't a perfectly , ood, cold, hard-headed,<br />
accurate description of the business of a central bank, then I'm<br />
a Dutchman. There it is. It's as plain and as simple as it can<br />
be. It's a sound statement of a sound policy. If any final<br />
proof were needed of the inaccuracy of this rather depressing<br />
headline it would be found in the fact, the undoubted fact, that<br />
bank advances, notwithstanding the squeeze that we've heard so<br />
much about, are today highr than they were a year ago. </p>
<p>All that, ladies and gentlerien, cones to this. I do<br />
ask you to believe, as I know you do that we don't act<br />
impetuously. We do an imiense amount of work on those matters.<br />
We do know what we are talking about on these matters. Many of<br />
us have had years and years of experience, working in the middle<br />
of all these problens, year after year. We are not newcomers,<br />
we are not novices, we are not theoretical people such as some<br />
of those I occasionally hear on the other side. What we have<br />
done we have done, I believe, quite rightly. I believe the<br />
results are justifying what was done. I know there are aspects<br />
of it which gives us all concern. There's rather too much<br />
unemployment under the circumstances that now exist. There had<br />
to be, no doubt, some transfer of people from one kind of<br />
employment to another if you were dealing with a boom.<br />
This is not a permanent state of affairs. This is a<br />
temporary phase that we are going through. I venture to say,<br />
whatever the result of the next election may be, that not long<br />
after the next election, most of us, most of you, most of the<br />
people you know, will be looking back and saying, " Well, it was<br />
temporary. Ill that's over. I-e're back into the stream of<br />
normal prosperity. We have a wonderful future in our country,<br />
of course we have". I'm not afraid of depression in 1962. I<br />
would be afraid of an inflationary boom in 1962 if we hadn't<br />
taken the steps that we have taken. But having taken those<br />
steps I will go on record, tonight, as saying to you that I<br />
believe that 1962, next year, is going to be one of the happiest,<br />
most productive, most profitable years, that this country has<br />
ever known. </p>
