    <content><![CDATA[<p>I shall be visiting Thailand on NovemberÂ 19-22, 1983 at the invitation of the Thai Prime Minister, General Prem Tinsulanonda. I shall be having discussions with General Prem and his colleagues on matters of substantial importance to both our Governments.</p>
<p>The region of which Thailand and Australia are members is of fundamental, strategic and economicÂ interest to both countries, and our respective Governments share a commitment to the enhancement of the region's stability and prosperity.</p>
<p>Thailand, both in a bilateral sense and as a member of ASEAN is of great importance to Australia's foreign policy interests and I will be looking, in my discussions, for ways of developing further the relationship between Australia and Thailand.</p>
