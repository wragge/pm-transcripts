    <content><![CDATA[<p>02 TRANSCRIPT OF PRE-RECORDED INTERVIEW WITH NIREE CREED, CROSS<br />COUNTRY, 29 OCTOBER 1989<br />E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />CREED: For years Australia and other smaller traders on the<br />. world market have been complaining to GATT and anyone else<br />who'll listen about America's policy of subsidising its<br />farmers. Now, it seems, someone has listened. In Geneva<br />this week the United States suggested to GATT, the General<br />Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, that all subsidies be eased<br />out. The American proposal is to end all international<br />agricultural export subsidies within five years and domestic<br />support within ten years. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke,<br />told Cross Country he welcomed the proposal.<br />PM: Well, I think the main sector, Niree, that will benefit<br />will be our wheat growers. They have, it's calculated that<br />the, just the price discrimination element of the Export<br />Enhancement Program of the United States, probably cost our<br />wheat growers about $ 200 million in the year 87/ 88 and led<br />to a cut back in production of around six, well probably<br />altogether, the calculation is about one million tonne<br />production or six percent cut back. Tf you take our barley<br />growers too and you take the market they had in Saudi<br />Arabia, it's estimated that in, I think it's 85/ 86, had a<br />market of about $ 282 million. From there, that's cut back<br />now to about $ 16 million in 87/ 88. Now, they are two areas<br />where our agricultural producers will benefit and so they<br />should. They're the most efficient producers in the world.<br />CREED: Do you think the Europeans will agree to it? That's<br />the big stumbling block isn't it?<br />PM: Well the ball is now ver y much in their court isn't it?<br />I mean, we've been putting the arguments to the Americans<br />and to the Europeans and I think now, as a result of the<br />quite dramatic decision by the United States, the onus is<br />very, very much now on the Europeans. So we in the Cairns<br />Group have been trying to get this position established. I<br />think the Europeans will find it very difficult not to<br />respond positively.<br />ends</p>
