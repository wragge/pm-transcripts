    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia Day is an opportunity to celebrate the extraordinary achievement</p>
<p> which is our cohesive society.</p>
<p>It is easy to underestimate the scale of our achievement in building</p>
<p> a harmonious community with the rich cultural variety we enjoy.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to live in a society in which people of different</p>
<p> backgrounds feel confident to celebrate and share the richness of</p>
<p> their traditions, customs, culture, language and religious faiths.</p>
<p>The ethnic diversity and tolerance of our community gives Australia</p>
<p> a unique standing in the world. This status is underpinned by the</p>
<p> traditional Australian values of persistence, mateship, voluntary</p>
<p> effort and optimism.</p>
<p>The past year was dotted with priceless examples of these qualities</p>
<p> including the magnificent response to the Thredbo landslide and the</p>
<p> recent devastating bushfires around the nation.</p>
<p>As we reflect on nearly a centenary of Federation, it is fitting to</p>
<p> recognise that the accomplishments of 97 years as a federation are</p>
<p> immense.</p>
