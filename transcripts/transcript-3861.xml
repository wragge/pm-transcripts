Press Statement No. 547<br />
August 1975<br />
NAMIBIA DAY<br />
Acting Foreign Minister, Mr Whitlam, reiterated<br />
today Australia's moral and material support to the people<br />
of Namibia. In a statement to mark Namibia Day on 26 August the<br />
Acting Minister said that Namibia Day had been designatdd by<br />
the United Nations at the General Assembly session in 1973 as<br />
an annual reminder of the illegal jurisdiction of South Africa<br />
over the territory. The Australian Government, he said, was particularly<br />
concerned about the deprivation of basic human rights and the<br />
exte-iision of the policy of apartheid and the homelands ( Bantustans)<br />
policy into the territory by South Africa.<br />
The Minister recalled that in 1966 Australia had<br />
supported a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly<br />
terminating South-Africa's mandate, and in 1972, 1973 and 1974<br />
had supported resolutions of the General Assembly and Security<br />
Council reaffirming the decision of the International Court of<br />
Justice that South Africa should withdraw from Namibia.<br />
In May 1974 the Australian Government had protested to<br />
South Africa over the mass arrests of members and supporters of<br />
the indigenous political organisation, SWAPO ( South West African<br />
Peoples Organisation), which it regarded as a denial of legitimate<br />
political rights.<br />
Australia's concern for the people of Namibia was<br />
further demonstrated on 1 January 1975 when it became a member<br />
of the United Nations Council for Namibia, a body established by<br />
the United Nations General Assembly to administer the territory<br />
until it achieves independence. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Australian Government had given material assistance<br />
to Namibia by contributing $ 10,000 to the United Nations Fund<br />
for Namibia in 1974/ 75 and would be contributing $ 25,000 in<br />
1975/ 76. Mr Whitlam said that the swiftly changing situation<br />
in Africa, due to the independence of former colonial territories,<br />
as well as the increasing activity of various national liberation<br />
groups, had given new impetus to the struggle by the peoples of<br />
southern Africa for self-determination and independence.<br />
The Australian Government called on the Government of<br />
South Africa to recognise its international obligations, to<br />
relinquish its illegal jurisdiction over Namibia and to facilitate<br />
the transition to majority rule and independence.<br />
The longer the problem of Namibia remained unsolved,<br />
said Mr Whitlam, the less was the chance that the final solution<br />
would be achieved peacefully.<br />
