STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HION P J KEATING MP<br />
The allegation tonight by Dr Hcwson that I have corruptly bcnefitcd personally from<br />
Government decisions is an unsustainable and outrageCous slur.<br />
Dr Hewson, who last week decried factual revelations about his tax minimisation as<br />
" gutter politics" has tonight made a highly defamatory claim which he knows he cannot<br />
back up.<br />
He should withdraw it and apologise immediately.<br />
