FOR PRESS: P. M. No0 .6126<br />
Statement by the Prime Ministetr1 the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert<br />
Menzie s<br />
It is true that I have been having some<br />
discussions over recent timeswoith my colleague, Mr. McEwen,<br />
over electoral matters. But these have been essentially<br />
explora tory. On redistribution, for example, we have both<br />
been trying to work out what the area of difference may<br />
be so that we may have some ideas to present to Cabinet,<br />
which will then decide the course to follow.<br />
So far as individual electorates are concerned,<br />
all I need say is that in the Liberal Party and, I imagine,<br />
in the Country Party, a decision as to whether or not to<br />
contest a particular seat is a matter for the organisations<br />
and not for the Parliamentary leaders. Though it is true<br />
that over the years we have not infrequently proffered our<br />
opinions and our advice, the final decisions are not ours<br />
to make. Of course we behave, as sensible men, in a<br />
composite government. At the next election we want an<br />
overall victory for the Government, which means the minimum<br />
of electoral friction between the parties. Sometimes threecornered<br />
contests are useful; sometimes they are unavoidable.<br />
Sometimes they are damaging. Mr. McEwen and I, as usual,<br />
would like in the common cause, to confine the areas of<br />
conflict. But we both recognise that ultimately the<br />
decision to contest any electorate is made by our political<br />
organisations. We therefore have no authority to make a<br />
pact, and have not made one.<br />
I h, 7ve consulted Mr. McEwen before issuing this<br />
statement. He completely agrees with it.<br />
CANBERRA, 13th August, 1963. </p>
