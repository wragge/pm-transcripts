I) J4AUSTRALIA L<br />
FOR PRESS5 DECEMBER 1977<br />
The Prime Minister today released the text of an exchange of<br />
messages regarding interest rates between himself and Mr. Wran<br />
( copies attached).<br />
Mr. Fraser drew attention to Mr. Wran's support for the<br />
Government's interest rate policy in contrast to the criticism<br />
by Messrs. Hurford and Hayden.<br />
For example, Mr. Hurford on 12 November 1977 said:<br />
" The drop in interest rates was only temporary..."<br />
And on 14 November 1977 he said:<br />
none of us ( Federal and State Labor Leaders) is going<br />
to pretend that-the-ASB-interest rate is a significant one..."<br />
"( There is) general realisation in the business community<br />
that right now inflation is on the way up.-not down..."<br />
( Note, in this context, that business is lowering debenture<br />
rates, clearly reflecting lower inflationary expectations.)<br />
And on 15 November 1977 Mr. Hurford said:<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, was not telling the<br />
truth about the outlook for interest rate cuts..."<br />
Mr. Hayden said, on 12 November 1977, in respect of the<br />
reduction in the rate on Australian Savings Bonds:<br />
" It is scene-setting for the election with bad economic<br />
policy" attempt to rig the money market..."<br />
an inauthentic adjustment..."<br />
it cannot last..." F77/ 290 .4 </p>
<p>STELEX ; TO PRIME MINISTER FROM MR. WRAN. 30TH NOVEMBER, 1977.<br />
THE RT HONJ. M. FRASER, M. P.,<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
CANBERRA. YOU WILL BE AWARE THAT IN A TELEX MESSAGE ON 8 NOVEMBER TO THE<br />
CHAIRMAN OF LOAN COUNCIL I ADVOCATED A REDUCTION OF 0.5 PERCENT IN<br />
THE INTEREST RATE ON AUSTRALIAN SAVINGS BONDS. I ALSO URGED THAT<br />
ALL GOVERNMENTS. SHOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO<br />
COMPLEMENT THE CUT IN THE SAVINGS BOND RATE, AS PART OF THE PROCESS<br />
OF LOWERING THE STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WHICH HAD<br />
COMMENCED WITH THE PROGRESSIVE REDUCTIONS IN THE MARKET YIELDS ON<br />
GOVERNMENT BONDS AND CONTINUED WITH THE DECISION TO REDUCE RATES<br />
ON SEMI-GOVERNMENTAL BORROWINGS.<br />
YOU WILL HAVE OBSERVED THAT REDUCTIONS HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN MADE IN<br />
RESPECT OF GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED LOANS AND STATE SUPERANNUATION<br />
BOARD LOANS TO TERMINATING BUILDING SOCIETIES IN NSW. I HAVE ALSO<br />
ANNOUNCED A 0.5% REDUCTION IN CREDIT UNION MAXIMUM DEPOSIT RATES AND<br />
ONE CREDIT UNION IN NSW HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO CUT ITS LENDING<br />
RATE BY 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM DECEMBER 1ST. THE BUILDING SOCIETY<br />
MOVEMENT IN THIS STATE STANDS READY TO REDUCE ITS RATES IMMEDIATELY<br />
THE RELEVANT BANK RATES FALL.<br />
AT LEAST TWO OTHER STATES HAVE ALSO INITIATED ACTION DESIGNED TO<br />
COMPLE4MENT THE CUT IN THE SAVINGS BOND RATE.<br />
I AM THEREPORE PUZZLED BY YOUR REPORTED STATEMENT THAT YOU ARE<br />
DISAPPOINTED THAT INTEREST RATES HAVE NOT COME DOWN, AND AM GREATLY<br />
CONCERNED BY YOUR GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO ACT AS YET ON BANK INTEREST<br />
RATES. IF THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO DELAY BRINGING ABOUT A<br />
CUT IN BANK. DEPOSIT AND LENDING RATES, THERE WILL BE A GROWING DANGER<br />
THAT THE MOVE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES ACROSS-THE-BOARD WILL LOSE<br />
MOMENTUM AND, HAVING DONE SO, TURN BACK IN ITS TRACKS. THE LONGER<br />
YOUR GOVERNMENT WAITS, THE MORE SPECULATION AND NERVOUSNESS WILL GROW<br />
AND MAKE ACTION INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AS THE FLOW OF FUNDS BETWEEN<br />
BANKS, OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES AND GOVERNMENT SECURITIES IS<br />
ai -tW L i </p>
<p>-2<br />
PROGRESSIVELY. DISTORTED. THE CONSEQUENCES OF A FURTHER DELAY WOULD BE<br />
PARTICULARLY SERIOUS SHOULD SUCH A DISTORTED FLOW OF FUNDS JEOPARDISE<br />
THE FUNDING OF THE COMMONWEALTH BUDGET DEFICIT.<br />
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE NECESSARY AND URGENT NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS<br />
OF REDUCING THE LEVEL OF ALL INTEREST RATES IS FOR YOUR GOVERNMENT<br />
TO USE ITS PERSUASIVE AND STATUTORY INFLUENCE TO REDUCE BANK DEPOSIT<br />
AND LENDING RATES. I URGE YOU TO DO THIS WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY..<br />
I AM SENDING A COPY OF-THIS MESSAGE TO ALL OTHER PREMIERS. </p>
<p>MESSAGE FROM PRIME MINISTER T'O MR. WRAN. 5TH DECEMBER, 1977,<br />
Thank you for your message of 30th November.<br />
I feel strongly as to the need to reduce interest rates over the<br />
wide spectrum as they affect all sectors of the community, particularl<br />
those associated with home builders and, small business. I have no<br />
doubt-that such, reductions will materially assist an relieving the<br />
unemployment problem.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is determined that there should be a<br />
substantial reduction in all rates. I have recently indicated<br />
that interest rates affecting the ge era. l public could be reduced<br />
by up to 2% throughout the next 12 m nths. We have laid the<br />
groundwork in the reductions in bond rates. I appreciate the<br />
action that you have taken in the areas under your control, and<br />
I have noted that some new issue rates for company debentures have<br />
continued to decline...<br />
However, also appreciate that downward movementsin rates have to<br />
be associated with responsible financial management and proceed<br />
in line with other economic policies. While determined t achieve<br />
the objective I have mentioned I believe that it would be counterproductive<br />
if movements in bank interest rates became an issue in<br />
the election. 1 think you would agree with this.<br />
fK<br />
After the election we will move as quickly as practicable in the<br />
direction I have indicated.<br />
In view of the public interest in this matter, I propose to<br />
release the text of your telex and of this reply.<br />
( Malcolm Fraser) </p>
