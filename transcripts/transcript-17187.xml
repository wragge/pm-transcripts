    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government is planning for Queensland's future health workforce needs.</p>
<p>The Government is providing up to $22 million to support additional clinical training places for students at local universities - which will encourage more health students to study and work across Queensland.</p>
<p>Brisbane, Goondiwindi, Warwick, Cherbourg, and the Gold Coast are just some of the locations throughout Queensland where students will now have additional high-quality clinical training opportunities.</p>
<p>Students who live and learn in a community are more likely to stay after graduation, and this in turn means more Queenslanders will get better access to appropriate health care, regardless of their location.</p>
<p>Griffith University, University of Queensland, Bond University, Queensland University of Technology, James Cook University and the Gold Coast TAFE will share in the $22 million.</p>
<p>This will support approximately 1040 additional clinical training placements for students currently enrolled in medicine, nursing, psychology, physiotherapy, pharmacy, podiatry and a number of other disciplines.</p>
<p>The $22 million will fund opportunities ranging from placements in rural and remote GP settings to supporting new training opportunities in private hospitals. The students will be able to experience the private, public and not for profit health sectors in Queensland.</p>
<p>This announcement is in addition to the recent Rudd Government announcement of $632 million to train an additional 6,000 GPs and specialists.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is building a health workforce to meet the needs of all Australians, now and into the future.</p>
<p>Under the National Health and Hospitals plan, the Rudd Government will shoulder the majority of the funding burden - 60 per cent of all public hospital services - meaning more money is available to meet rising health costs.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's plan will see health services funded nationally and run locally through local hospital networks to deliver better health for local communities</p>
