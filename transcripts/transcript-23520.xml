    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Abbott Government will provide $6.4 million in the 2014-15 financial year to help local communities in New South Wales to address crime and anti-social behaviour hot-spots.</p>
<p>The funds, provided in the Budget, will be used towards projects such as CCTV and improved street lighting in public areas and local entertainment precincts.</p>
<p>The three-year, $50 million Safer Streets Programme delivers on the Coalitionâs election commitment. It is part of the Governmentâs Economic Action Strategy to build a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>
<ul><li>NSW $6.45m</li>
<li>QLD $5.89m</li>
<li>VIC $3.09m</li>
<li>WA $3.1m</li>
<li>SA $0.36m</li>
<li>NT $0.30m</li>
</ul><p>Safer Streets is funded through the proceeds of crime. The previous Labor government had frozen these funds so it could be used to improve its Budget bottom line instead of funding the fight against crime.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty individual projects have been accepted and will be provided funding in the 2014-15 financial year.</p>
<p>The Safer Streets Programme means more security to reduce street crime and violence, which will in turn improve community safety.</p>
<p>All Australians have the right to feel safe and secure and this programme will help achieve that.</p>
