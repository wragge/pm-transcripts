    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced a $30 million Live Exports Assistance Package to provide short-term help to individual primary producers and related businesses affected by the temporary suspension of live cattle exports to Indonesia.</p>
<p>This assistance is in addition to the support already provided directly to industry workers, and complements the $5 million animal welfare support package announced by the Cattle Council yesterday.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced the assistance, to be delivered directly to businesses to assist with the management of the suspension, following discussions with live export industry representatives.</p>
<p>The Government will provide immediate grants of up to $5,000 for eligible businesses, with further grants of up to $20,000 also available.</p>
<p>This short-term injection is designed to help alleviate some of the immediate pressures on businesses associated with suspension. The Government will continue to work closely with the industry, as well as the Northern Territory, Western Australian and Queensland Governments, to manage the impact of the suspension.</p>
<p>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Joe Ludwig said that the Government remains committed to the live export trade.</p>
<p>No-one wants the suspension to last a day longer than it needs too. It is clear individual producers are under pressure. These grants represent an immediate response to some of those pressures. </p>
<p>The Government remains committed to supporting this industry through the suspension. These grants provide some immediate short-term relief to producers and business doing it tough. </p>
