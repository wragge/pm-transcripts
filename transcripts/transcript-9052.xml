PRIME MINISTER 132/ 93<br />
STATEME; NT BY THE PRIME MThISTER, THEl HON JP J K0; AT1NG, MP<br />
CONRAD BLACK, JOHN HEWSON9 AND SENATE INQUURIES<br />
Today in Question Time I made clear my intention to refuise any request to appear<br />
before a Senate inquiry.<br />
I make no apology for refu~ sing to take part in yet another of the Senate's costly<br />
political fishing expeditions, engineered by and for the Opposition.<br />
I will continue to be available to answer any number of questions on this matter in the<br />
House of Representatives.<br />
As I said in Parliament today, my Government and I have acted with complete<br />
propriety in our dealings with Mr Conrad Black. Further, unlike the Opposition<br />
Leader, the Cabinet has given proper consideration to the national interest in our<br />
dealings with Mr Black.<br />
It is reported this morning that Dr Hewson is willing to appear before a sham Senate<br />
inquiry. I look forward to watching him explain why he undertook to allow Mr Black<br />
unlimited control of the Fairfax press, regardless of the national interest, and how he<br />
separated that undertaking from his admitted discussion of Fairfax journalistic<br />
standards with Mr Black.<br />
CANBERRA 24 November, 1993 </p>
