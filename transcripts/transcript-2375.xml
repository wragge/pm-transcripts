FOR PRESS PM. No. 24/ 1971<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIAN ELECTIONS<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
There has been a swing away from the Government<br />
in Western Australia, but the final results will not be known for some<br />
time. Further, I am informed that it appears the Government has<br />
definitely lost two seats and there are others in doubt. Whether or<br />
not there is a change in Government will depend on the results in<br />
those seats. Whatever the outcome, I think it true to say<br />
that Sir David Brand has demonstrated himself to be an outstanding<br />
Premier of Western Australia and has contributed greatly to that<br />
State's progress.<br />
CANBERRA, 21 February 1971 </p>
