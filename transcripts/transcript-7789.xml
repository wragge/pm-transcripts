PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PAN PACIFIC HOTEL, 24 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Margaret Thatcher said she was appalled at your<br />
attack on her in the session yesterday. They're very strong<br />
words. What's your reaction?<br />
PM: Yeah, they are strong words and they' re inaccurate. The<br />
facts are quite simple, that we put our position in the full<br />
session before going to Langkawi. My Foreign Minister and her's<br />
were there in the negotiating session dealing with the draft that<br />
was to come to Heads of Government. As I said concessions were<br />
made by us and by others there and there was a clear<br />
understanding on the part of everyone at the retreat that<br />
agreement had been reached in the clear terms and then on Mrs<br />
Thatcher's motion, that was accepted. After that having been<br />
done and Mr Mugabe for instance being cut short and amendments he<br />
was proposing on the basis that Mrs Thatcher said look, there is<br />
no need to argue this, we accept it. Now, when there was a<br />
position after that of repudiation of the agreement arrived at,<br />
then as far as I was concerned that could not be let to be passed<br />
in the full conference when we returned. I put that point, fully<br />
supported by Mr Mulroney. I believe that Mrs Thatcher has<br />
subsequently said that we were the only two to speak. She<br />
attempts to draw some conclusion from-that. The fact is, that<br />
every other, every other Head of Government supported the<br />
position put by Hawke and Mulroney. Every other one of them.<br />
JOURNALIST: She says your attack was futile too.<br />
PM: Well, all I can say is if you judge by the normally placid<br />
British press, that is, placid towards Mrs Thatcher, you could<br />
hardly draw that conclusion. The British press have rightly<br />
drawn the conclusion that the behaviour of their Prime minister<br />
was less than adequate. I mean I'm not getting into vicious<br />
language. I'm not getting into an attack on Mrs Thatcher because<br />
we consistently play this game inside the conference. We don't<br />
come out and say: wins, losses, someone knocked down, someone on<br />
a pedestal. We've never played that game. We've left that to<br />
others. I notice that it was in the British press that the first<br />
proposition was major victory, as it was put, for Britain. Now<br />
everyone knows, every single journalist here knows that that is a<br />
load of codswallopl<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: And the fact that it is a load of codswallop, I think has<br />
led to some of the subsequent behaviour of Britain, because when<br />
it was realised that the interpretation that they'd put out, that<br />
they had won a position and turned the Commonwealth around, when<br />
everyone realised that that was a manifest nonsense, then the<br />
media understandably, had some things to say. And then there was<br />
some attempt I think to backtrack or retrieve ground by Britain.<br />
Now that's their business. All I'm saying is that we conduct our<br />
affairs inside the conference. We don't seek to lambast<br />
afterwards and say there's been wins or losses. I do get a<br />
little bit annoyed when there is this really rather grievous<br />
misrepresentation of what everyone else knows are the facts.<br />
JOURNALIST: She's also suggesting that you in some way ambushed<br />
her with the five-point plan, that at the breakfast meeting there<br />
was no mention of the plan and then several hours later that it<br />
materialised. PM: Well this is a nonsense of course. I had John Bowan there<br />
with me, she had a person and I said: well we'll be talking<br />
about South Africa and we had a general discussion about it and I<br />
said we'll obviously have differences on this, we can't agree on<br />
it; our differences are well known and that was it. We were in<br />
the process of finalising our formulation there was no<br />
obligation on us to say this is precisely a plan that we' re<br />
putting. It was a clear understanding between us, having<br />
discussed the matter, that we were going to have different<br />
positions. JOURNALIST: With hindsight would it have been better to have<br />
drawn her into that process?<br />
PM: There was no way, there was no way you could draw her into<br />
it. Did you think that if I said to Mrs Thatcher: look<br />
Margaret, I'm going to be, here's the details of what I'm<br />
putting, I'm telling you that I'm going to be in favour of<br />
increased financial pressures if something more is not done by<br />
South Africa. I mean, her position is known. I respect it. The<br />
attitude I adopted in the breakfast meeting with her was one of<br />
respect. In other words, it's not as though we were coming de<br />
novo to this issue. We had traversed the ground, we knew that we<br />
have had difference of emphasis. I said to her we will have<br />
different positions on this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has she betrayed your trust then?<br />
PM: No, no, no. There is no betrayal of trust.<br />
JOURNALIST: The South Africans have taken comfort from Mrs<br />
Thatcher.' s stand. Do you find that offensive? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: No, no. The question of Mrs Thatcher's position on South<br />
Africa is for her and who draws comfort from that is also a<br />
matter, in a sense, for her and those who do the drawing of<br />
comfort. The position is, and really in the end you get down to<br />
this: that of the whole Commonwealth, the whole Commonwealth,<br />
the Commonwealth has said: we embrace and endorse Hawke's<br />
position, and that's been what's done. There is one person out<br />
on that and I just think as a matter of logic and of reasonable<br />
intellectual assumption, it's just a fair possibility that the<br />
Commonwealth as a whole minus one, may be right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed, Mr Hawke, that the CHOGM had<br />
to end so acrimoniously?<br />
PM: Well, I mean I don't accept that it has ended acrimoniously<br />
as far as the Commonwealth as a whole is concerned. There is one<br />
member of the Commonwealth who apparently is expressing some<br />
upset at the fact that the rest of the Commonwealth has taken a<br />
view about its behaviour. Now if you have 99 per cent taking a<br />
view unanimously and effectively and you have 1 per cent saying<br />
that they don't like what's happened, then I don't think that<br />
that's acrimony. I mean, it is better described as one being out<br />
of step.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you've used the meeting to put a plug for<br />
the Melbourne Olympic Games. How has that gone?<br />
PM: Well, in my bilaterals, I've said to people that Melbourne<br />
is very, very well placed to handle and conduct the Olympics in<br />
1996 and there's been, I think, a fairly favourable reaction to<br />
that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister can I ask you one other question<br />
about the communique does the wording of the communique mean<br />
that Australia now supports the idea of mandatory repatriation of<br />
Vietnamese boat people, because the communique makes no reference<br />
to voluntary repatriation.<br />
PM: Well the wording of the communique is essentially no<br />
different from the June Conference in Geneva on this matter.<br />
Australia's position hasn't changed on this. We've got a<br />
position which the essentials of it are: it is recognised by<br />
Australia and other people that we'vye moved from a position where<br />
people were political refugees to essentially where they' re<br />
economic refugees and that creates a whole different ball game.<br />
You can't expect either countries of first asylum or resettlement<br />
countries to have the same position towards people who are simply<br />
economic refugees saying that they don't like in economic terms,<br />
the regime, and are looking for somewhere else, better in<br />
economic. terms. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
In those circumstances, the question of repatriation assumes<br />
different proportions and you've got to be looking at them going<br />
back. That was recognised at Geneva. It was recognised in the<br />
language here today.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, it's the last day of CHOGM, would you like<br />
to sum up how this one's gone and where it leaves the relevance<br />
of the Commonwealth as an institution?<br />
PM: There obviously can't be any question about the relevance of<br />
the Commonwealth. I don't think there ever has been. I mean<br />
just lets look at it in terms of some of the things I talked<br />
about today. Where is the Commonwealth meeting going to be held<br />
next? It's going to be held in Zimbabwe. How has Zimbabwe<br />
emerged as a sovereign independent nation in the world? It<br />
emerged through the processes of the Commonwealth. The<br />
Commonwealth was uniquely placed to handle what was a potentially<br />
disastrous situation there in the dismemberment of what had<br />
previously been Rhodesia. It was uniquely the capacity and the<br />
influence and the processes of the Commonwealth which brought<br />
that potential tragedy to an end and has Zimbabwe emerging as an<br />
independent nation. It's therefore in a sense very, very<br />
appropriate that the next meeting should be held there because<br />
Zimbabwe is living proof of the relevance and the capacity and<br />
the uniqueness of the Commonwealth.<br />
Here at this meeting I think it's been particularly useful, if I<br />
can put it from Australia's point of view and I think also the<br />
interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. Obviously firstly, you<br />
go to South Africa. Now you've heard-' me quoted before on the<br />
statements coming out of South Africa itself on this issue.<br />
There can be no intelligent argument on this because you have the<br />
Minister for Finance, the ex-Governor of the Reserve Bank saying<br />
the two things that I've mentioned: one, that the sanctions have<br />
imposed intolerable strains and constraints on South Africa's<br />
economic development and secondly from that, it is imperative in<br />
their judgement, that to deal with that economic constraint they<br />
must change the political situation. So we've seen again the<br />
Commonwealth committed to an intensification of this situation,<br />
not as I've said for the sake of sanctions as such, but to keep<br />
the pressure up to bring the South African regime to the<br />
negotiating table. So there, as the results of the Commonwealth<br />
action in the past, been demonstrated and the commitment to<br />
continuing those processes.<br />
Secondly, of course you have uniquely now, the Commonwealth Plan<br />
of Action on the Environment. At the initiative of a developing<br />
country here, Malaysia, that we were able to get a unanimous<br />
position which will mean not just some pious statement, a<br />
collection of words, but a commitment to interchange knowledge<br />
and technologies within the Commonwealth, which means that those </p>
<p>of us who are fortunate enough to be more developed, to have<br />
experienced new technologies which are relevant to a range of<br />
environmental issues and concerns, pledging ourselves to share<br />
those technologies, that knowledge with those countries in need.<br />
A very dramatic, practical illustration of the unique capacity of<br />
the Commonwealth to be relevant to issues of vital concern.<br />
Then of course, on the issue of Cambodia, a confirmation of the<br />
position of Australia and the ASEAN states and fourthly, on the<br />
Uruguay round, picking up on the economic part of the communique<br />
the importance that the Commonwealth attaches to the Uruguay<br />
round being successful. I think the Commonwealth countries are<br />
going to be able to play a role in now pressing ahead in, this<br />
decreasing amount of time we've got, because the round finishes<br />
at the end of next year, the Commonwealth commiting itself to<br />
play its role in freeing up and liberalising international trade.<br />
In addition to those issues of course we had a recognition in the<br />
discussions and reflected in the communique on Antarctica and<br />
we'Ire very pleased that that has happened. Also a reference to<br />
and confirmation of the importance of my Asian Pacific Economic<br />
Conference initiative. That has been welcomed and we're pleased<br />
about that.<br />
We also have the confirmation of what we've done in the South<br />
Pacific out of the Forum, most particularly in regard to the<br />
worldwide ban we're seeking on driftnet fishing. We had the<br />
endorsement of the Australian initiative in regard to the<br />
Government and Industry Chemical Weapons Conference and in regard<br />
to our approaches to disarmament generally. So if you look at<br />
those whole range of issues, they are ones where the Australian<br />
position has been welcomed and endorsed and in which the<br />
Commonwealth has embraced the plans of action and approaches<br />
which will enable the Commonwealth to be of assistance in all<br />
those matters.<br />
In addition to all that, within the framework of the conference,<br />
I've also had the opportunity of significant bilateral meetings<br />
and they have been good, without being exhaustive about them, the<br />
long meeting with Benazir Bhutto, the very long meeting yesterday<br />
morning with my friend Rabbie Namaliu, the Prime Minister of<br />
Papua New Guinea, as of course I had with others. We also were<br />
able to use the meeting here to have discussions between myself<br />
and Prime Minister Mulroney and that was followed up by meetings<br />
with the officials where we have resolved now that the impasse<br />
that had developed on the issue of canned fruit exports from<br />
Australia into Canada in the context of the Canada United States.<br />
JOURNALIST: JHOoURwN LwIiSTl: l that now affect the industry Mr Hawke? </p>
<p>PM: It will mean that we're now going to be put into a more<br />
competitive position in the context of the Uruguay round<br />
negotiations. There will be a phasing down of the tariffs on<br />
Australian canned fruit going into Canada and this will be<br />
welcomed by the industry to put them into a more competitive<br />
position. JOURNALIST: Margaret Thatcher has just said that and I'm<br />
quoting directly I am in step with the South African people and<br />
in practical terms the Commonwealth is in step with me. How does<br />
that sit with you?<br />
PM: Well, really, it is amusing because what you've got is a<br />
situation that every other Commonwealth country here, every other<br />
Commonwealth country, has identified itself with the Commonwealth<br />
proposals on South Africa. It is one country alone which has<br />
expressed its reservations on that issue and that's Britain. Now<br />
if out of that you want some twisted logic which is saying the<br />
one person is in tune and all the rest are out of step, well then<br />
that's alright if Mrs Thatcher wants to say that but you know and<br />
every media commentator that is here knows what the facts are and<br />
the facts are not as Mrs Thatcher put them.. Now that's<br />
unfortunate but I say all those things without any rancour. I<br />
mean it's Mrs Thatcher who is getting very, very upset and using<br />
extravagant language now in the terms of the dilemma in which<br />
she's found herself. Now I'm sorry that she feels it necessary<br />
to use that rancourous language but you often find that when<br />
people have created a problem for themselves they tend to use<br />
extremes of language.<br />
JOURNALIST: Where does it leave relations between Australia and<br />
Britain? Is Mrs Thatcher the sort of person who could be trusted<br />
to do business with?<br />
PM: As far as I'm concerned, on every other issue than this, we<br />
have had productive relations. Her visit to Australia was<br />
welcome and productive. My return visit there earlier this year<br />
was similarly constructive, relevant, productive and I have no<br />
intention of allowing that relationship to be in any way<br />
adversely affected by our obvious difference on this issue and I<br />
trust that that will be the view and the position of<br />
Mrs Thatcher.<br />
