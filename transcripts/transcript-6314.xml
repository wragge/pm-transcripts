TRANSCRIPT -PRESS CONFERENCE WITH PREMIER ZHAO -PROOF ONI. Y<br />
JOURNALIST: WHEN FOREIGN.-MINISTER MR HAYDEN WAS IN PEKING LAST<br />
AUGUST AUSTRALIA AND CHINA AGREED TO DISAGREE. SINCE THEN HAS THERE<br />
BEEN ANY CHANGED POSiTION ON EITHER SIDE OR IS THERE STILL DISAGREEMENT<br />
ON THE INDO-CHINA QUESTION.<br />
PREMIER: I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE POSITION4 TAKEN BY CHINA AND THE<br />
POSITION TAKEN BY AUSTRALIA ON THE QUESTION OF KAMPUCHEA BASICALLY<br />
ARE THE SAME. IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE COMMON POINTS ON MAJOR ISSUES<br />
CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF KAMPUCHEA. OF COURSE WE ALSO HAVE<br />
DIFFERENCES ON SMALL ISSUES, CONCERNING fHE QUESTION OF KAMPUCHEA.<br />
FOR INSTANCE BOTH SIDES CONDEMN VIETNAM F-OR ITS INVASION OF<br />
KAMPUCHEA, BOTH SIDES STAND FOR VIETN4AMESE WITHDRAWAL AND BOTH SIDES<br />
AGREE THAT KAMPUCHEA SHOULD BECOME A PEACEFUL, NEUTRAL AND NONALIGNED<br />
COUNTRY AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL OF VIETNAMESE TROOP'. OF COURSE<br />
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETW4EEN THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE TWO<br />
COUNTRIES ON SOME SPECIFIC ASPECTS. BUT I THIN4K THAT THROUGH<br />
CONTINUOUS CO ! TACT, I THINK IT WILL ENABLE THE TWO SIDES TO ENHANCE<br />
THEIR MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. AND I THINK SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE<br />
TWO SIDES AS FAR AS KAMPUCHEA IS CONCERNED WILL NOT EFFECT OUR<br />
CO-OPERATION ON THE MAJOR ASPECTS CONCERN4ING THE QUESTION OF<br />
KAMPUCHEA. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE POINT THAT IS THAT I<br />
HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH PRIME MINISTER HAWKE ON THE<br />
QUESTION OF KAMPUCHEA. I THINK THIS MORNING WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT.<br />
JOURNALIST MR PREMIER LAST NIGHT IN YOUR SPEEC1H YOU REFERRED TO<br />
VIETNAM'S USE OF THE TERM DIALOGUE AND W4ERE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF IT.<br />
DOES THAT MEAN YOU BELIEVE DIALOGUE WITH VIETNAM A' THE MOMENT IS A<br />
WASTE OF TIME.<br />
PREMIER: THE VIETNAMESE FOREIGN MINISTER MR TAK SPREAD SOME RUMOURS<br />
TO THE EFFECT THAT CHINA AND VIETNAM HAD STARTED A DIALOGUE THROUGH<br />
CERTAIN CHANNELS AND HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT FOREIGN4<br />
MINISTER HAD A AT THE UNITED NATIONS. ALL THESE ARE SIMPLY<br />
MYTHS, FABRICATED STORIES.<br />
JOURNALIST: DOES THAT MEAN THAT DIALOGUE BET14EEN A' 2STRALIA AND<br />
VIETNAM IS ALSO A WASTE OF TIME AT THE MOMENT?<br />
PREMIER: OUR POSITION IS THAT WE ARE NOT FOR HAVING A DIALOGUE WITH<br />
VIETNAM. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO OTHERS HAVING A DIALGUE<br />
WITH VIETNAM. WHEN FOREIGN MINISTER HAYDEN WAS IN CHINA I SAID TO<br />
HIM I DO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD. BUT IF HAS THE BLESSINGS OF THE GOD AND<br />
IF HE CAN SUCCEED IN PERSUADING VIETNAM TO GET OUT OF KAMPUCHEA THAT<br />
OF COURSE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING. HOWEVER OF COURSE I DO 1NOT<br />
BELIEVE IN THAT GOD.<br />
JOURNALIST MR PREMIER AUSTRALIA AND CHI NA HAVE SEEMINGLY ENJOYED<br />
VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR OVER 11 YEARS. I WONDER WHAT YOU PUT<br />
THAT DOWN TO. I WONDER HOW SEEMINGLY THAT HAS WORK( ED So WELL. </p>
<p>PR MIER: SINCE THE ESTABLISH4MENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND CHINA OUR RELATIONS H/ iVE MAD7 GOOD PROGRESS IN ALL<br />
FIELDS TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTil SIDES. AND TH. NK THERE IS<br />
STILL VERY BIG POTENTIAL FOR-THE FURTHER EXTENSION OF OUR FRIENDLY<br />
CO-OPERATION. AND I THINK OUR CO-OPERATION W4ILL CONTINUE TO<br />
DEVELOP. AND I THINK THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RELATIONS HAS GIVEN<br />
PROOF TO ONE POINT THAT-IS COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS<br />
CAN DEVELOP THEIR RELATIONS SO LONG AS THE TWO SIDES ADOPT A FARSIGHTED<br />
AND A WISE POLICY. THAT PROVES ONE THING, THAT IS COUNTRIES<br />
WITH DIFFERENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS CAN VERY W4ELL ESTABLISH GOOD<br />
RELATIONS. I WISH TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION OF THE VERY FARSIGHTED<br />
POLICY PURSUED BY BOTH THE LABOR PARTY AND LIBERAL PARTY<br />
OF AUSTRALIA IN DEVELOPING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH CHINA.<br />
JOURNALIST: ARE YOU AND MR HAWKE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION OF KOREA.<br />
IS CHINA PREPARED TO PARTICIPATE IN TALKS ON. 4 RE-UNIFICATION.<br />
PREMIER: THE PROPOSAL PUT FORW4ARD BY DPRK IS A PROPOSAL FOR<br />
TRIPARTITE TALKS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE CHINA. I THINK THE DPRK<br />
HAS REASON TO MAKE THAT SUGGESTION, AND I THINK THEIR SUGGESTION IS<br />
REASONABLE. THAT IS BECAUSE THE DPRIK IS A PARTY TO THE QUESTION AND<br />
SOUTH KOREA IS A PARTY TO THE QUESTION AND THE UNITED STATES HAS<br />
TROOPS IN SOUTHKOREA, SO THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO A PARTY TO THAT<br />
QUESTION. I THINK THE QUESTION CANNOT BE RESOLVED WITHOUT UNITED<br />
STATES PARTICIPATION. AND SO WE DO NOT INTEND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE<br />
TALKS AND THE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY THE DPRK DOES NOT INCLUDE<br />
CHINA. </p>
