OPENING OF THE HAROLD HOLT MEMORIAL<br />
SWIMMING POOL<br />
MALVERN, VIC. 16 MARCH 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Mayor, Sir Robert Menzies and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
May I start by saying how glad I am to have the<br />
opportunity to be here today in my own electorate in which I am<br />
able to appear in all too infrequently, for reasons which I hope you<br />
will understand and forgive.<br />
Now this piece of paper in my hand was a speech<br />
which was written to give to you, but it appears to be not much use<br />
to me now because the Mayor has said practically everything that<br />
was written in it except for that bit about bikinis: Consequently,<br />
it has been necessary for me to make a few rough notes while<br />
listening to the Mayor. So what I have to say to you will not be as<br />
polished as it otherwise might be, but nevertheless it will be<br />
sincerely meant and felt.<br />
I should tell you, however, that very frequently on<br />
0 these occasions I am so happy to reach the end of a speech perhaps<br />
not as happy as those who listen to it: that I sometimes forget<br />
whatever it is that I am supposed to be opening. I hope that won't<br />
0 happen on this occasion, but if it should the thing is open nevertheless.<br />
I am told when this happens, a gun is going to go off immediately<br />
and people are going to dive off the towers but I am assured there<br />
will be blank shells in the gun.<br />
Now, Sir, we have here a fine example of local<br />
government action. You mentioned, Sir, and brought back to my<br />
mind, that too many people thought of local government as being<br />
merely occupied with building roads or collecting rubbish, and it<br />
did remind me of a true story.<br />
Many years ago, the little daughter of some friends<br />
of mine came back from a walk and said: " Yesterday when we<br />
passed the corner there was a dead dog on it, but today when we<br />
passed it had gone because Pranci Proconsul had taken it away.<br />
Now, the child's parents were a little bemused at this because the<br />
introduction of this matter with rather obscure religious overtones<br />
was not at once clear to them. But it became clear the next day when<br />
a little more investigation disclosed that Pranci Proconsul was in<br />
fact the Prahran City Council. But we know, Sir, that they do far<br />
more than that and this is visual evidence of it, because there is<br />
history repeating itself. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I was surprised at the number of hands that went up<br />
for people who had been here when the first opening took place, an<br />
opening of a pool which was then a trendsetter 42 years ago and which<br />
is now being followed by a complex of pools which I am told are the<br />
finest in the Southern Hemisphere and if anybody wants to deny that<br />
I am quite prepared to have an argument about it. They really are<br />
a magnificent complex and they retain the trees and general park-like<br />
approach, which is so necessary for functions of this kind.<br />
How proud the late Prime Minister, who represented<br />
the city of Malvern in the electorate of Higgins in the Federal<br />
Parliament with such distinction for so long, how proud he would be<br />
to have his name associated with this facility provided for the people<br />
of Malvern and how he would hope, as I hope, that whereas 42 years<br />
ago there were few, comparatively few, who could swim, today there<br />
is a generation, more and more of whom are able to swim. Partly,<br />
I think in this instance, this has been due to the work of the lifesaving<br />
association formed here and in other centres throughout Australia.<br />
The nation should take this business of swimming very<br />
seriously. We are blessed in every State with some of the best ocean<br />
beaches in the world, and we have such swimming facilities as these<br />
at rivers and lakes throughout our country. Yet far too often there are<br />
reports of boating accidents in which somebody has been drowned<br />
because they could not swim. This should not happen in a country<br />
like Australia. Sir, I think in providing facilities such as this and<br />
by the work citizens are putting into teaching children to swim in<br />
facilities such as this, we are on the way to seeing that all can swim.<br />
Harold Holt, that fine swimmer himself, a man who<br />
kept fit and encouraged others to keep fit would be pleased to have<br />
not only his name associated with this complex, but be delighted at<br />
the possibilities which this complex opens up for fitness and for<br />
teaching children to swim.<br />
Sir, I think I have said all I would wish to say. I now<br />
declare this swimming complex to be open. </p>
