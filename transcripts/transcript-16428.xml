    <content><![CDATA[<p>I acknowledge the First Australians on whose land we meet and whose culture we celebrate as one of the oldest continuing cultures in human history.</p>
<p>If you have heard the stories of those who have suffered from chronic diseases, and been given the gift of life through a transplant  - </p>
<p>Or if you have heard the stories of the families for whom a donor organ never arrived in time  - </p>
<p>You can be in no doubt this is a cause that really matters.</p>
<p>It's a cause worth fighting for.</p>
<p>There is no question that Australia delivers excellent clinical outcomes for transplant patients.</p>
<p>But our donor rates are too low.</p>
<p>And the Australian Government is determined to change that.</p>
<p>So that instead of lagging behind other nations, Australia can be a leader in organ and tissue donation and transplantation.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how important this is, just look into the eyes of my 2 year old friend who is here today, Cordelia Whatman, the thankful recipient of a liver transplant.</p>
<p>Or her 4 year old sister, Octavia, who is nearly big enough and old enough to be made an ambassador for organ donor awareness.</p>
<p>Or speak to 8 year old Taleaha and 4 year old Rory here, whose mum Kylie is waiting for a double lung transplant.</p>
<p>Australia has a transplant waiting list of around 1,800 people.</p>
<p>That is 1,800 Cordelias and Kylies.</p>
<p>1,800 Australians for whom a transplant may be the difference between a normal, healthy life and debilitating chronic illness.</p>
<p>We're here today for them  -  and for thousands more Australians, in the years ahead, whose lives will be changed by an organ or tissue transplant.</p>
<p>In July last year, I said national leadership to lift organ donation rates was long overdue.</p>
<p>I said it was time to end the blame game between different levels of government and different parts of the health system.</p>
<p>I said we needed to take action, and focus our efforts in the places where we can actually get results.</p>
<p>That is why the Government is investing an unprecedented $151.1 million over the next four years to reform the national organ and tissue donation system and save lives.</p>
<p>The plan was endorsed by all State and Territory governments on July 3 last year at the Council of Australian Governments meeting.</p>
<p>That plan centres on taking action where it matters most  -  in our hospitals.</p>
<p>The plan aims to ensure that:</p>
<p>     * potential donors are properly identified at hospitals across the country;</p>
<p>     * every family of a potential donor will be asked about organ donation;</p>
<p>     * a dedicated specialist will work with the potential donor and their family to provide support through what is often a very, very difficult process;</p>
<p>     * hospital staff will be able to focus on donor care knowing that the hospital has a separate budget to cover organ and tissue donation;</p>
<p>     * families receive the support they need at the time of organ donation and afterwards; and</p>
<p>     * there will be an equitable and safe process for managing transplant waiting lists and allocating organs once they become available.</p>
<p>There are five components to the national plan I announced in July last year.</p>
<p>The first component is $46 million to introduce a coordinated, consistent approach under the leadership of a new, independent national authority - the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority.</p>
<p>The legislation for the new Authority went through Parliament last September, and it is now up and running.</p>
<p>It is led by Karen Murphy, an experienced CEO with a proven track record of successfully managing change in large organisations and working collaboratively across both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Under her leadership, the Authority is working quickly to build its capacity and implement this ambitious reform agenda.</p>
<p>Our plan also allocates $67 million to employ trained medical specialists and other staff dedicated to organ donation.</p>
<p>They will work closely with emergency department and intensive care unit teams in selected public and private hospitals across Australia.</p>
<p>The third element is $17 million in new funding for hospitals to meet additional staffing, bed and infrastructure costs associated with organ donation.</p>
<p>The fourth component is $13 million towards raising community awareness and building public confidence in Australia's donation for a transplantation system.</p>
<p>The fifth component is funding of $2 million for counsellors to support donor families.</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive plan.</p>
<p>It tackles the point at which our organ donor system is currently failing - where we need dedicated staff in emergency wards and intensive care units, trained to help families through the difficult circumstances they confront just at the time when getting consent matters.</p>
<p>It was developed on the basis of evaluating international experience  -  evidence that highlighted the need for national leadership, and the need for dedicated specialist staff.</p>
<p>Today I announce the next step in implementing the national plan.</p>
<p>For the Authority's efforts to be as successful as possible, it needs to get the best advice  -  both from within the medical community and from a wide range of community voices.</p>
<p>We know that we need to engage with the wider community so that more Australians understand just what a gift of life organ donation can be. </p>
<p>That is why we will establish an Advisory Council - to provide ongoing advice and input to the Authority.</p>
<p>The Advisory Council will consist of members selected on the basis of substantial experience or knowledge in at least one of the following fields:</p>
<p>     * organ or tissue donation and transplantation; </p>
<p>     * public administration; </p>
<p>     * business; </p>
<p>     * management; </p>
<p>     * finance and </p>
<p>     * health consumer issues.</p>
<p>I'm pleased today to announce that Sam Chisholm will chair the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>Sam Chisholm is one of the most experienced hands in the Australian business community  -  most famously as the Chief Executive and Managing Director who led the Nine Network through the many years when it dominated Australian television ratings.</p>
<p>If anybody knows how to get Australians to watch and listen, Sam does.</p>
<p>Sam is also the recipient of a double lung transplant in 2003.</p>
<p>He's also been a director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute.</p>
<p>So he will bring to this role the same grit and passion he's famously demonstrated throughout his professional life.</p>
<p>Sam will be supported by the following members of the Advisory Council:</p>
<p>     * Professor John Horvath AO, the Chief Medical Officer</p>
<p>     * Dr David Boadle, Tasmania's Deputy Chief Health Officer</p>
<p>     * Prof Don Chalmers, Dean of the Law Faculty at the University of Tasmania with expertise in health law and ethics</p>
<p>     * Ms Anne Cahill Lambert AM, a tireless advocate in this area waiting herself for a double lung transplant; also a former CEO of the Royal Australian College of Medical Administrators and former CEO of the Women's Hospitals Australasia and the Children's Hospitals Australasia</p>
<p>     * Professor Geoff Dobb, head of the Royal Perth Hospital's Department of Intensive Care with expertise in brain death and organ donation</p>
<p>     * David Koch  -  Kochie has of course done a huge amount to promote donor awareness on the Sunrise program and brings business and financial expertise</p>
<p>     * Professor Jeremy Chapman OAM  -  one of Australia's most highly experienced transplant specialists and a clinical professor at the University of Sydney</p>
<p>     * Mrs Rachel Martin, donor family member </p>
<p>     * Dr Marisa Herson, head of Victoria's Donor Tissue Bank</p>
<p>     * Dr Anthony Cross, emergency physician and intensivist at the Box Hill Hospital</p>
<p>     * Dr Gerry O'Callaghan  -  Senior Consultant, Intensive and Critical Care, Flinders Medical Centre</p>
<p>     * Ms Amanda Rischbeith  -  National President of the Australian College of Critical Care Nurses</p>
<p>     * Dr Dianne Stephens OAM  -  Director of Intensive Care at the Royal Darwin Hospital</p>
<p>     * Professor Russell Strong AC  -  Medical Director, Queenslanders Donate</p>
<p>These members give the Council a tremendous depth of skill expertise ranging across critical care, transplantation, the medical and nursing professions, donor families, transplant recipients and those on the waiting list.</p>
<p>I want to thank each Council member for taking on this responsibility.</p>
<p>Your advice will be important to making the national plan successful.</p>
<p>Progress on the national plan is also advancing in other areas as the Authority begins taking the practical steps that will help get the results to which we are committed.</p>
<p>Health Ministers have agreed to the implementation of national âclinical triggers' across all public and private hospital Emergency Departments and Intensive Care Units.</p>
<p>These clinical triggers will help clinicians on the ground to rapidly and accurately identify potential donors.</p>
<p>Consultations with the medical professions are now underway.</p>
<p>The Authority is also working to implement the new National Paired Kidney Exchange Program.</p>
<p>This will help link potential donors to recipients across the country, where a family member or friend who is willing to donate is not compatible.</p>
<p>The Organ Donor Awareness Week is an excellent opportunity to raise awareness and get the message about Cordelia, Kylie and thousands of other Australians.</p>
<p>So I am pleased to launch this week's efforts.</p>
<p>And I am particularly pleased to be launching the Terry Connolly ORGANised Walk that will set off at 7am tomorrow from Regatta Point.</p>
<p>This is a great initiative to encourage people to talk with their families about registering for organ donation.</p>
<p>Helen reminds me that it was Terry who, back in the 1980s while I was in China, made sure that my ALP party membership dues were processed and kept in order.</p>
<p>And it was also Terry who recruited the Deputy Prime Minister to the Labor Party on campus at the University of Adelaide in the 1970s.</p>
<p>We will be walking tomorrow in memory of Terry, and in support of increased donor awareness.</p>
<p>The success of this week's efforts is important to increasing donor levels and achieving the vision that is behind Australia's national plan for organ donation.</p>
<p>Let me finish with this appeal to all Australians.</p>
<p>Take action and have a meaningful and informed discussion with your family about your wishes in relation to organ and tissue donation.</p>
<p>If you are not now on the organ donor list, please think about it and get your name on to it.</p>
<p>And I appeal to the nation's media: tell the stories of organ donation and the gift of life it can be.</p>
<p>These stories get people thinking and acting.</p>
<p>They really make a difference.</p>
<p>Each of us can play a role in this great cause.</p>
<p>And many Australians will enjoy happier, longer lives as a result. </p>
