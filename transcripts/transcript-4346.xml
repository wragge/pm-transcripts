ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Federal Government this week announced that the two and a<br />
quarter rili on Australians who receive pensions or benefits<br />
will i-eceive increased payments in May. Single pensioners will<br />
receive a $ 3.60 a week rise and a pensioner married couple will<br />
receive a $ 6.00 a week increase. This means that the max: i. mim<br />
standard pension rate becomes $ 47.10 a week, while the maximum<br />
married rate becomes $ 78.50 a week. Repatriation pensions in<br />
all categories also will be increased by the same rate.<br />
The decision honours our often stated commitment that: increases<br />
in the Consumer Price Index will be automatically passed on to<br />
pensioners. The increases that come into effect from May<br />
represent the full percentage flow-on from the last two<br />
Consumer Price Index increases.<br />
In my Policy Speech prior to the Election, I said that " the<br />
real value of pensions will be preserved." Clearly, we have<br />
done just that. Since we'took office, the total increase in<br />
the standard pension has been $ 8.35 a week an increase of<br />
21.5%. The total increase in the combined married pension has<br />
been $ 12 a week.<br />
We are committed to protect pensioners' pensions against<br />
inflation. We are committed to take politics out of pension<br />
increases by giving automatic increases in line with price rises<br />
twice each year. Our actions have firmly demonstrated that we<br />
are honouring that commitment.<br />
The Department of Social Security carries out vital programmes<br />
the extent and significance of which are often missed. The<br />
budget allocation for this financial year for the payments of<br />
social security pensions is 32% more than actual expenditure<br />
in 1975/ 76. In 1976 there were an estimated 1.9 million<br />
pensioners and beneficiaries receiving assistance through the<br />
Dapartmen-: f Social Security. There are 1.7 million pension<br />
and benefi-c-ieques issued each fortnight. The estimated<br />
expenditure each fortnight on pensions and benefits is<br />
$ 140 Over a full year the Department issues more<br />
than 66 -illion cheques. For this financial year the estimated<br />
total e-.:: di: ure by the Department is $ 5,580 million that<br />
represa:. s almost half of income tax receipts from individuals. / In view </p>
<p>2<br />
In view of our expenditure commitment in this vital area, the<br />
Government is paying attention to making sure that the community<br />
gets the best possible value from outlay. We are determined that<br />
our welfare programires are directed to people in real need. We<br />
are determined to make sure that the social security administration<br />
is both efficient and sensitive to the needs of individuals.<br />
The Government also moved last year to make many more people<br />
eligible for the pension. The Government gave an undertaking<br />
that it would m ove towards replacing means tests with an income<br />
test, so that those who had saved would not be penalised. The<br />
Government saw this as an opportunity to eliminate much administrative<br />
complexity.<br />
Effective from 11. November 1976 the Government abolished the<br />
separate property component in the means test for pensioners.<br />
The Government's decision followed the lines adopted by Professor<br />
Henderson in his first main report on poverty in which he said:<br />
" The. existing means test which determines eligibility includes a<br />
treatment of ;', sets which is a relic of far less generous days."<br />
He recommende ; hat the treatment of asset incomes for pension<br />
purposes shou, be no different from other incomes. We agreed,<br />
and acted accordingly.<br />
These measures along with the Government's three year pro-ramnme<br />
for aged or disabled persons accommodation and senior citizen<br />
centres are the clearest possible demonstration of this<br />
Government's desire to assist those in need. Our social welfare<br />
policy seeks to enhance the security, dignity, self-reliance and<br />
well-being of Australians. We have put these words into positive<br />
action for the benefit of millions of Australians. 0 </p>
