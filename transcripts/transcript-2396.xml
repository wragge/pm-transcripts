COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
FUTURE OF AUSTRALIAN FORCES IN VIETNAM<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ Froin the ' Parliamentary Debates', 30 March 19711<br />
Mr MeMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)-<br />
by leave-Mr Speaker, the Government<br />
has been reviewing the position of<br />
Australia's military forces in Vietnam in<br />
order to determine what further withdrawal<br />
options are open to it, having<br />
regard to the security situation and the<br />
intentions of the Government of the<br />
Republic of Vietnam and of our other<br />
major allies. This review follows from the<br />
policy stated by the then Prime Minister,<br />
now the Minister for Defence ( Mr Gorton),<br />
in April 1970 when, in announcing<br />
the withdrawal of one Army battalion, he<br />
said that ' Should the progress of pacification<br />
and Vietnramisation succeed as the<br />
President ( of the United States) : hopes and<br />
believes that it will, then at some stage<br />
during the 12 months period we will consider<br />
phasing additional troops into the<br />
planned withdrawal'.<br />
During his recent visit to Vietnam, the<br />
Minister for Defence had valuable discussions<br />
with Vietnamese leaders and with the<br />
Commander of United States forces in<br />
Vietnam. These consultations have<br />
confirmed our assessment that steady<br />
improvement is being achieved in the security<br />
situation. Many factors have contributed<br />
to this improvement. The policy of<br />
Vietnamisation, that is, the development of<br />
the capability and effectiveness of South<br />
Vietnam's armed forces, has produced a<br />
much stronger and more cohesive fighting<br />
11941171 force. The pacification programme has also<br />
achieved notable successes, and its contribution<br />
towards improved security in the<br />
rural areas has necessitated the enemy concentrating<br />
his effort against that program-<br />
ne. These developments, in combirvalion<br />
with North Vietnam's manpower<br />
problems, have seen a significant decline in<br />
enemy-initiated activity over the last 2<br />
years. An important consequence of these<br />
achievements has been that the South Vietnamese<br />
have been able to continue their<br />
operations in Cambodia against North<br />
Vietnamese regular forces. Additionally<br />
they were able to initiate and conduct the<br />
recent operations against the North Vietnamese<br />
supply lines in southern Laos. The<br />
effect of these operations so far has been<br />
to -prevent the enemy mounting large-scale<br />
actions inside South Vietnam and thus they<br />
have given the South Vietnamese time for<br />
the further development of their forces<br />
and for strengthening the pacification programme.<br />
In a number of key areas within<br />
South Vietnam the North Vietnamese have<br />
for the present lost the military initiative.<br />
Tihe enemy forces are thus being forced to<br />
a position of reacting to the South Vietnamese<br />
rather than being able to fight at a<br />
time and place of their own choosing.<br />
Turning to the overall security of South<br />
Vietnam, it is undeniable that there has<br />
been satisfactory progress towards the </p>
<p>objective of establishing the circumstances<br />
in which South Vietnam can determine its<br />
own future. There remain, of course,<br />
difficulties which should not be minimised.<br />
The North Vietnamese at the Paris talks<br />
have remained intransigent. Nothing constructive<br />
has been offered by them towards<br />
a negotiated settlement. In Vietnam itself<br />
there has been some resurgence in Communist<br />
terrorism, political agitation, and<br />
attacks against lines of communication.<br />
These tactics by the Communists, using<br />
their remaining infrastructure in the<br />
country, will doubtless be employed<br />
against the Government and people for<br />
some time to come.<br />
In . its weighing up of the overall situation,<br />
the Government has decided that further<br />
reductions of the Australian forces in<br />
Vietnam are feasible and desirable. With<br />
the agreement of the Government of the<br />
Republic of Vietnam, and following consultations<br />
with United States military authorities<br />
in Saigon, some forces will now be<br />
withdrawn. These are:<br />
Selected combat and supporting forces<br />
of the Army task force, including the<br />
tank squadron, totalling about 650<br />
men;<br />
Royal Australian Navy personnel, a out<br />
in number, serving with the United<br />
-States Assault Helicopter Company;<br />
The RAN Clearance Diving Team<br />
( clearance of underwater explosives)<br />
of 6 personnel;<br />
No. 2 Canberra Bomber Squadron<br />
involving 280 men;<br />
Some aircraft of the Caribou transport<br />
squadron and about 44 men.<br />
The reductions are therefore to be<br />
spread over the 3 Services and will have<br />
the effect of reducing the total Australian<br />
personnel by about 1,000 men. The Australian<br />
forces then remaining in South<br />
Vietnam will comprise 6,000 men compared<br />
with a peak of 8,000 in 1968-70. All<br />
these remaining forces, including the 2-battalion<br />
Task Force in Phuoc Tuy, will<br />
retain an effective operational capability.<br />
The tasks of our forces will continue to<br />
change as the Vietnamese territorial forces<br />
accept increased operational responsibility.<br />
The units and personnel involved in these reductions will be withdrawn gradually<br />
over a period of 4 months to 6 months,<br />
commencing in May. This timetable will<br />
permit detailed adjustments to be made<br />
between the Australian, South Vietnamese,<br />
and United States military authorities in<br />
relation to the security requirements of the<br />
areas involved.<br />
Events in South Vietnam, to which our<br />
own fighting men made such a notable<br />
contribution, have made these withdrawals<br />
possible and they are entirely in accordance<br />
with the policy of the Government<br />
as announced in Parliament. It must be<br />
acknowledged that enemy forces in Indo-<br />
China still retain a consid. rable offensive<br />
capability, and there remains in South<br />
Vietnam a structure of Vietcong cadres<br />
and guerillas which has been long established<br />
and whose strength is very difficult<br />
to assess. No doubt the Government and<br />
forces of the Republic may from time to<br />
time suffer military setbacks, and the continuance<br />
of the war against aggression will<br />
be a heavy burden upon them. But perhaps<br />
more than ever before, the ( Government of<br />
the Republic acknowledges that getting on<br />
top of the internal threat to security and<br />
the development of progressive government<br />
in the provinces are tasks best performed<br />
by themselves once a sufficient degree of<br />
security from massive external attack has<br />
been established. Greater confidence now<br />
exists. The Vietnamese authorities have<br />
developed a variety of programmes which<br />
are becoming increasingly effective in<br />
bringing better administration in the countryside.<br />
The Australian Government will<br />
continue to assist the Republic of Vietnam,<br />
though the character of our assistance will<br />
progressively change. For example, the<br />
new Jungle Warfare Training Centre at<br />
Nui Dat has just completed its first course.<br />
Australian economic and military aid in a<br />
variety of forms will continue. We will<br />
continue to build houses for members of<br />
the Territorial Forces and their families.<br />
Other forms of civil aid and civic action<br />
will be examined by the Government. As<br />
to the future of our forces in Vietnam, the<br />
Government will keep the matter under<br />
constant review, bearing in mind the security<br />
of our own forces and our obligations<br />
to the Government of the Republic of<br />
Vietnam.<br />
