YOUNG LIBERALS' CONVENTION<br />
SURFERS' PARADISE, OLD.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon William McMahon CHMP<br />
11 February,_ 1972<br />
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I want to talk to you today about three thingsfirst<br />
the economy second the role the Government has to playand<br />
third the Liberal Party.<br />
I realise you have dealt with these subjects in<br />
one form or another during your Convention. However, I want to<br />
give you the Government' s view because we are immediately concerned<br />
with decision-making on these matters of direct concern to us all.<br />
This is election year. And a year where we have<br />
inherited problems from the past, many of them not directly within<br />
our control, and also commu~ on to most industrialised countries<br />
throughout the world. They are our problems, however, and we are<br />
at grips with them. They are well-known to you all. There is inflation.<br />
It continues to threaten us and, so far as it is in the Government's<br />
power to do so, our measures to contain it must be constantly under<br />
review and flexible in their application.<br />
There is unemployment, which is the cause of<br />
considerable public anxiety, though by world standards the level<br />
is low, and it is by no means chronic.<br />
No matter what a Government does its efforts will be<br />
aborted unless there is confidence on the part of the public,<br />
business and industry, and, I emphasise, the Trade Union movement.<br />
I am well aware that there is some lack of confidence, we in the<br />
Government are as sensitive to this as we are to the root causes<br />
inflation and unemployment. We are doing everything in our power to correct this<br />
and what we are doing is dictated entirely by the national interest<br />
In other words, we are not looking at it from the point of view that<br />
this is aA election year. We are not looking at it from the point<br />
of view that there might be some very favourable signs and some that<br />
are unfavourable. We are looking at it in order to ensure that<br />
immediate and the long-term public interests receive paramount<br />
concern. There are, with all this, a number of encouraging signs.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>4 </p>
<p>In the long-term, of course, our prospects are<br />
excellent. Even the Jeremiahs concede that. Our international<br />
situation is very sound both in terms of trade and financial<br />
resources. And we are showing strength and steady growth on the<br />
domestic front. But it is the immediate problems that are commanding<br />
public attention in Australia today, as you so well know. We have<br />
to make sure that growth continues while we apply remedies to our<br />
immediate problems. We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater.<br />
This, therefore, is a time for carefully-considered<br />
decisions, taking both the immediate and long-term situations into<br />
account. There is absolutely no cause and no need to press the<br />
panic button now. That, briefly, is the position in Australia today.<br />
Now about the Government's role. We are tackling<br />
the causes of inflation at every point we can. Inflation I want to<br />
assure you, has been largely caused directly and indirectly by<br />
excessive wage claims and wage rises in Australia. It is no good<br />
putting blinkers on about this problem.<br />
If you don't get a lift in productivity when you get<br />
wage increases, then you are bound to got inflation no matter what<br />
action the Government night take, and we haven't been getting a lift<br />
sufficient to cushion the impact of those wage rises. On top of<br />
that, industrial disputes and lawlessness, and political strikes, are<br />
making the problem a great deal worse. But I can illustrate this<br />
in a few sentences. The total man days lost was 2,877,000 compared<br />
to 2,283,000 last year. To give another example of what disputes are<br />
costing the wage earner himself, the total loss in wages for the<br />
first eleven months of 1971 was $ 43 million, compared with $ 29 million<br />
for the corresponding period of the previous year.<br />
Look at the trouble in the Post Office, look at the<br />
trouble we now have with the S. E. C. in Victoria. Having said this,<br />
I think you are entitled to ask: What is the Government doing about<br />
it? What can the Government do? And what sort of leadership is it<br />
providing. most people don't rea~ lise and I want to stress this to<br />
Young Liberals that one of the impediments we have is that, under<br />
our own constitution, the Government is very limited constitutionally<br />
in the action it can take.<br />
Nevertheless, time and time again, we have sounded<br />
the warning thiat excessive wage increases must be resisted by<br />
Governments, by wage-fixing tribunals and Private employers and<br />
that the Arbitration Court must take into account the national<br />
interest and ability to pay. We have intervened in the national wage<br />
cases and will continue to do so. This is a positive contribution to<br />
the task of getting all the facts, the most important facts, on a<br />
national scale before the Arbitration Commission. And we are<br />
determined that a $ tate of full employment will be achieved and<br />
maintained. ./ 3 </p>
<p>I </p>
<p>The Government undertook at Budget time last year<br />
to keep the economy constantly under review, to be flexible and act<br />
promptly in response to trends and movements. This we have done.<br />
We made a review in October/ November. In December we decided to<br />
review the economy again in January. This we have done and Cabinet<br />
has discussed the results fully in recent days.<br />
We have made and announced various decisions, as you<br />
know, particularly on monetary matters, as a result of which interest<br />
rates on Government Bonds have been substantially reduced, and, of<br />
course, the maximum overdraft rate his also been reduced.<br />
There are now some indications that some interest<br />
rates in the private sector are starting to fall. Just two other<br />
examples of action we have taken<br />
We made a special interest free capital grant of<br />
million to the States for the building of primary<br />
and secondary Schools and<br />
We limited the -migrant inflow during the period when<br />
school-leavers would be coming on to the labour<br />
market. In recent months we have also intervened in other<br />
significant cases before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,<br />
with some effect, as in the annual leave case. These interventions<br />
included the carpDenters, bank officers and the Victorian Electricity<br />
Commission cases. Much of this has largely escaped public notice but<br />
I believe these actions show decisiveness and leadership on our part.<br />
We have always insisted that the Arbitration system must be preserved.<br />
Generally it has served us well since Federation. If it is<br />
weakened or destroyed by pressure tactics from anyone, then both the<br />
boss and the working man will really be in trouble. We insist that<br />
industrial disputes must be settled by Conciliation and arbitration.<br />
You will understand that I cannot go into details of<br />
our latest review as I am to meet the State Premiers next week and<br />
we will takre a number of decisions which will. be important for the<br />
future. But I want to say this. The Government has acted<br />
deliberately, and I believe sensibly, to demonstrate flexibility in<br />
its management of the economy. It will continue to do so.<br />
My Governm1ent is concerned to see that a State of<br />
full employment is maintained. I am confident that the immediate<br />
pressures can be eased off if there is a concerted community effort<br />
to face up squarely to the problems of the day. The employment<br />
position, no matter what the underlying trends are, can be seriously<br />
compromised by prolonged and unnecessary industrial stoppages, of<br />
the kind which is being experienced in Victoria and which is<br />
forcing employers to stand down a large part of the work force. The<br />
current level of registered unemployment in Australia is 1.6 per<br />
cen~ t of the labour force, after adjusting for normal seasonal<br />
influences. </p>
<p>This is a little higher than the average level of<br />
1.4 per cent achieved over the last fifteen years but it is still<br />
very low by world standards. Australians have come to expect very<br />
high rates of employment and my Government is determined that this<br />
expectation will be fulfilled. There is no reason at all why anyone<br />
should join the " disaster lobby" and become crepe-hangers and<br />
mourners about something that hasn't happened.<br />
We are determined to continue to give leadership<br />
in economic management. And are confident that the inherent<br />
strength of the economy will show itself increasingly as the year<br />
goes by. We will continue to take prompt action to anticipate and<br />
deal with specific conditions as trends develop.<br />
There is good news today as well as bad. The bad<br />
news must not be swept under the carpet. It must not be concealed.<br />
But neither should the good news. When the number of days lost by<br />
strikes goes down, when productivity -goes up then let the story<br />
be told. When wool goes up as it has. When the stock market liftsas<br />
it has when companies show better trading and increased profits<br />
as many are then let that story be told too. This is the way to<br />
sustain confidence, encourage develop ment, create more employment<br />
and take us forward to better days.<br />
Despite all the difficulties we have had in the past<br />
year the Government has made a great deal of progress on a wide<br />
front. Time doesn't permit me to give you a list of many of the<br />
things we've done, but I leave with you a paper which records in somie<br />
detail our decisions and achievements from March of last year to date.<br />
There are pages of it.<br />
And in the first month of this year we have already<br />
announced An important decision on bond and interest rates.<br />
A new deal for our aboriginal citizens.<br />
A major re-organisation of the Army and other<br />
defence developments.<br />
A decision to make Australian pensions payable<br />
overseas. A decision to make Government papers and Cabinet<br />
records available sooner to the public.<br />
And there's more to come.<br />
Now about the Liberal Party. First of all your<br />
Conference. I am delighted to hear from those who have been here<br />
throughout the Convention that you have really been getting down<br />
to things. </p>
<p>You have:-demonstrated in the most vigorous way your<br />
loyalty to the Party, your concern for the future of Australia,<br />
your interest in the well-being of the Australian people and your<br />
determination to help us win the election. I congratulate you and<br />
I thank you. For my part let me assure you the Parliamentary<br />
Party is in good shape and so is the Government. We are a good<br />
team pulling well together and we are going to win the next<br />
election. I have had talks with the Liberal Party's Federal<br />
Policy Committee in Canberra this week, and I think you'll find<br />
we'll have a first-class, forward looking, refreshing election<br />
policy for the Electorate. A number of Party Committees have been<br />
busy for several months overhauling all aspects of Party pclicy and<br />
they've done a good job. I am sure that relations between the<br />
Parliamentary Party and the Liberal Party Organisation have never<br />
been better. One can look at an election two ways. You can<br />
mention the risk of losing, to prod the faint hearts into action,<br />
or you can make up your mind you are going to win and get that<br />
message across loud and clear. That's the way I prefer to do it.<br />
In the months -that remain before the Poll we have<br />
to make a concerted effort to strip the mask off the Lebor Policy<br />
and its pretensions, so that our policies can be judged on their<br />
merits against theirs. We can best do this by putting our whole<br />
effort into our own performance as a Party and a partner in<br />
Government. Don't believe the rubbish you hear ." that we've been<br />
on the Government Benches a long time and that's good enough reason<br />
for a change." It's good enough reason to stay. The record of<br />
achievement during our 22 years of office has-been remarkably good<br />
and the Australian people like the way we do it. But again, don't<br />
be complacent. We mustn't take it easy. There's too much that's<br />
new going on all around the world and yesterday's iiet isn't always<br />
the best for tomorrow. I belive Liberalism has its greatest opportunities<br />
-ahead of it in this decade of the seventies.<br />
