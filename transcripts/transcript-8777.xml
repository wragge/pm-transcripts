TRANSCRIPT OF THE PIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRESS CONFElRENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
18 DECEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM; I would just like to make a fcw basic points about Dr Hewson's speech today. I<br />
think the first thing I would like to say is that you just can't believe him. He said<br />
he would rcsign if Fightback was changed, hc now said he will resign if he<br />
changes it back.<br />
Obviously his performnance today was of a person jolted by the fact that he was<br />
saying things that he didn't believe. lHe didn't believe them, the audience who was<br />
listening to him didn't believe them, I am quite sure that the press gallcry didn't<br />
believe them, I didn't believe them, but I think what showed most particularly is<br />
that he didn't believe them. I think what we arc seeing is somecone who made it<br />
impossible for Australians to believe him as well.<br />
What Dr Hewsons proposed today, he said the integrity of Fightback will always<br />
be preserved irrespective of whatever wc decide to do. I think that just about said<br />
it all. Thiat is, Fightback will be preserved irrcspective of whatever we decide to<br />
do. So whatever changes he makes, whatever adjustments he makes to try and<br />
garncr some support in the community from the heartless policies he has pursued,<br />
he said we will still maintain thc integrity of Figlitback, and if that is true the<br />
essential unfairness would be maintained.<br />
So what are we left with after the presentation of Fightback Mark well for a start<br />
a 15 per cent goods and services tax, only nowv it is more complicated. He has got<br />
sonic things in and some things out. Food is out, but restaurant food is in, fast<br />
food is in, other forms of food are in. It will be just more complicated and it now<br />
raises just $ 22 billion instead of $ 27 billion. It raises nearly half t ' he income tax of<br />
Australia, it is a monster, it is still there. Zero tariffs are still there, the Jeff Kennett<br />
industrial relations policy is still there, and I noticed he even said the very same<br />
things that Mr Kennett said in his pamphlets, what you have now you will keep<br />

<p>T1E8L:. Dec. 92 18: 03 No. 031 P. 02/ 11<br />

said Mr Kennett in his pamphlet, Dr I-ewson made the same point today.<br />
billion of cuts in Government spending still there, but what is new is a huge unfurnded<br />
program in a delivery of a financial account that I would absolutely shrink<br />
from producing in public, never would I have presented as Treasurer, or as Prime<br />
Minister something so . shonky and deliberately false. All that Dr Hewson has done<br />
is add $ 5 billion in asset sales in 1993-94 and $ 5 billion in 1994-95 on top of<br />
what he already had there in the original Fightback Mark 1. So it is now a program<br />
of $ 10 billion of asset sales in 1993-94 and $ 10 billion of asset sales in 1994-95.<br />
You have got to bear in mind that at its peak the Australian capital market in 1988<br />
only funded $ 13 billion to the whole private economy of Australia. In 1991-92 it<br />
funded $ 12 billion to the whole private economy of Australia. It has all ready had<br />
problems digesting the Westpac float and the Woolworths float. He is going to<br />
have, just on the Goverinent's account alone, $ 10 billion in each year, it is<br />
impossible for the market to digest and he is going to spend $ 3 billion of those<br />
proceeds each year from it on his policies.<br />
He says he is going to have a kick start policy, he has got the so-called Ralph<br />
Committee, the rebuild Australia fund, it will be just likc the Cole Committee, it is<br />
going to receive suggestions, it will receive suggestions until the election is passed<br />
and then they will go exactly where the Cole Committee's suggestions have gone,<br />
into someone's top draw. So, the $ 3 billion of infrastructure that is going to kick<br />
the economy a long, I am quite sure that the Ralph Committee recommendations<br />
will never sec the light of day.<br />
So, the fact of the mattcr is that we have got basically a policy which is about<br />
maintaining the essential unfairness of Fightback Mark I which is going to abolish<br />
Medicare, Is going to replace it with a US style health system. I don't know<br />
whether some of you noticed in the Australian today the references from that<br />
American authority about the health system saying, the American health system is<br />
moving to bankruptcy, the Federal Coalition of Australia is trying to adopt the<br />
samc policy. Importantly, he has re-Imposed the co-payment on medical<br />
payments raising $ 450 million. So, he is not just scrapping Medicare but he has<br />
got a co-payment in there of $ 450 million.<br />
There is no guarantee that food won't be put back in after the election, no<br />
guarantec that the 15 per cent rate on the goods and servies tax won't become 17<br />
or 18 per cent, like it has in every other country. He promises to do us the favour<br />
of lifting taxcs on child care where now none exist. He said he will put a tax on<br />
child care in Fightback, now he is making a big fellow of himself telling us he will<br />
lift it when it was only lie who was going to impose it. Child care at the moment is<br />
untaxcd and the same on food, he is going to make a big fellow of himself lifting<br />
the tax on food. Food is untaxed. Now, he was going to tax it, but now he says he<br />
won't, but hie will be taxing certain sorts of food like Kentucky Fried Chicken,<br />
Macdonald's and the restaurants et cctcra. Hie said in answer to a journalist, I am<br />
not sure I have got the quotc with me, I think I have, I will find it, that he was<br />
asked about pump priming, he said, yes, this is when the Government spends a<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 18. Dec. 92 18: 03 No. 031 P. 03/ 11<br />
3<br />
wholc lot of money it doesn't have. Now I put it to you with capital raising<br />
capacity in this country of about $ 12 billion a year, does anyone seriously think<br />
that we are going to send, on thc Governments account alone, $ 10 billion of asset<br />
saics for two consecutive years, at a very time when this fellow says we need more<br />
private investment? And as you know that moncy is not going to go to pay off<br />
Governiment debt, what basically he is going to do is borrow it, take it off the<br />
market and spend it, it is just the same as a borrowing, a point I think Mr Davidson<br />
made at the press conference, which he wcll understands.<br />
So all of the prctcnce about tight economics and accounting has fallen away, we're<br />
back to the Liberals a la Howard Box Hill 1987 with a shonky set of numbers.<br />
Peacock in 1990 and now Hewson for 1993. Let me tell you what the numbers<br />
really are, if you take the asset sales and the FI3T compliance out the additions to<br />
the deficit in year one are $ 6.6 billion, in year two, and year one is 1993-94, in<br />
1994-95 $ 7.6 billion, and in 1995-96 $ 7.6 billion, and the rest of it is shonk,<br />
shonk land, shonky numbers, shonky asset sales, the market would choke on the<br />
so-called magic pudding of Telecom. There is no way this capital market can<br />
fund $ 10 billion. A program like Qantas, which the Government agreed last night,<br />
is at the outer limits of what this market can fund, this was proven with the<br />
Commonwealth Bank, it has been established this year with Westpac and<br />
Woolworths. Fancy saying we need private investment when the Government is<br />
going to soak up $ 10 billion of private sector savings in a capitalisation program<br />
like this.<br />
So, I will conclude on these notes. I thought it was a very sad performance for<br />
somcone who is making a speech, the contents of which he didn't believe, didn't<br />
believe in, and the strain of that, I think, made it a very sad performance. But that<br />
is where Dr Hewsori has taken our national politics. I told you he would. He said,<br />
I spent a year putting Fightback together, when he presented it every i was dotted<br />
and cvery t crossed he said, he then said I have presented it to the electorate for a<br />
year and everything is right about it. The first whiff of grapcshot, the first poll that<br />
really mattered, his courage fell, up went the white flag and out came the policy<br />
which is totally alien to him and to his party and worsc based on funding proposals<br />
which are a disgrace at this stage of our national economic history.<br />
3. Mr Keating, why won't you be ablc to sell Telecom to overseas carriers?<br />
PM: Let's keep it onto this for a start thanks Tomn ( Burton). I'll come back to you later<br />
on that point.<br />
J: Mr Kcating, it seems like Dr H-ewson has gone carefully through the list of all your<br />
insults about Ferraris and food and everything else, he seems to have addressed<br />
each onc of them.<br />
PM: Do you think so? </p>
<p>I U L. 4<br />
1: by changing the luxury tax on cars, by taking food off, how many insults do you<br />
have left?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of insults, no, we don't need insults to make these points. I just<br />
told you a moment ago what's there. And what is thcre is still $ 10 billion of cuts<br />
to government spending, a tax on everything except food, still going to destroy<br />
Medicare, all the nasties arc basically still there, they arc only putting off the cuts<br />
to labour inarkct programs by twelve months. Don't rely on my claims, just read<br />
the thing.'<br />
3: Mr Keating, why is your policy on kick starting the economy substantively better<br />
than what Dr Hcwson is proposing? He's arguing that regardlcss of what you think<br />
about the asset sales program, you haven't funded the kick start by anything other<br />
than borrowings.<br />
PM: I take the view that if you arc going to add a stimulus to the economy then a<br />
stimulus is a net addition to demand. But he says surely stimulatory economic<br />
policies do not work and an alternative approach is called for this is on<br />
Novembcr 24, this is less than a month ago. He's upbraiding me in the Parliament<br />
saying when 1, he sought to argue a case for stimulatory economic policies and he<br />
referts to the 1991 Budget as stimulatory he said, given that One Nation was<br />
stimulatory, and given that 1992 Budget was stimulatory, he then gocs on to say<br />
sure conomic stimulatory policies do not work and an alternative approach is<br />
called for. What we've seen today is not a refinement of Fightback, but a<br />
capitulation.<br />
1: But doesn't hie have a point though Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Just a hang on a minute, I'll come to you, you haven't got to rush me. It is a<br />
capitulation. Look, everyone of you know that he doesn't believe this, everyone of<br />
you around this table know that he doesn't believe in thcse policies. Where is our<br />
national politics getting to? He knows that, you know that. The fact is the<br />
Government has believed, as we believed in 1983-84, as we believed in 1984-85<br />
that when private sector spending was down, that lifting public demand was the<br />
way to go. And it is the way to go this year, you can see it in our national accounts<br />
two thirds of the growth that camec through a week ago on the national accounts<br />
for the quarter is from public demand. What Dr Hewson is doing is trying to<br />
change tile cast of his policy not to suit the economnic circumstance, but to suit<br />
what he is hearing in the polls and where has the kick start comne from? It comes<br />
from a committee which a business person is going to sit on, who is going to take<br />
suggestions and does anybody believe that this would be a government intent upon<br />
proposing thcse sorts of policies?<br />
1: But Mr Keating first of all you say it is a capitulation and then you say it's as big<br />
and as bad and as ugly as it ever was. You can't have it both ways.<br />

<p>TEL:<br />
PM: Because it is, it trics to do two things. No, Fm not saying it, he's saying it. He is<br />
saying the integrity of Fightback will be maintained regardless. Ho is saying that<br />
all of those basic things which rve just mentioned to you, the $ 10 billion cuts in<br />
governnment spending are to be maintained, the tariff cuts are to stay where they<br />
are, the wagc policy is to stay exactly where it is, the tax on everything but food is<br />
to be there, the destruction of Mcdicare is to continue, co-payment is to be levied,<br />
they are all there. But, he then says, but hang on, don't worry about that, its<br />
fundamental nature is going to be camouflaged by a fiscal expansion and the word<br />
listening must bc mentioned three hundred times in the text. He had the hide to<br />
say, talking about democratic processes and the community had the right to be<br />
heard, hc made a virtue of saying the community was wrong and that they needed<br />
a leader who would put the right policies into place. This is just all cynical, poll<br />
dr-iven stuff, you can see by the nature of his delivery and the nervous clapping of<br />
his Liberal supporters at the Press Club.<br />
J: But that's what you did before the One Nation Statement wasn't it Mr Keating, you<br />
went around the country, you listened to peoplc and you brought up a policy, that's<br />
what he's done..<br />
PM: No, no, but I went and listened, I said that we are going to embark upon a<br />
stimulatory policy, how best to deliver the stimulus. I listened to business about<br />
depreciation, we listened about the infrastructure program and it was very useful<br />
and the results of it, genuinely listening was there in the document. But what has<br />
he listcned to? Here's the 24th of November, less than a month ago deriding<br />
stimnulatory policies. All lie's listened to is Andrew Robb and his pollster, that's all<br />
he's listened to.<br />
Mr Keatinig, nevertheless whatcver your criticisms this obviously presents you<br />
with a more difficult political situation, do you envisage some policy response to<br />
this?<br />
PM: My first response is the one I've given. This is basicay the same policy<br />
camouflaged by the supposed notion of a stimulatory complexion that's been<br />
delivered by a supposedly caring Liberal Party which we know is a nonsense, and<br />
that the GST is morc complex and still a monstrous $ 22 billion of collect ions in<br />
size. In other words you're asking me what message I'll givc. The message is<br />
broadly the same as before except there is a fcw camouflages there now, be aware<br />
of them and understand what Dr Hewson is doing.<br />
I. rni asking you what you are going to do to try to match this policy which has<br />
given you a new political problem?<br />
PM: But you are always in the matching business, we've been in the government<br />
busines and the govcrnment..<br />
1: You matched his in One Nation. T1E8L:. Dec. 92 18: 03 No. 031 P. 05/ 11 </p>
<p>TEL: 6<br />
PM:. No, no, but the govcrnment business has paid off pretty well for us. L. ast night we<br />
were govcrnig, we saw a quite mammoth change to our international airline<br />
system last night. This government has been continuing to make changes right<br />
through the course of this year and for the next term of its governent, the<br />
government will announce appropriate policy changes and settings which we're<br />
already in the course of considering.<br />
J. Mr Keating, Dr Hewson is now offering tax cuts for low to middle income earners<br />
which arc much more substantial than those being offered by the government.<br />
PM: We don't have GST Laura ( Tingle), that's why. We don't need to compensate<br />
people for a tax we are not going to apply.<br />
J: So you still think you can justify the tax cuts which arc basically aimed at higher<br />
Income earners in the One Nation package?<br />
PM: No, no there are people on two thirds of average weekly earnings $ 20,500.<br />
Average weekly earnings is around $ 30,000, therc's two thirds of AWE and we are<br />
taking the rate down from 38 to<br />
3: Do you rulc out bringing it forward?<br />
PM: Yes, but let me just remind you, who lifted the tax free threshold to $ 5,400 from<br />
$ 4,900? Who cut the bottom rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent? The<br />
Government. And did we ever get any support from the Opposition when we were<br />
doing it? No way. Who put in the Family Allowance Supplement? You know<br />
what hc says, giving is thc sort of compassion that suffocates, this fellow has no<br />
clothes whatsoever when it comes to support for low income people.<br />
1: Mr Keating, do you rule out bringing your tax cuts forward?<br />
PM: Yes. Michelle ( Grattan) I had the plcasure of delivering sixteen economic<br />
statements on behalf of the Government. They had in terms of their figuring and<br />
their deliverability, in terms of tax changes and policy changes a tightness that<br />
we've never had before in Australian public life. We've done that again in the One<br />
Nation package arnd we have been so precise about our commitments we put the<br />
changes through, the compliance changes to the fringe benefits tax so as our<br />
starting points would be within acceptable ranges. Here's this person, Dr Hewson<br />
adding $ 6.6 billion, $ 7.6 billion and $ 7.6 billion to the starting point deficits,<br />
saying don't worry we've got a shonky asset sales program, it's going to raise<br />
billion a year. You say is that right Dr Hewson? What is the maximum raisings in<br />
the private equity market of Australia? Oh $ 12 billion, so you're going to add ten<br />
to the twelve. T1E8L:. Dec.' 92 18: 03 No. 031 P. 06/ 11 </p>

3: You'd sell a lot of Telccom through trade Sales Mr Keating, you know that the Us<br />
carriers and other will be very interested.<br />
PM: We are not selling Telecom. We've got a competitive model.<br />
J: privatised asset..<br />
PM: Let Dr Hewson say that the major Australian carrier is going to be sold to a<br />
foreigner, Ict him say so if that's what hie mnics.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, what he's saying is this will be raised in floats. That's what he's making clear<br />
here.<br />
J: asset sales.<br />
. PM; No, he quotes McCaughan, up the back, talking about how much the Australian<br />
capital market raised. " The capacity of the Australian equity market", page<br />
" should comfortably cope with accumulative equity raising of around $ 12-15<br />
billion". In other words, he's talking about the capacity of the domestic markets to<br />
absorb these, not the foreign markets.<br />
1: They arc going to sell some of it by trade sale.<br />
PM: Maybe they could scll a bit of it by trade sale, but they won't sell the bulk of it by<br />
trade sale. The thing is, does anybody think when the Commonwealth Bank<br />
came along, which was what, $ 1.5 billion, the market digested it but only just<br />
digested it. The underwriters were telling me at the time the market may not be<br />
able to digest this. Woolworthis pulled its float because it didn't think the market<br />
could digest it. Do you really think there's any credibility in these numbers, that<br />
we're going to have an asset sales government programi of around $ 10 billion?<br />
Really.<br />
J1: Mr Keating, why don't you sell Telecom?<br />
PM:. No, because I think there's a place for a private carr ier in the system. We've set up<br />
a competitive model with Optus as a competitor. We're already seeing now a very<br />
large lift in productivity, a very large shift in efficiency, a very big fall in tariffs.<br />
1; What's the rationale of keeping Telecom in public hands?<br />
PM: Michelle ( Grattan), I'm not here to have an ideological discussion with you about<br />
the Govcrnment ' s view in relation to public authorities. I'm saying we're not<br />
selling Telecom. He's saying he wants to add $ 6.6 billion in the next financial<br />
year to his deficit, and $ 7.5 billion in the subsequent years, and hc wants to call the </p>
<p>TEL 8<br />
magic pudding of Telecom his way out. If you go back to Fightback Mark 1, if<br />
you look at the table on page 76 of this new document, where you see the lines<br />
$ 9.8 and $ 10.1 billion, that was formerly in the first document $ 5 and $ 5 billion.<br />
H-e's just added $ 5 billion on in two years. T7hat is, in ' 93-4 he's put another<br />
billion on. 5 billion[ I $ 5 billion half of the raisings of the total equity market<br />
and the same in ' 94-5. That is the total science of this document.<br />
I: Mr Keating, you came to office 365 days ago, do you see it as a sort of<br />
achievement that you've managed to kill off the original Fightback, or do you<br />
regret parting with it?<br />
PM: No, one of the things I said is I'd expose Fightback for what it was, and that was no<br />
answer to Australia's problems, a document laced with ideological fetishcs, that<br />
was unfair, that was inequitable, and that didn't do the right job. What Dr<br />
Hewsoii's basically adnmitted to us by this shift is that Fightback wasn't the right<br />
policy, that it was unfair and inequitable, and he sought to change it.<br />
J: Were you too successful in changing his mind because surely this is much more<br />
attrachivc to voters than the original document?<br />
PM; Some of you were telling us that it was such a good thing not so long ago.<br />
1: Mr Keating, do you think you need to take a pay cut?<br />
PM4: If ever Dr Howson had the guilts about Mr Kennctt trying to jack up Ministerial<br />
salaries and looking totally duplicitous while they were trying to cut ordinary<br />
people's wagcs and salaries, in terms of the most paltry, token things in this<br />
statement, I think that's just about got to be it. I never heard him talking about<br />
private sector salarics In the ' 80s, I didn't hear him over saying that there should be.<br />
restraints on the $ 1.5 and $ 1 million plus senior excutive salaries around the<br />
place.<br />
J. What effect will this have on your election timctable? Will it be pushing it out<br />
further?<br />
PM: That will be for mc to think about, Amanda ( Buckley), I don't know.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you're saying two slightly contradictory things herc. You're saying<br />
that you don't believe that Dr Howson actually intends spending the money<br />
through the Rcbuild Australia Fund and it will never see the light of day, but<br />
you're also accusing himt of speniding all this money at the same time.<br />
PM: Let's get this clcar. If he spends the $ 3 billion in a way which was expeditious,<br />
then the numbers upon which he is relying would basically add substantially to the<br />
Budget deficits of thc country, and in my view, would not be covered by his asset<br />
salcs program, and even if thecy are they are akin to borrowings anyway. But the<br />

<p>TEL: 18. Dec. 92 18: 03 No. 031 P. 09/ 11<br />
9<br />
notion that we're going to have a big infrastructure program delivered by courtesy<br />
of Mr Ralph's committee, I think as a notion will only last th~ rough the election<br />
period, and then I think that committee's work would be shuffled to one side like<br />
the Cole Committe.<br />
J: Do you think he can spend the money or not?<br />
PM: The thing is) in the cnd you won't know. But if one relies upon the stated intention<br />
of having a $ 3 billion stimulus to the economy, what rm saying is this will simply<br />
blow fiscal policy in this country in a way which Irn sure the financial markets<br />
and thc media would never have tolerated for a second from the Government.<br />
J: You spent $ 2 billion yourself at the bc-ginning of the year.<br />
PM: Yes we did, but we said why against the backdrop of putting in the savings bank of<br />
the country two $ 8 billion surpluses and a heavy surplus in the first year. We've<br />
brought down government dcbt from 24 per cent of GDP to 14. We've got one of<br />
the lowest government debt to GDP in the world.<br />
J: Now it's going up again.<br />
PM: Cyclically ycs, not structurally.<br />
J: Why won't you allow him the credit for the tax compliance changes and the FBT<br />
changes? Why can't he usc the revenue for that that you're going to use?<br />
PM: Because ours are devoted to the starting points.<br />
1: That's what he's..<br />
PM: No he's not, he's just trying to spend it, he's trying to garner out. We're required to<br />
be totally pedantic about the points. I had someone asking me about it recently,<br />
about what if we were a billion or two under balance. I said, ' let's not get a fetish<br />
with all this', and that was reported as a fiscal revelation. Was it not?<br />
3; He's entitled to spend money, isn't he?<br />
PM: No, he's not entitled to require of us standards of accountability and then come up<br />
with a shonky little operation like this.<br />
J: If thc money is there for you, it will be thcre for him if he does the same things.<br />
PM: Yes, but we're not add ing these amiounts, wc'rc not adding..<br />
J: I'm talking about thc compliance to the F13T changes. </p>
<p>TEL<br />
PM: Put it this way, I give you those as a guide. Thc 6,6,7.6. if you put the FBT and<br />
compliance monies off it, it comes to about what $ 5 billion or $ 6 billion,<br />
something of that order.<br />
I: Mr Keating, how did you actually gct to those figures, because you said $ 7.6 in the<br />
sccond year, whereas if you take the second year the balance itself is about zero.<br />
PM: You're quite welcome to talk to my staff about that, or the Treasures staff.<br />
J: I was just going to say it looks like the figure is something like about 4.<br />
PM: No they're not, I've got a tabulation here, but you can talk to the staff later.<br />
1: Mr Keating, why is your deficit acceptable and a deficit not acceptable for Dr<br />
Hcwson?<br />
PM: The point I made yesterday, Glenn ( Milne), was this: if the Opposition wants to<br />
deliver parts of the Government's policy, let the Government deliver it. The<br />
Government believcs in it. Let thc Government deliver it. And the Government<br />
said, after putting away massive surpluses in the ' 80s, that it is appropriate for<br />
public demand to be lifted during a period of low private demand, that a fiscal<br />
stimulus was appropriate and necessary. So has the GJovernmcnt of Japan said<br />
that, so has President Clinton said that, so has the OECD Secretariat urged that<br />
world-wide. We're in the mainstream, he's out of it. All I'm saying is, we're the<br />
people who have brought the big fiscal imbalances in Australia down, we're the<br />
ones that reduced the govcrnment debt, and we're the ones that are saying that a<br />
stimulus to the economy is appropriate because we believe it to be appropriate, we<br />
believe it to be ncecssary, but it will be a cyclical stimulus, the structure of the<br />
budgets will return to the kind of balance we had before the recession began.<br />
J: But isn't your problem that he's jumped right into the mainstream?<br />
PM: The thing about that, Michelle ( Grattan), is that I'll just make it very clear to the<br />
public, that all the big nastics are still there. He's not in the mainstream with a<br />
per cent tax on goods and services, he's not in the mainstream with zero tariffs, he's<br />
not in the mainstream with the Geoff Kennett industrial relations policy. We'll just<br />
say to the people of Australia, when he makes these protestations about listening to<br />
people and shifting his ground, don't bclicve him.<br />
J: On tariffs, is thcre a temptation to draw a bigger contrast between yourself and the<br />
Opposition on tariffs. by being more lenient about tariff cuts, in particular to the<br />
sugar industry?<br />
PM: We madc value judgeincnits over an extended period of time, after talking to<br />
industries over a period of years, about where the end points ought to be on tariffs.<br />
And I think we got them right. But in a lot of cases they are not zero.<br />

PM: I think Mr Courtice has presented his rcport, did he not, in the last wcck or so?<br />
We'll consider that and make some statement.<br />
J. When?<br />
PM: I'm not sure.<br />
J: Mr Keating, does this policy makc you inclined to stay and attack it for a while or<br />
arc you inclined to perhaps go for an early election on thc basis of the policy<br />
today?<br />
PM: I'm inclined not to tell you, Tom ( Burton), not that I want to rob you of a good line<br />
in The Herald.<br />
J; Are you waiting for tile next polls?<br />
PM: They came out interestingly, didn't they? Taken thc weekend after the<br />
announccmcent he made on thc Tuesday. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday<br />
four days later, and the Coalition seemied to dctcriorate further. These are only<br />
straws in thc wind, I know.<br />
J: Does this give you enough material to kccp doing Dr Hewson slowly, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: I like to think I've done a reasonable bit of that to date.<br />
J: Why do you think he was wearing his socks onl thce beach? He said he was not<br />
wearing his socks.<br />
PM. don't think that's a matter of..<br />
3: How did you know about his socks?<br />
PM: Apparently people reckon he had socks on, I don't know.<br />
J: As I said, he'll stand fluff on the niavcl, but hc won't stand sand in the toes.<br />
PM: And why do you say that, what was that based on Mr Keating?<br />
J: It was based on an cyewitness, was it not?<br />
