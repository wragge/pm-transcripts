ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIA PRIZE, GREAT HALL, PARLIAMENT<br />
HOUSE, MONDAY, 27 APRIL 1992<br />
It gives me great pleasure to host this second presentation<br />
of the Australia Prize.<br />
The Australia Prize honours outstanding achievement in<br />
science and technLology.<br />
It honours the intelligent, commercial application of<br />
science to develop the technology essential to create wealth<br />
and human welfare.<br />
It celebrates Australia's place in the world as an advanced<br />
and enlightened nation.<br />
We Australians are inclined to underestimate our<br />
achievements in science and technology or, rather, we do<br />
not know enough about them.<br />
We learnt at school that innovation and invention were<br />
essential to our success in conquering the land and the<br />
great distances which separate us from the rest of the<br />
world. So we came away knowing about the MacArthurs' development of<br />
Merino sheep, Farrer' s experiments with wheat, MacKay's<br />
Harvester, Mort's development of refrigeration, the stump<br />
jump plough and myxomatosis.<br />
There was a certain romance to these developments by virtue<br />
of their being part of the rural pioneering legend of<br />
Australia. They were presented to us as principal reasons for our<br />
success in building a good society here.<br />
Our successes in industrial technology have not attracted<br />
the same attention.<br />
Nor have our efforts in the field in which tonight's awards<br />
are made physical sciences related to mining or processing 6441 </p>
<p>Nor have our efforts in the field in which tonight's awards<br />
are made physical sciences related to mining or processing<br />
of mineral resources.<br />
It is safe to say that very few Australians are aware of the<br />
Isasmelt process for base metals which Mt Isa Mines and the<br />
CSIRO developed.<br />
It's doubtful if many know about CRA's technology for the<br />
rapid sorting of diamonds, or the " Jameson cell" flotation<br />
process for the separation of minerals.<br />
These technologies are not well known, and the effort and<br />
ingenuity that went into them are not widely acknowledged.<br />
Yet these sorts of successes in research and development are<br />
as vital to our future as any of the legendary ploughs and<br />
wheat breeds were.<br />
So in presenting the Australia Prize tonight we hope that,<br />
over and above reward and acknowledgment for the winners, we<br />
are signalling recognition for all the workers in this field<br />
past and present.<br />
You will be aware that last week I was in Indonesia.<br />
I went there to consolidate our relationship and pave the<br />
way for a great expansion of our economic relationship.<br />
The opportunities are enormous we are talking about a<br />
rapidly developing, resource rich country of 180 million<br />
people.<br />
We have much of the technology, the processes and the<br />
experience Indonesia and the wider South-east Asian region<br />
needs.<br />
The application of our skills in these countries has more<br />
than a commercial significance, of course. Very often it<br />
means that people there are healthier and better fed and<br />
housed, that they have better lives and more<br />
opportunities. Tonight I can say to the winners of the Australia Prize, and<br />
all those others engaged in the field the work you do is<br />
at the very heart of our future in the region and in the<br />
world. And, of course, what we do there will determine, to a very<br />
large extent, the sort of the society we can build here.<br />
In a real sense our solutions to the problem of<br />
unemployment, our ability to sustain our way of life and our<br />
standard of living, depend on our success in Asia and<br />
Pacific and our success there depends largely on our<br />
scientific and technological skills and the selling of them.<br />
6442 </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Australia Prize is an<br />
international award and this year it demonstrates that our<br />
science and technology are among the best in the world.<br />
The four winners in this year's field have put Australia in<br />
a position of world leadership in developing and making<br />
commercial on-line instrumentation in the coal industry.<br />
The work of tonight's winners is a contemporary example of<br />
the impressive record of Australians in mining and mineral<br />
processing technologies.<br />
For in fact much of the innovation in the mining industry<br />
worldwide is the result of the work of Australian<br />
scientists, technologists and engineers.<br />
It is important that this aspect of ' Australian development<br />
be more generally known, to provide perspective gn the<br />
benefits available from science an * d technology and to<br />
establish an environment that nutures intellectual<br />
achievement. We need to build on our past achievements. In particular,<br />
we must improve our commercial acumen.<br />
We must sharpen our ability to develop Australian ideas and<br />
adapt the ideas of others to gain competitive advantage.<br />
The importance of the Australian Prize is that it places<br />
Australian science in this international context.<br />
Globalisation of technology is not just a concept, but an<br />
important part of Australia's new outward looking culture.<br />
Science and technology can be of great benefit to Australia.<br />
They hold the key to solving many economic, social, medical<br />
and environmental problems.<br />
The Government has recognised this, and is committed to<br />
maintaining a vigorous science and technology system.<br />
Our initiatives in stimulating industrial R&amp; D, strengthening<br />
the public sector research base and enhancing linkages<br />
between researchers and research users, are directed to<br />
providing the strong and vital innovative capacity that is<br />
needed for sustained economic growth.<br />
It is a mark of this commitment that Government support for<br />
science and innovation has grown by 29 per cent in real<br />
terms since 1982-83.<br />
The Australia Prize is a small but important part of this<br />
support, and the work of tonight's winners a tribute to the<br />
national science effort.<br />
I would like to record the Government's gratitude to the<br />
Australian Prize a Committee. 6443 </p>

This panel of distinguished Australians has again brought<br />
wide knowledge and experience to bear on a challenging task.<br />
Our Master of Ceremonies, Sir Rupert Myers, has chaired the<br />
Committee for the last two years.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we honour Australian<br />
endeavour. We congratulate the winners individually and<br />
collectively for their outstanding achievements.<br />
They are achievements of which Australian should be proud.<br />
It is equally true that we should be grateful and I hope,<br />
inspired.<br />
