SIXTH PLENARY MTING OF THE WORLD POWER<br />
CONFERENCE HELD AT MELBOURNE<br />
ON 2.0TH OCTOBER, 1962.<br />
Speech by the Prime Ministelr, Rt. cno R. Menzies<br />
Sir, Your Excellency, and ladies and gentlemen<br />
It is my very simple task to offer a warm welcome<br />
to the members of the Conference on behalf of the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia.<br />
As one who occasionally has to go aro-nd the world<br />
and become involved in arguments in the world, sometimes<br />
fruitful and sometimes fruitless, I want to tell you in a<br />
minute or two that to my mind two of the great problems in<br />
the world today, as you survey the whole globe, ' ire, first<br />
of all, the enormous and growing pressure of population on<br />
resovrces and second, the maldistribution of the benefits<br />
of modern life between the highly developed countries and<br />
the lesser developed countries, These are two enormous<br />
problems. In the first place, how can the world provide a<br />
decent standard of living for the thousands of millions of<br />
people who will be living in it by the turn of the century,<br />
unless something is done to bring the benefits of modern<br />
discovery to the service of all people in all countires?<br />
And this is where you come in, because there is no<br />
single element so significant in raising the standards of<br />
living, in increasing production, as the use of power, the<br />
diverse use of power, the ultimate cheapening of power, the<br />
putting of pow. er behind the man who works in the factory and<br />
the man who works on the farmo<br />
This is a tremendous task and, unless it is accomplished<br />
by the end of this cntury, we will find a mass of<br />
problems produced by pressure upon limited resources that<br />
can lead to disaster in the world.<br />
And, in the second place, Sir, this gap that<br />
exists between those who have and those who have not, the<br />
gap between the highly industrialised countries and those<br />
that are still living on the soil, this is not a gap that<br />
is closing; and it will not be closed merely by kindness or<br />
good will or monetary help. This is a gap that tends to widen<br />
and the right way to close it is to devote more and more<br />
talent and occasionally a flash of genius to the bringing to<br />
the service of people the benefits of power, its applied use,<br />
its availability on terms that can be accommodated by the<br />
country concerned. Now, I mention those very brieflyo They are two<br />
very, very great problems. They will not be very far from<br />
your minds as you go on to consider the changing pattern of<br />
the world's problems in your field, I am confident, as I<br />
have been here this afternoon and as I have read your<br />
preliminary documents, that this conference itself and the<br />
work that stems from it may well turn out to represent a<br />
very great contribution to the solving of problems including<br />
those to which I have briefly made referenco,<br />
Sir, I think you will. understand how warmly indeed<br />
as the head of the Ccmiuonwealth Government, I welcome you all<br />
from overseas or from here to this Conference and to this<br />
country, </p>
