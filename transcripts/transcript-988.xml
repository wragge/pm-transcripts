PLEASANT SUNDAY AFTERNOON SERVICE AT<br />
WESLEY CHURCH, MEL43OURNE 13TH SEPTEMEER. 1964+<br />
Speech by the Prgime Minister the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert-Menizies<br />
Sir, Your Excellency and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I think I might be permitted, as usual, to engage<br />
in a few vagrant thoughts at the beginning of my talk. One<br />
is that I was delighted to hear from the, distinguished Chairman<br />
that Governors in the State of Victoria keep on improving.<br />
( Laughter) Now Sir Irving is such a master of English that<br />
I was surprised to find myself left in doubt. Did he mean that<br />
each JIovernor was better than the previous one? Or did he<br />
mean that each individual Governor, himself, keeps on improving?<br />
And by interjection he tells me that he meant both. All I<br />
want to say, Your Excellency, is that I shall watch you with<br />
loving care ( laughter).<br />
The second preliminary remark I want ID make is that<br />
I think it is a very agreeable compliment that a fellow who<br />
was at school in Ballarat should have the privilege of listening<br />
to singers from Ballarat. This was not always a pleasure.<br />
It has been this afternoon a most undiluted pleasure. I thought<br />
they saing beautifully. But when I was a schoolboy in Ballarat<br />
and was living in the house of my Scottish grandmother, somebody<br />
had in some way produced a ticket for a Saturday afternoon at<br />
the South Street competitions. Now some of you may know about<br />
the South Street competitions. They were then in their heydayperhaps<br />
for all I know they still are, But I went as a matter<br />
of duty because the tickets cost nothing ( Laughter) and I found<br />
myself sitting in a row of women. They terrified me, There<br />
were four or five to one side and four or five to the other<br />
I had no kiope of esca ping, and that afternoon they had what<br />
they called Set Piece Competitions.<br />
F'ifteeni young men came out stood on the same little<br />
chalk marks on the platform and recited that most marvellous<br />
jury speech in the world, which none of them understood, the<br />
speech of Mark Antony over the dead body of Caesar. ( Laughter)<br />
A.. Ld each of them did it exactly the same way. In those days<br />
they didn't wear double-breasted coats like old-fashioned<br />
fellows like me ( Laughter), and they dropped the thumb and<br />
forefinger into the left waistcoat pocket and raised the right<br />
hand and said, " Friends, Romans countrymen... 0 tt You know.<br />
Well, I have lived long enough o have reread that specch and<br />
indeed all of Shakespeare many times with immense joy, but I<br />
want to confess to you that at the ripe intellectual age of<br />
fourteen, I found it pure horror. ( Laughter)<br />
And then the next item was the Set Piece -Song<br />
and the song was " Who Is Sylvia?" ( Laughter) They don't<br />
remember it because it is before their but " Who Is<br />
Sylvia?" and I heard thirteen or fourteen people sing " Who~ Is<br />
Sylvia?" until I don't mind telling you that at the end of that<br />
time I didntt care a hoot who Sylvia was. ( Laughter) All I<br />
do know is that the South Street Competitions made Ballarat<br />
over the years a centre of singing, and I've been as delighted<br />
as you have been to hear the YWCA choir from Ballarat singing<br />
so beautifully, Now since I saw you last indeed since last year,<br />
( when I wasn't here) Itve been in London that won't surprise<br />
** 0900/ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
you because that happens and we had a Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference. Many of you have observed the results of the<br />
Conference and have seen I hope with great satisfaction<br />
that after many difficulties in the course of discussion<br />
we arrived at conclusions which I believe will lead to<br />
increasing co-operation between Commonwealth countries.<br />
But I have thought more than once that perhaps many people<br />
still think of the Commonwealth in rather old terms. It is<br />
only a few years ago that I could hear eminent politicians<br />
say, " Well, of course I refer to the Commonwealth but I<br />
like the expression tthe Empire'. I'm an old-fashioned man."<br />
I might have said that myself many years ago for all I know.<br />
But what I want to put to you this afternoon what I want to<br />
tell you about this afternoon is that we must accommodate our<br />
thinking about the Commonwealth.<br />
We must accommodate our thinking about our relations<br />
with other countries to the realities and changes of life,<br />
because in 1964, at the last meeting that I have attended<br />
the ninth consecutive meeting that I have attended, the sate<br />
of affairs was fundamentally different from the state of<br />
affairs thirty years ago because, believe it or not9 I attended<br />
my first meeting of what was then called the Imperial<br />
Conference in 1935 not then, I hsiston to say, being a Prime<br />
Minister but being Deputy to the late Mr. Lyons, and he being<br />
ill, I attended. 1935, and here we are in 1964.<br />
Now, Sir. perhaps it might be useful for me to<br />
recall what our imperial/ Dominions/ Commonwealth relations<br />
were at that time, just tunder thirty years ago, Well, for<br />
a start, there were fiv people present, There was the Prime<br />
Minister of Great Britain, the Prime Minister of Canada, Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, Prime Minister of South Afriua and the<br />
Prime Minister of New Zealand. And we were all, in a sense,<br />
much of a kind. We spoke the same language, we had the same<br />
sort of background, we understood each other, we found it not<br />
very difficult to arrive at common conclusions and we were<br />
all the subjects, the loyal subjects of the Crow. at that<br />
time, of King George V, and so a conference didntl take very<br />
long and we usually came out of it with a few joint ideas which<br />
we thought might be useful to the world.<br />
Now at that time, $ ir, and indeed until just after<br />
the last war, we had all sorts of things in common. I hope<br />
you won't mind if I point out some of these because this is<br />
a time in history when if we are to be tolerant and understanding,<br />
we must know what the facts are, Now at that time and,<br />
indeed, until 1948 we were all bound together by a common<br />
allegiance to the Throne, This indeed was the whole essence<br />
of the famous Balfour Declaration independent countries,<br />
equal in all things, governing themselves in all things and<br />
united by a common allegiance to the Crown. And, of course,<br />
Australia, New Zealand, Canada Great Britain are all still<br />
united by a common allegiance to th3 Crown9 but that doesn't<br />
apply any longer in a general sense . in the Commonwealth<br />
because in point of fact, beginning n 1949 1948/ 49 when<br />
India became a Republic, and it was agreed India could remain<br />
in the Commonwealth, the great majority of the new nations who<br />
have been created out of the old colontal system have elected<br />
to be republics, and indeed, this led to a nuw formula for how<br />
could a republican be united to another country by a common<br />
allegiance to the Crown,, It was impossible,, And so they<br />
invented a formula, rightly or wrongly of referring to The<br />
Queen as the Hend of the Commonwealth tut eliminating the<br />
requirement of the common allegiance to the Throne. 00 ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Now we were five in those days, At the last Conference<br />
in London, there were eighteen Prime Ministers. You, of course,<br />
may frequently think, God bless you, that one is too many<br />
( Laughter) but there were eighteen of us, and the great bulk<br />
of those present, republics, and therefore not within the<br />
allegiance to the Throne. Now it's worth remembering that<br />
because there is something about being a subject of The Queen<br />
which really does give you something, doesn't it? This<br />
distinguishes you in a material way from other people,<br />
And at that time, and afterwards, it was permissible,<br />
indeed it seemed occasionally almost compulsory for people in<br />
after-dinner speeches particularly and I warn you there is<br />
n~ othing more devastating than the habit of after-dinner speakingit<br />
was the habit of people to say, " Well, look at all the great<br />
elements we have in common," and indeed we had them then. The<br />
sovereignty of Parliament.<br />
Now Parliamentary self-government is commonplace to<br />
us, isn't it4 Parliamentary self-government is the whole<br />
essence of political life, and people may grumble at it, growl<br />
at it, and have great and partisan feelings about this candidate<br />
or that caniidate, but without Parliamentary self-. government<br />
we would not be a democracy and, as we believe, and as I believe,<br />
half our freedoms would disappear. And so it was said with<br />
great tr1u th one time that we were bound together by our common<br />
belief in the sovereignty of Parliament.<br />
I just want to tell you that's no longer true, We<br />
practise the sovereignty of Parliament in Australia and they<br />
do in Canada and they do in New Zealand and they do in. Great<br />
Britain and they do in two or three or four or perhaps five of<br />
the new Commonwealth countries but not in all, not in all,<br />
We have lived long enough to be able to recognise a species of<br />
dictatorship In one country and a one-party system which is<br />
a kind of dictatorship in this country or that country.<br />
There is no longer that common belief that unites, the common<br />
be*.. ef in the sovereignty of Parliament, That's not to say that<br />
we must give up our faith in it, but it does mean to say that we<br />
are to understand that we are now thinking about a Commonwealth<br />
which has lost one of its old unities indeed, more than one<br />
and that we must struggle to understand the point of view of<br />
those who have entirely different ideas,<br />
We have responsible government. Well, I know, ladies<br />
and gentlemen., that every now and then you are a little tempted<br />
to believe that governments are irresponsible, Even my<br />
Government, I believe they tell me, puzzles you occasionally,<br />
but we have responsible government, because the people you send<br />
into Parliament can throw a government out if they feel that it<br />
has fallen into some cardinal blunder. And every time we have<br />
an election and you elect Members of Parliament a Cabinet emerges<br />
and Cabinet is responsible to the Parliament ancA therefore to<br />
you. This is the whole essence of our system of government.<br />
And ever since responsible government was created by the<br />
resignation of Walpole in 174+ 2 because he was defeated on a<br />
vote in the House of Commons over sIRnce then this has been<br />
one of our glories and one of the guarantees ol human freedom<br />
responsible government,<br />
You are not to assume that there is any such thing as<br />
responsible government in five or six or seven of the new<br />
Commonwealth countries, and I am not saying that critically,<br />
All I mean is that these are new countries, newly-won to their<br />
independence and that we will err very grievously if we expect<br />
aO # a </p>
<p>that their standards of government, their institutions of<br />
government, their basic thinking about government will be the<br />
same as our own, because after all, ladies and gentlemen , you<br />
and I are the inheritors of the richest tradition of' Parliamentary<br />
and responsible government the world has yet produced.<br />
Some of these countries, as I say, don't have the<br />
party system except in a highly-simplified form, that is to<br />
say, one pariy; there is only one party you can belong to and<br />
therefore only one party you can vote for. This is quite true<br />
in two or three of the new African countries, and we have had<br />
distinguished spokesmen for these countries, explaining why<br />
they think this is a good thing and T wontt argue with them.<br />
All I know is that I hope we will never havre a one-party system<br />
of government in this country, though at a reception at<br />
Canberra to Mr. Mboya from Kenya, two or three of my friends<br />
of the Opposition in Canberra tapped me on the shoulder when<br />
ho was talking about a one-party Government and 11said, " Don't<br />
worry, old boy, youtve had it for fifteen years."( agtr<br />
Well, I hope I will not have it when it becomes necessary to<br />
destroy it. But two parties a government and an opposition,<br />
the hammer and the anvil this is the way in which the truth<br />
emerges. We have lived, fortunately for ourselves, for many<br />
years under the rule of law, urdor a. system in which however<br />
much we may wrangle, if we go before the judge, we all believe<br />
we are going to have a fair hearing and an equal deal, end<br />
we have had a wonde-6-ul judiciary, and so they have in Great<br />
Britain, and so they have in many other count'~ ies, but the<br />
rule of law, as we understand it, with all people equal before<br />
the Bar of Justice is not a coinmonplace thing in some of the<br />
new countries. We, of course, have a common htstoriaal background.<br />
Indeed, it is our common historical background that makes it<br />
so easy for us to be on terms with the Americans bu~ t never<br />
let it be forgotten, that if you are going to talk about the<br />
history of a people, with ours going right back to the ancient<br />
Britons and to the Romans and to the Angles and the Saxons<br />
-nd the Jutes and the Norman invaders and so on until the Scots<br />
took charge. ( Laughter) If we are going to think about that,<br />
then we must remember that up to the late eighteenth century,<br />
this was a history we had in common with the people of America.<br />
This is frequently forgotten our historic paths diverged<br />
at the Declaration of Independence, That's only a few days<br />
ago thatts towards the end of the eighteenth century. And<br />
therefore in all the Parliamentary countries, as I will call<br />
them, we have a tremendous body of common historic tradition.<br />
This is not true, necessarily of countries in<br />
Asia or in Africa. It is very difficult f'or people who have<br />
reached my age and who have lived and moved and had their<br />
being in this historic tradition and have taken all these<br />
inherited things for granted very difficult for us to<br />
understand that there ar-o other people who are just as good<br />
as we are who don't have th-Is tradition or background at all<br />
but who have their own and we must struggle not to be superior<br />
about ours but to understand theirs and the right way to begin<br />
to understand anybody is ' to discover what your differences are<br />
so that you may perceive them, think about them and try to<br />
reconcile theme 00 0 D ae1 </p>
<p>We've had, many traditions indeed for a long, long<br />
time. We've had our language and our literature. w4e take<br />
all these things for granted, don't we, I think so, I know<br />
I find myself constantly taking -them for granted. We regard<br />
language as a sort of instrument of communication as indeed<br />
it is and as for literature we read either by compulsion or<br />
choice, and we may take it l'or granted that all this is the<br />
ki~ nd of-thing that happens to other people. But you know, my<br />
friends, it isn't. It isn't, W3 just happen to be British<br />
people, Australian citizens British subjects, and we have a<br />
literary tradition the tradition of language which we share<br />
with hundreds of millions of people in the world, twio hundred<br />
millions of them being in the United States of America, and we<br />
have great fun with each other because there are about twentyseven<br />
different accents in the United States of Amprica and at<br />
least twenty.-seven in Great Britain, and so it goes on and<br />
everybody is prepared to say, " Oh, yes. He has an Australian<br />
accent" as no doubt he has " and he has an American accent,"<br />
although that might be one of many ( Laughter) but allowing for<br />
all that, we do knowa don't we, that in our rough and ready<br />
fashion, we are speaking the same language and that we can<br />
communicate with each other on terms and can, so far as communication<br />
will bring it about, understand each other. This is one<br />
of the great things -in the world in the New Commonwealth, which<br />
is in a sense the new world, thai we have to become more<br />
toleralit, more understanding, a litt2e less dc-E;_ aatic about these<br />
things, a little more inclin~ ed to believe that -the fact that<br />
a man speaks in a language not ours is no evidence that he<br />
doesn't have high intelligence and great understanding and<br />
great capacity. And therefore those Pr'ie Ministers? Conferences are<br />
becoming nowadays a liber&amp; I exercise in patience and understanding<br />
in debates, yes, sometimes quit'-e fiery but at the end<br />
with a desire to arrive at an accommodation with the othor man<br />
for an overall cause that you both think is worthwhile and has<br />
sign~ ificance in thae world.<br />
Therefore, Sir, we have come to a new Commonwealth in<br />
which there are now people, ne~ w methods, new problems, new<br />
thinking. The only time I have ever wanted to be younger than<br />
1 am because I am happy to -tell you that I have no grievances<br />
about my ago the only time that I've ever wished that I were<br />
younger than I am is when I have occasionally thought not that<br />
I would like to see what is going to happen in the world in the<br />
world of science, though of course I should be interested, what<br />
is going to happen in the development of armaments what is<br />
going to happen when people go to the moon and fina. it is a<br />
rather dusty spot ( Laughter) these things really don't induce<br />
me to want to be an old, old tiresome man of one hundred-but<br />
I would occasionally like to take twenty years off' my life, just<br />
conditipna lly, able to put it on again later on but just for a<br />
while take twenty years off my life in order to see how this<br />
tremendous task of reconciliation is going on, how the new<br />
Commonwealth is going to work out, how far we will be able to<br />
submerge the occasional irritations in the interests of<br />
kindliness and understanding and a mutual strength, because<br />
believe me I ha-Ve lived long enough to know that he fact ihat<br />
a man is different is no evidence against him. On the contrary,<br />
it may be the greatest evidence in his fivour, * a Ga. 9 e e/ 6 </p>
<p>' 0 -6<br />
Here we are, at the end of an old empire<br />
which 0there it at the end of the older<br />
Commonwealth and at the beginning of a new one. If the<br />
new one succeeds by producing understanding and tolerance<br />
and charity of mind and anxiety to succeed, then it will<br />
turn out to be one of the great new experiments in human<br />
life but if we allow ourselves to be impatient, to look<br />
unduly at the past, to yearn for the old state of affairs,<br />
to tal~ k about the good old times, then perhaps the new<br />
Commonwealth will not last long and perhaps indeed I<br />
would have thought certainly Lhe world will be poorer<br />
for it, </p>
