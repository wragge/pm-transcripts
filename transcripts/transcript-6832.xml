J~ jAUSTRALIA~ g<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA February 4, 1986<br />
The widespread damage and human suffering caused by cyclone<br />
Winifred have shocked all Australians and on behalf of the<br />
Federal Government I again extend sympathy to all those affected.<br />
The Federal Government is concerned about the impact of Winifred<br />
and will extend immediate aid under the Natural Disaster Relief<br />
Arrangements to those affected by cyclone Winifred.<br />
Queensland has already expended disaster relief funds above the<br />
required base amount for 1985-86, $ 10.48 million.<br />
Further outlays will be shared by the Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to a further $ 7<br />
million. Thereafter three Commonwealth dollars will be provided<br />
for every State dollar made available.<br />
I have today received a report from the minister for Primary<br />
Industry, Mr Kerin, whom I had asked to visit the disaster area<br />
on behalf of the Federal Government.<br />
During his tour Mr Kerin discussed the area's special needs in<br />
the wake of the cyclone with local government officials, cane and<br />
banana growers and sugar-mill operators.<br />
He was told that the area's 213 banana growers had lost all their<br />
crops.<br />
The crop will rehabilitate by October 1986 if plantations are<br />
cleared of fallen trunks quickly.<br />
But the losses due to cyclone damage could mean a reduction by<br />
half in Australia's banana production.<br />
The cyclone will also compound the already critical state of the<br />
sugar industry in the area.<br />
while some crops escaped and late-cut cane will rehabilitate,<br />
there are many areas so knocked down that there will be no crop<br />
this year and no availability of plant cane next year.<br />
It now becomes imperative that the Queensland Government acts to<br />
adopt our offer of $ 150 million assistance to the industry.<br />
Growers supplying seven of Australia's 33 sugar mills have been<br />
affected by wind with flood effects yet to be felt and assessed<br />
in the Ingham area, where there are a further two mills. </p>
<p>2<br />
The Federal Government is particularly concerned by the<br />
unemployment aspects of the disaster.<br />
The narrow economic base in the affected area means unemployment<br />
is likely to be more pronounced than otherwise.<br />
For example, the probable dismissal of most of the banana<br />
industry's workforce of between 600 and 800 people, plus<br />
unemployment in the supporting infrastructure industries, would<br />
cause severe problems in the Tully area.<br />
The Social Security Department has acted quickly to ensure it can<br />
handle claims for assistance.<br />
The Australian defence forces along with those services<br />
responsible for communications and transportation have also moved<br />
rapidly and efficiently to render assistance to the ravaged<br />
areas. Federal Cabinet will consider Mr Kerin's report on Monday and<br />
take any further action that is considered necessary.<br />
I will also have the mop-up monitored to ensure that any<br />
necessary additional Federal Government assistance is promptly<br />
provided. </p>
