    <content><![CDATA[<p>I want to thank you so much for the very warm welcome and thank you for sharing your language with me. It is one of the greatest treasures of all of humanity. The extraordinary diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages right across our country.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge the past and present traditional owners of this land. I want to thank you the Warumungu people. It's a great privilege to be standing here on your country.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge my colleague Nigel Scullion the Minister of Indigenous Affairs and Dan Tehan, Minister for Social Services. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Michael Gunner, I want to thank him for joining us here. Also Gerry McCarthy the Member for Barkly and the Northern Territory Minister for Housing and Community Development. Also Steve Edgington the Mayor of the Barkly Regional Council and Steve Moore, the CEO of the Barkly Regional Council and of course Jacinta our LNP – CLP, I should say, candidate. Wonderful to be here with you.</p>
<p>When the delegation from the Barkly Regional Council came to see me in Canberra, we discussed the need for a positive social and economic plan to build a better future for local residents. To make this a reality all three levels of government need to come together. And I'm pleased the Chief Minister has been able to join us on this trip.</p>
<p>We have to map the pathways to reduce harm to children and to set the framework for greater economic development for the Barkly region. The Territory Government has primary responsibility for the support services on the ground including Operation Haven. It is important to see what further work needs to be done better to coordinate services.</p>
<p>So my trip here is about listening to people's experiences, taking lots of notes as you know I do to inform a path forward. In partnership with this community, the Territory government and of course local government.</p>
<p>It is great to be here today. I know Tennant Creek has had its challenges in recent times and I know that you’re facing these challenges head on with great courage, leadership and collaboration and that working together with three levels of government and working together with the Warumungu people and all the Indigenous people here in Tennant Creek in this region is what we need to do.</p>
<p>We have to be working with First Australians, you have to be doing things with First Australians rather than doing things to them. It's a fundamental change and that's why I am here to listen.</p>
<p>So I am looking forward to hearing your vision for the future of Tennant Creek and the Barkly region sharing with you, your ideas and aspirations for making this a thriving community.</p>
<p>It's our job to listen to you and ensure that we can help you achieve your dreams. Thank you very much for the very warm welcome.</p>
