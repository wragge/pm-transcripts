AUS~ IRAIAAh\<br />
PRHf M ISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 26 May 1983<br />
I am disappointed that again the Tasmanian Premier has chosen<br />
to substitute invective for constructive discussion.<br />
By his attitude Mr Gray has deliberately prejudiced the<br />
interests of Tasmanians.<br />
The only issue raised around which there was no agreement<br />
was the up-grading of Wynard Airport.<br />
The Federal Government's attitude to other programs raised in<br />
Mr Gray's letter of May 20 is that existing projects will be<br />
given fair consideration in the Budget context.<br />
On-going projects of merit will be continued and Commonwealth<br />
officials were instructed today to immediately begin talks with<br />
their Tasmanian counterparts on matters which need further<br />
consideration. In relation to the Gordon-below-Franklin dam, the Federal<br />
Government indicated that it was willing, without prejudice<br />
to the interests of Tasmanians, to identify, in conjunction<br />
with Tasmanian officials, employment-generating projects for<br />
which planning can start as soon as possible.<br />
At the insistence of the Federal Government discussions between<br />
a Federal Minister and Commonwealth officials and Tasmanian<br />
Government representatives will be held next week.<br />
It is also clear that Mr Gray is afflicted with the conservative<br />
disease of not being able to speak honestly.<br />
The Craigbourne irrigation scheme will be considered im. r. ediately<br />
by Commonwealth officials and at this stage the Commonwealth is<br />
very favourably disposed towards the project.<br />
It is possible that it could be included within the National<br />
Water Resources Program. </p>
