TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER AND JOHN LAWS,<br />
RADIO 2GB<br />
LAIJS:<br />
On the telephone the Prime M~ inister 0' 1' AuStralia -Good Morning.<br />
PRIME flINISTMR:<br />
Good Norning, John.<br />
LA173: Hlow av: e you?<br />
PRIME UIWST~ k:<br />
I'mi ve, 4y % 7011l thnnl YOU.<br />
Good. Hav-do you thin!, it went?<br />
The launch of it?<br />
LAXS: PR ITV B ITSX8PR:<br />
Well I v; asn't able to tune into P~ xul but I understand relve got<br />
off to a reiLonablQ start. There's a ligJob in front* of us<br />
now an~ d up until the summit and Including the soinrnit, Jobn.<br />
I tbink the iuiport'. nt thing ' that c~ l! your-listcn,-rs and all<br />
Auatiprljano nocd to understrnd ino thot tue P-s f) ( mvPrnm-nt h~ ve,<br />
diseharfed our' obligation first step, that is to try and<br />
outline hov the prGo-ent system has broken down, to set out ways<br />
in. vihdp think ve can proccuce P. fairer system for all<br />
Australi. js. Now vie vart to discurss It in ever. V possible Tw , v<br />
with our Australian electorn te with all Australiari fea and<br />
women having a chance to think about it. Ve'll Go irntVo the<br />
summit not vith a closed mind. 11' it can be shotia that there<br />
arc better vw-v; than relve cii~ j oste0 of' dcoi nr . t 0-n ePn<br />
to bear them. We're-about tryinfg to produce Zoi-Australia a<br />
systeni which is silrand : airer and more ecouoz-ically<br />
efficient, fes I think it's very iimportant that the general public TV--lise<br />
4dI th~ the O:. position is not al~ igthem ltin, r* 0 Y nlili<br />
t h~ 11r. lesL a ) a j r-t13a t i s t o b o d j13c u s th~ t i a It<br />
the U i1tAtu~ n in' it? </p>
<p>PRIIIE14r1I STER:<br />
No definitely not, John. We have done what vie th~ knkr is the<br />
obligation upon us because % eno w thpt Australinns understani<br />
that the present systemi is not good. Vie ktnow that they don't<br />
like having to pay' so much o. the iinuc-e they ear. n strFaiLht ou'<br />
in income taxu. We've got the positisn v.' here about 40%, Johnn,<br />
of ' full-time earners are payiig 46 out of every dollar as<br />
a margin as tan. Now we think.-that thalkt. is not what they want.<br />
rie knovo they thinl( it's not fair it's not efficient in economic<br />
terms. So if we're going to be able, John, to got a substantialand<br />
we're looking at. about a 30% reductiqn for the avex-age wage<br />
and salariy earner a 30% reduction in the direct income tax he<br />
pays then we've got to work out what % w. e think are the best<br />
ways of getting alternative revenue so that we're going to be<br />
able to provide the services that the people still want. Now as<br />
you rightly say, John, this ' is an outline of the ways in which<br />
wde think we can get there.. But we're not saying to the Australian<br />
people there it is, taR-u, it or leave it. We want you to talk with<br />
us about it. Paul lKeating and I and others will beavailable<br />
in the period up) Lu Lhe ziunwIilL Lu t! Aylulii but. ziuL juzsL u, 3 Lv Lit<br />
talking but also to listen to what people have-got to say.<br />
Yes, I think Lhat's very important and it does worry me a bit<br />
that', the Opposition is rather giving the impression that this is<br />
Lt and this is what they're going to have to cop, and that is<br />
not the case.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yt is not the catse but it is consistent with the attitude of<br />
the Opposition. 1ihen they were in Government they knew that<br />
certain basic things bad to be done, John, to got this economy<br />
into bel. t6er shspe.. Just very quichly you can list then,<br />
I'll come the question of tax at the moment -but in the area<br />
of the financial systemn they did the w,, ork, they hvnbv that the<br />
financial system should be deregulated. They didcn't have the<br />
1t6 to" the decisioa. They knc--that the dollar ohould be<br />
floated. They did the work but didn't have the guts to makie the<br />
decision. They knew that more banks should come in here so<br />
that ordinary Austral. ians co'~ ild have -a more competitive banking<br />
system dVi d the wiork, didn'tt have the guts to make the decision.<br />
In tan Howard knew that the sort of changes that we're talking<br />
about should be brought in did the work didn't have the guts<br />
even to bring it right up to the Australian peop3e. Now in<br />
Opposition they are just as bad. They are scarerilonvers. They<br />
are trying. to misvepresent now if they thinR that that'Is the<br />
sort of thing that the Australian electorate appreeiates; I think<br />
that t√±~ ey are inahing a bad political judgement.<br />
LAVIS; Yes but the-point is this: * I don't like paying tax and neithar<br />
doco anybody elcac and thor'o might b-5 many poopie wjho are going<br />
to find parts of the suggestion that has been maeby your<br />
government most unpalatable. Btt if in the 7iashtill the majority<br />
of Australians are going to be better off surely if2 we're proper<br />
human beings, that chould ctr primn~ concern -Iz~ ouldn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well John' I appreciate that and there are two pointo to be made<br />
In regard to what you said. You very ri-htly _ ma7 the point<br />
that it's a package and obvi. usly in any tot" al. p.(, age thrat a<br />
Government puts forwiard which has to deal with r. vtole rangea 0i<br />
taxes there will. bc parts in it which zre unpalatnble to som2<br />
and parts vih-iclh other p -ople ) lke. '; So if you looh at the vhole </p>
<p>comm~ unity of Australia there' 11 be pointo bero, '. there and<br />
everywhere pieople will say I don It like that. But you! re quite<br />
Tight John it: saying wiell let's lookc at thiF pachF. Ce as a whole,<br />
17hich leads me to the second tbing: that the overwhelming<br />
majority of Australians will be bett6r of f. No ernnent in its<br />
* ri-ht mind and we're certi. nly Iii our -ight inind<br />
goin-to bring in chang.. 6 which io Going to be woe~ se for the<br />
majovity of Australians.<br />
Of courSe not.<br />
PRIME M! INISTER:<br />
It's politicailly stupid and economnical. ly disastrous. Novi via re<br />
nlot about e3. tlier of th1oze eourses. Now one can ask then why<br />
will the mrajority of Avrtralians able to be better off<br />
when you have tax changes and the reasons, basica'ly, are<br />
simple. Firstly, there are as know unfortunately very many<br />
of our fellow Australians who don't pay any tax at all. Tbey<br />
don't do that bacause they are able to avoid the obligations<br />
in respect of their income by getting into a whole lot of tax<br />
evasion and avoidan~ ce, Howv part of our pr~ oposal is to broaden<br />
the direct ta.-base so that we tvill pichk up a. lot o? tax from<br />
those people vtio are cuirrently avolaing and evading. Ana<br />
the Jeccnd thing uwder our preferred optionr is th 8t. with a<br />
bi-oad based consumnpti. on tax these people w,, ith their huddreds<br />
Uf 1huususnds, in -3~ n cn.; s milliuns of doj lurs o airv 130t.<br />
paying any direct tax and are not paying any tax on a large<br />
area of their consu-nD) ion wil nc-: 7 be nialzin-a contribution<br />
to tho-general revenue through P. con&amp;; umptioi; tax,. So when you<br />
bring -Zhcse elemnents toehrJohn gettir-i themn in the direct<br />
tax 3L'en by the broadening oT the base and bring~ ner in a<br />
consumption taxt so that they are r~ iking a contribution to the<br />
general revenue thtit way that":-bringing in to -tbe genecral<br />
rcevenue pool available to help all Australians some millions<br />
of dollars which are ablte, then to distribute to the mass olf<br />
Australians to mnake them better off.<br />
LAWS: Now vwh n you and your men sat around and discussed thi~ s you<br />
must have all said Gjod we're going to be in trouble there,<br />
or thnyrll. bo after us, or w-e', re going tn hsvp i8 pn hlki In<br />
this area. W~ hcre do you believ4 the biggest problem is going<br />
to couie frow?<br />
PRIME r1IrISTER;<br />
Well John you're right. flow " let me just make onae pr-elimninary<br />
point and then go to directlly . answer your question:<br />
we knew when we approa ched this job of tryinp_. to reform the<br />
tau x astce. n we knew that wea were ! L0-nag risk. We hnow still<br />
that wie're taking a rish and you very astutely Put your finger<br />
on part of it bcmuse there are campaigns of inizrepresentation.<br />
.1e have an ultimate belief that. if you are honest with people,<br />
talh to them,. listnsn to them, that between us as a government<br />
and as a conmuinity vorkling together we ought to boe able to get<br />
a bet-ter system. Vee know there are risks. Okay, where are the,<br />
particular areas of rin~ k? I guess, John, the thin-rs that we'll<br />
xioed to explaiiu most aare uhese: 1 hzrtly, in the area of<br />
fringe benftt. Novi this bas fired uip in a way which is<br />
exploding now End if sonmething is not done abot it now will<br />
mean that more and ioro burdens will Tue placed upon thiose in the<br />
con-munity who don't get any. friinge benefit-s and they are<br />
still the MiAjorlty X cvcss. </p>
<p>4.<br />
LW7S: Yes. PRTtW. TANTSTR:<br />
Wow what Wve 90': tc do Ii~ to edxplain that the vay we're goi) ig<br />
* about thi.-means that the employers will have to face up to the<br />
implications of this. In many cases they will1 be prepcred to<br />
carry that additional burden, in others they may not. But I<br />
belic-ve that thL-re is a lot of explanation to do Irn that area<br />
but I am sure that wie can do it. Secondly, there has been<br />
concern about the area of capital gain. W7e'll have some<br />
explaining to do there, but I'm more than happy to do tha t<br />
because ' it has been somewhat misreoresented. Let me mahe these<br />
points about'the capital gains John: firstly-and most<br />
importantly there would not be, il vie go ahead with a capita.<br />
gains tax, there would not be any Qapital gains upon the personal<br />
homez on private homes iione under any circumcstan-ers<br />
Ahsnliitrly free of that. Secondly John it would notc bn L tax<br />
upon nomnal gains only upon real gains. So that inifation<br />
is not taxed it's only real gaips. Thirdly, it's only<br />
prospoctive. I mean any gain that's accumulated prior to the<br />
dete of the introduction of. it isnot taxed. Fourthl. y. losses are<br />
offset. In other words, when you tahe those things into account<br />
it ip a very modest capital gain. But the fifth and very<br />
important point to make aonut it is this, that wie Lre -not loolking<br />
at a capi-Cal gains t~ x* simply in terms of revenue. Tha rpvenue<br />
that we'll get from it w" All. be in the scheme of things very small,.<br />
You're talhing about the order of $ 100 m~ illion which shows that<br />
it's not very hecavy in it3 impost, but 4t'zi importance Js aG<br />
an instrument, John, in hel~ ping to beat taN avoidance aind evasion.<br />
And I bolieve that vJiler there thirgs are explained they will be<br />
nvLujvru~ Lly usidetsvLuud buL Y~ Lhlul Uruvidly auut~ pLt-d by Line<br />
Australian comunity.<br />
LAVIJS: Yes, the cost of policing capital gains is going to be-pretty.<br />
high X would imagine. Obviously the revenue is-going to offset<br />
the cost?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh no I don't think the mechanics and the administration of it<br />
. are enormnously dif ficult John. But as I make the point, vie a-re<br />
not deluding ourselves and nor should the pe~-ople fe el that this<br />
is going to * be a masssive source of reve-t7uut. It's not going to be.<br />
flut what Australians have got to ask themsielves I think is this<br />
simple question: 6-, y is it the overwhelming mAjority of<br />
countries in the western world have a capital gains tax? It's<br />
been thc-re in the United States for a long time. Most countries<br />
havo it.. And they 1L-avt9 it because it is fnir thtt you chouldn't<br />
have the discrimination against the ordinary mass of-. people who<br />
Just get their income-fror., their exertions. Somte people are<br />
able to get very substantial incom-e from appreciation of assets<br />
in which they've involved no effort. Blut im~ ortantly, in doing<br />
this, you do cl. ose off or help to close off very,-very<br />
subst-, ntial a~ er-s of avoi. dance and evasion.<br />
Yes, I think that area and I mentioned it to ba Paul Neating<br />
and I think that you'd be interestod in it too the * fact<br />
that you say that the family home will not be inlddand that's<br />
erirw-nently rec. s; onable and will never be included nnd I thinkC<br />
that that's fair. </p>
<p>PTHYLIX TANKSTFOR<br />
It would tover bo here it ' snotnormally inr. luded eLns e I) hOr e<br />
and it viould not be here.<br />
* Okay, but the question I asked Pau), Neating, and I ask the s~ i:<br />
question ol you: whby can't there be -and I Im no~ t~ lsget<br />
there be 5 or 6 -but why can't there be-two family 1. oyn! s. * If<br />
a iran finds bimself in a position vhore he has paid e;. ceptionally<br />
high tax in order to organise his life sothat ho can have a<br />
house in towin and be luclKy enough to have a beach house -and<br />
oniy zne rich people can do it 5o tiae rich pouple h;, ve puid<br />
high ta2xes in order to enjoy that lugury. W7hy can't there be<br />
trio family homes?<br />
Vell I think, John, you start to break down the principle of the<br />
tan there and. of course, I'm not. saying it would be the case<br />
in your case because I know you pay all your tanes but..<br />
LAUtS: ( laughs) I sure do.<br />
6! es, and good luck to you, but you get a lot of situations where<br />
there could be roi-ts; * 1 thinh, in -this sort of thing. I'm not<br />
saying that that's so in every case but all X c -n say, John,<br />
is where this has been considered it other countries that sort<br />
of distinction is not =, de and I thinh it is not ri,. de because<br />
it would lead to conceptual difficulties a; id, of course,<br />
the otliey thiug is you could have economic diotortlo; is as vgcll<br />
John. You could have an incentive to put money into second<br />
houses as a way of avoiding tax ave; that would not be, in tei7Ls<br />
of economic policy and in trying to get rational allocation ofO<br />
resoure. s a sensible thing to do.<br />
LAWS: Yes, it's just that I feel that as I think things being fair<br />
und equ4 table to everybody is the way that these systems should<br />
wvork ana i~ f a man has organised his life by hard work and bv<br />
paying excessively * high taxes up until this time into a position<br />
Mhere he can afford the luxury ot, a second house I don't really<br />
thinR he should be discriminrated affainst and I can't see anything<br />
wrong vith eiicouraging people to invest in property either.<br />
PRINAE MINISTER:<br />
Let me make this point: you realise John that if you have a second<br />
house you aon't pay tax on Tho fact of havia a k&amp; econd. luut~ t. I<br />
mean you can have it thcere and you nion't pay any tax on it. it<br />
wuould be only if you divposed of-l that second bouse and made and<br />
derived a capital gain from it. I mean the way y'iUVe been putting<br />
your point it is almost Eas though having a second house attracts<br />
a twi. It does not. You would only attract a capital gains tax<br />
if in regEard to that second house at some stage you daispoEsed of it<br />
at a prtt-aid at a prol&amp;' it beyonid inflaition. lu. otCher wjord: 3<br />
if John Laws buys a second house lot's say $ 100,000 noly<br />
you don't 1t15rough buying it havc any taix to that house, and say<br />
over a peryiod of time you held it for let's tuay just ' Lor<br />
a simple case, Un Sarithm. otical e,, xArple, youl1' opt tt for ten years.<br />
H~ ori you pzy no tax in that period on I. Xf at the end of ten<br />
yoara lct~ o oanj. r and I'm not uc ' ing compouinding herp hilt le's<br />
say the-ro was 10% inflation in 20 years Pad it was worth<br />
200,0000 and X hnow,, AWith co. ind intovest it's different<br />
but irt s; iviplc prlthm,, tic torms and. you sole, it at Q'" 200.000 ii </p>
<p>in ten years time you wouldn't pay any tax, bec,,, Pse thzt vould be<br />
nearly the inflation that had oscurred in the period zpd you<br />
vouldn't pny any tax-,<br />
LAI7S: Yess, well I can see merit gor both arguments and I am aware that<br />
you don't pay any tax simply-by owning it, only vwhey' it's paissed<br />
on, but it is also taxed at the time of death, icn't it?<br />
) PRXPAE HINISTER:<br />
Yes but it's not a death duty, The whole point about a capital<br />
gains is the very fact that your property is increasing in<br />
value you don't simply pay tax, on that it's only at the time<br />
oZ realication of the capital gain and for the purpose of tho<br />
implementat 5on -of a capital gains tax the transfei-ance st the<br />
time of death iv regarded' as accrual for the purposes of<br />
capital a real iation for the purposes of capital gain.<br />
Yes, and I undcerstand that, and again I think it Is something<br />
that should be mnade veyy clear to the public because it'<br />
one of those faceto of your propocml that can distorted nnd<br />
I'm &amp; quite sure that plenty of pe-ople will be preparod to tlistox-t<br />
it. It isn't in fact a death duty even though it Is payable at<br />
time of death, but vhere it's not payable at the time of death<br />
then you could simply pass property on from ge rcation to<br />
Generation to Coneration.<br />
PRIM~ E iHINSTBR:<br />
Egactlyv, and Jolin lot wne mahe the point too to Autvalian<br />
men and vomen this government has showin in its pertod 4-offi.,-e<br />
* that what it ifs about -is trying tc, promote growth and ef fic~. eney<br />
in our economny. The last thing that this governmnent woUld 6o<br />
would be to change the tax laws in a way. which is goinlg to<br />
reduce growtbs reduce the efficient operation of our econony.<br />
And I just ash Australian men and wiomen to ask themselves the<br />
question: why is it that governments in the rest of the woirld<br />
hava this tax? The United S, 1tates could hiardly be regarcied v-s<br />
a country which is against free-enterprise and the opporttxzity<br />
for the individual to expand their acquisition og income and<br />
wealth. It is simply the case that governments alil around the<br />
world have understood * that it's necessary to have this sort of<br />
tax not sim~ ply as a revenue source but also, John, as an<br />
instrument to fight tax avoidarce and evasion.<br />
LAWS: Yes. The ACTU is obviously not happy about what has been<br />
proposed in the form of a consuyiption taX.<br />
PPLXE MIN1ZTER:<br />
17ell there's two or three things to say about that, John.<br />
Firstly, I know tbrt~ you know because you've said on a number<br />
of ozer-sions, this government is not here to do just what the<br />
A~ rU or the trade uions w~ ant.<br />
LAWS T* X IhUP-tnuL, </p>
<p>PRINAE MINISTE1R:<br />
r~ e certainly are not, we regard it as cfonoicaly raid politically<br />
sencible to talh v. 4th the trade uinion iA. ovemi: nt, CvGsvie tall-with<br />
business, because that's 1nvol-v( 1 in our whole approcch -to<br />
goveynnent. We don't regard hc ovganisc-ed woPruiug L. en and 7. oMen<br />
ma-n-and women of this country an Important r-ont'tuont Of<br />
our w~ hole society and their organications as important un; tz;<br />
with whbich governments ought to talk, in the samie tuay' as re regard<br />
business. Novi' duving the last election., John, w~ be X initiated<br />
this p~' ocess of tax reform. I said as a ' seventh principlo the) cnyou<br />
see ve're not changing anything -I said if any ta; z reform<br />
rihich were to inelude a consumptf. oa tax is to work thean it biust<br />
have the support of those who would be directl7r involved the<br />
trade unions -because let me mp-he this qui. Le clpear John -frcii<br />
the outsalg Of these community debates this must be quite clear.<br />
Hf we do as a community decide that it makes sense for all the<br />
reasons we've put to move as part of tax ref orm toQ include e<br />
bvoox2 baocd oonov~ mptionc tan co that from that wo can givr; maosive<br />
ta; x cuts -30% 2 tax. cuts to the average wiage earner -you can't<br />
then havIng Got that great benefit In direct; taxr cuts lroii<br />
the introductlon of a broad based consumntion taxz then have yo1. ar<br />
second dip and say X ' m going to have my wages incxyear'ed to covnr<br />
the price incronsi, associated with the introdu. stion of thv tan..<br />
The-. e must be discounting for that. Now iii the dicussions that<br />
Paul Ueating has had with the ACTU and that I have had we have<br />
made it ouite cliear that discounting is essential. hlow,, I thinU<br />
they understand that. They are going to the tan sumit with an<br />
open Mi. nd C. believe, to listen to all the options. And It's<br />
my vio0,,/ John, that they wvill come to see that what t -air members<br />
do really wjant is a very, very substantial % iut in diL'ect taxens.<br />
I meau it is eilly to nave a sltuion, Jlohn, whee~ e the = eCnar y<br />
bloke i2 asking himself a question look shall X worlz a bi.' ruoire<br />
overtime becaus; e virtually half of each extra dollar is going to<br />
the government. It's economically inefficiont and if wke are<br />
going to b&amp; able therefore to cut that 46 rate Clown to somethiing<br />
like 35 and give what's really a 30% reduction then it can only<br />
wYorit in the way I've put. Now I think that ordinary workers and<br />
their unions will comec to see the sense of that. Let nno inalte the<br />
the point John: if you take the average wekly earner, in annual<br />
terms he gets about $ 221, thousand dollars. The income ta-^ % ut<br />
for the average workcer will I' 3l a week, That iS we as a<br />
government vwill be taking $ 31 a week less out of bts pay packet in<br />
direct ta.--cuts. The calculated cort of tlhe increase-ilu the<br />
consumption tax-is about $ 16,80 a tweak. In other vords that<br />
worier in net terms woula be $ 14.20 a week beLter ulf. i'J1 t1% i<br />
be in a position to spend that money hie'll have that net increase<br />
in his or' her hand to w~ ake a decision as to how to best<br />
catisfy his wiants and those of his ki-ds,<br />
Lj1, AVS:<br />
Yes. I wonder why some sections of the msdia choose to take a<br />
negative approach not 7vhat you're going to gain but what you're<br />
going to lose with haeadlines tbat indicate that you're not rezlly<br />
goiig to be bettor offi by Tax changes; to plcase nobody"<br />
is one headline, </p>
<p>W 1 15,* 9..<br />
\ Vell John I ou' pose there's poi. nts about t hant: you're au<br />
old Lmed). a m~ an. I zsuppose it is always, U. e case-thut bcad news<br />
tends to be more salovable than cood nea,-. c vnd so i thy think they<br />
can find soiue bad news in sorn'! th". ng they'll erh~~ ethat<br />
Tho sceond thing John is that ve've got to understand, aa I said<br />
earlier in cur discussion, this is a pachage it Las whole lots<br />
of eleoents and it is true that a * lot of grot ps vwill be able to<br />
point to one element and say well gee I doa't like that and they'll<br />
t -nd to n'oneont-eatp on t; hat. and some newspapers imlaht, thel1Vthan<br />
looking at the wbole package, Just ' to go bark to the<br />
el. aimple I gave: you take this person the average weekly<br />

A question that is going to be asked, and it's being asked<br />
Mripantly already and people are going to start to get a bit<br />
Segrlous nbout it is the tax on frinr-e be-anefLts. The que-stkion<br />
being-: izked of course is are the politicians goin-, to ,) ay the<br />
samz e so-vt of taxz oni thebi fringe benefit?<br />
PRIM-TINSTI:<br />
VJell what the paper points out is that in regard to vhetil-er<br />
it-Is politicians or anyone else where you have arbit-rated<br />
decisions they are not covered. WThat I wiant to sity is this:<br />
in political terms ve would not be doing anything which would<br />
b stupid enongh to say look here Is a differentiation, you're<br />
trying to Ilo: ok after politicians favourAbly as aGairist everyone<br />
else i: 2 tbe community. That wouldn't make sense, and we're not<br />
going to be doing it.<br />
You see the point is that people are going to say people<br />
that are a bit stupid but there are plenty of those in the<br />
world are going to-say well look at the f ringe benefits that<br />
the Prime thinister -ets. They simply neglect that as<br />
Prime Minister of one &amp; l the greatest countries in the wiorld<br />
or to my way of thing tqxe great; Pot country it the world you're<br />
entitled to a few but people are going to say well what about<br />
all the frtnge benefits hle gets the car's, tanr overseas<br />
trips, and thre other thin-s.<br />
I autta Just let me tt~ lrc the ovrseas trips one 19 w had<br />
room to fit in over vand above all the demanding jouralits<br />
who wvant to cover everything that happen:, I wouldn't riind taking<br />
your ordinary Australirns5 with us jiust to see how these overseas<br />
J~~ e rcesupeed to be ouch grccat-fUn ot mako the<br />
po.' rt that oue of the frustraiting things about these trips is<br />
that at the e-nd of the day oople will s ay the journalists<br />
will say wie hrad r-great time kseeing The Louvre today or Nwe<br />

rxstraLing thin-in the w orId. You're there in conerance<br />
cn-wnvlking nvier hrie-, fs -hut tbn's ft perphoraV point.<br />
Let mie get to tlia guts Of it I can tell the peoplo* oi Australia<br />
&amp; s Pri me Minister I am not about tta;, reforin to be,, no. it Do Xiawhe.<br />
At the end of the day the samte sort of rules % vill have applied<br />
* to the P2rime [ LrIi ster as to anyone else. Vv e made it quite<br />
clear that if at the end, in terms of the outco. ne * Pthat I were<br />
to be seen as bering 8ignificnntly better off I've miade it quite<br />
clear that from my own point of view I wjould be disposing of that.<br />
I'm not in this position for personal. benefit and I won't be<br />
doing it.<br />
LAVIS: Yes, you made a point earlier that I t~ hink requires re-malding<br />
and that is that and I've said it on many occasiois concerning<br />
the KST, govern,. ent as well whether wie lihe what you CAo or<br />
twhether te dislike what you do is totally immaterial. We should<br />
at least have enougb faith in ourselvcs as rwozbers of the<br />
public of Australia for electing you that you're intelligent and<br />
the peoplc arouind you are intelligent. Novi no intelligent person<br />
is deliberately going to do something that's goina: to get hibi<br />
out of office. It mightn't be right what you're doing but if<br />
it is virong you're not doing it deliberately are you?<br />
PRIUE MINISTER:<br />
Certainly Pot doing . It deliberately but the other side of that<br />
coin is this, John. I've tried to makhe the point in the last<br />
% 7eeh or so: thin country as you rightly say this groat<br />
country -has Z oz-too long the very heavy price of having<br />
governments, here iz Canberra which knew what needed to be done<br />
for the welfare of thio country and didn't have tae guts to do<br />
It becauneo they thought what they did could be misrepresented.<br />
7 z'uptuL vfki L i L-1md bzwfui-vi4&amp; bU1' 6, flo0atincg the<br />
dollar, der'egulating the financial system, all of those things<br />
crucial to having a better, more efficient functioning Australian<br />
econom~ which voul~ d produce bonefits for the ordinary Australian<br />
tmn Lng woman. N~ ow they vouldn't'ma1he the decisions bccause they<br />
thought they could be misrepi-esented or they mi* ight get some<br />
political fJlal;. Ve've faced up to each onie of? those and vie've<br />
made the decisions. Now it's tht-same with tho tax~ system. It<br />
is quite lear,* John, that this taMc system is diLsinteL} ratirig<br />
and it's disintegrating in a way wihich is increasingly with ecach<br />
passing y( oar imposing a gr-eater. burden on ordinary Mir. and<br />
Lrs. Australl: -, iud the hids dependent upon them. They are the<br />
ones vwhich are increasingly paying 1; he burden. Ncw if we are<br />
prepasred to iaee up to that and aay to Mr'. and Mfrc, Auctralia<br />
he re's how we think we can create a fairer and more econernic<br />
efficient tax system. Vero's our thinking, respond to it and<br />
together we can Improve it. I said just recently John it<br />
would be easy enough to viaYk away from it because I can assuit-_<br />
, you Bob Uawhe, 1aul Keatinr, all tho people arotund me-, we could<br />
get by under this present t: system. Vie won't be hurt. VTe'd<br />
do all right and the people out there the irelatively well to do<br />
in the community they can Set by under this system. In fact<br />
ma. o9 t1 1em are xi e ry, . ery knell Indeed unfler it. But<br />
next yearP the year after, a dectCe after, th, generation after,<br />
the kids of todv~ y will pay an inorcIlnately high ice -a<br />
devastating price if politiciaans and government today haven't<br />
e-ot the guts to face up to it. Now we, bave got the EgUts to ftico<br />

Vell it's a risk. John, as. I said earlier in this program we<br />
do understCand it's a risR. But in politica theEre are as wl<br />
as risks there are obligations and duty. Vie * belleve twe iave<br />
an obligation and a duty to reform the tax system. I'm not"<br />
going to wa~ k away from that obligation. I'm going to try and<br />
talk with t~ e Australian paople try and gpt a gcneral<br />
underatandl . g abouL vihat needs to be done. I have sufficient<br />
trust in the Australian people that if you talk 4ith them<br />
not to thein and at them but with them to try and shvre Vieir<br />

which is going to make for a better Australia in ths futur e<br />
