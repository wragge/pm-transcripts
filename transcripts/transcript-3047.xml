PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 141<br />
24 October 1973<br />
NATIONAL ANTHEM POLL PLANS<br />
The Bureau of Census and Statistics, at the<br />
request of the Government, is planning a nation-wide<br />
opinion poll to establish preferences for a new<br />
National Anthem.<br />
The poll will be conducted in February next<br />
year and people will be asked to make their choice from<br />
the three songs already selected by the National Anthem<br />
Committee. These are: Advance Australia Fair, Song of<br />
Australia, and Waltzing Matilda.<br />
Results of the poll will be used by the Government<br />
to make a final decision on the anthem.<br />
A cross-section of the community, aged 18 and over,<br />
throughout Australia will be covered.<br />
The poll is being organised by the Bureau of Census<br />
and Statistics as part of its NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY.<br />
The Bureau's responsibilities include many Australia-wide<br />
household surveys such as the quarterly surveys of employment<br />
and the major surveys recently completed on migrants and on<br />
income. These surveys provide valuable information upon which<br />
the polihies of the Government and other organisations can be<br />
based. All surveys are based on scientifically selected samples<br />
of up to 60,000 people in all walks of life.<br />
The National Anthem poll will be an extension of this<br />
continuing NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY programme. While giving<br />
an accurate measure of opinion the costs involved are minimal<br />
compared with those for a national referendum.<br />
All surveys conducted by the NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY<br />
are preceded by a small pilot test to ensure that the survey<br />
procedures are efficiently designed. A pilot test for the<br />
National Anthem poll will be conducted during November.<br />
