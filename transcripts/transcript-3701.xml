QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO. 4 2? c2<br />
( SUNDAY 13 APRIL 1975) INDO-CHINA<br />
THE TRAGEDY OF INDO-CHINA WHI6+ AS BEEN GOING<br />
ON NOW FOR 30 YEARS ONCE AGAIN DOMINATES THE HEADLINES.<br />
OUR TELEVISION SCREENS AND THE DEBATE IN PARLIAMENTX<br />
FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTERS HAVE<br />
HAD TO REPORT TO PARLIAMENT ABOUT AUSTRALIAN ACTIONS IN<br />
VIETNAMX I AM THE FIFTH AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER TO<br />
DO SO&amp; LAST WEEK, HOWEVER, THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN<br />
MY POSITION FROM THAT OF MY FOUR PREDECESSORS THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ACTIONS I HAD TO TALK ABOUT, INCLUDING ACTIONS<br />
BY MEMBERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ARMED SERVICES, WERE SOLELY<br />
HUMANITARIAN AND HAD TO DO WITH EFFORTS TO END THE<br />
FIGHTING, TO REDUCE SUFFERING) IT IS A VERY REGRETTABLE<br />
THING THAT THE 30 YEARS OF SUFFERING BY THE PEOPLE OF<br />
INDO-CHINA SHOULD STILL BE SEEN BY SOME AS A MEANS OF<br />
EXTRACTING POLITICAL CAPITAL AND POLITICAL ADVANTAGE)<br />
FOR INSTANCE, THERE HAS BEEN A PRETTY PATHETIC ATTEMPT<br />
TO CRITICISE AUSTRALIA'S ROLE IN EVACUATION EFFORTS IN<br />
SOUTH VIETNAMX THE BEST ANSWER TO OUR CRITICS HAS COME<br />
FROM OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS) THE UNITED STATES COMMANDER<br />
IN CHIEF IN THE PACIFIC AREA, ADMIRAL NOEL GAYLER, SENT<br />
ME THIS MESSAGE ON 2 APRIL: </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" PLEASE ACCEPT MY WARM APPRECIATION AND DEEP<br />
ADMIRATION FOR YOUR HELP TO EVACUATE THE<br />
MANY DESPERATE REFUGEES FROM DANANG,<br />
AUSTRALIA CAN TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THE<br />
RAPID DECISION TO MEET AN ABSOLUTELY<br />
ESSENTIAL HUMANITARIAN REQUIREMENT.<br />
WARMEST RESPECT. ( SIGNED) ADMIRAL NOEL<br />
GAYLER, UNITED STATES COMMANDER IN CHIEF PACIFIC."<br />
AND THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR, MR MARSHALL GREEN, LAST WEEK<br />
PERSONALLY THANKED US FOR THE " GREAT SHOW" PERFORMED BY<br />
AUSTRALIAN PERSONNEL IN HUMANITARIAN WORK IN VIETNAMX<br />
A'MORE SERIOUS EFFORT TO USE THE VIETNAM TRAGEDY AS<br />
A POLITICAL FOOTBALL COMES WITH TH+ ETTEMPT AT SOWING SEEDS<br />
OF NEW FEAR AND NEW DIVISIONS IN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY)<br />
WHATEVER ONE MAY THINK ABOUT THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM,<br />
WHATEVER ONE'S VIEW OF ITS ORIGINS AND THE RIGHTS AND<br />
WRONGS OF FOREIGN INTERVENTION IN THE WAR, THE FACT IS THAT<br />
VIETNAM HAS NEVER BEEN A QUESTION AFFECTING THE BASIC<br />
SECURITY OF EITHER AUSTRALIA OR THE UNITED STATESg<br />
AUSTRALIA'S SECURITY AND LONG TERM INTERESTS ARE NOT<br />
AFFECTED BY THE POLITICAL COLOUR OF THE RULERS IN SAIGONX </p>
<p>2( A)<br />
IT WAS THAT FALSE VIEW WHICH MISLED THE UNITED<br />
STATES AND SUBSEQUENTLY AUSTRALIA, INTO ITS INDO-CHINA<br />
INTERVENTIONX IN THOSE YEARS WE HEARD THE STORY THAT<br />
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN VIETNAM WAS PART OF CHINA'S<br />
ALLEGED DOWNWARD THRUST BETWEEN THE PACIFIC AND THE<br />
INDIAN OCEANX, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD AGREE WITH<br />
THAT VIEW TODAY)( CERTAINLY IN LAST WEEK'IS DEBATE IN<br />
PARLIAMENT NOBODY DARED TO REVIVE ITX IN FACT, THE<br />
SUPPORT GIVEN To NORTH VIETNAM HAS COME NOT SO MUCH FROM<br />
CHINA BUT FROM THE SOVIET UNIONX IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A<br />
MISTAKE TO REGARD EVERY COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT AS PART OF<br />
A MONOLITHIC BLOC ACTING IN UNISON, SPEAK ING WITH ONE<br />
VOICEK THE WORLD IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT, IT NEVER HAS<br />
BEENK, THESE OVER-SIMPLIFIED VIEWS THE DOWNWARD THRUST,<br />
THE DOMINO THEORY HAVE LONG BEEN DISCREDITEDX -THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF SINGAPORE HAS RIGHTLY DISMISSED THE<br />
DOMINO THEORY AS " tOLD HASH" K WE DON'T HELP AUSTRALIA'S<br />
CAUSE, WE DON'IT MAKE AUSTRALIA STRONG OR SECURE BY RETURNING<br />
TO OLD FALSEHOODS AND OLD MISLEADING MYTHSA OUR REAL<br />
INTERESTS AND OUR REAL STRENGTH LIE IN A CALM EXAMINATION<br />
OF THE REAL SITUATION)( m v 3/ s </p>
<p>-3-<br />
OUR STRENGTH, OUR SECURITY REST ON FACTORS AND<br />
RELATIONSHIPS ULTIMATELY UNCHANGED BY EVENTS IN INDO-CHINAX<br />
THE REALLY IMPORTANT RELATIONS ARE THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN<br />
DEVELOPED BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SINCE DECEMBER 1972<br />
OUR RELATIONS WITH OUR CLOSEST AND LARGEST NEIGHBOUR<br />
INDONESIA, OUR RELATIONS WITH OUR GREATEST TRADING PARTNER<br />
JAPAN, OUR RELATIONS WITH CHINA, OUR ACTIVE SUPPORT FOR<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF CO-OPERATION BETWEEN ASEAN MEMBERS, OUR<br />
EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THE INDIAN OCEAN DOES NOT BECOME THE<br />
NEXT AREA OF CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE SUPER-POWERSZ(<br />
ABOVE ALL, AUSTRALIA'S SECURITY, AS WITH THE PEACE OF THE<br />
WORLD, RESTS ULTIMATELY UPON MAKING THE DETENTE BETWEEN<br />
THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION A SUCCESS AND WITH<br />
ASSOCIATING CHINA IN A WIDER DETENTE) THESE ARE THE<br />
GREAT RELATIONSHIPS AND THE GREAT FACTORS WHICH DETERMINE<br />
THE SECURITY OF AUSTRALIAX THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HS<br />
BEEN UNREMITTING IN ITS EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THOSE<br />
RELATIONSHIPS( OUR SUCCESS IN DOING SO IS THE REAL<br />
GUARANTEE OF AUSTRALIA'S LONG-TERM SECURITY)<br />
END </p>
