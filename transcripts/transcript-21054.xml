    <content><![CDATA[<p>  Les Hollings will be warmly remembered as a journalist who adopted a crusading and fearless approach to promoting issues he believed were in the national interest.</p>
<p> As editor-in chief of  âThe Australianâ he was devoted to advancing the paper's role as a truly national newspaper.</p>
<p>I remember him well from my early years as an Opposition Leader. Never reluctant to express a view, Les always took a positive and constructive view about Australia';s future.</p>
<p>He set an example to generations of journalists through strong leadership and high ethical standards.  As a lively participant in national debates and a passionate Australian, he was a staunch advocate over many years for internationalising the Australian economy.</p>
<p>In particular, Les was very committed to labour market deregulation as a means of boosting national productivity and international competitiveness.</p>
<p>In retirement he continued to write a lively column for News Limited Sunday publications.</p>
<p>I extend deepest sympathy to his wife, Joan and sons, Stephen and Nicholas.</p>
