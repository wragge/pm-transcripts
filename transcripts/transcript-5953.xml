PTME INISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 26 OCTOBER 1982<br />
MR JEFF KENNETT<br />
I should like to congratulate Mr Jeff Kennett on his<br />
election as Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party in<br />
Victoria and Leader of the Opposition.<br />
Mr Kennett has been the Member for Burwood in the<br />
Legislative Ass: embly since 1976, and scrved effectively,<br />
as the Minister for Housing and 1he Mi; ister for<br />
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs between 1981 and 1.982.<br />
He is the youngest Parliamentary leader in Australia and<br />
his youth will bring with it a dyn. mir-. and freshness of<br />
ideas which will play a major role in regaining<br />
Government in Victoria.<br />
The Liberal Party in Victoria has a very great:<br />
responsibility to oppose with great vigour the big<br />
spending, high tax policies which the Cain Government<br />
has introduced in its recent budget. These policies can<br />
only do enormous damage to the Victorian economy. They<br />
will undermine the living standards of Victorian<br />
families and they will harm business confidence and<br />
investment prospects.<br />
Mr Kennett will not only oppose those policies<br />
effectively and with vigour, I am sure he will lead the<br />
Liberal Party back to Government at the next State<br />
election. ooo000Oooo---</p>
