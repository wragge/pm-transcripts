    <content><![CDATA[<p>Well gentlemn, I an sorry to have kept you waiting. We haven't been dallying I assure you, but there has been much to be done, and rather than hold you up whil I make a lengthy statement  an anything, I intend to give the discussion over to you for questions first  - answers by me if I can provide them.</p>
<p>But there is one matter which I would like to open up with you,  and you will be aware right through this campaign that there Is very little coming from the A. L. P. leaidership, or for that matter spokesman for the ALP about the detail of their Defence, policy. Mr. Calwell did include some very brief passages in the Policy Speech but there's been no attempt at definition of their proposals in the course of the campaign until we  find that in this last week of the campaign, we have the Deputy Leader, Mr Whitlam, putting an interpretation on their policy which I feel sure will come as surprise to Mr. Calvell and certainly is entirely inconsistent with the general view that Mr. Calwell has been putting thoughout the campaign.</p>
<p>He has made it clear that his intention is to bring Anstralian forces In Vietnam back to Australia - the National Servicemen or consscripts - immediately . isediatelys or as oon as practicable, and<br />the remainder after cossultation with our allies. in one<br />speech I think It will be agreed that he made it evident that<br />the consultation Itself was not a consultation likely to lead<br />to a retestioa of Australian forces In Vietnaim: it would<br />mezely relate to the seams of their withdrawal, and the timing<br />of their withdrawal. Andi indeed, it might very wall be the<br />case that seeing tha. Australia has been allotted an area of<br />responsibility related to the strength of the task force that<br />ones the National Service component which in some musteriavs<br />would be a very substantial proportion of the total, had been<br />withdrawn, those that remained might find themselves incapable*<br />not merely of carrying oujt the responsibilities of the area,<br />but of even defending their ova position In the area, and consultation<br />could In the result relate to the security with<br />allied assistance, of our oa remainder of regulax forces left<br />there.</p>
<p>66/ 120 6<br />PIgBss ( cont.)<br />That is oe aspect of the matter which I think should be<br />mentioned. The other is this interpretation which Mr. Vkktlanv<br />apparently without consultation of his Liert and certainly<br />without any prior Indication from any policy-naking source of<br />the Labor Party has put on the policy that they would pursue<br />but I an particularly referring to this evening those other<br />matters are of Importances they havem't quite the sam novelty<br />as one report attributed to Mr. Cainell ' Viicb I have only<br />won In ona 2iaper,, but it : is a paper which I an sure Mr. Fitchatt<br />would accept as an authoritative source, and that Is the Sydney<br />Morning Herald. I vould gatber from it that It proceeds from<br />the representative of the paper accompanying Mr:. Calwall. It<br />0 appeared in my edition anyhow,, of the Sydney Morning Herald<br />thisa morning.<br />It is headed " CALWMLL PLANl FOR W1 ' LIKS HAflI4L~ GLUM41<br />and headed " 2ownsvilles Mondayt" or at least under that<br />heading appears " Tosville ) tonay. A Citizen Military Force<br />of between 120,000 and 1401,000 mm ms suggested tonight by<br />the Opposition Leader, Mr. A. A. Calvall. This force would be<br />in addition to regular forcesi at about the present level.<br />Mr. Cal" 6ll" ( and I am qjuoting from the repori., of course)' vwas<br />ijivin3 his first defimitica' ( I stress that -his first<br />fefiniiion. of his Defence proposals since his J'olicy Speech<br />11 days agO and itts because of this categorical statmuiet<br />by the writer that I asszume be's somebody vftovs been ac ; nipaaying<br />Mr. Calwall on his tour. I don't vouch for thatv but that's a<br />reasonable assuaptiou to make from the text. He said'tie<br />Australia&amp; Cliizn Forces would need between 120,000 and 140,000<br />men in all services If I'm sorry, " The Australian Clixizen<br />Force would need b~ eten 120,000 and 140,000 men In all services<br />if It were to be given ' Ireal teeth" like the A.', rican Natioxal<br />Gjard," land again I give what Is put in the quotation invorted<br />comas therefore, attributable ' to him, " The American Nationial<br />Gi'ard files supersonic aircraft and contains Armoured divisions"<br />He said ' t is a fallacy to ' think of the part-timer as unskilled.<br />The Citixen Forces should surely be given a chance to show their<br />paces. The should be given special bonuses ( just tell<br />ne if Iv'a going too f ast a n this, you can have the text<br />later) the 04? should be given special bonuses such as<br />housing loam. ad education grants to assist recruiting.",</p>
<p>66/ 207<br />mrlssS ( cant.)<br />CaluVll Said a Lbbor Goverznent would reintro duc* the Citixm<br />Airforce, the Cbvernentfs Defence Policy bed, failed to<br />attract sufficient volunteers yet vast numbers of those vho did<br />vol unteer for service ithin Australia mare turned away on<br />educational grounds. Mr.* Clell said the Goerets*<br />Military adviser* should examixe the practicability of bringing<br />tbese am si to a Ilassable standard of educadon. during; the<br />first 12 months of their training. This would give then an<br />attractive Armed Jervices Career in which they could take a<br />pride. have no sympathy for a Government which Shouts about<br />threats to Australia and the admits it cannot get enough<br />O volunteers r Mr. Colwell sad.*<br />110ur Armed Forces ame is such a pathetic condition that if the<br />whiole lot war* thrown into s&amp; me overseas action they could make<br />so significant contribution. ws really have nothing with which<br />to dend our country. The Halt Governent to Defence establishme.<br />is a abobless that's viby we ame lsarning so heavily on<br />Americas policy."'<br />W&amp; el1, there's comment that could be mad* on all the latter<br />part but the significant aslict I think for Immediate purposes<br />is that here is a = w line of policy stateet which appears In<br />the IasM. week of the campaign. There Is no indication that It<br />has proceeded from any of the official policy-making sources<br />of the Labor Party. itsm going to give you in a noment the<br />actual, militia figures in the three services so that you'll<br />se what kind of an undortakin Ur. Calvell Is Putloing. I<br />have here the Defence Repor t for 1966g and you mill gather from<br />this tha neither of the two regular services of the Navy and<br />the Airforce rely to any substantial extent upon citissa force<br />components. The Navy at Jume 1966 had just under 3800, that is 3,717.<br />The Airforce at that points June 1966# had 665&amp; and the Army<br />had 32,702. The total in the CUitius Forces In three services<br />usn 36,708. Now there axe a few points to be made about<br />that.<br />One. Is, of course, that the Army strength has been greatly<br />Increased In the O43 as a result of the choice * 2ich Is now<br />available for those who would peefier to join the OWI to<br />taking the risk of being ballotted Into National Service under<br />the National Service Schm arrangementes and if you look at th C</p>
<p>66/ 208<br />PVR3 _( cont.)<br />figjur&amp; for June 1965 wheup as~ I understand it, the National<br />Service Scw bocame effective# the figure then VMS 38,146,1<br />&amp; Wd the year befare 27,500, the year before that 27,300 -so<br />It** pretty clear that this Sharp lift of just on 4,000 betwen<br />1965 and 1960 was attributable to the Incentive that -Ji<br />ewdstae of the National 5ervice, ; de. provided.<br />Consequently, if you abandon Nationa" Services then I think<br />O'ie realistic tIjjx* to be looking at in relation to Xr.<br />Calwall's 320,000 to 140,000 is the figure of the total of<br />Zitizen Formes at j~ m 1965 ol 322632. Now a few points<br />immediately.. DO YOU MIND) IF? I HAVE A QtESIOff ? SR&amp; SIR? ARR VW AMIUING<br />3Y THIS nMA tVX1I GMF IS A FAILURB, OM R&amp; CRWIWS PR001IMUS<br />A FAILMS FOR THS W4 VDLB3.3 YOU HAVE T18 TM4E&amp; r OF H&amp; l'IOMtL<br />ZIWICM?<br />No. Jhaf.-w're saying is ' that the target for tbt CXrP is a<br />target of 35,000 at~ the present tim# e aid on the latest<br />figureS the dtizea FOce OXPectatica is ' that we Will have<br />9 reached that target by 1967.<br />DiO YXT7 S~ O ZM 4M Z R~ OUD BZ AT. 11BUUr Tro<br />PATRI01I, 14 OR " OM MOTIV .

T ARISING OU? 0W 21E FAC?<br />VIAT TUCE I~ rNa-MMONAL S: I= fLJXCON HAZ D3TIOa~ a0 l CaDi.<br />Wel, that ajl be so, bus, It vwant all that good4 in 1964<br />for example. o It no t Il'a saying that. undoubtea7~ the fact<br />that there mas a Natilaal Siervice Scheme has assisted in producing<br />the higher 460-tal and I doon' arguem by any means that the<br />schme has proved or the recruiting has proved failure,<br />because as at 1962 for example, it was less than. 21,000.<br />ittsi been moving up year by year until it has reached<br />this fiqj'r* of I'ma sorry, 1963: 27,000. It was Sairly<br />ea-4-ic around ' 63, ' 64, $ 65, youi aust have in mind that tlare<br />is a time period of service in the CKI, ad you have to replace<br />therefore, those that. are moving out* so whiat has kmppened in<br />the period from June ' 65 to ' 66 is, theaw's not really been a<br />replacamnt, of the normal wastage, but quite a significaut lift<br />in the strength of the forces, but what I ' a really wanting to<br />get at in this comet is that again you have Labor Party<br />policy undertaking which has mo relation to the realism of<br />our Current situation.</p>
<p>66/ 209<br />To train 120,000 to 140,000 people in Citixen mlilitary Forces,<br />particularly wbn you ' d removed from the Resgular Force that<br />National Service element aind therefore reduced your Regular<br />Force to betwen 24,000 &amp; Wd 25# 000 you'd need a very large<br />proportioa of your rgt4. ar force fox the trainin, of your<br />Citizen Military Force. Woi w" om of the liniting factors<br />w found when So set out to increase oa own Qegular Amy.<br />The number of %; he regular -omore experienced regular service-.<br />men sho had to b. allocated to trainiagg limited the contribution<br />we Mgrt able to Rake in respect of our Various Camitments and<br />if you're to have 120,000 to 140# 000# mail first of all there<br />are the various munitions and supplies, usiforms and equipment<br />required for such a vastly expanded force# and tham the draw am<br />the sklled persanil of the " gular Forces for their traning<br />fir. Calwall talks about training them in the use of supersonic<br />aircrafts and the otber arsoured divisions and so Sorth<br />in the Amrican Hational ( Garxd wall what sort of draw this<br />would make on Australiats comaratively limited resources of<br />a-uipmwnt of this kind# it it can be Anagined, although no.* o<br />could put a precise estimate on it.<br />ATcen clso I think, has to bedawn row Wrvv is that<br />by the criticisms, and analyses of their policies that on the<br />ong hand th Dputy Leader has sought to rationalise their<br />situatlun by adopting ini~ erprotatiuas which certainly have not<br />0: 00 * Q the south of the leader of the Party. On the other<br />hand, the Loader of the Party has coat up with a scheme which<br />Ila sure vill have struck Mr. * Whitlam with a* smuch su. rprise<br />as Mr. .4iitlants interpretation brought surprise to his Leader.<br />There's moLhing in ihat has been said, so far as Ila are,,<br />by any Labr spokesman earlier to suqggest that they had in corntemplation<br />a hiome force program* e of the order cf 120,000 o<br />140,000 man, so once agaia you get %, he vagueness of Labor's<br />proposals which T&amp; en spelled out by them reveal '-hemselves as<br />completely unrealisic. They sees to have bees panicbsd ino<br />making theso ruttift~ these proposals or these explanations<br />forward, and I think the public wifl treat them both sith<br />the reservation that they deserve and aem in theme agjain an<br />indicatios that the Labor Party basalt bought through its policy<br />sufficiently clearly to he Justified in giving being given<br />the responsibility for implasenting them.</p>

They know that the public has been troubled<br />by the prospect of Australian Porces being withdraw by the<br />concept of fortress Australias in which Australia would b'<br />looking to its om resources.<br />Mr. lItlm tried to answer this by pointiLg out that their<br />policy doesn't necessarily mean withdrawal of our regular forces,<br />Mr. alell on the other hand, who clearly intends that it should,<br />is driven to finding sm satisfactory anasmwr and be comes up<br />9 with a greatly expanded home guard. How, he kept saying that<br />he wouldn't reort to conscription for his purposes. e have<br />mployed all the methods that occurred to us including Laprove.<br />pay and conditions, various benefits for the militia and until<br />the introduction of National errvice it had produced a otal<br />of 28,000 as at June 1965, so what methods be proposes -to adopt<br />to get 120,000 to 140,000 are still wrapped in the mists of<br />mystery.
