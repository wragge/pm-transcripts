    <content><![CDATA[<p>
 At a meeting of Liberal Members of the House of Representatives held</p>
<p> tonight, it was unanimously resolved that the Government's nominee</p>
<p> for the position of Speaker would be the Rt Hon Ian Sinclair MP, Member</p>
<p> for New England.</p>
<p>  Mr Sinclair is the longest serving member of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p> He had a distinguished ministerial career in past Coalition Governments</p>
<p> and was for five years Leader of the Federal Parliamentary National</p>
<p> Party.</p>
<p>  I have no doubt that if endorsed by the Parliament, Mr Sinclair will</p>
<p> be a distinguished Speaker.</p>
<p>  3 March 1998</p>
