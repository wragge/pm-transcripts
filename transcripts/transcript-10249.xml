21 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO TIIE CHINESE AUSTRALIAN FORUM<br />
CHINESE NEW YEAR DINNER<br />
Dr Ang, to my many Federal and State parliamentary colleagues, other distinguished<br />
guests, ladies and gentlemen. Can I first of all thank you Doctor for the words of<br />
welcome and can I thank all of you for the warm welcome tonight. I decided a couple<br />
of months ago that I would like an occasion associated with the Chinese New Yea to<br />
address a large gathering of Australians including the goodly number of Australians of<br />
Chinese descent. To take the opportunity on the occasion of the Chinese New Year to<br />
do a number of things and the first and most important of those things on behalf of the<br />
Government of Australia and on behalf, therefore, of all of the people of Australia first<br />
and foremost to honour the enormous contribution that Australians of Chinese descent<br />
have made to the building of the modem Australia. The association of Chinese people<br />
with Australia is a very long association. There have been occasion in the past when it<br />
has not been a happy association. But to the great bulk of Australians the contribution<br />
of Chinese people has been generous, it has been immense, it has been impressive and<br />
it is very much part of the miracle which is modem Australia. Chinese people have<br />
brought to this country industry, integrity, a respect and commitment for the<br />
importance of the family in Australian society, a flair for entrepreneurial expertise,<br />
professional skills, entertainment skills, recreational skills. Indeed, in every walk of*<br />
Australian life in the 1990s we find Australians with a Chinese descent or a Chinese<br />
background and the particular association of Chinese Australians with the city of<br />
Sydney is very well known indeed. Sydney is a different city from what it was when I<br />
was born here in 1939 and grew up here through the 1940s and 50s. I didn't know<br />
many Chinese boys at Eariwood Primary School in the late 1940s-I did know one at<br />
Canterbury Boys H1igh School in the early 1950s. My children, by contrast, as they've<br />
gone at Primary School to Greenwich ' Public School and later to private school on the<br />
lower north shore they have known many and that is just a function of the changing<br />
character, the diversifying character of the modern Australia. 23/ 02/ 97 12: 39 Pg: I </p>

The other reason that I wanted to come here tonight, I wanted to take the opportunity<br />
of honouring the Chinese New Year, is to say something about the fundamentals that<br />
bind all of us together as Australians. I certainly agree with Dr Asug that there is no<br />
country in the world which has a finer appreciation of the values of freedom and<br />
openness and tolerance than does Australia.<br />
Aujstralia has its flaws, Australia has its blemishes, Australia has had its faures in the<br />
past but if you compare this country with the other nations of the world there arec many<br />
things about it which entitle us to boast of tolerance and openness and warm<br />
heartedness and of decency. Of course there are some within our ranks who harbour<br />
prejudice and bigotry and who do display intolerance whether it's on ethnic or racial<br />
grounds or other grounds. I want to say that for my part and for the part of my<br />
Government that that is no part of the true Australian spirit. Any manifestation of<br />
racism in our ranks is repugnant to everything for which Australia has always stood. It<br />
ought to be denounced, it ought to be identified and it ought to be guarded against.<br />
The other side of the equation, of course, is the remarkable tolerance and the<br />
remarkable receptivity and generosity that this country has displayed towards so many,<br />
especially over the last 30 or 40 years. It remains the case that in the late 1970s<br />
Australia took on a per capita basis more refu~ gees from war torn Indo-China than any<br />
nation in the world and that was a very special demonstration of the contribution and<br />
the generosity of the Australian community towards an area of very particular need. It<br />
is necessary that we debate issues of sensitivity, issues such as immigration, issues such<br />
as the character of Australia what contributes to the modem Australian personality and<br />
the modern Australian character. We recognise in the course of that debate that the<br />
composition of the Australian population has changed a great deal over the last 30 or<br />
years.<br />
We are a more diverse, we are a more vibrant, we are a more cosmopolitan, we are<br />
moire global, we are a more internationalised society-than what we were several<br />
generations ago. One of the many contributions that Australians of Asian, especially<br />
Chinese, decent make to the modem Australia are the links that they provide with the<br />
countries often of their birth and certainly of their family association. I've lost count of<br />
the number of Australians of Chinese descent who over the last couple of years have<br />
provided me with valuable insight into the culture and the politics and the attitude of<br />
countries within our region.<br />
Within a few weeks I'll be visiting mainland China, I'll be visiting the People's<br />
Republic of China. It will be the first visit that I've paid to the country as Prime<br />
Minister and the relationship between Australia and China is very important to my<br />
Government. I recognise that of the Chinese Australians here tonight, not all of you of<br />
course have come from the People's Republic. Many of you, perhaps a majority of<br />
you, haven't. And I know there is a variety of views in this room about the People's<br />
Republic of China as there are a variety of views about a whole lot of other issues.<br />
But nothing can gainsay the fact that the association between this country and the<br />
People's Republic is an important one. Our values on many political issues are<br />
different. Australia is an open democracy, the People's Republic is not. But we have<br />
very close and important economic and other ties, and it is the responsibility of any<br />
Australian government, be it a Liberal Government or a Labor Government to look<br />

always to Australia's national interest, and Australia's national interest lies in fostering<br />
the economic, the cultural and the other links that now exist between Australia and not<br />
only China but the Chinese diasporas in other parts of the world.<br />
So it is with those things in mind and with a determination to further build a pragmatic<br />
conmmonsense relationship built on mutual respect and on a recognition of the<br />
importance of welcoming China into the family of nations in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
It's on that basis that I will visit Peking, Beijing and Shanghai during Easter of this<br />
year. I spoke earlier, ladies and gentlemen, of many of the contributions that Chinese<br />
Australians had made to our country. It is impossible of course to think of the<br />
Australian economy, particularly the small business sector, without thinking of the<br />
contribution of so many entrepreneurs of Chinese and of Asian descent in this country.<br />
The lively way in which so many members of the Chinese Australian community have<br />
contributed to the building of the modern Australian economy is very widely<br />
recognised, it is very warmly appreciated and we wouldn't be the people we are, we<br />
wouldn't be the success we are, we wouldn't be the increasingly respected community<br />
that we are becoming amongst the economies of the world, had it not been for the<br />
contribution of so many of those members of the Chinese Australian community.<br />
I can't let an opportunity like tonight go by without expressing a few words of<br />
optimism about Australia's economic future. I don't pretend to you that all of the<br />
economic challenges that beset an industrialised nation such as Australia are behind us.<br />
We still have a rate of unemployment that is too high although recent figures are more<br />
encouraging than I thought they might be. We still have balance of payments problems<br />
although they are not as severe as they were three or four years ago. The level of<br />
business investment is high by any comparison over the last thirty years, and the latest<br />
advice I have is that the level of business investment in Australia at the present time is<br />
higher than what it was at the time of the resources boom at the end of the 1970s or at<br />
the time just before the recession and the stock market crash in the mid 1 980s.<br />
Company profits have shown a welcome upturn over the last few months. We have a<br />
rate of inflation which is lower than its been since the early 1 970s and we have home<br />
mortgage interest rates which are lower than they have been at any time since the late<br />
1960s.<br />
But more importantly than all of those things there is a greater sense in the Australian<br />
community now of the importance of this nation integrating herself not only into the<br />
economic infrastructure of the Asia Pacific region which is so important to Australia's<br />
future but indeed into the entire world. And I do have a sense of growing optimism<br />
and confidence about the state of the Australian economy and the medium term future<br />
of the Australian economy, because the fundamentals now are as good as they have<br />
been for decades. We do have low inflation, we have falling interest rates, we have<br />
very strong business investment, we have broken down some of the cultural inhibitions<br />
towards greater globalisation of the Australian economy, and in a few weeks time, I<br />
think probably about the middle of March, I'll be announcing a comprehensive<br />
response to an investigation into the impact of red tape and regulation on small<br />
business in Australia and I believe that the announcements the Government will make<br />
in that response will make a further very important contribution towards creating a<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Fax from better investment climate for small business in Australia, Because all of my political<br />
life I have believed very strongly in the role and the importance of small business in the<br />
Australian community. If we are ever to break the back of high youth unemployment,<br />
if we are ever to break the back of high unemployment in this country, it will be the<br />
small business sector and no other part of the Australian economy that is going to<br />
achieve that task.<br />
But tonight ladies and gentlemen is not an occasion to give any kind of lecture in<br />
macro or micro-economic policy. It is not an occasion to talk about the Gross<br />
Domestic Product or the implicit price deflator, or any other kind of graduated index,<br />
or even to speculate about what might happen on the Future's Exchange overnight. It<br />
is an occasion, above and beyond that, it is an occasion to honour and to celebrate and<br />
to respect the massive contribution that Chinese Australians have made to the modern<br />
Australia. And on behalf of that modern Australia, I[ want to say to all members of the<br />
Chnese community in Australia, you are an integral part of Australian society. You<br />
are welcomed, you are honoured, you are respected; your right to dignity, to security,<br />
to peace and to tolerance and respect is something which is part and parcel of what I<br />
regard as a civilised and acceptable Australia in the 1990s,<br />
It is part and parcel of Australian democracy to have vigorous exchanges and vigorous<br />
debate. Some of it on occasions is not the most intelligent of exchanges that one could<br />
be engaged in. But it is never part of civilised or acceptable or robust debate to think<br />
of people in terms of the colour of their skin or except in a humorous and entirely f'un<br />
loving way their country of origin.<br />
Australians are I believe a tolerant people. They are a fuandamentally very decent<br />
people, the most decent in the world, and I think the great majority of Australians hold<br />
very dear that most cherished of all of the Australian ethos, and that is the ethos of the<br />
fair go. And I want to say to all of you that a fair go for all is as much a part of the<br />
Australian ethos now as it has ever been. So to all of you have a very happy year of<br />
the ox. I hope all of you have the occasion during the year to have peace and<br />
prosperity and personal happiness and personal success. And once again on behalf of<br />
the wider Australian community and on behalf of my government can I say a word of<br />
very warm thanks and deep appreciation for the contribution that you have made to<br />
our country and how much a pleasure it is for me to celebrate with you our joint great<br />
good fortune and that is to celebrate the miracle together of being Australians.<br />
Thank you. Fa rom23/ 02/ 97 12: 39 Pg: 4 </p>
