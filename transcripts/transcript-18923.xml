    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>A little over 20 years ago, three men in Toronto, Canada, decided to act.</p>
<p>Responding to the senseless massacre of 14 female university students, Jack Layton, Ron Sluser and Michael Kaufman established a campaign that has gone on to become an international force for good.</p>
<p>A campaign; led by men, to end violence against women.</p>
<p>The White Ribbon movement reached our shores in 2003. And each year more and more Australian men pledge themselves to its principles.</p>
<p>More than 58,000 Australian men have now sworn an oath to reject violence in their own lives and speak up when they encounter it in the lives of others.</p>
<p>Some of Australia's first White Ribbon Ambassadors are still spreading the word in 2012.</p>
<p>Staying the course, driving cultural change. Continuing to act.</p>
<p>Refusing to accept the attitudes and behaviours that contribute to violence against women and girls.</p>
<p>Refusing to be silent, or to make excuses for other men.</p>
<p>To every Australian man, every partner, husband, brother, father, son, colleague and friend who takes the White Ribbon pledge, thank you.</p>
<p>The impact of your actions is real.</p>
<p>You challenge the behaviours and cultures around you.</p>
<p>You lead through example.</p>
<p>You look to your own behaviours, and inspire the men and boys around you to do the same.</p>
<p>Just two months ago in Melbourne, tens of thousands of people were galvanised by another atrocious act of violence against a young woman.</p>
<p>They marched peacefully through their community to say ‘no more'.</p>
<p>But to achieve a sustained reduction to violence against women and girls, every sector of the Australian community must act.</p>
<p>Everyone must take ownership and responsibility, in every home, in every workplace, every school, every campus, every church, and on every street.</p>
<p>That's where White Ribbon is so effective. It has evolved, growing out of, and involving, the communities of which it is a part.</p>
<p>Finding practical ways to raise awareness and change behaviour.</p>
<p>Practical actions like the White Ribbon pilot workplace project which is seeing the Australian Army, the AFL and ARL, government agencies and private-sector workplaces looking at their own cultures and exploring strategies to drive behavioural change.</p>
<p>Practical initiatives like the information day organised by students at Loftus TAFE, in Sydney.</p>
<p>Practical campaigns like the “See, Hear, Speak” campaign, which is raising awareness of workplace sexual harassment among Australia's youngest working men and women.</p>
<p>Practical sharing of expertise, like the inclusion of a White Ribbon Ambassador on the panel at a recent Victorian forum discussing violence against women with disabilities. </p>
<p>Practical on-the-ground work like this, deep in the community, is crucial.</p>
<p>It encourages open conversation, often the first step towards real change.</p>
<p>Conversation and collaboration is also going on at the governmental level, through the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children and a new action plan, released in September.</p>
<p>But just as crucial as practical exertion and action is robust research.</p>
<p>In May next year White Ribbon will hold an international conference in Australia for the first time, in a bid to connect research, policy and practice.</p>
<p>Today it gives me pleasure to announce that my Government will support this important Australian ‘first', with funding through the Women's Safety Agenda.</p>
<p>I hope that the lessons from this conference will be shared widely and help inform future White Ribbon initiatives.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations and thanks to all of the White Ribbon Ambassadors here today, including the Ambassadors here in the nation's Parliament.</p>
<p>Your leadership is important, your example essential, if, as a community, we are to really bring about the changes that will ensure the greater safety of Australian women and girls, tomorrow and in the future.</p>
