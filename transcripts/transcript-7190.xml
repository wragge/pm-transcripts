PROME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
RURAL POLICY LAUNCH<br />
BUNDABERG 25 JUNE 1987<br />
Two days ago at the Opera House in Sydney I had tho honour<br />
of launchinj our Government's campaign for a renewed mandate<br />
from the Australian people.<br />
Today, another honour falls to me. That is to outline our<br />
policies and set our goals for the great rural sector of<br />
this nation.<br />
But let ne first repeat the central issue at stake on the<br />
11th of July the central issue for all Australians,<br />
wherever they live in this nation of ours.<br />
And it is t^ hs:<br />
Are we to continue to unite together in the task of national<br />
renewal, reconstruction and revitalisation, for which we<br />
have been wo. king so hard together, and on which the success<br />
of our country depends?<br />
Are we to go forward with strength and stability stability<br />
in government, stability in our society?<br />
Or are we to take the other course, the path of our<br />
opponento inflicting upon the nation itself all their own<br />
divisions, al their own disunity, all their own<br />
instability?<br />
That is the paramount issue in this election. It<br />
encompasses all other issues.<br />
Today, in Bundaberg I want to spell out my Government0<br />
record and policies of particular interest to the five<br />
million Australians who live outside the capital cities.<br />
But my first message to you today must be this that when<br />
in Sydney X used the words " the Australian people" I was<br />
speaking to the whole nation and I was referring to all the<br />
Australian people, wether they live in Bankstoun or<br />
Bundaberg. </p>
<p>This Government rejects the view that policies should appeal<br />
to one section of the community by damaging another should<br />
advance the interests of a few by setting back the interesto<br />
of the majority.<br />
That is not the way we have governed.<br />
It is not the way we are campaigning.<br />
Instead, my Government has taken decisions to advance the<br />
interests of the whole community, the future of the wholo<br />
nation.<br />
And never has the approach been more important, more<br />
relevant, than in the last two years.<br />
Through no fault of Australian farmers or Australian miners<br />
the world suddenly began paying us much less for our primry<br />
exports. Despite their hard work, their efficiency, Australia's<br />
agricultural producers were dealt a body blow by the corrupt<br />
trading practices of our European, American and Japanocse<br />
trading partners.<br />
Our export prices collapsed and our national income wao<br />
slashed by some $ 9,000 million. The collapse opened up a<br />
large gap between the amount we ac a nation spend abroad and<br />
the amount we earn abroad.<br />
This in turn meant we had to offer higher interest rates an<br />
the international money market to bridge that gap.<br />
So the problem of high domestic interest rates is a direca<br />
consequence of our trading deficit.<br />
My Governnsnt has set about the task of closing that gap<br />
and, whilo doing that, spreading the burden of adjustment<br />
more fairly across the community.<br />
Exactly a year ago, in my Address to the Nation, I said<br />
this: ' We all have to adjust to the loss in our national<br />
income through the fall in commodity prices. It is not jest<br />
for the farmers and the other exporters to carry the loss.<br />
We all havo to share the burden."<br />
Now, twelve months later, when our work together is bringing<br />
its benefits and rewards within our reach, they, too, will<br />
be shared fairly.<br />
And the policies that deliver these benefits to the country<br />
dweller are precisely the same as the policies that deliver<br />
them to the city dweller.<br />
There can bo no escaping this fundamental interdependence of<br />
our urban and non-urban communities. ' V </p>
<p>So the solutions to the problems posed by conditions in the<br />
world market must also recognise this interdependence.<br />
In the past, when there were balance of payments problems,<br />
conservative Australian governments resorted to<br />
short-sighted, divisive, counter-productive measures such ac<br />
protection and regulation.<br />
That is an approach I will never countenance.<br />
Rather, my government adopted an historic new approach, an<br />
approach which has two essential and complementary elemento.<br />
First, we have set about the task of restructuring the<br />
Australian economy to make it more competitive, more<br />
diverse, and more able to provide secure jobs and rising<br />
living standards.<br />
Second, we have launched an onprecedented international<br />
effort to reduce the agricultural protectioniso with which<br />
our trad. no partners are afflicting their own economies and,<br />
consequently, the Australian economy.<br />
Neither of these tasks is easy and in neither can results be<br />
achieved overnight.<br />
But in both we are making substantial progress. And in both<br />
the long torm prospects are encouraging.<br />
And here 2ot me pay tribute to my Minister for Primary<br />
Industry, John Kerin.<br />
No Prime inister could be b2tter served in the<br />
administration of this important portfolio than I am by<br />
John.<br />
And more importantly at no stage in recent history has the<br />
rural comiunity been better cerved by its Minister.<br />
He has, as I believe you know, built a special rapport,<br />
based on fairness and frankness and sheer hard work which<br />
has resulted in no small measure in the progress we are<br />
making. Our decision in 1983 to float the dollar has given the<br />
Australian economy the greatest competitive boost in living<br />
memory. Had the currency not been floated had we still been stuck<br />
with the over-valued exchange rate of our predecessors<br />
farmers vould have been devastated by the subsequent<br />
collapse in commodity prices.<br />
The task of maintaining this competitiveness in the face of<br />
our primary commodity collapse has required some tough<br />
decisions on our part and has imposed sacrifices on the<br />
community.<br />
: I I </p>
<p>Farmers were among those who bore the impact of the<br />
unavoidable rise in interest rates.<br />
But we quickly began to share the adjustment burden through<br />
our wages policies and a further toughening of fiscal<br />
policy. We had to seek further real wage restraint from the<br />
Australian workforce. And we are~ achieving that real unit<br />
labour costs are now around 8 per cent lower than in Ilarch<br />
1983.<br />
we supported these efforts throuo very large reductions. in<br />
the Budget deficit, which we will have progressively brought<br />
down from~ the prospective 5 per cent of Gross Domestic<br />
Product we inherited to under 1 r-r cent next year.<br />
These efforts are starting to yield dividends.<br />
As I said on Tuesday, inflation Is falling and under Labor<br />
will continue to fall.<br />
Interest rates are falling and unlar Labor w~ ill continuo to<br />
fall.<br />
Last month'G balance of payment figures, which showed a<br />
current account deficit below the bottom of the range of<br />
market expectations, have given further ionetus to the fall<br />
in interest rates as representaives of most of the major<br />
banka have zcknowledged.<br />
And throug., hout this whole period of difficulty and<br />
challenge, jobs have continued to grow 100,000 In the last<br />
six months and 800,000 overall.<br />
And under Labor jobs will continu2 to grow.<br />
But thic woul. d all be undone in one devastating stroke if<br />
the various opposition parties were ever to be given the<br />
chance to implement their various tax policies.<br />
I have said on several occasions and I repeat here today<br />
that the various tax policies of the Opposition parties have<br />
one thing in common : they would tear apart the economic and<br />
social fabric of this country.<br />
Friends, it is just impossible, with any credibility, to<br />
proclaim concern for families and then proceed to smash<br />
every part of, the social infrastructure that determines the<br />
welfare of Australian families. Yet that is the measure of<br />
our opponents' hypocrisy.<br />
Not only would they force Australians to pay more for health<br />
insurance and give them less, not only would they limit our<br />
children's education opportunities through bigger class<br />
sizes, not only would they let the roads deteriorate, but<br />
they would Gtrike down Australiam farmers through<br />
skyrocketing interest rates. </p>
<p>/ And this is the reason the Liberal Party's tax policy, now<br />
embraced by the Federal National party, does not add up.<br />
That is not simply an observation of mine or Paul Keating's,<br />
it is a conclusion of commentators throughout the country<br />
the latest of these being Dr Neville Norman, who estimates a<br />
shortfall in the order of $ 2.5 billion.<br />
John Howard has said repeatedly that he would not put his<br />
name to a tax policy that did not add up. Now he has<br />
admitted that his tax policy doesn't add up. And Mr<br />
Sinclair has endorsed that policy.<br />
The Liberal/ National Parties' tax polices would blow out the<br />
Budget deficit. And the inevitable consequence of that is<br />
soaring interest rates a return to their days in<br />
Government when short term interest rates exceeded 22 per<br />
cent. And for what?<br />
For a grab bag of tax promises that would put hundreds of<br />
dollars a week back into the pockets of the wealthy. The<br />
incomes of moot rural Australians are not high enough to<br />
derive any significant tax benefit from the Opposition's<br />
proposals. Rural Auctralians would be the big losers from the<br />
Opposition's tax policies.<br />
My friencds<br />
Our succocc has been based on co-operative endeavours<br />
between cnployers, employees and governments to resolve the<br />
problems facing each industry problems such as the legacy<br />
of regulation and protection from past conservative<br />
governmentc. In this pgeat task of reconstruction, it is vital to<br />
appreciate that the challenge of modernisation is not just<br />
something that can be met by factories in Melbourne and<br />
Sydney.<br />
Australia's great primary industries, including our<br />
agricultural industries, are also caught up in the action.<br />
Our farrers must respond to the need to restructure their<br />
industries, modernise their methods and endeavour where<br />
possible to add value to their raw materials by further<br />
processing within Australia.<br />
Increasingly, as manufacturing becomes more competitive, it<br />
is becoming more closely tied to its primary sector inputs<br />
as we enhance the further processing within Australia of our<br />
primary products.<br />
A vivid specific example of our achievements in encouraging<br />
downstrean processing can be found in our plan to modernise<br />
the textile, clothing and footwear industry. </p>
<p>Already, the proportion ol our wool exports that have been<br />
subject to the first stages of processing has increased by<br />
over Zifteen per cent since we came to office. This is<br />
clear-y the way Australian industry should go in the future.<br />
Australia's forestry industries also have great potential<br />
for further development ia an environmentally sensitive<br />
manner to reduce imports, provide jobs and reduce land<br />
degradation. Reflecting the Labor Government's commitment to its forestry<br />
policy objectives we will introduce a new broad acre<br />
afforestation program, with emphasis on native hardwoods.<br />
The program will have the complementary objective of<br />
assisting the reclamation of areas subjected to land<br />
degradation. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
All tc, 3e developments lead me to the second of the two<br />
elemonto of Labor's historic approach to reinvigorating the<br />
economy that I referred to a moment ago.<br />
The fundamental truth is that our future prosperity depends<br />
on trade. For all our efforts at economic reform at home,<br />
our sUccess depends critically on the policies and attitudes<br />
of ou: trading partners.<br />
As a nation, Australia has been at the forefront of efforts<br />
to stop the insane agricultural trade war.<br />
te used our good relations with the United States to send<br />
two all-party delegations of Members of Parliament to<br />
Washington to lobby Congress on its Farm Bill.<br />
Senior Hlinisters, including myself, have frequently pressed<br />
the Americans, the Europeans and the Japanese to reform<br />
their acricultural policies and to liberalise international<br />
agricultural trade.<br />
we organised the " Cairns Group" of 14 fair traders of<br />
agricultural products which succeeded for the first time in<br />
getting agriculture as a priority item on the agenda for the<br />
new round of multilateral trade negotiations.<br />
The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has prepared detailed<br />
studios which clearly identify the costs of agricultural<br />
protectionism not only to Australia and to underdeveloped<br />
countries, but, let us never forget, to the protectionist<br />
nations themselves.<br />
This was the argument I put to the World Economic Forum in<br />
Davos, Switzerland, in January. I called for a ceasefire in<br />
the trade war and a commitment to early reductions in the<br />
gap between artificial, protected, prices for farm products<br />
and the real prices those goods would earn in a free market. m </p>
<p>,1 7.<br />
Since launctIing that initiative at Davos, I have been<br />
pleased to see that events are starting to march in the<br />
right direction.<br />
The recent neeting of OECD Ministers endorsed the major<br />
elements o. the proposal. The Cairns Group had a successful<br />
meeting in Canada and called on the Big Seven leaders to<br />
take action at their Summit in Venice. As further evidenco<br />
that the Cai: ns Group has become a vital third force in<br />
agriculturvl diplomacy, declaration of that Venice Summit<br />
did in fact echo the long-term proposals sought by fair<br />
trading nati. ons like Australia.<br />
Perhaps noT, here can our efforts to restructure the<br />
Australian Pronomy and reform international trade be seen<br />
more cleariv than in the sugar industry.<br />
The sugar industry, which plays such an important role in<br />
the economy of this region, was the first to suffer the full<br />
effects of the trade war. And it has been one of the<br />
hardest hit 1y decades of ad hoc State Government regulation<br />
which inhibited its ability to respond to that challenge.<br />
So my Govezn:' ent sought a co-operative approach with<br />
industry, tnuloyees and State Governments involving the<br />
phased removal of the most damaging regulation, combined<br />
with price oapport and special adjustment funding for the<br />
industry.<br />
The basic elements of this program have been implemented<br />
through our $ 100 million three year sugar assistance<br />
package, wUih is placing the industry on a stronger, more<br />
competitiv2 basis for the future.<br />
To lend fvrther momentum to the industry, I want to announce<br />
another initiative today. My Government has passed<br />
legislation to enable the establishment of a Sugar Industry<br />
Research Fund and I can now give a firm commitment that the<br />
next Labo: Government will ensure funds will be provided to<br />
match sugi: industry research funding.<br />
This sort of research is an effective vehicle for long-term<br />
reductions in farm costs a task my Government has embarked<br />
upon from its, first days in office.<br />
The rate of increase in costs to farmers has fallen steadily<br />
from 11 per cent in 1982-83 to an expected 4 per cent in<br />
1987-88.<br />
Tariffs on iarvesting and cultivation equipment have been<br />
replaced pith bounties while our chemicals industry package<br />
is halvinq the tariff protection provided to agricultural<br />
chemicals. These are in addition to the $ 260 million<br />
benefit bc-% ng received by primary producers from the full<br />
rebate of the diesel fuel excise. </p>
<p>8.<br />
We have decided to send a further reference to the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission on farm machinery and<br />
machinery parts with the aim of taking further measures to<br />
reduce fara costs.<br />
Similarly, we are acting to reduce costs to farmers after<br />
the farm gate.<br />
A Royal Comrission is currently investigating the storage,<br />
handling and transport systems used by the grain industry.<br />
And I can tell you, we will not allow the Report of this<br />
Commission to gather dust.<br />
Other transport initiatives have included major reforms to<br />
regulations governing air freight charter for primary<br />
produce0 review of liner shipping policy, establishment of<br />
Task Forces to reduce the burden of shore-based shipping<br />
costs, and record road funding.<br />
Revamped export inspection arrangements, including the<br />
eliminaticn of dual inspection, have reduced inspection<br />
costs by $ 17 million per year.<br />
Notwithstanding the importance of these initiatives,<br />
probably the greatest reduction in off-farm costs has come<br />
from our industrial relations policies.<br />
Ve have weCuced the level of industrial disputation in<br />
Australia by 60 per cent. In the important transport and<br />
communi. catono inductries, there has been an 80 percent<br />
reduction ' Ln industrial disputation since we came to office.<br />
Friends<br />
Let me return to the point I made at the outset Australia<br />
is not a divided nation and the policies with which it is<br />
governed must not be divided.<br />
All Australian families whether they are urban or rural<br />
dwellers, still expect and deserve the basic services which<br />
only governmcnt can provide.<br />
Poverty and : hardship know no boundaries between city and<br />
country. Labor will continue to put the health of Australian families<br />
first, by aintaining our commitment to Medicare.<br />
We will continue to help the aged and disabled. We will<br />
boost education and training opportunities for our young<br />
people.<br />
And we will take on a new, and a great task.<br />
We will see to it that by 1990 no Australian child will be<br />
living in poverty. </p>
<p>And to thi7 ene, my Government will establish a new program<br />
of family ;, cip a program designed to lift more than one<br />
million Auj , ralian children into security, and to help the<br />
more than a million Austraiian families in greatest<br />
need, the ' bcLrdest pushed, the most disadvantaged, the<br />
battlers. Labor's nev. 7amily Allowanco Supplement will be paid, to<br />
mothers, on the basis of farrily income and family size.<br />
The Family Allowance Supplement will total $ 22 per child per<br />
week with an extra $ 6 a week for children aged between<br />
thirteen auz-l fifteen.<br />
We will al3o take new steps to help disadvantaged families<br />
in private : ented accomnmodation.<br />
And we wil;.. ' urther recognisc the special needs faced by<br />
families w-' hA children who are disabled.<br />
Rural pecp.',: 17:. x a particular disadvantage, coopared with<br />
metropolitz.. r res-identG, in respect of the information they<br />
have abount C:.-vernr. ent services for which they may be<br />
eligible. This is s e2alytrue of iural women. Dorothy flosG, the<br />
Nationa*.. P7-odent of ti~ e Country WomenG1 Association raiGed<br />
this di ic wiith me c2arly iast ycar, and X accepted her<br />
suggestion t'It a survey of ural women's needs be<br />
conductoc3. Jhe sii! vcri rcsu~ t will be released later this<br />
year. Let Ms tako -hi s opportunity to thank Dorothy Ross and<br />
indeed, al'. he women who participated in the survey, for<br />
the insicW-i and suggestions they have given uo about the<br />
delivery c tjoverninent services.<br />
In part, a response to thesc expressed needs of women,<br />
the Gover.. icnt wi"' l also move to establish a Commonwealth<br />
Services ICmtonSyst:? m a national network designed<br />
especially to provide country people with this crucial<br />
information.<br />
While we &amp;: ce going about the task of improving and<br />
co-ordinatinq services to the rural community, the<br />
opposition s.! ems to be deternined to restrict them.<br />
For example, the Liberals opposed in the Senate our<br />
legislaticvn designed to extend to rural residents the same<br />
level of cc. itercial TV services available in the cities.<br />
Ladies and 9r ntlemen<br />
The achievei-ants and policies I have outlined today have<br />
created the basis for a healthy, competitive future for<br />
Australia's great primary industries and for the whole<br />
economy. </p>
<p>Together, we have been through very trying times on world<br />
markets. But I can confidently assert that my Government<br />
has set in train the measures to modernise and restructure<br />
the econoiay so as to meet these challenges.<br />
And, abona all, we are building a fair nation a nation<br />
where all can reap the rewards of their own efforts, and<br />
where all can share in the rewards of the national effort.<br />
Friends,<br />
The Australian Labor Party is proudly campaigning with these<br />
words as our theme :" Lets stick together. Lets see it<br />
through". Those words encapsulate the broad meaning of this task of<br />
economic Kevitalisation in which we are engaged and in which<br />
we must succeed.<br />
it captvrEo also the manner in which we are carrying out<br />
that prcco~ s fairly, compassionately, in the interacts of,<br />
all Australians.<br />
we are carrying it out together and must see it through<br />
together. Farmer an-t. factory worker together.<br />
Iiner and M~ anufacturer together.<br />
Country Ct;. ller and city dweller together.<br />
Lets see it through. 0* </p>
