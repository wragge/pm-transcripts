TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERE4CZ, BLAIR HOUSE, WASHINGTON#<br />
OWlE l9S9<br />
Z A 13-PROOF ONLY<br />
PM4: Well I would like to say at the outset how indebted to<br />
President Bush. He's made so much of his time available<br />
today at Camp David and then on the golf course. obviously<br />
we covered a great range of subjects, I think we spent more<br />
time talking on China than any other single issue. i am<br />
p leased to say that the position of the President and myself<br />
is at one. That is that of course firstl. y, we totally<br />
tnnfldAn 4hp h,. rhn'rtsm that has been exhibited by tho Chincoa<br />
leadership in the putting down of peaceful protests in their<br />
country and the continued persecution of those who've been<br />
involved with peaceful demonstrations. At the same time we<br />
recognise that it is the interests of China that the<br />
processes of economic reform should continue and therefore<br />
there is as T said before and the President agrees with me<br />
-that there's a fine line has to be walked between<br />
continuing our condemnation of what has happened and trying<br />
to ensure that the West maintains a capacity to assist the<br />
processes of economic reform. We are agreed that that is<br />
precisely what needs to be done. We of course have the<br />
advantage of each of us having a particular knowledge and<br />
personal involvement with China the President from his time<br />
as Ambassador there and I of course in the lengthy<br />
discussion. I've had over many year. with the Chinese<br />
leadership and from our shared perspective* I think it-is-,<br />
important for Australia and the United States and the West<br />
generally, that we have this Identity of view a view which<br />
I may say is basically also being shared with me by the<br />
leadership in Prance and in Great Britain.<br />
other topics that we covered in our discussions were my<br />
regional initiatives with regard to the Asia Pacific region<br />
and I think I can say that there is a general support for our<br />
approach and I hope that together we will be able to advancethis<br />
initiative. Of course we are conscious of the need toensure<br />
that there is full support from the ASEAN group of<br />
countries. I thinkl tpqether we will be able, 2 hupzu, tu Ie<br />
that support so that by the end of the year we will be abyi.<br />
to have the ministerial meeting at which I have been aiming* </p>
<p>We had discussions also about the general quOstion of East-<br />
West relations and in particular the initiatives that the<br />
President has recently taken In the area of disarmament talks<br />
in the NATO context, I indicated the support Which I have<br />
given to that initiative and it is part of the wider<br />
constructive approach of the United States Administration in<br />
which President Bush has in his own-way and put his own stamp<br />
upon it now, continued the initiatives and approaches of his<br />
predecessor, President Reagan. I indicated to him that in<br />
these initiatives he has the full support of the Australian<br />
Covowrnment and wo Iaupe to see a continuation of those<br />
initiatives in the particular areas that they had raised in<br />
regard to conventional forces in Europe and also, of course,<br />
in the STARTr negotiations.<br />
I also discussed with the President the question of a<br />
Chemical weapons Convention because It is well known~ that the<br />
tDbosiieat has a J . jaaL-ruwtG in tflis matter. He<br />
raised the issue during his campaign. He is aware of and<br />
appreciates the degree of support which my Government has<br />
provided in this area generally and in particular on the<br />
conference that we will be hosting in Australia later this<br />
year in which Government and industry will be meeting to<br />
discuss the ways ina which together we can wurk towards the<br />
achiAvement of a relevant Convention.<br />
I also of course took the opportunity of talking with the<br />
President about our concerns in the area of agriculture and<br />
we had a very useful discussion about that, which of course<br />
is not yet completed. It will be the subject of talks that<br />
1' l11 have tomorrow and further talks on Tuesday with the<br />
President and also think there will be the opportunity of<br />
dincussing this issue with Mtembers of Congress in the next<br />
couple of days.<br />
I ale* talked with the President in regard to the Antarctic<br />
issues-and as we have known from the beginning, there has<br />
been no doubt that the United States seeing as it signed<br />
the Convention last, year has a particular view about it.<br />
The President was interested to hear our position. I<br />
indicated that I would be outlining our views through my<br />
address to the Press Club tomorrow and he understands this<br />
and believes that while there are the differences that we<br />
xnown between us, it in an area that we should continue to<br />
have discussi~ ons on over the weeks and the months * head, and<br />
we will do that*' </p>
<p>There are some other matters obviously that we talked about<br />
but in terms of major issess of substance those are the oese<br />
that took up most of our time, that is when we weren't<br />
together playing a very congenial game of golf.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you appear-to have been..<br />
PM: well I'm glad you noticed that. It is the case that if<br />
you look at the whole of this trip we've had remarkable<br />
ac. ean In France to the Prime Minister there, the President,<br />
znle roreign minister, ano ot course we couLa not nave tiaa<br />
greater access in the United Kingdom that we had there. Now<br />
this is our third stop and again, we are having remarkable<br />
acess to the leadership of the United States. My modesty<br />
doesn't permit me from saying that this has something to do<br />
with the personal relationships that I've been able to<br />
estabIsh now over six years as Prime minister and<br />
particularly in the case of my very good friend# George Bush.<br />
Our relationship goes back over the whole of that period of<br />
time. in his capacity as Vice President r got to know him<br />
very well, we formed a very firm friendship, there was mutual<br />
respect between us established, and in the case of Hazel a&amp;<br />
well. With Hazel and Barbara I think it is a very warm,<br />
personal rehlaLlu:, uhijj Lhat, we have iviLh ULe Durdi'm and I'm<br />
very uppreciative of the way in which quite obviously the<br />
President has made the decision that he would make not only a<br />
great deal of his own time available to me In the very<br />
congenial atmosphere of Camp David, as well an on the golf<br />
course, and again of course on Tuesday when I meet with him<br />
them in the formal visit sessions and when he gives the<br />
dinner on Tuesday night. it is indeed a remarkable access,<br />
I0m terribly grateful to him for it. It not only reflects<br />
the personal relationsnips zhaz j.' ve developed, buz also x<br />
think it reflects a judgement by the Bush Administration an<br />
in the case of the predecessor, Reagan Administration, that<br />
tho Hawke Government is one under which as they have said on<br />
the public record and privately, that the relations between<br />
AtiatrAlib and the United States have never been an a firmer.<br />
sounder, more constructive basis than they are now. We have<br />
worked at that because we believe that the alliance<br />
relationship between our two countries remains of<br />
foundational importance. I believe that we have a situation<br />
where that friendship based upon shared commitments to the<br />
same ideals has the flexibility, springing from the fact that<br />
we recognise one anothers integrity so that where we do have<br />
difference. we arm able to put them straight forwardly on the<br />
basis of a strong friendship. That has meant that this<br />
demonstration -an with the Reagan Administration respects<br />
our positions, the strength of our commitment to shared<br />
ideals, the way in which we in our region work to discharge<br />
the obligations that we have and in all relevant bilateral<br />
and multilateral forma, have ~ wod over the at imix yoara<br />
to advance shared cause. </p>
<p>( PM cont) So what we are witnessing on this visit is the<br />
outcome of all those things I believe.<br />
JOURALISTs Inaudible<br />
PM: I very clearly can't go into all the details of that but<br />
I think I do know in justice to my friend George Bush and the<br />
confidentiality of our discussions, if I say that we both<br />
recognise that if there were to be further moves particularly<br />
against student leaders, there is at this point have not been<br />
significantly involved in the executions that have been<br />
pursued that he has basically what people that were<br />
, A, vulved In the train incident in Shanghai and leaoers.<br />
But if there were to be significant moves against the student<br />
leaders then obviously there would have to be an appraisal by<br />
us of just where we went. What we both feel very strongly is<br />
that we need in our respective ways to make it clear to the<br />
Ciite e leuadurship that not only Is that sort of action<br />
morally unacceptable, but that it is profoundly against the<br />
SInterests ot a cnlina teat woulo wish to continue with the<br />
processes of economi reform and opening up to the rest of<br />
the world, It's very interesting to note that in the meeting<br />
which concluded yesterday of the which was a continuation<br />
of the CusiLral Cummittee and of the Politburo, that in<br />
the btaLumentu that came out of that, they indicated that<br />
proposals that they had and the second one was the intention<br />
to keep going the momentum of economic reform and opening up<br />
to the outside world. Now both the President and I agree<br />
that if they are going to be able to do those things and it<br />
is in the interests of China and the rest of the world as<br />
they should then they will make that the more difficult it<br />
they were in fact to proceed down the path of further<br />
executions.<br />
JOURMALUST; M PLim MLtaULUL Uould you mum Ui whAtL you maid<br />
before we arrived please?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, very well, I can say that we covered a<br />
range of subjects, the issue on which we spent most time was<br />
China, and I've indicated It in regard to that area of<br />
dinvussion, Lhat the rresident and A shared banically rho sme<br />
perspective, and that is firstly that the condemnation by our<br />
countries in the West of what they have done barbarically to<br />
s * urems dissent is unacceptable, that we should, within that<br />
framework however, try to ensure that the processes of economic<br />
reform and opening up to the rest of the world are able to<br />
continue. We recognise that will involve the walking of, an I put<br />
it, a tine line, but we do believe from a few perspectives that<br />
we have, and let me say, as I indicated that both the President<br />
and I have as fairly detailed and intimate knowledge of china, he<br />
from his period there as Ambassador, and I from long periods of<br />
detailed discussion in China and Australia with leaders of China,<br />
and Exam that diffoxunt, but aharod porapou tivu wo onjoy, wo aro<br />
at one essentially on this issue. I referred to the fact also<br />
that we talked about my regional initiative and I talked about<br />
that both with the President and to a limited extent Secretary of<br />
State. Dakeri and there is a-fundamental support-for the-concept<br />
that I: have advanced and I believe that together we will attempt<br />
to bring about a situation where we will be able to have the<br />
ministerial meeting before the end of this year which ha been<br />
hope that I have expressed now for some time. </p>
<p>Z aluo covered the subject of the Antarctic and there the<br />
President acknowledged our position as being different from<br />
LhlwJ.. TL was a vuay tiundly discussion and he acknuwledged<br />
that I would be putting our position while here, and while we<br />
did have a different perspective one of which we've of course<br />
known from the outset, certainly given the fact that they'd<br />
signed the convention of lact year we will oonider to discuss<br />
this issue to try to get outcomes which, as far as possible meet<br />
the shared basic objectives that we have. Also I discussed with<br />
him the question of the chemical weapons uonvention where it is<br />
acknowledged that the President has a personal interest in this<br />
issue and we of course have taken considerable initiative in this<br />
area, including the holding of a conference later this year in<br />
Australia and at Government and industry level. And it's our hope<br />
I can say that there will be moves towards the establishment of a<br />
oomprahonoivo chemical woaponc convention.<br />
We talked about also the question of agricultural policies here<br />
and the President acknowledged oux posiLion and expressed the<br />
hope that I would be putting our position quite clearly in both<br />
talks with the administration and anyone from the Congress that<br />
we would be meeting. I indicated we would do that. It is our hope<br />
our shared hope that in this matter that where we do have<br />
some differences, that there is no way that we will allow that to<br />
disrupt our relationship because our shared commitments on such a<br />
wide range of other issues are such that we would not allow that<br />
to happen. We do have equally shared commitments to try to ensure<br />
that the processes of the multilateral trade neqotiations shall<br />
go forward with a shared objective of trying to reach a position<br />
by the end of that round at the end of 1990 and where there will<br />
( PM cont) be a commitment to the elimination of the processes of<br />
subsidization which have distorted international trade and<br />
agriculture. Those are major issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the President put any particular view about how<br />
the regional initiative might evolve?<br />
PM: Well we've had some discussion and I don't want to go into<br />
detail as some of it is appropriate for further discussion<br />
between us. But I think they really axe at one with us and there<br />
will Vv the upju&amp; tuuaity 4. advawgi thi, at. 1| aSw IMIB Miaaiai a. l<br />
Council Meeting, where they of course will be represented, and of<br />
course we will. We will develop the idea further but we share the<br />
view that it does seem appropriate to aim for a ministerial<br />
meeting at the end of this year, and we will need to œ uzmulato in<br />
the period up ' til then the issues that we want to be dealt with<br />
by tho ministerial mooting. Thoy will be ioeau of tho<br />
composition of the group, the sorts of areas we want to be dealt<br />
with in a continuing sort of forum, and of course we agree that<br />
they are basically economic and trading issues because we are not<br />
looking at the establishment of some political grouping because<br />
essentially that function within the region is covered by ASEAN<br />
and the ABRAM post-ministerial council moting. so we are waiting<br />
a decision...<br />
JOURWALISTs Would we be hosting this ministerial meeting in<br />
hustraliat </p>
<p>PM Well that's to be decided. But I can say in the very<br />
extensive discussions that have been led on our part by Dick<br />
Woolcott the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade who has<br />
gone round to all these countries now, there does seem to be a<br />
view on the part of all the people that we've spoken to that<br />
Australia will probably host it. What we've said is well look,<br />
we're not saying it's got to be Australia, our concern is that<br />
the concept be developed. Of course if they would like us to host<br />
it and it seems to me to be a case that they would, then of<br />
course we are more than happy to do it.<br />
JOURNALISTi Do you have any fears that the Americans might gazump<br />
your idea and make it one of their own?<br />
PM Not at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you know what level the American<br />
participation will be<br />
P14: Have what meeting?<br />
JOURNALIST; The ministerial meeting.<br />
PM: Well it would be the equivalent of Ministers. I mean they<br />
would have to have a number of members of the administration<br />
whose interest would be involved in such a meeting and that would<br />
be for them to decide. obviously, if the meeting goes ahead and I<br />
hope it will, represented by the appropriate members of the<br />
administration. JOURNALIST: What do Americans particularly find attractive about<br />
the initiative?<br />
PM: Well simply that what I have done is to really process an<br />
idea that had been in a sense expoused by some people that<br />
Without ever doing anything about it that is that there is<br />
recognition that here we have the most dynamic growth region of<br />
the world the Asia-Placific region, and that quite clearly there<br />
can be advantages for members of that region if there is a<br />
Freater degree of understanding of the development within the<br />
individual economies of that region, the examination of the<br />
opportunities advancing the complimentarities of those economies,<br />
how we can togeither examine issues of trade and to be a further<br />
force for a liberalised international trading system, and thatrather<br />
than just having same ad hoc meeting to consider these<br />
issues, that there is some virtue in looking, not at the creation<br />
of some massive institution,, but there seems to be a view that itwould<br />
make sense to have at least some small institution coming<br />
out of those meetings that we are talking about, which would<br />
facilitate the on going consideration of those issues to which I<br />
have referred.<br />
JOURNALIST: ack on China, can you confirm that you and Mr Bush<br />
did discuss escalating action against the Chinese 2 </p>
<p>PM: Look# we didn't say if they continue how will we escalate<br />
action, itus putting the wrong emphasiz. What we have said iae I<br />
repeat, so that you get the context of it right. At one in total<br />
Condemnation of what's happened. At one in saying that it would<br />
be against the interests of the people of china, the region and<br />
of the world, however the aftermath of what happened that the<br />
world close down on China because if its driven in on itself,<br />
that will mean these things:<br />
That the processes of repression are more likely to continue;<br />
That the ability for economic reform would be very much more<br />
restricted because of the involvement of the rest of the world in<br />
those processes of reforms which is essential really if it's<br />
going to go ahead and we share the view that it in the more<br />
likely that political reform will come out of a situation where<br />
economic reform's going ahead. So what we were really saying was<br />
now no, if that doesn't happen, and there is an escalation of<br />
violence and executions what do we then do because it is our hope<br />
as a result of adopting the sort of attitudes that we've talked<br />
about that those things won't happen because there will be a<br />
realisation on the part of the Chinese authorities that if they<br />
go that far then we would have no alternative other then to take<br />
a more economically aggressive attitude.<br />
But we are hopeful that if that sort of situation arose, as we<br />
indicated to one another in our discussions, if the optimism that<br />
we share turns out not to be well founded, then in those<br />
circumstances we will have to talk together and with others about<br />
what the course of action will be.<br />
JOUMALIST: What grounds for optimism does the new leadership<br />
give you?<br />
P11: Well I wasn just sayi ng earlier, I don't know whether you were<br />
here, that in the statement that came out of the meeting that<br />
vent on from the 19th to the 21st the Central Committee Meeting<br />
and then they went to the Politburo -meeting, and out of those<br />
meetings there Came a statement which included, an one of the<br />
propositions, the view that economic reform should continue, and<br />
the opening of the outside world as part of the economic reform<br />
should continue. so it is in that sense hopeful that they will<br />
understand the chances wad the opportunities of that occurring<br />
are diminished if they are going to pursue an unacceptable line<br />
of action in regard to professional executions.<br />
JOURNALIST: on the Antarctic, is it the American position that<br />
they don't want to permanently close off their options for<br />
mining? And if that in 80 Xnaudible </p>
<p>PM: Don't put this an though there's some surprise that what<br />
we're finding out about the American position. When we took our<br />
position in Cabinet we were totally aware, totally aware, because<br />
they'd signed it, the Convention, at the end of last year. Nfow<br />
there Is no doubt that we knew exactly what the American position<br />
was. There is some impression that Lt was just found out with a<br />
degree of surprise that American position. But we took our<br />
position with full knowledge of what the American position was.<br />
What I'm saying to you is that in signing that Convention the<br />
view of the Americans was that it provided a framework obviously<br />
within which they thought mining could go ahead in acceptable<br />
fashion. N~ ow our position made quite clear as I will be saying<br />
tomorrow# that we think mining should not go ahead. We don't<br />
think it is appropriate to have as an instrument for stopping<br />
mining a mining convention. So there's nothing new that suddenly<br />
emerged in this issue. All that we are doing now is that we have<br />
the opportunity of explaining our position to our friends here in<br />
0 the United States and as the President said to me today; I hope<br />
that you will, and let's discuss it But there is no indication<br />
from him that they are going to change it their position. But<br />
it's a relationship of intelligent friendship that if we have a<br />
difference, let's talk it over.<br />
JOURNALIST: I thought you said earlier that you shared the same<br />
objectives. PMz What we do is share as we do with France, and as we do I<br />
think with the United Kingdom, that this pristine environment,<br />
this vast wilderness of the world, should be protected that<br />
action should be taken to protect it. Now the position, the<br />
assumption of our friends here and in a number of other countries<br />
is that it can be done, that in the framework of the convention.<br />
Our view is that you can't say we share the objective of trying<br />
to protect that area as the Americans and our other friends think<br />
it can be done by a convention. We don't share that view.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe that the big oil spills here in the<br />
last few days might add to public opinion?<br />
PM: It may do. We certainly know that the Exxon Valdes tragedy<br />
has moved to accelerate public opinion not only in this country<br />
but in other part. of the world. The dangers that can occur in<br />
these sorts of.-environments flowing from the spills, and I would<br />
think also from the exploratory activities I think that sort<br />
of incident must add to the opinion. To what extent it will in<br />
this country and elsewhere, I just can't say, but it must have<br />
some impact I would think.<br />
JOURALI 1 r. you going soft on criticism of American<br />
agricultural policies? </p>
<p>PM, No, I'm not going soft on it. What I am saying, as I said<br />
before I left Australia# before I got on the aircraft, I said I<br />
am not going to allow the issue and I never intended that I<br />
would allow our differences on this issue to mar the<br />
relationship between our two countries. It is far too important<br />
to be marred by this issue, and some go back over a long period<br />
of time. There have been those who have advanced the view that we<br />
should put the Joint facilities on the tible. I have said at all<br />
points that is not an acceptable approach. An far as I am<br />
concerned, as my government is concerned, the things that we are<br />
united upon, the things in respect to which we act together on<br />
such a broad range of issues, whether you look at the actual<br />
alliance relationship or if you look at the way we pursue the<br />
issues between East and West, and you look at the chemical<br />
Weapons convention whatever in a range of issues you want to<br />
look at, in all of them we have so many shared positions, which<br />
are important for our people, to their people and for the rest of<br />
S the world. It would be an act of irresponsibility to allow this<br />
issue to disrupt that relationship. That doesn't mean that I<br />
won't be putting our positions strongly. You will see in the<br />
speech that I make tomorrow at the Press Club that I will be<br />
putting our position quite strongly and we will continue, and the<br />
President understands this. We will continue to do that.<br />
JOURNALISTt One question about the new American Ambassador to<br />
Australia, Mel Sembler. Are you happy with his qualifications?<br />
NM Yes I am. I had the opportunity of meeting Mr Sembler at<br />
dinner last night with the Vice-President. it was the first<br />
opportunity I have had to meet him and his wife. I was very<br />
favourably impressed by him. He seem to me a very intelligent<br />
person. He is without doubt a person who has taken great pains in<br />
recent weeks to acquaint himself with Australia, Australian<br />
issues and issues between our two countries. He also, from our<br />
point of view, has the very great advantage of access to and<br />
close friendship with the President. I think it's impossible to<br />
0 overstate the importance of that fact in the Ambassadorship.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Duffy made a new strong attack on the SEP<br />
yesterday. Do you share his attitude inaudible... and did he<br />
check with you before making the statement? </p>
<p>PM No, he didn't check with me. We have had discussions before I<br />
left Australia generally. But I don't sit down and tell each of<br />
my Ministers how they will express themselves. I have not done<br />
that for six years and I do not intend to do it now. But I will<br />
be putting the position here to the President and to the relevant<br />
Administration officials. I think the total of representation<br />
that I make that Mr Duf fy makes in his environment, and that<br />
Senator Evans will make in his, that John Kerin will make in his<br />
that there will be no doubt at all in the minds of our American<br />
friend. that we feel strongly about this issue, and the important<br />
thing that I will be stressing is that what we have got to do in<br />
this period between now and the end of 1990, where because of the<br />
level of wheat stocks and wheat prices, that in that period we<br />
are not going to suffer as we have in earlier periods, that we<br />
should use our very best endeavors together in the Multilateral<br />
Trade Negotiation round to achieve the position where in that<br />
framework, subsidisation of agriculture and distorting export<br />
subsidies are going to be eliminated. That's an objective which<br />
the United States and we share and we do have the real<br />
opportunity between now and the end of 1990 to work the achieve<br />
that. JOURNALIST; The President told us today that he wants to come to<br />
Australia soon. Are you going to reinvite him?<br />
PM; I have already invited him.<br />
JOURNALIST: When, today?<br />
PMs I have invited him before today. When I was here last year I<br />
told him that we wanted to see him in Australia and i renewed the<br />
invitation today.<br />
JOURNALIST: How did the golf finish?<br />
PM: Well the President had a very good partner in Bob M~ ichel. He<br />
warn the best player and they just got up. It was a very, very<br />
enjoyable game.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the score?<br />
PMs They just got up.<br />
