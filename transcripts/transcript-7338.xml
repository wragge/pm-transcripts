FOR MEDIA 19 JUNE 1988<br />
A major exhibition of Egyptian antiquities, Gold of the<br />
Pharaohs, will come to Australia this year.<br />
The exhibition will be in Australia for 10 months under the<br />
auspices of the International Cultural Corporation of<br />
Australia, and will be seen in four cities.<br />
The Egyptian Government has agreed to send the exhibition to<br />
Australia in 1988 as a gesture of goodwill for Australia's<br />
Bicentenary. It is the first major exhibition of Egyptian<br />
antiquities to come to Australia and one of the largest ever<br />
to leave Egypt. Agreement in principle to a tour was<br />
announced during my visit to Egypt in February 1987.<br />
The exhibition from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo includes<br />
treasures and jewellery from the tombs of the rulers of the<br />
great Egyptian civilization of 3000 years ago. It includes<br />
many objects from the famous excavations at Tanis, the<br />
Pharaonic capital in the Nile Delta. The centrepiece is a<br />
gold burial mask. There are also gold ornaments inlaid with<br />
precious stones, gold toe and finger covers and a monumental<br />
granite sarcophagus of the Pharaoh himself.<br />
Gold of the Pharaohs will open in Brisbane in August and<br />
then be displayed in Perth, Sydney and Melbourne. I am<br />
delighted that the itinerary will give many many thousands<br />
of Australians the opportunity to see, enjoy and appreciate<br />
the majestic achievements of one of the greatest<br />
civilizations of the ancient world.<br />
