<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>Well Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have appreciated very much the courtesy and the gesture extended to me by the President of the Republic of Indonesia in inviting me to come to Jakarta so early in her term as President of this country.</p>
<p>The communiqu‚ brings together the shared commitment of the two Governments, of the President and myself, to restore a positive but realistic relationship between our two nations for the future. These have been very useful and positive discussions and they have laid the groundwork for further contact at a very senior level and a ministerial level between representatives of our two societies.</p>
<p>It is important that the Governments of Indonesia and Australia have a strong, realistic and positive relationship and I believe that what has occurred in the last twenty four hours has laid a very firm basis for that to occur. The communiqu‚ notes that the association between our two countries has been a very long one, stretching back to the days of Indonesia's struggle for independence. It's a relationship that is important but like all relationships to be soundly based it must be grounded in realism and commonsense and mutual respect and mutual benefit and that is the tone and the attitude that the President and I have both brought to our discussions today.</p>
<p>Can I on a personal note, Madam President, thank you very warmly for receiving me so early in your term. I wish you well and I wish the people of Indonesia well.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
