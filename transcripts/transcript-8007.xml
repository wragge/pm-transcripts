TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, RAAF FLIGHT TO TURKEY, 22<br />
APRIL 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: the Gallipoli book in particular that<br />
has struck you?<br />
PM: I think the courage of the men involved and their<br />
mateship. We pride ourselves as Australians properly, I<br />
thinlk, on the concept of mateship and it was there at<br />
Anzac Cove that that concept was most dramatically and<br />
effectively crystalised, in my judgement. There's no<br />
doubt about the, their courage too against overwhelming<br />
odds. Very interesting. If you read the background,<br />
Kitchener who was, Lord Kitchener who was against the<br />
concept at the beginning, said that if it were to be<br />
undertaken it would need a force of at least 200,000<br />
troops. In the end there were only about 70,000. So you<br />
can see that they were given mission impossible almost<br />
from the beginning. Much of the planning was<br />
unbelievably inept and, against all those odds, as I say,<br />
the courage and the commitment and the mateship and the<br />
dedication to one another of the Australians is the thing<br />
that shone through.<br />
JOURNALIST: You had a chance to talk to some of the<br />
veterans before they left Sydney last week. What came<br />
though in terms of their expectations<br />
PM: A number of things, great deal of emotions among<br />
them. I think again more than anything the thought that<br />
they were going to be back there with their mates. There<br />
were about eight and a half thousand, and I say about<br />
because there is no absolute certainty about the numbers<br />
killed, but the Australian War Memorial talks in terms of<br />
about 8,700 and most of those, of course, are there in<br />
their graves in the about 26 cemetries that are dotted<br />
around on the Peninsula and the thought that these men<br />
being back there with their mates, I think, was something<br />
that was uppermost in their mind because they realise how<br />
fortunate they were, relatively, of course, to escape.<br />
Many of these men were themselves very seriously wounded<br />
and will carry that affliction for the rest of their life<br />
and I think they think of the supreme sacrifice made by<br />
their mates that are still there and I think the thought<br />
of going back to be with them is the thing more than<br />
anything, is uppermost in their mind. </p>

JOURNALIST: By the time this is over it will have cost<br />
perhaps millions of dollars. Was that ever a<br />
consideration when you were thinking of doing this trip?<br />
PM: No. Let's understand that the concept arose from<br />
the representatives of the men themselves. Bill Hall,<br />
the representative of the World War I veterans raised the<br />
matter back in 1988 raised it with Kim Beazley. Kim<br />
Beazley spoke to me and I immediately said yes, this<br />
seemed a good idea. I think you can't measure these<br />
things in terms of money. The fact is that this will be<br />
the last significant occasion to which these veterans<br />
will be able to go on this 75th anniversary. And what<br />
they embodied, represented, not only in terms of<br />
Gallipoli, but in terms of the sacrifice of Australian<br />
servicemen and women throughout the century is something<br />
which has given us the opportunity to enjoy our life<br />
today and the amount of money that's involved is not<br />
something to be measured against all those things.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, obviously the Anzac Day ceremony<br />
is at the centrepiece of the visit, but bilateral<br />
discussions with the Turkish Government, how important<br />
are they?<br />
PM: Well, they will be important, but you rightly say<br />
they are very much a subsidiary to our visit. I'll have<br />
the opportunity of talking with the Prime Minister and<br />
the President and those discussions will cover our<br />
bilateral relations. We have trade with them, two-way<br />
trade of over $ 100 million per annum. I think there are<br />
significant opportunities for increasing Australian<br />
exports to Turkey in the field of coal and iron ore.<br />
Also they have a very big project there, in a way is<br />
similar to the concept of the Snowy Mountains Scheme<br />
which is involving 13 different centres in something like<br />
ten percent of the land area of Turkey, to develop power<br />
and irrigation. And I think we have the expertise to be<br />
of assistance there, so I'll want to be talking about<br />
that. I'll also obviously be wanting to get impressions<br />
from them about developments in the Soviet Union. They<br />
are so close to Azerbaijan and have historically close<br />
links with the Soviet Union in regard to that area in<br />
particular. Also they have been having problems with<br />
Bulgaria and I'll be be wanting to get their feel of<br />
developments in Eastern Europe. Obviously, also, we are<br />
very much concerned about the stalemate between Turkey<br />
and Greece in regard to Cyprus, I want to talk to them<br />
about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Yes I will.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Not exclusively, but including the Kurds.<br />
