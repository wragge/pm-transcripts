TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KATHY BORDER, ABC RADIO, BRISBANE<br />
18 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KB: Prime Minister, this announcement today what difference will it<br />
make for the average person, their complaint being more often than<br />
not, that legal help is simply too expensive, and it's not worth going<br />
through the legal processes?<br />
PM: I think that's right I think it's very threatening for people, and they<br />
feel as though the justice system is there for the wealthy, or for those<br />
in the know, or those who have contacts, or what have you. And this<br />
is a very poor basis for us to continue the sort of deepening of our<br />
democracy, the sense of participation that people have in it, so we<br />
think this is a major grass-roots change to change the access to<br />
justice, by removing barriers to justice, to removing the resort to go<br />
to court and to litigation by resolving and preventing conflict, and if<br />
you like restoring confidence in the justice system itself they are<br />
the 3 elements of it.<br />
KB: And it will be cheaper?<br />
PM: We are going to add it will be cheaper, because there will be more<br />
competition among lawyers for services. People will have a better<br />
idea what costs will be. In fact, in the federal jurisdiction, we are<br />
going to ask lawyers to actually outline what the costs of a particular<br />
course of legal action might be, so that a proponent could have<br />
some other avenue available. And part of that is always better<br />
conflict resolving approaches. But the other we are going to do, is<br />
we are reforming legal aid and providing another $ 17 million in<br />
additional funds over 4 years for more assistance for civil and family<br />
law matters. At the moment, a lot of the legal aid money is<br />
swallowed up in the criminal law. We are going to even that up a bit<br />
with civil and family legal matters. We are spending another<br />
million over 4 years to expand the community legal centres, and </p>
<p>community legal centres are your really grass-roots access areas<br />
the very things you are talking about. We're establishing 9 new<br />
community legal centres in outer urban and regional centres, and<br />
they will target more services to children and youth and human rights<br />
and discrimination. So those sorts of things.<br />
KB: Lots of initiatives. Can we move onto the Mt Isa Mines dispute it's<br />
still in limbo there. management has agreed to talks, but only with 2<br />
particular unions why do you think those 2 particular unions?<br />
PM: I'm not party to the discussions. I think there is a demarcation issue<br />
here, the one you identified about the unions, and there is also an<br />
enterprise bargain going on at the same time so it's a bit of a mixed<br />
grill. I think there's some good news in the fact that they have<br />
agreed to talks, and I know that the ACTU s doing what it can to try<br />
and bring the process along and so is my colleague, Laurie<br />
Brereton.<br />
KB: Do you think management should be giving more ground, though?<br />
PM: I'm not party to the discussions, so I can't give you that sort of closein<br />
comment. But obviously, the more goodwill there is from<br />
management or from both sides towards a settlement people<br />
have generally got to want a settlement. If they want a settlement, I<br />
think we could probably get one.<br />
KB: Variable interest rates lots of movement there lately. What do you<br />
see happening in the near future up or down?<br />
PM: I think for the moment it's down. I notice one of the Tasmanian<br />
banks reduced its variable interest rates today. We saw a couple of<br />
solid reductions from the major banks last Friday. The main reason<br />
for that is, I think, that there has been a change in the financial<br />
markets, and the long term bond rate has dropped from 10. 1% about<br />
a week ago, to 8.9% it is now under The reason for that is that<br />
the Budget changed the bond selling program the Commonwealth<br />
sells bonds to fund the Budget deficit. Last year, we sold $ 21 billion<br />
worth of bonds $ 21,000 million. Because of the Budget this year,<br />
we will sell $ 6,000 million. So there is a $ 15, 000 million reduction in<br />
the bond selling program of the Commonwealth, and that's what has<br />
reduced the interest rate the yield on the long term bonds, and<br />
that's having it's impact now on the variable housing rates.<br />
KB: But isn't a bit of stability needed just today, we have got figures out<br />
new housing figures showing that home loan approvals have<br />
slumped. Will the Government be looking at stabilising that?<br />
PM: The thing is, late last year it was running too strongly. It's either<br />
going up, or it's going down. The aim of policy has been to slow the </p>
<p>economy down from these exceptionally high rates of growth we had<br />
last year. Last year, in the year to September, the economy was<br />
growing at which is far too strong for us. In the Budget<br />
forecast, we have now got 3.75% for the year. In other word, those<br />
interest rate adjustments of late last year seemed like they have<br />
done the trick they started to slow the economy down. But part of<br />
the slowing is there is a change in consumer sentiment that comes<br />
with it. That impacts into housing, but it will change. As this lower<br />
rate structure is moving into place lower interest rate structure as<br />
there is more confidence around since the Budget, this will start to<br />
have it's effect on the housing industry a beneficial effect.<br />
KB: So you're happy just to let things go as they are at the moment?<br />
PM: Basically, there is no shortage of housing funds it's really up to<br />
people to want to bid for them. Before I became Treasurer in the<br />
1980s, you couldn't get the funds at any price, because they were all<br />
regulated. There was a certain amount of funds, and that was it. It<br />
wouldn't matter how credit worthy you were, you couldn't get them.<br />
But after we opened the financial markets up in the 80s, you could<br />
get funds for housing it's really just a matter of whether you want to<br />
apply.<br />
KB: There is some controversy surrounding that the Health Insurance<br />
Amendment Bill last night here in Brisbane we had hundred of<br />
Doctors meeting, and they decided that they won't be signing any<br />
contracts with private insurance funds or private hospitals do these<br />
amount to underhand tactics, and what effect will it have on the Bill?<br />
PM: Well, you get, I think, this sort of behaviour where they resist these<br />
sorts of changes. But in the end, what we think is unfair for patients<br />
is they go in let's say they go in for a hip replacement, or an<br />
appendectomy, or whatever it might be and then they have the<br />
anaesthetist charge added on, they have the diagnostic imaging<br />
added on, they have the support of ward attendants added on, and<br />
what we are trying to do is get the one price. So when you take your<br />
insurance out, if someone says " I have got to go in for a hip<br />
replacement", there's one price. But that means that the health fund<br />
has got to be able to sign up, and the hospital, has got to be able<br />
sign up the doctors. So the doctors agree to do it at a fixed price.<br />
Now, sometimes they will do it more inexpensively than the price,<br />
other times with a complication it will cost more. But they will get<br />
an average price. It's the one way we can start getting some<br />
certainty into private insurance, and it's one of the ways whereby<br />
people will know that if they actually take out private insurance, and<br />
they go in for some elective surgery or non-elective surgery as the<br />
case may be, they are not up for a heap of other unforseen<br />
expenses at the end. </p>
<p>KB: But if the doctors refuse to sign these contracts?<br />
PM; Again, we are not going to get reform of the medical system quickly<br />
or easily. I mean, you will always get these argy-bargies going on<br />
in the end doctors want to protect... surgeons want to protect their<br />
incomes, being able to charge as they see fit for the particular time<br />
and attention they give a patient. And not to be party to, if you like,<br />
arrangements with health funds, or with hospitals. If they want more<br />
private people in private insurance and that's what you hear from<br />
them all the time they're going to have to give some ground.<br />
KB: On to the car war between the US and Japan you are, of course,<br />
going to Japan shortly. Is the US, do you think, taking a too hard a<br />
line with our Asian neighbours here?<br />
PM; Well, the Japanese-US problem is basically a savings issue. The<br />
Japanese are high savers, the Americans are low savers. And the<br />
Japanese the high savings means that they have been able to run<br />
very large investment programs, larger than the United States. This<br />
has given their industries an enormous comparative advantage. The<br />
Japanese, I think, also are at a bit of a crossroads. They want to<br />
encourage greater consumer choice by buying products other than<br />
those made in Japan and that is taking time. Probably more time than<br />
it should of I think the Americans have probably got a point there. But<br />
again, these are going to be evolutionary changes and they are not<br />
going to happen by the United States taking a sledge hammer to the<br />
Japanese. It is not really the way to get things done and we ought to<br />
be concentrating on more open and freer trade generally and curing<br />
some of these savings imbalances.<br />
I think a lot of Japan's problems could be solved if more of their<br />
savings were spent on themselves. That is, if they lifted domestic<br />
demand, improve their housing stock, improved their infrastructure,<br />
their roads, improved the environment. By doing that they would run<br />
down these current account surpluses which would ease a lot of their<br />
trade tensions they are getting out of a very high valued Yen. I think<br />
that is the way it is going to come, it is not going to come by<br />
bludgeoning.<br />
KB: Just on that though, how do you think this car war will affect APEC?<br />
PM: I don't think it will affect APEC. APEC is about the multilateralisation,<br />
that is, getting the group of countries in APEC to agree to a set of rules<br />
among them, that is, multilateral rules. The United States has looked<br />
somewhat askance at all this because being the biggest dog on the<br />
street, it has always taken the view that they will have what they call<br />
unilateral rules: rules for one wherein they can decide what trade<br />
deal they want to do or what trade deal they want to propose. The<br />
whole emphasis on APEC is for multilateral solutions, that is, the </p>
<p>solutions of many, of all the countries in it. APEC is just a bit too good<br />
for the Americans to pass up. So, unilateralism aside, I can't see it<br />
really being any impediment to the continuing progress of APEC.<br />
KB: We have, of course, got the Federal and a Queensland election<br />
looming, Is this going to be your last election campaign as Labor<br />
leader?<br />
PM: I hope not. My God, you are pensioning me off already. I thought I<br />
was going all right here! I mean, you have got me on doctors and over<br />
to APEC, then onto health, I thought I was cracking along all right.<br />
Now you have got me in retirement!<br />
KB: How much longer are you going to be at the helm then?<br />
PM: Look, you know what happened? In the 25 years before I became an<br />
MID nothing happened in Australia. What happened is the public<br />
system threw the pass. In the Rip Van Winkle years of Menzies and<br />
Holt and Gorton and McMahon, very little happened and very little<br />
happened in terms of structural change. I have been in that generation<br />
of MPs that had a chance of remodelling the Australian economy into<br />
an internationally competitive, externally orientated country and kicking<br />
the policy changes through like we did last week with the budget, with<br />
occupational superannuation for the whole work force. Every person<br />
putting away 15 per cent of their income for savings. The average<br />
person going out on a pension of $ 33,000 a year. Those sorts of<br />
changes are what makes it worthwhile or APEC which you have just<br />
spoken of or Mabo or Working Nation helping the long term<br />
unemployed back into work. These are the things that keep somebody<br />
like me in the game.<br />
KB: Are you serious, you don't think anything was achieved until your<br />
generation came into politics?<br />
PM: No, basically what happened was Australia went to sleep. We just<br />
picked up the post war growth and said that is it. We have just got to<br />
sell a bit of gold, a bit of iron ore and a bit of wheat and we will be<br />
right. Well, of course, we were not right so by 1983 the terms of trade,<br />
that is the value of the things we sell compared with the value of the<br />
things we buy, had changed so dramatically Australia had a big current<br />
account weakness and all this exposure to international debt. We had<br />
only three kids in ten completing secondary school. This year we have<br />
got eight in ten. We were rapidly becoming an unsmart country. We<br />
were massively uncompetitive and we are now 40 per cent more<br />
competitive today than we were in 1983. We have had 26 per cent<br />
employment growth sine 1983, household disposable income has risen<br />
per cent since 1983.<br />
KB: If things are so good you will want to go to an election soon then? </p>
<p>PM: Well, no, I am just making the point that good public policy look at a<br />
country that has had a decade of good public policy and you'll see one<br />
bounding ahead and Australia has had a decade of good public policy<br />
and it is bounding ahead.<br />
KB: Can you tell me what you see as the major differences between<br />
yourself and John Howard?<br />
PM: Answer in one word policies we have got them and he doesn't. You<br />
notice Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin say this week of Mr Howard, it was<br />
headed " Politics without Policies" and that really says it all in one<br />
sentence about John Howard. John Howard thinks he can come back<br />
into Opposition as Opposition Leader after having failed to distinguish<br />
himself as Opposition Leader and as Treasurer and because we put<br />
interest rates up last year, as we needed to do to slow the economy<br />
down, he thought, " oh well, the Government will be a bit on the nose,<br />
I'll slide in and become Prime Minister". Well, the thing about John,<br />
what he is finding out is the public actually want some performance,<br />
they want some policies, they are not going to give him the ticket<br />
without knowing what he has in store for them-.<br />
KB: What about as a person, are there any qualities about him you like?<br />
PM: He is a fluffy enough sort of character. I don't mind having a chat with<br />
him if I am sitting with him at something. But, the thing is, the problem<br />
about John Howard is he belongs to the 1950s. He is a 1970s<br />
politician with the 1950s values. Here we are in Asia, where for the<br />
first time in Australian history we have the big economies of the world<br />
at our doorstep. We are in the fastest growing part of the world for the<br />
first time ever, but physiologically, John is still set up for Europe and<br />
North America. He said ' if that Mr Keating can convince me about the<br />
republic, why, in five years time ask me the question, I might be in<br />
favour of it.' In other words, " if Mr Keating will lead again, I might<br />
follow." That was the same on the floating of the dollar. That was the<br />
same on deregulation. That was the same on breaking the tariff wall<br />
down. That was the same on changing the education system. That<br />
was the same on Mabo. That was the same on superannuation. So,<br />
now he is saying ' oh, actually I agree with him on tariffs and I agree<br />
with him about Asia' to which I say, well if you agree with me, if you<br />
agree with us, why not let the authors of the policies be the<br />
Government and not somebody who wants to appropriate their<br />
policies. The thing is this, Australia has moved on from the Rip Van Wrinkle<br />
years of Menzies when the country, in policy terms, was asleep. That<br />
is John Howard's period. That is the period he looks to as a model.<br />
Australians now want change and they know change has given them a<br />
more interesting vital lives and higher incomes and more security and </p>
<p>particularly that linkage to Asia. They know that. They know there is a<br />
low inflationary culture now that wasn't there in his time. They know<br />
that we have inculcated in the whole generation of managers and trade<br />
unionists a productive culture. Product innovation is the order of the<br />
day. We have doubled, just about, the proportion of our exports to<br />
GOP in a decade. All of those things have come about and they are<br />
not going to take somebody who says ' well basically, look, I have got<br />
no policies, but I can give you a smart quip on ' AM' or ' PM' or on a<br />
radio program..<br />
KB: You are not into smart quips?<br />
PM: and, you know, I can duck through without any real policy." Well,<br />
you can't duck through. It is all over red rover. They are not going to<br />
cop it.<br />
KB: Of course, you are here in Brisbane today, have you met with Wayne<br />
Goss at all to discuss elections?<br />
PM: No, I haven't seen Wayne. No, I launched the Justice Statement and<br />
then I have just had a lunch with the Lord Mayor and we had a<br />
discussion about some of the problems of greater Brisbane, about<br />
water supplies, about transport and I had a chance to meet some of<br />
the distinguished members of the media on the way through and all in<br />
all it has been a good productive day.<br />
KB: Thank you for coming in, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Pleasure.<br />
ends </p>
