SPEECH BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER, HON R, J. HAWKE AC, MP<br />
AT THE AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE CENTRE<br />
JAKARTA<br />
4 JUNE 1983<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS,<br />
IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE FOR ME TO BE HERE TODAY,<br />
THIS OFFICIAL VISIT TO INDONESIA, ON THE FIRST<br />
LEG OF MY OVERSEAS MISSION AS AUSTRALIA'S NEW PRIME MINISTER,<br />
IS INTENDED, OF ITSELF, TO DEMONSTRATE THE HIGH PRIORITY<br />
THE NEW AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ATTACHES TO RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN INDONESIA AND AUSTRALIA,<br />
BUT THIS OCCASION AT THE AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE<br />
CENTRE RECOGNISES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THAT<br />
MANY-SIDED RELATIONSHIP THE HUMAN SIDE,<br />
GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATIONS, TRADE,<br />
AID, INVESTMENT ALL THESE ARE IMPORTANT. BUT NONE IS<br />
MORE IMPORTANT THAN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR PEOPLE<br />
AND THE KEY TO COMMUNICATION REMAINS LANGUAGE.<br />
So I AM ESPECIALLY PLEASED THAT I HAVE THIS<br />
EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLEOF INDONESIA<br />
AT THE AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE CENTRE, </p>
<p>FIRST, LET ME REAFFIRM THAT THE NEW GOVERNMENT<br />
OF AUSTRALIA ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE<br />
MAINTENANCE AND GROWTH OF SOUND AND CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA,<br />
IT IS WORTH RECALLING THAT IT WAS ANl AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ' INTERNATIONAL<br />
CHAMPIONS OF INDONESIAN INDEPENDENCE. THIS IS AN<br />
ASSOCIATION THAT THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR MOVEMENT RECALLS<br />
WITH PRIDE, OUR AIM IS TO ENHANCE THE GENERALLY GOOD<br />
RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS BEEN BUILT UP BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES<br />
OVER SEVERAL DECADES. WE WANT A PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP<br />
BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT AND ON A RECOGNITION OF THE<br />
MAJOR COMMUNITY OF INTEREST WHICH WE SHARE*. AS CLOSE NEIGHBOURSi<br />
MY DISCUSSIONS THIS MORN ING W ITH THE PRESIDENT,<br />
VICE PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER HAVE HELPED TO<br />
RE-EMPHASISE THIS COMMON INTEREST, AND BROAD AGREEMENT<br />
ON THE FUTURE COURSE WE SHOULD TAKE IN PURSUIT OF THE<br />
COMMON INTEREST, IN RECENT YEARS THE RELATIONSHIP HAS ALSO DEVELOPED<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY THROUGH FREQUENT EXCI-iANGES OF HIGH LEVEL VISITS,;<br />
THE GROWTH OF TOURISM AND CULTURAL CONTACT THE TEACHING<br />
OF INDONESIAN IN AUSTRALIAN SCHOOLS THE EXPANSION OF<br />
CIVIL AVIATION LINKS AND OF COURSE TRADE AND INVESTMENT. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
IN FACT, TRADE AND INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN<br />
NOTABLE SUCCESSES. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS TWO-WAY TRADE<br />
HAS INCREASED OVER TEN TIMES TO $ 932 MILLION IN 1981/ 82,<br />
WITH A SURPLUS IN INDONESIA'S FAVOUR IN THAT YEAR OF<br />
ALMOST $ 100. MILLION.<br />
AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN INDONESIA HAS ALSO<br />
RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST DECADE, IT NOW STANDS<br />
AROUND $ 200 MILLION, AND MORE THAN FIFTY AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMPANIES HAVE ESTABLISHED SUCCESSFUL JOINT VENTURES<br />
IN INDONESIA. BOTH INDONESIA AND AUSTRALIA ARE SIGNIFICANT<br />
NATIONS IN THIS GREAT SOUTH EAST ASIAN REGION NOW THE<br />
MOST RAPIDLY GROWING ECON OMIC REGION IN THE WORLD.<br />
INDONESIA WITH A HUGE POTENTIAL MARKET, ABUNDANT NATURAL<br />
RESOURCES AND A RECENT HISTORY OF SUSTAINED ECONOMIC. GROWTH<br />
IS ONE OF THE KEY ECONOMIES IN THE REGION. THE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL CO-OPERATION ARE<br />
CLEARLY CONSIDERABLE. WE SHOULD DEVELOP THEM FURTHER.<br />
BUT WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD, GOVERNMENTS<br />
CAN ONLY ACHIEVE SO MUCH IN STRENGTHENING BILATERAL RELATIONS.<br />
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION MUST COME<br />
FROM THE PEOPLE. A/ 1 </p>
<p>A CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLOSER<br />
BILATERAL RELATIONS IS BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH<br />
OTHER'S CULTURAL VALUES AND* TRADITIONS.<br />
AND AS I SAID EARLIER, LANGUAGE LIES AT THE<br />
VERY HEART OF THAT BETTER UNDERSTANDING.<br />
SO THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THIS AUSTRALIAN<br />
LANGUAGE CENTRE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS<br />
THE GOAL OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND CLOSER RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN O. UR TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
ITRUST, OF COURSE, THAT THE DESIGNATION OF<br />
THIS CENTRE AS THE " AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE CENTRE",<br />
WILL NOT BE A SOURCE OF CONFUSION.<br />
THERE IS, OF COURSE, No AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE<br />
AS SUCH. WE SPEAK ENGLISH THOUGH I SUPPOSE THERE MAY BE<br />
SOME SUPERIOR PERSONS DISPOSED TO DISPUTE THE CLAIM.<br />
IN FACT, AS BEFITS THE LANGUAGE OF SHAKESPEAREA<br />
LIVING,, CHANGING LANGUAGE WE CAN CLAIM TO HAVE<br />
ENRICHED AND INVIGORATED IT. 121/ 5 </p>
<p>IN ANY CASE, AS THE MAJOR ENGLISH-SPEAKING<br />
COUNTRY IN THIS REGION, IT IS PROPER THAT AUSTRALIA<br />
SHOULD ASSIST THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS<br />
IN SOUTH EAST ASIA; AND ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATEJHAT THE<br />
FIRST ENGLISH LANGUAGE CENTRE ESTABLISHED By AUtTRALIA<br />
SHOULD BE HERE IN OUR CLOSEST AND MOST POPULOUS NEIGHBOUR,<br />
INDONESIA. YOU WILL KNOW THAT IN THE POST-WAR YEARS,<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS ABSORBED LARGE NUMBERS OF NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS<br />
FROM COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND IN MORE RECENT YEARS,<br />
INCREASING NUMBERS OF NON-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE SPEAKERS<br />
FROM ASIA. THUS, WIE HAVE DEVELOPED CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE<br />
IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.<br />
IN AUSTRALIA, THE INDONESIAN LANGUAGE HAS BEEN<br />
TAUGHT FOR MANY YEARS IN THE UNIVERSITIES AND IN MANY<br />
SECONDARY SCHOOLS, THIS HAS HELPED PRODUCE A SOLID BASIS<br />
-IN AUSTRALIA FOR INDONESIAN STUDIES. 4 </p>
<p>THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF INDONESIAN AND<br />
SOUTH EAST ASIAN STUDIES IN AUSTRALIA IS AN OBJECTIVE<br />
THAT my GOVERNMENT WANTS TO ENCOURAGE.<br />
IT IS OUR INTENTION THAT THIS LANGUAGE. CENTRE<br />
WILL ENCOURAGE INDONESIAN INTEREST IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING ON TO STUDY THERE IN VARIOUS FIELDS,<br />
IT WILL BE THEIR INTRODUCTION To AUSTRALIA AND ITS PEOPLE,<br />
AS WELL AS ITS LANGUAGE.<br />
WE HOPE THAT . OVER TIME IT-WILL ALSO INCREASINGLY<br />
OFFER LANGUAGE TRAINING AND RELATED FACILITIES TO A WIDER<br />
CIRCLE OF INDONESIANS WHO WILL THEN GAIN SOME ACQUAINTANCE'<br />
WITH AUSTRALIA. IHOPE TO SEE IT LINK IN WITH OTHER CO-OPERATIVE<br />
ACTIVITIES HERE. FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE HEARD WITH GREAT<br />
INTEREST OF THE STEPS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO ESTABLISH<br />
AND DEVELOP A PROGRAM OF AUSTRALIAN STUDIES AT THE<br />
UNIVERSITY OF INDONESIA. THAT SEEMS TO ME PRECISELY THE<br />
SORT OF ENTERPRISE WHICH WE NEED IF WE ARE TO GET THE<br />
' INCREASED MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING WHICH MY<br />
GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY DOES WANT TO SEE DEVELOP BETWEEN<br />
INDONESIA AND AUSTRALIA. I HOPE WE CAN FIND WAYS TO BUILD UP<br />
THAT PROGRAM AND HELP IT DEVELOP INTO A SOUNDLY-BASED<br />
, ACADEMIC CENTRE FOR AUSTRALIAN STUDIES HERE IN INDONESIA.<br />
es. 17 </p>
<p>AS THIS LANGUAGE TRAINING CENTRE MEETS AN<br />
INDONESIAN DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REQUIREMENT,<br />
IAM DELIGHTED, ON MY FIRST VISIT TO INDONESIA AS<br />
PRIME MITNISTER OF AUSTRALIA, TO BE ABLE TO DEDICATE<br />
A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM,<br />
IAM PARTICULARLY PLEASED BECAUSE IT IS<br />
A PROJECT WHICH WILL NOT ONLY GIVE INCREASING NUMBERS<br />
OF INDONESIAN GRADUATES ACCESS TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,<br />
BUT WdILL INTRODUCE MANY OF THEM To AUSTRALIA,<br />
IBELIEVE THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL.<br />
OF US THAT WE DO MORE TO ENHANCE OUR MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE<br />
AND UNDERISTANDING. MY GOVERNMENT WILL DO ALL IT CAN<br />
TO SEE THAT THIS IS ACHIEVED.<br />
IT FALLS TO ME TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF DEDICATING<br />
THIS CENTRE TODAY AS PRIME MIINISTER OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
BUT, OF COURSE, THIS TASK I PERFORM TODAY ONLY COMPLETES'<br />
AN INITIATIVE UNDERTAKEN BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIA. THIS FACT IS A REMINDER OF THE BASIC CONTINUITY<br />
OF THE RELATIONS BEIWEEN OUR TWO PEOPLES, AND THE CONTINUING<br />
WISH OF ALL AUSTRALIANS FOR FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING<br />
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLE OF INDONESIA AND<br />
AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>IN UNVEILING THIS PLAQUE, I DEDICATE THIS<br />
LANGUAGE TRAINING CENTRE TO INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION<br />
AND UNDERSTANDING AND PARTICULARLY TO THE<br />
ENHANCEMENT OF MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING<br />
BETWEEN INDONESIA AND AUSTRALIA. </p>
