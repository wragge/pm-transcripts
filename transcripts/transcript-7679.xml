PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE. SEAWORLD NARA RESORT HOTEL,<br />
SURFERS PARADISE 14 JULY 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: The eight backbenchers concerned about interest<br />
rates in Canberra last night, were they wasting their<br />
time? PM: No, people never waste their time meeting.. As I<br />
said when I got off the plane yesterday from the South<br />
Pacific Forum, I never object to people meeting. But the<br />
important thing is that we start in earnest on Monday<br />
with the Budget preparation processes. We will do, as<br />
we've done over six years of government) to go about the<br />
steady business of managing the Australian economy in<br />
a way which is going to produce the best results. You<br />
heard me talking here today about what those results have<br />
been unsurpassed in the history of this country and<br />
better in fundamental respects than is happening elsewhere,<br />
with the creation of jobs and the bringing down of inflation,<br />
a situation now, admittedly, where in the interest of<br />
Australians we have to have temporarily high interest<br />
rates. Because the alternative would mean a disaster.<br />
We will make the decisions which are necessary to protect<br />
the continuing interests of the Australian people. If<br />
some of the backbenchers want to meet and have their ideas<br />
well that's OK. But we will make the decisions which<br />
are necessary to, as I say, protect the interest's of the<br />
Australian people.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you take their suggestions on board?<br />
PM: We know what they are saying. As I said before.<br />
over the last few weeks, when suggestions are made you<br />
don't ignore suggestions. You look at them and see if<br />
they've got merit and then you make the decisions which<br />
on balance are best for the community. But the fact that<br />
eight backbenchers have met is not going Co change the<br />
course of history.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it becoming more politically attracti'Je<br />
to artificially soften the impact of high interest rates? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: We won't be doing anything artificial. If we make<br />
a decision it will be a considered decision which we think<br />
is in the interests of the Australian people, presently<br />
and in the longer term.<br />
JOURNALIST: One bank has reduced its interest rate to<br />
15.5% today. Do you think that interest rates have peaked<br />
PM: I'm not making any comment about the timing of interes9<br />
rate movements because when a Prime Minister does that<br />
it can be counterproductive. All I can say is this, it<br />
really is two things, as I've said consistently and I<br />
repeat them. Interest rates will be kept as high as they<br />
need to be for as long as is necessary to protect the<br />
interests of the Australian economy. Secondly, we will<br />
be making a range of decisions which are consistent with<br />
protecting the interests of the Australian people and<br />
in a way which will enable, at an appropriate time, a<br />
lowering of the interest rate regimen. But that will<br />
not be one day before it's responsible and it won't be<br />
carried on one day longer than is necessary. It's as<br />
simple as that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident that you'll have the full<br />
support of the Caucus?<br />
PM: Yes, yes. You would notice that even amongst people<br />
who are having their meetings and getting a reasonable<br />
amount of publicity for them, basically they are saying<br />
that they support the fundamental thrust of the Government's<br />
policy, as well they should. Look at what it's produced.<br />
If you produce a policy from ' 83 onwards which turns around<br />
what was the worst recession in 50 years, and your policy<br />
turns that round to a point where you have a rate of 3mployment<br />
growth four times as fast as what you had before, more<br />
than twice as fast as the rest of the world, reduce inflation<br />
and have a reduction in the Budget deficit to a point<br />
now where it is a record surplus, there can't be much<br />
wrong with those policies.<br />
