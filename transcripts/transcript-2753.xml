PRESS STATEMENT NO. 21<br />
December 1972<br />
ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS<br />
The Australian Government has decided to hold a judicial<br />
inquiry as the first move towards the legal recognition of<br />
Aboriginal rights in land.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced the appointment<br />
of Mr. Justice Woodward as the Commissioner to conduct the<br />
inquiry. Mr. Justice Woodward's commission is not concerned with<br />
whether rights in land should be granted since the government<br />
has already decided that they shall.<br />
His ta~ rk is simply to advise how they shall be granted.<br />
He has been asked to report on:<br />
oarrangements necessary in the Northern Territory for vesting<br />
title to Aboriginal reserved land, including rights in<br />
minerals and timber, in the Aboriginal groups and communities<br />
concerned; procedures for the examination of claims based on t raditional<br />
rights in the areas outside reserves or alternative ways of<br />
meeting effectively the needs of Aboriginal communities outside<br />
the reserves for land;<br />
oamendments to legislation necessary to give effect to his<br />
recommendations. The Commissioner has been advised that in preparing his<br />
recommendations he should take into account already existing<br />
commitments affecting the areas of land involved.<br />
The precise terms of reference will be decided by the Minister<br />
for Aboriginal Affairs and announced in due course.<br />
The Government intends to refer subsequent matters involving<br />
Aboriginalurights in or claims to land to Mr. Justice Woodward as<br />
soon as the first stage of his commission is complete. </p>
