TRANSCRIPT OF ' THE RAY MARTIN SHOW' ( WITH PAUL KEATING)<br />
MONDAY, 21 AUGUST 1989<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
MARTIN: We now have, first time ever on television or radio<br />
together, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke and Mr Paul Keating,<br />
the Treasurer. Would you please welcome them both. I'll tell<br />
you what, you talk about wanting to go into television when<br />
you finish politics, live television's kind of fun. Thanks<br />
for your help, thanks for coming here, very much indeed. Now<br />
it gets us to the opening story, I suppose, which, of course,<br />
is about the pilots strike. I had to come down from Cairns<br />
yesterday. It took me about fifteen hours, including a<br />
charter flight, to do it. Why are you so tough with this,<br />
Bob? PM: Because they're exceptionally greedy. They're making a<br />
totally unjustified claim which in itself is wrong. But if<br />
they were to succeed, they would wreck the whole wage-fixing<br />
system in this country which has produced for the great bulk<br />
of Australians a much better say. We've created one a half<br />
million jobs because ordinary wage and salary earners have<br />
exercised restraint.-<br />
MARTIN: But why haven't you been this tough on judges or<br />
politicians or businessmen?<br />
PM: Judges are not within the Industrial Relations Commission<br />
system, the award structure system. They have, in fact,<br />
exercised enormous restraint over the time. They've had<br />
decisions and recommendations of the Tribunal knocked back as<br />
have politicians. In respect to the business community, Paul<br />
and I have been as tough as we possibly can to ask them to<br />
restrain. MARTIN: But I read at the weekend there's something like<br />
three hundred and eighty Australians who earn more than a<br />
billion dollars a year. That's not restraint, is it? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
KEATING: Maybe in the top end of the executive area, that's a<br />
possibility. But, as Bob said, it's not part of the general<br />
wage system and we've been running a wage system which has<br />
been delivering as large as possible wage increases as the<br />
economy can afford, plus tax cuts, plus employment.<br />
MARTIN: Put it in perspective for us though if you will,<br />
Paul. I mean, if the pilots get their money, if they get<br />
their thirty percent, does that blow the whole wage system<br />
out? PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: Simple as that?<br />
S KEATING: Simple as that.<br />
MARTIN: So you can't afford to lose?<br />
PM: We can't afford to lose and we won't lose. I mean, what<br />
the pilots have got to understand is this. They are simply<br />
not going to win. If it means shutting down the system for X<br />
number of weeks, it will be shut down. These pilots have got<br />
to understand the fact that they're flying up there, you know,<br />
above the clouds, in the clouds, but they are not above and<br />
beyond ordinary wage and salary earners. You look at your<br />
audience, the people here, they're, themselves or their<br />
husbands. Look, a person who's a tradesperson, the training<br />
involved in becoming a qualified tradesperson is, in a sense,<br />
more difficult that becoming a pilot. I mean, I learnt to<br />
fly. MARTIN: I heard you say-that. Do you have a licence s till?<br />
O PM: No. I flew with the Royal Airforce when I was at Oxford.<br />
And, look, learning to fly is not something extraordinarily<br />
difficult. As Chippy said, if you can't learn to fly in seven<br />
hours, you know, you're not . Now the people who are out<br />
there..<br />
MARTIN: But that underestimates the responsibility though,<br />
Bob? PM: Of course, but their responsibility hasn't increased by<br />
thirty percent overnight. I mean, bus drivers have got<br />
responsibility. There are more people, there's about, at the<br />
maximum, I mean, there's about six percent of the Australian<br />
population fly. But, all the time, people are, their lives,<br />
the majority of peoples lives are in the hands of a whole lot<br />
of other people who don't kid themselves about the glamour<br />
that pilots try and attach to themselves. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
MARTIN: The six percent maybe right. But I found yesterday<br />
circling a tourist spot like Cairns, flying back yesterday, I<br />
read that tourism now has become our biggest export earner<br />
above wool. So it's more than six percent. It's affecting<br />
all those people who want to come to Australia to spend lots<br />
of money?<br />
PM: You don't handle this, at least we don't, there might be<br />
some people, like the Opposition, who said well, let's have<br />
just free-bargaining, let them negotiate, if they can<br />
negotiate thirty percent, that's good. But we don't. I mean,<br />
we've got a system where the people here, the ordinary<br />
viewers, they have exercised great restraint and that's meant<br />
jobs and jobs and jobs. Now these people, look, let's see<br />
what their previous President said, just a short quote.<br />
Captain Fitzsimmons who was the previous President. He said,<br />
there is no other pilot group in the world that enjoys your<br />
overall pay structure. That's what he said about his own<br />
people. But they want to go for a hike of thirty percent so<br />
that ordinary people who are exercising their restraint, we<br />
won't. MARTIN: Do you care if they de-register, if the fact that<br />
they go on the open market and can negotiate with companies?<br />
KEATING: Once they lose their award structure, then they are<br />
on their own and they're on their own in a position where<br />
their companies know that such a pay claim will destroy their<br />
companies because it would flow into other areas of their<br />
employment and where they know the Government believes that<br />
will destroy the wages system.<br />
MARTIN: While you've been in the air today, in fact, you were<br />
O told on Don Chipp's radio program that the Pilots Association<br />
is saying today that they think management have deliberately<br />
inflamed this, in fact they want to destroy the system at the<br />
moment? PM: It's nonsense. I mean, it just is not the case. What<br />
the management wants or the Government wants and what the<br />
public, I'm sure, wants is for pilots to understand that they<br />
are no different from anyone else. If the overwhelming<br />
proportion of Australian working men and women are prepared to<br />
operate within a system, exercise restraint and get benefits<br />
from it, then pilots aren't any different. If they want to go<br />
outside the system, which is what they're saying, okay, but<br />
let them understand, if they go outside the system, then they<br />
lose all their rights as well as their obligations and they<br />
will be hit.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. The last question on that. Would you bring </p>
<p>-4-<br />
in the RAAF pilots. vuld you bring in freelance pilots at<br />
four o'clock this afternoon if the pilots decide they're<br />
not going to abide by the rules?<br />
PM: We had, I had Anseri... ana Australian in-about two and<br />
half hours yest ? diFa~~_ ith me. Just let me say this. We have<br />
contingency plans in respect of providing skeletal services,<br />
you'll never be able to replace the existing service. We'll<br />
do everything we can to provide emergency and other services<br />
for the Australian public and when the airline operators take<br />
action against these pilots, as they will with our full<br />
support, when they take that action against individual pilots<br />
and the Pilots Federation, they'll have our full support and<br />
they've got to understand, if they go outside the system which<br />
they're talking about, and I don't want them to, I plead with<br />
them, stay inside, let's be like everyone else. But if you go<br />
out, you haven't got the previous experience. That's what<br />
used to happen before and that's what's motivating. Whenever<br />
they went out before the Accord, either Ansett or TAA would<br />
give in game, set and match. Different game this time,<br />
boys. You go out and it's war.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. And the war again, just to emphasis that,<br />
Paul, as you say. There is no way in the world that you can<br />
afford, there's no way they can win this?<br />
KEATING: No, well, I don't believe there is. And the cost of<br />
them winning it is that basically the discipline in the wage<br />
system deteriorates and that means, that has a substantial<br />
meaning for every person as I've said, for every<br />
person in the labour market. It means fewer jobs for<br />
Australians because it would mean those in employment might<br />
gain some temporary short-term pay advantage.<br />
MARTIN: Alright, let me shift along. It's been called the<br />
Bob and Paul show on the road. Yesterday's Melbourne papers,<br />
Sydney papers, Brisbane. Is it the Bob and Paul show? Why<br />
have you decided to go on the road?<br />
PM: Well, you've asked us to.<br />
MARTIN: Look at that photograph. That was the Age yesterday<br />
on the front page?<br />
PM: Couple of mates there, that's what it is. We were on the<br />
road this week because this fellow brought down his seventh<br />
Budget on Tuesday. As usual, a very, very good Budget and<br />
very well received and we made the decision, before he brought<br />
down the Budget, that in this period after the Budget we were<br />
going to be out selling it. That's what we do every year. </p>
<p>KEATING: We do every year though. Every year we do the same,<br />
I do the same.<br />
MARTIN: In fact, you've<br />
We've asked you a lot before?<br />
KEATING: We've been on individually before. But I'm doing a<br />
lunch after your program, Ray, which is, I think, my seventh<br />
appearance at. You know, it's a routine thing I do. It's the<br />
Institute of Directors, it's on after each Budget and then I<br />
do the other capital cities. So we do this and Bob does the<br />
same.<br />
MARTIN: Let me clear up then what I've read in the papers all<br />
weekend. The report, using the Aussie vernacular, that Bob<br />
Hawke welched on an agreement that you two had about Bob<br />
stepping down from the prime ministership in this term. Was<br />
there such an agreement? Did he welch?<br />
KEATING: No. And the fact of the matter is, well I mean, I<br />
think that the picture you just had on demonstrates the point.<br />
I mean, we're becoming, you know, I think a long-term team. I<br />
mean, in these jobs it's very hard, well particularly in the<br />
job Prime Minister.<br />
MARTIN: It's got to be long-term because the PM has already<br />
said he's going to be around for five or six?<br />
PM: I'm not going to be around for ever.<br />
MARTIN: But five or six years. I mean, last year when I<br />
spoke, a year ago I spoke to you for A Current Affair and you<br />
said PM: Don't exaggerate. What I've said is that I will lead<br />
this Government into this coming election, when it comes, and<br />
I would think another one after and then, you know, it's time<br />
to look about standing down.<br />
MARTIN: That's certainly four years we're talking about?<br />
PM: Yeah, four, yes, that sort of order. But what I've said<br />
also is that I and this Government and may I say this country<br />
is terribly fortunate that sitting next to me we've got a<br />
bloke who is superbly equipped to follow me.<br />
MARTIN: Are you prepared to sit as Treasurer for four more<br />
years? KEATING: Well I think the thing that matters most to Bob and<br />
to me is that this is a once and for all opportunity for </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Australia to restructure itself before the turn of the<br />
century, to re-equip and re-direct itself to begin the next<br />
century. And that's been, I think, more important to both of<br />
us than our own particular interests, personal interests, and<br />
in the doing of it, you know, we're well and truly advanced<br />
along the way through it. I think we'd like to see it come to<br />
fruition.<br />
MARTIN: What's happened, Paul, have you become more patient<br />
in this. I mean, you weren't saying this a year ago?<br />
KEATING: Oh, yes, I was. But the answer is I am becoming<br />
more patient too. I mean, as you get older, you get a bit<br />
more patient.<br />
MARTIN: You also say it's a thankless job being Treasurer.<br />
Are you prepared to be Treasurer for four more years?<br />
KEATING: Yes, I think so. I mean, if<br />
MARTIN: Doesn't sound very convincing?<br />
KEATING: Well, as I say, if the public will have us, we'll<br />
have them. You know, that's the long and short of it. No, I<br />
think that, well this is an interesting job because the way in<br />
which this Cabinet operates. Both the Prime Minister and the<br />
Treasurer and a number of other Ministers in our key<br />
expenditure group really debble. in all areas of policy. So<br />
it's not just the Treasury, it's not just the limited<br />
experience of the Treasury. So it's a very interesting period<br />
in Australian life and, you know, one couldn't be doing<br />
anything more socially useful.<br />
MARTIN: Can we clear up-. Is there an accord between the two<br />
of you about when you are going to go?<br />
PM: An accord.<br />
MARTIN: Yes. Is there an understanding between the two of<br />
you about when you are going to go?<br />
PM: We don't have an accord. I mean, we obviously talk about<br />
these things and what I've indicated publicly is in line with<br />
the sorts of things I've said to Paul. And, I mean, I think<br />
there's a bit too much of a tendency to personalise these<br />
things. I mean, we're honest people. We had a bit of a spat<br />
last year, we didn't deny that, we had a bit of a spat. But<br />
the fundamental nature of our relationship is such that was<br />
quickly fixed up. And Paul puts it right, I mean, as human<br />
beings and politicians, of course we have our own<br />
personalities, our ambitions and so on. But the basic thing </p>
<p>-7-<br />
about Keating and Hawke is that they want to see the<br />
production of a more economically prosperous and a more<br />
socially just Australia. And our joint conviction is that<br />
together, at this stage, we're the capable of doing that.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. Can I just ask you then, I mean,<br />
categorically, Bob, whenever the next election is, whether<br />
it's November or May, whenever it is, that when Australian<br />
voters go to vote for the Labor Party, they will be voting for<br />
Bob Hawke as Prime Minister for three years, categorically?<br />
PM: The term of that Parliament, yes.<br />
MARTIN: No equivocation?<br />
PM: No equivocation.<br />
MARTIN: Alright, fine. Thank you. Stay with us for a<br />
moment. </p>
<p>RM: Has life become more boring?<br />
PM: How could life be boring as Prime Minister of the best<br />
country in the world. No way.<br />
RN: But you don't look like you're having as much fun as<br />
you did back in those days in general.<br />
PM Different sort of fun, I'll tell you what I wouldn't<br />
if its a question of drinking grog by a pool and<br />
being Prime Minister of Australia there's no bet.<br />
RN: What about the image-makers, I mean so often we hear<br />
now the power of television for politicians and<br />
politics, the fact that you take more care of your hair<br />
these days than we certainly saw in those days.<br />
PM: Still got some to take care of fortunately.<br />
RN: The suits colour coordinated and all these sorts of<br />
things. Also are you conscience of the image-makers,<br />
do you ever have to say to your minders back-off and<br />
just leave me alone?<br />
PM: Yes, occasionally. Sure.<br />
RN: What are they trying to make of you?<br />
PM: They've got a responsibility, I mean, if you're Prime<br />
Minister of Australia you just can't be Bob Hawke, the<br />
President of the ACTU. I mean, either you're dinkum<br />
about your country in leading or you're not. And so<br />
they have a responsibility. But I also have the right<br />
occasionally to say well I'll do it my way when I<br />
think my judgements better than theirs, that's the way<br />
it is.<br />
RN: And you do that quite often?<br />
PM: Well yes, reasonably so.<br />
RN: Paul what about you, on the suggestion of the reports<br />
that you've been told to cut down on your swearing, cut<br />
down on some of the language you use in Parliament.<br />
PM: You ought to hear him in Cabinet.<br />
T: There is a lot of myth about that Ray, a lot of myth<br />
about that I might say. But it sort of makes it a<br />
colour piece to the I mean when the Canberra<br />
journos get to their Friday pieces they need a bit of<br />
colour in their to sort of mix it up. So they make<br />
more of it than it really is. </p>
<p>RM: But is that a fact of life, the fact that if you are<br />
saying scumbag, if you are saying some of the things<br />
that are said in Parliament<br />
T: I've said that once in 20 years but I've never heard<br />
the end of it you know.<br />
RN: Is that right. There's been a few other lines thrown<br />
in their as well but is that do you have to be far<br />
more conscious of it than let's say than Menzies or<br />
Arthur Callwell would have had to be 20 years ago<br />
before television ( inaudible).<br />
T: Well it was a much tougher Parliament in those days<br />
than it is today. I mean even when I first went their<br />
years ago it was a very hard place. It is quite a<br />
polite chamber these days. I mean sure you'l11 get a<br />
fair bit of noise and you get interjections and you'll<br />
get all that points of order and all that sort of stuff<br />
but in terms of the sheer sort of personal invective, I<br />
don't think the place is a patch on what it was you<br />
know.<br />
RN: But there is so many pollsters, there is so many<br />
image-makers now, I mean, like as Bob Hawke just said a<br />
moment ago, do you have to throw them off and say just<br />
get away and let me be myself are the people trying to<br />
say look if you want to be a future PM this is what<br />
you've got to do?<br />
T: I don't think we are very affected or confected. I<br />
mean we are pretty well as what you see is what you<br />
get.<br />
RN: But will you go and review this as Laurie Oakes says in<br />
the Bulletin. Do you look at yourself on television<br />
afterwards?<br />
PM: Not always, I mean, but I always take the view whether<br />
its about how you perform on television whatever you<br />
do, if you've got the view that you can never do<br />
something better than you've done it before, that you<br />
can't learn from what you've done, then you're a mug.<br />
I've always believed in life that I can do something<br />
better than I've done it before.<br />
RN: So you go back and check and see how you performed?<br />
PM: It is quite strange in television, you would know, you<br />
could quite unconsciously develop a new quirk, you're<br />
not aware of it and it might be distracting to people.<br />
So if you see, well I'm doing that a bit too much, then<br />
you're damn stupid not to learn from that.<br />
RN: But do you protect each other as has been reported?<br />
T: No. Not really. No.<br />
PM: No. No. </p>
<p>RN: There was a " not really" there. I wasn't sure.<br />
T: No. Because I mean, a lot of the time I would see a<br />
very small component of any television I do see again.<br />
I think this will be true of Bob as well.<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
T: You don't get a chance to watch stuff. I mean, once it<br />
is gone, its gone.<br />
RN: It is not true that you two are now conscience of John<br />
Hewson and Andrew Peacock being far better television<br />
performers than their predecessors and as a result<br />
you've got yourselves down to these suits or light<br />
suits that you smarten up your act?<br />
PM: No, its nonsense.<br />
T: No. We're our usual<br />
RN: Bob you say its nonsense but I keep reading that and<br />
people out here keep reading that.<br />
PM: Yes well, look, if you believed everything you read.<br />
RN: Not everything, are they all wrong then?<br />
PM: They are wrong, I mean, I have not spent one second<br />
thinking about how I should perform differently because<br />
of Peacock and not Howard, Blunt not Sinclair although<br />
I don't know how long that's going to last, there is a<br />
challenge going on there and its a merry-go-round. So<br />
if you start worrying about their merry-go-round you'd<br />
go mad.<br />
RN: What about the image by the cartoonists then, that the<br />
undertaker image that you have Paul. Does that offend<br />
you, does that upset you?<br />
T: Not really. You pick up one of these sort of handles<br />
one way or another.<br />
RN: But this sort of Zanetti cartoon is that<br />
T: I know, but he's the one who does these most of the<br />
time, Zanetti.<br />
RN: Do you ever ask for an original?<br />
T: Sometimes, occasionally I have.<br />
RN: What about the ad then. In fact we've got the ad from<br />
the Bulletin and its been in the Time magazine and<br />
others around Australia, this one here? Does that<br />
offend you when you see it? </p>
<p>T: Not really. No. Its not too flattering. It looks<br />
like I've sort of had a hard days night. I mean, if<br />
we'd had had the fun we wouldn't mind the image. The<br />
problem is you don't get too many nights like that.<br />
RN: Well Bob do you think as you said a year ago, do you<br />
think that Paul Keating should get out into more<br />
shopping malls, more supermarkets?<br />
PM: I think to the extent that Paul's got the opportunity<br />
of broadening the range of experience. I think its a<br />
good thing. I mean as Treasurer he's got an enormous<br />
responsibility of helping prepare policy and then<br />
talking to sectors of the Australian community that are<br />
decision makers and so on. And for instance after this<br />
he's going to talk to about 400 Institute of<br />
Directors. I need to get the message across. But<br />
there is a lot of that to the extent that he's got the<br />
time like it would be a good thing doing this thing.<br />
But just let me say this about Keating and his image,<br />
it is very important this be said, people have tried to<br />
create this picture of Keating and his<br />
RN: He's a bit wary I think Bob.<br />
PM: Its alright. I don't think he'll worry too much, of<br />
the hard austere top end of town man. Now I can say<br />
this, I've sat there chairing a Cabinet in ERC for<br />
6 1/ 2 years and there is no person in that Cabinet who<br />
is more committed to the interests of the ordinary<br />
Australian, in particular looking after those who<br />
legitimately need looking after than this bloke. I<br />
mean he's a traditionalist in that way and its a pity I<br />
think and its a pity that that fact gets lost in the<br />
other fact that he is at home with the top end of town<br />
with the movers -and shakers he's got to be, he's got<br />
to have a rapport with them and be able to talk to<br />
them. He can do that better than any Treasurer in this<br />
country but never forget the other fact.<br />
RN: But you, Bob, I mean you've been there, you've been<br />
with workers. They're sitting at home now watching<br />
the shift workers they're saying oh come on Bob give<br />
us a break.<br />
PM: Well lets make the point about the workers. Your word<br />
who are sitting at home, there is 1 1/ 2 million more of<br />
those sitting at home or going to be sitting at home at<br />
the end of their work than there were when we came to<br />
office. Four times more work being created under us<br />
than before.<br />
RN: But my point about your suggestion last year, that he<br />
should go out amongst supermarkets is that he doesn't<br />
relate to orindary people. Ordinary people don't see<br />
him the way they see you. They see you at football<br />
games and other games and other things. And they don't<br />
see Paul Keating there. </p>
<p>PM: OK. But look you don't want everyone in the image of<br />
Bob Hawke, you don't what everyone in the image of Paul<br />
Keating.<br />
T: I also get around a bit. I went to the grand final<br />
with Bob last year in NSW.<br />
RM: Who's going to win this year Paul?<br />
T: I'm not sure mate. I think my team<br />
214: Do you know who is in the final five?<br />
PM: South Sydney mate.<br />
T: Canterbury is not going to make it I'm a Canterbury<br />
man.<br />
214: But that is my point do you know who is in the top<br />
five at the moment in the VFL?<br />
T: No I don't.<br />
214: I bet you do?<br />
PM: Yeh. I mean I come from Victoria.<br />
RM: But I'm talking about Sydney, he comes from Sydney.<br />
T: I know but the other thing is Ray. I do get around a<br />
lot. I see a lot of people, I go to a lot of orindary<br />
situations, I mean, I wander around. For instance if<br />
I'm in Sydney, I wander through shops I wander through<br />
the street, people come up and talk to you. And the<br />
other thing is, I started work when I was 15 years of<br />
age in the Sydney County Council in Sydney. I was down<br />
those sub stations under the ground at half past seven<br />
in the morning with the cockroaches running up your<br />
legs.<br />
214: A few years ago.<br />
T: Yeh I know. But I stayed with that group of people<br />
until really I came to Canberra. I mean I lived in my<br />
electorate for 40 years from when I was born.<br />
RN: The point's still you've got to, this is a hard act<br />
to follow. If you're going to be Prime Minister.<br />
Here's a bloke who is seen as a folk hero at the risk<br />
of embarrassing him. Here's a bloke who actually goes<br />
to the football and races you don't. You're the<br />
completely opposite.<br />
T: No but I keep an eye on those interests as well, but I<br />
have another set of interests which I think are also<br />
interesting for Australians, you know. I mean I am<br />
interested in art and music and other things, so is Bob<br />
by the way, and you know </p>
<p>RN: It is often we get the image of you referring to<br />
Australians as trolley pushers and Hills Hoist mob and<br />
so on almost with disdain.<br />
PM: You've used that phrase once.<br />
RN: What was it about?<br />
T: It was about saying it might be better for somebody<br />
living in the far western suburbs of Sydney and<br />
Melbourne, who are living as you often see, people<br />
particularly women home in isolated situations with not<br />
much facility, no density around them, no shopping<br />
centre. And I was simply making the point we ought to<br />
be thinking about the way Australians live that there<br />
is a better way to live. That simply putting people<br />
out, further and further out away from all the<br />
facilities. I should have thought a pretty legitimate<br />
point you know and one. It is very easy for all the<br />
people doing well who are in the inner city or on the<br />
waterfronts or anything else. But for the people who<br />
are not, who are just pushed out there in those<br />
subdivisions, that don't have the kind of<br />
RN: We are talking about fact. I mean you can frown about<br />
what my question is on to now, but I'm talking about<br />
perception. The perception out there is this is the<br />
sort of man who is going to follow you.<br />
PM: Look, life, whether it is political life or other life<br />
life is made up of facts and perception and I would<br />
suggest that in the end, the facts are the most<br />
important thing. And I've said what the fact is about<br />
Keating. The fact is that<br />
RN: Politically they might not be Bob, perceptions can be<br />
more important.<br />
PM: But in the end if Keating was in fact comtemptuous of<br />
ordinary people. If Keating was only concerned with<br />
the topic that would be the most important thing. That<br />
fact.<br />
RN: Sentimental to the last tear drop. When was the last<br />
time you've cried?<br />
T: Its a while since I've cried. But I'm sentimental, you<br />
know, I think one either is or isn't, and I am. But<br />
the point Bob makes about<br />
RN: But what would make you cry? What makes you cry.<br />
T: Oh, some human tragedies<br />
RN: Your family? </p>
<p>T: The family is always the thing that makes you cry.<br />
RN: But would you cry over Chinese dying in Tiernament<br />
Square?<br />
T: No. I didn't cry over it but I was very sad about it.<br />
Very sad.<br />
RN: Why did you cry?<br />
PM: Well look, lets face up to this, I would be<br />
RN: I'm not putting you down.<br />
PM: No. I know you're not. But let's face right up to<br />
it. I would be very much more comfortable publicly if<br />
on occasion I didn't cry in public. I would be much<br />
more comfortable. I get no pleasure out of it. I<br />
don't try and do it. It is a physiological fact of my<br />
life that that happens. It has happened over a long<br />
period of time. Its more obvious now when I'm in the<br />
public eye. If I could do something to stop it I would<br />
because it would be more comfortable. Because it<br />
becomes somewhat disconcerting topic of conversation.<br />
But that is the way I am. And if I've got to take Bob<br />
Hawke, warts and all, well if have to and it doesn't<br />
sound too modest, I'll put up with what I've got<br />
thanks. Including the problems.<br />
T: But again Ray, Bob's point is right. The<br />
sentimentality is one thing but when you talk about<br />
support for families which we've done with the family<br />
allowance in the last couple of years which is<br />
enormous. Support for pensioner renters, support for<br />
pensioners generally, support for single mums with<br />
kids. It takes the sentimentality to the next year's<br />
full step. That-is to help them and that is what the<br />
Government ' s about.<br />
RN: Do you think they know what you're going on about<br />
Paul. Do they recognise that?<br />
T: Oh I think so. I think many people know. I get lots<br />
of nice letters from women and from families.<br />
RN: I was going to ask you about that.<br />
T: A lot of them.<br />
RN: Can I ask you back on the front page again today Mr<br />
Hawke is one of your senior numbers men, numbers<br />
cruncher Robert Ray talking about an election maybe<br />
November, I thought last week you were talking about<br />
May or March?<br />
PM: Yes I was talking about next year. I'm the one who<br />
makes the decision not Robert. </p>
<p>RM: But can't you get your act together, can't you get your<br />
Cabinet ministers, why aren't they, can't you say ' hang<br />
on' its not on.<br />
PM: Getting your act together, now look mate, if you're<br />
talking about getting your act together you're on the<br />
wrong side of politics, have a look at the other mob.<br />
RM: I mean Robert Ray is one of the great numbers crunchers.<br />
PM: Robert Ray is saying that his judgement, it could be<br />
in-opporutune to have one then and that's a fair<br />
comment, it could be, it won't be though.<br />
RM: It could be, I mean you're mudding the water again, in<br />
this year, definitely not this year?<br />
PM: Oh it won't be this year.<br />
RM: It won't be this year, alright.<br />
PM: Yeh, it won't be this year.<br />
RM: OK, alright. What about a debate with Andrew Peacock<br />
when you<br />
PM: I've already said if he's the leader then, which is<br />
becoming increasingly unlikely, increasingly unlikely.<br />
RM: You think he could be gone do you?<br />
PM: Oh yeh, could be gone.<br />
RM: Who will take over?<br />
PM: Well that's a good question. Who do you reckon Paul?<br />
T: Well some of them have got McLachlan in mind, that is<br />
why they're trying to move him out<br />
PM: There is a God.<br />
T: But some others might try and move Chaney down, so<br />
there'd be a God on both counts.<br />
RM: So you don't mind whether it's Fred Chaney or Ian<br />
McLachlan.<br />
T: We take on all comers, we knock over whoever is in<br />
front of us, that's our policy. Just bring them on one<br />
after the other.<br />
RM: It's got nothing to do with arrogance at all? </p>
<p>T: No, no because they're saying they can run the show<br />
better than us, we say just bring you're people on one<br />
at a time, one at a time.<br />
PM: But seriously<br />
RM: Can I be serious about Peacock then, does it stick in<br />
your craw the fact that people say he beat you in<br />
debate last time:<br />
PM: No it doesn't. I've just made the observation if<br />
Andrew and the Libs want to make judgements about 1990,<br />
in terms of 1984, and the condition of Bob Hawke in<br />
1984, no-one will be happier than Bob Hawke because<br />
1990 will not be 1984.<br />
RN: But why can't you say with that confidence then, why<br />
can't you say yes I'll take him on.<br />
PM: I've already indicated that<br />
RN: But you'll do it.<br />
PM: I've already indicated I'm quite happy whoever it is,<br />
and I wasn't just being mischievous I might say before,<br />
Paul and I can be mischievous at times.<br />
RN: I find it hard to believe.<br />
PM: I wouldn't put too serious odds on Andrew leading them<br />
into the next election.<br />
RN: So if it is Fred Chaney or Ian McLachlan you're quite<br />
happy to debate them as well?<br />
PM: Yeh, sure.<br />
RN: Paul, he's callea you, Bob's called you the world's<br />
greatest Treasurer.<br />
T: I got that handle a few years ago, unfortunately from a<br />
Eurpoean magazine, I would have been much better<br />
without it, much, much better without it.<br />
RN: Would you call him the world's, greatest Prime<br />
Minister?:<br />
T: I think it's for anyone leading a social democratic<br />
party likes ours that that is a party of economic<br />
competence with compassion, I think that is a handle I<br />
could very graciously give him, absolutely.<br />
RN. Could you live with that? </p>
<p>PM: Yes.<br />
RM: Now listen you've mentioned earlier about letters you<br />
get, why, according to your press secretary a few<br />
months back, why are you so popular with young women of<br />
Australia.<br />
T: I get a lot of letters from young people generally,<br />
from young people generally, for some reason I do well<br />
with them, but I also do well with all the people I've<br />
helped with the programs I've mentioned before the<br />
family allowance supplement and<br />
PM: Isn't it about time we got on to an area of a different<br />
argument, I mean it's been sweetness and light, which<br />
is a reflection of a reality, but he's been getting a<br />
bit cheeky lately, I mean he's being trying to push<br />
some line, that the research shows that he's the<br />
greatest sex appeal, where did you get that from?<br />
T: There's just a little hint in the Cameron research that<br />
maybe he was not quite sitting on the perch alone in<br />
this respect you see.<br />
RN: Which research was this, Paul.<br />
T: The Cameron research, ANOP's research, there was just<br />
some, some element of rivalry in these stakes.<br />
RN: What do you think that you've got that Bob Hawke<br />
doesn't have?<br />
T: I don't know, it's all in the eyes of the beholder.<br />
RN: Well, have you got those ( inaudible), to try and<br />
improve your act a little, because we noqted that<br />
interview in Canberra that you gave Paul, and we've got<br />
this one for you, which has come courtesy of the secret<br />
garden, you might open that to improve your standing,<br />
and just so you don't feel out of it Bob, you won't be<br />
embarrassed by it, let me assure you, a couple of<br />
things here we think you need.<br />
PM: What you got there mate?<br />
RN: A pair of silk pyjamas for you.<br />
T: Well that'll beat the stripped cotton won't it.<br />
RN: Anita will be pleased, we got them for you today.<br />
T: They're definitely a step up.<br />
PM. You will look reasonably sexy in those son. </p>
<p>T: I suppose I can't parade in them, but I'm sure if I<br />
could, I could probably do better in the Cameron<br />
research for the next quarter.<br />
RN: What you'd outdo the boss?<br />
T: Well, I'd give him a bit more of a nudge.<br />
RN: Can I just ask you with this sort of image, we thought<br />
of Anita as well, we thought of your wife and children<br />
of you parading around in the other old PJ's, that we<br />
thought were pretty boring, we gave you this one, but<br />
if you move up to this job, that you aspire to, can you<br />
live with the sort of public pressure that Bob Hawke<br />
and Hazel Hawke and the family have to have in terms of<br />
the focus on you and your four children.<br />
T: I suppose, it's a case of have to, if that were to be<br />
the case, but it is hard on families I think.<br />
RN: You speak of your son being beaten up in the schoolyard<br />
because his old man is the Treasurer.<br />
T: All that sort of thing happens, and you know, I mean,<br />
Bob attested to that often, you can only do these jobs<br />
with the minimum of distraction for your family, the<br />
best you can, but it depends on the environment.<br />
RN: Would you warn a man, Bob, after your experience that<br />
unless you can take that pressure, unless you can take<br />
the probe of the cameras and your personal life to get<br />
out of it.<br />
PM: Yes, of course, but that is the inevitable, unavoidable<br />
part of, but I've watched Paul in action and let me say<br />
this there really is not just in my Cabinet, but I<br />
don't think there is anyone in Parliament who, given<br />
the pressures that they have has been able to manage<br />
the closeness to his family, that this bloke has. I<br />
mean he shifted to Canberra and gets as much time as he<br />
can with them. Can I just tell a very human story<br />
about him, he won't mind if I do, I'm still going to<br />
tell it. You know we were preparing the Budget. We<br />
were there till all hours of the night, and he came in<br />
the next morning. He was looking a bit whacko, even<br />
more than I thought. He got home and when he got home<br />
Anita had had a new thing there for vacuuming the<br />
carpet. So here's the Treasurer of Australia after<br />
sitting in ERC, had spent about 2 1/ 2 hours, this is<br />
going through to the you know, getting about 2 or 3<br />
hours sleep, this is in the middle of it. </p>
<p>T: No what happened Ray, that one of the kids was sick on<br />
the carpet. Anita said well look you know you can<br />
never quite successfully do with that, I'll get one of<br />
these machines you see to clean it. So I got the<br />
machine, so I did the halls and she said well look you<br />
better do where the kids put their feet in the TV room,<br />
so I said move the thing and I'll do the damn lot. The<br />
next the halls, so I did everything in the house and<br />
finished at two in the morning.<br />
RM: So you just run the country today and now you run the<br />
house.<br />
PM: I'd say it's Anita running it to some extent.<br />
T: The guy in the Cabinet room said, ' well if you offer a<br />
cheap rate, you can do my place'.<br />
RM: Alright, thank you both for talking to us, we<br />
appreciate it very much indeed.<br />
