PRIME MINISTER 38/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATLNG MP<br />
SOUTH AFRICAN ELECTIONS<br />
I wholcheartedly welcome the South African election result. It is a vindication of the<br />
many years of struggle in South Africa and a triumph for the democratic process.<br />
I would like to pay particular tribute to the leadership and vision shown both by<br />
NelsonMandela and F W De Klerk in the negotiations which led to these historic<br />
elections. Despite earlier violence and some minor practical problems in the electoral<br />
process, the elections represent the triumph of moderation over extremism and reason<br />
over anarchy. Ultimately, it is the spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness shown by all<br />
parties, especially those who were the victims of apartheid, which has made these<br />
elections so remarkable.<br />
I am very pleased that Australia has been able to play a leading role both in supporting<br />
the fight against apartheid and in ensuring the success of the elections in South Africa.<br />
I am sure that all Australians will join with me in offering best wishes to<br />
Prosident-elcct Mandela, the incoming South African Government and all the citizens<br />
of the new South Africa in meeting the many difficult challenges which lie ahead.<br />
Australia stands ready to assist where it can in this task. I look forward to developing<br />
a strong and enduring relationship between our two countries.<br />
I am sending messages of congratulations to Mr Mandela and to President De Klerk<br />
CANBERRA<br />
