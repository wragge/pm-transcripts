MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME NMflII1STER AND GENERIJL DALY<br />
Statement bLLhe Prime Minister, Mr. john Gorton.<br />
An article in The Australian today purported to report details of a<br />
conversation between General Sir Thomas Daly and the Prime Minister.<br />
Allegations in the article that General Sir Thomas Daly criticised the<br />
Minister for Defence are untrue.<br />
On Monday 1 March I learnt that Otories were circulating Lithe Press<br />
Gallery alleging that serious criticisms of the Army were being made by " Defence<br />
sources". Those criticisms were to the effect that it had been necessary to call in<br />
J. 1. 0. to report on the Army's activities, that the Army was Seeking to' " sabotage" ci~ tl<br />
action, and that the Army had operated outside Ohuoc Toi Provu-ce without proper<br />
permission. According to press rumours General Sir Thomas Daly was named in<br />
these reparts. On hearing this, and on hearing that a newspaper proposed to publish<br />
these rumours the next day, I rang Sir Thomas Daly and asked if he hiad heard of<br />
these canards. Sir Thomas said he had not and I asked him to call at once.<br />
The purpose of this was to warn Sir Thomas Daly o~ f what was being said.<br />
It was also to make three things clear.<br />
The first was that all there was to go on was rumours in ths-Press Gallery<br />
and there was no indication as to whether there was any truth in the stories that these<br />
rumours had originated from Defence sources.<br />
The second was to make it clear that I knew the allegation~ s against the Army<br />
were false, that I had the utmost confidence in the Army and its commanders and<br />
that I wanted Sir Thomas Daly and the Army to ' know this.<br />
And the third was that if these false allegations agaist the Army appeared<br />
publicl:.' they would be denied at the highest level. We did not propose to allow<br />
servicemen to be subjected to such unjustified criticism without fully defending<br />
them. This has been done, unequivocally, by the Minister for DefEence, and by<br />
a joint statement issued by the Chief of the General Staff and the Minister for Defence.<br />
At no time did Sir Thomas Daly " denounce" the Miniister for0-Defence or<br />
accuse him of disloyalty to the Army or to the Army Minister.<br />
