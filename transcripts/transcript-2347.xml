FOR PRESS: PM No.. 4/ 1971<br />
AUSTRALIAN RELIEF ASSISTANCE FOR MALAYSIA<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia Mr. John Gorton, announced today<br />
that equipment to the value of $ A90, 000 ($ M306, 000) would be provided by<br />
Australia as relief assistance to Malaysia for reconstructioni following the<br />
recent disastrous floods.<br />
Mr. Gorton said the equipment would be in the form of two 100-foot<br />
prefabricated transportable steel Bailey bridges which would be used to help<br />
restore communications in the flooded areas.<br />
The bridges would be supplied immediately by the Australian<br />
Army in Singapore. The Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur was in touch<br />
with the Malaysian flood relief authorities to enable urgent arrangements to<br />
be made to move the bridges to the areas where they were required.<br />
While in Singapore for the Prime Ministers' Conference, Mr. Gorton<br />
has had talkcs with the Malaysian Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak, about<br />
what Australian assistance might best meet Malaysia's relief needs.<br />
The decision to provide the bridges followed these personal discussions.<br />
In a message to ' Thn Razak on 6 January, Mr. Gorton had expressed<br />
distress at reports of the floods, and had confirmed an immediate offer of<br />
Australian helicopters and Dakota transport aircraft based at Butterworth to<br />
support emergency relief operations.<br />
He asked Tun Razak to let him know if there were other ways in<br />
which Australia might be of assistance.<br />
On 7 January, Tun Razak acknowledged this message welcoming and<br />
expressing appreciation of Mvr. Gorton's offer of help.<br />
In addition to the gift of steel bridges, supplies of blankets for immediate<br />
relief have been provided by the Australian Red Gross Society.<br />
