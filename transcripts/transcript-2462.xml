FOR PRESS: PM. No. 84/ 1971.<br />
FAILURE TO SUSTAIN A QUORUM<br />
State ment by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
It is the responsibility of the Government<br />
Parties to have sufficient Members in the House to maintain quorums<br />
when the division bells are rung, in order that the business of the<br />
Hose should proceed.<br />
I am informed that this afternoon on the ringing of the bells,<br />
the House was two short of a quorum.<br />
The fact that there were enough Government Members in<br />
the Pajliamentary precincts to sustain a quorum was not a satisfactory<br />
reason for their failure to promptly answer the bells.<br />
I regret that the quorum was not maintained and I treat the<br />
matter extremely seriously both from the point of view of the business<br />
of the House and of sustaining the prestige and authority of the<br />
Parliament. I take the matter so seriously that I have instructed that<br />
this be the first item on the Business Paper of the Joint Parties at<br />
the next meeting.<br />
CANBERRA, 26 August, 1971. </p>
