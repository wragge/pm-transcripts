TRIBUTE TO MR. HOLT ON NATIONAL RADIO BY<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER. THE RT. HON. JOHfN Mc~ l," EN. M. P.<br />
Harold Holt and I have been Parliamentary colleagues<br />
and intimate friends for more than 30 years. As two men in<br />
Australian political life we enjoyed a long and understanding<br />
relationship. His presumed untimely death is a tragedy for us<br />
as a nation and for many thousands as individuals.<br />
W He had great personal charm. He was one of the<br />
warmest and most friendly persons one could know. He was a<br />
humble man. The great and important offices he held did not<br />
change this. He certainly was a man of honesty and of great<br />
courage. In some ways I think he was at his best when the<br />
going was difficult, when he sensed a challenge.<br />
As a Minister he was responsible for some notable<br />
measures for child endowment; for continuing the active<br />
immig-ration programme commenced by Mr. Arthur Calwell in the<br />
1940' s for improved relations on the waterfront; for orientating<br />
our policies towards Asia; and for a firm commitment with our<br />
great Ally the United States in the cause of freedom in Viet<br />
N am. All this he achieved without weakening our British ties.<br />
He brought to his administration a breadth of humanity,<br />
a concern for the welfare of the individual. He had a strong<br />
belief in the rights of the citizens to be made aware of the<br />
Government's policies and its purposes. In this he had an<br />
influence on all his colleagues.<br />
We will miss him as a friend and leader. will miss<br />
the wisdom of his counsel.<br />
Now we must face the future with the same resolution,<br />
the same energy and the same imagination which endeared him to<br />
all of us.<br />
Canberra, 19th December, 1967.<br />
