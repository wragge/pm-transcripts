SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G, WHITLAM, QC,, M. P.,<br />
TO THE N, SW. COUNTRY PRESS ASSOCIATION, QUEANBEYAN,.-<br />
THURSDAY 24 OCTOBER 1974.<br />
THE REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON AUSTRALIA'S<br />
RURAL POLICY THE GREEN. PAPER DREW ATTENTION TO A<br />
VERY REAL DIFFICULTY FACED BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
AND BY INFERENCE POINTED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE<br />
COUNTRY PRESS. THE REPORT SAID: " EFFECTIVE<br />
COMMUNICATION IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF POLICY MAKING<br />
IN ANY SECTOR OF THE COMMUNITYX THERE ARE PARTICULAR<br />
FACTORS IN THE CASE OF THE FARM SECTOR THAT OUGHT TO BE<br />
GIVEN CAREFUL CONSIDERATION SINCE THEY SUGGEST RATHER<br />
SPECIAL NEEDSm FARMERS AND OTHERS IN RURAL AREAS ARE<br />
RELATIVELY ISOLATED IN TERMS OF THE NORMAL COMMUNICATION<br />
CHANNELS, THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING A BALANCED<br />
VIEW OF CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES ARE COMPOUNDED BY THEIR<br />
DEPENDENCE ON A SMALLER NUMBER OF COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS.<br />
AT TIMES PRESENTING ISSUES FROM A PARTICULAR VIEWPOINTx",<br />
ONE OF THE AIMS OF THE GREENPAPER ITSELF WAS<br />
TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THE RURAL COMMUNITYx WHEN I WROTE ON 14 DECEMBER<br />
LAST YEAR TO DR STUART HARRIS AND ESTABLISHED THE WORKING<br />
GROUP I SAID: " I HOPE THE REPORT WILL PROVIDE A BASIS<br />
FOR WIDESPREAD DIALOGUE IN THE PARLIAMENT, IN RURAL<br />
ORGANISATIONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY GENERALLYx". </p>
<p>IN PROMOTING THAT DIALOGUE, COUNTRY NEWSPAPERS HAVE AN<br />
INDISPENSABLE ROLEX I EMPHASISE THAT WHAT WE SEEK IS<br />
A DIALOGUEe: THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE, SENATOR<br />
WRIEDT, HAS BEEN ASSIDUOUS IN PROMOTING ITx SOME OF<br />
THE DIFFICULTIES IN MAINTAINING A DIALOGUE WILL BE<br />
APPARENT TO THOSE OF YOU WHO SAW SENATOR WRIEDT ON<br />
THIS WEEK'S " MONDAY CONFERENCE" FROM-TooWOOMBAx IT<br />
IS VERY DIFFICULT INDEED TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH THOSE<br />
WHO ARE JUST DETERMINED NOT TO LISTENx BE THAT AS IT<br />
MAY, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO<br />
CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL, CONSTRUCTIVE<br />
DIALOGUE WITH THE RURAL COMMUNITY, NOT ONLY THOSE WHO<br />
LIVE ON. FARMS BUT THE FAR LARGER SECTION OF COUNTRYDWELLERS<br />
WHO LIVE IN COUNTRY TOWNSK<br />
THE QUOTATION I GAVE FROM THE GREEN PAPER<br />
REFERS TO THE PHYSICAL DIFFICULTIES OF COMMUNICATIONSi<br />
IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT THE PRESENT<br />
GOVERNMENT FACES AN ADDITIONAL DIFFICULTY NOT ENCOUNTERED<br />
BY ITS PREDECESSORK' IT STEMS FROM A BELIEF A FALSE<br />
BELIEF THAT THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY AND THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT IS EXCLUSIVELY URBAN-BASED<br />
THAT WE ARE ANTI-RURAL, THAT WE ARE DOWN ON THE FARMERx<br />
THE MYTH IS SEDULOUSLY FOSTERED BY OUR OPPONENTSr 3/ </p>
<p>-3-<br />
IT IS REINFORCED TO SOME EXTENT BY THE UNDOUBTED FACT<br />
THAT THE MARGIN OF OUR VICTORY IN 1972 CAME PRINCIPALLY<br />
FROM SEATS WE WERE ABLE TO WIN IN SYDNEY AND MELBOURNEK<br />
THE FACT THAT OUR SUPPORT CONTINUED FIRM IN THOSE AREAS<br />
ENABLED US TO RETAIN OFFICE IN MAYx NATURALLY I AM<br />
GRATEFUL FOR THAT SUPPORT; BUT IT IS IRRATIONAL TO<br />
DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT GRATITUDE FOR ONE SECTION IMPLIES<br />
HOSITILITY OR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS ANY OTHER SECTION OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITYs THE FACT IS THAT THE LABOR<br />
PARTY IS NEITHER AN URBAN NOR A RURAL PARTYx IT IS A<br />
NATIONAL PARTY GUIDED BY NATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS' THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE<br />
WELFARE OF THE ENTIRE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY, FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS WHEREVER THEY LIVEK THE BROAD RANGE OF<br />
OUR POLICIES ARE DIRECTED TO THE WELL-BEING'OF ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANSX THE IDEA THAT OUR POLICIES ARE DIRECTED<br />
AGAINST THE RURAL COMMUNITY WILL NOT BEAR EXAMINATIONX<br />
IT IS TRUE THAT ON TAKING OFFICE WE CONSIDERED THAT AS<br />
A MATTER OF URGENT PRIORITY IT WAS NECESSARY TO<br />
REASSESS POLICY OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTSk<br />
IT WAS NECESSARY TO RE-EXAMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF<br />
BOTH THE LEVELS AND FORMS OF ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO<br />
ALL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY INCLUDING THE RURAL SECTORx 4/ </p>
<p>AFTER 23 YEARS WE INHERITED THE CONSEQUENCES OF A<br />
LARGE NUMBER OF DECISIONS AND NON-DECISIONS WHICH<br />
WERE NOT ONLY INCONSISTENT WITH OUR DECLARED GOALS<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA, THE GOALS WHICH HAD BEEN ENDORSED BY<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, BUT WHICH INDEED WERE OFTEN<br />
INCONSISTENT WITH THEMSELVES AND COUNTER-PRODUCTIVEx<br />
WE WANTED TO SEE THAT THE NATION'S ECONOMIC RESOURCES<br />
WERE ALLOCATED MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE FAIRLYx<br />
THAT IS STILL OUR OBJECTIVEr<br />
IN THE CASE OF THE RURAL SECTOR I ACKNOWLEDGE<br />
THAT WE HAD TO TAKE SOME UNPOPULAR DECISIONS IN THE<br />
INTERESTS OF EFFICIENCY AND IN THE INTERESTS OF<br />
FAIRNESSK IT IS ALWAYS UNPOPULAR TO APPEAR TO BE<br />
TAKING SOMETHING AWAY, HOWEVER ILLUSORY THE PRESUMED<br />
BENEFIT MAY IN FACT BEx IF WE WERE SIMPLY WITHDRAWING<br />
BENEFITS WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SUBSTITUTE SOMETHING<br />
MORE SUBSTANTIAL THEN WE WOULD DESERVE ALL CRITICISM,<br />
BUT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN THAT WAYx </p>
<p>LET ME ILLUSTRATE A GENERAL PRINCIPLE BY<br />
REFERRING TO ONE PARTICULAR GRIPEv THE REDUCTION<br />
IN THE EDUCATION ALLOWANCE IS DEPICTED IN SOME<br />
QUARTERS AS A MEAN TRICK AGAINST THE COUNTRY STUDENTS<br />
OR THEIR PARENTSi THE FACT IS THAT WE ARE THE FIRST<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FULLY TO RECOGNISE THE<br />
DISADVANTAGES SUFFERED BY COUNTRY-STUDENTS AND TO ACT<br />
SERIOUSLY TO REDUCE THEMx WE WERE PARTICULARLY<br />
DISTURBED BY THE FINDINGS OF THE KARMEL COMMITTEE ON<br />
EDUCATION WHICH STATED: " THE LENGTH OF SCHOOLING<br />
AND PARTICIPATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION AMONG COUNTRY<br />
STUDENTS IN AUSTRALIA ARE CONSPICUOUSLY LOWER THAN<br />
AMONG CITY ONES THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE<br />
PROBLEM GOES BEYOND RETENTION RATES HIGH TEACHER<br />
TURNOVER, BOARDING DIFFICULTIES AND THE ADDED EXPENSE<br />
OF TERTIARY EDUCATION IN DISTANT CENTRES ARE CLEARLY<br />
SIGNIFICANT IN LOWERING RETENTION; ATTITUDES TO<br />
EDUCATION, LIMITED CULTURAL FACILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY,<br />
LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO<br />
COMPLETE SECONDARY EDUCATION AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT<br />
THE CURRICULUM OFFERED IN THE SCHOOLS IS SEEN AS<br />
HAVING LESS RELEVANCE TO COUNTRY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN I'<br />
SUGGESTED AS EXPLANATIONS FOR LOWER ATTAINMENT. x<br />
So FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE MAKING SPECIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
TO ISOLATED CHILDREN ABOUT 5,000 IN NSW, ARE<br />
CURRENTLY RECEIVING GRANTS TOTALLING $ 2 MILLION) .6/ </p>
<p>THE KANGAN COMMITTEE ON TECHNICAL AND<br />
FURTHER EDUCATION NOTED IN ITS REPORT THAT COUNTRY<br />
PEOPLE HAD PROBLEMS OF ACCESS TO TECHNICAL<br />
EDUCATION AND TO RETRAINING FOR A NEW CAREER AND<br />
CONSEQUENTLY WERE OFTEN OBLIGED TO MOVE TO THE<br />
CITIESX THE NEW STAGE OF OUR EDUCATION POLICY<br />
EMBODIED IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE KARMEL AND<br />
KANGAN COMMITTEES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
BRING NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO COUNTRY BOYS AND GIRLS;<br />
AND WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY THOSE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PLACES WHERE THEIR PARENTS<br />
LIVEx EDUCATION IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE<br />
GREAT MOTIVE BEHIND OUR PROGRAM THE DRIVE FOR<br />
NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND MORE EQUAL ACCESS TO THESE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AUSTRALIANSx THIS IS THE<br />
PRINCIPLE BEHIND OUR APPROACH TO REGIONAL<br />
DEVELOPMENTW IT IS JUST NONSENSE TO PUT THIS IN<br />
TERMS OF CITY VERSUS COUNTRYx WE DO NOT THINK IN<br />
THAT WAY AND THE MACHINERY WE ARE CREATING TO<br />
PROMOTE EQUALITY BETWEEN REGIONS IS NOT DESIGNED<br />
TO WORK THAT WAY .7/ </p>
<p>-7-<br />
FOR YEARS AND YEARS I HAVE PUT TO THE PEOPLE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA THE PROPOSITION THAT INCREASINGLY A FAMILY' S<br />
STANDARD OF LIVING DEPENDS NOT SO MUCH ON ITS INCOME<br />
AS WHERE IT LIVES$ WE HAVE SET OUT DELIBERATELY TO<br />
REDUCE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN REGIONS AND THEREBY PROMOTE<br />
THE REAL STANDARD OF LIVING OF ALL AUSTRALIANS WHEREVER<br />
THEY CHiOOSE TO LIVE OR ARE OBLIGED TO LIVEK WHEN THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GRANTS COMMISSION WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1933<br />
IT WAS EMPOWERED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE<br />
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ON THE FINANCE. NEEDED TO REDUCE<br />
INEQUALITIES BETWEEN STATES^ WE LEGISLATED TO DO<br />
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS FOR REGIONS WITHIN THE<br />
STATES WHAT THE GRANTS COMMISSION USED TO BE'ABLE<br />
TO DO ONLY AS BETWEEN THE STATESX WE HAVE ACCEPTED<br />
A GREAT AND GROWING COMMITMENT ON BEHALF OF LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENTx WE WANT TO SEE THAT THE STANDARDS OF<br />
ALL REGIONS THE COUNTRY TOWNS JUST AS MUCH AS<br />
THE NEW SUBURBS ARE BROUGHT UP TO THE BEST<br />
STANDARDS ACCEPTABLE MODERN STANDARDS WORTHY OF<br />
THE REAL WEALTH OF OUR NATIONA ,8/ </p>
<p>AND AS TO THAT WEALTH, LET THERE BE NO<br />
DOUBT ABOUT OUR RECOGNITION OF THE CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO IT WHICH IS MADE BY THE AUSTRALIAN RURAL COMMUNITYi<br />
OUR BASIC OBJECTIVE FOR RURAL INDUSTRY IS TO PROVIDE<br />
A FIRM AND LASTING BASIS FOR INCREASED TRADE IN<br />
THOSE RURAL COMMODITIES'WHICH WILL PROVIDE ASSURED<br />
LONG TERM MARKETS AT FAIR PRICESx WE HAVE BEEN<br />
VIGOROUS AND SUCCESSFUL IN SECURING TRADE AGREEMENTS,<br />
MANY OF THEM WITH COUNTRIES WITH WHICH HITHERTO WE<br />
HAD HARDLY ANY COMMERCIAL CONTACTX<br />
ABOVE ALL WE HAVE SHOWN THE GREATEST<br />
DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN OUR EFFORTS TO HELP THE<br />
RURAL COMMUNITY TO ADJUST TO OUR DRIVE FOR GREATER<br />
EFFICIENCY AND EQUALITYx WE HAVE HAD TO TAKE<br />
MANY DECISIONS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST AS PART OF<br />
THE FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION AND PART OF THE CAMPAIGN<br />
FOR GREATER PRODUCTIVITY; BUT WE HAVE BEEN SENSITIVE<br />
AND SYMPATHETIC IN DEALING WITH THE IMMEDIATE<br />
PROBLEMS CREATED BY THESE MEASURESy FOR INSTANCE,<br />
ALTHOUGH THE 25 PER CENT TARIFF CUT IS ADVANTAGEOUS<br />
TO THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIVING IN<br />
THE COUNTRY, WE HAVE RECOGNISED THAT THERE ARE<br />
COUNTRY CITIES AND TOWNS WHICH HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT<br />
TO COPE IMMEDIATELY WITH THE CONSEQUENCESX .9/ </p>
<p>_ 9-<br />
UNLY THIS WEEK WE APPROVED A NEW SCHEME OF<br />
ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRY TOWNS ADVERSELY AFFECTED<br />
BY OUR STRUCTURAL CHANGES) THIS ASSISTANCE IS<br />
BASED ON THE INABILITY OF COUNTRY TOWNS WITH A<br />
LIMITED RANGE OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES TO ABSORB<br />
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF EMPLOYMENTx<br />
I AM INDEBTED TO MY COLLEAGUE BOB WHAN,<br />
M. P, FOR EDEN-MONARO THIS ELECTORATE FOR<br />
DRAWING TO MY ATTENTION TWO SETS OF FIGURES WHICH.<br />
I THINK PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE THE POLICIES OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THEIR CONSEQUENCESX<br />
THE BUREAU OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS STATES THAT IN<br />
1971, 775-7AUSTRALIAN FARMERS APPLIED FOR<br />
AS 1IS'iCE F; OK; THE RURAL RECONSTRUCTION BOARD)<br />
THIS YEAR, THE FIGURE IS DOWN TO-52 APPLICATIONSk<br />
SECONDLY, THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FOR $ 487.6 MILLION.<br />
IN RURAL ASSISTANCE, AN INCREASE OF $ 158 MILLION ON<br />
1972/ 73x THIS SURELY IS NOT THE RECORD OF A<br />
GOVERNMENT INDIFFERENT TO RURAL INTERESTS OR iNADEQt; ATE<br />
TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF RURAL INDUSTRYx I DON'T<br />
BRUSH ASIDE THOSE PROBLEMSX BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE<br />
THAT THOSE PROBLEMS, LIKE SO MUCH OF OUR CURRENT<br />
ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES, SPRING FROM AN INCREASINGLY<br />
DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX WORLD SITUATIONg </p>
<p>THEY CAN'T BE SOLVED BY HYSTERIA OR FEAR OR PANICX<br />
THEY CAN'T BE SOLVED BY CREATING NATIONAL DIVISION<br />
AND BITTERNESS, PARTICULARLY THE MOST ARTIFICIAL<br />
OF ALL DIVISIONS THAT BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTRYx<br />
WHEN I ADDRESSED THE UNITED NATIONS I EMPHASISED<br />
THE INTERDEPENDENCE AND DEPENDENCE OF THE WORLD<br />
COMMUNITYx IF THIS IS TRUE ON THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
LEVEL, HOW MUCH GREATER FORCE IT HAS WITHIN THE<br />
NATIONX I REPEAT, WE ARE DETERMINED AS A GOVERNMENT<br />
TO MAINTAIN A GENUINE, A RATIONAL DIALOGUE WITH THE<br />
RURAL COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH RATIONAL<br />
POLICIES WHICH WILL PLACE AUSTRALIA'S GREAT RURAL<br />
INDUSTRIES ON A SECURE AND SOUND COURSEx AS THE<br />
POSSESSORS OF A VERY VALUABLE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION,<br />
YOU CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL PART IN PROMOTING THAT DIALOGUE<br />
AND I SEEK YOUR CO-OPERATION IN ACHIEVING ITX </p>
