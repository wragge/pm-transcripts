    <content><![CDATA[<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well Westpac today, who's to follow?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I hope all of them follow, and I would expect the entire business</p>
<p>   community would now expect the other banks and lending institutions</p>
<p>   to match what Westpac has done. These are the lowest small business,</p>
<p>   and indeed business lending rates, for more than 30 years. We now</p>
<p>   have a base lending rate of 7.25 per cent. It was 11.25 per cent</p>
<p>   when I became Prime Minister just two years ago and it has actually</p>
<p>   been 20.5 per cent in January of 1990. This is the great interest</p>
<p>   rate breakthrough that small business has been waiting for. Terry</p>
<p>   McCrann, one of the more respected economic writers in Australia,</p>
<p>   says that this new rate will be worth something in the order of</p>
<p>   150 to 400 million dollars annually to the small business sector</p>
<p>   and it's not, of course, restricted to small businesses in</p>
<p>   the cities and the suburbs. It will, of course, extend where overdrafts</p>
<p>   exist into small business loans for farmers and others in the rural</p>
<p>   sector.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes, of course, as you just said before, it's not just the</p>
<p>   Westpac change is it? If this forces the entire banking sector then</p>
<p>   the benefit to business is enormous.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I hope it does and I'm saying to the banks and I'm sure</p>
<p>   their borrowers will be saying to them: let the other banks duplicate</p>
<p>   what Westpac has done. This is meant to be a competitive sector.</p>
<p>   This is meant to be a sector where if one goes in a direction and</p>
<p>   there is a competitive pressure put on the others, then the others</p>
<p>   ought to follow. We saw that happen with housing interest rates</p>
<p>   and I believe a good deal of the credit for the cut housing interest</p>
<p>   rates had to go to the mortgage originators like Aussie Home Loans</p>
<p>   and so forth. They, in a sense, led the charge but to their credit</p>
<p>   the banks, particularly the Commonwealth Bank, followed. Now what</p>
<p>   you are seeing happening in the small business sector is, I hope,</p>
<p>   a repeat in this crucial area where so many jobs are at stake. I</p>
<p>   mean, small business has been saying to me for the last two years:</p>
<p>   yes we agree with what you have done with industrial relations,</p>
<p>   we agree with some of the tax changes you have made, we agree with</p>
<p>   the fact that you have reduced the Budget deficit and got general</p>
<p>   interest rates down, but when are we going to get a really big dividend?</p>
<p>   Now they've got the big dividend because if you remember that</p>
<p>   it was 11.25 per cent when I became Prime Minister and a rate announced</p>
<p>   yesterday is 7.25 per cent, that's four per cent off.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Does the Prime Minister pick up the phone and rattle a couple of</p>
<p>   banking cages, the Prime Minister here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I talk, Alan, I talk to a lot of people and I think I'm</p>
<p>   probably talking to even more people by coming on your programme</p>
<p>   and I would hope that my remarks and those of the Treasurer yesterday</p>
<p>   are not ignored. I mean at the end of the day, banks have got to</p>
<p>   make commercial judgements, I understand that. But the crucial thing</p>
<p>   is this: if we had not wiped out Kim Beazley's 10.5 billion</p>
<p>   dollar deficit, if we had not begun the task of reducing the accumulated</p>
<p>   debt the Federal Government alone of about 100 billion dollars that</p>
<p>   we inherited, then these falling interest rates would not have been</p>
<p>   possible.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No doubt about that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You cannot separate the two. You've got to cut the debt and</p>
<p>   cut the deficit to cut the interest rates, and that is exactly what</p>
<p>   we have done, and this is the dividend. When I talked, when I announced</p>
<p>   the fact that Australians would be able to buy the remaining two</p>
<p>   thirds of Telstra, I talked about paying a social bonus out of the</p>
<p>   proceeds of the sale. Now this cut in interest rates is the small</p>
<p>   business bonus, the bonus for all small businesses in Australia</p>
<p>   from the action that we've taken over the last two years.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Just what about the couple of issues, you've got big issues</p>
<p>   on your plate which you've to be fair inherited, but still</p>
<p>   you're the Prime Minister you have to do something about it.</p>
<p>   This question about carers, you were going to do something about</p>
<p>   it, there's 8,000 people over 65 full-time carers for adult</p>
<p>   children, it's a really tough load.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Alan, I have to say to you that of all the people I have met</p>
<p>   in distressing circumstances as a local member in my own electorate,</p>
<p>   some of the cases that I've encountered of carers, of people</p>
<p>   who have, one example I'll never forget is a lady who had a</p>
<p>   profoundly handicapped child of about 25 or 26. She had another</p>
<p>   child who was doing his HSC and she and her husband and the two</p>
<p>   children were living in a small unit and trying to sort of discharge</p>
<p>   her responsibilities to both of them in the most distressing of</p>
<p>   circumstances, and it was one of those cases that it really stayed</p>
<p>   with me forever, and I think they are a group that have been, well</p>
<p>   I won't say neglected, but perhaps not as recognised as much</p>
<p>   as they should have been and over the past little while we've</p>
<p>   been working on making some changes and I hope that we'll be</p>
<p>   in a position to say something very positive for them fairly soon.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay, now the other thing more as I mentioned I think to one of</p>
<p>   your staffers yesterday. Of all the correspondence I get and I answer</p>
<p>   hundreds of letters myself each week increasingly now it is about</p>
<p>   health care. I know you're aware of that but this four time</p>
<p>   payment of the levy of the gap of the premium and then of the tax</p>
<p>   that you pay in consolidated revenue. What can you say, I mean I</p>
<p>   know you can't say much, but look you must be aware now that</p>
<p>   this is becoming a major albatross?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am aware of the community's concerns. I don't</p>
<p>   think the full effect of the increase in the Medicare levy on high</p>
<p>   income earners has yet bitten. I've had evidence presented</p>
<p>   to me in the last couple of days that indicates a lot of people</p>
<p>   don't know that that's been imposed and that until they</p>
<p>   get their tax returns after the 30th June, they are not going to</p>
<p>   know it and that could have quite a beneficial impact on the number</p>
<p>   of people who take out private health insurance. We did make a generously</p>
<p>   increased offer to the States. We've offered to pay them 3</p>
<p>   per cent a year, each year for five years over and above what they</p>
<p>   are now getting, and in a climate of zero inflation, that is quite</p>
<p>   a generous offer but, Alan, I think I've said to you before,</p>
<p>   this is an area that remains under constant review. You never stop</p>
<p>   keeping an eye on the health system, you never stop thinking of</p>
<p>   different ways in which you can make it more acceptable and more</p>
<p>   affordable and I do understand the anger of a lot of people with</p>
<p>   private health insurance who not only pay the Medicare levy, they</p>
<p>   pay their premiums, they go into hospital and then they have a multitude</p>
<p>   of bills and we are looking at, right at the moment, at different</p>
<p>   ways in which that particular problem can be addressed because it</p>
<p>   is one of the irritants associated with private health insurance.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I say finally though that it is very important to understand</p>
<p>   that with all its faults the average Australian gets better treatment</p>
<p>   from our health system than does the average American or the average</p>
<p>   Brit or the average person living in a European country. </p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly true and you should never lose sight of that</p>
<p>   fact.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Time is on the wing. I just want to ask you one very serious question.</p>
<p>   You were very strong about guns a couple of years ago. Is it the</p>
<p>   role of the Prime Minister to really intervene, if not initiate,</p>
<p>   public debate on this continuing virus of violence as entertainment?</p>
<p>   Do you appreciate the outrage that now exists in the community following</p>
<p>   the Arkansas thing that guns and knives and all those sorts of implements</p>
<p>   can be used in movies and on television to offend and pollute the</p>
<p>   minds of young people in a way which is costing us enormously in</p>
<p>   a social sense?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, the answer to that question is yes. I think it is the role</p>
<p>   of the Prime Minister from time to time to take a lead on an important</p>
<p>   social issue even though the prime Government responsibility for</p>
<p>   that issue might be with State Government. I mean that's why</p>
<p>   I took the attitude I did on guns, that's why I've always</p>
<p>   been willing to express my view despite criticism on issues like</p>
<p>   the legalisation of heroin, and the legalisation of marijuana. And</p>
<p>   I take the same view in relation to violence and if you say to me:</p>
<p>   do I deplore it? Yes. Do I reserve the right as Prime Minister from</p>
<p>   time to time, not only to say things about it but also initiate</p>
<p>   ways of dealing with it? Yes. Do I pretend that it's easily</p>
<p>   solved? No I don't. But I do worry as you do and I'm sure</p>
<p>   many of your listeners do that we are breeding through some of the</p>
<p>   material on the media and elsewhere in our society a culture of</p>
<p>   violence and a culture of brutality which does have an adverse affect</p>
<p>   on younger people in particular, and there is plenty of evidence</p>
<p>   to link certain violent crimes with obsessive viewing of certain</p>
<p>   material and videos and on television. There's absolutely no</p>
<p>   doubt about that, the material has been researched, a lot of it</p>
<p>   came out in that terribly tragic case involving that young boy James</p>
<p>   Bolger in the United Kingdom several years ago. It's been documented</p>
<p>   and evidenced elsewhere, so the answer to your question is that</p>
<p>   of course as Prime Minister it's my responsibility from time</p>
<p>   to time to express a view and even to initiate action and naturally</p>
<p>   I'll continue to do that.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay, good to talk to you and th</p>
<p>Okay, good to talk to you and thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks Alan.</p>
