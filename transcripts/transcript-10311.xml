WIK AND NATIVE TITLE ISSUES<br />
During last Friday and today I conducted extensive discussions with<br />
indigenous leaders regarding a possible Government response to the Wik<br />
decision and related native title issues.<br />
Considerable progress has been achieved. However several important<br />
issues require more discussion. They have been referred to the Joint<br />
Government Indigenous Task Force. A fuarther meeting between<br />
indigenous leaders and myself will take place on Thursday of this week to<br />
receive the report of the Task Force.<br />
Also I propose to call an early meeting* of State Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers to discuss the whole matter.<br />
The Government remains commuitted to an outcome which both respects<br />
native title and delivers security to pastoralists and the mining industry.<br />
