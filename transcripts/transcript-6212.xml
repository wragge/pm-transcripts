TRANSCRIPT OF PM AT BUSINESSPERSONS' LUNCH, SHERATON HOTEL, PERTH<br />
28 SEPTEMBER 1983<br />
Thank you for the reception that you've given me the great<br />
numbers that are here and the warmth of that reception. I<br />
appreciate it very much indeed.<br />
Talking about recovery and growth, and as you in business know,<br />
one of the essential ingredients in successful business decisions<br />
is that of timing. Whatever else you may say about the Hawke<br />
Cabinet and the way it moves, you have got to concede that our<br />
sense of timing in. coming to Perth was impeccable.<br />
I also want to give you one of the more ( inaudible) signs<br />
of economic recovery. I am leading it myself by insisting that<br />
I have my suits washed in champagne'.<br />
I wore a suit for the first time last Sunday, as I have<br />
told some of you, to the Sydney Cricket Ground, to the Grand<br />
Final of the Parramatta and Manly Rugby League, and with that<br />
sense of perspicacity which has come to characterise my Government<br />
I backed Parramatta and also publicly and was therefore invited<br />
to the afterwards and there the champagne was flowing and we<br />
were overshowered then. I went off to the dry cleaner and when<br />
I came to Perth I thought I was right to put it on again, and<br />
look what happened.<br />
I tell you what I don't mind those sorts of showers.<br />
Brian referred to the extent of the powers that he has winning<br />
the Cup and having the dams over-flowing.<br />
Let me tell you a true story about what happened to me in May.<br />
We brought down our first major economic statement, as you know,<br />
on 19 May. We weren't waiting for the Budget to start to get<br />
things moving. As you know, I like to talk and consult with<br />
various elements in the community and I asked the representatives<br />
of the farmers federation to come in and see me in the Prime<br />
Minister's office not long after that. I was there welcoming<br />
them when they came in and you recall this was May and the drought<br />
had broken. The ' dams had opened up and the head of the farmers<br />
delegation came in and he said " Now, Prime Minister, you have<br />
ended the drought, will you stop the bloody rain". I have tried<br />
to fix it up. </p>
<p>Brian also referred to the fact of his open expectations that<br />
vie would, as a result of our visit here, be able to announce<br />
some goodies to the Stalte7 of Western Australia. I think it<br />
is probabl-y qiite enough to know that if you have got something<br />
to say, you want to say it at a time when you have got a chance<br />
to be heard. Ile had that Ca! Dinet meeting yesterday, but I<br />
just had the same sort of feeling that making an announcement<br />
out of our meeting there yesterday, it wouldn't have got the<br />
sort of coverage today that it intrinsically deserves.<br />
So, -we are leaving tomorrow morning, but Brian has been able to<br />
persuade me that it would be a good idea to have a joint press<br />
conference tomorrow morning and we will be doing that I suggest<br />
that you watch the outcome of that. I think we might be able to<br />
say one or two things thtwll be of value to this State.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, it. is the case that you, an audience<br />
like this would like me now after six months in office to<br />
speak to you about the signs that are apparent in cur economy.<br />
Where are we going and what i: 3 happening? of course indeed the<br />
last six or seven months hay e seen a very great deal of attention<br />
paid to the question of economic policy in our country. Of course<br />
that is exactly as it should be for the health of our economy<br />
is of prime importance not just to politicians and economists,<br />
but naturally to every individual and every business concern<br />
large or small in Australia.<br />
Now I think that the main features of Australia's economic<br />
performance over the recent longer period going back before our<br />
election are pretty well known to all of you. Those features<br />
were inflation had been running well in excess of 10% 6 for 1982<br />
and of course well above almost double the OECD countries.<br />
Private consumption was very weak in 1982/ 83 and as you know,<br />
private business investment fell. over the year to June of this year.<br />
The drought had very very severely cut back farming production<br />
and income and correspondingly had severely depleted Australia's<br />
capacity to earn export income. World demand for our goods<br />
generally had been cepresse. by the poor state of the world's<br />
major economies, effected. in particular by what was happening<br />
in the United States.<br />
On current estimates domestic production of goods and services<br />
actually declined in 1.982/ 83 as a whole and I want you to<br />
understand that that actual decline in the production of goods<br />
and services in 1982/ 83 was the first time for 30 years since<br />
1952/ 53 that that had happened and it was the last tiLme since<br />
1946/ 47.<br />
As a consequence of all those features to which I have referred,<br />
-employment actual employment in Australia plumetted and the<br />
rates of unemployment increased very dramatically and reflected<br />
in measured official terms over 10% of the Australian workforce.<br />
But owing to the characteristics of the economy, that<br />
constituted our economic inheritance. Now, after six months<br />
of our Government in office, the outl. ook today is very much less<br />
grim. </p>
<p>Let me make it clear what 1 have got to say. We are not<br />
stupid enough to claim credit for those thingjs for which<br />
we are not entitled to claim credit, but there are many things<br />
for which we are entitled to claim credit.<br />
We cannot of course yet say that there is totally conclusive<br />
evidence which would enable us to give the time and date to<br />
when the process of recovery actually began and as you all<br />
know economic statistics are rarely conclusive on these<br />
matters so close to the event.<br />
But, without any doubt, ladies and gentlemen, there is a new<br />
optimism about in many sections of the community and there is<br />
rightly, a feeling of the worst is over and that recovery is<br />
underw'ay. Today, with you briefly, I .; ant to examine the evidence for<br />
that optimism.<br />
First of all, it is almost universally accepted within this<br />
country and amongst overseas financial and economic observers,<br />
that Australia will undergo at least some recovery this year.<br />
Now, I would say that we forecast a decgree and it's usually<br />
a cause for worry. However, in this case the argument is<br />
altogether quite persuasive. Some pick-up in activity is of<br />
course assured by the ending of the drought, by the fact that<br />
stocks cannot continue to be reduced for long at the rates of<br />
recent quarters and by the strong support which my Government' s<br />
monetary and fiscal instruments provide and by the indications<br />
of a substantial improvement in the world economy.<br />
In that respect we cannot, of course, simply assume that the<br />
international * economic recovery! will simply flow through to<br />
Australia. I can put it this way. We just cannot hitch a ride<br />
into the future. We must ensure, by our own decisions, that<br />
the momentum of economic growth comes from within our country<br />
as well as from without and that we are well placed to take<br />
the fullest advantage of every opportunity which that world<br />
recovery offers to us.<br />
Now, our economic policy is directed to fostering, sustaining<br />
and broadening the incipient recovery which we can now recognise.<br />
The elements of our policy in the short term are to take up some<br />
of the slack that exists in the economy, to provide by way of<br />
Government decision direct stimulus through capital works to<br />
job creation activity and support for housing and to assist those<br />
who have been made adversely and grievously affected by the<br />
recession. However, and I think all'of y'ou know, that it has been<br />
recognised in the business community here and overseas that our<br />
approach, as IBrian Burke has said, is a responsible one. We<br />
have served notice and I serve again that as the recovery proceeds<br />
and strengthens, the level of that stimulus by government will<br />
be reduced as appropriate to avoid clashes with expanding<br />
private sector demands. We are not going to have a situation<br />
where the demands of government upon the market to finance the<br />
deficit, are going to continue at a level which will. prejudice<br />
the capacity of the private sector to go to the market, bocause if<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
we were to do that, the pressures upon the capital market<br />
would be unsustainable and would inevitably be reflected<br />
in rises in interest rates which would be against the<br />
interests of all in the community and so, as 1 say, we are<br />
doing what has been necessary to give that stimulus in<br />
the state of a depressed economy, but we will reduce that<br />
level as the demands for private sector increase.<br />
Our Budget policy, as I say, commenced really in May. We were<br />
not prepared to wait until August. That Budget policy can<br />
afford to be more stimulatory than it otherwise cnuld have<br />
because of the scope which the historic Prices and Incomes<br />
Accord provides for non-inflationary growth. The success of<br />
that Accord, and in particular the suppression of all<br />
unnecessary sectional claims Ys, as has been'rxcegnised again<br />
in this country, and increasingly arcund the world which is<br />
watching with great interest the experiment that we have<br />
successfully initiated. The success of that Accord is a vital<br />
component of our annual strategy to restore Australia to long<br />
term prosperity and withstand a typical degree of pressure<br />
from some quarters at some stages and at its recent congress<br />
the ACTU endorsed the Prices and Incomes Accord and at the<br />
same time also paid tribute to the business community. We<br />
have not, as you know, in these matters sat down with a view<br />
that we have all knowledge and wisdom. We have worked these<br />
things out in consultation with the important sectors of the<br />
community and I have been able to approach the leaders of<br />
business in this country large and small and they have<br />
responded. They put somewhat different submissions in the Commission and<br />
that is as we agreed it should be. But they have accepted the<br />
outcome and within their own deliberations have resp~ onded to<br />
the direct communications that I have sent to the leaders of<br />
business and in respect of their own dividend policies, in<br />
respect of the emoluments for directors, they should exercise<br />
and exhibit the degree of restraint that we are expecting and<br />
will continue to demand of the trade union movement.<br />
Now reception of the Budget and our policies generally and<br />
community perception of the correctness of those policies<br />
provides, I believe, the strongest possible case for optimism<br />
about the economy. I know that there wouldn't be anyone in<br />
this room who would disagree with the proposition that very<br />
seldom has a Budget framed in difficult times been as well<br />
received both here and abroad as was that handed down by my<br />
close friend and colleague, Paul Keating on 23 August.<br />
Business reaction to the B~ udget and to the other relevant elements<br />
of our policy has been remarkably favourable. i remind you<br />
that that reaction has been seen in the stock markets around<br />
the country. It has been seen in lower interest rates and, of<br />
course, we don't claim the entire credit for that reduction in<br />
interest rates, but, of course, our policies have been relevant<br />
to it. Also that reaction has been seen in the strength of<br />
the external capital account which indicates the vote of confidenc2<br />
in our economy by world financial markets arid let me say in<br />
respect of the external perceptions oif this government anid not<br />
its policies that you may recall the sort of talk that was foisted </p>
<p>I . I .2<br />
upon this country during the election campaign by our<br />
conservative opponents. A campaign tactic of fear and smear<br />
against the people of Australia if you're silly enough to<br />
elect a Labor Government that the capital of this country and<br />
overseas would flee and that it would not give its support to<br />
the Labor Government.<br />
Now that was manifestly an absurdity and it was a disloyal<br />
absurdity at that time. Of course, from the very moment of<br />
the assumption of office by our actions we showed that it was<br />
unfounded and reciprocally by their actions business here and<br />
abroad showed that it was a nonsense. It was a matter of<br />
considerable comfort to me that when recently I went abroad,<br />
and particularly in the United States in June I had Treasurer<br />
Paul Keating with me, we met the representatives of the<br />
international business community and the American busj: iess<br />
community in Washington and particularly in New York and we<br />
weLe well received. It wasn't a question of them seeing<br />
ideological sign writers marching through the door, but what<br />
they did see were the representatives of the democratically<br />
elected government which recognised the nature the intrinsic<br />
nature of the Australian economy and the essential characteristic<br />
of that economy is that it is a mixed economy. The private<br />
sector which provides 75% of the employment in this country<br />
which depends for itself on a stringently efficient public sector<br />
and in which there is a mutuality of concern between the public<br />
and the private sector a recognition that they both depend<br />
upon the health of the other.<br />
In the international business community understood that in<br />
myself, the Prime Minister, and Paul. Keating as Treasurer and in<br />
our Cabinet Minisiters, we have leaders and ministers who<br />
understand the nature of our economy and are committed to making<br />
those decisions which are necessary to stimulate the health of<br />
the private sector as well as the public sector and that<br />
confidence which they displayed in us then verbally expressed<br />
has much more importantly subsequently been expressed in the actual<br />
hard decisions which are being taken by the international<br />
community in respect of the Australian economy.<br />
Of course, I never claim that all the signs of the recovery to<br />
which I have alluded are purely the result of government action.<br />
But, as I say, they do stand in stark contrast to those dire<br />
predictions made by the Of-position not only as part of the<br />
election, but all those stupid predictions which remain in<br />
regard to Budget impacts. I believe that there is very sound<br />
reason indeed ladies and gentlemen, for those favourable<br />
reactions to our Budget strategy that I have indicated.<br />
There is simply no doubt that our confidence is returning to<br />
the Australian business community. Surveys of business by the<br />
Australian Chamber of Commerce/ National Bank and by the joint<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry and Westpac show that<br />
business anticipates improved conditions over the coming months.<br />
While it is true that data are patchy by States the CAI/ Westpac<br />
survey indicates that Western Australia is one State where<br />
business anticipates growth in new orders, output, and cmployment<br />
in the December quarter. </p>
<p>That confidence is in great part due to the sense of certainty<br />
that business in this country now has about the conduct of<br />
economic policy. You look back over the previous 7 years<br />
there was simply no degree of certainty and predictability about<br />
what was happening in regard to economic policy and planning on<br />
the part of governments. My Government, since we have been in<br />
has continually from day one sought fully to consult with all<br />
relevant bodies and to seek as far as it is possible to achieve<br />
consensus in the approach to economic management. It has<br />
established a clearly understood policy direction and more<br />
importantly, it has demonstrated the will to implement. Business<br />
now has in this country a further basis for planning ahead than<br />
it has had at any time since the end of the last war and with<br />
that certainty comes confidence and that confidence provides<br />
one guarantee that the recovery will not be aborted.<br />
The Western Australian economy has been one of the nation's<br />
strongest over recent years. While the world down-turn has<br />
affected the State it remains well placed to participate in the<br />
recovery. Now at this stage, of course, the recovery to which I referred<br />
is somewhat patchy. The strongest areas at the moment are<br />
housing and the rural and the public sectors. Firstly, in<br />
respect of housing there has been a very welcome upturn in the<br />
housing industry which has been gathering strength since 1983<br />
goes on. The latest figures indicate that Australia wide<br />
dwelling commencements in the June quarter rose by 13.2%<br />
seasonally adjusted from the March quarter which itself was<br />
4.9% higher than December. Commencements in the June quarter<br />
are 3.9% up over the depressed levels of a year earlier.<br />
I am glad to observe that there are signs that Western Australia<br />
will share, albeit seemingly more slowly at this stage, in the<br />
upturn in housing activity. While Conmencements are still down<br />
on last year and the remains are broadly flat for the past four<br />
quarters, approvals figures are improving compared to the trend<br />
of the year.<br />
There is still better news at one further stage back in the<br />
construction chain. Housing lending has been increasing strongly<br />
and interest rates have been reduced by many of the major<br />
mortgage institutions.<br />
Loan approvals in the three months to July are up 6% in Western<br />
Australia over the level of a year earlier and are up by 30% in<br />
Australia as a whole. In the case of Western Australia this is<br />
still a comparatively disappointing situation but I should<br />
expect, nevertheless, that before long, if not already, Western<br />
Australia will be matching the national trend.<br />
Now these things have not happened by accident. The Government's<br />
new First Home Owners Assistance Scheme comes into effect on<br />
1 October. It should add further to the housing recovery. The<br />
Government responded in August to the Western Australian concerns<br />
expressed to me by Premier Burke that there was a hiatus in<br />
home buying pending introduction of the new scheme. We responded<br />
to that by removing the savings requirement of the previous Home<br />
Deposit Assistance Scheme.<br />
1 </p>
<p>I want to say to you that the Treasurer, Paul Keating, and<br />
Minister for Housing and Construction, Chris Hurford, will<br />
be holding discussions with financial institutions to ensure<br />
the continuing availability of finance for housing. Recent<br />
reduction in interest rates, of course, have also significantly<br />
reduced the cost of home loans. Most housing lending<br />
institutions have cut their interest rates on home loans by<br />
and have trimmed deposit rates. Savings bank home loans<br />
are now charged 12% while building society rates have also<br />
reduced Indeed, as you would know, interest rates have generally fallen<br />
recently including in respect of those rates relevant to the<br />
financing of the needs of the business sector. The prime rate<br />
charged on large overdrafts, for example, has fallen by between<br />
1 and 2% since March. This is, of course, as we all recognise<br />
another major plus point for recovery. Interest rates will,<br />
of course, and I don't try and disguise this fact fluctuate<br />
especially for short dated instruments. Much, of course, will<br />
also depend upon positions in financial markets abroad.<br />
However, it is clear that the lowering of rates recently will<br />
greatly assist the cash flow position of many enterprises and<br />
it will help to under pin the firming of confidence of private<br />
investors. Lower interest rates and improved consumer sentiment will also<br />
I believe help to produce a much needed fillip to consumer<br />
spending, particularly for spending on consumer durable goods.<br />
Real private consumption has been reached for some time. The<br />
latest data for retail sales suggests that theremay have been<br />
a firmer tone to consumer spending very recently.<br />
Now, of course, our rural economy the resilient rural economy<br />
has bounced back well from drought. Wnile Western Australia<br />
escaped the worst effects, the main benefits from the recovery<br />
in production and demand will appear in the Eastern States,<br />
improved rural export performance in the new year will benefit<br />
all of our country.<br />
The world recovery, of course, as we all know, is of absolutely<br />
major importance to Australia, particularly to Western Australia.<br />
The minerals sector in this State has been bleak for some time,<br />
but overseas demand has already picked up for some non-rural<br />
exports and the economic recovery in the United States foreshadows<br />
some measure of improvement in demand for exports. I<br />
should not, however, be particularly sanguine about the near<br />
term prospects for either iron ore or energy exports, both of<br />
which are particularly imp; ortant for Western Australia.<br />
The iron ore market faces particularly difficult times be: cause<br />
of a quite fundamental structural change which is occurring<br />
in the Japanese steel industry market.<br />
On balance nevertheless the general outlook for exports coupled<br />
with an imnroved industrial climate that can best be sustained<br />
by implementation of the Prices and Incomes Ac-cord means that<br />
the producers in this State are generally more placed t-o be<br />
competitive in fulfilling extra demands. I </p>
<p>r 7 I can't conclude on that note, without expressing to you my<br />
deep and sincere hope that the current industrial problems<br />
in the Pilbarra will be soon resolved. credit<br />
and without trying to be up front about it, I can simply say,<br />
to you quite seriously, that we have behind the scenes been<br />
trying to have an input to see if we can get those matters<br />
resolved not only in an imiriediate sense, but in the longer<br />
term and I express the hope that those efforts together with<br />
the efforts of others will soon be successful.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, that then is how we see the economy<br />
developing through 1983/ 84. There are indications that<br />
manufacturers are beginning to respond to these prospects.<br />
Such indications of production as we have the Australian<br />
Bureau of Statistics production statistics and the ANZ<br />
Bank index of factory production have been showing upward<br />
trends, but it is to the local market that many people look<br />
for evidence of economic performance.<br />
When we took office we said that halting the decline in<br />
employment would be the first hard step to reducing unemployment.<br />
We are encouraged to believe that that has happened that we<br />
have reached the bottom of the trough and that we are beginning<br />
the steady upward climb.<br />
Employment did fall in seasonally adjusted terms in August.<br />
Isolated falls of this kind can always occur, especially when<br />
the economy is only in the very early stages of a recovery.<br />
There may well be other seeming setbacks along the generally<br />
upwards path. I suggest to you that one reliable indicator<br />
of trends in the labour market is attained by computing 3-monthly<br />
averages. On this basis employment rose by 0.3% in the latest<br />
period after having fallen consistently on this basis for over<br />
a year.<br />
The unemployment rate, on the other hand, has stabilised at a<br />
bit over 10%. 10.3% when we came in. It has held the line<br />
and gone down to 10.2% last quarter. Employment growth in<br />
other words has been sufficient roughtly speaking to absorb<br />
the natural increase in the workforce. In all likelihood the<br />
unemployment rate will rise somewhat again at the upturn in<br />
economic activity getting underway. This, of course, is partly<br />
also because better prospects for employment may be expected to<br />
encourage people to return to seeking employment in the paid<br />
workforce who had previously been discouraged.<br />
Western Australia contines to perform better than the majority<br />
of States in this area. It the only State to record an<br />
increase in employment over the year to the three In nths ended<br />
August and its average unemployment rate in the three months<br />
to August was the second lowest.<br />
In regard to this area of employment I believe that my<br />
Government is on track in regard to the promises that we made<br />
in the election. I remind you what thev were. I said that we<br />
would end the explosion in unemployment rates which had<br />
characterised the previous 18 r. onths that we have done.<br />
I said we would move to a situation where there would be an </p>
<p>actual increase in jobs. That has been done an&amp; will increase.<br />
I said that in that sort of context I believed that we would be<br />
able to create something like 0 million new jobs in the first 3<br />
years of office and I believs we will go close to achieving that<br />
obj ective.<br />
Overall, therefore, T come to the conclusion, ladies and<br />
gentlemen, overall tne signs are somewhat mixed. Some components<br />
of demand are weak and as you know private investment in<br />
paricuarwill take some time to pikup. Yet the<br />
indications are qluite clearly that the worst is ovr Some<br />
areas are showing definite signs of an upsurge. These, coupled<br />
with the one-off factors which I outlined earlier, will give<br />
us a good start as 1983/ 84 proceeds.<br />
The facts are, my friends, that it is our firm belief on the<br />
basis of the evidence available to us already and an our<br />
assessment of the impact of the deliberate economic p~ olicies<br />
that we have put into place, that as we come to the end of this<br />
financial year 83/ 84 in other words as we get to the middle<br />
of 84 this Australian economy will be growing at a rate of<br />
at least 5 annum against the experience that indicated<br />
before of 82/ 83 where for the first time in 30 yeara we had<br />
an actual decline. We will turn this economy around..<br />
what we have done ( tape ends) </p>
