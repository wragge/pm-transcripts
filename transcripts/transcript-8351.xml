    <content><![CDATA[<p>/ 0<br />PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />ON HIS VISIT TO ZIMBABWE AND THE<br />1991 COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MT' Q{-AARA<br />WEDNESDAY, 6 NOVEMBER 1991<br />Mr Speaker<br />seek leave to report-to the House on t] I*<br />visit I made to Zimbabwe between 14 and 24 0 n<br />My visit had four main components: a meeting of the<br />High-Level Appraisal Group on the future of the<br />Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting<br />itself, a short bilateral visit to Zimbabwe at the<br />invitation of President Robert Mugabe, and my separate<br />bilateral discussions with a number of Heads of Government<br />of countries important to Australia. In all its elements,<br />my visit significantly advanced important Australian foreign<br />and international economic policy interests.<br />Mr Speaker<br />The High-Level Appraisal Group on the future of the<br />Commonwealth was established by the 1989 Commonwealth Heads<br />of Government in Kuala Lumpur to examine Commonwealth<br />priorities for the 1990s and beyond, and to consider the<br />adequacy of Commnonwealth institutions to meet these<br />priorities. It was the first review of the Commonwealth's<br />priorities to be undertaken by Heads of Government. Ten<br />Commonwealth leaders took part, under the chairmanship of<br />Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia. Our meeting, on<br />October, considered preparatory documents prepared by a<br />special group of senior officials, and by the Commonwealth<br />Secretary-General. The main result of our deliberations was<br />the draft Harare Declaration on the future of the<br />Commonwealth, which was later endorsed by all Commonwealth<br />Heads of Government.<br />My colleagues on the High-Level Appraisal Group agreed that<br />the Commonwealth should seek to make a distinctive<br />contribution int particular areas where it has a comparative<br />advantage and proven expertise, and where its efforts<br />complement, rather than compete with, larger or more<br />specialised multilateral agencies.<br />A particular priority which we identified for the<br />Commonwealth is; the protection and promotion of the<br />fundamental pol~ itical values enshrined in the Commonwealth's<br />Singapore Decla~ ration of 1971. These values include<br />democracy, democratic processes and institutions, the rule<br />of law, just and honest government and fundamental human<br />rights. I</p>
<p>The steady spread of these values around the world has been<br />one of the most heartening international developments of the<br />past few years. And I was struck by the degree of<br />commitment to them which I found among my colleagues in<br />Harare. But we all recognised that the Commonwealth<br />countries are not perfect in this regard.<br />At Harare it was agreed that Commonwealth members should<br />help one another to do better by developing institutions of<br />democratic government. We recognised that in these areas<br />the Commonwealth's unique strengths of a shared heritage and<br />common language can contribute to a pragmatic and<br />cooperative approach to solving problems.<br />We are already seeing that happen. The Commonwealth's role<br />in election monitoring, guidelines for which were approved<br />by the High-Level Appraisal Group, is one important area of<br />assistance. The President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa,<br />and the Hon Member for MacKellar have been involved in just<br />such a monitoring exercise in Zambia in the past week.<br />The peaceful and orderly transfer of power in Zambia over<br />the weekend is a sign of hope that the democratic principlev<br />of the Commonwealth will at last take deep root and flourish<br />in Africa. I have sent messages both to Zambia's new<br />president Mr Chiluba and to his predecessor, my old<br />Commonwealth colleague Kenneth Kaunda, congratulating them<br />on this historic achievement.<br />Other priorities which we identified for the Commonwealth<br />include the promotion of sustainable development; further<br />help to bring about a free, democratic, non-racial and<br />prosperous South Africa; action to combat drug trafficking<br />and abuse: and help with the particular economic and<br />security problems of small Commonwealth states, many of<br />which are in our own region.<br />Mr Speaker<br />The full Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting was held<br />between 16 and 21 October. Forty-seven countries were<br />represented, forty-three of them by their Heads of State or<br />Prime Ministers. President Mugabe of Zimbabwe chaired the<br />meeting. Issues on the agenda for the meeting included global trends<br />and prospects, South Africa, the world economic situation,<br />environmental issues and Commonwealth functional<br />cooperation. On South Africa, the principal issue facing CHOGM this year<br />was to determine the Commonwealth's response to the<br />fundamental process of reform which had been initiated in<br />South Africa during the two years since Commonwealth Heads<br />of Government last met.</p>
<p>The major steps which have been taken in South Africa to<br />dismantle apartheid and commence the work of building a nonracial<br />constitution were symbolised for us in Harare by the<br />presence amongst us of Nelson Mandela. Two years ago when<br />CHOGM met in Kuala Lumpur, Mandela was still a prisoner in a<br />South African jail.<br />The change of heart in the South African Government<br />symbolised by his release, and by the dismantling of the<br />legislative pillars of apartheid, has been a spectacular<br />vindication of the principled stance and practical measures<br />that the Commonwealth, often at Australia's urging, has<br />adopted on the South Africa issue in recent years.<br />But equally the massive progress in South Africa is a<br />challenge to the Commonwealth to move with the times. It<br />must respond to that progress in an imaginative and forwardlooking<br />way which will ensure that the Commonwealth<br />continues to lead international opinion in working for the<br />well-being of all South Africa's peoples.<br />This is a challenge which the Commonwealth Heads of<br />Government took up with alacrity. Even before CHOGM proper,<br />began, at the High Level Appraisal Group meeting on October<br />my Commonwealth colleagues showed their determination to<br />ensure that the Commonwealth remained relevant and<br />constructive. They were determined in particular to establish a direct and<br />vigorous dialogue with the principal parties to the reform<br />process in South Africa, so that the Commonwealth could<br />learn directly from those involved how it could best<br />contribute to that process. CHOGM decided to despatch the<br />Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Anyaoku, to South<br />Africa. This week he will explore with the principal<br />parties how the Commonwealth might assist in lending<br />momentum to the process of negotiating a new constitution.<br />Australia strongly supports this forward-looking step.<br />The same spirit was evident in the discussions of the future<br />of Commonwealth sanctions on South Africa. The meeting<br />recognised the significance which sanctions undoubtedly had<br />in bringing the South African Government to the negotiating<br />table. And they recognised that as long as the process of reform<br />continued to be frustrated and obstructed by acts of bad<br />faith, sanctions would be important to maintaining the<br />momentum of negotiations.<br />But equally they recognised as Nelson Mandela himself said<br />that sanctions are doing serious damage to South Africa's<br />economy, and to the welfare of ordinary South Africans. For<br />that reason, sanctions should not be kept in place any<br />longer than necessary.</p>
<p>In the light of these considerations, CHOGM decided to adopt<br />the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign<br />Ministers on South Africa ( CFMSA) for a phased approach to<br />the lifting of sanctions. The CFMSA's recommendations<br />strongly reflected Australia's long-standing views, which<br />had been vigorously put fcrward by Senator Evans at<br />successive CFMSA meetings. We were therefore delighted with<br />this outcome.<br />In accepting the CFMSA proposals, the CHOGM agreed to the<br />immediate lifting of people-to-people sanctions, covering<br />visa and consular matters, cultural and scientific ties, and<br />air links. We are already implementing these decisions.<br />Trade and investment sanctions will be lifted once<br />appropriate transitional mechanisms have been agreed, and<br />financial sanctions will be lifted when a new constitution<br />has been agreed. The arms embargo will be lifted only when<br />a non-racial, democratic government is in place.<br />I was heartened by the views put to me by Nelson Mandela in<br />my long and detailed private discussions with him on the<br />prospects for reform in South Africa and the future of the<br />Commonwealth's role. Mr Mandela told me he was confident<br />that the pace of reform would allow rapid lifting of both<br />trade and investment sanctions and financial sanctions. His<br />confidence reflected a belief that the South African<br />Government shared his concern about the effect of the<br />sanctions on South Africa's economy. It also reflected his<br />belief that the Government accepts that transitional<br />arrangements must be finalised quickly, as it recognises<br />that it cannot continue to be both umpire and player in the<br />reform process.<br />The Commonwealth is now looking to the future South Africa.<br />Its new focus, underscored in Harare, will be to help the<br />people of South Africa manage the changes now upon them in<br />ways that will ensure a new non-racial nation re-enters the<br />international community in the best possible shape.<br />Australia is helping develop the democratic anti-apartheid<br />movement's role in the sound economic management of<br />post-apartheid South Africa. This was cited by a number of<br />Commonwealth colleagues as a model for the sort of help the<br />Commonwealth can provide.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker<br />The Commonwealth meeting unanimously endorsed the proposals<br />of the CFMSA Ministers on the re-entry of South African<br />sporting bodies into international competition as long as<br />they achieve uniLty and are endorsed by the appropriate<br />non-racial sporting organiisation in South Africa. It was<br />particularly gratifying that we were able to have included<br />in the meeting's communique specific reference to the<br />Commonwealth's support for South African participation in<br />the cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early<br />next year, and -that the International Cricket Conference has<br />since agreed to this.<br />Mr Speaker<br />In the discussion of the world economic situation,<br />Commonwealth leaders demonstrated their firm commitment to<br />greater trade liberalisation. This diverse group of<br />countries developed and developing, and from every<br />continent recognised the perils of a drift towards greater<br />protectionism. They called for a successful, substantive and comprehensive<br />outcome to the Uruguay Round, laying particular emphasis on<br />a marked reductiLon in trade barriers and other distortions<br />in agricultural markets. I told my colleagues that it would<br />be tragic if, at the very moment the Cold War has ended and<br />the world's hopes for peace seem closer to fulfilment than<br />ever before, we were to undercut our achievement by a<br />reversion to selfish, but finally self-defeating, forms of<br />protectionism. I was heartened by the strong support this message received<br />from my Commonwealth colleagues. Like all Honourable<br />Members, I hope that in the critical months ahead the<br />leaders of the major trading nations take careful note of<br />the message sent to them by one quarter of the world's<br />population through their leaders in Harare.<br />Mr Speaker<br />The Commonwealth leaders also emphasised their continuing<br />support for the protection of the global environment and the<br />achievement of sustainable development. They pledged<br />themselves to work for a successful outcome of the United<br />Nations Conference on the Environment and Development next<br />year. I announced my own intention to attend that meeting,<br />as did many of my colleagues. Commonwealth members will be<br />cooperating closely in the months ahead to help ensure the<br />success of this important meeting.</p>
<p>Another issue discussed at the meeting, which I should<br />mention briefly, was the report of a working party on the<br />role of sport in the Commonwealth, including the<br />Commonwealth Games. As Honourable Members will know, both<br />Adelaide and Kuala Lumpur have applied to hold the 1998<br />Commonwealth Games. I made clear, in both my formal and<br />informal contacts with my colleagues, that although<br />Australia supports the principle of involving as many<br />countries as possible in the future of the Games, we firmly<br />believed Adelaide has the best bid for 1998 and that we<br />would continue to work for its success.<br />Mr Speaker<br />In addition to my participation in the formal CHOGM<br />sessions, I was also able to undertake a range of bilateral<br />discussions with leaders of a number of countries important<br />to Australia. Among these were Prime Ministers John Major<br />of the United Kingdom, Brian Mulroney of Canada, Jim Bolger<br />of New Zealand, Rabble Namaliu of Papua New Guinea,<br />Dr Mahathir of Malaysia, Goh Chok Tong of Singapore and Rao<br />of India. I was also able to hold discussions with<br />President Vassiliou of Cyprus and Prime Minister<br />Fenech-Adami of Malta as well as the Heads of Government of<br />our Pacific Commonwealth neighbours.<br />My stop-over in Mauritius gave me an opportunity to talk at<br />length to Mr Madun Dulloo, the Minister of Agriculture,<br />Fisheries and Natural Resources about our growing economic<br />relationship with Mauritius, our second largest trading<br />partner in Africa.<br />It would not be appropriate for me to canvas the details of<br />all my bilateral discussions, but there are a couple of<br />specific points which I should mention.<br />Prime Minister Rao and I had a particularly useful<br />discussion of Australia's relations with India and of the<br />opportunities now opened up by his government's far-reaching<br />moves to liberalise the Indian economy. He and I agreed<br />that we should put renewed effort into our existing trade,<br />economic and broader political exchanges. As he put it to<br />me, " it is now time to take the initiative and push hard" to<br />develop our relationship to its full potential. Officials<br />from both countries will be working actively towards this<br />goal.</p>
<p>With Dr Mahathir, as has been reported, I had a very<br />amicable and productive conversation about a range of<br />economic and political issues, including the tensions which<br />had entered our bilateral relationship as a result of<br />Malaysian concerns about some reports and portrayals in the<br />Australian media. Both of us fully accepted that the role<br />of the free press in Australia was not at issue; my<br />Government regarded this as a fundamental feature of our<br />society and wou: ld not in any circumstances seek to undermine<br />it. But we also acknowledged that there were times when<br />inaccurate or distorted reports or portrayals were of such a<br />kind that it was proper for governments to dissociate<br />themselves from them, and we each agreed that we would be<br />prepared to do -this if the circumstances made this<br />appropriate. We agreed that our relationship was now fully<br />back to normal.<br />I had a valuable discussion with President Vassiliou about<br />the situation in Cyprus. I told him that I was greatly<br />looking forward to his visit to Australia later in the year.<br />I was also able to discuss the tragic situation in Sri Lanka<br />with the Sri Lankan representative in Harare. I have sincei<br />written to President Premadasa, who was unable to be present<br />at CHOGM, reaffirming to him my Government's support for a<br />Commonwealth good offices role in Sri Lanka, if that could<br />help to bring an end to the violence.<br />Mr Speaker<br />My short bilateral visit to Zimbabwe at the invitation of<br />President Mugabe was a particular pleasure for me. In part,<br />President Mugabe's invitation was a mark of appreciation for<br />the role which Australia played in the long and difficult<br />process of securing Zimbabwe's independence and I pay<br />tribute here to the part which my predecessor<br />Mr Malcolm Fraser played in this; for the support we<br />offered through our peacekeeping forces and election<br />observers in the transition period; and for our aid and<br />assistance in the immediate aftermath of independence and<br />since. I was able to discuss in a long meeting with<br />President Mugabe a range of regional and international<br />issues, including his views on the future of southern<br />Africa, as well. as developments inside Zimbabwe and our<br />bilateral relationship. I was heartened by the commitment<br />to multi-party democracy in Zimbabwe which President Mugabe<br />evinced in our discussions.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the Zimbabwe Government's<br />Structural Adjustment Program, Zimbabwe offers growing<br />opportunities for Australian trade and investment. I was<br />glad to obtain from President Mugabe his assurance that he<br />would take a personal interest in the negotiations at<br />present underway . between the Zimbabwe Government and a Delta<br />Gold BHP consortium for. a proposed platinum mining project<br />which would represent the largest single foreign investment<br />in Zimbabwe since independence.<br />Mr Speaker<br />It was a privilege for me to be able to see the ways in<br />which Australian aid, both official and non-official, is<br />helping Zimbabwe's development.<br />I visited a World Vision aid project in the UMP district of<br />Zimbabwe and saw at first hand the changes that this<br />relatively small project only $ 1.29 million of Australian<br />aid is bringing through practical improvements in water<br />supply, health and agriculture to a region where per capita<br />income is around $ 150 a year.<br />I was pleased also to be able to hand over to a Harare<br />Primary School a selection from thirty tonnes of school<br />books collected in Western Australia for Zimbabwe schools.<br />Both visits brought home very vividly to me and my staff, to<br />the accompanying members of the press, and to those<br />Australians who saw it on television here, just what a<br />difference modest amounts of aid can make in the daily lives<br />of people who are struggling to survive.<br />Australia's aid program will continue, properly, to be<br />directed primarily towards our own region of the world. But<br />I do not believe that Australians will ever want to turn our<br />backs on projects such as that in the UMP district, directed<br />towards the poorest and most marginalised of the world's<br />people. My Government will continue to maintain its support for this<br />project, and for others like it.<br />Mr Speaker<br />My visit to Zimbabwe and my attendance at the Commonwealth<br />Heads of Government Meeting were a reminder that Australia<br />is an important and well-respected member of an increasingly<br />inter-related and inter-dependent international community;<br />and that in such a world, policies of isolationism or narrow<br />regionalism will never be adequate to secure either this<br />country's security or its prosperity.</p>
