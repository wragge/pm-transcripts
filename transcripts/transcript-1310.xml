PRIME MINISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Press Conference , iven by the Prime iviAst: er,-, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
at Siniapor Airport 30TH APRIL. 1966<br />
I thought it might be useful if I had a few comments<br />
of a general kind to make, as this really is the wind-up of my<br />
tour of the various countries of South-East Asia I have been visiting,<br />
and then provide an opportunity a rather loner one than I was<br />
able to give you before for any questions which you might wish<br />
to put to me. I am sure those of you who live in this region or who<br />
have studied its problems closely will appreciate what a valuable<br />
experience it has been for me to visit in a relatively compressed<br />
eriod of time so considerable an area of South-East Asia<br />
ince leaving Australia I have of course covered a considerable<br />
territory, going first from here to Viet Nam spending some days<br />
there then on to Ubon in Thailand and into Bangkok for disucssions<br />
with the Government of that rountry, coming from there then to<br />
Kuala Lumpur for further discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
later meeting with Tunku Abdul Rahiman at Butterworth where he came<br />
to join me at the dinner given by the Air Force mess.<br />
But in addition I have been able to see Australian<br />
troops on station at various points in Malaysia and West Malaysia<br />
and more recently, including today, in Borneo.<br />
Yesterday I was able to make, after having had the<br />
very useful talks with Dr Toh and other senior Ministers of the<br />
Government here a long delayed but very welcome visit to the<br />
Singapore naval base. Ihave been talking about Singapore naval<br />
base for many years and this is the first time that I have been<br />
able to study it visually and at first hand with the senior officers<br />
who are stationed there. By flying over it in a helicopter,<br />
one got an admirable view of the base and its relationship to this<br />
area as a whole. As you will know, Australia attaches considerable<br />
importance to a continued British maintenance of the base and in<br />
my talks with the representatives of the two Jovernments most<br />
closely affected, I find that they too have an appreciation of the<br />
contribution to stability and security in the area which we all<br />
derive from the considerable British presence here, that is<br />
represented by the base and its establishment.<br />
I was impressed, too of course, with the considerable<br />
part that the operations at the base play in the total economy of<br />
Singapore and I can imagine how important it is on that account<br />
also to the Jovernment and people of Singapore.<br />
But a visit of this kind spread over so wide an area<br />
and confined in point of time to little more than a week is I<br />
believe, very helpful to perspective and to a judgment of events<br />
in the area. While I have concentrated on the countries where<br />
Australian troops are stationed, it is a fact that in each of these<br />
countries there is a common threat to be met. It varies in degree.<br />
It has been more intense at one point of time or another in one<br />
country or another; the threat of communist subversion, infiltration,<br />
ageression is, I would assert, common to all of these areas. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
* The-fac+-that-Jitis. seen at its most active degree and<br />
its most aggressive form in Viet Nam at this time should not obscure<br />
from our assessment of the total situation the fact that it is not<br />
so very long ago that we were contending with a very real emergency,<br />
as a result of communist -uerilla activity in West Mlaysia and<br />
affecting Singapore itself.<br />
The Jovernmentsof each of these countries find it<br />
necessary to either maintain forces or take police action against<br />
threats as they arise of communist activity, and so those of us who<br />
wish to live in peace and security and make an orderly economic<br />
progress and developing relationship in our affairs with -ne anotner<br />
in This area of the world have to recognise this threat and I<br />
believe we must combine where occasion requires this of us, in<br />
order to stave off the threat as it develops.<br />
We have as a country done this in the case of the threat<br />
when it presented itself here. We worked gladly in co-operation<br />
with other Commonwealth forces. We are meeting this problem which<br />
is part of the total problem of confrontation, in Borneo at tAe<br />
resent time and we know from the discussions I have had with the<br />
overnment of Thailand that this Government has become concerned by<br />
the existence of communist subversion and an accelerated degree of<br />
infiltration and communist activity.<br />
Ivly own belief is that as the military situation improves<br />
in Viet Nam and I feel confident that it will improve one has<br />
only to see, as I have so recently done the massive effort being<br />
put into the challenge there by the United States and other friendly<br />
forces. the Korean Government, for example, are contributing<br />
forty thousand troops.<br />
I was told in Sai , on that the activity at the airport there<br />
has made it the busiest in t~ e world. I was a little sceptical about<br />
this. I said " You don't mean to tell me more movements in a day<br />
there than at idlewild in New York?" and I was assured that this was<br />
so. Well it is perhaps that there are so many movements and they<br />
go through such a long period of each of the days that this occurs,<br />
but it is illustrative, at least of the massive effort which is<br />
going into the struggle there anA which I believe will have a<br />
decisive effect upon the military aspects.<br />
I have stated before quite emphatically, and it remains<br />
a strong view, that the Viet Con will not win the military struggle,<br />
and while we may face other problems in the political field and a<br />
continuing problem for perhaps a long time to come in the military<br />
sphere, the communists may very well turn more of their attention<br />
as success eludes them in the military sphere to the political phase,<br />
and perhaps to stirring up trouble in some of these other countries<br />
that I have mentioned.<br />
So not only does it become important for us to establish<br />
the security ' f South Viet Nam but we must maintain together a<br />
vigilance against any spread of this cancerous scourge through the<br />
other countries of South-East Asia.<br />
What I have seen has encouraged me in other directions<br />
also, because I believe there has been a firm acceptance by all the<br />
governments the military authorities and diplomatic representatives<br />
confirmed this for me an acceptance by all the governments of the<br />
need to supplement vigorously the military efforts by vzhat are<br />
variously termed programmes of resettlement civic action rural<br />
development and rural reforms end so forth, according to tAe<br />
requirements of the particular situation. 9 a </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It comprises a significant part of the activities of<br />
Australian servicemen wherever they are stationed. I found that<br />
General Ky Prime Minister Ky was devotin, a great deal of the<br />
time of his Government to these programmes.<br />
We went to one of the institutes where rural cadres<br />
are being trained for varied duties and services which they can<br />
render in the villages and this programme literally extends to<br />
thousands, many thousands, of individuals.<br />
The United States has clearly indicateZ through<br />
statements of President Johnson and through the other information<br />
I was able to acquire there that it recognises and is devoting<br />
considerable part of its efforts towards this material improvement<br />
of the standards of the people.<br />
And what is being done, viewed against the backgiound<br />
of the changes which have been occurring in South-East Asia as a<br />
result of the stirrings of a recognition for change, the bending<br />
of the pattern of cenuries in some of the practices that are being<br />
carried out as attempts are made to adapt opportunities for<br />
employing modern technology to the age-old practices in rural<br />
activity in these various countries, the emergence of the processes<br />
of industrialisation and so forth all these things are part of<br />
the lively dynamic situation in South-East Asia in particular which<br />
represents, believe, one of the historic movements in the history<br />
of mankind. Now how these events work out, of course, is a matter<br />
more for speculation than for accurate assessment, but without<br />
necessarily trying to evolve any of the theories which seem to be<br />
confusing so many minds as to what is happening and why what is<br />
being done should be done, I believe that mere contemplation of the<br />
facts as they are occurring and as we know them, provides sufficient<br />
base for or at least provide the material for the kind of<br />
policies which the governments, the friendly governments associated<br />
together in one arrangement or another in this area of the world<br />
are putting forward to meet this common threat.<br />
As to our own Australian forces they are enthusiastic,<br />
they are devoted to their tasks and they well appreciate the need<br />
for their presence in the areas in which they find themselves.<br />
I found them in very good heart, functioning at a level. which I<br />
think I can say without bombast for my country, has earned the<br />
commendation of whichever country they have been located in.<br />
But I think I might just say in conclusion, gentlemen,<br />
that I shall return to my own country feeling not a necessity for<br />
changes in policy, but strongly confirmed in the correctness of the<br />
policies that we have been pursuing and, I believe, better equipped<br />
as to certain aspects of detail to follow the course of events<br />
in these various countries to make perhaps a better based assessment<br />
of what is occurring there and to draw on a volume of detail<br />
which has been acquired in these most intimate discussions which<br />
should prove of considerable valine to myself and my colleagues for<br />
a long time ahead. Although the time was short, when a head of government<br />
is assisted, as I have been, in the most friendly and helpful way<br />
by other governments to see as much as can be shown, and to hear<br />
in the most intimate fashion the closest information held by those<br />
governments, it can't fail to be a most valuable addition to<br />
knowledge and experience and I feel that this at least has been<br />
a very considerable dividend which I have drawn from this fascinating<br />
tour of South East-Asia. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Well, thank You-Cop-ld I now invite perhaps this time from our<br />
Singapore friends because we beat them to the punch in Australia<br />
last time and I think we should respect their opportunity. The<br />
other boys will be seeing me a good deal in Australia. Anyone<br />
from Sin, apore who'd like to ask a question or two?<br />
Sir, Britain has offered one million pounds in economic<br />
aid to Indrnesia. In view of the confrontation, how does<br />
Australia feel?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, Australia made a gesture at the time of the flood<br />
experience in Java we gave some aid to Indonesia. I'm sure<br />
that we have all retaine a hope that Indonesia would resume a<br />
course of friendship with the countries of this area. It would<br />
be so much more beneficial, we believe, for Indonesia itself<br />
and it would certainly make the task of orderly and peaceful<br />
economic progress in other areas of South-East Asia more<br />
capable of management. But I don't think we should canvass the<br />
Indonesian situation too closely at this time. I don't think<br />
it would be helpful to an emergence from that situation of<br />
perhaps a better understanding. Those who are concerning<br />
themselves with the difficult problems of adjustment inside<br />
their own country would not welcome advice from us as to how<br />
they were to manage their affairs. For my part, I do take some<br />
comort from the fact although it was a terrible event in human<br />
terms that there has been so clearly demonstrated resistance<br />
to communism in that country. The removal of communist influence<br />
in large areas of the administration at least reveals that to<br />
the extent that there have been changes, these changes have not<br />
been sympathetic to communism.<br />
Q" DSir, in view of the latest developments Pzd changes in<br />
Djakarta, do you expect an early solution to the Ialaysian<br />
problem?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I think I covered that one in what I just saii.<br />
I'd prefer not to elaborate or speculate about the situation<br />
there. We have indicated to the Government of Indonesia that<br />
we would hope for a better relationship in the years ahead, but<br />
I shall await the events of the future hoping that there will be<br />
some brighter developments. But one can hope without necessarily<br />
being optimistic.<br />
Q. Sir the Singapore Government felt that the strength<br />
and scope ol co-operation in the economic field with Australia<br />
is too limited. Do you think that Australia would rather<br />
modify its policy cn this point?<br />
MR. HOLT: We have had some discussions with your Government on<br />
this matter and I know that the Department of Trade has been<br />
considering some views, or perhaps reguests,( I haven't had the<br />
documentsbrought under my own attention as yet) which were<br />
conveyed from the Government here to the Australian Government,<br />
I understand. But we will look at this matter, of course, in<br />
the helpful spirit that we always bring to matters which arise<br />
between a Government of Sinoapore and he Jovernment of<br />
Australia. We are ourselves a developin country trying to<br />
establish industries in order to build employment opportunities<br />
for our people and this must be appreciated, as I know it is.<br />
It is recognised here as one of the facts in the situation, but<br />
just how we can, either through action of our own or in<br />
association with other friendly countries, be of assistance to<br />
the Jovernment of Singapore in the necessity it finds to create<br />
a considerable number of a~ ditional employment opportunities, this<br />
has yet to be resolved. But I repeat, you will find us<br />
approaching the matter helpfully. </p>
<p>Sir, you were-widely quoted up here, not so lonj ago as<br />
saying that you felt Australia had a role to play as a bri e<br />
between East and West. Could you elaborate on what you ha<br />
in mind there?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, elaborate is really the word isn't it. I made a<br />
speech about this in New York which took'the best part of an hour.<br />
Interjection: Unfortunately, only the idea was reported.<br />
MR. HOLT: The Ameroa/ Asia Association had a conference in New York<br />
last year at which they invited me to speak, and this was the<br />
subject on which I was to speak. Jreat Britain, of course,<br />
in the case of Malaysia, has maintained very considerable forces<br />
here, but I am speaking of other aspects in which Great Britain<br />
understandably has not been as active, for example in the Asian<br />
Development Bank. That's roughly the sort of thing I had in<br />
mind.<br />
Q. Is it too soon to talk about another tour, Sir as<br />
lengthy tour?<br />
MR. HOLT: In Asia, yes. I've got to get through an election first.<br />
Q. Sir, there is some controversy about sending your National<br />
Servicemen to South Viet ham. Have you had any change of heart<br />
at all as a result of this tour?<br />
MR. HOLT: I haven't. I most certainly haven't had any change of<br />
heart. In fact, one sees the need for a National Service<br />
component in the Army even more clearly as we study the situation<br />
in these various areas. What I think has lingered in the<br />
minds of many Australians is a recollection of what occurred in<br />
the two WorlU vars, when Australia, without waiting for the<br />
threat to come to our own shores, joined with Allies to resist<br />
the aggression which developed and the military action which made<br />
a global war out of each of the crises of that time.<br />
Now, we have had very substantial voluntary enlistments.<br />
It is not perhaps generally known that Australia sustained<br />
nearly hal a million casualties in the two World Wars. I am<br />
sure that most people in the United Otates would be surprised<br />
to know that we lost more Australian servicemen killed in the<br />
First World War than the United States did. So that when our<br />
peetle think of an operation of war, they tend to think rather<br />
in erms of these two great world wars in which we had such a<br />
massive contribution of the nation's limited man-power.<br />
But the situation here differs very notably from that.<br />
We are not engaged in a world war. We are engaged in resisting<br />
aggression in its most sinister and subversive orms, aggression<br />
which at times takes the form of military action but which calls<br />
for skilled troops, for hard-hitting, efTective, mobile military,<br />
air and naval force2. And this is what Australia is trying to<br />
provide. We believe that with the National Service component, we<br />
shall be able to maintain the orderly regular contribution to<br />
our military needs with the least disiocation to the general<br />
national effort required in other directions as well. / 6 </p>
<p>MR. HOLT ( Contd.) Here we are-with a continent the size of the United<br />
States-to-develp and less than twelve-million to perform<br />
that task, so at the present time we are trying to carry on a<br />
programme of national development and associate with that an<br />
increasing provision for defence by way of these contributions<br />
in various parts of this area of the world.<br />
I think that as people see more clearly in perspective<br />
the National Service element they will reli'se that this is<br />
not only the most efficient way but I believe the fairest way<br />
for the young manhood of the nation to serve. TheyT are<br />
selected by ballot and certainly those who have been so<br />
selected have accepted the obligation in a manly fashion.<br />
NOTE During the changeover of tape, one or two sentences were<br />
missed. Mr. Holt said that the addition of a National Service<br />
component was the most efficient way of maintaining an<br />
orderly commitment, the efficiency of which would be<br />
greatly assisted by this scheme.<br />
MR. HOLT Thank you, gentlemen. </p>
