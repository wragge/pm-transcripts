FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 6 JULY 1982<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN FLAG<br />
Why does the Labor Party want to cause divisiveness in<br />
Australia by seeking to change the Australian Flag?<br />
Labor is now committed to getting rid of our Flag.<br />
The Australian Flag was chosen by Australians for Australia.<br />
Many thousands of men and women have fought and died under it.<br />
Our Flag stands for the free way of life that Australians<br />
cherish. It is a symbol of liberty to refugees and oppressed people<br />
from around the world.<br />
*,, Both main Political Parties have chosen it for their emblem.<br />
It is a symbol of national unity. In trying to change the<br />
Flag the ALI) is again seeking to divide the nation because<br />
there are countless Australians with a passionate belief in<br />
the Flag. Why does Labor have no pride in our Flag?<br />
What sort of political party is it that cynically drapes the<br />
flag around its conference while it commits a Labor Government<br />
to dumping the same Flag?<br />
We should look forw7ard to the Bicentenary in 1988 as a year<br />
which marks our desire to work together as one people, a year<br />
to celebrate our achievements as a nation. It should not be<br />
a year marked with the divisiveness that the Labor Party is<br />
now promoting.<br />
If the ALP thinks that the Flag is inadequate -perhaps that<br />
is a reflection of their own sense of inferiority. </p>
