PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 12 OCTOBER 1978<br />
ADDRESS AT OPENING MAROOCHY SHIRE COUN-\ CIL BUILDING, NAMBOUR,<br />
This is the first opportunity I have had to visit Nambour<br />
as Prime Minister and I must say I am delighted to be here in the<br />
heart of the Sunshine Coast. This area is, of course, one of<br />
the major growing tourist centres in Australia with now over<br />
one million visitors a year, and having enjoyed just last week<br />
a few days of Queensland sunshine, I can well understand why<br />
tourists are flocking here in such ers.<br />
This fine modern building is a symbol of the dynamism and<br />
development of this area. This district has become a<br />
productive, thriving area because people have worked to make it so.<br />
Further south, you can come across som-e sectional interests who<br />
preach gloom and doom about Australia's future. But they<br />
underestimate the drive and initiative of communities like this<br />
throughout Australia, and if they are not convinced of that<br />
simple truth, let them come to the Sunshine Coast to see for<br />
themselves.<br />
The Federal Government has been able to add its help to the<br />
growth of this area. The Government has significantly increased<br />
funds for roads outside the metropolitan areas and this Shire<br />
has benefitted from that policy.<br />
The upgrading of the national road system connecting the largest<br />
cities is entirely funded by the Commonwealth, and part of these<br />
funds are being devoted to the further duplication of the Bruce<br />
Highway north from Brisbane. But our road systems like so<br />
many of the basic services we all enjoy are in most respects the<br />
final responsibility of local municipal authorities.<br />
It is vital that local government has access to the funds<br />
recessary to carry out its tasks effectively. Local government<br />
finances have been transformed in the past two years by the-<br />
Government' s tax-sharing arrangements which guarantee a fixed<br />
share of income tax revenue for local shires and municipalities. / 2 </p>
<p>Such revenues are untied. Local government is free to set<br />
its own priorities and spend the funds as it thinks best.<br />
Furthermore, all councils share in these grants.<br />
The scheme implemented by the previous government was highly<br />
selective. In 1974/ 75 and 1975/ 76, llaroochy Shire did not<br />
receive a single grant. Since the introduction of the new<br />
tax sharing arrangements, the Shire has received a substantial<br />
grant each year. This year it amounts to over $ 330,000.<br />
Our Federalism policies have not only increased the financial<br />
strength of local government. The status and recognition of local<br />
governmient as an integral part of our Federal system has also<br />
been enhanced, principally through local government representation<br />
on the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations which<br />
met for the first time in June last year.<br />
The Advisory Council is making a most valuable contribution<br />
in improving coordination and cooperation between the Commonwealth,<br />
State and local government, and Queensland is represented on<br />
the Advisory Council by the Presient of the Local Government<br />
Association of Queensland, Councillor Fred Rogers, who comes<br />
from the Moreton Shire Council, not all that far from here.<br />
I am particularly pleased to be able to open this new administration<br />
building because it will not merely provide better facilities<br />
for the staff and ratepayers of this Shire. It will also house<br />
a new regional office for the Department of Social Security.<br />
I know many of you have been urging successive governments for<br />
years to site a regional office here, instead of servicing this<br />
region from Brisbane. Now, at long last, a regional office with<br />
a staff of over thirty will service the 60,000 permanent residents<br />
of this region. This on-the-spot service should enable the<br />
Department to provide a more effective and efficient service<br />
and I would hope that this exercise in decentralisation can be<br />
repeated elsewhere.<br />
I congratulate everyone who has helped to make this building<br />
a reality. I have much pleasure in declaring the Naroochy Shire<br />
Council's new administration block officially open. </p>
