PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17 AUGUST, 1978<br />
ADDRESS TO TIHE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW LUNCHEON, MELBOURNE<br />
I congratulate the Conference on its choice of theme for this<br />
address " The Budget and the Challenge of the Future".<br />
This 1978-79 Budget is addressed to overcoming the great challenges<br />
f acing our nation.<br />
The Commonwealth's annualBudget is the major vehicle whereby<br />
Government gives effect to social and economic policy objectives.<br />
Budgets tend to be judged from at least two different perspectives:<br />
their particular measures, and their economic impact.<br />
As the role of government has increased, scrutiny of a particular<br />
Budget from the first point of view has taken on more importance<br />
for wider and wider sections of the community. Governments<br />
claim and dispense high percentages of our national income<br />
through the annual Budget, and many people are thus interested<br />
in seeing whether the Budget increases spending on this or that<br />
particular objective.<br />
But the Budget is much more than an annual accounting of<br />
government expenditures and receipts. To look at it only in those<br />
terms risks missing the main point of what any Budget,<br />
but particularly this year's Budget, is all about.<br />
Budgets are most importantly the major economic instrument through<br />
which governments can shape the course of economic events.<br />
This is also where this year's Budget has most relevance to the<br />
" Challenge of the Future". To assess the 1978-79 Budget, we need:<br />
an understanding of the fundamental economic problems which our<br />
policies address, an understanding of the " challenge" we have<br />
been facing and continue to face.<br />
In 1975 the Australian people gave my government a mandate and<br />
overwhelmingly re-affirmed it in 1977, to restore the Australian<br />
economy to a prosperous condition, to repair the damage that had<br />
been done in the years prior to our taking office, and to restore<br />
confidence in our economic system.<br />
This faith had been severely undermined by a number of very severe<br />
shocks, shocks that moved us far from the economic stability we<br />
enjoyed in the 1950' s and 1960' s. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Greatly increased uncertainty as a result perhaps more than<br />
anything else of high and accelerating inflation rates has<br />
had very corrosive effects on our economic performance.<br />
The challenge has been to restore a climate in which consumers and<br />
investors can make their decisions with reasonable faith in the<br />
future.<br />
Accordingly, my Government's economic policies have emphasised not<br />
the chase after short-term growth rates, but getting the<br />
fundamentals of the Australian economy right. The challenge<br />
has been to ensure not merely a temporary lift in output, but<br />
lasting growth into the 1980' s and beyond.<br />
The need to take a medium-term view of the policy formation<br />
process was recognised by this government from the outset,<br />
as was the need for substantial staying power in applying those<br />
policies in a steady, resolute way.<br />
Gradually, the inescapable truth that lasting growth will be<br />
achieved only by establishing the essential pre-conditions for<br />
growth, is being increasingly accepted. This is true not merely<br />
of Australia but abroad. This is most encouraging.<br />
The problems which faced the Australian economy at the end of 1975<br />
can be summarised briefly as follows. Wage rates had outrun<br />
prices and productivity, producing excessive wage increases,<br />
as a result of which workers were, and still are, being priced<br />
out of jobs. As a counterpart, there was a significant decline<br />
in corporate profitablity and in the profit share, with disastrous<br />
effect on business investment. There had been a huge, and irresponsi..-1<br />
expansion of government expenditure, the Budget deficit increased<br />
markedly, even though tax rates remained unadjusted for<br />
inflation. Monetary expansion had accelerated apace.<br />
Inflation was at double digit rates and interest rates had risen<br />
sharply. General confidence in the economic system and the<br />
Government's ability to manage it were shattered. Consumers<br />
and businessmen had gone into their shells, private capital<br />
inflow had dropped considerably.<br />
Since taking office we have steadfastly pursued the objectives<br />
re-stated in the 1978-79 Budget speech: " First, both for its<br />
own sake, and as the only real basis for achieving our other<br />
objectives, we are determined that Australia will have still lower<br />
inflation. Secondly, and subject to the constraints still upon the<br />
economy, we shall pursue higher levels of economic activity and<br />
greater job opportunities."<br />
To implement that strategy we first need. toredress the key<br />
economic imbalances to which I have referred. It was inescapable<br />
that until fiscal and monetary stability were restored inflation<br />
could not be brought down, inflationary expectations could not<br />
be curbed and confidence in our ability to overcome our problems<br />
could not be restored at home or abroad. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Accordingly, we have exercised rigorous control over public<br />
expenditure. This has assisted in achieving firm control of the<br />
monetary aggregates. And in turn, has contributed much to the<br />
wind down in inflation,' and increasingly to the reduction in<br />
interest rates, from which all Australians are benefitting.<br />
We have consistently argued for moderation in wage demands, not<br />
only because this is an integral part of the battle with inflation<br />
but because it will allow the imbalance between wages and productivity<br />
to be removed more quickly, and business profitability and<br />
employment opportunities restored.<br />
The process of reviving the economy has necessarily been a slow one.<br />
Though we have a good way to go, there is already abundant<br />
evidence of achievement. This is especially true of inflation<br />
which has fallen much faster than predicted.<br />
In the year to June 1978, the Consumer Price Index rose 7.9 percent<br />
which was a most substantial improvement on the increase of<br />
16.9 percent in the year to June 1975.<br />
Australia lagged well behind the OECD group of countries in<br />
recognising the seriousness of inflation, but during the last<br />
few years, we have had considerably more success than the OECD<br />
group in slowing down the rate of increase in costs and prices.<br />
The most recent OECD report shows that Australia has now brought<br />
its inflation into line with that of the OECD average.<br />
That of course, is a tremendous improvement.<br />
But it never was good enough for Australia to r-ank in the average<br />
class of the international league table. We used to do very much<br />
better than that, which is an important reason why we became a<br />
prosperous enterprising society, attractive to international<br />
investors and able to sell many products in world markets.<br />
What we must now do and what above all the government's policies<br />
are designed to achieve is to drive inflation down further.<br />
We are determined this financial year to have our inflation well<br />
below that of the OECD average.<br />
With respect to the CPI, the Treasury forecast is that by:<br />
" mid 1979, or perhaps before that time" we shall have:<br />
" lan ongoing ( inflation) rate approaching 5 percent per annum".<br />
( Budget paper no. I, page 49).<br />
That could happen more quickly and the rate could be lower, if only<br />
the Arbitration Commission would be more restrained in granting<br />
wage increases. The comparable weighted average rate for the<br />
OECD countries is presently expected to be about 7 percent.<br />
Because this is a Conference looking ahead to the 1980' s, let<br />
me also say that I certainly do not regard the achievement<br />
of a 5 percent inflation rate as a satisfactory long-term objective. 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
Our aims go beyond that. I am confident this is what Australians<br />
want. We will not slacken our policies in the way some other<br />
countries have been tempted to do. It is only too easy to<br />
re-ignite inflationary expectations by taking off the pressure<br />
too early.<br />
My objective is to see Australia join those few countries in the<br />
world the Japans and Germanies -which having brought their inflation<br />
down to 3-4 percent and are reducing it further. In the context<br />
of a highly competitive world trading scenebringing inflation down and<br />
killing off damaging expectations of rising inflation is the only<br />
realistic option we have.<br />
This is the only way we will keep our products competitive,<br />
gain new mar" Ikets for our exports and attract overseas private<br />
capital to A.-s tralia.<br />
This is the route we must take if we are to be ready to gain<br />
a growing share of world trade and investment. World trade<br />
is going to be difficult for a few years yet. Australia does<br />
enjoy some special advantages particularly in the natural resources<br />
available to us. With inflation down below the world average, and<br />
withstability and responsibiiity in government,' we have the<br />
capacity to attract more than our normal share of investment.<br />
If we take our opportunities, we can weather the difficult international<br />
jx-riod ahead rather better than iaoSt. T~ hile -we have been making considerable<br />
headway against inflation, and, as I have said, we will do<br />
better, we should not overlook the fact that, at the same time,<br />
the economy has been recovering.<br />
Let me remind you of some recent indicators. Real private consumptic.<br />
rose at an annual rate of 3 1 percent in the first half of 1978.<br />
Business investment in plant and equipment rose at an annual<br />
rate of 13k percent in real terms, in the first half of 1978.<br />
Surveys indicate continuing very strong performance there in the<br />
period ahead. In money terms, total new capital expenditure rose<br />
in the year to June by 76 percent in rvining, 13 percent in<br />
manufacturing, and 23 percent in other industries. Real final<br />
domestic demand rose by an annual rate of 4k percent in the first<br />
half of 1978.<br />
I mention these factors to indicate that amid the generally<br />
subdued situation, there are strong and increasingly reinforcing<br />
signs of progress.<br />
There are still further important areas in which we have made headway.<br />
Largely as a consequence of our success in lowering inflation,<br />
interest rates have started to come down. The fundamental policy<br />
has been to see that reductions in the yields on the government's<br />
own securities could be sustained, and in that we have been successful.<br />
Unlike the policies which have been adopted in some countries,<br />
we were determained to introduce a Budget that would allow a steady<br />
and continuous fall in interest rates. This will further<br />
benefit home buyers, builders, manufacturing industry, farmers,<br />
consumers and investors. </p>
<p>The burden of taxation has been lightened substantially<br />
even allowing for the increases the government has reluctantly<br />
had to make in this Budget. To illustrate, the cost<br />
to revenue of full personal tax indexation in 1976-17 was<br />
$ 990 million; in 1977-78 the cost of full tax indexation and the<br />
rate scale reform in February was an additional $ 1,370 million.<br />
Net savings fLor taxpayers for this financial year, derived from the<br />
rate scale reform and half tax indexation, after allowance<br />
for the temporary standard rate increase, will amount to a<br />
further $ 700 million.<br />
As a result o-f all our measures, taxpayers will pay over<br />
$ 3 billion less in 1978-79 in personal income tax than if the<br />
tax rates at the time of the last Hayden Budget still applied.<br />
I have gone to some lengths to stress the medium-term perspective<br />
in which the 1978-79 Budget must be viewed, because to view<br />
it in isolation from what the government has been trying to do<br />
for the last two and a half years would be, again, to miss the point.<br />
There are those who have described the 1978-79 budget as the<br />
toughest budget in well over twenty years. Those are the sorts<br />
of catchphrases that sell newspapers, but to see the Budget in<br />
those terms is to miss the point. This Budget takes its place<br />
in the Government's ongoing strategy to remove the fundamental<br />
constraints on our economy. It rejects the illusion that there is<br />
a quick and easy way to economic prosperity.<br />
By firmly controlling government spending and the deficit, this<br />
budget paves the way for continued firm control over the monetary<br />
aggregates, further sustainable reductions in interest rates, and<br />
most importantly, further reductions in inflation.<br />
The Budget has involved difficult and unpopular decisions, but to<br />
have backed away from those decisions would have meant<br />
squandering our hard-won gains in reducing inflation and interest<br />
rates and progressing towards economic recovery.<br />
Let me turn now to some of the main features of the Budget measures,<br />
and the way in which they will contribute to achievement of our<br />
basic objectives. Measures in the Budget constitute an<br />
important step towards winding down the share of our national<br />
product that is pre-empted by the public sector.<br />
The projected increase in Commonwealth outlays 7.7 percentis<br />
the lowest in a decade. All government programmes have been<br />
scrutinised rigidly. Expenditures on social security, for instance,<br />
have shown the lowest rate of increase for about a decade.<br />
Nevertheless, the aged, the handicapped and the poor will not find<br />
this a harsh Budget. Economies have been made by directing<br />
resources in areas of greatest need. And despite the impression<br />
that one might get from press reports, expenditure on key programmes<br />
for the aged, handicapped, and children have recorded<br />
significant increases. .16 </p>
<p>Restraint in payments to the States is encouraging them to<br />
review their own programmes critically, in order to ensure that,<br />
like Commonwealth programmes, they represent good value for the<br />
taxpayer's dollar.<br />
A major feature of the Budget is the change in the health financing<br />
arrangements. We were not satisfied by.-the health care arrangements<br />
inherited from the Labor government. They provided no<br />
effective constraints either on cost escalation or usage.<br />
The changes we have made in this area over the past 2k years<br />
have produced significant economies and improvement, but we<br />
reached the v,; iew that those arrangements were capable of further<br />
simplification. The Budget changes provide basic, universal<br />
health cover for all Australian s, particularly directed to the<br />
coverage of major or " catastrophic" disability.<br />
The Government pays 40 percent of scheduled medical fees,<br />
and 100 percent after the patient has paid $ 20 of the bill.<br />
All Australians remain eligible for standard ward accommodation and<br />
treatment in public hospitals, without charge. Pensioners and<br />
socially disadvantaged people are fully protected by bulk billing<br />
arrangements. Under this approach, the individual decides whether to take out<br />
further insurance on top of the basic cover the government provides<br />
to cover the gap in medical costs, intermediate and private ward<br />
hospitalisation. Even after reducing the prospective growth in outlays to less than<br />
one-half that implied by the forward estimates, it was not<br />
possible to produce what we regarded as a responsible budget deficit<br />
for 1978-79 without taxation increases. A significant factor<br />
in this was that the government faced, for the first time in<br />
twenty years, a reduction in revenue in real terms.<br />
Previous governments have avoided this problem by leaving taxation<br />
scales unchanged in times of inflation. They were thus able to<br />
increase the real burden of taxation covertly, and without the<br />
need for openness with the Australian people.<br />
As part of its programme of taxation reform, my government put an<br />
end to this easy option. There can now be no increase in the<br />
taxation burden without a deliberate and public decision.<br />
Under our system of personal tax indexation the merits of which<br />
have been widely recognised both within Australia and abroad<br />
the yield from taxation is no longer boosted by the hidden toll<br />
of inflation. However, developments since the last budget have<br />
meant that we began this financial year with a revenue base<br />
which was lower than we thought it was going to be.<br />
These develo=-~ ents adversely affected taxation receipts in 1977-78,<br />
and resulted in a shortfall compared with Budget estimates of<br />
$ 977 milo. Two factors in particular accounted for<br />
$ 700 million of this: the higher individual tax refunds and<br />
the lower non-PAYE tax receipts. 7 </p>
<p>In 1977-78 there was also a decline in the profit share, whereas<br />
a recovery had been expected a year ago. This is affecting revenue<br />
in 1978-79. Had taxation revenue not been affected in these ways,<br />
we would not have needed the temporary tax surcharge a surcharge<br />
which by legislation expires in June 1979.<br />
But the Government was not prepared to mortgage Australia's future<br />
with the." soft option" of an excessively high borrowing requirement.<br />
It believed that adherence to our basic economic strategy called<br />
for a substantial reduction in the budget deficit from last<br />
year's outcome. The measures chosen are more equitable and<br />
responsible than the other alternatives we were faced with.<br />
The temporary increase of 1 cents in the dollar in the standard<br />
rate of income tax is an important element in that reduced deficit.<br />
Against what I have said, you will appreciate that this decision<br />
was not arrived at lightly, and the alternatives would have been<br />
far more inequitable, and would have been detrimental to economic<br />
activity and inflation.<br />
The temporary increase should also be seen in perspective.<br />
Even with that temporary increase, the growth in personal income<br />
t-ax collections in 1978-79 will be significantly less<br />
( 6.7 percent) than in 1977-78 ( 9.7 percent). In both years,<br />
tax collections will have risen more slowly than personal incomes,<br />
reversing the trend towards a rising tax burden which has persisted<br />
so long. It should also be remembered that this year $ 3 billion<br />
less is being collected in personal income tax than if the<br />
Labor Government's tax scales still applied, and that the temporary<br />
increase is being imposed under legislation which specifically<br />
provides for its termination on 1 July 1979.<br />
The immediate move to import parity for crude oil is an important<br />
revenue decision. But it is much more than that, it is a move<br />
that will have benefits for energy conservation and the adoption<br />
of more energy-efficient processes and technologies.<br />
This measure has brought forward, so far as consumers are concerned<br />
the effects of increases in crude oil prices that would have been<br />
inevitable over the next few years. The price to producers will<br />
continue to reflect the arrangements announced last year.<br />
The motorist will face a rise in petrol prices, but he will also<br />
see a large fall in car prices, resulting from the reduction in the<br />
rate of sales tax on passenger motor vehicles over $ 500 for a car<br />
with a retail price of $ 7000.<br />
This reduction from 27k percent to 15 percent will also reiaove<br />
the sales tax advantage enjoyed by commercial motor vehicles,<br />
some of which are directly competitive with passenger motor vehicles.<br />
The Government expects this measure to be of benefit to the<br />
automotive industry a major employer and to the *--any other<br />
industries which supply it with materials and components.<br />
It should facilitate the adjustment to smaller, more efficient cars<br />
as the price of petrol rises. / 8 </p>
<p>The revenue increases have enabled the Government to achieve<br />
a smaller deficit which will as markets are already showing<br />
provide essential confidence for private investment,<br />
and which will contribute to monetary growth in the range of<br />
6 to 8 percent during 1978-79, while interest rates keep coming down.<br />
At the same time, our economic policy is that adequate funds<br />
will be available for sustainable recovery in private sector<br />
activity and employment, while continuing to bear down steadily<br />
on inflation and inflationary expectations.<br />
We have taken special steps to make sure that our policy of<br />
monetary resF~ raint does not unduly restrict the supply of finance<br />
to certain key sectors such as housing. The Budget represents<br />
a continuation of our economic policy strategy, in which fiscal<br />
and monetary restraint is the cornerstone of the battle against<br />
inflation and the other major distortions in our economy<br />
presently inhibiting a return to full prosperity.<br />
The speed with which our strategy yields its rewards also depends<br />
on the decisions made by the Arbitration Commission.<br />
Preliminary figures for average weekly earnings for the June quarter<br />
1978 show an increase of 8.4 percent over the figure for the<br />
June quarter of the previous year. This increase exceeded the<br />
CPI increase of 7.9 percent.<br />
Wage restraint is vital in the struggle to defeat inflation.<br />
We regret that the Comrnisison has not paid the heed it might have<br />
to the views which the Government has put to it. We shall<br />
continue to press our views.<br />
We shall not accommodate wage increases by a passive monetary<br />
policy. It should not be assumed that there will always be<br />
finance available to accommodate excessive wage increases.<br />
The community must appreciate that the sharp increases in labour<br />
costs since 1973-74, relative to productivity have~ put many<br />
Australians outof work.<br />
A start has been made to reverse this trend. This progress must<br />
continue if the economy is to recover if we are to be a leading<br />
trading nation, and if employment is to grow.<br />
The overall short run challenge we face is to keep that strategy<br />
in place, so that in time sustained recovery can speed up,<br />
generating expansion of production, incomes and employment.<br />
The 1978-79 Budget meets that challenge. As 1978-79 unfolds<br />
we will, I believe, see the continued benefits of that strategy<br />
and the increasing community confidence in it.<br />
I want to conclude by commenting briefly on the call for stimulus<br />
raised by some commentators. When people talk of stimulus they<br />
usually have in mind increased government spending on government<br />
services, transfer payments and other programmes. We have firmly<br />
rejected that course for a stimulus, of this kind would be false and<br />
short-lived. / 9 </p>
<p>Our view is that the only way in which the community as a whole<br />
can be given a lasting stimulus is through lower inflation<br />
and lower interest rates, for it is in this way that we can encourage<br />
more home purchases, more business development and investment,<br />
which in turn will lead to strong and sustained growth.<br />
It is when a government adopts policies which bring about lower<br />
inflation and lower interest rates that domestic and overseas<br />
investors are encouraged. These investors know that Australia is<br />
one of those countries which is moving forward from its own inner<br />
strength, and not from the kind of stimulus attempted by a<br />
government which could not stand the pace. </p>
