CANBERRA<br />
STATEMENT BY A SPOKESMAN FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Malaysian Government has made no official protest to Australia and, according to<br />
the Malaysian Foreign Ministry, has taken no action to downgrade the relationship.<br />
Wc welcome thi and believe it is appropriate.<br />
In response to problems which have emerged in the bilateral relationship over recent<br />
days, the Australian Government has made official and high-level representations to the<br />
Malaysian Government through our High Commissioner in Kuala Lumupur and to the<br />
Malaysian High Commissioner in Canberra.<br />
We have underlinied the following points in those meetings:<br />
Ile Prime Minister values Australia's relationship with Malaysia and wants to build<br />
on it<br />
Thc Prime Minister accepts that on some issues Australia and Malaysia will not see<br />
eye-to-eye<br />
Both Governments need to avoid a situation in which the media is setting the tone<br />
of the relationship<br />
We hope that both Governments will act in a way which clearly draws a line under<br />
what has happened and avoid any further deterioration in the relationship or any<br />
slide into tit-for-tat retaliation<br />
The Prime Minister has also written a personal letter to Dr Mahathir i which he has<br />
made the following points:<br />
This issue has been blown out of proportion and it is not in the long term interests<br />
of either Australia or Malaysia for it to continue<br />
The Prime Minister's rcmarks in Seattle were not calculated to give offence to Dr<br />
Mahathir. Rather, they were made to make clear that it was a decision for<br />
Malaysia, and Dr Mahathir, if Malaysia wished to absent itself from the APEC<br />
meeting and that Australia had clear design interests in the architecture of APEC,<br />
interests which it would defend vigorously<br />
4b The Prime Minister considers that this issue can only be settled if both countries<br />
are willing to put it behind them PM PRESS OFFICE </p>
<p>02/ 12 ' 93 16: 48006 273 2923PM PRESS OFFICE<br />
If this was the case. the bilateral relaonship between Australia and Malaysia could<br />
flourish<br />
The Prime Minister believes the bilaeal relationship between Australia and Malaysia<br />
has substantial potential and wants to see it continue to dcvclop.<br />
