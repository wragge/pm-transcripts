6 PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 24 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
FIRST AUSTRALIAN-GREEK PRESIDENTIAL AWARDS<br />
I am delighted today to announce jointly with the Minister for<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations the recipients of the<br />
Conmmonwealth Government's first Auiitri2. ian-Greek Presidential<br />
Awards. The aim of the Awards is to foster the maintenance and development<br />
of Greek culture within Australia's multicultural society by<br />
assisting young Australians to wor: k or study in Greece in. tL-heir)<br />
own area of expertise. The Awards were set up in March 1982<br />
to honour the visit to Australia President Raraffanlis of Greece.<br />
Some 89 applications for the-Awards have been received from al.<br />
states and territories. They have been considered by a National.<br />
Selection Committee drawn' from the Greek community in<br />
Australia and Commonwealth Government departments.<br />
The National Selection Committee has been very favourably<br />
impressed by the standard of the applicants and by their<br />
willingness to contribute to Australia's development as a<br />
multicultural society.. After a selection process which included<br />
a personal interview of 22 of the applicants, the National<br />
Selection Committee-recommended 10 Awards, one of which<br />
is to be shared between 2 people. The Minister for Employment<br />
and Industrial Relations has endorsed the National Selection<br />
Committee's recommendations.<br />
Very promising programs of work E: Xid study in Greece have been<br />
developed by the successful applicants in the fields of<br />
education, cultural and community development and welfare,<br />
the professions and in artistic and creative pursuits..<br />
It is my hope that in future years more Australians of non-Greek<br />
background will apply.<br />
The awards offer excellent opportunities for young Australians<br />
to travel to Greece and gain experience and understanding of a<br />
culture which has contributed so much to Australia's development<br />
in recent years.<br />
