    <content><![CDATA[<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>Well Mr Koizumi highly values your decision.  You have said it could be an unpopular decision.  Why did you decide to send your troops to Iraq for the Japanese contingent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>For a number of reasons.  We believe the great turn out in the successful Iraqi election on the 30th of January has given the country a renewed hope of a democratic future and we want to contribute to that.  We also pay a very high regard to the relationship with Japan, providing a secure environment for the Japanese force to operate is a very important consideration. Japan is a close friend and a wonderful regional partner and the relationship between Japan and Australia is very important to my Government and the Australian people.  And the final reason is training.  Everybody is now saying that a greater emphasise on training is important because if we are ever to see the withdrawal of foreign forces from Iraq that can only happen if the Iraqis are properly trained to provide for their own security.</p>
<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>Do you set any cut-off point for the deployment in southern Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The initial deployment is for a period of 12 months and there will be two six-monthly rotations. I can't guarantee that it won't be longer, but the initial deployment is for a period of 12 months.</p>
<p>   NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>The treatment of Australian POWs during World War II by Japanese military is still alive among the Australian people, did you take (inaudible) feeling into consideration when you made your decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I did.  I am very mindful of the feelings of people in relation to those events and it's my responsibility as Prime Minister to always be sensitive to those feelings.  We are of course 60 years on and Australia and Japan are working together, Australia and Japan have a lot at stake in our own region, Australia and Japan are both strong Pacific democracies, we are two of the great Pacific democracies, and therefore taking everything into account, which Prime Ministers must do, I believe that we have got the right balance.</p>
<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>Why do you think it's important for Japanese to continue to remain in Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because Japan is doing wonderful positive humanitarian work, because Japan is a major economic power, Japan represents a major contribution from our region to Iraq, those are some of the factors that I think are important.</p>
<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>Japan can not contribute in the sense of weapons and things we only can contribute in a human terrain. Is it good for Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's very good that Japan is playing a more active role on the humanitarian side in theatres like Iraq.  And what we can do to provide the secure environment is very important.</p>
<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>Australia is sending 450-strong troops at a cost of $300million. Do you expect reciprocal contribution by Japanese Government or has the Japanese Government made (inaudible) commitment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We don't expect the Japanese Government to pay the costs. You don't ask other countries to pay the cost of your own deployment.  There is only one source of remuneration for Australian troops and that is from the Australian Government acting on behalf of the Australian people.</p>
<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>I didn't mean costs but any kind of contribution by the Japanese Government such as economically or free trade talks.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. There are no trade offs, nothing like that was discussed, Australia will continue, separate and apart from this decision, Australia will continue to negotiate with Japan on things of that kind.  But in no way did I say to the Japanese Government that if we do this will you do  something else, it's not like that.</p>
<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>It looks quite a risky decision because as we see TV opinion polls, those who oppose your decision are more than those in support?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I think it probably as a separate issue is not all that popular but there are a lot of people who understand why we are doing it and I believe that over a period of time, we can persuade the Australian public that it's the right thing to do.  I believe it's the right thing to do and the criticism of it has been very confused and contradictory so I am very optimistic that we can win the argument.</p>
<p> NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>Those people are worrying about Iraqi going into a civil war situation, is there any such possibility do you think?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well if people are worried about civil war in Iraq, they should support what we are doing because if you provide more stability in the country, you reduce the possibility of a civil war, I don't think there is such a possibility but if you are worried about it you should agree with us not criticise us.</p>
<p> NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>Australia has long been one of the significant economic partners for Japan and with Australia's commitment in southern Iraq this time, does this mean that the relationship between two countries will move up to a new level?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well it certainly is further evidence of the very close relationship between the two countries, there is no doubt about that but the reason we have done it I have outlined. They are major reasons and the relationship with Japan is an important part of it. We have a very close relationship. It is a very valuable relationship to Australia and it's a valuable relationship to Japan.  We are two great Pacific democracies and we have a lot in common and it is therefore appropriate that we take this position.</p>
<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>You got a call from Mr Koizumi and also Mr Blair. Who pushed you most to make this decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well they were both polite and we know each other well and they were keen but I am not going to start comparing the conversations, I know them both well, I respect both men.  I think Mr Koizumi is a good Prime Minister, I think he is doing a wonderful job for his country and we get on well and I look forward to seeing him in Japan in April.</p>
<p>NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>And the importance of an alliance between the United States is also a basic reason.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Our relationship with the United States is fundamental to our security, we've never denied that and we are unapologetic about the closeness we have to the United States but this particular decision has the explanations that I have given.</p>
<p> NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>What role do you expect Japan to play in the Asia-Pacific region in collaboration with Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I think Japan will continue in Iraq, will continue to do the work that it has done and I know that their commitment to maintain forces in Iraq until the end of the year and then it could be renewed and there is legislation allowing it to be renewed for another year after that. And that really in the end is a matter for Japan. But I know that Japan is anxious to keep the forces there and we therefore decided to provide the security.</p>
<p> NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>As long as Japanese troops are there are you going to provide security?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well we are going to initially provide it for a period of twelve months and then we will see where we are after that.</p>
<p> NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>What would you wish to convey to Japanese people from the Australian Prime Minister?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I'd send my good wishes and I'd say to the Japanese people that people in Australia value our relationship with Japan, we value the economic relationship, we value the people to people links, there are many thousands of Australians who learn Japanese as a foreign language in Australian schools and we are increasingly conscious of the great importance of the relationship.</p>
<p> NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>One year ago when Japanese press met the Prime Minister, you said Japan was the best customer, do you add any comment to that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I value and all Australians value what a wonderful economic partner Japan is to Australia and we are very conscious Japan is our best customer but we have democracy in common, Australia and Japan are two great Pacific democracies and that is a very valuable link.</p>
<p> NAKAMURA:</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
