TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP AT " KINGAROQ", LOCK, SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
3 OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What is the meaning of the Task Force Report?<br />
PM: Well, I think the Task Force Report is part of the new thinking of<br />
Australian agriculture. That is, how we build sustainability into<br />
Australian agriculture, where we are not simply using up the sort of<br />
natural endowments, and then running them down, but rather adding<br />
to them, and keeping them there. And we can do this, I think, on two<br />
main bases: one, that whole of farm planning, that's on the form<br />
planning itself, and planning within the farm districts. And this is<br />
where, I think, Landcare and the whole Landcare movement is<br />
coming through. As well as looking at sustainability of agricultural<br />
production on a regional district basis. So, some of this of course has<br />
come from the aftermath of the drought, and I think this is a good<br />
thing that perhaps the drought has reminded us that we have to move<br />
to sustainability.<br />
The other thing is that, of course, it keeps the farm family together,<br />
and I think this is extremely important for Australian agriculture, that<br />
the backbone of Australian agriculture remains intact, and that is the<br />
nurturing that the land is given by Australian farm families, and the<br />
maintenance of the family the economic viability of the family<br />
becomes important. Now, what's happened in the last 20 or 30 years<br />
Is that the terms of trade have shifted on farmers the things they<br />
used to sell 30 years ago were more valuable than the things they<br />
used to buy. This Is not the case any more, which means we have<br />
got to be more efficient the margins are slimmer, theref ore we have<br />
to use all of our assets in an optimal way-And I think the sort of<br />
discussion you have heard this morning in there indicates, I think, to<br />
you that farmers in districts are now thinking in these ways they<br />
know their own farms' vulnerabilities, they are going to try to repair<br />
them and make them better,. more sustainable and more productive, </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
and therefore a better bottom line, and therefore a stronger farm<br />
family, therefore the likelihood is that the children will keep the<br />
farming going, and that is good for rural Australia, and it's good for<br />
the economy.<br />
J. Now, is the Federal Government actually supporting the campaign<br />
financially further supporting it?<br />
PM. Well, I'm just about to announce again today here at Wudinna that we<br />
are going to be funding a further regional enterprise in farming. We<br />
are now doing this across the country in a number of places where<br />
we are seeking to, well, if you like, reconstruct the holdings, and to<br />
make them more efficient, and to see how people can adjust<br />
themselves either on properties or off properties. All with<br />
sustainability in mind, all with more farm efficiency in mind.<br />
J: Will you consider extending funding for the PMP campaign to the<br />
year 2000, as per one of the recommendations?<br />
PM. Well, we are very keen about keeping the momentum going of<br />
Property Management Planning, and now, I think, we have got it on<br />
the roll, we want to keep it there. So, I think that you will see from the<br />
Federal Government from this Labor Government a lot of interest<br />
in sustainability, a lot of interest in drought-proofing, a lot of interest<br />
in sensible planning of farms, and management of farms, and we are<br />
not going to let the opportunity go.<br />
J: So you can say at this stage that you will look at further funding?<br />
PM; I Well, I think we will be looking at further funding, yes.<br />
J: Do you think the Lock group here is a good example of what's been<br />
done so far, as far as land management is concerned?<br />
PM: Well, I thought it was a very encouraging conversation with the Lock<br />
group here today. You had one of the older farmers saying that he<br />
was thinking for the first time about new ways in which to farm the<br />
property new ways in which to configure the property, to not just see<br />
it out in simple blocks and attack it, regardless of the soil types and<br />
the vulnerability to erosion. Then you had another farmer say that a<br />
younger farmer saying that he was very excited by the prospects,<br />
and that, you know, a new vista had been opened up. And we need a<br />
bit of both, I think we need experience from a change in attitudes<br />
from experienced farmers, and that sense of excitement that I think is<br />
going to keep agriculture going. And I think there is nothing better -I<br />
mean, education does this to all of us in all fields, and I think thinking<br />
about going into one of these programs, and having the value of the<br />
conversation of other people in the same district to have tried other<br />
things in similar soils, and in similar circumstances, really means that<br />
you are starting to concentrate the knowledge, and getting up the<br />

learning curve awfully quickly, rather than doing it the hard way by<br />
yourself.<br />
J Your visit here to one of the most marginal Liberal seats has<br />
Inevitably sparked more claims of electioneering is that what you<br />
are doing today?<br />
PM: No. I have been in many parts of rural Australia all this year I have<br />
been recently in Roma in Queensland, in Winton, in Orange in NSW<br />
just over a week ago, in Rockhampton, well, all parts of Australia.<br />
Mainly to try and help with the drought by giving income support to<br />
farm families, but now it has broken in many places, learning the<br />
lessons and getting that sustainability going. So, that's what this is<br />
about, and what's happening here on the Eyre Peninsula I think is<br />
encouraging. And can I just say that we have held this electorate of<br />
Grey for over a decade we only narrowly lost it, and it is something<br />
that can come our way again, but this is not the first day of an<br />
election campaign, I can assure you of that.<br />
J On another matter, Prime Minister, the French nuclear testing do<br />
you support the South Pacific Forum's decision to suspend dialogue<br />
with the French?<br />
P M. Well, I was part of that at the South Pacific Forum. We made a<br />
decision that we would think about terminating the dialogue status<br />
with France were it to explode another device. Well, it's done that,<br />
and I certainly concur in the Pacific Forum making that decision<br />
today, and breaking that dialogue status off. This is, again, another<br />
selfish and I think thoughtless decision by France it wouldn't test<br />
this weapon in its metropolitan territory, it wants to test it in someone<br />
else's when the premium should be on nuclear non-proliferation. The<br />
big challenge is to stop the non-weapons states from getting into<br />
weapons, and for a democracy like France to be out there<br />
encouraging it is an affront to everybody who believes in the values<br />
and the thought process of democratic states. This is our principal<br />
objection to what the French are doing.<br />
J Why won't the government consider severing bi-lateral relations with<br />
France?<br />
PM: Well, one, to keep an influence on France, and I think we are starting<br />
to because we have maintained relations have an influence on<br />
French public opinion. So now that the great majority of French<br />
people want to see this program terminated, President Chirac's<br />
standing in his community on this decision has plummeted, and I<br />
think Australia's proselytising the things I have been able to do in Le<br />
Monde and some of the other, Liberation, and some of the other<br />
newspapers have made a difference, and I think this is the sort of<br />
influence that Australia can have. We can see the impact we have<br />
had on the chemical weapons treaty, the chemical weapons<br />

convention in the past where we are seeking now to get a resolution<br />
up to the United Nations the Foreign Minister is now there -* we are<br />
going to play an active role in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.<br />
So engagement is the answer, I think pressing on, indefatigably,<br />
and engaging on the issues.<br />
J: Just lastly, following your criticism and the fact that he hasn't<br />
released any policies he has given an indication that he will be<br />
coming out with policies before the election what is your response to<br />
that?<br />
P M. Well, Andrew Robb was telling us on the weekend television that they<br />
have their policies 98% prepared. Well, it that's the case, why are<br />
they hiding them from the Australian public? It's not me they're hiding<br />
them from I'm not the person who is going . who is casting the<br />
votes, I'm only casting 1 vote at the next election. But millions of<br />
votes are going to be cast by the Australian community why is John<br />
Howard hiding his policies, when his Federal Secretary his Federal<br />
Director says they are 98% prepared? What cynicism is prevailing<br />
that he will only pop them out at the fast minute, or if he gets a<br />
chance not pop them out, to sneak past the public without them<br />
being able to understand what he is really proposing? It's as I have<br />
always said, honesty and credibility in politics starts with policies, and<br />
if the Liberals have their policies prepared as Mr Robb now tells us<br />
they have why is John Howard being so slick and so sneaky in<br />
keeping them in the bottom drawer?<br />
