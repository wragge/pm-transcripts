Q, There has lboon a lot of cJsw3ir n the Administration. in<br />
recent days about ; eqeLi of ~ idtzade with Communist<br />
China. Thtere has a-I. o beon dci.. olpairticularly about<br />
sales by Australi. 9, Canada ,. nd Nco! j Z2ealand to Com-nunist China.<br />
Did -this ccme up in youar talks?<br />
A. No, it wasn't rais -d,<br />
Q, The point of view tlhet ias been expressed here is that this<br />
W ir giv4ng id and ccio'; to a potential enemy which Wishington<br />
is positive may ona coay go ' to war-r in Pacific. Whiat is<br />
your feeling?<br />
You wrant me now i; o miake a S, tement about the ganeral position<br />
in tb-c Pacific., of co,, u'_ se -wo hiavre danger-s in South-. East Asia,<br />
We have been dreadfull ly exoc_, csed ty some of TUhem already.<br />
But thi; s p.-ohlcm n. c. w of rd with t countries and<br />
what ought to be lIi: s o' h c. n'dti~ which you deal<br />
w it h. Idelli, this is a ol~ d one, 1 hiave nothing to i. dd to<br />
it. AsI syit h ist tee vith me here.<br />
Q. Would you characteiise yona2 meoeting w~ itha the President and<br />
oter officials as working sessions o-a means of gettin<br />
personal2ly a oqua-inted wit'-h t l-ii<br />
S A, Oh, much more in t-ha e 5cof( It entegory, Yes,, Oh, I had met the<br />
President Lefore, but cnly just in a muost formal way, and I<br />
wanted to get to know him in an indivi) dual sense-, and that I<br />
think succeeded very well.<br />
Q. It seems to me that the toasts that were exchanged yesterday<br />
at the luncheon, even reading them in the printed form, were<br />
unusually cordial and warm.<br />
A. Yes I think that that is quite true, 7 that wvas the feeling<br />
thai we both. had, Ohn, f-Lom. that point of view it was<br />
extremely useful. Then of course there were other people.<br />
Dean husk, of course, is by way of being a very old friend of<br />
mine now, and when we meet we just conduct a tour of the<br />
relevant portions of -the world and exchange our ideas, and if<br />
he has some more inforT. mation he gives it to me, But itts not a<br />
working session. Each these hias been purely private<br />
conversations. For a start when you are going -to add to the<br />
supply of paper in the Chancer-ies there is always somebody<br />
there writing it down. But tb. ere? s nobody there writing it<br />
down this time, So we h-aven't added to any of the files.<br />
Merely brought ourselves up to date. But that was the main<br />
purpose here, purely personal one,, Then I'm going through to<br />
Thndon too. It's a very good thaing to have some fresh<br />
individual picture of your own of the people here who are<br />
engaged in matters jointly -, vith the Uni-ted Kingdom and ourselves., </p>
<p>2<br />
Q. Sir, is the U. S. Administration satisfied with what Australia<br />
is doing in South East Asia?<br />
A. I believe so and everything that was said to me suggested that,<br />
and suggested it with a great deal of enthusiasm, I mean it<br />
was unsolicited and they were particularly pleased of course<br />
with what we have been able to do acmittedly not very much<br />
in South Vietnam because very naurally they sometimes feel<br />
that everything is being left to them and these little bits of<br />
assistance showing the flag in a practical way, accepting some<br />
of the risks in common this has had a very big effect. I found<br />
not a hint of complairt, and a good deal of satisfaction.<br />
There was a time not so long ago wilon if you listened to the<br />
unspoken words you could detect criticism about the size of our<br />
own defence effort in Australia. Nothing of that this time<br />
on the contrary, there has been very great satisfaction at<br />
what we have been doing.<br />
Q. Sir when you say that our co.. t. ribution there is not very great,<br />
is there any likelihood cf Jt being increased?<br />
A. Oh, there is no suggestion at present about tlhat No. It has<br />
only recently been stepped up, as you know,<br />
Q, Do you detect any change in th;; Amsrican line on Indonesia,<br />
a slightly firmer line Lhi before? It seemed to me that some<br />
time ago there was a rather ambivalent attitude towards<br />
Soekarno?<br />
Ao I think that that might f:-. r. ly have been said I was alert to<br />
any signs of that, but I cdidi't find t; hem. Mind you, I was<br />
dealing with the people like Mr, Rusk, Mro McNamara and so on,<br />
who have never been singelasrly ambiguous onl this mutter<br />
themselves, But I found i. n them and the President quite a<br />
clear-cut realistic view as to what was going on.<br />
Q. Did you find arything, Sir, to detract from the interpretation<br />
of the ANZUS TMreay applied the Malaysian area?<br />
A. Well, you remember, there having been some argument, I made a<br />
speech in the House on this matter, very carefully, and<br />
explained step by step wh.' t the position was. I enquired<br />
yesterday, I knew that they had had the full text of it and<br />
I just confirmed what I had previously been told by saying<br />
to them " May I take it that what I said received the complete<br />
agreement of your people", and th-io answer ' aJ " Yes." They<br />
regard that statement as accurate, and I suppose, in a sense,<br />
definitive. There it is. ( I was delighted to find that a<br />
tape recording typed back admits of errors even here in the<br />
city of efficiency, because I see that I am on the record as<br />
having said that Dean Rusk was " persorn gratissimo") ( Laughter)<br />
Q. Sir did you hear of Mr. Mikoyan's statement today in Djakarta<br />
pledging support to Indonesia against Malaysia and suggesting<br />
the possibility of Indonesia obtaining weapons more powerful<br />
than those the British would have in the area?<br />
A. Whose statement?<br />
Q, Mr. Mikoyan's,<br />
Ao No, No, I'm sorry. I have neither seen it nor heard it.<br />
Qo Sir, did the subject of the TFX concern you during your<br />
talks with Secretary McNamara? ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
A. No. Australia is taking a late delivery of these aircraft now.<br />
It is a year late.<br />
A. Yes. When these aircraft come in, they are always liable to<br />
have adjustments made to them, in the first twelve months<br />
particularly., le could take the first deliveries and make any<br />
adjustments ourselves that we wanted to make in tne light of<br />
experience, or by waiting for twelve months we could have the<br />
benefit of all the adjustment work that was done here the<br />
experience that would take place here, All our experts were<br />
unanimously of the opinion that it was worth the twelve months'<br />
difference in time to get the superior quality in the results<br />
and that was the unanimous view. There was no argument about<br />
it in Australia and I think it has been announced nasn't it,<br />
that that's what we are going to d-o It didnt affect the<br />
timetable otherwise the life of the Canberras and so on all<br />
that was adequately provid.-d for, they thought, even on -he<br />
year's late deliv'e.-y. In subs-ance it was a question of<br />
doing our experimenting, doing our adjustment well. In a small<br />
supply country like our own that's not as satisfactory as<br />
waiting for a year and getting the benefit of everything that<br />
occurs here. So that we'! have a slight delay but greater<br />
efficiency in the results.<br />
Q. Sir, did the questicn of Cyprus corie up at all in conversation<br />
with the President? Heis very much ex3jcised by it at the<br />
moment. I wondered if ha discussed it with you as a Commonwealth<br />
statesman about what was once a Commonwealth problem.<br />
A. No, no, no, I'm glad they didn't. I think that a few arguments<br />
are going on between other parties I know when to keep out<br />
of those a: rguments, If the time comes that the Commonwealth<br />
has to say or do something about it that's a different matter,<br />
But I've kept out of it here,<br />
Q. In the exchange of Toasts, Mr. Prime Minister, there was<br />
mention of the possibility of a Presidential visit to Australia.<br />
Did you extend any specific invitation to the President?<br />
A. Well, I told him that we would be delighted if he could come.<br />
And that if he did come, we: would be delighted to make every<br />
conceivable arrangement. In fact, I said that if the House<br />
were not sitting, I would convene it for the purpose of his<br />
visit, because I think it would be tremendously important.<br />
He can't put a date to it; he genuinely would like to come.<br />
I'm sure that he's contemplating the possibility in 1965, when<br />
he's got throughhi. s present discontent. But nothing like the<br />
fixation of a date, I told him that I thought the best<br />
season of the year to come to Australia on a quick visit was<br />
in our Autumn, or in other words, in the Spring here. But<br />
I wouldn't be holding him to a firm promise to come or any<br />
firm date but I'm sure that he would like to and I regard<br />
it as a strong possibility that he will,<br />
Q. How are you feeling, Sir Robert, if I may ask you? 9 a., o0 </p>
<p>A. Well, well, I havon't my normal supply of<br />
nervous energy. I'm flat, but apart from that Itm<br />
improving. I'm limiting my engagements as much as I.<br />
can because because as I said, I wasn't supposed<br />
to come for another ten days. I'm supposed to be<br />
convalescing,<br />
Q. Sir, can you reveal the name of the lovely lady that<br />
was alos mentioned in the toast yesterday?<br />
A. No, I can't. I can't. It's vary curious. I'm pretty<br />
certain I identified her. But perhaps on the sketchy<br />
information that the President gave me, I might have been<br />
wrong, It would be a little embarrassing to quote a name,<br />
and then have somebody rush along ond say, " The first<br />
I've ever heard of it", But; Ill check up on tnis, and if<br />
it turns out to be right, I'll let you know, but I won't<br />
take. the risk of embarrabsing anybody at this rtage. It's<br />
very amusing. </p>
