PRIMEUSTRMINIE TUESDAY, 29 JANUARY, 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO BUSINESSMEN'S LUNCHEON, LOS ANGELES<br />
Some of the things I want to say will not be new to you. But I<br />
would like to say at the outset that the increased international<br />
concerns that the United States, that we have, as a result of<br />
events in Afghanistan and elsewhere, demonstrate all the more<br />
the need for economic strength, because whatever the great<br />
democracies can do, their effectiveness depends upon their basic<br />
economic strength. That is obviously, and has always been, one<br />
of the underlying strengths of the United States. We hope, as we<br />
grow and develop our own capacities, that we can operate more<br />
effectively. We recognise the limits, quite obviously of 14 million<br />
people, but I believe it is more important to show willingness.<br />
It is important to play as much a role as we can.<br />
I am sometimes asked: " Why is Australia concerned in the larger<br />
international events?"' My answer to that is: " Well, we might<br />
be 14 million people, but if the scales on great issues were evenly<br />
balanced, and if we had sat back and left it all t ' o other people,<br />
then if the weight of 14 million people had tipped the scales<br />
in the right direction, we would never forgive ourselves for not<br />
having taken whatever action we could."<br />
Economic strength is ever more important, in the uncertain<br />
international times that confront us. Therefore, it is opportune<br />
to talk for a moment or two about the current economic climate<br />
in Australia, what we are doing and trying to do, and how that<br />
climate is enabling us to develop, as I believe responsibly, and<br />
to share with our world trading partners the possibilities that<br />
are opened up by the possession in Australia of large quantities<br />
of raw materials arnd in many cases abundant energy reserves.<br />
In the sort of world we face, we believe that these will come<br />
together in Australia, giving us many opportunities over the<br />
next decade.<br />
Many of you will know the background to the problem that we faced,<br />
starting about four years ago. There had been a certain loss of<br />
competitiveness in Australia. There was an inflation rate much<br />
higher than our major trading partners, and much higher than the<br />
OECD average. There was a loss of confidence. A number of<br />
overseas concerns took up their stakes and ceased their operations<br />
from Australia. There was weak domestic and international<br />
investment in the country, and exports were also threatened<br />
by high domestic costs.<br />
So this all had to be put right. Central to it all has been an<br />
unyielding attack on inflation which has not ceased and will not<br />
cease. No matter what the other policies might be, no matter what<br />
other things we might have to do, we cannot give up that attack<br />
on inflation, because we believe that it erodes the very heart of<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
an economy. It hurts too many people. It makes enterprise<br />
difficult. It erodes profits. It erodes everything that<br />
contributes to strength and the capacity of an economy to do<br />
the things that you need for your own people. So, over the<br />
four years, our monetary policies have all been designed to bear<br />
down on inflation, have all been designed to take their<br />
share of the weight.<br />
I do not believe that you can adequately fight inflation if you<br />
are lax in some elements of policy and put all the weight onto<br />
other elements. That will not work, I believe, over the longer<br />
term. Perhaps the hardest thing for government, and perhaps<br />
the most important in the fight against inflation, is adequate<br />
expenditure restrain. There are always people who go to<br />
governments and say " will you spend more money on roads or<br />
hospitals" , or a countless number of things. Governments just have<br />
to have the capacity to say no to those requests, because<br />
to meet them all would send the government, the country and<br />
every individual in it bankrupt.<br />
Obviously, we have sought also to lower taxes, to provide<br />
additional incentives for exploration and for investment. We<br />
have administered flexible guidelines for overseas investment<br />
which are designed to attract and encourage overseas investment,<br />
but to do so within a national framework that is broadly<br />
acceptable -to all Australians. That of course is good for<br />
Australia, but it is also good for those who invest, because<br />
it means their investment is secure and they do not have to<br />
worry about national reactions to it. I think we have beenlargely<br />
successful in that. As a result, overseas investment<br />
has very greatly increased.<br />
Investment guidelines have to be administered flexibly, because<br />
we would never be able to finance some major projects. our<br />
capital markets would run dry if it were not for funds from<br />
overseas. The North West Shelf offshore gas project will take not<br />
less than $ 4 billion to develop. Quite plainly, capital of that<br />
kind cannot be found frcmn Australia's capital markets. That<br />
just emphasises in fairly stark terms, the need for overseas<br />
partnership and involvement in Australian affairs.<br />
In the current position in Australia, inflation over the last year<br />
has run at about 10 per cent. That is too high, and much<br />
higher than we would like, but you all know that there have been<br />
problems with oil prices which have had to be accommodated.<br />
But, our inflation rate is less than the OECD average, which is<br />
11 per cent, or thereabouts. It is also less than the<br />
United States' rate over the same period. As a result of<br />
bringing our inflation down below a number of our major trading<br />
partners, and below the OECD average, clearly Australian enterprises<br />
are now more competitive than they have been for a long while.<br />
Manufacturing exports are increasing very greatly as a result.<br />
In addition of course, our rural industries are having a much<br />
better time, adding very greatly to the underlying strength<br />
of the Australian balance of payments and balance in trade.<br />
The current trade accounts are as strong as they have been for many,<br />
many years. I be: lieve that looks like persisting as far as we<br />
can reasonably see into the future. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Last year, private overseas investment in Australia was the<br />
highest for many, many years. The Australian economy has<br />
stood up pretty well, when you have in mind some of the<br />
problems that have occurred the high interest rates in the<br />
United States and in the United Kingdom. It has stood up<br />
because of the basic strength of our exports and also because<br />
inflation has been lower than in some other places. But quite<br />
plainly, international events do have their impact around the<br />
world, and they do have their impact in a country such as<br />
Australia. Money supply is on target for this year; something less than<br />
per cent, a little less. Having in mind the rates of<br />
inflation that are predicted, and the rate of growth in the<br />
economy that we hope for and expect, I think that seems a<br />
reasonable target.<br />
The Budget deficit, as a total deficit, is less than two per<br />
cent of our gross domestic product. That shows the degree of<br />
expenditure restraint there has been. The domestic deficit<br />
is considerably less than 1 per cent of the gross domestic<br />
product.. That is a better result, than most European countries<br />
have been able to achieve, at any rate. Gross domestic product<br />
is, as we believe, likely to rise by about 3 per cent through<br />
1979.<br />
There is always a battle on the wages front. There is always<br />
a battle on industrial relations. These are things that are<br />
never won entirely. You can win them for today, of for this<br />
week, but if you think you can vacate the field you will lose<br />
it next week, next month, next year. Pressure, I think, in<br />
any country has to be maintained in those particular aspects of<br />
domestic affairs. We have had a reasonable level of success.<br />
Employment has started to grow in Australia again, rising about<br />
2 per cent over last year.<br />
I give you those economic fac ' ts because I believe they do<br />
demonstrate that there is a basic strength in the Australian<br />
economy and that the future looks pretty secure, putting aside<br />
for a moment international events of other kinds.<br />
There is a strong sense of optimism in Australia. There are<br />
opportunities for the medium-term for investment and opportunities<br />
in Australia that might not have been there four or five years<br />
ago. Many of them would be resource-based. There is a<br />
possibility for mucy greater activity and greater partnership<br />
between Australians and people from other countries. Much of<br />
that I think is based on large reserves of raw materials, and<br />
of energy. We are one of the significant net exporters of<br />
energy in the free world. In all, we are 70 per cent selfsufficient.<br />
In that sense we are lucky, having in mind current<br />
oil problems. Like the United States, we do possess enormous<br />
Shale oil deposits. We are hoping that development of those<br />
deposits will be able to proceed before too long. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Uranium; a fifth of the Western world's reasonably recoverable<br />
pEserves. In coal; large deposits of high-grade coking and<br />
steaming coal. Together with the State Governments we have embarked<br />
on major development programmes which will make sure that Governments<br />
are not sh-ort in providing the basic infrastructure which is<br />
necessary to enable private investment, private enterprise, to go<br />
ahead and play their role in the development of these resources.<br />
We have, for example, a special examination going on at the moment<br />
with the State Governments about the pace of development of their<br />
electricity programmes, electricity based on coal, because there<br />
would be some pressure on supplies as a result of $ 4 billion<br />
investment in the aluminium and smelting industries very high.<br />
energy users. We want to make sure that there are no investment<br />
opportunities lost in Australia as a result of inadequate foresight<br />
on the part of State Governments, which are largely responsible<br />
for power generation.<br />
Steaming coal exports, in our examination, look like rising from<br />
1978, 6 billion tonnes, to 1990, maybe 50 million tonnes, to the<br />
year 2000, maybe 100 million tonnes. That obviously would take<br />
some handling, but it can be done. There are, again, examinations<br />
going on between ourselves and the States to make sure that we have<br />
the capacity and the basic infrastructure for that expansion to take<br />
place. I think Australia is embarked on the beginning of a new phase<br />
in her own national development. Resources projects, resource<br />
projects based on energy, are going ahead and in some -pervers -e way<br />
I suppose the energy problems, the oil-based energy problems, are<br />
throwing more opportunities Australia's way because of our possession<br />
of our coal and the capacity to provide, by world standards, cheap<br />
electricity for heavy power users.<br />
At the moment, there is $ 16 billion to $ 17 billion worth of mining<br />
and manufacturing investment on the line all ready to go. Compared<br />
to five or six years ago, that is a pretty substantial figure, which<br />
indicates, I believe, a growing sense of confidence in what is<br />
happening in Australia. In that, as I have already indicated,<br />
there is a very significant role for foreign capital.<br />
In a world that is greatly in need for raw materials, and in a world<br />
which. is greatly in need of energy, the possession of both. provides<br />
opportunities and responsibilities for Australia. We intend to<br />
grasp the opportunities. We intend also to meet our responsibilities,<br />
because we know that other countries need to have access to secure<br />
and reliable supplies of energy and raw materials. If other areas<br />
are somewhat unreliable in supply, Australia has been and will<br />
always be reliable in supply of these particular materials.<br />
If I could just end, gentlemen, at the point at which I began.<br />
The economic strength of countries such as the United States,<br />
which. is undoubted, and countries such as Australia, is all the<br />
more important in the light of the uncertain international political<br />
situation that has been developing over recent months. We want more<br />
diplomatic strength in the free world. If we are to have that<br />
greater diplomatic strength, greater economic strength will certainly<br />
assist in that. That means the figh~ t that we have all been waging<br />
over recent years against inflation has got to continue unabated.<br />
We cannot be diverted from it because if we are diverted, our capacity<br />
to meet other concerns, whether they are domestic ones or international<br />
ones, will be diminished from what otherwise they would be.<br />
