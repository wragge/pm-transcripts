    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Trish. To you and to my Cabinet and Parliamentary</p>
<p> colleagues and all the other representatives and leaders of the local</p>
<p> Adelaide community. We are here today as part of a long standing practice</p>
<p> of the Government and that is to ensure that when Parliament is not</p>
<p> sitting our Cabinet meets around Australia and that we don't</p>
<p> only meet in Canberra and occasionally in Sydney or Melbourne and</p>
<p> this is not the first Cabinet meeting of this Government in Adelaide</p>
<p> and it certainly won't be the last.</p>
<p>But today is a very special day for all of us. Today is the third</p>
<p> anniversary of the election of the Government I'm very proud</p>
<p> to lead on the second of March in 1996. You'll forgive me for</p>
<p> saying that I thought that was a pretty intelligent decision by the</p>
<p> Australian people and you'll forgive me for saying that I was</p>
<p> even more impressed with their intelligence two years and eight months</p>
<p> later, or seven months later, when they re-elected us on the third</p>
<p> of October.</p>
<p>But I haven't come here to give a political speech. I want to</p>
<p> say something about the strengths of Australia at the present time.</p>
<p> And I want to say something about the strengths of the social coalition</p>
<p> that is so important to our future and is represented here today.</p>
<p> Economics is not everything, but it's very important to the capacity</p>
<p> of a country to look after the less fortunate and also the capacity</p>
<p> of a country to project itself to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>You all know that the Asian economies over the last two years have</p>
<p> suffered the most fearful battering that they have experienced for</p>
<p> more than a generation. And you all know that they have watched tens</p>
<p> of millions of their people being thrust into absolute poverty and</p>
<p> they have watched the hard won gains of twenty years disappear very</p>
<p> rapidly. And through that turmoil Australia has been able to survive</p>
<p> economically a lot stronger than many of our critics suggested. And</p>
<p> we've even surpassed the best and most optimistic predictions</p>
<p> of our own.</p>
<p>And I'm very proud to say as Prime Minister that over the last</p>
<p> three years we have done things that have made Australia stronger.</p>
<p> We have been able to get inflation and interest rates down, we've</p>
<p> been able to pay our way and get rid of our debts as a nation, our</p>
<p> budget deficit. But at the same time we've also been able to</p>
<p> institute some very important reforms and we're in the middle</p>
<p> of trying to get another very important reform through the Parliament</p>
<p> which the Australian public voted for in October of last year.</p>
<p>Now I mention the strength of our economy not because I am not aware</p>
<p> of the fact that there are still many within our community without</p>
<p> a job, there are still too many in our community without a home, there</p>
<p> is too many people, particularly young people who are addicted to</p>
<p> drugs and there is still much unhappiness and much distress within</p>
<p> our community.</p>
<p>But I mention our strengths because it is important we never lose</p>
<p> sight of the need to think in positive terms about Australia's</p>
<p> future. We have a tendency in this country to accentuate negatives</p>
<p> and to denigrate achievement rather than to draw a certain amount</p>
<p> of pride in what Australia has been able to do. And as we move towards</p>
<p> the centenary of the foundation of the Australian nation, the Centenary</p>
<p> of Federation, more and more Australians are going to draw upon the</p>
<p> things that bind us together and draw upon the success and the achievements</p>
<p> of our nation.</p>
<p>But we must in the process of doing that understand and respect that</p>
<p> there are still many in our community who are vulnerable and who are</p>
<p> weak and need our understanding and our help. They need it in a practical</p>
<p> and a compassionate way. But they also need it in a way that gathers</p>
<p> in the rest of the Australian community. And one of the goals that</p>
<p> I've set the Government in its second term is to build in a more</p>
<p> effective way what I choose to call a social coalition within our</p>
<p> community. The Government is a coalition, it's a coalition between</p>
<p> two political parties. And a coalition is something where two organisations</p>
<p> join together to achieve a common objective. And the social coalition</p>
<p> that I seek to build more effectively in the Australian community,</p>
<p> is one that brings together the Government, it brings together the</p>
<p> energy and the zeal and the commitment of individuals. And it brings</p>
<p> together the private and the welfare sector of our community.</p>
<p>None of us can achieve it on our own. The Government is incapable</p>
<p> and inadequate to the task of solving every social problem on its</p>
<p> own. It has neither the expertise or all of the resources or all of</p>
<p> the understanding to do that. It is equally true to say that individuals</p>
<p> on their own, whilst they can solve most problems, indeed many problems,</p>
<p> and the great bulk of them are very self sufficient, adequate people,</p>
<p> able to live their lives and to care for themselves and their loved</p>
<p> ones very effectively even they from time to time need help. They</p>
<p> can't solve things on their own.</p>
<p>And the great welfare sector of our community, so magnificently represented</p>
<p> here today by so many organisations, which does a marvellous job,</p>
<p> it can't solve all of our social and human problems on its own.</p>
<p> And what you need in the community is an effective social coalition.</p>
<p> You need the Government doing its bit. You need individuals making</p>
<p> their contribution, being self sufficient, accepting responsibility,</p>
<p> accepting that it is now increasingly part and parcel of our community</p>
<p> that there is a mutual obligation. Society should look after the less</p>
<p> fortunate and equally those who are able to give something back in</p>
<p> return for that support should be asked in an appropriate way to do</p>
<p> something for that support. And we also, of course, need to enlist</p>
<p> the aid of the welfare sector with their particular understanding</p>
<p> of the human implications of deprivation and vulnerability in our</p>
<p> community.</p>
<p>And in so many areas the Government is endeavouring to do it. We have</p>
<p> had a lot of debate recently about the issue of drugs in our society.</p>
<p> Can I say to you the Government acting alone can't solve that</p>
<p> problem whether it's the Federal Government or the State government</p>
<p> or all of us working together. We need the particular understanding</p>
<p> of many of the organisations represented here today who deal first</p>
<p> hand with the human misery that is involved in drug taking. We need</p>
<p> the understanding and the cooperation of the medical profession. We</p>
<p> need the goodwill and the cooperation of our police and it's</p>
<p> important whenever we are thinking of community problems to acknowledge</p>
<p> the very difficult role of our law enforcement agencies. They are</p>
<p> too often denigrated by unthinking people who want police when they</p>
<p> need help but are only too ready to blame them when they don't</p>
<p> feel particularly vulnerable or to need assistance. And what we must</p>
<p> do increasingly within our community is to build a more effective</p>
<p> social Coalition because we live in an age and a society where none</p>
<p> of us operating alone can achieve the goals that we want for our community.</p>
<p>There is an acceptance in Australian society that in order to build</p>
<p> an effective and harmonious community we need a strong economy. We</p>
<p> need strong businesses and we need an economic climate where people</p>
<p> are encouraged to make money and are properly rewarded when they are</p>
<p> successful. We need low inflation, we need low interest rates and</p>
<p> we need a climate of risk taking and a climate of entrepreneurialship</p>
<p> within our society. Because it is that climate and it is the product</p>
<p> of that attitude that gives us the wherewithal to provide the programmes</p>
<p> to assist the less fortunate within our community.</p>
<p>But all of us have an obligation to each other. The Government has</p>
<p> responsibilities to those who elect us, we have responsibilities as</p>
<p> individual Australians to our neighbours and as community organisations</p>
<p> we have obligations to help the less fortunate within our community.</p>
<p> But my message to you today is very much that this gathering represents</p>
<p> the ideal of the social coalition that we seek to build for a more</p>
<p> effective, a more prosperous and a more harmonious and more humane</p>
<p> Australian community. It brings together men and women in business.</p>
<p> It brings the leaders of the great welfare organisation, it brings</p>
<p> local government, it brings your magnificent local Federal Member,</p>
<p> who I will come back to in a moment, and it also brings together individuals</p>
<p> who have made their mark in so many different ways within the community.</p>
<p>And I am delighted that all of my Cabinet colleagues are with me today</p>
<p> and can I pay a particular...make a particular mention of Alexander</p>
<p> Downer, one of the Cabinet Ministers from here in Adelaide who over</p>
<p> the last week in particular has done an absolutely magnificent job</p>
<p> as Australia's Foreign Minister in dealing with a very difficult</p>
<p> and a very important issue of East Timor. An issue that is going to</p>
<p> consume the attention and the resources and the time of the Government</p>
<p> very significantly over the next few months.</p>
<p>So I want to thank all of you for coming here today, for giving me</p>
<p> the opportunity of saying a few words about why we are here, what</p>
<p> we want for Australia over the next three years reflecting for a moment</p>
<p> on some of the Government's achievements over the past three</p>
<p> years and projecting forward to some of the things that we hope to</p>
<p> achieve over the next three years.</p>
<p>This has all been made possible because you do have an extremely hardworking</p>
<p> and effective local Member in Trish Worth. I don't think it's</p>
<p> a particularly controversial political statement for me to say that</p>
<p> Adelaide is not the easiest seat for either side of politics to hold.</p>
<p> But it is a marginal seat and Trish has done an absolutely fantastic</p>
<p> job in winning it on three occasions. And she campaigned magnificently</p>
<p> and gave a great source of pride and satisfaction to all of us on</p>
<p> the night and, indeed, the days following the last election in October</p>
<p> of last year. But she is a quintessential local Member who is in touch</p>
<p> with her community who knows them all, who understands what they are</p>
<p> concerned about, has an instinctive feel for human problems and somebody</p>
<p> who brings a quality of representation which I think impresses both</p>
<p> sides of politics.</p>
<p>And there are men and women in Parliament from all political shades</p>
<p> who demonstrate that great capacity and she is one of them. I congratulate</p>
<p> her for that, I thank her for organising today's luncheon and</p>
<p> can I say on behalf of all of my Cabinet colleagues who are here in</p>
<p> Adelaide today, thanks for having us and thank you all for the contribution</p>
<p> that you are making to building a better Australian community.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
