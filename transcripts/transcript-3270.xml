May 1974<br />
VIP AIRCRAFT<br />
ThuL Prhlio. Ministur, Mr E. G. WhiLlam said tonight:<br />
" Any suggestion that I commandeered Mr Snedden's VIP jet for<br />
my use this afternoon is totally false.<br />
" Throughout the campaign Mr Snedden and I have each used one<br />
of the two BAC 111 jets in the VIP Squadron. Mr Snedden hashad<br />
exactly the same facilities at his disposal as I have.<br />
" Last week the BAC III that I was using was temporarily<br />
unserviceable. My staff and I transferred to a smaller and<br />
slower aircraft. Mr Snedden continued to use a BAC III.<br />
" On Tuesday the Governor-General made use of the BAC III in<br />
which I flew to Melbourne on Monday. The aircraft required".<br />
servicing after the Governor-General's flight.<br />
" On the recommendation of the RAAF, the other BAC III was<br />
temporarily made available to me. Mr Snedden was provided<br />
with another, but equally fast VIP aircraft. This was the<br />
most efficient and convenient arrangement for the RAAF and<br />
for both Leaders. It took account of the transport requirements<br />
of both Parties.<br />
" Neither I nor any member of my staff gave any instructions<br />
or advice on this matter, The arrangements were made by<br />
the Department of Defence and the RAAF."<br />
