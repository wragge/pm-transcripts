    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No,. 3/ 1962 </strong></p>
<p>The Government has now issued a series of invitations to industry and commercial organisations to attend meetings in Canberra with Ministers. These invitations arise from the decision which I announced in December, to the effect that the Government would wish to have discussions with industry representatives, in order to obtain their views in a direct fashion on current economic matters and generally to set up closer contacts with industry in its various aspects.</p>
<p>The details of the invitations issued are as follows:</p>
<p>Associated Chambers of Manufactures to meet Ministers on 18th January at 2.30 P. M.</p>
<p>Associated Chambers of Commerce 19th January at 10.30 a, m.</p>
<p>Australian Council of Retailers 19th January at 2.30 pm..</p>
<p>Australian Council of Trade Unions 24th January 10. 30 am</p>
<p>National Farmers' Union of Australia 30thi January at 10.30 a m.</p>
<p>Australian Bankers' Association 30th January at 2.30 p. m.</p>
<p>Invitations have also been issued to the Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council and the Export Development Council, but dates for meetings with these bodies have not so far been proposed,</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />15 January, 1962.</p>
