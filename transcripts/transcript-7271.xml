FOR MEDIA 31 DECEMBER 1987<br />
Chris Hurford's retirement from the Parliament, which he<br />
announced earlier today, comes after eighteen years of<br />
distinguished service as the member for Adelaide.<br />
A chartered accountant prior to his election to the<br />
Parliament in 1969, Mr Hurford served in the then Labor<br />
Opposition's Shadow Ministry from 1976 to 1983. At various<br />
times over that period Mr Hurford was Labor's spokesperson<br />
on Treasury matters; industry and commerce; trade; consumer<br />
affairs; and education.<br />
Following the election of my Government in March 1983,<br />
Mr Hurford became minister for Housing and Construction. In<br />
addition, I -allocated to Mr Hurford the important role of<br />
minister Assisting the Treasurer.<br />
I appointed Mr Hurford to the Cabinet in December 1984 as<br />
Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He took over<br />
as Minister for Community Services in February of this year<br />
when Don Grimes retired.<br />
During his later Ministerial appointments, Mr Hurford also<br />
retained his role assisting the Treasurer.<br />
Following the election this year Mr Hurford decided not to<br />
seek re-* election to the Ministry.<br />
I wish to place on record my great appreciation of<br />
Chris Hurford's substantial contribution to the success of<br />
the Government.<br />
As a former senior minister with a strong background in<br />
economic and trade policy matters, I know Mr Hurford will<br />
continue to play a valuable role for Australia in his<br />
proposed appointment as Consul-General in New York. 003715 </p>
