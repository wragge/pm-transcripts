ekample of outr-willingness and our ability to aiddress the probleitE,<br />

Tire difficultdeB, and the sacrifices which have alway5 confronted<br />
thel intendincr homte buyer have intensified in the last few years,<br />
ifl large~ part: for reasons that are unqutestionably related to the<br />
brodereconomic challenges and problems that I mentioned<br />
Searlier, espe-cially the wage and price pressures that are being<br />
felt in Australia, and the hiqh interest rates that are being<br />
faced throug-. out the Industrialised wyorld. Although much<br />
ttention haa been focussed on the interest rate issue, rising<br />
hou-se prices particularly in Sydney -have played an imporLatt<br />
.0part. To put.-the point into perspective, for anyone who bought<br />
Cr: -e years aco the burden of mieeting their<br />
metree had eclnedsignificantly in-relation to their income<br />
the increases in interest rates that have subsequently<br />
-hoze who have bought. meore recently, and those noW seeking to<br />
buiy. a home, are being faced not only with hioher interes ratecs,<br />
but'also by substanti ally jinflated house prices which have led-_<br />
to increnaeing difficulties for people, especially those wi4th<br />
nde't* incomes, in i-ectingj deposit reguiierents, arid cre-ated<br />
Cnre-5incjly demanding repayr,, enit burdens, particularly in the<br />

tomaintain the flow of funds into housing loans, and this has<br />

Were identifi-: ed in the Government's reviewi of housing policy as<br />

bringing wage and price pressures under control, anid by getting<br />
'' nterest zatet; doyrn, that the difficulties faced by the hof:, I<br />
buyer can be cLelleverl in a lasting way, and the broad thrust<br />
