    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Wednesday, 28 January 1998</p>
<p>I want today to mark the beginning of a new year by not only taking</p>
<p> stock of our progress toward the goals we set for ourselves and the</p>
<p> nation when we were elected, but also to outline the government's</p>
<p> main goals for the coming year.</p>
<p>I intend that today's address will be the first in an annual</p>
<p> series in the run up to the Centenary of Federation in 2001 and beyond.</p>
<p>As we approach the Centenary of Federation, it is important to reflect</p>
<p> on our achievements and aspirations as a nation and, in particular,</p>
<p> as a government, on how public policies and programmes can be adjusted</p>
<p> and adapted to ensure that they remain effective and relevant to the</p>
<p> needs of Australia as we enter the new millennium.</p>
<p>The goals we have as a government for the year ahead are very clear.</p>
<p> They are designed to build an Australia which is both strong and fair.</p>
<p>This year the government is intent on accelerating the pace of economic</p>
<p> reform. We must consolidate recent gains in strengthening the economic</p>
<p> fundamentals. This will further cushion the Australian economy against</p>
<p> the fallout from difficulties in our region and sustain economic growth,</p>
<p> the key to further reducing unemployment.</p>
<p>The government will also unveil its proposals to reshape, modernise</p>
<p> and improve the fairness of the Australian taxation system so that</p>
<p> Australians can be guaranteed a world class taxation system as we</p>
<p> enter the 21st century.</p>
<p>We will continue and extend our partnership with the community in</p>
<p> addressing important social issues. Building on that approach, I will</p>
<p> announce in this speech a series of measures to broaden the application</p>
<p> of the principle of mutual obligation. They include further steps</p>
<p> to tackle the problem of youth unemployment.</p>
<p>This year the government will also amplify policies that impact on</p>
<p> rural and regional Australia to ensure that Australians living outside</p>
<p> the large capital cities share equally in our economic and social</p>
<p> progress.</p>
<p>And finally, the issues of native title and whether or not there should</p>
<p> be constitutional change regarding our head of state must be addressed.</p>
<p>Today I will be talking about concrete progress: first, our successes</p>
<p> in managing the economy, not least in the crucial task of fiscal consolidation;</p>
<p> and then some aspects of social policyparticularly those where</p>
<p> our actions most clearly express the stronger underlying themes of</p>
<p> our government. I will also be talking about the necessary connections</p>
<p> between economic and social policy, and putting the economics in their</p>
<p> proper perspective.</p>
<p>It is important that speeches laying out goals and principles address</p>
<p> the real condition of the nation and the citizen.</p>
<p>In that vein, the headland speeches I delivered before the election</p>
<p> of 1996 did not attempt to promise a utopian state of affairs. Instead,</p>
<p> they referred to continual processes which are as valid now as they</p>
<p> will be in twenty or fifty years from now.</p>
<p>The themes of those speeches, as of this one, relate to the ways people</p>
<p> live and work, the way they fit into families and into society, their</p>
<p> ability to pursue happiness.</p>
<p>Now that the Labor Partywith some help from Tony Blairhas</p>
<p> discovered community', I should perhaps add one important</p>
<p> point. Most of the habits and institutions which form and bind our</p>
<p> society are not created by government. They are created when government</p>
<p> allows people the right environment and enough of their own resources</p>
<p> to do it themselves.</p>
<p>The kind of society we want can only be realised through a shared</p>
<p> endeavour between individuals, the community and governments with</p>
<p> each playing their rightful role. Striking the right balance between</p>
<p> these three elements is the constant challenge of modern politics.</p>
<p>Our approachand it has a long history in the Liberal Party</p>
<p> is based on two very important understandings.</p>
<p>Firstthe obvious one, that politics should speak a language</p>
<p> that does relate to the way people live or want to live.</p>
<p>Secondthat our economic institutions depend entirely on the</p>
<p> condition of society. Without the habits of honesty, trust, self-reliance,</p>
<p> co-operation, civility, tolerance, obligation and reason, society</p>
<p> does not workand nor does the free economy. And without prosperity</p>
<p> and economic security, those habits are harder to secure. They always</p>
<p> reinforce each other.</p>
<p>These are intensely real considerations, often overlooked in the day-to-day</p>
<p> business of politics. They underlie the jargon of economic policy,</p>
<p> the jargon of GDP growth and budget balances. Economic policy is central,</p>
<p> but it is not an end in itself, only a means to an end.</p>
<p>There are, of course, those who wilfully choose to misunderstand and</p>
<p> misrepresent this government; those who trot out the overworked language</p>
<p> of economic rationalism' as if it were the highest form</p>
<p> of sophisticated criticism. I think of myself rather as an economic</p>
<p> realist: realistic about economic prudence and necessity, realistic</p>
<p> about economic reform, realistic about the limits of economics, realistic</p>
<p> about the proper ends of economic policy.</p>
<p>These ends are the considerations against which our achievements in</p>
<p> office should be measured. And they are very considerable achievements.</p>
<p>The economic record</p>
<p>In simple economic terms, we must take greatest pride, I think, in</p>
<p> our record of fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p>We inherited an underlying budget deficit of $10.3 billion for 199596;</p>
<p> with no policy change this would have blown out to more than $11 billion</p>
<p> in the following year. In 1998-99, as a result of our policies, we</p>
<p> expect an underlying surplus of about $2.5 billionhandsomely</p>
<p> exceeding our aim of balancing the budget in our first term.</p>
<p>This has not been achieved by raising taxesin fact, tax as a</p>
<p> proportion of GDP will remain essentially constant over the next few</p>
<p> years. It represents real restraint in spending: underlying outlaysstanding</p>
<p> at 27 per cent of GDP when we took officewill decline to around</p>
<p> 23 per cent in 200001, the lowest percentage of GDP since 197374.</p>
<p>And in that same period, Commonwealth general government debt will</p>
<p> be nearly halvedto around 10 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>The benefits of all this have been immensegreater, perhaps,</p>
<p> than we would have expected. As Alan Mitchell pointed out in last</p>
<p> week's Financial Review:</p>
<p>  The Howard Government's program of fiscal consolidation</p>
<p> has paid dividends in the form of lower interest rates. It has</p>
<p> largely insulated the Australian dollar and interest rates from</p>
<p> the financial market panic that has engulfed most of Asia'</p>
<p>I think this is the simplest and best example of means and ends in</p>
<p> economic policy. The benefits of lower interest ratesincreased</p>
<p> economic activity and employment, housing affordability, consumer</p>
<p> demandare all pretty obvious.</p>
<p>But even these benefits are surpassed now by the absence of crisis</p>
<p> and panic in Australia.</p>
<p>So far we have weathered the Asian storm remarkably well; and, while</p>
<p> the future is never certain, we should continue to do so. There are</p>
<p> already signs, indeed, that Australia will now become even more attractive</p>
<p> as a low-risk destination for investment in the Asian regionand</p>
<p> Australian investors will also be looking to take advantage of new</p>
<p> opportunities to invest in the region.</p>
<p>While we can sometimes take specific measures to help those affectedas</p>
<p> we have done recently to reassure those dependent on Korean marketsthe</p>
<p> best policy available to us is to reinforce the perceptions and the</p>
<p> reality of economic stability and responsibility which have now served</p>
<p> us so well.</p>
<p>I would add that the effects of creating a safe haven are not all</p>
<p> economic: they also provide us with a more secure frame of mind in</p>
<p> which we can pursue both economic and social priorities.</p>
<p>This insulating effect has, of course, been reinforced by our perspective</p>
<p> on foreign affairs. My government has sensibly broadened Australia's</p>
<p> international perspectives.</p>
<p>We have maintained the special focus on Asia, developed over many</p>
<p> years by past governments, but not at the expense of pursuing wider</p>
<p> interests. The emphasis, in a phrase, has been Asia first',</p>
<p> not Asia only'.</p>
<p>Our success in prudent fiscal management has been matched in other</p>
<p> areas.</p>
<p>The decline in interest rates has indeed been significant: official</p>
<p> rates have fallen by 2.5 per cent in the last eighteen months, and</p>
<p> business lending rates have fallen by the same margin. Variable home-loan</p>
<p> rates have fallen by around 3.8 per cent, to their lowest level since</p>
<p> the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Movement in interest rates has gone hand in hand with a welcome fall</p>
<p> in inflation.</p>
<p>For the year to the September quarter 1997, the headline CPI fell</p>
<p> by 0.3 per centthe lowest headline rate in 35 years. Through-the-year</p>
<p> underlying inflation has fallen to only 1.5 per cent, the lowest annual</p>
<p> rate since the series began in 1972. This rate is well below the bottom</p>
<p> end of the Reserve Bank's target range.</p>
<p>The concord between the government and the Reserve Bank in respect</p>
<p> of the Bank's independence, and of inflation targets, has restored</p>
<p> a good deal of credibility to monetary policy, and helped to diminish</p>
<p> inflationary expectations. Underlying inflation, indeed, is expected</p>
<p> to remain below the Reserve Bank's target range for the rest</p>
<p> of this financial year.</p>
<p>The performance, and the expectations, on both interest rates and</p>
<p> inflation are two of the factors which have at last started to unlock</p>
<p> domestic demand and increase domestic economic activity. Real business</p>
<p> investment, for instance, is at a record high level of around 14 per</p>
<p> cent of GDP.</p>
<p>Retail spending has been strong, and economic growth has accelerated.</p>
<p> Employment, always the last economic indicator to turn, is now growing</p>
<p> strongly, with around 140,000 jobs being created in the last four</p>
<p> months of 1997.</p>
<p>So while the Asian troubles will have some dampening effect on national</p>
<p> income, robust domestic demand will cushion the impact on overall</p>
<p> economic growth.</p>
<p>Economic growth is still expected to reach 3 per cent in 199798[still</p>
<p> o.k.?more like 3.5?].</p>
<p>One further factor here is the gains steadily accumulating as the</p>
<p> effects of our industrial relations reforms spread through the economy.</p>
<p> Even though these reforms have been operating less than a year, major</p>
<p> gains are already evident.</p>
<p>The Employment Advocate has already approved 4393 AWAs; and the National</p>
<p> Bank business survey found that one-third of businesses covered expect</p>
<p> to complete agreements during the coming year, with expected productivity</p>
<p> offsets averaging about 2.3 per cent.</p>
<p>In the wider industrial relations sphere, a better ethos seems to</p>
<p> be spreading. The number of industrial disputes in 1996 was the lowest</p>
<p> since 1940; and the number in 1997 is expected to be even lower.</p>
<p>Unfair dismissal claims have also fallen sharply - by around 50 per</p>
<p> cent - in 1997. And the total number of working days lost is expected</p>
<p> to be the lowest since 1959.</p>
<p>I cannot help addingso much for the dire predictions of industrial</p>
<p> chaos promoted by opponents of our legislation.</p>
<p>In two areas, I must add to the record what I think can be called</p>
<p> unalloyed triumphs.</p>
<p>The first is the sale of one-third of the government's holding</p>
<p> of Telstra which resulted in almost 1.9 million Australians becoming</p>
<p> shareholders in this great Australian company.</p>
<p>The second is the successful outcome of the Kyoto conference. Despite</p>
<p> a marked lack of support - despite, indeed, being labelled an international</p>
<p> pariah by some of our domestic critics - we held to the line, and</p>
<p> with persistent reasoned argument achieved an outcome very much in</p>
<p> Australia's best interests.</p>
<p>Sound economic management has so far put us in an enviable position.</p>
<p> But the events in Asia also mean that we have to accelerate the progress</p>
<p> of other economic reform. If the future is uncertain, if there are</p>
<p> further shocks in store that we cannot even guess at, then there is</p>
<p> all the more urgency to continue economic reform.</p>
<p>On the economic front, the government has two major priorities which</p>
<p> are both obvious and compelling. These priorities will carry us through</p>
<p> the remainder of our first term of government and well into our second.</p>
<p>One of those priorities is to maintain fiscal consolidation and continuing</p>
<p> micro economic reform including industrial relations.</p>
<p>Micro economic reform involves following through with existing initiatives</p>
<p> in major areas of infrastructure provision such as electricity, gas,</p>
<p> water, rail and telecommunications. It also involves the application</p>
<p> of the new industrial relations framework to improve productivity</p>
<p> and competitiveness in the waterfront and maritime industries, the</p>
<p> coal sector, meat processing, building and construction. These are</p>
<p> all areas which have in the past displayed intractable industrial</p>
<p> relations problems.</p>
<p>The government has already moved, through its shipping reform agenda,</p>
<p> to improve competitive conditions in the maritime sector. Those efforts</p>
<p> will continue in 1998. Internationally competitive maritime and waterfront</p>
<p> industries are essential to boosting Australia's trade performance</p>
<p> in the current economic environment in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>Some further evolutionary changes to our industrial relations legislation</p>
<p> have recently been foreshadowed. AnyThese changes we make will not</p>
<p> only heighten the flexibility and the productivity pay-off flowing</p>
<p> through from our first reforms; more importantly they will help us</p>
<p> in the task of reducing Australia's unemployment levels.</p>
<p>The arguments in favour of freeing up the labour market to help those</p>
<p> excluded from it have been conclusively won. Our task is to achieve</p>
<p> the necessary level of freedom without impairing our distinctively</p>
<p> compassionate Australian approach to helping the unemployed.</p>
<p>The second great priority is the formulation of a fairer and better</p>
<p> taxation system to put to the people of Australia before the next</p>
<p> election.</p>
<p>We do this in the full knowledge that past attemptsnot only</p>
<p> in 1993, but also in 1985have failed to get over the political</p>
<p> hurdles. But the reform of our taxation systemour taxation shamblescan</p>
<p> no longer be put to one side.</p>
<p>The ludicrous anomalies and complexities which pervade the entire</p>
<p> wholesale sales tax structure are now intolerable. The incidence of</p>
<p> our income tax on ordinary wage-earning individuals and families is</p>
<p> equally so.</p>
<p>There is nothing to be said for an indirect tax system under which</p>
<p> caviar is tax-free, but orange juice is taxed at 12 per cent; where</p>
<p> Lear jets are taxed at zero, and the family car at 22 per cent. It</p>
<p> is a system, moreover, which places particular burdens on exporters.</p>
<p>The income tax system has already reached the limit of fairness. In</p>
<p> 195455, the top marginal rate of tax cut in at 19 times average</p>
<p> earningsby 19992000, the top rate will cut in at 1.2 times</p>
<p> average earnings. The complexity of the system is such that over 70</p>
<p> per cent of Australian taxpayers now use tax agents.</p>
<p>Our principles in this area have already been made quite clear.</p>
<p>   * We will not contemplate reform which increases the overall tax</p>
<p> burden.</p>
<p>   * Reform should involve major reductions in personal income taxespecially</p>
<p> for families.</p>
<p>   * Consideration should be given to a broad-based indirect tax</p>
<p> to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes.</p>
<p>   * There should be appropriate compensation for those deserving</p>
<p> of special consideration.</p>
<p>   * We need to address reform of our Commonwealth-State financial</p>
<p> relations.</p>
<p>Those five principles remain paramount. And it is difficult to see</p>
<p> any alternative: is there anyone here today who believes that tax</p>
<p> is not in need of root-and-branch reform?</p>
<p>Sadly, in fact, the Opposition believes that a few more band-aids</p>
<p> will do the trick. At its conference last week, Labor talked of soaking</p>
<p> the rich a bit more, and perhaps some tax rebates for exporters. Neither</p>
<p> of these is really feasible. There are not quite enough rich people</p>
<p> to make the magic pudding effect work.</p>
<p>For example, a surcharge of 5 per cent on those earning more than</p>
<p> $100,000 a year would raise only $650 million, that is exactly half</p>
<p> of one per cent of current taxation revenue. That is hardly the wherewithal</p>
<p> to fund remediation of the current indirect taxation system or other</p>
<p> fundamental improvements. And only a broad-based indirect tax can</p>
<p> rebate tax paid on exports in an effective and internationally-acceptable</p>
<p> manner.</p>
<p>The record of the social agenda</p>
<p>I am proud of the economic outcomes which I have just outlined. Our</p>
<p> GDP and employment growth in 1998 and 1999 will be higher than in</p>
<p> any of the G7 countries, and better than the OECD average. Most importantly,</p>
<p> the economic growth and stability we have achieved enables us to get</p>
<p> closer to the kind of society we want.</p>
<p>We have acted in many ways to further that aim.</p>
<p>Before the election, we spoke of making Australia a safer community.</p>
<p> Our gun laws legislation was a very significant contribution to that.</p>
<p> But there are other measuresour initiatives on youth suicide,</p>
<p> for instance.</p>
<p>We spoke of creating a more civil society. That is a difficult objective</p>
<p> to achieve, but I think we have helped. The tone of politics is less</p>
<p> vitriolic, less abusive. The democratic right of dissent can be exercised</p>
<p> without instant vilification. There is, I hope, less domination of</p>
<p> debate by narrow interests.</p>
<p>We spoke of a stronger sense of community. And in a number of areas</p>
<p> we have been able to draw on the strengths of private and voluntary</p>
<p> organisations for important policiesthe government-business</p>
<p> alliance in the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence, for instance,</p>
<p> and the important role of non-government bodies in our National Illicit</p>
<p> Drugs Strategy. In March, I will be chairing a major round table of</p>
<p> business and community leaders aimed at developing strategies to promote</p>
<p> partnerships between businesses and community groups and corporate</p>
<p> philanthropy.</p>
<p>We spoke of a more united nation. Our aim of providing the citizens</p>
<p> of rural and regional Australia equitable access to normal services</p>
<p> is an important part of that. Here I should mention, for instance,</p>
<p> the $250 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund.</p>
<p> And there will be a significant regional component in the infrastructure</p>
<p> projects coming out of the $1 billion Federation Fund.</p>
<p>We spoke of a caring societyand, despite considerable fiscal</p>
<p> restraint, we have adhered faithfully to our promise to maintain the</p>
<p> welfare safety net, in all its essentials. The community would want</p>
<p> no less than that.</p>
<p>But that is not always enough.</p>
<p>There are problems which need more than the safety net.</p>
<p>Youth unemployment</p>
<p>Youth unemployment is still too high, and we maintain our commitment</p>
<p> to tackling it as seriously as it warrants.</p>
<p>I believe that we have the full support of the Australian people in</p>
<p> this. Australians feel a strong sense of obligation toward their young</p>
<p> people, an obligation not just to help, but to try to make sure that</p>
<p> those young people have the best possible future.</p>
<p>This sense of obligation is one of the habits which bind our community</p>
<p> together. But those who feel it know that obligation is a mutual affaira</p>
<p> two-way street. Every obligation has a corresponding responsibility,</p>
<p> and this mutual obligation has to be recognised as a basic principle.</p>
<p>Just as the community expects that every effort will be made to help</p>
<p> the young, and to provide them with opportunities, so it also expects</p>
<p> the young to use those opportunities. We have a right to expect that</p>
<p> they will make the best of the help offered and, as far as they can,</p>
<p> to give something back to the community.</p>
<p>Education and Training</p>
<p>We owe it to the young to get the fundamentals right. In particular,</p>
<p> the economic and educational settings need to be appropriate so that</p>
<p> there are, first, the jobs in place, and, second, the right skills</p>
<p> for those jobs.</p>
<p>While the Commonwealth's direct responsibility in schooling is</p>
<p> limited, we have nevertheless taken strong action to focus on the</p>
<p> educational fundamentals.</p>
<p>We have committed $669 million over four years to raise the standards</p>
<p> of literacy and numeracy in schools; and the Commonwealth and</p>
<p> the States have agreed to a National Literacy and Numeracy Plan, which</p>
<p> includes testing of all Year 3 and Year 5 students against national</p>
<p> benchmarks.</p>
<p>We have also committed $187 million over four years to implement school-to-work</p>
<p> programmes, including school-based apprenticeships.</p>
<p>The new Youth Allowance, to be introduced in July, will dramatically</p>
<p> simplify the income support system for the youngcutting out</p>
<p> the 13 different rates of pay and 5 different payments we inherited.</p>
<p> Most importantly, it will remove the skewed incentives whereby unemployment</p>
<p> could be preferable to further education.</p>
<p>We will simply give more assistance to those who are prepared to studywhether</p>
<p> at school, TAFE or university.</p>
<p>The transition from education to employment is one area where the</p>
<p> Commonwealth can act, and we have done so, decisively.</p>
<p>The introduction of the New Apprenticeships will deliver flexible,</p>
<p> responsive and accessible training arrangements for business, and</p>
<p> will open up opportunities for many young Australians, over a wide</p>
<p> range of industrial activities.</p>
<p>We have committed $560 million in incentives to employers, apprentices</p>
<p> and trainees, to support up to 220,000 places over the 199798</p>
<p> and 199899 financial years.</p>
<p>The new employment services market will start operating in</p>
<p> May this year, and will bring a much-needed focus on getting unemployed</p>
<p> people real jobsnot just churning them through endless training</p>
<p> programmes.</p>
<p>The creation of the new Centrelink agency has brought together</p>
<p> the social security network, parts of the CES network and student</p>
<p> assistance and childcare services, bringing simplicity and effectiveness</p>
<p> to a previously complex and time-consuming system.</p>
<p>Mutual Obligation, Work for the Dole</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, the principle of mutual obligation, of reciprocal</p>
<p> duties, is now established in our Work for the Dole scheme.</p>
<p>The scheme is already demonstrating the strong obligation felt by</p>
<p> the community to the young unemployed, and the value that the unemployed</p>
<p> feel in being able to give something back.</p>
<p>Well in excess of our expectations, more than 630 enterprising submissions</p>
<p> for Work for the Dole schemes were received from community and welfare</p>
<p> groups, and from local councils. Due to this enormous demand, we expanded</p>
<p> the original aim of 70 pilot projects to 179involving groups</p>
<p> such as Mission Australia, the ACT Cancer Society, Council on the</p>
<p> Ageing, Open Family Australia, the RSPCA, Centacare Catholic Family</p>
<p> Services and Anglicare Tasmania.</p>
<p>So far, around 1400 participants have started work, on 62 projects</p>
<p> around the country. They are involved in environmental improvement,</p>
<p> in preserving our heritage, or in providing direct help and support</p>
<p> to those who need it within the community.</p>
<p>We knew from the start that the participants would be a mix of voluntary</p>
<p> and compulsory. In fact, about 60 per cent of those participating</p>
<p> so far are volunteers.</p>
<p>And it is already clear that many of the rest have become positive</p>
<p> and willing participants in their scheme once they actually started</p>
<p> work.</p>
<p>For all of them, the scheme has one considerable additional benefit.</p>
<p> They will now be able to go to employers and demonstrate that they</p>
<p> have acquired some work habits. And the habits of workof regular</p>
<p> routines, of working with others, of performing as expectedare</p>
<p> in some ways even more important than technical or vocational skills.</p>
<p>As more young people begin to see these benefits, we expect to see</p>
<p> the number of volunteers increasing.</p>
<p>New initiatives</p>
<p>The government has decided on three new policy initiatives in this</p>
<p> area.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have decided not only to expand the Work for the</p>
<p> Dole scheme, but also to extend the mutual obligation principle so</p>
<p> that all young unemployed people aged 18 to 24 who have been on unemployment</p>
<p> benefits for six months or more will be required to participate in</p>
<p> an activity in addition to job search.</p>
<p>Secondly, and as part of the extended mutual obligation principle,</p>
<p> we are introducing a major new literacy and numeracy programme specifically</p>
<p> designed to assist those young people who have been unemployed for</p>
<p> six months or more and whose </p>
