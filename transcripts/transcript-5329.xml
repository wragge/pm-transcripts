SUNDAY 20 APRIL 1980<br />
THE MOSCOW OLYMPICS<br />
I welcome the announcement by the Australian Olympic Federation<br />
to defer a final decision on whether the Australian team should<br />
go to Moscow.<br />
The issues facing the AOF have been difficult for them and I<br />
appreciate the manner in which the Federation have gone about<br />
I am suZ? that the AF Executive will act with the highest<br />
responsiaility in the decision that now lies ahead.<br />
The G-o-:-ent asked tHe AOF not to send an Australian team to<br />
Ioscow hecase of the national interest.<br />
The Government has the responsibility for the security of every<br />
Australian. We have a clear obligation to stand with our allies and support<br />
them in a matter of such fundamental importance.<br />
My recent talks in Zimbabwe with leaders of other nations strongly<br />
reinforced my belief that there will be an effective boycott of<br />
the Moscow Olympics.<br />
Other Governments and other national Olympic Committees haye<br />
decided or will decide to support the boycott.<br />
Amongst Asian and Pacific nations in our part of the world<br />
thoro is general. support for a boycott of the Moscow Olympics.<br />
Australia has an obligation to be part of that boycott. I<br />
believe we will be.<br />
