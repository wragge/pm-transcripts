    <content><![CDATA[<p>Meeting yesterday at the Asia-Pacific Regional Conference in Perth, the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and His Excellency Dr Mari Bim Amude Alkatiri, the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, discussed the Australia-Timor-Leste bilateral partnership.</p>
<p>Maritime security remains a high priority for both countries.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alkatiri has agreed to Australia’s offer to provide Timor-Leste with two new Guardian-class Patrol Boats, packaged with long-term training, advisory, maintenance, infrastructure and other support.</p>
<p>The new Pacific Patrol Boats are currently under construction by Austal Ships Pty Ltd, with the keel for the first vessel laid on 31 July 2017.</p>
<p>These 39.5 metre, steel-hulled vessels will be delivered to 13 nations from late 2018 as part of Australia’s $2 billion commitment to regional maritime security through the Pacific Maritime Security Program.</p>
<p>Based on current build schedules, delivery of Timor-Leste’s vessels will occur in June and September 2023.</p>
<p>Once delivered, these vessels will help support Timor-Leste’s sovereign capability to patrol and secure its maritime borders.</p>
<p>The close relationship between Australia and Timor-Leste includes long-running defence and police capacity building programs as part of Australia’s broader support for Timor-Leste’s security and development.</p>
