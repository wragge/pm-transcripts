6 DECEMBER, 1978<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD TYNER OF THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE<br />
QUESTION: Mr Fraser, the firsy thing I wanted to ask you<br />
about is concerning Vietnamese' refugees. Australia is one of<br />
the few countries, and including the United States, that has<br />
been accepting some of these people. There is a United Nations<br />
Conference coming up, but given the historical ineffectiveness<br />
of such actions, what do you think is going to alleviate the<br />
situation? Where does the solution lie?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't see any short-term solution to the<br />
" problem. The refugee question obviously arises in part at<br />
least because of the internal policies of Vietnam.<br />
Unless there are some change in those policies, I think the refugee<br />
situation is likely to continue maybe at very high levels<br />
for a long while. I think that there ought to be a greater<br />
international effort. That is the view that Australia will be<br />
putting at this conference in Geneva. It is sometime in this<br />
area very hard to get countries that aren't either geographically<br />
close, or they believe other particular obligations, to take<br />
much notice of what is occurring. Adequate international effort<br />
is to always easy to achieve.<br />
QUESTTION:. Australia is geographically close, and although it<br />
has ta en some of these people, do you think Australia is going to<br />
come under greater pressure to take some more?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that is quite likely.<br />
QUESTION: How many do you think Australia would be willing to take?<br />
Could you put any figure on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think I want to put a figure on it,<br />
in relation to future events, the present and past record speaks<br />
for itself I think in relation to our own population we<br />
are taking as many, or not more, refugees from south-east Asia<br />
and Vietnam than many other countries. We would believe that<br />
the main burden of the problem should not rest on Malaysia, Singapore,<br />
Indonesia or Australia it is not just a south-east Asian<br />
problem, it is an international problem. The United Nations<br />
recognises that, but as you pointed out in your first question,<br />
there is sometimes the difference between recognition and action.<br />
I hope that at this conference the United States and Australia<br />
at least will be very much united in wanting to get greater and----<br />
more effective international action. I don't think at this<br />
point we should assume that that is not going to occur.<br />
QUESTION: Some people have been ma king a distinction between the<br />
type of refugee that is coming out, expressing a criticism in fact<br />
that some of them were able to pay gold. I think at times that a<br />
lot of people have a stereo-type version of what a refugee should.<br />
be he has to be poor, in rags. Do you think that this distinction<br />
should be made between the middle-class ethnic Chinese and the<br />
others? / 2 </p>
<p>PRIM~' E MINISTER: No, I don't really think it should. If you go<br />
Back to the days after the World War there were refugees from<br />
Eastern Europe of many different kinds and many different<br />
characteristics, and many different backgrounds many of them<br />
very highly educated, and highly articulate, and probably if<br />
they had any possessions leaving, or losing most, in the process<br />
of becoming refugees. Many, many tens of thousands of such people<br />
came to Australia, and they came here for one reason only it<br />
was a free country and one in which they thought they would be<br />
able to live out their lives, and bring up their children in<br />
freedom, a place where they could make their own and be recognised<br />
for what they could contribute. It has worked out that way.<br />
I think it makes no more sense to exclude people coining out of<br />
Vietnam now that it would do to exclude those people who are<br />
very genuine refugees from the last World War. Refugees can come<br />
in many different shapes and characteristics.<br />
RUSIN And the treatment that they receive at this end should<br />
be he same for all of them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think basically, yes. I think you could put<br />
this in parathenses, but the situation can be to some extent differentan<br />
exodus movement is being promoted by the government of the country.<br />
QUESTIN: But if the government feels that it can't live with<br />
thesepople that isn't very good.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it become much more complicated if a<br />
government is directly promoting an exodus.<br />
QUESTION: It does become more complicated, but still the people who<br />
are being sent out perhaps have, or feel that they don't have a<br />
future in that country.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have got no doubt that the policies are designed<br />
ach~ ieve just that, and that it also means that the government<br />
has decided that removal is a better policy than either assimilation<br />
or integration.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think it is wise, or possible, for western governments<br />
to try to convince the Vietnamese not to do this do you think it<br />
is really possible?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it might be very difficult, but again you<br />
ha-ve got a new element in the refugee movement governments are<br />
going to start saying, well, here's an unwanted minority, we are<br />
just going to push them out into the world and somebody can look<br />
after them the world might suddenly decide its time that<br />
accepted as a more general principle. It might well find it's got<br />
a world with a problem on its hands, the size and proportions out of<br />
any comprehension as a general comment, not just related to Vietnam.<br />
QUESTION: If we could switch over to another subject Australia has<br />
been lobbying very hard against proposals to change the US beef<br />
import quotas. Europe, the farmer and the graziers, as well as<br />
the politicians there is an understanding. Suppose you were an<br />
American farmer, someone who reads the Chicago Tribune, considering<br />
the present state of the livestock industry in the States do you<br />
think you would have any sympathy for the Australian position? / 3 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: In terms of trade, I think when people have got<br />
ftr wnimmeiate interests involved, they probably have<br />
sympathy for those interests. I was speaking with some people<br />
at lunch in Washington last June -there were a couple of Senators<br />
present who were not unaware of the problems of the cattle<br />
industry in the United States and it was my very clear impression<br />
that the prices then prevailing were regarded as reasonable,<br />
and if they continued that wasn't a great problem.<br />
You have asked a particular question and really it is a<br />
general one. Producers in any country whether they are<br />
manufacturers or farmers can feel uncomfortable if they get<br />
some competition. That is their reason, that is their argument<br />
to say that that competition should cease, or that governments<br />
should act arbitrarily to prevent that. I don't believe for<br />
one minute that Australian beef exports to the United States<br />
has really damaged United States farmers, has damaged the United<br />
States cattle industry. Imports are too small a part of the<br />
total market in the first place, and secondly the sort of<br />
beef we send to the United States doesn't really compete with<br />
American beef it is in many ways complementary to it, providing<br />
a need that the United States can't fill.. Thirdly, the problems<br />
in the beef industry in the United States over recent years<br />
have been attributed to drought as much as any thing else where<br />
the excess slaughtering may be up to 20 million, because your<br />
beef numbers are down about 20 million. When those kinds of<br />
problems occur I think it is quite wrong to take it out on<br />
another country, even on I am not unaware that we have<br />
a massive trade deficit with the United States, and we have that<br />
trade deficit, in part, because of arbitrary restrictions of the<br />
United States market I doubt if there are quantitative<br />
restrictions that affect any United States exports to Australia.<br />
I have been watching with great interests the arguments that<br />
the United States has drawn in relation to the trade relationship<br />
with Japan, because of the United States deficit position with Japan.<br />
In relation to our size, our deficit with the United States is<br />
just as great, if not greater, and having regard to the arbitrary<br />
restrictions that are sometimes placed on our exports to<br />
the United States not just in beef, but in other things<br />
I think the United States has given us some very good arguments<br />
to use against the United States in relation to the imbalance<br />
of trade between the United States and Australia.<br />
The United States knows all the arguments, they have just got to<br />
read their own arguments about Japan, and they will know the<br />
point of view that we can put.<br />
QUSIN Increasingly I think Australia is seen as a European<br />
island in an Asian sea. Relations with Britain which were once<br />
very strong have changed dramatically, and now a peculiar<br />
relationship with Japan, the United States ties are still close<br />
but American presence in Asia isn't what it was.<br />
Where does this lead Australia? Is there a place for Australian<br />
leadership, or do you reckon there will be a turning inward,<br />
a sort of isolationism?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In Australia?<br />
QUESTION: Yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't think we react that way. IIn faatct', </p>
<p>over the last two to three years there has been much more<br />
active foreign policy any dramatic headlines in relation<br />
to our own neighbours and in relation to a number of other<br />
countries around the world. You mentioned the relationship<br />
with Japan you said it was peculiar. I don't know that I would<br />
use that adjective. It is a relationship very much measured<br />
in mutual self-interest of both Japan and Australia.<br />
In many ways some of these are complementary. Both countries<br />
have taken very deliberate and active steps to try and extend<br />
the relationship between an economic-trade relationship, so<br />
there will be a better understanding between our two peoples.<br />
I think that is necessary because of the very great difference<br />
in our cultures and historic backgrounds.<br />
QUESSTION: But isn't it true that while Japan has been willing<br />
to take primary products from Australia, they have not invested<br />
in Australia as extensively as perhaps say the United States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Or not as extensively as the United Kingdomthe<br />
United States hasn't invested as extensively as Britain.<br />
We would like the broaden the sources of investment funds in<br />
Australia, but you have got to remember that we went through a<br />
period of mild aberration where investment from other countries<br />
wasn't really encouraged. The last couple of years has been in a<br />
period of slack trade, not much market growth and there is now,<br />
I believe, a good deal of renewed interest in investment in<br />
Australia, and I hope both from Europe and from Japan.<br />
I was going to go on to mention that in relation to ASEAN<br />
countries a number of quite specific measures have been undertaken<br />
to improve communications and consultation between ASEAN and<br />
Australia. They sometimes have one or two things to say about<br />
access into our markets, the plain fact remains that their<br />
exports have grown at somewhere between 30-40%~ a year, for the<br />
last seven or eight years that is a fairly rapid rate of growth<br />
and we have done a good deal to assist them into our markets.<br />
They have problems because the ASEAN countries are competing<br />
very often against each other they all want to export the same<br />
sort of things. They are also competing against countries like<br />
Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, that might have been more active<br />
earlier, and in the sort of goods that they do export to us, the<br />
non-ASEAN countries tend to export by far the greater part.<br />
The relationship is developing, and I think developing very well.<br />
In the Commonwealth, and also through the United Nations and<br />
other forums Australia has been taking a fairly active view in<br />
the Multi-lateral Trade Negotiations, and also in the North-South<br />
dialogue we have extended our field of relationships and because<br />
we are a commodity exporters and understand the problem of<br />
commodity trade we have taken, up to the moment anyway, a<br />
noticeably different view from that of the other B-Group countries<br />
in the dialogue of argument with the developing world.<br />
I think over the last year the B-Group countries have shifted<br />
their position quite substantially. We believe that the developing<br />
world has certainly got a point and there needs to be a response<br />
to it. In these ways I think we are far from drawing into our<br />
own shell Australia has been taking a reasonably active role.<br />
The meeting that Manley is calling in Jamaica at not a very<br />
happy time for me, because I have to leave here on Christmas Day<br />
between some developed countries and developing three or four<br />
years ago Australia would never have been asked to that sort of meetin </p>
<p>I think this is an example of changed attitudes, a change<br />
of acceptance.<br />
QUESTION: Your Government has had considerable success in<br />
cutting the inflation rate unemployment. Could you explain<br />
briefly how, what are you schemes of reducing the inflation rate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but there was an assumption in your<br />
question which a lot of people make and I have rejected<br />
we haven't overcome inflation at the price of high unemployment<br />
high unemployment camne into this country when inflation got<br />
high because our industries couldn't compete and they couldn't<br />
sell -lost shares on the domestic market and many industries<br />
withdrew from export markets. So, under these circumstances<br />
unemployment was bound to grow. When the basic relativities<br />
in the economy go wrong as they did, industries aren't able<br />
to compete. In a country with democratic institutions such as<br />
Australia it takes some time to get the relativities right.<br />
We have got an Office of Youth Affairs in this country and<br />
somebody from that Office the other day said that it is very simpleif<br />
you have got a commodity and you can't sell it all, you<br />
generally try to reduce the price of that commodity so you<br />
can sell it all. What is happening in the labour market is<br />
that even though you can't sell all the labour you have got,<br />
people try to sell it at a higher price, and that makes it very<br />
difficult to get back to a full employment situation.<br />
The point I am making here is that overcoming inflation is not<br />
at the expense of high unemployment the high unemployment<br />
was with us, and the damage hadn't really worked its way through<br />
fully by the time we started to overcome inflation. and fal1l<br />
back on inflation. There were still the damaging effects<br />
of the earlier inflation to work their way through the economy.<br />
Overcoming inflation there is no simple and quick description<br />
you have got to get all the arms of economic policy working<br />
to fight inflation, and that means there has got to be restraint<br />
in government expenditure that means cutting expenditure and<br />
that is difficult. It doesn't necessarily mean just cutting the<br />
rate of growth of expenditure it can mean in many areas<br />
cutting expenditure in real terms; it means having a monetary<br />
policy which is fairly tight, control over the growth of the<br />
money supply, and I think that is more important than many<br />
envisage if there is a too rapid growth in the money supply<br />
that can flow through at a later point as inflationary pressures.<br />
I think they are probably the main two elements of policy<br />
obviou~ ly related to it is policy on interest rates, policy on<br />
exchange rates. One of the manifestations of how all this<br />
works out is the size of the deficit, which has probably too<br />
much prominence in the public debate because I suppose pointing<br />
to the deficit is a short-term way of demonstrating how other<br />
policies are working or not working but restrain expenditure;<br />
keep control over the money supply; have appropriate settings<br />
for interest rates ( inaudible). / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
QUESTION: Do you think the United States should pursue a<br />
similar policy on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's not for me to tell the United States<br />
hiow to overcome inflation. I think the prescriptions for<br />
overcoming inflation are well known. Let me say that I am.<br />
delighted to see the policies that the President announced,<br />
the changes that were introduced. One of the things which is<br />
not always understood is that the value of the United States<br />
dollar is enormously important to a lot of countries. Maybe<br />
percent of our major export trade is written in U. S. dollars.<br />
The stability in the dollar is therefJore important to us.<br />
Up to 30 percent of our GDP is dependent on trade. In the<br />
United States I think it is 4 percent or 5 percent, maybe<br />
6 percent, but certainly much much less than ours. Many<br />
countries look to the value of the United States dollar<br />
and they look to the strength of the United States economy<br />
and recognize that as a very important element in the total<br />
financial system which can affect smaller economies very<br />
greatly. QUESTION: The Australian is loosely tied to the American<br />
dollar, is it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER : There is a basket of goods and then we<br />
have a management committee and a Reserve Bank and Treasury<br />
and my Department. I think we stick to the basket of goods<br />
which is a trade-weighted basket, but because of the<br />
( inaudible) of some of the currency fluctuations we have had<br />
to modify them on a ( inaudible) basis over the last 18 months.<br />
I think by and large the management of the exchange rate in<br />
Australia has gone well ( inaudible). It is very difficult<br />
when you get one trading partner, Japan, appreciating<br />
enormously. Another major trading partner, the United States,<br />
depreciating enormously. I really believe that in the trading<br />
world one of the things that would help promote, promote<br />
markets therefore create jobs is to get to a much greater degree<br />
of stability in the world trading system, a much greater<br />
stability in currencies than we have seen over recent years.<br />
QUESTION: Perhaps in future Australia's dollar will be tied<br />
more closely to the Yen than to the U. S. Dollar.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are no suggestions that the present<br />
management system that we have for the Australian dollar<br />
will be altered. It's flexible. It gives us room to move,<br />
to move if we have to. It needs to be closely watched because<br />
of the very great movements of other currencies, which you<br />
can't always predict. I think therefore we have established<br />
this system quite deliberately so you don't get stuck in a<br />
position and then you get embarrased because you have a<br />
fixed position with an automatic relationship either to the<br />
United States dollar or to the Yen or to any other currency.<br />
Because of the size of the movements you have an arrangement<br />
which gives you an automatic relationship you can well find<br />
your own currency moving in a way which might not be the<br />
best for your own economy. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
QUESTION: The dismissal of Mr. Whitlam seems to me to carry<br />
a very deep effect on a lot of things in Australia.<br />
I first came here in 1972. I found, coming back several<br />
times, a tremendous amount of cynicism that I didn't<br />
think was here when I first came. Do you think that<br />
Australia is going to get over this. Do you think it is a<br />
temporary thing or is it a maturing of Australian outlooks?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think there is too much cynicism but<br />
I think, and I agree, that those events are related to it.<br />
I think it is starting to fade. You are probably coming at<br />
a time when there is some contemporary re-assessment because<br />
of John Kerr's portrait, because of the statements that have<br />
been made by other people in relation to it. In one sense<br />
the event might be hard to understand in the United States<br />
because you have a different system of Government where<br />
people are elected for fixed terms. But in our system, or<br />
in the British system, the cause of the crisis was a very<br />
simple one. Here we have through some centuries of tradition,<br />
the simple intention that if the Government can't get a<br />
supply of money through Parliament in which to carry on the<br />
processes of Government, to be able to pay Public Servants.<br />
and to pay your defence forces and carry out all the various<br />
other functions of Government, then that Government resigns.<br />
It can suggest somebody else form a Government in the Parliament<br />
or it can recommend an election. The most likely course is<br />
to recommend an election. Mr. Whitlam took a very strange<br />
course. Even though he couldn't get supply through Parliament<br />
he said he was going to stay in Government regardless, but he<br />
couldn't pay anyone. If that sort of thing occurred in<br />
Britain ultimately Her majesty would have to act. It did<br />
occur in Australia and ultimately the Governor-General<br />
had to act. He had no option. It was caused by a Prime Minister<br />
who couldn't understand he couldn't stay in power if he<br />
ceased to have Parliamentary support.<br />
QUESTION: The result of this has been what I see as a very<br />
distinct polarisation..<br />
PRIME MINISTER I think it has been and I think it is<br />
unfortunate. It is continued I think by the repeated and<br />
continued attempts at self-justification by taking that<br />
original action. ( Inaudible). They even went to the extent<br />
of trying to get the banks to finance the affairs of<br />
Government. In the bank's ( inaudible) books, there is no<br />
legislative or constitutional ( inaudible) to say now come<br />
and pay the Government's bills'. This was all happening<br />
in the last f ew weeks. But that is an aberration not part<br />
of Australia and I hope the people of the United States knew,<br />
and understand, that it is an aberration not to be repeated.<br />
QUESTION: It's very complicated I think though. American<br />
people, as you said ' before, have different systems but still<br />
understand what happened.<br />
PRIME MINISTER No, I think that's probably right. In Canada<br />
there would be better understanding because they've got the<br />
same system. In one sense the practical impact would be the<br />
same as if you had a President in power and the Congress<br />
refused to give him any money for' any activities of Government. </p>
<p>8<br />
QUESTION: That happens from time to time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but Presidents seem to get their money<br />
through ultimately, or people seem to go on getting paid<br />
while there is a dispute about budget bills. But if you<br />
had a situation in which Congress had no money whatsoever<br />
for any programs, for your payments of salaries, you've got<br />
to have some way of breaking that sort of deadlock. In our<br />
system a way of breaking it is the thoroughly democratic<br />
procedure of allowing people to have a vote.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Whitlam could have called an election then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He could have. He wasn't prepared to.<br />
He was prepared to call a Senate election but a Senate election<br />
wouldn't have affected it because you would have had half<br />
the Senate only being elected. They wouldn't have taken their<br />
seats for another six months and that could not have resolved<br />
the problem. The only way to resolve the problem was to have<br />
a total election,.. which he was determined not to have.<br />
