    <content><![CDATA[<p>OMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />SPEECH<br />The Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />M. P.,<br />ON THlE<br />PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES BILL<br />1964 AND ASSOCIATED BILLS.<br />[ Front the Parliamentary Debates," 28th October, 1964.]<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />Prime Minister) [ 3.221.-I move-<br />That the Bills be now read a second time.<br />Honorable members may recall that when,<br />in April 1959, 1 introduced legislation dealing<br />with Ministers of State, parliamentary<br />allowances and parliamentary retiring<br />allowances, I indicated the Governent's<br />view that these matters should be dealt<br />with every three years at the beginning of<br />each Parliament. What I said was-<br />The proposal to which effect is now being given<br />is a proposal that the salary and allowances of<br />members of this Parliament should be dealt with<br />every three years, at the beginning of each Parliament,<br />and that the decision should endure, except<br />for some quite phenomenal or catastrophic circumstances,<br />for the whole of the period of three years.<br />These, of course, are matters for Parliament<br />since, under section 48 of -the Constitution<br />of the Commonwealth, alterations in the<br />emoluments of members of the Parliament<br />must be made by Parliament itself.<br />The Government did not, in the event,<br />bring down any proposals at -the beginning<br />of the 24th Parliament-that is, the early<br />part of 1962-or at any time in the life of<br />that Parliament. It is now, therefore, more<br />than five years since the last review. Having<br />14043/ 64. regard to the great changes which have<br />occurred during this period in the r~ ates of<br />earning outside Parliament, and the increasing<br />pressure of parliamentary business, the<br />Government has decided ithat a review of<br />emoluments should not be further delayed,<br />but should be made now in respect of the<br />25th Parliament and to take effect from<br />1st November 1964. As regards parliamentary<br />retiring allowances, I shall say<br />something in detail a little later on. At<br />present I limit myself to the observation<br />that steps to amend the benefits upwards<br />are due, and in reality overdue. The increased<br />pension benefits proposed will, as<br />I will indicate later, require increased contributions<br />on the part of members.<br />In relation to increases in salaries and<br />allowances, the Government is again convinced<br />that the adjustments proposed are<br />due, and even overdue. Circumstances are,<br />of course, never really propitious for dealing<br />with parliamentary salaries and allowances.<br />Certainly some people are always found to<br />say, " Now is not the time". No doubt<br />on this occasion, as in the past, that will<br />be said. But to understand the Government's<br />decision it is only necessary to understand<br />the facts pertaining to salary incomes.<br />Recently the Leader of the Opposition ( MT.</p>
<p>Calwell) asked me if I would make available<br />to the House certain information and<br />comparisons in the parliamentary pension<br />and salary field and in certain related areas<br />of salary, for instance in the Public Service.<br />I agreed, as I said at the time, with the<br />implication of the honorable member's request;<br />that is, that a first requirement in this<br />matter is to have and to study the facts.<br />The Leader of the Opposition added-<br />Most imporiantly, will his Government take suitable<br />action to adjust parliamentary and electorate<br />allowances in such appropriate fashion and at such<br />time as it deems desirable in the light of movements<br />in the directions that I have just instanced?<br />As honorable members know, material,<br />in response to the honorable member's<br />request, has been tabled by my colleague,<br />the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr. McEwen),<br />on my behalf. This material shows what<br />I may call a cycle of increases in salary'<br />incomes since the 1959 adjustment of Parliamentary<br />salaries and allowances. The<br />salaries and allowances of members of State<br />Parliaments, which were increased following<br />the Commonwealth adjustment of<br />March 1959 have, with the exception of<br />Victoria, been increased again by substantial<br />amounts in 1963 or 1964.<br />A very significant comparison may be<br />made with the position of members of the<br />Assembly in the State Parliament of New<br />South Wales. Their salary is œ 2,650. Members<br />of the National Parliament, a parliament<br />which has to deal with the greatest<br />national and international problems and<br />with a vast complex of social, economic<br />and financial responsibilities, now receive<br />œ 2,750. The State electorate allowances<br />range from œ 650 to œ 1,050, the Commonwealth<br />from œ 850 to œ 1,050. Clearly, this<br />state of affairs ought not to continue, and<br />only this Parliament can change it.<br />Both this year and last year there have<br />been large increases in Public Service<br />salaries-in the professional grades and the<br />administrative grades and, I may add,<br />largely as a result of arbitration. As I shall<br />be indicating a little later, when I come to a<br />subsequent -bill, there are now to be, on the<br />decision of the Government, necessary<br />adjustments in the salaries in the First<br />Division of the Public Service, that is<br />to say in the salaries of the Permanent<br />Ieads of Departments and also of statutory<br />officers and related officers. I shall come to<br />that matter later when moving the second reading of a subsequent bill, but I just<br />interpose on my own remarks at this stage<br />to say that, as a result of all these changes<br />that have been made through aribitral processes,<br />there are officers in the Second<br />Division of the Public Service who are now<br />being paid more than the Permanent Heads<br />who are in the second grade of Permanent<br />Heads. This, of course, is a state of affairs<br />that really nobody could allow -to continue<br />if we are to have an orderly and properly<br />organised Public Service.<br />The Government has necessarily had<br />regard to all these developments and I<br />believe that thoughtful and reasonable<br />people will, on the evidence, be ready to<br />accept that increases are now justified. We<br />have considered whether, even though the<br />salary adjustments are more than due, we<br />ought ' to defer them still longer. We have<br />concluded that we should not. In the first<br />place, we are firm in our view that the<br />adjustments are warranted. In the second<br />place, they are adjustments which come at<br />the end of a cycle of adjustments and not<br />at the beginning.<br />Sir, as politicians-and we must all plead<br />guilty to being politicians-we are well<br />aware of the facts that increases in the<br />provision for Federal members are always<br />attacked-this seems to be something from<br />which State members have a certificate of<br />exemption-and that a Sena'te election is<br />in front of us.<br />Nevertheless, we are convinced that<br />' honest dealing with the electors requires that<br />they should know right away what our proposals<br />are; we believe that they will<br />appreciate the propriety of this course, and<br />that on proper consideration they will see<br />the fairness of the changes that are being<br />made. On some previous occasions a review<br />has been approached by first having an<br />independent committee inquire and report<br />to the Government. We had the Nicholas<br />Committee in 1951. In 1955 and 1959, we<br />had a committee of inquiry under the<br />chairmanship of Sir Frank Richardson.<br />This, however, has not been an invariable<br />practice. On other occasions, the Government<br />of the day itself has brought proposals<br />to Parliament without recourse to such a<br />committee, and we have decided to do that<br />on this occasion. We decided against a</p>
<p>committee because what we are now proposing<br />to the House is essentially an<br />upgrading of the amounts applying under<br />the existing arrangements for salaries,<br />allowances and retiring allowances. It is not<br />a review of the structure of the arrangements<br />or of other parliamentary privileges.<br />Honorable members will see that the<br />salary of members and senators is to<br />increase by œ 750 per annum to œ 3,500 per<br />annum. As there are misapprehensions inI<br />some quarters, I would like to make it clear<br />that members' salaries, like ministerial<br />salaries, are -taxable at the normal rates.<br />Thus, the increase of œ 750 is subject to<br />income tax-say, œ 280 in an average case,<br />and this is a modest figure-and to an<br />increased retiring allowance contribution-<br />œ 143-a matter that I shall refer to later.<br />This means that the net current cash gain,<br />if I may so describe it, to the member is<br />œ 327 per annum.<br />The supplementary salaries of Ministers<br />and other office bearers have been increased<br />broadly in parallel with this basic increase.<br />In the case of senior Ministers and the<br />Leader of the Opposition the increases<br />range from œ 1,000 per annum to 1,250<br />per annum; in the case of junior Ministers,<br />the increase is œ 750 per annum. In general,<br />the increases represent of the order of<br />per cent, of the 1959 level-a little more<br />in some eases, a little less in others. The electorate allowances have been<br />increased, by no means extravagantly, by<br />œ 250 per annum, while special allowances<br />have been increased by amounts varying<br />for different offices-from 100 per annum<br />in the case of Whips, to L2504œ 300 per<br />annum in the case of Ministers and the<br />Leader of the Opposition in the House, and<br />œ 500 per annum in the case of the Prime<br />Minister. Electorate allowances are, of<br />course, granted to cover expenses incurred<br />by members and their wives in discharging<br />their public responsibilities. These costs have<br />increased significantly since 1959. The same<br />can be said of the costs of discharging the<br />duties of various parliamentary offices.<br />These expenses, which private citizens do<br />not normally encounter, are ones which, in<br />turn the special allowances are designed<br />to cover.<br />It is proposed, although this will be done<br />administratively, to increase travelling<br />allowances for senior Ministers and the<br />Leader of the Opposition by œ 3 per day<br />and for junior Ministers and members by<br />2 per day. As I do not want to take up<br />time by reading through a mass of figures,<br />with the concurrence of honorable members<br />I incorporate in " Hansard " a statement<br />setting out in detail the proposed<br />changes in salaries and allowances. Copies<br />of the statement are available to honorable<br />members and the Press.<br />THE COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENT<br />SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES<br />SUMMARY OF PROPOSED CHANGES<br />1.

Obviously, the adjustments<br />must have regard to adjustments<br />which have already been made in other<br />incomes. Incidentally, average earnings in<br />Australia have risen 35 per cent, since early<br />1959. The adjustments must have regard to<br />trends in expenses incurred by members and<br />office bearers. We have considered the facts<br />on both these points and the proposals now<br />before the Housc have been devised having<br />regard to the facts. We believe that the<br />basis arrived at is justified by the facts and<br />is one which will serve to sustain the quality<br />and prestige of the National Parliament.<br />I turn now to members' retiring allowances,<br />the amounts of which are no longer<br />appropriate to the increased parliamentary<br />salaries. In considering the standard of<br />benefits, we concluded that members should<br />be entitled to contribute for a basic pension<br />which, in ordinary circumstances, would be<br />per cent, of the salary they were receiving<br />on retirement. The 1959 legislation<br />resulted in 30 per cent. of the cost of pensions<br />being met from members' contributions<br />to the Fund. I want to emphasise that,<br />because I think it is little understood around<br />Australia that this is a contributor'y pensions<br />scheme. We have preserved this basis of<br />financing in adopting the scale of contributions<br />which the Commonwealth Actuary has<br />calculated for the benefits set out in the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Bill. The<br />contribution henceforth will be III per<br />cent. of salary, or, as I indicated a little<br />earlier, œ 7 14s. 10d. per week on the proposed<br />salary. The scheme has now been in<br />force since 1948 -and, in the course of our<br />review of the Fund, the Actuary reported<br />that at 26th March 1963 there was a substantial<br />surplus in the Fund, which then<br />amounted to œ 77,000, and which now would<br />undoubtedly exceed œ 100,000. This surplus,<br />which has -been built up entirely from the<br />contributions of members, has enabled us<br />to review the rates of pension now being<br />paid. There are many who were once well<br />known in this Parliament and who are now<br />receiving pensions at the rates prevailing<br />prior to the 1959 legislation. We have decided<br />to raise these pensions to the rates<br />that were adopted in 1959 and, as a result<br />of the surplus in the Fund, 30 per cent. of<br />the cost of these pensions will be met from<br />the Fund. Those who have retired since the<br />1959 legislation will receive either a lump<br />sum payment from the surplus or an<br />increased pension related to 50 per cent. of<br />the parliamentary salaries hitherto in force.<br />These pensions will also be financed on the<br />basis of 30 per cent, from the Fund.<br />Finally, as I said in my speech in 1959,<br />we have examined the possibility of a contributory<br />scheme to give very much modified<br />effect to the recommendations of the<br />Richardson Committee for a supplementary</p>
<p>scheme for Ministers and certain other<br />office bearers. The scheme now to be introduced,<br />based upon actuarial advice, provides<br />for a basic contribution rate of œ 4 5s.<br />per week and pensions varying with service<br />from a minimum of eight years to a maximum<br />of fourteen years. That will be service<br />as a Minister or as Leader of the Opposition<br />or whatever the office may be. Mr. Calwell.-Eight years of service in<br />the position will be necessary before one<br />can qualify.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-That is right.<br />The contribution rates have also been calculated<br />on a basis to ensure that 30 per cent.<br />of the pensions will be met from the Fund.<br />I commend these three Bills to the House.<br />BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUB, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA.<br />14043/ 64.-2</p>
