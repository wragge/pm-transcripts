CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MACFARLANE BURNET CENTRE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH<br />
MELBOURNE 30 , SEPTEMBER 1987<br />
Mr Brian Naylor, Ma * ster of Ceremonies<br />
Professor Ian Gust, Director of the Macfarlane Burnet Centre<br />
for Medical Research<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
For nearly four decades, Fairfield Hospital has devoted<br />
itself to the care of patients suffering infectious diseases<br />
and to the conduct of research into the causes and cures of<br />
those diseases.<br />
Its work in these fields has been of such consistent<br />
excellence that Fairfield Hospital has established itself as<br />
one of Melbourne's household names, one of Australia's great<br />
institutions and it can be said without any hyperbole<br />
one of the world's preeminent centres for the expansion of<br />
medical knowledge<br />
The presence of so many distinguished guests here this<br />
morning testifies to the widespread recognition of Fairfield<br />
Hospital's work and to the tremendous community goodwill it<br />
has built over the years.<br />
The Breakthrough Appeal 1987, which it is my pleasure to<br />
launch today, aims to open a new chapter in the research<br />
capability of this institution by equipping the Macfarlane<br />
Burnet Centre for Medical Research for breakthroughs in the<br />
understanding and treatment of viruses.<br />
Viruses are responsible for more than 70 per cent of all<br />
illnesses and cause a tremendous range of disease.<br />
Encephalitis, meningitis, pneumonia, measles and rubella:<br />
even that incomplete list illustrates the profound,<br />
sometimes fatal, implications of viruses. They are the<br />
major cause * of death i'n developing countries. Today the<br />
AIDS virus or to give it its correct name the human immuno<br />
deficiency virus presents new, and worrying, and-still<br />
unsolved problems for all of us, in all countries. 001519 </p>
<p>In 1950, a small virology laboratory was established at<br />
Fairfield Hospital to study clinical virology and the<br />
epidemiology of the virus diseases of man.<br />
This initiative was taken by Australia's most distinguished<br />
scientist, the father of modern virology, the 1960 Nobel<br />
Prize Winner, Sir Macfarlane Burnet. Among all his other<br />
activities, Sir Macfarlane served Fairfield Hospital as<br />
honorary consultant epidemiologist and immunologist from<br />
1947 till his death in 1985.<br />
He inspired generations of medical scientists not only to<br />
scientific research, but to the dissemination of the fruits<br />
of their learning and theiv discoveries to all Australians.<br />
The virology laboratory has since established an<br />
international reputation for kits work on respiratory<br />
infections, rubella, gastroenteritis, hepatitis and AIDS.<br />
It is one of only three World Health Organisation centres<br />
for virus reference and research, for biosafety, and for<br />
AIDS. Through the Australian Medical Research and Development<br />
Corporation, it has developed diagnostic tests which are now<br />
being produced as commercial reagents and is collaborating<br />
with the National Institutes of Health in USA in testing the<br />
hepatitis A virus, which also has commercial applications.<br />
The virology laboratory is also sharing the fruits of its<br />
work with less developed countries. It has converted the<br />
hepatitis B vaccine from an expensive drug into a consumer<br />
item which can now be made more readily available to the<br />
world's 250 million chronic hepatitis B carriers of whom, at<br />
present, one million die annually.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,,<br />
in listing these achievements, it is essential to<br />
acknowledge the visionary leadership and dedication to<br />
research excellence of Professor Ian Gust.<br />
His work places him in the direct tradition of his<br />
predecessor Sir Macfarlane Burnet.<br />
But this is not the occasion for complacent resting on<br />
laurels. For Fairfield Hospital now stands at the cross<br />
roads of opportunity for contributing to major new<br />
breakthroughs in the treatment of viruses.<br />
I say this because-the last decade has seen the beginning of<br />
a new era in the fields of molecular biology and immunology.<br />
The study of virus diseases has made dramatic progress,<br />
leading to a greater understanding of the ways in which<br />
viruses produce disease sand ways in which they may be<br />
controlled. 0 0 152 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Remarkable advances in the production of antiviral drugs<br />
have provided physicians with new weapons for treating some<br />
virus infections, while advances in molecular biology have<br />
led to several new approaches to immunisation.<br />
virology is thus the most exciting and rapidly growing area<br />
of medical science and is poised for breakthroughs in<br />
research which could dramatically improve the health of<br />
millions of people.<br />
It was to help Fairfield's research effort play a full part<br />
in these developments that Sir Macfarlane Burnet agreed,<br />
before his death, to be founding patron of a new Medical<br />
Research Centre here.<br />
It was completely fitting that,, after his death, it was<br />
decided with the approval of his widow, Lady Burnet, that<br />
the new centre bear his name.<br />
So in April last year, my colleague, the then Minister for<br />
Health Neal Blewett, opened the Mlacfarlane Burnet Centre for<br />
Medical Research.<br />
And today it is my pleasure, as Honorary Chief Patron, to<br />
launch the fundraising appeal to accelerate this Centre's<br />
research effort.<br />
The Appeal has two stages.<br />
The first is to create an endowment fund which will enable<br />
the establishment of four new research groups concerned with<br />
pathogenesis the process by which viruses produce<br />
disease; epidemiology the study of patterns of infection;<br />
diagnosis, and<br />
prevention of virus diseases.<br />
The longer term aim is to build a new wing onto the existing<br />
virus laboratory to provide additional work space for the<br />
research groups, and offices and laboratories for visiting<br />
scientists and graduate students.<br />
By Easter next year, the Appeal hopes to have raised $ 2<br />
million for the first phase. The second stage aims to raise<br />
another $ 5 million and to complete planning by the end of<br />
1990 so construction can begin the following year. By 1995,<br />
the Centre-will be sufficiently well equipped to be the most<br />
important centre for the study of virus diseases in the<br />
Western Pacific region.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
This Appeal takes place in the-context of the fundamental<br />
economic reconstruction which Australia is undergoing. 0 15 21 </p>
<p>4.<br />
This reconstruction seeks to place Australia on a more<br />
competitive footing reducing our reliance on our<br />
traditional primary commodity exports, increasing our<br />
international competitiveness and productivity, boosting our<br />
capacity to produce innovative manufactures and. services for<br />
export to the world and as an integral part of all that<br />
to boost our capacity to conduct research of world standard.<br />
Private companies must play a leading role in the research<br />
effort -and the Government is doing what it can through<br />
grants and tax concessions to encourage them in this<br />
direction. The CSIRO has also made an enormous contribution to<br />
Australia's economic development through its research over<br />
its 61 year history.<br />
The Government is also establishing the Australian Research<br />
Council, which will play a major role in funding research,<br />
and which will help the nation formulate the right<br />
priorities for research. It will support both basic and<br />
applied research, and will improve cooperation between<br />
research conducted by universities, industry and Government.<br />
In medical research, government funding has also been<br />
crucial in enabling Australian researchers to achieve an<br />
international reputation for excellence. This Government"<br />
has shown its commitment to medical research by increasing<br />
the annual allocation for research supported by the National<br />
Health and Medical Research Council by more than 100% since<br />
it came to office.<br />
Since 1971 the virology unit at Fairfield Hospital has<br />
received more than $ 1 million from the NHMRC. It has also<br />
been the focal point for the NHMRC'funding on AIDS virology.<br />
This latter work has made Professor Gust an especially<br />
valued member of the National AIDS Task Force which provides<br />
medical and scientific advice to all Australian Governments.<br />
The Government has every reason to be proud of its record in<br />
lifting Australia's research capacity.<br />
But it is not a job which the public sector can do alone or<br />
should be called upon to do alone.<br />
Private companies must increase their own R D effort and<br />
they must also play a part in supporting the national<br />
research endeavour, including medical research. The rewards<br />
lie in the creation not only of a healthier society but,<br />
through innovations, exports, employment, and other means,<br />
the creation of a more prosperous one.<br />
Private sponsorship , of medical research in Australia is<br />
still much less than in other leading medical research<br />
countries. There are however welcome signs of change. i2 2 </p>
<p>Private sector donors will be contributing nearly<br />
million to the Miurdoch Institute for Research into Birth<br />
Defects which I launched at the beginning of this year.<br />
Your own Breakthrough Appeal 1987 is equally deserving of<br />
widespread private sector support.<br />
I wholeheartedly commend the Appeal and at this point I want<br />
to congratulate the Chairman of the Appeal, Richard Pratt,<br />
who has himself donated $ 100,000.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
This Centre has a great potential for improving the lives of<br />
every one of us. There is,' an energy and a creativity in<br />
this Centre which is-capable of producing phenomenal<br />
results.<br />
Ian Gust and Richard Pratt have thrown down a challenge to<br />
all Australians. I have great pleasure in launching the<br />
Breakthrough Appeal 1987 and urge Australians to give the<br />
Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research their full<br />
support. 0 0.15 23 </p>
