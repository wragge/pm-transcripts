I will make an official visit to Indonesia from 6 to 8 February 2002 at the invitation of President Megawati.  In Jakarta, I will hold discussions with President Megawati and key members of her Cabinet.  In addition, I will meet the Presiding Officers of the Indonesian Parliament and address a luncheon hosted by the Indonesia-Australia Business Council.  On 7 February I will travel to Yogyakarta and will meet the Sultan of Yogyakarta and attend a function hosted by him.  In Yogyakarta I will visit the ancient temple at Borobodur and the Gadjah Mada University, which has strong links to Australia.<br />
My visit will be an opportunity to discuss a range of important bilateral and regional policy issues with the Indonesian Government and to further strengthen the Australia-Indonesia relationship.<br />
Before I travel to Indonesia I will visit New York from 28 January where I will address the World Economic Forum.  During my visit to New York I will hold discussions on the Australian and international economies with major New York financial houses and firms with investment interests in Australia.  I will also meet United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and address the United Nations Security Council session on East Timor.<br />
My visit will be an opportunity to demonstrate the support of Australians for the people of New York who suffered so terribly during the events of 11 September 2001.  I will meet Mayor Bloomberg and visit the World Trade Centre site.</p>
