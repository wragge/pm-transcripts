PRIME MINISTER's WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
THE RIGHT TO GOVERN<br />
Sunday 21 September 1975<br />
Once again the press has been full of noisy<br />
speculation about the Opposition rejecting the Budget and<br />
somehow forcing another election. It is important to put<br />
an end to this talk because it is ill-founded and damaging<br />
damaging to the whole process of good government and<br />
administration, damaging to the stability and confidence<br />
of the entire community. I noti'ce Mr Fraser was quoted as<br />
the other day that a bit of uncertainty about elections<br />
helped boost business confidence. You can draw your own<br />
conclusions from that sort of reasoning, but at least<br />
it helps to explain Mr Fraser's shameful silence on the<br />
basic issu&amp; k. saying<br />
First let me make the Government's position<br />
perfectly clear. I've spelt it out before. We were<br />
elected last year for a three-year term. We intend to<br />
serve out that term. Everything we have done, all our<br />
policies and decisions have been based on the assumption<br />
that the Government would complete the normal term allowed<br />
by the Constitution. So it's not the Government that is<br />
causing this uncertainty it's the Opposition and its<br />
supporters. From the way the press carry on you would think<br />
that Mr Fraser only had to snap his fingers and an election<br />
would follow, That's by no means certain for a number of<br />
reasons. For a start, it's not clear whether the Opposition<br />
senators would all do as Mr Fraser tells them. Only this<br />
week Senator Jessop, a Liberal senator from South Australia<br />
stated publicly that he wouldn't have anything to do with<br />
blocking the Budget in the Senate. The independent senators,<br />
Senator Hall and Senator Bunton, have said the same thing.<br />
They have all taken the honourable and proper view that<br />
this isn'It the Senate's f unction. But let's assume f or the<br />
moment that the Opposition could force an election in this<br />
way. Let's consider how thoroughly destructive that would<br />
be to our whole system of government.<br />
Once we accept the idea that the Senate can<br />
force a Government to an early election, the whole system<br />
breaks down. Once the precedent is established any future<br />
Government not just this Government would be at the<br />
mercy of vindictive senators, of a chance majority in a<br />
hostile Upper House. Mr Fraser knows this perfectly well.<br />
Every Government has its ups and downs its spells of<br />
popularity and unpopularity.-That' s inevitable in politics.<br />
The Liberals went through these ups and downs when they were<br />
in office, and we've had more than our share of them ourselves.<br />
A Government contending with difficult economic conditionswith<br />
problems of inflation and unemployment shared by every<br />
other comparable country -a Government forced to take </p>
<p>2.<br />
difficult and sometimes tough decisions in the national<br />
interest -will be especially vulnerable to shifts of<br />
fortune and chan-ging moods in the electorate. It would<br />
be monstrous to suggest that a Government in these<br />
circumstances should be forced to the polls whenever<br />
it suited the Opposition. No Government would be free<br />
t ' o plan ahead, to take decisions for the future, to<br />
take tough measures when necessary.<br />
I can best illustrate'this point by reference<br />
to the Budget. The Budget we brought down last month was<br />
framed in the ccntext of long-term planning, as the<br />
second of the t-hree annual Budgets in the term for which<br />
this Government was elected. It iwas framed in the context<br />
of present economic problems, national and international.<br />
It is part of a steady, long-term attack on inflation.<br />
The essential point is this: the Budget must<br />
be given a chance to work. No one pretends that it will<br />
work overntght. No Budget works overnight. Mr Fraser<br />
himself has said that there is no quick, easy solution<br />
to our economic problems. The overriding need is for a period<br />
of steady, stable government while the Budget takes effect.<br />
The next few months are crucial. Any interruption to the Budget<br />
strategy, any disruption to the process of recovery, any<br />
attempt to bring ab~ out a wholly unnecessary political crisis,<br />
would have disastrous effects on public confidence and<br />
economic planning.<br />
0 The real question of course quite apart<br />
from anything the opposition might like to do is what<br />
they could do. The Constitution says-nothing on this<br />
point and there are absolutely no conventions or precedents<br />
to guide us. ' The Senate has never rejected a money bill or<br />
a Budget in its whole 75-year history that alone will<br />
give you some idea of how irregular, how monstrous, the<br />
idea is. There is actually no provision in the Constitution<br />
or any precedent to suggest that an election must follow<br />
the rejection of a Budget at all. In fact there are good<br />
grounds for believing that the Senate's rejection of a<br />
Budget would be in itself unconstitutional. After all,<br />
the Constitution specifically-plays down that the Senate may<br />
neither originate nor amend a money bill. It hardly seems<br />
likely that the found ' ing fathers intended that the Senate<br />
should reject bills which they are forbidden even to amend.<br />
Mr Fraser seems to be falling into exactly<br />
the same trap as Mr Snedden on this issue. Three weeks ago<br />
he said the Budget would be passed. He has more than once<br />
expressed the view that an elected Government must be allowed<br />
to govern. He stated this principle on the very day he was<br />
elected as Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, one of the<br />
reasons his colleagues elected him was to put an end to the<br />
constant speculation, the damage done to his party and the<br />
country by Mr Snedden's endless and irresponsible threats of<br />
an election. People were sick and tired of Mr Snedden<br />
harping on the subject. We saw what happened last year when<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>the Liberals knuckled under to Country Party pressure and the<br />
Senate threatened to reject supply. The people wouldn't wear<br />
it. I called an election myself on that occasion so that<br />
our Medibank bills and other important measures could get<br />
through Parliament afterwards. The people re-elected the<br />
Government. The Liberals turned to a new leader who<br />
professed some respect for constitutional principles,<br />
for political decency, for the rules of the game.<br />
People shouldn't assume that just because there<br />
was an election last time the Senate abused its powers,<br />
there would necessarily be an election if they did it again.<br />
It's obvious that Mr Fraser is under exactly the same<br />
pressures as Mr Snedden. He's looking more like another<br />
Snedden every day. He knows the proper course; the<br />
question is whether he will stick to his guns. It takes<br />
a special sort ofE courage real political guts to<br />
stand up to the jackals in the Opposition and resist their<br />
demands. If Mr Fraser has-any self-respect, if he has any<br />
shred of honour, he will make it clear, once and for all,<br />
that an election is just not on. He will show his party<br />
and the country that he really is the Leader of the Opposition<br />
and not a stooge of the Anthonys, the Courts, the Lynches,<br />
the Bjelke-Petersens and the various unscrupulous<br />
pressure groups that surround them. Every day he dithers<br />
on this issue adds to the nation's uncertainty, weakens our<br />
democratic system, jand reinforces the impression that when<br />
the heat is really on, Malcolm Fraser is just as weak and<br />
compromising as his unfortunate predecessor. </p>
