TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
REV. HOLLINGWORTH, AND SIMON BAILEY<br />
DOORSTOP, AUISTRALIAN OF THE YEAR, ADMIRALTY HOUSE, SYDNEY<br />
26 JANUARY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I've been a good listener. I've met him a few times,<br />
this fellow, over the years. But I was particularly<br />
pleased with Peter, that someone representing the<br />
softer values of Australia was up there as Australian<br />
of the Yfear. Which is a nice thing for this country.<br />
J: What are you planning to do this year?<br />
REV: Well apart from running a diocese I am doing something<br />
about renewing the life of the church and finishing off<br />
a cathedral, I want to get into raising money to help<br />
young people who can't get into the workforce, who<br />
can't get traineeships. And already with the support<br />
of the Federal Government through our employment action<br />
centres, we have a got a very good program going in two<br />
States of Australia, and I hope we can extend that.<br />
And I hope we can get some money in to help young<br />
people who would otherwise take advantage of all that.<br />
J: How do you feel about winning the award?<br />
REV: Overwhe: lmed mostly. I think you can only accept it on<br />
behalf of other people, not on your own behalf.<br />
J: Well, Mr Hawke told you that you to butt out, that you<br />
didn't know' what you were talking about. Is that the<br />
case?<br />
REV: No, he didn't quite say it as directly as that. He<br />
suggested that I should stick to my area of<br />
responsibility and he would stick to his.<br />
J: Will you be sticking to your area of responsibility? </p>
<p>REV: Well I think we are all concerned about the building up<br />
of a just, efficient, caring, participatory Australia,<br />
and we will work together in partnership, I'm sure.<br />
PM: Absolutely<br />
J: Will this be shown in your economic statement Mr<br />
Keating?<br />
PM: Well, as I see it that will be essentially the essence<br />
of it because a country without fairness and equity is<br />
a count-y that does not understand itself well. And we<br />
will be continuing to keep a focus on those values.<br />
J: Mr Keating, will traineeships be a specific be part of<br />
the Economic Statement?<br />
PM: Well I can't say what is in the Economic Statement, but<br />
the labour market area has traditionally been an area<br />
of concern to us and most particular at this time,<br />
including and especially for young people.<br />
J: Simon how do you feel?<br />
SB: Overawed, actually. I'm very honoured. I'm sure there<br />
are many young people in this country who are equally<br />
deserving of this honour.<br />
J: What do you plan to do now?<br />
SB: Get back to training if I can. After I start the<br />
National. Championships in early March I go to Arizona<br />
to perform there, so I have got to get back into peak<br />
condition.<br />
J: Does this vindicate your statement from last year,<br />
Archbishop?<br />
REV: I think this has nothing to do with my statement last<br />
year.<br />
J: You're nriot, you're certain you're not<br />
REV: No I do not. I think it's to do with a long term<br />
commitment to justice and the care of the poor over<br />
many, many years. I think that's the issue really.<br />
You don't achieve these things, flash in the pan<br />
activities. Because it is those who are the long-term<br />
stayers, that ' are going to achieve something.<br />
J: But surely perhaps some of those statements, that at<br />
the time were a little controversial, are major step in<br />
campaign to actually get things done? </p>
<p>3<br />
REV: There is nothing wrong with controversy as long as it<br />
speaks the truth, and as long as it keeps the issues<br />
before people who are in a position to make decisions.<br />
I don't resile from any of that and I'm sure that the<br />
Prime Minister and everybody else would expect me to do<br />
it.<br />
PM: If there are issues of substance, then controversy can<br />
often bring light to a subject. So there we are.<br />
