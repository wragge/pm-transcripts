INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON HUMAN RELATIONS<br />
HED T 11LBOURNE. VICTORIA 3JF MAY. j96<br />
Speech by thePe ' M4iister,,, t~ ien Sir RobertMenzies~<br />
Mr. Chairman Such are the infirmities of human memory that I was<br />
all ready to address you as Mr. President. ( Laughter) I am<br />
very glad or sorry as the case may be to be reminded that<br />
I am the President, though I fear I won't be very conspicuously<br />
present for a very long portion of the proceedings. However,<br />
I am here to open them.<br />
The first thing I want to do is to read to you, wiith<br />
the permission of the Council, the folloling message which was<br />
sent by the Council to His Royal Highness, Prince Philip:<br />
" The Chairman and Members of the Council of<br />
the International Congress on Human Relations in<br />
Melbourne send greetings and good wishes on the eve<br />
of the Congress. We appreciate the keen interest<br />
you have shoxm in the revolutionary technical changes<br />
in industry and commerce and believe that this Congress<br />
will assist materially in the understanding of the<br />
great social problems of our day. The Commonwealth<br />
and indeed the whole world will benefit from the work<br />
of this Congress which you have supported by your<br />
gracious patronage."<br />
Prince Philip has now replied in these terms<br />
" Thank you for your kind message which I was<br />
delighted to receive. I am sure that each one of you<br />
who attends this international congress will learn<br />
something of value which will contribute to better and<br />
happier human relations throughout the world. MY<br />
begt wishes to you all."<br />
Then there is another message from the Prime Minister<br />
of Japan w., hich, very generously, has been done into English for<br />
my benefit ( Laughter) " It gives me great pleasure to congratulate<br />
you on the successful opening of the International<br />
Congress of Human Relations."<br />
I call that a very intelligent anticipation because it hasntt<br />
yet been opened,,,...<br />
" I would say it is a very timely project to hold this<br />
congress at a time when all the industrially-developed<br />
countries in the world are faced with difficult social<br />
and economic problems resulting from advancement in<br />
technology and automation. Japan is no exception.<br />
Although Japan was well known for abundant human<br />
resources until quite recently, the progress achieved<br />
in industrial mechanisation has brought in its wake<br />
an increasingl~ y serious labour shortage. Consequently<br />
how to turn technical advancement to the true benefit<br />
of the human being is now a widely-discussed topic in<br />
our business circles. I am happy to know that Mr. Masaru<br />
Ibuka is participating in this congress as a lecturer. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
" I am sure that Mr. Ibuka with his profound<br />
knowledge and experience in modern management<br />
will be able to contribute to this conference<br />
in many ways. I sincerely hope that closer<br />
co-operation will be further promoted between<br />
Australia and Japan as well as among the<br />
participating countries as a whole to solve the<br />
various problems common to our industries."<br />
Well, having read those two stimulating messages to you I just<br />
want to approach the task of opening the Congress and o1 saying,<br />
with your permission, a few words about its business,<br />
Long experience has shown me now that the first<br />
thing to do when you have to open something is to discover what<br />
it is. I find this is no small advantage and therefore I<br />
looked very closely to see what was the broad theme of the<br />
congress, and there it was, and here it is The Social and<br />
Economic Impact of Automation and Technical Change.<br />
, Now Sir, in the presence of a great number of<br />
pundits in this field, it is not for me to undertake a technical<br />
examination of this theme. All I can do in a few minutes is<br />
to present you with what you will regard as platitudes but which<br />
I might hope to regard as a few elements of commonsense in<br />
approaching this problem.<br />
Change. Change is a fact. It cantt be ignored.<br />
It must not be disposed of by wishful thinking, and yet the<br />
curious thing about us human beings is that we are always<br />
chronically demanding change and equally chronically afraid of<br />
it, 1: think that's basically true. We are all progressives<br />
in politics and we say so, repeatedly. There are no people in<br />
the whole political arena who are not desperately anxious for<br />
change and no voters that ever I have been able to discover who<br />
don't share that desperate anxiety. But when it comes to the<br />
point there is not much change, is there? There is a certain<br />
amount of resistance to change. You get this curious paradox in<br />
the human being. Well, on this problem we, I thinkl, might present<br />
a question to ourselves: Does technological change threaten<br />
full employment? Because a lot of people think, and very<br />
seriously, that it does. That always seems to me to be an<br />
error an error about as old as the Industrial Revolution.<br />
I would just like to make the briefest of analysis of this<br />
point with you. First of all I have no doubt myself that full<br />
employment stimulates the demand for technological improvement.<br />
In a human world we have just agreed that it is a surplus<br />
of jobs over men, which is how some people will define full<br />
employment, a surplus of that kind tends to mean, c. oesn't it,<br />
a little less personal effort, some bidding-up for the employees<br />
who are required for some enterprise some initial increasing<br />
unit cost of whatever it is that is being produced.<br />
Well now, of course, there are some industries,<br />
perhaps represented here this morning, which believe they can<br />
pass it on and if they believe they can pass it on they think<br />
that is all right. They will accept the causes of the passing on.<br />
But in industries which have to meet the market in a competitive<br />
world and those industries include an increasing number of<br />
manufacturers in Australia, for example, for exportc, rising<br />
9 o / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
costs which result from the initial application of over-full<br />
employment or full employment will stimulate two things. One<br />
is technological advance. This will at once be seen as something<br />
which provides the answer, something that reconciles the new<br />
standard of pay or the new standard of competition for labour<br />
with the need to produce and to produce effectively for a market.<br />
So technological advance is stimulated, in my opinion by full<br />
employment, and market advance is also stimulated by l<br />
employment because as the pressure comes on so the search for<br />
the market and particularly for the variation of the market wiill<br />
grow stronger and stronger.<br />
Now that is one side of the picture as I see it<br />
full employment really stimulates the demand for Lechnological<br />
improvement. The other side of that proposition is this that<br />
technological imp3rovement need not threaten employment. All<br />
sorts of short-term expedients may have to be applied to cushion<br />
the impact, the immediate impact of new labour-saving devices<br />
and I anticipate you w~ ill be hearing some expert views on those<br />
matters before you finish. But it would be to despair about<br />
the reality and substance of human progress to ignore the<br />
dominant facts that technological advance will cheapen the<br />
processes of production and therefore give rise to a greater<br />
demand and therefore directly and indirectly stimulate employment.<br />
I emphasise " and indirectly". One has only to<br />
recall the history, the modern history of the motor car industry<br />
and its mass production to roalise that what is indirect is<br />
even more extensive than what is direct in the employment f~ ield<br />
and yet this has been in an industry where immense technological<br />
progress has been made. And again, technological advance leads<br />
to new types of production, new commodities to create new<br />
demands and to meet new demands. Whole new industries can<br />
arise as indeed they have been increasingly during the last<br />
forty years.. I just pause for a minute to emphasise this point<br />
that the advance in technology leads to new types of production.<br />
One is frequently conscious of the fact to take Australia by<br />
way of example there is a certain orthodoxy in our minds about<br />
what we can sell to other countries, just as, I venture to say,<br />
British industry was for a considerable time handicapped by<br />
o similar belief that there were certain things the world could<br />
buy and if they didn't want to buy those, it was just too bad.<br />
Now we Australians here have constantly to be on the searLch for<br />
a new product which a new market will be willing to take, and<br />
in order to do that there will need to be the most tremendous<br />
pressure in the technological field not a fear of it but a<br />
use of it, a stimulation of it for those purposes.<br />
There is another aspect in my own country which<br />
is also quite material, W1e need here, and are at all times<br />
moving towards it, a better and a speedier application in<br />
industry both primary industry and secondary industry of<br />
scientific and technological research because that will tend to<br />
reduce costs and therefore to increase the stability of the<br />
whole economy. The process has been a little too slow, I<br />
think in the past, I have a strong feeling that there are<br />
many Items which could lead to great technological advance which<br />
are sluggish in their journey from the lab, to the farm or to<br />
the factory. This is a matter to wihich we are constantly<br />
directing attention and of course that will be no threat to<br />
full employment. 6n the contrary, this constant application of<br />
000 1+ </p>
<p>new ideas to stimulate old productions and to create new<br />
ones is the best guarantee, properly considered, of useful<br />
employment for a rapidly-increasing population.<br />
I venture to say, Sir, that it is dangerous<br />
to be distracted by isolated instances or to suffer from a<br />
fear of becoming a technologically-advanced community.<br />
Nobody need fear that. On the contrary, we should all pray<br />
for it. The great questions, Sir, on which this conference<br />
of distinguished minds will throw much light are therefore:<br />
Are we willing to respond to the challenge of change? Are<br />
we competent to respond to the challenge of change? And in<br />
all this the role of education is of course of supreme<br />
moment not only scientific education, not only technical<br />
education, but also education in humane letters without which<br />
our whole sense of proportion and perspective can weaken with<br />
disastrous human consequences as we have had every reason to<br />
learn in the course of our lifetimes,<br />
Sir, those are purely preliminary observations.<br />
I don't profess, as I said at the beginning, that there is<br />
any novelty about them but I have found it interesting to<br />
bring a few of my own thoughts together in this fashion.<br />
I wish this congress great success. I can't imagine a better<br />
time at which to hold it. I can't imagine a more useful theme<br />
to discuss. Men are thinking about it all over t'ae world.<br />
You can throw so much light on it in this conference that you<br />
will be able to provide that light in other countries around<br />
the globe. I wish you every success. I now declare the<br />
Congress open.<br />
