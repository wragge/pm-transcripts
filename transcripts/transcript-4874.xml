PRIME MHAINITE<br />
FOR PRESS 1 NOVEM1BER, 1978<br />
INTEREST RATES<br />
The action of the trading banks this evening in reducing<br />
interest rates on a range of bank loans is welcome. This is<br />
particularly so in the case of the .5 percent reduction in the<br />
maximum overdraft rate on loans of less tnan $ 100,000. 1 am<br />
pleased that this reduction will also apply to new term loans<br />
and to new farm development loans of less than $ 100,000.<br />
Earlier this year the trading banks and savings banks reduced<br />
their interest rates on housing loans by .5 percent.<br />
The present action of the banks is an extension of these<br />
reductions to other types of lending.<br />
It is to be expected that, on average, a .5 percent interest<br />
rate reduction will also take place on banks' loans of<br />
above $ 100,000. ilany other private lending rates to<br />
businessmen, farmers and individuals ' have come down during<br />
the past year, by 1 percent and more, and I am hopeful that<br />
these reductions will be followed up in other sections of<br />
the market.<br />
Commonwealth bond yields hnave now come down by up to 1. 7 percent<br />
( in the case of long-term bonds) since September 1977.--<br />
These reductions are consistent with the objective of<br />
maintaining proper control of the money supply. The Government<br />
will continue the policy to lower rates on a sustainable basis<br />
as inflation is reduced and as general economic conditions<br />
permit.<br />
With yesterday's reduction of .25 percent in the interest<br />
rate on Australian Saving Bonds, the interest rate on these<br />
securities has now come down from 10 percent to 8.75 percent<br />
since September 1977. I expect this latest reduction will<br />
soon be followed by reductions in other rates. In the case<br />
of building societies I am pleased to see that various<br />
societies are independently taking action to lower their rates.<br />
Interest rates on housing-loaiis have come down in the case of<br />
permanent building societies, by upward of .5 percent, in<br />
the case of savings and trading banks by .5 percent, and from<br />
finance companies and life offices by about 1 percent.<br />
