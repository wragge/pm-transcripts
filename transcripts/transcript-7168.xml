PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 April 1987<br />
JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER<br />
FOR TRADE, THE HON J S DAWKINS<br />
The Minister for Trade and I today congratulated the Sydney<br />
company Macdonald Wagner on its recent success in winning a<br />
major consulting contract associated with a massive $ 300m<br />
port redevelopment project at Bahia Blanca in Argentina.<br />
The success of Macdonald Wagner in winning the contract is<br />
an example that other Australian consulting firms should<br />
seek to emulate. Trade in services is a rapidly growing<br />
area of world trade. Consultancy services is an area where<br />
Australia clearly has the expertise and the ability to<br />
compete internationally.<br />
Macdonald Wagner has shown great drive and initiative in<br />
pursuing the project. It was able to secure the project<br />
ahead of competition from the USSR, Canada, the US, Holland,<br />
France and Italy. This reflects the ability of this company<br />
as well as the unprecedented competitiveness of Australian<br />
industry. A<br />
The success achieved by Macdonald Wagner has not been easily<br />
secured. The company has worked consistently since June<br />
1983 to secure the project.<br />
Just as Macdonald Wagner has done, exporters must show a<br />
commitment to exports if they are to succeed on overseas<br />
markets. Exports, whether in goods or services, should not<br />
be seen as something a company dabbles in when it has excess<br />
capacity. Such an approach is both unlikely to be<br />
successful and damage Australia's reputation in overseas<br />
markets. We note that overseas projects such as this also have the<br />
potential to link in other Australian industry through the<br />
supply of capital equipment and other services.<br />
Mr Tony Denham, Managing Director, and Mr Andrew Murray,<br />
Marketing Manager, will be available for interview in Senate<br />
3 at 2.00pm.<br />
