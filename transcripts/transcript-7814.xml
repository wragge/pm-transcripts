coKIicmC CONDITIONS<br />
The limited economic data that have become available since<br />
the September IPAC meeting are broadly consistent with the<br />
Budqet-ti forecasts for economic developments over the<br />
course of 1989-90.<br />
While at this stage we do not have National Accounts<br />
information for the September quarter, other useful<br />
statistics are available.<br />
It is clear that demand and activity in the housing sector<br />
have declined significantly.<br />
House prices in some areas are already falling, in pert<br />
unwinding the sharp rises of recent years.<br />
The number of building approvals for nev private dwellings<br />
fell by 21 per cent in the September quarter, to be around<br />
26 per cent below the peak reached in late 1968.<br />
The latest projection of the Indicative Planning Council is<br />
that total commencements will fall to around 133,000 in<br />
1989-90, 24 per cent lower than the unsustainable level of<br />
175,000 in 1988-69.<br />
The non-dwelling construction sector also appears to be<br />
veakening from its recent high with a 16 per cent fall in<br />
the value of building approvals evident in the September<br />
quarter.<br />
We are witnessing, therefore, a fairly general contraction<br />
in the building sector, which is broadly consistent with<br />
Budget projections and our strategy for slowing excessive<br />
demand growt.<br />
The contract-ion underway in the buildinq sector will affect<br />
cons r durable expenditures, as will the direct impact of<br />
interest rates. </p>
<p>At constant prices seasonally adjusted retail trade rose<br />
0.9% in the September quarter, consistent with budget<br />
projections. Monthly growth is slowing on a trend basis,<br />
which appears to be supported by anecdotal evidence.<br />
While business surveys suggest investment expectations<br />
remain generally buoyant, some scaling back of intentions<br />
was evident in the CAI/ Westpac survey of business trends<br />
released in September.<br />
As demand growth weakens investment intentions may be wound<br />
back generally, to more sustainable levels.<br />
In the labour market, we have some evidence of easing,<br />
particularly declines in job vacancies.<br />
Turning points are notoriously difficult to predict with<br />
precision and I do not want to draw too much out of the<br />
data. The main conclusion I want to leave with you, however, is<br />
that, on the basis of the limited number of indicators<br />
available to date, the Government has no reason to believe<br />
that doaestic demand and employment growth will not unfold<br />
in a manner broadly consistent with Budget forecasts.<br />
While demand is forecast to fall significantly, overall<br />
product growth should be sufficient to protect the<br />
employment gains of recent years.<br />
None of this, of course, suggests that conditions have<br />
arrived at this stage which would allow a moderation in the<br />
stance of monetary policy.<br />
Monetary policy easing can only be considered when clear<br />
economic evidence points to such a conclusion. To act<br />
otherwise would be self-defeating from all perspectives.<br />
On the external side, the current account deficit figures<br />
fnr Alngust and Septaeber are consistent with the Budqet-time<br />
view that the improvement in the current account over the<br />
course of 1989-90 will be concentrated in the second half of<br />
the year.<br />
PRICES AND INCOMIS<br />
On present indications, the Septeaber quarter consumer price<br />
index indicated that the peak in inflationary pressures has<br />
been passed.<br />
As expected, the rate of increase in consumer prices in the<br />
September quarter continued to reflect mortgage interest<br />
charges, the lagged effects on fresh fruit and vegetables<br />
prices from major flooding in the eastern states earlier<br />
this year and the effects of changes to compulsory third<br />
party insurance in New South Wales. </p>
<p>As the effects of those influences wane in the quarters<br />
ahead, and donestic demand pressures ease, we expect to<br />
observe a steady reduction in inflation.<br />
with the first wage increase available under the Structural<br />
Efficieny Principle now flowing smoothly through the<br />
workforce,, the prospects are not only for a continuation of<br />
responsible wage outcomes but for substantial workplace<br />
reform via award restructuring.<br />
To a significant extent, the success of award restructuring<br />
has ben and remains dependent on the initiative shown by<br />
manaqemint in fully exploring the opportunities offered<br />
under the current system.<br />
No-one is suggesting that the negotiation of change is easy.<br />
Clearly it is not particularly when employers are<br />
confronted with a multitude of unions and awards that often<br />
bear little relationship to the needs of individual<br />
prisea.<br />
But this is no excuse for inaction.<br />
The Irndutrial Relations Commission has ade it perfectly<br />
clear that the award restructuring processes can themselves<br />
be used as a vehicle for reforming award and union coverage.<br />
Looking beyond that, broader mechanism are already in<br />
place, with the full support and co-operation of the ACTU,<br />
for a vore concerted move away from intar-industry or<br />
occupational awards and fragmented, craft based unions to<br />
arrangements which better reflect the needs of individual<br />
industries and enterprises.<br />
While there is a widespread recognition that wage<br />
negotiations mst have an increasing enterprise focus there<br />
is also an acceptance that this process aust be underpinned<br />
by a continuing role for the Accord to ensure effective<br />
aggregate wage outcomes.<br />
I have already foreshadowed that the Government next year<br />
will be looking once again to discussing aggregate wage<br />
outCOs with the ACTU.<br />
Both parties will be able to enter these discussions with<br />
the confidence that the Accord has survived the threat posed<br />
to it by the unjustified pay demands of the Australian<br />
Federation of Air Pilots ( APAP).<br />
It is worth recalling that barely a fev months ago many<br />
. ommntator were contemplating the impact on the Australian<br />
economy of a wages break-out led by the APAP.<br />
Today it is widely recognised that the threat has been<br />
turned back. </p>
<p>of course the Government does not pretend for an instant<br />
that this has been without costs.<br />
Early this week we attempted to address some of these costs<br />
with the announcement of the assistance package to the<br />
tourism industry.<br />
But the damage incurred by refusing to meet the AFAP's<br />
demands Uas beentonly a fraction of the economic misery that<br />
would have resultad if the Government had caved-in.<br />
Instead the Australian community has successfully defended a<br />
wages system that has secured over 1.5 million new jobs in<br />
the last 6 years and internationally competitive wage<br />
The only certain element in the new wages system from the<br />
Governumuts paint of view is that it must continue to<br />
deliver aggregate wage outcomes compatible with maintaining<br />
Australia'. international competitiveness.<br />
Above all else, the Government will continue to stress in<br />
theze discusions that the reduction of Australia's external.<br />
imbalance must remain our paramount economic policy<br />
objective. That is the only way we as a nation will be able to secure<br />
sustainable declines in interest rates and affordableincreases<br />
in living standards.<br />
In this context,, the CGovernment welcomes the initiative of<br />
the Business Council of Australia this week-in seeking to<br />
draw awe attention to ways Australia can improve its<br />
external imbalance.<br />
if the ICafs initiative leads to greater understanding# good<br />
can only come from it.<br />
MANU7ACTURXNG 5Z='' R PWOIUIANCR<br />
Of course, labour market reform is just one aspect of the<br />
Goverrmnt'se multifaceted imicroeconomic reform agenda.<br />
Another area is industry policy.<br />
An imprtant part of our industry policy strategy is to<br />
eps-industries to international competition by reducing<br />
assistance and dismantling impedivents elsewhere in the<br />
ecOMy which affect international competitiveness.<br />
of course structural reform takes time.<br />
I have already this week commented on pessimistic views<br />
concqxminq Australia'a manufacturing industry,<br />
The tacts just do not support gloomy prognosis. </p>
<p>A study by the Bureau of Industry Economics on the trade<br />
performance of manufacturing released earlier this year<br />
concluded that:<br />
OXanufacturing has undergone major structural change<br />
over the last few years, with a significant<br />
re-orientation to international markets. Manufacturers<br />
have exported an increasing share of their output, and<br />
the rate of growth in import penetration has slowed."<br />
More recent figures indicate that, over the two years to the<br />
June quarter 1989, manufacturing export volumes grew by<br />
per cent.<br />
Over the two years to the June quarter 1989, the growth in<br />
manufacturing output averaged 6.3 per cent a year, compared<br />
with 5.3 per cant a year for the economy as a whole.<br />
Productivity growth in manufacturing over that period,<br />
averaging 2.3 per cent a year, was twice as great as that<br />
for the whole economy.<br />
Investment in manufacturing has been strong. Over the past<br />
five years manufacturing investment has grown at an average<br />
rate of 13.2 per cent a year, a stark contrast with the<br />
story in the preceding five years.<br />
This growth has not only been devoted to replacing old<br />
capital, but also to expanding capacity in new product<br />
areas.<br />
A recent BIB survey of large manufacturers indicates that<br />
current investments are leading to significant increases in<br />
capacity ( 6.3 per cent growth in capacity is expected in<br />
1589-90) and reductions in unit costs ( a 2.5 per cent<br />
reduetien is expected in 1989-90).<br />
Tais inveum surge is spread over a wide reunu or<br />
manufacturers, including key sectors such as chemicals,<br />
paper and printing, steel, transport, equipment and food<br />
process ing.<br />
We are, of course, far from having completed our goal of<br />
achieving a truly internationally competitive manufacturing<br />
sector.<br />
We are still a long way from completely dismantling the<br />
structure of past interventions that have protected such of<br />
industry from the full force of competition and have stifled<br />
the qrowth of well-manaqed and efficient industries, eager<br />
to take their place in world markets.<br />
But as I have already outlined, the groundwork is being laid<br />
and compaies are beginning to react. </p>
<p>We will be pressing forward on a broad front on<br />
aicroeconomic reform tackling the removal of distortions and<br />
the enhancement of the capabilities of the economy to adjust<br />
to change. An important catalyst for change will be the<br />
inquiries and reports of the new Industry Commission. It is<br />
being given a broad charter, and the first five ref erences<br />
of a wide-ranging work program have already commenced.<br />
Finally, in some areas of economic reform it is not only<br />
necessary to make further advances, but also to defend our<br />
gains to date.<br />
It is instructive to appreciate that recent statements by<br />
the opposition mean that there is nov a measure of consensus<br />
on a wide range of fundamental tax reforms.<br />
These include the previously contentious fringe benefits<br />
tax, the denial of deductibility for entertainment, the tax<br />
file number system and the removal of the income tax<br />
lipemption for gold mining.<br />
Theme reform are an accepted part of the taxation<br />
structure, not only making the system fairer and more<br />
efficient, but also funding significantly lower corporate<br />
and personal income tax rates.<br />
A significant remaining reform of contention is the capital<br />
gains tax.<br />
Today there is virtually unanimous agreement amongst<br />
inforued commentators that the CGT in a necessary tax on<br />
anti-avoidance, equity and efficiency grounds.<br />
My pint in raising thic imeme in that I hope t'hat. the<br />
business community will take the mature, longer term view<br />
when assessing this issue.<br />
Obviously, some in business, as major owners of capital, may<br />
be tempted to think of the superficial advantages to them of<br />
the abolition of the capital gains tax.<br />
I an suggesting there are much broader issues at stake.<br />
We must recognise the important efficiency considerations at<br />
issue. Removal of capital gains tax will bias investment<br />
towards assets that earn income predominantly from capital<br />
gains, so perverting the proud achievement of this<br />
Gover~ ment in attaining the highest ever recorded level of<br />
business investment to GDP.<br />
We must also consider whether the community will be prepared<br />
to put up with a tax system which not only funds a reduction<br />
in the corporate tax rate to 39 per cant, full dividend<br />
imputation,, and a large cut in the top personal rate, but<br />
also allow capital gains to be tax-free. </p>
<p>7.<br />
it in in the lonq term interests of Australian business that<br />
tMe tax system be socially sustainable and economically<br />
efficient. I do not believe that the alternative proposed meets these<br />
basic tests. </p>
