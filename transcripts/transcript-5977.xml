WAES PAUSE<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister,<br />
the Rt lion J Anthony, C. H. M. P.)<br />
The Commonweal th submiss ion for a 12--month w: iges and<br />
salaries pause in the private sector w. i I be heard by the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Conrm. issi on on Thursday. The<br />
Government is hopeful, of a successful outcome at that hearing.<br />
Legislation to implement a 12-month waqes and salaries<br />
pause in the public sector will be introduced in the House of<br />
Representatives tomorrow afternoon.<br />
The Government has also considered the proposal made<br />
by the ACTU last Thursday for a conference on the economy<br />
involving the Commonwealth and State Governments, the ACTU and<br />
employer representatives.<br />
The Government seeks the active support of the ACTU for<br />
measures to relieve pressure on employment, and believes he<br />
proposal merits longer-term consideration.<br />
It believes, however, that current economic conditions,<br />
especially the very real threat to jobs posed by further wage<br />
rises, make it imperative to successfully implement a: soon as<br />
possible the wages and salaries pause agreed to at the Spec. ail<br />
Premiers Conference last week.<br />
