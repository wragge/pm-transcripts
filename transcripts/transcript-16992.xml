    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I extend to the President and people of the Republic of Indonesia our sincere condolences on the passing of former Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid.</p>
<p>Former President Wahid, more popularly known as Gus Dur, was President of Indonesia from 1999 until 2001, a crucial period in Indonesia's political transformation. Mr Wahid was responsible for a number of important reforms which assisted his country's path towards becoming a modern democracy.</p>
<p>Mr Wahid was also highly influential as a moderate Islamic leader in Indonesia and a strong advocate of ethnic and religious tolerance.</p>
<p>Former President Wahid's historic visit to Australia in June 2001, the first by an Indonesian President since 1975, was a significant recognition of the importance of the bilateral relationship and set a positive tone for relations between Australia and Indonesia in the years that followed.</p>
<p>Former President Wahid was much admired and respected not only within Indonesia, but also by many Australians and others throughout our region. Our thoughts go in particular to his family, including his widow and four daughters.</p>
