THEF A1\ EfRICAN AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATION<br />

SpDeec bthe Primre Minister. the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert MenzLe.<br />
Now, I thioughit I would just like to say a littl'-3e to you<br />
about an aspect or ipahaps two aspects, of 114ton~ betoa<br />
our countries. It is far maore th'an a pos-;--randi-* al flour-ish to s y that<br />
the United States and Austraiia are d'woted friends th-au~ s<br />
elementary, vle all know that, wo know that this relalionshIil ljhas come<br />

House who thiink thiat we fl-ove a sort of cupjb oa love because we<br />
look to you, th e United States of Araefr. rE tri protect us to be<br />
our friend in times of ne-d. I su~ pp07a, t 0Cflfl-! i CQlyq ; a t t ha3t<br />
is perfectly true2 but It is much m-ore, 0 Grue to ' Say t ve rA d<br />
ourselves as uoncerned 4-11 ccio ot!-in rJ J~ ary tei_-ms Land in<br />

sam,, e ki'Lnd of peopie and ' T7 do iaprif thiat'a no-t too weak a<br />

And when twro fri endly na~ cioris one gr. eat and one small<br />

to argue 2bout hoiw bbmg. cgi . er one is tho~ llpn th-e othe2 whnat<br />
contr-ibution one imakas -to tiiis or the oth; er malkes to that,<br />
Thre truth is that i* Ln our relaltions with you, not cnly1: are<br />
thiey wonderful fro-m our point o f v4iew%, but tihey are reciprocal,<br />
thoiy imTpor obli get ions onour p-.; rtbig 0lWhh ewl<br />
at all. timoes honourably dischrge ard thre3fore -we are friend&amp; s',<br />
I know of,-no c-ircum~ stan. ce that could conyiceivably arise<br />
in the iworld that woiild ma-ke us ene-mies. ut do let ime repeat<br />
scmething I have sai. d before today. You are tha grcatos, t power<br />
inteworld and sometines in fact, perhaps reasonably L'rcquenty<br />
you admit iJt, But you ar~ e the greatest power in th-e -w.. orld tkhe<br />
greatest in physical. resour-ces thie greatest, wrhen it comes to the<br />
point, in that moral fo-rce that can be exercised by a0 great and<br />
civilised people,<br />
And like all great powers in the history of the world, you<br />
have made rather-more critics than friends, I was going to say<br />
onemries, maybe. You. have becn &amp; ble to help scores of nations a<br />
lo fpeople don't lilke being hielpe-d., Thecy takLe help, they see<br />
the intrinsaic merit of the help., but at the back, of their minds<br />
there J. s a sort of f&amp; pling cf -6sent~ ment, W'hy does he have all<br />
those things whean I don~ t? Thnis is thie oldest thing in -the world.<br />
Nowv, Sir, this is pcrtu of the low of life arnd the main thing<br />
is that we are not to be discouraged in wc11l-doing h causa thei<br />
am-ount of gra'titudo t'rat is -to be nodce is inadequa-te. T he i<br />
are oodth-ngs to bo. doro arnd th_ er e are go3od things thiat oughlt<br />

their dividends in world progress and in world peace.<br />
In the second place, of course we are right down there<br />
off the South-East of Asia and we have immediate problems, almost<br />
on our doorstep. And it is to the great credit of the Uni-ted<br />
States that it has assumed a role in the solution of those<br />
problems which is historically of tremendous importance. But we<br />
are there and we are a long way away,<br />
We have next to us Indonesia, 80 or 90 million people;<br />
a lovely country, a country whicL has a form of government which<br />
is no doubt one of those intr: im forms of government in which<br />
power tends to be concentrated in one hand or one set of hands,<br />
We have one ambition as far as Indonesia is concerned, and that<br />
is that we should bc good neighbours and friendly neighbou rs and<br />
live in peace and occasionally make some contribution to the<br />
much-needed economic improvement of that country.<br />
Further north there is Malaysia and at this very<br />
Smoment, Indonesia, through the head of its government, breathes<br />
threatenings and slaughter against Malaysia. The world can't<br />
be indifferent to this state of affairs becausu let me remind<br />
everybody, if you need to be reminded Malaysia is a country<br />
which has grown out of Malaya. has grown out of the British colony<br />
of Malaya and the British colonies in Borneo Sabah in the north<br />
and Sarawak farther south. This fcrr of government, this national<br />
entity Malaysia, represents one of the frequent triumphs of<br />
British policy in this century, for Britain, the greatest colonial<br />
power in the nineteenth century, has been the greatest decolonising<br />
power since the Second World lWar.<br />
Malaya represents the classical example of how a colony<br />
achieves its independence and self-government, with reasonably<br />
trained people to take a hand in the administration with a<br />
healthy economy. Mclaya is a museum piece, except that it is<br />
very much alive in this field and now, of course voluntarily<br />
as the United Nations has found the two Borneo Territories<br />
and Singapore have been added and we have Mlaysiao Malaysia,<br />
a member of the United Nations,.... Malaysia which, being<br />
challenged to the validity of its creation, persuaded the<br />
* Secretary-General of the United Nations to send a mission and<br />
to make an investigation and to make a report,... Malaysia<br />
enjoying a guarantee from Great Britain of her military security<br />
against military aggression,.... Malaysia, enjoying a guarantee<br />
given by Australia, through my own mouth in the Australian<br />
Parliament, that should there be attempts made to overthrow<br />
her independence or her integrity, we will ourselves come to the<br />
assistance of Great Britain in her defence.<br />
Now, these are very large, very large matters and I<br />
sometimes wonder whether people understand them or what it is<br />
all about. Why shouldn't Malaysia be free and independent, just<br />
as much as Indonesia? Why shouldn't she? Why should we have<br />
to listen to all these silly words like " neo-colonialism" which<br />
is the last invention of the polysyllabic attackers of the world?<br />
Neo-colonialism: Here is ialaysia, an independent country, free, entitled<br />
to be free, entitled to all the protection that can be given by<br />
the United Nations and the United Nations Charter, and yet every<br />
few weeks you read that another threat is made, that a few more<br />
troops are put in across the border, that there is an infiltration<br />
that goes on and orn and threats to " crush" Malaysia. a * of. e/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Malaysia has made no threats against Indonesia none<br />
at all. The only threatening party, I regret to say, is Indonesia<br />
itself. And in that state of affairs and this is the real point<br />
I want to put to you in that state of affairs, you will constantly<br />
find pressures for more and more conferences.<br />
Might I with great submission offer a slight warning<br />
about conferences? I know that a ccnference every now and again<br />
is vital tremendously important. I know that many of the<br />
procedures of the United Nations represents a high form of<br />
conference between nations. I know that every now and then some<br />
great nations will induce a conference between two squaobling<br />
nations in order to see whether it cannot lend its good offices<br />
in producing a settlement, Cyprus is a recent example.<br />
But when energies are diverted to bring t', o nations<br />
together in conference over a matter like Malaysia, I just want<br />
to say to you, that unless there is the utmost good iaith on both<br />
sides, then that conference will hurt one and help the other<br />
that such a corference may turn out to be, in itself, an appeasing<br />
process which gi" es an advantage to the aggressor.<br />
Now I know that it was no less a man than the great<br />
Winston Churchill himself who said in that homely and splendid<br />
fashion of his: " It's better to jaw-. jaw, than war-war." And a<br />
lot of us have seized on this. All I wan-to say to you is that<br />
remark did not mean that Winston thou ht that undrr all circumstances,<br />
" jaw-jaw" should prevail, because if he had, all the views<br />
I uier heard expressed by him in relation to the pre--rnr years<br />
would be falified. Now what happens? There is a conference about Malaysia.<br />
Tunku Abdul Rahman, a splendid man with no trreat against<br />
Indonesia but with a vital interest to defend his own frontiers and<br />
the freedom of his oTn States, goes to a conference. The Tunku<br />
says: " Well, iirst of all, I won't go unless I have some assurance<br />
that your infiltration into my country with arms with forces<br />
regular ana irregular, is going to come to an en nd ndthat there<br />
is a formula devised for a phased withdrawal when the political<br />
conference begihs." And then somebody is bound to heave a sigh<br />
of relief and say: " WJel isn't this good? We have now got them<br />
coming into conference and this is it."<br />
But what happens when the conference goes on? Does<br />
anybody here really believe that Indonesian forces are not still<br />
finding their way into Borneo? Does anybody really believe that<br />
any withdrawal that might have occurred is more than merely<br />
nominal here or here or here? Does anybody doubt<br />
that on this matter time runs against the Tunku and that time<br />
runs against Malaysia? If the aggressor can have his way across<br />
the frontier, then of course the morale of the local people<br />
begins to suffer and the whole conception of Malaysia may find<br />
itself weakened. Now that doesn't mean that you want to go and become<br />
involved in a war. It is ridiculous to think of anybody being at<br />
war with Indonesia a country not under threat and whose orderly<br />
development everybody is willing to assist. But it does mean that<br />
before we put too much pressure on Malaysia to concede something<br />
here or there, or go into an unconditional conference, we ought<br />
to remember that there are conferences and conferences, some<br />
capable of altering the whole history of the world for the better<br />
and some regarded as a mere cover for further advance and further<br />
attack by one of the parties to the conference. 000 0 </p>
<p>Now, I am afraid I perhaps haven't explained that to you<br />
very clearly. But the one thing that I find as I go around the<br />
world that really troubles me a little is that I think that we<br />
ere a bit disposed today to say: " ell, we want a quiet life and<br />
if we can just get people to talk to each other that will dispose<br />
of that problem for the next week or two." And frankly, except<br />
on cond. tions of the utmost good faith on both sides, I distrust<br />
such conferences. Then, of course, that's not the only place. We have South<br />
Vietnam in which we are very happy in a small way to be able to<br />
assist the United States in what I venture to describe as a " film,<br />
clear policy." I know there are people iho can tell you it is<br />
wrong, that it can't succeed, that the whole solution in this part<br />
of the world is as General de Gaulle would say " There must oe<br />
a po] litical solution." I venture to doubt it very much. I think<br />
that there must be a presentation of firmness, not of provocation,<br />
but of firmness, in relation to South Vietnam.<br />
All we want in this world today is some smashing victory<br />
by Communist Cnina ir South-Last Asia, some removal of the forces<br />
of freedom fiom this zone, and the whole history of the world will<br />
be altered. And whbt I permit myself to remember is that the<br />
whole history of Australia vill be altered.<br />
We must be together, we must be firm, we must not be<br />
provocative but above all, if I may say so, we don't want to be<br />
unduly misled by ideas that the pcifect answer in what was Indo-<br />
China the perfect answer in the whole area, including South<br />
Vietnam is a declaration of neutrality, A country that is<br />
neutral with more than 600,000,000 Chinese on its flanks and its<br />
friendr thousands of miles away, is not likely to remain neutral<br />
for very long.<br />
Now all these are matters of great argument,<br />
I am glad i am speaking after Governor Stevenson because<br />
he would no doubt take me apart on a great number of these matters,<br />
but I just wanted to take the opportunity of stating once more<br />
how identical cur interests are, of indicating to you one or two<br />
of the dangers of which I think we might beware in our joint<br />
enterprise, and to conclude by saying, as I began, that whichever<br />
way it goes, my little country, and your great country, will be<br />
together through thick and thin. </p>
