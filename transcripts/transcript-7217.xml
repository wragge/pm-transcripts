    <content><![CDATA[<p>4 September 1987</p>
<p> I will make an official visit to New Zealand from 19-23 November at the invitation of New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr David Lange.</p>
<p> I welcome the opportunity for discussions with the recently re-elected Labour Government in New Zealand. I am looking forward to visiting at a time when economic co-operation between our two countries under the Close Economic Relations Agreement is taking on an even greater importance. The time is now right for further consideration of the agreement to try and find ways of furthering the already close economic co-operation between Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p> I will hold official talks with Prime Minister Lange and members of his Government in Wellington on Friday 19 November and will spend 20 and 21 November out of Wellington for informal talks with Mr Lange. As well as economic issues, the discussions will include consideration of other aspects of Australian/ New Zealand bilateral relations, as well as regional and global economic and political issues.  </p>
