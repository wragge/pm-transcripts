MAJOR PROJECTS TO ASSIST THE EXPORT TRADE<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr. McEwven).<br />
The Acting Prime Minister today said that the decision<br />
by the Commonwealth to discuss with State Governments the plannil<br />
of largo-scale developmental vorks, was an important stop in a<br />
programme designed to assist in the expansion of Australia's<br />
export trade. He vas referring to the announcement by the Prime<br />
Minister that the Gove-nment had under particular and<br />
sympathetic consideration large ontcrpriscs such as road<br />
development in the North; improved port and loading facilities<br />
to assist the coal export trade; standardization of the rail<br />
links in South Australia and . cstcrn , ustralia; and proposals to<br />
stimulate the discovery of oil and minerals generally.<br />
Mr. McEwen-rrcallcd the twin objectives of the<br />
Government in its current policies-were to put. abhrake on<br />
inflation and, at the same time, place a new sense of urgncy-on---<br />
policies aimed at the substantial expansion of export earnings.<br />
^ s one important step towards avoiding recurring<br />
balance of payments difficulties, it is the Government's aim to<br />
give the national development effort a pronounced bent towards<br />
the expansion of our export trade.<br />
Against this background the Government has considered<br />
certain problems associated with the expansion of exports of<br />
beef, minerals, coal and steel, all of which are important<br />
commodities in any long-range plan to increase total exports.<br />
Large-scale developments will be needed to exploit the full<br />
-export potential of these industries in which the investment of<br />
the private capital needed to increase production for export is<br />
dependent to a very important degree on the provision of largescale<br />
public works.<br />
In this field the Commonwealth is prepared, where<br />
necessary, to devise special financial arrangements to encourage<br />
projects on rhich export expansion depends, especially when the<br />
projects are of such size as to place them beyond the resources<br />
of a single State.<br />
The Prime Minister announced that the Government would<br />
discuss road development in the North with the appropriate<br />
Governments. The Commonwealth has had the benefit of surveys and<br />
advice on this particular issue. These suggest that road<br />
developments in this area could trigger-off an expansion of<br />
private investment in the beef industry and give an important<br />
stimulus to the beef exports. Additional exports of Å 15m./Å 20m.<br />
are in prospect from this industry and the first results could<br />
be-obtained within. very--few-years<br />
There were very good prospects that coal exports -could<br />
earn upwards of Å 10m. a year by 1965 if the inadequacy of coal-</p>
<p>2.<br />
loading and berthing facilities in the jor export ports is<br />
remedied. We were competing for business in Japan against<br />
countries which had highly mechanized and extremely modern loadirg<br />
facilities on berths which could accommodate the very large ore<br />
carriers which Japanese buyers plan to use for coal transportation.<br />
State Governments and the industry are giving<br />
attention to this problem. The Commonwealth proposes to discuss<br />
rith the State Authority whether some assistance from the<br />
Commonwealth may be necessary to enable these installations,<br />
which are so vital to the future of the coal export field, to be<br />
completed in time to enable the industry to renew the long-term<br />
contracts on which its export trade depends.<br />
In the Prime Minister's statement on thd 3rd January,<br />
he indicated that attention would be given to the special<br />
position of steel as an export carncr. Discussions had already<br />
taken place with the steelmakers and, at this stage, there<br />
appear excellent prospects of the steel industry making further<br />
very sizeable contributions to import savings and to export<br />
earnings within very few years. To do so, the industry will need<br />
to expand its production considerably and an integral part of its<br />
overall expansion plans is the development of an additional<br />
steelmaking centre in WJestern Australia. The industry has<br />
stated that the development of a steelmaking plant at Krinana is<br />
dependent on the standnrdization of the rail link between<br />
Kalgoorlie and the Coast.<br />
The Government has been asked to provide special<br />
assistance for the construction of this standard gauge line from<br />
Kalgoorlie and is considering this request, particularly in<br />
light of the benefits which this might bring to the expansion of<br />
steel and mineral exports.<br />
In addition to undertaking discussions with the Western<br />
Australian Government on the Kalgoorlic-Fremantle rail link, the<br />
Commonwealth is considering a request to assist in the<br />
standardization ( including the provision of modern rolling stock)<br />
of the Broken Hill/ Port Pirie rail link. Mr. McEven said that<br />
the freight economies which would be expected to flow from the<br />
standardization and dieselization of this line could assist the<br />
Broken Hill producers to compete more effectively on<br />
increasingly competitive world markets.<br />
The Prime Minister had stated that the Commonwealth<br />
will proceed with discussions with State Governments on the<br />
planning of such selected projects. Although no substantial<br />
funds can be provided from the Treasury in the near future, the<br />
Government is nevertheless convinced that some projects of<br />
economic development, especially those vhich will make an<br />
important contribution to our export capabilities, should proceed<br />
as soon as the economic situation permits.<br />
By planning now, the way should be clear in 1962 for<br />
such projects to proceed as would substantially assist to expand<br />
our export earnings. </p>
<p>Mr. clc67v sid tht these importarnt decisions yore<br />
