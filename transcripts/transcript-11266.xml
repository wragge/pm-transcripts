    <content><![CDATA[<p> I have today sent the following message of condolence to the</p>
<p> Honourable Donald Kalpokas, Prime Minister of Vanuatu, on the death</p>
<p> of Father Walter Lini. Australia will be represented at his funeral</p>
<p> tomorrow morning by the Speaker, the Hon. Neil Andrew, MP:</p>
<p>The Hon. Donald Kalpokas Masike-vanua</p>
<p>Prime Minister</p>
<p>REPUBLIC OF VANUATU</p>
<p>My dear Prime Minister</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I wish to express</p>
<p> my deepest sympathy to Mrs Mary Lini and her family, and to the Government</p>
<p> and people of Vanuatu, on the death of Father Walter Lini in Port</p>
<p> Vila early this morning.</p>
<p>Father Lini led a distinguished career in the service of his people,</p>
<p> of his country and of the South Pacific region. He steered Vanuatu</p>
<p> to its independence in 1980 and served as the Republic's first</p>
<p> prime minister until 1991. He was known affectionately as the "Father</p>
<p> of Independence" throughout Vanuatu. Until his death he continued</p>
<p> as an active member of the Vanuatu Parliament and in the service of</p>
<p> his home community on Pentecost island.</p>
<p>Committed to his country, he was also a major figure in the South</p>
<p> Pacific region and made an important contribution to the region's</p>
<p> development.</p>
<p>Successive Australian Governments enjoyed a close and productive relationship</p>
<p> with Father Walter Lini and part of his legacy is a strong and healthy</p>
<p> partnership with Australia.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p> (John Howard)</p>
<p> 21 February 1999</p>
