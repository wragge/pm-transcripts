EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
FOR PRESS 9 MARCH 1978<br />
ADDRESS AT PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR<br />
THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
Your Excellency, on behalf of the Australian people may I offer<br />
the warmest welcome to our country. We are delighted and<br />
honoured to have you and your wife in Australia.<br />
Australia and Papua New Guinea are not just neighbours, but countries<br />
which have formed the closest links,-at all levels.<br />
Today, Australians are very much aware of the links between our<br />
Governments. They know and * understand that this relationship<br />
is a close and strong one. But the relationship between Australia<br />
and Papua New Guinea has a special quality and that is the<br />
bond based simply on the friendship between people. It is on<br />
this friendship, this closeness that the foundation of our<br />
total relationship is based, and surely it is the friendship<br />
between people that is -the measurement of the real depth and<br />
worth of any relationship.<br />
Your visit to Australia, Your Excellency, reminds us of the<br />
relationship we have on a government-to-government level.<br />
Before your visit is completed, I am sure you will also see at<br />
first hand how Australians express warmth and-goodwill to our<br />
friends from Papua New Guinea.<br />
Your Excellency, just over 12 months ago, my wife and I were<br />
privileged to visit your country. At a dinner for your<br />
Prime Minister I referred to the relationship between developed and<br />
developing nations and the economic gap between rich and poor<br />
countries. Michael Somare and I agreed that the need to bridge<br />
the gap between developed and developing nations was most pressing.<br />
Today, that need is stronger than ever before.<br />
Access to the great markets of the developed work is a critical<br />
and central problem now facing the governments of every developing<br />
country. The major developed countries have a responsibilityand<br />
an obligation ' to open up markets for commodities.<br />
Until that happens, how can there be equality of opportunity<br />
for developing countries. Australia is concerned that a Common<br />
Fund comes into operation as soon as practicable. We have long<br />
supported the idea of commodity agree6ments*' to provide'-exporters<br />
with reliable markets and importers with secure supplies, at<br />
prices which are fair and equitable to both. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Surely that is not too much to ask in a world where a third<br />
of its people have an average income of less than $ 200 a year.<br />
I know that Papua New Guinea has had particular problems in<br />
gaining access for somie primary and processed products in the<br />
developed world, an-! has been adversely affected by instability<br />
in international commodity trade.<br />
Australia too has had similar problems, particularly as a res-ult<br />
of the restrictions placed on trade in some commodities<br />
by the major industrialised countries. In the coming<br />
months a series of meetings the M. T. N. in Geneva, and<br />
Common Fund discussicns with Commonwealth Ministers and within<br />
UNCTAD will be crucial to a dilemma that fa;: ei the developed and<br />
developing world. It is vital that fair and reasonable<br />
solutions are found to the problem of greater access to markets.<br />
Your Excellency, at the Commonwealth Regional Meeting Papua<br />
New Guinea not surprisingly made a most practical contribution<br />
to debate ofi the problems facing the developed and developing nation..<br />
Papua New Guinea was able to do just this because of practical<br />
experience in tackling the problems of organising development<br />
at a village level.<br />
Your Prime Minister emphasised the need for greater efforts<br />
towards self reliance in developing countries. This theme<br />
was endorsed by other leaders and was reflected in the Communique.<br />
Papua New Guinea also outlined its distinctive experience in aid<br />
matters. I know that Michael Somare is convinced that there is a need for donor<br />
countries to provide assistance to developing countries in ways<br />
that will avoid adding to the debt burden. Australia has a<br />
long-standing commitment to extend our aid to developing countries<br />
in grant form. Clearly, if all the developed countries had<br />
followed the lead provided by the Australia/ Papua New Guinea<br />
relationship, the enormous third world debt burden would not<br />
have emerged. If our lead were followed now, the magnitude<br />
of the debt problem would be greatly reduced.<br />
Your Excellency in a world beset by many problems where<br />
conflict and tension, remain our relationship is proof that two<br />
nations of vastly different backgrounds can work and live<br />
togrether as friends. That we can achieve this without dampening<br />
one another's personal identity and aspirations is further evidence<br />
of our special friendship.<br />
Your Excellency, on behalf of everyone in this room today may I<br />
again welcome you and your wife to Australia. Your visit<br />
is the first official visit by a Papua New Guinean Governor-General<br />
to Australia. We are privileged to have you~ with us. We hope<br />
you will return. </p>
