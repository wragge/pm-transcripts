TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL<br />
SHILDBERGER, SUNDAY NATIONAL RADIO, 2 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
SHILDBERGER: Prime Minister, thank you firstly for your<br />
time.<br />
PM: Michael, it's a pleasure as always to be with you.<br />
SHILDBERGER: The problems of Papua New Guinea are<br />
obviously causing you concern.<br />
PM: Well just before I go to those problems, I mean I<br />
don't know whether you were going to give me any other<br />
peg upon which I could hang this but I understand,<br />
Michael, this is 35 years for you now in the public arena<br />
and in broadcasting and I just simply want to say this to<br />
you, Michael, that while it's not the best kept State<br />
secret that we've had a few arguments and moments I just<br />
want to say that I think that the most important task in<br />
this great country of ours is to get Australian people<br />
thinking about issues, discussing issues, debating them,<br />
not of course always having all of us thinking exactly<br />
the same thing. But the important thing is that as a<br />
community we value democracy, don't take it for granted<br />
and have discussions and debate. You have for 35 years<br />
played a very important role in performing just that<br />
function. I congratulate you for it and I thank you for<br />
it and I wish you well in the future.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Oh, thank you very much for that. In fact<br />
I'd like to come back to that because I want to do a<br />
little reminiscing with you. But at the moment well as<br />
we record this you're heading of f very shortly to New<br />
Guinea and I was really wondering just how much concern<br />
that part of the world is to you at the moment.<br />
PM: It obviously looms significant in our thinking. For<br />
a number of reasons. It's one of our very closest<br />
neighbours. We're closer to it than to any other nation.<br />
We also have a particular responsibility because of the<br />
ex-colonial relationship and therefore we have a very<br />
great interest in seeing that we can do what we can,<br />
acknowledging their sovereign independence, do what we<br />
can to put them in a position to handle what are a.<br />
significant range of problems. </p>
<p>SHILDBERGER: Well there are a few. Economic is one, I<br />
suppose Bougainville which is partly economic but<br />
there's also another serious one.<br />
PM: Yes, Bougainville has represented for them a very<br />
significant source of income into their budget and their<br />
export earnings and that is now, we hope temporarily,<br />
lost to them. But as you say, it's not merely an<br />
economic dimension it is a reflection of the fact that<br />
not enough people recognise when they are talking about<br />
Papua New Guinea and it's this; that as distinct from<br />
most other ex-colonial entities there was no natural<br />
ethnic or geographical qualities about that area and that<br />
entity which made nation building easier. The new<br />
leaders of this new nation have had to engage more than<br />
many in the actual process of building the nation and the<br />
concept of a nation. That has been a very real problem<br />
and Bougainville is, in a sense, to be seen in that<br />
light. SHILDBERGER: There are those of course who will say that<br />
perhaps Australia should have played more of a role.<br />
PM: There will always be some who would say that but of<br />
course those who say it will not spell out the assumption<br />
which is implicit in that assertion. The assumption in<br />
that is that Papua New Guinea in some sense still is a<br />
colonial dependency that we can tell Papua New Guinea<br />
what to do and intrude, well that's not the case. We are<br />
there to discuss these issues with Papua New Guinea to<br />
the extent they want to discuss them with us, to help<br />
them to the extent we can and it's appropriate to do so.<br />
But the realities are, as I say, that Papua New Guinea is<br />
a sovereign independent nation with both the wish and the<br />
responsibility to deal with its own affairs.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Do you think when you get there you'll be<br />
asked for more money, maybe troops?<br />
PM: No I don't think so.<br />
SHILDBERGER: And you're not going there prepared for<br />
that? PM: Well I always go prepared to listen to whatever my<br />
hosts want to raise with me and discuss with me.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Moving from that part of the world to the<br />
Gulf. How worried are you?<br />
PM: As an intelligent person I'm obviously very worried<br />
about what's happening there. The paradox of course of<br />
this period in which we live is that for the first time<br />
in the post war nuclear age we have as a world the better<br />
basis now than ever before of looking to the opportunity<br />
of a world living at peace free from the possibility of<br />
super power conflict. But just as we've reached that<br />
world, that new world of opportunity, there is a </p>
<p>corresponding obligation on the world community to make<br />
it clear that certain basic norms of conduct between<br />
nations must be respected. One of those of course is<br />
-that the naked use of aggression and attempt to subjugate<br />
a neighbour is not acceptable and therefore when that has<br />
happened we must be terribly concerned about that and<br />
when you have added to that fact the horrendous practice<br />
of using hostages as human shields against possible<br />
targets this sort of thing must give any intelligent<br />
person cause for concern.<br />
SHILDBERGER: always sort of watched that particular<br />
part of the world very closely. If in the present<br />
scenario the best happened and Iraq chose to withdraw<br />
again from Kuwait, it's not necessarily over though is<br />
it? I mean what would be likely to be the US role do you<br />
think? PM: Well the role of the United States is always a<br />
difficult one in that region because they are wanted by<br />
some and not by others to have a presence or an influence<br />
and that's always difficult for a super power like that<br />
to handle that situation in a way which is generally<br />
acceptable. But<br />
SHILDBERGER: Do you think it would be likely that they'd<br />
stay?<br />
PM: Not in any sense in the presence they've got now. I<br />
think one should say this in regard to a possible<br />
withdrawal and I think Saddam Hussein should understand<br />
this that if he withdraws as he must I mean there are<br />
certain things that are non-negotiable, that is he must<br />
withdraw from Iraq and he must release all hostages.<br />
Those things are not negotiable<br />
SHILDBERGER: From Kuwait.<br />
PM: Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait and he must release<br />
all hostages. That is not negotiable. Now, I think he<br />
should understand that if he does those things, then if<br />
he believes, if he believes that he's got some legitimate<br />
grievance, territorial or otherwise, against Kuwait, then<br />
there should a facilitation of them to have those matters<br />
considered by the International Court of Justice. There<br />
are peaceful norms and peaceful machinery which enable<br />
disputes between nations to be considered.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Right. From that, let's get to the economy<br />
of this country. Ken Davidson of The Age says that Paul<br />
Keating in his deregulation, are responsible for many of<br />
our economic problems like in Victoria and the state of<br />
some of our financial institutions. What's your comment<br />
about that?<br />
PM: Well as you know, neither I nor Paul regard Ken<br />
Davidson as an objective observer on the situation in<br />
Victoria or as far as this Government is concerned. I </p>
<p>mean, Ken Davidson I don't want to get into a<br />
personalised you know, attack on him but I think it is<br />
a matter of record, as Ken himself would agree, that<br />
historically he's been essentially a-supporter of what<br />
was the Keynesean type approach of the Victorian<br />
Government in earlier years of which we are now seeing an<br />
unacceptable outfall. Now having had that position in<br />
the past, I don't think it's likely that Ken is going to<br />
be a thoroughly objective observer of the present.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Well put his views aside for the moment.<br />
What about deregulation in general? Have we perhaps gone<br />
too quickly?<br />
PM: Paul Keating made the obvious answer to this point,<br />
Michael, when he said it was not deregulation which has<br />
caused the problems in Victoria. It was the absence of<br />
proper supervision. As Paul said in the banking sector<br />
where there is appropriate supervision by the Reserve<br />
S Bank, then there hasn't been these failures. The<br />
supervision of State Banks and State non-bank financial<br />
institutions is the responsibility of State Governments.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Was your virtual lack of support for John<br />
Cain, do you think, the final straw?<br />
PM: No I don't think that's fair to say the lack of<br />
support. I made the observation which was appropriate<br />
and that is that the matter of State leadership is a<br />
matter for the States. I said that in Western Australia.<br />
I said it in Victoria. I didn't regard it as appropriate<br />
for me to say John must stay, John must go. It was a<br />
matter for decision by the State and within the State and<br />
in the end John made the decision himself.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Now the Budget indicates that demand can<br />
still afford to slow before any sort of reverse action<br />
needs to be taken. Are you concerned perhaps that the<br />
S figures are too slow before they get to you, that you<br />
might sort of act too late?<br />
PM: You've always got to be careful in this but let me<br />
make this point about it, Michael. We don't simply rely<br />
on the official statistics those of the Statistician<br />
which can have that lagged affect to which you properly<br />
refer. These things are happening. The people in my own<br />
Department, the people in Treasury are constantly in<br />
contact with the business community, having their finger<br />
on the pulse of what's happening. Let me say this, that<br />
when I became Prime Minister in 1983 I said then that<br />
and, you know, we were in the depth of the worst<br />
recession in 50 years at that time and I said to my<br />
people I'm not going to wait just on the official<br />
statistics to get some feel of when the economy's on the<br />
move. I think it's a reasonably well known fact that Sir<br />
Peter Abeles is a friend of mine, I've never tried to<br />
disguise that. Now he heads up the biggest transport<br />
company in this country. I asked Peter when I came to </p>
<p>power just to let me know what was happening in his area<br />
of transport because transport in any country, and in a<br />
sense particularly in this country, is a very good<br />
indicator of what's happening to the economy and I can<br />
say that those indications came through ahead of the<br />
official statistics. So I'm simply making the point that<br />
SHILDBERGER: Are you still keeping that sort of contact<br />
and asking those sort of questions?<br />
PM: Yes and not simply there but I mean I make the point<br />
that the bureaucrats in the Treasury and in the Prime<br />
Minister's Department, the Department of John Button's<br />
Department of Industry and Commerce, they are constantly<br />
in contact with the wide range of leaders in the business<br />
community. So we're not just the captive of the lagged<br />
official statistics.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Many businesses are going broke now though<br />
aren't they?<br />
PM: Yes and many businesses are not. I mean and I<br />
don't mean to sound heartless in making that comment.<br />
Yes, the fact is that we had in this country an<br />
unacceptably high level of activity which was sucking in<br />
a level of imports which we simply could not sustain. So<br />
therefore there had to be tight monetary policies, there<br />
had to be tight fiscal policies and tight wages policies.<br />
Now when you tighten the arms of policy it is inevitable<br />
that some businesses are going to collapse.<br />
SHILDBERGER: If you're watching regularly as obviously<br />
you are can you finger a time or can you think towards<br />
a time now that you're going to say right now we ' ye got<br />
to change policy of putting budgets aside or<br />
PM: That assumes that we haven't. The fact is that in<br />
this year, 1990, we have on 4 occasions eased monetary<br />
policy. We've eased it by 4 points, by 4 percentage<br />
points. So during 1990 we have not sat on our hands. We<br />
have successfully eased policy. Now our position will be<br />
that we will continue to monitor what happens and at that<br />
point where we think there can be a further easing and<br />
only when we think it can be done we'll do it again.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Right. Now looking at the economic<br />
problems as well and that is the ACTU hit-list at the<br />
moment. Do you support what Martin Ferguson is doing,<br />
that he's going out to employers because he says they<br />
haven't been doing the right thing?<br />
PM: I answer that question by these prefatory remarks.<br />
The trade union movement of this country has exhibited an<br />
unparalleled degree of restraint over the period of this<br />
Government which has meant that non-farm real unit labour<br />
costs have fallen by 10-1/ 2 percentage points, which has<br />
been associated with a massive move from wages to </p>
<p>profits, which has allowed historically high levels of<br />
investment. That only happened because of the enormous<br />
restraint which has been exercised by the trade union<br />
movement. I can-understand, against that historical<br />
background, the concern that the trade union leadership<br />
must have about what appears to be the lack of<br />
recognition by sections of the business community of the<br />
enormity of that restraint. The problems it's created<br />
for the ACTU leadership within its own ranks and also may<br />
I say that this restraint, this enormous restraint which<br />
has been exercised by the trade union movement has not<br />
been reflected in the behaviour of the executives of the<br />
business community who, while the trade union movement<br />
have been exercising massive restraint involving a<br />
massive move from wages to profits, business executives<br />
have engaged and indulged in a massive increase in their<br />
personal remuneration. That of itself has created<br />
enormous problems. So I am not surprised that there is a<br />
degree of frustration. The next point I make is<br />
important as the previous one but it's important in<br />
regard to the national economic outcomes that the ACTU<br />
remains committed to the undertaking they have given of a<br />
7% aggregate national wages outcome during this financial<br />
year, and that is the important consideration.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Is it right in saying it won't go before<br />
the Industrial Relations Commission?<br />
PM: Well at this stage that seems to be their attitude.<br />
That's something that they have to work out. As far as<br />
the Government is concerned, our fundamental concern is<br />
that they keep their commitment of acting in a way which<br />
means a no more than 7% national wages aggregate outcome.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Would you prefer them to go before the<br />
Commission? PM: I, by nature, tend to prefer to have these things<br />
settled in a more consensual way. I mean that's my<br />
nature. I can't emphasise enough the important thing for<br />
the community is that the trade union movement adheres to<br />
that commitment about a 7% no more than 7% aggregate<br />
outcome. SHILDBERGER: But do you support therefore the ACTU and<br />
Martin Ferguson who says that the employers haven't been<br />
doing the right thing?<br />
PM: I've already said that I think that the employers<br />
have been less than totally responsible, sections of them<br />
have been less than totally responsible in terms of<br />
understanding just what the trade union movement has done<br />
over recent years.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Right. Let's get onto a bit of reminiscing<br />
briefly. As you kindly referred to the fact it's<br />
years when I started as a copy boy at the Melbourne Sun.<br />
What were you doing in 1955? </p>
<p>PM: 1955 I was at the University of Oxford enjoying one<br />
of the most pleasurable periods of my life.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Now you spent a bit of time in New Guinea,<br />
where you are now returning<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
SHILDBERGER: And I gather a little bird told me this<br />
that that's where you really got the interest in punting?<br />
PM: Yes it is. Before then I not only had no interest<br />
in the horses I had a positive detestation of racing<br />
because, as you know, I'm a sports fanatic and I used to<br />
find it upsetting in the extreme that I'd be listening to<br />
the cricket or the football and they'd say now we go to<br />
the races and there would be this monstrous interruption.<br />
But I had when I went up there I was sort of acting as<br />
the barrister, as it were, leading the case in this local<br />
officers case which took me all over Papua New Guinea and<br />
I had as my junior, as it were, Paul Munro, who is now on<br />
the Industrial Relations Commission, I might say. Paul<br />
and I very quickly developed a close personal<br />
relationship but it used to break down come Friday when<br />
he immersed himself in the mainland papers, the racing<br />
section and getting his bets on for Saturday. Now one<br />
day I was going over to see now I must be careful here<br />
I can't name names because it would be obvious but I<br />
was going to see a newspaper person who, if I could put<br />
it gently, supplemented his income by sort of running a<br />
book, as it were, a particular sort of book. Paul had<br />
made an investment, I remember it was the Newcastle Cup<br />
that was coming up. I was going over to see this fellow<br />
about the case and I wanted to put some facts to him that<br />
I'd hoped would get sympathetically reported. So Paul<br />
said to me oh look, he said, I've put this money I want<br />
to change my investment. Would you do that for me? He<br />
had to write it down because I didn't know what he was<br />
talking about really. I said yes I'll do that. So I<br />
went over and saw this person and I said give me a look<br />
at it. Have you got a form guide there? And the fellow<br />
said yes, and knowing absolutely nothing about it I had a<br />
look through it and with infinitely more luck than good<br />
management or insight I picked out one and said well I'll<br />
have a certain amount on it. Well needless to say as the<br />
story unfolds, my beginners luck paid off. I was hooked.<br />
So it started.<br />
SHILDBERGER: I believe there might have been the odd<br />
glass of alcohol to be consumed at the time too.<br />
PM: Yes in those days, when forced, I reluctantly had a<br />
drop or two, yes. There was some associated with this<br />
pleasurable past time. </p>
<p>SHILDBERGER: I've got to say something else here though.<br />
I mean I did get to know the Bob Hawke of yester-year<br />
pretty well.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
SHILDBERGER: He's changed now though, hasn't he?<br />
PM: Well he'd be a bloody fool if he hadn't.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Well he's changed because of the grog, OK.<br />
PM: But not only because of the grog. I mean an<br />
intelligent person must change through life. I mean if<br />
you want a sign of stupidity, show me a man at 60 who's<br />
the same as he was at<br />
SHILDBERGER: Is there more to the Bob Hawke now though<br />
where he's become in perception as much as anything and<br />
perhaps more aggressive, perhaps even more rude?<br />
PM: That I've become more aggressive now? Oh, that's<br />
impossible. No, I'm just a shadow of the aggression of<br />
yester-year.<br />
SHILDBERGER: The fuse isn't a bit shorter?<br />
PM: Oh no, it's lengthened to the point almost of nonrecognition.<br />
SHILDBERGER: There are rumours that you're back on the<br />
grog. Is there any truth?<br />
PM: Gee, you'd want to be careful on that one. I will<br />
retire in very considerable opulence. There is not a<br />
skerrick of truth and if you could produce any evidence<br />
of anyone saying that, please let well you say there<br />
are rumours.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Oh yes, just people sort of speculate,<br />
that's all. I've got no evidence at all.<br />
PM: No, what I'm saying is I'd be indebted if you would<br />
indicate to me any person that said it. I mean I hope<br />
this is not just something you've conjured up. I mean if<br />
you say this you've obviously heard someone say it.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Yes.<br />
PM: You have?<br />
SHILDBERGER: But with absolutely no evidence.<br />
PM: No, no, no.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Pure speculation. </p>
<p>PM: No, no. But I would be indebted if you would at<br />
some time convey to me anyone who said that that's<br />
happened-SHI LDBERGER: Right.<br />
PM: Because I will take them to the bloody cleaners.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Good. Good to hear it. Your emotions.<br />
You laugh, you cry<br />
PM: Sure I do.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Do you regret any of that?<br />
PM: No. I'm made the way I am. One of the most futile<br />
things I've witnessed in life is people saying I wished I<br />
was like that or I wished I ' Was like something else or I<br />
wish I wasn't like this. You are what you are. What you<br />
ought to do is to try and maximise what you've got. The<br />
most futile thing in life is to spend time trying to<br />
concern yourself about things you can't change. I have a<br />
particular make-up. At times it would've been obviously<br />
less embarrassing for me if I wasn't made the way I am.<br />
But if I've got to sit down and do a balance sheet of my<br />
make-up I think I'll settle for what I've got.<br />
SHILDBERGER: How long do you give yourself after the<br />
next election before you step aside?<br />
PM: I don't know. I haven't really thought about that.<br />
My commitment is to go to the next election.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Have you decided what you'll do when you<br />
step aside?<br />
PM: I've thought about it and I've publicly said it.<br />
One of the things I really want to do is to do a series<br />
of interviews with people that I've had the great good<br />
fortune to meet over the years in this job. I have been<br />
enlarged and enriched as a human being through meeting a<br />
number of these people. But not only have I been<br />
enlarged and enriched personally but I think in various<br />
ways they've had a significant influence on things that<br />
have happened in the world and I would like the<br />
opportunity of doing a series of interviews with these<br />
people and I imagine that a lot of people would be<br />
interested in that experience. There has been some<br />
evidence that people in the television industry think<br />
it's a good idea so I would like to do that at some<br />
stage. SHILDBERGER: A couple of quick ones. How do you regard<br />
John Hewson as an opponent?<br />
PM: I like to conduct my political affairs as far as I<br />
can in a way which doesn't involve an attack on the<br />
personality of my opponent. I like to deal with the </p>
<p>issues and I must say that one of the things about John<br />
Hewson that worries me is that he looks as though he's<br />
falling between two stools, that he is a Professor of<br />
Economics and he has the capacities that ought to go with<br />
that experience. But in the way he's dealing in his<br />
analysis of matters economic, he looks as though he's<br />
come to the conclusion that he's got to almost be a<br />
gutter brawler, see what sort of level of abuse he can<br />
get to in regard to Keating. Now the fact is that he's<br />
not constitutionally made for that sort of role and I<br />
think he's going to fall between two stools there. Not<br />
being the analyst and there is room for that and<br />
attempting to be the tough sort of brawler type, he's not<br />
equipped for that. So if he continues doing that I<br />
mean he's having understandably a honeymoon run now. It<br />
was inevitable whoever followed at the end of the Howard-<br />
Peacock merry-go-round saga, whoever came after was going<br />
to be well received and he is being well received now. I<br />
recognise that. But in the months and the years ahead<br />
he's going to have to be judged in the light of how he<br />
does conduct his analysis, how he gives possible<br />
alternatives and my assessment at this stage is that he's<br />
not shaping up well in that respect.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Just finally, how's Paul Keating's<br />
Collingwood going to go in the finals?<br />
PM: Well I've got a lot of, you know, sympathy for<br />
Collingwood. It's one of the great sporting clubs of<br />
Australia. Standing off objectively, I'd have to say<br />
that Hawthorn if I were having a bet now, let's put it<br />
that way you'd have to say that the form that they are<br />
exhibiting at the moment, including that demolition of<br />
Collingwood, is, you know, points to them. Let me put it<br />
this way, one of those on my staff, who shall remain<br />
nameless and who has black and white eyes, has put it<br />
this way; that he just hopes that Hawthorn gets knocked<br />
off by one of the other finalists on the way through as<br />
Hawthorn's the only one that he's worried about.<br />
SHILDBERGER: Interesting. Bob Hawke, Prime Minister,<br />
thank you very much for your time.<br />
PM: Thanks Michael, it's been a pleasure.<br />
