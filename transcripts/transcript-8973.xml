STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATINC, MP<br />
AUDIENCE WITH TILE QUEEN<br />
I was received in audience by Her Majesty the Queen a( Balmoral Castle on 18 September.<br />
There is a longstanding convention that the content of these conversations remain confidential<br />
But I am able to say I explained to Her Majesty that, notwithstanding the deep respect and warm<br />
affection felt towards her by the Australian people, there was a growing feeling that Australia<br />
should make the necessary constitutional changes to allow the appointment of an Australian Head<br />
of State. I said such a move was acen as necessary to establish clearly Australia's identity as an<br />
independent nation. I outlined to 1ecr Majesty the various steps that would be involved in such a<br />
process, including the need for a referendum to approve constitutional amendments. The<br />
Australian Governnment's view was that, it approved by the Australian people at a referendum, it<br />
would be appropnriate for Australia to become a republic by the centenary of Federation in 2001. I<br />
told Her Majesty that, in such a situation, Australia would remain a member of the<br />
Commonwealth of Nations, and that the Australian people would warmly welcome visit-to<br />
Australia by Her Majesty as Head of the Commonwealth and as the Queen of the United<br />
Kingdom. Her Majesty authorised me to say that she would, of course, act on the advice of her Australian<br />
Ministers, as she always has, and on any decision made by the Australian people.<br />
