INL) 16N OCEAN AND AROUND IT! 7 HAS. DEPLORED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN<br />
i'NCRE4SE IN FORCES BY . THE TWO SUPER POWERS THE UNITED STATES AND<br />
THE SOVIET UNION, THEY HAVE ALL SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE ANY POSSIBILITY<br />
OF CONFROINTATION BETWEEN THEM, SOYIE OF YOU MIGHTN'T BE AWARE THAT<br />
IASASKED A QUESTION PREVIOUSLY ON THIS BY AN AUSTRALIAN CORRFSPOfJENT<br />
WHO WOULD HAVE HAD THE TFXT. BUT, OF COURSE, THE CORRESPO'NDENT<br />
WHO JUST A3KED THIS QUFSTION-AND OTHERS TOO MIGHT NOT HAVE<br />
THE TEXT OF THE C0MMUtI'QUE WHICH MOR ' AOSYGIN AND I ISSUED YESTEot-<br />
L ON THIS SUBJECT. IT STATES ' BOTH SIDES EXPRESS THEIR READiNES3<br />

PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIO . NAL LAW.'<br />
9. DO YOU BELIEVE THE ASSURANCE.) GIVEN TO YOU BY MR KOSYGIN THAT<br />
RUSSIA DOES NOT HAVE ANY BASES IN THE INDIAN OCEAN?<br />
A M3 KOSYGIN DID STATE THAT AND I HAVE NO CO ' 1ENT TO MAKE ON IT*<br />
THIS MORNING YOU HAD A TALK WITH THE FEDERAL CHANCELLOR. DID<br />
YOU DISCUSS ECONOMIC PRO3LEMS AND PARTICULARLY THE QUESTION OF<br />
6USTRALIP'S SUPPLY OF URANIU111 TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY?<br />
A. THE BUNDESKANZLER AND I DISCUJSSED MANY ECONOMIC MATTERS.<br />
OB3VIOUSLY, GER-MNANY, 3.; ECONOMIC EXPERIENCE IS OF GSREAT SIGNIFICANCE<br />
TO0 6-NY 4ESTERN COUNTRY BECAUSE T) 11-FEDERAL REPU! 3LIC S SUCCESS HAS<br />
BEEN BY PAR THE GREATEST, ECONOMICALLY, OF ALL I-JESTERN COUNTRIES.<br />
WE DID DISCUISS THE SUPPLY OF URANIU1M TO EUROPEAN COUMTRIE3.<br />
ALSC, OF COURSE, I. E DISCUSSED THE ' SUPPLY OF BEEF TO EUROPEAN<br />
CU N TR I ES. WE DISCUSSED THE GENERAL QUESTION OF WHAT COMMODITIES. 1<br />
PRlr ARY AND YIINER. L. CAN BE SUPPLIED 3Y AUSTRPLIA TO EURO0PEAN COUiq-\\<br />
TRIES AOJD THE GENE RAL TERMS OF WHICH SUCH SUPPLIES COULD TAKE PLACE.<br />
THIS 14PS THE SEVENTH ViSIT THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE MADE TO<br />
MEMBER COUJNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMM~ UNITY. IN EACH CASIE<br />
IoE H,, VE FOUND SOME EMB RRASSMENT OVER THE FACT THAT THE COMrUNITY,<br />
SPURSUANT TO THE HAS CUT OFF IMPORT. S OF MEAT FROM AUSTRALIA.<br />
NOBODY HAS JUSTIFIED. THAT EXCLUSION OF AUSTRrL16N MFAT FRO', THE<br />
EUROPEAN MA. RKET, IT TS TRUE, WE HAVEN'T VISITED DENMARK AND LL: XEMBO0U<br />
RG WE DON'T KNOW THEIR VIEWS. IT IS POS3193LE THAT LUXEMBOURG<br />
t* ND D) ENMARK CONTROL THE C. A. PO IN EVERY COUNiTRY, HOWEVER, 1" 1E<br />
DID FIND A VERY GREAT -INTEREST IN THE SUPPLY OF URANIUM AND COAL<br />
BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY REQUIRES ENERGY SOURCES. AUSTRALIA HAS<br />
CONSIDERABLE ENERGY SOURCES. AUSTRALIANS. QUITE LEGITIMATELY I<br />
BELIEVE,'% INT TO DEVELOP THOSE ENERGY SOURCES A5" FAR AS POSSIBLE IN<br />
THEIR O' 4N COUNTRY. SO. QUI. TE CLEARLY, THS9E WERE MANY MATTERS THAT<br />
Y. E WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS: THE ! 3UNDESKANZLER AND I. WE DIDN'T GET<br />
