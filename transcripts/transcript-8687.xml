PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, 1NP<br />
AUSTRALIAN VIETNAM FORCES NATIONAL MEMORIAL DEDICATION<br />
CEREMONY I welcome you all to Canberra. I know that many of you<br />
have come hundreds of miles. And many years. Too many<br />
years. Today is a great day in the life of our country.<br />
This memorial will forever honour the Australians who<br />
fought and died in Vietnam. It honours all those who<br />
served.<br />
We honour them for the same reason we honour those<br />
previous generations of Australians who served in wars on<br />
foreign soil.<br />
For their sacrifice. For their faith.<br />
These Australians believed in their country as those<br />
earlier generations did. They believed in democracy and<br />
freedom, and by defending it in Vietnam they believed<br />
they were defending it everywhere.<br />
They believed in duty.<br />
They were brave.<br />
Those whose names are entombed in this memorial paid the<br />
ultimate price for their belief in Australia.<br />
It is true that no war divided Australia like the Vietnam<br />
War. It is true that often we remember those years more<br />
for the protests at home than for the fighting abroad.<br />
The years of Vietnam corresponded with a great social and<br />
political upheaval in Australia. The war was itself one<br />
of the catalysts of change.<br />
There is no doubt that in all the turmoil we lost sight<br />
of the reality of Vietnam. We lost sight of those who<br />
did the fighting, and the waiting. And by doing that we<br />
made their reality worse. </p>

For all the drama in the streets, and parliaments and<br />
public halls, the real war was, as always, on the<br />
battlefields where young men and women died.<br />
The real tragedy was in their suffering and death and, as<br />
ever, in the loss which lives on in the hearts and minds<br />
of those who loved them.<br />
We cannot make good this hurt any more than we can undo<br />
the war itself.<br />
But, by this memorial, we can make good the memory.<br />
It is the symbolic resting place of the 504 who died. It<br />
means that at last they will join the exalted ranks of<br />
Australians who died in other wars.<br />
It is a memorial to all the men and women who served in<br />
Vietnam. it is a memorial for all those for whom the war has meant<br />
suffering and lose. All those whose experience of<br />
Vietnam still haunts them. All those here today.<br />
We should recognise, therefore, that it is a memorial for<br />
all Australians; because, as a nation, we should all bear<br />
the burden.<br />
It is a great memorial.<br />
I hope it will be taken as a symbol of the,-nation's<br />
gratitude. I hope that it will remind us of our own duty, and that<br />
this and future generations will find in themselves the<br />
Same love of Australia, and the same faith in our future.<br />
And I hope it will remind us always that we live in a<br />
great country dedicated to freedom and peace.<br />
Thank you.<br />
CANBERRA 3 October 1992 </p>
