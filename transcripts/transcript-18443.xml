On behalf of the Australian Government and people of Australia, I extend my deepest condolences to the Tongan Government following the death of His Majesty King George Tupou V.</p>
<p>Our thoughts today are with the people of Tonga, including the large Tongan community living in Australia.</p>
<p>During his reign, King George guided his country through a critical process of constitutional change towards the establishment of a Constitutional monarchy, founded on democratic principles. </p>
<p>Tonga's first truly democratic elections, held in November 2010, set the country on a new course.</p>
<p>King George was a great friend of Australia, having last visited Australia in October 2010.</p>
<p>We enjoy a warm and close friendship with Tonga, supported by our aid, defence cooperation, regional cooperation through bodies such as the Pacific Island Forum. </p>
