    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much, Peter Leahy. Thanks very much, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Itâs terrific to be here with the Chief of Army, General David Morrison, and also with two remarkable Australians, Seamus Donaghue and Heath Jamieson, who are about to set off on their extraordinary journey to the South Pole.</p>
<p>We are doing two things today. We are honouring the service and the sacrifice of our Australian military personnel in Afghanistan. Forty have died, 261 have been seriously wounded and many, many more will bear the unseen scars of war for the rest of their lives. We honour everything that they have done: for us, for the people of Afghanistan, and for the wider world.</p>
<p>But while we honour the service and the sacrifice, we also celebrate the extraordinary spirit of these young men and women, which is so magnificently epitomised by Heath and Seamus, both of whom were seriously wounded in combat operations in Afghanistan; either of whom could have decided to lick their wounds, as it were, and simply to limp along. But neither have taken that choice. Both have decided that they are keen to participate in this epic journey to the South Pole, in their case, alongside two Canadian comrades, in competition with our British and American comrades.</p>
<p>I know it will be a fierce but friendly competition. Prince Harry has boasted that he will be boiling the billy for Heath and for Seamus. I suspect, in fact, they will be boiling the billy for Prince Harry when the British team staggers in having no doubt gone round and round in ever decreasing circles because, as you guys said, theyâre officers and youâre men and youâll get straight to the point! So, well done, Heath and Seamus. Well done to everyone who has served our country in uniform, and a particular tribute to all who have served our country in and out of uniform in the conflict in Afghanistan â now drawing to a close, but very important for our country, for Afghanistan and for the wider world.</p>
<p>Politicians like to arrive to events like this bearing something other than mere words. So, today I come armed with this cricket bat, which has been signed by the Australian team. It was presented by me on behalf of the Australian team to our military personnel in Tarin Kot in Afghanistan just a few days ago. They gave it to me to bring back to present to you, Heath and Seamus. I understand that youâre not expected to carry it to the South Pole, but you will in turn give it to <em>Soldier On</em> and I gather that itâs going to be raffled to raise funds for this extraordinary cause.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for the support you give to our military personnel.</p>
<p>To Heath and to Seamus â well done. You go with our blessings, our prayers, our best wishes and I know you will carry the honour of our soldiers and the honour of our country to good effect to the southern-most point on our planet.</p>
