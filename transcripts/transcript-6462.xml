* FOR MEDIA 13 September 1984<br />
Unnecessary panic is being generated amongst pensioners by<br />
wildly inaccurate reports of the plans for implementation of<br />
the assets test.<br />
At this stage no final advice or forms have been approved.<br />
The Government has consulted pensioner organisations-t-oensure<br />
the final forms cause as little alarm as possible.<br />
The Government's approach has been thoroughly endorsed by most<br />
responsible pensioner organisations.<br />
They want their members to realize that very few pensioners will<br />
be affected by the test.<br />
* The final forms will be simple and will r. equire only a very<br />
small percentage of pensioners to respond.<br />
While the Government has wide support for the principle of the<br />
assets test, it has been especially sensitive in preparing<br />
these forms. Within two weeks the final forms will be released<br />
publicly. </p>
