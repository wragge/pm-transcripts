IMANILA CONFERENCE<br />
STATEMENT JY THE PRIMIE MINISTER, IR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONFERENCE OCTOBER, 1966<br />
The Australian Prime I. inister, Mr. Harold Holt, said tonight<br />
that he was deli; hted with the outcome of the Manila Conference.<br />
He said he would not have thought it practicable to reach such<br />
' eneral agreement on a host of matters in the time available. It<br />
had ) een a highly suc essful conference and the results were to be<br />
found registered' in three important and significant documents.<br />
Mr. Holt said he doubted if he had ever attended a conference<br />
with more ready agreement on matters of su-stance. One could not<br />
have wished for a more cordial or co-operative spirit and atmosphere<br />
and one left the conference greatly heartened oy the outcome.<br />
He said he was certain from the sincerity, the earnestness<br />
and goodwill manifest at all stages throughout the conference that<br />
there would be a renuine attempt to implement all the goals the<br />
nations had set themselves and all the particular matters in the<br />
communique to which they had su scrioed. For Australia it had been<br />
a heartening experience. The renewed unity displayed in the conclusions<br />
from the conference would contribute to the allied cause in Vietnam.<br />
