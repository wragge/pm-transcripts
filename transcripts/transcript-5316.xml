PRIME MINISTER THURSDAY,, APRIL 3 1980<br />
from the Press Office SUMMARY OF 7.45 NEWS I<br />
Chemists in Australia-have been overpaid by the Fede ent<br />
for dispensing by as much as $ 235 million in the pas 1yeht.<br />
The Minister for Health told Parliament last night th t money<br />
paid under the Pharmaceutical Benefit's Scheme could not be recovered<br />
by law. He said the excess payments which could not be estimated<br />
exactly were attributable to an error in 1974 in the translation<br />
of statistical specifications to computer-and in the method of<br />
updating information.<br />
Sir Charles Court says he is prepared to ensure that drilling<br />
will go ahead at Noonkambah, and that if Amax wanted its water<br />
drilling rig back on the station today, his government would make<br />
this possible. Sir Charles said white-stirrers were leading<br />
the Aboriginies to adopt a subversive attitude. Federal opposition<br />
spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs, Mr West and Federal Labor Member<br />
for Fremantle were at Noonkambah yesterday. Mr West said they<br />
saw what he described as the peaceful and negotiated withdrawal<br />
of Amax workers from the station, and that there was no intimidation<br />
or threats of violence.<br />
Senator Chip has sent a cable to President Carter asking him to<br />
persuade Amax not to drill on or near sacred Aboriginal sites. He<br />
said that the WA government was applying pressure to Amax to drill<br />
on or near the sites, and that Amax was responding to the pressure.<br />
Britain is considering the development of chemical weapons.<br />
The government's first policy paper on defence provides for<br />
a big increase in defence spending in the next financial year.<br />
The government also plans to increase the role of-women in the<br />
defence servi-ces, including the possibility of letting them<br />
carry guns.<br />
An amendment to Queensland's Police Act giving police the power<br />
to compile dossiers without their knowledge has been defended by<br />
the Police Commiss-ionerMrCamm. He said the police were already<br />
keeping dossiers and the amendment passed last week would simply<br />
make the action legal. Mr Camm said he knew of many people who<br />
would like the police to keep a dossier on them,-including their<br />
finger prints, to show that they were good upright citizens.<br />
Bank interest, rates in the US has now risen to 20% and other<br />
interest rates are also.-expected to rise.<br />
The Federal Government has denied a visa to a Soviet cosmonaut<br />
who was invited to Australia on a goodwill visit. The Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs said it had refused the visa application, in line<br />
with the Government's policy of preventing-cultural exchanges with<br />
the Soviet Union.<br />
* Widespread rioting has broken out in Bristol, England, following<br />
a police raid on a club in a predominately black part of the city.<br />
Mr Ken Fry has called for an enquiry into the conduct of police<br />
at a 21st birthday party in Canberra three weeks ago. He told<br />
Parliament yesterday that only a full enquiry would restore respect<br />
for the police in Canberra. 000---</p>
