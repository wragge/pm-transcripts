    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think all Australians would like to see Steve Waugh';s career finish with a win for Australia in his last test.  Whatever happens, he will leave the scene with immense goodwill and the admiration of the Australian cricket public and the admiration of the nation for the gritty, determined way he has led the team more than anybody else, and so successfully.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you sent him a personal message?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I sent him a personal message a couple of days ago wishing him well and I guess saying what everybody else wants to say â he has been a great performer, he has been a great leader and he has set a good example not only in cricket â he has been helping less fortunate people, and he is a very patriotic Australian.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] do you think he will have nerves or be suffering nerves?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He';s not called the iceman for nothing.  He is pretty good at containing himself.  He wouldn';t have stayed on top for so long if he hadn';t have been.  I think he will have his focus very much on the game and he will be a lot calmer than many people think.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> [Inaudible] today at the SCG?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think it';s just a superb way for the test series to end â beautiful day, full house, great grounds, and I can';t wait to start looking at it.</p>
