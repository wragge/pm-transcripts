PRIME MINISTER9 2<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA RECOGNISES GEORGIA<br />
Australia has decided to recognise Georgia as an independent<br />
state.<br />
Australia recognised the eleven co-founders of the<br />
Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS) on 26 December 1991.<br />
At that time, the Government decided not to recognise Georgia<br />
because there was not a government exercising effective<br />
control. moreover, unlike the co-founders of the CIS, Georgia<br />
had not given the undertakings on observance of democracy and<br />
human rights that had been sought by the international<br />
community. Georgian authorities have now indicated their acceptance of<br />
internationally accepted democratic and human rights<br />
standards. This has been accompanied by a welcome<br />
stabilisation of the situation within Georgia.<br />
Australia is delighted to welcome Georgia into the<br />
international community. In particular, I am very pleased<br />
that such an able and respected statesman as<br />
Eduard Shevardnadze has decided to return to his native<br />
Georgia to head the interim state council. I am confident<br />
that Mr Shevardnadze will make 8 significant contribution to<br />
solving the formidable challenges faced by his country.<br />
I warmly welcome the commitments made by the Georgian<br />
authorities to respect internationally accepted democratic and<br />
human rights standards. I also welcome the announcement that<br />
new and democratic elections will be held in the near future.<br />
It is Australia's hope that these elections will go 8 long way<br />
to resolving the tensions created by the recent conflict in<br />
Georgia.<br />
Australia has also decided to establish diplomatic relations<br />
with Georgia. The minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade,<br />
Senator Evans, has instructed the Australian Ambassador in<br />
Moscow, Mr Cavan Hogue, to make the necessary practical<br />
arrangements. CANBERRA 29 March 1992 </p>
