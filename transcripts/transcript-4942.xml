Peking's new ties with Washington will<br />
bring far-reaching changes to Asia. For the<br />
according to Australia's leader: a<br />
bigger role in the region-and a chance<br />
to sell its technology to China.<br />
Q Mr. Prime Minister, what impact has President Carter's<br />
decision to normalize relations with Communist China had on<br />
your part of the world?<br />
A The move was inevitable-and the impact will be<br />
great. As long as Washington and Peking did not recognize<br />
each other fully, the development of U. S. policy in the<br />
Western Pacific and in Asia was severely handicapped.<br />
I can understand the feelings that people-some peoplehave<br />
about Taiwan. But the fact remains: China is one of the<br />
great nations of the world, and it is very important for the<br />
U. S. to be in full, complete dialogue, communication and intercourse<br />
with China.<br />
There are many people in my part of the world who have<br />
questioned the depth or fullness of America's commitment<br />
in Asia and the Pacific. And in my book, one of the factors<br />
that constrained full development of U. S. policy in the<br />
region was the lack of normal relations with China. So,<br />
Carter's move was important. But equally important in my<br />
view is just how the President will now follow through.<br />
I think it's a good thing the discussions with the Philippines<br />
on the American bases there were concluded at the<br />
same time that agreement was reached between the U. S.<br />
and China. It would have been unfortunate to have the<br />
viability of those bases in limbo at that particular time.<br />
Some people in the Pacific region are very concerned<br />
about the implications of the abrogation of the security<br />
treaty with Taiwan and what that means to American credibility.<br />
But the U. S.-Philippines agreement showed that<br />
Washington is conscious of the need to maintain American<br />
power in the Pacific. And if there still are reservations<br />
about America, I have no doubt the Carter administration<br />
has the capacity to overcome them.<br />
Q Why do you say Carter's follow-through is important in the<br />
China-U. S. relationship?<br />
A Communications between China and the United States<br />
must be greater and more open than at any time in the past<br />
Many nations-Australia was one-kept their doors to China<br />
closed too long. That was not a very good way to conduct relationships<br />
v. ith an important nation. China must be a part of<br />
the world-a full member of the international community,<br />
fully participating in international organizations.<br />
And now China is making her own moves, with technological<br />
advances and modernization the current objectives.<br />
She has the capacity to pursue these with enormous energy<br />
and determination, and will probably achieve considerable<br />
results in the foreseeable future. So it is important to draw<br />
China into the international community, and the U. S. evidently<br />
plans to advance this by comprehensive exchange<br />
visits between the two countries this year.<br />
Q As part of the follow-through, should the U. S. offer to sE,<br />
weapons to Peking?<br />
A China has taken a clear decision to modernize its economy<br />
and producti e capacities. I have no doubt that decision<br />
Copyright C 1979, U. S. News World Report, Inc. rI<br />
r*<br />
will embrace the moderniza-;<br />
tion of its defense equipinent<br />
and industry.. As in other<br />
areas, such modernization<br />
will require the purchase of<br />
products and technology<br />
from others, and I think it inevitable<br />
that will happen.<br />
Q Looking forward: Do you<br />
expect the U. S. role in Asia to<br />
be more-or less-important?<br />
A America's role will be more significant than at any<br />
time since Vietnam. Your experience in that war was traumatic,<br />
and even though it may not have paralyzed American<br />
policy in Asia, it certainly made things more difficult.<br />
Now, with Vietnam far behind and normalization of relations<br />
with China today's reality, I think the U. S. will inevitably<br />
play an increasingly important role in the matters of<br />
real concern that are developing.<br />
The war between Vietnam and Kampuchea-formerly<br />
Cambodia-is not just a border skirmish. It's war by any<br />
standards. We know that China provides assistance to Kampuchea,<br />
and Russia helps Vietnam. This raises a very serious<br />
issue: Will Russia and China provide further support-say,<br />
to the point where they become involved themselves?<br />
There is no doubt that the Soviet Unidn is deeply involved<br />
in Vietnam and is taking an increasing interest in<br />
that area. China doesn't feel comfortable about that, with<br />
tension developing on her border with Vietnam and along<br />
her border with Russia.<br />
And if Vietnam extends its dominance over a wider region,<br />
how would China react? This is a very real, vastly<br />
important question. And it's not an issue that will develop<br />
five years hence; the issue is here now.<br />
Q Could the Vietnam-Cambodia conflict spill over into other<br />
countries nearby?<br />
A There's no doubt that if Vietnam's invasion goes on and<br />
Kampuchea [ Cambodia] is occupied, there'd be increasing<br />
concern in Thailand and Malaysia-no doubt about that at<br />
all-and worry in other areas. It would be unsettling.<br />
Q You see the possibility, then, of Russia winning a warperhaps<br />
by proxy-in Southeast Asia as the first development<br />
following U. S. recognition of China?<br />
. A That overstates it. But. if that occurred, it would be a<br />
tragic development.<br />
Q How does the U. S. fit into this situation in view of the<br />
Carter administration's proposals to reduce the American military<br />
presence in Asia?.<br />
A It's difficult to say what can be done at the moment.<br />
Solutions have to be worked for, strived for, over a long<br />
period of time. However. I think the rate of American<br />
troop withdrawals from Korea has been modified. and. the<br />
administration keeps saying its decisions will be take on a<br />
step-by-step basis as the situation develops.<br />
It's important that American power be available, which is<br />
why the Philippines-bases agreement was so important. It<br />
was very much a reaffirmation of an American military<br />
presence in Asia.<br />
Q On the other side of the coin, is the Soviet military<br />
buildup In the Pacific a threat to regional security?<br />

A People use the same terms, but interpret them in<br />
different ways. When you say " threat," do you mean the<br />
forces will move against a particular country? That's one<br />
kind of threat. There's another kind of threat in which<br />
ships of a particular nation sail over the horizon without<br />
ever firing a shot. All they do is demonstrate the presence<br />
of povper.<br />
The point I've generally sought to make about the Soviet<br />
Unidti is that its presence in the Indian Ocean-or, for that<br />
matter, anywhere-is a manifestation of its global power, its<br />
capacity to reach out into any part of the world and act in a<br />
destabilizing manner.<br />
The Soviet Union spends 11 to 13 percent of its gross national<br />
product on defense year after year after year. Ironically,<br />
this expenditure began increasing about the same time<br />
the United States started to speak more seriously about disarmament<br />
and the strategic-arms-limitation talks. Don't<br />
draw ominous conclusions from this, but it shows the level of<br />
military preparedness in the Soviet Union: The percentage<br />
that Russia spends on defense is about the same as Hitler's in<br />
1938, just before he went to war.<br />
Against that background, I think all of us have to be concerned<br />
about Soviet willingness to deploy military power. Of<br />
course, countries like Australia must do what they can, but<br />
there's a terrible logic in the obligations that all this places<br />
on the world's greatest free nation-the United States.<br />
Q Is Russia going to be a big winner in Africa?<br />
A The outlook for Soviet influence in Africa over the.<br />
long term will be significantly dependent on how racial<br />
problems and injustices are dealt with inside Africa. The<br />
longer you have a white minority regime in Zimbabwe<br />
[ Rhodesia] seeking by one means or another to prolong<br />
white supremacy, the longer the circumstances exist which<br />
will help Communists to establish a firm, permanent foothold<br />
in Africa.<br />
Russia has had some successes in the past-failures, too.<br />

ether countries.<br />
SThere's always a temptation to look at the gloomy side of<br />
nternational problems. There is the situation in Iran at the<br />
moment. The Camp David initiatives have faltered-hopefully<br />
only temporarily. Africa's problems continue. But<br />
these difficulties have been there for a very, very long time.<br />
Despite the delays, the Middle East is more hopeful than<br />
it has been in decades. Even in southern Africa, there is<br />
growing recognition that racial equality must prevail. Isn't<br />
that an advance, despite the fact that guerrilla war and<br />
violence are spreading, compared with the time when people<br />
thought that white supremacy would go on fore.. er?<br />
Q So military force isn't the answer to the spreading Soviet<br />
influence in Africa-<br />
A The United States certainly needs to have force and<br />
power readily available. But getting rid of the basic inequalities<br />
of southern Africa would do more to diminish<br />
Soviet influence there than any single act within British or<br />
American capacity.<br />
Q Mr. Prime Minister, why do refugees keep fleeing from<br />
Vietnam? Is there any answer to that problem?<br />
A The emigration is promoted by the Vietnamese government,<br />
and it's the kind of government which is likely to<br />
create dissident groups. So I see no end to the flo\ w. It can<br />
go on for tens upon tens of thousands of people.<br />
We've taken a very large number of the refugees-in<br />
relation to our size, probably more than any other country.<br />
a The United States has shown concern, as have a few others.<br />
But if countries aren't geographically close to a problem,<br />
they find it easy to keep it at arm's length.<br />
I think the international community has a responsibility<br />
toward political refugees, and the United States has shown<br />
it is in accord with this-view. But it's a heavy load for the<br />
U. S. and Australia and a few other countries to bear alone.<br />
The burden needs to be spread as widely as possible.<br />
Q Going back to the question of U. S. recognition of China: Is<br />
the government in Peking stable, or is it likely to reverse policies<br />
later on?<br />
A Now that China has set its course, I think it will continue<br />
in the same direction. The new course invol'. ed quite<br />
substantial policy changes, and I don't think they could<br />
have been taken without some kind of consensu, in the<br />
leadership. One man may have promoted the changes, but<br />
he would not be successful unless he persuaded others that<br />
he had chosen the right track.<br />
I had S or 9 hours of discussions with China's leaders<br />
when I was there about two years ago, and judging by what<br />
I saw and heard, there are reasonable prospects of stability<br />
and a continuity of policy. But, as you know, nothing is<br />
certain in the political world.<br />
Q Australia has been doing business with China for years. On<br />
the basis of your experience, do you think Americans are exaggerating<br />
China's potential?<br />
A There are some who say that China doesn't produce<br />
the things the Australia and other richer nations want,<br />
and therefore China will build up debts which will be<br />
difficult to pay. I don't believe this will happen. I think the<br />
Chinese will be absolutely scrupulous and take on only<br />
those international commitments they will be able to meet<br />
in the foreseeable future.<br />
The Chinese are realists. If they need something. they'll<br />
buy it: if they don't need it, they won't buy it. So. likewise,<br />
the Chinese can't expect countries to buy things from them<br />
that aren't needed.<br />
Also, the Chinese are very concerned about their international<br />
reputation. In trade with us, they've lways been<br />
scrupulous in meeting contract terms. There's no reason to<br />
believe this won't continue. U. S. NEWS WORLD REPORT. Jan. 15. 1979 </p>

Twin J. Drechsel, the magazine's senior<br />
West Coast correspondent, has just<br />
completed a one-month swing through<br />
Australia. Following are excerpts from<br />
his memo to the editors. CANBERRA<br />
" Australia is headed for ruin" is a<br />
complaint I heard frequently during<br />
my visit to the island continent.<br />
Many Australians fear for their country's<br />
future. They worry whether their<br />
resource-rich nation, plagued by labor<br />
unrest, low productivity and high costs,<br />
can go on selling its goods on world<br />
markets against increasingly stiff foreign<br />
competition.<br />
Australians, like Americans, are concerned<br />
about inflation, unemployment<br />
and pollution of the environment. But<br />
many say they face an even bigger<br />
problem: the capriciousness of their<br />
trade unions. There is a widespread<br />
feeling that union extremists are trying<br />
to undermine the country.<br />
Strikes are called for such petty reasons<br />
as dust blowing on workers' autos.<br />
Production stagnates. Train, bus and<br />
airline services are halted time and<br />
again because of labor disputes.<br />
Longshoremen tie up ships vital to<br />
Australia's export trade-mainly mineraTs<br />
and farm products. Oil tankers<br />
wait for weeks to unload. In the first<br />
nine months of 1978, Australia accounted<br />
for 85 percent of total world<br />
claims for dock-strike losses.<br />
" You only have to sneeze or turn<br />
your head sideways, and they go on<br />
strike" was one comment I heard.<br />
In Broken Hill, a rich silver and leadmining<br />
town in the New South Wales<br />
outback, a retired workman echoed a<br />
common gripe: " Australia is going<br />
downhill. People want work, but they<br />
are not willing to produce efficiently."<br />
Spiraling wages, which are forced on<br />
business by militant unions, have aggravated<br />
an already tight situation for<br />
Australian exporters. In the textile industry,<br />
for instance, wages soared 170<br />
percent in five years, forcing garment<br />
makers unable to compete with lowcost<br />
Asian products to merge or go<br />
bankrupt. Unions demand and get higher pay<br />
for weekends, forcing many plants and<br />
services to close rather than pay up.<br />
Says one retailer: " Weekend rates inflate<br />
our costs and limit employment."<br />
The United States is much like Australia-and is much liked by Australians.<br />
During my mGnth-long travels,<br />
which included five bays on a Murray<br />
River side-wheeler, I heard not one<br />
anti-American comment. But the Australians<br />
I met asked many questions<br />
about the United States.<br />
Interest is understandable. Australia<br />
has been a longtime friend and ally of<br />
the United States, through two World<br />
Wars and conflicts in Korea and Vietnam.<br />
The two countries, with New<br />
Zealand, are linked in the ANZUS defense<br />
treaty. Australia, therefore, fully<br />
supports the American military presence<br />
in the Pacific.<br />
Australia is similar to America in its<br />
economy and society. But there is one<br />
major difference: It has only 14 million<br />
people in an area roughly the size of<br />
the Lower 48 United States.<br />
Australians realize that their political<br />
voice in the world is limited because of<br />
their small population. Yet, as a source<br />
of raw materials, the country assumes<br />
an importance that is out of proportion<br />
to the number of its people.<br />
Japan, Australia's leading trading<br />
partner, imports nearly 50 percent of<br />
its iron ore, 44 percent of its coking<br />
coal, 100 percent of its alumina plus<br />
other vital minerals from Australia.<br />
But problems in Australia-Japan<br />
trade could lie ahead. The Japanese<br />
ambassador, commenting on widespread<br />
labor unrest, has raised the possibility<br />
that his nation is " fed up with<br />
frequent industrial disputes and seeks<br />
more-reliable supply sources."<br />
Australia's trade with the U. S. is<br />
deeply in the red. Officials fear that<br />
this gap could widen if American cattlemen<br />
succeed in efforts to limit imports<br />
of Aussie beef, now totaling about<br />
550 million dollars a year. Most imported<br />
Australian beef is used for hamburger<br />
or in processed meats.<br />
Also, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's<br />
conservative Liberal-National<br />
Country Party coalition has failed in<br />
attempts to gain entry into the European<br />
Common Market for sales of Australian<br />
butter, cheese, sugar, beef and<br />
canned fruits.<br />
Energy may be the key to the future<br />
for Australia, which is rich in uranium<br />
and coal-but not oil. Says Sir James<br />
McNeill, chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary<br />
Company, the country's lairgest<br />
firm: " Australia has higher reserves<br />
of coal and uranium per head than any<br />
other country." He advocates that Australia<br />
sell uranium and surplus coal to<br />
buy the oil it needs.<br />
The Fraser coalition has lifted uranium<br />
export controls imposed by the<br />
previous government of Labor Prime Minister Cough Whitlam, whose 1975<br />
firing by Governor General Sir John<br />
Kerr, Queen Elizabeth's representative,<br />
still creates constitutical aftershocks.<br />
The abrupt action rneriy tore<br />
once-stable Australia apart. But it reversed<br />
worsening U. S.-Australia relations<br />
and ended demands fcr removal<br />
of strategic U. S. military ba: zes.<br />
American investors, wit. h -tr. iost a 6-<br />
billion-dollar stake in Aust-alia, welcome<br />
Fraser's efforts to ea-e labhi unrest<br />
and his cutting of infiat-. on from<br />
more than 20 percent in 1975 t under<br />
10 percent now. The goveranment also<br />
has taken steps to encourage greater<br />
foreign investment to supply a muchneeded<br />
boost to the economy<br />
For Australians, fed up wit. the way<br />
things are going, this cannot ccme too<br />
soon Philippa Field, a teacher in South<br />
Australia, spoke for many '. hen she<br />
said: " I never read the news these days.<br />
It's all bad." l<br />
