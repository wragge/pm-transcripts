    <content><![CDATA[<p>An overriding loyalty to Australia, and a commitment to its traditions, values and institutions is the common bond that unites us all.  In confronting the challenges of terrorism, we agree that:</p>
<p>1. All Australians are subject to the laws of this country and in turn are entitled to equal protection under those laws.</p>
<p>  2. All Australians should respect and participate in the democratic institutions and practices of this country.</p>
<p>3. All Australians unconditionally reject and denounce all forms of violence or terrorism and acts or language which promote hatred, violence or terrorism.  Such behaviour has no role in advancing the political or religious objectives of any group and are contrary to the values embraced by all Australians.</p>
<p>  4. Violence and acts of terrorism committed in the name of Islam are a perversion of Muslim faith.</p>
<p>  5. Acts of terrorism are repugnant to all Australians irrespective of their race or religion and all Australians must work together to ensure that everything is done to prevent the scourge of terrorism from coming to Australia.</p>
<p>  6. Members of the Muslim faith, and in particular its leaders, have a responsibility to challenge and counteract those who seek to encourage the use of violence and terrorism in the name of Islam.  The government must support and encourage Islamic leaders to challenge and to eradicate extremism.</p>
<p>  7. We commit ourselves to work together with all Australians to produce positive outcomes which protect Australia against violence, terrorism and intolerance and promote our common goals of harmony and understanding.</p>
<p>  We together have agreed that:</p>
<p> our discussions today represented an important exchange of ideas between the Australian Government and the Islamic community that should continue;</p>
<p> the Australian Government will seek the cooperation of the Governments of the States and Territories in working towards a national strategy to address intolerance and the promotion of violence;</p>
<p> those present will continue to take a lead working with their communities and with other Islamic organisations to promote harmony, mutual understanding and Australian values within their communities and to challenge violence and extremism; and</p>
<p> the Australian Government will ensure that its programmes and policies enhance mutual understanding between the Islamic community and the broader Australian community and promote the Australian values of harmony, justice and democracy.</p>
