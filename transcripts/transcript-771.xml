OPENING OF TIM ORD RIVER DAM AT KUNUNURRA.<br />
NORTHERN TERRI-TORY ON 20TH JULY, 1963<br />
Speech by the Prime Mlinistrtht. Hn Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Acting Premier, Parliamentary Colleagues and Indies and<br />
Gentlemen In mny family, we have a little family joke. I<br />
have to open th-.. ngs occasionally and every now and then I get<br />
up and make a pc.-. wcrful speech, of course, and forget to perform<br />
the opening ceremony. So I am now under firm instructions by<br />
my wife to get the job over and talk afterwards. So I declare<br />
the Ord River Diversion Dam opon. ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
So you see, ladies and gentlemen, from this moment,<br />
nobody will be able to look at this Dam and say, " What a pity<br />
it was never opened." Everything is now in order.<br />
The next thing I want to say to you is that I have<br />
received a message from Her Majesty The Queen who came up here<br />
some little time ago on, I believo, a very hot day and enjoyed<br />
it, and has frequently told rme since how much she enjoyed it.<br />
This is the message from her, addressed to myself<br />
" I am so much interested to k-now that<br />
you are opening the Ord River<br />
Diversion Dam today. Both my husband<br />
and I havc the happiest memories of<br />
our visit to Kununurra last March and<br />
we send our good wishes to all<br />
assembled on this occasion which is<br />
so important for the future economy<br />
of Western Australia and for that of<br />
the Commonwealth of Australia,<br />
( Signed) Elizabeth R. 11<br />
It's a strange kind of world that we live in.<br />
Today I am credibly informed is Saturday and on Saturday morning<br />
a week ago, we carie pie-eyed out of an aircraft that had just<br />
arrived from the Unitod States of America. And on Sunday<br />
afternoon, I had a pross and television interview than which,<br />
I warn you young fellows there, there can be nothing more<br />
terrifying in the world. Then we sat down in the Cabinet room<br />
and have been discussing financial matters and of course<br />
whenever we discuss financial matters, West Australia is never<br />
very far away. ( Laughter)<br />
We stopped on Thursday exhausted by ill-doing, no<br />
doubt, and declared a simple adjournment so that some of us<br />
could come over here and then go back and resume our iniquitous<br />
tasks, so far as I am concerned on Monday. I don't mind telling<br />
you for a while I rather felt inclined to grumble and say, " Oh,<br />
dear me, welve just gt back from a tiring journey. Fancy<br />
having to go all that distance." What I said under my breath<br />
about Dave Brand and Charlie Court was really not quite polite,<br />
but we have arrived and weVebeen driving around or been driven<br />
around this morning and I don't miind telling you, speaking of<br />
myself and I know even rjore so for m,. y wife, there's no weariness<br />
left in us. This is the most exciting place in Australia at<br />
this moment. ( Applause) oe. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
For years and years what, seventeen years, I thinkyou've<br />
had this experimental station, a combination of the<br />
talents of your own officers and those of the C. S. I. R. 0. it<br />
couldn't have been very easy for men of learning and qualifications<br />
to come and, as they might think, lose themselves in what<br />
was comparatively a desert, rune of the amenities of life,<br />
isolated, sustained only by their tremendous skill and their<br />
burning enthusiasm. You know, all round the world, there is a<br />
disposition to think of the Australian as a rather cynical<br />
fellow you kno~ w, agin everybody, agin everything. Well,<br />
true enough in politics of eourse, temporarily. ( Laughter)<br />
But whenever I go to where things are being done in Australia,<br />
I am reminded that this country can produce more concentrated<br />
enthusiasm and skill and devotion to the appropriate task than<br />
any other country that I know, and I want to make my bow in the<br />
direction of those people who started the experimental station<br />
and who did work, without which we wouldn't be here today and<br />
there would be no Ord Scheme at all,<br />
The application of science, combined with enthusiasm,<br />
based upon caref'ul research work we have today a dermonstration<br />
of one stage of what can be done when those things come together.<br />
It's been a very great privilege, I think, for the Commonwealth<br />
and in particular my own Government, to be associated with this<br />
work, but I don't hesitate to say that the work could not have<br />
been done except for enthusiasts far far mmovod from the Cabinet<br />
room at Canberra. The work has been done by your people and with<br />
immense skill, The other day I was at Washington and then two days<br />
before that or three days before that I was at Monticello,<br />
tho home of the great Thomas Jefferson, and I there made a speech.<br />
I'm not going to repeat it to you, so be at ease on that point.'<br />
But one remark I venture to rop eat today. When the United States<br />
of America was established and, when in the early part of the<br />
nineteenth century, Thomas Jefferson became President and served<br />
as President for two terms, he presided over a nation of 5 million<br />
people. We today have 11 million. We know what has happened<br />
in the case of the United States. We know that there you have<br />
a country roughly with our area which, within a measurable term<br />
of years, will have 200 million people and which will be, as it<br />
is now, the grea~ test physical power in the world. All I want to<br />
say to you is that there is nothing that has happened there that<br />
cantt happen here. Eleven million poople. Twice the population<br />
we had forty years ago, with the clear prospect of having<br />
million peopleo in the lifetime of quite a few of those present<br />
today. We can look forward with confidence to our future<br />
provided, of course, that we keep in our minds that nothing is<br />
impossible. In my own grown-up lifetime, in my own time in<br />
public life, which now grows, as anybody can tell you, very<br />
lengthy, I have seen things that were regarded as impossible<br />
brought to fruition. If anybody had by some process gone<br />
through this country thirty years ago and had talked confidently<br />
about having this great irrigation scheme this enormous vista<br />
of the future, beginning in an ostablishoa way by 1963, he<br />
would have been told not to talk nonsense " That's quite<br />
impossible." But the whole history of Australia is the history<br />
of the impossible becoming the possible and of the possible<br />
becoming the probable nnd of the probable becoming the certointy,<br />
the living fact. This, indeed, is the challenge to all of us<br />
who are Australians and it is a challenge which ought to give us<br />
great pride., 9* */ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
It isn't a challenge, ladies and gentlemen, that<br />
can be postponed indefinitely. If there is one thing that<br />
we have all lea.' nt it is that in this country of ours, the<br />
future hurries in upon us. What we thought of as something<br />
that might be looked at in ten years, all of a sudden becomes<br />
something that we ought to look at in five years because the<br />
future is pressing in on us. One of the reasons for that is<br />
that our population is growing, gzowing at an unprecedented<br />
rate, and the rioment that you begin to increase your population<br />
in a country lie this at the rate of say, 250,000 a year, you<br />
begin to feel the pressure upon resources so that we may sustain<br />
that population and so that we may attract more so that we may<br />
become a bigger and a stronger country, more and more rapidly.<br />
Therefore, the pressure is on all of us to attract our minds<br />
to works of devlopment which will be the foundation for future<br />
economic and population growth.<br />
Now there is just one aspect of that that I would<br />
like to say something to you about not that I want to keep<br />
you here too long. Australia, we dontt need to remind<br />
ourselves, is a large place. de have our population concentrated<br />
to an enormous extent in a relatively narrow stretch of country<br />
from Brisbane to Adelaide probably at least 80 per cent. of<br />
the people of A. ustralia in that area and every now and then<br />
we do attract our minds to the problem of getting over this, of<br />
decentralising, In every State you will hear State Premiers,<br />
State Ministers discussing the problem of decentralisation, of<br />
doing something to prevent the movement of people, the aggregation<br />
of people in the big cities, so that the country may live<br />
and prosper, so that the nation may live and prosper. Well, that's<br />
a very powerful problem, but viewed nationally, there is another<br />
aspect of it and that is that we must cease to regard Victoria,<br />
Now South Wales, for example, as highly-developed States<br />
affording a great field for future growth. We are not to<br />
think of it simply in those terms. What we must think of<br />
increasingly is how in the larger States we can secure a development<br />
which will lend strength to the nation as a whole.<br />
There are two outstanding examples of this, of course,<br />
in West Australia and in Queensland, the largest States, States<br />
whose resources are not yet fully known, States in which development<br />
may occur which will alter thie entire economic balance of<br />
the Australian nation. Now this is not going to be done<br />
overnight. I don't profess to say nor does anybody else, that<br />
what has been done here solves the problem. It doesn't. It<br />
begins to solve the problem. It i. s an indication of what may<br />
be done in the future. 1%. aer e not at the end of something<br />
here today; we are at the beginning of something, just as<br />
the experimental station is not at the end of its work but at<br />
the beginning of its work. We must go on and on and on if<br />
these great areas in Australia are to grow and become effective<br />
contributors to Australian life. Now that is a broad statement<br />
but it is a trla statement. I ho! ce that it is one that we<br />
will all have in mind.<br />
In Queensland, for exazpie, the discoveries in the<br />
mineral world, :. ncluding some oil., have been such as were not<br />
dreamed about * ixenty years ago, and in mineral development in<br />
particular, thm-t State may have t whole of its character<br />
changed and the whole of its cont.: z. bution to Australia increased.<br />
In Western Aus,. alia, of course, you also have mineral development;<br />
only at t[ te beginning of it, I venture to say but year<br />
after year after year, this area associated with great names<br />
among the early settlers I say nothing about the best-known<br />
ones because I don't need to mention them, but even a man<br />
0 000/ q + </p>
<p>namied Kelly put his name on a knob of rock somewhere hero.<br />
Alexander Forrest investigated this place many years ago and<br />
wrote hopefully about its future, but for the most part it has<br />
remained as a sort of vague dream. Rainfall, yes. Water, yes.<br />
but what do you do about it? And that's why it was<br />
a masterstroke, in my opinion, for somebody to conceive the<br />
idea that investigation might develop an agricultural industry<br />
in this part of the world on a quite roemarkable scale.<br />
Well, of course, this has boon taken up with<br />
immense enthusiasm; the work has been done as far as I have<br />
been able to see it quite magnificently. I have had a close<br />
look at things I have never looked at closely before. I saw a<br />
cotton harvester at work this morning. It looked as if it had<br />
been designed by the late Heath Robinson. It does all sorts of<br />
things like this under cover and brings in the cotton. Those<br />
in charge of the cotton work here, of course, are so enthusiastic<br />
thp't they have already persuaded no that it is the best cotton<br />
in the world that in due course, and with occasional interruptions<br />
it will be practically immiune from pests that it<br />
will command the worldts price nnd well I don't krnow....<br />
I got so excited about it I began to think that the Commonwealth<br />
might be raising heavy revenues out of the cotton industry up<br />
here. But that it cnn be done is clear. I greatly enjoyed<br />
seeing these marvellous green stands of safflower until a very<br />
distinguished representative of the OSIRO took occasion to say<br />
to me " You ought to be interested in that. You know, after<br />
all, it's just a thistle."' ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
Sir, the only other thing I want to say to you is<br />
this. If this were just a miatter of opening a dam of this<br />
particular size, if this were just a matter of opening something<br />
that deals with a relatively few thousand acres of land, somebody<br />
might say, " Well, intrinsically, that's a matter of no great<br />
moment, That kind of thing must be duplicated many places in<br />
the world." But it is more than that. This is a most symbolic<br />
occasion, Man has here conquered nature in the most spectacular<br />
fashion; has done it in a part of Australia in which it was<br />
needed and needed desperately for the future of our country.<br />
And it has happened, and having happened it will go on and as it<br />
goes on, more and more people l~ iving 1,560 miles 2,000 miles<br />
away from here will become interested in it, will come to realise<br />
that what's going on up here is on the whole rather more important<br />
than what's going on in Toorak or Bellevue Hill, And it is.<br />
This is a memorable occasion. This is a symbolic<br />
occasion. It is a very great honour for me to have been invited<br />
to come here and open it. I congratulate everybody associated<br />
with it. More than that, I thank everybody associated with it.<br />
This has been no mere clock job. This has been a work of the<br />
heart, a work of devotion, as well as a work of the mind and of<br />
the hands. Sir, I repeat myself. I declare it open. </p>
