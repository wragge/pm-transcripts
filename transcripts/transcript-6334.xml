TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER AND<br />
DERRYN HINCH, 3AW 5/ 3/ 84<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY. ' r<br />
HAWKE: Yes generally speaking Derryn that's right. I think we have<br />
delivered on the major problems and the one that's basic to cverything<br />
else and that is national reconciliation. Australia's a much better<br />
country now it's more cohesive, less confrontationist society and<br />
1. hat's at the foundation of the other good things that are happening.<br />
HINCH: You said when you-came into office that your Government would<br />
make mistakes, you've admitted at the National Press Club that one<br />
mistake shall we say, was the wording and the handling of the Assets<br />
Test legislation, what happens if this panel that you have anncunced,<br />
if it recommends that there be no assets test legislation?<br />
HAWKE: Well firstly let me-say that I don't believe that it would, but<br />
if it were to do that obvioully we would have to look at it, but I<br />
think really there is no argument with the great majority of Austraiar<br />
that the concept of an assets test is right. That wasn't the issue, it<br />
was the uncertainty that arose in the minds of a number of people who<br />
would be covered, whether they might. be adversely affected and there<br />
was also some concern about possible anomalies in the system<br />
that was proposed. Now as I have said we have to accept some responsibility<br />
for this uncertainty and I think what we will see as a result<br />
of the committee of inquiry is an indication of the correctness of the<br />
principle and hopefully I would thvnk as a result of those discussions<br />
from such a broad representative group an indication of a more effectivc<br />
and acceptable way of giving effect to the principle.<br />
HINCH: But that would be one of the options that that panel could<br />
come up with, say, that we don't believe in the assets test and. we<br />
shouldn't have one. </p>
<p>HAWKE: Well you say that but I reject that there was any problera<br />
because the community obviously have shared the view of Mr. Justice Hope<br />
to comp'etely endorse the Government's handling of that issue.<br />
HINCH: Well I might say that you did lose Mick Young for six nionths.<br />
HAWKE: Yes and of course that was a loss but Mick is now back i: n the<br />
Ministry and performing very well.<br />
HINCH: With only one year in office but already there is a lot of talk,<br />
you were on ' Sunday' yesterday morning on the Channel 9 show talking<br />
about the possibilities of when an election would be held. When you<br />
say it happened 22 times before and you quote all the examples, how<br />
does that gel though with the things that, I think you had said, and<br />
Mr. Hayden had said that criticising Malcolm Fraser for having early<br />
elections? HAWKE: Well it um, in the case of Malcolm Fraser where it arose was<br />
a situation where he had control of the two Houses earlier and made a<br />
specific decision to go early and upset the pattern that had existed<br />
in the past. Now all I am saying is in these circumstances that the<br />
Constitution is there, we can't change that. Under the Constitution<br />
there must be an election by the middle of ' 85 in the Senate which is<br />
a general election that goes right across the country. Now what I'm<br />
saying is that it would make sense it seems to me to have the<br />
House of Reps early so that it can coincide with the one that must be<br />
held to avoid having one election this year and another election next<br />
year, but what we are also considering is putting at the same time<br />
a referendum proposal which would provide for simultaneous elections<br />
so that the people could be sure then that this was the last time you<br />
were going to have a circumstance where you might be having unnecessary<br />
number of elections.<br />
HINCH: Could you give an assurance that if you hold an early election<br />
and get things back into sync. that you would give a committment that<br />
your second term of government would run its f'. Lll term?<br />
HAWKE: Well I'm sure you could, and as I say the important thing<br />
Derryn, would be if you passed the referendum proposal providing for<br />
simultaneous elections, then that aspect of the problem is covered.<br />
But obviously one of the, I think the problems of government in<br />
Australia, is that we don't have long enough terms of office. I have<br />
always felt that. </p>
<p>HINCH: I would agree with you. Even the length of time that ha been<br />
given to you or to other governments, hasn't been used up. You have<br />
got Veville Wran, whc not that long ago was saying that you have got<br />
to get rid of the Russian roulette form of govermuents, of snap elections<br />
being called, yet at the weekend he has called an election six months<br />
early. HAWKE: Yeah well I agree with his decision there for the simple reason<br />
I think that unless you. have been up here, Derryn, it's hard to get<br />
the feeling of the impossibility of government that has been created<br />
by this incessant resort to allegation, smear, inuendo and despite the<br />
fact that where the inquiries have been held the allegations in each<br />
of the three cases have been found to be unfounded. the Opposition<br />
continues down this track and I think it needs to be cleared up.<br />
HINCH: So you agree with them going early?<br />
HAWKE: In these circiumstances, I think indeed that from the ereaction<br />
that I've got from people they say, well we can uneerstand these<br />
circumstances and clearly a segment of the media here is of that. view<br />
that it is an appropriate course of action. Really Derryn Until. you,<br />
unless you are in it you just can't understand how pervasive is'this<br />
attack it's gone on and on and on well I don't think a government<br />
is in a position where it can concentrate on government where it has<br />
got to deal with allegations and where at every occasion where they<br />
have been dealt with so far and followed up by investigations which<br />
take -a long time, have been shown to be unfounded.<br />
HINCH: But you see there are couple of points: One is that Nevelle<br />
Wran by saying that you can't govern with this sort of thing going cn,<br />
he's virtually saying that I can't govern, I've got 66 seats out of.<br />
99 seats and I can't govern and he now he is going to appoint this new<br />
Commissioner to look into things, he could do that without having an<br />
election and he could push it all towards tie Commissioner.<br />
HAWKE: I think he's going to give the people an opportunity of saying<br />
whether they want this sort of proo~ s-s of opposition to be continued.<br />
What you have got to remember here is that in* NSW you knock over<br />
opposition leader after opposition leader after opposition leader,<br />
now the normal processes of conducting an opposition have been<br />
abandoned by these people here so instead of dealing with issues and<br />
putting up alternative policies they have just concentrated on allegatioc<br />
wild allegations against anyone that comes into their sights, and this </p>
<p>has just produced a situation now which has been compounded by the fact<br />
that the judiciary has been attacked by their Vederal colleague, Sinclair<br />
in the mcst horrendous way I c-an remember in th6 history of this<br />
country. Now the whole system has been brought into question in this<br />
way and I think government is entitled to say look,' you say whether<br />
you really think whether this sort of thing is acceptable or niot. I<br />
think it will very substantial'. y clear the air.<br />
HINCH: Surely when, if Mr. Wran is re-elected and the opposition needs<br />
an 11% swing to beat him, if he's re-elected and I assume he will be,<br />
what is to stop, that's not-going to stop the allegations.<br />
HAWKE: Well, two things about that Derryn, one, I think the opposition<br />
will understand that they have played it badly, that people really<br />
want a more constructive approach to opposition than that, and secondly,<br />
I think it will mnean that there will be a much greater reluctance on<br />
the part of * people to make baseless allegations, or allegations.' dhich<br />
are founded simply on hearsay, that it will introduce a much more<br />
astringent approach, so that we won't have a position where there is<br />
not going to be a concern with the administration of justice and of<br />
government. But that people are not just going to simply make wild<br />
allegations, that they will-have to put up or shut up. It seems to me<br />
that that's a sensible approach.<br />
HINCH: Well some of the allegations have been made since last year and<br />
in bi-elections since then there have been swings of between 10% and<br />
14% against the Government and I wonder with Bob Hawke campaigning so<br />
strongly for Neville Wran up there if there is a swing of that magnitude,<br />
even an 8-10 swing, whether that will reflect on you and or clout,<br />
your delivery power?<br />
HAWKE: Well if I just make dfecisions'on the basis of how it is going<br />
to affect my popularity or delivery power then that's one way of<br />
conducting yourself, it's not the way I conduct myself, I see an<br />
issue there where NSW is an important state, I see a position where<br />
Neville Wran is a man I have known fkw a very long time, his integrity<br />
and honour are something tha t T respect and about which I have no<br />
doubt. He is under attack, his government is under attack. It is the<br />
largest and economically most important state in Australia. It was<br />
important in the beginning of the revival ; of the fortunes of the<br />
Labor Party, now I'm not going to turn my back on that. </p>
<p>HINCH: No but there is things like the early prisoner release system<br />
and thesf sort of arguments I suppose I should be talking to Premier<br />
Wran . bout rather ; hat to you...<br />
HAWKE: I would have thought so.<br />
HINCH: Yes but you have tied yourself very tightly to the Wran<br />
administration.<br />
HAWKE: It is not a question of tying myself to the Wran Administ. rAt. ion.<br />
I will say that the Premier and his government have done a very good<br />
job. Noone, including the Premier, is going to be saying anything within<br />
a government, within an administration there may not be some problems.<br />
Let those problems be addressed by the proper judicial processes and<br />
if it shows improper practices then let justice take its course. And<br />
I certainly say that quite clearly. The processes have been set up<br />
and you won't find me if those processes come out and say this is<br />
wrong, that person has done something wrong. I won't be seeking to<br />
defend that person or that situation, but what I will defend is this<br />
Premier and the record of his government.<br />
HINCH: Now this morning you have been launching Paul Kelly's book,<br />
one that is a very good book, " The Hawke Ascendancy",<br />
HAWKE: I'm about to do that.<br />
HINCH: You are about to do that.<br />
HAWKE: That means I'm going to have to leave you pretty soon.<br />
HINCH! Alright,-Well before you go off to launch the book, all the<br />
reviews about it, the excerpts that have been printed over the past<br />
weekend which I'm sure you have seen, I know you saw the book before<br />
it was printed, the headlines all say: things like, National Times,<br />
" The inside story of how Hawke knifed Hayden". In his book himself<br />
Relly refers to you playing a direct role in,, the assassination of<br />
Bill Hayden. Now you recall after you got the leadership you attacked<br />
Richard Carlton when he said how does it feel to have blood on your<br />
hands and you got very upset about c does this give any sort of<br />
credence now to what Carlton was talking about?<br />
HAWKE: No it gives that individual no credence at all, I mean if you<br />
want a person lacking in any sense of objectivity and impartiality<br />
you have named him. No it doesn't, obviously in politics and there<br />
has been no attempt on my part to disguise it, you have to talk with<br />
people, you have to try and get numbers.. That of course happens and </p>
<p>we know the result but the point I was making that in the end as<br />
distinct from blood on the hand. uthe opposite was true, that in the<br />
end Bill Hayden took the view that the best initerests of the party<br />
were served by the change taking place.<br />
HINCH: On the heavy pressure of the Richardsons and the Bottons<br />
HAWKE: pressure from Sen. Button, that's right. But in the end<br />
there were two courses, Bill could have fought on I suppose and you<br />
could have had a bloody battle in the Caucus, now that is not hat<br />
happened and what annoyed ine about the individual that you mnentioned<br />
on the ABC was that in fact it did very little justice to Bill Hayden's<br />
decision because he took the Alternative course which he believed was<br />
right and best for the party.<br />
HINCH: What changed Sen. Button's mind to support you? Do you know?<br />
HAWKE: You said before you should be talking to Wran about NSW, I<br />
think you should talk to John Button about that.<br />
HINCH; I will do that. I know you have to go Mr. Prime Minister,<br />
but may I ask you one more personal question from your Canberra Press<br />
Gallery, what are you going to do about the Press Gallery, are you<br />
in favour of moving it into the rose garden?<br />
HAWKE: No I'mnot in favour of moving it into the rose garden, it<br />
won't be moving into the rose garden.<br />
HINCH: Oh, well that will be good news that I can pass onto Canberra.<br />
Thank you for your time. Bye bye. </p>
