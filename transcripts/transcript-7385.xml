PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DINNER ON THE OCCASION<br />
OF THE FIRST SITTINGS IN THE<br />
NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
MONDAY, 22 AUGUST 1988<br />
Excellencies,<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
Mr President,<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
Parliamentary colleagues past and present,<br />
Representatives of Australian Parliaments and<br />
of Parliaments throughout the World<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
It is a pleasure to welcome you all to Australia's new<br />
Parliament House on the day of Parliament's first meeting<br />
here.<br />
According to the architects, this building has been<br />
constructed to last for two hundred years.<br />
And after all the effort and disruption of moving from our<br />
former Parliament, I am sure we will all appreciate that<br />
breathing space.<br />
This Great Hall has already proven its worth as the<br />
ceremonial heart of our new and permanent Parliament House.<br />
It was here that the Queen opened this building on 9 May,<br />
and it was here that Parliament has already hosted a number<br />
of important functions for foreign leaders visiting<br />
Australia to participate in our Bicentennial celebrationsthe<br />
King and Queen of Spain, and the Prime Ministers of<br />
Japan, Ireland, the United Kingdom and last week New<br />
Zealand. So it is high time that tonight the guest of honour in<br />
Parliament's Great Hall be Parliament itself members of<br />
Parliament, presiding officers, parliamentary staff: in<br />
short the men and women who today embody and bear the<br />
responsibility for upholding the great institution of<br />
Parliamentary democracy.<br />

<p>Those of our guests tonight who are making their first visit<br />
to Canberra may appreciate less vividly than those who<br />
return here each Parliamentary session just how far Canberra<br />
has come since the first sitting was held in the old<br />
building in 1927.<br />
As we take up office in a great new building situated in the<br />
heart of a vigorous and established city, we would do well<br />
to recall that six decades ago the first Secretary of the<br />
Prime Minister's Department could comment that the best view<br />
of Canberra is " from the back of the departing train".<br />
An historian of Canberra has written that in 1927 Parliament<br />
House and East and West Blocks stood out starkly in a dusty<br />
plain criss-crossed with roads seemingly leading nowhere,<br />
through paddocks fully planted with trees.<br />
The population of Canberra then was just under 6,000 people.<br />
A timber cottage could be rented for two pounds a week.<br />
And remuneration of Federal politicians stood at just under<br />
pounds a week.<br />
That salary may seem inadequate but we must remember that<br />
those were prohibition days and liquor could not legally be<br />
purchased in Canberral<br />
For those Members and Senators who became accustomed to<br />
working out of offices the size of broom closets in the old<br />
building, the dimensions of this new building and the<br />
quality of its finish will take some getting used to.<br />
Those who enjoyed the cheek by jowl intimacy which the old<br />
place enforced and I count myself among them will have<br />
to make sure the new building captures and retains some of<br />
that atmosphere.<br />
And even though there have been one or two teething problems<br />
maybe more than two I am confident the new building will<br />
succeed in becoming as effective and as friendly as the old<br />
one was.<br />
It was very fitting that when Parliament met this afternoon<br />
we passed a resolution extending our thanks to all those men<br />
and women whose care and dedication have created a building<br />
of magnificent qualities.<br />
we also passed a notion expressing our thanks to all those<br />
people, from within Australia and from overseas, whose gifts<br />
adorn this building. It is my pleasure to echo those thanks<br />
tonight in particular to the representatives of foreign<br />
Parliaments present this evening.<br />
As a symbol of the growth of Canberra, as a proof of our<br />
national confidence, above all as a solid and enduring<br />
testament of our commitment to the system of parliamentary<br />
democracy, the importance of this building cannot be<br />
overstated. 1325 </p>
<p>When I spoke at the official opening of this building in May<br />
I made mention of the ghosts or spirits of the past the<br />
earliest inhabitants of this region the Aboriginal people,<br />
those who created the Australian Federation and who served<br />
in the first Parliament House in Melbourne, and those of our<br />
more immediate predecessors who served the Australian people<br />
as Members of Parliament in what was courageously, and as it<br />
turned out accurately, termed the provisional Parliament<br />
House. The distinguished presence of those parliamentary spirits<br />
places a heavy responsibility on those of us who are their<br />
successors. It will be our job over this and succeeding sessions to<br />
imbue this new building with the best elements of their<br />
robust and vigorous parliamentary tradition.<br />
We must ensure the continued development of this nation as a<br />
home for all Australians and for all who come to live in<br />
this country. I believe it is a fundamental strength of our<br />
legal and political institutions, and of our community at<br />
large, that we have an openness, a tolerance and an<br />
encouragement of individual expression and endeavour which<br />
will enable us successfully to meet the many challenges<br />
awaiting Australia in the future.<br />
It is worth recalling that one of the significant design<br />
features of this Parliament House is its invitation to<br />
visitors to observe, and to participate in, the democratic<br />
process. I hope that as many Australians as possible will<br />
accept that invitation. And it is encouraging to know that<br />
thousands and thousands of people from around Australia and<br />
from overseas have already done so.<br />
I said at the outset that the architects intended this<br />
building to last for two hundred years.<br />
I amn sure it will though, of course, none of us will be<br />
here to find out.<br />
In two hundred years time, when Australians celebrate their<br />
quater-centenary, the four hundredth anniversary of the<br />
arrival of the First Fleet they will perhaps pause to look<br />
at the events of the Bicentennial.<br />
No doubt our clothing and speech will look quaint to our<br />
successors and many of the political issues which excite us<br />
today will have receded out of sight.<br />
But these successors will I hope appreciate at least one<br />
fact about us: the fact that we in 1988 were possessed of<br />
such a commitment to the principles of democratic government<br />
that we were prepared to build this building to enshrine and<br />
to advance those principles.<br />
i t </p>
<p>Today, after all the planning, all the hard work of design<br />
and construction, all the fitting out, and all the rigors of<br />
the move from the old Parliament House, we completed the<br />
ceremonial elements of the initiation of this new building.<br />
Tomorrow we will be getting down to the real business of<br />
this new building.<br />
As we go about that business, we must make good the<br />
underlying principle of these democratic chambers: that a<br />
people are best governed when they govern themselves. 1: 27 </p>
