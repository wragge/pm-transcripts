    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will invest $8 million to rebuild the Waltzing Matilda Centre, after a fire destroyed part of the building last year.</p>
<p>This will help ensure the great Australian story of the jolly swagman lives on in Winton.</p>
<p>Banjo Paterson wrote the words to "Waltzing Matilda" in January 1895 while staying at Dagworth Station near Winton and the iconic song has been an important part of Winton’s fabric ever since.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Regional Development Minister Fiona Nash and Federal Member for Maranoa David Littleproud visited Winton today to inspect the site of the Centre after the rebuild project was funded through the National Stronger Regions Fund.</p>
<p>The new and improved Waltzing Matilda Centre will be a major tourist attraction for the region. The Outback Queensland region is home to 611 tourism businesses. Almost half a million Australians already tour the region annually, staying an average of five nights.</p>
<p>Regional areas make a significant contribution to our nation’s economy and regional tourism is a growing industry. There are many great attractions across outback Queensland and the Visitor Information Centre will be a hub for tourist activity and promote the entire region.</p>
<p>Attractions such as the Waltzing Matilda Centre help bring residents from capital cities and beyond into rural and regional Australia to experience country life, the legend of our nation’s past and inject vital tourism dollars into the economy.</p>
<p>Rebuilding the Centre will give Winton back this important piece of its history and local identity.</p>
<p>The rebuild of the Centre includes a new interactive gallery and museum spaces, a Visitor Information Centre as well as a new gift shop and access for large vehicles.</p>
<p>The Centre will also cater for the needs of primary and secondary school groups with exhibitions not only about the tale of Waltzing Matilda but displays of early colonial life, dinosaurs and local flora and fauna.</p>
<p>This project will create construction work and ongoing jobs as visitors to the region give our retail, hospitality and accommodation sectors a boost.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Turnbull and Minister Nash acknowledged Mr Littleproud’s strong advocacy for his region.</p>
