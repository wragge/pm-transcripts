<p>Well thank you very much.  This is a fantastic Paralympic Games. I mean I will say it now, I don't want any visitors from anywhere else to say it - it's the best Paralympics ever.  I really is wonderful the way in which Australia and Australians have supported the Paralympics, it is just fantastic.  And the crowds, the enthusiasm, the support and the energy, the encouragement that's been transmitted to all of our athletes at these Games has been something wonderful.  Janette and I had a ball at the Olympics, we're having a ball at the Paralympics.  The only thing we're troubled about is that it's sort of going to end eventually I mean . . . we don't sort of know what, we're going to have to go back to all those dreary things prime ministers have got to do.</p>
<p>But anyway, I haven't come here to make a long speech.  I just want to say that it is a fantastic event.  I said yesterday and I will repeat it here tonight, that I made a commitment after the Olympic Games that because everything had gone so well that we were going to put some extra financial resources behind our Olympic athletes, can I tell you that we are going to do exactly the same thing for our Paralympians.  </p>
<p>It really is, it really has been to me and to Janette an absolute inspiration.  It's been a highly competitive experience.  There are some wonderful stories behind each of the challenges you've all had.  And I've got to say that, I hope I put this right, I would like to believe after this experience I've learnt something and I am a better person that has a bit of an understanding of some of the challenges. And good on you, it's been a fantastic experience and I know that that focus is going to continue sort of as it is now and that is a great credit to all of you.  And tonight's performances and to be able to present some gold medals to Australian victors, it is quite an experience.  I've had some fantastic experiences as Prime Minister, but to hang a gold medal around the neck of an Australian winner takes some beating.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>[Ends] </p>
