8 May 1997 ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
AUSTRALIA-ASIA SOCIETY<br />
" AUSTRALIA AND ASIA: AN ENDURING ENGAGEMENT"<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Hugh for those very warm words of introduction, to Dick<br />
Woolcott, to Ambassador Platt, to Gareth Evans representing the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, your Excellencies, other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is an immense privilege for me to be here tonight to open the AustralAsia Centre of<br />
the Asia Society and it gives me the opportunity to speak to you directly about an issue<br />
of enormous importance to our country and that is our relations with the nations of<br />
Asia. The Asia Society is the pre-eminent non-government American body concerned<br />
with relations between the United States and the nations of the Asia region. For<br />
years now it has played a major role in promoting those linkages and the centre that we<br />
launch tonight will help improve dialogue on Asia between Australia and the United<br />
States and it will make in its own way yet another contribution to the very important<br />
associations between the United States and Australia and serve again to underline the<br />
common destiny of the United States and Australia within the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The Centre will draw also on the experience of the Asia Society to strengthen<br />
understanding in Australia of the nations of Asia. It will complement the efforts of<br />
other existing Australian institutions like the Asia Australia Institute, Asia Link and the<br />
regional studies centres in our universities.<br />
I congratulate Hugh Morgan and Nick Platt for their initiative and energy in bringing<br />
together the AustralAsia Centre and bringing about its inauguration tonight. As he<br />
mentioned Hugh Morgan recently accompanied me on my visit to China as part of a<br />
very high level business delegation. It was a very successful visit and it was an<br />
effective demonstration to our hosts of the joint determination and the joint<br />
commitment of the business community of Australia and the Australian Government to<br />
building even closer links with the nations of Asia. </p>
<p>I believe that under the direction of Richard Woolcott, who brings an unparalleled<br />
wealth of diplomatic experience, particularly in terms of our relations with the nations<br />
of Asia that this centre will well and truly flourish. The Centre is formed, ladies and<br />
gentlemen, at an Important time in the history of Australia's engagement with Asia.<br />
We are living through a period of economic transformation that really been without<br />
parallel since the Industrial Revolution more than two centuries ago. Economic<br />
globalisation, technological advance and more open trading arrangements are<br />
transforming patterns of production, employment and opportunity around the world.<br />
It is a transformation from which no modern economy is, or can even imagine it can be<br />
immune. Australia is therefore equipping itself as a nation to meet the challenges and to<br />
seize the opportunities of the 2 1st century.<br />
There can be no argument at all that a principal task of my government is the continued<br />
pursuit of economic reform. Those in our midst and elsewhere who say that the<br />
reform process has gone too far are not only wrong but their nostrums, if accepted,<br />
would condemn Australia to a bleak and fearful future. The task of modern<br />
government is to maintain the momentum for the changes which are necessary whilst<br />
to the extent that it is possible to cushion the personal and social consequences of that<br />
change. That is why the focus of the Coalition in government will continue to be<br />
standing up for Australia in a world where the competition for investment, growth and<br />
jobs is increasingly fierce.<br />
Our focus will continue to be on improving Australia's capacity to compete<br />
internationally through a comprehensive economic and social policy reform agenda.<br />
Our focus will continue to be on increasing our national savings and the<br />
competitiveness of our industries and enterprises. Our focus will continue to be on<br />
helping families and small businesses and it will continue to be on expanding<br />
opportunities for younger Australians and providing greater security for older ones.<br />
That is the course that my Government has chartered and on which it will continue.<br />
Australia's engagement in her region plays a vital part in my Government's overall<br />
strategy. In discussing that engagement I am going to make no apology for raising<br />
first and foremost, economic factors but I do not pretend that they are alone, the<br />
essence of the association between Australia and the nations of Asia. If we are to<br />
enjoy in this country better living standards and if we are to create the jobs we need,<br />
economic growth is essential. Given the size of Australia's domestic market, exports<br />
are vital and indispensable to our growth. In the past year, our exports grew more<br />
than twice as fast as the economy as a whole. Moreover, surveys of small companies<br />
and exporters show that those which export are more likely to be hiring employees and<br />
paying higher wages. The markets of Asia are growing fast. During the past decade<br />
more than half the world's economic growth has come from East Asia. In the next few<br />
years, it will continue to grow at least twice as fast as the rest of the world.<br />
Already nearly 60 per cent of our exports now go to East Asia. Seven out of our ten<br />
top export markets are in East Asia.<br />
It follows that one of the most decisive influences on our standard of living and the<br />
capacity of our economy to provide worthwhile jobs for our children will be our<br />
success in exporting our goods and services to the nations of Asia. In the first place </p>
<p>that will require us to produce high-quality products that are internationally<br />
competitive and to maintain a reputation as a reliable supplier.<br />
Success will also crucially depend on improving our knowledge of our region, our<br />
understanding of its markets and our capacity to operate in them and a deep and<br />
greater understanding of the region's people. We are indeed fortunate that more and<br />
more Australians particularly young ones are studying Asian languages and are<br />
learning about the history, culture and economies of our neighbours. Our ties cannot<br />
just be economic. As our economy becomes more integrated with our neighbours',<br />
our stake in their security rises and our mutual understanding must grow.<br />
Moreover, the pursuit of our economic interests in the region cannot be divorced from<br />
acceptance by the countries of our region that we are worthwhile and valuable<br />
partners. That means making a commitment a national commitment to developing<br />
closer ties with our region. It means welcoming visitors and investment from Asian<br />
nations. It means valuing our migrant communities and in particular it means saluting<br />
the massive and enduring contribution made to the culture and the future of Australia<br />
by those hundreds of thousands of Australians of Asian descent who have contributed<br />
so much to the development of the modern Australia.<br />
It is impossible, ladies and gentlemen, to imagine a prosperous and successful Australia<br />
which is not deeply engaged with Asia. Those who propose putting up the shutters<br />
could not be more wrong. Against this background, let me say a few words about<br />
some of the propositions put recently in public debate by the Member for Oxley, Mrs<br />
Hanson. Like any other Australian citizen, she has a right to be heard. Personal<br />
attacks and mindless drowning out of her views are not only unAustralian but they feed<br />
sympathy for her but she has equally to be prepared to have her views tested, their<br />
accuracy assessed and their substance analysed.<br />
She cannot have it both ways. She enjoys freedom to express her views. Equally, she<br />
has to be accountable for those views. She cannot evade responsibility for the<br />
consequences of her statements. This is all the more so because she now claims to lead<br />
a political party. She is wrong when she suggests that Aboriginals are not<br />
disadvantaged. She is wrong when she says that Australia is in danger of being<br />
swamped by Asians. She is wrong to seek scapegoats for society's problems. She is<br />
wrong when she denigrates foreign investment, because its withdrawal would cost<br />
Australian jobs. She is wrong when she claims that Australia is headed for civil war.<br />
She is wrong in having not repudiated the views of her supporters who have called for<br />
the legalisation of the type of semi automatic weapon that Martin Bryant used to cut<br />
down the lives of 35 people at Port Arthur.<br />
The political campaign mounted by the Member for Oxley seeks to exploit fear and<br />
instability without offering solutions or hope. As best I can discern them, her policies<br />
do not provide a positive response to the challenge of boosting jobs and growth, of<br />
revitalising our regions, of strengthening our families, of reducing our national debt<br />
and of providing greater security in people's lives. </p>
<p>They have nothing to do with meeting the challenge as our parents and grandparents<br />
did before us of passing on to the next generation of Australians an even better,<br />
stronger and more united Australian society than was handed over to us. None of<br />
these goals, my friends, will be achieved through empty populism or cheap<br />
sloganeering. None will be achieved through bitter and divisive recriminations. They<br />
will only be achieved through constructive and consistent purpose and through<br />
adjusting to new realities in ways that reflect what is best in Australia's past.<br />
I want to make it clear to you tonight that under my Government, Australia's future<br />
will be built on hope, openness, confidence and Australian values not a sour, bitter,<br />
narrow-minded view of both our past and our future.<br />
In responding to the views of the Member for Oxley, it would be a serious mistake to<br />
attack those who are apparently attracted to her as bigoted, narrow-minded and racist.<br />
A few, no doubt, are. Most, however, are not.<br />
The fact is that Australia is a deeply tolerant, fair-minded and generous society.<br />
Discrimination on the basis of a person's racial or ethnic origin is offensive to all<br />
decent Australians. Every Australian, regardless of colour, race or creed, is entitled to<br />
walk our streets, ride our buses and trains, play sport on our fields and pursue their<br />
work with confidence, utterly free of discrimination, vilification or insult. Every<br />
Australian, regardless of background, is entitled to be treated with total respect and<br />
total dignity. All decent Australians agree with that, and find repulsive any violation of<br />
that code of national tolerance.<br />
The appeal the Member for Oxley has temporarily achieved lies not so much in the<br />
belief that she articulates alternatives for Australia clearly she does not. Rather, she<br />
echoes concerns about the pace of change and the pressures that parts of our<br />
community are under. These concerns as distinct from her responses, deserve the most<br />
sensitive understanding and the government is committed to giving them a serious and<br />
effective response. She also echoes long-smouldering resentments about attitudes<br />
which have been imposed upon the majority of the Australian community without that<br />
majority feeling it has even had an opportunity of debating those issues.<br />
In part, the 1996 Federal election result represented a repudiation of the stultifying<br />
political correctness which had afflicted so many areas of the Australian polity during<br />
the previous decade. Many Australians for example, resent the negative view of our<br />
history and the Australian achievement which has become so standard in recent years.<br />
Those same Australians resent the constant claim that our history has been little more<br />
than a litany of racism, sexism and imperial triumphalism.<br />
Those same Australians resent the plaintive way in which so many have encouraged us<br />
in the past to approach our association with the nations of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
They resent the suggestion that Australia has to change its identity in order to play an<br />
effective role in our region. The truth is that we go to that association as contributors<br />
as well as beneficiaries. </p>
<p>I know why some Australians have stopped to listen to the Member for Oxley. I say to<br />
them, however, she has no answers to your problems. The Hanson cure would be<br />
worse than the disease.<br />
It is worth reminding both Australians and the people of the region of two striking<br />
features about Australia's engagement with the region. First, it has been a two-way<br />
street. We do not come as a supplicant to the regional association because we have<br />
brought much to it. Australia has been a dependable friend and an important economic<br />
and security partner to many countries in the region. One has only to mention the<br />
Colombo Plan and APEC to recall the continuity and scale of Australia's contribution.<br />
Australian exports of energy and raw materials helped make possible Japan's dramatic<br />
industrial take-off Australia's record for tolerance and acceptance is regarded as an<br />
example to the world. Under Malcolm Fraser's Government, Australia accepted more<br />
Indochinese refugees on a per capita basis than any other nation in the world.<br />
I would also make the point that Australia's willingness to take in people from all over<br />
the world, including Asia, has been richly repaid by the contribution these immigrants<br />
and refugees have subsequently made to Australia.<br />
The second striking feature of our engagement, as these examples show, is its<br />
longevity and continuity. The importance of our engagement with our region has been<br />
a consistent theme of Australian governments since the Second World War, if not<br />
before. This has been true for governments from both sides of politics and tonight I<br />
acknowledge the contribution of my two predecessors as Labor Prime Ministers of<br />
Australia for the contribution that they made to building better links between Australia<br />
and the nations of the region. My Government is determined to continue that tradition.<br />
It is committed to advancing Australia's national interests in our region. There will,<br />
however, as inevitably is the case, be some important differences in approach if not<br />
commitment from that of our predecessors.<br />
We will, for example, be willing to listen a little more to what some in the region are<br />
saying. During his recent visit to Australia, the Japanese prime minister, Mr<br />
Hashimoto, made some important proposals to advance Australia's relationship with<br />
Japan and to highlight Australia's role in the region. This is a healthy and welcome<br />
development and we will have the confidence to welcome and respond to an initiative<br />
from a friend like Japan-as well as from others. We do not think that the only good<br />
initiatives can come from Australia.<br />
On the issue of human rights, Australia will always stand up for her beliefs and values.<br />
As Prime Minister I will never do less but I do not see that public hectoring or<br />
lecturing other countries about their shortcomings or differences from us is appropriate<br />
behaviour for a neighbour or indeed likely to promote our interests or our values.<br />
Equally, Australia herself does not expect to be on the receiving end of lectures. We<br />
have the same right to our values and sensitivities and the same right to demand<br />
respect for them. Mutual respect has to be a two-way thing.<br />
My Government has put considerable effort into pursuing Australia's interests in the<br />
region. My own role in this has been to establish good working relationships with my<br />
counterparts In some of the countries of most importance to Australia. We have made </p>
<p>good progress in improving the frameworks within which Australia and the business<br />
community in particular might better pursue their goals.<br />
My first bilateral visit was to Indonesia, our largest neighbour, an important and<br />
growing market for Australia, and a partner with which we share many economic,<br />
strategic and other interests as is reflected in our close cooperation in APEC and our<br />
security agreement. I made clear to President Soeharto my continued commitment to<br />
strengthening that relationship.<br />
I have already mentioned the good developments that are taking place in our<br />
longstanding relationship with Japan, which I also visited last year. Both Mr<br />
Hashimoto and I are committed to ensuring that our partnership becomes ever more<br />
effective in the region and I had as you know the great pleasure of hosting a very<br />
successful visit from Mr Hashimoto only two weeks ago. In Manila last year at the<br />
APEC leaders meeting, I reaffirmed Australia's commitment to the economic goals of<br />
APEC which is held by my Government.<br />
In China recently, I proposed we form a partnership in growth. Australia has an<br />
immensely important role to play in supplying China with the resources and energy to<br />
fuel its future growth. Indeed I believe Australia can play in China a similar role to the<br />
one we have played in the growth of Japan and Korea. Australia can also provide the<br />
financial, legal and other services for which China has a growing need as its economy<br />
modernises and becomes more sophisticated. The seniority of the business leaders<br />
who came with me to China sent a very strong signal that the Australian Government<br />
and business community want to work closely together in building our economic links<br />
with China. The Chinese Premier, Li Peng, and I agreed to have regular summits in<br />
order to ensure that Australia and China have good and direct communications at a<br />
political level. I also proposed that we upgrade and broaden the scope of our<br />
ministerial dialogue on economic issues.<br />
Since my meeting, Australia has welcomed visits from a number of very senior Chinese<br />
leaders. You will be pleased to hear that China's Vice Premier, Mr Zhu Rongji, will<br />
visit Australia later this month.<br />
My talks with the Premier Goh Chok Tong in Singapore have confirmed the vitality of<br />
Australia's links with that country and I hope also this year to be able to visit India and<br />
Malaysia, and next year Korea. My contacts in the region have left me optimistic<br />
about Australia's prospects in our region and also immensely optimistic about the<br />
prospects for growth and development in the region as a whole.<br />
Asia's economic growth is good for the people of the region, good for Australia and<br />
good for the world. It is true that this same growth is producing major changes in the<br />
strategic outlook of our region and although potential sources of conflict remain over<br />
Taiwan and on the Korean peninsula. But greater prosperity has for the most part<br />
improved the prospects of stability within countries of the region. It has benefited our<br />
security by raising everyone's stake in the stability of the region. The question is how<br />
does the region ensure that this state of affairs continues. Part of the answer lies in<br />
doing what we can to remove the constraints on economic growth. This is why<br />
Australia's role as a supplier of resources, services, technology and finance is so </p>
<p>important. That is why the work of APEC in bringing down barriers to trade and<br />
investment and helping remove bottlenecks in infrastructure, capital flows, and human<br />
resources is so important.<br />
A second part of the answer lies in doing what we can to maintain the region's<br />
stability. Stability is necessary if countries of the region are to be able to devote their<br />
energies to meeting the common challenges of education, economic reform and raising<br />
the living standards of their people. My Government has been very active in that<br />
regard. We are committed to maintaining the Australian Defence Force's capabilities<br />
and improving its effectiveness. My Government has reinvigorated our alliance with<br />
the United States. That alliance, along with those of Japan and Korea, support the<br />
engagement of the United States in our region and are therefore vital to regional<br />
stability. We are committed to maintaining effective security links with our neighbours<br />
through the Five Power arrangements with Malaysia and Singapore, the security<br />
agreement with Indonesia and other bilateral arrangements.<br />
Australia is also playing a prominent role in the development of sturdier regional<br />
frameworks to promote regional dialogue and understanding on security matters, in<br />
particular the ASEAN Regional Forum. These activities do not reflect a fear on the<br />
Government's part of any particular threat. I especially want to emphasise that it is in<br />
no-one's interests to treat China as a threat. We want to see China fully involved in<br />
regional and global institutions. It is also in China's interests to see these strengthened.<br />
China too needs to assure itself of open markets and a stable international trading<br />
system if its economy is to keep growing. It has an interest in the countries of the<br />
region being confident about future stability.<br />
My Government believes its policies will contribute to our region's strategic resilience.<br />
They will help provide us and our neighbours with greater confidence that we can<br />
navigate safely a period of great economic, political and strategic change. They will<br />
help ensure that the economic progress of the past 10 or 20 years is not disrupted.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, attempts to define Asia, Asianness and Australia's place in it are<br />
interesting, but they do tend to produce more heat than light, often in the media.<br />
Worse, they have left a degree of confusion or even resentment among many in our<br />
community about issues on which there need be no confusion at all. I do not want to<br />
get into definitions. Rather, I would like to finish my remarks by reiterating that our<br />
links with our region will be vital in every way to Australia's political, social and<br />
economic future. In building those links, Australia does not have to choose between<br />
her geography and her history. Our history and our links with the West make a unique<br />
contribution to the region. The recent advances we have made in our relationships<br />
with Japan, China, Indonesia and the United States demonstrate this, as do visits to<br />
Australia in the past six months by President Clinton, Mr Hashimoto, Chancellor Kohl<br />
and shortly the Chinese Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Australia can be immensely confident about its place in our region. We bring many<br />
strengths to bear. Australia has economically, politically and strategically an<br />
important role to play. We are a stable democracy. We are located near a major<br />
source of the world's great economic growth. The size of our economy, our vast<br />
resources, and our technological capabilities make us a very attractive economic<br />
partner. Our high levels of education and our innovativeness give us the capacity to<br />
use our assets effectively.<br />
We do not bring to our association with the region any of the colonial baggage of<br />
others. We enjoy the security inherent in being an island continent and from having an<br />
effective defence force. Our stability, alliances and defence links with our neighbours<br />
contribute to our region's stability. Our credibility makes us an effective actor in<br />
international forums. Our cultural and ethnic diversity gives us a great opportunity to<br />
consolidate our personal ties with the countries of our region and the building blocks<br />
years ago of such great innovations as the Colombo Plan have meant that the network<br />
of personal associations between this country and the nations of the region are vast and<br />
deep and I was reminded of this in a very personal way when I attended a gathering of<br />
the Alumni of Australian Universities during my recent visit to Singapore and to spend<br />
an hour amongst literally hundreds of Singaporeans who had been educated at<br />
Australian universities brought home to me both the longevity of the Association and<br />
its intensely personal character and it was an object lesson, an object reminder to me<br />
that the greatest, the most enduring and the most effective bonds between any nations<br />
are those that are built on people to people contacts and no number of trade missions,<br />
no number of Prime Ministerial visits can ever equal the value of the experiences, the<br />
very positive experiences of those thousands of people when being educated in<br />
Australia, the contribution and the value of that experience to building friendships<br />
between our two nations.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, as we go into the next century. my Government is committed to<br />
using these strengths to build on a long history of honourable participation by Australia<br />
in our region. I congratulate those who have formed the centre. I thank the Asia<br />
Society of the United States for its interest and its activity and I very genuinely thank<br />
the businesses of Australia who have contributed so magnificently to make the<br />
foundation of this centre a reality. It is an important mission. There is no geographic<br />
linkage more important to the future of Australia than our linkage with the nations of<br />
the Asia Pacific region. We are forever part of this part of the world. It is forever the<br />
destiny of Australia to see her future bound up with the aspirations of the hundreds of<br />
millions of people of the region and all of the energies and all of our policies must<br />
always be directed towards ensuring in the national interest that those links are open<br />
and fuilsome and generous and directed towards the maximisation of the benefits that<br />
we can all derive from that very important association.<br />
Thank you. </p>
