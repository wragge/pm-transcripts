PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
RELOCATION OF COMMENCEMENT COLUMN<br />
CANBERRA 12 MARCH 1988<br />
Exactly 75 years ago today, the fifth Prime Minister of<br />
Australia, Andrew Fisher Australia's second Labor Prime<br />
minister laid one of the three stones set in the base of<br />
what was planned to be a monument to the commencement of the<br />
national capital.<br />
It is an honour for me to stand here today and, as the<br />
counterpart of my distinguished predecessor Andrew Fisher,<br />
to play my part in this re-enactment ceremony.<br />
Our presence here today serves as a tribute to those men and<br />
women of 1913 who inaugurated the development of our<br />
national capital. But we are here not just to commemorate<br />
but to celebrate to celebrate the success of their vision<br />
and the vigour of" the city they established.<br />
It is hard to imagine what this site would have looked like<br />
years ago. Federation was an experiment just 12 years<br />
old, and during those years there had been more than enough<br />
heated debates about where to site the national capital of<br />
the new Australian nation.<br />

The limestone Plains must have seemed remote from the<br />
existing cenElres of civilisation and the participants in<br />
this ceremony had in some cases spent days journeying here<br />
to this spot, apparently stuck in the middle of the bush.<br />
The hills, trees, and wide open spaces an emptiness<br />
scarcely broken by the few homesteads that had already been<br />
built must have made even the most confident among them<br />
slightly uncertain as to whether they were really<br />
inaugurating the leading city of the nation.<br />
But today, qf course, Canberra is an established city, a<br />
magnet for national and international tourists, the<br />
headquarters of many national organisations, and, quite<br />
simply, one of the most superb urban environments for. a<br />
quarter of a million residents. 005012 </p>
<p>2.<br />
It is highly appropriate that we should be celebrating<br />
Canberra's 75th anniversary in the year of our Bicentennial<br />
because the way this city has grown in size, stature and<br />
style is illustrative of the way our nation has developed.<br />
Canberra is the symbol of the success of Federation; a<br />
fitting home for the institutions of our democratic life,<br />
and an encouragement for our future national growth.<br />
In May we will be opening the latest and in many ways the<br />
greatest of Canberra's national buildings the new<br />
Parliament House, in whose shadow we virtually stand.<br />
It was the construction of that magnificent building which<br />
created the need for the relocation of the commencement<br />
column to this spot.<br />
I believe Andrew Fisher and other participants in this<br />
ceremony in 1913 had they known this site was destined<br />
for greater things would forgive us for correcting their<br />
judgement as to the best site for this monument.<br />
So above all, today's ceremony is about vision and<br />
confidence in the future.<br />
Australia faces a different range of problems today from<br />
those faced by our predecessors problems relating to<br />
changing economic and industrial realities throughout the<br />
world problems of matching needs to resources and<br />
problems of achieving social justice in a changing and more<br />
complex world.<br />
But if we can meet those challenges with the vision,<br />
confidence, and the spirit with which our forebears created<br />
this national capital, we can be sure of success.<br />
