FOR PRESS 3. AUGUST. .19.77<br />
DEATH OF. PRESIDENT MAKARIOS<br />
I wish to express profound regret at the news of the death of<br />
His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios III, President of the<br />
Republic of Cyprus. In Archbishop Makarios, the world and<br />
the Commonwealth have lost a statesman of great eminence who<br />
had long personified-his people's quest for identity and<br />
independence, and had played a unique role in his country's<br />
national and international affairs.<br />
I was honoured to meet privately with President Makarios during<br />
the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London<br />
and at that meeting to renew an invitation to him to make a<br />
State Visit to Australia. This visit would have been a fitting<br />
culmination to the development of the longstanding and excellent<br />
relations between Australia and Cyprus, which is the original<br />
homeland of so many Australians.<br />
The Government had greatly looked forward to this visit by<br />
President Makarios later this year, and I am sure all<br />
Australians will share my sadness that it cannot take place.<br />
I have conveyed to the Acting President of the Republic of<br />
Cyprus, Mr. Kyprianou, on behalf of the Government and the<br />
people of* Australia, an expression of deep sympathy with the<br />
Government and the people of Cyprus at the loss of their<br />
President. </p>
