THIRD NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE<br />
INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS<br />
SYDNEY. N. S. WX. .11JUNE J. 970<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Thank you, Mr. President, for your introduction. I cannot<br />
remember the long list which you gave of those to whomn I shouild address<br />
my remarks. May I confine it to the Prime Minister of New Zealand,<br />
Mir. Holyoake and the other distinguished persons who are present.<br />
Gentlemen, you have had a long day and you have listened, I<br />
think, to seven speakers from the four corners of the earth, all of them<br />
men with an international reputation, all of them men~ with something of<br />
significance to say to you. And I think that their presence on this occasion<br />
has been a mark of the status which this Institute has reached.<br />
Mr. President, may I congratulate you and your Institute on<br />
becoming an Institute in its own right today and no long-qer just a division of<br />
its founding father, the British Institute of Directors. 1 think that this has<br />
come about with the encouragement and the support of the British Institute.<br />
It is the kind of process which has been going on in many fields ever since<br />
Australian colonies became States, and the States became a Federation, and<br />
the Federation became a nation, and this Institute becamne an Institute in its<br />
own right. I wish you well, Sir, you and your Institute as you set course<br />
on your own, as an Institute on your own. And may I congratulate you, Sir,<br />
on the part your personal leadership has played in the very rapid growth<br />
of this Institute. I know that you are a successful helmsman, both in business<br />
and in public affairs and on " Balandra", although I do seem to recall that<br />
in a recent Sydney to Hobart yacht race you were outpointed by a politician:<br />
In any case, Sir I thank you for giving me a forum where I<br />
can talk to so many key members of our commercial, -financial and industrial<br />
world face to face without having to talk to them throughi the sometimes<br />
somewhat dubious media of third parties who interpret what one says through<br />
various public media. ./ 2 </p>
<p>I have been provided tonight because I really have, over the<br />
last week or ten days had scarcely one minute to myself I have been provided<br />
tonight with a speech that was written for me by the Treasury. As one<br />
would expect, it is a very careful speech. It is one which seeks to cover<br />
every eventuality. kt is one which, as far as possible, seeks to say nothing<br />
which can be held up against it in the future. And consequently, except<br />
in parts, I don't propose to give it. I will from time to time be ad libbing<br />
and speaking " off the cuff".<br />
But some of it I will give because I thfiL it might be of<br />
advantage if I went back a little to look at the recent history of this nation<br />
to see what has been achieved in that period of time, to see where we stand<br />
today and put to you what I believe to be the pressing problems for this<br />
future decade. Ten years ago, in this country and in thle world outside it,<br />
there was much doubt as to where Australia was going and as to what the<br />
future of Australia would be. At that time when some of us m. any of you<br />
in this room, I think began to glimpse the posibilities of the future,<br />
there were others who said Australia would never become a great<br />
industrial country, Australia could never sustain a great population,<br />
Australia should remain a hewer of wood and a drawer of water and a<br />
grower of wool for the rest of the world.<br />
Yet three years later in 1963 an economic survey put<br />
out by the Treasury said this<br />
" Over the past ten years, and especially over the past three<br />
years, Australia has achieved -its greatest breakthrough in<br />
point of resources since the crossing ofZ the Blue Mcuntains<br />
a hundred and fifty years ago. That earlier event opened<br />
the first doorway to the pastoral and agricultural wealth<br />
of the continent on which our growth has since been built.<br />
But until not very long ago it was commonly held that<br />
Australia would not be a great industrial1 nation and therefore<br />
could not support a great population. The quick succession<br />
of rich mineral discoveries, bauxite, copper, iron ore and<br />
now oil, go far to dispel this view. We do not yet have in<br />
adequate quantities all the essentials for well-rounded<br />
development, arid in the background lies our deficiency of<br />
water, likely perhaps to prove the costliest and most stubborn<br />
of barriers to large-scale expansion. Yet, taken with the<br />
resources already known, these new riches beyond doubt lift<br />
the horizons of Australian growth quite incalculably. </p>
<p>This was written seven years ago not by me but in a Treasury<br />
Bulletin, and I am bound to say that it has raised my eotimation of the<br />
Treasury greatly to read it.<br />
That was a confident statement at that time, and some thought<br />
over-confident, but the years have shown that it was true if anything,<br />
understated. All the resources listed in it have been chown to exist, many<br />
of them in quantities at that time unthought of, and many new resources have<br />
been added to the list.<br />
The problem of water in the development of Australia remains<br />
water for industry, water for creating a pleasant environment for those<br />
Australians who must live in the towns and cities that miust grow in our<br />
North; water for protection against fire and drought and famine in our<br />
rural areas. Yet even this is not as intransigent a p~ roblem as it appeared<br />
seven years ago, for now atomic power, desalination, new water resources<br />
proposals and programmes offer a hope that even this barrier will be removed.<br />
I think, Sir, that today only a chronic and cofirmed peosimist would say<br />
we lack the foundation for really large-scale industrial development in<br />
Australia. In short, the debunkers and the knockers ten years ago have<br />
been shown to be completely wrong.<br />
But might there not be another problem before us? Having<br />
shown these things to be wrong by a certain amount of luck and a considerable<br />
amount of effort, there still could be a risk of another mood entering into<br />
Australian thought, potentially as dangerous as that mood which said years<br />
ago we never would grow great. I am referring to a disposition to believe that<br />
most of our underlying problems have been solved because of the progress<br />
we have made, because of the opportunities that have opened before us; a<br />
disposition to believe that the progress we expect, the progress these new<br />
resources have made possible, will come more or less of its own accord<br />
and without the brains and effort and hard work-and sweat which ultimately<br />
are the only bases on which progress can be made.<br />
There has been a spreading of affluence amongst our society,<br />
and some of those to whom it has spread not tClose who took part in the<br />
real development, but those who indirectly profited from it must perhaps<br />
think it came rather easily and that it will continue to come easily.<br />
This is a mood which, if Australia is to grow as quickly<br />
as it can, we must eschew. You must see that this mocod does not enter<br />
into the Australian consciousness, because I am talking to an audience of<br />
men who direct companies, who know that when one problem is solved,<br />
another problem arises; who'. know that nothing is easily done, who in </p>
<p>4.<br />
their everyday lives must say " Right, we have got over that hurdle, there<br />
is another one in front of us. It will not be easy to get over it. We must<br />
continue with the effort that we have put in. ThiB is done, and I think<br />
the leadership for it can come in great part from you. Then the possible<br />
mood of complacency into which Australia could fall will not become the<br />
danger which it otherwise might be.<br />
I said that many of our problems had been overcome and they<br />
have, but there are still many before us. May I enumerate to you those<br />
problems as I see them, and Derhaps take this opportunity to explain to<br />
you why the Government has done some of the things it has done to try<br />
and overcome these problems.<br />
We, in Australia, must have vast and increasing amounts of<br />
overseas capital if we are to develop. Yet we must also try to see that as<br />
much as possible of Australian industrial development is in the hands of<br />
Australians, remains in the hands of Australians and grows in the hands<br />
of Australians. Our nation is going through a period o! industrial expansion,<br />
of great mineral development. We need large and coatinuing infusions of<br />
capital from overseas in order to sustain this, and in the last five years,<br />
one-sixth of all such capital investment in Australia has come from<br />
overseas. And, Sir, inevitably that infusion of capital in our larger<br />
industries brings with it a greater degree of overseas ownership and control,<br />
both of our mineral developments and ultimately of the processing of our<br />
minerals, which is a highly capital intensive enterprise.<br />
And if I may give you some examples o! what has been<br />
happening, overseas investment in mining five years ago . was $ 34 million<br />
in the year. It has risen to somr-ething like $ 250 million and Australians'<br />
control of production in minerals alone has dropped i-n that time from<br />
63 percent to 47 percent. At the same ti-me, Australian requirement to<br />
service existing capital by remitting abroad has risen from 8. 3 percent<br />
to 10. 5 percent of our export earnings. This has happiened in the last<br />
five years. And there is a build-up of commitments 1or the future because<br />
inccm= earned in Australia by overseas investment Cand ploughed back into<br />
AusL* alia has more than doubled in five years.<br />
I do not mention these facts in order to complain about them.<br />
We are glad about them because these are prices we can afford to pay for<br />
the development we must have in the time scale in which, in this world,<br />
we need that development. We can afford to pay it, because the benefits<br />
which come to us from it as fifty percent shareholders in every enterprise<br />
because of taxation and other benefits, do come to us, and we could not<br />
develop as we should without this influx of capital. So 1 don't complain.<br />
But though they are prices we can afford to pay, they are not in their<br />
entirety prices we should pay unless we must. And so, as a government,<br />
we have tried to provide the opportunity to retain as much Australian </p>
<p>ownership and as much Australian control as we can, provided we don't<br />
iiuaibit the inflow of capital, and provided we don't inhibit growth.<br />
And to that end we have adopted a number of policies. We<br />
have adopted a " takeover code". We have adopted a guidelines policy for<br />
borrowings in Australia. We will be laying on the table of the House of<br />
Representatives this week for discussion by you, and all those interested,<br />
proposals for convertible notes, so that those Australians who have money<br />
to invest and who must get an income from it, will have an opportunity to<br />
invest it in notes, get an income from it, and have an opportunity to convert<br />
it to equity at some later stage.<br />
And we have introduced now into law what appears to have<br />
been a rather controversial proposal for an Australian Industry Development<br />
Corporation. Sir, this Corporation is designed to borrow abroad on behalf<br />
of Australian companies which ask it to do so and only on behalf of<br />
Australian companies which ask it to do so; and cornmanies which it judges<br />
to be viable and which might not themselves be able to borrow and which,<br />
because they were unable to borrow, might have to surrender equity to an<br />
overseas partner. Its objectives are simply those, and I do not think that<br />
those objectives could be attacked by anyone with an interest in Australian<br />
development and Australian ownership of development.<br />
After all, although the interest rates may from time to time<br />
be high in the Eurodollar market or the United States, if Hamersley can<br />
borrow at 10 or 11 percent on these markets and makie a profit from it,<br />
then why shouldn't an Australian company be able to do the same if it can<br />
find a corporation of the stature to act for it? And this is what the Australian<br />
Industry Corporation is all about.<br />
It will have no power to interfere with a company or to act<br />
financially on its behalf unless it is asked. It will be subject to the same taxes<br />
as other companies engaged in its field. It will compete on equal terms<br />
and it can't do any more than compete. It cannot dominate. In fact, Sir, it<br />
will offer a choice to a borrower and, after all, the right of choice, as<br />
everybody in this room would agree, is one of the essentials of a freely<br />
growing economy, whether it is a choice of the bank from whom one can<br />
borrow, the company with whom one will go into partnership or the lines of<br />
action one will take as directors of a company.<br />
And I believe, Sir, that this Corporation, under the control<br />
as it will be of directors drawn from private enterprie, will help to<br />
retain the greatest possible Australian ownership of growing Australian<br />
enterprises. It won't interfere with the inflow of capital from abroad that we<br />
need and must have, and indeed, I think it will be an adjunct to the growth<br />
of Australian private enterprise and will help it grow as Australian<br />
private enterprise. That is the way in which the Government has approached<br />
one of the problems we see before us now which is, having reached this stage of<br />
our development, more and more capital is required, more and more<br />
capital we will take; but we want to see as much of it as possible retained<br />
in Australian hands for economic or, if you like, for nationalist reasons. </p>
<p>What are some of the other problems that now face us that<br />
will nct be easily overcome?, I, without putting them in their proper order,<br />
would say that the problems of rural industries now and in the future are<br />
perhaps the most significant. I do not see how we can possibly go on<br />
growing more and more or indeed as much, of the commodities which the<br />
world either does not want or is not prepared to pay for at a rate which<br />
will cover the cost of pr-oduction. And with the very possible entry of the<br />
United Kingdom into the European Economic Community, this problemn<br />
looms before us with even greater urgency.<br />
Subsidies can be a palliative, but only a palliative, not an<br />
answer, and this problem will niot go away because of' industrial development,<br />
because of mineral development, because of the application of the minds of<br />
you gentlemen to your own businesses. This is a problem I merely flag<br />
at this stage as one of great significance to the future. I can't do more<br />
than flag it at this stage, because we are talking about it very deeply in<br />
Cabinet itself, and I wouldn't want to say anything wihich was in advance<br />
of what Cabinet might say. But it is one of enormous significance.<br />
We have in this country and this affects business too<br />
the problems inherent in a federal nation. You will all have heard various<br />
epithets applied to me, one a! which is " centralist". The other day I said<br />
I didn't quite know what it meant and I don't know now-, in spite of the<br />
" Sydney Morning Herald" endeavouring to tell me in one of its editorials.<br />
But there is in a federal systemn, which I think is the best system under<br />
which to live, always inherent difficulties between governments, and those<br />
difficulties often wash over on to the companies who have to carry out their<br />
enterprises in Australia. If somebody wants to export iron ore in Western<br />
Australia and they can deal with one government to do that, then they have<br />
to decide at what price they will be allowed to export it, and they have to<br />
deal with another government to do that. And so it goes.<br />
But these problems themselves will be worked out, I think,<br />
within this framework that we cannot and must not and will not have<br />
six separate nations in the boundaries of this continenl-t. We will have<br />
one nation, but we will decentralise the running of that nation as f ar as<br />
it is humanly possible to do so. This is the bes-t way to bring not only<br />
the people but the leaders of industry such as you into the operation of<br />
the economy of this country.<br />
Can I give an illustration I hope I dor't try your patience<br />
an illustration of the approach that I have to this matter, by referring to<br />
something you might have read about in the papers from time to time,<br />
quite wrongly, quite loosely called offshore minerals legislation. Because<br />
I think that does illustrate the approach which I and my Government have<br />
to this affair. / 7 </p>
<p>It has been claimed that we as a central government want to<br />
take away mineral rights from the States. That is quite wrong. It has<br />
been claimed that we want to get control of all minerals, but that is quite<br />
wrong. But there exists a situation in. this nation now where nobody knows<br />
who controls, who is responsible for, the seas which lap the coasts of<br />
Australia. Nobody knows who is responsible for the resources of the<br />
seabed not only minerals but other resources. Nobody knows who is<br />
responsible for the conservation of fisheries. Nobody knows whose law<br />
runs either between the low water mark and the three-mile limit, or<br />
between the three-mile limit and the outer continental shelf. it is unknown.<br />
It is in dispute. And we believe that we should not be the only federal nation<br />
in the world that doesn't know who is responsible for these matters, and so<br />
we believe that there should be a legal decision on these matters by the<br />
High Court which has been set up for the very purpose of interpreting<br />
constitutional matters which are in doubt.<br />
Once that is done and I hope it will be I don't know what<br />
the results will be. I don't know whether it will turn out that the States<br />
own and are responsible for the seabed and for the sea above it from the<br />
low water mark to the three mile limit or from the low water mark to the<br />
outer continental shelf, or whether we are responsible for it I don't know.<br />
But I think we should know. And once that has been decided, then<br />
irrespective of the decision, we want to move into an area of co-operative<br />
federalism by saying " No matter who has got the legal responsibility, if<br />
we have got it, then let us co-operate in a federal way. You administer it.<br />
You take 60 percent of the royalties of minerals. You deal with the<br />
overseas companies who want leases. You come to us for a final<br />
decision. This is the approach to federalism which we have and which<br />
has led, 1 think unjustly, to centralism being put upon us.<br />
But if this is not done, then nobody will ever know who is<br />
responsible for what. If a tanker runs aground, ( as it did in Queensland)<br />
two miles offshore, no-one will know what government has the responsibility<br />
to see that that tanker is pumped out so that there vwill not be pollution of<br />
the area around it. No-one will know who has the right to arrest fishing<br />
vessels who are outside or inside the three-mile limit. No-one will know<br />
who controls the continental shelf which runs between us and Indonesia<br />
whether we do or whether Western Australia does. No-one will know,<br />
when New Guinea becomes independent, who is able to decide where the<br />
median line should be on the continental shelf between us and New Guinea<br />
whether the Australian Government does or Queensland does. No-one<br />
will know how to go about closing the Gulf of Carpentaria to fishing, because<br />
no-one will know who has the legal responsibility to do it. And these are<br />
matters which in the future could be of great significance to Australia.<br />
Perhaps they are not problems which directly concern you, gentlemen,<br />
but you will forgive me if I take the opportunity to expound to you some<br />
of the problems which beset me. / 8 </p>
<p>Well, what do I see for this country in this next decade?<br />
Nhat are my aspirations? What are my hopes'?<br />
I would hope to see a country in which industrial development<br />
continues at the same rate as it has. I would hope to see a country in<br />
which we process more and more of the minerals in raw state which we<br />
take from the earth. I would hope to see a country in which we clean<br />
up the environment in which we live. I would hope to see a country<br />
and indeed I must see a country, which devotes more and more of its<br />
resources and efforts to the sterile but necessary requirements of defence.<br />
I would hope to see a country which provides more and more opportunity<br />
for its citizens, enabling them to express themselves, to engage in<br />
occupations which give them satisfaction. I would hope to see us gradually<br />
moving towards satisfying the aspirations of Australians for better<br />
education, for better health, for better social services, for better roads,<br />
for all the requirements which are made on the public sector. This is<br />
what I would hope for.<br />
But I would know that government cannot do that by itself.<br />
I would know that it is the people in this room and others like them who alone<br />
could do it because I would know that the provision of these matters for the'<br />
public sector could only come out of what was produced in the private<br />
sector. I would believe that it was the task of a government to see<br />
that a climate was created in which those in the private sector were given<br />
the fullest possible opportunity to make their judgments, to reap their<br />
profits, to sustain their losses, because by this interplay in the market<br />
place, as I believe experience has shown, will come the greatest possible<br />
contribution of wealth to the country and from thiO grctest contribution of wealth<br />
to the cod~ rtrygovernment cnrtake'that which I havr-e ; d I woul. d like to see provided<br />
from the public sector.<br />
Sir, as long as I am in this position, or my successors, what<br />
we would seek to foster is not laissez-faire it is rot laissez-faire. What<br />
I would seek to foster is true competition, true private enterprise, true<br />
opportunity for individual judgments as to where a company should go and<br />
what it should do, because I believe that in that way a government and a<br />
people of a nation best benefit. We must see that as prosperity grows you<br />
are given this opportunity, and if you take it, the fruits of it are shared<br />
amongst the whole nation. This is essential.... shared in the ways of which<br />
I have spoken by a government providing health, social services, education.<br />
And in doing that, must keep a careful balance and judgement to see that<br />
that which is taken to provide these things from the government sector is<br />
not so much that it removes incentive from the private sector to retain<br />
that which it has earned.<br />
And if this careful balance can be sustained, and if we can<br />
look to each individual, each company director to acceot responsibility<br />
for his decisions, and to try to make those decisions not necessarily on<br />
the basis of'what is best for GMH is best for America", but " what is best<br />
for Australia is best for my company", as I think we can look to you, then / 9 </p>
<p>I tahink we will in this nationattain the kind of goals I have set before you.<br />
. ut I am sure when we have attained them there will be new problems rearing<br />
their head, and-what-a dull and uninspiring world it would be if that were not<br />
so. It is because I think this kind of partnership the kind of<br />
work that you do, this kind of management which we do for well or for<br />
ill is of such significance, it is because of this that I finish as I began<br />
by thanking you, Sir, for the opportunity to speak to such a representative<br />
gathering, a gathering of people who have contributed so much to the<br />
growth of this nation and who have so much more to contribute. </p>
