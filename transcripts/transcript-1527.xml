AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF' DIRECTOES? LUNCHEON,<br />
IM LBOURHE<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Halt.<br />
Mr. President and Gentlemen:<br />
I regard that as a somewhat qualified introduction but<br />
I have already been told that you will have to leave at two otclock,<br />
so I shall not be speaking to you either at the length the<br />
Treasurer finds necessary at Budget time, or as Prime Minister<br />
on a leisurely evening occasion such as I felt able to indulge<br />
my audience and myself in just on 12 months ago.<br />
It wias for me a priviledge to be chosen as the guest<br />
of honour at the first annual dinner of the first annual conference<br />
of the Australian Institute of Directors and I look back to that<br />
occasion with a great deal of pleasure. Your reference to having<br />
acquired a proprietary interest over me Mr. President, which in<br />
some other context might not have worked out so favourably, does<br />
not appear to have done me very much harm in the meantime in the<br />
eyes of the Australian electorate. If there was any blur on my<br />
national image as a result of hobnobbing with so many directors<br />
at one time on that occasion, at least the twelve months seem to<br />
have given me time to live it down.<br />
There is in Australia, I'm glad to say, a growing<br />
maturity, a growing sopilhistication, not registered always in<br />
all quarters at one and the same time, but broadly this is a<br />
generalisation I think vie can claim. Where at one time a<br />
prophet was not only without honour in his own country but a<br />
profit spelt rather differently was almost a matter of guilt,<br />
people these days realise that . ic are producing a few Australian<br />
prophets who are listened to at times abroad and can with equal<br />
advantage be heard at home, and that a profit in the well<br />
conducted industrial enterprise is a national dividend capable<br />
of being distributed through the medium of the tax mechanism<br />
through all sections of the Australian community.<br />
In one sense I am here with you as a fellow director,<br />
indeed I think I could claim to be a Chairman of Directors of<br />
the National Corporation. You mentioned my previous incumbency<br />
of the Treasury, Mr. President, that, of course, made me probably<br />
the biggest shareholder in most of the companies represented here<br />
today, so that I feel I have come not only amongst friends I<br />
hope they are still friends but I h ive coma amongst people<br />
whose language I understand and whose problems also I have had<br />
to cope with in various Ministerial capacities.<br />
Now you have enjoined me, Mr. President, that these<br />
busy, alert, brisk, intelligent executives must be springing<br />
from their seats and getting into action on behalf of the<br />
national economy by two o'clock and I'll do my best to distill<br />
such wisdom as occurs to me oil this occasion in the time which<br />
remains available to me.<br />
In the twelve months since I last met the national body<br />
much has happened. This is a continent and a nation in which<br />
much continues to happen. It is-undoubtedly the most stimulating<br />
and exciting period in our national history, and in the course of<br />
the year amongst other things I, a-s a good national chairman of<br />
the board of the National Corporation, found it necessary to give<br />
some account of my stewardship to my shareholders, to several<br />
millions of them who record a vote ( I hope not much more<br />
frequently than every three years) and to give them some account<br />
00/ 2. </p>
<p>-2<br />
of what we had in store for them over the period ahead.<br />
I think it's a good Chairman of the Board who, while giving<br />
a faithful account of what has occuired, and gives the facts<br />
about what is planned for the future, doesn't try to promiso<br />
too much. Better the people should be agreeably surprised<br />
that you have done rather more than you undertook to do,<br />
than that they should build false expectations on rosy and<br />
glowing promises which are incapable in the result of<br />
fulfilment, and that was the approach I chose to make at<br />
the time of the last national assessment.<br />
Wie set about a programme for the electorate which<br />
we felt was manageable, which would not unduly disturb the<br />
national economy and yet which continued our forward advance<br />
on a number of fronts and I am glad to be able to say that<br />
the Government having come officially and formally back into<br />
office vwe have set briskly about giving affect to those<br />
undertakings. I won't, because of the lim-itation of time,<br />
try to take you through in any detail just what we have already<br />
done and where we stand at present in relation to these mattersthat<br />
will emerge from statements made by my colleagues and<br />
certainly by the end of the current Parliamentary Session,<br />
I hope to be able to give some account of how rapidly we have<br />
advanced in all the directions which we undertook to attend to.<br />
In the fields of education, social services, housing,<br />
water conservation, beef roads, the wool -industry, tourism,<br />
which I specifically mentioned in the Policy Speech, I can<br />
tell you that action has already been put in hand, some are<br />
completed, much of it to be completed by the end of this<br />
Parliamentary Session.<br />
My colleagues and I and vie are in a sense the<br />
Directors of this National Corporation can look with pleasure<br />
and a certain measure of pride at the general state of affairs.<br />
The past year has not beon an easy one, only those of us<br />
and this includes many of you in this room who have had to<br />
grapple with quite abnormal circumstances developing in the year,<br />
realise this because for the most part the public was relatively<br />
unaffected by the problems with which we had to grapple.<br />
Internally we experienced a major drought and the effects of<br />
this are only now beginning to ease. Perhaps I could just pause<br />
there for a moment because I don't think there has been a full<br />
realisation of just what this drought meant to Australia.<br />
If you -look at it merely in terms of farm incomes,<br />
in 1964/ 65 the farm income amounted in total to $ 1,255 million.<br />
In the following, year and normally we would have expected<br />
some reasonable progression in our earnings from farm income<br />
it dropped to $ 902 million. In other words a drop of 37% in<br />
farm income, and if you carry forward as one might reasonably<br />
have been expected to do if you were planninG a business,<br />
what you would have earned h~ ad you retained the stock of cattle<br />
and sheep we possessed at that time, then we could have<br />
anticipated a drop amounting to 40% o below what we had received<br />
in the previous year and certainly much lower even than that<br />
we might have expected in the year which was to follow.<br />
Translating it into rather different terms, if you<br />
take the fall in our sheep population. In Queensland, there<br />
was a fall of 32%, in New South Wales a drop of 15%. Altogether<br />
we lost 18.6 million sheep in that period in thlose two droughtaffected<br />
States. The total of sheep population didn't fall as<br />
much because in other States there was somae Gain, but with<br />
nor= s. l conditions there would have been a gain, of course, in<br />
New South Wales and Queensland too, but in those States alone<br />
there was a loss of 18.6 million sheep. There was . a loss of<br />
just on a million head of cattle. . Here I think we can claim<br />
some credit that the loss was held as low as the statistics now </p>
<p>-3<br />
confirm, because wie had, as you will be aware, been giving<br />
effect to a programme of beef road construction and this<br />
enabled the rapid movement of drought effected stock from one<br />
area to more favourable areas and so we were holding down that<br />
particular drought effect in relation to a very valuable stock<br />
of beef cattle. You get some indication of the ma.-nitude of this<br />
programme when I tell you that our commitment up to the end<br />
of June this year of beef roads will be of the order of<br />
$ 57 million and we have made offers to the States of a further<br />
million to be spont on the beef road programme over the five<br />
or six years which lie ahead of us. As this programme takes<br />
full effect not only will we open up areas of great potential<br />
value for beef production in a world which is increasing its<br />
requirements of beef, but vie shall also be helping to safegruard<br />
against the effects of drought as it no doubt will occur from<br />
time to time in this country in the future.<br />
But those of you who have to conduct your owin<br />
businesses, if you found a drop in income in a major area<br />
of your resources, from $ 12.5 million to $ 9 million would<br />
know that pretty serious adjustments would. have to be made<br />
and when this occurred at a time whsLn we wveie in the process<br />
of doubling our expenditure on defence and diverting national<br />
resources for this purpose, wheni in the same period we had to<br />
contend, particuliarly in more recent months with the effects<br />
of flood and bushfire, you will I think, be the more impressed<br />
by the relatively even way in which the economy has moved<br />
throughout this period, and on present indications the prospect<br />
is an even brighter one ahead.<br />
We might have been pardoned if wie had regarded the<br />
nation's performance as falling far below what actually occurred,<br />
but in the result we moved steadily forward. In the December<br />
quarter of this year, the post-Budget critics and analysts were<br />
saying that not enough stimulus had been given but there was<br />
actually in that quarter an increase in gross national product<br />
of the order of 8% as compared with thu December quarter of<br />
the previous year, and even then that is reduced in real terms<br />
making full allowance for price changes and matters of that sort,<br />
you get a ye rysignificant increase in gross national product<br />
upwards of The December quarter also saw~ a revival in retail<br />
sales of goods. The value of retail sales was up 5.6% above<br />
the level of sales in -the December quarter of the previous year<br />
and, more importantly, during the September quarter there was<br />
a most notable improvement in the percentage increase in the<br />
sales of the clothing and consumer durables group, an increase<br />
which at very least promises improved conditions for<br />
manufacturers of these particular goods.<br />
Also i~ portant in the December quarter of course<br />
was the rise in the level of motor vehicle registrations.<br />
However it's not always easy to please everybody and some<br />
people have suggested that the most recent figures for<br />
February reflect a falling off in the motor vehicle market.<br />
In fact the February sales suggest an annual rate of sale<br />
of a minimum of just under 400,000 and the industry appeared<br />
to be in an excellent position to move along over that<br />
400,000 annual mark as the year progresses.<br />
Housing. This was an area of expenditure about which<br />
some doubt was expressed at times last year, but at the close<br />
of the year, housing approvals wiere running at an annual rate of<br />
124,000 and commencements at an annual rate of 117,000 which are<br />
very close, both of them, to record levels and present indications<br />
are that a higher level of activity will be maintained in 1967.<br />
/ 4s, </p>
<p>4-<br />
The other encouraging picture is in relation to exports<br />
in recent months and these have reached record level. In the<br />
first seven months of 1966/ 67 exports have been 107o greater than<br />
in -the same period of -the previous year and as a result, in these<br />
seven months the balance of overseas trade was 157 million dollars<br />
more favourable than it was at the same stage of 1965/ 66. The<br />
strength of our export sales is, of course, largely due to the<br />
improvement of conditions in the rural industries, which I have<br />
already mentioned, and of course to an increasingly important<br />
extent to our exporting capacity of minerals.<br />
Exports of iron ore, oxide and their derivatives are<br />
fast developing into a major item in our overseas trade. You<br />
might be interested just to have a quick glance at the way in<br />
which these export figures have moved, because they have risen<br />
over the last six or seven years from $ 1,851 million value in<br />
1960/ 61 wie reached the highest point in the following year in<br />
our history to $ 2,128 million. There was a sharp jump again<br />
in 1963/ 64 to $ 2,732 million and this year the estimate is<br />
$ 2,900 millions, and taking an informed guess for 1967/ 68<br />
I would say that we could expect $ 3,100 million or $ 3,200 million<br />
in 1967/ 68. No--v going back to 1960/ 61, or if you thin'-that was a<br />
bad year, but it wiasn't a bad year actually for exports. I'll<br />
take you back then to 1961/ 62, which was the previous record<br />
year for export income, $ 2,128 million. If by 1967/ 68 we hit<br />
$ 3,100 $ 3,200 million, which is roughly a 50% increase on the<br />
earlier record figure, you will see that the national policies<br />
have been fruitful in stimulating that most valuable of our<br />
goals, a rising export income enabling us to maintain a good<br />
level of imports and at the same time build up the internal<br />
standards of the country and the living standards of our people.<br />
There is just one cautionary word I'd offer about this<br />
whole picture, because, as you know restraints have been imposed<br />
in the United States and the United Kingdom, on the investment<br />
of capital from those countries, and vwhereas wie had a<br />
phenomenally large increase in the previous year, some of it<br />
is due to abnormal factors of a temporary character. We are<br />
now finding a fall away from those levels, anyhow, to what we<br />
would regard as more normal levels of investment, particularly<br />
from the United Kingdom and the United States. I hope that in<br />
respect of both these countries, this is only a passing phase.<br />
I am convinced that it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction<br />
of thoughtful planners and heads ol" government in those countries,<br />
that it's in their own economic interests, to see Australia<br />
develop. Most of our reserves are held in sterling for a start,<br />
to the extent that wie better our position, wie better the position<br />
of sterling and it is demonstrable that in the case of the United<br />
States, our export earnings, and in particular the investment<br />
of capital from the United States and this country, has been<br />
accompanied by increased export earnings and increased purchases<br />
from the United States of America, far outweighing any investment<br />
total which may come to us from that particular country. And so<br />
we hope thlat we'll have some success in persuading the governments<br />
of those countries that they are taking a short view of the<br />
economic picture if they in any way inhibit the development of<br />
Australian resources.<br />
But quite apart from th _ At aspect we have to play our<br />
owin part internally, and wie knowi that over a period of at least<br />
a couple of years vie are going to face a fall in our overseas<br />
reserves. We are fortunately strongly placed there, and to have<br />
a certain degree of room for manoeuvre, but it behoves us at the<br />
same time to take our own situation quite responsibly and I say<br />
that because our rise in the wiage level last year wias, I think<br />
of an order which it's going to take industry some time to digest. </p>
<p>If my recollection is correct the total rise was of<br />
the order of and I speak subject to correction but that's<br />
my recollection of it, and anyhow it was of a dimension which<br />
will take industry some time to digest. Faced with problems<br />
for our export industries, many of w~ hom are facing difficult<br />
competitive positions overseas, and faced with a need to digest<br />
an increase of this sort, and to keep the economy in good flexible<br />
supple condition to meet whatever problems we havu to face with<br />
decline in overseas reserves, vie can hope in 1967 that we will<br />
have a year of comparative wage stability. That anyhow is the<br />
view which the Government takes of that matter.<br />
Now I did say something about investment, I'd like<br />
to elaborate on that a little. To reach this stage of our<br />
development, and to carry on our programmes development in<br />
various parts of the Commonwealth, vast amounts of capital<br />
have been and will be required. My colleague the Minister<br />
for National Development has provided a number of detailed<br />
facts about Australia's development programme in a publication<br />
which I recommend your officers secure, which showis that at<br />
the end of June last, major development work under construction<br />
in Australia had an estimated total value of completion of<br />
$ 2,327 million. These works, chiefly those of Commonwealth<br />
and State Governments and their instrumentalities, dont<br />
include such things as expenditure on housing, hospital and<br />
educational facilities, which would of course have swollen<br />
the total very much more, and the figures do not include<br />
expenditure of nearly $ 600 million by the Commonwealth<br />
Government on the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The figures<br />
I have quoted are really on the small side because to keep<br />
the publication to a reasonable size water projects costing<br />
less than a million dollars and railway and road works costing<br />
less than half a million dollars are not counted. Now by any<br />
standards this total is a huge investment programme for a<br />
nation of under 12 million people. We have now in hand<br />
investments in development equivalent to some two hundred<br />
dollars a head of our population.<br />
I spoke of myself as Chairman of the National Corporation<br />
but we don't see that in competition, with the other corporations<br />
and companies repressnted here, ours is a national partnership<br />
with you and it's our responsibility to work in aid of the<br />
development by free . enterprise of the potentialities which emerge<br />
from time to time, whether it's building, railways, improving<br />
loading facilities at ports, establishing wharves and townships<br />
as we are doing now, particularly in the north and over in<br />
Western Australia various facilities in the Northern Territory<br />
and other developmental areas, these are to be carried out to<br />
assist the amazing developments which are occurring in these parts<br />
of Australia. The Government's approach to the developments is<br />
by no means dominated by the view that the project must be big<br />
to be important or worthwhile, and indeed in a multiplicity of<br />
relatively small projects there may be even greater national<br />
advantage than in one or more of the major or more spectacular<br />
developments. Where a n--ed exists and is seen and where it is<br />
clear the Government can make a real contribution then given all<br />
the demands on our limited finances wie wish to co-operate.<br />
I want to say a word about the supply of capital in<br />
order to assist the Australian entrepreneur to take a bigger<br />
hand in the development of our own national resources. This<br />
has been much canvassed and I can assure you a great deal of<br />
work has been done on this matter at our own Cabinet level.<br />
I am hoping that within a matter of days my colleague the<br />
Treasurer will be able to make an announcement on one aspect,<br />
and an important aspect, of this problem vie have been looking<br />
at in Cabinet, not just one proposal nor is one proposal<br />
necessarily exclusive of another or of others, but we do knowi<br />
that our own banking system is here to be helpful in this matter<br />
by some combination of resources and of facilities; wie do know<br />
that there is a willingness on behalf of the trading banks to .6. </p>
<p>-6<br />
join together for these purposes, and wie have had some fruitful<br />
discussions with them.<br />
The objective will be to assist the Australian<br />
entrepreneur who wants to secure a larger or even the<br />
total Australian equity for this country in these<br />
developments of our national resources, not to be frustrated<br />
by a lack of locally available capital. It may be that in<br />
each case it won't be possible to furnish all. It may be that<br />
there are very good reasons why this should be less than a full<br />
Australian equity participation, but at least we are mobilising<br />
ourselves to do far more in this direction than, vie have found<br />
it practicable to do in the past, and the story doesn't end there.<br />
We are looking at other proposals which could have the effect<br />
of enabling an Australian equity participation to occur in<br />
conjunction with overseas debenture capital brought in by other<br />
interested parties. I can only tell you this in the broad at<br />
this time but you can be sure that as finality-. is reached in<br />
negotiations on these matters statements will be made by the<br />
Ministers most directly conce~ rned.<br />
Sir, my final word is really in the nature of<br />
an appeal to calm judgement and good sense in relation to a<br />
matter which doesn't directly concern you in your conduct of<br />
your businesses, but which does concern us all in the conduct<br />
of the nation. Just as you have to overhaul the machinery of<br />
your business organisation from time to time and make<br />
readjustments in staffing or additions to staff where great<br />
expansion has occurred, so it becomes necessary -although<br />
at very much less frequent intervals in practice -for us to<br />
make some study of the machinery of government, and you will<br />
be aware that wie are bringing forward a referendum which is<br />
designed to break what is known as the nexus between the<br />
House of Representatives and the Senate, regarding the<br />
membership of Parliament.<br />
Nowi we can expect between now and the date of the<br />
poll that there will be a great deal of misrepresentation on<br />
this issue, attempts made to mislead the people as to what is<br />
really involved. Although the leaders of the three principal<br />
parties, the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Labour<br />
Party have all joined together unanimously, and the vote was<br />
unanimous in the House of Representatives in supporting this<br />
particular proposal, there are opponents and there are critics<br />
including some sections ofthe Press and the Press are able to<br />
present this matter in a way which doesn't either tell the story<br />
fully or give a completely clear account of what is intended.<br />
I say that deliberately because already I've run into situations<br />
where even that august institution the A. B. C. and this has been<br />
repeated in some of the newspapers have presented this referendum<br />
as a referendum to increase the size of the House of Representatives.<br />
This was the way in which the A. B. C. recently led in a new~ w comment<br />
after Itd fixed the date for the referendum.<br />
The referendum to increase the size of the House of<br />
Representatives will be held on May 27th. Well if we just want<br />
to increase the size of the House of Representatives, we don't<br />
need a referendum. We have got full power to do that at this<br />
time. Those people who say we don't want more Members of<br />
Parliament, might very well reflect on our objective, which is<br />
designed to enable from time to time modest increases without<br />
at the same time being compelled to increase the size of the<br />
Senate, which most people regard as being large enough anyhow<br />
for Australia's present and prospective needs. It will have<br />
been twenty years since the last increase occurred by the time<br />
we reach the next Parliament the next election. a </p>
<p>7-<br />
We do~ put out of range the possibility of<br />
increasing the size of the Senate at some future time,<br />
but we say it's absurd if we want to increase the House<br />
of Representatives by say twelve or thirteen, but on the<br />
present system of voting, we have to increase the total<br />
number of Members of Parliament by seventytwo. That<br />
wouldn't strike you as being good business and it doesntt<br />
strike us as being good sense, and yet without an alteration<br />
of the Constitution, if we wanted to provide a Member of<br />
Parliament for every 85,000 persons ( and that's above the<br />
figure we had back in 1949 when the last increase occurred)<br />
then if we stuck to the pr esent system of voting we would<br />
need to increase the Senate by twonitgfour aud tho ' House of<br />
Representatives by fortyeight. I won't spell out the detail<br />
of it for you now, Just take my word for tiat, they will do<br />
it so well before the campaign comes along. There have been<br />
suggestions that we could alter by having our twelve in the<br />
House of Representatives and only appoint one additional<br />
person to each State in the Senate. Well that would mean<br />
you would have six people elected in one three year period,<br />
five elected in another. The possibility of deadlock would<br />
be about double the present level, and heaven knows we have<br />
enough trouble now with an evenly-divided Senate.<br />
Quite apart from the rather odd circumstance that<br />
on the system of proportional representation those who are lucky<br />
enough to have been chosen in the period when six went out would<br />
virtually have a life tenure of their occupancy of the Senate<br />
without any serious prospect of challenge, but a. o have it in<br />
mind that if we want to make some sort of increase, a modest<br />
increase, not year by year thc, last one was just on twenty<br />
years ago but from time to time then what better time than at<br />
the beginning of a new Parliament, when no one can seriously<br />
argue that in the light of our current majority we are doing<br />
this in order to take some particular advantage of our Opposition.<br />
The Opposition joins us in supporting this, so does the Leader<br />
of the Country Party and his colleagues in the Parliament. The<br />
vote, I repeat, was unanimous in the House of Representatives,<br />
and if you are running a business and knew that when we last<br />
increased to our. ipresent numbers the population of Australia was<br />
just on eight millions, and . when we next meet the electors it will<br />
be just on twelve millions, you'd say it's not unreasonable that<br />
we should have a handful more people to assist in doing the<br />
increasingly complex task that a Government and Parliament have<br />
to carry out.<br />
Well gentlemen more, no doubt, will have to be said<br />
on these matters as we get closer to the event. Some people<br />
have vested interest, one party in particular which can't win<br />
a seat in the House of Representatives, and makes its gains in<br />
the Senate, wants to see a larger Senate, of course, because then<br />
its quota for return in the Senate drops accordingly and becomes<br />
easier, and you'll find it quite vocal. Other people who become<br />
critics have talked about use doing ill by the smaller States.<br />
Well that's not the view of the State organisations represented<br />
on our own political party bodies and I think that 9Qn be shown<br />
to be a very feeble fear. You do get thcase misrepresentations,<br />
some are quite accidental. I read in my paper this morning one of<br />
my colleagues saying that the Commonwealth Government had no<br />
contact with the State Government. When I asked him about this<br />
he said the word was conflict, not contact, and there's quite<br />
a difference in meaning. Then he said he was reported as saying<br />
that the Federal Government is always in a state of flux. What<br />
he said was the Federal Constitution is alwiays in a state of flux.<br />
And again there can be this failure of communications, and our<br />
problem in getting tho story over is to have it clearly and<br />
reasonably understood by our people.<br />
Well Sir, by my clock I am five minutes late.<br />
Sorry to have detained you so long, thank you very much for<br />
your attentive hearing. </p>
