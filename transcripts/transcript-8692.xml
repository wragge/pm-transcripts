PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J<br />
KEATING, MP, OPENING OF PRATT INDUSTRIES' NEW DE-INKING<br />
AND PAPER RECYCLING MILL, MELBOURNE, 9 OCTOBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
I think it is true to say that we arc in a new culture and that culture changed in the<br />
1980s, the culture of protection, seeing Australia ringed with a fence of tariffs, a<br />
managed -exchange rate, cxcbange controls, a constipated financial market, there's<br />
no way a business like this would havc been funded with them through the 1980s<br />
without financial deregulation, but we are -seeing the great shift to a more supple,<br />
fluid economy whcrc manufacturing is becoming the order of the day.<br />
This is the first year in our history where manufactured exportsM have equalled rural<br />
and mining exports. This is a great change for Australia, a great change from our<br />
culture as an importing country, and as I said, John Button and 1, a week ago were<br />
opening a plant, the Holeproof plant of Pacific Dunlop's. You might have heard<br />
about my underpants on thc way through. But the thing was, here was another<br />
busincss whcre Australians have decided to do something technologically clever<br />
and produce a product which is compctitive and which will feed into the Australian<br />
retailing industry and which will import replace. And not so many months before<br />
that I had the honour again with Mr Toyoda to turn the first sod of the plant, an<br />
$ 800 million investmcnt in a new motor vehicle plant which will be the ncw<br />
denominator of the Australian motor vehicle industry; an enormous investment. Or<br />
just a few weeks after that a new catalytic cracker for Shell over at Geelong which<br />
is going to change our petroleum industry, going to sell into the Singapore oil<br />
market and into south-cast Asia.<br />

<p>These are just in the space of a few months and there are more of them and as<br />
many as I talk about John can double them because he gets more invitations than<br />
me, most out there in the manufacturing industry, they like him more.<br />
Last week I was at the AMECON plant, we were not opening it but we were down<br />
there tyre kicking, looki~ ng around and there was the latest destroyer delivered to<br />
the Australian Navy, a most sophisticated warship, state of the art, world quality,<br />
navy accepted it it had no faults, which is almost unprecedented; at its sea trials,<br />
no faults. They say it is a better quality product from similar plant ships from the<br />
United States, a great Australian achievement.<br />
And recently I was at the Pacific Dunlop tyre plant where we see again technical<br />
innovation to turn a new export business out of tyres; or at theFord plaig. where<br />
we're exporting the new model Capri to the United States. This is just in Victoria.<br />
Last week I was atMitsubishi where we saw the new Magna wagon go 6,000 of<br />
them around the world as a-new export market for Australia.<br />
We've made the jump, we've made the cultural shift to a society which is putting its<br />
focus on technology and ability and part of that is of course, bringing up the quality<br />
of our education system because the greatest Australian resource was never the<br />
next deposit of minerals or the next paddock full of wheat, but the Australian<br />
people themselves. And that's why now in 1992 just over 7 out of 10 children<br />
complete secondary school where it was just 3 out of 10 in 1982. How could you<br />
ever hope to be a technologically smart country if only 3 kids in ten completed<br />
secondary school? Forty per cent of those are now streamed into universities<br />
where we have added 50 per cent of places, we created the equivalent of twelve<br />
universities of an average campus size of 10,000 since 1986 and we're now seeing<br />
a revolution in vocational education, in technical and further education with a<br />
Na_ t ional Training Authority to do in vocational education what we've done in<br />
tertiary education and participation rates in schools.<br />
We're seeing all that fed into a much more conscious research an~ d deve lopment<br />
culture with support for research and development and product innovation which<br />
welre seeing come through in Australian business. We are seeing Australia<br />
integrate itself with these products with our near neighbourhood with the rest of the<br />
world. Just a week ago I came back from Japan and Singapore and not long before that a<br />
from earlier in the year from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and there's no<br />
doubt in those countries Indonesia, Japan, Singapore et cetera that we are finding a<br />
new place for Australia and we are building up conducive training and government<br />
relationships and private relationships which is going to lock Australia much more<br />
O/ ZO'd ST0' ON 95!: 2-T Z6* 430O6 :-1133.1 </p>
<p>into that Asia Pacific area. Already 70 per cent of our exports go to the Asia<br />
Pacific area, 60 per cent of it goes to the south-east Asian area, 75 per cent goes to<br />
the APEC area, Asia Pacific area as a whole.<br />
We're already part of this region and we're integrating with it now rapidly. I<br />
suppose the most important statistic one can quote is that a decade ago 14 per cent<br />
of our produce was exported, this year it is 23 per cent; that is nearly a quarter of<br />
everything we produce is exported. This is a phenomenal change which without<br />
that our current account deficit would be double, our debt levels would be<br />
astronomic and of course, the international financial markets would already be<br />
inducing a permanent slow down of Australia so that our debt levels didn't<br />
increase. So we've madc a very important change and part of the change is in the culture of<br />
business and the culture of the workforce, it's not just entrepreneurship like<br />
Richard's ( Pratt) display here or the marshalling of the capital or the technical<br />
innovation in the management group, but also in thc great revolution in industrial<br />
relations. Because we are now seeing enterprise agreements written across this<br />
country where all sorts and manner of conditions, be they penalty rates or hours of<br />
work or conditions of employment rolled into new innovative agreements which<br />
give us all the flexibility in the world, higher productivity, better salaries, lower<br />
costs and lower inflation and it is that sea-change in industrial relations which has<br />
given us a period of unprecedented industrial peace and which is seeing us do the<br />
most innovative things, introduction in plants across the country. I think that<br />
consensus model, that bringing Australia together and holding it together and<br />
giving people a stake in the business, giving people pride in what they are doing<br />
and having management to include them, an inclusive policy is the one that's<br />
obviously producing the goods for Australia and not a competitive policy in the<br />
work place where one worker is pitted against another or an adversarial<br />
relationship where the management is pitted against the employees. That's what<br />
we want to avoid and if we want to take any lessons from Japan or any of the<br />
cultures from our near north, if there's one thing in common they have is that peer<br />
group pressure and the work ethic have come togethcr as a cohesive group is what<br />
made those societies productively great in what is changing Australia.<br />
So the spirit is there and the faith is there and that is what's going to matter to us<br />
and the hope is there. The fact is, T said this week with some criticism that the<br />
recession is over, technically it is true and as we know we are still living with the<br />
effects of it and we will for some time. But the point is the recovery is on and it's<br />
on in plants like this across the country and it will grow as we go through thc 1990S<br />
as a low inflationary culture where we've got the emphasis on product innovation<br />
and we're looking to add value and do good things for our employees.<br />
tVO/ MOd G9100N 91: LT Z6* 13O613:-131 </p>
<p>But in every business they are all becoming more productive, Richard was telling<br />
me at the table that in each plant of course there are fewer people producing more<br />
products and that's true across the country. It has to be true to be competitive. So<br />
what is the answer? What is the answer to the implied redundancy of having fewer<br />
people producing more product; and the answer is to produce even more product,<br />
even greater levels of product. There are just thousands of business opportunities<br />
that will be taken up in the 1990s doing innovative things, producing more product<br />
to let the country grow, hut you can't run this country at a speed which takes the<br />
employment up without it spilling into inflation, without some agreement about<br />
incomes. Whether you call in an Accord or you call it ca-operation or an<br />
understanding, call it what you like, but there is no way sonme draconian Reserve<br />
Bank on monetary policy is going to let Australia grow and at the same time keep<br />
inflation down while we can take up the unemployed into productive jobs. If we<br />
want higher rates of employment and more growth, we must have more production,<br />
more speed in GDP, greater rates of growth, but if we want to lower intended<br />
intlation risk and keep that competitiveness we've got to do it together. We'll never<br />
do it banging people over the head with a vicious monetary policy administered by<br />
some independent reserve or central bank.<br />
So it's all about doing things together as things have been done here, doing clever<br />
and complex things, but doing them well, seeing intelligence, entrepreneurship,<br />
street smartness, good will, a bit of heart brought together to produce something<br />
really new and innovative.<br />
So Richard, I congratulate you on what you have done, I congratulate you on the<br />
business you have developed which is a good thing for Australia, you're replacing<br />
all of those imports which you would otherwise be taking as raw product, you're<br />
doing things to employ Australians and you'll keep on employing because youll<br />
keep on growing your business, notwithstanding the fact you need fewer of them in<br />
the productive process and in doing so you are part of that great cultural change of<br />
Australia, going out, meeting the world, engaging the world and doing it in a way<br />
which earns Australia a place of repute, of substance, in the world of trade<br />
particularly in the A-ia Pacific where we live.<br />
This is a a great day for the industry of Victoria and of Melbourne and I salute and<br />
congratulate every Victorian who has been involved with it, none more so than our<br />
afcsbian entrepreneurial fricnd, Richard Pratt.<br />
Thank you.<br />
