I* L<br />
,,, AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA_ 20 February. 1987._<br />
The Prime Minister of Tuvalu, the Rt Hon Dr Tomasi Puapua,<br />
-w-i-l--be-v-i-s-i-t-ing-A-us-tr-al-i-a--from--21 Februa-ry-to 2--M--rch-as-a--<br />
guest of . the Australian. Government. He will be accompanied<br />
by his wife Mrs Riana Puapua.<br />
During his stay in Australia Dr Puapua will visit Melbourne,<br />
Perth, Canberra, Brisbane and Townsville. Dr Puapua will<br />
hold discussions with myself, the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, Mr Hayden, the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley,<br />
and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. He will call<br />
on the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen.<br />
In Perth Dr Puapua will call on the Acting Premier and<br />
Minister for Defence Liaison, Mr Bryce, and visit the<br />
facilities of Australian Shipbuilding Industries, where the<br />
Pacific Patrol Boat Project is underway. Dr Puapua will<br />
visit the Expo 88 site in Brisbane and meet the Deputy<br />
Premier, Mr W Gunn. In Townsville Dr Puapua will visit the<br />
Townsville State High School, where some students from<br />
Tuvalu are to study, James Cook University and the<br />
Australian Institute of Marine Science for discussions on<br />
management of the marine environment.<br />
Australia and Tuvalu share a warm and friendly relationship<br />
and are partners in South Pacific regional activities. I<br />
hope that, as a result of the exchanges during Dr Puapua's<br />
visit, an even closer understanding would be reached between<br />
Australia and Tuvalu. In December 1986 the Australian<br />
Government decided to contribute $ 8 million to the Tuvalu<br />
Trust Fund, which is designed to allow the Tuvalu Government<br />
to achieve financial self-reliance and to plan effectively<br />
for the long-term future of its people. </p>
