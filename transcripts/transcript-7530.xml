TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, REDCLIFFE CITY BOWLS CLUB, 16<br />
MARCH 1989<br />
E &amp; O0E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PH: Well they are at the lower end of the range of<br />
expectations so to that extent I'm pleased. But there's no<br />
room for complacency. The export figure's flat, the Import<br />
figures are dawn and we certainly want to see the import<br />
figures down. But this I think means that the Government needs<br />
to continue the firm policies that it's pursuing now. That is<br />
we need to get the level of activity down somewhat so that we<br />
are not sucking in an unacceptably high level of imports. We<br />
have a better opportunity now with the dollar down from the<br />
higher figure. it's reached to help those of our manufacturers<br />
and exporters who want to get in to the markets overseas and to<br />
compete against imports. We are better poised now for those<br />
purposes than we were some months back. So overall I'm Pleased<br />
that it is at the lower end of expectations but not complacent.<br />
JOUJRNALIST: Mr Hawke though is it a bit deceptively low<br />
because February is such a short month?<br />
PM: The figures are taken into account in the seasonally<br />
adJusted sense and I think that what I've said is accurate.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think it means for home loan interest<br />
rates? PM: I've got no reason to change what I've said before. Now<br />
firstly I don't go Predicting in the immediate sense arnd I<br />
never have predicted in immediate terms what will happen to<br />
interest rates because that's not helpful to anyone. I simply<br />
repeat what I've said before and that is that I think that<br />
we' ve got the policies in place which will mean that as time<br />
goes on in this Year we can look at a lowering of the interest<br />
rates structure but I'm not predicting anything for the<br />
immediate future.<br />
JOURNALIST: It probably won't be much incentive for the share<br />
market do you think? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PH: You are a Pessimist aren't You. Have You got anything<br />
nice to say? The share market conducts its own business. I'm<br />
not here to Prod it up or push It down. That's for the market,<br />
they make their own Judgement.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
FM: Well consumer confidence I think to the extent that this<br />
has any impact, it must be a bit of a plus because It has as<br />
I repeat come In at the lower end of the range of<br />
expectations. SO if it has any impact upon consumer confidence<br />
it Must Presumably be a bit of a plus.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what's Your response to Mr Crean's<br />
condemnation of the Federal Government saying it lacks an<br />
overall environment strategy?<br />
PM:-I think that Simon has bean somewhat harsh in his<br />
observations. I think if he had seen in detail what we saw<br />
that is the report of the CSIRO and the Bureau of Rural<br />
Resources reports then he would understand that there was no<br />
alternative than the decision that we took because those<br />
reports made it quite clear that it would've been an of any<br />
governments' duty to allow the Mill to proceed on the watered<br />
down terms that had been agreed to by the Tasmanian<br />
Government. It was an act of Political irresponsibility by the<br />
Gray Government that all that time they did not Insist upon an<br />
effective environmental impact study and at then end they gave<br />
in to commercial Pressures from the Joint venturers. our<br />
Position is that we would like investment in this country.<br />
We'd like a mill but I say Mr Gray, I say to the people of<br />
Australia, while we want growth and Investment we don't went it<br />
at any price. We have a responsibility to this and future<br />
generations of Australians to protect the environment as well<br />
as encouraging growth and this Government's got a good record<br />
in terms of growth. We've created Jobs in this country four<br />
times faster than our conservative predecessors. We're creating<br />
Jobs in this country more than twice as fast as the rest of the<br />
industrialised world. So we've got nothing to apologise to<br />
anyone in terms of growth. But an I say I'm not a<br />
growth-at-say-price man, I've got a responsibility and my<br />
colleagues have got a responsibility to this generation of<br />
Australians and future generations and I'm not going to be<br />
remiss in discharging that responsibility.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister do You share Senator Richardson's<br />
assessment that Mr Crean has done his Political future some<br />
damage by his outbursut Yesterday?<br />
P X: No I em not aoin@ to that point. I think that's drawing a<br />
somewhat long bow.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it was unwise of him to make those<br />
comments? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PH: I'm not making any comments about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the conservation policy then on track?<br />
PM: Let me say this, that I would believe that If You look at<br />
our record in the area of conservation we have a prouder record<br />
than any government before us. I don't need to go over it all,<br />
but You look at the Great Barrier Reef, the forests in<br />
Queensland and Tasmania. Kakadu, all the areas of achievement,<br />
they stand out and warrant the judgements that's been made by<br />
the international community that no government has been more<br />
responsibly comited to the preservation of the environment<br />
than has my Government. Obviously when you make decisions in<br />
this.-area you have to walk fine line.. This country needs<br />
i. nve~ tment. it needs a situationi where our naatural Products can<br />
be processed with more value added and we want to see that<br />
happen. But I repeat we're not going to do that at any price<br />
because of the responsibilities to which I refer. I think our<br />
process is on track. We're establishing the Resources<br />
Assessment Commission so that in future those who want to have<br />
developmental Projects will have an Authority established under<br />
Comonwealth law which will enable those who want to argue their<br />
case and those who feel that there are concerns to be able<br />
to develop their Points before a well known estalbished<br />
tribunal so that there will be this process through which<br />
they can go and which will be well known. So if you take<br />
all those things into account I think we can say yes it is<br />
on track.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any need for an overall environment<br />
strategy though?<br />
PM: You can't have an overall environment strategy which<br />
says for every conceivable type of Project here is the<br />
strategy. I mean that doesn't make sense. What you've<br />
got to have Is a mechanism which Iove referred to, we've<br />
established now the Resources Assessment Tribunal to which<br />
I've referred and that will give a degree of certainty of<br />
process for everybody.<br />
ends </p>
