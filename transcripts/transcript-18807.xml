<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced Australia would join with the United States and other international partners to expand economic opportunities for women and to increase women's participation in politics and civil society.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard announced that Australia was joining the Equal Futures Partnership as a founding member. The Partnership was launched today in New York by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Member countries of the Equal Futures Partnership commit to taking action to expand economic opportunities for women and to increase their political and civil participation.</p>
<p>Other founding members include the United States, Benin, Bangladesh, Denmark, Finland, Indonesia, Jordan, the Netherlands, Peru, Senegal, Tunisia, and the European Union.</p>
<p>Australia has a strong record at home and abroad in supporting the goals of the Equal Futures Partnership but is always looking to build on these achievements.</p>
<p>Nations thrive when women are able to participate in politics, business and society as equals.</p>
<p>In addressing the Equal Futures Partnership launch, Ms Gillard highlighted recent Australian policy initiatives to help deliver an equal future for women.</p>
<p>These include taking steps to improve women's representation in male-dominated industries and a target of a minimum of 40 per cent women on Australian Government Boards by 2015.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the Government was also creating a National Centre of Excellence to Reduce Violence Against Women. </p>
<p>The Centre will serve as a research hub to support the development of policy, professional practice and programs to reduce violence against women.</p>
<p>Australia is also committed to supporting gender equality in our region.  The Prime Minister recently announced at the Pacific Islands Forum in Rarotonga a ten-year, $320 million initiative, which will focus on improving women's leadership and decision-making opportunities; increasing economic opportunities for women; and reducing violence against women.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard is in New York to attend the 67th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
