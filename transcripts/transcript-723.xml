PRESS CONFERNC GIVEN BY Tni PRI14E MINIS TER, THE<br />
RT. HON. SIR ROBERT MENZIES AT LENNONS HOTEL,<br />
BRISBANE, ON 22ND APRIL, 1963w<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER: Q. P. M. I was wondering, Sir, whether you felt satisfied<br />
that the special assistance in loans and the<br />
grants for public works given to Queensland in the<br />
past year or two are bearing fruit. Do you feel<br />
they are having the desired effect?<br />
Oh, I think there are plenty of signs of improvement<br />
in the result, because when it came to the<br />
non-repayable grants to stimulate employment, as<br />
you know we weighted it a bit in favour of Queensland<br />
very properly because the incidence of such<br />
unemployment as there is is, is heavier in Queensland<br />
than elsewhere. I thinik on the whole, that<br />
there are signs of improvement and in fact it is<br />
very interesting to note that the Arbitration<br />
Commission made the improvement in the country's<br />
economy the principal reason for granting a ten<br />
per cent, increase in margins in the recent<br />
judgment and the three weeks' leave. I don't<br />
think anybody doubts that there is a marked<br />
improvement all round. That doosn't moan to say<br />
that the position doesn't have to be watched.<br />
There is to be another Loan Council of course<br />
the regular one in June as a rule and it is<br />
at that time that we discuss the Loan programme<br />
for the States including the housing component.<br />
The tax reimbursement, as we used to call it,<br />
is, of course, the subject of a current agreement<br />
and it increases each year in accordance with the<br />
factors that the formula provides for such as<br />
increase in population and children o1l school age<br />
and so on. I can't anticipate what will happen<br />
at the June meeting but Loan Council meetings<br />
tend to produce an improving result each time from<br />
the point o1' view of the States.<br />
Has the success of the last Loan made it easier,<br />
Sir, to go to the Loan Council?<br />
Well, you can't answer that with a simple " Yes"<br />
or There is no doubt about it that the<br />
success of the last Loan has improved the Commonwealth's<br />
cash position for 1962-63. We were<br />
budgeting for a pretty substantial cash deficit.<br />
That will, of course, be very much smaller than<br />
we anticipated because of the success of the last<br />
Loan and I think there is reason to believe that<br />
the Loan market will continue to be healthy in the<br />
next financial year. I don't mean to say that<br />
we will have Å C601,1. loans doubly subscribed. That<br />
is an uncommon event, but I think we can look<br />
forward to a pretty healthy Loan market in<br />
1963/ 64 and, of course, one of the great effects<br />
of that from the Commonwealth's point of view is<br />
that instead of supplementing the Loan market<br />
as we have for many years out of the Budget so<br />
that the States will get their full money, we can<br />
reduce that drain on the Budget and to that extent,<br />
it improves our Budgetary position. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Q. There is an active movement in North Queensland now<br />
Sir, called " People the North'. I understand that the<br />
Queensland and Western Australian Governments are joining<br />
together to make an approach to the Federal Govcrnrento<br />
P. M. Well that hadn't reached me when I loft Canberra. I<br />
don't recall getting anything yet.<br />
Q. The Premier was writing first to the Premier of Western<br />
Australia and then they were goin-to write to the Commonwealth.<br />
P. M. Anyhow, I am having lunch with the Queensland Cabinet<br />
tomorrow and if there is something like this in the<br />
wind no doubt Mr. Nicklin will take the opportunity of<br />
raising it. But I wouldn't comment on it because I don't<br />
know what it is yet.<br />
Q. Sir, there is no particular project you would be discussing<br />
with Cabinet tomorrow is there?<br />
P. M. No, I have no agenda. When I come up here, I usually<br />
like to see them and sit around and talk about our<br />
problems. They are probably at the moment fairly<br />
concentrated on their own because of an election coming.<br />
Not a Federal election, but a State one. It is a good<br />
thing to have contacts. As a matter of fact, in the past<br />
our contacts were not sufficiently good with perhaps some<br />
unhappy results but we have greatly improved that position<br />
in the last eighteen months, both by meeting each other in<br />
Canberra and here.<br />
Q. Sir, what do you think of the suggestion that has been<br />
made that the Snowy Mountains Authority shouldn't be<br />
wound up as an organization when the Snowy job is over<br />
but should perhaps use the accumiulated talents and<br />
techniques<br />
P. M. Well, at the moment, that is nothing but an idea,<br />
Needless to say, it is one that we have had in our own<br />
minds because we don't want to see a great, skilful,<br />
technical organization like the Snowy Mountains Authority<br />
just fade away, It is much too experienced and competent<br />
for that, but exactly what you do with it in the future<br />
is a matter that can't be solved by a few rhetorical<br />
phrases. It requires a close study. The Minister for<br />
National Development has not only been going into this<br />
matter himself very closely but has several times<br />
discussed it with me and with other Ministers. There is<br />
no doubt about it that it would be a very good thing if<br />
you could use a body of that kind. You have to remember<br />
that all these works projects in Australia are in a prime<br />
sense, State works. We have, ourselves, come to the<br />
party on a number of them, but it is not just a simple<br />
case of the Commonwealth saying, " This is what we will do<br />
in such and such a place and we will use the Snory<br />
Mountains people for it." These things require a lot of<br />
negotiation with State Governmonts, just indeed as the<br />
Snowy Mountains Scheme did. It took years to get the<br />
legislation through, to give the thing complete<br />
Constitutional validity by having an agreement between<br />
Victoria and New South Uales and the Commonwealth That<br />
took a long long time. It is quite true that we wont<br />
ahead with the job but we were going ahead on a very<br />
precarious Constitutional foundation until the agreement<br />
0 / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
P. M. was signed and ratified by the Parliament. When I say<br />
( Contd.) that, I am not contemplating that it is going to take<br />
years to evolve some other scheme. I don't know what<br />
the schemes are; what there might be. Certainly you can<br />
take it that we are interested in getting full benefit<br />
of the Snowy Mountains set-up.<br />
Q. Has Senator Spooner expressed any ideas on this?<br />
P. M, No, well, we haven't got to concrete proposals. We have<br />
been rather talking about the general principle. No, I<br />
am not in a position to mention any particular schemes.<br />
Anyhow, if I knew, I wouldn't say because you get<br />
headlines " So and So is to be done by the Snowy<br />
Mountains Authority". I am too old a horse for that.<br />
Q# Decimal currency Sir. Views have been expressed up<br />
here that the acLal changeover could lead to some<br />
inflation-for example where things are close, they will<br />
just up i a bit to get on to the now currency, the new<br />
coin.<br />
P. M. Jell, that can't apply to the main unit because that is<br />
to be he precise equivalent of 10/-today. One thing<br />
is that 1/ 100th part of 10/-is 1.2d. so perhaps you might<br />
find that 19/ id. might become 19/ 1.2d. I can't say that<br />
I think that it has got serious inflationary possibilities.<br />
Q. This matter has been deferred once, Mr. Prime Minister.<br />
Do you think that this time it will definitely be introduced?<br />
P. M. Oh, yes. You are wrong in saying it has been deferred.<br />
ije first of all said that we wore greatly interested.<br />
We appointed a Committeo to investigate it. You know, this<br />
outside Committee. Then, when we got their report, we<br />
said we adopted it in principle and since then a lot of<br />
investigations have been going on as to the mechanics of<br />
the chnngeover. It is no use announcing a date for the<br />
chsngeover unless you know that you can live up to it.<br />
Woll, they have introduced it into South Africa and our<br />
experts learnt a good deal from South African's experience.<br />
Then, we arc in process of establishing the Mint at<br />
Canberra. The site is at present being cleared and the<br />
Mint, of course 9 will1 need to be so created as to deal<br />
with the new coinage and finally, for the first time we<br />
fixed a date, and this is a firm date, for it to come in,<br />
because we are now satisfied that all the mechanical<br />
problems can be overcome in that time. There will have<br />
to be a great deal of changing, you know accounting<br />
machines and all this kind of thing; this will cost the<br />
Government, of course, a lot of money.<br />
Q. Is there any room for the GovornmenttD pay compensation?<br />
P. M. Compensation to whom?<br />
Q. To the people who are grossly affected, who have machines.<br />
P. M. Oh, there is going to be a provision that the Government<br />
will meet certain costs of the changeover. I don't carry<br />
the details around but I know that it amounts to a very<br />
considerable liability on the Government, running into<br />
what f. 301\ or Å E4OM, 0 a 0 0 0 4 0/ 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
Would it be any great advantage to Australia, Sir, if<br />
New Zealand converts to decimal currency at the same time?<br />
P. M. Well, it would simplify transactions between the two<br />
countries but, of course, they are on a different rate of<br />
exchange anyhow because New Zealand is on par with sterling.<br />
I don't disguise from myself the fact that when it<br />
ultimately comes in there will be a great deal of<br />
hullabaloo you know housewives won't be very pleased.<br />
They will say we have got used to the old business of<br />
pounds, shillings and pence. But I have no doubt that<br />
within a few weeks the complete simplicity of this will<br />
recommend itself. You only have to be able to do a long<br />
addition of three or four figures and you have got it.<br />
The great fun is going to be getting aname for the unit.<br />
Q. Have you any preferences, Sir?<br />
P. M. Dear me, no, but I have seen some verr funny ones.<br />
Somebody wants to call it a ming. I think that's rather..<br />
( Laughter) Somebody recommended that we call it a<br />
" dinar". These are not Ministers; these are people who<br />
have written in to the Treasury. It makes pretty amusing<br />
reading.<br />
Q. Have you formed your own opinion, Sir?<br />
P. M. No.<br />
Q. There have been movements lately through local Government<br />
associations on the State and Federal level, pressing<br />
for representation on the Loan Council. Are they likely<br />
to get anywhere with that, Sir?<br />
P. M. I wouldn't think so. You see, muanicipal bodies are deait<br />
with by the States. They are created by the State Parliaments<br />
arid they deal with the State Parliaments. What<br />
happens in the Loan Council is that the amount of the<br />
Government Loan programme is fixed direct by resolution of<br />
the Loan Council and then under what they call " 1the<br />
gentlemen's agreement'", an arrangement is made as to the<br />
volume of borrowing on semi-government and local government<br />
account and as a rule, everything that doesn't exceed<br />
Å-100,000 is regarded as local even though it is by a<br />
semi-government authority and everything above Å-100,000<br />
is treated as being a semi-governmient borrowing. And so,<br />
they have been along once a year Ito say, " Could you increase<br />
under the ' gentle-me-n's agreement' the amount that local<br />
governing bodies can borrow?" and we did it this last<br />
time, increased it by some millions because their market<br />
was pretty fertile. In that sense and only in that sense,<br />
we deal with local governing bodies in thoir borrowing, but<br />
they make their representations through their State Governments<br />
which, I must say in justice to them, are usually<br />
pretty vigorous on behalf of the local governing bodies.<br />
I don't think their case loses anything in its presentation.<br />
Q. Sir, it has been announced recently that several large<br />
industrial enterprises are being established in various<br />
parts of Queensland. This will, 9 of course, put a fair<br />
strain, I should imagine, on the State's ability to provide<br />
housing. Is there any likelihood of the Federal Government<br />
making a special grant to the State for housing? 0 0 00 00 </p>
<p>Well, we did last year, not at the annual Loan Council<br />
but in a subsequent one and I don't know what the<br />
possibilities are on that. I can remember when the<br />
overall Loan programme was fixed, say at Å C250M to<br />
take a figure out of the air the States have always<br />
named how much they want of that. Ve have never<br />
dictated that bit at all. They say, I'de want Å 040M of<br />
that for housing, or Å C42Iv." 1 Well, Å 4OM or Å C42M it is,<br />
That is their business from our point of view... Of<br />
course there is a great deal of activity on the housing<br />
front. You know the savings bank provision for<br />
housing has gone up very considerably in recent months.<br />
That is all the savings banks. The current rate of<br />
building in Australia is just about an all-time record,<br />
something over 90 000 houses. If special problems<br />
arise in respect to any particular area, I have no<br />
doubt we will hear about that from the relevant State<br />
Government. It is a very good thing to see some of<br />
these industrial shows moving in here. I noticed this<br />
morning the B. H. P. is going to establish something.<br />
That's very good.<br />
Q6 Have you any thoughts on retirement, Sir?<br />
P. M. Whose retirement yours?<br />
Q1. I wish it was.<br />
P The last follow who raised this had me in the House of<br />
Lords as an Earl. I will announce my retirement some<br />
day, I hope. It may be that my executors will have<br />
to announce it.<br />
Q. Do you expect to see another election, Sir?<br />
P. M. Oh, yes, I hope so but you never know. The one person<br />
who is not interested in thiis problem is myself.<br />
Q. Sir, do you anticipate spending any time in the<br />
Queensland ele ction campaign yours elf?<br />
P. M. Oh, I don't know what arrangements they are making.<br />
I wouldn't have thought I had much chance. I am here<br />
today and tomuorrow and I hnve a by-election in Grey at<br />
which I have agreed to make two or three speechies and<br />
the House sits until May 25th. When is your polling<br />
da to?<br />
Q. 1st June,<br />
PIM. 1st June is the polling date in Grey. So I wouldn't<br />
have thought it likely. But as for the other Ministers,<br />
dontt ask me, Have they delivered their policy speech<br />
yet?<br />
Q. No.<br />
P. M. How long do you run a State election campaign here?<br />
Q. The policy speeches are due to be given on the 7th and<br />
the 9th May.<br />
P. M. Then it is about three and a half weeks. Long enough<br />
too.<br />
Q1. Officially, it started on Friday with the issuing of<br />
the writs. e9o 9 ee/ 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
IP. M . Still. it is a while before ti-iy do the policy speeches.<br />
It doesn't got going until then.<br />
Q. Are you satisfied with your own coalition relationships<br />
over this Electoral Act and Redistribution?<br />
P. M. Oh, yes, I am not upset. There are differences of opinion<br />
about the redistribution but if you got hold of twenty<br />
people in politics, you would have twenty different<br />
opinions on redistribution I am not crying myself<br />
to sleep about it. I hope wi will be able to got a fair<br />
redistribution.<br />
Q. Will the Liberal Party stand firm, Sir, for fairly equal<br />
Federal electorates?<br />
P1. M. You mustn't ask me what the Liberal Party is going to stand<br />
firm about. There never have beon equal olectorates.<br />
The law has been the same ever since we had an Electoral<br />
Act. The Commissioners can allow twenty per cent. up and<br />
twenty per cent, down with the quota and this is a<br />
recognition that electorates are not just to be mechanically<br />
equal, that circumstances vary between one electorate and<br />
another. It would be pretty odd if Kalgoorlie to take<br />
a gross example had the same number of voters as Kooyong<br />
which you can travel around in an afternoon, And it<br />
never has. As to what the differences ought to be or how<br />
they ought to be achieved, these are problems that excite<br />
differences of opinion. ' do are not to think of them as<br />
purely along party lines because I daresay there are as<br />
many different opinions on that matter in my Party as there<br />
are on any other, We were ready to accept the last<br />
redistribution on the principle that the Commissioners<br />
had been appointed, that thoy had gone throughi the<br />
processes and that as a matter of principle we ought to<br />
accept what they did, though some of our Members didn't<br />
like it very much because a man looks at his own electorate<br />
and says, NWhatts happened here?"; but we, as a Party,<br />
decided that we would accept thena on the principles which<br />
I have described. That wasn't acceptable and so they are<br />
all in the suspense account at present and of course if<br />
they remain in the suspense account, Queensland doesn't<br />
lose a seat. What's this Festival Hall like? The only time<br />
I ever spoke in a stadium in Sydney a famous occasion,<br />
I think it was in 1949, wasn't it? and a boxing ring was<br />
in the middle and they had a microphone in the middle of<br />
it an all-ways microphone and all the Comis. had<br />
got in the first three or four rows round the hall of<br />
this place; you had your back to half the audience and<br />
your front to the other half and I walked around this<br />
microphone like a teetotum. and from first to last I<br />
didntt hoar a word I said. I had to go back to the pub<br />
afterwards and listen in to see what had happened.<br />
You cantt hear yourself think when you have got an<br />
organised show. You can't look your audience in thoeye<br />
only a bit of it at a time and you don't know whether<br />
you are beginning your sentences or ending your sentences.<br />
This is really an appalling attitude. When I got back to<br />
the hotel, they were rebroadcasting it and I said to my<br />
wife, " By Jove this fello~ irts not bad, Who is he?"<br />
And she said you." " Wfell " 1 I said, " wonders will<br />
never ceasce I wouldn't want another of tho if I wranted<br />
to get a mess,-ge over to the public. For an evening's fun,<br />
there is a good deal to be said for it, but not if you<br />
want to convert people. e . e ese.. .7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Q. What do you expect to speak on tomorrow night, Sir?<br />
POMP Oh, I dontt know. I have prepared my mind on a number<br />
of matters but which onos I will decide on I don't<br />
know yet.<br />
Q. You haven't got a big upstairs gallery at this<br />
place, Sir. Right at the back of the hall, there<br />
is just a little one, It is not like the City Hall<br />
which comes all round. So most of the audience is<br />
on the floor.<br />
PM. Wh at are the acoustics like? Have they got a<br />
public address system?<br />
I think it is quite all right. </p>
