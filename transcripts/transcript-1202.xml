FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 92/ 1965<br />
NE14 ARRA1NGE1MZ: NTS FOR QUJEE14 MOTHER' S DEPA RTURE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, is to<br />
leave Australia by air instead of in the Royal Yacht<br />
" Britannia" at the end of her visit in Mliarch/ April next<br />
year. It had been intended that Her Majesty should<br />
embark in " Britannia" in Melbourne to sail to New Zealand.<br />
Now that plans for the tour have been advanced, it has<br />
become apparent that it will not be practicable for<br />
" Britannia" to go to Melbourne.<br />
Consequently, the Queen Mother will leave<br />
Canberra on board a Qantas Boeing 707 on the 7th April.<br />
She will fly to Nandi in Fiji where she will join the<br />
Royal Yacht. After a brief visit to Suva, Her Majesty<br />
will sail for New Zealand in " Britannia".<br />
CANBERRA, 26th November, 1965. </p>
