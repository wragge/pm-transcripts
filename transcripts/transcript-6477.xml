PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 20 SEPTEMBER 1984<br />
PM: Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry there has been aslight<br />
delay, but I thought it was appropriate and better for your<br />
purposes that you have a prepared statement from me. I would<br />
just point out one grammatical I think it is the only one -1<br />
can find on the bottom of page three the second sentence iLn<br />
that last paragraph the " is" should be " are". Thank you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr Peacock makes the general<br />
charge you have closed down the Costigan Commission effectively<br />
protecting the most powerful criminals in Australia according<br />
to Mr Peacock. He won't name names inside Parliament or<br />
outside Parliament but one person you are supposed to have<br />
protected is referred to as ' Goanna" in the current issue of<br />
the National Times. " Goanna's" real name has been the subjec:<br />
of notorious rumour around Parliament House for days. I ask<br />
you specifically did you close down the Costigan Commission to<br />
protect " Goanna" from being investigated, particularly in<br />
reference to the funding of drug trafficking.<br />
PM: Unequivocally no, and I am glad that question has been<br />
asked at the outset. You will notice in the statement that I<br />
have issued that I go to the fact that I had discussions with<br />
Mr Commissioner Costigan in 1983. And I put the view to him that<br />
in the limited time available to him that he should concentrate<br />
on the question of drugs. As I point out in my statement, he<br />
agreed with this and I expressed the view that I believed that-.<br />
Commissioner Costigan agreed with me, because he shared my viE! w<br />
about the abomination of the drug trade and its impact on our<br />
society. And I make it clear in my statements that I find that<br />
the one area in my thinking where I have difficulty in controlling<br />
rationality when I contemplate what should happen to those who<br />
are involved in the drug traffic. There is no matter which, for<br />
intimate reasons, I feel more strongly about than this. And may<br />
I say that it would be a matter of knowledge that colleagues in<br />
my government also have reason to share this feeling. And I find<br />
it difficult to express my revulsion, as I say in my statement.,<br />
about an allegation that suggests that I would in any way do<br />
anything to cover up or prevent the identification of anyone,<br />
whatever their station in life, who may be involved in this<br />
insidious and abominable traffic. I make the point to you, PEter,<br />
that I accept the rough and tumble of politics. I accept that<br />
hard statements can be made, but this suggestion that I would in<br />
any way remotely or directly or indirectly seek to cover up the<br />
identification of anyone engaged in this abomination is not ge~ tting<br />
into the gutter of politics, it is into the sewer of politics. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Sir, may I follow it up with a supplementary<br />
question, because I think we can now assume after Mr Costigan's<br />
special hearing yesterday that this material is official and<br />
represents part of the material passed from the Costigan<br />
Royal Commission to the National Crime Authority for ongoing<br />
investigation. Under the heading of " Goanna" is the reference<br />
Costin that is the shorthand for the Costigan Commission<br />
has investigated this allegation referring to the " Goanna"<br />
to a point, but is too severely constrained in time to complete<br />
it. That seems to suggest there, assuming the authenticity of:<br />
that statement that Mr Costigan wants to investigate further<br />
into " Goanna' s" activities in relation to the funding of drug<br />
trafficking and everything from land deais to suggestions of<br />
complicity in murder that he has been cut off, Sir, would you<br />
care to comment on that.<br />
PM: I certainly would care to comment, Peter. The statement<br />
m~ akes it clear that this Government, as the previous Governmet<br />
and this is a point I * think that has been made in Victoria<br />
today by Mr Cain at all points understood that the Costigan<br />
Royal Commission would come to be subsumed under the National<br />
Crime Authority when it is established. Now I want to make it.<br />
clear on your point which is an important one, that all the<br />
references, including the one from which you have quoted, have.<br />
been handed over to Mr Justice Stewart and his fellow Commissioners<br />
on the National Crime Authority. And so that what Mr Costigan<br />
has has been examined by them and they take the view, and I have<br />
made it clear to them, that it is our wish and it is theirs they<br />
have made it quite clear that they will pursue all matters<br />
referred if on their judgement, which is now they are the Authority,<br />
the material warrants such pursuit. And I cannot emphasise too<br />
strongly the way in which I have said to the National Crime<br />
Authority that this is the expectation of the Government and<br />
indeed let me say this that if there were any sense of<br />
suggestion that the material, having been handed over to the<br />
National Crime Authority were for some reason which escapes my<br />
comprehension, not pursued, then this would be a matter of the<br />
gravest concern to the Government. But let me make it clear<br />
that obviously I have no reason to believe that that would happen.<br />
And I say that because the members of the National Crime Authoritylet<br />
me remind you who they are Justice Stewart, probably the<br />
most experienced respected crime fighter in Australia, and you<br />
have in addition the two other members of the Authority Dwyer<br />
and Mr Bingham, and I remind you Peter, those two unanimously<br />
endorsed by all the governments of Australia, irrespective of<br />
political persuasions and you will recall that in my statement<br />
I refer to the observations by Mr Redlich in his report about the<br />
National Crime Authority being appropriately placed to continue<br />
investigations and may I just add to that report to quote<br />
from the report. On page 48 of his report he says that " throughout<br />
its long history the debate on the configuration of the authority<br />
has been influenced by the three factors".-and you are aware of<br />
the three factors. That is the optimum means of detecting and<br />
investigating organised criminal activity. Two the protection<br />
of civil liberties. Three -the integrity of the States and their<br />
law enforcement agencies. And he concludes on this point -" the<br />
National Crime Authority Act 84 gives genuine emphasis to all -three<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>considerations. The Authority has the scope to maintain the<br />
initiatives developed by the Costigan Royal Commission. There<br />
are substantial safeguards within the Act to protect the<br />
rights of witnesses and those under investigation. The States<br />
and their investigative agencies are given a voice in the<br />
operation of the Authority. The Authority must now be given<br />
an opportunity to work." And that is the position of the<br />
Government and I conclude my observation, therefore by saying,<br />
Peter, all the Costigan references including the ones you<br />
refer to have been ' handed over to that properly equipped<br />
Authority. It is my expectation and earnest hope that all the!<br />
matters will be thoroughly pursued. And if that should lead t~ o<br />
prosecutions, then so be it. And it woul-d be my hope that it<br />
happens. And, as I say in my statement, let the cards fall<br />
where they may.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on page 5 of your statement, Sir,<br />
you say" Mr Keating has already denied completely the allegations<br />
that he suggested to the Cabinet that the Costigan Commission<br />
should be prematurely terminated." That is apropros of stopping<br />
Costigan....... Was thdre any discussion by any Cabinet Minister<br />
in regard to stopping Costigan<br />
PM: Absolutely no suggestion. And indeed I trust that you<br />
know me well enough to know that I would repudiate any such<br />
suggestion. I repeat, and I can't emphasise it strongly<br />
enough, that when it comes to the sorts of issues that here<br />
involved and the one that I regard and . I think all Australians<br />
would share my view is the question of drugs there can be<br />
and there must be no pirotection of any person or any group of<br />
persons. The dangers that this insidious traffic constitutes<br />
for the well-being of this society is such that it is preposterous<br />
that there can be any barrier put in the way of the pursuit of<br />
those involved in this deadly traffic.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given the depth of your feelings on<br />
this subject, may I ask, do you intend to take legal action<br />
against any person who has made allegations?<br />
PM: Peter, I am glad that question has been asked. I think<br />
there has been a misunderstanding of what I thought I said very<br />
clearly. Let me repeat it so that there can be, I hope, no<br />
further misunderstanding. You will recall that .1 said I had<br />
been placed in an impossible situation. You will understand<br />
now from my further elaboration the depth of my feelings about<br />
this issue. I can't express the revulsion that I feel that<br />
there could be any allegation that I would do anything to protect<br />
anyone in respect of the pursuit of those involved in drugs.<br />
Now, the allegations have been made. Now, I obviously do not<br />
want to adopt the position which is going to prevent any people<br />
making statements or producing evidence which is relevant in<br />
this area. Now I have not instructed my solicitors to look at<br />
this matter. I have not. I have proceeded on the basis that<br />
although it seems to have a fast disappearing basis, I have<br />
proceeded in the hope that Mr Peacock will recognise the<br />
enormity of the allegation that he has made against me that Ic<br />
am a crook, that I associate with criminals, and I am directed<br />
by them. I have explained why I have thE! depth of the revuls..-on </p>
<p>that I have on this matter. So I am not taking action. I will<br />
let this matter go up until the. Parliament and in the hope<br />
that by then Mr Peacock will have the honour and the decency<br />
to retract, because, as I say, there is not a skerrick of<br />
substance in what he has done. And I simply have to say<br />
this,' though, that if after that -after the Parliament when<br />
he has had the full opportunity which I have allowed to him,<br />
if after the Parliament he should make these statements again,<br />
outside the Parliament, I am not p : repared to deny, not only to<br />
myself, but to my family, the protection which I believe they<br />
are entitled to under the law.<br />
JOURNALIST: Don't you think it makes something of a mockery<br />
of our political system if politicians feel inhibited in making<br />
statements about one another simply because there is a threat<br />
of legal action hanging over them?<br />
PM: I thought I had made it clear that I had not instructed<br />
my solicitors and I have expressed the hope that Mr Peacock<br />
will retract and I still have that hope. But I want to say this<br />
that we already have the demonstration that the people concerned<br />
Mr Peacock, Mr Steele . Hall are prepared to fabricate demonstrable<br />
untruths. I refer to the statement in the Parliament by Mr<br />
Steele Hall with the obvious support of Mr Peacock, that I had<br />
Mr Barron of my staff go to The Age and seek to have a story<br />
suppressed. Now that it totally untrue and Mr Burns has<br />
repudiated it and destroyed that lie. Now it seems to be<br />
implicit in what you are saying that to have these lies just being<br />
allowed to go on and on and I repeat that in public life you<br />
cannot, it seems to me, entirely abandon the rights that you have,<br />
because it is not only a matter affecting yourself. You don't<br />
cease to be a husband. You don't cease to be a father. My<br />
children and my wife have a right to be protected in this matter<br />
but I trust it will not be necessary.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, in that context, were you upset particularly<br />
at the National Times story about your daughter?<br />
PM: Of course I was because like any father I love my daughter.<br />
I trust her. And she was completely exonerated by the processes<br />
of the law. I had no contact with the Judge or anyone involved<br />
in it and yet you have this insinuation that affects her. Of<br />
course I'm upset.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when will we have an election date?<br />
PM: What I said before, that I will be making a statement on<br />
tEhat matter at the earliest possible opportunity. I gave the<br />
approximate time that I would be speaking on that and I adhere to<br />
that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Getting back to the Parliament. Should Mr Peacock,<br />
if he is going to continue this, name names. It is getting back<br />
to Peter Bowers point where it would seem that some have been<br />
bandied around the community lately......<br />
PM: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Should Mr Peacock if he wishes to pursue this<br />
Mr Hawke, get into a position where he actually starts naming<br />
names. I refer to Peter Bowers question.<br />
PM: I think the point, I an, is well covered by that statement<br />
on page 48 of Mr Redlich's Report, where he says there are<br />
three considerations, and three valid considerations. The most<br />
effective pursuit of criminal activity, the civil liberties of<br />
individuals, and the co-operation of the States. It seems to<br />
me that all of those points are important: and clearly if anyone<br />
is to be investigated whover they may be, then it is important<br />
firstly that those ifivestigations be able! to proceed in an<br />
unfettered way and in a way most likely to bring to justice<br />
whoever should be brought to justice. SEcondly the rights of<br />
individuals must be protected as Mr Redlich observed. And I<br />
think it is the view of all those~ who are involved in these<br />
matters, including Mr* Costigan, I would think the National Crime<br />
Authority, and Mr Temby, that nothing should be done that wil.<br />
inhibit either the capacity of the relevant authorities to<br />
pursue those who should be pursued and secondly to inhibit thE!<br />
rights of individuals. And it has been the view of all concerned<br />
up to this point that ' that will mean that particular names of<br />
those who maybe subject to investigation should in further<br />
processes should not be named. And I would hope that those<br />
involved on both sides of politics in this matter will not take<br />
action which will either place some inhibition on the capacity<br />
of the Authority to pursue those who should be pursued or to<br />
inhibit the rights of individuals. That is -as far as the<br />
Government is concerned, I made it cle ' ar in my statement before<br />
that we will be advised by Mr Costigan and by the National<br />
Crime Authority, by the Federal Commissioner of Police, and Mr<br />
Temby, I would think. Those are the sorts of people we would<br />
be advised by as to whether names should be released. We will<br />
take the proper-and strictly adhere to such advice about the<br />
naming of names and I would expect that th e obvious correctness<br />
of that would be appreciated by everyone.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what do you think the electoral effect<br />
of this whole issue is going to be?<br />
PM: Let me say this that I said before that there is no-one<br />
in public life whose life has been more of an open book than mine.<br />
I think the people of Australia know me. I think they respect me.<br />
They won't always agree with everything I have -every opinion I<br />
have expressed but I beleive that they will be appalled by th.' is<br />
totally unsustainable attack upon me. It is already obvious<br />
publicly and we also have other indications that not only has<br />
there been this public condemnation of Mr Peacock in the media,<br />
by a range of people, but there is obviously an enormous amount:<br />
disquiet within his own Party. I believe that this will work<br />
against the Liberal and National Parties.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you think the Government will actually gain in<br />
the electorate?<br />
PM: Yes, but it is not a way I want to gain. / 6 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can I seek a clarification. Are you<br />
saying that you still consider legal action if Mr Peacock<br />
only gives a repeat of the allegations outside Parliament,<br />
Or if he fails to withdraw...<br />
PM: I thought I had made it quite clear. It amazes me that<br />
you don't understand what I said. Let me repeat it so that<br />
you will. I said I have not instructed my solicitors to look<br />
at this matter. I said I had done this in the hope, which may<br />
be a disappearing hope -I have done it in the hope by the<br />
time Parliament resumes Mr Peacock will have the decency and thE<br />
honour to retract. I have said for the re, 4sons to which I have<br />
referred, and I apologize that I am emotional about it, but I<br />
have said that should Mr Peacock after the Parliament resumes<br />
not do that and repeat-again outside the Parliament those<br />
allegations which are totally without substance, then I am not<br />
going to deny to myself and to my family the rights to protect<br />
ourselves. Now it seems to me that that is crystal clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke,. do you know the identity of the " Goanna",<br />
and if so, have you ever met or had dealings with that person<br />
and was the " Goanna's" name one of those deleted from the<br />
Costigan correspondence which you tabled in Parliament?<br />
PM: I am not going to the question of individuals in the way<br />
that you put it and I thought I would have made it clear from<br />
my answer to this point the reasons why I am not going to it either<br />
directly or indirectly in the way you have put. The important<br />
point is this that I say again, I think I have said it a number<br />
of times today, I repeat without equivocation that this<br />
Government and this Prime Minister in particular will do nothing<br />
to protect anyone whether that person is known or not known to<br />
me, whatever the station in life of that person. If that person<br />
or persons on the basis of the decision of -the National Crime<br />
Authority with the material referred to it believes that a<br />
prosecution must follow, then not only will there be no attempt<br />
to protect any such person, but should I form the judgement that<br />
there has been any attempt, at any point by anyone to inhibit<br />
the pursuit of such person or persons, known or unknown to me,<br />
then all the force that I have to bear in my office will be<br />
brought to bear on that situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think you gave Mr Peacock a<br />
tactical advantage by waiting a week before you responded to<br />
the substance of the allegations in fact last Thursday.<br />
PM: I would have hoped that it be clear that I'm not concerned<br />
with tactical advantages in this matter, views have been expressed<br />
to call the Parliament back immediately and sought to take a<br />
tactical advantage in that way. I calmly came to the view that<br />
the processes of Government should proceed, members of Parliament,<br />
including ministers had made their plans for that two week break.<br />
Ministers are overseas on important government business, members;<br />
on both sides of the House are obviously engaged in important matters<br />
in their electorates, and it seemed to me appropriate to not do<br />
anything unusual in that respect. I want to say this, Greg, that. I<br />
had the hope that on calmer reflection Mr Peacock would do the<br />
honourable and the obviously honourable thing. And he has been<br />
given time to do that. He hasn't done it. And may I interpolate<br />
just as a matter of logic, he has made these charges and not it </p>
<p>appears according to his statement that if I say what I<br />
have already said about the making publicly available of the<br />
Costigan Report then he would withdraw the charges. A<br />
remarkable thing. I am a crook. I associate with criminals<br />
all in quotes from Mr Peacock. He alleges I am a crook,<br />
I associate with criminals and I am directed by criminals. He<br />
makes those allegations. They cease to be true if I do what<br />
I already said I would do. Now what I have tried to do is to<br />
play this matter which I think you can understand affects me<br />
deeply I have tried to play it in a reasonable way to allow<br />
Mr Peacock the opportunity of a retraction. It is not a<br />
question of tactics or tactical advantage. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, during the week the debate on<br />
this whole issue has' gone up some pretty extraordinary alleyways.<br />
One of them was that Andrew Peacock would disappear into the<br />
ether and Malcolm Fraser would return. What do you think of that?<br />
PM: Well, I don't want to compound the problems, self inflicted,<br />
of the Liberal Party, I simply say this that the leadership<br />
of the Liberal Party is a matter for them. There have been<br />
a range of observations by people within the Liberal Party<br />
and outside about the necessity for change. I will deal with<br />
whoever is the leader of the Party. I must say, if I can put<br />
this interpolation in, I felt a sense of some frustration that<br />
Mr Fraser resigned.' I would have liked to have had him across<br />
the table as Leader of the Opposition. And,<br />
JOURNALIST: So to speak.<br />
PM: So to speak, ye-s-, I take your point. No, just a minute<br />
I haven't finished. But let me say this there has been<br />
under his successor a departure from principles in a number<br />
of matters. I have referred, for instance particularly, to<br />
the attitudes towards South Africa. Mr Fraser would not have<br />
departed from that principle and I believe that Mr Fraser<br />
would not have descended into the sewers in the way that<br />
his successor has. But I repeat Jlet the Liberal Party make<br />
whatever decision it will, this Government under my leadershi'<br />
will go on with conducting the affairs, the important affairs,<br />
of this country in an efficient and an honourable fashion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given that, you've said that<br />
you would not table but make available'the Costigan Royal<br />
Commission Report when it became available even during the<br />
election campaign, but that Parliament will not be sitting<br />
P. M: I said should Parliament not be sitting.<br />
JOURNALIST: Yeah. What form of protection will there be as<br />
against parliamentary privilege for the release of that report.<br />
Will names therefore have to be deleted?<br />
PM: Well, I made it clear, just picking up the ' latter part of<br />
your question first. That whether the Parliament was sitting<br />
or not, you would have to consider the question of names for<br />
all the reasons that I have put. I mean this has been a fact<br />
in the past, it's a requirement of the authorities who have<br />
the responsibility of proceeding with prosecutions and<br />
investigations, that they don't want their capacities<br />
inhibited by identification. And you've also got the question<br />
of the rights of individuals concerned. So whether the Parliament<br />
was sitting or not, that's a question separate to the<br />
Parliament that depends upon those considerations that I alludE~ d<br />
to. But going to your first point that is a matter that we<br />
have to take into account. That's a matter on which we will<br />
be advised by the authorities that I have mentioned too and<br />
the Attorney General's Department to ensure that the protection<br />
of individuals, the proper protection of individuals, and the<br />
proper protection of the investigating authorities is not<br />
inhibited. And we will be advised on that and we take the<br />
advice given to us. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The makbrs of Simon Townsend's Wonder World, sir,<br />
have announced that they are planning a mini-series on your<br />
life, the Life of Bob, how do feel about that and how do you<br />
think it would rate.<br />
PM: How do I feel about it. Well, as 3' say Laurie, I've said<br />
earlier, I guess there's no-one in public life who has been<br />
more of an open book. I have prepared, I have been prepared<br />
to allow it out, warts and all, as I have used. I haven't<br />
addressed my mind this other sort of aspect that you have<br />
talked about so I capi't give you an answrer to it. But as to<br />
the latter part of your question, how do I think it would rate,<br />
I understand that-the authorised biography is sold rather well,<br />
it may suggest that there may be some interest. But that'll<br />
be for others to decide.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, do-You think there's an actor who could<br />
play the title role?<br />
PM: I haven't got the time, nor the lines now to cover the<br />
earlier period.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, in view of Mr Costigan's commnents<br />
about the powers of the National Crimes Authority, will the<br />
Government give any consideration to strengthening the National<br />
Crimes Authority.<br />
PM: Well, what you must appreciate of it that the process of<br />
arriving at the National Crimes Authority has been one which<br />
has involved the political processes of this Parliament,<br />
c4iscussions with the States, because at all points it has<br />
been understood that if we're going to have the maximum<br />
efficiency you have got to have a structure and a system<br />
which will ensure the full co-operation of the States not<br />
only as governments but of the police forces of the states.<br />
I think the statement on page 48 of Mr Redlich's report sums<br />
it up, that he says well all the debate, you will recall the<br />
actual words that he uses that I read out, he says " throughout<br />
its long history the debate on the configuration has been<br />
influenced by the three'factors", I won't read them again,<br />
but it has been influenced by those three factors. And he<br />
says that the Act as it stands now gives genuine emphasis to<br />
all those considerations and he lists them and then says<br />
" the Authority must now be given an opportunity-to work".<br />
So Mr Costigan, for whom I have publicly, as you know already,<br />
expressed the greatest admiration for what he has done. He has<br />
his views and his views are entitled to respect. He participated<br />
in the seminar that was held in the Parliament. His views have<br />
been expressed, the views of others have been expressed and I<br />
think that Mr , Redlich has put it correctly. There has been a<br />
debate. The Chairman of the Authority has been asked directly<br />
by me, as I say in my statement, is there anything more the<br />
Government can do, and he said no, there is no more the<br />
Goverrnent can do. I asked him, will it be an effective<br />
authority to fight organised crime, he said yes it will be.<br />
Now it seems to me that having gone through all those processes<br />
where there are differences of emphases, let's see if it can<br />
work. I am confident that the community will respect </p>
<p>Mr Justice Stewart's assessment. I believe they will respect<br />
the assessment of Mr. Max Bingham and of Mr Dwyer. Now that's<br />
the view that I have expressed. What I want to do now is to<br />
see that it can get on with its job.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, what do you say to Mr Peacock's suggestion<br />
that the hiatus between the Costigan Commission finishing<br />
its investigation in June and the National Crimes Authority<br />
being fully started sometime after the end of October. Will<br />
it lead to the trail going cold, as Mr Peacock suggested,<br />
the investigations into the<br />
PM: Well, may I say-this and I remain as cool as I can about<br />
it. I would have thought that the community would place greater<br />
reliance on the judgement of Mr Justice S~ Tewart and Mr Binghamu<br />
and Mr Dwyer in this respect than they would upon the allegations<br />
of a man who has been totally di~ creditei.<br />
