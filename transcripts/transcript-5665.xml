FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13 1981<br />
STATEMENT TO THE PARLIAMENT ON THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING<br />
Mr Speaker, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting,<br />
held in Melbourne and Canberra between 30 September and 7 Octobe;<br />
was a success for Australia and the Commonwealth, and it can<br />
be expected to have an influence on world discussions..<br />
The meeting confounded the critics who had predicted that<br />
differences of view would lead to division, and that irrelevant<br />
issues would distract attention from the fundamental themes.<br />
In fact, a spirit of compromise and practicality enabled 41<br />
very disparate countries, most with strongly held views of<br />
their own, to reach agreement on a range of issues, and indeed,*<br />
to agree to act on many of them.<br />
The Commonwealth is a remarkable international organisation<br />
not only because its meetings are for Heads of Government<br />
rather than for officials or Foreign Ministers, not only<br />
because the meetings themselves occupy a period of time<br />
which allows for thorough as well as wide-ranging deliberations,<br />
not only because the membership-of the Commonwealth cuts across<br />
some of the most significant lines of-division in the world,<br />
and not only because the Commonwealth countries themselves<br />
comprise above one quarter of the world's population.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has said that the sole common<br />
link between the members of the Commonwealth is that they<br />
are all former British colonies, but in addition to the<br />
fact that we all also speak a common language, in addition<br />
to the fact that we all, as President Kaundaof Zambia put it, gainec<br />
our independence from the British using their language,<br />
there is the further bond, again remarked on by President Kaunda,<br />
of a similar legal and administrative background among<br />
Commonwealth countries.<br />
I-would add that in a world which is still unfortunately<br />
marred by racialism, it is a truly satisfying experience to<br />
be in and of a gathering which repudiates racialism not only<br />
in words but by its nature. In the Commonwealth, brown, black<br />
and white meet as equals and friends,' and as President Kaunda<br />
put it, " if God had made people green I am sure they would be<br />
represented in the Commonwealth as well". </p>
<p>So far as Australia itself is. concerned, the sudcess of the conferenc<br />
must be measured not only in the fact that the issues we had<br />
identified beforehand as central indeed turned out to be so,-<br />
and not merely in the fact that our contributions to the<br />
discussions on these central issues were successful in<br />
advancing several initiatives regarding them. I believe<br />
that we have emerged from the meeting with an enhanced<br />
reputation as an active and concerned member of the<br />
Commonwealth, as an enlightened and responsible middle power.<br />
Earlier this year, the Leader of the Opposition, in discussing<br />
the Australian Labor Party's foreign policy beliefs, said,<br />
" Australia and Australians can achieve anything on their<br />
own" Such words are not mere grandstanding, they are f ancif ul<br />
and ill-considered, especially when he has no practical<br />
proposals to help create more wealth or to improve the living<br />
standards cif people in developing countries, or indeed to<br />
advance the causes of peace and stability on any other<br />
significant issues.<br />
The Government's approach to its role in world affairs is<br />
vastly different, for we recognise the contribution we can<br />
make and the role we can play. We accept the responsibilities<br />
of that role, and are prepared to take such steps as we can<br />
towards helping to make the world a better and more secure<br />
place for our children.<br />
From the purely Australian point of view, a further gain<br />
and success from the Commonwealth meeting has been that<br />
our visitors were impressed by Australia as a friendly<br />
and vital country with a great_ future. I want to pay<br />
tribute to those people, for the most part ordinary Australians,<br />
f rom right around the country but especially f rom Melbourne<br />
and Canberra, who conveyed to all the visitors the<br />
friendliness and confidence that the world now regards as<br />
characteristic of Australia, aY1&amp; who helped to make our<br />
visitors ambassadors for Australia.<br />
The tributes to Australia from the visitors will surely be<br />
pleasing to all Members of the House, and indeed to all<br />
Australians. Pierre Trudeau went so far as to say that the<br />
century can be said to belong to Australia. President Kaunda<br />
said that in the last few years his view of Australia has<br />
changed from one of " a country where there was indifference<br />
to suffering people of the rest of the world to one of<br />
" decent human beings, an Australia with which we are very proud<br />
to be associated". And Sir Dennis Hamilton, of the Commonwealth<br />
Press Union., went out of his way # Lo~ say that " the sense of<br />
self confidence of people ( in Australia) at every level<br />
that they can tackle any problems is a bit of a refreshE~ r<br />
and encouragement for some of us who have come from some<br />
of the old countries".<br />
I could instance many other tributes of a similar kind,<br />
but these are representative, and give the House the flavour<br />
of our visitors' impressions. And they show-that the Leader of the<br />
opposition's view of the meeting, at least before it was held,<br />
as " an extravagant indulgehce", reflected a quite distorted<br />
idea of the impact which the meeting would have on the way in which<br />
Australia is regarded in other parts of the world. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
From the Commonwealth point of view, the success of the<br />
Melbourne meeting can also be measured in several ways.<br />
The vitality of the Commonwealth was evident in the fact<br />
that three new members were present, and let me add that not<br />
a single member of the meeting, in welcoming Zimbabwe, would<br />
have found anything " quaint" or " ironical", to use the words<br />
of the Leader of the Opposition, in the fact that Australia<br />
played a role in the establishment by the Commonwealth at the<br />
Lusaka meeting of the conditions in which Zimbabwe was able<br />
to achieve independence.<br />
The nature of the discussions between the Commonwealth<br />
leaders in Melbourne and Canberra, the meeting of minds<br />
that occurred, the understanding and friendships which<br />
were created, was a further confirmation of the relevance<br />
of the Commonwealth in a world in which divisions can too<br />
easily become entrenched, and in which a needless lack of<br />
understanding so often prevents the achievement of real<br />
solutions. I believe that the success of the meeting for the<br />
Commonwealth will also turn out to be a success so far as<br />
the international community is concerned. The Commonwealth<br />
is obviously not an organisation with the power to settle<br />
major world issues, but between the extremes of either<br />
achieving a dramatic conclusive impact which will turn<br />
everything around, and of having no effect at all, there<br />
is room for the kind of influence which the Commonwealth<br />
can have, and which can be so important in achieving the<br />
right outcome rather than the wrong one.<br />
The Commonwealth role is to a considerable extent a matter<br />
of helping, in an incremental fashion, to shape opinion one<br />
way rather than the other, to change the balance of considerations<br />
operating on those who have to make the big decisions, to ensure<br />
that there are no miscalculations because strongly held views*-iehve<br />
not been clearly heard. The Melbourne meeting sent out a<br />
number of signals which, because of their timing and because<br />
they represent the views of a significant group of leaders,<br />
will register with other governments, which, indeed, are<br />
already registering and having an impact. Strongly supportive<br />
comments about the value of the Declaration and the Communique<br />
such as that the Declaration appears to be a ' very significant<br />
document which would no doubt be widely discussed', and that<br />
both the Declaration and the Communique would be helpful in<br />
setting the scene' for Cancun, have been received at many<br />
of our missj~ ons.<br />
The Melbourne Declaration and the Communique from the meeting<br />
are complementary documents. The Melbourne Declaration is<br />
a statement of resolve by 41 Heads of Government designed to<br />
demand urgent action to alleviate the plight of hundreds of<br />
millions of people living in absolute poverty, designed also<br />
to point out the despair which these conditions engender, and.<br />
the insecurity which can so easily be encouraged when such conditions<br />
prevail. ./ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Mr Speaker, when the House ponders the Melbourne Declaration<br />
it might bear in mind the words of Pierre Trudeau at the<br />
meeting that " history will judge this year as a watershed<br />
in North/ South relations", and Mrs Gandhi's hope that the<br />
voices of the countries of the Commonwealth will reach out<br />
to Cancun.<br />
The Comm unique addresses virtually every major issue facing<br />
the world today, and it reaches conclusions and makes<br />
recommendations concerning many of them and despite the<br />
need for compromise to achieve maximum consensus, it says some<br />
very pointed things. On the economic side, it addresses all<br />
the main topics encompassed by the North/ South dialogue.<br />
It expresses strong support for an early resumption of<br />
global negotiations and seeks ways of improving the negotiating<br />
process. It strongly reaffirms opposition to protectionism and<br />
sets up an expert study group to examine the impact which<br />
protectionism has on developing countries. It supports the<br />
early establishment of an energy affiliate of the World<br />
Bank and a number of other practical measures relating to energy<br />
to be taken by the Commonwealth itself. It expands the<br />
Commonwealth's capacity to assist the food needs of developing<br />
Commonwealth members, supports increased food aid, improved<br />
food security arrangements and increased assistance for<br />
agricultural development. It reaffirms support for the<br />
Common Fund and outlines practical measures to be taken<br />
within the Commonwealth to assist commodity exporters.<br />
And it makes a number of recommendations for an expansion<br />
of the capacity of international financial institutions<br />
to help developing countries.'<br />
I should add that in addition to what is in the Communique,<br />
Australia has taken a number of initiatives of its own'which<br />
will support and supplement the Communique's contents and<br />
general thrust. Among these are an increase in overseas<br />
Development Assistance for the 1981/ 82 financial year by<br />
$ 100 million or 18%, to bring the ratio of ODA to GDP up<br />
from 0.43% to an estimated 0.45%. Australia's food aid programme<br />
and assistance for agricultural development has been substantially<br />
expanded. Food aid has been increased by 15% to $ 100 million<br />
in 1981/ 82 allowing about 445,000 tonnes of grain to be given,-<br />
up from 400,000 tonnes in 1980/ 81 and 225,000 tonnes only a<br />
few years ago.<br />
And Australia is more than satisfying its obligations under<br />
world food programme targets. Australia has increased its<br />
contribution to the international emergency food reserve from<br />
30,000 tonnes to 45,000 tonnes. We are paying the freight on<br />
an increasing proportion of our food aid, including on 80,000-<br />
tonnes to Africa. Australia is establishing a centre for<br />
international agricultural research, to mobilise Australian<br />
agricultural expertise to address problems of importance to<br />
developing countries. In addition, we are continuing to give<br />
priority within our regular aid programme to agricultural<br />
development. </p>
<p>On energy, Australia has pledged an additional $ 1 million<br />
in Nairobi for assistance for new and renewable energy sources.<br />
Australia has offered to make available to all Commonwealth<br />
countries, information and experience through the Commonwealth<br />
Regional Renewable Energy Resources Information System and also<br />
to make available to Commonwealth countries an exhibition of<br />
new and renewable energy technology which is being prepared<br />
as part of the work of the CHOGRM Energy Group.<br />
On commodity trade, Australia has signed the instrument<br />
for ratification of the Common Fund Agreement and is making a<br />
voluntary contribution of $ 5.5 million to its second account<br />
( for the promotion of development, marketing and production).<br />
. On trade, Australia has recently extended and liberalised<br />
preferences of significant interest to developing countries<br />
to the whole textiles, clothing and footwear area. Imports in 1977-78<br />
accounted for 40% of the Australian market for textiles,. 20% for<br />
clothing, and 28% for footwear. In addition a wide variety of products now<br />
receive special preferences in the South Pacific trading region. Australia' s<br />
continuing examination of protection and the IAC general reference were noted<br />
and appreciated by Heads oT Government.<br />
On the political side, there is in the Communique: a reaffirmation<br />
of the Gleneagles Declaration; a strong statement on Namibia,<br />
with agreement between the contact group, front line and other<br />
members on the need for intensified efforts to seek settlement<br />
on the basis of Resolution 435; on Poland, agreement that the<br />
people of Poland should be left to determine their own destiny<br />
free from foreign interference; on Afghanistan and Kampuchea,<br />
strong agreement on the need for the withdrawal of foreign<br />
troops; on Africa, the view that African states should be<br />
able to pursue their own affairs without interference from<br />
any source; on the Law of the Seaf, affirmation of the need<br />
for a convention to be concluded speedily; on the South Pacific,<br />
support for the call by the countries of the region for an<br />
immediate end to nuclear testing, and a welcoming of the<br />
decision by the South Pacific Forum to send a mission to<br />
France to discuss the future of French territories in the Pacific.<br />
There was also very informal discussion among some leaders on the<br />
general question of re-admission to the Commonwealth. This is;<br />
a new question which the Commonwealth has not had to consider<br />
before, and government leaders will be keeping in touch on<br />
the matter.<br />
Mr Speaker, at the opening of the conference two weeks ago,<br />
I spoke of the intractable nature of the problems on our<br />
agenda and of the need, therefore, to think in terms of improvements<br />
and progress rather than total solutions. I spoke of the need.<br />
to define success in realistic terms. In those terms, which<br />
are the only ones which can seriously be countenanced this<br />
conference speaks for itself.<br />
I want to make one comment about the security arrangements<br />
for the conference, because they have attracted a good deal<br />
of interest and attention, and the Leader of the opposition<br />
actually described them as " somewhat ridiculous and, frankly,<br />
frightening". The frightening thing is not the arrangements<br />
that we made, but the fact that we live in a world in which<br />
such arrangements are necessary. But the inconveniences were<br />
miinimised, and I am sure that I speak for the vast majority of / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Australians when I say, especially thinking of the assassinations<br />
and attempted assassinations of world leaders which have<br />
taken place this yea; that I am glad we took the precautions<br />
we did, glad that so many leaders commented so favourably<br />
on the arrangements we had made, and glad that the meeting<br />
passed without any incidents occurring.<br />
Mr Speaker, three years ago, and again seven months ago,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition said that the Commonwealth is<br />
an " anachronistic institution, a talk shop of dubious value<br />
to Australia". I hope that the success of the Melbourne<br />
meeting has changed his view, as it has undoubtedly convinced<br />
countless Australians of the value of the Commonwealth.<br />
The Commonwealth is an instrument which enables the leaders<br />
of many countries, from many continents, to come together<br />
as colleagues and friends to make a contribution to the<br />
continuing process of resolving the world's problems.<br />
That is what the meeting at Melbourne was all about.<br />
