BRISBANE PRESS CLUB<br />
OPENING STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISfER<br />
29 NOVEMBER 1974<br />
IN THIS CAMPAIGN, I HAVE DRAWN ATTENTION TO<br />
THE SELFISH AND SHORT-SIGHTED POLICIES OF THE QUEENSLAND<br />
GOVERNMENT, QUEENSLAND'S FAILURE TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DEPRIVED THE STATE OF $ 50 MILLION<br />
IN MUCH-NEEDED FUNDS AND RETARDED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THIS<br />
FAILURE TO CO-OPERATE IS NOT CONFINED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS<br />
SUCH AS . AND COMMISSIONS AND GROWTH CENTRES, IT IS<br />
REFLECTED IN A GENERAL INDIFFERENCE ON QUEENSLAND'S PAST<br />
TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THE NATION.<br />
Stl'H A PROBLEM IS UNEMPLOYMENT. THE SAD FACT IS THAT<br />
UNEMPLIY: ENT IN QUEENSLAND IS RISING FASTER THAN ANYWHEr<br />
ELSE IN AUSTRALIA. MY GOVERNMENT IS DOING ITS BEST<br />
CHECK UNEMPLOYMENT. MR BJELKl--PETERSEI. IS DOING NOThi. G,<br />
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT GOVERN;.,. NT EXPENDITURF<br />
IS IMPORTANT IN PROVIDING JOBS. IT IS DIRECTLY IM: ORTANT<br />
THROUGh -iE PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYS IN THE PLBLIC<br />
SERVICE; IT IS IND -CTLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE<br />
CONTRACTORS WHO WORK ON MMENT PROJECTS AN: THROUGH<br />
THE EXTRA DEMAND FOR GOODS AND SERVICES CREATED BY ANY<br />
KIND OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE. STATE GOVERNMENTS'<br />
EXPENDITURE IS AS IMPORTANT IN CREATING JOBS AS EXPENDITURE<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>QUEENSLANDERS SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES WHY " I1i"<br />
INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN MOST RAPID IN THIS<br />
STATE. I BELIEVE THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS ARE<br />
THE FAILURE OF THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT TO CO-OPERATE<br />
WITH THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE INEFFICIENCY<br />
OF THIS STATE GOVERNMENT IN SPENDING EXTRA MONEY WE<br />
HAVE GIVEN THEM. QUEENSLAND HAS THE WORST UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
IN AUSTRALIA BECAUSE THE QUEENSLAND STATE GOVERNMENT IS<br />
UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO SPEND AMOUNTS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO OFFER.<br />
THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN I HAVE REFERRED TO<br />
TWO AREAS IN WHICH THE QUEENSLAND STATE GOVERNMENT,<br />
UNLIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES WHETHER LIBERAL,<br />
LABOR OR COUNTRY PARTY, HAS REFUSED TO CO-OPERATE WITH<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
WIL' NOT ALLOW SPECULATORS TO REAP EXCESSIVE LAND<br />
DEVELOP, '. IT PROFITS. WE THEREFORE INSIST ON LAND PRICE<br />
STABILISATION IN OUR PROGRAM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
GROWTH CENTRES IN OUR PROGRAM FOR THE ACQUISITION<br />
OF LAND TO BE DEVELOPED BY A JOINT AUSTRALIAN-STATE<br />
" RNMENT COMMISSION AND SOLD AT COST. WE 1ST THAT<br />
LAND SPECULATORS SHOULD NOT PROFIT FROM GOVERNMENT DECISIO<br />
OF THIS OBVTOUSLY THE DECLARATION OF A REGION AS<br />
A GROWTH CENTRE INCRL ' FS LAND PRICES. ,, 13 </p>
<p>-3<br />
S-35<br />
AI. L WE ASK MR BJELKE-PETERSEN TO DO iis ro sir-: : I. LY<br />
TIHE SAME AGREEMENTS, IN PRECISELY TIHE SAME TERMS, AS<br />
THOSE SIGNED BY SIR IOI: RT ASKIN, MR IHAMER AND) ' iR CHARLES<br />
COURT AND ADMINISTERED IN SOME CASES BY COUNTRY PARTY<br />
MINISTERS, NONE OF THESE PEOPLE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS<br />
CENTRALISTS. THEY COULD NOT FIND UNACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS<br />
OR HIDDEN TERMS IN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S OFFER,<br />
THE PREMIERS OF THE OTHER LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY STATES<br />
HAVE ACCEPTED THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT THAT<br />
THESE PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY LAND SPECULATION<br />
WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE COSTS OF TIHE PROGRAMS AT THE<br />
EXPENSE OF THE AUSFRALIAN TAXPAYER. THE RESULT IS<br />
MILLION LOST TO THIS STATE $ 50 MILLION WHICH EVEN<br />
NOW WOULD BE REFLECTED IN YOUR STATE'S ECONOMY IN THE<br />
FORM OF EXTRA DEMAND FOR GOODS AND SERVICES AND DIRECT<br />
EMPLOYMENT IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY. ONE CANNOT SAY<br />
PRE-TSELY HOW MANY JOBS THIS WOULD MEAN TO QUEENSLAND<br />
BUT THE 7 3URE WOULD BE COUNTED IN THOUSANDS.<br />
MANY OTHER JOBS ARE BEING LOSI" TO OUEENSLA'. D<br />
BECAUSE OF THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE STATE GOVERNMLNT IN<br />
" SPONDING TO OFFERS OF ASSISTANCE. IHERE AR LARGE<br />
NUMBER OF SEPARATE EXPENDITURE AREAS OF THE AUSTRALi<br />
GOVERNMEI WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO TOP UP EXPENDITURES<br />
OF THE STATE GOVERNML TO PROVIDE FURTHER FUNJDS IN<br />
AREAS WHICH ARE THE PRIMAR, , i;"' NSIBILITY OF S,' TE<br />
GOVERNMENTS. To SPEND MONEY ON SUCH PROGRAMS THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST RELY ON THE ADMINISTRATION<br />
AND THE PLANNING OF EACH STATE GOVERNMENT. ,/ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
BEFORE WE CAN COMMIT SUCH FUNDS TO QUIJEENSLAND, THE<br />
QUEENSLAND STATE GOVERNMENT MUST FIRST DRAW UP PLANS<br />
FOR NEW PROJECTS AND BE PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT THEM AS<br />
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.<br />
LET ME GIVE ONE EXAMPLE. IN JUNE OF THIS<br />
YEAR I GAVE ALL STATE GOVERNMENTS A BLANK CHEQUE ON<br />
WELFARE HOUSING. I SAID THEN, AND I REPEAT IT NOW,<br />
THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE ANY AMOUNTS<br />
FOR WELFARE HOUSING THAT THE STATES ARE ABLE TO SPEND.<br />
WE HAVE HONOURED THAT UNDERTAKING AND ONLY THIS MONTH<br />
WE ALLOCATED A FURTHER $ 8 MILLION FOR QUEENSLAND FOR<br />
THIS PURPOSE WHEN THEY SHOWED THEY HAD THE. PLANS<br />
READY AND COULD SPEND THE MONEY. THIS YEAR $ 35.4 MILLION<br />
WILL BE SPENT IN QUEENSLAND UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH STATE<br />
HOUSING GRANT. THIS COMPARES WITH AN AMOUNT PAID LAST<br />
YE. R OF $ 17.4 MILLION.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY IS<br />
WORSE IN QUEENSLAND THAN IN ANv OTHER S" ATE, IT SHOb,.<br />
NOT EXIST, AND IF THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT WERE READY<br />
TO SPEND FURTHER FUNDS ON WELFARE HOUSING iT ' UULD inT<br />
EXIST. THERE IS NO REASON WHY FURTHER FUND-ANNG"; zE<br />
SPENi TYEAR, EXCEPT THAT THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMU: T<br />
IS NOT PREPIED TO SÃ¸ END THEM. IT DOES NOT H:.' VE THE<br />
PLANS TO ACCEPT THE AUS, AI TA , OVERNMENT'S BL. C.-: rUE, </p>
<p>OTHER STATES DO. IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA LAST YEAR, WE lNT<br />
$ 32.75 MILLION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND FOR THIS FINANCIAL<br />
YEAR WE WILL SPEND $ 45.36 MILLION. THAT IS, FOR THE<br />
TWO YEARS OF THIS AGREEMENT SOUTH AUSTRALIA WITH A<br />
POPULATION TWO-THIRDS THAT OF QUEENSLAND IS ABLE TO<br />
ACCEPT AND SPEND MORE THAN $ 35 MILLION MORE THAN<br />
QUEENSLAND, IF THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT WERE AS<br />
EFFICIENT AS IT SHOULD BE, THE $ 88 MILLION SPENT IN<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA SHOULD CONSTITUTE ONLY TWO-THIRDS OF<br />
THE AMOUNT SPENT IN QUEENSLAND DURING THESE TWO YEARS.<br />
FOR THESE TWO YEARS, QUEENSLAND SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED<br />
OVER $ 80 MILLION 11ORE THAN IT RECEIVED IN HOUSING GRANTS<br />
FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, THERE WOULD BE NO<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY IF THE QUEENSLAND<br />
GOVERNMENT HOUSING AUTHORITIES WERE AS EFFECTIVE AS<br />
THOSE IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE COMPARISON I HAVE MADE IN WELFARE HOUSING<br />
CAN BE REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN, IN CONTRAST WITH TF<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALI. A GOVERNMENT, THE QUEENS_.\ ND GOVERNMENT<br />
IS APPARENTLY UNABLE TO SPENDAUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
IONEY TO THE SAME DEGREE THAT SOUTH AUSTRAL;-CAN,<br />
PtRTICULARLY IN THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE INTRO2UCED,<br />
S/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE HAS GOT OFF LIE GRCLD<br />
MORE SLOWLY THAN THAT IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND THIS DEPENDS<br />
COMPLETELY ON THE ABILITY OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO<br />
PREPARE PLANS AND ADMINISTER PROJECTS. AREAS IN WHICH<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CAN SPEND MORE OR ABOUT THE<br />
SAME AMOUNT AS THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT INCLUDE HOSPITALS,<br />
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES, DENTAL HEALTH SCHEMES, MENTAL<br />
HEALTH SCHEMES, HOMES AND HOSTELS FOR AGED PERSONS,<br />
TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE INJECTION OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT FUNDS FOR THE BUILDING OF SCHOOLS. BY<br />
NOVEMBER 18 SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAD REQUESTED 32% OF ITS<br />
ALLOCATION FOR THE YEARS 1974-75 BUT QUEENSLAND HAD<br />
REQUESTED ONLY 18% THE LOWEST OF ANY STATE IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
IF THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT HAD REQUESTED THE SAME<br />
PROP -' rON OF EDUCATION GRANTS AS THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN.<br />
GOVERNMEN. AS ALREADY REQUESTED IT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED<br />
IN EXCESS OF $ 3 MILLION MORE FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION,<br />
BECAUSE OF ITS INi,_. ILITY TO DO SO, ITS INABILITY TO PLAN<br />
Ar'D ADMINISTER ITS PROJECTS AS EFFICIENTLY AS THE SOUTH<br />
AL TR'LIAN GOVERNMENT, THESE FURTHER FUNDS WIt' -3T<br />
BE SPENT. SCHOOLS WHICH MIGHT HAVE OPENED AT THE<br />
BEGINNING Or THE FIRST SCHOOL TERM NEXT YEAR WIIL NOT<br />
BE ABLE TO OPEN, IF Th. -UNDS HAD BEEN SPENT, UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY IN UL-LL AND IN THE DIFV7CULI<br />
MONTHS AHEAD WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY LESS, </p>
