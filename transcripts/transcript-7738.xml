PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
The Australian economy is facin g an exceptionally<br />
serious challenge it is a situation of national<br />
emergency. The Government, the airlines and the<br />
responsible union movement are meeting this in the only<br />
way possible.<br />
The challenge arises because the Australian Federation<br />
of Air Pilots ( AFAP') refuses to negotiate within the<br />
wage fixing guidelines. They have repeatedly stated<br />
that they seek a resolution of their demands outside the<br />
guidelines and the umbrella of the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission. Such a stance has frustrated continued<br />
attempts by the airlines to negotiate wage increases.<br />
The AFAP has been planning for " battle" since early this<br />
year, as revealed in circulars to members urging<br />
preparation for a significant " non-income period" or<br />
NIP. The AFAP has adopted the contradictory position of<br />
wanting to be treated as business executives, but at the<br />
same time using monopoly power to hold a gun at the head<br />
of the airlines and the Australian people.<br />
The Federation repeats parrot-fashion a willingness to<br />
negotiate. The Opposition Leader, Mr Peacock, suggests<br />
government intervention to arrange talks between the<br />
airlines and the AFAP.<br />
The truth is that these are completely empty gestures,<br />
devoid of sincerity and sense. They fail completely to<br />
understand the essence of the challenge faced by the<br />
Australian people.<br />
For the airlines to negotiate outside the wage fixing<br />
guidelines would, in itself, destroy the wages system<br />
and extensively damage the Australian economy. To sit<br />
down and talk with a union only wanting wage increases<br />
outside the guidelines and the scrutiny of the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission would bring grave<br />
consequences this Government is determined to avoid. 17 83* h </p>
<p>Wage increases outside the wage guidelines for AFAP<br />
pilots would see a wage explosion, even worse than 1982,<br />
with the inevitable consequence of inflation and<br />
unemployment out of control, and with all the human<br />
suffering and economic damage that involves.<br />
Explosive wage increases would take away all the<br />
opportunities for the future which the restraint and<br />
responsibility of the Australian workforce and<br />
Australian people have made possible over the past six<br />
years. They would push up interest rates, destroy company<br />
profits, push up unemployment and so destroy the<br />
progress Australia is currently making through record<br />
investment and employment growth to rebuild the<br />
economy's capacity.<br />
The key to Australia's future represented by the<br />
tremendous co-operative achievement of unions, business<br />
and Government in restructuring the Australian<br />
industrial award system now at the very threshold of<br />
success would be totally nullified.<br />
A general pay grab by those able to get it would come<br />
from the pockets of wage earners not able or willing to<br />
adopt standover tactics, and from the pockets of<br />
pensioners and other social security beneficiaries not<br />
able to protect themselves in an economic free for all.<br />
There can be no doubt that, substantial as they are, the<br />
costs of resisting the Federation's demands pale into<br />
insignificance beside the absolutely unacceptable costs<br />
of giving in to them.<br />
Following AFAP inspired resignations we find ourselves<br />
in a situation in which the relationship between the<br />
pilots and the airlines has been severed. The airlines<br />
need to rebuild their operational capacity. This will<br />
take time and so a national effort is required to cope<br />
with the immediate consequences of the pilots'<br />
resignations. This is of paramount importance in containing the damage<br />
done. The airlines, the Government and the responsible<br />
unions are doing everything in their power to have the<br />
maximum number of planes flying as soon as possible.<br />
Committing substantial resources to achieving this<br />
objective is the best way the Government can assist<br />
those sectors of the economy suffering as a result of<br />
the damage done to the operational capacity of our<br />
domestic airline industry. The Government is, of<br />
course, particularly concerned about the impact on our<br />
1 7e4 </p>
<p>tourist industry and is convinced that the only<br />
effective way to alleviate its plight is to provide as<br />
great as possible a level of service.<br />
The airlines have taken three broad steps towards this<br />
rebuilding exercise.<br />
First, they have sought to rehire those who have<br />
resigned. Contracts have been offered with conditions<br />
within wage fixing guidelines, containing productivityrelated<br />
wage increases. Some former pilots, including<br />
some who earlier resigned and who were not management<br />
pilots, have signed up. They will allow Ansett and<br />
Australian increasingly to fly their own aircraft. This<br />
process, however, must and will be handled with care.<br />
Given the delicacy of the issue, and scheduling needs, a<br />
critical mass of pilots is needed before all pilots who<br />
have signed contracts can begin active duty.<br />
Second, attempts have been made to hire new pilots.<br />
Advertisements have been placed in Australian and<br />
overseas newspapers, and recruitment offices have been<br />
staffed in London and Los Angeles. The response has so<br />
far been good, and can only increase once it is clearly<br />
understood that long term career opportunities are being<br />
offered. Third, the airlines are bringing in overseas chartered<br />
aircraft and crews so that they can sustain operations<br />
in the shorter term. This operation has inevitably<br />
begun slowly as CAA processes are faced with<br />
unprecedented demands. Because the Government and the<br />
airlines do not intend to prejudice safety standards in<br />
any way, the process of adapting to these demands is<br />
inevitably slow to begin with.<br />
These steps, after a necessarily gradual start, will see<br />
an acceleration in the growth of available capacity.<br />
They both cater for immediate needs and allow for the<br />
complete rebuilding of airline capacity even if no<br />
further pilots who resigned wish to return to work.<br />
Of course, the most desirable path is for those who have<br />
resigned both to consider those industries severely<br />
damaged by the actions of the AFAP and their own futures<br />
carefully. In the interests of all Australians I appeal<br />
to all pilots to sign on for work. But I must emphasise<br />
the rebuilding task will go on: the only question for<br />
individual pilots is whether it goes on with them or<br />
without them.<br />
The Government is assisting in every way it can.<br />
The airlines are not able to stand down staff because 17 </p>
<p>this would undermine their ability to rebuild<br />
operational capacity. It is simply industrial reality<br />
that mass standowns will jeopardise the co-operation of<br />
other unions in the effort to -rebuild flight capacity.<br />
This places an intolerable strain on the financial<br />
resources of the airlines, one that would not apply in a<br />
usual industrial dispute where mass standowns could be<br />
contemplated. In recognition of the importance of<br />
providing the highest level of service immediately, of<br />
facilitating as smooth a rebuilding of airline<br />
operations as possible, and of avoiding the dissipation<br />
of a highly skilled workforce, building on the agreement<br />
between the ACTU and the airlines and the treatment of<br />
staff affected by the dispute, the Government has agreed<br />
to forego CAA and FAC charges normally payable by the<br />
airlines equal to the cost of retaining staff on their<br />
payrolls in accordance with that agreement. Such staff<br />
will be required to take appropriate leave and be<br />
willing to transfer to other jobs.<br />
I wish to make it absolutely clear that my Government is<br />
not compensating the airlines for other losses or for<br />
revenues or profits lost as a result of the pilots'<br />
actions. The airlines losses are running at around<br />
per week before considering the wages of those normally<br />
stood down. They are bearing these costs themselves in<br />
the belief that they cannot afford the demands of the<br />
greedy AFAP.<br />
My Government regards these arrangements as essential to<br />
place the airlines on a similar footing to other<br />
affected industries such as the tourism industry which<br />
have the freedom to stand down staff not able to be<br />
gainfully employed.<br />
I recognise that such an arrangement is unprecedented,<br />
in the life of my* Government, but so are present<br />
circumstances. Here we have a small group challenging<br />
the very health of the Australian economy by insisting<br />
on using its monopoly power to negotiate outside the<br />
wage guidelines. This, plus the mass resignations that<br />
require the airlines to rebuild, calls for unique<br />
responses. More directly, the Government has made available RAAF<br />
aircraft. The RAAF has deservedly attracted widespread<br />
praise for the excellent service it has provided in<br />
extremely difficult circumstances. Since the RAAF<br />
started carrying domestic passengers on 25 August, it<br />
has carried a total of nearly 33,000 passengers. The<br />
RAAF has been operating up to 12 planes at a time,<br />
including Boeing 707, C130 Hercules and HS748 aircraft.<br />
1786 </p>
<p>The RAAF is providing services to cities and. towns in<br />
many parts of Australia including Hobart and Launceston,<br />
Perth, Darwin and Alice Springs, Cairns, Townsville,<br />
Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. It has also run special<br />
flights to pick up people stranded at places like<br />
Norfolk Island.<br />
In addition, the VIP fleet is undertaking the carriage<br />
of Australians from a wide variety of centres, and in<br />
particular has been used in special humanitarian cases.<br />
The Minister for Defence is examining ways of making<br />
more aircrews available to increase the level of<br />
utilisation of RAAF aircraft.<br />
The Government has lifted restrictions on the operations<br />
of foreign airlines and encouraged them to extend their<br />
services to domestic travellers. Interlining carrying<br />
international travellers on the domestic portion of<br />
their trip has also been opened to foreign airlines.<br />
Over the last few days9, my Government has introduced<br />
further measures in redoubled efforts to contain the<br />
damage caused by the pilots' actions. We have<br />
established a Ministerial committee to supervise the<br />
Government response and oversight longer term<br />
contingency planning. Mr Willis will chair the<br />
committee on which Mr Beazley and Mr Morris will serve.<br />
I will participate as necessary.<br />
A committee of officials chaired by the Secretary of my<br />
Department, and including the Secretaries of the<br />
Departments of the other Ministers on the committee and<br />
the Acting Chief Executive of the CAA, has been<br />
established to support the Ministerial Committee.<br />
Both these committees will be reporting directly to me.<br />
Under the umbrella of the officials' committee,<br />
arrangements have been set in place to fast track<br />
responses on problems relating to Government regulation<br />
or necessary support.<br />
My Government believes this commitment of our resources<br />
is fully justified by the serious, national implications<br />
of the present exceptional situation.<br />
The airlines have been providing the public with a<br />
skeleton service over the last few weeks, in particular<br />
utilising leased space on RAAF aircraft and<br />
international services.<br />
From this point on, there will be an increasing<br />
utilisation both of aircraft owned by the airlines 17 87 </p>
<p>6<br />
themselves and aircraft leased by the airlines from<br />
overseas, including crews.<br />
Australian has a 727 operating Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane<br />
today. Ansett has a 737 operating Melbourne-Sydney-<br />
Melbourne. With the addition of these aircraft to the<br />
airlines' services, 20% of normal Australia-wide demand<br />
some 5,500 seats were made available today.<br />
From next week, when the American West aircraft become<br />
fully operational that figure will rise to 25% of normal<br />
demand. Over the subsequent fortnight, additional aircraft<br />
including many leased from overseas will come into<br />
operation on domestic routes. These include six new<br />
leases arranged in the last 48 hours from the UK and<br />
Europe. As a result, by the end of the month capacity sufficient<br />
to meet 50% of normal demand will be available ( i. e.<br />
some 15,900 seats). The airlines are today releasing<br />
details in support of these estimates.<br />
This substantial growth in capacity will allow the<br />
airlines to boost training of new pilots, by allowing<br />
them to upgrade their qualifications to meet appropriate<br />
CAA standards.<br />
This in turn will allow aircraft in Australian's and<br />
Ansett's own fleets to return to service progressively.<br />
The airlines have also been offered a substantial number<br />
of full crews from overseas.<br />
In summary in this dispute the Government is determined<br />
to protect the national interest and the economic<br />
welfare of all Australians. We therefore have no choice<br />
but to resist the blackmail and the destructive tactics<br />
of the AFAP, however long it takes.<br />
We are determined that full domestic airline services<br />
will be restored as soon as possible and yesterday's<br />
Cabinet decision consolidated a process to ensure this.<br />
Australian pilots must now decide whether this will take<br />
place with or without them.<br />
The Government would clearly prefer them to rejoin the<br />
system and to negotiate new contracts with employers.<br />
That way, they can gain reasonable increases in pay<br />
based on improved productivity, and Australia can retain<br />
their skills and experience.<br />
But, if they continue to follow the greedy and<br />
178 8 </p>
<p>destructive line of the Federation, they should be under<br />
no illusion Australia's domestic airline industry will<br />
in any event be fully restored and there will be no<br />
place in it for them.<br />
I repeat the Government has the absolute resolve and<br />
capacity to protect Australia's national interests in<br />
this dispute. 1789, </p>
