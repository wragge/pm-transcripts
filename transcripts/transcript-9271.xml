TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP,<br />
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONFERENCE, ' AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY AND THE<br />
KEATING GOVERNMENT QUESTION ANSWER SESSION<br />
TUESDAY 5 JULY, 1994<br />
Q: I wondered what your major policy agenda is for the 12 months from now?<br />
Do you have one or two specific things that you want to achieve in the<br />
next twelve months?<br />
PM: Well, I want to drive the White Paper changes from, simply, a statement<br />
of policy changes to an outcome. That is, developing the training market,<br />
developing the job placement market, getting a much better focus. With<br />
information technology the way it is, the capacity to match demand and<br />
supply, we should be able to develop a much more sophisticated job<br />
placement business outside the CES which also should include, I think,<br />
case management. That is, we want to develop a market beyond the CES<br />
for case management. That is, we are to take people who are either long<br />
term unemployed that is, unemployed over 12 months or at risk of<br />
long term unemployment and manage them into the workforce. Including,<br />
of course, meeting the commitment we set in the White Paper of not<br />
letting any person under 18 slip through the system. That is, making a<br />
commitment to case manage every young person under 18, who might<br />
slip out of school, back into training, education and back into the<br />
workforce. Now, I made the point in the speech, I don't think we're going to see<br />
migration making the commitment to skills formation which we're going to<br />
need in this recovery and we can do it through training and I think that is<br />
going to be one of our major objectives actually driving this change<br />
along and making it work.<br />
The other... the Government has got a sort of holistic approach to these<br />
things. I made the point about foreign policy being a part of economic<br />
policy and now it is in a very big way. I can't emphasise too much how </p>
<p>well we did with the Uruguay Round. It went on for seven years, I was at<br />
the OECD meeting where we s! tood up the Europeans in pushing<br />
agriculture into the round and, with the support of the United States, got it<br />
into the Tokyo Summit with President Reagan and into the Uruguay<br />
agenda. And, as you know, with the Cairns Group, we drove a lot of the<br />
debate through the period. But, there was a great cockiness in Europe<br />
coming up to 1992 and the notion that they could go their own way<br />
without giving concessions to the rest of the world was pretty strong<br />
among them. But, they were and are very worried aboutAPEC<br />
needlessly so, in my view, but right through my visit to Western Europe on<br />
this occasion I had all the major European leaders asking for full observer<br />
status by the European Union in APEC. They are worried about APEC<br />
getting away as a fast growing area and I think, as I said, without APEC<br />
having developed the way it has with half the world's production and<br />
over half the world's population sitting down represented by heads of<br />
government it was the nudge the Europeans needed to sign up at<br />
Uruguay. For a country like Australia which is not part of the European<br />
markets, that's not, has a close market like North America, that's basically<br />
got to trade on its own fat, the Uruguay Round was a great change for us.<br />
In principle and in content. And, to go and extend that and do GATT plus<br />
things in the Asia-Pacific is, I think, the way to go. That is why APEC is<br />
important to us. We are now exploring this opportunity, as I say, with<br />
AFTA and Australasia. The GDP of Australasia is about $ 500 billion, the<br />
GDP of the ASEAN countries combined is about $ 500 billion; there's<br />
complementarity between us in not only relative size and weight but<br />
complementarities. And it would give Australia a place in a trading market<br />
of around 300 odd million people and a combined GDP of around $ 1000<br />
billion and growing quite rapidly. So, that's important for us as well.<br />
These are all, I think, things we have got to drive, and drive this industry<br />
innovation debate and the extension of that into these markets over the<br />
next couple of years. I think it is going to be terribly important to us. In<br />
the last year exports have grown by about 11 per cent and imports by<br />
nine per cent. This is quite encouraging in a recovery phase where we<br />
normally see a sharp lift in imports. So, we're heading down the right<br />
paths. I think the thing is to cdfitinue to push these changes through.<br />
The other change we want to see pushed through is the shift to entemnse<br />
bargaining of the great majority of areas under federal award coverage.<br />
And, as I say, we want to get to 80 per cent by 1996 and if we can do that<br />
we've really remodelled the Australian labour market away from the<br />
centralised system and made it more responsive. There's going to be a<br />
test in this recovery to see whether managers can spot the opportunities<br />
and draw from the workforce the productivity of related changes in<br />
business which can keep that inflation rate low, but lift profits of<br />
companies which can be divided between profits and wages. This has </p>
<p>never been the case in the past because, by and large, industry was<br />
always looking to centralised wage fixing. In fact, we are already hearing<br />
some firms saying, as there is a little bit of pressure coming from the<br />
recovery, " Can't we go back to centralised wage fixing?" Well, the<br />
answer is, " No, you can't go back to centralised wage fixing and we've got<br />
to do this one right." So, I think, that is another important part of the<br />
government's agenda and driving those things is going to take more than<br />
enough time.<br />
0: Prime Minister, you've just alluded to a very important point about the<br />
management challenge in all of this and the David Karpin Task Force<br />
report is due out very soon and in that, I think you will already know, that<br />
management doesn't get a very high score card there. I'm wondering<br />
whether you feel the challenge that management is up to this national<br />
picture challenge that you paint for us because, clearly, the rest of the<br />
workforce seems to be pushed very much towards the big challenge?<br />
PM: Well, I think the environment has changed, that is the main thing. The<br />
environment has changed and, as a consequence, there is always, in<br />
every company, the person who spots the new environment, who<br />
understands the new environment better and exploits it better. And the<br />
performances of one firm verses another in this environment means that,<br />
generally, boards of directors make decisions about management if they<br />
find they are losing a competitive position or their opportunities are not<br />
being fully maximised. So, I've always been a great believer in getting<br />
the tariff levels down, getting the free winds of competition in the<br />
economy, getting an emphasis on product innovation and all the bits and<br />
pieces which need to come with that to make investment fire. That is, a<br />
profit share that gets investment off and running, a tax system which is<br />
sensible and, of course, flexibility in the labour market.<br />
Now, I think, with those things we are seeing, really... I don't know what<br />
the consensus in business now is about the term of a chief executive<br />
officer but I would think that it is getting shorter and shorter. It was always<br />
about eight years and it is now coming down to about six and, more likely,<br />
five. After five years of a big effort by managers I think they are mostly<br />
moving on to do something else and there is another wave coming<br />
through. This is very healthy for the economy, I think, and very healthy<br />
for business. So, I'm very optimistic, really, about business management<br />
in Australia. I don't think we've been the best in the world, by a long<br />
margin, but I think that is changing and I think that turnover is going to<br />
sort of pick the people to suit the environment.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, your White Paper was very well received. This move to<br />
increase training, I think, everyone must have agreed with that. Now, </p>
<p>there were a few comments though, buried deep in the leader of the<br />
Financial Review was a comment that perhaps the training was being<br />
concentrated too much on the people who are least likely to show any sort<br />
of response. I was just wondering if you have any reply to that and that<br />
perhaps that you could do better next time around?<br />
PM: Well, I think that our view is that the Cinderella area of Australian<br />
education has been TAFE. And, trying to lift the status of vocational<br />
education has been one of the key objectives of the last few years. We<br />
started this with Qn-eNatio-n by putting $ 700 million over three years<br />
which we've now added to, it is now $ 1 billion for the growth in the<br />
TAFE system and we pulled the threads together into a national system.<br />
But, we wan-t to develop... I mean, there is always a division of, if you like,<br />
interest or loyalties, as the case may be, in these things. I think the<br />
government wanted to see a training market emerge and not a monolith<br />
with TAFE. But, because we haven't really seen the proliferation of<br />
private training providers TAFE was the basic building block of the<br />
system. So, what we have sought to do is get TAFE geared up to take<br />
the throughput of the higher participation rate in schools and to say to<br />
kids, " Look, 15-19 is a period of vocational preparation, you can go<br />
through high school and out into tertiary institutions." We take about<br />
per cent of the output, we are at the top of the OECD, or in that near top,<br />
where we are optimising the number of people exiting the secondary<br />
education system into tertiary. But, we are way, way below the optimum<br />
sorts of level of training through vocational education if, say, we compare<br />
ourselves with Western Europe or even North America, but particularly,<br />
with Western Europe.<br />
So, expanding TAFE and getting it right is, I think, an important way to<br />
make a difference to aggregate training training in the aggregate. But,<br />
that means, I think, that we want a private market to develop and we want<br />
business to be, basically, driving it. And, I think we'll see a very different<br />
complexion across TAFE. Where TAFE was once, the product of TAFE<br />
came from the training providers in the system we now Want the product<br />
designed by the users of the system, the people who have demand for the<br />
product and that is, essentially, business. So, I think, if we can get the<br />
result we need in TAFE we are going to see a big change in training<br />
capacities and a focus by business on human development within<br />
companies and on training in the broad, which we haven't seen in the<br />
past. Now, the labour market and the long term unemployed are different things<br />
again. Here, we've got people who have been unemployed for a year or<br />
18 months or even greater, longer, two or three years. And, our<br />
experience with them is that, properly streamed and invested that is, </p>
<p>people investing some time and effort in them they pay, generally,<br />
substantial rewards. And, it is not a case of investing in the least likely<br />
but, rather, knowing that we can't have, in this economy, a labour market<br />
of this size 300,000-400,000 people who are long term unemployed.<br />
That is too big a drag on our national efficiency, it is inequitable and it<br />
produces this, sort of, division in society which is unhealthy. So, getting<br />
the focus back there, taking a personal interest in these people, case<br />
managing them, getting to understand their personalities, their<br />
educational attainments, their work experience, their aptitudes.... focusing<br />
them into a business or training them, I think, gives them a chance to get<br />
back into society. Particularly when the economy is producing enough<br />
aggregate jobs to take up a substantial proportion of unemployed people,<br />
including that stream of the long term unemployed who would not<br />
otherwise be there. So, it is a balance and in the balance I think we are<br />
getting the balance right. At any rate, I think it is a mistake both in<br />
social and economic efficiency terms to regard the long term<br />
unemployed as a lost cause and to move on. Because, we will run into<br />
skills bottlenecks and shortages and that can give us problems about<br />
wages and wage push inflation at another stage in the cycle and now is<br />
the time to be thinking about that.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, infrastructure. In your last budget you adjusted the One<br />
Nation infrastructure bonds so that they are now tax attractive to<br />
investors, including institutional investors. What are your expectations for<br />
the role of private sector investment in infrastructure in your economic<br />
development agenda over the next five years?<br />
PM: Well, I think this is going to let me just go back a step and say public<br />
infrastructure has suffered in the time when we had fiscal consolidation in<br />
the 1 980s. When we had the government in a savings mode, the public<br />
sector in a savings mode developing those surpluses in the middle to late<br />
1980s. We cut back all of the public sector, including infrastructure. And<br />
there will be a need for some public infrastructure which we have<br />
recognised in later times, in One Nation, for instance, in the national rail<br />
highway where we are putting now a substantial investment in the<br />
national rail agreement, in the major highway systems, in the trunk roads<br />
around the capital cities, I mean, we are doing it, now, in some places.<br />
But, there will be places where public investment or community<br />
investment in facilities will be important. I mean, after Working Nation I<br />
went down to the Sunraysia district and there this is going to be the<br />
bulk wine growing capital of Australia. And, yet, the irrigation system was<br />
set up on gravity, all the contours of the system have, basically, been<br />
designed around the local topography. And, now, to expand the system it<br />
needs some community infrastructure in terms of drainage systems and<br />
water reticulation which, as a community, would provide an optimal kind of </p>
<p>6<br />
investment to go there. Now, it may be that a super fund which is a low<br />
tax paying body which has found infrastructure bonds unattractive in the<br />
past given we are now giving a 33 and 1/ 3 per cent rebate on<br />
infrastructure bonds may find them attractive to invest. But, again, it is<br />
going to be a ' suck it and see' situation, to see what the funds think of the<br />
particular projects, whether they think they are going to stand up<br />
economically or whether they're, simply, just after the tax concession.<br />
And, we'll have to muck around to get that balance right, see where it is.<br />
Some substantial state infrastructure, infrastructure in the states, will also<br />
qualify under the investment bonds, infrastructure bonds, but I don't want<br />
to see, if you like, a large proportion of state infrastructure responsibilities<br />
transferred to Commonwealth tax expenditure either. So, we're going to<br />
have to just see how it goes. For our part, we are willing to give it more<br />
than a reasonable fly to see if we can tap some of the savings of the<br />
superannuation industry and see them go into some of these sorts of<br />
areas. And, if they are well judged and well managed this could be a real<br />
addition to the national stock of infrastructure.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, I was pleased to hear you reject, in the early part of your<br />
speech, the thinking that we either have a strong resources sector or a<br />
competitive manufacturing industry...<br />
PM: Yes, that was a John Stone thesis so we don't hear much of it these days.<br />
Q: Given the rejection of that thinking, though, I'd be very interested to<br />
hear how you see the benefits of the resources sector in building the<br />
future economy of Australia. How do you see it contributing to a future<br />
competitive Australian economy?<br />
PM: Well, I think it is still of primary importance. And, if you look I mean,<br />
we are now focusing, often, on the success of the manufacturing sector<br />
from the inward looking structure we had a few years ago to what we have<br />
now. There's been a great transformation. This, in some way, is masking<br />
the success of the resources sector which has gone from strength to<br />
strength through the eighties. It has picked up, first of all, the primary<br />
benefits from the exchange rate, the new exchange rate system, but it has<br />
been well managed, it is more productive, its markets have diversified, the<br />
market penetration. The effort has been maintained and the contribution<br />
to national production and national exports has been growing very<br />
strongly. So, any notion that, you know, there's a new fascination with<br />
manufacturing and services at the exclusion of the primary export sector<br />
would be a very big mistake, in my view. And, I think, therefore, one has<br />
got to concentrate across the board and to see that all of our sectors get<br />
the advantage of enhanced competitiveness and where we can at least </p>
<p>7<br />
give the managers of these resource sector companies of ours the<br />
chance to pick up the things that are coming from national productivity<br />
and national competitiveness. Now, a lot will then depend upon their<br />
entrepreneurship, their marketing and everything else but, by and large, I<br />
think that we have been able to provide a much more competitive<br />
environment and they have done the things that they need to do to make<br />
their businesses more productive and more competitive. Anyway, the<br />
proof of the pudding is in the eating and the strong contribution from the<br />
resource sector is sitting there in the national accounts.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
Ends. </p>
