I PRIMI MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH CF-A14Z-EL 10 NZ'S 18 OCTOBER 197522<br />
Mr Whitlam it was reported yesterday that you asked all C-overnment<br />
Departments to submit reports to you on their financial positions.<br />
Have you received those reports?<br />
No, I'm expecting them for Monday when there's a Cabinet meeting.<br />
As you know it at the moment, what is the finarcial position of<br />
the Government?<br />
Well there is full ' upply voted last May up ' till about November.<br />
Then there are many things for which Supply has been voted on a<br />
continuous basis. The matters where the money will run out are<br />
payments for Public Servants, for the armed forces, for Medibank<br />
patients, for students, for services for people in aged persons'<br />
and handicapped persons' homes, that sort of thing.<br />
How long ' do-you think before those things are affected?<br />
It would vary from one Department to another. I wouldn't, I<br />
Q couldn't, give, effectively, an overall estimate.<br />
It's been suggested that it may be three or four weeks. Do you think<br />
that would be conservative?<br />
In some cases; in some cases, it might be less than that. In some a<br />
bit longer.<br />
What's the Government's next move in this situation? What do you plan<br />
to do next?<br />
O P. M.: The next move is up to the Opposition. The Opposition has voted to<br />
defer the Budget Bills, and of course they are avoiding the crucial<br />
issue: whether they will pass them or reject them. They have to make<br />
up their minds a Budget has never been deferred in the past; it<br />
certainly never has been rejected in the seventy-five years we've had<br />
an Australian Parliament. And they have broken all precedent and all<br />
principle even in deferring the Bills. The Bills will have to be passed.<br />
Q: What is the likelihood of a half Senate election now?<br />
Oh, there has to be an election for half the Senate before the end of<br />
next June. I haven't decided when I will recommend to the Governor-General<br />
if he asks the State Governors, whose job it is, to issue the writs for<br />
that election.<br />
If there wasn't a half election until the middle of next June and this<br />
deadlock remained, what sort of a situation would the Government be in?<br />
What sort of a situation would the coutry be in if the Budget was rejected?<br />
That's what you're asking. The Government will be there whether the<br />
Budget is passed or rejected, because the Government has a majority in the<br />
House of Representatives and it's in the House of Representatives that<br />
Governments are made and unmade and it's only in the House of Representatives<br />
that any Budget Bills or any money Bills at all can be introduced. / 2<br />
Q: w<br />
ea </p>
<p>Q: Mr Fraser suggested yesterday that unless that the. Government made<br />
a move shortly to end the deadlock that the Governor-General may,<br />
in fact issue writs for<br />
The Governor-General can only issue writs for a House of Representatives<br />
election on the advice of the Government. The Constitution says<br />
that the writs for.: a House of Representatives election are issued<br />
by the Governo. r-General -in-Council -' that-means, in effect, by the<br />
" Government. So then, ' the Government will certainly not advise the<br />
SGovernor-General to issue writs for a House of Representatives election<br />
just because the Senate wants them to be issued. So, the House of<br />
Representatives has a majority of members supporting the Government,<br />
and therefore the Government decides, the House of Representatives<br />
. decides,-the Senate doesn't and mustn't decide-whenthere will be. an<br />
election for the House of Representatives.<br />
Q: o-So irrespective-of how bad the situation gets, there are-no circumstances<br />
under which the : CGvernor-General could issue those writs<br />
That is absolutely right. The Queen, in England, or her Viceroy in<br />
Australia, the Governor-General, cannot issue writs for a House of<br />
Representatives election except when the Government advises him to do Q<br />
-so. . He has no -indeendent right nor of course. has the . Queen, any<br />
indepen" Sr. t * right, o ; say that th-re will be an election for the House<br />
of Representatives here, or the House of Comnons in Britain. It is<br />
". the Gover-nmruit that decides that question.<br />
Q: How ' do you view statements by the former Liberal Prime Minister, John<br />
' Gatton ,: that if the situation continues we could in fact -see riots in<br />
the streets?<br />
There are undoubtedly very strong feelings on this matter. I've never<br />
seen people so stirred up on an issue as they have been by this<br />
-usurcation by the Se. ntors. Look, I should say this: the motion that<br />
was passed by the Senate was an amendment to uhe motion to pass the<br />
. Budget; it was an amendment to defer the debate, and if the Labor<br />
Senator Milliner hadn't died a few months ago. and, if the Premier<br />
of-Queensland hadn't appointed a non-Labor replacement, then the votes<br />
-on that amenament would have been 50-50 there would have been as many<br />
voting against it as for it it wouldn't have been carried.<br />
As Senator Steele Hall said, this amendment was carried over a dead man's<br />
body.<br />
Q: Just on the subject of rioting in the streets, just how much worse<br />
do you think the situation...<br />
I don't want-to speculate on that -' I. believe that the Senate will<br />
. pass the Budget; that is what I expect.<br />
Q: -Well, . when do you think they'll do it Sir?<br />
It may be a week, it may be-a few weeks, but that is my expectation<br />
that the Senate will pass the Budget.<br />
Q: That surely.-would be ea, s l. ap in the face for. Mr Fraser?<br />
Well, he. has put himself in to this position. He was saying, only a<br />
very few months, and he said it in fact as recently as the time the </p>
<p>3.<br />
Bu * dget was introduced, that the Party which had a majority in the<br />
House of Representatives was entitled to govern for the three years<br />
for which it was elected. And he also said that he couldn't see<br />
circumstances why the Budget should not be passed. Now, nothing<br />
has changed. See) the Government has a majority in the House of<br />
Representatives; it will have a majority for the rest of the life~,<br />
the three-year lifeof this Parliament; it's entitled to govern.<br />
Sir, you're known-as a man who likes a bit of excitem-ent and a<br />
challenge. Is this an exciting and challenging time for you, or is<br />
it a worrying time<br />
P. M.:<br />
0<br />
11 P. M.: Well, it's a challenge, obviously. I pick up the challenge, I will<br />
not surrender this. It's a great principle that the House of<br />
Representatives decides who will be the Government. There are two<br />
Houses, you can't have the Senate deciding who will be the Government<br />
you can't have a Prime Minister in the Senate; you can't have a<br />
Treasurer in the Senate. It has to be, in each case, in the House of<br />
Representatives. Now, this is not something which my Government or<br />
the Labor Party acknowledges and propounds it's something which<br />
every Party, every Government, has propounded and acknowledged.<br />
If I were to accept the situation that the Senate can decide when there<br />
will be an election for the House of Representatives, even if it<br />
doesn't face the people itself, then I will have sold the past, it<br />
will be imnpossible to have stable government in Australia in the<br />
future. There are two times every year when money Bills have to<br />
be passed there is October for the Budget, there is April for the<br />
Supply to carry over from July to November following that, while the<br />
next Budget's being passed. Now if we accept that the Senate can,<br />
. on those two occasions every year, reject a money Bill, cut off<br />
the funds for the Govern~ ment, then we are conceding the principle<br />
that governments in Australia are elected, not for three years,<br />
but for six months, and that is impossible, in those circumstances,<br />
to have stable government.<br />
Can you see the political structure, Australia's political structure,<br />
ever fully recovering from this crisis, or do you think~ it's gone<br />
too far?<br />
If I don't win this issue, there will be permanent wounds in the<br />
Australian political structure. The conservative forces are those<br />
that always stress the proper course, the conventions, the<br />
right thing, and this year, in the course of a few months, the<br />
conservative forces have inflicted, or are threatening to inflict,<br />
very serious wounds on all the political proprieties in this country.<br />
First, two governments, State governments, appointed successors to<br />
Senators who didn' t belong to the Party to which the former Senator<br />
had belonged. Secondly, _ Mr Fraser has said that the Senate may<br />
reject the Budget it's never happened before. And thirdly,<br />
the Liberal Federal Council, last weekend, urged the State Premiers,<br />
the non-Labor Premiers, to advise the State Governors not to meet<br />
the Governor-General's request for the issue of writs for a half<br />
Senate election. Now these are three things which have never happenedthat<br />
is . the appointment of a person who doesn't support the Party. of<br />
a former senator had never happened in the quarter of a century<br />
that we've had proportional voting for the Senate; the rejection of<br />
Supp! yhas never happened in the seventy-five years we've had a<br />
federal Parliament; and for a State Governor to disregard the request<br />
by the. Governor-General for writs for the Senate had never happened on the<br />
previous 24 occasions when ther-e' vp hr </p>
<p>Was the recent visit to Australia by Tirath Kh,_ mlani an embarrasement<br />
to the Australian Governnent?<br />
Oh, yes it was, but. this is a pure side issue, because he didn't say<br />
anything that wasn't known three months ago. And the Opposition<br />
never did anything then. That is there is no impropriety, no illegality,<br />
which they can point to. They've never moved a motion about it yet.<br />
Q: Were-you disappointed in Mr Connor's performance in the....<br />
This is a completely side issue. We-were talking about the gross<br />
impropriety of rejecting the Budget. -That is completely ' irrelevant<br />
towhat you arenow asking.<br />
Thanks very much. 0<br />
that any Budget Bills or any money Bills at all can be introduced. / 2 </p>
