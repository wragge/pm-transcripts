STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
VISIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC<br />
OF CHINA<br />
As the guest of the Korean and Chinese Governments, I shall be visiting the Republic of<br />
Korea from 20 to 23 June and the People's Republic of China from 23 to 27 June.<br />
Both Korea and China are major economic partners of Australia and countries with which<br />
we enjoy close dialogues on regional and international matters.<br />
Following my visits last year to Indonesia, Japan and Singapore, my discussions with Korean<br />
and Chinese leaders will provide further valuable opportunities to exchange views on trade<br />
and political questions in the Asia-Pacific region which are of fundamental importance to<br />
Australia. In meetings with President Kim Young Sam and Prime Minister Hwang In Sung of Korea<br />
and President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng of China, I will want to discuss how we<br />
should best build on the very substantial economic relationships we already enjoy wvith each<br />
country so that the potential for expansion and diversification is fully exploited.<br />
Another important focus of discussion will be economic relations in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The Republic of Korea and China are both members of APEC. I look forward to<br />
exchanging views on APEC at this important time in the lead-up to the ministerial meeting in<br />
November in Seattle, as well as talking about other international trade issues. I also expect<br />
to discuss regional security issues in both countries.<br />
The Republic of Korea is now Australia's fourth-largest export market and China is<br />
Australia's ninth largest. Exports to both countries continue to grow strongly. Australia's<br />
exports to the Republic of Korea grew by 8 per cent last year, increasing the value of our<br />
exports to $ 3.6 billion. Exports to China grew by 23 per cent in the same period, taking the<br />
value of exports to China to $ 1.9 billion.<br />
In the Republic of Korea I shall be visiting Seoul, the industrial centre of Pohang and historic<br />
Kyongju. In China, I shall be visiting Beijing and Shanghai.<br />
