PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
THE FUTURE OF OUR FORESTS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />
NOVEMBER 1995<br />
Mr Speaker, I seek leave of the House to make a Statement on forest policy.<br />
Mr Speaker, today I announce the Government's broad policy direction on<br />
Australia's forests and forest industries. I am also announcing several<br />
related initiatives vital to the future of our native forests and the industries<br />
which depend upon them. Full details of these measures will be released<br />
tomorrow by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the Minister<br />
for the Environment, Sport and Territories, and the Minister for Resources.<br />
Mr Speaker, Australia's forests are a defining feature of our landscape, a<br />
priceless element of our environment and heritage, a national resource of<br />
immeasurable proportions and a profound national responsibility.<br />
All Australians have a stake in these forests. All of us have a responsibility to<br />
insist that they are properly managed and carefully conserved.<br />
They are a national treasure and their management must be ecologically<br />
sustainable and economically clever.<br />
Our native forests are of inestimable conservation value. They are vital<br />
repositories of biological diversity indeed, new species of plants and<br />
animals are still being discovered. They are a haven for endangered<br />
species. They are vitally important as water catchments, they influence our<br />
climate and act as carbon sinks to limit the greenhouse effect.<br />
Just as importantly they are places of unique and unrivalled beauty. They<br />
are aesthetically and spiritually important to us. They are important to our<br />
sense of belonging to this land. Our respect for and enjoyment of them is<br />
part of our communion with Australia.<br />
Mr Speaker, the national interest quite simply demands that we protect our<br />
forests. </p>
<p>This same national interest also demands that we use the forests intelligently<br />
for the things we need and for the communities that live with them.<br />
Our forests have economic significance. They are an important renewable<br />
resource, contributing to the wealth of the nation, and providing us with<br />
essential commodities.<br />
Many Australians, and many Australian communities, depend on our native<br />
forests for their livelihoods. Whatever we decide are our priorities, their<br />
interests must be attended to.<br />
This perception of an irresolvable conflict between the environmental and<br />
commercial values of forests has produced deep divisions in the Australian<br />
community. The debate presents itself as a conflict between absolutes: the<br />
absolute necessity to protect these priceless parts of our environment, and<br />
the absolute necessity to protect Australia's economic interests and the<br />
well-being of Australian working men and women.<br />
The conflict is easily understood. No Australians want to see these forests<br />
destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Nor do they wish to see the economic<br />
interests of Australia damaged or the livelihoods of their fellow Australians<br />
threatened. We on the Government side number ourselves among these Australians.<br />
No policy is going to satisfy everyone. Neither side of this debate can expect<br />
to get everything they want. The aim is to see that Australia is the winner,<br />
that the Australians of the next century are the winners. In the end, the<br />
essential goal is the protection of the long term national interest.<br />
Mr Speaker, it is towards this goal that the-Government has steered a course.<br />
Our cause will be greatly advanced if, on both sides, the debate is conducted<br />
with the national interest in mind. We should all remember that no-one in this<br />
conflict has a monopoly on truth or virtue, or a mortgage on concern for the<br />
future of our forests. Those who presume they do and claim it exclusively will<br />
only debilitate the efforts of people of good will to find the best solutions.<br />
We recognise that this is a debate which will of its nature arouse great<br />
passions. But, equally the solutions and the path to them cannot be other<br />
than rational.<br />
We will not find solutions without cool thinking and a genuine desire to find<br />
common ground and a degree of shared good will. </p>
<p>Mr Speaker, if the task of devising a national forest policy which meets<br />
community expectations is made difficult by polarised opinion and emotion, it<br />
is made even more complex by the fact that, under our Constitution, the<br />
States have the primary responsibility for land management, including the<br />
management of our forests.<br />
Many in the Australian community expect the Commonwealth to take more<br />
responsibility for Australia's forests than the Commonwealth has the ability to<br />
take. It is expected of the Federal Government that we develop an effective<br />
national policy, yet the Federal Government does not effectively have the<br />
power to do so. What powers we do have can never deliver the long term<br />
changes we are seeking to the reserves, to sustainable management and to<br />
the industry without the States.<br />
The recourse to the Commonwealth Government underlines the failure of<br />
interest groups to secure the appropriate undertakings from those who do<br />
manage forests in Australia and that, of course, is the State governments.<br />
In lieu of actual powers, the Government has taken the lead in developing<br />
with the States a cooperative approach to managing and protecting our<br />
forests. This policy has depended upon the States recognising that there is a<br />
national interest to be served, and success in the long run will in large part<br />
depend upon the States continuing to recognise this.<br />
Mr Speaker, we started on this difficult journey towards a common approach<br />
to forest management with the development of the 1992 National Forest<br />
Policy Statement, to which all State and Territory Governments are now<br />
signatories. This was itself no easy matter and some parties have only more recently<br />
joined. Embodied in that Statement are the shared economic, social and<br />
environmental objectives which all governments have made a commitment to<br />
achieving. Through the National Forest Policy Statement, the Commonwealth and the<br />
States agreed to the ecologically sustainable management of Australia's<br />
forests. Realising that we did not know enough about our forests, the<br />
Statement provided the basis for thorough, cooperative assessments of their<br />
values, leading ultimately to the concept of Regional Forest Agreements with<br />
the States. These Agreements offer the real possibility of a long term<br />
framework for the protection and management of these important national<br />
assets. As an idea it is probably unique in the developed world. </p>
<p>The Policy provides for the development of a National Forest Reserve<br />
System, which would ensure the protection of high conservation value areas<br />
required to maintain biodiversity, old growth and wilderness values.<br />
Earlier this year, the Commonwealth through a panel of scientists, developed<br />
a set of criteria for determining which areas should become a part of this<br />
system. They include;<br />
a broad benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-European distribution of<br />
each forest type to be protected within the reserve system.<br />
retention in reserves of at least 60 per cent of existing old growth,<br />
increasing up to 100 per cent wherever practicable for rare old growth<br />
and * protection of 90 per cent or more wherever practicable, or areas of high<br />
quality wilderness<br />
These criteria are recognised as at the leading edge in world terms.<br />
But, Mr Speaker, before we can arrive at a position from which we can<br />
negotiate Regional Forest Agreements and, through them, a comprehensive,<br />
adequate and representative National Forest Reserve System, we must put in<br />
place interim protection measures for forests which might be required as<br />
components of such a reserve system.<br />
The device we are using for this is a Deferred Forest Area or OFA process.<br />
The Deferred Forest Areas process has been designed to provide the<br />
appropriate degree of interim protection needed for the longer term RFAs. It<br />
is not meant to be the last word on which areas would be logged and which<br />
would be turned over to forest reserves. Rather, it was meant to provide an<br />
essential building block on the way to Regional Forest Agreements. The<br />
decisions to be announced tomorrow therefore, are but the first step in a<br />
longer, more rigorous process. But for the forests, a giant step.<br />
For most of this year, the Commonwealth has been negotiating with New<br />
South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and Western Australia to identify forest<br />
areas to be protected pending further assessment in the development of<br />
Regional Forest Agreements.<br />
In cooperation with these Governments, the Commonwealth has recently<br />
concluded a very extensive consultation process in which interested<br />
individuals and groups have had their say in an open and transparent<br />
process. Through their contribution they have been able to influence the<br />
outcome and, I am pleased to say, our Deferred Forest Areas are the better<br />
for it. At the same time, I believe, these consultations have underlined the<br />
fact that the policy approach we have chosen is undoubtedly the right one. </p>
<p>Through the Deferred Forest Areas process, we have delivered a positive<br />
and I stress immediate outcome for all Australians who have a stake in our<br />
forests which is to say, albeit to varying degrees, every Australian.<br />
As a first step, the decisions we have taken this week offer sound<br />
conservation outcomes as well as predictability for our forest industry.<br />
We have taken a precautionary approach, so as to ensure that future<br />
reservation options are kept open.<br />
Cabinet has agreed on the areas of state forest to be deferred. Detailed<br />
maps of these areas will be released tomorrow.<br />
Our objective has been to ensure that options for establishing the reserve<br />
system, based on criteria developed by the Commonwealth are not<br />
foreclosed while longer term assessments are conducted.<br />
Mr Speaker, I am confident that we have achieved this objective.<br />
In the next few weeks, the Commonwealth expects to sign Deferred Forest<br />
Agreements with the States I have mentioned. I will be writing to the<br />
Premiers later today inviting them to enter these Agreements.<br />
I have on a number of occasions talked about creating in Australia a forest<br />
reserve system the equal of any in the world. With the signing of these<br />
agreements, we will have taken a huge step towards this objective.<br />
Mr Speaker, the management of those parts of the forest estate outside the<br />
reserve system is just as important as the reserves themselves.<br />
The Government is committed to ensuring that the management of these<br />
areas, some of which will be available for harvesting, is truly sustainable.<br />
As part of the longer term process, we will be joining with the States in a<br />
thorough review of forest management and codes of practice.<br />
Our aim is to ensure that the full range of values we attach to our forests are<br />
maintained in perpetuity. We must adopt the view that these precious assets<br />
are held in trust for the future, they are not ours to neglect or degrade.<br />
The forests industry should be a model of ecologically sustainable<br />
development. Our objective is to ensure that it is.<br />
Mr Speaker, the annual turnover of Australia's wood and paper industry<br />
based on native forests and plantations, is in the order of $ 10 billion, or about<br />
one per cent of Gross Domestic Product. </p>
<p>The Government believes it is imperative to have a viable wood and wood<br />
products industry.<br />
Investments of between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion are at present under<br />
consideration. Industry and unions predict between 15,000 and 25,000<br />
potential new jobs over the next decade.<br />
The associated Wood and Paper Industry Strategy also to be released<br />
tomorrow sets out the Government's long term vision for this industry. It is<br />
the Government's aim to transform it to make it both internationally<br />
competitive and ecologically sustainable.<br />
As part of this transformation, we will encouraging increased investment in<br />
value-adding processes for wood and wood pulp, and give priority in issuing<br />
woodchip export licences to applicants who invest in domestic processing.<br />
We are determined to sharply improve domestic value-adding of residues<br />
currently being exported as unprocessed woodchips. We will, through this<br />
industry, expand job opportunities in regional Australia.<br />
We will clear the way for value-adding to forest residues by the release of<br />
strict environmental standards for Bleached Eucalypt Kraft pulpmills.<br />
And through Regional Forest Agreements to be developed with State<br />
Governments, we will provide industry with increased assurance about<br />
resource supply and greater regulatory certainty.<br />
We will continue to remove duplication in environmental impact assessment<br />
processes at the Federal and State levels and reduce administrative and<br />
compliance costs.<br />
Through Auslndustry, we will provide add-itional funding for enterprise<br />
development to firms in the wood and paper industries, and so promote best<br />
practice and competitive efficiency.<br />
We will provide additional assistance to small and medium firms in the wood<br />
and paper industry who are seeking to move into new markets or upgrade<br />
existing facilities.<br />
And through the Wood and Paper Industry Council, we will develop industry<br />
sector approaches to investment and improved import replacement and<br />
export performance.<br />
Underlying all of these initiatives is a fundamental commitment to sustainable<br />
job growth and opportunities for Australian workers.<br />
Mr Speaker, while the Government is committed to the long-term<br />
sustainability and prosperity of the native forest based industry, special<br />
recognition will also be given to the increasingly important role of plantations<br />
and farm forestry. </p>
<p>These sectors represent the best sources for future growth in the wood and<br />
paper industry. Plantations already supply a significant proportion of our total<br />
wood and paper products and major value-adding investment proposals are<br />
currently under consideration.<br />
In 1995, the industry set a target of trebling the current plantation resource by<br />
2020. The Government supports and welcomes this initiative. It will act to<br />
remove impediments to plantation establishment and establish a policy<br />
environment which will help industry to realise this target.<br />
Mr Speaker, every effort has been made to minimise necessary disruption to<br />
the timber industry arising from the Deferred Forest Areas process. State<br />
Governments have been asked to re-schedule logging operations away from<br />
deferred areas. However, the Government recognises that in some cases rescheduling<br />
may not be possible and that logging operations will be affected.<br />
Accordingly, the Wood and Paper Industries Strategy contains details of a<br />
generous Structural Adjustment Package which will provide financial and<br />
other assistance, including retraining, to proprietors and workers in the timber<br />
industry, those detrimentally affected by the Deferred Forest Areas process.<br />
Mr Speaker, we are especially conscious of the disruptive effect on some<br />
operators and communities of these changes. We will do all that we can<br />
reasonably do to help.<br />
Mr Speaker, let me turn to the vexed question of the woodchip export<br />
licences. Applications for woodchip exports for this year were about nine<br />
million tonnes. However, as indicated last year the Government wants to<br />
reduce the amount of wood exported in this unprocessed form. The<br />
Government has therefore decided on a much lower volume for this year<br />
which will be 5.25 million tonnes. This amount is a fair and consistent down<br />
payment on that objective.<br />
Licences will be issued for 80 per cent of that volume. The remaining 20 per<br />
cent will only be available in regions where there has been significant<br />
progress towards Regional Forest Agreements with State Governments.<br />
Details of this year's ceiling will be announced tomorrow by the Minister for<br />
Resources. The Government has made a commitment to phasing out woodchips exports<br />
by the year 2000 from areas not covered by Regional Forest Agreements.<br />
We remain committed to diverting these exports into further domestic valueadding.<br />
The industry is on notice that unless we get the progress and the<br />
agreements, woodchip exports will be phased out. </p>
<p>Those on the extremes of the debate in the timber industry and among their<br />
more uncompromising opponents should understand that the Government<br />
will not waver from this course or these decisions.<br />
Mr Speaker, no Australian government has ever made such a conscientious<br />
attempt to resolve this huge and vexed issue. Most governments would run a<br />
million miles from it. We have been at pains to strike the right balance; to<br />
find the means by which environmental and economic necessities can be<br />
reconciled in the national interest; the means by which a profitable industry<br />
and prosperous communities can be reconciled with our responsibility to<br />
preserve a unique and magnificent part of our natural heritage for our<br />
children and the Australians of the 21 century and beyond.<br />
Mr Speaker, it can be done. This statement demonstrates that driving an<br />
intelligent course can reap substantial and permanent benefits for both sides<br />
of the debate and for the nation more substantial and more permanent than<br />
any we might derive from pursuing one direction to the exclusion of the<br />
interests of the others.<br />
The moral comfort of extreme and certain positions may be warming to those<br />
who hold them, but they do not confront the real moral challenge, to deliver<br />
real, worthwhile, lasting and democratic solutions. Ones that everyone can<br />
respect. Mr Speaker, no-one should be under the illusion that with these decisions the<br />
difficulties and sensitivities surrounding the issue will disappear. Of course,<br />
they won't.<br />
But I hope the process will decidedly help to create a more cooperative and<br />
analytical environment. An environment in which the common goal of the<br />
protection and renewal of our forests can be achieved with a forest products<br />
industry that has a future based on sustainability and ecological decency.<br />
Mr Speaker, this statement will bring us much much closer to ecologically<br />
sustainable management of our great forests. And, with it, much closer to<br />
meeting our responsibilities to the Australians of the next century and<br />
thereafter. </p>
