P'RIME MINISTER<br />
PAUL KEATING WITH KEL RICHAIW3, 29B, JULY 3, 1992<br />
3 OR PROOF ONLY<br />
RICHARD$.' KEATINGi RICHARDSI KEATINGs RICHARDS; KEATINGi Yes, indeed, according to the Opposition Leader,<br />
John Hewson, Prime Minister Paul Keating is going<br />
through Oa three-month remedial coaching to<br />
overcome a lifetime of male chauvinism". It was<br />
quite a blast. " Afterf aiIreaiid Hewson, * the<br />
Prime Minister is a man who, in his maiden speech<br />
in Parliament, demanded that the Government do<br />
oomething to put the working wife back in her<br />
home." well, is the man who-ledi the nation a<br />
male chauvinist, or is he not? He joins us now..<br />
Paul Keating, good morning.<br />
Hello, Kel, how are you?<br />
I'm fine. Male chauvinist guilty as charged?<br />
No, not guilty. I mean, Dr Hewson's got to go<br />
back to 1969 to find a quotation. You understand,<br />
Kel, thm Liberal Party have comibed everything I've<br />
ever said. You've got to go back to 1969 to find<br />
a quotation from me about the right of a woman to<br />
stay at home, ignoring all of the great changes of<br />
the 1980. and then.. he's on the record.. but I've<br />
only got to go back two years to find him saying<br />
about these things for the ideal woman. He said.<br />
" I look for three things in--an iaeal woman, good<br />
teeth, good health and good cookery."<br />
In other words, you're saying the boot is entirely<br />
on the other foot?<br />
I mean, he is the chauvinist. I've never spoken<br />
of women In this country an Dr Hewson has as<br />
though they were sort of, horses. yoU have a look<br />
at their teeth and the sort of health they're in<br />
and give them a poke and a prod., you know, to<br />
feel how their general condition is. I mean, this<br />
is the sort of stuff he deals in. And then, in<br />
references to me, he said what X need is " a very<br />
I </p>
<p>RICHARDSt KEATING: attractive, blonds, leggy nurse that is thawing<br />
him out.' I mean, it's all sexist. Or his quote<br />
that our airline policy is run " an the number of<br />
sandwiches,, or how attractive the hosties<br />
are". I mean, this guy is your classic chauvinist,<br />
And here he is up at the Liberal Party's<br />
convention trying to tell them about how he is<br />
going to add to childcare places, not telling them<br />
that he's going to put a 15% GST on childcar,<br />
services and that there willbe no additionaI7<br />
money for childcare. And the rest of his<br />
policies.. adopting the policies of the Labor<br />
Government which he is quite happy to continue, he<br />
says# On the subject of women and politics though, the<br />
longest-serving prime minister in Australia, Sir<br />
Robert Menies, once said he just didn't<br />
understand women Would you claim to understand<br />
women? Nell, what I've tried to do is to even up the<br />
social field in Australia. When I was Treasurer,<br />
and let me just run through a couple of things<br />
which I was personally involved and responsible<br />
for as -Treasurer, one was, first of all, the<br />
supplementary payments for low-paid wom~ en which we<br />
do in the work~ force for th eo ~ ple process<br />
workere and women working in sort of process 3obs<br />
in retailing where a great number of women are<br />
employed, we arranged through the Accords Mk V and<br />
IV for supplementary payments, In superannuation,<br />
women in Australia can't preserve benefits.. they<br />
come into the workforce for a number of years, go<br />
out to have children and then lose all<br />
preservation. Benefits are now preserved and a<br />
woman can come in and out of the workforce and, at<br />
retiring age, have this occupational superannuation<br />
pension or lump -he child I@ Uy-pport<br />
agency I established in the Tax office with the<br />
Tax office chasing maintenance dodger$ who l6ft<br />
women behind and were never prepared-often to<br />
support them. We now chase them and support their<br />
wives and families with funds. The fily<br />
allowance supplement % or low-income families which<br />
most, of course, helps women.. what's Dr Howson<br />
going to do for women? Putting 15% on everything<br />
they buy and then they've got to try and get the<br />
transfer within the home household income from the<br />
husband or the breadwinner to pay f or the 15% on<br />
food, clothing and all of the essentials of lifethat's<br />
what he's doing. </p>
<p>RICHARDS1 KEATINGI RICHARDSS KEATING: RICOWDS8 KEATING; Hm.. mind you, he did tell the conference last<br />
night that he now understands women beeause he had<br />
this, he said and I'm quoting from hime " a<br />
blinding flash whilst he was ironing his shirt".<br />
He said " he now understands that women have the<br />
same hopes, aspirations and values as us", he<br />
says.<br />
Well, in 1990, in the Australen Women's Weekly,<br />
he was saying he looked for good teeth, good<br />
health and good cookery.' In October, 1990, at the<br />
Adelaide Chamber of Commerce he's referring to<br />
leggy nurses and st the Liberal Party Convention<br />
on ABC Radio in August, 1990, he saids " We really<br />
have to deal..", this is the Liberal Party, " have<br />
to deal with women's issues in a more deliberate<br />
way in the Liberal Party, I tend to think there is<br />
a lot of rhetoric and not a lot of detail in some<br />
of that policy." The fact is, the Liberal Party<br />
has never cared less in terms of the great<br />
advances for Australian women, which this<br />
Government has concentrated on in the 1980sstarting<br />
with childcare, taking it from 50,000<br />
places to 250,000 places by the middle ' 909. An I<br />
say, the Child Support Agency, occupational.. all<br />
those things.<br />
Maybe it's not a matter of policy, maybe he wants<br />
us to be impressed by the fact and just noticed<br />
the fact that he was, indeed, ironing his own<br />
shirt.<br />
Well, I don't think that is a qualification for<br />
having what I think is a progressive view, an<br />
enlightened view towards the role of women in<br />
society in general. And making opportunities,<br />
that is, expressly, the Government expressly,<br />
doing what it can to make natural opportunities<br />
for women to find their way in society and in<br />
work. While we're talking, can I ask you about the e<br />
incident last night in Newcastle. I meanTis<br />
tat-. o you read thit-1iicfefnf, an egg being<br />
thrown at you, as being any sort of reflection of<br />
the way the public feel about you, or think about<br />
you? Oh, no. Look, I had my reception in Newcastle<br />
last night was the best I've ever had as Prime<br />
Minister. At two clubs, the Phoenix Club and the<br />
Newcastle Workers' Club, I had the warmest </p>
<p>RICHARDS: KEATINGt RICHARDS: KEATING., RICHARDS: KEATING: reception I've ever had. I would have signed last<br />
night, on the back of the invitation cards, maybe<br />
300 of them. People coming up to me, writing for<br />
thei~ r families, their children, thamselves.., you<br />
know, ' beat wishes, warm regards', all the other<br />
things that one does. I mean, I was inundated<br />
with good wishes. And there was, sort of, one<br />
nark, you know., the way one regards it. I mean,<br />
I've never had.. I said last night that the spirit<br />
in Newcastle.. the attitude of those people, the<br />
senae of -cohesion in adversity, arnd the general<br />
bonhommie and optimism of the place, and the goodnaturedness<br />
of it, was profound. And I've had..<br />
in no place I've visited in the six months I've<br />
been Prime Minister have I ever had a warmer<br />
reception. 11mm.. Just a ' one off' bloke just being odd..<br />
yeah, Yeah, that's all..<br />
The other question that has to be asked..<br />
and he missed, anyway.<br />
. which is the important thing, I suppose,<br />
particularly when you're wearing an expensive<br />
suit, The other question that has to be asked is,<br />
Nick Greiner ha. gone in New South Wales. Now,<br />
can on ransi lift the.. the general support for<br />
the Liberal Party in NSW and make it harder to win<br />
seats or you here in the next Federal Election,<br />
Well, look.. I don't know. it's very hard to make<br />
political Judgments. What I try and do is work<br />
with each Premier and try and got the beet result<br />
for each State. That's.. I mean, I think, when<br />
one get's so tricky that one's regarding the<br />
progress of another party in office as a detriment<br />
to oneselfI in the end, the national good gets<br />
overlooked. And I tried, with Rick Greiner#<br />
always to try and find a constructive basis Of<br />
getting along and doing things. And, in the ' One<br />
Nation' package for instance, I mean, he asked me<br />
things, ho asked me to extend offshore banking<br />
units to austra. ial particularly Now South Wales,<br />
by changing the tax system we did that. He<br />
asked me to sort out the f unding on the Glebe<br />
Island Bridge to provide funds there I did that.<br />
in other words, we run a co-operative, I think,<br />
relationship anid I'd hope that the same co-</p>
<p>RICHARDSI KEATING: RICHARDSt KEATINGi RICHARDSo KEATINGo RICHARDS: operative relationship could exist between the<br />
Gove... nment of John Fahey and this Government, my<br />
Government, and that we can do some things for New<br />
South Wales as we've done for other States.<br />
well, yes, he's got that of working class sort of<br />
feelinq to him, John Fahey. I mean, there is the<br />
possibility he could erode some of your support,<br />
isn't there?<br />
Well, I wouldn't regard a lift in the fortunes of<br />
the people of New South Wales as any other than<br />
a'nr ouunnda, m baisg uIo utshliyn kg oDord Htehwisnogn. doAensd, ih odpoinn'gt thgeo<br />
place will be sort of in trouble so that one.. you<br />
know, gloomy environment sort of advantages one's<br />
political cause. I mean, we're all in politics<br />
and we're in politics to win. But, by the same<br />
token, one has got to move the commonweal on. You<br />
know, you've got to got progress and you've got to<br />
get development.<br />
Yeah, because there are people who need that<br />
support$ Go there are people who need it. And I mean,<br />
that's what I was so absolutely encouraged by in<br />
Newcastle yesterday. I mean# the sense of<br />
sticking together up there, the fact that the<br />
place is I mean, everybody on the tablewhether<br />
they be from the various authorities, the<br />
Education Department, or whether it be the Police<br />
Department or wherever it might be, they all sing<br />
the same song: " We want to advance Newcastle, we<br />
want to get more growth in here, we want to do<br />
more clever things on the technological side, we<br />
are interested in productivity, you know, we want<br />
to train our kids properly". I mean, it's a<br />
comunity view.<br />
And, in the end, that's the Australian spirit, in<br />
the end that's what will make us, as a nation,<br />
win, That's right. I think., but, I think Inarkism',<br />
you know, from ' narks'.. the nark's view of the<br />
world, we're all ' rooned', you know, we are all<br />
ruined. Yeah, " we'll all be rooned, said Hanrahan, before<br />
the year is out". </p>
<p>KEATING RI CKARDS; I<br />
KEATING: RICHUADS:<br />
KEATING; RICKARDS; K( EATING1<br />
RICKIARDS: That's right. Wells that sort of view which gets<br />
around the recear ion just does nobody any good.<br />
And the fact is, we won't be ruined and we wlill<br />
see a recovery come through this year and the<br />
economy in the 1990s will be able to hold its head<br />
up in the world as it never was for the last 20 or<br />
years.<br />
Quick final question, Paul, whAt's your tip for<br />
the outcome at Lang Park tonight?<br />
Well, r I'm not a great tipster on.. on the<br />
footy. I mostly end up.. mostly and up making a<br />
mesa of it..<br />
Confident tip..<br />
But I just.. you've always got to barrack for the<br />
home side.<br />
We'll win?<br />
Well, I hope we will.<br />
Okay, Paul, thanks for your time.<br />
ends </p>
