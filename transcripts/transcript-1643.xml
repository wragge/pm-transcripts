OSAKA EXPOSITION 1970<br />
Text of Statement made to Parliament by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Harold Holt on 23rd August, 1967<br />
In response to an invitation from the Government<br />
of Japan, Australia has indicated . ts decision in principle to participate<br />
in a world exposition with the theme " Progress and Harmony for<br />
Mankind", to be held at Osaka from March to September, 197C.<br />
This will be the first exposition of this kind to be<br />
held in Asia, and the Government's decision has regard to Australia's<br />
increasingly close relationships with ksia and with Japan in particular.<br />
The exposition is to be similar in character and concept to EXF-O 67<br />
at Montreal, at which Australia has a highly successful presentation.<br />
It offers the opportunity for us further to portray to our friends . n Asia<br />
and indeed to the world at large Australia's way of life, our achievements<br />
and aspirations. The Government has not yet reached any decision on<br />
the nature or scale of Australian participation at Osaka. These aspects<br />
will be studied in tile light of the experience of our participation in EXPO 67 </p>
