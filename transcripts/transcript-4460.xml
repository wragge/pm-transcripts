PRME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 3 AUGUST 1977<br />
THE NORTHERN TERRITORY ELECTIONS<br />
On Saturday 13 August, the people of the Northern Territory face<br />
a crucial decision. You will voting in elections for the<br />
Legislative Assembly an Assembly that will take your Territory<br />
to self-government.<br />
The next stage of self-government will be implemented in July<br />
1973, and a further stage in July the following year. The<br />
Members for whom you vote will have the responsibility of<br />
forming a Government, providing Ministers and undertaking the<br />
responsibility of administering the Northern Territory.<br />
Elsewhere in our nation, Australians control their own affairs,<br />
such as water and sewerage boards, electricity authorities,<br />
bus services, forestry operations, the regulation of commerce<br />
and industry, fisheries, parks and the planning of towns.<br />
The leader of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern<br />
Territory, Dr. Goff Letts, believes, as I do, that the people<br />
of the Territory are as capable as any other Australians. He<br />
believes, as I believe, that the Northern Territory should have<br />
a greater say in the conduct of its own affairs. That is why<br />
he and other Members of the Country Liberal Party in the<br />
Assembly have worked for constitutional reform.<br />
I am advised that the Labor Party is fearful of self-government,<br />
and is engaged in a campaign of misrepresentation and distortion.<br />
I would expect no more from a party which, in the Federal sphere,<br />
has shown itself incapable of responsible government and<br />
incapable of proper conduct in office.<br />
The Federal Government has gone a long way to repair the<br />
damage done by the mad extravagance of the Labor administration.<br />
In eighteen months we have brought down the level of inflation<br />
from around 16% to around 10%. We have exposed the hand-out<br />
mentality of the ALP, which had Australians staggering towards<br />
bankruptcy. / We have </p>
<p>2<br />
We have halted the tax rip-off by indexing income taxes;<br />
reigned in the extravagance which is the hallmark of the<br />
ALP; introduced responsible new social welfare measures<br />
such as the system of family allowances, and placed health<br />
insurance on a basis on which it can operate successfully.<br />
The Commonwealth recognises that the Northern Territory has<br />
special financial disabilities. Accordingly, the financial<br />
arrangements which will be worked out between the Commonwealth<br />
and the Territory will have due regard to these special circumstances.<br />
There will be periodic assessments of the fiscal<br />
disability of the Northern Territory as compared with the<br />
States. The charges and tariffs made for local services will be<br />
set by the Territory's own representatives. There is no<br />
reason to believe that they will be higher than such charges<br />
elsewhere in Australia.<br />
I am confident the people of the Territory will not be<br />
deceived by twisted talk about double taxation and crippling<br />
charges. I have faith in the people of the North as common<br />
sense Australians, and I have faith in Goff Letts and his<br />
team who have worked so hard in the interests of the<br />
Territory. I am sure this confidence will be vindicated at your<br />
elections. r-~-LOIIII1CI-C 1 </p>
