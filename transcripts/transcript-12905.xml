<p>Thank you very much Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen. </p>
<p>This has been a very special moment in my political life. I have been a member of the Australian Parliament for 28 years. I';ve been Prime Minister for six and a half years almost. And I was the Leader of the Opposition - that';s a terrible job in politics, it';s tough in our parliamentary system, you always try to get out of it -  and I';ve held a lot of ministries. I can';t quite compare any of those experiences in a particular sense with today. </p>
<p>To have the privilege of addressing the most influential group of legislators anywhere in the world, is a rare honour. It is an honour I know that personally came my way but I appreciate that it has been extended to my country. And I want to say to my American friends here, and Tom thank you very much for your very warm personal remarksâ¦ can I say just how very much we appreciate it and how we care about this relationship. I think it was Dr Johnson who said that we should keep our friendships in good repair and part of the visit of an Australian Prime Minister to Washington is in that vein of making sure that a close relationship is never taken for granted, of keeping that relationship in good repair. </p>
<p>I';ve had wonderful access here in Washington. I have had this enormous privilege today. I';ll be seeing the President tomorrow at the White House before leaving to return to Australia. And I have seen many senior people in Congress. And I want to say how much I am touched by the bipartisan character of the welcome. We have our political differences and we have our partisan battles, both in Australia and America, but there are certain things that transcend those differences and I can say that the affection for the United States is a bipartisan affection in Australia. And I know that I would be speaking on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in saying today to all of you that they share our commitment to the American alliance and I know that they would want me to say on their behalf that the friendship that is felt between our two countries is felt across the political divide in Australia, as I know it is felt across the political divide here in the United States.</p>
<p>America has given extraordinary leadership to the free world for long years now and no more so than over the past few months. And the way in which your country responded, I don';t think I have seen anything more emotional in a public life sense, than the appearance of all of you on the steps of the wonderful Capitol building the day after the attack and singing God bless America. It was a very touching demonstration in political solidarity that sent a message around the world. And it sent a message to those people who would do damage to your country and to the fabric of our two societies. </p>
<p>So thank you very much for having Janette and myself here today. On behalf of all of the Australians present, we thank you most warmly for the hospitality that you have extended. I hope all of you in Congress who haven';t yet visited Australia do something about that as soon as possible. You will be very welcome. We will show you around the odd urban area and we might also show you a few farms as well. But you are welcome whenever you want to come because it is the most natural friendship in the world between our two peoples. So thank you very very much Mr Chairman for your gracious hospitality.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
