I PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
A~ DDRESS AT MORGAN GUARANTY D2NtNER,,. EbUOMMNE<br />
I heard an overseas visitor the other day describe Australia as<br />
a land of opportunities a country which North Americans arnd<br />
Europeans regard as one of the few still having the potential to<br />
offer the excitement and adventure that goes with new development,<br />
and the potential to challenge and to extend the horizons of its<br />
people. I f ound it encouraging that overseas visitors should once<br />
again be talking like that. it is a sign that times are changing.<br />
Five or six years ago, most Australians, as well as our overseas<br />
friends, were thinking along similar lines., Since then, we have<br />
been through a period of doubt and u rcertainty a period during<br />
which we tended to blame others for our misfortunes, and during<br />
which we became unsure of our capacity to solve our problems.<br />
In a word, ' we lacked leadership.<br />
I believe that we have passed through that period and ' that a new<br />
prospect is now emerging -a prospect that Australia will niot only<br />
provide much greater opportunities for advancement of its own<br />
people, and those who may come and join us here, but also a<br />
prospect that Australia will provide an example which others<br />
will look to when setting their own economic policies in the<br />
years ahead.<br />
That is a large claim. Let roe elaborate upon it. In doing so<br />
I want to refer to some basic simplicities about the Australian<br />
economy -and other such economies that. I fear were lost sight<br />
of during the leaderless period which I referred to, but which<br />
cannot be tnored if we are able to have regard to our underlying<br />
health and the future of our country.<br />
I want also to comment on economic developments in Australia in<br />
relation to those overseas, and to put them into some perspective.<br />
You will not be surprised if in present circumstances I start by<br />
referring to the years before the present Government came to office.<br />
I do so because an understanding of the record of those years is<br />
fundamental to an understanding of the present state of Australia<br />
today, and because, as someone said, if we are not prepared to<br />
learn from history, we shall be doomed to repeat it. That is a<br />
thought, indeed, which I believe all Australians should have in<br />
their minds in just over three week's time. / You will </p>
<p>You will all be aware of the explosion, during the 1973-75<br />
period, in both unemployment and inflation rates in Australia.<br />
It is a matter of clear public record that in the second half<br />
of 1974 inflation soared at an annual rate of 19 per cent, and<br />
at the end of 1975, unemployment was 5.4 per cent. These<br />
frightening developments and I use that word quite literallywere<br />
accompanied by, and a product of, a sharp fall in business<br />
profitability anid ant equally sharp rise in personal savings.<br />
By the end of 1975 the share of company profits had fallen to<br />
12.7 per cent compared to the long-term average of 17.5 per cent.<br />
While on the same basis, the proportion of incomes that people<br />
saved jumped from 9.8 per cent to 16.2 per cent.<br />
The business community found itself on the anvil of a basically<br />
anti-business Government, while the hamer of the 1974-75 wage<br />
explosion itself promoted by that Government descended upon<br />
it. The results were entirely predictable. -We saw the developmnent<br />
within our business community of a " survival mentality"-<br />
an atmosphere in which only fools took risks because the future<br />
had become largely unpredictable; and because risk-taking, the<br />
fundamental process which underlies all private enterprise<br />
economies and hence all free societies was nolonger, so it<br />
seemed,-to be rewarded appropriately in profit terms. I<br />
With labour costs exploding and profits plummeting, businesses<br />
went into their shells. As part of the cast-cutting processes<br />
of doing so, they found it necessary to lay off, or cease to talke<br />
on, labour. The resulting sharp jump in unemployment itself added<br />
to the uncertainties from which ordinary consumers-: were also<br />
suffering,. an&amp;_ whichJn. turn were leading them to " button up" t<br />
to slow down their spending anid increase their saving.<br />
What these events signified was that businessmen and consumers<br />
alike had lost the confidence to spend. They were too uncertain<br />
to commit themselves beyond the immediate future and for<br />
essentials. But over and beyond these developments, there<br />
loomed another thxeat to the future of Australia, or at least<br />
the kind of Australia that -rost Australians had come to hold<br />
dear. I refer to the threat of " Big Government" itself.<br />
It is now a matter of history that the Government of the day<br />
reacted to the onset of the problems I have mentioned by trying<br />
to pump up the economy. In a series of wild decisions they<br />
raised the 1974/ 75 Budget deficit to no less than 4and a<br />
half per cent of GD?, in the process increasing commonwealth[<br />
outlays in one go, from 24 per cent of GDP to nearly 30 per cent.<br />
The .1975/ 76 Budget deficit was originally set even larger in<br />
relationi to the economy ( 5 per cent of GDP), and would undoubtedly<br />
have turned out even larger still if, half way through that year,<br />
a new Government had not set about reining it in.<br />
But, you may say, pump-priming however ill-judged is one<br />
thing: " Big Government" as a philosophy is another. What became<br />
clear at that time to all with eyes to see whether Australians,<br />
or our friends abroad was that here in Australia we had a<br />
particularly virulent case of both. / Through<br />
I V </p>
<p>3<br />
Through one scheme af ter another, the Government of the day<br />
sought to intervene more and more in the everyday lives of the<br />
people. The spending programmnes involved were too numerous to<br />
count. Both the overt and the convert thrusts from the centre<br />
to undermine the independent powers and role of our state<br />
governments were clear for all to see. In one way anid another<br />
it as sought to make as many of our citizens as possible<br />
dependent upon . the Federal , Government for their nouri shment<br />
anid even survival. This was the nation of pensioners which<br />
" Big Government" in Australia set about creating.<br />
As to our economic troubles, there is of course a view that<br />
none of our troubles at that time was home-produced, but rather,<br />
some hind of malady imported from abroad; anid there is of course<br />
the -associated view that many overseas countries, faced with<br />
economic problems not wholly dissimilar, also took the pumppriming<br />
route in trying to solve them.<br />
The first of these views is generally a self-serving one. I<br />
do not -7propose to waste your time by rebutting its obvious<br />
untruth. But as to the second view, I do have to say in all<br />
fairness that Australia under its previous Government was not<br />
the only country that tried to solve its economic problems at<br />
that time by restoring to the traditional post-war " Keynesian"<br />
pump. There were, however, a few countries that clearly or<br />
otherwise perceived that pump-prining " remedies" of that kind<br />
were outdated and inappropriate in a situation of high inflation<br />
and depressed profits.<br />
They say that pumping out more money into the economy through<br />
swollen budget deficits, with the associated risk of exacerbating<br />
inflation, made no sense wheni the cazwnunity's fears and reluctance<br />
to spend were evidently closely related to the uncertainties<br />
created by inflation itself. They saw that the problem was not<br />
in fact any shortage of purchasing power, but rather an<br />
unwillingness to employ that power until greater confidence<br />
in the future value of their currencies could be restored,<br />
and above all, an increasing distrust of Governments and the<br />
destabilising consequences of their interventionist proclivities.<br />
These countries, therefore, garve priority, first and foremost,<br />
to bringing down inflation, primarily by reducing their budget<br />
deficits and the growth in their money supplies.<br />
I am referring of course to countries such as the United States,<br />
Germany and Japan, all of whom took strong action along these<br />
lines during 1973 or 1974. This action was successful in<br />
sharply braking and then reducing inflation in those countries.<br />
But initially, it also caused a reduction in their economic<br />
growth rates and an increase in their unemployment. in each<br />
of the years 1974 and 1975, for instance, the United States<br />
recorded falls in GDP and increased levels of unemployment.<br />
in both those years unemployment also rose in Germany-while<br />
GDP was either flat ( in 1974) or falling ( in 1975).<br />
However by the end of 1975', the three largest industrialised<br />
countries were seeinig a sharp decline in inflation, anid economic<br />
activity was steadily recovering. ' while there have since been.<br />
some iuriods of hesitancy, that recovery in economic activity<br />
has continued since that time in all those countries. / The </p>
<p>4<br />
The comparative success of the policies pxirsued by the three<br />
strong countries ( in particular) did not go unmarked internationally.<br />
In some quarters such as the OECD it led to<br />
a significant rethinking of economic policy strategy.<br />
For example, the so-called medium-term strategy which was<br />
adopted at the June 1976 meeting of the OECD Ministerial<br />
Council recognised that " The restoration of full employment<br />
and normal levels of capacity utilisation in the OECD area<br />
will be progressive and take a number of years." Most importantly<br />
it recognised that The steady growth -needed to restore full<br />
employment and satisfy rising economic and social aspirations<br />
will not pcove sustainable unless all mnember -counntries make<br />
further progress towards eradicating inflation." In short,<br />
it recognised that in the process of restoring economies<br />
shattered by inflation. and its associated uncertainties# there<br />
could be no short cuts no easy options.<br />
Six months before this strategy was in place internationally, iny<br />
own Government had already started to implement its essential<br />
elements here in Australia. On taking office, we -moved<br />
immediately to cut back the growth in Government spending; to<br />
bring the budget deficit and the noney supply under control; and<br />
to reduce the Federal bureaucracy.<br />
You might be interested to know that if we had allowed<br />
Commonwealth staff to grow at the same average annual rate of* the'<br />
1972/ 75 period, about $ 770 ioillion would have been added to the<br />
Cormmonwealth salary bill* We did not seek to reduce Government<br />
spending in any unduly drastic way because we recognised that<br />
the economy. had-already--experienced severe shocks and structural<br />
changes. W everthelessf within the past two years we have contained the<br />
rate of growth of Federal outlays in our first budget to less<br />
than half that of the previous year; provided for no real growth<br />
in our budget outlay in the current fiscal year; reduced the<br />
budget deficit this year to around two and a half per cent of<br />
GDiP compared with five per cent or more when we took office;<br />
even though we have, at the same time, reduced the burden of<br />
taxation at a cost to revenue of no less than tiree and a<br />
quarter billion dollars, halved the underlying growth o * f the<br />
money supply, to less than ten per cent, and restored Australia' s<br />
external competitiveness by a devaluation which we did not want<br />
and which we resisted for almost a year while giving our policies<br />
time to work, but which in the end, because of the deterioration<br />
in competitiveness which occurred under the previous Government,,<br />
was forced upon us. The Government was confident that this<br />
devaluation would result in only a -minor check to the downward<br />
movement in inflation,-owin Ãµ to the continuing firmness of its<br />
other policies. I am pleased to say that the Government was right.<br />
There can be nio doubt that these policies have resulted in a<br />
transformation in the underlying health of the Australian<br />
economy. / There are<br />

Inflation, as -measured by the broadly based indicators in<br />
1976/ 77, was around 5 per cent less than in the previous<br />
year, and# so far. in 1977t consumer prices have risen at<br />
An annual rate of around 9 per cent, about the same as the<br />
average for our~ trading partners, ComPany Profits rose by<br />
24 per cent in 1976/ 77 and the profit share is gradually<br />
moving back towards more normal and more appropriate<br />
levels. The household savings ratio has mved back about<br />
two thirds of the way to " Inormal" and the external current<br />
account position has improved -ma kedly during 1977..-<br />
Since Septentber last there have also been significant<br />
reductions in interest rates on Government -Bonds, . ranging<br />
up to more than half a per cent. This is the first<br />
consistent downward inovem~ nt in the structure of Government<br />
Bond rates for more than four years.<br />
These reductions reflect businessmen's reduced inflationary<br />
expectations and rising confidence.' The yield movements are<br />
in line with the declines which have already taken place in<br />
important private rates.<br />
I am confident that if current policies are continued, the<br />
downward momentum will gather pace and spread to a wide range<br />
of financial assets and securities. / At tines I<br />
There are two ways in which that can be seen. The more<br />
conmln way, but also the more superficial one, is to look<br />
at the usual economic indicators. I </p>
<p>At times this will involve the Government taking the lead in<br />
reducing one or more of its rates: on other occasions it will involve<br />
the Government responding to mcvements already underway in non-Government<br />
rates. The policy is to achieve, gradually, on a sustainable basis, a mu~ ch<br />
lower interest rate structure.<br />
In order to understand the transformation which the last two years<br />
have wrought in the Australian economic scene we have to understand<br />
what those two years have been all about.<br />
They have not been about producing a " quick fix" for economic output,<br />
or unemployment, or any of those things.. because, as I noted earlier,, the<br />
is no hope for us in policies of that kind.<br />
What they have been about is the hard and undramatic grind of putting in<br />
place and maintaining the kind of policies which can gradually lead<br />
the restoration of the pre-conditions for a return to more normal levels<br />
of economic activity and employment.<br />
Seen in that context it is remarkable in one sense that we have been able<br />
to put our policies in place while continuing to achieve growth in<br />
economic activity and in employment. Not even the United States and<br />
Germany succeeded in doing that.<br />
Thus, our non-farm GDP in the Jfune Quarter of 1977 was 5% higher than<br />
in the December Quarter of 1975, and, over the two years to August, 1977,<br />
employment rose by 180,000. b<br />
By contrast in the lost year of the Labor Government there was a fall<br />
in the number of employed persons.<br />
But what I seek to emphasise tonight is not, as I say, those usual<br />
economic indicators. Much more fundamentally imnportant, over this<br />
time, has been the re-establishment of broadly appropriate settings<br />
for our f iscal, monetary and external policies. I cannot emphasise<br />
that too strongly.<br />
it is quite basic to any appraisal of the future of Australia in the<br />
years ahead. As a consequence, we have gone a long way towards restoring<br />
business and consuner confidence by bringing down inflation, and<br />
inflationary expectations and improving profitability. And abovre all,<br />
the shadow of " Big Government" is lifting.<br />
What, then, of the future outlook?<br />

basically a reflection of inflation rates that are still too high,<br />
inflationary expectations that are Insufficiently diminished, profits<br />
that are insufficiently restored, and above all, fears of the policy<br />
instabilities of governments. Fears the force of which, indeed, these<br />
very suggestions I referred to are in danger of confirming. / In the </p>
<p>/ Aga inst<br />
-7-<br />
In the United States, the Chairman of the U. S. council of Economic-<br />
Advisers, Mr. Schultze, recently complained that:-<br />
" Oar inflationary problem also continues to plague us. Inflation<br />
is no longer running at the double digit rates of a f ew years ago, but<br />
the underlying rate of six and six and a half percent that persists is<br />
far too high for comfort."<br />
He went on to note that:<br />
" The years of deep recession and double digit inflation f rora which we<br />
are emerging left scars on the economy -that will take a long time to<br />
heal. The severe ;: economic decline of 1974/ 75 with the consequlent<br />
reduction in employment, income, capacity use, and business profits was<br />
a shattering experience to business f irms and to workers and consumers.<br />
Double digit inflation also had a devastating effect on business and<br />
consumer planning for the future. Memories of these events linger on<br />
and generate a climate of substantial uncertainty and nervousness<br />
nobut the future."<br />
if those comments are true of the United States-which ot-.. oourse they<br />
are how much more true are they of Australia, whose experience in<br />
all those regards cited by Mr. Schultze has been so muich worse. </p>
<p>Against tis sort of backgrouna, it seenw apprupx. 4x tco a~ n<br />
what a policy involving increased government spending would do<br />
to further reduce inflation and inflationary expectations?<br />
The answer to that question is that it would clearly make them<br />
worse. And that, by doing so, they would further delay the full<br />
recovery of economic activity and employment.<br />
By contrast, Mr Chairman, policies in Australia for the last two<br />
years have been based and will continue to be based on the<br />
firm conviction that rooting out inflation, and the restoration<br />
of confidence in the ability and determination of government<br />
to achieve and maintain that, are the key to restoration of<br />
economic health in this country.<br />
I have indicated elsewhere that, with inflation in Australia.<br />
in 1978, now forecast at around seven and a half percent<br />
or less we expect to achieve growth in that year of around<br />
f ive percent. We also expect unemployment to decline steadily<br />
from February.<br />
with more appropriate outcomes in the area of wage determination<br />
than we have been getting, the outlook could be even brighter.<br />
I emphasise, Mr Chairman, that all of these expectations are<br />
based on a continuation of existing policy settings. These<br />
will enable consolidation and further progress in reducing<br />
inflation and in restoring confidence.<br />
In this latter regard it is significant that the engine of<br />
sustained recovery business investment is now moving into<br />
a higher. gear. For without additional investment we cannot in<br />
the longer run, have growth in real product or therefore in<br />
real incomes or employment.<br />
The, government -attaches particular importance therefore to<br />
the indictions in the Statisticiant's latest survey that<br />
private enterprises expect to increase their aggregate new<br />
capital expenditure in the six months to December by no less<br />
than fourteen percent, in seasonally adjusted terms on the<br />
level of the previous six months.<br />
on the. same basis, the expected increase is thirty-three percent<br />
in the manufacturing sector and sixty-six percent in mining.<br />
For over a year now, the government has monitored the extent<br />
and possible timing of planned investment of a large scale<br />
nature in the Australian manufacturing and minimg industries.<br />
major projects to coomence in the next three years, some of<br />
which are under-way, are estimated to involve expenditure ( in<br />
1976/ 77 prices) of $ 6,000 million during their construction<br />
or development phases.<br />
Aggregate estimates of intentions of this kind must<br />
inevitably be subject to-sbme qualifications, such as trends<br />
in international trade and domestic political developments.<br />
However, the government is advised that $ 6,000 million in<br />
major projects can be classified as " firm".<br />
Mining Investment in particular appears set to increase<br />
significantly. Major project investment in manufacturing<br />
is also foreshadowed concentrated in a few industries,<br />
especially chemicals and mineral processing. / in Addition# </p>
<p>-9-<br />
in addition, a substantial, but as yet unmeasured,<br />
scope exists for the manufacturing sector to participate<br />
in the construction, mnining and processing phases of<br />
the major mineral developments.<br />
Looking ahead into-.. the medium term, investment trends will be<br />
influenced significantly if a small number of very large projects<br />
proceed. These are the North West Shelf gas project, uranium<br />
mining, and processing, alumina production, open-cut coking<br />
coal projects, and petrochemical plants. It seems quite clear<br />
that Western Australia and Queensland will become increasingly<br />
important locations for investment not only in mining bat also<br />
in manuf acturing ( mainly mineral processing).-<br />
I note also that the latest United States Comerce Department<br />
Survey of Expected Capital Expenditure by U. S. affiliates.*<br />
in Australia points to a twenty percent increase next year.<br />
A clear sign of the increasing confidence being shown by<br />
overseas investors in this country.<br />
Since the removal of the V. DJR. capital inflow controls on<br />
7 % fuly this year, the flow of applications for private<br />
overseas borrowings has, as must be expected, been fluctuatling.<br />
Nevertheless, there have been 93 applications over this<br />
period for private overseas borrowings, totalling $ 718 million<br />
of which $ 253 -million is for mining'; $ 199 for finance;<br />
$ 123 million for manufacturing; $ 93 million for commerce;<br />
and $ 60 million for property development. Approvals so far<br />
total 79 for $ 535 million.<br />
This too is evidence of the confidence of overseas investors<br />
in Australia. It supports the case for the government overseas<br />
borrowing du rng..._ t. e. period while private investment is in<br />
the process of recovering.<br />
To this internationally oriented. gathering, it is particularly<br />
appropriate that 1 should say that the prospect of a new<br />
era of exciting development is opening up for Australia.<br />
The resources are there to be developed; the labour force<br />
is there to help develop them. Increasingly, too, the good<br />
sense of most of the people who make up that Labour force<br />
is re-asserting itself; as the. great majority of Australian<br />
workers are coming to realise that higher wages do not reduce<br />
unemployment but increase it.<br />
With the outlook for profits improving, capital will be coming<br />
forward to undertake the necessary investment projects.<br />
And is indeed already beginning to do so.<br />
Last, but by no means least,, businessmen and consumers alike<br />
can now look forward to a stable and predictable framework<br />
of government policies within which to go about their<br />
respective affairs. Australia is not yet out of the woods.<br />
But we have set out f eet on the path towards goals which,<br />
when achieved, will make this country once again a land of which<br />
. we. can -be. proud, a land which can be an example to the world.<br />
