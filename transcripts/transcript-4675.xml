-'! AUSTRALIA&amp;<br />
FOR PRESS 10 APRIL 1978<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY CHIP AND CARON CARTER<br />
President Carter will send his son and daughter-in-law,<br />
Mr. Chip Carter and Mrs. Caron Carter, as his personal<br />
representatives to the celebration of Australia-America week<br />
in Australia from 6 May to 15 May.<br />
They were invited by the Government and the Australian-American<br />
Association. The celebration of Australia-America Week commemorates the<br />
close ties between the two countries. For this reaso n, I am<br />
delighted that this year's special guest will be the<br />
President's son and daughter-in-law.<br />
Such visits add a personal dimension to the already close<br />
political and economic ties between the two countries.<br />
Mr. and Mrs. Carter are expected to arrive in Sydney on<br />
Saturday, 6 May, and following a brief visit to Canberra, will<br />
return to Sydney to attend the Coral Sea Commemoration<br />
Service at St. Stephen's Uniting Church on 7 May and the<br />
Remembrance Service and wreath-laying at the Cenotaph on 8 May.<br />
They will then visit Brisbane, Newcastle, Wagga, Canberra,<br />
Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide, to participate in<br />
the activities of State branches of the Australian-American<br />
Association. The Carters will depart Australia on 15 May from Sydney. </p>
