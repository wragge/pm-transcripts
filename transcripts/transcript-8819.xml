PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA'S DEBT AND PAYMENTS PROBLEM<br />
Recognising that the Comnmonwealth's responsibility for the health and well being of the<br />
national economy necessarily involves a concern for the economic and financial position of<br />
the individual States, the Commonwealth has for some time been concerned that the debt<br />
burden imposed on South Australia as a consequence of the actions of the State Bank of South<br />
Australia has placed an extraordinary and unfair burden on the people of South Australia and<br />
constrained the State in its ability to participate'in the economic recovery now underway.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier have recognised that the debt burden imposed by the<br />
SBSA goes beyond the capacity of South Australia to resolve without placing an undue<br />
burden on the citizens of the State.<br />
The Commonwealth Labor Government is prepared to providespecil financial assistance to<br />
South Australia in order to help the State in reducing its current debt burden. This action is<br />
consistent with decisions the Government has taken in recent years to assist Tasmania,<br />
Northern Territory and Victoria.<br />
The Keating Government is prepared to provide special assistance to South Australia of a net<br />
present value of $ 600 million. This assistance will take the form of a combination of cash<br />
grants and debt waivers over this year and the next two years and is conditional on the Bank<br />
being sold.<br />
In recognition of the Commonwealth's decision, the Premier will recommend:<br />
I1. thi~ e 1of. tbe SBSAas quickly as practicable consistent with achieving a fair market<br />
price.<br />
2. that the SBSA be brought into the Commonwealth's tax net free of tax losses from 1<br />
July 1994 or upon sale, whichever comes first and the State will make no further<br />
claims<br />
3. that all existing tax losses will be extinguished<br />
4. that the SBSA be brought under the prudential supervision of the RBA no later than 1<br />
64 16 January 1994 by legislation. </p>
<p>South Australia has indicated that it will be introducing a debt management plan designed to<br />
return the State's debt burden to sustainable levels. South Australia will be consulting with thc<br />
Commonwealth on the details of the plan.<br />
This package of measures to be implemented by the Keating and Arnold Governments will<br />
lead to a reduction in South Australia's debt by well in excess of $ 1 billion. This deals in a<br />
dramatic way with South Australia's ongoing debt problems. The Commonwealth is confident<br />
that this will provide South Australia with the capacity to fully and properly participate in the<br />
economic recovery of Australia.<br />
The Commonwealth has agreed to give effect to this agreement upon its re-election.<br />
