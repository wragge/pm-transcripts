TEXT OF RADIC/ TV COMMENT BY THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR HAROLD HOLT, IN LAUNCHING<br />
THE " FITNESS AUSTRALIA" CAMPAIGN 7TH -AUGUST, -1CZ~ 7<br />
" FITNESS AUSTRALIA"<br />
Australia does not have enough people all the more<br />
need for us to be fit people. Good health is an obligation of good<br />
citizenship. If more people gave as much attention to keeping their<br />
bodies in good working order as they do their motor cars, they would<br />
feel a lot better and enjoy life a lot more.<br />
For most of the 70 per cent of Austral ians living in<br />
cities, fitness is a challenge. Our successes in sport do not prove<br />
that we are a physically tough people. Too many are spectators<br />
not enough iD articipate. Not easy perhaps to find opportunities for<br />
sport, and many city jobs make little call on physical effort.<br />
ie can make our own opportunities quite simply!<br />
To help you keep fit, a book of simple<br />
exercises has been issued today throughout Australia.<br />
here. It is free' I hope you will get yourself one.<br />
life, and they<br />
not be soft as physical I have my copy<br />
Fit people lead longer lives. They get more out of<br />
can give more to it. To be strong as a nation, we must<br />
its citizens. </p>
