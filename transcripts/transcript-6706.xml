PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 AUGUST 1985<br />
At the invitation of Prime Minister Somare I will be<br />
visiting Port Moresby on 15 and 16 September to attend<br />
Papua New Guinea's Tenth Anniversary of Independence<br />
celebrations. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr<br />
Clyde Holding, will accompany me.<br />
The Tenth Anniversary celebrations will be a special<br />
event for both Papua New Guinea and Australia. It will<br />
be an occasion to celebrate Papua New Guinea's record of<br />
great national achievement since attaining independence<br />
ten years ago. Our two countries can take satisfaction<br />
in having put the colonial past behind us and developing<br />
a relationship of friendship, equality and good<br />
neighbourliness. Australia and Papua New Guinea enjoy close and<br />
constructive relations in the region, with shared<br />
interests in the activities of bodies such as the South<br />
Pacific Forum. We also co-operate in wider<br />
international bodies such as the Commonwealth and the<br />
United Nations.<br />
I look forward during my visit to signing, together with<br />
Prime Minister Somare, a Memorandum of Understanding<br />
setting out the basis of our bilateral aid arrangements*<br />
for the next five years. Consultations on this matter<br />
have been successfully concluded between the Foreign<br />
Minister, Mr Hayden, and his Papua New Guinea<br />
counterpart, Mr Giheno.<br />
In conjunction with my forthcoming visit to Papua New<br />
Guinea I also intend to visit the Torres Strait Islands,<br />
where I will be having discussions with community<br />
leaders, on 15 September. </p>
