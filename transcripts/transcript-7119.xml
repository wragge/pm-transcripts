PRIME MINtSTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 16 February 1987<br />
At a meeting of the Federal ALP Caucus this afternoon, Senator<br />
Kerry Sibraa was chosen as the Government's candidate for the<br />
Presidency the Senate. This follows the resignation last<br />
month of Senator the Hon Douglas McClelland. The Senate is<br />
expected to elect its new President tomorrow, 17 February.<br />
I pay tribute-to Senator McClelland, an outstanding President<br />
whose tenure was marked by good humour, unfailing commonsense and<br />
impartiality. He takes with him the respect and good wishes of<br />
all political parties.<br />
I announced last Thursday that Senator the Hon Don Grimes had<br />
submitted his resignation as minister for Community Services and<br />
at that time : conveyed the Government's appreciation for his<br />
great service. I propose to recommend to the Governor-General<br />
that the resic'nation be accepted later today, and at the same<br />
time will be recommending minor changes to the Ministry.<br />
The vacancy in the M:.. nistry caused by the resignation of Senator<br />
Grimes is, in accordance with Caucus' vote, to be filled by<br />
Senator Michael Tate. I have decided to recommend that Senator<br />
Tate be appointed as Special Minister of State. The Hon Michael<br />
3 Young MP, will become Minister for Immigration and Ethnic<br />
Affairs and minister assisting me for multicultural affairs, and<br />
the Hon Chris Hurford MP, will be appointed as Minister for<br />
Community Services.<br />
As a consequence of Senator Grimes' resignation from the<br />
ministry, the position of Deputy Leader of the Government in the<br />
Senate also became vacant. The Caucus has today elected Senator<br />
the Hon Gareth Evans QC, to that office. Senator Evans will also<br />
be manager oE Government Business in the Senate. </p>
