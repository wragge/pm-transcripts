t LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF 1IT. HUBERT HUIVPHmEY,<br />
VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE U. S.<br />
AT CANBERRA 19th FEBRUARY, 1966<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Vice-President, your Excellencies,<br />
1Ministerial and Parliamentary Colleagues, Distinguished Visitors<br />
from the United States and any ct. 1, ers of you tL-hat I may have<br />
omitted: It's a very great pleasure and privilege for the<br />
Head of an Australian Government to welcome to this country<br />
a distinguished leader in the Administration such as we have<br />
here today in the person of Mr. Hubert Humphrey. It is, I -think,<br />
more than ten years, 11r. Humphrey, since we had a visit from one<br />
of-ycDux Vice-Pr esiderri's. In fact, it w I tUhink the only visit<br />
we had ever had at that point of time from a Vice-President of the<br />
United States. In a sense, therefore, it's been a long time<br />
between Vice-Presidents, but if today's talk is any indication<br />
I think vie will be seeing each other much more frequently in<br />
future than perhaps wie h-ave in the past. Because, as is evident<br />
enough, your country and ours are fi. nding each other increasingly<br />
involved in the problems of Asla and in particular of South*-East<br />
Asia There is no occasion to dwell at length before an<br />
Australian audience or public on the close and warm relationship<br />
between our two countries. We have inherited a common tradition,<br />
a common democratic-tradition from the 1Ilother of Parliaments in<br />
the United Kingdoi7., you adapting in your own wvay the Parliamentary<br />
system to your own needs, we in Australia with a Parliarnuntary<br />
democracy serving ours. And we have in the space of the last fifty<br />
years fou-ht together in the cause of freedom, twice together in<br />
two great world conflicts. We were the first country to declare<br />
ourselves with you in the cricis of Korea, and we are one of the<br />
few countries serving with you in a military capacity in Viet Nam<br />
at this time, and the warmth of our friendship has cemented the<br />
mutuality of interest which exists for us in this part of the world.<br />
We across the other side of the Pacific Ocean have<br />
watched admiringly the growth over the years of the mightiest power<br />
that the world has ever known. It has been something of an<br />
inspiration to us. We have a great land mass to develop, roughly<br />
the size of the United States itself if you leave Alaska out of the<br />
picture; and we recall that it was only twelve years after your<br />
own Declaration of Independence that Australia had its first<br />
suttlement. What is not always realised in this country is that<br />
you were only four million people when our first settlement<br />
occu-rred in Australia, but over the intervening years you<br />
have grown to something over 190 millions of people, establishing<br />
the most powerful nation that the world has ever seen. We<br />
believe that by the same principles, by the same encouragement<br />
of enterprise and initiative which has marked the American story,<br />
we too can grow to be a great sister nation in the Pacific and<br />
we are heartened by the example that wie see in you and we are<br />
assisted very greatly by the encouragement, by the flow of<br />
American investment and citizens to this country from time to time.<br />
But more immediately, of course, we are caught up together in the<br />
problems of South-East Asia, and for our part, recognising the<br />
contribution you made to our own security in the darker days of the<br />
Second World War, wie are grateful again for the firmness of<br />
purpose and the resolution which your President and the American </p>
<p>people are showing in relation to the issue in Viet Nan~.<br />
We, with you, view this as part of a great international<br />
conflict. We see this as one of the critical struggles in the<br />
history of the free peoples everywhere. This goes far deeper in<br />
our judgement than the preservation of the people in South Viet Nam<br />
against intrusion and aggression from those who would wish to<br />
destory the integrity of that country; important though that is,<br />
we see this as part of the menace of Communist expansion throughout<br />
the world and what happens in South Viet Namn is in our eyes not<br />
merely of interest1, to the people of that country, niot merely of<br />
interest to us in relation to our own security here in Aistralia<br />
although I believe that too to be involved, but we see it as<br />
of significance for the cause of free peoples everywhere, and I<br />
know that is how your President and your Aidministration see this<br />
struggle. Nowi, Sir, we have watched with admiration, too, the<br />
way in which your President has looked upon this not merely<br />
as a matter of military achievement, not merely as a goal to be<br />
gained by military means and then the rest of the story forgotten.<br />
He has, from the outset, and you have devotea so much of your<br />
own energies to this aspect, seen the necessity for social and<br />
econz: mic aasistance which wul bring to the peoples of this<br />
area and, in tine with an improvement in standards throughout<br />
the area generally, victory also over those age-old enemies of<br />
mankind to which you referred on your arrival in Australia<br />
yesterday. We know that these great evils of hunger, of disease,<br />
of illiteracy, of lack of employment opportunities, that these<br />
things in an enlightened community can be met successfully and<br />
conquered. It has been an enlightened and imaginative attitude<br />
on the part of the President and members of his Administration<br />
like yourself that they have seen * the totality of this problem,<br />
that they have seen its relationship to the world scene generally,<br />
and we would hope that as this becomes more clearly perceived<br />
around the rest of the free world that others will join with you,<br />
as we in our own small way have done, not merely to give moral<br />
support to your cause but to assist in a material way either in<br />
a military capacity or perhaps more generally in terms of<br />
economic assistance throughout this area.<br />
You, Sir, come to us as a very welcome visitor and you<br />
bring with you the most distinguished and influential delegation<br />
from the United States, I think, that this country has ever<br />
known. iewelcome w,, ith you an old friend in Ambassador Harriman.<br />
I would like you to know that he has given us great assistance<br />
from the information and advice he is able to bring so freshly<br />
from discussions himself in various parts of the world. Whenever<br />
any of us go to Washington, we know that we have a warm friend<br />
awaiting us there in the person of yourself, Mr. Ambassador.<br />
And speaking of ambassadors, we would like you to<br />
report to your President that we arc grrateful to him for sending<br />
to us that splendid representative of your country, the Aimbassador<br />
of the United States here in Australia, M. r. Ed Clark. He and I<br />
established a warm basis of friendship from the outset. I know<br />
this has been a general experience of any who have come in contact<br />
with him and America could not wish for a more effective represen-<br />
tative in this country nor we for a warmer friend of Australia.<br />
You in the various capacities you undertake, Mr.<br />
Vice-President have interest in space research and aeronautical<br />
matters and you will be aware that here in Australia there is<br />
another tangible link of our friendly cssociations with you -through<br />
the tracking stations which have now been established at various<br />
points in Australia. But just as in -this and in so many other<br />
ways we find it useful to maintain together the friendly and<br />
fruitful links of co-operation, we believe that it is in the years<br />
ahead perhaps that our greatest contribution together will be made<br />
to the welfare of a significant area of the world, and through this<br />
a contribution to the peace, the stability and the prosperity<br />
of the world as a whle. </p>
<p>We, for our part, in A'ustralia would welcome early<br />
talks and discussions with you and with Great Britain and Novw<br />
Zealand on somo of the problems of the area. I don't mention just<br />
those four countries in any excluding sensec in trying to keep<br />
anybody else out of the discussion, but to face the matter<br />
realistically in the sort of problems that vie have to meet here<br />
in the years ahead. Here are countries which can make a significant<br />
material contribution together and I believe it is of first<br />
importance that we should be able to co-ordinate efforts to<br />
discuss together problems which arise and to which, by mutual effort,<br />
we may be able to bring some assistance or somc solution.<br />
This is particularly true in the economic and social field.<br />
We in Australia frequently can perform a useful service by the<br />
technical advice v.' c can bring to countries that are themselves<br />
passing through a developmental phase, and in those and other<br />
ways, Australia, limited though its resources may be in a country<br />
of less than 12 million people, Akustralia can make its own valuable<br />
contri but ion.<br />
Sir, you have come at a difficult time through a most<br />
arduous and exacting journey in key areas of South-East A* sia<br />
and A.' sia generally, but I am quite certain that if the Australian<br />
people had been a~ ble to share our experience of this morning when<br />
xhad the most stimulating and heartening and illuminating talk from<br />
you, they would have no hesitation in their mind as to the justice<br />
and good sense of our cause or the strength of the support they<br />
would bring to it. I believe, Sir, that you will find in this<br />
country support as strong as you will find anywhere in the world,<br />
even perhaps including your own country, for what you are doing.<br />
I can speak to you as not merely the Head of the Government, but<br />
as the Leader of one of the two Governme~ qnt Parties and tcll you that<br />
there isn't one member of the Government Parties who does not<br />
subscribe wholeheartedly to the policy which the United States is<br />
adopting in relation to Viet Nam. I think, Sir, I can claim that<br />
that is a rather bctter scoring record even than the Congress can<br />
deomonstrate for you.<br />
Well, gentlemen, you are not here to have me speak at<br />
length and we are all anxious to hear from the Vice-President.<br />
We have established already, I would hope, in your minds, the<br />
warmth of the welcome here in Australia, and shortly I shall be<br />
asking all to join me in honouring the toast of our distihguished<br />
guest, but as ovidence that that warmath of welcome is general<br />
throughout Aiustralia, I san going to ask Mr. Calwell, the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, to join in supporting me in the toast which I<br />
shall shortly be submitting. Arthur, would you please speak. </p>
