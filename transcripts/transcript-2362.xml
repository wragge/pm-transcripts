FOR PRESS P. M. No. 1971<br />
PROPOSED INCREASE IN DOCTORS' FEES<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON<br />
Dr. Forbes announced last night that he was concerned at the size<br />
of the fee increases recommended by the State Branche s of the Australian<br />
Medical Association. He also stated that he could not accept their recommended increases<br />
as reasonable. Speaking for the Government I now say that we are more than<br />
concerned at the size of the increases. We are appalled that in the<br />
circumstances in which Australia finds itself such great increases in fees should<br />
be even considered by the A. M. A.<br />
The result of these increases would be to present a Bill of $ 32<br />
million to the Australian people and this cost would have to be borne either<br />
by the patients of doctors or by the taxpayer..<br />
I hope and believe that individual doctors in the profession, as<br />
good Australians would be more resp',-nsible than to endorse the stand taken<br />
by their representatives. The Government believes there is no justification whatever for<br />
increpses of this size. We do not believe that any profession should be able to<br />
fix their fees at any level which appeals to them when they are supported by<br />
public money. If agreement cannot be reached between the Government and the<br />
A. M. A. on reasonable increases we believe the matter should go to Arbitration<br />
and .: ot be decided by unilateral action on the part of the A. M. A.<br />
If the A. M. A. refuses to accept this course then the Government<br />
is duty bound in the interests of the Australian people and of the fight against<br />
inflation to take all m6esures open to it to combat the proposed rise.<br />
I have asked representatives of the A. M. A. to come to Canberra to<br />
discuss this whole matter with me on Friday.<br />
