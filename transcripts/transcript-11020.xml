<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, welcome to the programme.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Well you could hardly complain about the headlines today. You couldn't</p>
<p> have written them better yourself.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they were good, but they were deserved. This is a good budget</p>
<p> but we're not complacent.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Brian Harradine didn't think you were too clever. He says the</p>
<p> compensation for the youth allowance in the budget was too little</p>
<p> too late, and improperly tied to his vote for the GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not going to conduct any public dialogue with Senator</p>
<p> Harradine on your programme, or any other programme. When I have things</p>
<p> to say to Senator Harradine I always pay him the courtesy of saying</p>
<p> them to him privately intervening public comment.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But we have the political reality that the man who's so essential</p>
<p> to getting this tax plan thorough the Senate is now very bitter. Says</p>
<p> he's ashamed, says he had a deal with you and you welshed on</p>
<p> it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven't welshed on a deal with anybody. But beyond saying</p>
<p> that I'm not going to get into any commentary about any discussions</p>
<p> I have had or might have with Brian Harradine.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>On unemployment, ACOSS says the budget has failed to take decisive</p>
<p> action to tackle our top national problem. Your own forecasts suggest</p>
<p> the best you can hope for next financial year is to stabalise the</p>
<p> problem of around 7.5%.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think ACOSS is quite wrong. Unemployment now is lower than</p>
<p> it's been for ten years. There are two ways that you reduce unemployment:</p>
<p> you maintain strong economic growth and we've certainly done</p>
<p> that, and you also make changes to the way the labour market operates</p>
<p> to remove disincentives to the employment of people. We're trying</p>
<p> to do that and we're being stopped by the Labor Party and the</p>
<p> Democrats in the Senate. If they pass our laws on unfair dismissals</p>
<p> and youth wages, and Mr Reith's foreshadowed industrial relations</p>
<p> reforms we'll see further cuts in unemployment.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But aren't the critics right when they say where was the plan</p>
<p> for jobs here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But Paul they're not right because the greatest plan you can</p>
<p> have for jobs is to run a strong economy.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>The number of unemployed people getting intensive assistance is to</p>
<p> be reduced by 25,000 a year. The same number is going to added onto</p>
<p> work for the dole which may be popular but no one could argue it's</p>
<p> very effective in putting people into work.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't agree with that. No scheme is 100% effective from</p>
<p> getting people.....</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>[inaudible] 32%.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's a damn sight more effective than many of the old</p>
<p> Working Nation programmes. And the contact with work skills, and the</p>
<p> work ethic that work for the dole provides is extremely valuable.</p>
<p> There are of course many more apprenticeships under this government.</p>
<p> There are 70,000 more apprenticeships under this government than under</p>
<p> the former government. And if anything provides people with skills</p>
<p> it's apprenticeships.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>The health insurance measures Prime Minister, aren't you forcing</p>
<p> people to buy a product that they think is poor value? Too expensive,</p>
<p> the gap's still there. They've walked away from it and now</p>
<p> you're sort of herding them back to the funds.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're not herding them back but we are, I suppose encouraging</p>
<p> them to see whether their priorities might be wrong by saying to them:</p>
<p> okay, you can put off joining a private health fund until you need</p>
<p> it, but you may find then that it's dearer than it would otherwise</p>
<p> be. And if that results in more people joining private health funds</p>
<p> when they're young and healthy, all for the better. And that</p>
<p> will take pressure off Medicare, it will take pressure off the public</p>
<p> hospital system, and it will boost private health insurance. And we</p>
<p> don't make any apologies for doing that. We think it will underpin</p>
<p> the 30% tax rebate.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But as you deliver the funds with ever increasing captive market,</p>
<p> how much responsibility are you reminding them that they would have</p>
<p> to offer better products, better service, and more price restraint?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there will be obviously, with other changes there'll be</p>
<p> increased competition for the funds. The very nature of lifetime health</p>
<p> cover is that it sets up a more competitive market. Of course they</p>
<p> carry responsibilities. They continue to be tightly regulated and</p>
<p> so they should be.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But look, inflation, I mean haven't you ever thought how come</p>
<p> inflation has been so low for so long, every time I turn around there's</p>
<p> another fund knocking on the door wanting to crank up its prices.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that, but you've also got to understand that until</p>
<p> we brought in the 30% there had been an almost continuous haemorrhaging</p>
<p> of people out of the funds over the period of 8 or 10 years. A lot</p>
<p> of the premium rises of the last few years have been a direct consequence</p>
<p> of people simply deserting the funds, and something had to be done</p>
<p> to reverse that. And we've done it with our 30% rebate and now</p>
<p> lifetime health cover.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And finally, with all this talk of a decade of prosperity, plus this</p>
<p> big boost for medical research, you're not planning to stay in</p>
<p> the Lodge forever are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I certainly am concerned to ensure that the next decade is a</p>
<p> decade where the intellectual and the resources of our nation are</p>
<p> used wisely and in a visionary way. And we have wonderful doctors,</p>
<p> we have great scientists and I think the first part of the 21st</p>
<p> Century is going to be very much about the nation that does best in</p>
<p> using its intellectual capital and I'm very keen to be part of</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
