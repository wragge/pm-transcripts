    <content><![CDATA[<p>More than three quarters of the work on North Queensland Stadium will be completed by the local community, giving business the opportunity to expand and create local jobs for the region.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Queensland State Development Minister Dr Anthony Lynham and Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill today announced Watpac had been appointed managing contractor to build the $250 million stadium.</p>
<p>Watpac has outlined a plan for more than 80 per cent of hours spent building the stadium to be by locals and at least 80 per cent of the value of the project to be spent on local subcontractors and suppliers.</p>
<p>It is expected more than 2000 people from the Townsville region will be involved in contracts related to the build of the 25,000 seat stadium. Watpac will be targeting 6.6 per cent of the construction workforce to be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</p>
<p>Mr Turnbull, who pledged $100 million towards the stadium as part of an Australian first City Deal, said he was committed to the stadium creating opportunities for the local community.</p>
<p>“This stadium will be built by the people of Townsville,’’ he said.</p>
<p>“It will increase investment in the region which will give local businesses the opportunity to expand and employ more residents.”</p>
<p>“North Queensland stadium is the centrepiece of Australia’s first City Deal, right here in Townsville. Right across the board, every lever of the Commonwealth, State Government and the Townsville City Council is working together to create jobs and a more liveable city that drives the North Queensland economy.”</p>
<p>Queensland Minister for State Development Anthony Lynham said the stadium was going to be a game changer for the North Queensland economy.</p>
<p>“Local jobs, local business opportunities and a strong local presence was the deal maker,” Dr Lynham said.</p>
<p>“Watpac’s winning tender met the contract requirements for maximising local job and training opportunities, including for Indigenous workers, as well as having a long established Townsville presence and outstanding stadia construction experience.”</p>
<p>Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill welcomed the announcement, saying forums would be run by Watpac to help local sub-contractors and suppliers compete for stadium contracts. </p>
<p>“I understand they’ll be maximising opportunities for local businesses to compete for work on the stadium, including splitting trade packages into multiple smaller contracts to ensure local businesses have the opportunity to tender on the project. The local jobs focus is heartily welcomed,” she said.</p>
<p>Watpac will use the Queensland Government’s ICN Gateway at: <a href="http://www.northqueenslandstadium.icn.org.au">www.northqueenslandstadium.icn.org.au</a> as a source for tender registrations. Currently, 443 companies have registered their interest for work packages through the ICN Gateway, with 182 or 41 per cent, based in North Queensland.</p>
<p>Watpac opened its Townsville office in 1998 and has delivered numerous projects in the region including the Townsville Hospital Sub-Acute Facility, the Ergon Garbutt Depot redevelopment, the James Cook University Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine and Lavarack Barracks Single LEAP 2 accommodation precinct.</p>
<p>The North Queensland Stadium is a joint project of the Australian Government, Queensland Government and Townsville City Council and is supported by both the National Rugby League and the North Queensland Cowboys. The North Queensland Stadium forms part of the Townsville City Deal signed in 2016.</p>
