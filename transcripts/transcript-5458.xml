PRIME MINISTER.<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 28 SEPTEMBER, 1980<br />
WORLD CONSERVATION STRATEGY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, today announced the<br />
Commonwealth Government's proposals in relation to World<br />
Conservation Strategy. Mr. Fraser recalled that on 6 March, 1980<br />
he had attended the national launching of the Strategy and had<br />
accepted it on behalf of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
The Strategy, which was jointly develo ped by the International<br />
Union for the Conservation of Nature and National Resources<br />
( IUCN), the United Nations-Environment Program ( UNEP), and<br />
the World Wilf life Fund ( WWF), seeks to integrate conservation<br />
and development " objectives. It will require increased<br />
dialogue between conservationists and developers both groups,<br />
in the past, have had misconceptions about priorities and<br />
objectives which need to be reconciled.<br />
The Strategy acknowledges that economic development and the use<br />
of living resources are essential human activities and, further,<br />
that conservation is essential if sustainable development is<br />
to continue.<br />
Mr. Fraser went on to say that the World Conservation Strategy<br />
is only meaningful if the key words " Conservation" and<br />
" Development" are clearly defined and understood.<br />
Conservation may be defined as managing our natural resources<br />
so that they may produce appropriate benefits to the present<br />
generation while not jeopardising the needs of the future.<br />
Development involves the application of resources to satisfy our<br />
needs and to improve the quality of life. It must take<br />
account of social and ecological factors as well as economic<br />
realities.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that the major recommendation of the World<br />
Conservation Strategy is that a National Conservation Strategy<br />
should be developed in each country. The Prime Minister said that<br />
the Commonwealth had concluded a preliminary assessment of the<br />
World Conservation Strategy and that the States and the Northern<br />
Territory have agreed to collaborate with the Commonwealth in<br />
utilising this document to develop a National Conservation<br />
Strategy for Australia. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Australian Strategy will be developed in two phases.<br />
First, the World Strategy Objectives and Recommendations will'<br />
be considered in the context of Australian conditions, allowing<br />
for relevant existing and planned activities. Secondly, this<br />
will give rise to a draft Australian strategy, developed in<br />
consultation with State and Territory Governments taking into<br />
account the views of the wider community including industry<br />
and copservation bodies.<br />
The Australian Strategy will form the basis for action plans and<br />
priority measures for implementation by Governments and<br />
non-government bodies.<br />
Mr. Fraser noted that the examination of the World Conservation<br />
Strategy had shown that it was, to a significant extent, already<br />
being implemented in Australia. Mr. Fraser mentioned that<br />
important achievements by the Governments in Australia-<br />
Commonwealth, State and Local -include:<br />
The establishment of protected areas to preserve unique<br />
eco-systems and Species the States, the Northern<br />
Territory and the Commonwealth have established<br />
national Parks in their respective juridictions<br />
* The environmental assessment techniqjue is widely<br />
applied to major development projects to ensure that<br />
environmental as well as economic factors are assessed<br />
when proposals are heing considered<br />
* Arrangements have bee * n agreed. between the Commonwealth<br />
and the States to ensure that marine living resources<br />
are managed effectively for example, the Commonwealth<br />
and Queensland Governments have decided on co-operative<br />
arrangements to conserve the Great Barrier Reef..<br />
* The Commonwealth Government has enacted legislation to<br />
protect whales and the flora and fauna of Antarctica.<br />
* Australia is participating in " Bio-mass", an international<br />
study of marine living resources in the Southern oceans.<br />
* Both the Great Barrier Reef and the Kakadu National Park<br />
have been nominated for inclusion in the World Heritage List<br />
Mr. Fraser concluded by noting that the World Conservation<br />
Strategy is an important, timely and well balanced document.<br />
He went on to say that while Australia's record in this field<br />
is outstanding, the Strategy was a valuable document which<br />
served to stimulate a more focussed approa * ch to the management<br />
of living resources and to provide policy guidelines on how<br />
this can be carried out by Governments, conservationists and<br />
developers. Mr. Fraser said that he had been in contact with<br />
the Premiers and with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory,<br />
all of whom had agreed to participate in the-development of a<br />
National Conservation Strategy in Australia. ./ 3 </p>

Mr. Fraser concluded by noting that he would be advising<br />
the States and the Northern Territory of the results of the<br />
Commonwealth's preliminary consideration of the World Strategy<br />
and that he looked forward to further progress in<br />
consultation with the States, industry and with the wider<br />
community in implementing the strategy which will meet the<br />
particular needs of Australia and Australians.<br />
