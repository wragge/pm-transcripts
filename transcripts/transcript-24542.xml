    <subjects>Inaugural Interfaith Parliamentary Prayer Breakfast,  getting on with governing,  the Governmentâs $5.5 billion Growing Jobs and Small Business package,  pension legislation,  Free Trade Agreement with China,  new measures to strengthen Australian citizenship.</subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, itâs great to be here at this Interfaith Parliamentary prayer breakfast. I think this is a good tradition. I think it is a very good tradition and I hope it will continue. We have long had a Parliamentary Christian prayer breakfast but I think this interfaith prayer breakfast is a more fitting way of acknowledging the diversity of modern Australia while also appreciating our aspirations to the higher things.</p>
<p>I probably should also say that the Government is getting on with the job of governing. On Monday we passed the Budget small business boost through the Parliament. Yesterday, the Government reached an agreement with the Greens on changes to pensions and today we will be signing the free trade agreement with China. So, this is a Government that is every day getting on with the job of doing the right thing for the people of Australia.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, why did you keep the Solicitor Generalâs advice from some members of your Cabinet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The important thing is that we have a sound law which strips the citizenship from terrorists who are dual nationals and that is what we are going to do because if you go to Syria or Iraq to fight with a terrorist Army we donât want you back and this is the best way to ensure that this is the case.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Sorry, youâre not answering the question. Why did you keep the advice from your Ministers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Again, I want to stress we are going to do the right thing by the people of Australia, weâre going to keep our country safe and the best way to keep our country safe is to ensure that people who have been fighting with terrorist armies donât come back.</p>
