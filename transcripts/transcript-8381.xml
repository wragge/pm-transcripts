STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, PAUL KEATING<br />
Australia has decided to recognise as independent states the<br />
former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia.<br />
Slovenia and Croatia have met the conditions set out by the<br />
EC on 16 December 1991. These include respect for United<br />
Nations and Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe<br />
( CSCE) principles, including regard for the rule of law,<br />
democracy and human rights, guarantees on minority rights,<br />
observance of international obligations on security and nonproliferation,<br />
respect for the inviolability of all<br />
frontiers, and recourse to peaceful means for the settlement<br />
of disputes.<br />
But much remains to be done before the people of the former<br />
republics of Yugoslavia are able to enjoy the peace and<br />
prosperity that is their right. I strongly urge the leaders<br />
of all the parties to the conflict to demonstrate the<br />
strength of will and political determination to resolve<br />
their differences peacefully. Nor does the act of<br />
recognition bring to an end the responsibility of the<br />
international community to help resolve the conflict. The<br />
international community must continue to promote and support<br />
efforts to ensure that minority rights, territorial disputes<br />
and succession questions are settled peacefully and justly.<br />
I warmly welcome the establishment of these new states, and<br />
wish the leaders and people of the nations of Slovenia and<br />
Croatia well in the tasks ahead. My Government will seek<br />
discussions with the new states on establishing diplomatic<br />
relations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans,<br />
will issue a statement on the arrangements for Australian<br />
recognition. CANBERRA 16 January 1992 </p>
