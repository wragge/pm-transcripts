EMBARGO: 8.00am 7<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 12 MARCH 2982<br />
Visit to Australia of Vice President of the<br />
United States<br />
The Vice President of the United States, The Honourable<br />
George Bush, has accepted my invitation to visit Australia<br />
in late April and early May.<br />
Mr Bush's visit will provide an important opportunity<br />
for talks on international developments affecting<br />
our two countries.<br />
I am also very pleased that Mr Bush has been able to<br />
arrange the dates for his visit to coincide with the<br />
commencement of the Australian-American Week celebrations<br />
which this year will commemorate the 40th Anniversary of<br />
the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the 30th Anniversary of<br />
the entry into force of the ANZUS Treaty.<br />
