TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PARLIAMENTARY RECEPTION FOR HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN AND HIS<br />
ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH<br />
24 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
Your Majesty, your Royal Highness, Your Excellencies,<br />
Parliamentary Colleagues, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen.<br />
Your Majesty, on behalf of the government and people of<br />
Australia it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to<br />
Canberra. I know that on this visit it is your primary purpose to<br />
participate in Sydney's sesquicentennial; but today it is my<br />
primary purpose to congratulate you on the 40th anniversary<br />
of your accession to the throne.<br />
Your Majesty, we have all changed in that time. The men who<br />
sat in the Australian parliament on your first visit they<br />
were all practically men in those days had memories of<br />
Empire. Not a few of them saw the world through imperial<br />
eyes. Many of them had been born in Queen Victoria's day<br />
and remembered the several monarchs in between.<br />
But I daresay a good many members of this parliament are<br />
like the majority of Australians and have known only one<br />
monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.<br />
This is an altogether different generation, reflecting the<br />
profouncL. change. in our two-countries and the relationship<br />
between them.<br />
As our constitutional relationship has evolved so have the<br />
circumstance! s of our economic and political lives.<br />
These days we must both face the necessities of a global<br />
economy and global change of often staggering speed. and<br />
magnitude. We must also face regional realities. </p>
<p>Just as Great Britain some time ago sought to make her<br />
future secure in the European Community, so Australia now<br />
vigorously seeks partnerships with countries in our own<br />
region. Our outlook is necessarily independent.<br />
That independence in part was reflected in your becoming, in<br />
1973, Queen of Australia.<br />
In 1992 it is reflected in our growing sense of national<br />
purpose: in our conviction that we must move quickly and<br />
vigorously to make the most of our human and material<br />
resources and seize our opportunities in the world.<br />
We must do this so that Australians will be assured of the<br />
same freedom and security in the next century as they have<br />
enjoyed in this.<br />
I thank you for your visit, and ask you to accept a gift<br />
from the people of Australia as a token of our affection and<br />
esteem. CANBERRA </p>
