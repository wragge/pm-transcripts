REFERENDUTM: THE " YES" CASE<br />
Talk by the Prime . Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
( This talk opening the " Yes" cases for both referendums will be<br />
telecast and broadcast by -e A. 3. C. in all states this evening).<br />
I want to talk to you about the referendum which will be<br />
held throughout Australia on Saturday, May 27th.<br />
This referendum is necessary oecause your Federal Parliament<br />
proposes and this is subject to your decision to make certain<br />
alterations to the Commonwealth Constitution which the Parliament<br />
considers desirable. have passed the legislation to do this, but,<br />
under the . terms of our Constitution, Parliament's action must oe<br />
approved by you, the people, before that Constitution can oe altered.<br />
For reasons I shall outline, we hope you will say " Yes"<br />
to what we have in mind. ' hen I say we, I include the Leader of the<br />
Country Party, Mr. McEwen, and the Leader of the Labor Party, Mr.<br />
'. hitlam. We have joined in preparing the official " Yes" case,<br />
which should have reached you through your letterbox. ;.' hen I say<br />
we, I can include also . all'e mbers of the House of Representatives<br />
who voted unanimously for the proposals we s . all be putting to you,<br />
and, in the case of the Sen te, ll Senators in sunport of the<br />
proposal rela. ting to aboriginais and an overwhelming majority of<br />
Sen: tors the vote was 45 to 7 who voted in support of the proposal<br />
to break what is called the " rexus" rel'ating to the number of<br />
Senators and Members of the House of Representatives.<br />
You will gather that we are putting two matters before<br />
you. One concerning our . boriginal people and the other described<br />
as the Nexus Referendum. I shall speak first abou,. t the Nexus<br />
Referendum. The word " nexus" may need explaining. It is a short way<br />
of summarisin the words in section 24 of the Commonwealth Constitution<br />
whioh now read this way:-<br />
" The House of Representatives shall be composed of<br />
Members directly chosen by the people of the<br />
Commonwealth, and the number of Members shall be,<br />
as nearly as pricticable, twice the number of the<br />
Senators.<br />
This section, as you will see, ties the House of<br />
Representatives to the Senate in terms of numbers. That is<br />
what the word " nexus" implies. Now to put the matter simply,<br />
all the main political parties in Federal Parliament believe that<br />
this " nexus" should be broken. As matters stand, any increase in<br />
the House of Represen: tatives made necessary by population growth<br />
must be accompanied by an increase of half that total in the number<br />
of Senators. We do not believe this to be necessary. We think it<br />
requires us to create more Members of Parliament than the situation<br />
is likely to call for at any particular time. We have in mind two<br />
things 1) To remove the need to increase the number of<br />
Senators whenever the number of Members in the / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
House of Representatives is increased:<br />
2) To impose a limit on ume extent to which<br />
membership of the House of Representatives can<br />
be increased.<br />
The first would break the " nexus" and the second would<br />
write a safeguard into the Constitution against excessive increases<br />
in the number of parliamentarians.<br />
I am sure thit, as believers in the democratic system<br />
you will be impressed by the fact that the vote in support of these<br />
proposals in the House of Representatives was unanimous and that the<br />
leaders of the three principal political parties have united to ask you..<br />
to give your support to them. e did not embark on this course<br />
lightly. Indeed, legislation for this purpose was introduced by my<br />
predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies, in 1965. ie see the proposals as<br />
commonsense, practical parliamentary reforms. We see your response<br />
to them as a test of political maturity and a rejection of the<br />
prejudice and misleading arguments with which you will find yourselves<br />
assailed. The generally accepted view of all the main political<br />
parties'is that the Senate of 60 members 10 from each of the 6<br />
States needs no increase at this time. The Senate was intended<br />
to be a House of Review and by tradition is regarded as the custodian<br />
of the rights of the smaller States. Its powers are defined and<br />
established in the Constitution and its effectiveness does not<br />
depend upon increased numoers. We have had six States since<br />
Federation and no change in that figure is in sight. Membership<br />
of the House of Representatives, on the other hand, is geared to<br />
the population and we are confronted with a rapid and continuing<br />
population growth.<br />
When the present size of the House of Representatives<br />
was decided in 1949, Australia's population was just on 8 millions.<br />
If the present Parliament runs its normal course, with the next<br />
general election being held in 1969 our population should have<br />
reached 12 millions an increase of 50% in the 20 years which will<br />
have elapsed since 1949. We have no proposal for an increase in the<br />
size of the House of Representatives in any way proportionate to<br />
that increase in population. Indeed we are proposing to you that<br />
the number of Members of the House of Representatives be determined<br />
by dividing the population of each State by not less than 85 000.<br />
In 1949 each Member of the House of Representatives represented on<br />
average 66, COO people. Under our proposal we would continue to<br />
represent not less than 85,000 people, and this despite the enormous<br />
growth in the subject matters dealt with by the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament and their increasing complexity. Australia is a<br />
rapidly growing nation with widening interest and responsibilities.<br />
Matters which in the past occupied little or no time in the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament are now matters of major concern, which in<br />
the judgment of the electorate call for Commonwealth attention and<br />
participation. I have only to mention as examples such matters of<br />
vital concern to you as education, housing, national development,<br />
employment, external affairs, immigration, health and social<br />
services. If you say you cannot break the " nexus" what will<br />
follow. The result will no be that from now to eternity the number<br />
of Senators will remain at 60 and the number of Members of the House<br />
of Representatives at 123. At some point of time, because of<br />
population growth and other factors, the demand for a more<br />
representative Parliament will be irresistible. But the " nexus"<br />
rule would still apply. You will be told by our opponents that ours<br />
is a proposal to increase the numoer of parliamentarians. We do<br />
not need any change in the Constitution to bring that about. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Parliament has unlimited powers to increase the House of<br />
Representatives so long as at the same time it increases the size<br />
of the Senate. Twelve more Memoers of the House of Representatives<br />
would mean 6 more Senators. Tuentyfour additional Members in the<br />
lower House would mean 12 more Senators and so on; One of these<br />
days our population will have reached 20 millions. If the increases<br />
in the House of Representatives to service the needs of this<br />
growing population have to be matched as to half the number of<br />
Members of the House of Representatives by additional Senators,<br />
then we certainly might have a surfeit of politicians. Surely<br />
the sensible alternative to this clumsy kind of operation is to<br />
say " Yes" and break the " nexus" at the same time saying " Yes"<br />
to the provision which will limit the extent to which the House<br />
may be increased now or in the future.<br />
The core of the matter is whether you believe, with us,<br />
thit the Senate membership should not necessarily be enlarged<br />
whenever population growth invites an incro se in the popular House.<br />
If you agree with us you will, far from facilitatin the growth<br />
in the numoer of parliamentarlins, be limiting the increase which<br />
can oe made. It cannot be repeated too often thit a " Yes" vote will not<br />
only remove the out-dated link oetween the Senate and the House of<br />
Representatives; it will also limit the rate at which the popular<br />
House can grow.<br />
The advocates of the case put on a show of iodignation<br />
at the prospect of an increase in Parliament and throw in the glib<br />
phrase thit ' e are already over-governed. 3reat Jritain, a small<br />
island has a House of Commons numbering 630. You don't hear the<br />
English people complaining about the size of the House of Commons,<br />
which is the voice of the nation. The British people believe deeply<br />
and profoundly in the institution of Parliament.<br />
The " No" case strikes ne as a crude appeal to prejudice<br />
rather than an appeal to the commonsense of the Australian people.<br />
A small minority of Senators you could number them on your fingers.-<br />
are in open opposition to reforms supported unanimously by the<br />
House of Representatives and by all the main political parties.<br />
The case they put to you is the oaseless suggestion that your National<br />
Parliament has conspired in some wiy to undermine the Senate, and<br />
they add a sneering imputation that the Members of the National<br />
Parliament elected by you are ln y and inefficient. For good<br />
measure, tAis handful of " to" spokesmen hint darkly at unnecessary<br />
increases in the cost of government. This is another red herring.<br />
The cost of parliamentary government in Australi is remarkably low.<br />
The relevant figure for operitin the House of Representatives works<br />
out at about 30 cents per head of the population. Not very costly<br />
when you think of the role the House of Reoresentatives plays in<br />
our national affairs and in relation to your own lives.<br />
I have enough faith in the good sense of Australian electors<br />
to oelieve they will examine the pros and cons of this auestion calmly<br />
and objectively. They will reject the spirit in which the " No"<br />
spokesmen have approached them. I confidently expect a mature<br />
judgment from mature people.<br />
Now let me say something about the second referendum guestion<br />
the one concerning our aboriginal people. There was no opposition<br />
to it in Parliament in either House and I would anticipate overwhelming<br />
support for it by the electors.<br />
The aboriginal people of Australia are mentioned explicitly<br />
in the Constitution twice only. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Section 127 of the Constitution says:<br />
" In reckonin the numbers of the people of the Comlonwealth,<br />
or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth,<br />
aboriginal natives shall not be counted."<br />
At the turn of the century, when the Constitution was<br />
framed, the principal reason for including Section 127 was the<br />
practical difficulty of countin, the aboriginal population at<br />
that time. It is, however, no longer a serious di ficulty. The<br />
basis for the existence of the section consequently no longer remains.<br />
It is completely out of harmony with our national attitudes<br />
and modern thinking. It has no place in our Constitution in this<br />
age. The second alteration Federal Parliament wants to make<br />
is the deletion of the words " other than the aboriginal race in<br />
any State" from Section 21 ( xxvi).<br />
This section says:<br />
" The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have<br />
power to miake laws for the peace, order and good government<br />
of the Commonwealth with respect to:<br />
"( xxvi) The people of any race, other than the<br />
aboriginal race in any otate, for whom it is<br />
deemed necessary to make special lirs".<br />
We have been influenced by the widespread impression which<br />
exists that the words " other than the aboriginal race in any State"<br />
are discriminatory. Unanimously, Federal Parliamment wants to remove these two<br />
references to the aborigines, because one of the provisions is<br />
out of date and oecause the other is widely believed to be discrininate<br />
against aborigines. Let me remind you a'ain in conclusion that I can speak for<br />
the three leaders of the principal political parties Liberal,<br />
Labor and Country Party for a unanimous House of Representatives,<br />
and for an overwhelming majority of members of the Senate when I<br />
ask you to vote " Yes" to the two questions which ,; ill be Lefore you<br />
on the ballot paper.<br />
