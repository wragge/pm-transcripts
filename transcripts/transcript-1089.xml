CIVIC SERVICE, PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH,<br />
CHELTENHAM? VICTORIA 4+ TH PRIL, 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir, Recently I was in London, I started off thinking I<br />
was on holiday and I ended up by attending the funeral of the<br />
greatest man of our time. I was very impressed by a number of<br />
matters associated with it. For example, his body lay in state<br />
itn Westminster Hall, Westminster Hall is the most famous building<br />
: tn our history. It is very old. It was built by V. illiam Rufus.<br />
Dark, sombre, full of history. And there, on a little dais, lay<br />
the coffin with its custodians in uniform; and along two lines<br />
through the Hall there came the citizens of London, young and old,<br />
thousand after thousand, paying their homage.<br />
I had wondered very much myself whether this great<br />
man, who was at the peak of his greatness more than twenty years<br />
ago, might be forgotten by younger people' I knew that grey-headed<br />
people like myself' would never forget him;, particularly those who<br />
like myself were fortunate enough to know him and to know him<br />
well, For us, it would be impossible to forget him. But I thought<br />
that those who were children in the greatest moments of his glory<br />
might now regard him as a remote historic figure of no more<br />
particular interest than other historic figures in the schoolbooks.<br />
I was delightfully pleased to see that a good half<br />
of all those who came through were young, exhibiting every possible<br />
mixture from those who looked quite usual to boys with long hair<br />
and girls with short hair, They all came through solemnly, with<br />
respect. It was a most amazing tribute and it confirmed in my<br />
mind the belief which I have always entertained that one of the<br />
great things in our character is a sense of continuity, that we<br />
are not here today and gone tomorrow that we have had people<br />
before us and we will have people af~ er us; we being influenced<br />
by those before us, and influencing those who come after us.. This<br />
is the continuing city in reality that is referred to in tho Bible<br />
and it is a great characteristic particularly of our own people, and<br />
there it was that day just as iz was a few days later in St. Paul's<br />
Cathedral where the view, the picture, was unforgettable the<br />
Queen there attending the funeral of her great Prime Minister,<br />
Now I said just now that I knew him well. I d~ d<br />
indeed. I was greatly privileged, and many weekends I havevspent<br />
in his house and had many great matters to discuss with him from<br />
time to time. I always remember with a sort of sombre pride that<br />
on two occasions I disagreed with him &amp; id I assure you, my friends,<br />
that took doing, because he was, of all men, the most formidable.<br />
But one night he said to me at the dinner-table something that I<br />
know he said elsewhere and which I know has now become familiar<br />
in the books. We were talking about war because this was a time<br />
of war. It was on every night, every day. And he gave me his<br />
great slogan-In War, Fury<br />
In Defeat, Defiance<br />
In Victory Magnanimity<br />
In Peace, 6oodwill. 9 / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
It's easy enough to say those words but they really<br />
stood for what he believed in. Time after time in my experience<br />
of him, when we were discussing some problem or other I would say,<br />
" Don't you feel that such-and-such might be done" ani his answer<br />
would be, " No. That couldn't be done. It couldn~ t be done because<br />
of the nature of man." 1 And it is about that great element, the<br />
nature of man, that I just want to say a little to you this<br />
morning because we must never become so pessimistic, we must never<br />
become so sceptical of human virtue, as to become cynical about<br />
it. We must remember that there is something immortal in the<br />
nature of man. It is a continuing thing, It is indeed a<br />
continuing city in the heart and mind of man. The nature of man.<br />
Now, it has been proved if I may start with a<br />
practical example or two that we are not, in our race, very<br />
great haters, In War, Fury. Yes, but you remember, not in<br />
Peace, Hatred. In Peace Goodwill. Yesterday's enemy becomes<br />
tomorrow's friend time alter time in the course of our history.<br />
After all, after the Napoleonic wars, as the boys and girls will<br />
reriem be r, Ithe French and the British were not what you might<br />
describe as great friends. There had been a generation of war<br />
between them, bitter wounds and bitter defeats and the want of<br />
friendship, no doubt endured a long time. AMA yet in this<br />
century France has Uen our ally and remains our aily in the<br />
North Atlantic Treaty. These things are forgotten, merciftQlly<br />
forgotten, because if we lived on our enmities for the rest of<br />
our lives, we would die the most miserable of people. It is in<br />
the nature of man not to nurture hatreds and not to live on their<br />
memory. You know, Sir, I don't want to invade the field of<br />
theology of which you are a master but the old observation~ that<br />
God made man in His own image has, f think been rather misunderstood<br />
by some people, at least who appear to think of it in terms' of a<br />
human image, a human body, a human appearance, and so we in the<br />
old pictures that we used to look at when we were in Sunlay<br />
School we rather saw imaginary pictures of God as a man. This<br />
doesn' follow at all. When God made man in His own image, He<br />
wasn't creating something necessarily that had a physical<br />
resemblance to Him. He was creating something that had the<br />
God-like elements in the spirit and in the character. This is<br />
it, If we are in His image, it is because we have within<br />
us a capacity for rising to great heights of pure virtue, side by<br />
side with a capacity for sinking to the lowest level of selfishness<br />
and bitterness; but these God-like elements in the human<br />
character, sometimes twisted sometimes ignored, I believe<br />
survive and blossom and deveiop as life goes on. One has only<br />
to consider at a time like this the immense sacrifices that<br />
people have made, the highest sacrifices. This capacity for<br />
sacrifice, this capacity for preferring other people to oneself,<br />
this capacity for sayn, " 1I will contribute all if it is for<br />
the good of the country, exhibited so frequently in war is a<br />
God-like quality. The capacity for sacrifice. the whole idea<br />
of sacrifice is at the very root of the Christian faith.<br />
Man's incapacity for enduring hatred, I've said<br />
something about. I believe that it is one of the great elements<br />
in the nature of man, I think indeed, that all the time we<br />
are with checks sometimes wi~ h what appear to be a full stop<br />
that we are proceeding along the path of civilisation so that<br />
one day we will be able to say I won't perhaps, you won't<br />
perhaps, somebody will that we are a fully civilised nation. a / 3 </p>
<p>73<br />
Now that brings me to the next little thing I wanted<br />
to mention to you, We talk rather glibly, don't we, about Wiestern<br />
civilisation or ancient civilisation or Oriental civilisation.<br />
We take great pride in the fact that in this century, the most<br />
' tremendous scientific marvels have occurred, not only in pure<br />
science but in appl~ ied science in the technological field,<br />
marvels have been brought aboui. Some of the young boys here<br />
this morning might'be fascinated to know that I saw the first<br />
motor car ever to come into our part of the State, and it wasn't<br />
a motor car as we now understand it, It was a monstrosity called<br />
a motor buggy. It looked like a buggy, and it was driven very<br />
precariously with a sort of one-lung engine. That was among the<br />
early motor vehicles in Australia, This is in my owm time, and<br />
today there are so many motor vehicles on the roads that all those<br />
who rule over us are tearing their hair~ almost literally to know<br />
how they can cope with them, This is one of the marvels of<br />
technical civilisation, I remember seeing for the first time in my life a<br />
moving picture, a movie, It was out of doors, Nobody would have<br />
thought of building a picture theatre in those days, and I remember<br />
the picture vividly, it jerked like that all the time and it was<br />
called " The Great American Train Robbery", ( Laughter3 Well, that<br />
is only fifty-eight years ago and today we have talking pictures,<br />
we have the marvels of radio, we have the marvels of television,<br />
we fly through the air, I can be in four States in four days,<br />
unhappily to make four speeches ( Laughter) because of the miracles<br />
of flight. And all this has made us rather pleased with oiirselves,<br />
hasntt it this half-century of enormous progress in the scientific<br />
and technical fields,<br />
Yet in this same century we have had two great warswe<br />
have had some of the geatest outpouring of brutality and haired<br />
in the history of man. Any body who wanted to sit in judgment on<br />
this century in respect of non-technical matters might well say<br />
that this was one of the most uncivilised centuries in modern<br />
ftistory, Well, I don't want to go so far as to say that. That<br />
would be extravagant because these wars have had their compensating<br />
elements because of the nature of man, but I do want to remind you<br />
And to remind myself' that civilisation has very little to do with<br />
aircraft or radios or transistors or television sets, Civilisation<br />
is in the heart and in the mind and those two elements will make<br />
us civilised and the century a civilised one.<br />
Sir, one other thing I would like to say to you is<br />
this. We are a little inclined, aren't we, to make rather quick<br />
moral judgments about the conduct of other people. One sees this<br />
constantly in politics. In fact I don't mind admitting on my<br />
behalf if not on behalf of Mr. Chipp that it is a constant<br />
temptaiion and one that has to be resisted these quick moral<br />
judgments on what other people are doing and are doing in good<br />
faith. I had occasion to think about this recently, because I<br />
have been talking to you about the nature of man and my poon<br />
belief that as time goes on, with all its checks, the nature of<br />
man grows stronger and better. This is the path of civilisation,<br />
But recently, for example, I have been hearing<br />
criticisms of the United States for intervening in a countr'y<br />
called Vietnam. Very easy to be critical about what a great<br />
country like the United States does. I venture to say that what<br />
the United States is doing and the responsibility it is accepting<br />
for the good of all of us is one of the greatest manifestations<br />
of the nature of man, a very great piece of moral responsibility,<br />
And you have only to ask yourselves the simplest of questions:<br />
Why do you suppose that the United States, living in its own 00 0// </p>
<p>,4 oontinent, the richest country in the world, the strongest<br />
country in the world, why do you suppose it is engaging itsofinalittLe<br />
piece of land in the South E~ ast of Asia and sending its men into it<br />
and losing men there and spending vast sums and producing vast stores<br />
of equipment? Why do you suppose they are doing it?<br />
I hope I won't have anybody suppose that they are doing<br />
it because they want to make South Vietnam an American colony&amp;<br />
That would be too silly for words. That would be, in the homely<br />
phr~ ase, buying trouble. I don't think any of us would want to,<br />
have one of these countries as a colony. Of course not. Is it<br />
because the Americans have enormous financial interests in that<br />
colony? I venture to think they have practically none, Then why<br />
are they doing it? Why are they, with all the temptations in the<br />
world to be isolationists to say, " Well, we will protect our own<br />
interest. We have the wide seas on each side of us" l; why do they<br />
send their men and their equipment thousands of miles away across<br />
the sea? The answer to me is perfectly irresistible, They are<br />
doing it because they believe that what is at issue is human<br />
freedom and they believe that human freedom ought to be defended<br />
wherever it is challenged and that they, as the greatest power in<br />
the world, should accept the greatest responsibility for it.<br />
This is in reality, a tremendous piece of altruism on their part.<br />
It involves a recognition that world power must be met by world<br />
responsibility and that what they believe in and what we believe<br />
in should be defended against attack. This is the greatest<br />
exhibition of this kind that we have seen since Great Britain<br />
stood alone in the last war.<br />
It couldn't have happened, I think, fifty years ago,<br />
sixty years ago when Americans were a bit inclined to say " We're<br />
here, We will look after ourselves. Wde are not concerned about<br />
the world." They are concerned about the world today. A very<br />
good thing for us that they are and a very good thing for the<br />
world that there should be a great power which makes it quite<br />
clear that it is not moved by individual selfishness or a narrow<br />
cultivation of its own national position but is moved by a feeling<br />
that it is its brother's keeper. This is the last, and I think,<br />
magnificent example of the nature of man.<br />
And so, Sir, I end as I began. I can't think of<br />
Winston Churchill without thinking of what he has said to me about<br />
the nature of man. There are certain things that can't be done<br />
or that certainly can't be done in the long run because in this<br />
fashion, in this pervasive fashion, God has created us in his<br />
own image, </p>
