CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PACIFIC BASIN ECONOMIC COUNCIL<br />
SYDNEY 25 MAY 1988<br />
It is always a pleasure to address groups of Ajxstralians or<br />
visitors to this country who are involved in advancing the<br />
interests of the Pacific Basin economies.<br />
Because for Australia it is in the Pacific Basin that our<br />
future lies.<br />
At the outset let me stress here as I have in many forums<br />
that Australians are determined to meet the challenge, and<br />
grasp the opportunities, that our involvement in this region<br />
presents to us.<br />
I recall speaking to the national meeting of this is Council<br />
four years ago in Sydney. On that occasion, having just<br />
returned from a visit to North-East and South-East Asia, I<br />
was able to outline ways in which Australia could become<br />
more integrated with the economies in that region.<br />
More recently, last November, I had the honour of delivering<br />
the 1987 Singapore lecture in which I outlined my views<br />
about the prospects and the challenges for the Asia Pacific<br />
region.<br />
So I was determined even though I can only spend a very<br />
short time with you today to accept your invitation to<br />
address-this conference and to return to those important<br />
themes. It is now somewhat commonplace to marvel at what one might<br />
call the Pacific miracle or to express wonderment about the<br />
so-called Pacific Century we are about to enter. The<br />
reconstruction of Japan after World War II; the emergence of<br />
the so called four tigers; the growing-* confidence of the<br />
ASEAN countries; and the reawakening of the potential giant<br />
of the region, China, are all powerful sources of optimism<br />
for the future of the region.<br />
Without doubt the past twenty years have been vibrant and<br />
exciting ones in this region. Economic progress here has<br />
outstripped that of the rest of the world. 0 06; 9 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
To quote just one statistic: twenty years ago the region's<br />
GDP was equivalent to one-third of US GDP. Today it s over<br />
two thirds.. of what is of course,. a much larger *. US economy.<br />
Performance like that has not happened by accident.<br />
For the most successful countries, it has been the result of<br />
deliberate, determined, outward-looking domestic policies,<br />
extraordinary economic adaptability and a sftpathetic<br />
trading environment.<br />
The result has been heavy emphasis on exporting, both within<br />
the region and to the more traditional markets of Europe.<br />
It is no wonder, then, that the locus of world trade is<br />
shifting from the Atlantic to the Pacific.<br />
I have made no secret of the optimism with which I<br />
contemplate the future of this region.<br />
The Pacific economies have repeatedly demonsgtrated in the<br />
past the commitment and the flexibility they needed to gain<br />
the most from an export oriented strategy and to take<br />
advantage of the changing opportunities for growth through<br />
trade. For example, in the wake of the slowdown in world growth in<br />
1985, sharp policy adjustments were necessary in a number of<br />
Pacific economies, including Australia-<br />
Commodity exporting countries like Australia proved<br />
especially vulnerable as growth in world trade slowed to<br />
3 per cent in 1985 from the rate of nine per cent in 1984.<br />
Their export volumes fell as a consequence of falling demand<br />
for their raw materials, and their terms of trade<br />
deteriorated dramatically.<br />
What has been encouraging about the response of the Pacific<br />
nations including Australia has been their decision to<br />
pursue growth even more vigorously and adapt their<br />
macroeconomic, trade and industry policies to match the new<br />
economic conditions.<br />
By contrast, the response of some of the main European<br />
countries to the economic slowdown and their general<br />
reaction to the success enjoyed by developing countries had<br />
in penetrating their markets was to turn inwards. They<br />
resorted to a combination of increased protectionism and<br />
inappropriate domestic policies with the result that smooth<br />
global industrial adjustment was obstructed..<br />
I have taken the opportunity in many forums to point out the<br />
essential shortsightednes of those responses.<br />
Closing down world trade would spell death to rapid economic<br />
progress. It would not safeguard but would jeopardise<br />
domestic industry and jobs.. 00) 6 1 9 3 </p>
<p>And where the major etonomies have ignored the need to<br />
realign their fiscal policies to the changing patterns of<br />
world balance of payments imbalances they have simply<br />
accentuated the difficulties of adjustment.<br />
Japan, the United States and the major European economies<br />
have particular roles to play in reversing this trend.<br />
These are well known and I will not rehearse them here,<br />
other than to state that their task requires nothing less<br />
than fundamental reform of their approaches to economic<br />
policy making and to protection policy.<br />
What I want to stress here is that the task involves not<br />
just the majors.<br />
All countries particularly those in this region that have<br />
benefited so much from open trading policies in the past<br />
need to keep their own domestic, trade and exchange rate<br />
policies under constant review.<br />
The price of success is the obligation to coopet~ te fully in<br />
the task of keeping world trade and financial flows as * open<br />
as possible.<br />
Although it is easy and no doubt comfortable to extrapolate<br />
the successes of the past to the future, and to conclude<br />
that all is right with the region, I believe it would be<br />
shortsighted not to pause and reflect whethier this is truly<br />
SO. For all the rhetoric about the dawning of the Pacific age we<br />
still need to be sure that we have the conditions in place<br />
that will allow such a vision to be realised.<br />
As I said in my Singapore lecture last year,<br />
" before we start counting the rewards that will flow to<br />
us in the Pacific Century, our task must be to ensure<br />
that the prediction actually comes true.<br />
" The fact that things have gone so well for us in the<br />
recent past does not mean they will continue to go<br />
well."<br />
remain confident that the optimistic predictions can be<br />
achieved. But I believe we have more to do before we-can<br />
actually participate in and reap the benefits of the Pacific<br />
Century. Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
The reality is that once again we are entering a period of<br />
fundamental changes to the countries of the region.<br />
The Pacific Basin has already demonstrated it is well<br />
equipped to deal with change. 0 06 ( 39 4 </p>
<p>Now however new avenues for complementary economic<br />
development are opening up. The challenge is to ensure<br />
those opportunities are exploited to the full.<br />
Before coming to the areas in which I think more needs to be<br />
done let me first mention the hopeful signs that the task is<br />
already being addressed.<br />
Japan has embarked on a program of restructuring. The<br />
sharply higher yen and the redirection of Japanese economic<br />
policy towards the stimulation of domestic demand has<br />
shifted the primary engine of growth away from net exports.<br />
Indeed economic growth in Japan is now based entirely on<br />
domestic demand, with the external sector making a negative<br />
contribution to real growth in the order of one per cent in<br />
1987.<br />
As part of this restructuring process, Japan iV shifting<br />
into higher technology products, creating anotj) Ier round of<br />
market opportunities for newly industrialised producers of<br />
medium technology items especially those located in the<br />
region.<br />
This in turn has opened new opportunities for some of the<br />
less developed countries in the region, including some ASEAN<br />
nations and the People's Republic of China. They have the<br />
challenge now to move into export areas ini which the Newly<br />
Industrialising Countries generally enjoyed a comparative<br />
advantage previously.<br />
Japan's accumulating wealth is also leading to increased<br />
foreign investment.<br />
1986 saw a 225 per cent increase in the flow of investment<br />
funds from Japan to South Korea, a 155 per cent increase to<br />
Taiwan and a 158 per cent increase to Thailand.<br />
Similarly the Newly Industrialising Countries have begun to<br />
invest abroad, reflecting their improving balance of<br />
payments positions and shifts in the pattern of comparative<br />
advantage. For example Taiwan has continued to expand its involvement<br />
in the Philippines-in the garment industry and in light<br />
manufacturing enterprises two areas in which they formerly<br />
enjoyed a competitive edge but which have grown rapidly in<br />
the Philippines.<br />
The extraordinary growth path of the Chinese economy, at a<br />
seemingly indefinite rate of 7 to 8 per cent a year,<br />
combined with China's emphasis on open growth strategies<br />
present the region with vast scope for increasing trade and<br />
investment links with China.<br />
Australia attaches a high priority to its relations with<br />
China. Since Premier Zhao Ziyang's visit to Australia in<br />
1983, the first by a Chinese he~ id of government, our<br />
economic links with China have flourished. </p>
<p>In 1986-87 two-way trade exceeded $ 2 billion, making China<br />
our fourth largest trading partner. Direct foreign<br />
investment by Australian firms in China is estimated to be<br />
$ A210 million. China's two largest foreign investment<br />
projects are located in Australia the Mt Channar iron-ore<br />
project and Portland aluminium smelter.<br />
Last month Chinese and Australian officials concluded an<br />
Investment Protection Agreement and we are also making<br />
progress towards a Double Taxation Agreement. These will<br />
make an important contribution to strengthening what is<br />
already a healthy investment relationship.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
These developments inspire a degree of optimism for the<br />
future of the region. They are developments, too, which<br />
present challenges and opportunities for Australia.<br />
Australia is determined to play its part in the growth of<br />
the region and to derive the maximum possible*' 1Benefit from<br />
the emerging opportunities.<br />
For this purpose, I have decided to commission a major<br />
report of prospective economic developments in East Asia and<br />
their implications for Australia. It will be prepared by<br />
our former Ambassador to China, Dr Ross Garnaut. I expect<br />
that the results will be available to th6 Government in<br />
about a year.<br />
But more broadly, we are deeply concerned about the<br />
restrictions that would be placed on our collective economic<br />
prospects by an upsurge in unfair trade practices.<br />
Australia has had cause on a number of occasions to voice<br />
our concerns that access to markets be based on free and<br />
fair competition.<br />
Both within the Pacific Basin and more generally we seek<br />
more assured access for, in particular, our beef, iron ore<br />
and coal.<br />
Indeed only yesterday I found it necessary to write to<br />
Prime Minister Takeshita to express our concern about the<br />
admission by a senior member of the Japanese ruling party<br />
that administrative guidance has been used to treat American<br />
beef favourably, at Australia's expense.<br />
The beef market, like others, needs to be based on<br />
non-discriminatory access.<br />
We will continue to press such concerns both regionally<br />
and in wider forums such as the GATT.<br />
The task is urgent because the losses from delay are so<br />
large. </p>
<p>Put mdst simply, we need increasingly to be sure that<br />
investment and production decisions are based on a correct<br />
set of market signals not ones so distorted by artificial<br />
barriers and supports as to be meaningless.<br />
Australia and the world has paid a high and well documented<br />
price for the corruption of the markets for agricultural<br />
products. The cost of administering programs of agricultural support<br />
in the European Community, US and Japan alone was estimated<br />
by the OECD to be $ US200 billion a year in the period<br />
1984-86.<br />
And that overlooks the more general economic and social<br />
losses incurred by efficient producer countries when they<br />
are denied adequate returns because of depressed prices and<br />
lost markets.<br />
Neither we nor our region can afford to repeat tihat sorry<br />
example in other areas of trade.<br />
However there is a prior and larger point.<br />
A free trading system requires management policies which<br />
reflect underlying economic fundamentals in exchange rates.<br />
Unless this most important of prices is capable of<br />
responding to changes in fundamentals the incentives for<br />
producers to respond to changing patterns of comparative<br />
advantage are muted indeed.<br />
We must recognise it is equally unacceptable in a free<br />
trading system to allow a long-term under-valuation of one's<br />
currency as it is to maintain high tariffs or other trade<br />
barriers to agricultural or manufactured goods.<br />
At the same time, the countries of the region cannot demand<br />
freer trade in goods without also accepting freer trade in<br />
services. Certainly this is a relatively new area for<br />
negotiation but it is one we must face. Those countries<br />
with reservations in this area should reflect on the<br />
opportunities that freer trade in goods has provided, before<br />
they close their minds to freer trade in services.<br />
Australia recognises that the advantages of liberalised.<br />
trade and appropriate exchange rate management policies flow<br />
not just to the region or the global economy as a whole, but<br />
ultimately, to ourselves.<br />
Accordingly we have already put in place massive reforms to<br />
open up our economy to the energising impact of trade.<br />
Tonight Paul Keating, John Button, and John Kerin will take<br />
that process further.<br />
They will be announ * cing the most far reaching decisions ever<br />
taken to reform Australia's industry assistance policies. 69 7 </p>
<p>Australia is taking the task of economic reconstruction<br />
seriously. We are doing so because we recognise the value<br />
to us of export-oriented growth and because we recognise<br />
that to participate in that game requires greater<br />
flexibility and adaptability. Our outdated regimes of<br />
industry assistance were simply incapable of delivering<br />
that. Put simply, I believe our trading partners should apply<br />
similar remedies because the short term costs they impose<br />
are ultimately outweighed by the benefits derived from a<br />
more innovative, more flexible industrial structure.<br />
That has been the experience of this dynamically growing<br />
region in the past.<br />
It is up to us including to the members of the Pacific<br />
Basin Economic Council to ensure that it remains the<br />
hallmark of our relationship in the future. 0 </p>
