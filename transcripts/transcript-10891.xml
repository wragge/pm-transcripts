<p>Well thank you very Mr Morris. To Mr Turner, To Heather Thurland,</p>
<p>   to my Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentleman. Can I particularly</p>
<p>   acknowledge Heather's involvement in today's event. We're</p>
<p>   very proud of your sporting achievements. I think we're equally</p>
<p>   proud of the fact that you have so willingly associated yourself</p>
<p>   with an organisation which is synonymous with looking after the</p>
<p>   less fortunate in the Australian community. And I would have thought</p>
<p>   that you spoke for the mothers and fathers of all children in Australia</p>
<p>   when you said that there would be nothing worse for a parent, mother</p>
<p>   or father, to feel that they could not provide for their children,</p>
<p>   particularly at Christmas time. And that of course is what this</p>
<p>   great organisation is about and I'm delighted to be here today</p>
<p>   to formally launch the Christmas appeal of the Smith Family.</p>
<p>The Smith Family is one of the great volunteer organisations of</p>
<p>   Australia. It's an organisation that from the earliest of my</p>
<p>   recollections of Christmas I associated with helping people who</p>
<p>   needed help at Christmas time. You think of the Christmas story</p>
<p>   in the Bible, you think of the things associated with Christmas,</p>
<p>   and Santa Claus, and then in a sense you started thinking of organisations</p>
<p>   like the Smith Family and the Salvation Army. And it has played</p>
<p>   a part in my own recollection of Christmas from my very earliest</p>
<p>   days. </p>
<p>I had an interesting experience last week at ACOSS when I made</p>
<p>   some remarks about the respective role in our society of the government,</p>
<p>   the welfare sector, the business community and individuals and I've</p>
<p>   been quite interested, indeed fascinated, to examine some of the</p>
<p>   response to those remarks that I made and I'm very glad that</p>
<p>   I made those remarks because they did begin to generate a debate</p>
<p>   within the community about the contribution that all of us must</p>
<p>   make to looking after the less fortunate amongst the Australian</p>
<p>   community. </p>
<p>Those remarks were not designed to be critical of the many business</p>
<p>   men and women, and a number of them are here today, who over the</p>
<p>   years have given unstintingly of their own personal resources and</p>
<p>   also of their time and professional skill to help great charitable</p>
<p>   organisations. But they were designed to indicate that there are</p>
<p>   some in the business community that don't necessarily match</p>
<p>   the example of others. </p>
<p>They were also designed to make the point that helping the needy</p>
<p>   and the less fortunate in Australian society must be a partnership.</p>
<p>   We as a government do not expect the burden to be shifted to the</p>
<p>   welfare sector or to the business community. We recognise that whoever</p>
<p>   is in government there is an ongoing role for the government on</p>
<p>   behalf of the community to support organisations and to help organisations</p>
<p>   like the Smith Family. </p>
<p>That is one of the reasons why there has been a very big increase</p>
<p>   in the amount of emergency relief provided by the Federal Government</p>
<p>   to organisations like the Smith Family over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>   And I'm very proud of the fact that despite budget cutbacks</p>
<p>   in other areas we were able to dramatically increase the amount</p>
<p>   of emergency relief to the different welfare organisations in the</p>
<p>   Australian community. And for example, last year some $1 million</p>
<p>   was provided out of that emergency relief fund for the Smith Family</p>
<p>   alone.</p>
<p>But the point I sought to make was that it is a partnership. We</p>
<p>   as a government have a role, the business community has a role,</p>
<p>   individuals have a role and the volunteer sector of welfare in this</p>
<p>   community has a very important role as well. And we can only achieve</p>
<p>   the goals we set ourselves, and we can only help in the most practical</p>
<p>   way possible if we work together. It's not a question of us</p>
<p>   saying it's your responsibility now. That is not the point.</p>
<p>   It is a collective partnership. One where the Government plays a</p>
<p>   very important role but recognising that it can't do it all</p>
<p>   on its own because it doesn't have the expertise. </p>
<p>There is nothing quite like an organisation which is steeped in</p>
<p>   the spirit of volunteerism to provide compassionate care for the</p>
<p>   less fortunate within our community. That extra special commitment</p>
<p>   that is born of a personal desire to help somebody and to help a</p>
<p>   cause is quite irreplaceable. You can't buy it with money,</p>
<p>   you can't supplement it with paid help although professional</p>
<p>   welfare workers are a very important part of the network. </p>
<p>But there is something special like an organisation as such as</p>
<p>   the Smith Family and that is why I'm particularly pleased on</p>
<p>   behalf of the Government to be associated with it, to commend its</p>
<p>   efforts since 1922 when it was formed, to applaud it for its commitment</p>
<p>   particularly at Christmas time to ensuring that no children in Australia,</p>
<p>   to the extent that that is possible, go without care and go without</p>
<p>   assistance and go without sharing the joy of Christmas along with</p>
<p>   the many more fortunate children within our community who don't</p>
<p>   need any kind of assistance. </p>
<p>So I'm very pleased to launch this appeal. I'm very pleased</p>
<p>   to announce a contribution of $5,000 from the Federal Government</p>
<p>   towards the Christmas appeal. I want to salute the work of the Smith</p>
<p>   Family. I want to thank it for what it has done to relieve the hardship</p>
<p>   of so many children and families generally throughout the Australian</p>
<p>   community. I want to thank the many men and women in business who've</p>
<p>   helped it. I want to endorse and emphasise again the importance</p>
<p>   I stressed last week of a partnership between the Government, the</p>
<p>   community, individuals, and business to ensure that we have a world</p>
<p>   class sensitive welfare sector in Australia, a peculiarly Australian</p>
<p>   model may I say of providing welfare in this country. One that we</p>
<p>   don't seek to copy from any other country. One that has been</p>
<p>   particularly fashioned to suit the needs of the Australian community.</p>
<p>   And a great streak of that is the volunteerism that is within so</p>
<p>   many of us in which gave birth to the Smith Family and has sustained</p>
<p>   it ever since it was formed back in 1922. </p>
<p>I thank all of you. I particularly thank the leaders of the Smith</p>
<p>   Family for the work they do. I compliment them on behalf of the</p>
<p>   Government. I wish the appeal well. I hope it is widely and generously</p>
<p>   supported by the Australian community. Thank you.</p>
