a 0 " THE JOB AHEAD OF US IN ASIA"<br />
Extracts from Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt,<br />
at Opening of M. R. A. Conference, Monash University, Melbourne<br />
6th January, 1967.<br />
One of the reasons I was attracted to speak to you<br />
today was the theme of your Conference " It's Our Job Australia".<br />
I share your view that the job ahead for us in world affairs<br />
and particularly in the affairs of this region in which we<br />
live is not only tremendously important but for Australia it<br />
is a challenge of comparatively recent emergence.<br />
Three-fifths of the population of the world live East<br />
of Suez and as I've said when I've been travelling overseas,<br />
we can't turn our backs, nor can Europe turn its back, upon<br />
the problems of the people who live in Asia. What was our<br />
Far East in the literature of my early time in public life<br />
has become very much the Near I'orth oT this country.<br />
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<br />
I would like to tell you something, since we are<br />
speaking of our responsibilities internationally, of the way<br />
in which Australia has grown both in influence and action in<br />
this field. For a very long time in the history of our<br />
Federation external relationships had a very limited interest<br />
to the Parliament. It was hard to Let the Parliament to accept<br />
a debate on external matters. You ad some industrial issue<br />
that the whole Parliament would be wanting to speak on, some<br />
domestic industrial issue the arbitration system, the social<br />
services and matters of that kind. In my earlier years in<br />
the Parliament it was a rarity to have a debate on foreign<br />
affairs. Now there is no more popular vehicle for Parliamentary<br />
speech at the present time than a debate on foreign affairs.<br />
In the earliest period we looked to the United Kingdom.<br />
The people who quip me because they say I am all the way with<br />
America, at that time were quipping the Government of the day<br />
because they said we were cIinging to the skirts of Downing<br />
Street if Downing Street could have skirts. You follow<br />
the idea. And people, for their own political purposes,<br />
choose to take a statement made in one context and apply it<br />
far more generally and widely than the facts would justify.<br />
I don't think when Andrew Fisher saidito the last man and<br />
the last shilling", that people interpreted that as meaning<br />
that Australia had surrendered any independence of judgment<br />
and action that it might otherwise possess. And when I say<br />
that we are all the way with America in resisting aggression<br />
in Vietnam, that doesn't im ly that we don't have an independent<br />
mind and judgment on some o these great international questions.<br />
I don't think, if you were to searcA his heart on the matter,<br />
there is one of my political opponents in the National<br />
Parliament who seriously believes that Australia has surrendered </p>
<p>2<br />
that independence which a government should possess.<br />
You may be interested to know just how the Australian<br />
activity has grown. In 1901 the Department of External Affairs<br />
was established as one of the original Departments of State;<br />
but there was so little interest in this work in the Parliament<br />
that by 1916 the Department had been abolished. And the function<br />
of the Department was taken over by the Prime Minister. Would<br />
I be correct in thinking it was William Morris Hughes at that<br />
time? He took over most of the functions of that period.<br />
He was said to have ruled Australia with his pen. Jell, as<br />
far as he was concerned, what little there was for External<br />
Affairs to do was going to be done inside his own Department.<br />
And it wasn't until 1935 that it was re-established as a<br />
separate Department of Jovernment. I could give you the<br />
figures on staff which I think are quite revealing, and I<br />
am not going back to the early years of Federation. 3ut in<br />
June, 1946 we had a total staff" in the External Affairs<br />
Deuartment, including those overseas and those in Australia<br />
and certain people locally engaged in quite minor positions<br />
410. By June 1966 twenty years later the 410 had grown<br />
to 1,570. So that you will see that Australia's growing interest<br />
was reflected in the growth of the Department of External Affairs.<br />
When I examined the table on this I thought it might<br />
be of some interest to you. I was glad to find that when<br />
you look at the geographical spread of these posts the largest<br />
number is to be found in Asia and South Asia. There are 19<br />
there 18 in Europe, 7 in North and South America, 7 in Africa,<br />
3 in the South Pacific; and in addition to those diplomatic<br />
Dosts we have trade posts growing, too, quite steadily around<br />
the world, and there are some separate immigration posts which<br />
help us with that programme.<br />
REVOLUTION OF RISING EXPECTATIONS<br />
Now what makes the task in Asia, and indeed in the<br />
under-developed world generally, so exciting at this time is,<br />
if I may quote the words of Arnold Toynbee, well expressed<br />
in this passage. " Our age will be remembered not for its<br />
terrifying crimes or its astonishing inventions, but because<br />
it is the first generation in history in which mankind dared<br />
to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization<br />
available to the whole human race." And that is not just a<br />
belief held by the more affluent countries, what are inown<br />
in the jargon of the day as the developed countries, by which<br />
we usually mean the highly industrialized countries, but it<br />
is certainly held amongst those countries which are learning<br />
for the first time in history that mankind's age-old enemies<br />
of sickness, disease, illiterac poverty, the lack of<br />
adequate shelter, hunger, that these things can be conquered,<br />
that other countries have conquered them and are going on<br />
to even higher standards.<br />
So there has built up what has been aptly described<br />
as the revolution of rising expectations. And the expectations<br />
are certainly there, and they are complicating international<br />
life tremendously because it is one thing to stage a revolution </p>
<p>-3-<br />
for your reed6m, to establish a separate national entity;<br />
but-it-is a-veVy much more difficult thing to go about te<br />
more mundane an-humdrum task of supplying the needs of your<br />
people. We are-seein' this all around the under-developed<br />
world at this time, whether it is in Africa, in Asia, or some<br />
other part of the globe, that the victory has been won by the<br />
politician. He has secured his freedom, he has secured his<br />
independence. He has a nation to lead. But the people in<br />
that nation are able, through the various modern communications<br />
inedia to see the more affluent and well-supplied<br />
world around them and they want these things. They don't want<br />
them as the end product, as is the case in most of the<br />
developed countries, of centuries of politic al and industrial<br />
evolution. They want them preferably in the next year and<br />
certainly in the next five or ten years. Because it is<br />
humanly impossible to do all these things in that time, the<br />
discontents build up and these discontents provide the<br />
infection for disorder, for challenge, and a threat to the<br />
more stable and orderly forms of society which otherwise<br />
could be maintained in the country concerned. This is part<br />
of the challenge which all of us have to face because we<br />
must recognize the needs, we must recognize tAe consciousness<br />
which exists on the part of the under-supplied people that<br />
their needs can be met, or at least they hope, as Toynbee<br />
says, for the first time in history people dare to hope the<br />
things which they have accepted philosophically perhaps or<br />
with despair in centuries past, that these things are capable<br />
of solution, and there are men, statesmen around the world,<br />
who believe that also in countries which can make a major<br />
contribution. The present President of the United States is<br />
one such man who has a vision, not only of a good society at<br />
home, but a vision of a better world order around the world<br />
as a whole, and is prepared to contribute the wealth, the<br />
technical skill, the co-operation, the assistance of this<br />
country of 190 odd million people to assisting in those tasks.<br />
This year has seen, I believe, a notable progress forward in<br />
the thinking of the people of the United States, and certainly<br />
of the United States administration, in relation to the<br />
possibilities which exist in Asia..<br />
AUSTRALIA'S INFLUENCE<br />
Now Australia, you say there is a job ahead of us and<br />
that might seem on the face of it to be rather large a claim<br />
for a comparatively small country measured in terms of<br />
population to make. but there is force in this, because<br />
Providence has placed Australia in a situation where it can<br />
exercise an influence out of all relationship to the numbers<br />
of our people. In the first place there's our historic<br />
relationship with the United Kingdom. Virtually a family<br />
relationship, and when I go to conferences in London, as my<br />
predecessor and leaders of governments from Australia of<br />
other political persuasions, we are greeted as members of the<br />
same family, and that's the atmosphere in the United Kingdom.<br />
They have always been interested to hear what we've<br />
had to say willing to take our views into their own<br />
consideration, and it was typical that although I was a </p>
<p>4<br />
fledgljng Prime-Minister-when Sir Robert retired, in the<br />
first wee4 of my own administration I had personal letters,<br />
or messages,-from Harold Wilson and from President Johnson<br />
asking me to continue the same intimate correspondence that<br />
they had developed with Sir Robert Menzies. Now this doesn't<br />
happen to every country. It happens to this country because<br />
our views are respected. ie are known as people who express<br />
ourselves quite robustly at times, but sincerely and with a<br />
desire to help. And so we do have some influence on the<br />
thinking of these two great powers, more influence I believe<br />
even in my limited experience of just under twelve months,<br />
than most Australians would imagine.<br />
Then there are other reasons why we have a capacity<br />
for influence in the region of Asia. ' e don't carry any<br />
background of colonial power past. I think it's true that<br />
leaders in these countries speak more frankly and freely to<br />
us than they do to the representatives of -' reter powers.<br />
They know that we have no territorial ambitions so far as<br />
they are concerned. We have no aspiration to exploit their<br />
wealth, although the charge on this, I think has been grossly<br />
exaggerated over the years. But we have, and this again is<br />
a bond of sympathy with us, problems of a development kind<br />
which they face themselves and fortunately for us we've shown<br />
a capacity to meet those problems successfully, to build<br />
in a not highly Promising terrain and climate a civilisation<br />
and a standard of living which ranks amongst the highest to<br />
be found around the world. They want to know how we've done<br />
it. They are glad to have from us some indication of the way<br />
we go about things. They welcome the technical assistance<br />
that we can bring to them.<br />
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES<br />
There are at present somewhere in the neighbourhood<br />
of 15 000 students from the Asian region studying in Australia.<br />
Some 10% of the full-time students enrolled in our universities<br />
are from overseas. Over the past few years, some 50 000<br />
students from Asia have passed through our various eaucational<br />
establishments and they can become, as so many of them do,<br />
good ambassadors for Australia.<br />
Perhaps our most enduring gift to Asia is in the<br />
education opportunities we offer. Asia desperately needs<br />
skilled tradesmen and technicians and better educated farmers<br />
as well as graduates. Blue-collar work does not have the respect<br />
it enjoys in Western countries and training in manipulative<br />
skills still lags far behind needs. And here we are helping<br />
with gifts of technical equipment to colleges with books and<br />
with teachers. Kuching in Sarawak, is only one of the multitude of<br />
examples which could be given. Australian gifts of earthmoving<br />
equipment are being used to train local labour. In<br />
Singapore we are setting out to equip a second technical<br />
school. In Vietnam and Thailand Australian equipment and<br />
inspectors are at work on trade training. And the whole </p>
<p>r range of Colombo. Plan activities from our point of view is<br />
largely connected to the technical assistance aspect or<br />
equipment which can help the countries concerned to help<br />
themselves. FOREIGN AID<br />
It is not only by our own direct foreign aid expenditure<br />
that we can help the developing countries of Asia and<br />
the Pacific. We can help also by bringing their problems to<br />
the notice of other aid giving countries which recognize we<br />
have a good deal of first hand knowledge and contact with<br />
our geographical neighbours.<br />
We have been involved in the aid field in Asia longer<br />
than most. The Colombo Plan set up in 1951 was largely a<br />
product of an Australian initiative, and Sir Percy Spender,<br />
now the President of the International Board of Justice at<br />
The Hague, was the prime mover in getting the programme<br />
established. Early in 1966 we joined the development assistance<br />
committee of the OECD. This committee comprises the major<br />
Western European aid donors, the United States, Japan, and<br />
now includes Australia.<br />
The activities of the Australian Council for Overseas<br />
Aid, established in 1965, has the aim of co-ordinating the<br />
activities of voluntary organizations whose projects-in devcloping<br />
countries supplement in a valuable way the Government's<br />
official aid programmes. Some of you will be aware of the<br />
organizations represented on that council. They include the<br />
Australian Council of Churches Community Aid Abroad and<br />
the Overseas Service Bureau. There is of course a crisis of<br />
people in Asia, and it is one of the harsh ironies or<br />
paradoxes that as we improve health standards where everybody<br />
wants to see them improved, and the expectancy of life in<br />
some countries, we merely add to their problems of supplying<br />
the growing population.<br />
India is a case in point where quite dramatic advances<br />
in the public health field substantially increased The<br />
expectancy of life.<br />
We shouldn't and we mustn't go into Asia seli-righteously<br />
selling ' Western concepts and ways of doing things as -he best<br />
and only course for these countries who have a history and<br />
tradition hundreds of years, perhaps thousands of years,<br />
older than that from which we draw our beliefs. And w9<br />
mustn't assume that ours are the only answers and that they<br />
must change fundamentally all the things on which they hove<br />
built up their beliefs. </p>
<p>6<br />
ECONOMIC BACK3ROUND<br />
I came across a table the other day which gave some<br />
facts about Asian nations area, population, gross national<br />
product and average output per person. And it is quite a<br />
fascinating table, if I just run down a column and pick a<br />
few of the countries out of average output per person. You<br />
will see the gap which exists at the present time between<br />
the more affluent and the less affluent peoples of the world.<br />
Australia has an average output per person and in this table<br />
which is taken from an official U. S. Department of Commerce<br />
source we have the highest average output in the region of<br />
1967 dollars per person per annum. That is spread over the<br />
whole population. Burma<br />
Cambodia $ i150<br />
Communist China $ 105<br />
India Indonesia<br />
Japan ( which of course has made tremendous strides<br />
industrially in the years since the First World War, and more<br />
particularly since the Second World War) 4,878. But even at<br />
that most people would, I think, be rather surprised to find<br />
that their average output per person is rather less than half<br />
in value of money than that of the Australian.<br />
Malaysia $ 520 a low figure by our standards, but<br />
a high figure by the standards of<br />
most, nearly three times the output<br />
of people of some of these other<br />
countries.<br />
New Zealand, as might be expected, ranking very close<br />
to Australia, and in earlier years was ahead of us, 1B62,<br />
to our .1967. North Korea<br />
North Vietnam<br />
Pakistan Philippines $ 160<br />
Singapore q$ 450<br />
S. Korea $ 100<br />
S. Vietnam 115<br />
Formosa &gt; 225<br />
Thailand $ 120<br />
Now, if I were to occupy your time by giving you<br />
figures of population as well, and gross national product<br />
figures, you would find some very interesting points emerge.<br />
But I will just give you two illustrations from them. If you<br />
look at this table you will see that India has a population<br />
about 42 times that of Australia, but it has 1' ess than double<br />
the value of Australia's gross national product and on average<br />
output per person in money value approximately 1/ 20th that<br />
of Australia. Indonesia, with more than nine times our population,<br />
has a gross na. tional product only one-third that of Australia, </p>
<p>with an average output per person only -/ 28th that of this<br />
country. Now this doesr't of course reflecthe_ energy and<br />
the industry of people in the countries concerned. There<br />
are hard workers in every country and I suppose there are<br />
some drones in every country. But it does reflect the degree<br />
of industrial development, echnical skill technological<br />
advance that one country is able to generate by comparison<br />
with another And it is one of the reasons why Australia,<br />
with only 111 million people, still counts as a factor,<br />
particularly in the economic life of the world. We rank<br />
amongst the first ten or twelve traders to be found around<br />
the world. The countries of Asia, with the exception of Japan,<br />
have not yet truly reached the take-off point. 3ut despite<br />
this, there are real grounds for hope, particularly if the<br />
area can be kept free of the senseless costs of war, and aid<br />
can be kept flowing into sund and self-generating projects.<br />
There is a transfer in resources from Australia for our own<br />
aid effort. It currently takes place in a number of ways,<br />
through contributions to the World dank and other international<br />
bodies through membership of the Asian Development Bank,<br />
through the Colombo Plan. and through bi-lateral programmes<br />
such as food aid for India.<br />
A major effort from Australia necessarily is made in<br />
the territory of Papua/ New Guinea but our other international<br />
economic aid contributions are substantial. The annual rate<br />
now runs at well over one hundred million dollars, and we<br />
are moving fairly steadily towards what has been stated as<br />
a desired goal of one per cent of gross national product.<br />
At the moment it has moved up to I think 0.64 per cent and<br />
leaves us among st the first four or five nations of the world<br />
in per capita terms in the srant of aid. But the size of<br />
our effort of course is limited by our own vast development<br />
needs. We have a continent the size of the United States to<br />
develop. Our reliance on a fairly substantial inflow of<br />
overseas capital, which accounts Tor about 10% of our total<br />
investment in fixed assets. And our need to greatly expand<br />
the defensive capacity of Australia, both for our own security<br />
and to assist in the joint security programmes aimed at<br />
producing stability in this area of the world.<br />
In the trade field we have taken several steps<br />
specifically designed to create greater market opportunities<br />
for the products of the less developed countries and hence<br />
to encourage their economic development. Imports into<br />
Australia of a range of products of particular export interest<br />
to developing countries are liable to substantially lower<br />
rates of duty than are payable on corresponding products from<br />
developed countries. In addition we have removed or are in<br />
process of removing, tariffs on a large range of handcraft<br />
products produced in developing countries as a means of<br />
assistance to the traditional industries to be found there.<br />
And, as our own industrial base grows, more capital and skills<br />
accumulate, not only for our national or personal benefit,<br />
but for the volume of international assistance we are able to<br />
give. </p>
<p>8<br />
POLITICAL BACKROUND<br />
We have to recognize the facts oflife in Asia and<br />
appreciate that were it not for the firm determination of<br />
the United States in South Vietnam and the.. role Britain<br />
played in Malaysia and is continuing to play in the area, the<br />
shape of Asia would be very different from that which exists<br />
today and the promise of the future would be very different<br />
from that we look forward to today. The generous commitment<br />
of these two countries has provided stability and a real<br />
measure of freedom. It has made it possible for many of the<br />
countries of Asia to participate in their own ways in the<br />
political social and economic revolution so necessary for<br />
the well-being of their peoples and so important to us as<br />
their near neighbours.<br />
ASPAC is one example of growing co-operation between<br />
the countries of Asia and we are proud to be included. There<br />
are signs of other forms of co-operation growing the visits<br />
of political leaders, such gathering s the Manila Conference.<br />
We certainly hope this process will continue and that the<br />
work of these organizations already established will strengthen.<br />
Among the more encouraging of recent political developments<br />
I think the following deserve special mention:-<br />
Settlement of the long-standing dispute between<br />
Japan and Korea. These two countries have established normal<br />
relations and committed themselves to closer co-operation.<br />
The close relations now existing between Australia<br />
and Japan two countries quite recently at war with each<br />
other. It is certainly a welcome change. Japan has become<br />
now the biggest purchaser of Australian exports. We rank<br />
second customer of the exports of Japan. . e look to increasing<br />
and friendly links between our two fast-developing countries.<br />
Indonesia successfully overcame the Communist attempt<br />
to seize power. Its new government is concentrating on plans<br />
for economic recovery and development. From the figures I<br />
gave you a very difficult task lies ahead of them. Already<br />
there are attempts being made to give practical assistance<br />
from a considerable number of countries.<br />
Australia has established in recent years warm<br />
relationships with a number of these Asian countries. Even<br />
in the confrontation period we retained links of understandg<br />
with Indonesia. Cambodia is certainl not in the American camp but<br />
we represent them in South Vietnam. Ve also represent the<br />
U. S. in Cambodia. It is quite an interesting development<br />
there and I give a lot of the credit to the French-speaking<br />
mbassador who has established very good relations with<br />
Frime Minister Sihanouk.<br />
We have developed important and friendly links with<br />
Thailand, more particularly over recent years and this aain<br />
as a special interest for us as far as our nearest neighbour,<br />
Indonesia, is concerned, because there has been a long<br />
historic course of friendship between those two countries<br />
and when the confrontation negotiations were carried through, </p>
<p>9<br />
it was, ou may remember, in Bangkok that the parties met<br />
and in the friendly atmosphere provided by the people of<br />
the Thai administration, they were able to make very good<br />
progress.<br />
STABILITY AS OUR GOAL<br />
Our goal in Asia is one of stability. That is one<br />
of our principal goals at any rate. We don't mean by that<br />
something passive, conservative or resistant to change.<br />
That in itself carries the seeds of instability and indeed<br />
we have our own strong sense of national drive and independent<br />
spirit and we've supported movements for national independence<br />
in South East Asia. But our concept of stability is a<br />
progressive one. We want in this region a constructive<br />
assured environment in which governments and administrations<br />
can plan and carry through with some certainty programmes<br />
and reforms based on the rational use of resources and<br />
conceived in the interests of the community as a whole in<br />
which public authority is an instrumentality of the public<br />
welfare and is responsive to the needs of the community;<br />
and in which there is prospect of real participation on a<br />
broad basis in economic an social affairs.<br />
Stability brings progress. In South East Asia it is<br />
the countries enjoying stability where conspicuously we find<br />
development occurring, rapid change and reform and a sense<br />
of national vitality and where the forces of modernisation<br />
are most apparent. Another point I should note with you is<br />
that nation-building on this constructive basis requires cooperation<br />
from other countries in the region and a stable<br />
external environment. A number of countries in South East<br />
Asia today are, in fact reaching out towards regional<br />
co-operation as with ASPAC, the Manila Conference, Developmait<br />
Bank and in other ways and are truly entering into international<br />
arrangements for security and defence, economic<br />
assistance for educational and technical benefits. We in<br />
Australia feel a strong sense of common interest and<br />
mutuality of purpose in these matters. Despite the separateness<br />
of our histories and of our cultural and ethnic backgrounds<br />
our national aims and external attitudes are very similar<br />
indeed. Respect for national independence, peace and stability,<br />
economic development, widening opportunities and conditions<br />
of freedom. Now this was summed up well by the distinguished<br />
and able Foreign Minister of Thailand and he said that<br />
although Australia was not racially a part of Asia, it was<br />
considered as so because of the friendly interest she showed<br />
in the welfare of the people of Asia.<br />
aain, President Marcos, at the Summit Conference at<br />
Manila had this to say about it: " The participation in this<br />
meeting of the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand<br />
is a hopeful agry. These two freedom-loving nations are<br />
our neighbours by the accident of geoeraphy but our friends<br />
and partners by deliberate choice. They are as fully </p>
<p>A 1 10<br />
committed as ourselves to the freedom of Asia and to the<br />
attainment of the secure and just peace indispensable to the<br />
economic development of these combined nations. They have<br />
much to contribute to the attainment of our common goals."<br />
And that I think demonstrates that Australia has been<br />
doing something of the job which your conference feels is the<br />
responsibility that lies ahead of us.<br />
I conclude by speaking of the goals that were set<br />
out in one of the documents which emerged at the Manila<br />
Conference. It was called the Joals of Freedom. It said<br />
there, the seven nations gathered in Manila, declare<br />
our unity, our resolve and our purpose in seeking together<br />
the goals of freedom in Vietnam and in the Asian and Pacific<br />
area." That document which I believe to be historic in its<br />
impact and its implications, recites that the goals are:<br />
" To be free from aggression. To conquer hunger,<br />
illiteracy and disease. To build a region of<br />
security, order and progress. To seek reconciliation<br />
and peace throughout Asia and the Pacific."<br />
If we can live up to those goals, all of us, not only<br />
Australia but others in the region, then I believe we shall<br />
be doing our job. 4 </p>
