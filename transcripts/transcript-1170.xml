FOURTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE AUSTRALIAN,<br />
ASSOCIATION OF NATIONAL ADVERTISERS HELD AT<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. 11TH OCTOBER, 1965<br />
Mr. Chairman, LIdies and Gentlemen<br />
I '. ill pursue a very satisfactory practice<br />
that I ii.. ve established over the years and declare this<br />
conference open.<br />
Hivin, said that, I suppose I ought to explain one<br />
or two things.' The first is that I Jeoerve no credit whatever,<br />
no particular virtue is involved in coming here this morning.<br />
I c. uoe under orders. I received my orders from a good friend<br />
of mine, Sir Frnk P. icker, who reminded me at the time he made<br />
the demand that he published a certain number of journals.<br />
I'll refrain from mentioning them; you know them and, as no<br />
politician ever knows where the next good deed will come from,<br />
I c. 7iL. e. I h,. ve been fascinated by this advertising business<br />
for a long time but I've never fuite understood it. The<br />
Ch'iirman said that I am a good publio relations man' I mt to<br />
assure you that I the despair of everybody who sets himself<br />
up as a public relations consultant. I non't profess to be good<br />
at that kind of thing though it' 2 worked out reasonably well<br />
over the last few years.<br />
But I certainly do need some instruction on this<br />
matter of the advertising that I see most frequently promoted<br />
by some of you, and which I see here on the commercial television<br />
station. I '. rant to tell you at once that this fascinates me;<br />
it really does. I'LI sitting there on the few occasions when<br />
I can look at the T. V. I'ra terribly interested in the fate of<br />
the hero, perhaps of Mr. Simon Templar and just as the villain<br />
walks through the door points the pistol and says, : Stand<br />
back Templar," tue next voice says, " How'd you like to have<br />
your washing down in the main street": It i6 only as a result<br />
of long experience and a certain amount, no doubt, of native<br />
genius, that I've been able to discover where the film proper<br />
ends and the advertisement begins: Just as similarly, when<br />
the heroine in the glamourous mode of twenty years ago is<br />
reaching the point, the whole demeanour of the play suddenly<br />
changes and you see her down on her knees scrubbing the floor<br />
and somebody saying something about immonia.<br />
Now, I don't profess to understand these things, but<br />
I think you have added to the gaiety of the nation by advertising<br />
on television. I sat down one night and thought, " Now, really,<br />
some of this annoys me." I am an ordinary customer so to<br />
speak. Then I realised that of course that is the art of<br />
advertising. You remember things that irritate you much<br />
longer than you remember things that please you. But if you're<br />
irritated and say, " Oh, I'm fed up with this detergent;' next<br />
time -ou go in to buy a detergent, it is the one you buy:<br />
Th.. t I believe is the whole principle of advertising.<br />
Now all that is by way of preamble; the truth of the<br />
matter is and ycu have made it quite clear in your own<br />
constitution and your own documents the truth is that<br />
advertising has become a vital element in the whole of private<br />
enterprise and commercial operation and, indeed, as we've / 2 </p>
<p>d m -22-<br />
been reminded, in Government activities, there could be no<br />
business I suppose worth speaking about except a very elementary<br />
one, if the manufacturer, or the wholesaler, had to rely<br />
entirely on individuals going around showing samples of his<br />
goods. If ie is to be in touch with the consumers, if he's<br />
o' develop the large sales that are demanded by the desire<br />
for a large production and a successful enterprise, then<br />
advertising must be the means.<br />
Therefore, advertising which brings the consumer<br />
into touch with the seller is, I believe, a vital element in<br />
commerce, and because it is a vital element in commerce, it<br />
requires one more attribute. In the long run no commodity<br />
is going to maintain its sales indefinite y unless it has<br />
quality and regularity of supply but above all things, a<br />
standard of quality that people have come to expect. This is<br />
a very very important thing in commerce, and if you are to have<br />
a maintenance of quality in the stuff that is sold the goods<br />
that are sold, the services that are sold, then it's equally<br />
clear that advertising must have quality. Otherwise advertising<br />
would be in conflict with the commodity or service that is<br />
being soldi Quality in advertising is just as important as<br />
ouality in that hlch is being provided by the seller. Now I<br />
think hat is clear enough and it is all the more clear when we<br />
remember as all of you do, as I do, that this country adheres<br />
to a system of free enterprise and will not tolerate the idea<br />
that comDetitive enterprise will bring about a lowering of<br />
standards for the sake of quick sales, but depends in the long<br />
run on the raising of standards, certainly on their maintenance,<br />
and therefore on the perpetuation and growth of sales to<br />
advertising of auality. I don't mean advertising that's<br />
directed to highbrows because highbrows are a very small proportion<br />
of the community, but advertising which has its appeal to<br />
ordinary men and women and does not strike them as being either<br />
absurd or untrue. However, I know that this association of yours has<br />
for many years advocated these very ideas. I'm not stating<br />
anything Tresh. I am for a few minutes preaching to the<br />
converted. Now the establishment of these standards, the<br />
maintenance of quality seems to me, as it seems to you, to<br />
depend a great deal on corporate experience and corporate<br />
judgment. That is why you have formed an Association. I<br />
daresay that any one of you representing substantial concerns<br />
would have felt quite competent to work out his omw advertising<br />
plans, to engage his own advertising men, go about the various<br />
things that are done. But a ouarter of a century ago or<br />
thereabouts, you decided that there was much to be gained by<br />
having corporate judgment, the development of a common standard<br />
and so you got together and if I may say so, Sir, with enormous<br />
success. Your success is best demonstrated by the wonderful<br />
conference this morning, added to which I am told as the day is<br />
fine, you're going to conduct a series of little talks while<br />
perambulating in the sun. This is very gosd. The old Latin<br />
tag you remember, " salvatore ambulante". You'll become the<br />
peripatetic school of philosophers this morning, and this is<br />
good. This will lead to intimacy of discussion and it will all<br />
end up with a corporate mind and corporate judgment. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The last thing I want to tell you about this great<br />
topic I don't profess to understand very perfectly is this.<br />
There have been some heard say that there is too much repetition<br />
in advertising. Now, I might have belonged to that school of<br />
thought myself bein one vho likes to have a matter explained<br />
to him once and not fifteen times, but for a very early<br />
experience I had before I'd gone into Parliament before waves<br />
ha closed over me and I was taking a little preliminary<br />
splash' It was at some kind of a political affair which might<br />
have been on a Constitutional Referendum or something like that.<br />
I went to the Prahran Town Hall. I had not really made a<br />
political speech before, and I made a speech, I was accompanied<br />
by an old uncle of mine who had been in Parliament.<br />
It was at the Prahran Town Hall and in spite of the<br />
inherent improbabilities in the Prahran Tovn Hall for me, this<br />
was a good meeting. After I came out I was rather pleased<br />
with myself and thought, " Now I've explained that matter to them<br />
and it is crystal clear." I came out and I got into my uncle's<br />
car and I said hopefully, " Well, Uncle, how did that go?" He<br />
said, " It was terrible.<br />
My face fell no doubt. Then he said " Look, as<br />
an address to the High Court, it couldn't have been faulted.<br />
It was clear, you didn't ever repeat yourself, you assumed that<br />
your audience was a hih-powered audience which would understand<br />
every word, every syllbale. As a High Court performance m<br />
boy, it was admirable I don't doubt, But as an address to the<br />
people it was hopeless. Now let me tell you this," he said.<br />
You are a bit afraid of repeating yourself. Do understand<br />
that in communicating with the people, persuading people<br />
this is as true of your business as it is of mine in<br />
communicating with the people it is essential that you leave<br />
them at the end with a very clear notion of your central theme.<br />
They must go away with that in their minds. They are not to<br />
go away saying, ' e's a clever speaker'. That means nothing.<br />
They are to go away saying, ' That was a good point he made."<br />
If you are to do this then you must not just state<br />
your main point once. You must approach it from the North, the<br />
South, the E-. st and the West, always bringing yourself to a<br />
conclusion in which is the centre of your argument, So, if<br />
you are going to be good at this kind of thing you must four<br />
imes approach the central proposition you want to establish,<br />
not with of course the same words in a different way, but always<br />
concluding with the thing rou want them to take away with them.<br />
The more I think of that the more I realise that very very wise<br />
remark of uncle is not entirely unrelated to the principles<br />
of advertisin-and making an impact on the public mind. Although<br />
you are the advertisers rather than the advertised, you are of<br />
course profaundly interested in the success of the advertising<br />
that goes on in your name.<br />
Now I'm sorry to have inflicted on you the wandering<br />
views of an amateur but in a sense, jou're all amateurs too,<br />
because I'll lay ndds that when you aecide with your agents to<br />
put on an advertising campaign of same kind, you are, on the<br />
whole, happy when it comes out right.<br />
I just want to say to all of you that I hope it will<br />
always come out right. I'm delighted to be here to open this<br />
conference. </p>
