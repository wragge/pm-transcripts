PRIME MINISTER FEBRUARY 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO U. K. AND AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSMIEN, LONDON<br />
I am sorry time is quite as tight as it is, because of schedules<br />
that have to be kept later in the day. I welcome very much the<br />
opportunity to be with you and if I can speak for just a moment<br />
or two, I will be happy to try and answer any of your questions about<br />
Australia or how we see the next few years developing.<br />
But first, I think I would like to say that we all, as I believe,<br />
understand that the world has changed over the last 4 or 5 weeks or<br />
perhaps, more accurately, our perceptions of it have changed and<br />
the Russian movement into Afghanistan and the opportunities that that<br />
will open up creates a new and more dangerous and more difficult<br />
environment than we hoped we had. I do not know that it really means<br />
there is any changed policy on the part of the Soviet Union. I think<br />
it is just another particular application of long, continuing<br />
policies, but it does mean that we have to look again at our own<br />
perceptions of detente and the way our relationship with the Soviet<br />
Union should develop and I think it also means that we have to look<br />
to our own defences and our own arrangements.<br />
There have been strong reactions from the British Government,<br />
which Australia certainly supports, and-a strong and courageous lead<br />
from the United States, which also, as I believe, needs the strongest<br />
possible support from independently-minded nations around the world.<br />
And what we do need is a collective will and a collective<br />
determination, and it might be a somewhat gloomy view, but the time<br />
we are living in at the moment if one wants to make comparisons<br />
might be equivalent to 1935 or 1936, and then it would have been<br />
possible to do certain things which would have prevented later<br />
events. It was not possible to take those actions in 1938 or 1939,<br />
because neither BritCain nor France then had the power that was<br />
necessary. And so, a collective will, led by the United States but<br />
supported by major countries in Europe, as we would believe from<br />
Australia, is of enormous importance at the present time.<br />
We have got no presumptuous view of what a nation of 14 million<br />
people can do in this kind of situation, but we are nevertheless<br />
determined to do what Australia can and 7e will be increasing our own<br />
defences. We will be undertaking greater military activities in the<br />
Indian ocean in cooperation with the United States. There will be<br />
closer liaison with South-East Asia, and additional actions in the<br />
Pacific, doing what we can to look after our own particular region.<br />
But what this new environment emphasizes, I think, more than ever<br />
before is that we all need strong and vigorous economies, and if we<br />
were worried about the fight against inflation and the dangers posed<br />
by high inflation, then we need to worry doubly now, because you<br />
cannot have the kind of economy and the kind of strength that is<br />
necessary to meet the political and strategic challenge which will / 2 </p>
<p>lie in front of us, not for 6 months, for 12 months, for 5 years, but<br />
maybe for 10 years or 20 years then we need an economy that is<br />
vigorous and strong, with inflation low, and with a determination<br />
within a nation to look after its own affairs and to protect its own.<br />
And in that environment, the fight against inflation remains, so far<br />
as Australia is concerned, a number one economic priority, and if we<br />
have to spend additional sums on defence, it will not be at the<br />
expense of increased deficits, it will not be at the expense of<br />
letting our money supply run out, it will not be at the expense of<br />
allowing inflation to run away from us in a way which would not<br />
otherwise be the case. Unless we do that, I think we run the risks of<br />
losing some of the gains in our economy over the last 4 or 5 years<br />
where, as many of you will I hope know and understand from your own<br />
context of Australia, there has been significant success in the fight<br />
against inflation not as much as we had hoped, not as much as we<br />
would have wanted, but nevertheless, by world standards, we are<br />
increasingly competitive. Manufacturing exports are rising and<br />
getting into markets in many different places, and we intend that<br />
that will continue.<br />
We want to promote profitability,, and businesses of all kinds in<br />
Australia, I think, are more profitable than they have been for a<br />
very long while. We want to encourage investment, and last year there<br />
was a record for overseas investment a record and a higher figure<br />
in real terms than there had been for 10 or more years.<br />
As a result of what we have been doing, there is an increased<br />
competitiveness, the best, I think, again for 10 years. The balance<br />
of payments is much stronger. For a number of reasons, the strength<br />
of mineral and resource industries and the great rural industries of<br />
Australia, are doing much better than they have for a long while.<br />
They have come together, the major industries, profitably, for the<br />
first time, maybe, for 15 years. It is, not often that all our major<br />
industries are having a good year at one time, but when that does<br />
happen in Australia it adds enormously to the strength of our own<br />
balance of payments.<br />
But it is not only those things. our manufactured exports are<br />
going to play a growing role in absolute if not in relative terms,<br />
and I think that in itself is an indication of the competitiveness<br />
of the Australian economy.<br />
In the 1980' s I think there are going to be great and growing<br />
opportunities and while what is happening in oil-producing countries<br />
is of great concern to all of us, in a perverse kind of way there are<br />
some advantages in that for Australia, because while we are not<br />
self-sufficient in oil, we have a surplus of other forms of energy<br />
and it enables the bringing together in processing of Australia's<br />
natural resources minerals with electricity based on coal which<br />
gives us, as we believe, a significant competitive advantage.<br />
This is already happening in the aluminium, alumina, industry with<br />
4 billion dollars' worth of investment going ahead at the present<br />
time. That would not have happened, obviously, without the bauxite in<br />
Australia. It would not have happened without abundant supplies of<br />
electricity based on coal in either Queensland, New South Wales or<br />
Victoria. And we would expect that more of this would happen as oil<br />
prices rise and as the natural force of economics and freight costs<br />
will make more processing in Australia, rather than merely carting<br />
the raw materials away, increasingly effective. Government policy is<br />
designed to promote and encourage this kind of development. We have<br />
over the last 18 months, started new policies in cooperation with / 3 </p>
<p>States to make sure that the basic governmental infrastructure<br />
is available, so that it will not impede or hold up major resource<br />
developments, and whether it is a need to shift vast quantities of<br />
coal, a need for the development of ports or roads or internal<br />
transport, we want to make quite certain that there is all<br />
encouragement for the great projects which await the capital and<br />
entrepreneurial skills in the development of Australian resources.<br />
Where, about 3 years ago, we could see ahead of us something like 6<br />
billion dollars' worth of investment in mining and manufacturing,<br />
over the last 2 years something over 6 billion dollars has in fact<br />
taken place, but now the prospective list of firmly committed<br />
projects or projects in the final stages of decision-making, stands<br />
between 16 and 17 billion dollars, which I think indicates the<br />
increased tempo of resource and industrial development in Australia.<br />
Some of the consequences of what has happened: I think there is a<br />
wider range of industries which are internationally competitive. It<br />
is not just the raw material, quarrying industries, but extending<br />
also into advanced manufacturing and aluminium. The economy is more<br />
diversified, I think, than it has been before, with rural products,<br />
metals, minerals, manufactures and service and financing industries<br />
all playing a role. And really, as a result of that, as I believe, we<br />
enter this decade with a more strongly-based economy than Australia<br />
might have had in the past. And perhaps because of this, there is<br />
some greater insulation from the swings and changes that can happen<br />
in other countries. I think if we had asked our treasury officials<br />
in, say, July or August of this year, and if we had known in asking<br />
the question what was going to happen to Britain and British interest<br />
rates, to the United States and United States Interest rates, and<br />
say, " what is going to be the imp~ act on Australia?" I<br />
believe they would have looked slightly horrified at interest rates<br />
of the kind that are seen here and in the United States and indicated<br />
a much greater impact on the Austrdlian. economy than in fact has been<br />
the case. The impact on the Australian economy has been minimal.<br />
Certainly, there have been pressures, but we have been able to meet<br />
those pressures by and large with minimum adjustments within<br />
Australia and I think that more than anything else might be a mark of<br />
the strength of the Australian economy, because if we had been<br />
subject to those same pressures 3 years ago or 10 years ago, I have<br />
not got the slightest doubt that the adverse effects on Australia<br />
would have been very much graver.<br />
I do not think there is any need for me to say, amongst this<br />
group, that we welcome foreign investment and welcome overseas<br />
investment more welcome if it is in partnership with our own, but<br />
that is not an absolutely necessary criterion for development and<br />
activity within Australia.<br />
We see ourselves working in partnership with people from many<br />
other countries arid especially f~ rom the United Kingdom, with a<br />
longstanding, traditional relationship, which so far as I and my<br />
Government are concerned we would want to see enhanced and fostered,<br />
not just in our time but for a very long while to come. We also<br />
believe, with the energy problems that face the advanced industrial<br />
world in particular, that there is an increasing role for Australia<br />
because of our possession of coal and minerals and that that will<br />
help over a period of time probably to strengthen links with<br />
countries such as the United Kingdom on the one hand and with Japan<br />
and other countries of Europe also.<br />
Gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. I am sorry that time<br />
is short, but I welcome the opportunity to be with you.<br />
