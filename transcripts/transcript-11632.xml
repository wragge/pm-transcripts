    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Professor Gilbert. To Professor Clarke and all the</p>
<p> other very distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I am particularly happy to be here this morning. I am, of course, very</p>
<p> conscious of the extraordinary worldwide success of cochlear and bionic</p>
<p> ear and just what an extraordinary contribution this great project has</p>
<p> made to putting Australia on the map. And of carrying our scientific achievement</p>
<p> to the rest of the world and demonstrating just what can be achieved if</p>
<p> you have an effective partnership between the Government, the universities,</p>
<p> our medical practitioners and scientists and the business sector.</p>
<p>In many ways it's a template for what ought to be achieved in other</p>
<p> fields in the future. It drives home to all of us that we each have a</p>
<p> role. It certainly drives home to me and I have had driven home to me</p>
<p> on a number of occasions that the Government has a very important role</p>
<p> in medical research in this country. I know, of course, people would quite</p>
<p> properly say including many here, not just medical research, but all other</p>
<p> forms of research in this country. But I am very happy to say that in</p>
<p> the area of medical research we have not been unresponsive not only in</p>
<p> relation to this project but also more generally with the commitment we</p>
<p> made in the Budget last year to double our financial support for that</p>
<p> in the years ahead.</p>
<p>I am also very conscious that this opening takes place here in Melbourne</p>
<p> and Melbourne has a great, indeed enviable tradition of really being the</p>
<p> home of family and corporate medical philanthropy in Australia. There's</p>
<p> no city in the world for its size I think that has done better in terms</p>
<p> of supporting medical institutes and it's a tribute to the sense</p>
<p> of community of the people of Melbourne especially that they have been</p>
<p> so generous.</p>
<p>I have a particular interest in this project. Whilst I am happy to say</p>
<p> that I was never afflicted in the way that so many that have been helped</p>
<p> here were, hearing impairment is something that affected me as a child</p>
<p> and as a young person. And I can well remember my teenage years wearing</p>
<p> one of those then not so invisible hearing aids and I wondered at the</p>
<p> time of the extraordinary difficulty and challenge in life of children</p>
<p> who are born profoundly deaf or for some other combination of reasons</p>
<p> such as meningitis or otherwise and that was the very familiar childhood</p>
<p> affliction and disease that caused the total or near total deafness. And</p>
<p> I have watched with more than just a passing interest and having had the</p>
<p> acquaintance over the years of some of the more eminent surgeons in this</p>
<p> area who have made such a contribution to improving the enjoyment of life</p>
<p> of so many Australians.</p>
<p>And nothing quite touches any of us as a physical affliction of a child.</p>
<p> Profound deafness or blindness or disability is something that all of</p>
<p> us melt in compassion and sympathy before. And to see the delight on the</p>
<p> face of a child whether you meet that child or you see that child on film</p>
<p> or television who's had hearing restored or hearing given or sight</p>
<p> improved is something that really makes life worth living. It makes science</p>
<p> worth the dedication and the application and it makes whatever support</p>
<p> financially and otherwise that the private sector and governments around</p>
<p> the place can give absolutely worthwhile.</p>
<p>We have remarkable researchers in this country and it's very appropriate,</p>
<p> may I say, that this opening occurs at the time of the Innovation Summit</p>
<p> here in Melbourne because what that Summit is doing is to remind all of</p>
<p> us of the linkages that I mentioned earlier, to remind all of us that</p>
<p> this is going to be an area where Australia can continue to punch above</p>
<p> her weight in the 21st century. We are very good at this and</p>
<p> we should understand how good we are. We should honour the contribution</p>
<p> of so many people in the past, honour the contribution of people to this</p>
<p> institute. And to Dr Clarke and to so many others I'm filled with</p>
<p> admiration and I'm also filled with admiration for the young researchers</p>
<p> and scientists that I met a few moments ago. And I know that I'll</p>
<p> have the opportunity to meet some of the people who have been the recipients</p>
<p> of this marvellous hill scaled as far as medical science in Australia</p>
<p> is concerned.</p>
<p>I want to assure you of my on going commitment and that of the Government.</p>
<p> I want to compliment Cochlear. I want to congratulate all of those who've</p>
<p> been involved in supporting the institute, and all of those associated</p>
<p> with the University of Melbourne Â it's vice-chancellor, it's</p>
<p> previous vice-chancellors, and all of those who have made such an enormous</p>
<p> contribution to something that makes me as Australia's current Prime</p>
<p> Minister immensely proud of just how much we have achieved in this area.</p>
<p> We have a capacity because of the kind of society we are to do even better</p>
<p> in this area. We have brains and professional application the equal if</p>
<p> not the better of any in the world. We have a business community that</p>
<p> is increasingly aware of the constructive role that it can play. We have</p>
<p> leadership on a vice-chancellor level in many of our universities now</p>
<p> recognising that nobody operates alone any more, that you have to have</p>
<p> linkages between universities and the private sector. And we also, can</p>
<p> I assure you, have a Government that places an extremely high priority</p>
<p> on this kind of activity. And most importantly of all as Australians I</p>
<p> think we all have an immense personal commitment and sense of excitement</p>
<p> about doing something that improves the quality of lives of young Australians</p>
<p> in particular, and generally pushes forward the boundaries of medical</p>
<p> science.</p>
<p>It's frequently been said that the last 25 years of the last century</p>
<p> were very much the information technology quarter of the century. I think</p>
<p> it's also fair to say that the heights that are going to be scaled</p>
<p> in the area of medical research and medical science in the first 25 years</p>
<p> of the 21st century will leave people in the year 2050 gasping</p>
<p> in amazement about what we've achieved because I think we all know,</p>
<p> and I am a total layman and a real struggler in terms of trying to understand</p>
<p> the complexities of medical science, but there is a sense that I think</p>
<p> all of us have that we have achieved a great deal and we are reaching</p>
<p> as Dr Clarke said to me a few moments ago some of the last frontiers in</p>
<p> certain areas of medical science and research. It's a very exciting</p>
<p> time to be involved and the thing that we should be immensely proud of</p>
<p> is that Australia is right up at the front of it and medical research</p>
<p> and activity here in Melbourne is right at the top of the Australian effort.</p>
<p> And that gives a special sense to this occasion and gives me a very particular</p>
<p> pleasure to be associated with the opening of the institute. Thank you.</p>
