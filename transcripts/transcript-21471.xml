<p>... positive news for the car industry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, very good news for the car industry, I mean this is what future political debate in this country should be about - jobs, investment and offering hope for the future. And it is very, very good news for South Australia because what's happened is that a little bit of a set back with Mitsubishi, governments have worked together to respond, strong investment climate in Australia attracts new Japanese investment, more jobs are created. Now that is terrific.  10 years ago a Mitsubishi type development would have flattened people psychologically. Now they take it in their stride, they attract a new investment, and they move onto a brighter future.  Now that has to say something about the strength of the Australian economy. It also has to say something about the co-operation between the South Australian Government and the Commonwealth Government.  I mean I'm in the business of co-operating with state governments in positive ways because we have a joint obligation to our people and our job is to generate opportunities and to provide alternative employment and I think it's just tremendous news for the people of Adelaide, it's tremendous news for the South Australian economy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
