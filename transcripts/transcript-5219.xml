J-j, AUTAI i..<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 18 DECEMBER 1979<br />
RHODESIA<br />
The Australian Government warmly welcomes the<br />
announcement from London that final agreement had been reached<br />
between the parties at the Constitutional Conference on all<br />
aspects of a Rhodesian settlement.<br />
The leaders in the talks -Lord Carrington, Bishop<br />
Muzorewa, Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Mugabe -are to be congratulated<br />
for their outstanding dedication to the task of reaching<br />
agreement. In the four successive phases of discussion<br />
on an independence constitution, on transitional arrangements,<br />
on ceasef ire arrangements, and on implementation procedures<br />
all the parties had shown a willingness to compromise, to<br />
move away from entrenched positions, and to continue negotiating<br />
even when at times it seemed that the conference could go<br />
no further. The agreement is a magnificent achievement of historic<br />
importance. It opens the way for a just and democratic solution<br />
to the political problems that have for many years bedevilled<br />
Rhodesia. It means an end to the war that has brought suffering,<br />
death and economic hardship to many thousands of people of<br />
all races in Rhodesia and the surrounding countries.<br />
The London agreement means in essence that all the<br />
parties who have been engaged in the Rhodesian conflict have<br />
now agreed to put their faith in democratic elections, to<br />
be conducted under the authority of a British Governor,<br />
in order to determine Rhodesia's future Government. The<br />
British Government resumes its authority over Rhodesia for<br />
the transitional period leading up to the elections. Following<br />
signature on 19 December of the settlement reached at<br />
Lancaster House, the ceasefire will come into effect on 27<br />
December. The elections will be held about 2 months later. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Australia has contributed significantly to the<br />
reaching of this settlement and will be taking part in its<br />
implementation. With signature of an all-parties settlement and<br />
British authority re-established in Rhodesia, the Australian<br />
Government can be satisfied that the objectives for which<br />
sanctions were imposed have been achieved. The Australian<br />
Government will therefore now take the necessary steps to<br />
remove sanctions against Rhodesia.<br />
The Government recongises that a number of countries<br />
may wish to await the formal lifting of sanctions by the<br />
United Nations Security Council. But for Australia, as a<br />
country that has played an active part in contributing to<br />
the present outcome, the Government believes it is appropriate<br />
to remove sanctions immediately following the signature of<br />
an all-parties agreement on Wednesday.<br />
This will mean that, among other things, travel<br />
between Rhodesia and Australia will be unrestricted. Trade<br />
and other forms of contact will be similarly unrestricted.<br />
Britain, the United States and some other countries<br />
are also lifting sanctions against Rhodesia. The Australian<br />
Government hopes that all other nations now welcome Rhodesia<br />
back into the world community by the lifting of sanctions and<br />
the encouragement of the Government that will emerge as a<br />
result of the forthcoming elections there.<br />
The London Conference had its genesis in the<br />
recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka.<br />
At that meeting, under the chairmanship of President Kenneth<br />
Kaunda of Zambia, Commonwealth leaders addressed the Rhodesian<br />
problem as a matter of priority concern. Australia was one of<br />
the small contact group of six countries that drafted a set<br />
of principles on which a negotiated solution could be based.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
These principles were adopted by the Lusaka meeting. They<br />
were intended to provide a framework for early efforts by<br />
Britain and the other interested parties to reach agreement<br />
at the conference table, and to establish a political climate<br />
of support for movement away from entrenched adversary<br />
positions. The Lusaka principles proved their worth in a long<br />
and difficult negotiating process in London. The continued<br />
interest and moral support of Commonwealth countries, and their<br />
strong desire that the talks should not be allowed to fail,<br />
was a significant and helpful factor.<br />
Australia will be contributing to the implementation<br />
of the agreed settlement in two ways.<br />
First, Australia will provide a contingent of<br />
around 150 men to a ceasefire monitoring force, along with<br />
contingents from Britain, Fiji, Kenya and New Zealand.<br />
Britain's willingness to mount such a force, and Commonwealth<br />
countries' willingness to contribute, became an essential element<br />
in reaching agreement in London. The function of the monitoring<br />
force will be to observe and report on the effectiveness of<br />
the ceasefire. In no circumstances will it be called upon<br />
to enforce the ceasefire, to intervene or mediate between<br />
opposing forces, or to exercise law-and-order functions in<br />
Rhodesia. The role of the force, and arrangements for its<br />
operation, have been agreed between the British and Australian<br />
Governments. The Australian Government is satisfied that<br />
proper arrangements have been made, and accordingly it has<br />
authorized the despatch of the Australian contingent to<br />
Rhodesia. / 4 </p>
<p>A small advance party is leaving Australia on<br />
December. The main body of the Australian contingent is<br />
due to arrive in Salisbury on 24 December, and to move out<br />
to operational areas on 25 and 26 December. They will remain<br />
on duty throughout the pre-election period. It is intended to<br />
withdraw the contingent as soon as practicable after the<br />
announcement of the election results, and in any event no<br />
later than the independence day for Zimbabwe.<br />
The despatch of Australian soldiers abroad is an<br />
important event. Australia has in recent years contributed<br />
in various ways to UN peacekeeping and monitoring arrangements,<br />
in Cyprus, the Middle East, and Pakistan. There will be risks,<br />
as in any such operation. But the Government is satisfied<br />
that it has taken a responsible decision as a member of the<br />
Commonwealth, in helping to bring about the restoration of peace<br />
and democracy in Rhodesia.<br />
Australia will also be sending a team of election<br />
observers, and providing a representative for a proposed<br />
collective Commonwealth team which is being organised by the<br />
Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr. Ramphal.<br />
The task of the national team will be to observe<br />
and to report to the Australian Government and Parliament on<br />
whether the elections conducted under the authority of the<br />
British Governor are free and fair.<br />
It is proposed that the Commonwealth team report,<br />
through the Commonwealth Secretary-General, to Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government. Its membership would be drawn from a<br />
representative group of Commonwealth countries.<br />
The Government will announce the composition of<br />
Australia's national election observer team, and Australia's<br />
representative on the Commonwealth team as soon as possible. </p>
<p>A small Australian Liaison Office will be established<br />
in Salisbury to assist the ceasefire monitoring contingent<br />
and the election observers. It will also serve as a direct<br />
point of contact between the Australian Government and<br />
the British authorities in Salisbury. </p>
