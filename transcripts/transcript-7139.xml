JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE TREASURER, MR<br />
PAUL KEATING, MP AND THE MINISTER FOR ARTS, VERITAGE AND<br />
ENVIRONMZNT, MR BARRY COHEN, M?<br />
The Government has decided not to approve a proposal to<br />
develop a silica sand mining project at Shelburne Bay, Cape<br />
York. The project would have satisfied the ownership and control<br />
provisions of the foreign investment guidelines. However,<br />
the Government has decided that the proposed mine at<br />
Shelburne Bay would be contrary to the national interest,<br />
chiefly because of its impact on the environment.<br />
The Gove: nrient's decision follows detailed and careful<br />
consideration of the proposal. Sand mining at Shelburne Bay<br />
would have damaged the wilderness value of the area and<br />
would have involved some damage to the Great Barrier Reef.<br />
It also uould have had an adverse effect on the Aboriginal<br />
communitv.<br />
Our decision on Shelburne Bay is part of the Government's<br />
commitment to the environment. In our nearly 200 years of<br />
European sottlement Australian governments too often have<br />
paid scant regard to the environment. This Government<br />
accepts its responsibilities to protect environmentally<br />
valuable azeas for future generations.<br />
The Governnent's decision on Shelburne Bay has no<br />
implications for the strength of its commitment to encourage<br />
foreign investment. The decision that the project will not<br />
proceed has been made on environmental grounds, not foreign<br />
investment grounds. Indeed, the Government would not allow<br />
a locally-owned operation at Shelburne Bay. The Government<br />
has the capacity under its export control powers to ensure<br />
that no lozally-owned operation would proceed. </p>
