    <content><![CDATA[<p>S3PIEC'i BY LMR PRIME~ MIISTER ZltE RTo HON. R. G.<br />MENZIES9 AT J441SH 4A1R MEJ4OIAL ; AN&amp; WqO<br />26, ai F~ 4~ W~ di 1 142<br />Sirg ladies and 6entlemen,<br />There are a couple of aspects of today's proceedin,,, s that I<br />would like to mention right away. The first is that 1 wa3 told<br />yesterday that my friend, Mr. Smith had levoted a fortnitght to<br />preparing a magnificent speech and that Mr. 1foffuan was coming back<br />from abroad just in time to deliver it. Wiell that tarmed out to be a<br />egloomy prophesy., . Lhe se* cond fact that i want to mention to you is that this<br />mornin4, into m~ y offices came, among others9 the Chief RabA, Rabbi<br />3rodi., -iho has I regret to tell you, a formidable memory because he<br />reminded me that 10 years ago I made a speech In his presence on an<br />occasion not entirely dissimilar to this arid9 what's worse, he<br />roaeibered what 1 had said. Now this, of course is most embarrassing<br />bizuso no doubt on tiagt occasion I : iaid all that I had to 3ay; and<br />the trou~ le Is that he re. wbers It and th. orefore9perhaps, I can't<br />say It again. That was an ocoasion v'hen we were celebratin-P a very<br />notatble event in the history of the Fustralian Jewish oowvanity in<br />Melbourne, My old friend Jaron Snider will no doubt remiember it very<br />-ioll. i bad a few -iords to say on that o,: casion, as I. tvie today.<br />Herle we are on a splendid site -we're join-, to have a<br />synagogu', a ommunity centre -strategically placed next door to the<br />Presbyterians. That's very 3-' tisfactory to weo very sitisfactory.<br />(' aughter) Jut 4hen I looked ait the book of tfie words that I was<br />given I was really surerixed to find that the total Jewish corn-unity<br />in Canboerra nmmredi 1W peoplet something around 100 adult ptrsons,<br />i-" hat is a very simall number in a city of 96,000 or 57 000. And in<br />those circumstanoes one might not have been surprised to hind"" that this<br />relative handful of people anxious though they might be , nd Properly<br />so to preserve the symbols and practice of their ancient faith<br />anxious though they might be to provide rior their children a training,<br />a bringing-. up in that faith anid in its educational methods, said,<br />I" veUl sorry, ) ut it can't oe done; there aire so fewo Of -, Mt they<br />i'erenit deterred by the fact that thay were so few, They m~ ade, what<br />I will always believe to be one of the most imaginative de~ isions Lkade<br />in recent years in this place. They saidt * This Is the capital of<br />AUstr~ jaia. This -11 on , rowing aind roving in numoers and in<br />importancet and we must set out to~ impress upon the conscience of the<br />Jewish comm~ unity all over Australia how important It is that there<br />should be, in this places a shrine tind a schiool and a place of mooting",<br />Now this was a m,-gnificent and ima~ giniative conceltion. It is<br />a matter of *., reat satisf'actioni to me, and i'M 3ure to all of you, to<br />realise ho4 it wdas seized upon as an lini 4, native Idea by -,-' ople of the<br />Jewish community all over Istralia, The result Is that ,. oday we have<br />the privilee, of being present at the laying of a 2tone# at the<br />be~ inning of a buildings at the oe,. innhig of a ci-. ntre, 4hich will some<br />day cater for the needs, not of 160 pe~ ople but, I imagine, of thousands<br />or people in a 4reat, Iforiard-looking, national capital.<br />Now jir I t'iink that that is a splendid idea. ' n4 because<br />it is a splenlid ila. I hope that all over f~ srlapeople of your<br />comnmuniity will. rally to it and be proud of it ' tid do so-' ething for<br />it; and that " eople not oIt your cmunity wrill have enough imagdnation<br />to see the significance of it and, in their turn lend their aid,<br />lend their recognition, lend their encoura.; mexnt lor something that has<br />such great spiritual and educational signifficance in Australia,</p>
<p>There is Just one other thing that I vould like to say to<br />you and it is this. The fact that here we are at the beginning of the<br />construction of a Synagogue, a school, a centre is not to be taken as<br />meaning that the Jewovish community in Australia feels that it is<br />something apart. That is not true; any more than the existence over<br />the road here of the Burns Club means that the Scottish community reel<br />they are something apart. Now as a man of Soots origin I have never<br />thought that we were something apart; I've Just thought that we were<br />in the business, but rather better. ( Laughter) And that is the<br />whole approach. Here is a comunity not I'm happy to say, torn asunder by<br />racial dispute# by disputes of religion. Here is a community in which<br />I'm* happy to say I find, overvhelminly, a broad tolerancet a broad<br />sense of the oamon aim that we all have to leave a better country than<br />ve found. In such a country it isn't right to suppose that some of<br />these old things that occur in an old world, and in a worse vorldp are<br />being perpetuated. If a J3ow in Australia devoted himself entirely to<br />the retrospective study of ancient history and medieval history he<br />could find much to sorrow about, much persecutions much deprivation of<br />rightst muoh deprivation of liberty. All those things are part of<br />history; but they are not part of Australia. have the great<br />pleasure, the great honour, the privilnge that puts responsibility upon<br />us to live in a country in which all th.:: t history is forgotten, a<br />country in which we are not anti anybody, but pro somebody: torn<br />asunder politically ' y parties engaging every now and then in the<br />luxury, if you care to look at it that way, of elections. This is<br />very spirited; this divides all churches, all schools of thought,<br />dut when it comes to the basic element there is no decent Australian<br />who worries about soebody'else's derivation of race, somebody else's<br />religious adherence; on the whole, he prefers to have a man of faith,<br />even though it be not his faith, to a man of scepticism and unbelief.<br />Therefore -e can all meet here whoever we may be, to whatever church<br />we may subscribe, happy and proud to think that once more in the<br />history of Canberra we are attending the setting up of a symbol of<br />faith, of hope, atnd as I believe, of aharity.<br />Sir* it is a very ; reat privilce for me, and for my wife#<br />to be present here this afternoon. It has been a particular pleasure<br />for me to renew my acq'. iaintance with the Chief : iabi. And if I an<br />still around somewhere in anothir 10 years' time I shall look forward<br />to meeting him and we can put our feoot up and, on that occasion, recall<br />with reat advantage the speeches that wo have neaver male. ( Applause)</p>
