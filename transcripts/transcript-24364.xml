    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government is dismayed by Victoria's decision not to proceed with building the East West Link.</p>
<p>The unprecedented announcement that the Victorian Government would rather pay hundreds of millions to a consortium than build the East West Link is a massive set back to Victoria.</p>
<p>The Victorian Government’s decision to abrogate contractual responsibilities sets a dangerous precedent for future projects and threatens further investment in much-needed infrastructure in our country.</p>
<p>They have damaged investor confidence in major infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Australia can’t afford to discourage private investment in infrastructure because government alone cannot afford to build the infrastructure that our country needs.</p>
<p>There is no alternative to the East West Link in Victoria.</p>
<p>The East West Link is the only major shovel-ready project in Victoria.</p>
<p>It is the only answer to easing Victoria’s traffic congestion.</p>
<p>The Victorian Premier has today destroyed 7,000 jobs.</p>
<p>And the Victorian Government’s actions today mean that Melbourne’s daily traffic gridlock simply gets worse.</p>
<p>Victorians should feel let down by Daniel Andrews who promised before the election that no compensation would be paid.</p>
<p>The tearing up of this contract damages Victoria’s reputation as a place to do business – as has been proven by revelations this week that the French and Spanish Governments have made direct representations of concern to Victoria.</p>
<p>The East West Link is the only answer. Tens of millions of dollars and years of planning have already been invested to get the project shovel-ready.</p>
<p>$3 billion from the Commonwealth Government remains on the table for any Victorian Government which wants to build the East West Link.</p>
<p>We will talk to the Victorian Government about other projects, but the truth is there is no other major shovel ready project in Victoria.</p>
<p>Victorians will suffer as a consequence of this reckless decision.</p>
