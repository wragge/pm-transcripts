<p>Australia congratulates Mr Shinzo Abe on the Liberal Democratic Party's victory in Japan's lower house elections on 16 December.</p>
<p>Australia's close strategic partnership with Japan is built on shared values, common security interests and a longstanding friendship. </p>
<p>Japan is Australia's second largest trading partner with two-way trade more than doubling in the past ten years to reach $75.6 billion in 2011-12.  Japan is also our largest Asian source of foreign investment, with a total stock of $123 billion in 2011. </p>
<p>Together we played a key role in the founding of APEC and in developing the roles of the East Asia Summit and the G20.  Japan is a major contributor to the United Nations and we look forward to working with it during Australia's term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. </p>
<p>As Japan's Prime Minister in 2007, Mr Abe visited Australia to participate in the APEC leaders' summit in Sydney. </p>
<p>I look forward to working with Mr Abe after he is sworn in to deepen and enhance our ties, including through completion of a high-quality and comprehensive Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>I would also like to acknowledge the contribution by Japan's outgoing Prime Minister, Mr Yoshihiko Noda, to strengthening Australia-Japan ties.  </p>
