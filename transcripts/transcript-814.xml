COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH. BY<br />
Rt. lion. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.<br />
ON<br />
MALAYSIA DEFENCE.<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates," 25th September, 1963.]<br />
MALAYSIA DEFENCE.<br />
Ministerial Statement.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister)-by leave-I present to the<br />
House the following papers:-<br />
Malaysia Defence-<br />
Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement of 1957.<br />
Notes exchanged between Australia and<br />
Malaya in March and April, 1959.<br />
United Kingdom Malaysia Agreement of<br />
July, 1963 ( excluding Annextires).<br />
Notes exchanged between Australia and<br />
-Malaysia in September, 1963.<br />
In reference to the last of these papers,<br />
I point out that in answer to a question<br />
last week, I summarized the effect of these<br />
notes exchanged between Australia and<br />
Malaysia. In substance I then said that<br />
our existing arrangements with Malaya<br />
would now apply to Malaysia.<br />
It may be remembered that so far back as<br />
April, 1955, the Government emphasized<br />
the importance of Malaya to the security of<br />
the zone in which we live, and pointed out<br />
that in consequence, Malayan integrity and<br />
defence were matters from which we could<br />
not and should not stand aloof. Reasons of<br />
this kind, directly affecting us, were of<br />
course, closely allied with the proper<br />
interests of others-who are our friends.<br />
The establishment of the Commonwealth<br />
Strategic Reserve, of Seato-to the functions<br />
of which the Reserve was relevant-the<br />
9633/ 63. negotiations of the Anzus pact, are all in the<br />
same pattern. That is a pattern, not of<br />
aggression, but of defence; not of isolation<br />
in defence, but of -common effort for the<br />
common security.<br />
There has been some suggestion that our<br />
forces in Malaya went there primarily for<br />
purposes of internal security. This is not<br />
so. As I have indicated, they went there<br />
and are there as a part of a strategic reserve<br />
with the United Kingdom and New Zealand<br />
and as a contribution to the defence of the<br />
South-East Asian area. True, we,-quicly<br />
agreed that our forces could be employed<br />
in operations against the Communist terrorists<br />
in Malaya. They were so employed,<br />
with success, and with great credit to themselves<br />
and Australia. The facts were, of<br />
course, that these terrorists were promoted<br />
and supplied by Communist authorities outside<br />
Malaya, and that their activities were<br />
as much acts of war against the territorial<br />
and political integrity of Malaya as would<br />
have been overt military invasion. We think<br />
that the people of Australia have agreed<br />
with these policies and decisions. In all<br />
these arrangements, and in any to be made,<br />
the usual rule will apply that the employment<br />
of' Australian forces remains under the<br />
control of the Australian Government. We<br />
have acted and will continue to act consistently<br />
with the Charter of the United<br />
Nations. </p>
<p>But Malaysia, the new nation, is here.<br />
The processes of its creation have been<br />
democratic. The United Nations Secretary-<br />
General, having appointed suitable persons<br />
as examiners, reported that the people of<br />
North Borneo and Sarawak desired incorporation<br />
into Malaysia. The Prime Minister<br />
of Singapore, one of the great sponsors of<br />
Malaysia, has just received an overwhelming<br />
endorsement at the polls. We have<br />
publicly and unambiguously said that we<br />
support Malaysia which is, never let it be<br />
forgotten, a Commonwealth country, just as<br />
our own is. Should there be any attempts<br />
to destroy or weaken Malaysia by subversion<br />
or invasion, what should Australia do about<br />
it? -We know that the United Kingdom<br />
accepts, in substance, the position of a<br />
military guarantor. Honorable members<br />
now know the terms of our own recent<br />
exchange of notes.<br />
The Government of Malaysia has said<br />
clearly that this exchange is completely satisfactory<br />
to it. But it has not been the normal<br />
practice of Commonwealth countries to<br />
spell out in detail their sense of mutual<br />
obligation, nor to confine themselves to<br />
legal formulae. For example, our vital<br />
engagements with the United Kingdom are<br />
not written or in any way formalized. Yet<br />
we know and she knows that in this part<br />
of. the world * we look to her, and she looks<br />
to. us. We each apply in a spirit of mutual<br />
confidence a golden rule. of . mutual<br />
obligation. But for the benefit of all concerned,<br />
honorable members would not wish me to<br />
create or permit any ambiguity about Australia's<br />
position in relation to Malaysia. I<br />
therefore, after close deliberation by the<br />
Cabinet, and on its behalf, inform the House<br />
that we are resolved, and have so informed<br />
the Government of Malaysia, and the<br />
Governments of the United Kingdom and<br />
New Zealand and others concerned, that if,<br />
in the circumstances that now exist, and<br />
which may continue for a long time, there<br />
occurs, in relation to Malaysia or any of<br />
its constituent States, armed invasion or subversive<br />
acti v ity-sup ported or directed or<br />
inspired from outside Malaysia-we shall<br />
to the best of our powers and by such means<br />
as shall be agreed upon with the Government<br />
of Malaysia, add our military assistance<br />
to the efforts of Malaysia and the<br />
United Kingdom in the defence of Malaysia's<br />
territorial integrity and political independence.<br />
Inow present the following paper:-<br />
Malaysia Defence-Ministerial Statement,<br />
September, 1963.<br />
Motion ( by Mr. Adermann) proposed-<br />
That the House take note of the papers.<br />
Debate ( on motion by Mr. Calwell)<br />
adjourned. S~ r Robert Menzies.-Perhaps I may be<br />
permitted to say that copies* of what I have<br />
just said and of the documents referred to<br />
will be available at once for a0 honorable<br />
members.<br />
By Authority: A. J1. ARTmuR, Comnmonwealth Government Printer, Canberra. </p>
