OPENING OF THE ORD RIVER DAM<br />
KUNUNURRA, W. A.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon<br />
William McMahon, C. H., M. P. June, 1972.<br />
Mr. Premier, Mr. Chairman, Sir Reginald, Sir Charles, my " ther<br />
Parliamentary Colleagues, Distinguished Guest, including my own<br />
Minister for the Interior, Hunt, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
Before us as you can see stretch the waters of the greatest<br />
man-made lake that has ever been built in Australia. It is a<br />
unique and imaginative enterprise.<br />
For years we have talked about the Ord Irrigation Scheme<br />
here on Australia's North-West frontier, in a region where some of<br />
our pioneers wrote their names into the record of our history.<br />
This is the country to which the overlanders came in the last<br />
century. Let us, now, remember those adventurous men and their<br />
families, who drove their cattle until they reached the Kimberley.<br />
The story of the Durack family is only one which enriches the<br />
history of the far North-West. They first crossed our continent to<br />
settle here in 1835, and it took them over two years to get here.<br />
Today the site of their homestead, named Argyle, lies under this<br />
lake. It is singularly appropriate, therefore, that the Government<br />
of Western Australia has given the name Lake Argyle to this<br />
great stretch of water.<br />
The early pioneers broke the silence of this land. Since then,<br />
the modern pioneer has come, and technology has made its contribution<br />
to the pace of development.<br />
The Ord River Irrigation Scheme is one result, with this dam<br />
as its central feature. Storing millions of acre feet of water,<br />
it gives a new kindcE like to this area: To the cotton and other<br />
crop farmers, and to the adventurous Australian families who lived<br />
and have made their homes here in Kununurra. They have demonstrated<br />
their confidence in the North West in an unmistakble way. / 2 </p>
<p>It is not my interntion today to recite the history of the<br />
Ord River Scheme although I want to say I have had a long<br />
association with it ever since it was first mooted in the<br />
Commonwealth Cabinet.<br />
In some ways, it has been a controversial project, which has<br />
had its troubles and its problems. Many have been overcome but<br />
new ones crop up to test the skill and energy of the farmers,<br />
research workers, and of the officers of the two Governments<br />
Commonwealth and State as well.<br />
Let us put problems aside to talk about the engineering<br />
triumph this dam really is. Let us acknowledge the spirit, the<br />
enthusiasm and the labours of those who live here.<br />
The North-West no longer sleeps in the past. It is<br />
bustling, adventurous and Drogressive. Beef-roads have soread<br />
across the Kimberley. Highways link the outposts with our ports<br />
and with cities, and the jet-port at Kununurra has conquered<br />
distance and brought the Ord River community into the web of a<br />
rapid transport system.<br />
I am pleased to mention here that the Commonwealth recently<br />
approved a major upgrading of the road to the Kimberley on the<br />
Northern Territory side of the border. This will provide a high<br />
standard, all weather link through to Katherine, Darwin, Alice<br />
Springs and on to the east.<br />
The West Australian and Commonwealth Governments have taken<br />
many initiatives together in the Fast Kimnberley. We began in 194G<br />
when the two Governments financed the Kimberley research station.<br />
We brought the CSIRO to the area, and it is still here and will<br />
continue to do valuable work. The Commonwealth has contributed many<br />
millions of dollars to assist the West Australian Government. in its<br />
development programmes in the whole of the North-West.<br />
West Australia has always had faith and confidence in this<br />
Ord Scheme and i the impact it would make in the East Ximberley and<br />
in the North. It was against this background that the Commonwealth<br />
Government decided in 1967 to provide funds within a limit of<br />
$ 48 million for the main dam and the development of the irrigation<br />
area around here.<br />
You, Mr. Premier, as you so well said, as Minister for Public<br />
Works were a driving force for this project in its early stages<br />
and so were Sir David Brand and Sir Charles Court in later years.<br />
The results of this enterprise and co-operative effort not<br />
only by governments but by people cannot yet be measured fully.<br />
Much has been achieved but and I repeat more or less what you said<br />
1r. Premier there is much still to be done.<br />
But let me mention two or three developments that stand out<br />
at this time. First cotton. I amn told thc cotton area per<br />
farmer has almost doubled in about seven years. The yield has reached<br />
top world standard now 1000 lbs. of lint per acre or nearly<br />
double what it was seven years ago. That is a first-class<br />
performance. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Then there is research. The experts tell me the Kimberley<br />
Research Station has made good progress on hybrid cotton, cattle<br />
production, peanuts, safflower and sorghum. So, too, have the<br />
West Australian Department of Agriculture, and scientists and<br />
researchers of the University of New England in New South Wales<br />
who are also working in this area.<br />
These applied experiments will help to increase the range<br />
of activities here, and give the Ord region further economic<br />
diversity. They will make their contribution, Mr. Premier, to the<br />
goals and to the ideals that you have mentioned.<br />
So we have here today something made and something in the<br />
making. It is an interesting and spectacular country and provides<br />
the attractions and climate, I believe, for tourists. Who knows<br />
that at some time in the future this Lake could be the site of a<br />
great water carnival for the North and the North-West, attracting<br />
overseas tourists who want to see the granduer of our new<br />
frontiers. Both governments have been alert to preserve the natural<br />
beauty of this environment, and funds have been provided for<br />
ecological studies over a very wide area. This is a place, I<br />
believe, where man and nature can live in harmony.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have here today a huge dam<br />
a great lake and a new horizon for the East Kimberley and the<br />
North-West. Those associated with this project have planned and built<br />
well. I would like to mention the personnel of the constructing<br />
authority, which was the Public Works Department of Western<br />
Australia, and the contractor, Dravo Pty. Ltd. which was awarded<br />
the contract in world-wide competition. I cr-:-; aatulato them on the<br />
jobs they have done so well.<br />
This is part of our nation-building, and we are a great<br />
country part of a process that is going on all. over Australia<br />
today. I new have the very greatest pleasure n officially declarii<br />
the Ord Piver Dam open. </p>
