    <content><![CDATA[<p>A major boost to drug treatment programs and new measures to encourage drug users to stop using illicit drugs will flow from an agreement between the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments today.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria today announced an agreement on funding and arrangements for the diversion of illicit drug users in Victoria.</p>
<p>Drug diversion gives people who are caught using drugs the option of undertaking treatment and/or education aimed at helping them to stop using drugs, rather than getting caught up in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The agreement builds on the successful diversion pilot initiatives that have been conducted by Victoria.</p>
<p>It gives practical effect to the commitment of the Commonwealth and Victoria to divert drug users into treatment as early as possible according to the principles of the national diversion framework endorsed by all Australian governments last year.</p>
<p>Consistent with those principles, the agreement provides a major role for community based organisations through a partnership with government.</p>
<p>Under the agreement the Commonwealth will provide around $23 million over three years for the Victorian Diversion Initiative from funds allocated to the Tough on Drugs program.</p>
<p>Initial funding for diversion in Victoria will involve:</p>
<p>? 80 drug treatment providers approved for community based non-residential treatment.</p>
<p>? Around $6 million a year for assessment and treatment services for people who are diverted.</p>
<p>? $4.4 million over three years for additional residential and withdrawal beds required to service the initiative at Barwon Health in Geelong, and at the Salvation Army Anchorage facility in inner Melbourne.</p>
<p>? $3.3 million over three years for residential rehabilitation.</p>
<p>? Training for drug and alcohol services providers, and for the Victoria Police.</p>
<p>Victoria will make a $10.22m contribution towards the agreement for:</p>
<p>? The cost of housing stock for the supported accommodation service</p>
<p>? Additional police and court operational costs</p>
<p>? 50% of the cost of assessment services</p>
<p>Victoria will also make a contribution of $2.17m over two years to ensure that the entire program can commence in January 2001.</p>
<p>A reference group with representatives of Commonwealth and State governments and the Australian National Council on Drugs has been established to provide advice on the implementation of diversion.</p>
<p>Diversion initiatives will be implemented across Victoria providing services in regional areas where they are needed.</p>
<p>The initiatives resulting from this bi-lateral agreement will maximise the opportunities for drug users to break away from drugs and take personal responsibility for their lives.</p>
<p>23 August 2000</p>
