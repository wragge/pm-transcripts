NATIONAL PRESS CLUB OPENING 27 MAY 1976<br />
IT GIVES ME PARTICULAR PLEASURE TO BE STANDING<br />
HERE THIS EVENING AND TO GAZE OVER A SEA<br />
OF FRIENDLY FACES.<br />
ON OCCASIONS LIKE THIS,: IT IS COMFORTING FOR<br />
THE SPEAKER TO KNOW THAT HE IS AMONGST FRIENDS,<br />
I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED VERY GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE<br />
PRESS... SOMETIMES THEIR RELATIONS WITH ME'HAVE<br />
BEEN A BIT STRAINED, IT HAS NEVER BEEN MY FAULT.<br />
THI-S OCCASION,-IS OF COURSE, OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE<br />
TO THE PRESS IN CANBERRA. IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT<br />
TO ME AS THE LIBERAL PRIME MINISTER.<br />
YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT THAT THE LAST<br />
LIBERAL PRIME MINISTER, BILLY MCMAHON, 1URNED THE<br />
FIRST SOD IN THIS SITE IN 1972,<br />
HOWEVER, HE DIDN'T REFER TO THE CAPTION UNDER THE<br />
PHOTO IN THE BAR OF MR MCMAHON PERFORMING THAT<br />
TASK, IT READS: " BILLY MCMAHON TURNS SOD." </p>
<p>I AM INDEBTED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE NATIONAL<br />
PRESS CLUB FOR SCHEDULING THE BUILDING AND<br />
CONSTRUCTION WORK SO. THAT : A LIBERAL PRIME<br />
MINISTER IS STILL ABLE. TO COMPLETE . THE COMMEMORATION.<br />
THE PLAQUES WILL READ THE FIRST..' SOD WAS<br />
TURNED BY: BILLY MCMAHON ETC, ETC," AND<br />
" THIS BUILDING WAS OFFICIALLY OPENED BY MALCOLM FRASER."<br />
So TO THE CASUAL OBSERVER, IT S AS THOUGH THE THREE<br />
LABOR YEARS NEVER HAPPENED.<br />
INCIDENTALLY, LOOKING ROUND THIS BUILDING AND<br />
ITS FURNISHINGS, I CANNOT HELP BUT MARVEL AT THE<br />
TRUE PATRIOTISM OF THE NATIONAL PRESS CORPS,<br />
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF WEEKS AGO THAT THE NEWSPAPER<br />
HEADLINES ERRONEOUSLY SPLASHED OUT WITH<br />
I.<br />
" FRASER SAYSBUY BUY'BUYAND OLFRASER SAYS<br />
GO OUT AND SPEND. .1<br />
I </p>
<p>MR _ PRESIDENT, ' YOU SEEM;. TO HAVE DONE THAT WITH<br />
A VENGANCE HERE. UNTIL NOW, T HADN T REALISED<br />
THAT-. THE PRESS BELIEVED EVERYTHING I SAY.<br />
SOME JOURNALI STS AMONG-YOU MAY FIND IT IRONIC<br />
THAT.: MALCOLM FRASER OF ALL PEOPLE -' IS<br />
STANDING . UF HERE READY TO OPEN THE NATIONAL<br />
PRESS CLUB. C'<br />
IVE BEEN CALLED MANY THINGS AND DESCRIBED<br />
IN MANY ' WAYS BY JOURNALISTS. AND I MUST<br />
ADMI. T THAT : IM NOT OPENLY REFERRED TO BY MY<br />
CCOLLEAGUES AS THE_ JOURNOS FRIEND.<br />
BUT-PERHAPS FOR MALCOLM FRASER THE TIMES ARE<br />
CHANGING.. WITNESS A BRIEF EXTRACT FROM LAST<br />
WEDNESDAY'S SUNDAY PRESS NEWSPAPER IN MELBOURNE<br />
SWRITTEN BY A MELBOURNE AGE JOURNALISTS a 9* L<br />

S.. THIS MAN, THE PRIME MINISTER, HAS<br />
DONE MORE. FOR THE ORDINARY AUSTRALIAN<br />
WOMAN-THE AVERAGE STAY-AT-HOME CHILD<br />
:: BEARING HOUSEWIFE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON<br />
IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY.<br />
MORE THAN ALL THE GERMAINE GREERS, THE<br />
PROTESTERS, THE BRA-BURNING, THE WRITING<br />
SÃ¸ AND BALLYHOO PUT TOGETHER.<br />
SIMPLY, HE GAVE HER-WHAT NO ONE ELSE HAS<br />
BEEN ABLE OR WILLING TO...<br />
, HE GAVE HER A BILLION DOLLA<br />
$ 1125*. TO BE PRECISE. WHAT'<br />
.' IT FROM HER HUSBAND."<br />
I'M SURE YOU WILL ALL-AGREE . THA RS. OR<br />
S MORE: HE TOOK<br />
T THE TONE<br />
WAS DISTINCTLY FAVOURABLE.<br />
PLAINLY, THIS IS THE START OF A NEW ERA FOR ME<br />
THE CHAMPION OF WOMEN JOURNALISTS, AT LEAST, </p>

PERHAPS,. THAT ARTICLE HAS NOT CONVINCED YOU<br />
OF HOW. THE PRESS REALLY SEE. MALCOLM FRASER:<br />
PERHPAS. MY REPUTATION WITH . THE PRESS IS.<br />
WELL FOUNDED.<br />
BIIT I. CAN CLAIM A GOOD EXCUSE ITS HERIDITARY.<br />
THE PATRIARCH OF THE FRASER<br />
FAMILY,-. SIMON FRASER,-OCCASIONALLY CROSSED<br />
SWORDS WITH THE AUSTRALIAN PRESS.<br />
IN1889, THE WEEKLY MAGAZINE " TABLE TALK" SAID<br />
THIS OF SIMON FRASER, THE POLITICIAN:<br />
" HE CONTROLS THE POLICY OF THE EVENING STANDARD,<br />
OF WHICH HE IS A LARGE SHAREHOLDER, AND IS A<br />
FRIEND OF-THE PROPRIETOR OF THE AGE.<br />
AT. THAT TIME SIMON FRASER SHARED A VIGOROUS<br />
BELIEF IN FREE TRADE WITH THE AGE! S PROPRIETOR<br />
DAVID SYME; HOWEVER AS OFTEN HAPPENS WITH<br />
NEWSPAPER PROPRIETORS AND POLITICIANS THEY<br />
FELL OUT, WHEN SYME BECAME AN ARDENT PROTECTIONIST. </p>
<p>I 6<br />
SYME BANNED FRASER FROM THE EDITORIAL<br />
COLUMNS OF THE PAPER.' BUT SIMON FRASER WAS NOT<br />
EASILY DETERRED. -HE IMMEDIATELY RETORTED BY<br />
PUBLISHING HIS OWN SPEECHES AS PAID ADVERTISEMENTS.<br />
S. I: GUESS : TIMES HAVEN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH.<br />
THE PROPRIETOR OF THE AGE: AND THE CURRENT<br />
RASER. ARE'STILL CONCERNING THEMSELVES ABOUT<br />
PAID ADVERTISEMENTS THAT RECENTLY APPEARED IN<br />
THAT'NEWSPAPER. OF COURSE THE WARMTH OF THE BOND BETWEEN<br />
JOURNALISTS UPSTAIRS IN THE GALLERY AND US<br />
POLITICIANS DOWN IN THE GOLD FISH BOWL OF THE<br />
CHAMBER VARIES.<br />
SOMETIMES IT IS MORE CHEERY THAN AT OTHER TIMES.<br />
SSOMETIMES IT IS FIERY 4<br />
1dOWEVER I LIKE TO THINK. THAT OVER THE YEARS WE<br />
ARE COMING TO KNOW EACH OTHER, ALTHOUGH FROM TIME<br />
TO TIME I FIND MY BREATH CAN STILL BE TAKEN AWAY. </p>
<p>I WOULD LIKE TO RECALL A TIME DURING THE<br />
POLITICAL CRISIS LAST YEAR, WHEN THE PRESS WAS<br />
SPECULATING. INTENSIVELY. ABOUT WHETHER THE:<br />
BUDGET WOULD BE PASSED BY. THE SENATE.<br />
SEVERAL: MEMBERS OF THE GALLERY BECAME SO<br />
IMPATIENT. THEY DECIDED BOTH TO ANTICIPATE<br />
THE. EVENT ANDTO ENCOURAGE'A COURSE OF ACTION.<br />
LET ME SUM IT UP FOR YOU, IN JUST ABOUT THE<br />
EXACT WORDS THAT WERE USED:<br />
" I THINK MALCOLM WILL REJECT THE BUDGET,<br />
HE'S MAD IF HE DOESN'T," THEY TOLD MY STAFF.<br />
" MIND YOU, WHEN IT HAPPENS, WE WILL KICK THE T<br />
OUT OF HIM IN PRINT,"<br />
WELL. THE SENATE DID REJECT. THE BUDGET, AND I W<br />
LIKE TO COMMEND YOUR ABILITIES AS FORECASTERS<br />
YOU DID KICK THE TRIPES OUT-OF US IN PRINT.<br />
I THINK EVENTS LIKE THESE HELP PEOPLE TO UNDER<br />
EACH OTHER BETTER. RIPE OUL STAI i.,<br />

HOWEVER, IN THE MINDS OF MANY, CONFIDENTIALITY<br />
SWHEN.. IT APPLIES TO GOVERNMENT HAS COME TO<br />
HAVE. A BAD OR EVIL. CONNOTATION.. THAT-IS A<br />
MISCONCEPTION. 8.<br />
ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE, HOWEVER, AND SO<br />
I MAINTAIN MY REPUTATION WITH THE PRESS<br />
CAN I. BRIEFLY TALK . TO YOU ABOUT GOVERNMENTS<br />
KEEPING SECRETS.<br />
FIRST AND I . WANT TO MAKE THIS POINT CLEAR<br />
' I STRONGLY. BELIEVE THAT: AS MUCH INFORMATION AS<br />
POSSIBLE: SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.<br />
MINISTERS SHOULD BE APPROACHABLE, AVAILABLE AND<br />
' ACCESSIBLE.<br />
THEY HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO MAKE THEMSELVES<br />
AVAILABLE WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO THE MEDIA, AND ENSURE<br />
THAT THEIR DEPARTMENTS MAKE THE GREATEST EFFORTS i </p>

I'<br />
U" WITHOUT CONFIDENTIALITY IN THESE AREAS, MUCH OF<br />
THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY WOULD DISSOLVE,<br />
OF3COURSE,-THERE ARE MANY PROTECTIONS AGAINST<br />
EXCESSIVE. CONFIDENTIALITY.<br />
THE NATURE OF OUR PARLIAMENTARY. SYSTEM PROVIDES<br />
FOR THIS, . ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION.<br />
o. t<br />
ALSO A VIGILANT AND RESPONSBILE PRESS CAN PROTECT<br />
AGAINST EXCESSIVE CONFIDENTIALITY. WE'VE SEEN THAT<br />
AMPLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE WESTERN WORLDAT.<br />
THE RISK OF OVERSTATING THE ARGUMENT, CAN I<br />
MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS.<br />
CONFIDENTIALITYIN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, IS PART<br />
OF * OUR LIVES PRIVATE-. LIVES, BUSINESS LIVES<br />
. OR FOR THOSE IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS, PUBLIC LIVES.<br />
, kNA RELATTONSHIP BETWEEN DOCTOR AND PATIENT,<br />
. LAWYER AND CLIENT, -PRtIEST--PARTnrTiO'NERT, HERE<br />
ARE MATTERS OF CONFIDENTIALITY OFTEN PROTECTED<br />
BY LAW,.<br />
' I </p>
<p>OVERTHE PAST FEW YEARS.<br />
SOMETIMES THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT<br />
WANTS CONFIDENTIALITY FOR ITS OWN SAKE.<br />
I WOULD.. PREFER TO ARGUE THAT THE GOVERNMENT<br />
SOMETIMES SEES THE NEED FOR CONFIDENTIALITY<br />
AND WHEN . IT DOES IT'MUST DEFEND IT AND TAKE<br />
WHATEVER CRITICISM COMES.<br />
IN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS,<br />
CONFIDENTIALITY IS OFTEN QUITE ESSENTIAL IN THE<br />
INTEREST OF-FRANK AND TRUTHFUL COMMUNICATION.<br />
IN OUR FEDERAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, RELATIONSHIPS<br />
BETWEEN THE STATES REQUIRE A DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE<br />
THAT WOULD NOT APPLY IF EVERY LETTER BETWEEN A<br />
PREMIER AND PRIME MINISTERV-WERETO BECOME PUBLIC<br />
IN THE PROCESS OF JOINT DECISION MAKING.<br />
HAVING SAID ALL THAT, CAN RE-ITERATE MY FIRST<br />
STATEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT. / 11<br />
nl I I lr II I I I </p>
<p>11.<br />
I WANT AN UNHINDERED FLOW OF INFORMATION TO<br />
THE MEDIA, .1 WANT MINISTERS TO BE AVAILABLE<br />
TO COMMENT . I WANT FACTUAL INFORMATION PROVIDED.<br />
. How CAN ANY COMMUNITY PROGRESS WITHOUT CONTINUING<br />
: INFORMED AND -INTELLIGENT DEBATE. AND HOW CAN<br />
THERE'BE DEBATE WITHOUT INFORMATION,<br />
FINALLY, WITH DUE DEFERENCE TO THE A. B. C. CAN I<br />
S SYMPATHISE WILL ALL BROADCASTERS. I AM ONLY TOO WELL<br />
AWARE: OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF BROADCASTING<br />
AND THE HAZARDS.<br />
A FEW WEEKS AGO, LATE ONE'EVENING, I SAT DOWN IN MY<br />
OFFICE TO RECORD MY WEEKLY BROADCAST TO THE GOOD<br />
PEOPLE OF MY HOME ELECTORATE, WANNON.<br />
I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE 1000TH SUCH TIME I HAD<br />
SAT. DOWN TO IT, I VE. BEEN RECORDING IT WEEKLY FOR<br />
SOUNST 21-. YEAR.<br />
I READ THE FIRST COIPLEOF PARAGRAPHS, AND AS<br />
I WAS A LITTLE TIRED I MADE AN ERROR. </p>
<p>Ir 12<br />
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY, I GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY EXLAMATION..-<br />
WORDS NOT-FIT TO BE REPEATED HERE STOPPED THE<br />
TAPE AND STARTED AGAIN,.<br />
THE-TAPE WAS DULY LANDLINED TO RADIO 3HA HAMILTON,<br />
WITH A WARNING OF THE-FALSE START.<br />
HOWEVER, SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE, THAT MESSAGE<br />
DID NOT. GET THROUGH THE TAPE WENT'TO AIR<br />
( ON A SUNDAY EVENING TOO) FALSE START AND ALL.<br />
THE. MOST DISTURBING ASPECT OF THE INDICENT HOWEVER,<br />
WAS THAT THE STATION DID NOT RECEIVE ONE<br />
SINGLE COMPLAINT.<br />
THAT COULD ONLY MEANTTWO THINGS NO ONE WAS ACTUALLY<br />
TUNED IN, OR THOSE THAT WERE THOUGHT THE LANGUAGE<br />
WAS THE NORMAL PRIME MINISTERIAL MANNER OF ' SPEECH.<br />
MR PRESIDENT, I KNOW THIS DAY IS THE CULMINATION<br />
OF AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT-OF-TIME AND ENERGY<br />
BY A GREAT NUMBER OF-JOURNALISTS OVER MANY. YEARS,<br />
THERE IS NO DOUBT ALL THE EFFORT HAS BEEN WORTHWHILE. :. i<br />

THE-STANDING . OF JOURNALISTS IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
