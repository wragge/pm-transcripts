    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today the Commonwealth Government announced the projects to gain funding under its $50 million Manufacturing Transition Programme.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth contribution to the Programme is accompanied by over $200 million in investment by Australian manufacturers.</p>
<p>Nineteen businesses will receive between $1 million and $5 million to improve their competitiveness by investing in new capital equipment and plant improvements.</p>
<p>The Programme seeks to encourage Australian manufacturers to invest in more sophisticated and knowledge-intensive manufacturing. This will create high value jobs in areas where the greatest economic opportunities exist.</p>
<p>The $50 million Manufacturing Transition Programme fulfils an election commitment to ensure a secure future for manufacturing in Australia by focusing on areas of competitive strength.</p>
<p>It provides the structural and strategic support necessary to give manufacturers the confidence to back themselves and carve their place in a changing global market.</p>
<p>This programme complements other Commonwealth Government initiatives â such as the establishment of Industry Growth Centres and the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes â to provide the right policy settings for investment and to improve the competitiveness of Australian manufacturing.</p>
<p>Successful projects were awarded through a competitive, merit based process, and based on advice from an expert technical committee.</p>
