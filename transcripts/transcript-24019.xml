    <content><![CDATA[<p>Madam Speaker, death is the certain end to every life but it never loses its power to shock and dismay â as weâve all found since the passing of Phillip Hughes last week.</p>
<p>He was a great cricketer.</p>
<p>He was grand company.</p>
<p>He was the best of sons and the best of brothers.</p>
<p>His death has so affected people, because it happened in the midst of life at its most exuberant.</p>
<p>He was 63 not out, on his way to a century, and a return to the test team.</p>
<p>People are not supposed to die playing our national game.</p>
<p>Sport is supposed to engender pride, not grief.</p>
<p>Phillip Hughesâ passing is a reminder that life is both precious and fragile.</p>
<p>So, Madam Speaker, we mourn with his family â Greg, Virginia, Jason and Megan.</p>
<p>We grieve with his teammates, particularly Michael Clarke, who has shown such leadership over the past few days.</p>
<p>We feel for Sean Abbott, whose life can never be quite the same again.</p>
<p>Above all, we honour a young man who has left us too soon, but who filled every moment of his 26 years <em>with sixty secondsâ worth of distance run.</em></p>
