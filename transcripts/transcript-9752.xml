PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE MARKS ROYAL COMMISSION<br />
The assessment by Commissioner Marks today of the " irrecoverable" position<br />
he has been placed in because of the " fairly restrictive" terms of reference<br />
imposed on him is a sad testimony to the jaundiced, political task he has<br />
been given.<br />
The Commissioner's remarks confirm what I said in Parliament last week<br />
about the proceedings before the Commission.<br />
They highlight the issue of the propriety with which the terms of reference<br />
have been drafted and call into question the Leader of the Opposition and his<br />
shadow ministers' involvement in the foundations of the Commission, as now<br />
criticised by the Commissioner.<br />
Commissioner Marks is entirely right when he says: ' The sooner this<br />
Commission comes to an end the better.<br />
