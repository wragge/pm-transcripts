PRESS STATEMENT NO. 485<br />
4 April 1975<br />
VIETNAM ORPHANS FURTHER REPLIES FROM PREMIERS' ( 2<br />
The New South Wales Premier, Mr Lewis, sent<br />
the following reply:<br />
" my Government will accept children irrespective<br />
of their current state of health or whether they can be<br />
adopted immediately. As indicated over the last few days<br />
this government will accept responsibility for two<br />
thousand children and will give consideration should the<br />
need arise to receive more than this number. Children will<br />
receive medical and if necessary hospital accommodation and be<br />
accommodated when they arrive."<br />
The Tasmanian Premier, Mr Neilson sent the<br />
following message: " I refer to your message this morning in connection<br />
with the adoption of Vietnamese children. I note that the<br />
Vietnamese government is prepared to facilitate arrangements<br />
for the exit of orphan children. With regard to the lack<br />
of documentation I am prepared to accept this, but it will<br />
mean that some of the children will have to remain as<br />
child migrants until adoption is possible. The<br />
medical problem I accept in the emergency that this will be<br />
true and on humanitarian grounds am prepared to agree with<br />
the proposal that Tasmania should undertake to receive the<br />
children and if not acceptable for adoption guarantee their<br />
accommodation and care. Numbers of people already approved and<br />
on the State's waiting list to adopt children have now<br />
indicated willingness to accept Vietnamese children and<br />
the number currently is 30 with more expected. My State<br />
authority, the Department of Social Welfare, will continue<br />
to keep day to day contact with the Australian Department<br />
of Labor and Immigration and will at -the appropriate time<br />
supply information about procedures for reception, placement<br />
and ongoing care for the children. Tasmania is prepared to do<br />
more than its share anj will cooperate in every way with the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
