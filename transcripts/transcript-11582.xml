    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce that the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the</p>
<p> Right Hon Helen Clark, MP, has accepted my invitation to visit Australia</p>
<p> from 1 - 2 March 2000, with talks in Sydney on 2 March.</p>
<p>This will be Prime Minister Clark's first visit to Australia as</p>
<p> Prime Minister. I very much look forward to working closely with her to</p>
<p> further strengthen the wide-ranging partnership which Australia and New</p>
<p> Zealand already enjoy.</p>
<p>The combined efforts of Australia and New Zealand in East Timor over</p>
<p> recent months are but one example of that partnership in action, contributing</p>
<p> significantly to peace and security in our region.</p>
<p>We will be discussing this and other key regional issues during Miss</p>
<p> Clark's visit, as well as ways in which to build on our already strong</p>
<p> economic and other ties. I warmly welcome these annual informal meetings</p>
<p> between the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers.</p>
