PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH CHANNEL NINE 15 AUGUST 1978<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, a ritual question. What sort of Budget<br />
is it going to be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I don't know how often I have been asked that over the last<br />
few months. There is not really long to wait now, is there,<br />
because John Howard will be deliverin that Budget towards<br />
the end of today, and then people won t have to speculate<br />
about it any more. they will have the facts of the Budget.<br />
QUESTION You have said a number of times in interviews with me that<br />
this Budget is going to set the course for some years to come.<br />
What do you mean by that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I don't know that I used those precise terms. From the time<br />
we first camne into government we set a course of getting<br />
inflation. under control, restoring profitability, establishing<br />
the circumftstances where Australia can look forward<br />
with confidence, with an inner strength, and with a determination<br />
to take its place in the world, as a middle-ranking nation,<br />
but one of some substance. You can't do that if you have<br />
got rampant inflation, you can't do that if unemployment is<br />
much too high. The ills that had come from earlier times<br />
in Australian society had to be put right much progress<br />
has been made, but there is still much to be done.<br />
The Budget that will be introduced tonight will continue<br />
on the course it will further move inflation down, and<br />
at the same time it will establish the circumstances in which<br />
the steady but sustainable movement down in interest rates<br />
can be continued and should be continued. This again, starts<br />
to set the pattern where it costs much less for the home purchaser<br />
to borrow funds to build that home. It costs much less because<br />
interest rates are less for businesses that are going to expand,<br />
that want to undertake new activities. This is the real way<br />
of getting things right in the Australian economy.<br />
You can never get matters right in an economy by pretending that<br />
the basic imbalances are not there. That has been the trouble<br />
with a number of countries overseas. I think one of the differences<br />
between this Government and some others is that we have<br />
recognised the basic imbalances and we have addressed our policies<br />
to putting them right. That is to the advantage of all people in<br />
Australia young and old, no matter what they do. </p>
