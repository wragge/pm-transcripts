WORLD) AFFAIRS COUNCIL, NE WPORT DEACHI U. S. A.<br />

Q: What does Australia think of NAFTA?<br />
PM: Well, 1ve already answered sonmc Of thatt. There has been a discussion in our country<br />
about whether Australia should be part of a rogional trade agreement with the United<br />
State.,. In other words, you might remember President Bush making a speech in the<br />
election catupaign called the hub and spokes speech whero tho U. S. was proposing makinil<br />
bilateral trade agreements with countries of the Auia-Pacific. It was a sort of NAFTA writ<br />
large. f-think NAFT A can wurk for the United States because there is a naturalness about<br />
it Canada's already a large marktL and you share a common border with it. M** dco<br />
you share it border with It and you have an Interest In lif1ting the economy mid wooyo<br />
Mexico In terms ofi wealth. But I think a more naitural ai-rangemenct ~ s to ftee up trade<br />
to that countries can trade with one another and not be caught up In artificial bilateral<br />
arrangements. Theres nothing purticultrly suilficial about Mexico and Canada and the<br />
thiac's a niaturalne~ ss about that.<br />
B~ ut there can be an artificial quality to bilateral trade things, So. the notion that Austu alia<br />
should be part of NAFTA is, I think, nut one which Australia would embrace, but, rather,<br />
seeing NAk'TA part of APEC Is a more natural thing. That Is. whether the, Unted State.<br />
trades in gin agreement with Canada or Mexico Is immxater-ial to whecther it trades into the<br />
Pacific or whether Canada trades Into the T'aciflc or whether Mexic trades i the Pacilfc.<br />
So, we think NAFTA Is good for the United States. It's not necessarily our ticket our<br />
ticket is the bigger agenda of AI'EC and the U. S's Involvement In that. Indeed the NAPTA<br />
partners' involvement in that. But, it does certainly underline, in the whole question about<br />
American directions, that the Congress has decided with the Prcsldcnt, to look to the freer<br />
trade path because it's only In freer trade have we seen the greut growth iincomes over<br />
the course Of thi$ cetntury. Sol I think if' NAFTA'. a bell weather of where the Uiitod<br />
States is going thezi NAFTA Is something to be approvad of<br />
Q: When we were In Australia quitu rce; vzjtly there was a lot of discussion about the republic<br />
. Inaudible.. rclationship with the Comm nwealth Inaudibhl..? </p>
<p>2-<br />
I': I think hes trying to act. me Into troublel But 1' 11 happy to obli hin. Austria is a very<br />
unusul % situation. lt a large continental land mass, were the only nation on earth With a<br />
continent to itself, eighteen million people, we've got to consolidate the place and be part<br />
of the region in which we live, And Australia has changed. It's not a monoculturs, it's a<br />
diverse multicultural country. For instance, half our intake now from our migration<br />
program comes from, Aia; theres about 150 nationalities In Australia at the momntA.<br />
Multicuituralism hes worked there very well indeed. The toleiance and sern of<br />
democaoy In the place Is protbund.<br />
We think that we are a different kind of country than the one that we might have known In<br />
the last century or even in the first half of this century. And that Australia should be<br />
ropresented for what it is. That is. an Independent people with its own culture and its own<br />
cultural identity and that it can't make Its way i thme world &amp; 3 well as it might unle i t Mn<br />
represenits itself. Just as the people of the United Stas took a decision many years ago to<br />
manage their own affairs absolutely. This is something we are thinking of. Now, as you<br />
know now, the Queen of Oreat Britain Is also the Queen of Australia and consftutional<br />
head of Australia. And I have been bold enough to say that I think that constitutional<br />
arrangement doesn't suft us anymore. And that Australians would be advantaged by<br />
moving to a republic, with an Australian person with our Head of State so that our whole,<br />
if you like, man~ ifestation of the place and our representation or ourselves to the world is<br />
one a proud country which is indigenous and which is independent. And projecting that<br />
pariciularly in the are whore we liv.<br />
An important pan of that to also coiing to terms with oursolvcs And we are just at the<br />
moment having our own NAFTA debate with an issue called Mabo. Which is<br />
time name of an Aboriginal person who succeeded in having our supreme court age that<br />
there was a native title in the common law of Australia. And I have just introduced a Bill<br />
into the house of Parliament In Australia this wek to give an adnirativo expression,<br />
to build a body of administration and law so that the Aboriginal people of Australia secure<br />
land or repossess land as a common law right. A native title. And this Is a matter of great<br />
debate, as you can Imagine, in any country. But in corning to terms with our Aboriginal<br />
community, in seeking to let them repossess land long ago dispossessed, wc will go<br />
forward much happier and more harmonious. But go forWard a different kind of country<br />
than the one we used to be. And when we do that well be at our most powerful and our<br />
most persuasive in telling people about ourselves and, I think, to be doing that we'll be<br />
most successful. So these are the thoughts which are runnming thrugh thme mind of the<br />
nation, These are matters to be decided but for which tlicre is already a very important<br />
debate.<br />
Q: Who will open the Sydnvy 2000 Olympics, the Prime Minister or..?<br />
PM: A real trouble maker, a real trouble maker. Well, the answer is our Head Of State. My<br />
Party's objective is to sce Australia become a republic by the year 2001 which is the<br />
Centenary or our federation. Well that's the ItA January 2001 and the Olympic games are<br />
e I </p>
<p>on in Octbcr or November of die year 2000. So theres only three months diffesrence, so<br />
let's not haggle over three itonth, end maybo we cam get the job done before then, in<br />
which case it would be a simple answer. B~ ut, as none of us havc a crystal bill I can nldy<br />
say, our Head of State.<br />
Q: As Anmemica's our best mate, OK? How do you see our trade relationship?<br />
PM: You want me to take that. old?<br />
C: You take Il<br />
0: Well, we have, as I said, a great history together. I man there is genuine warmth between<br />
the United States and Australia. Genuine warmth. People to people writh. It', not just<br />
stylised government to government warmth it's Pot treaty warmth, It's rWa warmth. And I<br />
think that's evident here tonight In a reciprocal way. That's the key thing, The rent of it<br />
flows naturally.<br />
We du have diflbrent economic interests an'd we live In different pang of the world. But<br />
we do live In the pant of the world which Is growing the most rapidly and that's the Asia-<br />
Pacific. sop at good Mrends of the UnIted States we've taken the, view that, Isure, the Cold<br />
War has finished and a lot of that Cold War polarity has gone. And there may have been a<br />
view In the United States well in that caut the peace dividend has come horne from the<br />
Pacific. But 1 think too much of the Pacific policy has been made by die berence<br />
Department and not enough by the Conunerce Deparunent and the State D~ cpartinent. So<br />
what we are 3aying as Miends of the United States Is, ' Well. look we want to see the area<br />
blossom but we want to see you in It. We want to swe you in it in terms of investme~ nt, in<br />
terms of trade. We want to see you there culturally. And we want to see you theme<br />
strategically. And by doing that, saying that. and arguing a case ft~ r the United Stistas pau-ticipation in<br />
this part of the world, I think we argue the case ofa fMend, by a fiend. And themrsult will<br />
be, I think, a much better Pacific, a much quieter Pacific ind 1a1 11re bountiftit area. Not<br />
just for the countries of the Pacific but for the United States as well. So I'd likce to see out,<br />
relationship grow that way In trade terms. We'll still have our bilateral deflcie, treaty but<br />
the most important thing I'd always like to st Is more tourivin, inore visits by Americana<br />
to Austuia and vice versa to thicken up those personal relationships which, in dwi end,<br />
are the core relationsh~ ps on which, country to country relationshipr, exilst. And, they are<br />
the things I think were most proud oft That boast of friendship betwumn the United States<br />
and Australia which will remain and will provide the basis of whatever we do in trade, in<br />
IAYCuitinn or in strategic terms.<br />
Q: Prime Mfinister do you share any oftDoctor Mathiers concerns that the United States<br />
inaudible.. too much powcr/ Influetice.. Inaudible..? </p>
<p>-4<br />
PM; Well, there are many countries suspicious of the powcr of the United States but any<br />
country this large and Whs successfu will always find its detractors. Rut. fhr my Wai I'm<br />
not, obviously, because I've argued the converso cast. The key point, I think, for<br />
countries like Malaysia which worry about it, is this: The argument runs, you take, a<br />
country like Malaysia or any such country and put It Into APEC, it will get pushed around<br />
by a country like the United States. But the United Statts has a greater capacity to shape<br />
relationships thtrough bilateral ai-angements of unilateral arrangemecnts iand lea of a<br />
cApacity in a multilateral iatructure.<br />
So, there is a great body of opinion in the United States administration and the Congress<br />
which says, " Don't sign up to multilateral structures. lDon't lose our right basically, to be<br />
the top do&amp; on the street. Don't multllateralise. ourselvcs with a set of rules." That's what.<br />
APEC means. The U. S. Would multdlateralise Itself with a set of rules. It would give<br />
something away. But In return it gets a much greater access and more growth in the area<br />
of the Pacific, which can be of great benefit to it. So, for people who have fears about the<br />
Untied States' power theres more to be feared fromi the U. S. dealing with them<br />
unilaterally and bilaterally than the U. S. signing up to a multilateral struetuire with the<br />
disciplinary rules and disputes settlement procedures which apply to all the member istates,<br />
including the United Statop.<br />
So, that's why I've always thought the case against the United States mid APEC basically,<br />
is not correct. And the U. S. is better in APEC and were better off with the U. S. in APEC<br />
with the multilateral struCtUre. Now. I hope that Prime Miist er Mahathir and other<br />
people see that way over tine because I think that's as It Is.<br />
Q' I wonder if the Prime Minister could answer why he cuddled the Queen and secondly, did<br />
she enjoy it?<br />
PM: I can probably do this one cold tool Well that brought mny concern for the Queen to meet<br />
her if you like, her friends in Australia, the people slit knew, her Australian subjects as<br />
some would put it was to spirit her through a crowd. And it led with it got III* the<br />
salutation In the London tabloids, ' Hands orfvobbctil'. O-R-Fr. And they<br />
apparently bclicved I wag some sort of lounge lizard so they cliristcocd mec the Lizard of<br />
Oz. Now, I'm sure Her majesty was flattered with the attention. She has hinted that to<br />
nie since. But T can't get the tabloids to publish a word ofit.<br />
ends. </p>
