TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, CONDELL PARK PRIMARY SCHOOL, 14 DECEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What is your response to interest rates?<br />
PM: Well, this is the fastest growing economy in the western world. This is<br />
a great thing for Australia and for Australians and our most earnest<br />
wish is to keep it going right through the 1990s. If we can keep this<br />
sort of growth up that is, strong rates of growth but rates of growth<br />
so that we can sustain low inflation and then the recovery. So, the<br />
point of today's rise in rates is to shave the top off demand so we keep<br />
this recovery sustainable, to keep all those thousands of jobs coming<br />
through and we keep Australia with a great future.<br />
J: two and a quarter per cent in four months, are you touching the<br />
brakes or are you jamming them on?<br />
PM: Nobody would expect to have the interest rates at this stage of a<br />
strong cycle that we had at the bottom of the cycle and that is why we<br />
have had a change. But; it is a change, I'm sure, that all Australians<br />
will understand over time, it is going to give them much greater<br />
prospects. For instance, this year we have had 4.5 per cent<br />
household income per capita growth which is a phenomenal level and<br />
that is because of low inflation producing higher real incomes. We<br />
don't want to see that put asunder and we don't want to see too much<br />
pressure on resources including the labour market, we don't want to<br />
see too much pressure on wages. So, this is the way, if things are<br />
getting a bit too strong, this is one of the ways we can smooth it out.<br />
J: But, have you given the earlier rate increases a chance to flow through<br />
before acting again?<br />
PM: These are judgements. Monetary policy is as much an art as a<br />
science, living off both the published data and anecdotal evidence<br />
about the strengths of the recovery and I am sure the Government and<br />
the Reserve Bank think that we are getting this right to give </p>
<p>Australians that chance. That is, a chance that very few countries like<br />
us in the world have a chance of reasonably strong growth.<br />
J: Are you looking at cutting expenditure at all?<br />
PM: I hear today that Alexander Downer has committed himself absolutely<br />
to cut expenditure. Now, when the Government brings down the<br />
budget and when we have brought down budgets and statements we<br />
explain everything, all the detail is there. Alexander Downer can't go<br />
wandering around the countryside saying he will cut spending and not<br />
say whether he will cut payments on health, pensions, schools, all of<br />
the other areas of Commonwealth expenditure, income support, labour<br />
market programs, so if he wants to say that he is about cutting back<br />
the size of government, he has got to say where he wants to cut it<br />
back.<br />
J: interest rate rises for low income earners<br />
PM: Well, there hasn't been a full flow through of the past interest rate<br />
adjustments to housing. There has been quite a lot of competition in<br />
the banking sector, but the point of the rise is actually to shave some<br />
of the top off spending, that is the essence of it. So that we keep the<br />
recovery going, so that people low income people, middle income<br />
people, high income people can find in three or five years from now<br />
we have still got a strong recovery, we have still got low inflation and<br />
we have still got great opportunities which, as I say, if you look at a<br />
comparable European country to Australia we are growing at the<br />
moment at 6 per cent, they are growing between one and two. That<br />
makes all the world of difference about jobs. We have had now<br />
430,000 jobs growth since the election. Since the March election of<br />
1993 we have had 430,000 job growth. Our labour for the first time<br />
ever is past the eight million mark there are eight million people in<br />
the workforce, ten years ago that was six million, so we have kept all of<br />
those jobs and added to them and that is the key to it.<br />
J: Do you think the demand for places will go up now?<br />
PM: I think that there is a lot of competition in the workforce and in the<br />
economy and, I think, a lot of the key people in organised labour know<br />
that restraint in spending, some restraint in wages will keep low<br />
inflation and what happens with low inflation your wage rise buys<br />
more your wage rise turns into a real wage rise which buys more real<br />
goods and that is not lost on the ACTU, on the workforce in general<br />
and that is why they have been committed for so many years now to<br />
low inflation.<br />
