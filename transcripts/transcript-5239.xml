PRIME MINISTER MONDAY 21 JANUARY 1980<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF 12.30 NEWS<br />
A survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and the National<br />
Bank indicates a significant improvement in trading and profit<br />
conditions for the private sector in the final three months of<br />
last year. The December quarter's business results released<br />
today in Canberra show 71% of respondents-reported good or satisfactory<br />
trading compared with 63% in the preceding quarter. The<br />
survey also reports an improved demand for labour during the last<br />
quarter. Pat Macguire reports from Canberra. The President of<br />
the Australian Chamber of Commerce believes the latest results<br />
provide evidence of a markedly improved outlook for capital<br />
expenditure compared with the previous survey.<br />
Foreign investment in Australia reached a record $ 3,321 million<br />
during 1978-79. The figure released in Canberra today is $ 359<br />
million higher than the previous set in 1977-78. The two largest<br />
foreign investors in Australia last year were the United Kingdom<br />
and the United States. As expected oil made up the biggest share<br />
of overseas investment in Australia with $ 527 million being spent<br />
in this area in 1978-79.<br />
A British Cabinet Minister has warned that Britain faces the<br />
prospect of threee years of unparalleled austerity. The Chief<br />
Secretary, of the Treasury gave the warning at a seminar organised<br />
by the Conservative Political Centre in London. Mark Colvin reports.<br />
The minister, who is responsible for public spending in Britain<br />
said the country must expect a period of low economic growth and<br />
even recession for some years to-come. Mrs. Thatcher had indicated<br />
that she wanted to cut public spending by $ 4,000 million a year<br />
over the next three years.<br />
Meetings of striking Wool Storemen and Packers in Sydney, Melbourne<br />
and Adelaide this morning voted. to continue their-stoppage until<br />
at least Thursday. Other meetings are to be held in Queensland and<br />
Western Australia later today'. More than 1,000 Storemen and Packers<br />
walked off the job two weeks ago followed by another 800 last week<br />
after an appeal by wool brokers against a pay rise. The Federal<br />
Industrial officer of the Storemen and Packers Union says the<br />
decision to stay out will give the Arbitration Commission time to<br />
call a compulsory conference of all the parties.<br />
American athletes are to take part in a vote to determine whether<br />
they want to go to the Moscow Olympics. This follows President<br />
Carter's call for an American boycott of the Games unless Soviet<br />
troops pull out of Afghanistan within one month. The Executive<br />
Director of the United States Olympic Committee held a news<br />
conference following the President's announcement. He said there<br />
would now be a poll of the athletes to see if they favoured<br />
competing in Moscow. He added that it was significant that the<br />
President had made it very clear that he recognised the Olympic<br />
movement as part of the private sector.<br />
Radio Moscow has reported President Carter's recommendation without<br />
comment but quoted what it called, observers as saying his move to<br />
exert pressure was futile. There has been little reaction yet from<br />
other countries. However the Egyptian Sports Minister has said </p>
<p>2<br />
that Egypt was seriously considering pulling out of the Moscow<br />
Gamnes unless Soviet troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan. A<br />
spokesman for the West German Government says it had great<br />
understanding for the President's move but the spokesman made it<br />
clear that the Government could not order West German sports<br />
organisations to boycott the Games. Meanwhile the President of<br />
the International Olympic Committee has remained firm in his<br />
opposition to a boycott of the Games or their transfer -to another<br />
venue. President Tito's doctors are said to be satisfied with the outcome<br />
of the operation to amputate his left leg. Yugoslav officials<br />
said the 87 year old president was feeling well in the circumstances<br />
when he awakened after lengthy anaesthesia. Doctors said the<br />
amputation was the only way to save his life. They believe the<br />
next three days will be critical as there is still some danger of<br />
further blood clotting. But President Tito's chances of living for<br />
a considerable period of time are said to be good.<br />
The Carter Administration believes that Muslim militants holidng<br />
the American Embassy in Teheran have forced three of their hostages<br />
to send propaganda letters to American newspapers. A spokesman<br />
for the State Department says he can only conclude that much of<br />
what the hostages said in some twenty letters to newspapers was<br />
probably written at the request of the captors. The letters. sounded<br />
very muchl like the material used by same three hostages in a<br />
televised news conference they gave at Christmas time.<br />
The Federal Government will launch a health programme in three<br />
centres next month to persuade people to look after themselves.<br />
Mr. MacKellar today announced that the programme would be tested in<br />
Adelaide, Goulburn and idi Canberra for six weeks.<br />
Rhodesia: An election rally for Mr. Nkomo was nearly called off<br />
yesterday after mobs assaulted police. Peter Sharpe reports.<br />
The Federal Opposition says many food processors should again be<br />
forced to notify the PJT of price increases. The Opposition<br />
Spokesman on Industry and Commerce said today the need was evident<br />
from the PJT's report into the processed foods industry released<br />
at the weekend. The report said some retailers sold old stock at<br />
new prices and that their higher profit margin had increasedinflation.<br />
He said that although the Government has dismembered<br />
the PJT it was still capable of valuable work. He said the<br />
Government should return to the PJT the functions of examining and<br />
reporting on retailers' margins including their food profits. It<br />
should also include reintroducing notification of price increases<br />
by many of the food processors.<br />
In South American at least 46 people were killed and some 500 injured<br />
when a grandstand collapsed at a bull ring in Columbia.<br />
The Australian film ' Mad Max' has won an award at a French festival<br />
for -films on horror and violence. 000---</p>
