TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MJFNISTER, THE HON P. 3. KEATING; Nip,<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, THEATRrE~ PARLIAMENT HOUSES<br />
WELLLINGTON, 21 MAY 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM-Good afternoon. I might just Opel) uip with a few introductory comments and<br />
invite you to then put questionis. I will begin by saying that this has been a<br />
valuable opportunity for me to talk to Prime Minister Bolger ad the cabinet of<br />
New Zealand and it is of course the first opportunity I have had to go ira<br />
86n4 the election, The opportunity presented has been an important one for<br />
two countries which enjoy a very close relationship, two peoples who enjoy a<br />
close relationship and where conternporafy issues can be discussed and<br />
advanced. We have had useiM talks on a whole rangje of bilateral issues as well as the<br />
international issues in such areas of course as the Uruguay round and in APEC<br />
where the New Zealand view and the Australian view is pretty much at one and<br />
where in we seek to try and integrate our two economies with the region<br />
ground us in the same way as we have integrated with each other.<br />
On the bilateral issues the subjects we covered were taxation, the trans-Ta-sman<br />
travel arrangements, social security, inmmigration pre-clearance in relation to<br />
domestic airline travel or international travel at domestic terminals, mutual<br />
recognition of standards and defence relations. There may be a few other<br />
extraneous niattets which have entered into discussion, but they art principal<br />
topics. So I'd be very glad to take questions from you.<br />
J: Prime Ministr... over the welfa-re pAymnts?<br />
PM-We discuss . ed the wclfare payments and we have agreed to expedite negotiation<br />
aimed at a more equitable arrangement for Australia and this will focus on<br />
pensions and long term allowances and I think relevant mninisters are going to<br />
mcet next month so our travel arrangements of course facilitate an exchaenge of<br />
people that Australia doesn't facilitate with other countries and therefore this<br />
occasion arisc-b41 our social security systemn where trorn time to time situations<br />
emerge wherein Austradias case, iin this instance Australia is carrying a<br />
disproportionate level of the burden or the cost and I think the Government of<br />
New Zealand recognises that and it is whky I think we have alrvady been </p>
<p>TEL: 22. May. 935 19: D NIJ. VVZ .4-L<br />
2<br />
discussing It and why today we have agreed to expedite that discussion in the<br />
near fu~ ture.<br />
J: So without looking a bit crass you are going to get more money?<br />
PM: It ha been the historic truth of the situation that people who have spent a large<br />
part of their life in Now Zealand have for a minior period of their working life<br />
come to Auqtralia and then been in receipt of an Australian pension and that<br />
means that we are carrying a substantial burden that would otherwise be carried<br />
in New Zealand,<br />
Are you looking at extending agreement to include pensioners who have<br />
been in Australia longer than that period or do you want to add new classes of<br />
beneficiaries to those established already?<br />
PM: We are not talking about unemployment beneficiaries or benefits which are of a<br />
short term nature, only a long terni tiature, We did come to an agreement in<br />
1999 about the methodology of picking tip costs for people after that point.<br />
This is about going back, looking at the burden that we are now carrying, but<br />
again on rules that are sensible and equitable and fair for both sides,<br />
J: Mr Keating, how can Now Zealand and New Zealanders avoid Australians or<br />
prevent Australians from thinking that this country and the people in it will<br />
want to bludge on Australia?<br />
PM. I don't think that is true at all. I don't think Australians think that at all. But<br />
that is not to say that there won't be issues from time to time which arise like<br />
this one. We have had other social security type issues arise with other<br />
European countries for instance and I don't think the Australian community<br />
would conclude from that that they were to use your words, about to bludge<br />
on us. It is just an issue that oeeds to be dealt with and I don't think people<br />
should read more into it than it is.<br />
1; Prime Minister, do you think New Zealand can maintain a credible defence<br />
posture in the South Pacific with Australia while it remains outside or excluded<br />
from the ANZUS alliance or would you prefer to see New Zealand back in?<br />
PM: That is a matter for New Zesland, New Zealand and its relationship with the<br />
United States. The ANZUS alliance is an allitince of value to Australia, I think<br />
it is an alliance. of value to the United States. It was concluded at a time when<br />
there was a premium on such alliances. I don't think such a premi~ um exists in<br />
the United States today. So it is an alliance of value and it is one which the<br />
Australian goverinent puts substantial store in and makes substantial defence<br />
eff'orts on its own part to meet. or course, were New Zealand to decide to<br />
becorme a full parter again in ANZUS that must of itself, strengthen~ the<br />
ANZUS alliance. But the allian~ ce still remains, Australia still has, exercises with<br />
the United States forces from time to time and not only that, of course we<br />
have regular ministerial consultations between the Secretary of State and<br />
defencc secretaries of the United States and the appropriate defence and </p>

foreign afibirs ministers of Australia, So it is for us a fully operationa l aljce<br />
and one which we go to lengths to keep the tone on. I think the other issue<br />
which we did discuss this morning is the thing about the role of defence<br />
generally and national. efforts towards defence and I did expres the view to<br />
Prime Minister Bolger and to the Cabinet that it is important for both our<br />
countries to be able to maintain a minimal, at least a miinimnum credible defence<br />
as the expression is used in New Zealand. Now we are spending about 2.4 per<br />
cent of GDP on defence, that has declined fiomn 2.9 to about 2.4 per cent and<br />
we have Yielded from our changes over the years substantial efficiency<br />
dividend New Zealand is spending now about 1. 1 per cent of GDP on<br />
defence and while there is no doubt that efficiencies have been yielded if you<br />
like, brought to bear in that process, I1th ink it is important to say that it is<br />
important for both our countries that New Zealand does indeed have a credible<br />
defence policy in place. Prime Minister Bolger agrees with that as does his<br />
Cabinet and that is an issue which I think is of fundamental importance<br />
whatever ones view of the ANZUS overlay mi~ Iit be.<br />
J: ( inaudible) credible defence policy?<br />
PM:, No, we are not in a position to second guess and don't attempt to seconld guess<br />
New Zealand about its defence spending, but it is important to keep core forces<br />
in place. These are not things you can build up quickly. Defence experience<br />
and capacity is something which is built tip over a long pvriod of time and that<br />
experience and operability and all the rest can if it dindnishes, can take a very<br />
long time to repair.<br />
I Prime Minister, so you wouldn't necessarily see out of this an agreement for<br />
New Zealand is to increase their defence spending?<br />
PM: We didn't ask for a commnitment ftrm New Zealand, but the Prime Minister<br />
made it clear that they wouldn't be spending any less on defence.<br />
J: Prime minister, are you convinced that the New Zealand Labor party is also<br />
committed to a credible defence policy?<br />
PM: I am seeing the Leader of the Opposition after I see you and I'm sure he will<br />
take about that subject.<br />
J: Ptrme Minister, is it your view that the purchase of one or two ANZAC frigates<br />
by New Zealand is sufficient to core a New Zealand credible defence force?<br />
pM: I think credible defence goes more than material purchases or<br />
procurement or weapons procurement in their own righit. It is a total thing<br />
which is operational forces, combat readiness, capacity logistics as well as<br />
equipment. These are very sophisticated issues which require sophisticated<br />
judgements and most defence mainistfles and armed services try and imake thosc<br />
judgements aU the time. The important thing is I think that ( he Government of<br />
New Zealand is convinced itself that its policies can maintain a credible<br />

4<br />
minimum defence posture because that is of material importance to Australia or<br />
the integration Of Australian and New Zealand forces,<br />
3: How long before minimui core is increasing over the years as Asian nations<br />
increase their defence capability which they are doing already?<br />
PM: It depends I think what ones strategic outlook is and in which way one is<br />
planning ones defence force. Ours has been substantially re-oriented to the<br />
defence of Australia rather than as it was earlier participation with US forces<br />
in the Pacific. That change occurred in the 1 980s and if the key criteria is<br />
defence of ones own land mass and interests then I think that in a sense<br />
describes the policy rather then reference to what someone else is doing nearby.<br />
Whatever someone else is doing would be always part of some strategic<br />
assessment, that has to be fed into any cailculation. But again I don't think<br />
there is any mechanical link between what someone else is doing and what we<br />
that is Australia or New Zealand might be doing.<br />
1; Is there any scope for ifurther integrating the defence policies?<br />
PM-. As the Prime M~ inister said over lunch, there is a lot of defence co-operation;<br />
we call it CDR occurring between Australia and New Zealand and I can only<br />
wish and believe that that will continue.<br />
J. Are you saying though that CDR is in danger of<br />
PM:. No, because the Prime Minister takes the view that the maintenance of a<br />
mi~ nimal credible force Is paramount in public policy. That is the key judgement<br />
for us,<br />
P What issues were raised in the taxation context..<br />
PM. Two things: the re-writing of our double tax agreement between the two<br />
counitries which is now quite an Old docullent and so much has changed of<br />
course, and it needs to reflcet that change and the other is the question of<br />
mutual recognition of dividends, dividend imputation and progress on that<br />
issue. The problem for us an that issue is that the preservation of the integrity<br />
of the Australian tax system and there are of course ma * ny Australian companies<br />
investinS all around the world, and the precedent problem for us is were we to<br />
provide imputed dividend cre~ dits, the tax paid to another Treasury, the<br />
Treasury of another country in this case New Zealand the pressure would<br />
come on to Australia to pay imputation credits for tax paid to the German<br />
Treasury or the British Treasury and other places where Australian companies<br />
have $ one abroad.<br />
J: Are you effectively ruling it out?<br />
PM-I think what we arc saying is for the moment is that we are not ready at this<br />
stage to agree to a change in dividend imputation. If we are prepared to leave<br />
it tinder discussion so that if ways can be found of dealing with the quarantining </p>
<p>TEL'<br />
problem we will examine them. But there is also another great difference in<br />
the tax systems of New Zealand and Australia and that is New Zealand does<br />
not have a capital gains tax and Australia does. So companies could take their<br />
incomne profits in Australia and their capital profits in New Zealand and again<br />
this would not necessarily guarantee the objectives of such a change for us.<br />
J1: If Australia's focus on actually Sctting greater reparation from New Zealand or<br />
on minimisinS eligibility for frequent pay outs..<br />
PM: We have a very tight social security system, there is an assets test and income<br />
test and over the period of time with the social security review teams and the<br />
rest we have got now by world standards a fairly tight system. So eligibility is<br />
not I think as primacy here, it is just a question of the balance of the costs<br />
which in this case for about 270,000 New Zealanders, 30,000 of whom are<br />
taking pensions in Australia, means that the great body of the burden falls upon<br />
the Australian budget and given that this occurs principally because of travel<br />
arrangeeznts between us that therefore it needs to be remedied.<br />
I: Australian government prepared to recognise, these tax contributions<br />
working between<br />
PM-I think we do and vice versa, but that I don't think deals with this problem at<br />
all.<br />
3: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Yes, I was happy to reaffirm the strength of the existing arrangements. I think<br />
they have worked well that is basically the avenue by which there is an<br />
exchange of people between the two countries and it works well and I amn very<br />
happy to endorse those arrangements.<br />
3: What did you decide on iim'igrafion..<br />
PM: Thac we should like to be able to establish a pre-clearance regime by the end of<br />
1993. We agreed to make every effort to do that and we are originally<br />
targeting November, there mnay be a bit of slippage in that, but it would be very<br />
nice to do it if we could before the end of 1993 because this will facilitate flying<br />
between domnestic terminals. So it would be international carriage of people,<br />
but to domestic terminal to domestic terminal wvhich means immigration preclearance<br />
and customs and quarantine clearance would obtain at the domestic<br />
terininals, I can't think of any better way of removing impediments to people<br />
travelling between the two countries than to travel through the domestic<br />
terminals and this of course, will mean also enhanced opportunities for the<br />
airlines and those enhanced opportunities can only mean that the tourist<br />
industry between both countries is ernhanced. B~ oth of our countries rely upon a<br />
substantial services sector of which tourism is a rapidly growing part and<br />
therefore getting this done and getting it in place has to be a good thing for<br />
tourism between Australia and New Zealand and of course, in that the airlines<br />
and need I say that this arrangernent is part of a larger arrangement where<br />

AuStrelia has already agreed beyond rights for New Zealand Ailines out of<br />
Australia to North America arxd to Asia. SO it is not a policy which sits alone,<br />
it is pan of a broader Policy Of a closer integration of our two airline markets<br />
into a single airline market,<br />
3: Prime MInlister, you said in your discussions today in termns of benefits for the<br />
long term like superannuation, do you anticipate at somne stage You Will have to<br />
look at things like the uneCMPloyment benefit?<br />
PM: It has not been On the agenda at this Point in our discussion and I think from<br />
Our Point of view it is that these Mre payments of a shorter term duration, there<br />
is a flux of people moving backwards and forwards, there is not so obvious a<br />
longer termi cost and so therefore I think it is wise for us to concentrate on the<br />
longer term benefits and pensions, aged pensions in particular. I think it is<br />
possible to arrive at a formula where this can be reasonably well constructed,<br />
operate effectively and efficiently and make the system just that much fairer.<br />
Are YOU going to flee up thle travel between the countries is there going to<br />
be mnore New Zealanders with freer access?<br />
FM: The mode of travel would be freer, more subtle, but the basis of the travel is no<br />
freer than what is now eminently free. That is virtually visa free entry into<br />
Australia. Do you resent that New Zealand will have a credible defence policy if it doesn't<br />
increase its..<br />
PM: r sot asked that earlier. I responded to that earlier.<br />
P: Prime Minister, regarding yourvisit to the Savage memorial, are you the New<br />
Zealand government to praise the value and ideals of...<br />
PM: I don't know whether that is supposed to be a leading question. You have a<br />
fusrry thing in your hand there, I take it it is a microphone and that you want<br />
therefore an approprite flurry answer I suppose. I was able to say in -my<br />
remarks a few minutes ago at lunch that I think the thing about these countries<br />
is they are deeply democratic countries. When you say in countries like New<br />
Zealand and Australia, you inake a speech to the Parliamentary folk, you say<br />
these are demnocracies, people say oh yes% d emocracies, but democracies like<br />
ours are few and as old as ours are few. This is a very old democracy in New<br />
Zealand as is Australia's and it is the transmission of demnocratic values around<br />
the world is I think one of the things we do best. With that democracy has<br />
come I think in both societies a deep sense of tolerance. I think tolerance<br />
comes from ones sense of democracy, an innate sense of democracy and the<br />
tolerance has led to different kinds of societies being developed. A different<br />
society here In New Zeal and say to Europc. Certaitfly a different society in<br />
Australia than say Europe, indeed different socictics between Australia and<br />
New Zealand, thcse are different places. That tolerance has also Itik<br />
produced a view of society, a view about the role of ilovernment and the role </p>
<p>22. May. 93 19to N'u. u-<br />
TEL: 7<br />
of society which has seen both Australia and New Zealand break many of' the<br />
muoulds of social justice and break them in a way which enhance the social<br />
agenda of both countries. I think Michael Savage when he was Prime Minister<br />
did these things. We have continued in our couritty to do these things and<br />
much of the Australian election just passed, the debate was about these things.<br />
There is a role for government. but again too substantial a role for government<br />
is disruptive of private investment and in the end employment, so it is a matter<br />
of finding that balance, to do what i3 fair and just and sensible and at the same<br />
tune pay appropriate due to that sense of democracy and tolerance that Is in<br />
our society and that sense of fairness which comnes froin it. So I think that the<br />
work of great pioneers and 1 think you have to put the former Labor Prime<br />
Minister Michael Savage in that class has laid down the style of New Zealand<br />
life, the sort of society it is, That is not to say these things are immutable, can<br />
never be changed or shouldn't be changed; of course governments will come<br />
along and chop and change them all the time, but the values which arm them I<br />
don't think are going to change and I think that is the good thing.<br />
Prime Minister, going back to your comments on tax you said as I understood<br />
it that Australia was not able to move towairds imputation of dividends because<br />
if you did that it would set a precedent on the countries to have follow. Does<br />
that comment not belie the relationship that the two countries have under the<br />
CER agreement and the progress that has been made on that agrecment?<br />
PM: Yes, but I'm quite sure the US Commerce Department will immediately write<br />
to the Australian Treasurer and say we want the same for us were we to<br />
introduce a dividend imputation system or any other country which wants to<br />
claim the same benefit. But certainly the companies of Australia will seek the<br />
beniefit, they are already seeking it, they have been seeking it for years and were<br />
we to conceive the benefit in New Zealand they will seek it more strongly for<br />
Western Europe, North America, the Asia Pacific.<br />
J: But you have free trading goods and services with New Zealand and you don't<br />
give that to every other country.<br />
pm: No, that is true, but again it is a matter of where th~ e antecedcnts of the<br />
argument come from and this one I think tie argument is that we should give<br />
tax credit for tax paid to a foreign treasury. Now I don't agree with that.<br />
While we would like to see businesses in this country in New Zealand and<br />
Australia integrate more closely, but again it is worth recording we have<br />
already seen an enormous integration of investment between the two countries<br />
particularly since the early 1980s-enormous growth in investment. The other<br />
problem is of course, were Ncw Zealand to extend its imputationl System to<br />
other countries, were it to decide on a few bilaterals on the side, then people<br />
will bring dividends through New Zealand which will end up costing us so we<br />
are defacto extending our imputation system to other countries via New<br />
Zealand and the problem then is saying, we will withdraw the imputation<br />
credits, once businesses have established themselves oil the basis of such credit<br />
you can barely then say, it is possible to say, but ctrtainly business would resist<br />
it, any Australian government sayinu that the beiiefis now be withdrawn, So </p>
<p>2 2 . M a y .93 1 9 3D N o u u r<br />
S<br />
were we to extend this to New Zealand wed have to have a vezy clear<br />
covenant that it would not be extended elsewhere by New Zealand. These are<br />
all the issues involved and that is why I say at the moment we are not ready to<br />
agree, but we are quite happy to continue examining the policy implications.<br />
3: Prime Minister, your relationship with Mr Bolger, has that been affected at all<br />
by earlier comnents about Joan Kirner?<br />
PM: Earlier, that's much earlier. Months earlier,<br />
1: So exactly what sort of relationship do you have with Mr Bolger?<br />
PM: Very good I think. He is as you know , an affable, easy going, easy to talk to<br />
person who is conscientious about his country's interests and very savvy about<br />
the relationship between Australia and New Zealand and about the issues<br />
involved, So I find dealing with him and on the issues, but beyond that just<br />
knowing him to be a very easy thing to do,<br />
J. Can you say what progress has been made on mutual recognition?<br />
PM: One of the good things is that we do have quite unique, I made reference at<br />
lunch to the fact that New Zealand ministers meet with Conunonwealth and<br />
State ministers of Australia in so many of these functional areas of our<br />
economies and our societies and we have been seeking as States of Australia to<br />
develop a set of uniform, mutual standards so that we don't have one standard<br />
in Melbourne and a different-standard in Sydney or Victoria or NSW as the<br />
case may be. And in that of course, it becomes an obvious thing to extend that<br />
uniformity of standards, classification of standards across the Tasman so that<br />
Australasia has the same standards In these respects and we are making<br />
progress there and I'm sure we'll make substantial progress together on this in<br />
the ensuing period.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM. There is a formula that is being discussed, there has been a formula discussed<br />
about,.<br />
3: have you put in any idea of how much the Australian government would<br />
consider reasonable?<br />
PM: You must write for a tabloid do you? No. no I haven't.<br />
3: When will you be announcing the details<br />
PM; We are going to meet I think in a couple of months, within three months there<br />
is going to be another mereting of our respcctive ninistcrs.<br />
