OPENING A~ ND DEDICATION OF WHITLEY COLLEGE,<br />
UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE 27TH F-bmuaiY, 1265<br />
Ãµ iec y h rg Ministej r e. hRt oj! 2L._ Sir ~ bt en e<br />
Mr. Chairman, Mr. President and Ladies and Gentlemen t<br />
If you look at your programme you will see that<br />
you are about to listen to an oration. ( Laughter) This is<br />
a sort of university practice. In some cases I an called on<br />
to make a speech. In some cases, rather deceptively, to say<br />
a few words; ( Laughter) but at any university gathering it<br />
turns out to be an oration, but I assure you it won't be.<br />
What I find myself cast for now, having listened<br />
to my predecessors, is a few supplementary observations,<br />
supplementary in particular to what Sir Leslie Martin has<br />
said to you. I have had the great good fortune to have been<br />
mixed up a little in the recent university developments in<br />
Australia. I remember that not long after I came back into<br />
office I think it was in 1950 or 1951 we appointed a<br />
committee to have a look at the immediate needs of the<br />
universities. It was, looking back on it, a singularly<br />
modest committee because it didn't cost us very much a<br />
million or two and it seemed very cheap at the time, But<br />
when it was conducting its discussions, it came to my knowledge<br />
that at least one person connected with it had said there<br />
ought to be no recommendation about residential colleges,<br />
because they were luxuries, and if people wanted to have a<br />
luxury of that kind, they should pay for it.<br />
I thought this was a barbarous sentiment, and<br />
being younger then I am now, more audacious than I am now<br />
and more domineering than I am now I said " Unless you make<br />
a report which includes something lor residential colleges,<br />
I won't have the report at all," And so we got the first<br />
little morsel, but we established a very important principle.<br />
Then later on, as you know, ife appointed the<br />
Murray Commission. We were very lucky to secure the services<br />
of a man like Murray. He was a consummate expert on these<br />
matters. W,, e had a powerful committee, and we had a Treasurer<br />
who, when I broke the news to him and told him about the<br />
committee and told him thiat it would turn out to bo very<br />
expensive relaxed and took it very well. He needed to,<br />
when the till came in. Well, that began another great era,<br />
and you have been reminded the Murray Committee recommended a<br />
provision for residential colleges. Another of the recommendations<br />
that the Committee made was that we should establish<br />
a universities commission of our owm in Australia and we did,<br />
and we had the singular good fortune to persuade Sir Leslie<br />
Martin to become its chairman.<br />
I know that he-has had a difficult job. I go<br />
into university circles occasionally and I find thnt he is<br />
not as generous as he should be. Wiell, if I walked around<br />
the corners of the Treasury they would say, " This man is<br />
becoming positively lush". ( Laughter) But wherever I go,<br />
I will hear some criticism but I will hear a paeon of praise<br />
from most people. I don't think everybody understands what<br />
a difficult problem it is to have a universities commission, </p>
<p>2-<br />
to be on a universities commission, and above all things,<br />
to be its presiding member. Because universities are growing<br />
enormously in their student population we have more universities<br />
coming into existence, we have a demand for higher education<br />
in Australia which is at once exciting and stimulating and<br />
almost overwhelming, If you had a look at the statistics<br />
11rhich the commission itself produces from time to time, its<br />
forecasts of what will be the demand upon universities over<br />
the next two or three or twenty or thirty years, you would<br />
come to the conclusion that for our population there is no<br />
other country in the world that is generating such an eager<br />
desire for education in all its forms as we are in Australia.<br />
This is an enormous and complex task, and I want to take the<br />
opportunity of saying to Sir Leslie, in his presence, that I<br />
think he has laid the whole country under his debt for the<br />
way he has done his work. ( Applause)<br />
Now he gave you some figures. I am no great<br />
believer in cluttering up remarks with statistics but I<br />
think the first beginning Sir Leslie, ( that was before your<br />
time) was Å 20,000 or Å 30 600 some token item. Well in<br />
the 1958/ 60 triennium, tjat Is the first one under the recommendations<br />
of the Murray Committee, Å. 600,000 was provided<br />
that is by the Commonwealth Å C600,000 for the purposes of<br />
residential colleges which now, of course includes halls of<br />
residence in some of the universities, fn the next<br />
triennium 1961/ 2/ 3, the Å E600,000 had risen to CIM. This<br />
merely whet their appetite, because in the 1964/ 65/ 66 triennium,<br />
the Commonwealth is finding, or is prepared to provide, just<br />
under Å 3jM. for this purpose.<br />
Now you think of that in terms of growth a few<br />
thousand, Å C600,000, ZiM, Å C3iM. It's going almost by<br />
geometrical progression, and therefore I smile when I look<br />
back on the doubting Thomas who thought that residential<br />
colleges were a luxury instead of being as they indeed are<br />
of the very essence of a true university.<br />
Now I am going to give you, as briefly as possible,<br />
three reasons I think one or two have already been referred<br />
to, at any rate but I will put them in my own way. I think<br />
one of the great dangers today in our universities with this<br />
rapid growth is that as the demand for teachers, for staff<br />
grows, and as the difficulties of securing staff of adequate<br />
standards grow, so will there tend to be an increasing<br />
remoteness between teacher and students. dJe put that comically<br />
by saying that there ought to be a certain ratio, that there<br />
ought to be a certain limit to classes, but sheer necessity<br />
will tend to produce a state of affairs, temporarily, at any<br />
rate, in which the teacher happens to be, or -, ppears to be,<br />
far removed from his individual students,<br />
Now this is, in its ways a minor tragedy, if it<br />
is a bed teacher perhaps it is good to have a suitable<br />
distance, but if it is a good teacher, it is a thousand<br />
pities that the people who are in his class in their year<br />
for any purpose should fail to come under the spell of his<br />
own personality, to fail to cultivate an attitude of mind,<br />
which in a sense subconsciously they've borrowed from him.<br />
donderful thing lor any man I don't care if he's a scientist<br />
or lawyer or whatever it may be to be able to look back on<br />
his university and postgraduate days and say "* Jell, I worked<br />
under So-and-so" I with a gleam of pride in his eye and a / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
feeling of indebtedness in his heart. And therefore there<br />
is a great danger in remoteness,<br />
Now here we have a new university college,<br />
' e have others just, in effect, over the road. They have<br />
their own tutorial people. They will have closer contact<br />
in college than many of their colleagues in the university<br />
proper may hope to have with a great number of their own<br />
pupils. This, in this sense, is a contribution to bridging<br />
that gap, to removing that sense of remoteness that is liable<br />
to exist in future between the staff and the students,<br />
Well, that's one thing.<br />
Then, of course, there is the second thing.<br />
Sir Leslie Martin referred to it, A good deal of the education<br />
in a university is imparted by undergraduates. I don't<br />
mind undergraduates like us my own kind, who were perfectly<br />
ready under provocation to Instruct the professor or the<br />
lecturer ( Laughter). I was once invited by the late<br />
Professor Tucker, that great classical scholar, to come down<br />
and take the class myself as he felt he wasn't competent<br />
to do it. I refused his invitation ( Laughter) to nobody's<br />
surprise. But undergraduates do instruct each other because<br />
of their contacts, because of the different disciplilos in<br />
which they are working. It's of tremendous importance that<br />
a man for example, doing science, shouldn't run away with<br />
the ilea that science is the be-all and the end-all of life.<br />
It is a very good thing for him to have to sit down with<br />
another student who is studying law or a student studying<br />
arts, or whatever it may be, and thrash out their differences<br />
of outlook. This produces, in the long run, a most valuable<br />
education, It justifies the word " university", the universitas<br />
that can be produced by these contacts, by argument, by<br />
quarrels if you like, by any other means. One branch of<br />
study rubs off on to the other and produces a broader outlook.<br />
I know the Principal who I find is a WJelshmnan<br />
and a Baptist ( simultaneously) 4aughter) I knowt the<br />
Principal would say, " Of course, that doesn't apply to the<br />
theological students", or perhaps he wion't say that. In<br />
my time, theological students or some of them, badly needed<br />
close association with respectable law students, ( Laughter)<br />
There are a few ex-theological students here today, I can<br />
detect I think and they will understand exactly what I mean.<br />
But whatever it is, never let anybody per-suade you that you<br />
have made an error by creating a university college, by<br />
creating these facilities for contact and dispute and some<br />
gathering of some aspect of the other man's study and the<br />
other man's point of view, because I believe that if<br />
everybody going to a university of course this is<br />
impossible but if everybody had the opportunity of living<br />
with other students and debating and arguing with other students<br />
we would produce a breadth of outlook in the Australia of the<br />
fut. ure which would be the greatest triumph of the twentieth<br />
century. Then I want to add my third observation. This<br />
college is a colle~ e established by the members of the<br />
Baptist community. There are other colleges connected<br />
with the university established primarily by various<br />
denominations, by various churches. I want to repeat what<br />
I have said many, many times in Australia, that I believe<br />
that education reaches its highest point when it is 000000^. </p>
<p>conducted against a background of religion, and yet it is a<br />
background which constantly reminds the student that however<br />
clever he may be he is not his own maker, however self-confident<br />
he may think he is, he is living in a world not created by him,<br />
that he has responsibilities, that he has great inheritances,<br />
that he is responsible in his own proper fashion for the people<br />
who come after him, and this spirit is one which has never<br />
developed so completel~ y in the institution which doesn't have<br />
a background of religion, a background of faith, a background<br />
of humility because that after all, must be the inevitable<br />
product of religious belief,<br />
And here is a church college it's young, its<br />
name is an honourable name, the name of a great pioneer in this<br />
field. It will grow, of course. It may expand into other<br />
forms, but I confidently believe that out of all the hundreds<br />
nd hundreds and ultimnately thousands of students who come out<br />
of this college, you will find, or expect to find very few<br />
who have not ackno: rledged the debt that they owe to those who<br />
had enough wisdom and o,-r. rugh faith in God to establish this<br />
College, to accept its labours, its difficulties all the<br />
problems to do so because of their complete faith in the<br />
value of their -, ork.<br />
Sir, this Is no oration and indeed it is painfully<br />
repetitive, but it is true and truth needs to be spoken in<br />
season and out of season if we are not to forget it,<br />
Sir, it is a great honour to be allowed to be here<br />
today, a very great privilege to address you and a very great<br />
and particular pleasure to me to be on the platform writh men<br />
who are contributing so much to the life of our nation. </p>
