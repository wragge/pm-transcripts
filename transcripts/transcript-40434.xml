Shinzo, it is so good to see you. We’ve had some very good discussions in Hangzhou in the course of the G20 but it is a good time now to have a more formal discussion with our officials. We have so much in common, so many shared perspectives, shared commitments to the rule of law as a guiding principle in international relations and, of course, our strong special strategic partnership which gets stronger all the time, at every level. And on strategic security, it is a very strong bond and one which I know that we have been able to strengthen during our time we’ve been prime ministers at the same time.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate you on your recent electoral victory - well done. It’s good to be on a strong basis to discuss the future and the very important shared agendas we have to ensure peace and stability in our region and continued growth and prosperity in our region and especially, of course, around Japan and Australia.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN - TRANSLATION:</strong><br />
Welcome and I would like to express my congratulations to your decisive victory after the double dissolution of the houses as well as your reappointment as the Prime Minister. Also, [inaudible] myself by going through the difficult upper house election in Japan. I am very delighted to note that we also have shared this opportunity to continue working together [inaudible] peace as well as stability under the banner of Japan-Australia’s special strategic partnership, together with you. I do believe that ensuring our close cooperation between the two nations, we share fundamental values in this increasingly severe security environment in East Asia will eventually lead to our common goal of assuring regional stability, as well as peace. Another area where I see a potential for us to further promote our bilateral cooperation is the global economy which has become more and more [inaudible] as we discussed on location at the G20 Summit. Also, on this occasion, I would like to share with you my commitment to working closely with you so as to have a successful East Asia Summit.</p>
