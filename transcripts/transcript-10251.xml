27 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS AT THE MELBOURNE PRESS CLUB'S<br />
ANNUAL JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR AWARDS<br />
GRAND HYATT, MELBOURNE<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Mr Steve Harris; to all the other distinguished guests, in<br />
particularly to Mrs Perkins; to all of my colleagues in political pursuit because<br />
journalists and politicians have a very special relationship.<br />
I once wrote down on a form that was circulated in the final year, when I was at<br />
Canterbury Boys High School in Sydney in the 1950s, what were my employment<br />
preferences. And I have to confess of the three that I wrote down not one of them at<br />
that stage was politics because I thought you had to do something else before you<br />
went into politics. But one of the three that I did write down was journalism. And<br />
I've frequently been accused by some of my colleagues and occasionally by some of<br />
my friends in the media, I've frequently been accused of being something of a<br />
frustrated journalist. And in fact in one of my periods of political obscurity the<br />
months or so that followed my removal as Opposition Leader in May of 1989 I, in<br />
fact, did try my hand at writing columns for The Australian newspaper and it was<br />
something that I enjoyed immensely.<br />
I've always taken quite seriously the relationship between politicians and the press.<br />
I've taken that relationship rather vigorously on occasions as well as I think all political<br />
figures inevitably do. And I hope I don't sound in any way trite or patronising or just<br />
going through the motions of saying the sort of thing that a Prime Minister or a<br />
political leader is expected to say on an occasion like this in telling you how important<br />
I regard both the role of the news media in Australia in both reporting and commenting<br />
upon politics in Australia and how much I value a professional, direct and honest<br />
association between political participants and the news media.<br />
Like all politicians I've felt on occasions over my political career that particular issues<br />
haven't been reported, on occasions, quite as they should have been. I have to say, </p>
<p>and I was asked the question by Steve Harris before I got up to speak how I thought<br />
I'd been treated over the last year and it will be of course a year this weekend since<br />
my Government was elected, the first coalition government to govern Australia for 13<br />
years and I made the observation in reply that I thought by and large making<br />
allowances, and on some occasions some sizeable allowances, in some areas for some<br />
shortcomings, I thought that by and large my Government had received reasonable and<br />
fair treatment from the news media of Australia. I hope that I'll be able to say that in<br />
another year's time and another year after that and another year after that again. You<br />
will all have your ideas and your own views as to whether I've been treated gently,<br />
harshly or treated just about right.<br />
I'd like to say a couple of things about the, I suppose, the juxtaposition of the different<br />
areas of the media in Australia and the way in which it reports federal politics.<br />
In Australia, as in most other western democratic societies we tend to have a national<br />
capital city gallery. In Australia it's a little different that we also have a very strong<br />
reporting of federal politics at a State capital city and regional level. It is very<br />
important that that balance continue.<br />
There is obviously great merit in having a Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery<br />
composed of people who have spent a fair amount of time in Canberra, who draw most<br />
of their exchanges and intellectual nourishment, inevitably their prejudices and their<br />
biases and own particular points of view from personal interchange with people in the<br />
Federal capital. But it is also tremendously important that that be counterbalanced<br />
with a proper focus on national affairs by journalists who don't live in Canberra. It<br />
would be a great mistake for the reporting of federal politics in Australia to ever<br />
become the exclusive preserve of the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery. And one<br />
can see inevitable and subtle, and not so subtle differences emerging between the<br />
reporting of federal politics by the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery and the<br />
reporting of federal politics outside of the federal capital.<br />
I think one of the possible explanations and I say this choosing my words carefully,<br />
not out of any sensitivity but simply because I think it's one of those cases that is<br />
probably only just proven I think one of the reasons why the Coalition's victory in<br />
March of last year was rather greater than many people, including a lot of people in the<br />
Coalition including myself at various stages during the election campaign ever thought<br />
it might be, was that there was a fair gap between the perception of the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Press Gallery of some of the things that really mattered in that campaign<br />
and the views of people outside of Canberra, and most particularly in the context of my<br />
remarks, the views of people who reported federal politics and spoke about them in the<br />
major cities and the regional areas of Australia.<br />
There is a Canberra view about politics, It's a very legitimate view. It's a proper<br />
view. It's an informed view. And in most cases it's a quite intensely professional<br />
view. There is also another view about national politics and the priorities are often<br />
different. And the treatment of certain issues which were high on the agenda of the<br />
former government by people in the Canberra Press Gallery was often disproportionate<br />
to the importance attached to those issues by other sections of the Australia<br />
community. Now that is not to demean the importance of those issues nor is it to </p>
<p>demean the professional role of the Parliamentary Press Gallery but merely to<br />
emphasise something that is probably very apparent to all of you and that is that the<br />
way in which politics is reported can often vary very greatly around the country and<br />
most sharply between the way it is reported out of the national capital and the way it is<br />
reported in the rest of the country.<br />
These particular awards I know have played a very major role in the life of your<br />
profession here in Melbourne. And it is particularly important of course that one of the<br />
awards, the Graham Perkin Award, honours the life and times and the contribution<br />
particularly to the Melbourne Age of a man who had an immense influence on<br />
journalism and on the media, especially here in Melbourne, but all around Australia.<br />
Many very young journalists have won their first recognition and acclaim through the<br />
' Young Journalist of the Year Award' which has been part of this particular event for<br />
quite a number of years.<br />
And I said in the beginning of my remarks how much I valued the role of the media in<br />
Australian politics. I've often been asked in the various positions I've occupied in<br />
politics my view on whether or not Australia should have a Bill of Rights. I must<br />
unashamedly say to you that I'm not much of a believer in Bills of Rights. I am very<br />
much a common law man. I tend to think that societies that try and write down in too<br />
much detail the fuindamental rights which are meant to govern the conduct of their<br />
citizens either end up in some way leaving something out or over-prescribing<br />
something. And generally the track record of those countries is no better than the<br />
track record of those countries that have adopted the common law approach.<br />
I've frequently said in answer to that question that if you really want to guarantee<br />
democracy in a nation you need three things. You need a vigorous and open<br />
parliamentary system. You need an incorruptible judiciary. And you need a vigilant,<br />
on occasions cranky and profoundly sceptical, media. I think those three things are<br />
really the essential pillars of a vigorous democratic society.<br />
When President Clinton was in Australia last year we spent quite a bit of time talking<br />
about the comparisons between Australia and the United States, the similarities<br />
between our two peoples and two societies. And we both agreed that something we<br />
obviously had in common was an informality, and in most cases in both countries and<br />
in both peoples a scorn for pretension and a dislike of class structures and class<br />
barriers. The President said what areas did I believe that we were different. And I said<br />
that one area where I thought Australians were quite different from Americans was<br />
that I thought Australians were a more sceptical and a more suspicious people,<br />
particularly of those who made decisions that affected their lives, and that meant him<br />
and me and those who carried on our prospective, mutual profession in both countries.<br />
And I think that is reflected in the media in this country.<br />
I think the media in this country is sceptical. I think it has a right to be sceptical. I<br />
think it's part of its role. It will on occasions be over sceptical and therefore draw very<br />
heavy and very legitimate criticism from other sections of the media and from people<br />
who are perhaps the object of that scepticism. But it is one of the three pillars of our<br />
society. I have my quarrels on occasions with sections of the media. I've been known </p>
<p>to pass some critical comments about one or two well-known sections of the media<br />
and I'll no doubt do it in the future. And there'll be many occasions when I feel that<br />
the reporting of what my Government has done is perhaps not as balanced and not as<br />
just and not as fair as it might have been.<br />
But in the long haul, having been in politics for now almost 23 years and having<br />
become after that career Prime Minister of Australia, I have to say that in that 23 year<br />
experience I think I've have experienced the lot. I've experienced very good press.<br />
I've experienced very bad press. I've experienced in the main a press that is, I think,<br />
representative of the Australian community.<br />
So I come here tonight as somebody who has both a professional association with the<br />
media of Australia, someone who has had more than a passing interest in the craft that<br />
you have practised, somebody who enjoys very much for its own sake the art of clear<br />
and direct expression. Elegant writing is something that's always a delight to read.<br />
And although there is a very heavy emphasis, and properly so, on television and radio<br />
and instant reporting of events I hope that we always have in our media in this country<br />
a very special place for the well researched, the elegantly written and the powerfully<br />
presented newspaper article. Because those contributions to journalism in Australia<br />
can have an enduring impact and they are an important part perhaps to borrow the<br />
analogy from a sport that you all know I love so much perhaps the test cricket part<br />
and the others are the one-day part of the total game.<br />
So to all of you, ladies and gentlemen, can I say the association that I have with the<br />
media of Australia is an association that will always have its interest, it will have its<br />
continuing vigour, it's continuing tension. I respect the role of the media. I'll criticise<br />
it on occasions. I'll disagree with it as it will with me. But the Australian democracy<br />
would be the poorer without it. It is a vigorous media, a very, very important pillar of<br />
the vigorous democracy that we all claim Australia really is.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
Ouestions Answers<br />
QUESTION: Steve Price from 3 AW, Prime Minister. One of the criticisms of yourself and your<br />
performance in the media is you're very Sydney-centric. You continue to give<br />
interviews to people like Alan Jones, John Laws and AM on the ABC. Are you<br />
actually aware that John Laws and Alan Jones and AM are listened to by very few<br />
people in Melbourne?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No. They keep telling me everybody listens to them. I'll take that question very<br />
seriously to heart. I don't set out to be Sydney-centric. I have been accused in the<br />
columns of at least one newspaper recently of being channel-centric, a particular<br />
channel-centric. I seem to have had a few appearances on one particular television<br />
channel purely by accident over the last few weeks. I don't set out to do that. I shall </p>
<p>take it very seriously. I shall carefully research what I have done and if there is a lack<br />
of balance I shall mightily act to restore it. I would never want to allow the impression<br />
to be created that I am Sydney-centric because I am not. I play no part at all in the<br />
constant tug of war about the location of sporting events between Melbourne and<br />
Sydney. I encourage vigorous interstate rivalry and as far as I am concerned, good<br />
luck to the Victorian Premier if he can pinch more sporting events from other states.<br />
QUESTION: Jill Singer, self-employed. I wonder, Prime Minister, could you tell me, do you think<br />
there would be anything wrong with Kerry Packer owning Fairfax in Victoria and also<br />
owning Channel Nine. The Chairman of Channel Seven has said that he considers<br />
there would be problems with this because of Mr Packer's gambling influences and<br />
that there could be some sort of, you know, murky little areas in this. I wonder what<br />
you think about this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we will be looking very soon at the existing cross media laws and it is something<br />
we will have to take a decision on quite soon. I don't mean next week but quite soon.<br />
I have said in the past that I was always very sceptical about the original reasons for<br />
the cross media prohibitions and I have never been a fan of them and that's something<br />
that I'm on the record as having said as far back as 1987 and I think I was Opposition<br />
Leader then, and I have sort of retained the view and I ceased being Opposition Leader<br />
and I haven't had a different view since then. I believe that the original purpose of the<br />
cross media rules that were brought in largely at the instigation of Paul Keating in the<br />
mid 1 980s was to dismantle or reduce the power of the then Fairfax empire which<br />
included of course not only the newspapers that you mentioned but also the Seven<br />
television network and a very large network of radio stations. It was in fact at its<br />
height the biggest and most powerful media empire that this country had seen.<br />
Now a lot has happened since then. I understand exactly what you are saying and I<br />
think it's one of those issues where a Government has got to take a whole lot of things<br />
into account, including the enormous changes in the technology of the media. You can<br />
find just about every major player in the media, including Rupert Murdoch, including<br />
my predecessor as Prime Minister, who at various stages had criticised the absurdity of<br />
having cross media prohibitions in an age of what is called convergence between the<br />
various arms of the media. I hope that we will make a conscientious, national interest<br />
decision. No matter what decision you take with the media you can always be accused<br />
of favouring one proprietor over another.<br />
There's a sensitivity in this country about foreign ownership. I have never been<br />
particularly paranoid about foreign ownership because if you have any understanding<br />
of the way the Australian economy operates, fairly high, not high level but perhaps a<br />
high degree of foreign ownership is indispensable if we want to maintain the sort of<br />
activities and the sort of standards of living we have. But all of the things that you<br />
mention weigh upon my mind but I do start from the proposition of not having the sort<br />
of blind obsession about maintaining the present system simply because it's been there<br />
for a number of years. I think there are arguments for changing it. I think there are </p>
<p>also arguments, legitimate concerns about plurality and diversity but you've also got to<br />
understand the size of the media market in Australia and you've also got to understand<br />
that everybody but everybody in the media who talks on this issue has a self interest to<br />
promote and that obviously includes people who talk on behalf of the Nine Network,<br />
the Seven Network, the existing Fairfax organisation, even the ABC, everybody has<br />
sort of a self interest to promote on this issue and it's our call to try and get the<br />
balance of that right and we will be looking at this. I knew somebody would ask me<br />
the question tonight. I didn't think it would come from a small business woman but I<br />
hope the decision that we ultimately take will be seen as one that we conscientiously<br />
believe is in the national interest.<br />
QUESTION: Tess Lawrence, Prime Minister. Also small businesswoman and a consultant in ethical<br />
crisis management. The question that I'd like to ask you on behalf of sort of spin<br />
doctors is why is it that I've noticed that throughout your political career, and I recall<br />
the documentary series that you participated in with me called Sex, Power and Politics,<br />
why it is that you have always been extremely potent and vigorous in defeat and yet I<br />
have noticed that in your political demeanour, since coming to the office of Prime<br />
Ministership, you lack that potency, you lack that vigour. Your speech writing is banal<br />
in the extreme and I say this simply on the basis of professional analysis and I wonder<br />
why it is that you are an extraordinary warrior in defeat and I remember, you know,<br />
your several defeat speeches and now that you are in office and now that you've been<br />
bestowed with the golden crown, has the sword outworn the sheath?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well I don't have a speech writer. One of my besetting sins as sort of a, how can I<br />
describe it, as a meal or an appetiser or whatever for journalists is that I simply cannot<br />
read a prepared text. It's not because of any sort of intellectual impairment. It's<br />
simply that I'd hate reading something. I have a profound distaste of getting<br />
something in front of me and reading it. Now that sometimes has led me into trouble<br />
although I have to say that one of the sort of foreign policy glitches I had was when I<br />
got my bridges mixed up in Indonesia and I've got to say, that was on one of the few<br />
occasions since I've been Prime Minister that I actually read a speech and perhaps it<br />
teaches me that you've always got to rely on your instincts. Look, I can't explain the<br />
dichotomy, the paradox that you identify in me. I can't possibly explain it. I am<br />
unable to do that. I will have to leave that to the judgement of others.<br />
I am glad you thought I was a warrior in defeat. I think that's very encouraging and<br />
I'm glad I was. I had a lot of fight in me then. I've still got a lot of fight in me now.<br />
Perhaps when you're in office, you've become Prime Minister, you've reached the top<br />
of the hill, politically speaking, you do take on a different attitude. You do see things a<br />
bit differently. I have a view about the relationship between the Prime Minister, the<br />
leader of the country and the people of that country. I, rather off the top of my head<br />
used an expression in the lead up to the last election campaign which has remained<br />
with me, and I daresay will remain with me forever, and that was the expression<br />
" relaxed and comfortable". What I was trying to connote by this is that I do think the<br />
relationship between the leader of a country and the people of that country is a special </p>
<p>one, you have to have a capacity to identify with the hopes and aspirations of people.<br />
You can never do it all of the time and you can never do it with all of them, and you<br />
will always be despised by a section and being regarded rather suspiciously by others<br />
but at the end of the day, having an understanding of what makes the people of a<br />
nation tick and what their basic desires and wants are is a very important element of<br />
being an effective leader.<br />
I think Australians want a lot for themselves. I think they do want a society which is<br />
harmonious. Australians don't like unnecessary conflict. They are fundamentally<br />
tolerant and very decent people. They think they have achieved a lot and they have<br />
good reason to believe that. They are rather proud in that sort of self deprecating,<br />
down playing way which is characteristic of Australians, of what this nation has<br />
achieved and they don't like it being dumped on and they don't like being lectured to<br />
and told that they should be perpetually ashamed of what has occurred in this country<br />
over the years. Now I think part of the role of a leader is to understand that, is to<br />
articulate it, be willing on occasions to jolly it along or disagree with it but not always<br />
be in a state of excited animation and pugnacity about the things in that nation which<br />
he or she regards as inadequate but perhaps on occasions, and more occasions than<br />
just a few, being willing to talk about the achievements of the country and articulate in<br />
a determined way the pride that people feel in it.<br />
Now that is a totally inadequate explanation for the paradox but it's an attempt to<br />
explain perhaps the attitude that I have endeavoured in a broad sense to bring to the<br />
way in which I have carried out my duties over the last twelve months. I have said<br />
before and I will finish on this, that leadership does consist of two elements. One on<br />
occasions is to stand in the middle of the road and dare people to run you over. On<br />
other occasions it is to listen to people, to bring them forward, to walk with them,<br />
perhaps on occasions at their pace. I think you need to mix the two to get the balance<br />
right. If you're always in the middle of the road eventually one of the cars will get<br />
you. If you are never in the middle of the road and you're never encouraging and<br />
cajoling people and dragging them along, you won't ever get some of the necessary<br />
reforms that are superficially very unpopular done. I have tried over the last year, and<br />
I will continue to try for so long as the Australian people want me in my job. I will<br />
continue to try to get the balance between those things about right because I think that<br />
is the prescription and that is really what the Australian people want me to do.<br />
Thank you. </p>
