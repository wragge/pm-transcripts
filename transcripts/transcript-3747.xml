NOTES FOR THE PRIME fIINISTER,<br />
FOR THE ANNUAL DINNER OF THE<br />
BRISBANE DEUTSCHER TURN-VEREIN,<br />
BRISBANE, FRIDAY 23 MAY 1975<br />
1. ONE OF THE GREAT FEATURES OF MIGRANT LIFE IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
IS THE STRENGTH OF ETHNIC SOCIAL CLUBS AND OTHER<br />
COMMUNITY GROUPS. IN EVERY CITY I VISIT I FIND<br />
FLOURISHING MIGRANT ORGANISATIONS, CLUBS, SPORTING<br />
GROUPS AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS. I HAVE SPENT<br />
MANY HAPPY HOURS AMONG ITALIANS, GREEKS, GERMANS<br />
AND OTHER NATIONALITIES IN SURROUNDINGS SUCH AS THESE.<br />
EVERYWHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IS WARM AND THE HOSPITALITY<br />
IS EXCELLENT,<br />
2. I SOMETIMES FEEL MORE AT HOME WITH THE GERMAN COMMUNITY<br />
IN QUEENSLAND THAN I DO WITH THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY.<br />
I KNOW YOUR PREMIER IS OF NORTHERN EUROPEAN EXTRACTION,<br />
BUT HE HAS NEVER INVITED ME TO DINNER. THE ONLY TIME<br />
I INVITED HIM TO DINNER HE DECLINED TO ATTEND.<br />
3. I KNOW YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO BE REMINDED THAT I WAS IN THE<br />
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO, I<br />
HAD TALKS WITH CHANCELLOR SCHMIDT IN BONN AND PAID<br />
VERY HAPPY VISITS TO THE CITIES OF COLOGNE AND HAMBURG,<br />
I WAS ABLE TO REMIND MY HOSTS OF THE GREAT CONTRIBUTION<br />
MADE BY GERMAN MIGRANTS TO AUSTRALIA AND OF THE STRONG<br />
ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LINKS BETWEEN US. I WAS THE SECOND<br />
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER TO VISIT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC<br />
THE FIRST SINCE SIR ROBERT FiENZIES IN 1959. s o s/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
4, GERMANS WERE AMONG THE VERY FIRST PEOPLE TO SETTLE IN<br />
QUEENSLAND, A GROUP OF GERMAN MISSIONARIES ARRIVED<br />
IN THE MORETON BAY DISTRICT IN 1838. THEE WERE<br />
SENSIBLE ENOUGH TO REALISE THAT MORETON BAY IN THOSE<br />
DAYS WAS PART OF NEW SOUTH WALES, THE STATE GOVERNMENT<br />
WAS PROBABLY MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN THE ONE YOU HAVE NOW,<br />
SHORTLY AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF QUEENSLAND AS A<br />
SEPARATE COLONY I N. 1859' -THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT<br />
-I SUPPOSE WE COULD : STILL CALL, IT THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT<br />
BEGAN TO ENCOURAGE IMMIGRATION FROM EUROPE. AT . THE<br />
: FIRST QUEENSLAND CENSUS IN 1861 THE COLONY HAD 2124<br />
SGERMAN-BORN PEOPLE.' TODAY THERE ARE ROUGHLY 10,000<br />
QUEENSLANDERS BORN IN GERMANY, THE 1971 CENSUS ALSO<br />
SHOWED THAT APPROXIMATELY 31,000 QUEENSLANDERS HAD EITHER<br />
ONE OR BOTH PARENTS BORN IN GERMANY.<br />
6, IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN STRONG CULTURAL CONTACTS<br />
BETWEEN GERMANY AND AUSTRALIA, THE STUTTGART BALLET<br />
HAS COME TO AUSTRALIA AND THE SYDNEY SYMPHONY<br />
ORCHESTRA HAS PLAYED IN GERMAN CITIES. VERY MANY GERMANS<br />
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ARTS, SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY<br />
IN AUSTRALIA, S../ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
7, GERMAN-AUSTRALIAN CONTACTS GO BACK TO THE VERY<br />
BEGINNING OF AUSTRALIA. GOVERNOR PHILLIP'S<br />
FATHER WAS A GERMAN; A GERMA. SURVEYOR, THEODORE<br />
ALT, SAILED WITH PHILLIP iN THE FIRST FLEET;<br />
FREDERICK BRECKER, REGARDED AS THE FATHER OF THE<br />
QUEENSLAND MERINO, STOCK, SETTLED IN QUEENSLAND IN<br />
THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY: THE EXPLORER AND<br />
NATURALIST, LUDWIG LEICHARDT, MIGRATED FROM GERMANYIN<br />
1842; GERMANWINEMAKERS ARE FAMOUS IN AUSTRALIA";'<br />
SKARL RASP CAME TO AUSTRALIA IN 1869, DISCOVERED<br />
" SILVER, LEAD AND ZINC DEPOSITS AT BROKEN HILL, AND<br />
FOUNDED A SMELTING COMPANY WHICH WAS THE FORERUNNER.<br />
OF B. H. P.<br />
8. CLUBS SUCH AS YOURS ARE KEEPING ALIVE THIS<br />
GREAT TRADITION OF FRIENDSHIP AND INTERNATIONAL<br />
UNDERSTANDING. IT IS GOOD TO BE AMONG YOU AND<br />
TO SHARE YOUR CONFIDENCE IN OUR COUNTRY AND ITS FUTURE, -a' </p>
