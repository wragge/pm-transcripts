<p>E&amp;OE ......</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well Mr Howard, how did it go in there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we had a very long discussion. We talked about a whole lot of things. We talked about the world economic situation. We talked about East Timor and the Pacific, Europe, the future of world trade negotiations. It was a very good opportunity in a very relaxed way to share views between two people who've, we have sort of been in office roughly the same period of time and we have a lot of common views.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was there any discussion about the Childers backpackers fire?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, we've made an announcement. The British Government will be contributing to the memorial fund. The Commonwealth Government will be contributing $50,000 to it. The British Government, 10,000 pounds. And I understand Mr Beattie will be saying something about it. The actual form of the memorial is something that we will need to discuss with the local people in Childers. It's not something that we will tell them how to do, we will talk to them about it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have there been any discussions about the return of Aboriginal remains?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, that matter was raised and we have agreed on a process to discuss the return of indigenous remains. This is a difficult, sensitive issue. It's very important to the Aboriginal people in Australia and we're anxious to talk to them as it proceeds and we've agreed on a way of progressing it and there will be a joint statement made available to you from Mr Blair and myself, who also agreed to a memorandum of understanding in relation to E-Commerce which will be signed later this year. And I've also indicated that we will be, the British Government has agreed that work should start between the two governments for the construction of an all service War Memorial for Australians who died in the direct defence of Britain during World War II and on other occasions and also generally to Australians who died fighting alongside the British in the various wars in the last century. And that will be constructed here in central London.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were there any particular discussions that you would like to tell us about about on trade issues? Was there any thing specific?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We talked at some length about trade, and I reiterated the long standing, but nonetheless very strong and utterly justified Australian concern about the inequity and the inequality of the way the trade rules fall. I spoke, I used the Howe Leather case as an example of the very strongly held feelings in Australia about the way manufacturing is treated differently to agriculture. The British government itself is an advocate within the European Union of a different approach and I encouraged the Prime Minister to continue with that. And we both agreed very strongly that getting another round going is important and that is something he intends to pursue at the G-8 meeting which is taking place at Okinawa in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think of the prospects of getting that [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think, Paul, you're going get any real progress on it until the American election is out of the way, and you know the shape of the new administration and the attitude it is likely to take. I don't think there is, I think we have lost time on this. I don't disguise my disappointment about Seattle. I thought Seattle was a big let down. And I hope that there is renewed energy and enthusiasm and commitment from the Americans.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the Euro? Was there any discussion about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, yes. But I mean that is, essentially a matter for the British and the Europeans. It doesn't directly impinge on Australia and I listened and reflected on what he said, but that is really a matter for the British.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did the Prime Minister, or the British Prime Minister or Treasury provide any advice on the GST drawing on their experience with the ??</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, they were fascinated to get a briefing. And I told them that all had gone very well, so far, so good. And they obviously noted with great interest what had occurred. And I said that it represented a major reform and it was great to have it in place. It is. And they were very interested to hear what had occurred and we spent quite a bit of time talking about domestic economic performance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] about Australia as a regional financial centre?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, we just touched on it in a very general fashion. But I will be talking more about that tonight. But that is really not a government to government thing. That is more a government to private sector thing. I see that as something [inaudible] a government on. I mean in a very general way I talked about Australia's role in the region, but not specifically on the mechanics of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] frequently is raised in these meetings. Do you ever feel that you are getting anywhere?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I feel that it is very hard. No, I will be saying something about that tonight, when I address this business gathering. And look I first came, no I didn't first come to this city, I came here 25 years ago as the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations, and I've got to say, not a lot has changed in relation to that. It's very hard. I can understand the real frustration that Australian agricultural producers feel. But we have made some progress, the Cairns Group did gain some ground and we do have some access now. And of course despite all the trade barriers that the European Union puts up, Australia is second only to France as an exporter of wine into the United Kingdom. I mean we have, that is one of the great trading success stories of modern times ? how we've been able to find a niche market, pitch the product at the right level and get the people who want it. And so, you know, full marks to the Australian wine industry, but your point is right Heather.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on Fiji, is there a sense now that the Commonwealth should reactivate some sort of guidance mechanism for the new government, or the potential new government of Fiji?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the Commonwealth does have a role, but as in all of these things, it is the role of advocacy and persuasion and argument and debate and so forth from outside. I mean you are talking about the domestic affairs of another country. There are certain responses that the rest of the world can have, but the rest of the world has got to think of the impact of those responses on the, on the local population. It's not good news, what's occurring in Fiji, and it is painfully very reminiscent of what happened earlier.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister do you think that the Australian people should feel very pleased that they're paying a 10% GST when the British people are paying a 17.5% VAT?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't want to talk about other countries, but I can certainly say this, that I think the, when you look around the world, we've now got a much fairer and more balanced tax system. I mean the British do pay 17.5% VAT and our rate's 10% and it's staying at 10% let me hasten to add. Absolutely staying at 10%. I think . . .</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Never, ever rise above 10% Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can, you can quote me as long as you live Fleur ? no government that I've got anything to do with will ever do anything about increasing that rate and I don't believe that a coalition government led by somebody else, sometime into the future will do anything about it either.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any disagreements with Mr Blair, at all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't know that we disagreed. I mean look, no I don't know that we had any serious arguments about anything. But, I mean in a, you know you range over a whole lot of things. You have two people who respect each other, although we come from broadly opposite sides I guess of the general political divide. I have a great respect for the job he's done. I want to thank Mr Blair and the British Government for the contribution they're making to Australia Week and the way in which they have welcomed us. And I mean you develop over time when you see somebody regularly, you develop a regard for the work they do and the enthusiasm that he brings to his task. And, but I was very pleased to be able to explain in some detail the reform programme of the government and how successful it's been.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is he still as enthusiastic as he was when you first met him? Because he seems to be having quite internal party division at the present time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not going to comment. I won't comment on British politics in Britain. He's still in very good, in very good voice and he's very well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you meet the baby?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I didn't. No, the baby's away Alison. But I inquired about the baby and the reports were all good. Anyway, we'd better go.</p>
