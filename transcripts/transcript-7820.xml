F PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, WREST POINT CASINO,<br />
HOBART, 19 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST; Prime Minister on that theme, a year or so ago<br />
you expressed a wish sometime to go to Antarctica. It didn't<br />
turn out to be practical at that time. Would you hope that<br />
you might be able to do that sometime in the near future?<br />
PM: Very much so. I deeply desire to go down there. I must<br />
say that it was further fired last night. My satellite<br />
hook-up with my very dear friend, Jacques Cousteau, who I<br />
invited to come to Australia, and may I say to Tasmanians as<br />
part of the bait, if I can put it that way, I invited him to<br />
come and sample the beautiful food of Tasmania, and he<br />
responded fervently. so Jacques will be coming here next<br />
year and in responding to my invitation he said can we go to<br />
the Antarctic. I said it would be marvellous if we could do<br />
that. So it would be marvellous to go there and I couldn't<br />
think of anything more exciting than going there with Jacques<br />
Cousteau. JOURNALIST: There will be flights next year for the first<br />
time<br />
FM: I'm not unaware of certain developments that are being<br />
looked at and if we<br />
JOURNALISTs inaudible<br />
PM: No, no. But all things are being considered.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on-a national matter<br />
PM: These are national matters. You have a nation, a very<br />
important part of the nation.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Opposition Treasury spokesman speaking in<br />
M11jvuLaaw yuftLvLJay, bald Lhw Oppofl. JIt im<br />
expecting a dirty election campaign </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Well, I mean they'd know about this, they are the<br />
experts, they are the one's who do these sorts of things. so<br />
that's what they feel that they are going to be about, OK, I<br />
think that that is of course, a defensive mechanism that's<br />
being developed. You see Opposition's in a very difficult<br />
condition about what will be a major thrust for this<br />
campaign. That is the stark and deep gulf between the two<br />
Parties, the Liberals and ourselves. on the fundamental<br />
iscue of the financing of Government expenditures I rerer to<br />
the fact that Dr Howson is proponing the proposition that it<br />
is ' a fmlr AuRtralia in which you abolish your capital gains<br />
tax and give back billions of dollars to the wealthy. He<br />
knows that his Federal President, Mr John kaliott, typifies<br />
in the Australian mind what this is all about. He knows that<br />
we will be attacking with all the vigour at our command, the<br />
fact that it is morally repugnant and economically insane to<br />
take billions of dollars out of the public revenue and give<br />
it back to the likes of Elliott. Now we will be remorseless<br />
and relentless in attacking that issue. This would represent<br />
in the history of this country the most massive<br />
redistribution of income from the poor and the middle income<br />
Australia to the wealthy few. one of the most massive that's<br />
happened in any western society. Now in an attempt to try<br />
and divert attention from that fact, which is increasingly<br />
becoming recognised by the Australian people, is going to be<br />
this attempt to say we're attacking John Elliott. Nov as far<br />
ao I'm conoad, UD I've said, John ulliott reprenents,<br />
typifies if you like, what is, as I say, socially obnoxious<br />
and economically insane in this proposal. If Dr Hewson<br />
thinks that he's got any chance of diverting attontion from<br />
the full onslaught not merely of the Labor Party but of<br />
many, many people in this counltry, many orqanisations on this<br />
perversion of a policy of his, then he's mistaken. He may<br />
also, I suggest, examine his own statements on this issue.<br />
What has happened to Dr Hewson to divert him from the purity<br />
of his approach as an academic economist before he became<br />
influenced by the forces behind the Liberal Party. Because<br />
before he became so influenced by the forces within and<br />
behind the Liberal Party he expressed the view that there<br />
should be attacks upon a capital gain. That was his<br />
position. But now he gets into the operations of the Liberal<br />
Party and suddenly the clear understanding of the objective<br />
economist is warped by all the forces which form the bins,<br />
the prejudice and the privilege which is the Liberal Party in<br />
this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think this is the first time that..<br />
policy.. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: No, simply not. I have always been amused by the<br />
inadequacy of the analysis not only in the media, the<br />
professional media but by a number of commentators. it was<br />
my task on Friday night in delivering the Evati Memorial<br />
lecture to spell out some of the things which should've been<br />
more obvious to people in this country before but which<br />
haven't been too obvious. I recommend you read the speech,<br />
it's an excellent speech, well written, it was also well<br />
delivered, and it will show to you than any suggestion that<br />
there is not a vast gulf between the-two Parties is just a<br />
nonsense. There couldn't be a wider gulf. One of the points<br />
that I made then and it's worth I think relating it back<br />
hA, one of the pointA T made about education, kidR in the<br />
scnooi. Tney naa, Detore we came to orrice, Y years in<br />
office. in that whole period of seven years what was their<br />
magnificent achievement in terms of education and increasing<br />
the retention rate in schools in Australia? Magnificent<br />
achievement of lifting it by 21, it's gone from 34% to 361 of<br />
the kids staying on In school. They walked out of office<br />
after 7 years and in lifting it 2 points to 36% which was<br />
about the worst retention rate in the western world. why<br />
didn'* t they have the money to spend on education? For<br />
instance, it was because they allowed the Elliotts of this<br />
world to have a situation where through the absence of a<br />
capital gains tax, money which should've been coming into the<br />
public coffers to be spent on the education of our kids was<br />
lining the pockets of the wealthy. Nov we said that's not<br />
the sort of society that Australia ought to be or under Labor<br />
is going to be. So what's been our achievement? We have<br />
reformed the tax system so that we get now the billions of<br />
dollars coming into the public coffers which should've been<br />
coming. Now kids are now staying. of course it's not 361<br />
of our kids, it's now 60%. Up 2 percentage points in 7 years<br />
under them, from 34% to 36. Under us from 36 to 60 and we've<br />
been able to do that by more than doubling the amounts or<br />
education allowances at secondary school level, going into<br />
the homes of the kids of the low and the low to middle income<br />
families. Now that's what this election is about and never<br />
forget it. What sort of Australia is it going to be? Is it<br />
going to be one where you have the worst retention rates in<br />
the world, where you don't get from those with a capacity to<br />
pay the money to keep and build your kids in shcools? That's<br />
what it's about. -Or are you going to go back to taking the<br />
billions of dollars away which have enabled you to massively<br />
build your education system and give those billions of<br />
dollars to the Elliotts of this world? Now if or Howson<br />
thinks that the exposition of those issues is dirty politics<br />
then he can think it. That's the exposition of what the<br />
facts are about the alternatives facing the Australian<br />
community as we go up to the next election. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there a danger though that constantly<br />
referring to John Elliott<br />
PM; Well have you heard my exposition? i'm not you've<br />
got the facts. I'm saying that they have this man as their<br />
President. This man openly boasts, openly, I didn't put the<br />
words in his mouth. He openly boasts that he's been involved<br />
in the development of their policies and he will be a massive<br />
beneficiary, he would be a massive beneficiary of their<br />
policies. Now I'm simply saying that we didn't chose to<br />
elect John Elliott as the President of-the Liberal Party. We<br />
didn't chose to make the decision that he would be involved<br />
in the formation of that. That's their decision and it is<br />
inevitable that Elliott's name will be associated. But if<br />
they had Joe Blow as their President, Joe S1ow, which they<br />
don't, but if they had Joe Blow the policy would still be as<br />
objectionable. I can assure you my concentration as Prime<br />
Minister will be as it has been here. I mean I mention<br />
Elliott but my concentration is upnn the n-oeially obnoxious-_-<br />
and economically insane nature of their policies. Whether<br />
they keep Elliott as their President or not, that's what the<br />
attack will continue to be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can I change the subject just<br />
for the moment to tourism. some can say that when airline<br />
deregulation takes effect in 12 months time, that Tasmania<br />
actually will get air services, dearer fares and general<br />
service won't be as good. Do you share that view? And if<br />
that does occur, would you help Tasmania if that appears to<br />
be the case?<br />
PM: I thank you for the question. I don't accept that to be<br />
the case. Let me say that in these current circumstances, as<br />
I've said in meeting vith the representatives of the<br />
Tasmanian tourist induit~ y lat. : aihL, that I've<br />
personally pressed the two airlines to do as much as they<br />
possibly could to help Tasmania. So I'm very conscious of<br />
the aviation needs of this State. I don't believe that the<br />
deregulation of the system will have that effect and l'm<br />
prepared to say to you that we'll monitor that very closely.<br />
This is entirely hypothetical; if it were to be seen that<br />
there was that impact then that's something we'd have to do<br />
something about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you confirmed the $ 2.2M4 for the<br />
Tasmanian mariceting campaign and the taxation relief. Apart<br />
from your yesterday, can Tasmania still hope for further<br />
Federal Government assistance? </p>
<p>PM: Well let me, I mean you haven't been exhaustive in the<br />
way in Tasmania will benefit, I mean out of that $ 30M4<br />
package, which I might remind you it's been said by the<br />
tourist industry to meet what they regarded as reasonable.<br />
Out of that Tasmania will benefit from all components. of<br />
the $ 18.5X on the international advertising Tasmania of<br />
course, will be included, as it properly ought to be in the<br />
attractions of Australia, for overseas to Australia will get<br />
the benefit of the impact of that $ 1. m You will also get<br />
the benefit of the impact of the $ 5M4 what we call Australian<br />
generic advertising which will be directed towards getting<br />
Australians to travel within Australia, to take their<br />
holidays in Australia. obviously a lot of mainland<br />
Australians in responding to that $ 5M4 campaign will come to<br />
Tasmania. You have a Prime Minister who sets the lead. At<br />
the end of the year I come down here for my break, that's the<br />
fi-tst thing I do. So that's another $ 5M4 worth you just got.<br />
Now you then get the so you get the benefit of those<br />
three components and as to how that $ 2.2M of course will<br />
consult You get the benefit of the taxation<br />
understanding that we have. Now I think Tasmania is going to<br />
do very well out of it. I mean what we've got to remember<br />
out of these things, of course I acknowlege and have at all<br />
times the difficulties that have been involved as a result of<br />
the pilots initial strike action and then their resignation.<br />
I mean itIG been disastrous for some and extremely unheipful<br />
to tho economy generally. BuL Ljae worst of it, witnout any<br />
question, is over and the airlines are returning towards full<br />
services. What we will have then as we go into 1990 is we<br />
will have an airline industry which is going to be<br />
significantly more efficient than it was before, very much<br />
more efficient. Which will mean that airline fare structure<br />
will be at lower level as a result of the restructuring than<br />
they would otherwise have been and this is going to be of<br />
continuing benefit to the tourism industry and the basic<br />
attractions of Tasmania remain unaltered. So I think that<br />
when you put that against what would've happened if you'd had<br />
a weak government I ke the opposition who said give into the<br />
pilots, you would've had a destruction of the Australian<br />
economy, you would've had a destruction or the tourismindustry.<br />
So there have been problems and very, very real<br />
problems. But out of it is going to come a better airline<br />
industry and an economy which is going to continue to thrive.<br />
JOURNALIST." Mr Hawke, you made reference yesterday in<br />
relation to a fisheries agreement with the Soviet Union, a<br />
parallel commodities agreement. I'm just wondering some<br />
more detail about that commodities </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: NOW I can just quickly give you the backgrounmd and then<br />
some idea of where were going. NOW for the benefit of<br />
others, the Soviet's were keen on having a fisheries<br />
agreement with Australia. We were keen enough to have that<br />
but we also are keen to have a commodities agreement. So the<br />
time that's been taken to conclude the fisheries agreement<br />
has been a function not so much of the intrinsic problems in<br />
that area but of ensuring that we get out of the commodities<br />
agreement the benefits that we think are appropriate, Now<br />
the fisheries agreement in that regard has been virtually<br />
completed. we don't think that we're far away now from<br />
getting agreement on the other. so I would think that within<br />
a very, very short time we should have agreement which<br />
cover fisheries, In that respect, I made it quite clear of<br />
course, that Hobart would be a preferred port and I think<br />
that you can be expecting, Premier, some announcement<br />
in that area before too long. I understand that the<br />
Tasmanian authorities have been having some discussions which<br />
is appropriate that they should do and of course when the<br />
agreements at the Comonwealth/ Soviet level are finalised<br />
then the will come. But it's one of those things where<br />
we're not very far away.<br />
ends </p>
