FOR PRESS QUEEN'S SILVER JUBILEE MEDAL<br />
Last year, Her Majesty approved the institution of a Silver<br />
Jubilee Medal to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary<br />
of her accession to the throne. The Medal is a personal<br />
award from the Queen to members of the Crown services and<br />
others in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth<br />
countries.<br />
Awards of the Silver Jubilee Medal to Australians are<br />
being made on the recommendations of the Commonwealth and<br />
State Governments. They are one important element in<br />
Australia's commemoration of Her Majesty's Jubilee, as<br />
outlined by the Prime Minister in Parliament in February.<br />
Awards of the Medal are being made in the United Kingdom<br />
to coincide with Jubilee celebrations. Australian<br />
recipients of the Medal will be announced on 1 August.<br />
The Commonwealth and the States have concerted in<br />
preparing lists covering some seven thousand Australians<br />
in all walks of life.<br />
