AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, MARRIOTT HOTEL. AMMAN. JORDAN<br />
24 JANUARY 1987<br />
PROOF--ONL-Y-----<br />
PM: Ladies and Gentlemen, I propose to-make a brief-opening<br />
statement and then, if I can, to distribute the questions evenly<br />
between the local media and the representatives of the Australian<br />
press. I have today had verylong-and--fruitful discussions with--<br />
His Majesty and with the Prime MInister and with members of his<br />
government. As I think you will appreciate this is the first<br />
visit by an Australian Prime Minister to Jordan and it is<br />
reciprocation, albeit somewhat belated, of the visit to Australia<br />
by His Majesty in 1976 and by the Crown Prince in 1977. I am<br />
certain that on the basis of these lengthy talks that we have<br />
had and in the light of the visits to which I refer it is now<br />
clear that the relationship between our two countries is on a<br />
firm, friendly, mature and constructive basis. On the key issue<br />
of the resolution of the Middle East dispute, I took the opportunity<br />
of making clear to His Majesty the admiration that I and the<br />
Government and the people of Australia have for the readiness<br />
which His Majesty and the Government of Jordan have consistently<br />
shown in their search for a negotiated settlement of the Middle<br />
East dispute. It is a matter to be noted, I think with great<br />
admiration, how His Majesty has sustained his search now over<br />
many years despite the diffidil-t-i-and'the di-sappointments-tha-. t<br />
have attended those efforts on his part, and that he continues<br />
that search for a negotiated settlement at the present time.<br />
I was given a detailed, cogent and, if I may say so, very interesting<br />
account of Jordan's perceptions of the condition of the peace<br />
processes. Both His Majesty and the Prime Minister affirmed the<br />
determination of Jordan to try and inject momentum into the peace<br />
process because they expresse and in my judgement, properly<br />
expressed, the apprehension that if the peace processes stall<br />
and despair takes the place of hope then the slide into conflict<br />
becomes inevitable. In particular, both His Majesty and the Prime<br />
Minister expressed their support for an international conference<br />
as an integral part of the process. And I told them that Australia<br />
sees merit in the concept-of an international conference. It<br />
was made clear to me that the aim of Jordan remains a<br />
comprehensive and just settlement based upon resolutions242 and<br />
338. And I took the opportunity of telling both His Majesty and<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia's support for a just, comprehensive<br />
and lasting settlement and for the resolutions 242 and 238 as<br />
an integrally important part of that process. And in that context,<br />
I reaffirmed our support for the position, which is theirs, of<br />
Israel's right to exist within secure and recognised boundaries.<br />
And of the rights of the Palestinian people. I had outlined to<br />
me Jordan's West Bank economic development plan. And Australia's<br />
moral and political support and if possible material support was </p>
<p>PM cont: sought. I expressed to both His Majesty and the Prime<br />
Minister our support for that plan as a humanitarian scheme<br />
calculated to improve the livelihood and well being of the people<br />
of the West Bank. And I undertook on my return to Australia to<br />
consider with my Ministers the possibility of some form of Australian<br />
material support for that plan. We also discussed the tragic<br />
situation in the Lebanon. The tragedy which has a particularly<br />
sharp profile for us in Australia because of the large population<br />
of Lebanese origin that we have in country. And both the Prime<br />
Minister and His Majesty also explained at length to me their<br />
perceptions of. and concern about, the tragic conflict between<br />
Iran and Iraq and of the very grave potential for regional<br />
destabilisation which is involved in the continuation of that<br />
~ cnlc.-H is--a-jesty--descr ibed-to-me-how-he--was -hope fulI<br />
participating countries in next week's Kuwait/ Islamic conference<br />
might address how this tragic Iraq/ Iran war may be brought to<br />
end. I am pleas-ed'to inf'orm you that-I also took the opportunity<br />
in my meeting with His Majesty to invite His Majesty to visit<br />
Australia at.-the ear-liest--opportunity. . And I am. very -pleased<br />
to say that His Majesty indicated both his pleasure at the<br />
invitation and his intention to take up that invitation at the<br />
first convenient opportunity. We also, of course, particularly<br />
in the dicussions with the Prime Minister and the other Ministers<br />
had considerable discussions on matters of bilateral interest.<br />
And I will have distributed to you fairly shortly a two page summary<br />
of an agreed statement between the Prime Minister and his Ministers<br />
on the one hand and myself which sets out the broad areas that<br />
we covered. Suffice to say at this point that we affirmed the<br />
cordiality of our relations, the significance that we attached<br />
both of us to improving, increasing, the economic and commercial<br />
relationship between us. And understandably, the Jordanian Ministers<br />
referred to the imbalance in trade between us which-currently<br />
is about three to one in favour of Australia. And the proposition<br />
was raised of the possibility of a trade agreement<br />
t o be signed between us. That wds raised by my Jordanian friends.<br />
-And I -undertook to -have-A-drafCtg -e stde -Atstralika7--<br />
Possibilities were examined for increasing the trade between us<br />
and there was agreement to study in further detail, both at<br />
the level of Ministers and at the level of businessmen in both<br />
countries the opportunites, for further trade between us. As you<br />
will see from the note that will be distributed interest was<br />
expressed on both sides on the possibility of joint Jordanian/<br />
Australian ventures in this country. Ventures which would have<br />
the possibility of serving both Jordan and regional markets as<br />
well as the Australian market. And the possibility of such joint<br />
ventures is something now to be further explored. In particular,<br />
there was raised the possibility of fresh-chilled sheep meat based<br />
on the importation of live sheep from Australia for fattening<br />
in Jordan. The possibilities of joint ventures in the area oftransport<br />
development and-in the area of phosphate fertiliser<br />
industries in Jordan. In the area of technical cooperation, there<br />
was a review of current levels of assistance and we expressed<br />
our readiness to do more in this area consistent with our budge-104( y<br />
possibilities. There is in existence~ as many of you will know)<br />
an existing dry land farming project which currently is scheduled<br />
to end its operation at the end of this year and I indicated to<br />
the Prime Minister my strong positive disposition to arrange for<br />
an extension of that project beyond the end of 1987. / 3 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, what order of material support<br />
were you thinking of in terms of this development plan?<br />
PM: Are you talking about the West Bank Development Plan. I<br />
can't make any commitment on that until I talk with my colleagues<br />
about it. I explained to the Prime Minister that we had in Australia<br />
last year to curtail the extent of our foreign aid because of<br />
the very substantial loss of national income of the order of<br />
$ 6 billion that we have suffered with the adverse turnaround<br />
in the terms of trade. I was pleased to be able to say that in that<br />
context the level of assistance to Jordan had not been cut in<br />
any way, in fact it marginally increased. So the extent of our<br />
capacity to provide some assistance will be a matter for discussion<br />
with my-Ministers. And that is-someth-ing-that--is understood-bymy<br />
friends here.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, where6_ ducF the -King-and thUe ' Prime<br />
Minister rate the search for peace at the moment. If they said<br />
to you that they feared the slide to conflict was inevitable-i~ f<br />
peace processes failed where is it now?<br />
PM: I think it is fair to put it this w. ay-that there is a stalling<br />
in the process. But I must emphasise that both the Prime Minister<br />
and His Majesty were not totally pessimistic. They said simply<br />
that you cannot afford to be pessimistic in this situation.<br />
They recognise the difficulties that exist but expressed, each<br />
of them, their total commitment to continue this search for peace.<br />
There is a preparedness to talk with all parties involved and<br />
I certainly left my discussions with both of them of a feeling<br />
of realistic optimism, if I can put it that way. That is they<br />
recognise the very, very considerable difficulties that exist<br />
but believe that if there is a commitment and if there is integrity<br />
that a resolution can be found. But it is not something.<br />
obviously that is going to occur quickly. I think it would be<br />
fair to say that while obviously they attach vast importance to<br />
the -resolution of the-Israel i/ Arab-cof 7ct-that--in--the sense---<br />
of looking at the possibilities of significant destabilisation<br />
in the area of the conflict between Iran and Iraq even more<br />
important. And that is why both the King and the Prime Minister<br />
are hopeful that out of the Islamic conference in Kuwait next<br />
week there will be some sort of strong statement which may possibly<br />
lead to positive developments there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you were talking about peace and<br />
the probable optimism that exists here. Would you say that it<br />
could have helped had you allowed the conference on Palestine<br />
to take place in Australia with the admission of the PLO<br />
representative? PM: I think it would have had-no influence upon what-was happening<br />
here at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Not here but in the peace process?<br />
PM: No, I don't think that of itself it would have made any<br />
difference. JOURNALIST: Mr H-awke, did the Jordanian Government PLO<br />
participation in the international conference? And would the<br />
Australian Government support PLO in the conference? / 4 </p>
<p>PM: Obviously, the position of Jordan is that the PLO is a<br />
significant representative body of the Palestinian people. And<br />
they regard the participation of the PLO in the conference concept<br />
as necessary. Our view is that the question of an international<br />
conference and its composition is a matter for the parties. AS<br />
to the position of the PLO. let me put the position this way.<br />
There are really three points which I think are relevant. And<br />
this just doesn't relate to the question of an international<br />
conference. Firstly, the position of Australia has been and remains<br />
that we will not recognise the PLO while it continues to deny<br />
the right of Israel to exist. Secondly, however, we acknowledge<br />
the significance of the PLO as a body representative of Palestinian<br />
interests. And we say that the capacity of the PLO to play a<br />
role would be strengthened to -th eten 7ht__ 1 recognised-the<br />
right of Israel to exist and within that framework recognised<br />
the relevance of resolutions 242 and 338 as--a-basis.-for-negotiat-ion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you been asked to convey any<br />
message from the Jordanian-Governmen t-to -the-I srae--Governmentin<br />
relation to..<br />
PM: No. I haven't been asked to act as messenger. But I think<br />
that the whole content of discussions that one has in these sort<br />
of circumstances in something that is best kept~ except to the<br />
extent which it is appropriate to outline it as I have, best kept<br />
between ourselves. Let me say this that both on my part and on<br />
the part of His Majesty and the Prime Minister we have undertaken<br />
to keep in contact with each other.<br />
JOURNALIST: What explanation have you been given about the Crown<br />
Prince's absence?<br />
PM: I haven't asked for, nor been given.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said that _ you wouldn't Israel<br />
doesn't recognise the PLO equally, how Gen-you..<br />
PM: The term recognition is. I think, somewhat confused in the<br />
question. I don't think there is any doubt about the fact that<br />
Israel recognises that the PLO exists. I was using the phrase<br />
if you like in the technical, diplomatic sense that we. as a<br />
Government in Australia. wouldn't formally recognise the PLO.<br />
That doesn't mean that there has not been contacts between this<br />
Government and representatives of the PLO. And indeed that goes<br />
back to the period before my Government came into office. There<br />
is contact between representatives of my Government and the PLO<br />
that has taken place at diplomatic posts and also at the United<br />
Nations. JOURNALIST: Do you have any specific reason why your Government<br />
turned down the UN request to hold the seminar in Australia?<br />
PM: I wouldn't in fact promote this into a matter of very great<br />
significance. The advice was put to me and which I readily accepted<br />
was that at this stage it was not appropriate this year in 1987<br />
to sponsor that conference in Australia. If the situation arises<br />
at a later date it is open for consideration.<br />
JOURNALIST: In what context are you expecting the situation to<br />
arise? PM: I don't know whether there will be a further request. There </p>
<p>PM: may be at a later date. I am simply saying that the<br />
recommendation that was made to me~ and which I acceptedlapplied<br />
to 1987.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why is it not appropriate?<br />
PM: I guess that if you wish to pursue that you could pursue<br />
it with the Foreign Minister. Part of the reason that was put<br />
to me'that there were other conferences being held in other countries<br />
and there was no necessity in Australia at this stage. I don't<br />
frankly see it as a matter of very great moment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it bear any relationship to the fact that there<br />
is-an--e-ec t ion-th-is-year?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: You have good relations with Israel and the Arab<br />
-world. __ How do you think-Australia can play a major role?<br />
PM: I don't think that we can play a major role. I said that<br />
before I left-Australia. And I take this opportunity of repeating<br />
it. We are very realistic about our position. Firstly, let me<br />
make the points as to why we have a very deep interest in the<br />
situation. Firstly, it is a tragedy for the people in the area.<br />
And is a potential flashpoint for wider conflict in the region<br />
itself and for that reason, obviously, Australia has an interest.<br />
Something like a third of both our exports and our imports pass<br />
through the Suez Canal. A great deal of our international<br />
communication passes through the region. So we have those sorts<br />
of interests in addition. But having said that we are a small<br />
nation of only 16 million people. WE are not a powerful nation.<br />
I think we are a nation which is respected by the major elements<br />
involved in the dispute. And so what I have said, and I hope it<br />
is accepted in this sense , is that we don't therefore suggest or<br />
imply that we can be a mediator--a setiiler. But -simpliy--say t-hat<br />
because of the relations that we have -with the countries in the<br />
region. If they feel that there is any way in which we can, however<br />
small that way may be, to be of assistance then we are prepared<br />
to be so.<br />
JOURNALIST: There have been media reports that there are the<br />
possibility of joint Jordanian and Israeli economic cooperation,<br />
In your talks today was this raised as a possibility?<br />
PM: No. the only part of the discussions which I think could<br />
be relevant to that question. Greg. were that there was a recognition<br />
that some of the sorts of things that have been said by Mr Peres<br />
at the time when he was Prime Minister about possible Israeli<br />
economic assistance in the West Bank was consistent with the sorts<br />
of concepts that are involved with Jordan's-economic development<br />
plan. But in my discussions there was no reference to Israeli/<br />
Jordanian projects.<br />
JOURNALISTS: Are you going to meet with any Palestinian<br />
personal ities?<br />
PM: Yes, I am. I don't know their names at this stage. But<br />
I understand from what I have been told so far they represent 01<br />
cross-section of the Palestinian community in terms of their<br />
religious affiliation, their professions, their status in the<br />
Palestian community, their ou~ Aook and their generational attitudes.<br />
The names at this stage I don t know.,-</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke. NZA1 the involvement of the PLO<br />
representative a factor in the Australian Government's declining<br />
to<br />
PM: it was one of the factors mentioned by the Foreign Minister<br />
in our discussions.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the number of the Arab community in Australia?<br />
PM: It is difficult to put a precise figure on it because of<br />
the classifications in Lhe Census and Statistics form but I think<br />
broadly it would be said that the order of people of Arab or Muslim<br />
background of-the-or-dcr--of--quarter-of-a-m-i-1H-i-on. I_<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Ministerin your interview with Jordanian<br />
television last night~ you were asked the question " how about Jordan's<br />
call for holding an international peace conference what is your<br />
opinion on that. po int?" Andyoit. rqpltied " yes., I believe there<br />
can be a place for such a conference. We raise no objection to<br />
that concept". You then went on and made some other points.<br />
The specific proposal, as I understand it, from Jordan is that<br />
the permanent members of the Security Council would be party to<br />
that. And as I also understand it, I1srael objects to that. Now<br />
in answering that question are you saying that you do accept<br />
the Jordanian concept that the permanent members of the Security<br />
Council would be involved in such a conference?<br />
PM: I think that the concept that they are putting forward is<br />
something that has merit. I have said that. What I am saying<br />
is that it is going to be a matter for the parties to determine<br />
the structure, the procedures and the functions of a conference.<br />
I believe it is the position of the Jordanian Government that<br />
such a conference could not impose decisions that would involve<br />
some discussions on a regional basis and in the end how that<br />
international conference would-be stru~ tured-wo3uld-be -a-matter--<br />
as I say, for resolution between the major parties. What I am<br />
saying is that I see merit in the concept that the Jordanians<br />
are putting forward and it is going to be a matter that has to<br />
be thrashed out between the parties. Clearly, the position of<br />
the Jordanians in something which must be taken into account.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could I ask as a follow-up question that if. in fact,<br />
one of the stumbling blocks to that conference is Israel's objection<br />
to the Soviet Union's involvement. Given that the Israeli Prime<br />
Minister has already foreshadowed that he may ask you for your<br />
assistance in the release of Soviet Jews to Israel, do you feel<br />
that there is any place for you to raise in turn with the Israeli<br />
Prime Minister that perhaps there may be some way that Israel's<br />
objections could be broken down if that is a stumbling block?<br />
PM: Obviously, when I meet the Prime Minister and the Deputy<br />
Prime Minister/ Foreign Minister. Mr Peres, I will be having detailed<br />
discussions with them about this whole issue. And I don't intend<br />
to prejudice the discussions that I intend to have with Mr Shamir<br />
and Mr Peres by making some announcements in advance. But I go<br />
into those discussions with a very deep commitment to do whatever<br />
I can to assist the processes of achieving a peaceful resolution<br />
of this dispute. I don't think whatever small part Australia may<br />
be able to play would be assisted by making some public announcement<br />
in advance of how I will approach those discussions. But I will<br />
be doing evcrything I can possibly can to assist the process. </p>
<p>7.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke. on that point. Though you stress that<br />
you are riot here as a mediator or advocat e, have there been any<br />
specific sucjqestiuns about how you could contribute to the peace<br />
process? PM: I think in the dIiscussions we have had today certdin Lhinqs<br />
have flowed from that, but I repeat it is not appropriate when<br />
you have di scuss ions withi one government. and you are going on<br />
to have discuss]. ons with another that you indicate what may flow<br />
frmthe one into the oLher. You doni; conduct disciussioris ' In<br />
that way, 1 certairtly dor. t..<br />
-Y. IjURNAL [ S1 You--give-the -fee .1-i rig-you-ca-rr-y-i-nq--a-mes-s-age--i1Shri--<br />
waiiting for an answer?<br />
PZ: No. I am not Carrying a' message7.' What-has hfa-ppened. is that<br />
have been given a very particular opportunity ot hearin i<br />
." he f rankes possible way the views of His Majesty dtnd of the<br />
Prime M4inister. They could not have been more forthicomig, more<br />
frank, more courteous. more friendify in the exposition they have<br />
given me of the vie-w of the Jordanian Government. Now that put-,<br />
me in a positionl where in my discussions with the Israeli<br />
Government that i am able to do so with that fullest possiole<br />
knowledge. And all L am saying and all I am intending to con-vey<br />
the answers that I have given is that I don't think it is useful<br />
that I should say in advance of meating Mr Shamir and<br />
Mr Peres this is what che King said, this is what the Prime<br />
Min~ ister said and this is what I am going to say to. the Prime<br />
tirtSter of T sraeL and the Foreign Minister of I1srael on the<br />
basis of what I have been told here. That is not the way 1 condlUCt<br />
myself. Blut you are not to confer from what is a sensible and<br />
intelligeriL response that I am making to you to conctiide thiat<br />
" Ir Hawke qas got a message which he is takiny arnd he Is not qoing<br />
to teli you. That is not a logical conclusion to arrive at.<br />
JOURNALIST: From you own point of vi. ew and particularly in<br />
view of today's talks, do you believe that there is more common<br />
ground now between Israel and jordan than in the past?<br />
PM: It is not possible. Kerry, to give a final answer to that<br />
question, obviously, until I have spoken with the Israeli<br />
Government. By definition. I don't know the answer to that question<br />
until I have spoken with them. But what I can say is that I couldn't<br />
have been more impressed than I have been with the integrity and<br />
commitment of His Majesty and of his Gov. ernmient. They are seeking<br />
with great steadfastness I believe to secure a just and reasonable<br />
and lasting resolution to this dispute. I am now-in a position<br />
as a result of my talks to know that with completeness. f am<br />
in a position to know the nature of their thinking.-And alL A<br />
can say is that I believe from listening to-His Majesty and to<br />
the Prime Minister that there ought to be, albeit throughl perhaps<br />
somewhat protracted processes, prolonged negotiations -' that tier<br />
ought to be a basis for finding a resolution of this dispute.<br />
But 1 can't obviously answer until I have had the opportunity<br />
of talking with the Prime Minister and with Mr Peres. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Did the Royal Couple show any interest in the America's<br />
Cup? PM: They did, indeed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any bets?<br />
PM: No, but I think I am not disclosing a state secret if I indicate<br />
that they are hoping for an Australian victory.<br />
ENDS I. </p>
