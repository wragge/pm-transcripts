FOR PRESS: PM. No. 20/ 1972<br />
RESEARCH CENTRE FOR COMMONWEALTH/ S TATE<br />
FINANCIAL RELATIONS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, tn e Rt. Hon. William<br />
McMahon, CHI. 14P<br />
The Commonwealth Government favours the establishment,<br />
within the Australian-National University in Canberra, of an<br />
independent Research Centre to pursue studies in the general field<br />
of Commonwealth/ State financial relations.<br />
Iis in mind that the research should embrace all<br />
aspects of Comnmonwealth/ State financial relationships, should<br />
provide for post-graduate study in this field and that the resuilts<br />
of the research be published. The Centre will, however, act on<br />
its own initiative in relation to these matters.<br />
We are in touch with the ANU regarding the establishment<br />
of the Centre and provision for the project in the ANU's submission<br />
to the Australian Universities Commission on the understanding that<br />
the Commonwealth will allocate special funds for the purpose.<br />
CANBERRA, 14 February, 1972. </p>
