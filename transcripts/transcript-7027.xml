PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THIRTEENTH INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA 3 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS YOUR GROUP HAS CONSIDERED A WIDE<br />
RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW ISSUES BEARING UPON THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE REST OF THE<br />
WORLD. HOWEVER, I SEE THIS CONFERENCE IN PART AS A SEQUEL<br />
TO THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AUSTRALIA-CHINA TRADE AND<br />
INVESTMENT LAW CONFERENCE HELD IN BEIJING AND SHANGHAI IN<br />
OCTOBER LAST YEAR. ACCORDINGLY, I COME TO ADDRESS YOU THIS<br />
MORNING WITH A PARTICULAR INTEREST AND FOCUS. THAT IS THE<br />
POTENTIAL FOR YOUR DISCUSSIONS TO IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING<br />
AND HARMONISATION OF AUSTRALIAN AND CHINESE TRADE LAW SO<br />
THAT WE CAN BUILD FURTHER ON THE RAPID GROWTH IN TRADE<br />
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. FOR THIS REASON I AM PLEASED<br />
THAT TODAY'S DISCUSSIONS WILL BE ON PRECISELY THAT TOPIC.<br />
I WOULD LIKE THEREFORE TO EXTEND A WARM PERSONAL WELCOME,<br />
AND A WELCOME ON BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, TO THE<br />
DELEGATION FROM CHINA LED BY MR JING SHUPING. YOU HAVE COME<br />
TO AUSTRALIA AS FRIENDS AND I TRUST YOU WILL M4AKE NEW<br />
FRIENDS HERE AND LEAVE OUR SHORES WITH EVEN STRONGER<br />
CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF THE WARM RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR<br />
PEOPLES. OVER THE YEARS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, CHINA<br />
AND AUSTRALIA HAVE DEVELOPED AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP AT<br />
ALL LEVELS COMMERCIAL, CULTURAL AND OF COURSE, POLITICAL.<br />
INDEED AUSTRALIA'S FRIENDSHIP WITH CHINA NOW HAS SUCH A<br />
SPECIAL CHARACTER AND WARMTH, AND THE COMPLEMENTARITY OF OUR<br />
ECONOMIES IS SUCH, THAT I BELIEVE WE CAN LOOK FORWARD WITH<br />
ENORMOUS ENTHUSIASM TO STRONG GROWTH IN TRADE AND INVESTMENT<br />
CO-OPERATION OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES FOR THE GREATER<br />
PROSPERITY OF BOTH OUR NATIONS.<br />
LIONEL BOWEN HAS SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT THE RANGE OF<br />
INITIATIVES ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW IN WHICH AUSTRALIA IS<br />
TAKING PART. I DO NOT THEREFORE NEED TO COVER THAT<br />
IMPORTANT GROUND IN ANY DETAIL. RATHER, I WOULD LIKE TO<br />
SHARE SOME THOUGHTS WITH YOU ON THE TRADING OPPORTUNITIES<br />
THAT YOU CAN HELP CREATE AND EXPLOIT FOR AUSTRALIA AND CHINA<br />
THROUGH YOUR LEGAL EXPERTISE. </p>
<p>SINO-AUSTRALIAN TRADE HAS GROWN BY AN ASTONISHING 135 PER<br />
CENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS, THOUGH THIS HAS BEEN FROM A<br />
FAIRLY SMALL BASE. BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY<br />
FEATURES OF OUR TWO ECONOMIES, CHINA HAS BEEN ABLE TO DRAW<br />
UPON THE STRENGTHS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY TO HELP CARRY<br />
FORWARD ITS MODERNISATION PROGRAM. AUSTRALIA TOO HAS<br />
BENEFITED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE COMPLEMENTARITY THAT EXISTS<br />
IN OUR MINERALS, STEEL, AGRICULTURAL AND TRANSPORT AND<br />
COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES.<br />
IN RECOGNITION OF THESE MUTUAL DEVELOPMENT ACHIEVEMENTS AND<br />
PROSPECTS, THE AUSTRALIAN AND CHINESE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PUT<br />
IN PLACE FORMAL SECTORAL INITIATIVES FOR IRON AND STEEL,<br />
NON-FERROUS METALS, WOOL, TRANSPORT AND EDUCATION.<br />
REINFORCING THESE INITIATIVES, THE AUSTRALIAN TRADE<br />
COMMISSION HAS DEVELOPED A CHINA ACTION PLAN DESIGNED<br />
SPECIFICALLY TO CO-ORDINATE AND FOSTER OUR TRADE PROMOTION<br />
EFFORTS WITH CHINA.<br />
YOU IN THE AUDIENCE FACE BOTH A CHALLENGE AND A<br />
RESPONSIBILITY, SHARED WITH THE TWO GOVERNMENTS, TO ENSURE<br />
THAT OUR LEGAL SYSTEMS DO NOT UNNECESSARILY IMPEDE THE<br />
PURSUIT OF TRADING OPPORTUNITIES. THIS REQUIRES US TO<br />
DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER'S LEGAL SYSTEMS AS<br />
THE BEAR UPON TRADE AND TO WORK TOGETHER IN REMOVING<br />
UNNECESSARY TRADE IMPEDIMENTS AND CREATING A MORE CERTAIN<br />
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TRADE CAN BE CONDUCTED.<br />
YOU ALSO HAVE A KEY ROLE TO PLAY IN ADVISING GOVERNMENTS ON<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT, STREAMLINING AND REFORM OF LEGAL<br />
ARRANGEMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT BETWEEN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND CHINA.<br />
CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN THESE ASPECTS OF TRADE LAW HAS BEEN<br />
ACHIEVED ALREADY UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE MEMORANDUM OF<br />
UNDERSTANDING ON LEGAL EXCHANGES BETWEEN CHINA AND<br />
AUSTRALIA. THE LEGAL EXCHANGE PROGRAM IS BEARING FRUIT AND<br />
THE ATTENDANCE LAST YEAR OF 50 AUSTRALIAN LAWYERS AT THE<br />
AUSTRALIA CHINA TRADE AND INVESTMENT LAW CONFERENCE IN<br />
BEIJING AND SHANGHAI UNDERLINES THE COMMITMENT OF OUR LEGAL<br />
PROFESSIONALS TO IMPROVING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE TWO<br />
COUNTRIES' LEGAL SYSTEMS.<br />
WE ARE DELIGHTED WITH THE FINALISATION A COUPLE OF MONTHS<br />
AGO OF LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR CITIC'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE<br />
PORTLAND ALUMINIUM SMELTER. THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE GAINED<br />
IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS, CHINA WILL BE BETTER PLACED TO CONDUCT<br />
NEGOTIATIONS ON THE MANY NEW COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH<br />
AUSTRALIA THAT UNDOUBTEDLY WILL ARISE IN THE FUTURE.<br />
WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT VERY RECENTLY BY<br />
THE PROSPECT OF CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN WHEAT<br />
BOARD AND CHINA'S MINISTRY OF COMMERCE IN ESTABLISHING A<br />
TRAINING BAKERY IN CHINA. </p>
<p>AND OF COURSE, THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED AGREEMENT ON<br />
PRINCIPLES OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR INCLUSION IN THE<br />
AUSTRALIA-CHINA TRADE AGREEMENT IS A M4AJOR STEP FORWARD.<br />
THESE PRINCIPLES ENCOURAGE THE USE OF FRIENDLY CONSULTATIONS<br />
AND CONCILIATION AND IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE NEED<br />
ARISES, OF ARBITRATION IN A THIRD COUNTRY. THIS WILL HAVE<br />
THE DESIRABLE EFFECT OF PROMOTING GREATER CERTAINTY AND<br />
PREDICTABILITY IN OUR COMMERCIAL DEALINGS WITH EACH OTHER.<br />
I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE MY GOVERNMENT ATTACHES<br />
TO AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA. NOR CAN I<br />
OVEREMPHASISE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN<br />
FACILITATING AND ENCOURAGING THE COMMERCIAL TIES BETWEEN OUR<br />
TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
WHILE I HAVE FOCUSED ON THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF CHINA TO<br />
AUSTRALIA, MUCH OF WHAT I HAVE SAID ALSO APPLIES TO THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE<br />
ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION. WE MUST ACTIVELY PURSUE THE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED TO US BY THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
THIS REGION.<br />
COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION HAVE COME TO ACCOUNT<br />
FOR A MAJOR PORTION OF AUSTRALIA'S TRADE: OUR ASIAN<br />
NEIGHBOURS ALONE PURCHASED AROUND 60 PER CENT OF OUR EXPORTS<br />
LAST YEAR.<br />
YET, DESPITE THE GEOGRAPHIC AND SUPPLY POSITION ADVANTAGES<br />
WE ENJOY IN THE REGION, AUSTRALIA'S SHARE OF THESE MARKETS<br />
HAS BEEN DECLINING. THIS M4AY BE EXPLAINED IN PART BY THE<br />
COMPOSITION OF OUR EXPORT PRODUCTS COMPARED WITH THE<br />
CHANGING DEMANDS OF THESE COUNTRIES AS THEY GROW AND<br />
DEVELOP. BUT AUSTRALIAN MANAGEMENT ITSELF AT TIMES HAS<br />
ADMITTED THAT IT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH IN<br />
SEEKING OUT NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW MARKETS. TO HELP<br />
PROMOTE OUR SUCCESS IN THE REGION AUSTRADE HAS IN PLACE<br />
STRATEGIES NOT ONLY FOR CHINA, BUT MEASURES TO IMPROVE OUR<br />
TRADING PERFORMANCE IN THE REGION AS A WHOLE.<br />
BUT AS WITH CHINA, THE CHALLENGE FOR TODAY'S AUDIENCE IS TO<br />
SEEK WAYS OF ENCOURAGING GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND<br />
HARMONISATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE<br />
REGION IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT TRADE AND INVESTMENT FLOWS<br />
ARE NOT UNNECESSARILY INHIBITED. OUR COUNTRIES HAVE SHOWN A<br />
WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO CO-OPERATE REGIONALLY ON A<br />
MULTILATERAL STRATEGY THROUGH THE REGIONAL TRADE INITIATIVE.<br />
I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE SIMILAR SUCCESS IN<br />
DEVELOPING AN UNDERSTANDING OF ONE ANOTHER'S LEGAL SYSTEMS<br />
AS THEY AFFECT TRADE AND INVESTMENT.<br />
THIS CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW IS TAKING PLACE<br />
AT A TIME WHEN THE INTERNATIONAL RULES ON FAIR TRADING ARE<br />
BEING BENT, M4ANIPULATED AND BROKEN IN SUCH A CAVALIER<br />
FASHION THAT THE VIABILITY OF THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM HAS<br />
BEEN PUT UNDER THREAT. DURING THE LAST DECADE OR SO,<br />
GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BECOME MORE PROTECTIONIST<br />
AND FAR MORE PRONE TO USING NON-TARIFF BARRIERS TO<br />
CIRCUMVENT INTERNATIONAL TRADING RULES. </p>
<p>IN MANY INSTANCES SAME COUNTRIES HAVE DUMPED ONTO WORLD<br />
MARKETS ENORMOUS SURPLUSES, ESPECIALLY OF AGRICULTURAL<br />
PRODUCTS, BROUGHT INTO PRODUCTION BY THE DOMESTIC PRICE<br />
SUPPORT AND EXPORT SUBSIDY PROGRAMS OF THEIR GOVERNMENTS.<br />
IN RESPONDING TO SHORT-TERM POLITICAL PRESSURE BY RAISING<br />
NON-TARIFF BARRIERS SO-CALLED " NEO-PROTECTIONISM"<br />
GOVERNMENTS HAVE SACRIFICED THE FREE FLOW OF TRADE AND ALONG<br />
WITH IT, THE PROSPECT OF IMPROVED LIVING STANDARDS NOT ONLY<br />
IN OTHER COUNTRIES BUT IRONICALLY, AT HOME.<br />
UNTIL RECENTLY, THE DOMESTIC COSTS OF PROTECTION HAVE BEEN<br />
ALL BUT INVISIBLE, IN SPITE OF THEIR VERY GREAT MAGNITUDE<br />
AND THEIR VERY REAL HUMAN DIMENSION. THE SHROUD OF<br />
PROTECTIONISM TOUCHES EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY, THROUGH THE<br />
HIGHER PRICES THAT MUST BE PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS OF<br />
PROTECTED INDUSTRIES AND THROUGH LOST JOB OPPORTUNITIES.<br />
JUST ONE INDICATION OF THE HUMAN DIMENSION OF THESE COSTS IS<br />
THE MILLION OR SO EXTRA PEOPLE THROWN ONTO THE DOLE QUEUES<br />
OF EUROPE BY THE DISTORTING EFFECTS OF THE COMMON<br />
AGRICULTURAL POLICY.<br />
IN PLAYING THE PROTECTION GAME, GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN<br />
GETTING THEIR FINGERS BURNT. RETALIATION BY AGGRIEVED<br />
NATIONS HAS ESCALATED BORDER SKIRMISHES TO MUCH WIDER TRADE<br />
CONFLICTS AND IN THE CASE OF AGRICULTURE, TO AN ALL-OUT<br />
TRADE WAR.<br />
FORTUNATELY, THE FUTILITY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE CONFLICTS<br />
IS NOW BEGINNING TO FIND EXPRESSION IN WHAT HAS BEEN UNTIL<br />
RECENTLY A SILENT MAJORITY. SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF<br />
$ US100 BILLION A YEAR IS BEING CHANNELLED INTO AGRICULTURE<br />
BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY THROUGH PRICE SUPPORT AND DIRECT<br />
BUDGETARY SUBSIDIES. THE COST TO AMERICAN TAXPAYERS OF THE<br />
US FARM ACT IS EXPECTED TO BLOW OUT THIS YEAR FROM<br />
BILLION TO AROUND SUSSO BILLION.<br />
THERE ARE SIGNS THAT TAXPAYERS AND CONSUMERS ARE BECOMING<br />
INCREASINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT BEING CALLED UPON TO<br />
SUBSIDISE INEFFICIENT INDUSTRIES. THIS DAWNING REALISATION<br />
OF THE FUTILITY OF TRADE CONFLICTS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A<br />
MAJOR DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE RECENT MINISTERIAL AGREEMENT<br />
AT URUGUAY TO LAUNCH A NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE<br />
NEGOTIATIONS. THE MINISTERIAL DECLARATION LAUNCHING A NEW ROUND PROVIDES,<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME, A BASIS UPON WHICH AGRICULTURE AND<br />
SERVICES CAN BE DISCUSSED MEANINGFULLY IN INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRADE NEGOTIATIONS ALONG WITH THE MORE TRADITIONAL<br />
DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE VARIOUS MTN ROUNDS<br />
ON TRADE BARRIERS AFFECTING MANUFACTURED GOODS. THE TASK<br />
NOW IS TO PROCEED WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY TO TRANSLATE THOSE<br />
WORDS INTO A SET OF BINDING OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PUT INTO<br />
PRACTICE. </p>
<p>THAT ENTAILS DEVELOPING A SET OF SUSTAINABLE INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRADING RULES AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES WHICH<br />
ENGENDER IN NATIONS RENEWED CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ALL CAN<br />
SHARE IN THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL GAINS FROM UNFETTERED<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADE.<br />
AUSTRALIA LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CHINA IN SECURING<br />
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GATT. WE HAVE<br />
ACTIVELY SUPPORTED CHINA'S INTEREST IN JOINING THE GATT AND<br />
OUR OFFICIALS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER IN CANBERRA ON HOW<br />
CHINESE MEMBERSHIP MIGHT BE MOST EFFECTIVELY PROGRESSED. WE<br />
ARE ALSO PLEASED TO BE PROVIDING, UNDER A MEMORANDUM OF<br />
UNDERSTANDING SIGNED DURING MY VISIT TO CHINA IN MAY THIS<br />
YEAR, A CONSULTANT TO WORK IN CHINA SPECIFICALLY ON THIS<br />
ISSUE.<br />
THROUGH ITS PARTICIPATION AS AN OBSERVER AT THE GATT MEETING<br />
IN PUNTA DEL ESTE, CHINA HAS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP ABREAST OF<br />
DEVELOPMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW MTN<br />
ROUND. CHINA'S ACCESSION TO THE GATT WILL FURTHER CONTRIBUTE TO A<br />
STABLE AND SECURE FRAMEWORK OF LAW, POLICY AND PRINCIPLE<br />
WITHIN WHICH ENTERPRISES FROM CHINA AND AUSTRALIA CAN TAKE<br />
FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADE<br />
AND INVESTMENT BOTH WAYS, TO OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT.<br />
TO CONCLUDE, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE ROLE OF THE LEGAL<br />
PROFESSION IN FACILITATING AND EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL TRADE<br />
HAS NOT BEEN WELL RECOGNISED TO DATE. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU<br />
THAT, AS PRIME MINISTER OF A NATION TO WHICH TRADE IS VITAL,<br />
I FULLY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITY OF LAWYERS IN IDENTIFYING AND EXPLOITING<br />
TRADING OPPORTUNITIES. I AM HEARTENED BY YOUR ATTENDANCE AT<br />
THIS IMPORTANT FORUM AND I WISH YOU WELL IN YOUR<br />
DELIBERATIONS. </p>
