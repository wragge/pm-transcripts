UTALIAL<br />
PRIME IMINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SATURDAY 31 MALY 1980<br />
SPEECH TO THE YOUNG LIBERALS<br />
IN THE GREAT HALL NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
' I am happy to be here tonight and to share a birthday with you.<br />
The Young Liberal movement was ten years old when I entered<br />
Parliament. I suppose it could be said, without exaggeration, that the<br />
y/ ears since then have been years of excitement and innovation;<br />
years which have confirmed Liberalism as the driving political<br />
force behind Australia's progress.<br />
Tonight provides a fitting opportunity to acknowledge the<br />
contribution during this time by the Young Liberal movement.<br />
" It s efforts have been characterised by a consciousness of the<br />
need to be attuned to the problems and the potentialities of<br />
young Australia.<br />
In order that we meet this need adequately, it is important to<br />
recruit more and more of each generation of young Australians<br />
to the cause of Liberalism; to enjoin them with us in an<br />
unyielding commitment to meet successfully the challenges that<br />
confront us.<br />
rphe passage of 25 years since my entry into Parliament has<br />
strengthened me in the belief that, as Australians, we have an<br />
unrivalled inheritance in Australia.<br />
We have increasing responsibilities to protect that inheritance.<br />
What I want to suggest to you tonight, is that we must never<br />
vacate the battlefield on which is waged the fight for Australia's<br />
freedom and values the fight for our very security.<br />
Those who have preceded us, by sacrifice and example, are the<br />
source of our rich legacy.<br />
Now, opportunities beckon us which, if taken, promise to make<br />
our inheritance even greater for generations who follow.<br />
That is why, in celebrating a birthday, in reflecting on the<br />
passing of another year or another decade, we need to ask<br />
ourselves whether as individuals, as a movement, or as a nation<br />
we are growing up as well as growi; ng older. </p>
<p>2<br />
Because we are a bit older, we need also to expect that we are<br />
bit wiser; a bit clearer * about what we want from our country;<br />
bit more committed to the part we are to play in the nobler<br />
tasks of humanity.<br />
. Phis will require from us the determination to seek f-' rom our<br />
philosophy a relevance for the times ahead.<br />
years ago, it would have been difficult to anticipate the<br />
changes that have occurred since then, at home and abDroad.<br />
At home, in 1955, there were ten universities in Australia; now<br />
there are nineteen.<br />
There were 49,000 students in tertiary education; now there are<br />
317,000.<br />
There were 220 vehicles per thousand head of population; in 1979<br />
there were 490.<br />
And our national development has undergone trememdous change.<br />
A rich, artistic and cultural talent today complements our<br />
national performance.<br />
The world of theatre, opera, ballet, film science, literature<br />
and sport has produced great Australians.<br />
our record at home and abroad is a catalogue of diversity and<br />
achievement; for our size, perhaps unparalleled throughout the<br />
world. Yet, on the international front, even in 1955, there was an air<br />
of world uncertainty.<br />
Australian soldiers had been involved in the Korean conflict<br />
only a few years before.<br />
one year earlier, a European power had been defeated in Vietnam;<br />
and in Europe, the Cold War continued to threaten another disaster<br />
involving the, . great powers.<br />
At th -at time, as young Australian men and women, none of us would<br />
have been able to say with confidence that there would be no<br />
world war for 25 years.<br />
Yet that has been the case in spite of major and tragic conflict<br />
especially in South East Asia and Africa.<br />
Perhaps one of the consequences of a long interval of relative<br />
peace has been the very real danger that those for whom peace<br />
and freedom are secure, lose sight of the predicament of those<br />
to whom both are denied.<br />
That those who enjoy the privileges of freedom become complacent<br />
about the need for vigilance in its defence.<br />
Generations in the West have grown up without knowing the horror<br />
of war; without understanding the price of freedom; without<br />
having an example in their lifetime of the barbarism of which<br />
mankind is capable. </p>
<p>This is a momentous achievement which we must continue to defend.<br />
Indeed, in the period since 1955, many of us in the West have<br />
been part of an era of unprecedented economic expansion.<br />
As part of that expansion, two new powers, Japan and Germany<br />
emerged from the wreckage of World War II.<br />
Two former enemies, now our friends, provide for Australia a<br />
greater sense of security and a stronger alliance in the free<br />
world. This is symptomatic of many changes in the world order; a simple<br />
index of that change is the rise of nation states reflected by<br />
membership of the United Nations.<br />
At the beginning of 1955, there were 56 member states.<br />
Today the membership is 152.<br />
These new members are predominantly from Africa and Asiaformer<br />
colonies of the European empires.<br />
This has meaint reduced political domination by Europe with the<br />
emergence of the Third World as an increasingly powerful force<br />
in world affairs.<br />
Further, the concept of monolithic communism that arose from the<br />
Second World War has also changed.<br />
The disillusionment of China with Soviet behaviour, during the<br />
period when the two were closely allied, is manifest in<br />
continuing Chinese distrust of Soviet imperialism and in China's<br />
determination, now, to pursue its own course.<br />
The same spirit of independence guided Tito's Yugoslavia.<br />
In this way, both countries have come to play important roles<br />
in world affairs.<br />
With these-and ' other changes, and our relative remoteness over<br />
yea... from major-international disturbances, has come a change<br />
in attitudes.<br />
For too long, there has been a pernicious complacency surrounding<br />
much of the well-being we enjoy.<br />
our advantages have been, to some, de-valued by familiarity.<br />
For too many, the contrasts between political systems have<br />
become blurred.<br />
Too often, the delusion is promoted that many of the benefits<br />
of democracy are consistent with socialism; that most social<br />
systems have the same fundamental objectives; that a free<br />
society can survive without effort, without will, without<br />
commitment. This view is taken by those with so little understanding of the<br />
incomparable benefits and virtues of democracy that they are<br />
willing to allow them to be chipped away. </p>
<p>By people with so little understanding of the future, that the<br />
present does not matter that much.<br />
By people who are luke warm and uncommitted to idealism and<br />
. Liberalism; uncritical of socialism or communism.<br />
By people who ask apologetically, what is in a name?<br />
By people with so little to believe in that they have nothing<br />
to defend.<br />
When an appreciation of the virtues of a way of life is lost,<br />
there is no will for its defence.<br />
Is it not time to understand that what we de-value today, we<br />
may lose tomorrow?<br />
Is it not time to ask whether we have taken the precious gift<br />
of continuing peace too much for granted; whether we have been<br />
spoiled by economic growth; whether we have been in receipt of<br />
so much of the world's goodness that we have become blind to<br />
the world's threats.<br />
There are those who argue that our blindness derives from a<br />
convenient habit of accommodating the behaviour of many<br />
countries and regimes which pose as the enemies of freedom.<br />
Solzhenitsyn argued only a few years ago that:<br />
" The anguish of a divided world gave birth to the<br />
theory of convergence between the leading Western<br />
countries and the Soviet Union."<br />
He spoke of this as:<br />
" A soothing theory which overlooks the fact that<br />
these worlds are not at all evolving towards each<br />
other and that neither one can be transformed into<br />
the other without violence."<br />
" Besides," he said, " convergence inevitably means acceptance of<br />
the other side's defects and this can hardly suit anyone."<br />
We seem to have moved too close to a tolerance of the defects<br />
and human misery inflicted on peoples of the world by oppressive<br />
regimes. Indeed, it was the acceptance by the West of the defects of the<br />
Soviet Union in the period since World War II, that prompted<br />
Solzhenitsyn to proclaim that a decline in courage, is the most<br />
striking feature, that an outside observer notices in the West.<br />
Acknowledging the existence of courageous individuals in public<br />
life and in the influencing of events of the West, Solzhenitsyn<br />
went to to condemn those who exhibit: </p>
<p>" A depression, passivity and perplexity in their<br />
actions and their statements; even more so in their<br />
self-serving rationale as to how morally justified<br />
it is to base policies on weakness and cowardice."<br />
He spoke of these forces in the West as being:<br />
" Tongue-tied and paralysed when they deal with powerful<br />
government and threatening forces; with aggressors and<br />
international terrorists."<br />
It is not easy to dismiss such criticism.<br />
Especially when the Soviet leadership has shown, all too often,<br />
that where it perceives the opportunity for a Soviet advance,<br />
the concern for peace is instantly put aside.<br />
Remember the invasion of Hungary in 1956; the Berlin Wall in<br />
1961; the Cuban missile crisis in 1962; the invasion of<br />
Czechoslovakia in 1968.<br />
We do not need to condemn them; for them condemn themselves.<br />
In the wake of instability and tension created by this behaviour,<br />
attempts at Detente developed in the early<br />
But it soon became apparent, that Detente meant different things<br />
to different people.<br />
Under its umbrella, while the United States diminished its relative<br />
expenditure on defence, Soviet defence spending remained high<br />
and absorbed 11-13 per cent of the total Soviet income each year.<br />
The comparable United States figure was around 5 per cent.<br />
Detente, in the sense of meaning a lessening of tensions,<br />
applied in Europe; but elsewhere it had no meaning at all.<br />
It is doubtful if the high expectations raised by Detente were<br />
ever justified..<br />
Spea) king on Dioscow radio on November 12, 1968, President Brezhnev<br />
had outlined the extent to which the Soviet Union would go to<br />
protect socialism, when he said:<br />
".. the establishment and defence of the soveegt<br />
of states which have embarked upon the road of building<br />
socialism is of particular significance for us communists<br />
when internal and external forces hostile to socialism<br />
seek to reverse the development of any socialist country<br />
towards a restoration of the capitalist order this is<br />
the concern of all socialist countries."<br />
Here is explicit proof of the Soviet determination that once<br />
a country adopts socialism, it will be prevented by the Soviet<br />
Union from ever throwing off its shackles. 6 </p>
<p>And after Detente had been welcomed in Western Europe, President<br />
Brezhnev himself proclaimed that Detente:<br />
"... does not in the slightest abolish, nor can it<br />
abolish or alter the laws of the class struggle."<br />
As a result, since Detente, we have seen the Soviet Union actively and<br />
openly seeking to further its international influence by<br />
subversion, by the provision of arms and the use of surrogates in:<br />
Angola Ethiopia The Yemen and<br />
Vietnam.<br />
Of course, the most recent and most brazen example has been in<br />
Afghanistan. As a result of this invasion, the Soviet Union has so far succeeded in<br />
achieving: the creation of a buffer state<br />
a closer proximity to the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean<br />
acc~ ess to alternative bases for strategic aircraft,<br />
should the USSR desire it<br />
an ability to deploy troops across the Pakistani border<br />
an inherent ability, depending on the type of aircraft<br />
that may be deployed, to provide tactical air support<br />
over the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea and the eastern<br />
half of Saudi-Arabia.<br />
the inherent ability to provide limited air support to<br />
the Soviet Indian Ocean squadron.<br />
W ho could deny that these developments represent an unqualified<br />
threat in a critical region of the world.<br />
In these circumstances, there is no substitute for effective<br />
co-operation in the support of national independence and<br />
individual freedoms.<br />
There is no substitute for effective co-operation in the defence<br />
of vajtues we cherish.<br />
In all our history we have stood with allies when values important<br />
to our way of life were threatened.<br />
Unless like minded countries and people so stand today, one by<br />
one we will fall, diminishing everywhere, liberty and the right<br />
tLo be free.<br />
This is the lesson of history.<br />
It is the lesson that has not been learnt by our political<br />
opponents.<br />
Why is it that Mr. Hayden accuses President Carter of election<br />
year politics almost as though President Carter had engineered<br />
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? 7 </p>
<p>In his eagerness to criticise the Australian Government<br />
Mr. Hayden slips into the error of seeming to make excuses for<br />
t~ he Soviet Union.<br />
Ir know he says that he opposes the invasion of Afghanistan.<br />
Yet he and his Party have put themselves in the position of<br />
opposing measures designed to send a clear signal of our<br />
abhorrence and determination to the Soviet Government and people.<br />
We are entitled to know why.<br />
Trhe recent months have provided a new and significant opportunity<br />
. for independently minded countries, individuals and thinkers to<br />
indicate that this is the time when we must demonstrate a<br />
collective international rejection of Soviet imperialism.<br />
This opportunity has been welcomed and accepted by countries in<br />
our region: by Fiji; by Indonesia; by Malaysia; by Papua New Guinea;<br />
' by the Philippines;. by Singapore; by'Thailand; by China.<br />
. By our powerful trading partners and friends: Japan, Canada and<br />
Germany.<br />
And in New Zealand, where the Olympic Committee has decided to<br />
go to Moscow, the Leader of the Labor Party has joined with the<br />
Government in a strong call, as recently as 15 April, that<br />
New Zealand should<br />
" take the strongest possible stand against<br />
competing at the Games."<br />
Is it strange or is it natural that the Australian Labor Party,.<br />
in the fLace of such concerted support for freedom and national<br />
independence stands as the odd man out?<br />
The decisions concerning participation at Moscow are decisions<br />
concerning national and international priorities and principles.<br />
The United States of America is the unchallenged leader of the<br />
free world.<br />
It x Ernffiins the only country with the power ultimately to defend<br />
the free world.<br />
To undermine support for this power, is to insult the priority<br />
we give to freedom and to deny the recognition we owe to those<br />
strong enough or willing enough to defend it.<br />
A new international challenge confronts us.<br />
But challenge has been with us throughout history.<br />
It has involved nations, and men and women, in difficult choices,<br />
significant decisions. </p>
<p>Such decisions and choices always have greater significance<br />
for young people, the quality of whose lives in the years<br />
ahead depend so much on the response that is made to challenge<br />
no0w. Wie need to understand the challenge, the danger, the threat.<br />
Wie need a clear eye for our own objectives; a firm hand in<br />
reaching our goals.<br />
L-et us proclaim the principles that guide the values we defend.<br />
WThen decisions appear hard and complex let us look to our<br />
principles and our objectives in order to clear the course that<br />
we must pursue.<br />
B~ ut in pursuing our principles and values, we must remember that<br />
the Soviet Union is also of this world; that, ultimately, they<br />
and we must find a means of living together if peace is to endure.<br />
It must be understood that our determination is not directed<br />
against the Russian people; but against the policies of expansion<br />
and domination pursued by the Soviet leadership.<br />
Trhese policies have come together in Afghanistan.<br />
Trhat is why world leaders and individuals, concerned for human<br />
values, concerned for the cause of mankind, have determined to<br />
send a clear signal to Moscow.<br />
A signal, whose strength demonstrates to the Soviet Union that<br />
-the judgements of the world cannot be ignored.<br />
Each of us has a role to play in sending that signal.<br />
E'ach of us has a commitment to our own future.<br />
Without that commitment, our freedom and, perhaps, in the end,<br />
its existence will not be sustained.<br />
' rhis is why e'a'ch generation must be prepared to defend for<br />
itself the righ+-: to liberty, if liberty and the pursuit of<br />
happiness are to be guaranteed and secured.<br />
What we defend is an inheritance which extends beyond the span<br />
of a lifetime.<br />
roday's responsibility is ours.<br />
Let us fulfill it well. 000---</p>
