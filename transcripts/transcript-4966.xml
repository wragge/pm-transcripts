MR. NIXON INTERVIEWED: MINISTERIAL TRAVEL<br />
FROM ABC'S " NATIONWIDE" ( 23/ 2/ 79)<br />
There was a short debate in the Parliament tonight on, as it was<br />
put, the extravagant costs of Ministerial travel. A lot of<br />
mud was thrown by the Opposition, but the Government could hardly<br />
complain they were equally eager to employ the same tactics<br />
when they had the opportunity.<br />
Shadow Transport Minister, Mr. Peter Morris, the man who threw<br />
the mud today, is in Canberra with Richard Carlton, together<br />
with the man who was his target, Mr. Peter Nixon.<br />
Richard Carlton:<br />
Before continuing with this story, can I re-confirm the<br />
news flash that James Dibble brought to you in the news bulletin<br />
a moment ago that the 12th ranking Minister in the Fraser<br />
Ministry, the Minister for Finance, the Member for MacPherson,<br />
the Gold Coast seat in Queensland, Mr. Eric Robinson has<br />
resigned from the Ministry. As I understand, Mr. Robinson<br />
submitted a three-page letter to Mr. Fraser this evening at<br />
8: 00 o'clock. What was in the letter, what the issue is, I<br />
have no idea. The Prime Minister's Office is refusing to make<br />
any comment whatsoever. Mr. Robinson, it may be known to some,<br />
was a very colleague of Mr. Fraser's, he possible still is<br />
but he was associated with the 1974 attempt by Mr. Fraser to<br />
wrest the leadership of the Liberal Party from Mr. Snedd~ n and<br />
he was associated also with the very successful 1975 attempt<br />
by Mr. Fraser to wrest the leadership from Mr. Snedden on that<br />
occasi. cn. I have no more information on that story. I can<br />
confirm the accuracy of it though, and if I may, Mr. Nixon,<br />
I did not ask you here on the pretext obviously, of asking you<br />
about Mr. Robinson's resignation, but can you add anything<br />
to what I said.<br />
Mr. Nixon:<br />
No I can't. It comes as a complete surprise to me. Mr. Robinson<br />
has been a very valued colleague both to myself and Mr. Fraser,<br />
of course, and I think only time will tell whether it's some<br />
personal reason or whatever that has caused him to resign.<br />
He has taken me by surprise.<br />
Richard Carlton:<br />
Mr. Morris,<br />
this is not related, I suggest to the pretext on which I invited<br />
you into the studio this evening either, but do you know anytLhing<br />
about Mr. Robinson's resignation?<br />
Mr. Morris:<br />
No, it's come as a total surprise to me also. / 2<br />
23 FEBRUARY 1979 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Richard Carlton:<br />
May we now revert to the pre-plan: VIP aircraft. Your speech<br />
in the Parliament today, as Clyde, suggested, throwing a little<br />
mud, sir, is there anything about the Government's use of<br />
VIP privileges anything, any improper use of those<br />
privileges that the Whitlam Government was not also guilty<br />
of in its term in office.<br />
Mr. Morris:<br />
Let's put the matter in context. It was Mr. Fraser who said<br />
in 1975 there would be no more international safaris. We didn't<br />
want a tourist for a Prime Minister. What I was pointing this<br />
afternoon, in spite of that statement, we've got a tourist<br />
for a Prime Minister, whether we like it or not, and a tourist<br />
that we can't afford. The thing that the Whitlam Government<br />
didn't do was it didn't embark on any $ 40 million programme<br />
that we are to re-equip the VIP flight. That's the essential<br />
difference and that was the point of this afternoon's debate.<br />
The Government's decision, in the initial stages, has been<br />
$ 14 1/ 2 billion in the purchase of two Boeing 707' s. It is<br />
a direct contradiction and rejection of what Mr. Fraser said<br />
in 1975.<br />
Mr. Nixon:<br />
As a simple answer to this of course, circumstances since 1975<br />
have changed markedly. We've had a report from Sir Robert Mark,<br />
who is the Head of Scotland Yard and that's one of the reports<br />
on security and the need for . Prime Ministers when travelling<br />
to travel in VIP planes to separate him from the travelling<br />
public. For two reasons: there is a tremendous trust involved<br />
in providing security when a Prime Minister or Head of State of<br />
any country, in a host country, travels with the normal travelling<br />
public in commercial planes.<br />
Richard Carlton:<br />
Doesn't that same thing apply to Mr. Whitlam though, in his<br />
days as Prime Minister.<br />
Mr. Nixon:<br />
Well the security question certainly was not raised and I don't<br />
think even Mr. Whitlam pretended that his use of a Boeing 707,<br />
which he ripped offQantas over a busy Christmas period, was on<br />
the basis of security.... . No I never suggested. that, but the<br />
reason -for the purchase of the 707s is certainly VIP use. But<br />
equally importantly, and perhaps more importantly, they are the<br />
last two planes that Qantas own the 707s aircraft the RAAF<br />
have been using those to charter their people and their traffic<br />
up to Butterworth. They will no longer be available after they<br />
are sold. They now have them in their fleet and they will be<br />
used importantly by the RAAF in the majority of hours used and<br />
importantly by the Prime Minister in the minority of hours used<br />
as VIP fleet.<br />
Mr . Morris:<br />
Mr. Nixon has a faulty memory. Mr. Whitlam, in response to<br />
Mr. Nixon's own questions on the chartering of the 707 made that<br />
-essential point that security was involved, but the point </p>
<p>-3<br />
Mr. Morris: ( continued)<br />
I want to stress is that the Government has no recommendation<br />
from it, from any responsible quarter that it should purchase<br />
Boeing 707s and a veritable flying hotel. There is no<br />
recommendation at all for Governments that they should buy<br />
707s. That's the essential point of the discussion.<br />
Richard Canlton:<br />
Do you think that the dispute here would really disappear<br />
if the Opposition was given equal access to the planes?<br />
Mr. Morris:<br />
Not at all.<br />
Richard Carlton:<br />
It is a matter of principle?<br />
Mr. Morris:<br />
It is a matter of priority. We see that we have a time now<br />
of record unemployment. We are in a period of enforced<br />
economic adversity. Yesterday, last evening in particular,<br />
we saw the Government reject a : proposal to restore six-montly<br />
cost of living adjust2ent to pensioners. We've seen a cut in<br />
defence service allocation only today the Prime Minister told<br />
the Par-liament of the increasing crisis to the north. What has<br />
been the Government's response?<br />
Mr. Nixon:<br />
Are you saying that Mr. Hayden won't use the VIPs?<br />
Mr. Morris:<br />
I can't speak for Mr. Hayden.<br />
Mr. Nixon:<br />
Well, what are you saying. Are you saying that..<br />
Mr. Morris:<br />
I'm not saying that we wouldn't purchase Boeing 707s...<br />
Mr. Nixon:<br />
You know you will have access to them, don't you? But irrespective<br />
of that, the fact is that there was a report by Sir Robert Mark,<br />
who is a former Head of Scotland Yard. There is a report by<br />
an IDC. There are requests by Heads of by other Governments<br />
that when the Prime Minister of Australia travels in their<br />
country that he doesn't it in VIP aircraft for security purposes.<br />
I think the reality is we are living in changed circumstances<br />
and we shouldn't ignore it. When you combine that factor with<br />
the use that the RAAF can make of these planes, it is just<br />
quite wrong to make the bald statement that he'd done this, and<br />
that he's not prepared to do something for pensioners. The fact<br />
it was taking the total decision, it was taking the total needs / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Mr. Nixon: ( continued)<br />
of RAAF requirements and they will get more use out of the<br />
plane than the VIP fleet will.<br />
Mr. Morris<br />
Isn't it rather incongruous that the day the Prime Minister<br />
announces to the Parliament the danger to the north, 20 of<br />
our new tanks are in moth-balls, 20 percent of the army's<br />
armoured vehicles withdrawn from service. The Navy steaming<br />
time is cut, ammunition issues have been cut, yet we can<br />
squander, and that's the only word to describe it, we can<br />
squander, $ 14 1/ 2 million to buy two VIPs two Boeing flying<br />
hotels. Now that's $ 14 1/ 2 million. If that was used for<br />
defence purposes, would produce a ten percent increase ( inaudible)<br />
Mr. Nixon:<br />
They will be used for ( inaudible) purposes quite heavily. And<br />
as time unfolds and as the planes are put into use, we will be<br />
able to see the hours they are used by the RAAF. It is one<br />
of their priorities to have them. 000---</p>
