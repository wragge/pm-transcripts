PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 150<br />
23 November 1973<br />
GRANTS TO ARTISTS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced grants<br />
to artists totalling $ 258,000. Among the 86 artists who will<br />
benefit are Mr. Guy Grey-Smith, Mr. Roger Kemp and<br />
Mr. Lyndon Dadswell, each of whom receives a grant of<br />
$ 10,000. In recommending the grants, the Chairman of<br />
the Visual Arts Board, of the Australian Council for the<br />
Arts, Mr. John Baily, said the three artists had made,<br />
during long careers, very significant contributions to the<br />
art of Australia.<br />
Mr. Baily also said that in many cases the grants<br />
were designed to allow artists to devote an intensive period<br />
to their creative work without the need to engage in other<br />
employment in order to live. He said that frequently an<br />
artist was able to give only a mere residue of time and<br />
energy to creative work.<br />
In some cases the grants were intended to make possible<br />
the purchase of equipment and materials for special projects,<br />
or allow artists to travel abroad to gain essential experience.<br />
A list of the grants is attached.<br />
