Mr. McEwen referred to the establishment in 1959 of the<br />
Australian Universities Commission to advise the Commonwealth<br />

balanced development of all Australian Universities., He said also<br />
that Commonwealth Parliament in its recent session had passed<br />
legislation to increase the number of part-time commissioners from<br />
four to sixe<br />

Since its establishment three years ago the Commission has<br />
been faced with an increasingly complex task. At the present time<br />
the Commission is beginning triennial visits to all Australian<br />
Universities preparing for the 1964/ 66 triennium. At the same<br />
time the Commission's Committee on tertiary education is examining<br />
the whole pattern of future development of higher education in<br />
Aus tralia, Among the more complex problems recently examined by the<br />
Commission was a conideration of the teaching costs of medical<br />
hospitals, Mr. McEwen said that the needs of teaching hospitals<br />
would be considered by the Commission each triennium. Further,<br />
the establishment of new Medical Schools at the University of New<br />
South Wales and at Monash University poses special problems for the<br />
Commission. Therefore the Commonwealth Government has decided to<br />
appoint Professor Sunderland, and so to make his specialised<br />
knowledge and experience available to the Commission.<br />
For its second new appointee the Government had decided to<br />
seek a person of eminence in the business and financial community.<br />
The original Commission had been chosen to provide not only a<br />
balance of academic and non-academic interests but as wide a<br />

capacity in th3 organisation of many community activities of a<br />
cultural nature and had likewise been chosen a member of the<br />
first Council of the National Library of AustraliaÃ¸<br />
Mr. Mc-wen said that the Government appreciated the<br />
co-operation of the part-time members of the Commission wno<br />
gladly gave up their time to help solve the onerous problem of<br />
higher education facing the nation, He expressed the<br />
Government's gratitude to Professor Sunderland and Mr. Myer for<br />
accepting the appointment.<br />
