PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT j9 NOVEMBER 1978-0<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ROBIN WILLIAMS,<br />
ABC SCIENCE UNIT, FOLLLOWING<br />
LAUNCHING OF " AUSTRALIAN ENDANGERED<br />
SPECIES"<br />
Question Your presence here ( inaudible) for the launching of<br />
a book on Australian Endangered Species obviously indicates<br />
that you think the subject is an extremely important one.<br />
Could you tell us why?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Yes, I do think it is an important one. Too often people<br />
have been careless of their natural heritage, their flora and<br />
fauna, and they've gone in, they've settled areas, bush has<br />
been knocked down, crops have been planted and grasses sown<br />
and there has been no real concern for the consequences. Now<br />
I believe that we'vegot to a stage where we understand and<br />
do need to assess the total land use of this nation. This<br />
is our responsibility to make sure that it's used to the<br />
best advantage taking into account economic matters-as well<br />
as matters of conservation.<br />
Question So you do think it's a political question?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, governments have to make decisions. Governments have<br />
to decide to set aside adequate parks. Governments need to<br />
have adequate conservation policies need a Wildlife Service<br />
and so there is a very real role in the governments. But<br />
Government would find it very dif ficult if there wasn'It a very<br />
widespread interest and concern amongst the general community.<br />
At the same time a great many knowledgable and dedicated<br />
amateurs can greatly assist in the preservation of Australian<br />
wildlife. Question You gave a list of some of the initiatives that the Federal<br />
Government has taken, will be taking. What really do you<br />
think is left that is in the future going to be taken to<br />
( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think probably to learn more about species. A great deal<br />
is known-of some. There are others that might be extinct,<br />
are believed to be extinct or haven't been seen for a very<br />
long while but maybe there'd be a lucky person who will be<br />
able to prove that a particular species still exists. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
The Australian continent is so large and some of the<br />
species possibly who inhabit such a small part<br />
of the continent; some are hard to see or find in any<br />
case and great distances need to be covered. That will<br />
be probably be a very long while before we know all there<br />
is to be known, if that ever occurs, about Australia's<br />
wildlife. So collecting documentation, the accumulation of<br />
knowledge because without knowledge you can't have the<br />
appropriate conservation rules and prcedures. Thnere might be a particula:<br />
aspect of the environment which is quite essential to the<br />
survival of a species. Unless you know what that aspect<br />
is, you can't make sure that the environment won't be<br />
damaged in a way and might further endanger the species.<br />
This isn't something the collection of knowledge isn't<br />
something that can be covered in six months or a year. This<br />
is a continuing scientific search and so far as I am concerned<br />
the more energy and initiative that can be put into it<br />
the better.<br />
Question The International Conference in Russia suggested that arid<br />
zones such as those Australia has ( inaudible), should go into<br />
farming of indigenous species and European ones.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that is a somewhat dubious suggestion. I believe<br />
that you need wilderness areas or areas set aside as national<br />
parks where indigenous species can and will be preserved<br />
and in many of these areas there is nothing much to farm.<br />
If people understand Australia and ( inaudible) of this<br />
nation; you can count one casuality it is the wildlife<br />
alone that survives in some areas. You get areas in the back<br />
parts of the country where you can run ( inaudible)<br />
what native species would want farmed, or want to farm and even<br />
if you adopted that practice you would have the real problem<br />
of when ( inaudible)<br />
What was farmed under farming conditions and what has been<br />
raided from national parks and wilderness areas and there<br />
have been many problems of a kind that I don't think I'd really<br />
want to see Australia get involved in. I don't think it's<br />
the best way to make sure we have adequate preservation of<br />
Australian wildlife. There is one thing that does concern me<br />
and it concerns, I know, wildlife authorities in the Northern<br />
Territory and that's the deprivations made by buffalo, feril cats<br />
and wild pig which, not being native to Australia, and the<br />
damage they can do to a natural environment thus damaging<br />
native Australian fauna and that I think is a serious question,<br />
especially since buffalo, pig and cats tend to ( inaudible)<br />
up pretty rapidly. They can do enormous damage. That poses<br />
a real problem which I don't think I think we understand it,<br />
I don't know that we know how to control it though.<br />
Question: Finally, what do you think of the book, " Australian Endangered<br />
Species". ./ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it's a very good book. I think it's been extremely<br />
well-produced. I would like to compliment the publishers.<br />
Obviously an enormous amount of hard work and care and<br />
effort has been put into it. As far as I am concerned the<br />
book is entertaining but it is also educational and if it<br />
would help to inspire more Australians to a real concern<br />
for Australian fauna then I would believe Professor<br />
Ovington would happy. I think he has every right to be proud<br />
of the book. 000---</p>
