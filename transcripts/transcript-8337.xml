CHECK AGAINST DELI! B EMAROED UNTIL DEIr-VERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS CLUE<br />
SYDNEY 23 SEPTEMBER 1991<br />
Last year I addressed this club in December. It was a few days<br />
after the United Nations Security Council had authorised<br />
military action to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. We all<br />
hoped then that force would not be necessary. But we accepted<br />
that if Iraq would not comply voluntarily with the UN's<br />
demands, then Australia, along with many other nations, would<br />
commit forces: to combat in support of the United Nations.<br />
I explained to you here last year our reasons for taking that<br />
momentous decision. I spoke about the importance of the Kuwait<br />
crisis for the shape of the world order in the post Cold War<br />
era. Well, Saddam Hussein did not draw back; the international<br />
coalition did go to war on behalf of the United Nations; and of<br />
course they wrere very swiftly successful. We will probably<br />
never know the true scale of Iraq's casualties; the coalition's<br />
were mercifully few. But for all who suffered we grieve. Even<br />
short wars impose a terrible cost.<br />
So I think it: is proper that I return this year to the<br />
propositions I was putting to you last year, to see how the<br />
world has gone since the Gulf War; to see whether it is indeed<br />
a better place; and to see what more needs to be done.<br />
Looking back over the past nine months, one would have to say<br />
that there are many solid grounds for satisfaction about the<br />
way the international community is developing.<br />
First, of course, there was our swift success in the Gulf<br />
itself. Since the First World War, the international<br />
community has been trying to build the institutions and<br />
summon the will to resist military aggression. This year,<br />
for the first time, we made it work, and that has made us<br />
all safer.<br />
In the aftermath of the Gulf War, the international<br />
communit~ y organised an unprecedentedly swift and effective<br />
response to the plight of Kurdish refugees in and around<br />
northern Iraq. Australian soldiers joined an enormous<br />
internat~ ional humanitarian effort which transcended<br />
internat~ ional boundaries, and the United Nations showed<br />
unprecedented initiative and resourcefulness in protecting<br />
Iraq's Kurds from their own government. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Middle East, the end of the Gulf War has<br />
indeed, as we hoped and believed it would, brought a new<br />
urge for peace between Israel and her Arab neighbours, and<br />
new hope to the Palestinians. The Gulf War showed the<br />
people of the Middle East that they have interests in<br />
common, and taught them that they can cooperate to serve<br />
those interests. The present moves towards a peace<br />
conference are only a beginning. But they are the best<br />
beginning we have seen in decades, and we urge all sides<br />
to let the conference happen, and to make it work.<br />
In South Africa, while violence and prevarication have<br />
impeded the establishment of an interim government and the<br />
commencement of constitutional negotiations, the promises<br />
of President de Kierk's historic speech of 1 February 1991<br />
have been largely fulfilled. The legislative pillars of<br />
apartheid have been dismantled, political prisoners have<br />
been freed, and exiles can return. Our impatience for the<br />
establishment of the new South Africa should not blind us<br />
to the enormous progress that has been made. I will<br />
return to this issue later.<br />
The Australian-French initiative to prevent mining in<br />
Antarctica and preserve the wilderness continent has been<br />
crowned by the agreement this year to an absolute ban for<br />
fifty years, with strong provisions for its indefinite<br />
extension. This is one of the most far-reaching<br />
international environmental agreements so far. And next<br />
year the UN Conference on Environment and Development will<br />
aim to extend international action on the environment<br />
still further.<br />
Cambodia's factions have at last agreed on a settlement<br />
process which will lead to free and fair elections for a<br />
national government under UN sponsorship. For Australia<br />
this is specially gratifying. The Cambodian problem has<br />
threatened the stability of our own region, and Australia,<br />
through Gareth Evans, has contributed much to the UN plan.<br />
Also in our own region, many of the more durable relics of<br />
the Cold War are breaking up. North and South Korea have<br />
been admitted to the United Nations, holding out hope for<br />
a peaceful future for the Peninsula. And China and Taiwan<br />
have agreed to participate together in APEC.<br />
Almost unnoticed, the conclusion of the START treaty<br />
between the Soviet Union and the United States committing<br />
them to cut their nuclear arsenals for the first time,<br />
marked a stage in the end of the Cold War as decisive as<br />
the collapse of the Berlin Wall. </p>
<p>And lastly, of course, there is the Russian Revolution.<br />
There is no irony in that phrase. It is now obvious that<br />
the events of the past month take the people of the Soviet<br />
Union back again to the point at which, in 1917, they took<br />
the path of communism, and offer them again the choice of<br />
freedom. Having by their own actions overthrown the<br />
largest, most powerful and most intrusive state apparatus<br />
the world has ever seen, there can be no doubt what their<br />
choice will be. Already, to our great delight, the Baltic<br />
States have been restored to independence.<br />
All that adds up to a lot of good news. I do not of course<br />
claim that all of these happy developments are the result of<br />
the Gulf War. But I do claim that all of these developments,<br />
in so many different areas, show that we were right to believe<br />
that the end of the Cold War offered not just an end to rivalry<br />
and terror, but a beginning of cooperation and hope; that there<br />
is indeed a ne~ w world order; inchoate, amorphous, but real.<br />
We can see that reality in all of these developments. We see<br />
people and nations moved by the same group of instincts and<br />
aspirations; peace and freedom from aggression, democratic<br />
institutions of representative government, the rule of law,<br />
respect for human rights, the economic opportunities of a free<br />
market, and respect for the environment.<br />
And in every case we see a new willingness indeed a new<br />
determination to cooperate internationally to fulfil these<br />
aspirations. Your profession places a premium on scepticism, and there have<br />
been plenty of sceptics about the new world order. But<br />
journalists, find foreign correspondents in particular, have<br />
their own quit~ e central place in this new world order. Because<br />
one of its features is a growing acceptance of the role of the<br />
international free press.<br />
Journalists un~ der air attack in Tel Aviv and Riyadh and<br />
Baghdad; amoncr the Kurds in the squalid mountains of the<br />
Turkey-Iraq border; and with the people of Moscow around the<br />
Russian Parliament in August, have done their vital part to<br />
build the determination to cooperate which has made the new<br />
world order work. So don't knock it you're a big part of it.<br />
And journalists are part of it again right now in Yugoslavia.<br />
The Yugoslav crisis is important, not just because the lives<br />
and welfare of' millions of people are at stake, many of whom<br />
have close links to Australia; nor is the crisis important only<br />
because it threatens the peace and stability of an important<br />
portion of Europe.<br />
It is also important because, like the Gulf Crisis last year,<br />
the way the world responds to the tragedy in Yugoslavia will<br />
help to define in important ways the sort of world we are to<br />
live in. Like the Gulf, it too is a test of our new world<br />
order. </p>
<p>And that is why Yugoslavia matters. Through our Yugoslavian<br />
communities, Australia has a direct and vivid stake in the<br />
crisis through the most fundamental human connections of family<br />
and friends. But beyond even that link, Yugoslavia matters to<br />
Australia and other nations all over the world, because it<br />
matters to all of us that we live in a world in which the<br />
international community will not stand idly by and watch<br />
thousands die and millions suffer.<br />
The world has a right to expect that we can find a means to end<br />
such senseless violence. It certainly has a right to demand<br />
that we try everything that might work. That is why I have<br />
from the outset rejected the reasoning of those who argue that<br />
the United Nations should not even try to address this problem,<br />
and who can give no better reason than that such a thing has<br />
never been done before.<br />
In 1991 it should be unthinkable that the United Nations could<br />
stand back from a crisis that threatens the lives of millions,<br />
and the peace of Europe, on a point of precedent.<br />
And we should all be deeply disappointed if we find the limits<br />
of the new world order drawn in the fields and towns of<br />
Yugoslavia. I have higher hopes.<br />
That is why I have written to the Secretary-General of the<br />
United Nations to urge that the issue should, as a necessary<br />
first step, be brought before the Security Council urgently. I<br />
am glad to see that my call has been widely supported, and a<br />
meeting is now expected later this week.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Australia's interests are engaged in Yugoslavia, as they are<br />
engaged throughout the world in the emergence of the new values<br />
I have spoken about.<br />
Australia's security has been enhanced as nuclear<br />
confrontation has waned, and as the United Nations has<br />
shown that it can respond decisively to aggression.<br />
Our economic interests are enhanced as market forces<br />
encourage growth in economies long held stagnant behind a<br />
wall of centralised bureaucratic command.<br />
Our environment is enhanced as more governments are forced<br />
by their own people to take greater account of<br />
environmental values.<br />
And less tangibly but perhaps most importantly, our humanity is<br />
amplified as more and more people around the world start to<br />
realise the universal aspirations to dignity, security and<br />
prosperity through the institutions of democratic government<br />
and market economics.<br />
For every culture and society around the world there will be a<br />
unique way of translating that society's aspirations into<br />
effective political and economic institutions. </p>
<p>We in Australia understand that fundamental human aspirations<br />
may be realised in different ways, reflecting different<br />
cultural and political traditions. Within internationallyaccepted<br />
standards of human rights, different societies place<br />
different values on discipline and on freedom; on cohesion and<br />
on individuality; on respect for elders and on self-expression.<br />
We should not be disturbed by these differences; they exist<br />
between neighbours everywhere.<br />
It is an essential element of Australia's cultural tradition<br />
that we respect and tolerate values and perspectives that are<br />
different from our own. We feel no embarrassment about<br />
discussing such differences, because we accept that people of<br />
good will may differ on significant issues without respecting<br />
one another any the less.<br />
But I am sure that this is not a uniquely Australian or Western<br />
characteristic. I have found that some of our neighbours are<br />
perfectly happy to discuss these cultural differences. I am<br />
sure that they do not intend that Australia should conform to<br />
their traditions, just as I know that we do not expect them to<br />
conform to ours.<br />
But I know that they do expect that we should make an effort to<br />
understand their traditions and institutions before we comment<br />
on them, and wre expect the same of them. I would have to say<br />
that these expectations have not always been met from either<br />
side. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Each country bias to work out its own way to meet the needs and<br />
hopes of its people. But there is great scope for<br />
international cooperation to support individual countries'<br />
efforts to achieve a better future for their own people, and to<br />
the benefit of' us all.<br />
Few international bodies are better equipped than the<br />
Commonwealth to foster such cooperation. The Commonwealth<br />
brings together both developed and developing countries. It<br />
draws on the strengths of its politically and culturally<br />
diverse member-ship to address the important issues involved in<br />
the development of what we might call ' good government' in an<br />
informal and consensual way. By ' good government', I mean the<br />
institutions and practices which turn aspirations to democracy<br />
and prosperity into practical reality.<br />
At the Commonwealth leaders' meeting in Harare next month we<br />
will be looking at the role of the Commonwealth into the next<br />
century. Work carried out since the last meeting in Kuala<br />
Lumpur has suggested that good government is one area in which<br />
the Commonwealth can and should take a larger role.<br />
Clearly this is a role for the Commonwealth which accords<br />
precisely with broader international developments. </p>
<p>I look forward to discussions on this with other Commonwealth<br />
leaders in Harare. We will be looking at ways to build on our<br />
shared traditions and institutions to enhance democratic<br />
processes and sound economic practices within Commonwealth<br />
member countries.<br />
In many respects the Commonwealth is already leading the way in<br />
providing practical assistance to help member countries develop<br />
good government. The Commonwealth Secretariat is running<br />
training programs on electoral procedures for member countries,<br />
and it is providing electoral observer missions in Bangladesh,<br />
Guyana, and Zambia.<br />
Within the Commonwealth membership itself, there has been a<br />
heartening shift towards the principles and practices of good<br />
government. Multi-party democracy is becoming more widely<br />
entrenched, and economic policies are becoming more marketoriented.<br />
In Africa, for example, Ghana is making steady economic<br />
progress under a freer market. Nigeria's transitional<br />
administration is moving towards multi-party democracy.<br />
Zambia's first multi-party elections since independence will<br />
take place in October, and the Commonwealth will assist in the<br />
achievement of this national milestone.<br />
Namibia, only recently independent, is already showing all the<br />
signs of a robust democracy and a growing economy. I am proud<br />
of Australia's role in assisting that process, and encouraged<br />
by the early indications that a stable and functioning<br />
democracy has taken a permanent hold in Namibia.<br />
One area where we in Australia and the Commonwealth at large<br />
feel a special obligation to help is in the development of just<br />
political and economic institutions in South Africa.<br />
South Africa is now approaching a crucial stage of transition<br />
from the shameful era of apartheid to what we hope will be a<br />
full non-racial democracy.<br />
That South Africa has reached this point, after so many hard<br />
years of oppression for the majority of its people, is a<br />
testament to the vision and courage of Nelson Mandela and other<br />
black leaders, and the foresight of President de Klerk, and to<br />
the people of South Africa themselves.<br />
But South Africa's substantial progress towards a free nonracial<br />
democratic future is also due in no small measure to the<br />
determination and cooperation of the international community in<br />
adopting and maintaining sanctions against the apartheid<br />
regime. The Commonwealth has played a leading role in developing and<br />
implementing international sanctions. I take pride in<br />
Australia's role in this; we have been consistently at the<br />
forefront of those who have sought to apply international<br />
pressure to South Africa to bring it to its senses. And we<br />
remain at the forefront now in formulating appropriate<br />
international responses to the process of reform in South<br />
Af rica. </p>
<p>7.<br />
The barriers in South Africa have not and will not come down<br />
overnight. Dismantling apartheid will be a long and difficult<br />
process. The continuing bloodshed on the streets is a tragic<br />
testimony to the culture of violence built up over many years<br />
of distrust and suspicion.<br />
The recent peace accord is a heartening sign but it will be<br />
some time before real peace can be guaranteed. International<br />
pressure will. still be required to ensure that the reforms<br />
underway in South Africa are brought to fruition and the<br />
aspirations of its people fully realised.<br />
This was recognised by the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign<br />
Ministers on South Africa at their recent meeting in New Delhi.<br />
The Committee has recommended, to Heads of Government in Harare<br />
that the reforms implemented to date be acknowledged by the<br />
immediate lifting of so-called people-to-people sanctions<br />
including visas, airlinks, and cultural contacts. Trade,<br />
economic and financial sanctions will be maintained until<br />
further specified progress has been made. We hope that will<br />
not take long.<br />
And we must remember that in South Africa, as in so many other<br />
countries, the political revolution is only the start.<br />
Establishing a resilient, steadily-growing economy which can<br />
fulfil the aspirations of all South Africa's people will be an<br />
enormous challenge. South Africa's leaders must be careful not<br />
to raise unreal expectations in their followers. The struggle<br />
for economic prosperity will be no easier than the struggle for<br />
political freedom.<br />
The urgent need to rebuild South Africa's economy after the<br />
ravages of apartheid means that sanctions should not be applied<br />
any longer than is necessary to secure essential political<br />
reforms. And we must start now to foster economic as well as<br />
political reform.-<br />
My Government has already established training and economic<br />
planning assistance programs for South Africa. The<br />
Commonwealth is also playing a leading role. A Commonwealth<br />
working group has studied the needs of a post-apartheid<br />
democratic South Africa and in Harare we will be looking at<br />
ways in which Commonwealth members can assist in meeting those<br />
needs. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, South Africa's economic<br />
regeneration will require the same condition that makes other<br />
economies flourish; a free international trading system. That<br />
system is now under a grave threat.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Amidst all the heartening developments over the past year, irk<br />
one area the world has moved backwards. Against the trend, the<br />
world trade negotiations in the Uruguay Round have scarcely<br />
moved since last year when the Brussels ministerial meeting<br />
which was meant to conclude the Round fizzled out. </p>
<p>S.. 8.<br />
You will all know where we stand on the principle issues of the<br />
Round. We have sought to bring agricultural trade under the<br />
GATT for the first time, so as to reform the gross distortion<br />
in this sector of world trade which hurts us so badly. We have<br />
succeeded, through the Cairns Group, in bringing agriculture to<br />
centre stage. To secure a result we have been prepared to make<br />
major concessions both in agriculture and in other areas.<br />
You will know that we hold the Europeans principally<br />
responsible for the impasse. But I do not want here to recite<br />
our grievances. I want to make a more general point. I have<br />
said that the events of the past year have confirmed that there<br />
is a new world order, and that it is based on principles of<br />
cooperation and liberality. We have seen what can now be<br />
achieved through international cooperation which even five<br />
years ago would have been undreamt of. And we understand that<br />
all of our nations live by trade; it is the foundation of our<br />
prosperity. So how can it be that in 1991, the nations of the world cannot<br />
agree to reform the GATT to everyone's advantage? With so much<br />
at stake, why can't we get a result? Because I very much fear<br />
that without the GATT, the achievements of the new world order<br />
will be put at risk. That is why it is so imperative that<br />
other vital issues like Yugoslavia important as they are do<br />
not prevent world leaders from becoming deeply and personally<br />
engaged in the complex issues of the Uruguay round. There is<br />
no more important issue. Quite simply, the future of the<br />
international community depends on it. </p>
