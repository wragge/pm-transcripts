PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 167<br />
31 December 1973<br />
NEW YEAR MESSAGE<br />
I wish all Australians a happy and prosperous year<br />
in 1974. The year just ending began o-n a note of great hope for<br />
Australia and her region with the signing of a ceasef ire in<br />
Vietnam and a withdrawal of Australian and American forces from<br />
Indo-China. Relations between the major powers have continued<br />
to improve, despite some outbreaks which were temporarily beyond<br />
their control. The New Year, however, brings with it risks and<br />
challenges of a different kind and on a different scale. The<br />
industrial nations of the West our friends in the United States,<br />
Europe, Britain and Japan face an energy crisis that has already<br />
significantly affected their economic prospects and traditional<br />
standards and habits of living. The energy shortage will be the<br />
paramount concern, the over-riding reality, for the world's<br />
statesmen in the year ahead.<br />
Australia is immensely fortunate that she has been able<br />
to-avoid internally at least the worst effects of the energy<br />
shortage. It would be foolish to pretend however that we can isolate<br />
ourselve ' s completely or indefinately from its effects. There are<br />
bound to be problems of readjustment for us.<br />
The Australian people now have a Government committed<br />
firmly to maximum Australian ownership and control of olir preuious<br />
resources of minerals and energy. We will never allow these<br />
resources to pass further into overseas hands. We are committed,<br />
through our plans for a Petroleum and Minerals Authority, to<br />
undertake a massive search for new resources which the Australian<br />
people will control. Once we are assured of our own energy<br />
req-airements we will be a generous and dependable supplier to our<br />
customers overseas. I am confident that 1974 will bring even greater progress<br />
and prosperity to Australians.<br />
Our important plans for education, health and the cities<br />
will go forward. We will give special priority to tie care of the<br />
very young and the old those who have not yet entered school and<br />
those who have ceased to work. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Our efforts for a more just society at home, for<br />
greater equality of opportunity for all Australians, will<br />
equip us better for the task of working to redress the massive<br />
inequalities and injustices in the world at large not least<br />
in our own region.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
