AUSTRA4IA'T BROADCASTING COMMISSION<br />
FOUR CORNERS<br />
The Prime Minister interviewed by John Penlington<br />
EMBARGOED UNhTIL 9.30 P. M. SATURDAY 6TH APRIL_ 1968<br />
Recorded 5/ L1/ 68<br />
Penlington Prime Minister, you told your Press Conference<br />
last Monday that this de-escalation was the greatest concession<br />
' that the Americans had made. Now, did they make this great<br />
concession without asking Australia whether we agreed they should<br />
or not?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, they informed us on Sunday morning that<br />
the President was proposing to make a statement and in that<br />
statement he would include the decision on removing the threat of<br />
bombing, removing bombing, from all the northern part of North<br />
Vietnam where 90 per cent of their population lives. This was<br />
conveyed to Mr. Hasluck, in fact, because I was in New Zealand,<br />
or just returning, but as soon as I got back it was also shown<br />
to me. I suppose it would have been possible for us to raise<br />
objections b'~ t we wouldn't have of' course done it.<br />
Penlingto: Would it be fair to say though as it happened<br />
we were informed and not consulted about this drastic change in<br />
American policy?<br />
Prime Mini~ tlD: I think that would be a reasonably fair way of<br />
putting it. We were informed, we were informed in advance. We<br />
could have raised objections. We were asked for our reactions<br />
to the proposals but there was no week-long discussion beforehand.<br />
Penlingto Well, had we thought that this was an unwise<br />
concession to make at the time, do you think our decision would<br />
have had any effect on the final result? </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister: Well, that's such a speculative question that<br />
I couldn't answer it but we would have had time to make our objections<br />
known had we had any objections.<br />
Penlington: Can we assume then that as America has acted<br />
unilaterally that the actual conduct of the war is completely out<br />
of our own hands?<br />
Prime Minister: The military conduct of the war in the sense of<br />
military operations and moving troops around and that kind of thing<br />
has, of course, not really been in our own hands except for the<br />
control of our own troops up there which has been and will remain<br />
in our own hands. I am not quite sure just exactly what<br />
perhaps you could rephrase the question a little...<br />
Penlington: Can we make any suggestion about the conduct of<br />
the war and have a reasonable feeling that some action will be<br />
taken as a result of them?<br />
Prime Minister: I think we could make suggestions to the Americans<br />
as to the conduct of the war and I am sure they would be taken into<br />
consideration but that I think is all one can expect. One can't<br />
expect, yes we will make suggestions and they'll automatically be<br />
accepted. ienlington: Well, Prime Minister, with peace now hopefully<br />
on the horizon, would it be possible for America to accept peace<br />
terms which would not be peace terms we would like to have? Could<br />
this happen?<br />
Prime Minister: Could America accept peace terms which we would<br />
think were peace terms which didn't give a true, just, lasting peace<br />
to the people of South Vietnam? Well,. here again, you're asking<br />
such a completely speculative question that I don't think I could<br />
give you a meaningful answer to that. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Penlington: Will Australia be seeking a seat at any conference<br />
which decides on peace terms?<br />
Prime 11inister: Well, our thinking at the moment, this is the<br />
thinking of Mr. H-asluck and of myself, is that we should be in the<br />
days or weeks or however long it is ahead that these matters are<br />
unaer discussion, that rather than sitting round with all the<br />
nations which are engaged in the Vietnam conflict with Thailand<br />
and the Philippines and South Vietnam and Korea and New Zealand<br />
all constantly sitting round a table, that rather our interests<br />
would be served and it would be simpler to have bi-lateral information,<br />
exchange of information, with United States principally but<br />
not leaving out the other matters but rather just bi-lateral talks.<br />
Penliigton: Would you agree though that this would appear as<br />
though we were letting peace be decided without our own opinions<br />
being made thoroughly known?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, I don't think there has been any suggestion<br />
f-er peace conferences, has there? I think the only suggestion has<br />
been that the North Vietnamese will appoint a representative to talk<br />
0 with a representative of the United States. Now this is the only<br />
proposal that I have heard of.<br />
Penlington: Sir, where would we stand now, where would<br />
Australia stand at the moment on the question of allowing the<br />
N. L. F. some participation in the future government of South Vietnam?<br />
Prime Minister: I wouldn't think of commenting on any sort of<br />
possible peace terms or any possible proposals unless they were sort<br />
of concrete and therefore could be commented on.<br />
Penl ington: Prime Minister, you said in Hobart less than two<br />
weeks ago and I'm using your words: " If there were great changes in<br />
the United States' involvement in Vietnam I think the Australian </p>
<p>people would be forced to accept those changes." Nowi, does this<br />
mean that Australia simply has to go along with whatever happens<br />
to be American foreign policy at the time?<br />
Prime Minister: No, it doesn't mean anything of the kind. The<br />
basis of that question was, it may not have been spelt out as<br />
completely as I am spelling it out now but the whole basis and<br />
implication was unmistakable, was that if there were a change in<br />
the leadership and the administration of the United States and<br />
if as a result of that change in leadership and administration<br />
the United States in effect withdrew from South Vietnam, what<br />
would Australia's position be? And the answer, I think, is the<br />
answer I gave and quite self evident: " We can't stay there alone".<br />
Penlington: But when you use the words " the Australian<br />
people would be forced to accept those changes in Amrias<br />
policy", are you areally saying that we can't be independent?<br />
Prime Minister: I am really saying that if a situation arose<br />
where other troops were withdrawn from South Vietnam that we are<br />
not the sort of country that can leave our troops there going on<br />
fighting without the United States or without the United<br />
States, and I think that's pretty self evident.<br />
Penlington: Well, if the United States, without a satisfactory<br />
peaceful solution in South Vietnam, began to reduce its<br />
troop commitment to Vietnam, would we be likely to do the same?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, I'd again want to see whatever propositions<br />
were concrcte Dropositions before I could comment on that.<br />
PEenlington: Do you think the fact that you made various<br />
statements earlier this year that our present commitment to<br />
Vietnam is virtually at its limit? Do you think that could have<br />
had any effect on whether or not President Johnson consulted you<br />
about his decision not to stand again? </p>
<p>Prime Minister: I am quite certain it couldn't have had any<br />
effect at all. The Americans have 525,000 men in Vietnam, the<br />
South Vietnamese army is around 800,000; there are lots of<br />
others. Another 1,000 or 1500 or whatever it might be from<br />
Australia would have no effect whatever, well, I won't say have no<br />
effect whatever, a minimal effect on the overall military<br />
effectiveness there.<br />
Penlington: Prime Minister, can we look now at the long<br />
term significance of President Johnson's decision not to seek<br />
another term in office. Do you accept his statement that this<br />
statement is irrevocable?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, yes, I do. It's been stated firmly,<br />
it's been stated definitely. There doesn't seem to me to be any<br />
after-thought about it. I think one must accept it. I suppose<br />
it is always possible at any time for anyone to change their mind<br />
but it doesn't seem to me to be likely.<br />
Penlington: If the next President of the United States has<br />
an attitude towards American involvement in Asia which is very<br />
different to President Johnson's, how ready are we to adjust to<br />
that drastic change?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, how ready are we to adjust to a change?<br />
Are you asking again could we take on a burden of defence in Asia<br />
if there was no United States?<br />
Penlington: No, what I am really asking is, is the Government<br />
already working out what it would do if a very different<br />
President from President Johnson took a different policy towards<br />
South Vietnam?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, we would merely have to do all we could<br />
to see that the United States remained interested in this part of </p>
<p>6<br />
the world, with the presence in this part of the world, because the<br />
more that presence continues the safer Australia is.<br />
Penlington: Well, how serious do you think is the present<br />
need to persuade Americans to stay in South East Asia?<br />
Prime Minister: And, again, you're talking of to stay in Vietnam?<br />
Penliggton: Yes, Vietnam and South East Asia.<br />
Prime Minister: Have a continuing interest in the area of<br />
South East Asia. Well, I believe that they can contribute considerably<br />
to the stability in South East Asia, particularly in<br />
countries not engaged, I mean South Vietnam is war, but to<br />
contribute stability in the way which the United Kingdom has, for<br />
example, contributed to stability, though it didn't prevent<br />
outbreaks of minor hostilities, contribute to stability in<br />
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaya. But therefore if they do contribute<br />
then they would hb1p, I would think, to the building up of<br />
the living standards and the economies of these countries which in<br />
the long run contributes much more to the stability. So I hope<br />
that they would continue that interest and, indeed, we obviously<br />
rely very heavily ourselves on the ANZUS Treaty as far as Australia<br />
is concerned.<br />
Penlington: Do you think Americans are going to need more<br />
persuasion though to stay there? Do you think they are beginning<br />
to wonder whether they should stay there?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't think Itd have enough information to<br />
answer that question, or I doubt if anyone would without just<br />
making an assessment, a speculative reply.<br />
Penlington: Prime Minister, if America's foreign policy moves<br />
further towards isolationalism, should Australia's foreign policy<br />
towards Asia do the same? </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Prime Minister: I don't think we should move towards isolationalism.<br />
We have many contacts with Asian countries, many ways of<br />
assisting them, and we are so close to them. We have.. I don't<br />
mention just the Colombo Plan but I mean we have a technical capacity<br />
which can help build their industries very much; we have an agricultural<br />
know-how which has been effective up there; we have the<br />
capacity to teach, a capacity to help; and also to a limited extent<br />
a capacity to provide some Und o'f military training or military<br />
assistance or whatever it might be; so I wouldn't I would hope<br />
we wouldn't well, we would not move towards isolationalism.<br />
Penlington: As a result of the events of this week, do you<br />
think the leaders of South East Asia have any greater reason to<br />
feel less secure?<br />
Prime Minister: Not as a result of the events of this week. I<br />
think some of them would feel perhaps less secure should the<br />
Communists win a military victory in South Vietnam because they<br />
have always felt the Domino Theory, which is disparaged by some<br />
quarters in Australia, was a valid theory.<br />
Penlirigton: Prime Minister, finally, this has been the most dramicnk<br />
of yoar tcrn of effice so far.* How would you sum up how you<br />
feel as you approach the end of it?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, there has been an awful lot happening.<br />
Yes, it's been a highly dramatic week, but there have been others.<br />
After all, like Britain sort of accelerated its withdrawal from<br />
Malaya and Singapore which again was a pretty dramatic move. Not<br />
only accelerated its withdrawal but rethought the forces it would<br />
have available to come here, and this too was pretty dramatic.<br />
How do I feel as I approach the end of it? Well, its been a heavy<br />
and dramatic week.<br />
Penlington: Prime Minister, thank you very much for giving<br />
us some of your time this week. EN D. </p>
