PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT A RECEPTION HOSTED BY THE HON WARREN<br />
SNOWDON MP, HOTEL DARWIN, DARWIN, 5 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well thanks very much indeed for that very warm round of applause.<br />
I am delighted to be here with Brian [ Ede] and Bob [ Collins] and<br />
Warren ( Snowdon] and Laurie [ Brereton] and our very distinguished<br />
Parliamentary representatives and candidates here in the Northern Territory.<br />
It is true, I think, that Bob and Warren have been a great team and yes they<br />
have wrenched the money off me every time they have come through the<br />
door. I used to say every time when you see that fat guy and the skinny<br />
walking in, it is going to cost me money and they would saunter in all very<br />
casual, but all very effective.<br />
But the thing is it is a great thing for the Labor Party and Bob says we are<br />
years old here. This is the oldest Labor Party in the world and we keep on<br />
renewing ourselves and the thing that always keeps us going is faith in<br />
Australia, faith in our fellow Australians and faith in the country.<br />
Above all else, we have the policy disputes, but they are the things that keep<br />
it rolling along and we keep producing these people that always push the<br />
envelope out, that always enlarge it and make it bigger. And we have got a<br />
double here in the Northern Territory with Bob and Warren and I sometimes,<br />
you know, because you tend to, in Cabinet meetings, study people in sitting<br />
there opposite you because everyone is a psychiatrist in politics, you look<br />
into your little foibles and manners and characteristics, strengths,<br />
weaknesses and you know you get very proud of a group of people like this.<br />
And I was looking at Bob only a week or so ago, I am not saying that..<br />
I mean it is hard not to miss him by the way. I am not saying this because<br />
I am here, but I thought well there he is, he has sauntered in and you know<br />
he is in an open neck shirt and I thought well look at the change he has<br />
brought to Australian agriculture.<br />
The previous week I was in Queensland at the. Graingrowers Conference and<br />
there was great warmnth toward&amp; s the Labor Party from an area which has </p>
<p>2<br />
been traditionally a non-Labor voting and supporting group and it is because<br />
with the drought, and the severity of it, this Government has kept income<br />
support under that whole community. Now 10,000 farm families get income<br />
support from the Commonwealth to tide them through this drought. There is<br />
also funding under the Rural Adjustment Scheme and these are the sort of<br />
props we put in to keep agriculture in place while the drought was on and<br />
Bob has done an absolutely original and first rate job in putting all of those<br />
things into place.<br />
And you think well remember him in the Assembly, he goes to the Federal<br />
Parliament as a Senator you take your chance in the lucky dip of the Federal<br />
Caucus. He bobs up in a ministry, in a number of ministries where he has<br />
done important jobs in transport, in communications and in agriculture and<br />
we keep on producing people that do these things, that do good things for<br />
Australia, understand the ethos, really love the country and want to advance<br />
it. You know the others just don't breed them like we do. They just don't.<br />
So he is almost tailor-made for the job of Minister for Agriculture. Bob is out<br />
there, sort of you know, chews the fat with all these farmers and he<br />
understands, of course, well. And the same I can say about Warren. I mean<br />
Warren is a terrific Member of Parliament, a great constituency member.<br />
He genuinely represents the place, understands all the balances, pushes the<br />
envelope when he can, knows when not to, tries to get the best right and<br />
I think this is most obviously true during the Mabo discussion, the Native Title<br />
Legislation, which was a year long, tooing and froing over little details of a<br />
complex piece of property and cultural law, which we had to build from the<br />
ground up.<br />
And this sort of value for the Labor Party.. you know it is not a huge<br />
financially strong organisation, it's a collection of ordinary Australians who<br />
have come together for the public good of it because of their commitment to<br />
the country and we have produced Members of Parliament and Senators and<br />
they go on to the Government and they make a tremendous contribution.<br />
Whatever people might think organisationally about the Labor Party in the<br />
Northern Territory, or in any of the other States, here you have produced two<br />
cracker representatives who really are doing you proud let me assure you.<br />
I am delighted to know them and to be in a Party with them and to be<br />
colleagues of them and Laurie, of course, followed Bob in the transport<br />
portfolio. And they have extended you know we were down today opening<br />
the international terminal at Brisbane airport which we did in 1992, I think.<br />
You turned the sod? He is a good sod turner. Turning over sod is an<br />
accomplished art, I can tell you, and of course Laurie is here today as the<br />
Minister presiding over the opening. So you know, again, it is just another<br />
milestone in the great aviation story of Australia of course which the north<br />
has played such a role in of course as we know Queensland with Qantas in<br />
particular. So these are the things that make you proud to be in the game and, you<br />
know, standing. here with a fellow like Brian who is a good leader, with good<br />
values, you are~ proud to belong to the same Party as these people. I am<br />
very proud indeed. </p>
<p>When I came across today we took off from a very nice ceremony in<br />
Brisbane, where again you see one of the principal gateways of the east<br />
coast of Australia to Asia, you think of the way in which the country has<br />
changed. And we flew over across the north, across Cape York, up through<br />
the Gulf, some of the most beautiful landscape you could imagine on the way<br />
down into Darwin. You think how big it is and how beautiful it is and to think<br />
that it was held in trust for the rest of us by the Aboriginal community all those<br />
thousands of years and that is why we owe it to them and to ourselves to<br />
make a decent fist of it.<br />
To know what a great thing we have been, a great bequest it is that this<br />
ancient continent has been left to us to enjoy, to live from and to protect,<br />
to protect this place and to understand that you almost have to live half your<br />
life, if your a non-Aboriginal Australian, to understand a little bit about it and<br />
to appreciate it more and there is something about the ancient quality of it.<br />
It gets to you as you get into your middle years, I think.<br />
I don't think I understood it as well when I was young. But I understand it<br />
better now and you feel the ancientness, if I could use the expression, of it<br />
and you know what an absolutely enormously rich bequest it has been<br />
because there is no continent reserved for any other group our size and here<br />
we are with these old societies like Indonesia, near us, and the great<br />
emerging country of China, an emerging economy of a billion people and<br />
these old proud societies like Japan and Korea in the region.<br />
We are now part of that region. We are part of that family of nations.<br />
We turned over the leaf from 20 years ago, when we were selecting people to<br />
come here on the basis of race. It is not that long ago and we have done a<br />
good thing in supporting the High Court, when the High Court -said in an<br />
English speaking country like this, your common law comes from European<br />
custom and tradition and we have now said your common law also comes<br />
from Aboriginal custom and tradition. This is a great change. Because it is<br />
the most honest recognition of the value to the rest of us of Aboriginal life and<br />
custom and tradition and, as Brian has remarked, we have had the pleasure<br />
of giving expression to how that title will be used and awarded in law with the<br />
Native Title Act.<br />
But these things and this opportunity we have in this part of the world, I am<br />
sure they [ in Asia] say of us " show us how you relate to your indigenies and<br />
we will show you how you relate to us" and I think we have made a<br />
psychological leap as a country. We have righted a wrong with terra nullius.<br />
We have engaged the community of countries around us. We don't select<br />
people on the basis of race. We know we have been given a great<br />
opportunity, that we can't squander. But Australia is a different place, it is no<br />
longer a monoculture, it is a multicultural place. It is a lively interesting place<br />
and we are now clear that we have been given this great opportunity.<br />
I think as we have intemnationalised the country, as we have made the leap<br />
with our exports into Asia, as our business culture has changed, as we have<br />
approached these countries, we have changed ourselves. We have changed<br />
our outlook in our culture and we do want to be a part of this community of </p>
<p>countries around us and we do see this as a tremendous opportunity here.<br />
And it has always been true, I think it is completely true because the<br />
Labor Party has always had this belief in Australia and through the<br />
wholesome view it has, it wants to see a happy society here and wants to see<br />
us be a-part of this greater society around us.<br />
I think there is a point of excitement about Australia, we haven't seen, not in<br />
my lifetime, that we are seeing now. You see the bounty and the opportunity<br />
when last week we had the economy growing at 3.7 per cent against the<br />
year, sixteen straight quarters of growth it is the longest phase of growth in<br />
years we have doubled our exports in ten years, we are educating about<br />
three times as many kids as we were ten years ago. Eight out of ten young<br />
people now finish secondary school, that is feeding through our higher<br />
education institutions, that is feeding the product innovation, that is feeding<br />
the exports.<br />
All of these things are making this a much more bountiful and exciting country<br />
and that sense of excitement is out there. I mean the polls might'nt measure<br />
all this. But if you go to Australians today and say " do you think Australia has<br />
a greater future, it is more secure, more certain of itself, more clear of what it<br />
is, more exciting?" I think they would answer in the affirmative. And I think<br />
that is very much what the next election will be about.<br />
John Howard thinks he is being tricky and clever hiding his policies. But he<br />
is not hiding them from me, he is hiding them from the Australian public.<br />
He says " I am not going to show that Prime Minister our policies until it suits<br />
me." That really is just simply cynical code for saying " I am not going to show<br />
the Australian public my policies, until the last moment or if ever'.<br />
Now I think that honesty in politics can only be about policies. It can only be<br />
about policies and where you stand and I take the view, maybe an old<br />
fashioned view, that the public have a right to know from the major parties<br />
what we think the big issues are and what the direction for Australia ought to<br />
be. I mean if they don't have that right, what right do they have? At least for<br />
the party leaders and the party to articulate the visions, the steps and the<br />
future for Australia. That is what we are doing.<br />
But John Howard is not doing that. He is playing a tricky, cynical, little<br />
political game trying to hide his policies because he thinks the public won't<br />
like them and you see this is not, if you like, honesty in politics. They try and<br />
compare themselves with the American Republicans. But at least you have<br />
got to see of Newt Gingrich, even if you don't agree with him, he puts his<br />
policies into the marketplace " that is what I stand for, If we get a Republican<br />
majority in the Congress that is what we will do. These will be our yardsticks.<br />
This is what our sheet anchor will be. You will know where we are coming<br />
from. We will go in there and we will actually do it because we will have your<br />
authority as a community and the constituency of the United States to do it."<br />
What do our conservatives do? No contract with Australia. No honesty.<br />
No policies in the marketplace. No mandate that they can claim. They want<br />
to try and slip under the wire without owning up to what they stand for and<br />
when they get there, without of course a mandate, they will just slip back to </p>
<p>their prejudicial policies of old. And for Howard it will be the old ones<br />
cutting the guts out of wages, straightening up working people, gutting<br />
Medicare.. ( Interjection: And Anti Discrimination legislation.)<br />
Well that too. All the things. You see that is what he will be about. He will<br />
be about back to those sorts of things. You saw them at the last election.<br />
You know there are only two members of the Shadow Cabinet that were not<br />
there when Fightback was put together. Now have they all had a Pauline<br />
conversion on the road to Damascus? Have they seen the light, or do they<br />
really believe in full fees for university students? Do they believe in the<br />
lowest common denominator for wages? They believe in no award<br />
protections. They believe in no support of award underpinnings of a wage<br />
system, that gives all the flexibility in the world. Well, of course, they don't.<br />
They believe in all the things they have always believed in and, of course, the<br />
unspeakable thing that Howard believes in, the three letters they can't utter,<br />
is GST. He really believes in the GST.<br />
You look at his whole career. It has been about three things. It has been<br />
about kicking income up to the highest level income families to income<br />
splitting. It has been about introducing a consumption tax and it is about<br />
what he calls labour market reforms, which is code for cutting the bottom<br />
quarter of the labour market back. That is what he believes in. That is all he<br />
has ever had to say and I mean Australia is a small country. We all know he<br />
goes on. He goes around the board rooms. I don't know whether he thinks<br />
I don't know about these things. I mean in some of these board rooms, I can<br />
hear the ants change step. You can hear the little zings. See the thing is I<br />
know they say: " Look he has no ideas. He has no ideas." He sits there, he<br />
goes there and recites all the old stuff and about mostly how they are going<br />
to nail us.<br />
But, of course, these people are running businesses. They want to know how<br />
they are going to keep their business growing. So he thinks because they<br />
are business executives, they are part of the sort of Liberal Party club, or the<br />
Liberal supporters and when he leaves they are all happy with him. Well<br />
they are not happy with him. They are not and we have some people saying<br />
to us in the media " oh well, Labor has lost the touch with business".<br />
You know some journos sitting constipated on a stool looking at a PC,<br />
tapping away in the Press Gallery. You know never been near a board room<br />
in ten years, telling us we have lost contact with business. I mean the fact of<br />
the matter is, that the Coalition has the same obscurantist view they had back<br />
in the 1970s. Australia has moved on, we are a completely different country,<br />
we have changed, we have made the leap into Asia, we are more confident<br />
about ourselves. Our culture has changed, it is ours now, it doesn't belong to<br />
anyone else. We want it to be like this.<br />
We have made great changes as a country and the public have been right in<br />
there with them and that is the sort of country it is -now. There is a floating<br />
exchange rate. Interest rates are set in the market. Wages are set by </p>
<p>enterprise or collective bargaining. It is not the old tricked up, bolted down,<br />
scene it was when Malcolm Fraser and John Howard were playing<br />
Prime Minister and Treasurer all those years ago and they think they are<br />
going to walk back in and because they think they're the pinstripe suit<br />
brigade-and they are back in business, the people are going to say " oh well<br />
that is it, let's put another five cents on the dollar, you know let's knock a<br />
couple of percentage points off interest rates". I mean they have got no idea<br />
of what it is like keeping all of those balls in the air the exchange rate,<br />
interest rate, wages, inflation, keeping it all up there.<br />
Only a Labor Government has ever done it under a market system like this.<br />
They have got no idea and have a look at them. Howard will be the<br />
Prime Minister and Fischer would be the Deputy Prime Minister. You have<br />
got to say where are we going? And then you have got Costello who does<br />
his you know.. I didn't think anyone could out-snarl Peter Reith but he has.<br />
Look he is one of our great assets. He always earns a round of applause.<br />
Him and Andrew Robb, they are out there.. you know that song " I've got my<br />
mojo working." Well we have got them out there working. Costello and<br />
Robb, every day, every time they are out there, we move up. So there is him.<br />
And then after that you'll say " well who else is there? Who is the education<br />
person?" Well that is.. we always call him Count Yorga Vampire Kemp.<br />
And then for business, there is Prosser. I mean what a side, what a side,<br />
and, of course, this is not lost on the business community. I mean those<br />
captains of industry who are picking up the million dollar salaries, they are<br />
not going to be managed by this crowd. There is a bit of professional pride<br />
there. I mean they may be in the Liberal Party, but they are not going to be<br />
run by them.<br />
So look, the thing is, I think that from our point of view we have got Australia<br />
now growing strongly. We have had 680,000 jobs growth in 2 1/ 2 years.<br />
That is an absolutely phenomenal number 680,000. I mean I made the<br />
point this way recently. It took us from 1788 to 1983 to get to six million and<br />
we have added over 10 per cent more in 2 1/ 2 years. It is unbelievably<br />
strong. I mean we went to the election. What was our principal commitment?<br />
That we would restore the economy to growth and employment. We have<br />
had 16 quarters of growth, we have had enormous employment growth and<br />
there has been complete fidelity in those core commitments we have made to<br />
the Australian public throughout the period.<br />
So we can go and we have taken the big issues on like Native Title, like the<br />
Land Fund, like the republic. All the things that will paint the way Australia<br />
will be in the 21st century. So we can look the public in the eye and say<br />
these are the sorts of things we stand for great initiatives like Working<br />
Nation, that pick up the long term unemployed. Or the labour market<br />
programs, or in education, or in health and we will develop, as always, our<br />
policy stance for the next election. We won't be hiding.<br />
There will be no obfuscation on the part of Labor. We will have our policies<br />
out there in the marketplace. We won't be slipping around and there will be<br />
no business saying am not going to show my policies to John Howard",<br />
because all that would mean is we are not going to show our policies to the<br />
Australian public and we have an honest relationship with the Australian </p>
<p>public. We don't need to be tricky. We have faith in them. We have faith in<br />
them to see through charlatans, people who have no ideas and people who<br />
are not going to be honest with them.<br />
So this is going to be, again, another important election, when it comes, for<br />
Australia. It is going to be to keep the strength of the changes coming<br />
through, to keep the linkages with Asia. Here was Howard last week.<br />
We had down, on his first ever trip to the west, the General Secretary of the<br />
Vietnamese Communist Party, someone running a country of 70 million<br />
fought the French, fought the Americans, fought the Chinese turning it now<br />
into a market economy. He wouldn't see him. He wouldn't see him, he<br />
snubbed him. He wouldn't meet him and Do Muoi went home to meet the<br />
American Secretary of State two days later.<br />
I mean it gives you some idea and yet Howard says he wants the stewardship<br />
of the Asia relationship for Australia and yet the week he snubbed Do Muoi,<br />
was the week they became full members of ASEAN. So what do the<br />
Malaysians, the Singaporeans, the Indonesians, the Thais, the Philippines,<br />
what do they think about when one of their partners was snubbed? Because<br />
why? Because he thinks there are a few votes out there with the Vietnamese<br />
community in Western Sydney and in parts of Melbourne. That is it. Just for<br />
the same reason he told those kids at Saint Ignatius High School that he<br />
would put a prohibition on uranium exports to France. He will say whatever<br />
he thinks will get the attention and the approbation at the moment. But in<br />
terms of the serious stewardship of the country's interests, he can't be relied<br />
upon and he can't be trusted.<br />
So I want to thank you for believing in us, for supporting us, for having faith in<br />
the better values which the Labor Party has always had on offer and knowing<br />
that we are at the cusp an exciting part of our history as we come into the<br />
21st century, as we throw off all the linkages to the vestiges of our past in<br />
terms of the things, our Constitutional linkages with Britain. These things<br />
which have been useful to Australia but are useful no longer. And that as we<br />
take that turn on the centenary of our federation and into that 21st century,<br />
that we will be the people marking out the way for Australia.<br />
Now that is what I think this election coming is going to be about and that is<br />
why I thank you for supporting us, supporting my colleagues with me tonight<br />
and coming along to hear what we have got to say. But more than that,<br />
simply to lend a hand. Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
