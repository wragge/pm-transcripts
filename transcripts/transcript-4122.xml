GOVERNMENT/ TRADE UNION SUMIT IN CANBERRA DT<br />
JUNE. MR. FRASER EXPLAIIS. John Highfield reports.<br />
FROM A. I. BROADCAST<br />
19 MAY, 1976<br />
HAMISH ROBERTSON: As you have no doubt heard there is to be<br />
a Government/ Trade Union summit in Canberra next month. During<br />
the conference the latest economic papers from the Treasury, the<br />
Reserve Bank and Government Departments will be laid on the table<br />
for union scrutiny. The Prime Minister has also given an undertaking<br />
that secret ballot legislation will not be proclaimed until<br />
after the summit. In Canberra Mr. Fraser is talking to John Highfield.<br />
JOHN HIGHFIELD: Prime Minister, why have you called the trade<br />
union movement to this conference.<br />
1IR. FRASER: It's not just the trade union movement. We also .; ant<br />
to have talks with the employers. But the trade union movement is<br />
important in relation to what happens in Australia. Their attitude<br />
to wages policy has a great influence on inflation, on the well<br />
being of their own members. We, in the package that will be<br />
announced in detail by the Treasurer, are proposing measures<br />
relating to tax indexation, to family allowances which, we believe,<br />
represent real economic and social reforms. The Government has<br />
a significant and obviously a leading role to play in these<br />
particular matters, but as I emphasised last night all Australians<br />
have a responsibility for what happens to this country. The trade<br />
Union movement has a responsibility. It is essential in the<br />
modern day Australia for the Government to be able to talk with the<br />
trade union movement concerning natters of importance, to be able<br />
to talk with the employer organisations concerning matters of </p>
<p>rJ. " P'STR cont'd: importance and I am glad therefore that<br />
Mr. Hawke, on behalf Of the trade union movement, has accepted<br />
wide ranging talks in which the economic advice available to us<br />
will be made available to himself and to his delegates, to his<br />
colleagues, and I would expect that trade union delegates and<br />
senior ministers, after the official briefings if I can put it<br />
that way would hold discussions concerning the future.<br />
JOHN HIGHFIELD: There's bound to be some people say that this<br />
in fact is a climb down by the Government in the face of some<br />
pressures from the A. C. T. U.?<br />
MRl. FRASER: Oh I can't think so for a moment, because I offered<br />
the talks last night and Mr. Hawke accepted them today. How can<br />
that be a climb down by the Government?<br />
JOHN HIGHFIELD: Well he made a fairly strong statement about the<br />
secret ballot legislation.<br />
MR. FRASER: Oh but the secret ballot legislation will be going<br />
through the Parliament. The only thing that is happening in<br />
relation to that is that we've said we will not proclaim it until<br />
after the talks. If there can be a lessening of differences<br />
concerning the future of the economy as a result of those talks<br />
it's no price to pay to say that the legislation won't be proclaimed<br />
until after them.<br />
JOHN HIGHFIELD: And possibly alter the legislation if a strong<br />
case is made by the unions?<br />
it. FRASER: Look, if a strong case can be made, of course we will<br />
listen to it. We will listen to that from anyone and I think we<br />
would be very foolish, you know, as a Government if we don't. </p>
