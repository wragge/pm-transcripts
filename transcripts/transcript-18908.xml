<p>The highly anticipated Moreton Bay Rail Link is under construction, with earthworks and bridge construction underway at Mango Hill - one of a number of new bridges being built for the project.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard visited the site today to inspect progress.</p>
<p>Once complete, the Moreton Bay Rail Link will provide crucial infrastructure for the growing Moreton Bay area.</p>
<p>It will deliver a 12.6 kilometre dual-track passenger rail line between Petrie and Kippa-Ring, providing much needed public transport options for one of the fastest growing areas in the country.</p>
<p>The new rail line will ease congestion on the surrounding road network, including the Bruce Highway.</p>
<p>The Moreton Bay Rail Link will also be a major part of regional and economic growth and will create more than 8400 jobs over the life of the project.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government's Nation Building Program is providing jobs today by building the infrastructure the nation needs for a more productive future.</p>
<p>Six new rail stations will be built as part of the project at Kallangur, Murrumba Downs, Mango Hill, Kinsellas Road, Rothwell and Kippa-Ring.</p>
<p>The $1.147 billion project is being funded jointly by the Gillard Government ($742 million), the Queensland Government ($300 million plus land) and the Moreton Bay Regional Council ($105 million).</p>
<p>Representing Queensland Transport Minister Scott Emerson, Murrumba MP Reg Gulley said the early construction works, involving road and bridge works, would minimise the impact on local traffic once the major road works began in 2013.</p>
<p>“While these works are being completed, design of the rail corridor, including the track, structures, and the six new stations will continue,” Mr Gulley said.</p>
<p>“Construction of the rail components for the Moreton Bay Rail Link will then get underway in the later part of 2013, with the new line scheduled for delivery by late 2016.”</p>
