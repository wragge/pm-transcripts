EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA ANM ASIA: KNOWING WHO WE ARE<br />
LECTURE TO THE ASIA-AUSTRALIA INSTITUTE<br />
SYDNEY 7.15PM, TUESDAY 7 APRIL 1992<br />
In 1935 the magazine, Autralian Quarterly-, Carried a long<br />
article entitled " Australia's Place in the Empire." It was<br />
the text of an address delivered in London by Robert Gordon<br />
Menzies. An address delivered in the circumstances he loved, to the<br />
audience he loved.<br />
Menzies love the English. Five years later in a speech<br />
to the British and Foreign Bible Society he said that he<br />
believed the English had " never., wilfully broken [ their]<br />
word." Never.<br />
The virtues of the English race and Australia's filial<br />
loyalty were themes of his 1935 address. " The thing which<br />
sticks firmly in the mind of the average Australian is that<br />
he is British.." he said.<br />
He told them that they should recognise our rel. ationship was<br />
a " blood relationship" before it was a mercantile one.<br />
And he asked themn a question which he said would determine<br />
our relationship with Britain not merely for the next five<br />
years, but for the next five hundred.<br />
" Does Great Britain keel that its sons and brothers.. are its<br />
own flesh and blood, or does it regard them as remittance<br />
men?" Now, in my view, Winston Churchill gave Menzies the answer a<br />
few years later. " Australians", he told Lord Moran, " come<br />
of bad stock." I L. L. * nr. </p>
<p>1 T E L 00 04 p r 9 1 9 I4 N oI2 u z z<br />
2<br />
It is also my view that Churchill answered in more concrete<br />
ways: in the abject disaster of Singapore and Malaya and in<br />
the attempt to prevent the return of Austral. ian troops from<br />
the Middle East to defend this country the country which<br />
lost 60,000 under the Union Jack in World War 1.<br />
But what I say is not what some people have called Ponbashing.<br />
Nor is it Paul Keating's idiosyncratic view of<br />
history. It is a view corroborated by any number of<br />
respectable Australian and British historians whose<br />
references I am happy to provide.<br />
It is a view corroborated by fact.<br />
Nothing I say tonight, and nothing I have said in recent<br />
weeks, can reasonably be interpreted as criticism of the<br />
British people, and least of all those British men and women<br />
who fought and suffered and died in the war against Japan<br />
and Germany.<br />
My criticism is directed at those Australians or, more<br />
accurately, that Australian attitude which still cannot<br />
separate our interests, our history, or our future, from the<br />
interests of Britain.<br />
It seems to me an attitude which still exercises at least a<br />
subliminal influence on our thinking persuading us that<br />
someone or something will do it for us.<br />
just as we went on believing that Britain would, long after<br />
it should have been obvious that Britain would not.<br />
I say that this attitude has long been, and remains,<br />
debilitating to our national culture, our economic future,<br />
our destiny as a nation in Asia and the Pacific.<br />
I spent the last decade attempting to make the necessary<br />
changes to the Australian economy facing it toward the<br />
world and opening it up, to make us more competitive and<br />
give us a chance.<br />
I know just how entrenched conservative Australian thinking<br />
can be on both sides of politics.<br />
we're talking about cultural changes, new ways of thinking<br />
and new ways of doing things.<br />
I know how hard it is to change Menzeen attitudes. And don't<br />
forget their economic manifestation: M4enzies believed in<br />
what he called a " balanced economy."<br />
In Britain the balance was between manufacturing and<br />
protected agriculture. In Australia the balance had to be<br />
the reverse. TEL: 7. Apr. 92 19: 48 No. 024 P. 02/ 12 </p>
<p>TEL: 7. p TO R;. 024 P. 03/ 12<br />
3<br />
It was all terribly simple and cosily interdependent: and<br />
the cost to us was in the sort of inefficient manufacturing<br />
which threatened until very recently to place us among the<br />
world's economic museums.<br />
We've altered a lot of the practices and habits of mind<br />
which emanated from that way of thinking at least as far<br />
as the economy goes.<br />
We've also gone a very long way towards getting rid of the<br />
industrial Culture of hostility.<br />
But altering our political perspective, which includes<br />
regenerating our spirit, pulling us together as a nation,<br />
focussing our sense of ourselves all these things, I<br />
believe, remain tasks for the nineties.<br />
These things, I assure you, are not meant as a distraction<br />
as some people have~ suggested. They are central.<br />
They are centrdl to our developing relationship with Asia<br />
and the Pacific.<br />
I am pleased, though not surprised, by the positive reaction<br />
in South-East Asia to the recent surge of independent and<br />
republican thinking in Australia.<br />
Let me go back to Winston Churchill for 8 moment and ask a<br />
simple question of the people who say my talk of nationhood<br />
is a distraction: Why should we have expected Winston<br />
Churchill to have acted in our interests? Why, despite his<br />
foresight and courage, should we have expected him to<br />
perceive the world through our eyes?<br />
Because of blood?<br />
Now the truth is, Churchill has been, if not a hero, a<br />
favourite historical figure of mine since boyhood. Menizies<br />
preferred Chamberlain. I admired the Churchill who stood up<br />
every week in the House of Commons and told those myopic<br />
equivocating cowards in his own party that Hitler was a<br />
criminal. That Churchill, and the Churchill who inspired his people in<br />
World War II, wa~ s a hero.<br />
But that does not mean, and should never have been expected<br />
to mean that he would automatically act in Australia's<br />
interest. John Curtin acted in Australia's interest when he insisted<br />
against the wishes of Churchill and another man I've always<br />
admired, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, that Australian troops<br />
be brought home not left in the_-Middle ast, nor diverted<br />
to Rangoon where they would have been killed or captured.<br />
Curtin insisted and won. He turned to America. </p>
<p>Robert Gordon Menzies called this " a great blunder."<br />
All this, of course, might be called ancient history. it<br />
might be called irrelevant. It might be said that Menzies<br />
was a man of his time and should not be judged with<br />
hindsight. But Menzies is a man of Q~ time too.<br />
His unnaturally long political era made possible by the<br />
split in the Labor Party his endless, and almost endlessly<br />
rgeasia-~ gye era sunk a generation of Australians in<br />
Anglophilia and torpor.<br />
The Menzies attitudes are still with us, as we sew when a<br />
few weeks ago I delivered a speech in the presence of Her<br />
Majesty the Queen of Australia.<br />
The sentiments I expressed then were nothing more then<br />
thoughts on behalf of Australians who valued their<br />
independence, appreciated the fact of our separate destiny<br />
and our need to grasp it, and who esteemed the Queen.<br />
The response from some prominent Australians indicated how<br />
far we still have to go before we can say that we do have<br />
the necessary independence of mind, the necessary<br />
appreciation that we have to make our own future, or, for<br />
that matter, the necessary mature esteem for our Head of<br />
State. These things we need in the next decade if we are to take<br />
our place in the region and in the world.<br />
My point is that we can no longer be Australian in the way<br />
Bob Menzies was Australian. And in making that change, like<br />
John Curtin, we can say that it is without prejudice to<br />
Britain. It is equally without prejudice to those generations older<br />
than my own, whom I know regret the passing of the old<br />
Australia. I know there is apprehension among them about the change<br />
some of it takes the form of very vocal opposition to all<br />
suggestions of reform or new directions.<br />
I think their position should be respected but<br />
conservatism has had its day, and, in truth, it was too long<br />
a day for the country's good.<br />
My responsibility is to this generation and succeeding ones,<br />
and these echoes of Menzies cannot be allowed to get in the<br />
way.<br />
We cannot pretend to ourselves that we are insulated from<br />
change in the world.<br />
11 ONOMMUmm </p>
<p>In any event, the ol0 traditions of Australia will remain<br />
with us.<br />
We are not about disloyalty but its opposite. We are about<br />
nationhood, and the democracy which is at the centre of it.<br />
That is something I think Australians must realise: that we<br />
don't go to Asia cap in hand, any more than we go, like<br />
Menzies went to London, pleading family ties.<br />
We go as we are. Not with the ghost of empire about us. Not<br />
as a vicar of Europe, or as a US deputy.<br />
But unambivalently. Sure of who we are and what we stand<br />
for.<br />
If we are to be taken seriously, believed, trusted, that is<br />
the only way to go.<br />
Sometimes, perhaps it's necessary to state the obvious:<br />
facing Asia we do nothing more or less than face reality<br />
and that is what Asia does in facing us.<br />
We might learn something from the geophysics of the<br />
situation. Geophysically speaking this continent is old<br />
Asia there's none older than this. It's certainly not<br />
going to move, and after two hundred years it should be<br />
pretty plain that we're not going to either.<br />
in 1992, we shouldn't think that we're anything less than a<br />
rightful presence In the region.<br />
It is sometimes argued that Australia's democratic<br />
institutions and traditions of tolerance and open debate<br />
somehow disqualify us from forming successful relationships<br />
in Asia.<br />
My starting point is that Australia's democratic<br />
institutions and traditions are non-negotiable.<br />
Many things have changed and will change in Australia our<br />
ethnic composition and, with it, our culture; our economic<br />
and industrial practices; our world view a great deal will<br />
change. But traditions of democracy, fairness and personal liberty<br />
which we have fought wars to defend, will remain this<br />
country's guiding principles.<br />
Sacrifice and achievements of Australians will not be<br />
forgotten in the new Australia indeed in a less ambivalent<br />
Australia their memory will grow.<br />
We recognise that it is thanks largely to our British<br />
heritage that we are a stable and mature liberal democracy<br />
of long standing. -W g7-1T -4g-024-P. 05/ 12 </p>

I cannot accept that this deeply rooted democracy is a<br />
disadvantage in dealing with Asia. it is a region, after<br />
all, which contains stable democracies like Japan and<br />
India, and a number of societies whose economic advance has<br />
opened the way to political liberalisation. South Korea and<br />
Taiwan to name just two.<br />
Given these developments in Asia, along with the democratic<br />
revolutions of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, I<br />
find it hard to accept that our going into the world will<br />
mean compromising our democracy.<br />
I incline very strongly to the view that, on the contrary,<br />
Australia's democracy is an advantage.<br />
In other words, In the growing political liberalisation of<br />
Asia we're not an aberration, but a natural fit.<br />
We don't need to be intrusive, but we have nothing to shrink<br />
from and plenty to give.<br />
What is true politically is also true economically.<br />
It is important for Australians to realise that this<br />
country's economic weight is considerable.<br />
Our GNP is third In the West Pacific and equal to the<br />
combined GNP of all the ASEAN countries.<br />
We have much of what the countries in the region need<br />
resources, space, a skilled work force, education services.<br />
We have the English language, adn a rapidly increasing<br />
number of young Australians who are competent in Asian<br />
languages. In 1990, 53,000 Australian students were<br />
studying Japanese in high school: this year the figure is<br />
95,000. The success of multiculturalism in Australia, and increasing<br />
immigration from Asia, have stimulated our awareness of<br />
Asian societies and improved our standing in the region.<br />
Recent changes in Asia are perhaps not so dramatic as they<br />
have been in Europe, but they are greater than is commonly<br />
understood. During the 1980s, North-East and South-East Asia constituted<br />
the fastest growing region in the world, expanding at<br />
approximately twice the world average growth rate. Together<br />
these countries account for about 1.7 billion people.<br />
That is change on a grand scale.<br />
we do not yet know what the shape of Asia geopolitically,<br />
or economically will be. But we do know that the key<br />
question for Australia is how to position ourselves to take<br />
maximum advantage of the changes. </p>
<p>The Cold war strategic structure of Asia is fading.<br />
The Cambodia peace settlement is a Striking example of the<br />
benefits that derive from more relaxed relations between the<br />
great powers in Asia.<br />
We also welcome the two Koreas joining the United Nations,<br />
and new openings in South Korea's relations with Russia and<br />
China. Set against these positive developments, of course, there is<br />
continuing concern about the possibility of North Korea<br />
developing nuclear weapons.<br />
Although Russia retains formidable nuclear end conventional<br />
military capabilities, its projection of power in the<br />
Western Pacific is constrained by economic pressures and<br />
greater priorities nearer home.<br />
Considered overall, the risk of military confrontation<br />
between the great powers in Asia is now significantly<br />
reduced. The economic dynamismn of Asian countries also contributes to<br />
regional stability. So too do the related processes of<br />
economic interdependence.<br />
As we seek the Strategy most likely to succeed in this<br />
generally favourable environment, three key questions<br />
confront us.<br />
First, what level of strategic and economic engagement with<br />
the Western Pacific will the United States sustain over the<br />
medium to long term?<br />
Second, what quality of international leadership will Japan<br />
achieve in the period ahead?<br />
Third, depending on the outcome of the Uruguay Round of<br />
multilateral trade negotiations, what type of trade<br />
alignments are likely to evolve in the Asia-Pacific region<br />
over the next decade?<br />
The questions are obviously inter-related. The issues have<br />
been much discussed and I don't wish now to add to the<br />
available body of analysis and speculation.<br />
Let me offer. instead, some comments on Australia's<br />
OrAf~ rannc. 1 in each case.<br />
1. The Bush Administration has announced a series of<br />
phased reductions to its military presence in East Asia.<br />
It is also currently withdrawing from the Subic Say<br />
naval base in the Philippines.<br />
At the same time, the United States has emphasised its<br />
determination to remain a strategic power in the Western<br />
Pacific over the long term. </p>
<p>I-<br />
8<br />
Even in a post-Cold War environmient, Australia<br />
considers that US strategic engagement in the Western<br />
Pacific, and the maintenance of existing US bilateral<br />
alliances, make a vital contribution to regional<br />
stability and confidence.<br />
Maintenance of a close security relationship between<br />
the United States and Japan is especially important. It<br />
provides not only assurance for Japan itself, but sets<br />
out a framework which helps legitimise Japan's defence<br />
posture in the eyes of other Asian countries.<br />
Despite increasing Japanese influence in the region,<br />
the United States remains a key economic partner for<br />
most Asian countries. The United States is still Asia's<br />
single most important export market, though it has been<br />
overtaken by Japan as the main source of aid and<br />
investment. in recognition of the United States' continuing<br />
importance as an economic partner of the Western Pacific<br />
region, Australia welcomes its active involvement in the<br />
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation or APEC process.<br />
2. Japan's impressive economic achievements are widely<br />
recognised, but their translation into international<br />
influence has been uneven.<br />
Given the perception that overall US influence in East<br />
Asia may decline over time, there is lively interest in<br />
whether Japan will fill the gap by assuming more<br />
international leadership.<br />
Our firm preference is for a more active Japanese role<br />
internationally. We are pleased to be working closely<br />
with Japan in the Implementation of the Cambodia peace<br />
settlement. We would support Japan's participation in United<br />
Nations peacekeeping. I am not talking here about a<br />
wider regional Japanese military role, which in any case<br />
is not sought by Japan.<br />
3. Against a background of frustratingly slow progress in<br />
the Uruguay Round, concern is often expressed that the<br />
international trading system will gradually degenerate<br />
into three trading blocs one in Europe, one in the<br />
Americas, and the other in East Asia.<br />
As is widely recognised, Australia has a considerable<br />
stake in a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round.<br />
An unsatisfactory outcome to the Round would<br />
undoubtedly Increase pressure on the multilateral<br />
trading system. The GATT framework would remain in<br />
force, but there would be increasing resort to bilateral<br />
and regional approaches to trade problems. </p>
<p>T C. Z -_ 7-7 77. NO. VU 4 v ' L<br />
9<br />
In the modern globalised trading environment, it is not<br />
inevitable that the Americas and East Asia would<br />
separate into rival trading blocs if the Round failed.<br />
Even if they did, Australia would still have viable<br />
trade policy options though undoubtedly inferior ones<br />
to those a multilateral system offers.<br />
Looking at our relations with Asia more generally, we are in<br />
fact more successfully engaged with the region than we<br />
commonly appreciate.<br />
Vindicating the efforts of Australian business to expand our<br />
commercial relations in the region, more than 60 per cent of<br />
Australia's merchandise exports now go to Asia.<br />
Those Australians who continue to doubt that this is where<br />
our national interests truly lie should take note.<br />
Those who know this but are still inclined to recoil from<br />
Asia should, I think, take heart.<br />
Every year our interdependence with Asia increases in<br />
proportion to the rest of the world.<br />
In 1991, the ASEAN countries became our second largest<br />
export market, taking 12 per cent of our exports, and moving<br />
ahead of both the United States and the European Community.<br />
With levels of growth in most Asian economies well above the<br />
world average, this upward trend in our exports to the<br />
region should also hold good.<br />
The opportunities for Australia cannot be overstated.<br />
Asia remains a major market for our traditional commodity<br />
exports, and these remain vitally important to our economy.<br />
But the Asian market has broadened. Over the period<br />
1983-91, Australia's manufactured exports to Asia grew twice<br />
as fast as the traditional areas of our trade.<br />
Exports of services grew even more rapidly. There was also<br />
expansion, albeit less dramatic, in Australian investment in<br />
Asia. It is all reason to believe that we can live and prosper in<br />
the Asia-Pacific.<br />
Most pleasing of all has been the emergence of new business<br />
links between Australia and the countries of South-East<br />
Asia. I look forward to seeing examples of this first hand when I<br />
go to Indonesia later in the month. </p>
<p>TEL:<br />
Just as Australia's economic engagement with Asia is more<br />
advanced than is sometimes realised, so too we have more<br />
scope to contribute to regional political affairs than is<br />
commonly appreciated at home.<br />
We start from the best possible position, having no<br />
historical or fundamental conflict of interest with any<br />
country in the region.<br />
We have institutional strengths to draw on. We have<br />
well-developed foreign policy expertise in the government<br />
and academia.<br />
We must be careful not to overplay our hand, but if our<br />
timing is good and we choose things which genuinely serve<br />
the wider interest, we can help shape the regional agenda.<br />
Our role as a catalyst In the Cambodia peace process is one<br />
good example. We have also played a useful role in launching<br />
and helping advance the APEC process, and in encouraging<br />
regional security dialogue in Asia.<br />
As I see it, the quality of Australia's future relationship<br />
with Asia very much depends on what happens with regard to<br />
trade alignments in the Pacific.<br />
The scope for Australia to achieve its broadest aspirations<br />
in the region will be that much reduced if the countries of<br />
East Asia see themselves as an economic bloc in rivalry with<br />
Europe and North America.<br />
That is why, without any illusions about the bad effects of<br />
US trade policies on Australia, when President Bush was here<br />
in January I put the case vigorously for continued US<br />
engagement in the Western Pacific.<br />
I mean a strategic presence and an economic presence and a<br />
presence in our regional institutions.<br />
The United States will be better for that, so will Asia.<br />
All this points to the wisdom of Australia's effort since<br />
1989 to establish and develop APEC.<br />
The general virtue of the process is its promotion of<br />
regional economnic cooperation within a framework which<br />
embraces North America and East Asia.<br />
A particular virtue is that it also provides a convenient<br />
framework within which Japan and the United States can work<br />
out their respective regional roles, without increasing<br />
pressure on their bilateral relationship.<br />
Regardless of the outcome of the Uruguay Round, APEC's value<br />
will grow considerably if a process of non-discriminatory<br />
regional trade liberalisation can be carried forward with<br />
conviction. T7EL.: Rpr. 92 19: 48 No. 024 P. 10/ 12 </p>
<p>TEL: 7ARpr. 92 19: 48 No. 024 P. 11/ 12<br />
The objective should be to promote an open regionalism which<br />
is compatible with a wider Multilateral trading system.<br />
Another way of promoting cooperation in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region would be to establish a process of periodic<br />
heads-of-government meetings, say every two or three years.<br />
The absence of such a process is conspicuous in a region<br />
whose weight in global affairs is steadily increasing.<br />
Various formulas for participation are possible, but I<br />
personally would find most attractive a mechanism based on<br />
APEC membership, because it embraces the most important<br />
economic linkages throughout East Asia and across the<br />
Pacific. I discussed this general idea with President Bush when he<br />
visited Australia. I hope to pursue it as opportunity<br />
allows with other Asia-Pacific leaders.<br />
Without doubt the appropriate note on which to conclude is 8<br />
positive one.<br />
We have come a long way In the last decade: there is every<br />
chance of a quantum leap in the next.<br />
We won't make that leap in the way Bob Menzies might have<br />
tried to make it. Blood will not determine it.<br />
To do it, we need to recognise that we have become a player<br />
in these affairs and have a stake in them not by<br />
accident, but by initiative.<br />
The key to our success now rests with ourselves. In<br />
initiatives we have taken abroad. And in the ones we have<br />
taken at home.<br />
Sometimes it seems to me that Australians have ceased to<br />
believe that we got here largely under our own steam.<br />
In truth we did. in truth we've not done badly.<br />
But we'll do best when we've removed all signs of our being<br />
a branch office.<br />
We'll never get anywhere but into trouble if we drift as<br />
we did in the fifties.<br />
In the eighties, we took hold of the rudder and set about an<br />
essential economic transformation which leaves us able to<br />
hold our own in Asia in the nineties.<br />
We can confidently expect further success to follow in the<br />
course of recovery and from the major Infrastructure<br />
projects, investment incentives, huge investment in<br />
vocational training, and continuing micro-economic and<br />
industrial relations reforms announced in the One Nation<br />
statement last month. </p>
<p>TEL 12<br />
AS I said earlier, I have spent much of the past decade<br />
engaged in structural reform.<br />
That has also meant something equally as difficult perhaps<br />
more difficult. I mean cultural reform, the reform of our<br />
outlook. Success at home depends on this change. Success in Asia<br />
depends on it too.<br />
It depends on the individual and collective faith of<br />
Australians: It depends on establishing beyond doubt<br />
S that Asia is where our future substantially lies;<br />
S that we can and must go there;<br />
S and that this course we are on is irreversible.<br />
What John Curtin said in 1942 is right for us in 1992: " On<br />
what we now do depends everything we may like to do."<br />
