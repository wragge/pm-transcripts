PRIME MINISTER 153/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
FURTHER HELP FOR VICTORIAN FLOOD VICTIMS<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided on a new package of assistance for<br />
people affected by flooding in regional Victoria, in addition to the substantial<br />
assistance provided immediately after the flooding.<br />
This decision follows the receipt of a report prepared by my Rural and Regional Task<br />
Force, and further considerations by my colleagues in the Ministry. The task force,<br />
ci-aired by the Member for Page, Harry Woods, visited the severely affected centre of<br />
Benalla on 12 November to examine first-hand the damage caused by the floods.<br />
The Government will make available $ 209,000 from Landcare funds, on a dollar-fordollar<br />
basis with the Victorian Government, to develop further flood prevention<br />
measures. An extra 50 JOBSKILLS places will be allocated to the flood-affected region. This is<br />
in addition to the 20 LEAP places allocated to the Wangaratta-Benalla area for 1993-<br />
94 at a cost of $ 164,000.<br />
The Govcrnmcnt plans to amend the Social Security Act to permit some retrospective<br />
payments. In the Victorian floods, there is clear evidence of some families having<br />
difficulty in accessing entitlements. Where people were eligible for benefits, but did<br />
not get their applications in on time because of the floods, payments will be available<br />
as an act of grace.<br />
In light of the Victorian experience, I will discuss with the Minister for Finance<br />
whether we need to review the thresholds which operate under the Natural Disaster<br />
Relief Arrangements, and the relative treatment of households and businesses under<br />
the A-angements. This will be additional to the substantial assistance provided to<br />
Victoria under the existing arrangements.<br />
This response shows that this Government is committed to ensuring that appropriate<br />
and timely assistance is provided to those affected by natural disasters of this type.<br />
