PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, FEBRUARY 26 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I'll just say a few introductory things. One Nation Is<br />
basically a four year plan for Australia, it's a<br />
Statement which I think will lead to a turning point in<br />
our economic history and our social history, it will<br />
help us bring on a recovery to lift employment to deal<br />
with the problems of jobs, the creation of jobs and it<br />
will continue to produce a gulf as it has, as to date<br />
has been the case, but I think an even wider gulf<br />
between what the Government stands for and what the<br />
Coalition stands for, that is the Party which has<br />
reformetd Australia, taken it out of the Rip-Van-Wrinkle<br />
years of Menzies that made Australia an international<br />
place and which will continue to do that, that is, the<br />
Party which has reformed and built Australia will prove<br />
tonight: it is going to continue to go on doing just<br />
that. So I think it will contrast with basically the<br />
sterilEi approach the Liberal Party has taken, but most<br />
importantly what it does, it will accelerate the<br />
recovery, it will bring Australia back into growth, it<br />
will bring it back into growth in a cyclical sense, in<br />
the cycle, but improving the long-run structure for the<br />
productive base of the economy. So it has a lot of<br />
long-run portents and will set Australia up well for<br />
the 1990s. So I'll take questions from there.<br />
J: Prime Minister what extent do the tax cuts you<br />
foresha~ dow merely off-set bracket creep?<br />
PM: Well thie important thing about the tax cuts is that<br />
Labor has in the 1980s given back more than bracket<br />
creep, more than bracket creep, but certainly fully<br />
off-set: bracket creep. In other words the real<br />
incidence of taxation wasn't rising. But we did it in<br />
the context of precuring agreements about real wage<br />
restraint and producing lower inflation and as you know<br />
the tax cuts of 1989 are one of the principle reasons<br />
why we now have a low inf lation rate. In part of our<br />
discussions with the ACTU, while we are not in a wage </p>
<p>-2<br />
tax trade-of f like we were in the 1980s where we had a<br />
reductiLon in nominal wage outcomes in return for taix<br />
cuts for particular people within certain decile income<br />
groups,. what this is is creating a tax environment<br />
which will be conducive to the maintenance of sensible<br />
wage outcomes. So it does two things. It will help us<br />
maintaiLn that low inflation performance which, of<br />
course,. will be a great boon to Australia and as well<br />
as that, it will provide an incentive for a great<br />
categor7y Of tax payers with a lower marginal rate of<br />
tax, that is, an incentive to earn more, to do more<br />
overtime for instance, create more income without<br />
loosing it at the marginal rate step of now 38%<br />
reducing that to 30. But I make the point it is<br />
it's a structural change, it's 30% but need I hasten to<br />
add without a 15% string attached, without a<br />
consump~ tion tax attached to it.<br />
J: Is it as off-setting as<br />
PM: It off-* sets the bracket creep in the period.<br />
J: Mr Keat~ ing, don't you loose the leverage that tax cuts<br />
will give you to bargain with unions?<br />
PM: Well we needed a lot of that leverage when we had<br />
inflation running to 7-8% t. It'Is very hard to run a<br />
system at but it'Is much easier to run a system<br />
with low inflation and because we are now moving into a<br />
decentralised wage structure where productivity<br />
opportunities will present themselves, the most<br />
important thing is to shift from aggregate wage<br />
outcomes to inflation so the guiding light in looking<br />
at our wages system and affordability of wages will be<br />
keeping our inflation rate comparable without trading<br />
partners. That will be the yard stick which governs<br />
what the Government says before national wage hearings,<br />
in its relations with the ACTU and the unions and in<br />
relaticon to taxation.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is the message from the unemployment<br />
forecasts that the worst is over, it was not quite as<br />
bad as you thought and it's going to decline in time to<br />
come?<br />
PM: Well we have got unemployment coming back to 10% in<br />
1992-93 and then to 7 3/ 4 in 1995-96, but of course<br />
with very high participation rates, with very high<br />
participation rates. I mean if we were looking at the<br />
participation rates of the early 1980s and comparing it<br />
to these we would have much, much lower unemployment<br />
numbers.<br />
J: Prime Minister, if that is the case then why is it that<br />
things like JobSearch, NEWSTART, Jobstart etc are<br />
being cut back? </p>
<p>3-<br />
PM: No, JobStart is being increased, Jobtrain is being cut<br />
back, only one. Because we didn't think there was any<br />
point in training people for jobs that were not there.<br />
There : Ls a net addition to those labour market programs<br />
which are all described in the document.<br />
J: Just looking at the document here it shows 3 specific<br />
figures that are a reduction<br />
PM: No, there it is, JobStart 15, $ 85M, 10; Jobtrain is a<br />
re-education; Jobskills $ 30M, $ 15M extra, and when you<br />
look at apprentices, the assistance retention of<br />
indenture to apprentices is $ 3.2M in $ 1.6 in 1991-92,<br />
$ 3.2 in 1992-93, and of course need I say that in terms<br />
of vocation training it's a total revolution in<br />
education here. A $ 720M program over three years to do<br />
for TAFE what the Commonwealth did for universities<br />
back in the 1970s and 1980s and so these vast retention<br />
rates which Labor has presided over giving children the<br />
opportunity of completing, in very large numbers,<br />
secondary school has been not only accommodated now in<br />
many p: laces in higher education and universities, but<br />
as well. as, that now in future in technical and further<br />
education, a national system of technical and further<br />
education.<br />
J: Mr Keating, high retention rates and also the fact<br />
that in the first year Dr Hewson 50,000 people off<br />
the dole queues, is it f air to say that you are using<br />
he training system to disguise the level of<br />
unemployment?<br />
PM: I don' 11: think you can say the revolution in education<br />
and whatever else you can call it, I think you can ca] ll<br />
it that is about basically changing the unemployment<br />
numbers. I mean high cynicism I understand but that is<br />
getting beyond the pale.<br />
3: What convinced you that Australian families deserve<br />
this very generous one-of f allowance gesture and what<br />
would you like them to spend it on<br />
PM: Well it: is' up to them but I think that the categories<br />
of people who will receive it, Australian families will<br />
spend it generally. And the point of it is that it can<br />
happen early, it can happen in this budgetary year',<br />
it's not a matter of waiting until the next Budget. So<br />
before the profile of the stimulus comes from the<br />
public works programs the railways, the roads, and all<br />
the Other great initiatives which are there which will<br />
build up through the course of calendar 1992. This, in<br />
terms of fiscal stimulus, will provide a much earlier<br />
profile to that rise. And so it is going to the people<br />
who I think need it and spend it, that is, families and<br />
of courcse, for low income families it is on-going.<br />
There : Ls a $ 250 million a year on-going expenditure<br />
under the Family Allowance Supplement. So there's two<br />
parts, there's a family allowance payment which is one-</p>
<p>-4<br />
off and the one-off of course doesn't have a cyclical<br />
it's a cyclical matter of its essence. There is no ongoingness<br />
there on the Bugdet in 1993-94, but the vast<br />
part of it is a permanent $ 250 million improvement.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the financial markets have been skimpish<br />
lately and the dollar has been bouncing around a bit,<br />
do you see this package steadying the markets?<br />
PM: Don't ask me to pour over them. I don't know what they<br />
think of this. I can only say this, I said we would do<br />
a responsible and a constructive thing. This brings<br />
the surplus, this produces a fiscal surplus in 1995-96.<br />
It has a cyclical profile to the spending and it drops<br />
away and as the economy recovers and the receipts<br />
recover, as the outlays drop away, as you see in those<br />
profiles, that the Budget balance goes from a peak of<br />
$ 8 billion, dropping back to $ 4.6 billion deficit, then<br />
$ 600 miLllion and a surplus of $ 2 billion. So, I don't<br />
know. I think the financial markets would regard that<br />
as sensible, a sensible thing to do for a recession and<br />
a recovery, and a sensible thing to do f or the long<br />
run.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what do you say to Opposition criticism<br />
that the growth projections to deal with this deficit<br />
are too heroic by half?<br />
PM: I don't think they are heroic at all. We'Ive got in<br />
there for GDP 4 and 3/ 4 per cent. We had, I think, In<br />
' 83-4 Something like 6 per cent growth in that year.<br />
And if you look at this economy compared to the economy<br />
then, we've got a much better position with the profit<br />
share in the economy, we are much better aligned in the<br />
factor shares, you don't have these huge structural<br />
deficits overhanging the economy, you've got a stimulus<br />
there coming from, for a start, a competitive exchange<br />
rate and more recently, depreciation, the obvious<br />
changes; which are going to occur from a change i~ n<br />
international trading conditions and the breaking of<br />
the drought, and stocks. So I think it's very<br />
conservative, 4 3/ 4 is a conservative number.<br />
J: Mr Keating, in this 4 year plan, in the scenario you<br />
don't say anything about what will happen to foreign<br />
debt over that period. Won't it be higher in the end<br />
and have an effect on the current account?<br />
PM: No, on page 126 you'll1 f ind some text there on the<br />
current: account. It says, talks about it coming back<br />
to 3 3/ 4. This would be consistent with a slight drift<br />
upwards in the ratio of net external liabilities to<br />
GDP. As a ratio of debt to equity financing however,<br />
returns: to'levels which existed prior to the excessive<br />
leveraging of the late 1980' s, the net external debt to<br />
GDP ratio could stabilise or decline slowly. </p>
<p>J: So you are saying we can sustain the growth we had in<br />
the 1980s which we now have a blow out in debt?<br />
PM: Well obviously we had a lot of leveraging, we had a lot<br />
of equity displacement with debt. They're saying go<br />
back to more normal levels of debt to equity in the<br />
financing of the Australian current account and that<br />
the, to read it to you again that a slight drif t<br />
upwards in the ratio of net external liabilities to<br />
GDP, but then they say the net external debt to GDP<br />
could stabilise or decline slowly.<br />
J: To what extent is that helped by the easing for foreign<br />
investment rules?<br />
PM: Well it: might be because there has been a big shif t<br />
from debt to equity in the last couple of years as you<br />
well know and the easing of foreign investment will<br />
obviousl] y facilitate more equity investment in<br />
Australia and therefore less equity is not attracted to<br />
interest rates where debt does obviously.<br />
J: Mr Keating is the payment to families some sort of<br />
compensation to the bitter blow of the recession?<br />
PM: Well it is obviously a help for families. It's a help<br />
for families and obviously some will do it tougher than<br />
others, but it is a help for families and it's a way of<br />
inducing some stimulus to the economy and I think an<br />
efficient way.<br />
J: pensioners and they are worse off than families.<br />
PM: Well they were adjusted with full indexation right<br />
through the 1980s and wage earners were not.<br />
J: How much willingness do you think there is on the part<br />
of the private sector to fund public infrastructure<br />
projects?<br />
PM: Quite at lot. What is in here is a very innovative<br />
change. As you know there is a very innovative change<br />
in the tax system here for private provision of public<br />
infrastructure, but the key is that it has to be<br />
private. In other words we are not changing those<br />
sections of the Income Tax Act where a business would<br />
claim deductions under these measures while the income<br />
of the business was guaranteed by a state government or<br />
a state instrumentality.<br />
J: How are they going to turn a profit over 30 years?<br />
PM: Well it depends on what they do.<br />
J: Are we going to see toll roads in Australia?<br />
PM: Well you may well do. I mean you will see, you have<br />
seen some already, but you will see I think a number of </p>
<p>6<br />
projects in the land transport area which can be taken<br />
on as private ventures, and if they are they will get<br />
the benefits of these concessions. I mean it is a very<br />
attractive arrangement for a shift into private<br />
provision of infrastructure. Can I make this example,<br />
if we separate, as we propose here, power generation<br />
from power distribution and we have a grid company<br />
which breaks up the monopolies of the electricity<br />
commissions which is entirely possible under these tax<br />
concessions, the next major power station in Australia<br />
would be privately built, for instance.<br />
J: Mr Keating why did you single out the sales tax on<br />
cars?<br />
PM: Because I think the rate's been too high. We're<br />
producing the same number of cars now we were in the<br />
early 1970s, we have got a car fleet with an average<br />
age of 17 years which is inefficient, which is<br />
polluting the environment, which is costing motorists a<br />
lot in keeping them roadworthy which has obviously<br />
safety considerations about it and is not as a one-off<br />
but as a permanent change for the car industry. We<br />
reduced the sales tax up to the limit where the tax<br />
rate changes. For luxury vehicles we reduced it from<br />
to 15% and hopefully that is about $ 800 on a<br />
Commodore or Ford and hopefully it will stimulate the<br />
motor vehicle industry which needs a stimulus at this<br />
time and hopefully change over time the age profile of<br />
the Australian vehicle industry.<br />
J: When do you look at finishing the wholesale sales tax?<br />
PM: Well it has this virtue that you can actually decide<br />
whether cars, passenger motor vehicles, the cars most<br />
people buy are at 20 per cent and whether the luxury<br />
cars are at a higher rate.<br />
J: suggest you might wait to the August Budget?<br />
PM: Well a Budget is a Budget, you can do all those sorts<br />
of things, this is about a recovery, a stimulus and a<br />
recovery a continual change though on the production<br />
side of the economy through such things as<br />
depreciation, the vast change I mean the big business<br />
change in here, a vast change of depreciation<br />
arrangements, other innovative changes and the<br />
rebuilding of all the infrastructure so long left<br />
neglected. It's a quarter of a century since we put<br />
investment to rail, a quarter of a century and, of<br />
course, it is always Labor that builds the big<br />
projects, it's always Labor that takes the lead and<br />
it's Labor again which is going to give Australia a<br />
rail highway, it's Labor again which will give<br />
Australia a national electricity grid, it's Labor for<br />
the first time to give Australia an internationally<br />
competitive system. </p>
<p>-7<br />
J: And will this alone win you the next election?<br />
PM: I think it contrasts, does it not, with the sterile<br />
accountancy of Dr Hewson's package.<br />
J: Mr Keating with going to win the election campaign<br />
with 10% unemployment and $ 80 million debt economy<br />
to turn out right by 1995-96, what can you say to the<br />
Australian people<br />
PM: If you have sat here for any years we have got a<br />
structural budgetary position which is so tight that<br />
once the unemployment starts to drop back and the<br />
receipts start to pick up the budget swerves back into<br />
surplus. I mean we didn ' t sit there for seven and a<br />
half years cutting structural budget outlays to achieve<br />
other than a very tight budgetary system at the moment<br />
which has expanded because of the natural stabilisers,<br />
the recession, but which will close back. So it is not<br />
a matter of having any f aith, I mean that is simply a<br />
mechanical matter a mechanical matter, but I think the<br />
more general point is the point, I mean the Opposition<br />
are about shifting the tax base from income to<br />
expenditure, that's essentially it. This is about<br />
continuing the micro changes, it will not change the<br />
travelling time for freight between Sydney and<br />
Melbourne, to pay you tax on your food, your clothing<br />
or your dry cleaning, it won'It change that and there's<br />
nothing in Fightback that changes. It won't change the<br />
interface between the ports and the railways, there's<br />
nothing in Fightback which will change that. The sort<br />
of proposals we have here for electricity or the<br />
airline system or to give our children a change of a<br />
decent technical education. I mean the breadth and<br />
magnitude of this package, the imagination of this<br />
package: compared to the accountancy, the sterile<br />
accountancy of a shift in tax f rom income to<br />
expenditure and of course the damning review which its<br />
principal econometricists paid it to say it will<br />
actually reduce GDP. It will actually increase<br />
unemployment, it will actually increase inflation.<br />
Compare that to this!<br />
J: How did you come up with a figure of $ 800,000?<br />
PM: Well that'Is part of our modelling. It's simply about<br />
where wre see employment growth and we've got $ 150,000 I<br />
think in 1991-92, $ 200,000 in 1992-93 and about a<br />
quarter of a million each year thereafter.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well : Lt's the package overall I think which is<br />
important, the impact on the economy, the depreciation,<br />
all of the other things. They have to in the end be<br />
about growth, GDP. The linkage between employment and<br />
GDP is pretty clear. </p>
<p>8-<br />
J: In your 3 projections you've got demand outstripping<br />
supply iLn a big way, imports up on exports, GNE higher<br />
than GDP<br />
PM: Paul ( Bongiorno) we have trained you well you would not<br />
have known, you poor old thing, what GNE was. It<br />
gladdens my heart. You have warmed me up, you could<br />
have paid me no greater compliment.<br />
J: how will we get better results after the 1994-95<br />
election without slamming on the brakes, higher<br />
interest rates?<br />
PM: What will happen is that, the economy will respond to<br />
the investment. It will respond to a higher profit<br />
performance. It will respond to more demand. It will<br />
respond to a better depreciation schedule and demand<br />
for investment will rise. Therefore that will be<br />
reflected in imports. But it will taper off, obviously<br />
after that surge and we have it tapering off through<br />
the periods. We have been very conservative, I think,<br />
estimates on exports. Quite conservative on exports<br />
and if that's the case, we will do better. We will do<br />
better on the merchandise trade balance than we've got<br />
here. But even here we have got the current account<br />
coming back to 3 3/ 4 per cent.<br />
J: But will it taper off without the use of interest rate<br />
cuts? Will we revert to the late<br />
PM: Where are you? Oh Don ( Woolford).<br />
J: in the late<br />
PM: Well, in the late ' 80s was a period of unprecedented<br />
boom in. credit growth. 20 per cent a year for the last<br />
couple of years by a global financial market system<br />
which was funding credit often unwisely, chasing asset<br />
prices around the world. I mean that's the sort of...<br />
We had demand running at twice the product growth.<br />
This is not the case here. So that sort of monetary<br />
regime which we employ, to try and pull our demand, our<br />
spending back in line with our production, is not the<br />
sort of.-thing which is in here.<br />
J: Mr Keating do you have the ( inaudible)?<br />
PM: Well, i~ t says the Government wants the economy to grow.<br />
It's providing a stimulus to help it grow. We've got<br />
low interest rates now feeding into the system. We've<br />
got depreciation and a competitive exchange rate<br />
feeding into the system, a competitive exchange rate<br />
system which we've had since 1983. If we are comparing<br />
this to other recessions, we have got those changes.<br />
We've ( jot the corporate sector now running very tight.<br />
The first shift in volume will go straight into<br />
profits. Straight into profits, so the profit share<br />
will rebound quite sharply. I think all these things </p>
<p>9-<br />
are great boosts of confidence and we are doing the<br />
work. We're not asking the private sector to spend,<br />
even though we do that through the depreciation<br />
allowance. We're doing it ourselves. We're going to<br />
spend. We're the people who are going to remodel the<br />
railway lines and build the ring roads, and do these<br />
other we are doing it ourselves. So all of that<br />
kick-start, that stimulus, will go into the economy and<br />
I think it will be a bull point for conf idence and it<br />
should be a bull point for consumer confidence. And we<br />
are helping consumer confidence by putting money into<br />
families who we think will spend it.<br />
J: Does your strong confidence in inflation mean that you<br />
have got the unions in your pocket now?<br />
PM: Well, it is not a matter of having the Unions in my<br />
pocket. The Unions have been the most cooperative<br />
institution in the 1980s haven't they? They took<br />
reductions in real wages, they saw inflation come down.<br />
But what we are doing is we are keeping the place<br />
together. The difference between us and the<br />
confrontation of the Liberal Party is we're bringing<br />
together a partnership between Government and business,<br />
between Government and Unions, to maintain sensibly a<br />
hard won victory over inflation. We're not doing as<br />
Dr Hewson is doing, doubling the inflation rate with a<br />
per cent tax on everything people spend and consume.<br />
We are not taking that risk. We're keeping inflation<br />
low. We've broken the back of a 20 year problem and<br />
we're keeping it broken and the Unions have the good<br />
sense, -and the national spirit. We have got a very, we<br />
have had a very responsible trade union movement.<br />
J: Back onto consumer confidence, will there be another<br />
interest rate cut?<br />
PM: There has been an 11 percentage point cut in the system<br />
now and rates are at very low levels and I think, we<br />
are seeing some change in confidence levels in the<br />
recording of confidence levels and we have seen some<br />
improvement, notable improvement in employment since<br />
December. So I think the thing is starting to work. I<br />
think -this document will do it. It will. get it<br />
together. And it will get it together because we're<br />
tackling the problem as a nation, one nation, pulling<br />
it together business, Government, unions keeping<br />
the social wage, keeping the safety net, helping the<br />
families, helping the low paid, helping the people who<br />
will dco things with a depreciation allowance, helping<br />
the people who want to invest in public infrastructure.<br />
It's these common goals which I think will help induce<br />
a better ambience and confidence in the community.<br />
J: Do you think interest rates have reached bottom?<br />
PM: Well, that's what you say. </p>
<p>10<br />
J: allow foreign banks a licence?<br />
PM: Because I think that foreign banks are likely to<br />
provide competition in the business area, that they'll<br />
be innovative, that they'll cash flow finance, that<br />
they will assess credit risk, probably provide<br />
competition to business lending and the assessment<br />
credito: cs, and I think they'll be a good competitive<br />
force and can be a good competitive force for our big<br />
banks.<br />
J: Treasury-like document. Does this mean that you<br />
are going to hold a much firmer view about Treasury<br />
PM: Where are you from, you keep asking me questions?<br />
J: American Press Association.<br />
PM: The thing is it is not a Treasury document, it's a<br />
social document.<br />
J: But it has the old Paul Keating trade mark from his<br />
Treasury days.<br />
PM: Let me just tell you, it's a social document, a<br />
document of social and economic change, and I think<br />
that's what's important about it. But it is, of<br />
course, laden with innovation and change. And to the<br />
extent that you think I've brought you other things<br />
laden with innovation and change, I'm please you think<br />
this is the case again. Thank you one and all.<br />
