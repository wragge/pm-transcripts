assessment of the future of the manufacturing sector in Australia.<br />
As well as providing a basis for discussion and debate<br />
the report of the Jackson Committee makes several recommendations<br />
which will require immediate consideration by the Government.<br />
Accordingly, a Committee of Ministers has been established to<br />
examine those recommendations only, as a matter of urgency, and<br />
advise Cabinet on them. The Committee consists of the Prime Minister,<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister, the Ministers for Manufacturing Industry<br />
and Labor and Immigration, the Special Minister of State and the<br />
Treasurer. The report is presently being printed and copies are<br />
expected to be available for general distribution within a few weeks.<br />

edition is available as quickly as possible, to ensure the widest<br />
possible circulation and the fullest possible public debate before<br />
decisions are taken. Advance orders for either Volume 1 separately<br />
