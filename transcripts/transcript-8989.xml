TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
6 OCTOBIER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I will just make a short statement before taking a Couple of questions. Today I<br />
placed the Opposition on notice in regard to their conduct during Question<br />
Time. Anyone watching the proceedings could be left in no doubt that the<br />
Opposition is engaging in a deliberate and wilful tactic of disruption.<br />
Ministers' answers could not be heard and the Speaker was placed in an<br />
impossible position. And while the Opposition treats the forms of Parliament<br />
with such utter disregard in Question Time and in the Senate the Government<br />
will respond emphatically.<br />
The Government will not be bending to this deliberate assault, and that's why<br />
I cut short Question Time today.<br />
As you know I believe that Question. Time should allow for robust and<br />
vigorous exchanges, I have always approached Question Time in that way. I<br />
have been in Parliament long enough to know to, that on some occasions<br />
these exchanges go further than the public would approve, or even<br />
convention permits. But today's tactic constituted a deliberate tactic to<br />
disrupt the continuity of Ministers answers and where the Opposition felt like<br />
it simply to drown them out.<br />
I hope this unusual action will focus attention on the Opposition's attitude to<br />
this Parliament, and in particular the behaviour in the Senate. There is a<br />
common link between their behaviour in the House of Representatives today<br />
and in the Senate, both of which are calculated to tear away at the<br />
Government's legitimacy.<br />
The Government convincingly won the election just six months ago, the<br />
Opposition is behaving as though the Government is not legitimate, that it has<br />
a right to disrupt the House of Representatives and the Senate to curtail the<br />
House of Representatives capacity to do business until the end of October.<br />
All these things hold the parliamentary process and the political mandate of<br />
the Government in contempt. </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
I am happy to take questions from you.<br />
J will there be a Question Time tomorrow?<br />
PM; Yes. But again, we've had the Opposition's Question Time tactics<br />
under notice now for some time. Now I noticed today the West<br />
Australian Speaker was in the Chamber apparently, and he cut<br />
Question Time off in Western Australia after four minutes last week, I<br />
am told. Now, the fact is we have a robust Question Time and nobody<br />
complains. But Ministers have got a right to give answers so that the<br />
continuity of their answers is maintained and that they can be heard, It<br />
is an awfully difficult thing to try and concentrate on a technical<br />
answer, often when there is a barrage of abuse coming your way. And<br />
that was happening today and it is not something that is going to be<br />
easily dealt with by a Speaker when the wthole of the Opposition take<br />
this on as a tactic.<br />
J-Prime Minister, aren't you rather falling for the Opposition's trick? I<br />
mean aren't you, you are accusing them of breaching convention, but<br />
here you are breaching convention as far as Question lime is<br />
concerned?<br />
PM; No. Look, the convention is to treat the standing orders appropriately,<br />
there's where the convention lies, to let the process proceed<br />
appropriately and to not approach it disruptively. Now, as a<br />
Government our record on this Is, I think, very clear. But again,<br />
Question Time is there for the information of honourable Members, it is<br />
not there for these disruptive tactics.<br />
SHaven't you contributed to the mood of Question Time today when the<br />
second question today went from 2.08 to 2.23? It was 15 minutes.<br />
PM: We have an Opposition blocking the revenue measures, the major<br />
revenue measures of a Budget. This Is a matter of high and legitimate<br />
comment, in the House of Representatives at Question Time, and I<br />
chose to make these points and also to quote in a very specific way,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, on the same subject. Now, the Opposition were<br />
irked at me referring to one of their own, in such precise terms, about a<br />
very similar circumstance of a Government just having been re-elected<br />
with a majority, with a popular mandate, with a contemporaneously<br />
elected Parliament, and these things needed to be said. The<br />
promotion of problems here is the unprincipled tactic of the Opposition.<br />
As I said in the House, John Hewson will try and present himself in two<br />
and a half years time as the Leader of the Coalition and seek a<br />
majority to form a Government in the House of Representatives. But<br />
does he expect to be able to say, I expect any Government that I would<br />
lead to enjoy the passage of financial legislation in the Senate. Now,<br />
he is making it very clear that as far as he is concerned there are no<br />
rules any more about a States House, disruptive to the point of<br />

refusing the passage of major budgetary measures, the financial<br />
legislation of the peoples' House, the House of Representatives.<br />
J: the fact is that the Labor Party has blocked the financial Bills in the<br />
Senate, is that not right?<br />
PM: I have had the Opposition and the Democrats stand up legislation I<br />
piloted through the Parliament as Treasurer time after time after time,<br />
on capital gains tax, on fringe benefits tax, on the abolition of<br />
entertainment as a deduction, one thing after another. And those<br />
things were dealt with in the spirit in a sense that one can never get<br />
complete unanimity of opinion from a Senate. But again, there is a line<br />
beyond which Oppositions don't go. In 1981 a measure of $ 132 million<br />
was refused, $ 132 million compared to $ 3 billion. This is the refusal of<br />
major revenue measures of a. Budget. So let's not for a second try and<br />
diminish what John Hewson is up to. He is in about standing the<br />
conventions of Australian public life on their head. He is into the<br />
conventions I said yesterday with a pick axe.<br />
J: You, by walking out of Question Time, by closing Question Time and<br />
walking out, made your behaviour the issue, rather than the<br />
Oppositions.<br />
PM: I don't think so. By what warped basis of observation would that be<br />
so'? When the place was in mayhem on the Opposition side. Let me<br />
just tell you about conventions. The number of question days<br />
cancelled by the former Government in 1976, for six days, 1977, 7<br />
days, 1978, 7 days, 1979, 5 days, 1980, 1 day, 1981, 4 days, 1982, 7<br />
days. This is not our record. I have seen the Opposition come in,<br />
move censures of Labor Members, to through the night, suspend the<br />
following days Question Time and keep on going. I have been here<br />
long enough to see these things. I remember all these days when the<br />
Opposition, which I served in, was given no Question Time. This was<br />
not our intention, they had a Question Time today which they had<br />
connived in disrupting. And there is no point in Ministers seeking to try<br />
and give an answer with a barrage of hostile abuse coming our way.<br />
And if that is not apparent to you, I think you ought to sharpen your<br />
powers of observation.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, it is only recently, dare I have the temerity to say, that there is a<br />
bit of focus on the fact that the Opposition is seeking to refuse the<br />
passage of the Budget in the Senate. This has moment, doesn't it? It<br />
has moment, and the points I made today which Sir Robert Menzies<br />
made on that occasion in 1968 were, I thought, pretty much to the<br />
point.<br />
J: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Uct. Y. 5 17: 32 No.<br />
4<br />
PM: Well, again, Ministers have got to give the answers, they are the ones<br />
who have got to try and give the answers in the face of this barrage.<br />
And it may well be that when you are standing looking at this it is not<br />
quite like being there. That is, that trying to keep the structure of an<br />
answer in ones mind and deliver it while this hostility is coming your<br />
way is very difficult indeed.<br />
J-So is Speaker Martin failing to do his job properly?<br />
PM:. He would have had to have dealt with the whole front bench, as it turns<br />
out, to have been able to do that. And of course, that was untenable<br />
for him. They made Question Time today untenable.<br />
J: Is Speaker Martin failing to do his job effectively?<br />
PM: No. The parties in the Parliament have got to comply with the<br />
conventions and decencies in place.<br />
J: You invited Speaker Martin to turn some of them out though?<br />
PM: Because I don't believe that someone should be able to walk up to<br />
take a point of order and then shout. Take a point of order which we<br />
know Is frivolous and has no basis to it, the Leader of the National<br />
Party standing up getting the privilege of a point of order and then<br />
taking a political point. If that sort of tactic continues the way to deal<br />
with them is basically suspend them. But be that as it may, no one<br />
was suspended, but the Opposition decided that they would disrupt the<br />
place anyway. So, they made the Question period untenable.<br />
J. Would you put Question Time off again if they behaved in the same<br />
way?<br />
PM-Of course.<br />
J: Mr Keating, after the Budget when you refused to attend Dr Hewson's<br />
address in reply, the issue to many people in the community became<br />
the fact that you didn't go to his address in reply rather than what he<br />
actually had to say. Aren't you doing the same thing here, you are<br />
making<br />
PM:. Listen, look, get orders of magnitude about you please. This is a man<br />
who connived in the passage of changes in the Senate so that the<br />
Chamber he actually occupies, the peoples house the House of<br />
Representatives cannot pass legislation after the end of October. In<br />
other words, he Is party to the disruption of the smooth passage and<br />
work of the House of Representatives in the Senate. He has joined<br />
with Opposition and Green Senators to pass those procedural motions.<br />

them asunder that is, disenfranchise the place from doing its<br />
business and then call upon the conventions and expect, in my case,<br />
the Prime Minister to turn up on time and obey all the conventions and<br />
at the other time receive another abusive reply.<br />
You see, Dr Hewson broke the conventions in 1992 of giving an offthe-<br />
cuff abusive Budget reply. It didn't go to the issues, it was simply a<br />
political statement for which he got a lot of kudos in the media. It was<br />
probably on that occasion, at about that time, I decided that there was<br />
no way we would let him maintain himself as a viable Opposition<br />
leader. Can I say I was not about turning up for a repeat of that. The<br />
Government's Budget was delivered analytically, courteously and to be<br />
standing there to take three quarters of an hour of public abuse from a<br />
person who has put asunder the imperatives of the House of<br />
Representatives and its prerogatives in motions of the previous week<br />
in the Senate was basically not to be encouraged.<br />
J: creating an impression that you can dish it out, but not take it?<br />
PM,. Look, I don't think anyone in the great public out there of Australia<br />
thinks I can't dish it out and take it. This is nothing about taking it.<br />
This is about the right of people to have questions asked and to be<br />
heard, Ministers to be heard, and to be able to reply.<br />
J: Mr Keating, before trying to mount the case as you have been doing<br />
aggressively over the last few days, trying to draw attention to what the<br />
Opposition is doing in the Senate, aren't you just distracting people by<br />
your actions today?<br />
PM. No, because what was the action about? I mean what was the<br />
cacophony of noise about? It was the point of objection raised<br />
principally against me about the rights of the House of Representatives<br />
and the government that commands a majority in it to pass its financial<br />
legislation and not for a States House to refuse the passage. Just<br />
remember what is happening here. It is not a review, it is not a<br />
tinkering at the edge, it is the refusal of the passage of major<br />
budgetary measures. Dr Hewson has got to explain how he believes<br />
he can present himself again ii a prospective Prime Minister and<br />
leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives while<br />
expecting, after having disrupted or sought to disrupt this<br />
Government's Budget, expecting the passage of a Coalition<br />
government's financial legislation. What you are seeing here is the<br />
tearing up of nearly a century old convention.<br />
J: part of it at least of what happened today is simply frustration on the<br />
part of the Opposition in having to listen to you abuse them for fifteen<br />
minutes. T5EL.: Oct. 93 17: 32 No. 019 P. 05/ 08 </p>
<p>TEL: 6<br />
PM: I didn't abuse them.<br />
J: Are you saying that in the same circumstances, if the boot was on the<br />
other foot, that the Labor party wouldn't react the same way?<br />
PMV: I don't regard quoting from an article specifically written to the subject<br />
by Sir Robert Menzies as in any way abuse. I reject that term<br />
absolutely. They were not prepared to hear from the founder of their<br />
party such things as he said a Senate Opposition whose party had<br />
been completely defeated at a general election would be in command<br />
of the government of the nation. This would be absurd as a denial of<br />
popular democracy. Inconvenient for John Hewson may be, but<br />
certainly I have got every right as the leader of the Government to<br />
defend not just the Budget, but the conventions.<br />
J: And you don't think that if the Opposition were to quote Chifley at you<br />
for fifteen minutes, that you mightn't get a bit restive too?<br />
PM;-Look, we all quote who we like at each other in this period, but there is<br />
not case you can't make out any case, any respectable case for<br />
Opposition induced mayhem and that is what we saw today.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what is the difference in principle between the Coalition's<br />
decision to try and block that 1.5 per cent of revenues this year and<br />
Labor's decision in 1981 to try and block about 1.4 per cent of<br />
revenues. What is the difference in principle between those two?<br />
PM:. The difference In principle is and I dispute your figures, the difference<br />
in principle is that at no stage did a Labor opposition seek to put<br />
asunder a governments budget. That is what is happening here.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM;-Well, do I look under pressure. Even for a navel gazer like you I<br />
wouldn't of thought I looked under pressure.<br />
J Mr Willis said in Sydney this morning that the investment community<br />
was getting increasingly concerned about the Budget's passage<br />
through Parliament and the state of government generally. How do<br />
you think they will feel this afternoon?<br />
PM: Who said this?<br />
J: Mr Willis, this morning.<br />
PM: 1 He told me that he had a number of questions in New York about the<br />
passage of the Government's Budget that people were worried about<br />
it, they saw it as something like a hiatus, something of the United<br />

States variety. The very point Malcolm Fraser made last week. Look,<br />
there is a real debate here, there is a real decision being made by the<br />
Opposition spiting and smarting under the fact that they lost the last<br />
election to try and wreck the Government's Budget. You have got a<br />
number of conservative people on the conservative side of politics<br />
calling the tactic into question, saying it is unwise primarily Malcolm<br />
Fraser, a former leader of seven years standing as Prime Minister; the<br />
leader of the National Farmers' Federation, a large rural conservative<br />
lobby; Senator Vanstone amongst others and more recently<br />
conservative commentators and a number of editorial writers. This is a<br />
real matter and the notion that it can not be debated in the House of<br />
Representatives without a cacophony of noise and abuse or for it to be<br />
debated is somehow illegitimate is of course, very strange indeed.<br />
J: How would depriving them of Question Time force them to toe the line?<br />
PM: It is not a matter of depriving them of Question Time, it is simply that<br />
there is no point in completing a Question Time with that kind of<br />
mayhem.<br />
J: Well, wthat is an appropriate level..<br />
PM. What is the point of Question lime? It's to give answers and provide<br />
Information and have debate. If in the end it is just disruption and<br />
noise, what is the point?<br />
J: What is an appropriate level of noise for the future then?<br />
PM: That which is not disruptive of the capacity of Question lime to fulfil<br />
that section of the standing orders.<br />
J decide it on the spur?<br />
PM: No, no the Leader of the House and I discussed this in the past and<br />
discussed it again today.<br />
J: Have you spoken to the Speaker?<br />
PM. No, I haven't.<br />
J: If Mr Martin can't control the House, should he be replaced as<br />
Speaker?<br />
PM: You are making the point about not controlling the House. No Speaker<br />
can control the Parliament when one side of the Parliament is set upon<br />
such a course of disruption.<br />
J: Do you think he should name Mr Fischer or Mr Tuckey.. T5EL.: Oct. 93 17: 32 No. 019 P. 07/ 08 </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Oct. 93 17: 32 N6.019 P. 08/ 08<br />
PM: I believe that paints of order which have no point to them and in the<br />
end are disruptive of continuity, if they are persisted with should be<br />
dealt with. I have made that position clear over the years<br />
J: But it is not actually up to you to run the H-ouse is it, it is up to the<br />
Speaker? If he can't control it..<br />
PM: No, but it is up to me to say whether Ministers wish to battle the noise<br />
to try and get an answer out. In the end, after all, Question Time has<br />
to work.<br />
J: discuss this with Mr Beazley prior to Question Time today did you?<br />
PM: No, no at other times. Sometime ago and on the spur of the moment<br />
today.<br />
J: Have you told Steve Martin he has got to be tougher?<br />
PM. No, I haven't spoken to the Speaker. But no Speaker can reasonably<br />
deal with that kind of tactic it is disruptive, but the disruption all<br />
comes from one place a failure to accept the last election result,<br />
smarting over the result, an unwillingness to look at the cause ot the<br />
Liberal and National Parties defeat and now wrecking and stalling<br />
tactics between the House and the Senate and of course, the putting<br />
asunder of the Government's Budget in the States House, at the hands<br />
of the Liberal and National Parties. That is at the root of the problem<br />
between the Houses and today's Question rime.<br />
