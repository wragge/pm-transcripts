PRIME MINISTER 45/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
MOUNT BARKER ROAD AND ADELAIDE AIRPORT<br />
I am -pleased to announce today that the Commonwealth Government will<br />
undertake in South Austraia two major iftasfructure projedts, the Mount Barker<br />
Road and the extension of Adelade airport<br />
The Commonwealth will build an 8.3 kilometre divided freeway, including a sbx<br />
lane tunnel, to replace the present 10.4 Idlorreftes of steep and winding<br />
undivided road on Mount Barker the gateway to Adelaide on the Adelaide-<br />
Melbourne National Transport Corridor.<br />
The project~ the estimated cost of which is $ 130 miullion, will be funded from the<br />
Commonwealths National Highway program. Planning and land auisition will<br />
begi immediately and construction will commence as soon as this process is<br />
complete-The freeway will make a significant conitribution to safet and will reduce travel<br />
time for both heavy vehkies and commuters.<br />
The Commonwealth w. 4ll also immediatey commission design work and undertake<br />
any necessay environmental shzdies; to finslise plans to the extension of<br />
Adelaide airporL<br />
The Comnmonwealth will fund any shortfal between the South Australian<br />
governmenes already declaed commiet of $ 20 million and the cost of the<br />
extension., Constructin of the extension will proceed ahead of the leasing of<br />
Adelaide airport. The South Austfwia government wigl have the opportunity to<br />
recoup their investmnt through the proceeds of the airport when it is [ eased.<br />
Taken together, these projects represent two of the most important infrastructure<br />
works undertaken anywhere in the Commonwealth.<br />
