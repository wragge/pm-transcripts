STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION FOUNDATION<br />
( AIEF) FELLOWSHIP<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government has established an<br />
Australian International Education Foundation ( AIEF) Fellowship, for doctoral<br />
research by a Japanese scholar at an Australian tertiary institution.<br />
The prestigious new award will provide $ 150,000 over three years for<br />
doctoral research. Awards will alternate between the categories of science<br />
and technology, and economics and business management.<br />
The fellowship is designed to build on our long-standing and extensive<br />
education links with Japan.<br />
At post-secondary level and above more than 4,000 Japanese are currently<br />
studying full-time in Australia.<br />
The Australian International Education Foundation and the Department of<br />
Employment, Education and Training will jointly administer the award. AIEF<br />
is a government-industry partnership which promotes and markets Australia's<br />
international education and training services.<br />
