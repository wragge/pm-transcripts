VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
S[ NGAPORE<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton,<br />
at Banquet given by Mr. Lee Kuan Yew JUNE 1968<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Lee, Distinguished Guests Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen: May I start, Sir, by thanking you for the honour which you;<br />
do my country today, through me, by extending this State banquet to us.'<br />
It is an honour the more appreciated because we feel, as later I shall take<br />
more time to explain, that you are an example to the area of the world in<br />
which you live and that you, and we together, may perhaps with the other<br />
countries in the region, if they follow this example, bring not only to you,<br />
not only to us, but to all of us in this region a stability you want, an<br />
opportunity for. progress you want and we want, and by doing so contribute<br />
more than we can contribute in any other way to the peaceful progress of<br />
all of the nations so close and so neighbourly around here.<br />
This is not the first time that I have been in Singapore. Indeed,<br />
it is not the second, third or fourth time. But on the first timeJ. was here,<br />
things were not so peaceful here as they are now. Because on that occasion Si<br />
Singapore was under attack, was under threat of conquest, and indeed, was<br />
subjected to aggression. And those of you in this room who lived through<br />
that period of time, will know what this meant to individuals in Singapore.<br />
And will know what it meant to the opportunity given to individuals or rather<br />
denied to individuals in Singapore to be the arbiters of their own destiny,<br />
to be the deciders of their own fate.<br />
One of the objectives which we must seek in the whole of this<br />
region and by this region I mean not only Malays, Sin gapore, Indonesia,<br />
Australia or New Zealand but other countries including Vietnam.. one<br />
of the objectives we must seek is to see that that kind of aggression does<br />
not succeed in denying to the citizens of any particular area the right to be<br />
arbiters of their own destiny. And that this is of as much importance to us<br />
in Australia as it is to you, let me illustrate, by saying this.. a little less<br />
than a week ago I was in Darwin, one of our northernmost Australian cities,<br />
and as I stood there, I was closer to Saigon, and was closer to Singapore,<br />
than I was to the southern regions of Australia in Hobart, in Tasmania. There<br />
are no longer these great geographical divisions there used to be. There are<br />
no longer these great differences in time and in travel that there used to be.<br />
We are getting closer and closer together in point of time; we are getting, I<br />
hope, closer and closer together in point of understanding. / 2 </p>
<p>You spoke, Sir, of expecting from Australians a hard-headed<br />
appreciation of where Australian interests lie. I think it is natural and right<br />
that this should be so, for the first duty of any government of any nation is to<br />
look after and to advance the interests of those people whom that government<br />
governs. You, I think, have the same approach. But this doesn't mean that<br />
either country, ours, or yours, or any other country in the region can be<br />
unconcerned with the interests of the neighbouring countries, because that<br />
very hard-headed appreciation of which you spoke must lead one to the<br />
conclusion that the ultimate interests of any country in a region can only<br />
properly and fully be served if the progress, the stability, the economic<br />
viability of the neighbouring countries are also served. For otherwise, there<br />
is always a potential threat.<br />
The future of this region, as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, is<br />
likely to be shaped by the answers, as yet unknown, to the questions which you<br />
posed. Some of them will be answered relatively soon; some of them will<br />
take a longer time to answer. But some of them are at this very moment being<br />
hammered out, or at least the initial steps to hammer them out are being taken,<br />
at the Five-Power talks occurring in Kuala Lumpur; Five-Power talks which<br />
are, as I suspect, only the precursors of discussions between the Five Powers,<br />
but which are at least starting now and which regarding what you have said from<br />
a purely military standpoint, are the beginning of trying to get the answers to<br />
some of the imponderables which you have posed to us. And I think I should<br />
say no more on that, than that these talks are progressing and that as the<br />
answers come from them so the future course of events is the more likely to<br />
be properly assessed. But stability won't depend merely on these kind of talks. In the<br />
long-range, stability will rather depend on the economic progress which the<br />
various governments of this region can secure for their peoples, and this, in<br />
turn, will depend on the dedication of such governments to the interests of all<br />
their peoples, not just that section which forms the governing class. It will<br />
depend also on the administrative capacity of these governments to translate<br />
their intentions into accomplishments, for only in that way will the peoples of<br />
the nations in this region feel an identification with the governments who rule<br />
their nations and swing * in behind those governments to help themselves and<br />
sacrifice and work to see that a government in which they bd ieve will bring<br />
to them the benefits that sacrifice and work will ultimately bring. That, I<br />
think, will * be the abiding basis for security and stability in this region; which<br />
is not to say, Sir, that it will be the only basis.<br />
And I say, with genuine belief as far as I am concerned, that<br />
here in this city state, perhaps the inheritor of the tradition of Venice, and<br />
perhaps a city state destined to hold longer than did Venice that leadership<br />
in this part of the world, you have provided a shining example of what a<br />
government concerned with advancement of its peoples can do. You have<br />
shown what a government which has skilled and devoted public administrators<br />
can achieve, and the loyalty and support which such a government can generate<br />
in the people it rules. / 3 </p>
<p>It fills me, Sir, with respect and envy to think that a<br />
government is able, at an election, to win every seat.. to win every seat<br />
on its record, and I have no doubt that every seat was won on your record.<br />
I think that the drive, the energy, the hard work, the initiative which you<br />
have shown, the realization you have shown of the possibilities inherent in a<br />
private enterprise system damped down by government to see it doesn't<br />
become an exploited system, guided by government to see that its energies<br />
are pulled into channels which are designed for the public good, but not<br />
overseen in every detail of its work by government and by bureaucrats<br />
have achieved what this city state has, in fact, achieved.<br />
I hope that this example which I have called a shining example<br />
will be able to be emulated by all the countries in this region, because I am<br />
sure that ifit is, then the worries one has of subversion, of terrorism, Qf<br />
infiltration will be so minimal that they will not any longer pose a significant<br />
threat. And because if it is, then I feel that the other major threat that might<br />
hang over the region, that of an organized invasion, would run so counter to<br />
world opinion that it would have no chance of achieving what it set out to do.<br />
So these are the abiding things on which the stability and security and progress<br />
and prosperity of this region must be built.<br />
Of course going along with them, especially in the initial stages,<br />
must be some significant capacity to reinforce * what one is doing with the<br />
military arm. But, Prime Minister, I know that you and I have the same<br />
ultimate goal, the same ideal of what might be achieved, and I know that you<br />
and I both realize the inherent difficulties which w ill need to be overcome and<br />
the slow progress which will necessarily be made, because these new worlds<br />
cannot, be built and varnished and brought. new into being in a day..<br />
But knowing this, I assure you, Sir, of this: we stand ready,<br />
in my own country, to endeavour to play our part in a co-operative enterprise<br />
with you to bring about what I believe we want, and we expect, and I have no<br />
doubt that we will get. And just as you have pointed out that we have reached<br />
the stage now in history as a result of hard work and endeavour over 200 years,<br />
and have in front of us the future because we must look to that and not to the<br />
past so I believe if you and we and the other nations of this region can achieve<br />
this administrative capacity, can use aid from whatever source it comes and<br />
see that it is used to the utmost benefit of all the people and is not wasted, then<br />
those 200 years of which you spoke are but a prelude.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, I am reminded of this saying: " All of<br />
the pas * t is prelude", which has been irreverently translated as meaning, " You<br />
ain't seen nothing yet". Really, I think this is true, be cause casting one's<br />
mind forward, and we can only do it for ten years, for a decade, but tryirg to<br />
cast it forward further still it is possible to envisage here, not in Singapore,<br />
here in this region, in Australia, in New Zealand, in Singapore, in Indonesia,<br />
in Malaysia and in bordering countries, a technological base, and education<br />
and administrative capacity, which will enable each to develop and advance in<br />
peace and in progress. / 4 </p>
<p>That, Sir, I think, you and I would seek to see achieved and<br />
that, Sir, while * we each hold our respective positions, we will work to see<br />
achieved. I hope that not only will my wife and I return here to see you, but<br />
that you will come to see us, for the invitation for you and your wife, Sir,<br />
stands open for as long as you are the Prime Minister of Singapore, and a<br />
private invitation stands open if you ever cease to be Prime Minister.<br />
Thank you.<br />
I, </p>
