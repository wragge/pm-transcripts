FOR PRESS PM No. 102/ 1970<br />
MR WHITLAM'S ATTITUDE ON VIETNAM<br />
Tv-TD7<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr Whitlam's statement that there is no military<br />
rationale for the presence of Australian troops in Vietnam is<br />
illogical and endangers the chances of success of the President's<br />
peace efforts. The rationale for an Australian military presence<br />
is that it is necessary to have a military presence until a settlement<br />
giving self-determination to South Vietnam is achieved.<br />
A withdrawal of all Allied troops now, merely<br />
because an offer of negotiations has been made ( and not yet<br />
accepted) would be the equivalent of capitulation, an abandonment<br />
of the object of securing self-determination for South Vietnam,<br />
and an encouragement to the North Vietnamese to refuse to enter<br />
into negotiations. A unilateral withdrawal of Australian troops would<br />
have a similar effect and would in addition be an abandonment of<br />
our Allies and of the people of South Vietnam.<br />
