<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>How are you Mr Howard? Good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm very well.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, we were talking this morning about the preamble and I was</p>
<p> saying to Pilko that I was amazed at the objection to using Âmateship'.</p>
<p> My argument is that mateship is one of those characteristics and qualities</p>
<p> that is near and dear to the heart of every Australian male or female.</p>
<p> And I cannot for the life of me believe these people who are going</p>
<p> on about it. What was your reaction?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well my reaction's exactly the same. It is not, whatever its</p>
<p> origins, it is not now an exclusively male concept or term. It describes</p>
<p> looking after our mates, our friends, our fellow Australians in adversity.</p>
<p> It conjures up all of the egalitarian spirit which is distinctive</p>
<p> of Australians. It not only recalls the fact that Australian soldiers</p>
<p> in captivity survived better in prisoner of war camps than many others</p>
<p> because they helped each other, but it also reminds us that when we</p>
<p> have a disaster, we have a bush fire, we have a landslide which buries</p>
<p> a ski lodge we will get together and help each other.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, this might be a silly question. Do we need to have a preamble</p>
<p> to a Constitution?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it would be good if only because the existing document makes</p>
<p> absolutely no reference at all to the indigenous people. None at all.</p>
<p> And the existing preamble which is really part of the British act</p>
<p> of Parliament which established the Australian Constitution, whilst</p>
<p> appropriate for the time, makes no reference to Aborigines, it makes</p>
<p> no reference to the contemporary values of the Australian community</p>
<p> and it plainly...we do in those circumstances need a new preamble.</p>
<p> Now some people will argue not of course. And if they feel that way</p>
<p> they can vote Âno'. It's a free country.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>That's exactly right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But if you're going to write a preamble you've got to try</p>
<p> and say something about what the country believes in and stands for</p>
<p> and I do believe that the objection to mateship is just so petty and</p>
<p> narrowly based, and also misunderstands the mood and temper of Australians.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, was there any consideration given to sitting down</p>
<p> maybe with the Democrats and with perhaps Kim Beazley or somebody</p>
<p> from the Labor Party, and all parties sitting down and trying to thrash</p>
<p> out a preamble?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have sent the preamble we've drafted to Mr Beazley for</p>
<p> comment, and I've sent it to the Democrats for comment, and I've</p>
<p> asked them to send me their comments by the 30th of April.</p>
<p> It is a draft. Now plainly you can't write something like that</p>
<p> as a committee because people approach it from a different perspective.</p>
<p> And I will have a look at their comments. And I've said that.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>So you are willing to change, perhaps a few little things in it...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll see what people have got to say. If I were absolutely</p>
<p> immoveable on every word I wouldn't have described it as a draft.</p>
<p> But it is the responsibility of the Government today to sort of know</p>
<p> its own mind, and we know our own mind on this. We've put something</p>
<p> out. I'm not only interested in Mr Beazley's reaction. I'm</p>
<p> also interested in the reaction of your listeners, or the reaction</p>
<p> of Australians generally. This idea that things like this are a matter</p>
<p> of negotiation between political parties is not right. This is something</p>
<p> that belongs to the entire community. I really want to know what people</p>
<p> think about it.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Certainly right. Mr Howard, I know that obviously the words were chosen</p>
<p> with great care and that the things that you're trying to convey.</p>
<p> Have you been surprised that people have literally sat down with a</p>
<p> microscope and a scalpel and said, because I read the, who was it,</p>
<p> the Premier of Tassie had a go at you for talking about, what was</p>
<p> the....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Our vast island continent.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Our vast island continent. I thought well we all know that includes</p>
<p> the whole country.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course I do. No, that doesn't surprise me at all because people,</p>
<p> what people do is they, people like Premiers and people who sort of</p>
<p> have a particular axe to grind will look at it from that kind of political</p>
<p> vantage point rather than thinking how an average Australian would</p>
<p> relate. Now the average Australian, whether that person lives in South</p>
<p> Australia or Tasmania, when you say our vast island continent they</p>
<p> know you are referring to the whole country.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you've got to be careful though that the Tasmanian</p>
<p> Premier doesn't get to Brian Harradine.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've sent the, you know, Brian Harradine will no doubt let</p>
<p> me know his views. I would imagine that Brian would understand that</p>
<p> when you say "our vast island continent", that is what you</p>
<p> are referring to. You are referring to the whole place. But once again</p>
<p> I'll be interested to see what the people in Tasmania think.</p>
<p> I'll be interested to know what your listeners are thinking and</p>
<p> what listeners to other stations and in other States are thinking.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, at Cabinet level was there much discussion about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There was a bit. These are things that everybody really has a view</p>
<p> on and every view is different. Your style of expression is different</p>
<p> from mine. Mine is different in turn from that of some of my colleagues.</p>
<p> And you can say in a thousand different ways the same thing, and you</p>
<p> can commit yourself to the same set of values in a thousand different</p>
<p> ways. One of the things I was anxious to do was to have it not sound</p>
<p> like preambles normally sound. And what amazes me about the reaction</p>
<p> of some people in the Labor Party is that they've immediately</p>
<p> sort of run off to the American Constitution and said because it doesn't</p>
<p> sound like that it's no good. I mean we really have to be a little</p>
<p> less derivative and be a little less dependent and understand that</p>
<p> we're writing something for the Australian people. Not for Americans,</p>
<p> or Englishmen, or anybody else. We're writing something for the</p>
<p> Australian people which should express in the language of the time,</p>
<p> the values of the time, but in a way that recognises our history and</p>
<p> also allows for the possibility that it will still be relevant in</p>
<p> 50 or 100 years time. But, I mean, what the American Constitution</p>
<p> talks about we the people in a more perfect union and so forth. Now</p>
<p> that was nice then. It was appropriate for them. Surely we can have</p>
<p> something of our own.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I mean I must say, if nothing else it has turned our</p>
<p> eyes towards the Constitution. I've never read the preamble of</p>
<p> our Constitution as it stands and at least, if nothing else we've</p>
<p> now got a community of the nation actually debating what we do want.</p>
<p> I appreciate your time. We know we dragged you out of a meeting. But</p>
<p> thank you for taking some time to speak with us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
