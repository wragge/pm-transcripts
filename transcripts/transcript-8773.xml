I PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 DECEMBER 1992<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE HON ROSS FREE, MINISTER ASSISTING<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
The third and final selection round for the Cooperative<br />
Research Cgptres. Program was completed today, with the<br />
selection of a further seventeen Centres, the expansion of<br />
two CRCs established in 1991, and the establishment of a<br />
Research Data Network CRC ( RDN-CRC).<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the Minister Assisting<br />
the Prime Minister, Mr Free, said that the Centres<br />
announced today will make a substantial contribution to<br />
the international competitiveness of our industries and<br />
will provide strong support for the sustainable<br />
development of Australia's resources.<br />
A list of the Centres announced today, together with the<br />
existing 34 CRCs is attached. Details of each new Centre<br />
are also attached.<br />
The new Centres and the extensions to two existing CRCs<br />
will enhance Australia'~ s R&amp; D capabilities in a broad range<br />
of areas, including manufacturing technologies;<br />
information and communications technology; exploration,<br />
mining and energy generation; sustainable production and<br />
processing of agricultural products; environmental<br />
management; and vaccine technology.<br />
All States and Territories, together with important<br />
regions such as North Queensland, are represented.<br />
Total resources available to the new and extended Centres<br />
will amount to S872 million over the initial contract<br />
period. The CRC Program will provide some $ 254 million<br />
dollars. The remaining S618 million will be contributed by<br />
business enterprises ($ 170 million), universities ($ 183<br />
million), Commonwealth departments ayid agencies including<br />
CSIRO ($ 178 million), State departments and agencies<br />
million) and medical research institutes million). 4901 </p>
<p>The Government is pleased with the substantial involvement<br />
by all participants. In particular it is delighted at the<br />
further Increase in industrial commitment to the program.<br />
Some 284 of participant funding is from business<br />
enterprises, up froM 17% in Round 1 and 21% in Round 2.<br />
The industry commitment is unique in the international<br />
context. Even the German Fraunhofer Institutes, often<br />
cited as the example of good industry/ public sector<br />
collaboration in research and development, cannot match<br />
the Australian CRCs regarding the long term nature and<br />
relative size of industry's commitment.<br />
As announced in the Government' s recent White Paper on<br />
. Science and Technology, " Develop# in-AustralianIdeas", a<br />
Research Data Network CRC i s . to be estab; lished. f-rYwill<br />
conduct research into telecommunications and computing<br />
technologies and-services, and have access to<br />
experimental broadband facilities essential for the<br />
development of the next generation communications<br />
networks. The Centre's research nodes are located in Brisbane,<br />
Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. The CRC for<br />
Broadband Telecommunications and Networking announced<br />
today is also expected to collaborate in these<br />
developments, thus adding a node in Perth to the network.<br />
The Research Data Network CRC will also provide $ 3.4<br />
million for the immediate upgrade of the existing<br />
research data network, which links up researchers<br />
( including universities) throughout Australia.<br />
This initiative will address one of the major needs for<br />
r esearch -* infrastructure identified by the Australian<br />
Science and Technology Council in its report on national<br />
research facilities. The importance of the establishment<br />
of a high speed data network-for innovative R&amp; D in<br />
advanced systems -engineering, computing software and<br />
telecommunications, for use by researchers, was<br />
recommended by an expert group to the Prime minister's<br />
Science and Engineering Council earlier this year.<br />
The Prime Minister and Mr Free thanked * Professor Slatyer,<br />
Chair of the Cooperative Research Centres Committee, and<br />
all members of that Committee and the two Expert Panels<br />
for the competent and objective advice provided to them<br />
since the establishment of the Program.<br />

Research Data Network CRC<br />
The Research Data Network ( RDN) CRC will conduct research and education<br />
programs in areas relating to communications network technologies, applications and<br />
services. It will also support network infratructure development, including the<br />
upgrade of the Australian Academic and Research Network, AARNet.<br />
The CRC will be established as a network of nodes, some of which are associated with<br />
other CRCs, with a Management Committee to foster cooperation between the<br />
different groups, to oversee the funding and reporting requirements of the CRC, and to<br />
manage access and connections to experimental broadband network capacity.<br />
Participants<br />
The participants in the research programs include: the CRC for Advanced<br />
Computational Systems; the CRC for Distributed Systems Technology; CSIRO<br />
Macquarie Joint Research Centre for Advanced Systems Engineering; the Department<br />
of Parliamentary Reporting Staff; the South Australian Centre for Parallel Computing;<br />
Microsoft Institute; Thinking Machines Corporation; Australian Supercomputing<br />
Technology; Softway; Film Australia; CSIRO Division of Information Technology;<br />
Fujitsu Australia; AOTC; Siemens; and the Australian Computing and<br />
Communications Institute ( ACCI). ( Not all participants are involved in every research<br />
program). In addition, the Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee and AOTC are expected to<br />
participate in the Management Committee in connection with their role as network<br />
service providers.<br />
Research Activities<br />
There are four research programs:<br />
The Distributed Interactive Multimedia Information Services program and the<br />
Distributed High Performance Computing program will be established as<br />
Demonstration Projects of the CRC for Advanced Computational Systems. The<br />
Multimedia program will focus on systems architecture, tools and techniques for<br />
interactive multimedia access and navigation. This is an area which is of major<br />
importance for future broadband networks. The High Performance Computing<br />
program will integrate the high performance computing resources of Australia through<br />
broadband connections ( as seen in the embryonic national cooperative supercomputer<br />
facility), and the management of data on the distributed computer network.<br />
The Resource Discovery program will be established as an * additional program of the<br />
CRC for Distributed Systems Technology. The program aims to develop resource<br />
discovery prototypes that enable users to access the vast amounts of information<br />
scattered in repositories throughout Australia and the rest of the world. 4191, </p>
<p>The Nenwrk Performance program will involve research and development into the<br />
utilisation and performance of high speed telecommunications network technologies<br />
such as frame relay, DQDB and AI. This will assist in the design of the future<br />
AARNet. These four programs will enable an integrated approach to the solving of some<br />
important problems, as networks are faced with increasing demands in relation to<br />
capacity and services.<br />
Network Inbrastructure Development<br />
Funding will be provided for an immediate upgrade of the existing research data<br />
network, AAR1~ et, and to assist meeting the projected cost of providing upgraded<br />
services over the next few years.<br />
Funding will also be provided to the RDN CRC to fund access to broadband facilities<br />
such as the proposed AOTC Experimental Broadband Network, at some 10 sites. This<br />
reflects the fact that each of the recommended proposals will investigate technologies<br />
and applications which will require access to broadband testbed facilities beyond those<br />
available at present. ' This will make a significant contribution to the development of<br />
the next generation of network applications and services.<br />

Corporation, Australia.<br />
Research Focus<br />
The Centre will focus on the structural and dynamic processes ( the geodynamics) within<br />
the Earth's crust, particularly on the tectonic evolution of sedimentary basins and<br />
crystalline terrains within Australia. It will involve integration of continental-scale<br />
structural geology, geochronology, reflection seismology and 3D tomography as tools for<br />
determining the structural architecture of the crust, the timing of major tectonic events<br />
and the processes involved in the accumulation of ' world class' mineral end energ<br />
deposits. It will also involve the application of non-linear dynamics to geological<br />
processes and advanced computing systems for 3D visualisation and geological<br />
modelling. The outcome of this research will be a vastly enhanced capacity for<br />
Australia's exploration and mining companies to explore for orebodies and energy<br />
deposits. It will also aid in differentiating between areas of high~ and low economic<br />
potential as a basis for rational decision making in regard to multiple land use.<br />

and Technology, University of New South Wales; Wool Research and Development<br />
Corporation. Research Focus<br />
The goal of the CRC is to improve the quality and competitive position of Australian wool<br />
in the world textile fibre market. The programs are: Genetic Technologies to Improve<br />
Wool and Fabric Quality; ( ii) Reducing Wool Tenderness; ( iii) Fibre Structure and<br />
Follicle Function; and ( iv) Education.<br />
The Wool and Fabric Quality program will develop genetic technologies which enable<br />
manipulation of important determninants of textile fibre quality, especially fibre diameter<br />
and at the same time maintain or enhance other economically important aspects of<br />
productivity. The Wool Tenderness program will develop new technologies that increase<br />
tensile strength of wool especially in mediterranean environments where there are<br />
dramatic seasonal variations in feed quality and quantity. The Fibre Structure and Follicle<br />
Function program is comprised of strategic research projects concerned with modifying<br />
follicle function by genetic engineering, with monitoring effects of fibre growth changes<br />
on the composition and structure of the fibre and with determining effects of variation in<br />
these traits on processing performance. Underpinning the three research programs is a<br />
highly innovative education and technology transfer program designed to meet the<br />
requirements of all sectors of the wool industry.<br />

Research Focus<br />
The aim of the Centre is to develop and implement sustainable cropping systems for the<br />
Australian Cotton industry through four programs: Resource protection; ( ii) Crop<br />
protection; ( iii) Product development; and ( iv) Education.<br />
The program protecting the resource base and environment aims to determine the fate of<br />
pesticides and develop strategies to minimise contamination of soil and water. Additional<br />
research to improve soil structure, soil fertility and water use efficiency will be done. Thie<br />
crop protection program aims to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides by utilising<br />
host plant resistance, biological control and biological pesticides. Ecological studies of<br />
insects, weeds and diseases will also aid in the derivation of alternative crop protection<br />
measures. The product development program will continue to improve yield and crop<br />
adaptability through traditional breeding along with an increasing emphasis on genetic<br />
engineering for disease and pest tolerance. Increased attention will be directed towards<br />
ensuring that the fibre quality of Australian cottons meet market demands. The education<br />
program aims to transfer new management strategies to growers through demonstration<br />
experiments on farm, through decision support packages and through new courses at<br />
University on crop management, particularly for accreditation of private crop consultants.<br />
All core partners will supervise post graduate students.<br />

Research Focus<br />
The major objective is to provide a coordinated research and educational base to generate<br />
improved and novel natural food ingredients, principally through~ the use of traditional<br />
food micro organisms. Natural ingredients which will be produced will improve food<br />
flavour and texture, provide substitutes for fats, give natural colours and will improve the<br />
quality and nutritional value of stored foods. Certain ingredients, when formulated into<br />
foods will have beneficial effects on health and well-being. Development of ingredients<br />
will involve a detailed understanding of the molecular and kinetic basis of ingredient<br />
production, improvement of productivity using both genetic and physiological procedures,<br />
bio process development at laboratory and pilot scale level, ingredient recovery, food<br />
formulation, nutrient evaluation and efficacy trials. This program will lead to export<br />
growth by Australian food industries, of both ingredients and value-added food products<br />
which contain the natural ingredients.<br />

Australia Pty Ltd.<br />
Research Focus<br />
The Centre will bring together the Australian vaccine industry with basic and applied<br />
research organisations to develop generic technologies for the design and development of<br />
future vaccines; assist industry in the application of these strategies to specific medical<br />
and veterinary vaccines; and train the scientists and technologists required to strengthen<br />
Australia's vaccine industry.<br />
Vaccines are among the most cost-effective measures to protect the health of man and<br />
animals. However, while antigens from a number of organisms for which vaccines are<br />
sough~ t have been defined, it has proved difficult to induce protective immune responses<br />
using these antigens. Industry has defined specific problems which are impeding vaccine<br />
development, and to address these problems a strategic research plan containing three<br />
programs was developed. These programs are: antigen processing; ( ii) delivering and<br />
directing the immune response; and ( iii) responsiveness and maintenance of the immune<br />
response. In these programs specific vaccines will be targeted in both the human and<br />
animal fields. However, the benefits of the strategic research plan will flow to many<br />
different vaccine programs.<br />
