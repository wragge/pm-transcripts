PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR~ MEDIA TUESrAY FEBRUJARY 8 198-3<br />
BUSINESSMEN ' S BREAXFASTp BRISBAN~ E<br />
When this breakfast was first organised, I think we all<br />
thought this was going to be a normal, quiet cabinet meeting<br />
a little later today. I am meeting some people from Brisbane<br />
this morning and at lunch and again this evening, but since<br />
then events seer' to have changed a little bit. i don't really<br />
think we would have all these photographers and journalists<br />
with us in those other circumstances.<br />
We have a very serious job ahead of us, and it is well worth<br />
recalling that up until the time in which the world recession<br />
really hit Australia hard, this country was growing well.<br />
Many tens upon tens of thousands of additional jobs had<br />
been created. Our inflation rate was in good standing compared<br />
to the rest of the world, but then of course, certain t. hings<br />
happened. There iS the world recession which has rione on<br />
much longer than anyone thought, and a bit harder than anyone<br />
thought it would. As one of the great trading nations of the<br />
world, it obviously had-to have its impact on us.<br />
The drought which is affecting most of NSNW dnd most of my<br />
owrn State, and abo~ ut 60 or / 0 pt! rc ent of this State is<br />
obviously having a great impact over Australia. It can<br />
yet end up being the worst drought in the recorded history<br />
of the country. Already there are 100,000 farms, lCO milliin<br />
sheep, 14 to 18 million cattle directly affected. We have<br />
taken policies, many in support of the State governments<br />
under the core mneasures for drought relief, btit othl~ er policies<br />
because we believe it was be',' ond the financial capacity of the<br />
States which are de signed to preserve people ont their farmts<br />
and properties and to preserve Australia's essential breeding<br />
stock. Those policies I believe are affective.<br />
The drought is obviously something we need to monitor in the<br />
months and period ahead of us because its severity and the<br />
potpential damage just depends upo-, n when the rainis actually<br />
come. As each month goes by, the whole situation bDecomes<br />
more serious.<br />
Then of course, Australia was also hit by wagje 2ciisions.<br />
over the last couple of yeai s which have bcenn enurmously<br />
damaging. Wage. decisions whichn led to increase-T of 15 to<br />
percnnt mny wges toether with shorter hIours at a time<br />
when our competitors over'^ 3ezk weree: p iec. Ywacaju mr;<br />
of 5 or-6 percent._ So our indu. st rires bcc--an LO bcm n n) t. L<br />
and in onie set of 1r( utries al( no, in " he' mctal tradetu,<br />
unemployment increcisd by 13,000. A sic. nificarit 1-arL of the--</p>
<p>I<br />
unemployment was the inevitable result of the wages pressure<br />
that had been put in place, the inevitable result of the<br />
wages policy that was in place in the ACTU in 1979 when<br />
Mr Hawke was president of the ACTU because it was that policy<br />
which gave the impetus to the union pressure over the last<br />
2 to 3 years.<br />
Now many people arg reaping the whirlwind and many Australians,<br />
many young Australians, are finding it difficult or impossible<br />
togt jobs as a consequence. Against this total background,<br />
it would of course be possible for a government in Australia<br />
to say it is the world recession, it is the drought and we<br />
will have to wait until these things pass. But that hasn't<br />
for one moment been the attitude of my government. We have<br />
put many policies in place, designed to assist Australians<br />
in difficulty designed to help build up the basic strength<br />
of this country at a period of difficulty, and we are not<br />
waiting for other people. We are not waiting for recovery<br />
in the United States before we take action to improve things<br />
in this country.<br />
Through the last year we acted on many fronts. We made<br />
decisions which put $ 1.2 billion into the home building<br />
or home purchasing industry, and no-. that interest rates<br />
are starting to come down, that is having an impact. I have<br />
heard in Melbourne, in Sydney and yesterday here, that there<br />
is much more activity in the home market than there has been<br />
for a very, very long while indeed. It was inevitable that<br />
once interest rates broke that many people would take<br />
advantage of the policies we have put in place. I can understand<br />
why they wouldn't do it until that happened because even if<br />
they could pay the mortgage off today, if they were concerned<br />
that rates might go up, they wouldn't know about next month<br />
or next year. But once the worst of the interests were through,<br />
then it is clear that people would be able to buy or build<br />
much greater confidence.<br />
Now, that was only one of the fronts on which we moved.<br />
We also acted to assist industry through much improved<br />
depreciation schedules, but again, that is a longish term<br />
measure, not one that can be expected to attract much<br />
immediate investment. But when our own industries do feel<br />
the confidence . to reinvest, to buy modern equipment, to put<br />
in place new technology, those new depreciation schedules<br />
are going to make it very much easier to do than would otherwise<br />
have been the case.<br />
In the last budget, we took many decisions designed to<br />
help the disadvantaged people in our own co: mr. unity, designed<br />
to help Australian families, and designed to help young puople.<br />
Many typical Australian families would be $ 17 or $ 19 better<br />
off as aresult of a combination of tax measures, improvements<br />
in family allowances and housing measures that were the<br />
result of the last budget. There are many elderly people,<br />
many disadvantage people who are much better off as a result<br />
of the last budget. I know quite well that it is common to<br />
tag that particular bud. giet as an electLion budget becauce it<br />
had some good things in it. If it hadn't thoe sort of thing<br />
in it, I ar quite sure it wouldn't have been regarded as an<br />
election budget, rather that commentators would have said that / 3 </p>
<p>-js 8 J<br />
this is a government that doesn't deserve. to Lie in governmenit<br />
because it is not sh
families and of Aiistralians at a time of recession and difficulty.<br />
It was a sensibl. e budget, it was well attuned to the circumrstanres<br />
of the time and the measures that we took especially to help<br />
Australian fa-milies are having an benleficial impact.<br />
I don't know t'lidely it is und erstood but the tax cuts<br />
through this year have a total value of $ 1.5 billion and in<br />
a full year, about $ 2.5 billion. So, the measures of the<br />
budget were substantial indeed.<br />
Now, a number of the policies in that were a direct result<br />
of consultations we had with the ACTLJ, with the Confederation<br />
of Australian Industry, and of consultations Ian Macphee<br />
and John Howard had airectly with the ACTLIJ, because we<br />
were concerned to establish the circumstances in which<br />
it would be realistic to ask for arid to require wage restraint.<br />
We believe that we d1id just that. But it became clear as last<br />
year drew to a close that something further was needed to<br />
re-establish a competitivc base for Alustralian industry arid to<br />
get a realistic relationship between wage-s and profits because<br />
wages had gone up so much and profits had fallen, to the locst<br />
level for about 20 years. Against that background, people<br />
just can't employ Australians.<br />
Therefore, the idea of the wages pause came into being.<br />
But it was a wage pause with a difference it had a very<br />
real streak of idealism in it. It was a wage pause that says<br />
the money that would be going otherwise to the Commnonwealth<br />
public servants in hig-her wages will be used directly to<br />
help other Australians. So $ 300 million has been put out<br />
for welfare housing, directly to assist through the progranmnes<br />
of the States, unempl. oyed young Australians, and older people<br />
have been retrenched as a result of the recession.<br />
The people who would have otherwise been getting the wage<br />
increase can see their dollars at work in a sensible way<br />
and in the best tCradition of Australian mateship. I think that<br />
makes it easier to point out to people iA* n private industry<br />
look; the wage pause is important. It will hielp you to keep<br />
your job. It will help keep your industry in. business. It will<br />
help to sell ~ ust. ralian goods, and as time passes, it will<br />
help and enable businesses to employ more Australians.<br />
In this election, we can say very -validly as a result of<br />
our policy of tChe wage pauzse, to all employees, vote for this<br />
governmont and you -are votling for your own job. Vote ffor the<br />
Labor Party and yo,-, i are voting to be unentployed! becaus<br />
allknow that the Labor Party is committed to hIgher wac--, Fs.<br />
Their policy cor-iits them to full cost of living adjustmen<br />
and we all know that on the basis of past history, that would<br />
be extraordinarily 6anacjing for Australian firms. We all<br />
know that tlie present pause an,' all. that business is a t( 3t1al<br />
sham for a four week period of the election.<br />
The nil indu., stry union were set. upon breaking the wage P, u se<br />
and the Lab-or Party, LinlBo%,: en, said ' of course you ha~ ve g-. D<br />
to expect them to go,-On strike we -: 11e SUpporting the strikel<br />

i. b Q, 4 I -J </p>
<p>Businessmen's breakfast, Dris<br />
in fact inciting the shutdown of Australian industry.<br />
The Government believed that it could not allow that to<br />
happen. Now they have said that the wage pause can continue until<br />
there is a conference. But when is the conference? One day,<br />
one week, ten days after an election? That of course is a sham,<br />
fabrication and something that is totally meaningless.<br />
The Labor Party is committed to that oil industry 8%.<br />
That would start a new wage round and we would be back<br />
on the same old merry-go-round once again. We need to<br />
understand that very clearly.<br />
We are doing other things which are building this country<br />
for the future. The great bicentennial road development<br />
programme is not only going to assist transport right<br />
throughout the major networks of Australia, it is also<br />
going to improve transport in capital cities and it will<br />
make a major change in the transport system of this country<br />
between now and the bicentennial year of 1988. Later this<br />
morning with Ralph Hunt I will be visiting a project which<br />
will be a very significant urban electrification of Brisbane<br />
city transport. A major part of that project funded by that<br />
programme. That again indicates our detormination to build<br />
for the future.<br />
The water resources programme which I announced with John<br />
Carrick several days ago is one which is very necessary<br />
in the present dry and sparse circumstances. This is one<br />
of the driest continents in the world but I believe we have<br />
now taken decisions which are doing to do a great deal to<br />
shoreup Australia's reserves for the future. We are also<br />
going to make sure we get the best possible examination<br />
of the age old dream of turning Australia's coastal rivers<br />
inland for better use of our scarcest resource. This again<br />
is building for the future.<br />
Again, these are things in the present circumstance, the<br />
Australian. Government needs to do. I don't say it is the<br />
end of the track in relation to that because there will<br />
be a policy speech next week and that speech will be looking<br />
very much to the future, very much to building Australia,<br />
very much to the confidence we must have in ourselves and<br />
in our capacity to do things in a difficult world.<br />
Now, this is a record of achieverment, but it is also a<br />
record of putting in place policies designed to grapple<br />
with some of the most difficult economic circumstances that<br />
any country has ever faced. I believed that that is being<br />
done effectively. That needs judging against the policies<br />
of the Australian Labor Party if they have got any policies.<br />
I asked a couple of dozen of the more intelligent members of<br />
our community in Melbourne over the last three or four days<br />
I have reversed the process. When being questioned by<br />
journalists, I asked them all a question. I asked if any of<br />
them could name a single policy of the Australian Labor Party<br />
that they have in place, that is relevant to Australia's<br />
economic problems in 1983. I got from one who is a good<br />
friend of mine a goodi political answer, but it wasn't an answer.<br />
I g: t from another that they arc going to have a conference. but'. I<br />
4 8/ 2/ 83 </p>
<p>tU/ 0 j<br />
a confer*-nlce is not a poli. c-y, iior is it a substitue for a pl'y<br />
We have coieei:-all the time with a great variety of<br />
people, but we don't erect them into a policy on which you can<br />
go to an election and seek people's support. That is nornsense.<br />
As to the rest, they couldn't think of a thing. That says<br />
great deal about the Australian Labor Party.<br />
We have had somie c~ nfusions ini recett times. Mr Kiawke, in the<br />
middle of last ytear was maKing lit plain that he didn't think<br />
much of Labor advocacy if they couldn't persuade people to<br />
adopt a capital gcins tax. But over the last periJod, he<br />
seems to have sail a few things that I would, have thought<br />
are grossly offe~ nsive Lo the Chief Commissioner of Taxation<br />
because the implication is that he is riot applying the law<br />
adequately. I would have thought that most people believe he<br />
is too vigorous in applying taxation law,; and there are many<br />
people who wished he wouldn't. But he has now had at latter<br />
day conversion and sucjgestCed that the Party is not committed<br />
to a capital gains tax. lie says somehow or other he is going<br />
to apply suich a tax through the existing law, in somne way<br />
as yet not defined. Well, it is legitimate to ask ourselves<br />
which Mr Paw.-ke ., Le believe.<br />
Then we are told there is going to be agreement about a<br />
prices incomes policy. This is going to be a fascinat'ing<br />
piece of wrapping paper when it ultinm1ate1ly does emerge,<br />
if it does emerge, because there was an attempt to have it<br />
brought to the light in the last winter. There was no<br />
agreement. There was a postponement. It was going to come<br />
out before Christmas. There was no agreement. There was a<br />
postponement. It was going to come out in the end of January,<br />
early F'ebfuary, and it was postponed again. All along<br />
Mr Hawke was of course chief negotiator as Industrial<br />
Relations spo~ esman. Now I suppose somet -hing will be provided<br />
for electoral purposes.<br />
But over the last couple of days Mr Dolan has been sayin-g<br />
there has got to be an excess profits tax. It is no good<br />
saying it doesn't matter an excess profits tax being put<br />
in ! place because there are aren't any excess profits at the<br />
moment. But if it is there, it wo.-uld obviously be v'ery damaq.-inq<br />
on business, investment, the pZrospocts of attractingj capital<br />
from overseas and the prospe-cts of having Atustritlian therselves<br />
chance their-arm in somne of the high risk propositions which<br />
are so important to the future development and strength of this<br />
country. But Mr Haw'Y. e says now is, not. the right time for it.<br />
Hie doesn't say wher, it will be, but it is interesting to<br />
note 1 think the argumient.<br />
The Labor Party ay-e qqlinq to this eloction on a slogan of<br />
brincjing At i icocl in. I would like to make<br />
the point atc ntroncgly a~ s I can that T believe that that if;<br />
sheer and utter h-umrbug. If thoy were interested in bringing<br />
Australia Locqethcr, if they w,. rre inteorested in reconcili'a-tion,<br />
they would not be pursuirng the policies that they are usig<br />
because their iolicies across a broad range are -totally and<br />
utterly 1h'ie~-ica re -bsrcr rte ~ at caid~ ctu her i<br />
for Inany Austral Iian families. </p>
<p>Busin' srnlen's Breakfast, Bris 828<br />
Let tne take one or-two examiples: We have got the wage pause<br />
in place. Douig Anthony and John Howard achieved a remarkable<br />
rest1t. when they c; ot the agreement of seven governments.<br />
It is hard enouch sometinies for the Coimmonwalth to agree<br />
with one State go%! ernment, ) b-ut to get the agreement of all<br />
eight Liberal, r.': lional Party, and three Labor State<br />
governments. N~ ow, there was a total, national political<br />
consensus for t-hat wage pause with the exception of the<br />
Federal Labor Party, with the exception of the policy in the<br />
charge of Mr 11awke. Mhere is the reconciliatiqtn in that?<br />
If you are really concerned with reconciliation, against<br />
that backgroundc, even if you didn't believe in the policy<br />
of a wage pause, there would be a commitment on you to<br />
support it because. all gjovernments had supported it.<br />
This miserable opposition seeks to break and frustrate<br />
it and incite the oil industry to bring this country to<br />
its knees.<br />
Now, that in itself makes a mocke-, ry of the slogan that they<br />
are trying to go to the people on. But we need to look at<br />
some othar policies.<br />
In education, there has been a long standing consensus in<br />
Australia, a long standing agreement that all children<br />
have a right to expec-t Somi'e governm:' ent support for the<br />
education of their children. Nov! the Labor Party would break<br />
that and says, so-' e kids will get no support at all. Again,<br />
a divisive policy.<br />
On ANZUS, the Victorian government has taken a divisive<br />
attitude trying to prevent allied ships;, American ships<br />
going into ports. 1believe with a Federal Labor government,<br />
you would find the V,. ictorian government, dominated by the<br />
Socialist left, would win its way and that would make<br />
it very difficult, if not impossible for the AN7US treaty<br />
to continue.<br />
But then you can look at other things in the tax forum<br />
that have been put there in the last year or two. If<br />
they are concerned w-ith rteconciliation, if th * ey are<br />
concerned with bri-nging this country together, why<br />
have they put intc their-platform inthe last couple of years<br />
the determination to form Australia into a republic? If ever<br />
there was a divisi ve issuo to brew a brawl around this country,<br />
that would be one. The sheer humb. ug of the Party whci a'.<br />
election times3 they put an Australian flag behind tCheir<br />
srokesran on ca;-iyiaicn mt-etings and then their spokesman<br />
says it i. q the wretched limp wrap that ought to be torn<br />
up and somethin~ g else pu-, t in its place. A firm commitment.<br />
to destroy and get rid of the Australian flag in theirplatfor-<br />
m.<br />
I make these points, an' they cire rele:-vant in this campaign<br />
because for a party? to be say-ing it is a party of reconciliation<br />
of bringing tnstaliatcethor it is the party of the most<br />
bitter divi sion tha-this3 country 1, as ever see-n.. Their policie6<br />
and the waac p-, ise the I int) c pl., tform and othfe. r<br />
policies denionstr---Iet b e1~ eve, very cleati. y indeoed.<br />
6 8/ 2/ 83 </p>
<p>There are going to be some odd polls over the next two or<br />
three weeks. I have also got no doubt that whcni, the time<br />
comes, the people of Australia are going to vote for<br />
substance, they are going to vote for a team that is<br />
working together, and they are going to vote, not just<br />
for the achievement of what this government has done,<br />
but for the policies we have in place for the policies<br />
that will be announced to take this country up and forward<br />
out of recession to build the kind of country that we all<br />
want to see. </p>
