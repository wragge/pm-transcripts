<p>The Rudd Labor Government will deliver up to $4.8 million to help to transform the Cairns central business district ahead of next year’s G20 meeting.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the Minister for Regional Australia, Catherine King, today announced the funding in Cairns as part of the Government’s continued commitment to the economic development of northern Queensland.</p>
<p>Improvements to the CBD will make public transport more efficient, and remodel the city centre to link the esplanade, convention centre, cruise liner terminal and city port.</p>
<p>This overhaul for the city centre of Cairns is well overdue.</p>
<p>The project will drive increased spending in the city centre, stimulating small business activity and local and tourist spending.</p>
<p>This in turn will generate new employment opportunities, with more than 120 jobs expected to be created in the construction phase, and ongoing employment opportunities in the revitalised retail and services sector.</p>
<p>Cairns will be in the global spotlight next year as it hosts the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ Meeting, and the funding will also allow for the creation of more green space through the city centre, as well as improving access for vehicle and pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>The Government had been working with the northern Queensland Regional Development Australia committees and stakeholders to identify priorities to support growth.</p>
<p>Infrastructure, tropical knowledge, agriculture, mining and tourism have been identified as priority areas.</p>
<p>The northern Queensland region generates approximately $60 billion in gross regional product annually from mining, agriculture, energy, education and tourism.</p>
<p>The area has an exciting future and Labor is committed to unlocking the region’s future growth through investment and support. </p>
