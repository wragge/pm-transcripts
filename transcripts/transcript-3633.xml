NATIONAL GALLERY BILL 1975<br />
SECOND READING SPEECH<br />
BY<br />
THE HONOURABLE E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
The purpose of the Bill is to establish an Australian<br />
National Gallery in the national capital to develop, maintain<br />
and exhibit a national collection of works of art and to<br />
provide an art focus for the whole Australian community.<br />
Like the Australia Council Bill, this is another<br />
historic initiative taken by the present Government to promote<br />
interest and activity in the arts in Australia. Our intention<br />
to introduce this legislation was announced in the<br />
Governor-General's Speech at the opening of Parliament on<br />
27 February 1973 and again in the Speech by Her Majesty<br />
The Queen on 28 February 1974. Our commitment was reiterated<br />
in the Policy Speech for the 1974 election and confirmed in<br />
the Governor-General's Speech on 9 July 1974.<br />
Honourable members will be aware of my longstanding<br />
interest in a National Gallery and the Hansard record of my<br />
questions over many years stands testimony to my concern<br />
about the growth of our national collection of works of art.<br />
I shall not dwell on the chequered history of the<br />
idea of a National Gallery but it is worth remembering that it<br />
is as old as the master plan for the national capital itself.<br />
Provision for it appeared in the list of requirements prepared<br />
for competitors submitting designs for the future city and<br />
Walter Burley Griffin in his own plan allowed for two such<br />
institutions. For a time the idea was obscured by depression, war<br />
and the other great forces which were reshaping Australian<br />
society; but the vision was not lost and it was the force<br />
and vigour of Sir Daryl Lindsay, in particular, which once<br />
more brought it to the fore./ 2 </p>
<p>On 10 September 1965 the then Prime Minister,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, announced the establishment of a National<br />
Art Gallery Committee of Inquiry under the Chairmanship of<br />
Sir Daryl Lindsay. The Committee's report was presented to<br />
the new Prime Minister, Mr Holt, on 14 March 1966. Mr Holt<br />
tabled it and paid tribute to it in a ministerial statement<br />
on 1 November 1967. The report recommended as the basis for<br />
all else that the Gallery be given statutory authority. The<br />
committee suggested that construction of the gallery might<br />
commence when the National Library was due for completion<br />
during 1968 and hoped that the opening of the gallery in 1970<br />
would be a fitting means of recognising in the National Capital<br />
the 200th anniversary of the discovery of eastern Australia<br />
by Captain Cook.<br />
On 26 October 1971 the then Prime Minister,<br />
Mr McMahon, announced his Government's intention to legislate<br />
for a permanent Council as a statutory body to administer the<br />
Gallery. He also announced at that time his Government's<br />
intention to appoint Mr James Mollison as the Gallery's<br />
first director. The design of a Gallery building was entrusted to<br />
Edwards, Madigan, Torzillo and Briggs Pty. Ltd., architects<br />
and town planners of Sydney. A contract for construction of<br />
the building was issued by my government in April 1973, and on<br />
7 November of that year I unveiled a foundation plaque<br />
commemorating the beginning of construction on the banks of<br />
Lake Burley Griffin nearby.<br />
A fine gallery building is not, however, an end in<br />
itself. In the final analysis, an institution is judged by what<br />
it offers and how effectively it does this, and in large measure<br />
this will depend upon the soundness of the principles on which<br />
it is based and the quality of the people who run it. / 3 </p>
<p>The Australian Government believes that the<br />
National Gallery Bill 1975 represents the best basis devised<br />
to this time for such an institution in our kind of society.<br />
It will be an independent statutory authority in<br />
many respects similar to the National Library of Australia.<br />
It will be responsible for the national collection of works<br />
of art and be expected to make the most advantageous use<br />
of the collection in the national interest.<br />
The affairs of the Gallery will be conducted by<br />
a Council, including the Director of the Gallery, and not<br />
more than 10 other members chosen with regard to their<br />
knowledge and experience with respect to the visual arts<br />
or other areas of knowledge relevant to the affairs of the<br />
Gallery. It is in mind that there should always be a<br />
proper blend of the artistic and other interests most likely<br />
to optimize the effectiveness of the institution.<br />
A novel feature of the Bill is that it provides<br />
for two statutory offices, the Director of the Australian<br />
National Gallery and the Secretary and Manager of the Gallery.<br />
The Director shall have overall responsibility to the Council<br />
for the running of the Gallery and its artistic direction,<br />
and the Secretary and Manager shall, under the Director,<br />
manage the day-to-day administration of the affairs of the<br />
Gallery and act as secretary to the Council. This provision </p>
<p>has been introduced to avoid the problems which have arisen<br />
so often elsewhere, where unlikely and unreasonable<br />
combinations of different expertise and experience have been<br />
demanded of the one person, usually with unfortunate results.<br />
It is hoped that by this means there will always be a proper<br />
complement of artistic and administrative skills with the<br />
most satisfactory use being made of what each office-holder<br />
is best able to offer.<br />
The Gallery will engage its own staff on terms<br />
and conditions determined by the Council but subject to<br />
the approval of the Public Service Board. This measure of<br />
flexibility is seen as essential to allow the Gallery to<br />
obtain the services of the best professional staff available<br />
whether in Australia or overseas, whether from other<br />
galleries or from universities or other areas.<br />
In its financial affairs the Gallery will operate in<br />
much the same way as most other statutory authorities. It will<br />
be required to submit estimates to the Minister in the<br />
normal way and it will be funded by annual appropriation.<br />
It will operate its own bank accounts, but it will be required<br />
to keep proper accounts and records of its affairs which will<br />
be subject to inspection and audit by the Auditor-General. It<br />
will also prepare annual reports to the Minister which will<br />
be tabled in Parliament. </p>
<p>I shall not go into other features of the Bill here;<br />
I believe that altogether they will ensure the proper control<br />
and accountability of one of the ration's important cultural<br />
institutions, while at the same time providing the vital<br />
elements of independence and flexibility which the institution<br />
requires to achieve the greatest measure of effectiveness.<br />
Much has been said over the last year or two about<br />
some of the Gallery's acquisitions of contemporary art from<br />
overseas. On balance, I think this has been for the good.<br />
Many art-interested Australians have been obliged to reconsider<br />
some of their values and tastes and I believe that this is a<br />
salutary experience for us all every once in a while. I<br />
should like to remind honourable members, however, that the<br />
Gallery's collection is indeeed not confined to contemporary<br />
art from overseas. In the view of the Director, the Gallery possesses<br />
close to the finest, balanced collection of Australian art<br />
anywhere in the country and it is virtually complete to this<br />
time. It is building a fine collection of primitive art<br />
based primarily on Pacific and African cultures. It is not<br />
neglecting the arts of our neighbours in Asia and the Far<br />
East nor the early civilizations of South America. The<br />
Gallery is assembling a major collection of graphic arts,<br />
and it already possesses the very fine Felix Man collection<br />
of lithographs tracing that art form from its very origins<br />
to recent times. A great sculpture collection is also being<br />
developed. / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
No Australian artist of importance has been<br />
neglected, and names like Constantin Brancusi, Alexander<br />
Calder, Honore Daumier, Auguste Rodin and Giambattista Tiepolo<br />
should leave no doubt that the Gallery is seeking the best<br />
of more than one period or place.<br />
We have here the beginnings of an institution which<br />
it is my hope, and the Government's, will be a source of<br />
pleasure and artistic stimulation for generations of<br />
Australians to come, a worthy addition to our growing national<br />
heritage, and an endeavour in which we might all take pride.<br />
I commend the Bill to the House.<br />
