<p>  Well Ian it was really the Hughes government that I was</p>
<p> first a member of but to the Mayor, to Ian Causley, your grace, my State</p>
<p> parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentleman.</p>
<p>  It is a great pleasure to be back in Lismore. I quite</p>
<p> deliberately chose as part of my week long visit to what I variously describe</p>
<p> as country Australia, the regions, the bush or whatever, I deliberately</p>
<p> chose to spend a period of time on the North Coast because this community</p>
<p> or these communities have a great cross section of some of the challenges</p>
<p> and opportunity of rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>  Political leaders do need to spend time in talking to</p>
<p> people where they live and work and interact with each other as members</p>
<p> of a community. The job of a Prime Minister is a varied one. There's</p>
<p> a time for formal decision making. There's a time for representing</p>
<p> Australia to the world. There's a time for putting one's partisan</p>
<p> political point of view but there's also importantly a time to spend</p>
<p> travelling this very large country and trying to come to grips with many</p>
<p> of the challenges and opportunities that we have as we enter the new century.</p>
<p>  Australia is at a very interesting indeed fascinating</p>
<p> stage of her history. If it had ever been possible for me to have ordained,</p>
<p> and it never was, a time at which I might be Prime Minister of this country</p>
<p> I can't think of a time other than now that I would have chosen because</p>
<p> in many ways if we can take the right decisions as a community now we</p>
<p> can win for ourselves a future and a sense of security, a sense of our</p>
<p> proper place in the world, the like of which we wouldn't have been</p>
<p> able to rival on any previous occasion.</p>
<p>  There's little doubt that at a general national</p>
<p> level the Australian economy is very strong. There's little doubt</p>
<p> that at a national level the spirit of our people is optimistic. There's</p>
<p> a sense of hope, there's a sense of national pride, there's</p>
<p> a sense of great self belief and there's a feeling that this country</p>
<p> is being recognised for what it is around the world and that is a modern</p>
<p> technologically sophisticated country always capable of punching above</p>
<p> its weight in international affairs with an unmatched reputation for social</p>
<p> harmony, for tolerance and for openness.</p>
<p>  Now some of you may think that is excessively benign</p>
<p> and excessively positive picture. Perhaps in some ways it is but I think</p>
<p> that it does describe that national mood. But you have a national mood</p>
<p> and then you have what I might call a whole series of individual or regional</p>
<p> moods. And I recognise, as Prime Minister, and I recognised before I embarked</p>
<p> upon my journey around rural Australia beginning last weekend, I recognised</p>
<p> that although we were doing well nationally there are many areas of Australia</p>
<p> that aren't sharing in that national economic plenty.</p>
<p>  In particular, I am very conscious of the fact that rural</p>
<p> Australia, most particularly those communities that are dependent on our</p>
<p> traditional primary industries are doing it very hard indeed. That is</p>
<p> the result of very very poor commodity prices in many cases compounded</p>
<p> by the perversity of adverse seasons but overwhelmingly the challenge</p>
<p> for those sorts of communities derives from the very very indifferent</p>
<p> commodity prices that some of those industries have experienced for very</p>
<p> prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>  I've mentioned to a number of people as I went around</p>
<p> the tables that last weekend I was in Quorn in rural South Australia,</p>
<p> in the Flinders Rangers area, a community very heavily dependent on wool</p>
<p> and a community that's doing it tough because the wool price is very</p>
<p> poor and they've had on top of that a fair amount of drought and</p>
<p> when you put those two together you have a fairly lethal combination for</p>
<p> rural adversity.</p>
<p>  And I can understand how those communities feel keenly</p>
<p> that when they hear the Prime Minister or indeed anybody else talking</p>
<p> about the strength of the economy they can ask themselves well that's</p>
<p> alright for the rest of them, it's alright for the cities, it's</p>
<p> alright for him but it's not very strong out here. I want those people</p>
<p> to understand it and know I respect that situation. I'm sympathetic</p>
<p> towards it and I know the sense of missing out on the national economic</p>
<p> success is very keenly felt But of course it's the responsibility</p>
<p> of the Prime Minister to talk about the national economic condition and</p>
<p> it's not realistic of me to pass up the responsibility and the obligation</p>
<p> and the opportunity I have to talk to Australia's fundamental strengths.</p>
<p>  I've found over the last week a very legitimate</p>
<p> interest and concern about service provision in regional and rural Australia.</p>
<p> I think it's pretty widely understood now that no matter how robust</p>
<p> may be your commitment, and mine is certainly very robust, to the free</p>
<p> enterprise system a belief that the business community better than governments</p>
<p> can generate economic wealth but despite that governments do have ongoing</p>
<p> responsibilities to provide services.</p>
<p>  People living in the country have the right equal to</p>
<p> the right of their fellow Australians in the city to adequate and affordable</p>
<p> health services. They have the right to share fairly and equitably in</p>
<p> the communications revolution that is not only sweeping Australia but</p>
<p> indeed the entire world.</p>
<p>  We do not want in the twenty-first century information</p>
<p> technology haves and information technology have nots. They also need</p>
<p> of course access to adequate education and other basic facilities.</p>
<p>  I believe very strongly in the pre-eminent role of the</p>
<p> business community and the private sector in wealth generation because</p>
<p> without a strong private sector, without a strong business community you</p>
<p> don't have jobs and you don't generate wealth but I do believe</p>
<p> that there is a limited but very strategic role for the government in</p>
<p> the provision of certain services. Some of those services of course relate</p>
<p> to what is generally called infrastructure, whether it's physical</p>
<p> infrastructure or intellectual infrastructure, whether it takes the form</p>
<p> of roads, takes the form of provision of schools which is of course the</p>
<p> responsibility overwhelmingly of State governments, or indeed all the</p>
<p> other things that are normally associated with the provision of infrastructure</p>
<p> by governments.</p>
<p>At the moment we're having something of a debate in the Australian</p>
<p> community about the provision of further infrastructure around Australia</p>
<p> and the government of course will continue to assume its responsibilities</p>
<p> for providing financial support for that infrastructure. I think there</p>
<p> are opportunities for accelerated investment in infrastructure if we didn't</p>
<p> for example continue to invest tens of billions of dollars in owning a</p>
<p> telecommunications company, or owning half of it. There are probably a</p>
<p> number of people in this room who don't agree with me on that. I</p>
<p> understand that. And I regard gatherings like this as gatherings where</p>
<p> one should acknowledge some differences of opinion and try and state my</p>
<p> own views as cogently as I can.</p>
<p>I favour the sale of the other 50% of Telstra owned by the government</p>
<p> for a number of reasons. I think it's increasingly unsustainable</p>
<p> for the government to have 50% of a telecommunications company and the</p>
<p> private sector to own the rest. I think as time goes by it will create</p>
<p> difficult issues. For example if Telstra wanted to buy into a media organisation</p>
<p> for example. The government already has a media organisation, or funds</p>
<p> one Â– it's called the ABC. We don't control it and we don't</p>
<p> seek to control it. I don't think it's desirable that any government</p>
<p> should seek to control a media organisation. But the idea that if sometime</p>
<p> in the future Telstra might seek to have an interest in a media organisation</p>
<p> and that's been talked about, I think it would face a very difficult</p>
<p> conflict of interest situation for the government as a major shareholder.</p>
<p>I think it's a good idea for the men and women of Australia to directly</p>
<p> own shares in a great national enterprise and the two floats that we've</p>
<p> had to date have been extremely popular. They've even been extremely</p>
<p> popular amongst some of the people who were publicly critical of the two</p>
<p> floats having taken place as an examination of the share registers which</p>
<p> are publicly available would indicate. And I think it would be very very</p>
<p> valuable and I think very beneficial if instead of all of that money being</p>
<p> tied up in Telstra we could use the proceeds of the sale of the other</p>
<p> 50% to pay off the rest of our Commonwealth net debt and have some billions</p>
<p> of dollars left over for accelerated investment in, some of it at least,</p>
<p> in some additional infrastructure in regional, but not only regional Australia,</p>
<p> but throughout the whole country.</p>
<p>It's one of those issues where you need to face a choice. Is it</p>
<p> better for Australia to have tens of billions of dollars tied up in owning</p>
<p> a telecommunications company or is it better for that public investment</p>
<p> to be directed elsewhere. And that really is the sort of choice that's</p>
<p> involved. People say what about the standard of service provided by Telstra.</p>
<p> Let me say service obligations can be legislated irrespective of who owns</p>
<p> the enterprise, irrespective of who owns the enterprise. And I've</p>
<p> always made it very clear ladies and gentlemen that our commitment to</p>
<p> the sale of the rest of Telstra is conditional upon the government first</p>
<p> being satisfied that the community service obligations laid down are fully</p>
<p> met and have been fully complied with.</p>
<p>The other matter of course I guess I can't sit down without ever</p>
<p> so briefly mentioning is the issue of taxation reform. I say the issue</p>
<p> of taxation reform because what we are facing on the 1st of</p>
<p> July is not the introduction of a goods and services tax. What we are</p>
<p> facing on the 1st of July is a fundamental revamp for the better</p>
<p> of our taxation system. In the words of the original description when</p>
<p> we announced our policy almost two years ago Â– It's not a</p>
<p> new tax, it's a new tax system. And what people should see in</p>
<p> what we're introducing on the 1st of July is a very fundamental</p>
<p> change. Amongst other things we're going to have a $12 billion reduction</p>
<p> in personal income tax. 80% of Australian taxpayers will be on a top marginal</p>
<p> rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. We will have much cheaper</p>
<p> fuel and I can't think of anything that is more directly beneficial</p>
<p> to and proportionally more advantageous for rural Australia than reductions</p>
<p> in fuel costs. We'll have cheaper exports and therefore more competitive</p>
<p> exports because the GST won't apply to exports. We'll have a</p>
<p> simplified general business tax....general tax that will reduce the</p>
<p> operating costs of businesses. We'll have in the business tax area</p>
<p> a reduction by approximately one-half in the level of the capital gains</p>
<p> tax. We'll have a reduction in the business tax rate from 36% to</p>
<p> 30%. We'll see the abolition of provisional taxation. We'll</p>
<p> see the introduction of increases in pensions and benefits for people</p>
<p> on fixed social security payments to fully compensate them in advance</p>
<p> for the price effects of the goods and services tax. And we'll see</p>
<p> the removal of the rather ramshackled, inequitable wholesale tax system</p>
<p> where some items are taxed at 22% and some items at nothing, and replaced</p>
<p> generally speaking by a single rate goods and services tax.</p>
<p>Now it's very easy for people to run a campaign against one aspect</p>
<p> of this change. And I could mount an argument to all of you as to why</p>
<p> you shouldn't have a GST on this or that item. I suppose in isolation</p>
<p> we could mount an argument that we have no taxation at all, and you know,</p>
<p> you could mount it in isolation. But we have to have a tax system because</p>
<p> governments are expected by communities to provide certain services and</p>
<p> we need the fairest and most equitable way of raising a given amount of</p>
<p> revenue to provide those services and to provide a safety net for those</p>
<p> who through no fault of their own need the assistance of their fellow</p>
<p> Australians. So I ask you when you read and hear of the individual requests</p>
<p> for exemptions, you read and hear of the scare campaign on this or that</p>
<p> item to bear in mind that we have a choice Â– we either embrace a</p>
<p> system that will make Australia more internationally competitive, that</p>
<p> once and for all will give us a better tax system, or we limp along with</p>
<p> the present system. Because the people who are trying to prevent tax reform</p>
<p> taking place, and that includes many of our political opponents, they</p>
<p> are really arguing for the present system. You can't have it both</p>
<p> ways. You can't say you want a bit of reform but without you know</p>
<p> all of the things that you can easily campaign against. We went to the</p>
<p> last election, we laid out our plan, we were quite up front. We ran the</p>
<p> risks, we took the punches in relation to the introduction of the new</p>
<p> system and the Australian people voted in favour of the government. When</p>
<p> it came to getting it through the Parliament, because of the opposition</p>
<p> of Senator Harradine we had to compromise a little with the Australian</p>
<p> Democrats. I would have preferred originally to have gone along with the</p>
<p> government's original proposition. But we compromised with the Democrats.</p>
<p> We got 85% of what we wanted and that's it. There'll be no going</p>
<p> back on that. We won't of course seek in the future to go back to</p>
<p> our original position. We struck a deal, that was the basis of getting</p>
<p> it through. And now it's important that we embrace the change and</p>
<p> the reason I'm committed to it is not because I'm an ideological</p>
<p> zealot. It's because I think this tax system will make Australia</p>
<p> stronger and better and economically more soundly based and more competitive,</p>
<p> and I think it's fairer and I think it's more efficient. And</p>
<p> that is why I'm committed to it. Now of course there are going to</p>
<p> be some implementation challenges and the government is keen to help the</p>
<p> community, particularly the business community, the accounting and the</p>
<p> legal professions in those implementation challenges. But it is one of</p>
<p> those occasions when we have to be willing as a community to embrace something</p>
<p> that is beneficial. Don't be diverted by the scares Â– they're</p>
<p> easy. What is a little bit harder is building something enduring and long</p>
<p> term for the future of the country.</p>
<p>Finally ladies and gentlemen can I say that of all the impressions I've</p>
<p> gathered in the last few days travelling around Australia, the one that</p>
<p> has come through most strongly to me, and the one that's come through</p>
<p> most reassuringly to me, is a continued sense of community in rural Australia.</p>
<p> Whether it's in the very small community or in the larger towns I</p>
<p> find that great Australian willingness to put aside your differences on</p>
<p> particular issues and come together as a group of people trying to solve</p>
<p> a problem. Bourke is a town that has had it's share of problems involving</p>
<p> people of different races. It's had difficulties between Aboriginal</p>
<p> Australians and other Australians. And I found there that instead of the</p>
<p> two groups being at arms length from each other and shouting slogans at</p>
<p> each other, I found the groups and the leaders pleasingly and refreshingly</p>
<p> working together and recognising that the problems were a community problem.</p>
<p> That it wasn't productive to engage in name calling, it wasn't</p>
<p> productive to negotiate with each other from arms length, rather it was</p>
<p> productive to sit down as a community and try and solve these problems.</p>
<p> I was asked by one or two people whether I had met some leaders of the</p>
<p> Aboriginal Land Council and I said no, but I quickly said that I hadn't</p>
<p> met the leaders of the National Farmers Federation either. It's not</p>
<p> because I'm indifferent to either the Land Council or the National</p>
<p> Farmers Federation, but I took the view that if you go to the community</p>
<p> you meet the community, rather than try and get a particular view from</p>
<p> particular groups in the community much and all as I may respect those</p>
<p> views. And so it is in all the places that I've visited I've</p>
<p> found that very strong community sentiment and I think that's very</p>
<p> reassuring because it indicates that there's something very positive</p>
<p> and there's something very enlightening and I think inspiring alive</p>
<p> within Australian rural communities. And it's very important as we</p>
<p> ponder the adversity of many rural communities that we never lose sight</p>
<p> of the fact that there are many good news stories in rural Australia.</p>
<p> There are huge success stories and it would be a huge mistake if the impression</p>
<p> were created that everything was difficulty and despair. There is a lot</p>
<p> of adversity, I understand that. I've sought in recent days and I</p>
<p> will continue over the months ahead in a realistic achievable way, not</p>
<p> a rhetorical unachievable way, as leader of the government to come to</p>
<p> terms with those things. And I'll be aided with the advice of my</p>
<p> colleagues such as Ian Causley and Larry Anthony and Gary Nehl who represent</p>
<p> the three electorates of the north coast in the national Parliament. And</p>
<p> I very warmly thank you for coming along tonight. I'm enjoying being</p>
<p> amongst you.</p>
