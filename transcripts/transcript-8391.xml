PRIME MINISTER ] 9/<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PROGRESS ON ECONOMIC STATEMENT<br />
I will convene the first meeting of the co-ordinating<br />
committee of Ministers f or the Economic Statement for next<br />
Tuesday and Wednesday.<br />
The group comprises myself, Mr Howe, Senator Button, Senator<br />
Evans, Mr Dawkins and Mr Willis.<br />
The primary aim of the first meeting will be to consider<br />
which ideas promoted by business and trade unions during the<br />
recent round of meetings are worthy of further<br />
consideration. Departments will then be directed to examine these proposals<br />
in more detail.<br />
The Government regards the series of national meetings in<br />
Sydney and Melbourne as an unqualified success.<br />
Business and unions from each State were represented and the<br />
meetings were conducted in a spirit of co-operation with a<br />
clear focus on getting the recovery underway.<br />
As I have already announced, the Minister for Small Business<br />
and Customs, Mr Beddall, will convene a meeting of the Small<br />
Business Coalition, which I will attend on Thursday 6<br />
February. I have already made it clear that I and senior Ministers<br />
will be visiting other capital cities at various times<br />
before the Statement is delivered.<br />
It is my intention to visit each State capital Adelaide<br />
next Thursday 30 January, Perth on Friday 31 January and<br />
Brisbane on Monday 3 February.<br />
Senior Ministers will also visit regional centres. Details<br />
will be announced when finalised.<br />
I consider it important to develop a sense of national<br />
purpose tcowards this Economic Statement and to that end I<br />
and my Ministers will continue to make every endeavour to<br />
seek positive contributions from around Australia.<br />
