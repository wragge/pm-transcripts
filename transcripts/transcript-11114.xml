<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>It's with a great deal of pleasure that I welcome the Prime Minister,</p>
<p> John Howard. Sir, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, how are you?</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I was just musing about the trouble that people seem to have with</p>
<p> the guidelines that you've set down to look after conflicts of</p>
<p> interest. Why do people find it so hard to just follow them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think anybody has established that there's</p>
<p> been any actual conflicts of interest. There have been some examples</p>
<p> where people have, through inadvertence or otherwise, neglected to</p>
<p> complete to the last detail the declaration of members' interests.</p>
<p> And it's fair to say that that's occurred on both sides</p>
<p> and is probably still occurring on both sides of the House. But that</p>
<p> does not, of itself, constitute what I call a hanging offence. I mean,</p>
<p> anybody can inadvertently leave out a reference to a directorship.</p>
<p> What really is the purpose of these declarations both to the Parliament</p>
<p> and in the case of Ministers to me is to put the public and me in</p>
<p> particular, in relation to my Ministers, in full possession of people's</p>
<p> assets or the knowledge of those assets so that the judgement can</p>
<p> be made whether there's a conflict of interest. Now, in the case</p>
<p> of Warren Entsch, nobody's been able to demonstrate yet that</p>
<p> he's done anything wrong. I mean, he did lobby, he did publicly</p>
<p> argue for something to be done about some contaminated land in his</p>
<p> electorate but that was his job. And this has been a difficult problem</p>
<p> in the Cairns area for a long time. And the fact that he owns some</p>
<p> property some, what, eight, nine, ten kilometres away and it's</p>
<p> remotely possible that some time in the future, if a whole lot of</p>
<p> other things happen over which he's got no control, that his</p>
<p> land in common with the land of a lot of other people might increase</p>
<p> in value if the first mentioned land is developed, to suggest that</p>
<p> that in any common sense meaning of the word, and the expression is</p>
<p> a conflict of interest, is the equivalent of saying that a rural member</p>
<p> who argues for a highway upgrading which if granted might improve</p>
<p> the value of all of the properties including his own farm, that that</p>
<p> man's involved in a conflict of interest. I mean, you are pushing</p>
<p> the meaning of that expression to absolutely demented lengths.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but these people must know how important it is to you.</p>
<p> I'm surprised they don't err on the extreme side of caution</p>
<p> just so that you're not put in this position where you have to</p>
<p> defend them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we live in a very nit picking, adversarial world of politics</p>
<p> and Oppositions grab hold of anything, particularly when they don't</p>
<p> have alternative policies. I mean, right at the moment we are changing</p>
<p> the tax system. We're privatising Telstra. We're changing</p>
<p> the environmental laws. We're launching new initiatives in relation</p>
<p> to families. We're getting on with the job of governing the country.</p>
<p> Our opponents don't have alternative policies so I suppose if</p>
<p> you can throw a bit of mud, you can make some allegations, you can</p>
<p> nit-pick. It is true that in relation to some examples that have been</p>
<p> brought forward that people have not completed to the last letter</p>
<p> the forms that they should have. And that, may I say, there's</p>
<p> evidence of that on both sides. But that of itself does not constitute</p>
<p> a hanging offence. These are guidelines. They're not meant to</p>
<p> be death sentences. And if you have a situation where you throw a</p>
<p> person out of a responsible position because he neglected, for example,</p>
<p> to declare a directorship of a property that can't possibly be</p>
<p> in any kind of political contention or can't involve any kind</p>
<p> of suggestion of a conflict of interest then Â I just think we're</p>
<p> wasting our time on trivia. Now, if somebody could come along and</p>
<p> demonstrate to me that either of these people have been guilty of</p>
<p> fraud Â I mean, if the allegations being made against Entsch</p>
<p> or Heffernan were that they've been guilty of fraud, well, that</p>
<p> would be a very serious matter. If the allegations were that they</p>
<p> had actually gained in direct and personal sense from the use of their</p>
<p> parliamentary position in a wrongful way, well, that's a different</p>
<p> matter. But nobody's suggesting that. I mean, to suggest that</p>
<p> a bloke who takes up the cudgels for his own constituents, and because</p>
<p> there's the remote connection I described a moment ago, what,</p>
<p> is he not meant to do that? Is he meant to sell the property he had</p>
<p> when he became a Parliamentary Secretary? Do we want people in Parliament</p>
<p> who know nothing about business, who own no assets, who have none</p>
<p> of life's experience? I mean, we won't have any of these</p>
<p> allegations but I think we'll have a greatly deprived Parliament.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, I was going to say to you that maybe the guidelines if I play</p>
<p> devil's advocate, maybe the guidelines are such that they will</p>
<p> prevent the very people you want in Parliament from getting there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, not if they're looked at in a common sense way. If you</p>
<p> look at the guidelines as being guidelines and not death sentences</p>
<p> which are required to provide information so that proper assessments</p>
<p> can be made about conflicts of interest, if both sides of politics</p>
<p> recognise that from time to time their political opponents are going</p>
<p> to make inadvertent errors about recording information and I think</p>
<p> it's fair to say that in the past, probably our side of politics,</p>
<p> nit picked on this too.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And we've both been guilty of it and I think the whole situation</p>
<p> now is reaching a position where nit picking is not helping either</p>
<p> side. If there's any genuine allegation of fraud or conflict</p>
<p> of interest, something of substance, well of course that should be</p>
<p> investigated. And if people in positions of executive responsibility</p>
<p> are guilty on either side they ought to be stood down. But nobody's</p>
<p> established any fraud or conflict of interest in relation to either</p>
<p> Entsch or Heffernan. I mean, it's just sheer nit picking.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, this High Court decision with regard to Heather Hill.</p>
<p> Now, how do you see that, is that good news for the republicans or</p>
<p> good news for the monarchists? I mean, how could it possibly be that</p>
<p> we need a referendum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it's irrelevant to the debate on the republic.</p>
<p> Australia has legally been independent of Britain for a long time,</p>
<p> emotionally and politically, and in terms of our national identity</p>
<p> we have been independent of the British for much longer than that.</p>
<p> That's not really the case at point. The decision didn't</p>
<p> surprise me in the slightest. I'm surprised at the surprise and</p>
<p> the interest being expressed by some in the media about it being a</p>
<p> landmark decision. I don't think it's a landmark decision</p>
<p> at all. I've always operated under the view that legally Australia</p>
<p> was independent of the United Kingdom and it's been so for decades.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, there we are, I mean, wouldn't that save us a lot of money?</p>
<p> We're independent, it's a foreign country, why do we need</p>
<p> to go through a referendum to...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as you know, I am against an Australian republic and I will</p>
<p> be voting no in November.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Will you be campaigning for the Âno' vote?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, well I won't be campaigning in a day-to-day sense, I've</p>
<p> made that clear, but people know my view and if I'm asked it</p>
<p> I'll express it. And I guess when we get to the campaign I will</p>
<p> explain why, in more detail, why I'm against a republic. I mean,</p>
<p> we are an independent country. We have a marvellously stable system</p>
<p> and through an historical accident, which I think is beneficial, we</p>
<p> have a way of delivering a non-political Head of State and for practical</p>
<p> purposes that is the Governor-General. I mean, why disturb something</p>
<p> that works so superbly well...</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>It's a dash into darkness and the unknown if you ask me.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's just no point. I mean, I don't think anybody</p>
<p> in Australia today could possibly feel that this country is lacking</p>
<p> in self-respect or self-esteem or a sense of its own worth and decency</p>
<p> and importance and capacity and achievement. And, anyway, it's</p>
<p> a democracy and I know there are many of my fellow Australians who</p>
<p> have a different view. And you say why are we having a referendum</p>
<p> Â we're having a referendum I guess to, for the time being,</p>
<p> resolve the matter because there are a lot of people who believe we</p>
<p> should become a republic and the fair and decent thing to do, and</p>
<p> a thing I promised to do before the 1996 election was to have a convention</p>
<p> and then if the model emerged then to put that to the people. Now,</p>
<p> I'm doing that. I promised to do it. I'm keeping my word.</p>
<p> But for my own part I'll be voting no.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, as you say, it's a democracy and everyone has the right</p>
<p> to speak out. I see the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett, is speaking</p>
<p> out and in fairly harsh terms about the compromises made on the GST.</p>
<p> What's your feeling?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think he's being very negative and I think he's</p>
<p> looking backwards. It's easy to be critical if you don't</p>
<p> get 100 per cent of what you want but few people get 100 per cent</p>
<p> of what they want in this world, particularly if you're a government</p>
<p> that doesn't control both Houses of Parliament and we don't.</p>
<p> We got 85 per cent of what we wanted and that is infinitely better</p>
<p> than zero and it's a lot better than the present system. And</p>
<p> those who criticise and nit pick and try and undermine the compromise</p>
<p> that's been agreed are really arguing for a maintenance of the</p>
<p> status quo. You can't, in a sense, have it both ways because</p>
<p> the option of 100 per cent of what we want just isn't available</p>
<p> because the votes aren't there for that. Therefore I've</p>
<p> got to decide, do I stick with the present system or do I try and</p>
<p> achieve a compromise. Now, it's much better to have a compromise</p>
<p> when it delivers 85 per cent of what you originally wanted.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>You know that original plan of a 10 per cent GST, 30 per cent rate</p>
<p> for the majority of people at personal income tax and a 30 per cent</p>
<p> corporate rate, I mean, how achievable is that corporate rate now</p>
<p> of 30 per cent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we haven't set that in quite the same cement as we set</p>
<p> the other things. It's an option. How achievable Â I think</p>
<p> I'll be better able to answer that when I get John Ralph's</p>
<p> report in a few weeks time. There are arguments that you should have</p>
<p> a 30 per cent corporate rate and you pay for that by removing the</p>
<p> accelerated depreciation benefits that a lot of companies, particularly</p>
<p> miners and manufacturers and farmers have at the moment. Some of them</p>
<p> support that, others say no, we'd rather pay 36 or be liable</p>
<p> for the 36, a lot of them don't pay it because they have bona</p>
<p> fide concessions that reduce their tax bills and keep our accelerated</p>
<p> depreciation. Now, it will be a very interesting debate. As far as</p>
<p> the personal tax is concerned our commitment that 80 per cent of the</p>
<p> community would be on a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents</p>
<p> in the dollar. That has been preserved in full and from the 1st</p>
<p> of July next year there will be $12 million in personal tax cuts and</p>
<p> another $2 to $2.5 billion of family benefits over and above those</p>
<p> $12 million of tax cuts. And that, I think, will increasingly be seen</p>
<p> as the real face of tax reform. The debate about the minutiae of the</p>
<p> GST will now fade an agreement having been reached on the assumption</p>
<p> it all goes through Parliament in the next few days which I believe</p>
<p> it will but we have to wait and see. I never take Parliament for granted</p>
<p> but I am confident it will go through. I think the focus then will</p>
<p> be on the personal tax cuts on the upside, the pluses, the good things</p>
<p> that come out of the tax plan rather than the nit-picking about salads</p>
<p> and thermometers and chickens, hot, cold or lukewarm.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Something that came up on the programme the other day, it's just an</p>
<p> anomaly, do you know when people have said, well let's not have people</p>
<p> retiring at 65 let them go on working if they want to and many of</p>
<p> those people go on to being self-employed. Now, somebody who left</p>
<p> the workforce at the age of 65 set up his own handyman business, it</p>
<p> was going fine until he realised that he couldn't go and get from</p>
<p> anyone any accident and sickness insurance. They won't touch you once</p>
<p> you are over 65 and that, of course, restricts anything that a person</p>
<p> can do in starting up his small business. Is there anything you can</p>
<p> do about that because it really is discriminating against people just</p>
<p> because they are 65?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's not a lot you can do about that. You can't force people</p>
<p> in a free enterprise system to provide a business service if they</p>
<p> don't want to. I mean,....</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>It just seems like they have colluded to....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't...well, I understand why people would say that. But</p>
<p> this is an example of what is called market failure that there's not</p>
<p> a market for this because people don't think there's a good enough</p>
<p> risk to provide the insurance. Or if they do provide the insurance</p>
<p> the premium they charge is so high that nobody would want to take</p>
<p> it out. Now, the only alternative that a government has got there</p>
<p> is for the Government to provide some kind of scheme but, gee, where</p>
<p> does government start and finish? Are we....I think a lot of people</p>
<p> are saying to us, well, we don't want the Government getting involved</p>
<p> in everything and every time the Government provides a service it</p>
<p> means that it has got to find the revenue to pay for that service.</p>
<p> And that means it can either increase taxation or not reduce it as</p>
<p> much as it would like to.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But shouldn't Government jump in there where the private sector doesn't</p>
<p> or can't do something?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it can but I am not sure that it always should because if it</p>
<p> doesn't, if it keeps plugging every gap well there is no end to what</p>
<p> you are asking the Government to do. This is the difficulty.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, here's somebody who is at the age of 65 who is now looking to</p>
<p> going on social security. It'd be far better to have him as a taxpayer.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it would be better to have him as a taxpayer but it's not just</p>
<p> a simple question of expressing our preference, it's also a question</p>
<p> of what is involved in the Government scheme to provide insurance.</p>
<p> And once you provide a Government scheme you will then have a lot</p>
<p> of people in the private insurance sector saying to the Government,</p>
<p> well, we would like you to underwrite the more difficult risks we</p>
<p> have. If you are prepared to intervene and fill this gap therefore</p>
<p> you accept that some underwriting is more risky than others why don't</p>
<p> you extend your guarantee and your underpinning into some of the more</p>
<p> risky areas of our business and before long you'll have the potential</p>
<p> for the Government to really control the insurance industry. And I</p>
<p> think it's a difficult issue but there are limits beyond which governments</p>
<p> shouldn't go if you basically believe that this is a free enterprise</p>
<p> community.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, the public servants have to retire at 65 don't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not sure about what the situation is in all of the States</p>
<p> but that age limit is being removed at a federal level. And I understand</p>
<p> it has been or it's in the process of being removed at a State level</p>
<p> although I am not sure of the progress in each individual State.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>By the way, thank you for following through on that other anomaly,</p>
<p> the business of the bone density drugs being free to women and not</p>
<p> to men. Thanks for that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well I remember that very well and I am glad you have got the</p>
<p> information.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. Engaged couples will receive vouchers for free pre-wedding</p>
<p> counselling in an effort to slash the $3 billion a year cost of marriage</p>
<p> break-up. Why not just scrap the family court because that's the main</p>
<p> problem, people just walking out of their relationships?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand the emotion, and I understand the view of life that would</p>
<p> lead me to say that and I've got a lot of sympathy for it. I</p>
<p> don't think it's realistic though to get rid of the family</p>
<p> court because most of the disputes the family court deals with of</p>
<p> course are disputes relating to property and custody, and when marriages</p>
<p> break-up decisions do have to be made about the division of property</p>
<p> and the custody of children and you do need somebody to make that</p>
<p> judgement. And I say that as somebody who way back in 1975 did not</p>
<p> vote in favour of all the major provisions in the family law act when</p>
<p> it was brought in. I mean I had some reservations about some aspects</p>
<p> of the changes but that's a long time ago now and that's</p>
<p> history and I'm dealing with the here and now. But we don't</p>
<p> pretend that what we announced yesterday is going to make a dramatic</p>
<p> impact but it will make a contribution and it's a recognition</p>
<p> that although governments can't legislate to make people be nice</p>
<p> to each other and to support each other, we can recognise that maybe</p>
<p> if people had a little better understanding of the character of relationships,</p>
<p> the obligations they bring, the obligations of marriage and so forth</p>
<p> they might enter those associations more carefully and some of them</p>
<p> might last longer and they might be a lot more positive. And that</p>
<p> is why we're going to trial this voucher system and see how it</p>
<p> works. I think there's a greater willingness on the part of Australians</p>
<p> now to talk more openly about their relationships in an appropriate</p>
<p> environment, particularly on the part of men. I think that's</p>
<p> a very welcome thing and if we can perhaps encourage people to think</p>
<p> a little more carefully then the costs down the track could be reduced.</p>
<p> Now our ambitions are modest but our commitment is very genuine in</p>
<p> this area and it's part of a, I think a strategic approach to</p>
<p> marriages in our community recognising that really marriage is one</p>
<p> of those core enduring institutions of Australian society and that</p>
<p> we should be prepared to go an extra mile and provide an extra margin</p>
<p> for marriage within our society because it is still the cornerstone</p>
<p> of the most important relationships we develop and it's something</p>
<p> that where appropriate and in a practical way should be supported.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just quickly, what are you going to do if a large</p>
<p> percentage of the Kosovar refugees want to stay? Have you thought</p>
<p> about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I have thought about that. Our belief is that the great bulk of</p>
<p> them will want to go home. We of course have the right legally to</p>
<p> require all of them to go back at sometime in the future. They are</p>
<p> here under special safe haven temporary arrangements and none of them</p>
<p> has any automatic right to stay in Australia and no right to sort</p>
<p> of go to court to establish a right to stay here. However we're</p>
<p> not going to send them back in circumstances where they would be....there</p>
<p> lives would be at risk. The circumstances of Kosovo are changing but</p>
<p> it will still be some time before it's safe for refugees to return.</p>
<p> There are some horrific stories of people losing their limbs and their</p>
<p> lives because of bombs exploding and land mines that have been left</p>
<p> behind by the retreating Serbian army. So it will be some time yet.</p>
<p> I think we just have to handle that Jeremy in a practical compassionate</p>
<p> way when the challenge, if it is to come does in fact come. I suspect</p>
<p> in the end most of them, if not all them will go home. But let's</p>
<p> deal with that down the track.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Thank you for your time sir. Just a couple of minutes before the news.</p>
<p> Let me ask you about security. The people looking after you were found,</p>
<p> well, not exactly on the job the other day, and somebody managed to</p>
<p> get in and throw a pie in</p>
