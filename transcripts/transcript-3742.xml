NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
FOR A CIVIC RECEPTION IN<br />
FORBES, NISW. 17 J'AY 1975<br />
1, I AM DELIGHTED TO BE MAKING MY FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT<br />
To FORBES, THIS CITY, BORN IN THE GOLDRUSH DAYS OF<br />
THE 1860' s, IS NO W THE CENTRE OF A THRIVING<br />
AGRICULTURAL AND PASTORAL INDUSTRY, LIKE SO MANY<br />
TOWNS OF THE PERIOD IT RETAINS MANY OF THE BUILDINGS<br />
AND MUCH OF THE CHARACTER OF ITS EARLY YEARS,<br />
TOGETHER WITH THE SIGNS OF MODERN COMMERCIAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT$ a<br />
2, FOR TOO LONG PEOPLE IN COUNTRY TOWNS HAVE BEEN PUTTING<br />
UP WITH SERVICES AND AMENITIES INFERIOR TO THOSE IN THE<br />
CAPITAL CITIES. THE LABOR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED THAT<br />
TOWNSPEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WILL ENJOY A STANDARD OF LIVING<br />
EQUAL TO THE BEST IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
3. OUR OPPONENTS SEEM TO THINK THAT A GOVERNMENT'S<br />
RESPONSIBILITY IN COUNTRY AREAS ENDS WITH THE FARMER,<br />
THE MAN ON THE LAND,. CERTAINLY WE RECOGNISE THAT<br />
PROSPERITY IN COUNTRY AREAS DEPENDS LARGELY ON A<br />
PROSPEROUS RURAL COMMUNITY. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE<br />
NOT GOING TO NEGLECT THE MILLIONS OF AUSTRALIANSEMPLOYEES<br />
AND FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN TOWNS LIKE FORBES.<br />
THEY DESERVE THE SAME STANDARDS OF EDUCATION, THE SAME<br />
STANDARDS OF HOUSING, THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALTH<br />
AND RECREATION As AUSTRALIANS IN THE MAJOR CITIES. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
ONE OF THE FIRST ACTS OF THIS GOVERNMENT WAS TO EMPOWER<br />
THE GRANTS COMMISSION TO REC"~ END ASSISTANCE FOR LOCAL<br />
AUTHORITIES. IN THIS WAY THE GRANTS COMMISSION WILL BE<br />
ABLE TO ALLEVIATE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN REGIONS, IN THE<br />
SAME WAY THAT IT HAS ACTED TO REMOVE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN<br />
THE STATES, IN ITS FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS, THE<br />
COM1MISSION ALLOCATED MORE THAN $ 21 MILLION FOR LOCAL<br />
COUNCILS IN NEW SOUTH WALES. FORBES MUNICIPAL COUNCIL<br />

SHIRES WITHIN THE FORBES DISTRICT HAVE RECEIVED<br />
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE UNDER REDS TOTALLING $ 765,000,<br />
6, No GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE TO ALLEVIATE THE EFFECTS<br />
OF NATURAL DISASTERS. WE ESTABLISHED THE NATURAL<br />
DISASTERS RELIEF ORGANISATIONt WHICH HAS ALREADY<br />
PROVED ITS VALUE BY ITS MAGNIFICENT WORK IN DARWIN<br />
AND DURING THE BUSHFIRES LAST SUMMER IN NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES. WE ARE ESTABLISHING THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
INSURANCE CORPORATION TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVER<br />
AGAINST NATURAL DISASTERS AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST<br />
TO HOUSEHOLDERS. MAJOR FLOODING OCCURRED IN FORBES<br />
AND THE SURROUNDING AREA DURING AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER<br />

ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS WITH THE STATE FOR RELIEF<br />
