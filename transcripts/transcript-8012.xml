TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, ANZAC COVE, GALLIPOLI,<br />
APRIL 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you think the day has gone?<br />
PM: I think it has been a day which everyone will<br />
remember right from the very beginning we had the<br />
moving Dawn Service and then right through the breakfast<br />
it was good to see the, the old veterans together again<br />
then and I think we had a very moving service at Lone<br />
Pine and I think one of the most moving parts of the day,<br />
of course, was at lunch time when we had the two old<br />
veterans exchanging uniforms, boots, kisses, hugs, shakes<br />
and then embracing one another here. After 75 years the<br />
enemies of yesterday, they culminated it today.-It'* s<br />
been altogether a most moving day and I'd like to express<br />
my appreciation to the Turkish authorities, to our own<br />
armed forces, to everyone in any way who's been<br />
associated with organising the day. I think it's<br />
something that will live in the minds of everyone who's<br />
been here I'm sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think people back in<br />
Australia who still think about the spirit of Anzac still<br />
regard it as part of Australia's character?<br />
PM: I think so. As I tried to say in the address, brief<br />
address I gave at Lone Pine, I think it's the duty, the<br />
responsibility of each new generation to reinterpret the<br />
spirit and the meaning of Anzac and I hope that today,<br />
through the contribution of the return of these great old<br />
veterans and the association with it of so many people<br />
the non political nature of it, we have our friends here<br />
from the Opposition. I hope that all Australians can see<br />
that, this is not just rhetoric, but that we are really<br />
in what is sacred ground for Australians because here was<br />
the, here was the forging place of the Australian<br />
character where men gave their lives to express their<br />
commitment to one another, to their dependency upon each<br />
other, to the concept of mateship. It was a military<br />
defeat, but it was a great victory for the Australian<br />
spirit I believe. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: This battlefield where we're standing now<br />
epitomises what you were talking about at Lone Pine<br />
doesn't it?<br />
PM: This is, I think, the saddest part of a tragic<br />
campaign because here, as we know, four successive lines<br />
of 150 men went over the top here up to heavily fortified<br />
Turkish lines and they knew, when they went over the top<br />
what their fate was. The first line of 150 was mown<br />
down, second line went and the same thing. Questions<br />
were raised about whether the third or fourth line were<br />
going, but they went and each man involved knew what<br />
awaited him. As Peter was saying, they took their<br />
wedding rings off and hung them on the nails in the<br />
trenches and left their messages behind because they knew<br />
that they were going to almost certain death. Out of the<br />
600 that went across, as I recall, something only like<br />
to 60 of them emerged not either killed or wounded and to<br />
no avail.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can you talk to us about how<br />
the Thatcher talks went?<br />
PM: No, we covered the globe really. Very interested to<br />
share her thinking and her meeting with George Bush about<br />
the situation in Eastern Europe, the pressures upon the<br />
Soviet Union, particularly in regard to the Baltic<br />
States. I don't want to go to the, the details, but I<br />
was very pleased to hear what she had to say and there<br />
was congruence of thinking as far as we were concerned on<br />
that issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about South Africa<br />
PM: Yes, we did talk about that and we agreed that the<br />
changes that were, had been made by President de Klerk<br />
were significant, but more had to be done and we had a<br />
serious discussion about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, was Gallipoli a wasted<br />
exercise that Australia better off without it?<br />
PM: Well countries would always, in a sense, be better<br />
off without war and the death that goes with war. But<br />
given the fact that we were at war, the decision had been<br />
taken to have the Dardanelles campaign, a decision as so<br />
often in those early days, was made not within Australia<br />
but in England. Given that that decision was taken and<br />
that Australian troops were committed to it, it was a<br />
campaign that from the beginning had no chance of<br />
victory. Very interesting if you read the history. I've<br />
had access through a number of articles I've read to the<br />
minutes of the imperial war cabinet, it's quite clear<br />
that Kitchener believed that it was a futile exercise.<br />
He was against it from the beginning and he said that if<br />
it were to be undertaken you would need at least 200,000<br />
troops and of course all that they were given was 70,000,<br />
so it was mission impossible, in that sense, from the </p>
<p>beginning. And you must remember that the furthest point<br />
of entry into the Peninsula was made on the first day,<br />
they never got further than they did on the first day.<br />
It was an heroic containment exercise with no chance of<br />
achieving the objective. Now within that rather hopeless<br />
strategic framework it was nevertheless a glorious<br />
chapter in Australia's nationhood because, as I've said,<br />
if you read the, what was written at the time by the men<br />
themselves, and they were prolific writers, fascinating<br />
to see how much they did write and they themselves said<br />
that no longer were they just West Australians or<br />
Queenslanders, they regarded this exercise as the making<br />
of Australia and the making of Australians. And we, we<br />
pride ourselves on the concept of mateship in Australia<br />
and there is no doubt that here in Gallipoli where eight<br />
and a half thousand Australians laid down their lives,<br />
the concept of mateship was transfigured from just a<br />
concept into a flesh and blood reality. Now how do you<br />
measure those things? You can't say those things are all<br />
waste. Waste of life was shocking but given the<br />
inevitability of the exercise in which they were engaged,<br />
great, great things came out of it for our country I<br />
believe.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any one moment or incident in the<br />
day that will stand out in your memory do you think?<br />
PM: There are many. I think perhaps in a sense the most<br />
moving was seeing those two old veterans, the Turkish<br />
veteran, I think, was 102 I think he was the one I was<br />
told was 102-years of age and old Jack the man who has<br />
been kissing Hazel around Australia, in Perth, in Sydney<br />
and wherever he could in Turkey, he was there and here<br />
were these two old enemies exchanging uniforms, embracing<br />
one another. As I say to see the enemies of yesterday<br />
become the comrades of today that was a very moving<br />
experience. But in another sense I find it difficult to<br />
have a more meaning experience to be here and to have<br />
General Peterson going over with me the events of the<br />
Necks. As I said, I think here we are standing on what<br />
was really the most tragic part of a tragic campaign,<br />
those 600 young Australians had no chance and they knew<br />
they had no chance but over they went.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, 75 ago maybe think about where<br />
we would be in another seventy five years a<br />
Republican system?<br />
PM: Should we what?<br />
JOURNALIST: Should we look toward a Republic<br />
PM: Those thoughts didn't come into my mind. The one<br />
thing. that I am certain of is that we should be the<br />
masters of our own destiny. We went through two world<br />
wars in which for too many important parts of those two<br />
world wars we were the masters of our own destiny. But<br />
now we must realise that while we have friends and allies </p>
<p>we must both develop the capacity to defend ourselves but<br />
also make sure that in the conduct of our affairs that we<br />
are the masters of our own destiny, that where we commit<br />
ourselves that it's by our own decision and not by the<br />
decision of others.<br />
JOURNALIST: We have this remarkable relationship between<br />
Australia and Turkey, Prime Minister, I imagine you would<br />
like to see the same sort of relationship between<br />
Australia and Japan?<br />
PM: Well the relationship between Australia and Japan<br />
doesn't come as easily now because the time of conflict<br />
is closer, but it is very important that we do as far as<br />
we can put those events behind us too because we live in<br />
a world now in 1990, 45 years after the end of the Second<br />
World War which is a world unrecognisably different from<br />
that of the end of the Second World War and the future of<br />
Australia is very much a future bound up with Asia and is<br />
a very important part of that future. And while we will<br />
never forget the tragedy of war and the involvement of<br />
the Japanese in that war, what is certain, as we can be<br />
of anything, is that the future of our children and their<br />
children is going to be very much determined by the<br />
quality of our relationship with Asi'a in general, and to<br />
an extent with Japan in particular, so we must learn how<br />
to work with them and live with them as friends and not<br />
as enemies.<br />
JOURNALIST: Another question on South Africa, Prime<br />
Minister. Do you expect that sanctions will be eased at<br />
the forthcoming Commonwealth Foreign Ministers Meeting?<br />
PM: No I think that what will happen at that May meeting<br />
of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers on South Africa<br />
meeting is that they will undertake the most up to date<br />
review of what is happening in South Africa and they will<br />
S wfiilrls, t lyI bweelliceovmee-thbee wcahnatnignegs ttoh ats eeh avfeu rtbheeern mchaadneg ebsu. t they<br />
You've got to remember that the four pillars of<br />
apartheid, the four legislative pillars of apartheid<br />
could variate the Population Act, the Land Act the<br />
Separate Amenities Act, those four pillars of apartheid<br />
are still in place. Now I was one of the first to<br />
recognise and to welcome the significance of the changes<br />
that have been signalled by President de Klerk but he has<br />
got to go further and it was rather disappointing the<br />
other day where he seemed to go so far in terms of<br />
talking about one vote one value but then, at the end,<br />
had this phrase which said we will never allow majority<br />
rule. Now that was something which didn't sit with what<br />
he had said before or with what the world requires of<br />
South Africa so we must put the pressures upon de Klerk,<br />
make him recognise that he has his own difficulties in<br />
South Africa. He has his extremists on the right that he<br />
has to deal with, so we have to walk this difficult line<br />
of recognising the significance of the changes that he<br />
has -made but also demanding that those changes must lead<br />
inevitably and logically to the position of one person, </p>
<p>a one vote, one value in which it will be possible for the<br />
black majority to rule. But at the same time as we're<br />
working for that we must be impressing upon our black<br />
African friends that it is in their interests and in the<br />
interest of South Africa and in the interest of the<br />
region and in the interest of the world that, as we move<br />
to the possibility of black majority rules, that they<br />
should recognise the contribution that white South<br />
Africans can make to the future of a free South Africa<br />
and that is going to require not prejudice and rhetoric<br />
but hard work.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you still at odds though with Margaret<br />
Thatcher on the issue of sanctions.<br />
PM: Oh Mrs Thatcher made it quite clear really that she<br />
would prefer to see either no sanctions or limited<br />
sanctions and she would be wanting to lift them, those<br />
that are there, faster than others. But we are at one at<br />
wanting to see a democratic, racially tolerant South<br />
Africa and we will differ on the means and the pace on<br />
getting there but the Commonwealth as a whole I think<br />
will have the view that I've just expressed. </p>
