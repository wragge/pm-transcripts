<p>Your Excellency, President Scalfaro; to your daughter, Marianna;</p>
<p>   Excellencies; my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues; ladies</p>
<p>   and gentlemen.</p>
<p>When we spoke in my office this morning I said to the President</p>
<p>   that the relationship between Australia and Italy was one of those</p>
<p>   things that brought an instant smile to the face. And that best</p>
<p>   described as I could the very deep links and the very enduring links</p>
<p>   that exist not only between our two countries on a political and</p>
<p>   economic level but also between the Australian people and the Italian</p>
<p>   people. Against that background, sir, and also because of your own</p>
<p>   very long and distinguished political career in Italy, you are especially</p>
<p>   welcome amongst us today.</p>
<p>This is a very large and spontaneously gathered group of Australians</p>
<p>   and friends of Italy who want to pay tribute to you and to your</p>
<p>   country and to pay tribute to the influence that the Italian way</p>
<p>   has had on our country and on many other nations throughout the</p>
<p>   world.</p>
<p>You have been active in Italian politics since 1946. You were a</p>
<p>   deputy between 1948 and 1992. You were a member of the original</p>
<p>   constituent assembly formed in 1946 and you've now served,</p>
<p>   for six years, as President of your country. You therefore come</p>
<p>   to Australia with a very long and distinguished background and a</p>
<p>   person through all of your political career has remained steadfast</p>
<p>   and true to those values that you regard as important in public</p>
<p>   life and those values that you hold dear and you have, therefore,</p>
<p>   had a long and very distinguished commitment to Italy and to the</p>
<p>   Italian people.</p>
<p>Italy, the modern Italy, is of course the sixth largest economy</p>
<p>   in the world. Particularly in recent years it has enjoyed an enormous</p>
<p>   economic resurgence. It is playing a very strong role in the European</p>
<p>   Union and the strength of its economy and the commitment of its</p>
<p>   people enables it to do that. And therefore this is an occasion</p>
<p>   to remark, as Prime Minister of Australia, on the importance of</p>
<p>   the economic and political association between our two nations.</p>
<p>But it also, importantly, an occasion for me to pay tribute to</p>
<p>   the enormous contribution that Italians have made, particularly</p>
<p>   to post-World War II Australia. Australians of Italian background</p>
<p>   comprise of course the largest non-English speaking tributary to</p>
<p>   the modern Australian nation. More than a million Australians claim</p>
<p>   an Italian heritage and they do it with great pride and great passion.</p>
<p>Italians have contributed to every facet of Australian life. The</p>
<p>   most important contribution they have made is the way in which they</p>
<p>   have reinforced so many of the important values of the Australian</p>
<p>   community. It is impossible to think of the Italian contribution</p>
<p>   to our nation without thinking of their great and passionate commitment</p>
<p>   to the importance of the family unit as the central pillar of a</p>
<p>   cohesive society. It is impossible not to think of their enormous</p>
<p>   enthusiasm and energy. It is impossible to conceive the story of</p>
<p>   post-war Australia without the Italian contribution and the Italian</p>
<p>   way playing a very, very important part in that story. The contribution</p>
<p>   that Australians of Italian descent have made of course is to be</p>
<p>   found in every part of the Australian life. </p>
<p>One thinks of great figures such as Sir James Gobbo. And if ever</p>
<p>   a person celebrated the marvellous integration of the Australian</p>
<p>   and the Italian way, nobody has done it better than Sir James Gobbo,</p>
<p>   a person who served as a distinguished lawyer, a distinguished Judge</p>
<p>   and is now the Governor of Victoria.</p>
<p>One thinks of the enormous contribution in the field of business.</p>
<p>   One thinks of the families that are represented here today - the</p>
<p>   Grollo family from Victoria, very much in the news yesterday; the</p>
<p>   Belgiorno-Nettis family that has made also an enormous contribution</p>
<p>   to engineering and construction in Australia. And I don't suppose</p>
<p>   in a way anybody has made such an impact on the world of fashion</p>
<p>   in her own inimitable style than Carla Zampatti who I'm delighted</p>
<p>   to welcome here today.</p>
<p>And of course no reference to contributions to the Australian way</p>
<p>   would be complete without touching, however briefly, upon the contribution</p>
<p>   of sports men and women. And we're very proud that Christian</p>
<p>   Vieri, the Sydneysider, was Italy's top goal scorer before</p>
<p>   regrettably Italy was eliminated. And I've got to say to you,</p>
<p>   Mr President, that there was many an Australian heart that was with</p>
<p>   Italy from the very beginning of the World Cup because Australia</p>
<p>   was not, itself, a competitor in the final rounds. And of course</p>
<p>   another great sporting name, David Campese, to those of us who are</p>
<p>   great rugby followers. And he brought many a cheer to Australian</p>
<p>   rugby followers with his particular flair. </p>
<p>And of course it wouldn't be appropriate for me to make these</p>
<p>   sorts of references seeing that it's a political gathering</p>
<p>   without of course acknowledging the contribution of Australians</p>
<p>   of Italian descent to the politics of our nation. And I'm delighted</p>
<p>   to say that, in terms of current Federal parliamentary representation,</p>
<p>   it's fairly even-handed. And I know you had the opportunity</p>
<p>   of meeting a number of both Government and Opposition members before</p>
<p>   this luncheon to exchange views and to share some ideas. And of</p>
<p>   course outside parliamentary politics it's very interesting</p>
<p>   that my own party, the State Directors of the two largest divisions</p>
<p>   in New South Wales and Victoria, in the person of Remo Nogarotto</p>
<p>   and Peter Poggioli, are both of Italian descent and I understand</p>
<p>   that the State Director of the Labor Party, John Della Bosca in</p>
<p>   New South Wales, is also of Italian descent. And can I also say</p>
<p>   that there is one other political figure in the history of Australia</p>
<p>   who, although not a member of Parliament, probably influenced the</p>
<p>   course of post-war Australia politics more than many other Australian</p>
<p>   parliamentarians and that was the late BA Santamaria whose influence</p>
<p>   on Australian politics was absolutely immense.</p>
<p>I mention these things, ladies and gentlemen, to simply remind</p>
<p>   people of the enormous role that Australians of Italian descent</p>
<p>   have played in our nation and of how they are so completely part</p>
<p>   of the Australian story. And the personal experiences of all of</p>
<p>   us and our contact with Italians goes back, in most cases, to our</p>
<p>   childhood. Certainly my first contact with the warmth and the enthusiasm</p>
<p>   and the love of life and the commitment to family and the commitment</p>
<p>   to the future of this country, my first contact was naturally with</p>
<p>   Australians who come from Italy. But I also remember, with great</p>
<p>   affection, my first visit to Italy in 1964, long before I entered</p>
<p>   politics, where I had the great good fortune to meet Father Borelli,</p>
<p>   the Catholic Priest, who cared for the urchin children of Naples</p>
<p>   and who was the subject of that very famous book written by Morris</p>
<p>   West and titled ÂChildren of the Sun'. And that particular</p>
<p>   experience, as somebody undertaking a working holiday in Europe,</p>
<p>   brought me into contact with the warmth and the enthusiasm of the</p>
<p>   Italian people in their own country.</p>
<p>So, sir, you've come here as the honoured, indeed, the revered</p>
<p>   President of a country with whom we have a very close economic and</p>
<p>   political association. Italy is playing a very constructive role</p>
<p>   within the European Union and the European family. But you also</p>
<p>   come here today as a reminder to all of us of the celebration and</p>
<p>   the miracle that is post-World War II Australia, the way in which</p>
<p>   we have been able to gather from the four corners of the world,</p>
<p>   so many men and women who made a massive contribution to building</p>
<p>   a very proud nation, a nation that is playing a very positive role,</p>
<p>   particularly in our own region. But a nation that remembers its</p>
<p>   roots and honours the contributions that are made to the modern</p>
<p>   existence and the modern identity. And the Italian contribution</p>
<p>   has been quite massive. It has been incalculable. It has made Australia</p>
<p>   a better country. It has helped to make Australia a more open society.</p>
<p>   It has brought us into contact with ways and attitudes that have</p>
<p>   made us better, made us warmer and made us more comprehending and</p>
<p>   more understanding.</p>
<p>I want to, on behalf of everybody here today, honour the Italian</p>
<p>   contribution. It's a very important part of the collective</p>
<p>   Australian heritage. And to you, sir, and to your daughter and to</p>
<p>   the other members of your party, I bid you a very warm welcome.</p>
<p>   I know that you have already been very warmly received in Victoria.</p>
<p>   I can assure you that you will be received with equal warmth in</p>
<p>   Sydney and in other parts of Australia that you will visit. I hope</p>
<p>   you will come again. I wish you good fortune and good health. I</p>
<p>   honour your country and I thank you for visiting us. I now invite</p>
<p>   the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, to support my remarks.</p>
