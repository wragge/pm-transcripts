-JJA. USRLA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 MARCH 1988<br />
I am delighted that Her Majesty The Queen and His Royal<br />
Highness The Duke of Edinburgh have accepted my invitation<br />
on behalf of the Australian Government and people to visit<br />
Australia as part of our Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
The Queen and Prince Philip will arrive in Australia in<br />
Perth on Tuesday 19 April and depart Australia from Canberra<br />
on Tuesday 10 may.<br />
They will visit Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria,<br />
Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT.<br />
Highlights of the tour will be the opening of the new<br />
Parliament House in Canberra on Monday 9 may, the opening of<br />
World Expo ' 88 in Brisbane on 30 April, the opening of the<br />
Stockman's Hall of Fame and Outback Heritage Centre in<br />
Longreach on 29 April, and attendance at * 1he Anzac Day<br />
ceremonies in Hobart on 25 April.<br />
The visit will see Her Majesty and His Royal Highness<br />
travelling to a number of regional and outback centres such<br />
as Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Launceston, Geelong, Longreach and<br />
Albury. Further details will be announced separately by the relevant<br />
State Premiers.<br />
Between them, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh and The<br />
Prince of Wales will visit all States and Territories during<br />
our Bicentenary.<br />
It is especially appropriate that The Queen, as Queen of<br />
Australia, and The Duke of Edinburgh share in our<br />
Bicentennial celebrations and I know they will be given a<br />
warm welcome by all Australians during their tour. 005077 </p>
