PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW BETWEEN BRIAN WHITE ( 2UE) AND PRIME<br />
MINISTER, BOB HAWK~ E.<br />
21 MARCH 1990<br />
E 03 PROOF ONLY<br />
WHITE: And nov we come to the second of our election interviews,<br />
once again being broadcast to quite a number of stations around<br />
Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales, as well as MRE.<br />
I welcome once again to 2HD, 2MCI 2RE, 2RG, 2SSS, 4124, 5CS and<br />
Welcome to you and your listeners. Now my guest the Leader<br />
of the Labor Party, Bob Hawke, the Prime Minister, sitting<br />
opposite me in the studio, having flown up from Canberra, where<br />
at lunch time he addressed the National Press Club, as Andrew<br />
Peacock did yesterday. The first question to you, the same one<br />
that I gave to Andrew Peacock. As brief ly as you can, can you<br />
tell us what is the main reason why Australians should vote for<br />
you on Saturday?<br />
PMI Because I have gone directly to the people and not fsimply<br />
said what I will do, but how I will do it. I've answered eve~ ry<br />
question that's been put to me. What I've said I will do is to<br />
continue economic growth, employment growth, continue to create a<br />
more competitive Australian economy, increase our exports, and<br />
also continue to protect our environment and to increase social<br />
justice in our country so that there is a greater equality of<br />
opportunity for the people of this country. Now, I've explained<br />
how I will do that by having a wages policy which is predictable.<br />
If you can't have a wages policy which will tell both employees<br />
and bosses what the wages outcome is going to be, then you can't<br />
run the economy. Mr Peacock has openly said he doesn't know what<br />
the wages outcome will be. Everyone else knows it will be a<br />
wal-s explosion. The second thing is, I have before I started<br />
this campaign sat down, found savings and then fully funded<br />
every promise I have made for the Australian people. Mr Peacock<br />
has got an unfunded bribe of between six and seven billion<br />
dollars and now two days before the election hasn't told the<br />
Australian people how he will find the money for those promigies.<br />
That must blow our surplus. And with the wages explosion and the<br />
busting of the budget surplus, you will have interest rates going<br />
through the roof. And, as I say, I will continue, as I havo in<br />
seven years, to ensure that I accept the obligation to this and </p>
<p>future generations to protect the environment of this country,<br />
On every major decision I've taken, Brian, thie saving of the<br />
Franklin, saving the Daintree from being logged, saving the<br />
Kakadu from being mined, saving the Tall Forests of Tasmania on<br />
every one of those, Mr Peacock, the Liberals and National Party<br />
have opposed me.<br />
WHITEt Now one thing that arises as a thought out of your<br />
answer, is that this is a very presidential campaign, isn't it?<br />
I mean, is it Bob Hawke versus Andrew Peacock? I mean why has<br />
Labor, for example, chosen to make it a one man campaign?<br />
P14: Well, I guess because they've got confidence in their<br />
Leader. I have supported the whole of the Labor Party every<br />
one of my Ministers is one hundred percent behind me, supports me<br />
and trusts me. That is not the position with the Liberal Party.<br />
just let me give you an example, which happened just last week.<br />
The most remarkable thing that occurred on a radio programme down<br />
Sin Melbourne, with Don Chipp. Don Chipp had John Howard on his<br />
Wprogramme and he asked him a question about whether he believed<br />
Andrew Peacock saying that he, Andrew Peacock, didn't know until<br />
two days before that he was going to knock Howard off? And Don<br />
put the question to him quite frankly, and Howard gave the<br />
answer. And what Chippy said was well, there's only one<br />
inference you can draw from the reply, John, and that is that you<br />
don't believe Mr Peacock. I mean, when you've got a Coalition<br />
like that where the senior members don't trust one another, when<br />
they know that Ur Peacock can't handle economic questions, then<br />
what you get is a range of people being put up Dr Hewson, Kr<br />
Howard, Andrew Peacock. In my case, the party and all my<br />
Ministers totally trust me. They know that if there's questions<br />
about economics, they don't have to put someone else up. That I<br />
can handle it.<br />
WHITE: You did, of course, originally come to office after a,<br />
coup against Bill Hayden<br />
PMt Yeah, but I didn't get up and say, as Kr Peacock did, that<br />
I didn't know anything about it until two days before when I wast<br />
drafted. I mean, I didn't have a situation where I had one of my<br />
senior colleagues, like Kr Howard, giving an answer which, if<br />
interpreted correctly, as saying I don't believe what Mr<br />
Peacock's saying. Everyone knew what I was about.<br />
WH ITE: Would you agree that if the Coalition did have the sort<br />
of, well how can I put this? if it appeared to the public t~ o<br />
have its act really together, that they'd do you like a dinner?<br />
PM: N~ o, I don't accept that they'd do us like a dinner. I mean,<br />
it's like saying that if someone was differently constituted,<br />
they'd be a different sex. I mean the fact is that the<br />
Opposition is constituted the way they are. Constituted of a </p>
<p>group of people in the Liberal Party who haven't accepted the<br />
obligation of Opposition. Opposition is a hard job and the Labor<br />
Party learnt it. We got dealt with in my Judgementappropriately<br />
by the electorate for a long time. While the,<br />
electorate looked at the Labor Party and said you're so busy<br />
fighting yourself as we did, vigorously the electorate just:<br />
said, sorry, Labor Party, until you can govern yourself, you're<br />
not going to get the job of governing the country. Now that's<br />
the reality. And it's no good talking about it. The reality 1i3<br />
that the Liberal Party has spent more time swapping and changing<br />
leaders since I became Prime Minister I mean, I met in 1983,<br />
Malcolm Fraser. So it was made clear to him that he had to go.<br />
Then they put in Andrew Peacock. So then they spend their time<br />
dumping him and putting John Howard in. Then they spend all all<br />
t-heir energy dumping Howard and putting Peacock back In. But they<br />
haven't done the hard work of getting their policies together.<br />
And then so within the Liberal Party, they despise and detest<br />
one another and then you've got the tensions between the Liberal<br />
Party and the National Party.<br />
WHITE: Right. Now...,<br />
PM: That's what they are. I mean, you can't say well what if<br />
they were different. I mean that's who they are.<br />
WHITE: Yeah. But you're not saying that if they were different<br />
you wouldn't be done like a dinner?<br />
PM: Well, I'd be entitled to say if they were different then<br />
something else might different might have happened. We<br />
mightn't have had the collapse in the terms of trade in 1985/ 8B6<br />
which brought about certain economic results. I mean, it's not a<br />
very, you know, rewarding game saying if something was different<br />
on their side.....<br />
WHITE: No. Well, today speaking of the economy we've got<br />
these figures out that show our gross domestic product is on the<br />
decline, yet this is essentially being seen as good news for the<br />
economy. Now, surely that's turning language on its ear when the<br />
product of a country is going down?<br />
PM: No, of course it isn't. Because what we think.... you can't<br />
have it both ways.. I mean, I don't say you, Brian, I mean it<br />
can't be had both ways by people. What we were faced with ii. a<br />
situation where we had to bring in tighter monetary policy<br />
because we had this gap a four percent gap. I mean, I'm riot<br />
speaking in economic jargon. We, in this country, were consuming<br />
four percent more than we were producing. So we had to have high<br />
interest rates to close that gap. And what the figures show now<br />
is that the gap has been closed. And that's why the banks and the<br />
commentators are now saying that interest rates can come off. We<br />
had to get this slowing down so that you could take off interest </p>
<p>rates, and of course, you know, fortunately* we've got the<br />
comments on the Reuters screen last night. Traders said that<br />
credit marks at the end of the day ( inaudible) in anticipation of<br />
a further easing in monetary policy in the next few weeks. As I<br />
said, assuming the Hawke Labor Government is re-elected in<br />
Saturday's federal election. In other words what they're saying<br />
is evidence is showing that the policy to bring our consumption<br />
and our production into line is working. And what's happening,,<br />
fortunately, is that we will not get the recession because of<br />
this because what's happening is our production is now being<br />
channelled into net exports s.<br />
WHITE: Yeah. But we still have a situation where while<br />
consumption might have come down, so has production. How can i~ t<br />
be a good thing for production to have come down?<br />
PM: Production, in fact, for the year shows an increase<br />
of.-.. I'll give you the figure 4.2 percent growth in GDP over<br />
the course of whole of 1989.<br />
WHITE: Yep.<br />
P14: t We're still getting we've got a situation where in fact<br />
it showed a 0.2 decline for the quarter, but what you've got to<br />
understand in these statistics is a thing called a statistical<br />
discrepancy, which detracted 0.9 percent 0.9 percent, which<br />
is the wild figure. It may well be that when the corrections are<br />
made, as they are, in subsequent quarters, that you will find, in<br />
fact, that there was a positive figure for this quarter, but....<br />
WHITE: Sure, it could go the other way.<br />
PM: Yeah, yeah. But what I'm saying is that what we should be<br />
pleased about, as the markets are, is that what we set out to do<br />
is working. we're slowing things dow'n.... slowing them down in a<br />
way which is directing our production into net exports which is<br />
exactly what we've got to do. What we can guarantee, and wihat<br />
the market is saying, is that if Labor is re-elected on Saturday,<br />
then you'll have the conditions for a lowering of interest rates<br />
and growth in the economy. That's what the markets are saying<br />
here and overseas. I mean, it's not only what's being said in<br />
Australia, but it's being said overseas as well.<br />
WVLITEV: In my discussion with Andrew Peacock earlier, I quoted<br />
one overseas case to him which was the British budget out to&amp; Lay-<br />
Let me quote another overseas case to you. The American<br />
economist, J X Galbraith, he said some time ago, and he was<br />
actually referring to Britain, that when you have high interest<br />
rates, the rich people lend to the poor people and make a lot of<br />
money out of doing so and the gap between the rich and poor gets<br />
wider and wider. Now isn't that exactly what's been happening<br />
here? </p>
<p>PM: It is not. The opposite is happening here. The<br />
opposite.... WHITE: Not at the moment ( inaudible).<br />
PM1 Let me tell you....<br />
WHITEs In this period of high interest tates are you saying to<br />
me that the rich haven't been getting richer and the poor getting<br />
poorer? PH: I'm saying that under my Government the gap between the rich<br />
and the poor has been reduced. Why? Because we've had a<br />
taxation policy which has meant that the rich are now paying tax<br />
where they weren't before. Just let me give you one quote,<br />
Brian, one quote. This is not Labor Party policy, or, you know<br />
Labor Party spokesman, this is what is said at the end of the<br />
last period of government, this is by Professor Russell<br />
Mathews, the Australian National University, foremost fiscal<br />
authority, said the essential problem is to make the rich pay any<br />
income tax at all. Why did he say that? Basically because there<br />
wasn't a capital gains tax. And what we have done is now to<br />
remove that obscenity from the Australian scene where it is a<br />
question of getting the rich to pay any income tax at all because<br />
we've introduced a capital gains tax. And Mr Peacock by two<br />
propositions is proposing to return to that situation of the past<br />
of clothing the rich at the expense of the poor. Firstly, by<br />
abolishing the capital gains tax. The absence of which was the<br />
very reason that Professor Mathews said that the essential<br />
problem was to get the rich to pay any tax at all. The second<br />
thing just how do you like this? About Mr Peacock';<br />
proposal on the tax front, What he's proposing is a new two<br />
tier tax system. And this is his concept of fairness. Here are<br />
the f igures. A two tier tax system. Shovel it back into the<br />
prof its of the rich. For a person on $ 17,000 a year, the tax cut:<br />
he's proposing would be twenty cents a week. For a person at tho<br />
level of average weekly earnings of about $ 28,000, it will be a<br />
cut of $ 4.73 a week. Do you know what it would be for Peacock ais<br />
Prime Minister? Over $ 100 a week. Now that's the concept of<br />
fairness in tax of Mr Peacock. Abolish the capital gains tax to<br />
restore the situation that the Liberals imposed upon this country<br />
where it was a question of choice as to whether the rich paid any<br />
tax--at all. And secondly, if they re-arrange the tax system,<br />
he'll shove $ 100 a week,... more than $ 100 a week into his own<br />
pocket, and $ 4.00 a week for the average bloke.<br />
WHITE: Right. Well now, if I can move to wages, and of the<br />
accord which you've already brought up yourself. Labor I s<br />
obviously terribly proud of the way which the accord has held<br />
down wage levels. But could I put it to you that in a sense our<br />
whole industrial relations scene has not moved with the times? </p>
<p>That it's not it's become almost upside down today in that,<br />
for example, if good workers in the business want a pay rise, the<br />
normal way that they have to act in to go to their union firsts<br />
the union might then go to the Industrial Relations Commission ox<br />
wherever, but at no stage does the worker group of workers go<br />
to the employer.<br />
PM: Well, it's simply not the case. We have the situation under<br />
the current industrial relations system, that there is enterprise<br />
bargaining. It's happening.<br />
WHITUt It's starting to.<br />
PM: It's happened very significantly. Very significantly<br />
indeed. And we have, however, in the interests of the economy,<br />
two guarding mechanisms in it, if you like, that agreements for<br />
m~ e to be subject to the ( inaudible) of the... and the guidance of<br />
the Industrial Relations Commission, so that national aggregate<br />
outcomes are guarded... you don't get a return to the beginning of<br />
the 80' s when you had a wages explosion in the worst recession<br />
for fifty years. And secondly, the ( inaudible) union council also<br />
is keeping a watch on seeing that you don't get massive wage-s<br />
outbreaks. The simple fact is that it's only as a result of our<br />
industrial relations practices that we are moving in the times.<br />
Look at what happened yesterday. The Metal Trades Award. For<br />
yonks for decades you've had a situation of this critically<br />
important award in the manufacturing industry the Metal Trades<br />
Award had three hundred and sixty different classifications<br />
reflecting the ( inaudible) and the relevancies of fifty, sixty,<br />
seventy, eighty years ago. Now, as a result of our processes,<br />
that's been scrapped and instead of three hundred and sixty<br />
classifications, fourteen... fourteen classifications which now<br />
means that you can have proper training and re-training and<br />
promotion and a whole structure of relations which is relevant to<br />
the most modern technology. Now that's what our system has<br />
produced. Plus, a sixty percent reduction a sixty percent<br />
reduction in industrial disputes..<br />
WHITEt Many economic commentators not the journalists from<br />
Canberra have been saying that the best hope for this country<br />
is that whoever wins on Saturday will drop their promises if they<br />
have to, to do what just has to be done which is in their viLew<br />
critical surgery.<br />
PM: No, I haven't seen anyone who said that they hope that our<br />
promises will be dropped for the simple reason that everyone of<br />
my promises is funded. You see....<br />
WHITE: It's not so much the fact that they're f unded but the<br />
problems are going to be so critical that whatever you can fund<br />
at the moment, you might not be able to fund </p>
<p>PM: Let's look at how absurd that proposition is of ever putting<br />
it. what was one of the centrally important promises that I've<br />
made to commitment? it is to create fifty centres co-operative<br />
centres of scientific excellence in this country, which will<br />
bring together the best research capacity of the CSIRO and<br />
universities and industries which will put Australia at the<br />
leading edge of technology in a whole range of areas which will<br />
then be used to transfer into new production. New productive<br />
processes. Now, I couldn't think of anything more obscenely<br />
irrelevant and absurd. Brian, now you're not saying... you were<br />
saying other people were saying that that proposition should be<br />
dropped. I mean if there is one thing that Australia's got to0<br />
do, as I've said in the policy speech, we've got to become the<br />
clever country. We're not going to become the clever country by<br />
accident. We've got to get these centres of excellence. Cooperation<br />
between the CSIRO, the universities, and industry, Now<br />
for anyone to suggest that we should drop those proposals , that<br />
I should drop the proposal to help parents to keep their kids on<br />
at school, to meet the obscenity that I inherited in 1983, where<br />
after seven years of conservatives we still only had one in three<br />
of our kids staying on in school, now we've got nearly two In<br />
three of our kids staying on In school and I've committed through<br />
finding interest savings to pay money to the parents of these<br />
kids. Twice a year at the relevant time so it's going to be<br />
easier to keep them on at school. And to suggest that we should<br />
drop those things.... x mean, I've never heard anything more<br />
absurd. WHITrE: Let me put to you an aspect of that. That Australian<br />
Governments have been trying for years to get better performance<br />
out of Australian manufacturers, John Button was almost at the<br />
point of despair in the middle of last year with one burst he<br />
had. Why do our manufacturers, do you think, fail to perform at<br />
the sort of peaks that we've now become accustomed to heariLng<br />
about from Japan, and Korea and Taiwan, and so on.<br />
PM Oh, come on. Stop knocking our country.<br />
WHITEs I'm not knocking our country. I am wondering why our<br />
country.. PM: Well, let me give you the answer....<br />
VMITEs We aren't having the kind of manufacturing boom that's<br />
become commonplace in Asia.<br />
PM: Brian, let me tell you what's happening. Rather than<br />
embracing this gloom and doom, knock your country concept that<br />
typifies Peacock. Let's look at the statistics facts not<br />
prejudices, facts. In the last four years, a 54 percent increase<br />
in manufactured exports. We are now a country which, when I came<br />
to office, was going to close its steel industry, after the </p>
<p>lease. Now, we have a steel induatry, which in this last year has<br />
exported three quarters of a billion dollars worth of steel<br />
around the world. Has become one of the world's most competitive<br />
steel exporters. Within the next three years as a result of what<br />
they're doing, their own investment and a great new co-operation<br />
they have between management and the workforce, an enormous<br />
increase in productivity, are going to treble treble their<br />
exports of steel in all the most competitive markets to over two<br />
billion dollars. </p>
<p>We are now exporting cars and car parts to Japan and the<br />
United States. I went to a factory some time ago in<br />
Adelaide. This factory an enterprise in the suburbs of<br />
Adelaide is making optical lenses. In the United<br />
States market, as I say, the toughest market in the<br />
world, with 12 to 13 other competitors, this Adelaide<br />
enterprise has got more than 50% of the United States<br />
market. Now this is what Australian manufactures in<br />
steel, in motor vehicles, optical lenses, pharmaceuticals<br />
we are now exporting in the toughest market that<br />
Australia never did before and why are we doing it,<br />
because under my Government we have had a 12.2% reduction<br />
in non-farm unit labour costs. We now have management<br />
and labour co-operating in a way they never did before.<br />
The Management of BHP said to me when I was up at<br />
Newcastle just a few months ago, under your Government we<br />
now have a revolution, a revolution in industrial<br />
relations. He said our attitude before you came in was<br />
that we used to say to our workers, our attitude was to<br />
them leave your brains at the gate. Now, he said, we<br />
S slip down and talk with them and instead of having to<br />
talk about closing down the steel industry, he said, we<br />
are now taking on the world and beating them. Now those<br />
are facts, not prejudices, not assumptions.<br />
WHITE: Can I take it from that that suggestions that<br />
Labor might lose a few seats in the Hunter Valley and<br />
around Newcastle, you don't think they are likely to<br />
happen? PM: No.<br />
WHITE: Lose to Independents that is.<br />
PM: No.<br />
WHITE: Now on this area that you have just raised with<br />
technology and the like, to some this is a diversion, to<br />
others it is central to the whole future thinking of<br />
S Australia for the next century, but it is also to others<br />
the selling out of Australia and I am talking about the<br />
Multi-Function Polis. Can I ask you to give us your<br />
vision of what the Multi-Function Polis should be?<br />
PM: Sure can. And I will go to the statement of<br />
December 1987 in which we laid down the principles that<br />
were agreed by the Commonwealth and State Governments as<br />
to what should be involved. The first principle said it<br />
should be developed as a way of assisting structural<br />
change in the Australian economy geared towards the<br />
development of an internationally competitive and exportorientated<br />
industry structure. Principle four, this is<br />
December ' 87, I say this in the light of the person you<br />
have just had here in the studio who said he is against<br />
enclaves. Principle four, develop the MFP as an entity<br />
which is not an enclave but is linked with the remainder<br />
of the Australian economy and provides a leading edge<br />
testbed in technology transfer. It was because the </p>
<p>opposition understood these realities, not an enclave,<br />
and that this was something for the importance of<br />
Australia's future, that the opposition the week before<br />
last when asked for their official position on the MFP<br />
said this in the Sydney Morning Herald and I quote them.<br />
This was the Opposition before the opportunism of Mr<br />
Peacock. Quote the proposal is unique for Australia<br />
and deserves extensive consideration. The official<br />
position of the Opposition. Mr Howard that same week,<br />
quote, and he is the Minister, the Shadow Minister who<br />
was not consulted by Mr Peacock when he switched around.<br />
This is Mr Howard I don't think, he said, we should<br />
bury the concept in a sea of hostility before we know<br />
anything about it. Now the fact is that this is not an<br />
enclave, the fact is<br />
WHITE: But it's an entity. What is an entity as against<br />
an enclave? That is what I think ordinary Australians<br />
are trying to struggle their way through understanding.<br />
PM: A place where not one nation comes to Australia with<br />
its technology but any nation from overseas. Thats what<br />
we say not an enclave, not just for Japan. We want to<br />
attract to Australia the best technology from the United<br />
States, North America generally, from Japan and Europe<br />
and this is what has been involved.<br />
WHITE: All to come to this one place?<br />
PM: All to come, because there are great advantages<br />
obviously, if you are going to try and get the best<br />
technology in certain areas of new activity, if they can<br />
have the advantage of being together because they will<br />
interact one with the other. But the important thing is,<br />
as was laid down in ' 87, not an enclave where it would be<br />
open tQ anyone to come there. Will Bailey, the Head of<br />
the ANZ Banking Group, John Elliot, I mean you have heard<br />
of John Elliot, president of the Liberal Party, totally<br />
identified with the concept. Because, if Australia is<br />
going to face the challenge of the future and not be<br />
W just, have this great profile of exposure to mark<br />
variations in prices of commodities for things we grow or<br />
dig up out of the ground, if we're going to be able to<br />
have more manufactured products, more service, then we<br />
have got to get the best technology from overseas. The<br />
way to do this is in co-operation with the business<br />
community. The whole of the Australian business<br />
community has identified-itself with this concept. Every<br />
State Government, including Nick Greiner, they have all<br />
identified with this project<br />
WHITE: There is no question about all that but what we<br />
do have at the moment, what we have always had is a deep<br />
thing in the Australian psyche which ranges between a<br />
dislike to a hatred of the Japanese. For whatever reason<br />
this is how the Multi-Function Polis is being seen by a<br />
large number of people. If you have been listening to,<br />
or if you are aware of things that are being said on </p>
<p>talkback radio around the country that is the story that<br />
is coming across.<br />
PM: What is the responsibility of leadership? The<br />
responsibility of leadership is knowing that there are<br />
these sorts of attitudes. I am not unaware of those<br />
attitudes. The responsibility of leadership was as was<br />
displayed by the Liberal and National Party until last<br />
week. What they said, displaying leadership until last<br />
week, was that the proposal is unique for Australia and<br />
deserves exhaustive consideration. Political leadership<br />
is not about saying look there are some attitudes in the<br />
community which they hate Japanese. There are some<br />
people in the community who hate Americans. There are<br />
some who hate Germans. There are some who hate the Poms.<br />
There are some who hate the French. But the fact of life<br />
is that the Poms, the French, the Germans, the Japanese,<br />
the Americans, all these people are at the leading edge<br />
of technology in industries where if Australia is going<br />
O to take its place in the world we have got to get the<br />
best of their technology. And what had happened in this<br />
country until this last week is right across the<br />
political spectrum, the National Party, the Liberal<br />
Party, the Labor Party, every State Government, big<br />
business, trade unions, they have all identified with<br />
this concept of saying well here's a way, not into an<br />
enclave, but for the best for Australia's kids in the<br />
future to get the best technology you can here. They all<br />
identified with this. Now why, you ask yourself the<br />
question, why is it that about five days out from an<br />
election, six or seven days out from an election after<br />
the Liberal and National Party had identified with this,<br />
after their Federal President had written to Mr Cain<br />
absolutely endorsing the concept, Mr Greiner endorsed the<br />
concept, why is it, six days before an election, why that<br />
six days before an election that Mr Peacock switches.<br />
WHITE: Right. Well let's just in the final few minutes<br />
that you have got bring up a couple of other issues.<br />
There is an old adage about management which says that<br />
two years of the same job is great, after the second lot<br />
of two years you should be thinking about change, two<br />
more years and you should definitely get out. That's six<br />
years. You have been there for seven.<br />
PM: Well like a lot of adages it might be true for some<br />
situations for some people. It is certainly not relevant<br />
for-. the Prime Ministership of this country and<br />
particularly when you look at the alternative. On the<br />
of<br />
WHITE: And with most of your senior Ministers.<br />
PM: All firing, all firing. You look at the<br />
alternative. I mean on the 25th Australia's going to<br />
wake up and its either going to have Bob Hawke as Prime<br />
Minister or its going to have Andrew Peacock for Prime<br />
Minister with Mr Blunt as Deputy Prime Minister. Peacock </p>
<p>and Blunt, Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of<br />
this country. I mean that is what its about. I would<br />
suggest that Dr Hewson got it right back in 1987, let me<br />
quote what he had to say then.<br />
WHITE: This is the one where he<br />
PM: He says the Hawke Government is very professional,<br />
it is probably the best front bench since World War II.<br />
John Hewson got that right and I will line up the talent<br />
of the Hawke Government, and I ask the people of<br />
Australia to line it up and look at the alternatives.<br />
WHITE: Well let's say that you were returned to office<br />
on Saturday with the same numbers, would you be planning<br />
to retain your existing theme or will there be changes<br />
including younger people coming up?<br />
PM: Well I think your listeners might regard it as a bit<br />
presumptuous if now in a couple of days before the<br />
S election I just talked to you in terms that I had won the<br />
election. I think that this election is most important<br />
as I said since 1949. I don't want to really insult your<br />
listeners by saying look it's all over now let's talk<br />
about who is going to be in my Ministry. I think my<br />
responsibility is to fight the election hard up until<br />
Friday night and then if I win, as I hope and expect to,<br />
then it will be an appropriate time to talk about these<br />
things. But I can make this point, that obviously there<br />
will be some vacancies and we have got a lot of talent on<br />
the back bench.<br />
WHITE: One last question. One or two people have<br />
observed to me greatly, including today after your<br />
National Press Club address, that you seem be talking a<br />
bit these days as if you might be coming again to believe<br />
in God, have you? You have always be an agnostic.<br />
PM: No not at<br />
S WHITE: Since I think the<br />
PM: Well no All I said in one inter-view Brian was<br />
this. I am an agnostic not an athiest. I am not<br />
declaring there is not a God. I think it is an act of<br />
intellectual arrogance atheism, to say there is not a<br />
God. WHITE: But you are shifting further towards<br />
PM: I mean I do, I think this is a serious question and<br />
I would like to answer it. I have retained a profound<br />
belief in the basic principles of Christianity. They have<br />
motivated me all my life. But I could not accept that,<br />
you know the I wasn't convinced about that. What I<br />
did say the other day in an interview was simply this and<br />
I have got to speak the truth as it is that I was asked<br />
about the passing of my dad, with whom as you know I was<br />
I </p>
<p>very close indeed. I just said that this thing had<br />
happened not long before he died and had a stroke and the<br />
matron said to me that she'd never seen such a remarkable<br />
recovery. He came back and when he woke up he just said<br />
I can't go yet, Bob needs me. And that was in my mind<br />
and when he did in fact pass away a few days later than<br />
that, I've had this feeling, it is very hard to explain<br />
but I have had this feeling of his presence. Now that is<br />
all I've said and I said I can't explain these things. I<br />
can't intellectualise about it. I can't, I don't try to.<br />
But that is a reality. I just felt this very close<br />
presence and well I haven't really tried to analyse that<br />
and say what it mean. But that was the only thing that<br />
has happened during this campaign which may have made<br />
people this observation I think.<br />
WHITE: In your private moments are you thinking about<br />
him, like this?<br />
PM: I think about him a lot and I think about my mother<br />
a lot. I any conclusion but I just have a sense of<br />
closeness to him, that's all.<br />
WHITE: You don't see yourself, well, getting religion?<br />
PM: No I haven't felt that. I must say without in any<br />
sense I hope it doesn't sound at all, it's not<br />
intended to but I have felt a great sense of comfort<br />
and strength out of this feeling, he's there watching<br />
over my shoulder.<br />
WHITE: Bob, thank you for coming in once again Prime<br />
Minister. Good to see you and the very best of luck for<br />
you on Saturday.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed Brian.<br />
