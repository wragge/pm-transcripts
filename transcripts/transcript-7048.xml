PRIME MINISTER<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MURRAY NICOLL, RADIO 3AW 2 DECEMBER 1986<br />
N. I notice tlhe Herald says you're here electioneering, sharing your smile<br />
with tax-payers, is that what you're doing in Melbourne?<br />
H. Oh, well you always Lake with 75 grains of salt what the Herald says.<br />
No. I guess a PM in that sense is always on the election trail, you're<br />
always trying to tell the story of what your Govt. is doing; expose<br />
) he inadequacies of your oponents. But it's not electioneering in the<br />
sense that thore is 41n electionIaninent.<br />
N. I suppose you're still selling the FBT too aren't you?<br />
H. No, I'm not. ThaL's I think sold, the changes that we made, Murray,<br />
have been very widely accepted, and those changes are now seen as part<br />
of a general tax reform, which is being about significant tax cuts now,<br />
more tax cuts in July, which will bring about overall a much fairer and<br />
more efficient tax system. I don't think there is much of a selling<br />
job Lo be done ' in the FBT now.'<br />
N. r. ric Risstrom says don't expect further tax cuts in July, is he barking<br />
up the wrong tree?<br />
H. Well he's got absolutely no right to say that. The decision of the Govt.<br />
is embodied in legislation and that's why we wanted to make it quite<br />
j1car that it's not simply this December that we're getting a tax cut,<br />
but by ensuring that it goes into legislation it will be there and people<br />
can know and plan on getting the second stage of the tax cuts in July<br />
next year.<br />
N. No doubt aboutIthat at all?<br />
II. No of course there's not.<br />
N. It's been a pretty tough. year for you just looking back on a few of the<br />
issues. This must be about the most rugged you've faced in your<br />
political career?<br />
H. Yes it's been a hard year Murray, but basically tough because of the<br />
groat loss that AusLralia has suffered from the drastic fall in the prices<br />
we get for our exports. And that's as you know lopped about $ 6B off our<br />
National Income and that has meant that responsibly as a Govt. we've<br />
had to take some tough decisions to try and share that around the Aust.<br />
community and then mako the range of decisions whichis going to<br />
put the Australian economy in the best possible position, to take<br />
advantage of the big depreciation in our dollar which makes us more<br />
competitive against imports, more comnetitive on OuvarmAR mrk-i... 1 </p>
<p>2<br />
So we're engaged in a range of decisions which is looking at the medium<br />
to long term to put Australia in the best possible situation for the<br />
future.<br />
N. I think your tax-payers are looking at you saying ' yeah you're biting<br />
the bullet' but they're a little bit concerned as to just how you're<br />
doing it. low you're perceived to be performing publicly?<br />
Ii. Well it's always the case Murray, that when a Govt. has got its head<br />
down ard tackling the very hard problems and making a range of<br />
complicated decisions it's very much easier for your political<br />
opponents and for interest groups in the community to just pick off a<br />
bit here and there and attack you. It takes a time for the whole<br />
package, the whole programme to be seen in its entirity. But that<br />
is emerging and it is being understood and accepted by the community.<br />
I 1 want to say this particularly that I have enormous pride in the<br />
Australian community and that the people who've been asked to accept<br />
sacrifices, and I think particularlyo&amp; he pensioners; I just can't speak<br />
too highly of them, we've delayed the pension increases for 6 weeks<br />
now and 6 weeks in the middle of next year, and they've. just been<br />
fantastic the way they've said ' well we understand, that there've got<br />
Lo be some sacrifices and we're pleased to be part of it'. Now that<br />
has been increasingly understood. You can't, the simple fact is<br />
no country, whether it's Australia or anywhere else, you can't lose<br />
$ 6D of your National Income and then go on as though nothing's happened.<br />
SThe way you're going about things lately, people are saying, and<br />
Gough whitlam is one of them: that'you've lost touch with the electorate,<br />
that the Govt. has forgotten what it's like, and you in particular<br />
at ) P ul Keating in particular, forgotten what it'-s like to live in<br />
the real world?<br />
. Well he and they are wrong, no times are the same as previous times.<br />
I'm not here to comment upon the Whitlam Govt. nor to comment upon his<br />
comments. YodÃ¸~ aht to talk about that? ( Beg your pardon) you don't want to talk<br />
about that?<br />
Well I'm not going to personalise is what I'm saying. If I wanted to<br />
I could obviously talk about his Govt., his economic competence and so on.<br />
But what is gained, what advantage do I do by entering into that. My<br />
job is to say what'we're doing and to make the point that if either<br />
Mr whitlam, or anyone else thinks that you can have the drastic change<br />
In economic, circumstances that have been imposed upon Australia and<br />
then ignore them, then I'm here to say that you can't do that,<br />
That if you lose $ 6B of your National Income that there are tough decisions<br />
that havo to be made. I'll also point to the social ecord of this<br />
l e p , r L. i. </p>
<p>3.-<br />
Govt. which is second to none. We, for instance, you compare, I talked<br />
about pensions a while ago. In the 7 years of the Fraser Govt. the<br />
real increase in the value of pensions was 1 1.5% increase in the real<br />
valuc of the pension. By this month the increase in real value of the<br />
pension under my Govt. will be of the order of And so at a time<br />
when cconomic problems beset this country we've had to make tough<br />
economic decisions, we've made them, we've got the economy into leaner<br />
more efficient shape than it's been before. But we haven't lost sight<br />
of the needs of those people in the conunity who depend upon the rest<br />
of the communiLy for assistance.<br />
I. Gough Whitlam r
reportcd from him, fro Adelaide, wasn't talking about economics, he<br />
was talking more your Labor philosophy. Be says you've gone to water<br />
oi. uman rights: he says that you've distanced yourself from his style<br />
of Govt., that's noL necessarily a bad thing as you point out: and things<br />
such as administraLive fees in tertiary institutions: that sort of thing.<br />
He says that you've gone to water and you're a weak Labor Govt. and<br />
he says the chqnces of you being there next election are not good?<br />
Well I'm not going to enLer into a public debate with Mr Whitlam.<br />
If he believes he is serving the interests of Labor by getting into<br />
that sort of exercise, Lhat's a judgement that he has to make and he<br />
has to live with it. I'm not going to satisfy those who would like<br />
to see some public brawl between Mr. Whitlam and myself, I'm not<br />
going to enter into it.<br />
Okay, somebody. you will want to talk to and about is Allan Border.....<br />
Bc ) er discussion ( who is Border a metaphor for??)<br />
Speaking of lotting it hang out, you've been doing a bit of that<br />
in Federal Parliament lately, with your language, you've copped a bit<br />
for that too. ( Murray I just..) It's true! It's true!<br />
It's just one sentence in a year and I think that it's a bit unkind,<br />
I moan it's like if I watched you in action for a year behind here<br />
and picked out sentence of the year and said that's typical of your<br />
performance, you'd say that's a bit unfair Mr. PM? One sentence.<br />
It was a good sentence though wasn't it?<br />
Oh no no. Well, -it's for you to make a judgement bn whether it's a good<br />
sentence. Just a couple of words slipped out. Look. I take the view<br />
and I think if you look at my performance in the Parliament while I'm<br />
strong in attacking people about their positions, I am not one who<br />
goes into personal attacks, if I attack people it's on the basis of </p>
<p>-4-<br />
positions they've adopted. I don't think the cause of parliamentary<br />
democracy is served by personalised attacks and..<br />
N. Seen a bit of that lately too?<br />
I. Yeah we have, and I don't like it. But as far as language is concerned<br />
I, it's sometimes difficult,! and I think I did lapse a bit there in<br />
that one phrase I mean one likes ttgh atbe colourful, I mean you want to get<br />
attention and so on, and I concede in that particular sentence I think I<br />
nt a bit over the dividing line between colour and what's appropriate. But<br />
I think if you look at my record, I've tried to play my part in the<br />
Parliament in noL descending into vulgarity and into personal abuse.<br />
BeCaUsC I don't think Lhat helps the institution.<br />
N. I'm relieved to hear you say that..<br />
H. Well I believc-it, I'm not saying it because I think it's the right thing<br />
t say, I do believe it. If I make a mistake, I've always in my public<br />
career I've tried to take the view if you make a mistake, it's more<br />
honiest and straightforward to say so.<br />
M. There are reports coming out of Canberra of considerable tension between<br />
you and Paul Keating, are they true?<br />
1. No, the gossip'mongers of this place really amaze me. And talking about<br />
PH loL me just say this again, and I'll get someone right in the sights<br />
on thiu, the National. Times. I've said this before, they are a total<br />
disgrace to journalism. Absolute disgrace. And they will not learn.<br />
I talk with them, afLer I made that attack before, they said ' can we<br />
come and see you'. They caimn and saw me, 1 laid out the details, and<br />
they've done it ugain, this week. I mean the attack they made on the<br />
front page of PK this week in regard to that decision in Chile, saying<br />
tt it had beon done against the advice of Bill Hayden, ( Inaudible word).<br />
Totally untrueunchecked with Keating, and yet there he is he suffers<br />
particularly in these circumstances where he's in the spotlight. NOw<br />
people who pedal these stories without checking them. I mean they<br />
really ought to look in a mirror and examine their conscience. Now<br />
as far as the particular point, the relationship between PK and myself<br />
let me maku it clear. I have enormous respect for the capacity of<br />
Paul. Keating, he's been an integrally important part of tackling the<br />
economic problems of this country. He's applied a fine mind and great<br />
hard work to tackling those problems, including the question of tax<br />
refor,,. Now there's been some misrepresentation of. what I said in the<br />
Parliament, including may I say, Mr Howard couldn't bven when he moved<br />
the censure motion use accurately the language that I used. I said<br />
that what Mr Keating was not of immense consequehce. Now that didn't<br />
carry the implication,-lot me make It quite clear that I didn't, that </p>
<p>5<br />
I thought it wasn't important.<br />
N. That's thu failure to lodge a tax return?<br />
I. It was important the failure. He shouldn't have done it. I said it<br />
couldn't have b6cn condoned. And it couldn't be. It's inexcusable.<br />
But I wanted to make the point that, now let's get some fairness in this<br />
country.<br />
N. You mean fairness to you?<br />
H. No. I mean I'm not talking for myself now because I think by and large<br />
that the people of Australia and the media of Australia are fair to me.<br />
I'm not here. BuL I think there should be a recognition of the<br />
enormous work that Paul Keating has done to face up to the economic<br />
problens of this country. I mean if you look in the area of the floating<br />
o. ) the dollar: the deregulation of the financial sectors the bringing<br />
in of those fanks to make for a more competitive system: the work that<br />
tic's done in the whole area of tax reform. All that is I would think<br />
work og a calibre which when the history books will ( be) written he will<br />
be written up in the front rtiriks of all time quality Treasurers in this<br />
country. Now he made a bad mistake, and I've told him that# he's<br />
acknowledged it, I mean ho acknowledged it without qualification that<br />
it was a mistakc.<br />
I. People don't have the overview though, you see, they just see junk things<br />
happening, they see foolishness and inconsistency and they judge you<br />
by that. And that's what happens.<br />
And people are entitled to be critical of Paul's mistake, and I was<br />
critical to him. But I try and get a balance in these things, I mean<br />
I'...) sure that he will never make that mistake agairt and which of us is<br />
there in this lifc.<br />
Will he be fined for it?<br />
I don't know, the decisions in this matter are totally<br />
a matter for the Commissioner of Taxation, and that's an arms-length<br />
position.<br />
And it's betwccn him and Paul Keating. Purely.<br />
That's right. Let me say this who of us is there, in public life,<br />
who of us is there, who hasn't made a mistake? And I wculd think<br />
some of the mistakes that some people have made arq of greater dimension<br />
than Paul's. Now I'm critical of him. He's critical of himself and he's<br />
going to pay a price for that for some time. But I would have thought<br />
that the Australiun sense of fair play, should say ' okay, Keating you're<br />
wrong, you uwdc a mistake, having said that let's put the whole balance,<br />
lot's look at the hard work, the commitment of this bloke to try and get </p>
<p>a better economy. He's been an important part in the achievement of the<br />
higbcst rate of employment growth in the history of this country.<br />
There are 670,000 Australians, more Australians in jobs now than when<br />
we came to office.<br />
N. Dut you know the public really doesn't take account of that in the<br />
short term?<br />
H. But I think all of us have some responsibility to try and get some<br />
balance in these things. I don't believe I'd be entitled to be listened<br />
to by your listeners seriously, if I just simply came on and said<br />
' look give Paul Keating a fdir go, just leave it at that'. What I<br />
think I am entitled to be heard as saying is ' look, firstly Paul<br />
Keating has made a mistake, it's a bad mistake. Shouldn't have been<br />
done. But I repeat the financial loss is his not the community's.<br />
I -an he's entitled to a refund, as I understand it, he always, he got<br />
the refund before, and so by not putting in the return earlier, it's<br />
meant h hasn't got his refund. Now let's have a pretty fair go. If<br />
we're going to analyse the bloke, put the pluses into the judgement,<br />
I'm simply saying if you look it the balance sheet about PK my View<br />
is that the pluses so very considerably outweigh a significant<br />
minus on this issue.<br />
But people see. hat as a symptom of something that they don't like seeing<br />
happening in politics aL the moment, the general feeling around this<br />
country, if I interpret it correctly, is that they Would dearly love<br />
to soo rederal politicians clean up their act. Get out of the dirt<br />
clanging, got on wiLh the business, I'm not talking Govt. I'm talking<br />
Parliament. And just geL down to business like a Board of Directors,<br />
nc ) likc a bunch of school kids.<br />
Well I don't<br />
Politics is a messy game these days.<br />
I don't find myself dissenting from a view that the Parliament should<br />
lift it's game. I believe that there is too much personalising.<br />
I don't want to be a hypocrite, if a person on the other side says or<br />
dooo something which is wrong, I think that which he says or does,<br />
which is judged to be wrong should be attacked, and attacked strongly,<br />
but I make the distinction between that and attacking the personality,<br />
the individual. And that's why in recent times I've tried to use my<br />
best influence to sce when these sort of things habV arisen that it's<br />
brought to an end. Now, look you don't find me therefore Murray<br />
arguing with you about the desirability of all of us lifting our game.<br />
We all have a responsibility and I think the institution of Parliament<br />
needs to be protected and that's the responsibility of the people in </p>
<p>7-<br />
the Parliamecnt itselfp but let me say this: the responsibility is a<br />
pretty comprehensive thing, I mean if parliamentarians are going to be<br />
continuously subject to abuse and attack then that makes it hard for them.<br />
I think there is a responsibility in the media# for instance, to<br />
recognise the very very hard work that's done by the overwhelming<br />
majority of Parliamentarians. Look I can say that because people<br />
know how har-d I work so I don't have to defend myself. 1m saying it<br />
not just about G~ ovt. members I'm saying it about both sides of<br />
Parliamecnt. The average parliamentarian works very long hours and<br />
in terms of the actual rewards, a lot of them, not all of them, a lot<br />
of-them could do much better outside of the* Parliament.' They work very<br />
long hours, they do have a sense of coiiuiitment, and I say that on both<br />
~ sides of the Parliament. And I think it would just be a little bit<br />
1-irer and 7' ou might get sort of better responses from a lot of your<br />
mem~ bers of Pan,. if there were something on the positive side. I mean<br />
you look at the media, arid be fair..<br />
N. No you look at. the Press Gallery that's different.<br />
H. Wall Okay, ' Che PG as well.<br />
N. They ' re noL the itiedia are they?<br />
H. No no, they're not exclusively,-and they have a major responsibility.<br />
N. And they're about as cloistered as you are in Canberra.<br />
H. Sure, now Murray, if you look at the whole output of the Gallery, but<br />
also the media generally, and tell me how many stories do you see<br />
written about the hard slogging, unreported, undramatic work of members<br />
of Parliament.<br />
N. None.<br />
II. F" of it.<br />
N. Nobody wants* to read that.<br />
H. But what you do is you ge0' 6when they make mugs of themselves, as we've<br />
all been guilty of at times. Highlight it, all that's talked about.<br />
Now I think fairness would suggest..<br />
9J. Cot caught with your pants down that sort of thing?<br />
1. Well I'm not going into that. . I think that fairness suggests that some<br />
coverage of the hard work that's done and the commitment wouldn't be<br />
out of place.<br />
1. No I agrcc, but it will never happen.<br />
I. Well, no it would be ans ideal world I suppose.<br />
1. Listen I'd really like you to explain to me just before you go.<br />
Because I know you've got other commnitments, something that's really<br />
bothered me about your Govt. and has bothered a great many people.<br />
Why are you selling uranium to France? </p>
<p>a<br />
r. Well I can't answer that in 30 seconds, so if you give me.<br />
N. Give you 3 minutes.<br />
H. Right, the decision was made on the basis that we hoped that we<br />
may be ab~ c to use the refusal to supply uranium to France as a lever<br />
to got them to and their objectionable testing of nuclear weapons in<br />
the South Pacific.<br />
N. Can I just stop you there, just very briefly?<br />
H. As lorg as your noL taking it out of my three minutes?<br />
N. No, no, I'll add it on the end. ( Okay) Just glide off on a tangent<br />
for a minute while we're talking about nuclear testing. Do you know<br />
of any plans by the French to shift their testing base out West of this<br />
country?<br />
H. out West of this country?<br />
N. . ah, out South-west of this country to the islands called, damn it<br />
I can't remember what they are, you know it's bound up with the...<br />
H. I don't know of any plans, I think I saw some suggestion, one newspaper<br />
once said about it buL 1 don't know of any plans. I can tell you<br />
I don't know of any such plans. As far as I know they'intend continuing<br />
there in the South Pacific. Now what I was saying was that there was a<br />
hope that it would produce that result. Now the facts are that it<br />
had no such result and what we were doing by) See there was an existing<br />
contract that had been entered into, and so what the Govt. had done is<br />
said well wo will meet the Å inanicial obligation to the producer, the<br />
Auutralian producer, and that was costing in the order of $ 60M. And<br />
thaL simply that we were paying the producer and that uranium was being<br />
kept in drums under a tarpaulin in the Northern Terrority. Now<br />
great pressure that we put on France by doing that was that we<br />
forced them to buy their uranium cheaper, they were able to get their<br />
uranium cheaper on the spot market. Instead of having to pay the contract<br />
price woo a higher price, because we wouldn't sell it to them they were<br />
still getting their uranium but getting it at a cheaper price. So not<br />
only did it have no impact but it was in fact a bonus to them. Now<br />
it's a very hard decision and let me say this to your listeners, including<br />
if I may say so, particularly you young. I understand the emotions<br />
on this irsue but the simple unarguable fact is that we were doing<br />
Prance a favour by al1owing them not to meet their tcontract obligations<br />
but to get urluum cheaper. Now that meant that in these tough budgetary<br />
situations, were we going to pay $ 60M out and gi've an advantage to France<br />
whore that" money wuuld have been available as a result of our decision<br />
to ensure that we didn't have to impose further restraints upon our </p>
<p>-9-<br />
people, those least able in this country to bear that burden.<br />
N. The alternative was comprising your principles which you did.<br />
11. what principle, that we were not added to in our capacity to argue with<br />
France, we haven't diminished our argument to France at all. I've<br />
continued, mny Foreign Minister Bill Hayden, we've continued bi-laterally<br />
and in every multi-national forum to press for a comprehensive test<br />
ban treaty. There's no Govt. and this is recognised in the United<br />
Nations, there fs no Govt. which has pressed harder than my Govt. for<br />
an end to nuclear testing that's recognised. So the fact of providing<br />
uranium to France, under these conditions, let me remind you, there is<br />
a total unqualified guaranteo that not one ounce of Australian uranium<br />
can be uuud in the nuclear weapons programme. It is totally for use<br />
for the generation of power for peaceful purposes.<br />
N. P &gt; le don't believe you can police it well enough to guarantee that?<br />
R. Well, there is not one piece of evidence that we can't, and haven't been.<br />
There is not one piece of evidence that Australian uranium has been<br />
or can be used other than for peaceful purposes. And let me say this<br />
the IAEA has pleaded with Australia to make sure that it retains a supply<br />
for the peaceful cycle, because we have, and it's recognised, we have<br />
the most strinyent safeguards in the world, and to the extent that<br />
Australia doesn't supply countries with less stringent safeguards, or<br />
with no safeguards at all. that means that the international<br />
-nuclear fuel cycle becomes more dangerous. Now that's not an opinion<br />
that is a fact. So if you;, bring all those things together we've continueed<br />
and will continue to use every pressure, effective pressure, we can upon<br />
France for an end to nuclear testing in the South Pacific. We'll uso<br />
Mv pressure we can in the international forums to bring an end to<br />
all. nuclear testing. That we mdde the judgement in these circumstances<br />
that keeping the uranium in the drums up there while France got it's<br />
uranium cheaper was not adding one iota to our capacity to exercise that<br />
pressure. ist you a ton of votes. Lost you a ton of votes.<br />
Wcll if I make judgements on every issue as PM and if-my Govt. makes<br />
judgements on every issue simply on the basis of what is a vote<br />
consequence you won't have responsible Govt.<br />
Plus policy don't forget Hobart.<br />
Policy okay, now i'm saying that the policies of Hobprt and of the'Labor<br />
Party weren't just to be found in one item, we haVe a fundamental economic<br />
and social responsibility and you say, what you're saying is it would<br />
have been for instance, just to impose a further burden on pensioners<br />
-/ t0 </p>
<p>10<br />
put off the pension increase for another two weeks and at the same<br />
timc allow France to get its; uranium cheaper, if that's what we would<br />
have donc we would have imposed, if we'd done that we would have imposed<br />
in one way or another, another $ 60M of burden within Aust. and allowed<br />
France to get its uranium cheaper. Now if you say that's principle<br />
okay, you'ro entitled to that but I don't see it. If you could<br />
point to thc fact that this Govt. is in any way, in any way at all<br />
dimininhcd it's position of principle pressure against France, and not<br />
only against France but against all nuclear powers, of saying look<br />
you must have a comprehensive test ban treaty. The reason why Australia<br />
stands so high . in the international forums of the world is because it's<br />
recognicod that we have done more work than any other Govt. in the<br />
world to try and get a comprehensive test ban treaty. And we are<br />
C ) jtlod to take some credit for the fact that at Reykjavik the two<br />
supor powcrs in fact got to the stage of having a proposition about<br />
a comprchensivo test ban treaty on the table. Now that's the way<br />
you pursue principle in an effective way. And not by saying to France<br />
' well we'lJ keep our uranium in the drums under a tarpaulin in the NT<br />
while you can still get your uranium, but get it cheaper and in a more<br />
dangerous way.<br />
4. You haven't convinced me.<br />
1. You don't want to be convinced.<br />
J. No it's not that at all. That's why I asked you.<br />
1. Tell me, Murray.<br />
1. 1 looked for a. reason other than what I have read so far.<br />
f. Well tell me what is wrong with the argument I put. You tell me what's<br />
w. )' q<br />
I. Nothing, nothin.<br />
Okay there's nothing wrong with it..<br />
Economically and logically but you see the Labor Party is all about,<br />
Emotion? P Principle too, no not just cmotion.<br />
But I didn't talk on the basis of anything other than principle, the<br />
principle is that testing, nuclear testing, in this world ought to be<br />
brought to an end. That's the principle, now don't let's talk about<br />
emotion. lhe prinelple is how do you go about bringing an end to nuclear<br />
testing by France and by other countries, s that our principle do-we<br />
want to bring it to an end? Okay?<br />
I'm not talking about that aspect of it, I'm talking about principle,<br />
of your'party setting a policy, and the principle of you being very<br />
loudly anti-nuke all your life, all your career, very loudly anti-nuke<br />
_ h<br />
i </p>
<p>1<br />
now what you're doing is turning that principle around.<br />
9. Well you're wrong, you cannot say that because, you either haven't listened<br />
to what I've said, or you just don't want to listen.<br />
4. 1 listened very carefully.<br />
4I. Tell ma where I'm wrong in saying that we have done more in actual<br />
effective terms to pursue that policy and that principle than any other<br />
Govt.?<br />
q. I can't tell you that, I vanet tell you that.<br />
Well the simple arbwor is there is no other Govt. that's done as much<br />
that's recognised. It's recognised by the Americanb,<br />
it's recognised in the fact that we got the record vote in the<br />
United Nations for election to the Security Council. Now the thing<br />
is that wc are doing that, we've continued to do that in an effective way.<br />
See you've got to say<br />
I. I ) accusing you on behalf of a lot of a lot of Labor adherents...<br />
You're accusing me, you're entitled to do that, but I believe that<br />
the accuser has a responsibility then after he's made the accusation<br />
to refute the argument of principle. I'm saying the principle is<br />
to be committed unqualifiedly to press the case against nuclear testing.<br />
I have not wavered for one moment from that. Because what you're saying<br />
and you will not face up to it is you're saying that by selling<br />
uranium to France or allowing the sale to continue under an existing<br />
contract, that I've walked away from the principle of stopping nuclear<br />
testing. But you will not face up to my question how has that happened,<br />
it hasn't happened in any way there is diminution, not one iota of<br />
diminution in the principle of Hawke and his Govt. against nuclear<br />
testing. It's internationally recognised that we're the most effective<br />
Go in the world in pressing that case. It is internationally<br />
rccognised that in allowing that contract to go ahead our capacity to<br />
press that argument has not been diminished that it wasn't relevant to it.<br />
It's internationally recognised that if we continue to keep the uranium<br />
here the French would have got the benefit, still got the uranium but<br />
at a cheaper price.<br />
How come it almost split your party right down the middle. How come<br />
half your party's arguing aginst you?<br />
I ask you to look at Lhe party at the end of ' 86, of course they were<br />
worried about it . in August, of course and I<br />
And you made the'same explanation you just made.<br />
And I reopoct the emotion that was felt there, but I have a responsibility<br />
as PM to go out and talk with people and listen to them, that's what I've<br />
iono. I haven't sat in Canberra and said, Hawko's right, you're wrong. </p>
<p>12<br />
I've g6ne round, I've talked with people, I've listened with people,<br />
I have written literally, literally, hundreds, and hundreds, and<br />
hundreds of letters, to kids, to party members, party organisations,<br />
community organisations, I would think, it's not hundreds, I would think<br />
it's probably thousands by now. SoI haven't sat back and said now i'm<br />
right, I've gone through the patient task of trying to explain without<br />
rancour the facts of the situation# now that's what I've had to do<br />
I accept my responsibility, and I think at the end of 1986 as we go<br />
into 1987, pooplc6 are saying ' alright we mightn't like the decision<br />
but at least we recognise the integrity with which he and-the'Govt.<br />
took it, we recognise their reasons, and we recognise the fact that<br />
this Govt. has done not only more than any other Govt in the history<br />
of this country but more than any other Govt. in the world relentlessly<br />
to pursue the policies, bi-laterally and in multi-lateral forums against<br />
nul ) ar testing. We are recognised as the nation in the world which<br />
most rolontlessly pursues the achievement of a comprehensive test ban<br />
treaty. And that issue is one of the more serious in what has been a very tough<br />
year for you. Thanks for coming in this afternoon<br />
