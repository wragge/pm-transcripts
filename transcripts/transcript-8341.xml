    <content><![CDATA[<p>RIME MINISTER<br />FOR MEDIA 28 SEPTEMBER 1991<br />President Bush has taken the single most decisive step for<br />world peace since the nuclear age began nearly fifty years<br />ago. The decisions he has announced this morning on the structure<br />of US nuclear forces constitute the most sweeping act of<br />unilateral disarmament in modern history. And the proposals<br />he has made for further arms reductions promise to reshape<br />fundamentally the nature of global relationships.<br />In an act of great imagination, vision and courage, George<br />Bush has moved the world a giant step back from the brink of<br />nuclear annihilation. He has shown us how the nuclear<br />anguish can end.<br />Those actions confirm his place among that handful of<br />statesmen who change the world immeasurably for the better.<br />And they confirm the greatness of the country he leads.<br />This morning I have sent a message to President Bush<br />congratulating him on his achievement.<br />We now look to the Soviet Union. I have also sent messages<br />to Presidents Gorbachev and Yeltsin urging them to respond<br />in the same spirit; a spirit worthy of George Bush's<br />proposals, and of their own achievements.<br />I hope other nuclear powers will also, in turn, respond in<br />similar spirit.</p>
