Prime Minister Julia Gillard today officially opened a new training centre in Blacktown that will play a key role in training more doctors and nurses for Western Sydney.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government has contributed $20.6 million to build the Universityof Western Sydney Blacktown Mt Druitt Clinical Schoolin one of the fastest growing areas of the country.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was joined by Health Minister Nicola Roxon at the opening along with Western Sydney Federal MPs Michelle Rowland, Julie Owens, Ed Husic and Chris Hayes.</p>
<p>The world class Clinical School will offer more people the opportunity to train to become doctors, nurses and allied health professionals in Western Sydney, where they are most needed.</p>
<p>The Blacktown Mt Druitt Clinical School has capacity for around 150 medical students that will train at both the Blacktown and Mt Druitt Hospital.</p>
<p>This is a significant achievement compared to six years ago when there were no medical students training at either hospital.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government has made an enormous contribution to improve health services and medical training opportunities in Western Sydney.</p>
<p>The Government's health reforms are delivering greater investment in hospitals including beds, surgery and emergency departments, more GP's and specialists and higher investments in primary care.</p>
<p>Western Sydney residents are also benefiting from the Gillard Labor Government's new GP After-Hours telephone line that has handled more than 41,000 calls since it was launched on 1 July this year.</p>
<p>Around a third of all calls have involved the care of children aged up to 5 years, providing parents with advice and peace of mind when they need it.</p>
<p>The UWS Blacktown Mt Druitt Clinical School is part of the Government's commitment to provide a sustainable health system by training the next generation of doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>The school provides on-site education and research facilities for medical students including a library, theatrette, seminar rooms, a laboratory and space for clinical trials.Students will also have access to equipment such as human patient simulators, atraining mannequin used for teaching CPR and an infant patient simulator.</p>
<p>The new medical simulation technology is world class, comparable to equipment used at Harvard University.</p>
<p>The $20.6 million of Commonwealth funding for the new training facilities was provided from the Health and Hospitals Fund and the Department of Education Employment Capital Development Pool.</p>
<p>The Health and Hospitals Fund is the single largest investment in health infrastructure ever made by an Australian Government.</p>
<p>It is a key part of the Government's reform agenda to reshape Australia's health care system for the future. </p>
