    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of a statesman of the Pacific, Fiji';s Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I extend our sincere condolences to his family and to the people of Fiji.  During his long period in public life he established strong working relationships with a wide range of Australian leaders.</p>
<p>Ratu Mara is rightly regarded as the founding father of modern Fiji and will be remembered as one of the Pacific';s great leaders.  After leading his country to independence, he served as Fiji';s first and longest serving Prime Minister (1970-87, 1987-92) and later as President (1992-2000).  At home, he played a vital role in providing stability during a turbulent period in Fiji politics.</p>
<p>  Internationally, Ratu Mara was an outstanding representative for the Pacific.  He was very influential in Commonwealth circles and instrumental in the establishment of the Pacific Islands Forum, then known as the South Pacific Forum.  The recent Auckland Declaration and agreement of leaders to work towards development of a Pacific Plan will ensure that the region for which he worked so hard is well placed to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.</p>
