OPENING SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR. JOHN GORTOi\ N<br />
MALVERN TOWN HALL, MELBOURNE<br />
Wednesday 4 November 1970 </p>
<p>EMBARGO : NOT FOR RELEASE BY ANY MEDIA BEFORE<br />
4 OEBR-97-<br />
Tonight I want to talk to you about the coming Senate Campaign.<br />
I shall report to you on our achievements in the last year.<br />
I shall touch briefly on the further objectives we have in mind and I shall point<br />
out the great differences between Labor and ourselves in defence, foreign<br />
policy, and responsible non-inflationary internal government.<br />
The result of a Senate Election does not usually affect Australia's<br />
future. But it is possible that this election could result in Labor's gaining<br />
a blocking half in the Senate that is 30 Senators.<br />
If that happened, Labor would not have power to do anything<br />
positive. But it would have the power to obstruct, frustrate, and delay all<br />
the processes of government. It could refuse supply, or defeat a budget.<br />
And I believe it would use that power, as it would use any power it could<br />
gain, to damage Australia's Security, to destroy Australia's alliances, to<br />
disrupt Australia's economy ard to affect Australia's future very greatly.<br />
Nevertheless, important though it is, the election is not really an<br />
occasion for us to advance a lengthy programme of new policies, or make<br />
new specific promises. The occasion for that was one year ago, at the<br />
General Election, when we put before you a programme, policies, and<br />
promises for a three-year period. And you elected us.<br />
I can report to you that in the one year since then we have carried<br />
out most of the promises we said we would carry out over three years. I shall<br />
not weary you with a detailed list in this short address. But we have brought<br />
in a vastly improved health schemle. We have reduced the burden of direct<br />
taxation in one year by the amount we promised to do in three years. We have<br />
continued to protect and advance greater Australian ownership of our developing<br />
resources. We have greatly increased spending on education and on new<br />
initiatives in social services. And we have given the States a new financial<br />
deal by greatly increasing the funds they require for their own responsibilities.<br />
These are only a few of the year's achievements. The complete<br />
list is much longer. For example, at the last election, we made 43<br />
promises and already 3 1 have been carried out. I think that I can justly claim<br />
" that which we promise, we perform". " While they talk, we act.<br />
We have additional objectives. We shall attain them as we can<br />
do so with financial responsibility. I shall refer to them later in this<br />
speech. And they are important. </p>
<p>But even more import. ant is the harm which Labor would do to. our<br />
security. Let me first discuss with you the question of Vietnam. Why I think<br />
it was right, and in our interests to go there to help. Why I think it is right<br />
and in our interests to remain there until the Vietnamese are organised enough,<br />
and strong enough, to defend -themselves.<br />
May I remind you how this WE began.<br />
For a number of years after the Geneva Accords of 1934 the people<br />
of North Vietnam lived under their communist government and the people of<br />
South Vietnam lived under their non-communist government. The people in<br />
both sections lived in relative peace. That peace could have continued.<br />
B ut the Government of North Vietnam was prepared to wage war<br />
rather than let tI~ e people of the Souti retain the right to choose their own<br />
Government and way of Ife. And the people of the South were prepared to<br />
acctept war rather than have their right of self-determination taken from them<br />
rather than have an alien government imposed on them by force.<br />
And so the war came.<br />
It came at first through an uprising armed and directed by the North<br />
and then through an invasion of the South by the North Vietnamese Regular Army.<br />
I do not ask you to accept this on my statement alone, for the present Deputy<br />
Leader of the Labor Party, Mr. Lance Barnard, has endorsed what I say.<br />
In May 1967 after a visit to Vietnam he. reported publicly that there was a<br />
large-scale invasion of South Vietnam by North Vietnamese troops. " I am<br />
satisfied", he said, " that this is more than just a guerilla war and I suppose<br />
it can be compared with the earlier conflict in Korea".<br />
So there was invasion. And the object of that invasion was to destroy<br />
self-determination in South Vietnam; to take away the people' s right to<br />
choose how and under what government they would live.<br />
Again, I do not ask you to accept this on my statement alone. For in<br />
his Evatt Memorial Lecture of 1966 the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr.<br />
Whitlam, wrote:<br />
" it is, however, quite clear that victory by the VIietcong and Hanoi<br />
would destroy any hope of self determination in the South as it has<br />
destroyed it in the North".<br />
And this invasion was accompanied, as Mr. Whitlam has admitted, by<br />
" Vietcong brutalities and cruelties in Vietnam". 3 </p>
<p>Don't you think it was right to help fight that aggression? Wvere we<br />
immoral to do so as we are now told or were the invaders immoral? Should<br />
we follow the dictates of Mr. W* hitlam's present conscience and cease to resist<br />
invasion, the imposition of communist dictatorship, and the brutalities<br />
perpetrated, or should we continue to resist and finish that which we began.<br />
Well, the invasion was resisted with the help of the Americans and<br />
of ourselves and other countries9 It t is been resisted for six years. And<br />
in that time the strength and purpose of South Vietnam has so grown that it is<br />
now able to take over more of its own defence; it has so grown that the<br />
Americans and ourselves have been able to reduce our troop numbers without<br />
endangering the objectives we sought.<br />
It is possible for us to make this reduction because we stayed and<br />
fought when Labor was clamouring for us to withdraw. And because we stayed<br />
and fought it is now possible for President Nixon to offer a cease fire, an end<br />
to the killing, and negotiations designed to allow the South Vietnamese to<br />
ehkct their own government from the candidates of any political party including<br />
the communist party.<br />
Who then is immoral? We, who offer an end to killing or they who<br />
insist on continuing the killing to achieve military conquest and who refuse a<br />
cease fire? What does that present conscience, of which Mr. Whitlam speaks<br />
so much, suggest we should do? To continue to resist brutal and unprovoked<br />
invasion? To help a small nation retain the right to govern itself? Or to<br />
withdraw all our troops now as Mr. Whitlamn presently demands.<br />
If we did that we would betpy the people of South Vietnam. We<br />
would negate the heavy sacrifices already made. We would be recreant to<br />
the hopes for future universal peace because future peace can only endure if<br />
small nations are not threatened with invasion and conquest.<br />
We would destroy the confidence of the other small countries in<br />
Asia, and by doing that, we would increase the possibility of future danger to<br />
Australia itself. We look forward to the day when, with South Vietnam able to guard<br />
its own independence without help, we can withdraw all our troops, That day is<br />
coming nearer as the military war is being won. But ui~ til it does arrive I suggest<br />
that morality, conscience, and self interest all require that we should finish the<br />
task we began. But Labor under Mr. Whitlamn would renege in Vietnam. / 4 </p>
<p>Having done this -mand thereby increased the danger to other<br />
Asian countries including Malaysia they would then withdraw from the Five<br />
Power Arrangements designed to help Malaysia and Singapore and at the same<br />
time they would drastically cut the strength of our own army by abolishing<br />
National Service. We would be alone, with our alliances shattered, regarded as<br />
accepting no responsibility to help mr-ntain peace in our region. And with<br />
our own army halved.<br />
That is what I meant by saying Labor would damage Australia's<br />
security and destroy Australia's alliances.<br />
And that is one reasn I ask you not to give them the chance to<br />
do this damage.<br />
RURAL INDUSTRIES Australia has a new problem new in scale to solve. That<br />
problem is the plight of many of our rural industries.<br />
Some have been hit hard by drought ( in many sections of the<br />
Nation) particularly by the tragic drought in parts of Queensland.<br />
This has drastic impact on many individuals but it will eventually<br />
pass. It is not new. And we can take measures to help those who are hard<br />
hit. In fact we have, during the past five years provided some $ 94<br />
million for drought relief freight concessions, restocking loans, assistance<br />
with shire rates and so on and we stand ready to support the States further<br />
whenever the cost of approved drought relief measures is beyond their resources.<br />
But the problem of selling our produce on world markets now and<br />
in the future is far more serious. Many of our rural industries now find either<br />
that the countries of the world do not wish to buy their produce, or: that they<br />
will not pay enought for it, to provide a living to the producer.<br />
We have had hard pressed rural industries before. But what is new<br />
( about the present position) is that where rural industries were hard pressed<br />
before so was every other section of industry. Now rural industries alone<br />
are hard pressed while other industries, and other sections of the community,<br />
are not. a 0 </p>
<p>This does not come about through lack of help and support by<br />
Governments to rural industry in Australia-<br />
* We have increased the superphosphate bounty to $ 12 per<br />
ton: We have extended taxation concessions-<br />
We have introduced a drought bond scheme:<br />
We have raised exemption levels in relation to estate duty:<br />
We introduced devaluation compensation payments following<br />
the devaijation of steriing at the end of 1967.... and to the<br />
3) June i97.), payments made to rural industry totalled<br />
million: In the last Budget we provided $ 30 million for payments to<br />
woolgrowaers whose income from wool fell by more than 8<br />
per cent between 1968/ 69 and 1969/ 70 and who received at<br />
least 50 -er cert of their gross income from wool.<br />
We have increased the funds available to the Term Loan and<br />
Farm Development Loan Fund and made arrangements for<br />
the e xei-r-. tion of primary producers in adverse financial<br />
circumstances from the increase in the maximum overdraft<br />
rate approved by the Reserve Bank in March 1970.<br />
The Government has under consideration at this moment a<br />
proposal for a stabilisation plan for certain exports of fresh<br />
apples and pears.<br />
All this we have already done.<br />
The result of the squeeze on rural industry is not a matter<br />
of concern to those industries alone. The country towns which depend on their<br />
prosperity are hard hit. And because those on the land are buyers of cars,<br />
machinery, chemicals, and a maltitude of consumer goods this recession will<br />
be increasingly felt throujih the whcoile fabric of industry ' And commerce in<br />
Australia. Further, because the salle of rural products earns over 50% 0<br />
of our foreign exchange a decline in earn ings will severely affect our overseas<br />
balances. This is a national, not a sectional problem.<br />
The solution must lie not in a withdrawal of the kind of help which is<br />
now given. </p>
<p>Rather does it lie in seeking new and different methods of assistapce.<br />
Methods designed to ensure that the highest price which buyers are prepared to<br />
pay is in fact paid. Methods designed to increase the efficiency of handling,<br />
where possible, and reduce the costs of marketing.<br />
Methods designed to help reduce the cost of production to the<br />
individual, efficient, grower and not by means of subsidy.<br />
An example of this approach is the Government' s action to help<br />
wool growers to help combat the disistrous fall in wool prices.<br />
There we have secured legislative authority to set up the Australian<br />
Wool Commission. The function of this Commission is not to set a -high reserve price<br />
which buyers will not pay, and which could result in huge stock piles of wool<br />
and in manufacturers switching to synthetic fibres.<br />
Its function is to operate a flexible reserve price, determined from<br />
day to day, in order to ensure that if buyers are prepared to pay a certain price<br />
they will in fact pay it and not be able to buy moire cheaply because of the<br />
vagaries of the auction system.<br />
Its function, too, is to regulate the flow of wool onto the market; to<br />
encourage the adoption of technological aids to wool selling such as pre sale<br />
objective measurement, ultimately selling by sample, and reduction in handling<br />
costs thas ensuring the highest possible return to the grower without trying to<br />
defy the market. My colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry has been working<br />
energetically on this. He has already chosen, after consultation with me, the<br />
members of the Commission. He will announce the names tomorrow.<br />
We expect the Commission will hold its first meeting this week.<br />
We hope and believe the Commission will be operating the flexible reserve scheme<br />
within a few weeks.<br />
This will help. But more is needed.<br />
It would be a1a enormous help to many farmers and it would remove a<br />
constant worry from their minds, if they could be assured when their<br />
circumstances justified it of guaranteed long-term finance. If they had a loan<br />
for a term of years, instead of short-term loans or overd~ rafts on call, they could<br />
plan better for the future and would have a security they, now lack.<br />
We therefore propose to discuss with the appropriate financial<br />
institutions the setting up of a Finance Insurance Corporation to insure long-term<br />
loans to rural producers and to act in much the same way as the Housing Finance<br />
Insurance Corporation acts at present.<br />
But I must emphasise that the key words in what I have said are" when<br />
their circumstances justify it". This is not a proposal to advance long-term<br />
credit to rural producers who may be in a hopeless financial position or who may<br />
not be a good credit risk. / 7. </p>
<p>The Bureau of Agricultur al Economics has been examining this proposal<br />
and has reported to the Minister for Primary Industry on it. We believe that it will<br />
work, that it will be of assistance of a new kind, and that it will be in the national<br />
interest. There is an additional problem. That of existing farm debt. In a number<br />
of cases a load of debt is crried which is greater than the farmer or property can bear.<br />
This will require a programme of debt and property readjustment. I do not mean by<br />
this that we should adopt the slogan " get big or get out" because bigness is not of<br />
itself any guarantee of eonomy or efficiep'y.<br />
But I do mean that the harsh realities of the world will require a policy of<br />
" oget to a stage where you can produce at a cost that meets the market prices or<br />
accept a lower income or leave the industry.<br />
And if this is so then it requires that the community should help in the<br />
retraining and rehabilitation of those -who, for one reason or another, cannot meet this<br />
criteria, and that the Commonwealth should work with the State to bring about that<br />
structural readjustment. just as I asked you not to give Mr. Whitlam the chance to damage our<br />
security and alleances so I ask you not to give him the chance to wreck our national<br />
economy. HOUR WEEK I have been speaking of the rural industries and of what has been done, and<br />
can be done, to assist them.<br />
But one thing is clear. With their costs already high and their returns<br />
already fallen they wiould be dealt a crippling blow if Australia introduced a<br />
week. Under the Whitlam-Hawke partnerslip there is a real danger that this would<br />
happen if they had the opportunity.<br />
And this would not only hit rural industries.<br />
Introduction of a thirty-five hour week must mean one of two things.<br />
Either those who now work forty hours would work only 35 and the volume<br />
of production would therefore drop, and the cost per unit of production would therefore<br />
rise, Or those who now work forty hours for a given wage would work 35 hours for the<br />
siame wage and an extra five hours at overtime rates. In which case the cost per unit<br />
of production would therefore rise.<br />
in either case the end result must be greatly increased costs. This would<br />
hit all those on fixed incomes; all on superannuation, all living on the income from<br />
investments, all pensioners.<br />
It would raise the price of everything the housawife buys, and the<br />
transport and other public facilities she uses. </p>
<p>It would place Australia at great disadvantage in trying to sell our products<br />
on the competitive export market. It would raise the cost of building schools, hospitals,<br />
roads, houses, and the other services the community needs.<br />
It * would damage overseas confidence in Australia's future and impede the<br />
inflow of capital to helpa in our needed development. And even though this damage<br />
would have been done th worker himself would be no better off.<br />
The most he could gain would he higher money wages which because of the<br />
higher prices for everything he bought would not be higher real wages and would buy<br />
no more. It Is hard to think of any action whicliwould more damage Australia and<br />
Australians. Yet Mr. Hawke of the A. C. T. U. has announced that 1971 will be the year<br />
of the ' 5 hour week. That is his stated aim. And Mr. Whitlam is bound, by the<br />
platform constitution and rules of the Labor Party to do all he can to help Mr. Hawke.<br />
For the platform, constitution and rules as adopted in August last year state " That<br />
conference considers that an effective political campaign be undertaken, in conjunction<br />
with the A. C. T. U. to achieve our objective of a 35 hour week.<br />
Typically, Mr. Whitlam is now evading all questions on the marter. But<br />
he is bound to support Mr. Hawke by " an effective political campaign". I belileve that<br />
if he had the opportunity he would.<br />
He could do so by permitting statutory bodies over whom the C3overnment<br />
had control to take the lead in introducing the shorter week. He could do so by exerting<br />
political pressure on those who determine the hours orl public servants.<br />
Above all he could do so, should a case be put to the Arbitration Court,<br />
by intervening and urging the Court to do what he is bound to do.<br />
Well, we will not. We will use all means open to us to point out tile<br />
disastrous consequences of such a step.<br />
Whether or not the question is pending before the Arbitration Commission<br />
we shall publicly point out the economic consequen ces of the proposal. We shall<br />
publicly urge that it ought not to be entertained.<br />
Mr. Whitlam and Mr. Hawke think it terri: ble that we should do this. I<br />
reply by paraphrasing the words of Mr. Trudeau " Nf your hearts want to bleed over<br />
this, go ahead and bleed. It is better that you should than that the country should<br />
bleed economically because of you.<br />
It is true that because of automation and the use of new machinery the<br />
same amount can be produced with fewer men, or in a shorter time by the same number<br />
of men. But surely this does not mean we should seek to work less for the same<br />
amount of production. </p>
<p>Surely what we need is greater and greater production from the same<br />
number of men, made possible by increased automation, so that real wages can be<br />
increased and so that the needs of the community the public works and services of<br />
all kinds which depend on production can be the more quickly and the more ch~ eaply<br />
supplied to the community.<br />
The time for less work has not yet nearly arrived.<br />
Both the individual and the community have too many pressing needo. and<br />
these needs cannot be met unless they ar--worked for.<br />
That, at any rate, is our approach. And that is a point of difference<br />
between us and the Opposition which I ask you to consider at this Election.<br />
SOCIAL WELFARE AND EDUCATION<br />
Let me now speak of that field in which my Government has done much.<br />
The field of Social Welfare and of education. There are two promises,<br />
made at the General Election last year, which have not yet been fulfilled. I<br />
make no apology for this because no one could expect mie to carry out all of a three<br />
year programme in one year.<br />
Those promises were<br />
To pay special attention to the needs of the low Income family with<br />
young children.<br />
To tackle the problem posed because many. people after paying health<br />
insu~ ance contributions f3r many years, find that they are obliged to spend<br />
long periods under intensive care in nursing homes as distinct from hospitals,<br />
and do not receive hospital benefits.<br />
I renew those promises and reiterate that as promised we shall act on these matters<br />
during tIe life of the Parliament.<br />
The Minister for Health has been discussing with the Funds the question<br />
of long illness in nursing homes. And the Minister for Social Services has been<br />
studying the varying means by which our promise on the needs of the low income family<br />
can best be carried out.<br />
In the field of education direct Commonwealth Government spending has<br />
increased from $ 192 million in 1968--69 to $ 312 million this year. And by providing<br />
a new financial deal for the States we have indirectly assisted the States to raise<br />
their spending on education to an expected one billion, three hundred and eleven<br />
million dollars this year or almost 15% more than 1969-70. </p>
<p>9a,,<br />
I now announce a new objective to which wie give very high priority. That<br />
is, the establishment of child care centres for children of pre-school age,.<br />
In Australia, as in other advanced countries overseas, married women<br />
including those with children of pre-school age are entering regular em ployment in<br />
increasing numbers. Thus, in the decade 1960-1970 the number of married women<br />
in the work force almost doubled from 9. to 18. 3% 7.<br />
We wish to ensure that the children of there women have every opp) ortunity<br />
for the fullest development in both the et.. otional and physical sense. Studies made<br />
by the Department of Labour and National Service show that existing facilities to<br />
ensure this are woefully inadequate.<br />
We therefore announce as an objective our desire to introduce a Scheme<br />
to assist in the establishment and operation of child care centres of approved standard.<br />
In consultation with the organisations at present concerned with such child care<br />
that is the State, Municipal and voluntary bodies which now maintain such facilities,<br />
we hcoe to work out guidelines and standards covering the nature of the accommiodation,<br />
the equipment required, the staffing required, and the training requirements oZ staff<br />
needed for the effective conduct of these centres.<br />
Further, wie will discuss with employers the most effective means of<br />
providing incentives to employers to induce them to provide child care facilities.<br />
Overseas experience has demonstrated the value of the participation of-employers<br />
in such schemes. In the discussionswe propose with State and Municipal and volunuary<br />
organi sat ions we will be helped by the liaison already established by the Women's<br />
Bureau of the Department of Labour and National Service with many ofL the<br />
organisations to whom we shall be speaking.<br />
A programme of this kind cannot be put into operation overnight but we<br />
shall begin it, and shall discuss with the States methods of increasing the numbers<br />
of pre-school teachers to staff the centres.<br />
This does not mean that we believe the need for pre-school teachfing<br />
centres generally is not important. But it does mean that we think the proviston<br />
of pre-school centres for children of working or sick: mothers should be the<br />
first steps we take in this area. </p>
<p>OFFICE OF THE ENVIRONMENT<br />
There is a mounting, and justified, concern in Australia at the risks<br />
of environmental pollution.<br />
Such pollution is not the inevitable by-product of advanced technology<br />
and popuiation increase, but it does represent a failure to take fully into<br />
account the environmental consequences of our actions, and of the disposal of<br />
waste products by individuals and factories.<br />
The results in Australia are not yet approaching the catastrophic<br />
results which are threatening to occur in the more heavily industrialised and<br />
more heavily populated countries.<br />
But the time to begin to correct present pollution and to prevent<br />
increasing pollution is now.<br />
The State Governments are showing an awareness of this and the CSIRO<br />
has Leen carrying out a wide range of investigations into environmental quality.<br />
It has indeed been engaged in some 48 projects concerned with such matters as<br />
studying biological control of insect pests as distinct from insecticide control<br />
methods of treatment of factory effluent, control of the ash content of coal.<br />
But in many cases pollution can best be tackled by a National Body<br />
since, for instance, pollution of a stream in one State can lead to pollution of e<br />
river in another State.<br />
WNe therefore have taken the decision to set up a Commonwealth Office<br />
of the Environment under the control of the Prime Minister' s Department.<br />
This Office will be responsible for advising the Commonwealth and<br />
recommending to us action that should be taken to prevent or reduce pollution<br />
arising out of the activities of any Commonwealth Department or Authority.<br />
We shall also approach the States to seek the formation of a National<br />
Advisory Council to advise the Commonwealth, and the States, on action<br />
to be taken in areas where co-ordination can properly be achieved.<br />
LABOR AND WHITLAM<br />
You will no doubt have noticed Mr. Whitlam' s a ccusations that we<br />
are divided and divisive.<br />
Divisive, one of his favourite words, seems to mean refusing to do<br />
what he wants. But I am surprised he would even use the word " divided". </p>
<p>11.<br />
For we have against us a Labor Party openly divided as it has not been<br />
since 1954. The Victorian organisation is in a state of cnaos, more concerned<br />
with internai squabbling than with anything else.<br />
A meeting to protest against Federal Labor intervention recently<br />
att racted twice as many people as Mr. Whitlain attracted to the opening of<br />
his campaign. This Vict orian meeting was tu be declared bogus one week and<br />
given Federal Labor Party blessing the next.<br />
The group of extreme left wing unions which has for years ruled the<br />
Labor Executive the Trades Union Defence Committee and those<br />
characterised by Mr. Whitlam as a monolithic, junta-ridden, and undemocratic<br />
group have not been defeated.<br />
The struggle still goes on and the odds are that Mr. Calwell' s<br />
pro~ hesy that nothing will change will be proved right.<br />
They are in dissaray so complete, and so publicly evident, that one<br />
would imagine that the word division was the last word their so-called<br />
Leader would use.<br />
As to their Leader I propose to leave snide personal attacks to him.<br />
It suits him. After all who can forget the sophisticated wit and generosity<br />
of spirit he displayed, when, on Mr. McEwen' s last day in Parliament, after<br />
a recorc' career of real achievement for the Nation, Mr. Whitiam' s<br />
contribution was to call out " let the lame duck waddle off".<br />
But I bel ieve it fair to say this. Mr. idhiclam has begun his campaign<br />
with a string of false statements.<br />
Hie stated in his opening speech that we had placed unprecedented<br />
reliance on indirect taxation. This is false.<br />
He said we had a 5% O cost of living increase last year. This is<br />
false. He said the Treasurer had " admitted" this. This is false.<br />
He said our approach to the care of the sick aged is discriminatory<br />
and unplanned. This is false.<br />
He said that Labor had proposed to recognise the National Liberation<br />
Front as a party to negotiations and that this had been accepted. This is false. </p>
<p>Labor proposed the N. L. F. snould be recognised as a Principal<br />
party to negotiations, this has not been done, and the N. L. F. are regarded<br />
only as part of the Hanoi delegation.<br />
He has since accused me of breaking a promise to legislate for<br />
portability of pensions this is false. The legislation has been introduced<br />
into the House. He has accused me of doing nothing to implement the<br />
construction of railways in South Aus~ ralia. He states no money has been<br />
provided for this in the 197J/ 71 Budget. This is false. The Port Pirie!<br />
Adel aide Railway is held up, at the request of the Premier of South<br />
Australia, who has asked for further discussions. But the Budget contains<br />
an Appropriat ion of $ 3 million for the Port Augusta/ Whyalla Railway. It<br />
is contained in Appropriation Act No. 2, Division No. 890/ 2/ 05. At the<br />
moment tenders have been called, received, and are being considered.<br />
I have not dealt with all his false statements. It would be<br />
w , arying to do so.<br />
But the credibility of the man, and of his campaign, might<br />
perhaps be judged by these tactics. Genuine grounds for criticism must<br />
be scarce if he is driven to invent them.<br />
One thing more I gould say.<br />
Mr. Whitlam accuses us of judging the Australian people to be<br />
selfish. Yet it is we who ask the Australian people to accept that<br />
there should be an obligation for National Service.<br />
It is he who urges the easier course of abolishing it.<br />
It is we who ask the Australian people to accept the burden<br />
of completing the task in Vietnam.<br />
It is he who urges the easier way of immediate withdrawal.<br />
It is we who ask the Australian people to accept the need to<br />
join with Britain, Malaysia, Singapore and New Zealand in a pact to help<br />
bring stability to our North. </p>
<p>14<br />
It is he who urges the easier way of retreating to isolation.<br />
It is we who place the defeat of inflation, and responsible<br />
management of the economy, amongst our highest objectives.<br />
It is he who pursues the popular path of promising to do everything<br />
that anyone wants at once. Regardless of whether there are the men and<br />
materials to keep the promises, regardless of the effect on prices.<br />
Who is judging the Australian people to be indolent, and selfish?<br />
I suggest that we are not and that he is.<br />
Which does not seem a proper course for this self appointed<br />
custodian of the national conscience to follow.<br />
CONCLUSION I have shown some of the differences between us and our opponents.<br />
In Defence and Foreign Affairs and concern for the future security<br />
of Australia we are poles apart.<br />
Domestically we are pledged to fight inflation and rising prices.<br />
Every utterance they makE-whether political or industrial supports action which<br />
will inflate prices. We know the importance of rural industry to the economy and of the<br />
personal suffering which many engaged in some rural industries now face.<br />
Labor's leader devoted two lines of his opening address to this subject and,<br />
so far as I know, he has not spoken of it since.<br />
We are pledged to preserve the right of dissent, except when that<br />
interferes with the civil rights of the majority, which we shall protect. A<br />
leading spokesman for Labor has stated that authority has had its day.<br />
I believe that if these differences are understood you will give us<br />
the right to govern this nation in rhe years ahead as those of our persuasion<br />
have done in the years past. That is the right to govern in such a way that<br />
Our security against attack will be advanced, our<br />
internal economny will continue to provide full<br />
employment and rising living standards.<br />
The war against poverty will be pursued until it is finally<br />
won.<br />
The industrial and commercial strength of our nation<br />
will continue to grow.<br />
Within a broad framework of governmental guidelines<br />
decisions will be left to individuals and not dictated<br />
by politicians and public servants. </p>
<p>15<br />
We believe that in this decade Australia can make great<br />
advances towards freedom from fear:<br />
Freedom from fear of aggression from without.<br />
Freedom from fear of being old, unwanted and<br />
uncared for.<br />
Freedom from fear of unemployment.<br />
Freedom from fear of being unable to meet the<br />
cost of illness.<br />
We will not gain all we want at once. Nor will we gain it<br />
without working for it. But we have advanced towards the goal and given<br />
effort by Australians, and responsibility by Governments, we will advance<br />
still further. We ask you now to let us take further steps towards this goal<br />
unimpeded by obstruction from a Labor Senate. We ask you give us<br />
Government Senators and let us get on with the job. </p>
