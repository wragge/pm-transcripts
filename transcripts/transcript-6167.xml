1,33AU ST R AI [ A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 3 August 1983.<br />
The statement by the Leader of the Opposition today about<br />
the evidence I gave to the Hope Royal Commission is wrong and<br />
defamatory. I am disgusted that the Leader of the Opposition would make<br />
such a statement while I am still giving evidence before the<br />
Royal Commission and thus not in a position to respond to<br />
his allegations.<br />
Counsel for the Commonwealth will request the Commission to<br />
convene in open session at 10.00 a. m. tomorrow to consider the<br />
statement. Counsel will submit that the statement constitutes a<br />
contempt of the Commission and needs to be dealt with to protect<br />
the integrity of the Commnission's procedures. </p>
