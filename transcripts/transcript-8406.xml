PRIME MINISTER 14/ 92<br />
JOINT STATEM: ENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
MP, AND THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY<br />
SERVICES, THE HON B HOWE MP<br />
CABINET REMOVES MEDICARE CO-PAYMENT<br />
Federal Cabinet today agreed to remove the Medicare<br />
co-payment of $ 2.50 and restore the $ 3.50 rebate reductions<br />
announced in the August 1991 Budget.<br />
These changes will take effect from 1 March 1992.<br />
This decision was made to remove uncertainty about the<br />
health system and to address concerns about a decline in<br />
bulk billing.<br />
Today's decision will restore the Medicare benefits<br />
provisions for GP services to exactly how they were before<br />
the change was introduced.<br />
The improved safety net provisions, introduced on 1 January<br />
1992, will remain. These give families higher Medicare<br />
benefits once they exceed $ 246 per annum in gap payments.<br />
GPs are expected to pass the full benefit of the change on<br />
to patients.<br />
In this way the decision will ensure that Medicare will<br />
remain a truly universal health insurance system for all<br />
Australians. A viable, efficient universal health system is essential if<br />
people are to get proper care and support regardless of<br />
income. This is particularly important now when so many people are<br />
already experiencing difficulty because of the recession.<br />
The core of the 1991 Budget health changes involved measures<br />
designed to deal with growing health costs and the overuse<br />
of medical service, directly by making reforms to how<br />
general practitioners operate. These reforms will be<br />
retained. </p>
<p>In this way the Government will be dealing with the<br />
structural problem of overservicing at source.<br />
These changes are aimed at reducing the numbers of GPs,<br />
reducing the extent to which GPs are dependent on the<br />
current open-ended fee-for-service system, and encouraging<br />
GPs to become more cost-effective in their use of services<br />
such as pathology tests and pharmaceuticals.<br />
The Cabinet agreed that in current circumstances the<br />
co-payments and the previously announced reduction in<br />
rebates were not needed and were a burden on the health<br />
system.<br />
Given the crucial importance of keeping inflation low, the<br />
substantial inflationary impact of the co-payment and the<br />
cut in the rebate was also a concern.<br />
The inflationary impact would also have increased indexed<br />
Commonwealth outlays on social security and payments to the<br />
States by more than $ 200 million in a full year.<br />
Removing these health charges will remove around 0.4<br />
percentage points from the CPI.<br />
These changes to the health system will directly add around<br />
$ 51 million to the Budget in 1991-92 and $ 239 million in<br />
1992-93.<br />
