SPEECH TO THE C01. n), RATION OF A1JSTRAL@. r.~ NDS<br />
It is a great pleastire for me to he able to addresa the CAT<br />
at the conclusion of its Third Natiomal rorum, 7hr is.<br />
great value in the ice--ers of.. i i~ ti'private sector<br />
Coming torgether -to di-scuss our-economy arid where it is going,<br />
As the leaders of Aust-ralian industries your views and your decisionis<br />
017 are of gr: eat importance to all Australians.<br />
joiht I woul. d ike to talk toyuaorth irpnct of the<br />
global-recc-ession on Autralia, and the state of our. ecn1.<br />
I want to say something cAb ou t the damage wce sornetiniez do to<br />
ourselves whenl we do riot wrork, together well enougqh ana spena<br />
too mutch time arg~ uingc about different dir, tions pr ways of<br />
doing thiricis. It is illore important than ever that we recognise<br />
as Australians that our interests are not in~ Conf lict but<br />
cornplementarY, Trmore imvportant than ever for us to pul. l together<br />
ini bujilaing Australia tip.<br />
Since 1979/ 80, when the major econon, es of the vorld were hit<br />
by consi~ ckrable increases in oil prices, the global. econoimy<br />
has slipped into a rnewd recession whic0h a s turned out to<br />
be far worse than anyone anticipated. As a xesult, we now live___<br />
in a very different econoii world from aniythinig we have Rnow,, n<br />
in recent years.<br />
0 Industrial production in six of the seven major world economies<br />
has either fallen or stagnated in the UHarch quarter. In<br />
the United' States, the motor vehicle industry is operating at<br />
about half of its capacity. Th~ e steel industry is equally<br />
depressed, and even allowing for some irm-, rovezient,-in Miay,<br />
-prvat-hosin--saft 1were only about half what they were<br />
four year;: ago&amp;. In 1981, world trade declined in value for<br />
the first time in more than 20 years, real interes. t rates<br />
: 7 ill the United States and Europe have reached historically<br />
high levels and they are-iemainlng high. At present sme<br />
milTI73-on people are without jobs in the OECD count. ries, a<br />
terrible reflection of the global downturn, and it is predicted<br />
that it will go to 32 million ini the firot half of 1983.<br />
The world-recesl-on has helpted to bri-uig down; j overseas inf lation'<br />
rates. The American inif ltion1 rate is iiow -running at about<br />
* 6 to 7% where it was over 14% just two years agor,&gt; while thfE, </p>
<p>av er a 1: A, 1 o fo0r t~ C' 2D c 0* an1t aS as ~ o e i F<br />
expactecl to odccline in the secc'n.-half of 1932 to 7.5% from<br />
10.6Z. in the second hafof 1SC" J. Evt n with ic-, war intrnat6ionial<br />
inflation raethe progtiosis for the global economy is very<br />
mtixed. We havea heard for the Last year that economic recovery<br />
will stavt in 2i%: months' time. I suppoze if someone says<br />
that often enough they are bound -eventually to be right.<br />
The in its most recent surkrey, estimate3 that incdustrialised<br />
econ&amp; e % A11 crwa an averaUe anrnial rate of 21-2 in the-s. econd___<br />
half of 1982 following a fall of half a par cent in the firot<br />
half of this year, Tshat is hardly encouraging as a sign of<br />
recovelry,. esteCCially when they are also forecasting toit;<br />
xinploymenrt will increase by another 2 million. The survey<br />
estimates that inflation rates will drop only rnodestly, that realintere-<br />
st rzaes will remai. Ti high.<br />
In the face! olf these difficulties many of the inaustelalised<br />
countries have reSortea. to Lpro~ eco oii sonetimes i-n the<br />
form of hiqjher tariffs, sonetirm er, so-called-voluntary reistrainlts,-<br />
n-od in very lar-g-part, in the for. m of nor-tariff barriers.<br />
InI an att-e~ t' to retiin sh-ares ini e;
have also resorted -to s-ubsiaisingj evports. 17ha best example<br />
ofl-this is t -he I-EC which is S&amp; 46isiv7 heavrily its exports<br />
Of many' agricultural<br />
We lhave alwiays known that. A. stralia as a tradincj nat ion could<br />

hiciher growtLh rate than the OECD) avelracJ; we have had a lower<br />

average in 1981. t0ow w,, e m~ ust recognise that it is much harder<br />
for us to zetain recorde.<br />
All. of you will be aware of how irnportant expor:. Trar~ ets aro<br />
to A~ ustralian industry, the value of our trade is e:; uivalent<br />
to about 30% of our gross domqstic product. The reality of the--<br />
worl econonic situation is that Axistralia's expoort marketzs<br />
hav,, e fallen badly, Between 1979/ 80 an~ d 1.981/ 82 iron and<br />
rsteel pric-as, in constant terms, have fallen from, $ 211 to<br />
$ 163 per tonne, alumzinium prices have fallen from $ 1410 to<br />
$ 1072 per: tonne, copper from .$ 1955 to $ 1231 per tonne, beef<br />
from $ 2267 to $ 1609 per tonne and wheat : from.. $ 147 to 133 per<br />
tonne. In these areas, Atustralia is. prodiicing for the world,<br />
so there is no way prices will pick lip ( mntil world trade pic%. s-__<br />
upP expTort. war'. Iete have beenn one of the factors which<br />
har. siunificantly affected inves tment in Australia. The<br />
growth'in business investrnent, which reached a' 30 year record<br />
jxust a year ago, has v. irtually c-eased, and while invest! ie-nt<br />
remainis at a high level it has done so because a substantial<br />
number of projects previoitsly started have yet to be brought t~ o </p>
