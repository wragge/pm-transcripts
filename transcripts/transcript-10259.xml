March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PRU GO WARD RADIO NATIONAL<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Prime Minister, welcome. Can I begin with Senator Mal Colston he continues to<br />
hang on despite the barrage of criticism from Labor. But how long do you think<br />
before the Government really can't afford him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We're not going to be bulldozed by vitriolic hatred and abuse. I mean, this has not got<br />
anything to do with ethics, it's got nothing to do with parliamentary morality. It is just<br />
a vicious Labor Party pay back to somebody who deserted them. Now I understand<br />
they're angry but that outburst by Robert Ray yesterday said it all to the Australian<br />
public. I mean, this is about a Labor Party pay back, hell hath no fury like the Labor<br />
Party rejected, and frankly as far as we're concerned we will let the law run its course.<br />
If Colston has done anything wrong then the law should apply to him as it would to<br />
you or me. But we're not going to be bulldozed by the Labor Party picking up every<br />
bit of scuttlebutt around this building under parliamentary privilege, hurling it at him.<br />
We'll allow the law to run it's course. We're not going to protect Mal Colston, we're<br />
certainly not going to do that, but we're not going to be swept along in this river of<br />
bile and vitriol which is all borne out of the fact that he left the Labor Party and on a<br />
number of crucial votes voted with us rather than with the Labor Party. Now that's<br />
why the Labor Party's upset. I mean, it's got nothing to do with their concern about<br />
his propriety. If they were all concerned about certain things, many of which are<br />
alleged to have occurred while they were in government, why didn't they get indignant<br />
then? And what I find fascinating is Kim Beazley's uneasy role in this. I mean, he<br />
might ask me a question today because I've actually, I'm raising the matter, but I get<br />
the very distinct impression that this whole thing is being run by Ray and Kim Carr,<br />
sort of, whether Kim Beazley likes it or not. </p>
<p>GO WARD:<br />
Yes, but should a party Senator resign from a party but remain in the Parliament<br />
almost under false pretences?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there are precedents all over the place. Don Chipp resigned from the Liberal<br />
Party in 1977 and remained until the election...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Well that's the Liberal side.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course. And I don't remember people engaging in parliamentary outbursts<br />
against him of the type that Robert Ray engaged in. I mean, he after all formed a party<br />
that secured the balance of power in the Senate. So in long term that probably had<br />
more consequence, far more consequence for us than Colston's behaviour has for the<br />
Labor Party.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But of all these things that have been alleged, some of them as you say will be provable<br />
or not provable by law, but aren't you nonetheless concerned that it casts a shadow not<br />
just on one Senator but on the standing of all parliamentarians?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean, there's nothing I can do about that all I can say is...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Except that they were attached to it...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no hang on. I can say it is my belief that the overwhelming majority of Senators<br />
and Members on both sides of the House, I repeat on both sides of the House, are<br />
completely scrupulous and honest regarding these things. I really do believe that.<br />
Most men and women who come in to parliament are there to do a job according to<br />
their belief systems and, of course when some like this happens, but life's always been<br />
like that. When something goes wrong with a small number of people in a larger<br />
group it always has the potential to reflect on the larger group. There's nothing that<br />
the larger group can do about that except have a procedure for things being<br />
investigated and we are doing that. But I repeat, I'm not going to give a running<br />
commentary on every bit of corridor gossip which under parliamentary privilege<br />
without any kind of substantiation, I mean, did Senator Ray say so and so told me </p>
<p>that you were on such and such a flight, did this did that" there's none of that. And<br />
if the man has done anything wrong well he should be found out and he should pay the<br />
penalty for it but equally he shouldn't be hounded in what is nothing more than a<br />
backyard pay back of the most vicious, open and vitriolic kind.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
All right, but do you want greater scrutiny? Do you feel the public now feels the need<br />
for greater scrutiny of travel allowances and how the honour system works?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think the best thing to do is to allow the processes that are in place now to apply in<br />
relation to the allegations against, the allegations that are being made against particular<br />
people. The question of whether some further, some broad change to the rules down<br />
the track is something that should be considered away from the spotlight of these<br />
allegations. But the danger of doing otherwise is the people say oh there must be<br />
somnething wrong, they must all be doing it".<br />
GO WARD:<br />
It doesn't matter what they think, the electorate is supposed to be...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think it does, it matters a lot what people think and that's the whole trust..., and<br />
what I would say to the Australian public is that I belief that the overwhelming bulk of<br />
people are very scrupulous and completely honest. If you have complaints against<br />
somebody make the complaint to the Minister, to the Federal police, let it be<br />
investigated. We won't interfere we won't stop it, but we're not going to give, sort of,<br />
aid and comfort to every bit of scuttlebutt around the corridors.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Now, Prime Minister, on another issue your Deputy PM, Tim Fischer, has reportedly<br />
told The Age he wants to see a, quote, ' a capital C Conservative' head the High Court<br />
when Justice Brennan retires next year. Now should the country's paramount legal<br />
figure really be above that description, be above prejudice if you like?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think a lot of people have, including judges and retired judges themselves,<br />
talked a lot more openly about how they might be described in their role as judges.<br />
There was a time you would never have had Sir Owen Dickson, for example, talking<br />
about whether he was a black letter lawyer or whether he should pursue a more or less<br />
activist role. But I think it does have to be said in fairness to people like Tim Fischer<br />
that some of the judges themselves have talked more openly, I'm not criticising them<br />
for this incidentally, but there are some I mean, there is one High Court judge in </p>
<p>particular who is renowned for making speeches over the years about all manner of<br />
things. Now once again...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Justice Kirby?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. Now I'm not, I won't express a view at this stage as to whether that is a good or<br />
bad thing, but once you sort of open the door and once you accept that people on the<br />
bench or people recently retired from the bench can talk more openly and in general<br />
terms about their role and categorise themselves and talk about the evolving nature of<br />
the High Court it is inevitable that as part of that expanded debate politicians are going<br />
to do the same thing. Now for my part I'm not going to speculate about Sir Gerard<br />
Brennan's replacement. Under the provisions of the constitution he has to retire when<br />
he reaches the age of 70. I won't be making any comment at all to anybody about his<br />
replacement, who that person may be. All I can say is that the processes of<br />
consultation will go on. We will consult the States, but at the end of the day it is our<br />
decision, it is a very important decision and it will be made conscientiously. But you<br />
won't get any comments from me.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
When your Deputy Prime Minister though criticises the High Court for the slowness of<br />
its decision on Wik, then finds out and accepts the explanations of the Chief Justice in<br />
a private letter but fails then to correct the public record, is the public entitled to think<br />
that you are putting as a Government, or certainly the Deputy Prime Minister, is<br />
putting pressure on the High Court?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. GO WARD:<br />
Well, why didn't he correct the record? ( inaudible)...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it was self-evident what had happened self-evident.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Was it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. Quite self-evident. </p>
<p>GO WARD:<br />
He got the letter on the third of January.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He released it as I understand it, he released it.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Yes.... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I mean, if you release the letter.., the correspondence covers it all. I didn't think<br />
there was any need for any further comment.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But it wasn't released until this month.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, because a freedom of information request was made which puzzled me anyway.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
So you don't think the public should have any concern over your wish to put pressure<br />
on the High Court?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I don't regard anything that Tim Fischer did as putting pressure on the High<br />
Court, no. The point I should make about that is that Sir Gerard Brennan in his reply<br />
emphasised the fact that there is absolutely no constraint on people debating and<br />
criticising decisions of the court. This is something that is often misunderstood.<br />
People regard the criticism of a judgment as being in some way improper. It never has<br />
been and it never ought to be. The only thing that oughtn't to happen is that the<br />
integrity of the bench should not be attacked and their application to work not<br />
attacked. Now, they are the two things.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Can I look at Papua New Guinea, Prime Minister? How serious do you believe the<br />
situation is there now when your foreign minister has cancelled a trip to stay home and<br />
monitor the situation? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it is a serious situation. It was a serious situation last week when I first spoke<br />
about it and it remains a source of very great concern to me.<br />
GOWARD:<br />
What do you think might happen....?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, Pru, a number of things could happen. I hope the mercenaries are not deployed<br />
on Bougainville and we are bending all of our own efforts and we are encouraging<br />
others to bend their efforts to stop that occurring, and I don't want anybody to be in<br />
any doubt that we have put that view very strongly to the PNG Government. But it is<br />
an independent country with all the sensitivity of a former colony, if I can put it that<br />
way, towards a former colonial power. And it is always going to be a relationship that<br />
has to be handled with that care and sensitivity that the relationship borne out of that<br />
former association always produces.<br />
GOWARD: Legal Aid, Prime Minister. It is a national day of protest today. Are you at all<br />
concerned that the nub of the claim which is that essentially people might be able to<br />
walk free should be in jail because they haven't been given a proper defence?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the nub of claim is, the nub of the issue is really whether what we have done is<br />
fair and reasonable. What we have said is that the Commonwealth will fund matters<br />
under Commonwealth law and the States ought to fund matters under State law. Over<br />
the years there is plenty of evidence, and I gave some of it in the House yesterday, of<br />
where money we have put in the past has been diverted to fund State matters, so you'd<br />
have to apply that principle to each case. Now, the one that's received publicity, the<br />
Mantiri case, that is fully covered by current Commonwealth funding until the 30th of<br />
June because the new arrangement doesn't come in operation until the end of this<br />
financial year.<br />
GOWARD:<br />
But clearly a Mantiri case could arise in the next financial year.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but if a case like that arises, it is just not good enough for the States to say " well,<br />
it's your responsibility", you've got to look at under whose law the person is being<br />
prosecuted and whether the funds are available. </p>
<p>GO WARD:<br />
Prime Minister, you are tough on States aren't you? I mean, that's a $ 120 million you<br />
are taking out....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What do you mean, I'm tough on the States?<br />
GO WARD:<br />
You are taking $ 120 million out of their budgets...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but over the years, over a period of years, not annually. I mean, this business of<br />
automatically multiplying everything by four but forgetting to tell the public... I'm not<br />
criticising.., because it's become a bad habit here. You multiply by three or four, you<br />
use the global amount and everybody thinks that's an annual amount. It's not an<br />
annual amount, it's less than that.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Do you accept though that the States are doing it tough at the moment? I mean<br />
you've got Jeff Kennett now raising the possibility that they just can't wear another big<br />
budget cut this year from you, and that he wants to hear...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we haven't said anything about what approach we are going to take at the<br />
coming Premiers' Conference. I recognise that the States made a contribution last<br />
year. Do I think they are doing it tough? I think all governments have got to live<br />
within their means. We are doing it tough. We inherited the $ 10 billion deficit. That's<br />
tougher than any of the States are doing it. I mean, we've got to do something about<br />
it, because we ultimately provide the safety net in this country. We look after people<br />
as far as unemployment benefits and pensions are concerned. We have a very big<br />
underlying deficit, we cut a lot out of it last year and we've got to cut more out of it<br />
this year. Nobody should run away with the idea that the Commonwealth is a<br />
bottomless pit. I mean it is not. And at the end of the day we are the people who raise<br />
the taxes. When people think of taxation in this country they think federal, they don't<br />
think State, and the sensitivity of the Australian public towards taxation and funds<br />
raising is something that's directed towards the Federal Government.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
And so you feel the issue of legal assistance and getting a fair trial is not your<br />
responsibility? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is our responsibility for matters under Commonwealth law and we think it's the<br />
responsibility of the States for matters under State law. I mean, the States are always<br />
saying that there should be a clearer delineation of authority and you shouldn't confuse<br />
roles, they're always very keen to defend their own independence in certain areas and I<br />
understand and respect that. So let's apply the principle. I mean we will fund matters<br />
under Commonwealth law, let the States fund matters under State law. It's a fair<br />
principle isn't it?<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Prime Minister, to mark your first anniversary you made several strong criticisms of<br />
gambling. Is this a personal issue for you or do you actually believe the<br />
Commonwealth Government ultimately might be moved to do something about it<br />
legislatively? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm not contemplating any legislation. I would think that's unthinkable. Look, it<br />
is not for a government to tell people that they can't gamble or whatever, any more<br />
than for a government to say to people you can't have a drink. I mean, Heavens<br />
above, we're not wowsers.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Well, it is tough on the States again isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's not a question of being tough on the States, I mean, Heavens above, there is clear<br />
evidence that some people who can't afford to gamble are doing so and they are<br />
paying a very heavy price and so are their families and so are small businesses. Now, I<br />
expressed a concern that gambling may have reached saturation point in this country. I<br />
don't regret saying that, I don't resile from it one iota. I believe it. You say is it a<br />
strong personal view of mine, well, it is, but not fanatically so. I don't have any sort of<br />
personal problem with gambling. I don't gamble much myself<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Have you ever placed a bet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Once about twice in my life. Yes, I'm not a gambling man, no. But I don't care<br />
about it doesn't sort of trouble me in a social sense. I get a bit troubled if people do<br />
it to excess because I feel sorry for the price that they pay and it is a very heavy price.<br />
Now, that's why I raised the matter, and there is a lot of community concern about it. </p>
<p>Don't anybody underestimate the level of community concern about this. Now, it is<br />
not an attack on the States.<br />
GOWARD: But from their point of view Prime Minister, it is a voluntary tax, you don't have to<br />
gamble, and they find it hard to<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I suppose that's the equivalent of saying, I mean, it is no more voluntary than<br />
any other tax, Pru. It's like the equivalent of saying you don't have to buy something<br />
on which sales tax is levied. I mean, look of course people don't have to gamble.<br />
What I am concerned about is that a small section of the population, to use your<br />
expression a few moments ago, is really doing it very hard and I wouldn't want to see<br />
any further expansion of gambling facilities in this country, but any suggestion that we<br />
would legislate, no of course we are not going to legislate, but can't a Prime Minister<br />
or a Premier or a senior political figure from time to time express a view about<br />
something which isn't on the balance sheet, hasn't got to do with the budget, hasn't<br />
got to do with micro-economic reform, or taxation or economics....<br />
GOWARD: I'm not... certainly it has been welcomed by the...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean it is the totality of one's view towards society that surely counts in this job.<br />
GOWARD: Prime Minister, thanks for your time this morning. </p>
