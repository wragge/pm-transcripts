AUSTRALIA'S BICENTENARY 1988: THE'AUSTRALIAN ACHIEVEMENT<br />
The Commonwealth Government has recently given further<br />
detailed consideration to the philosophy and overall strategy<br />
for Australia's bicentenary celebrations in 1988. This further<br />
development of the Government's thinking provides additional<br />
guidance to the Australian Bicentennial Authority in meeting<br />
its responsibility of planning and staging the Commonwealth<br />
Government's contribution to this historic commemoration.<br />
The general principles on which the ABA was established were<br />
outlined in my speech to the Parliament on 5 April 1979.<br />
These principles were:<br />
to make reconmendations to the Government in relation to<br />
a " theme" and a " focus" for the celebrations;<br />
to recommend concrete programmes hy which the commemoration<br />
will find expression;'<br />
to seek to involve all sections of the community individually<br />
and collectively in the celebration and to encourage<br />
initiatives at the grass roots of Australian society;<br />
to make recommendations on the matter of international<br />
participation.<br />
It has now been decided that the major theme of the<br />
Bicentennial programme will be " The Australian Achievement".<br />
This theme will encompass positive achievements and triumphs<br />
over adversity and social problems. It will focus attention<br />
on the goals and values of the Australian people, and on<br />
future achievements to which Australians can aspire. It will<br />
stimulate pride in Australia. It will include the variety<br />
of aspects of Australian life. It will recognise that the<br />
Bicentennial is primarily an Australian occasion, while also<br />
encouraging international participation and inviting<br />
consideration of our relationships to the rest of the world.<br />
The Bicentennial will celebrate not just one event, but<br />
the efforts and achievements\ of millions of Australians. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Australians will choose to celebrate the Bicentenary in<br />
many ways using their own ideas and resources. ' The<br />
celebrations-will reflect the various perspectives which<br />
people have on Australia and Australian history, as well<br />
as people's hopes and expectations for the future. Its<br />
success will depend largely on community enthusiasm.<br />
Bicentennial activities should obviously be such as to<br />
unite Australia.<br />
Many annual events on the Australian calender, such as<br />
sporting-finals and cultural festivals, will obviously be<br />
given a bicentennial imprint by their organisers. This<br />
kind of imprint on regular Australian events will have a<br />
particular value in linking the Bicentennial with the<br />
Australian way of life. Responsibility for preparing the<br />
overall set of activities is a matter for co-operation<br />
between federal, state and local governments, the private<br />
sector, and the community generally. Maximum community<br />
involvement will be sought.<br />
It is important to ensure the maximum possible degree of<br />
co-operation between and within all spheres of government<br />
and between go vernment and the private sector. Indeed, the<br />
celebrations should receive their impetus from the enthusiasm<br />
and involvement of local communities which will be complemented<br />
by activities planned at the national level.<br />
The Commonwealth Government will concentrate its efforts on<br />
the national and international aspects of the Bicentennial.<br />
The national programme celebrating Australia's achievements<br />
will be one in which people from every part of Australia<br />
will be involved, right down to the local level. The Bicentennial<br />
must be an occasion for all Australians, and the celebrations<br />
must provide for all Australians entertainment and enjoyment<br />
across a wide range of events and activities.<br />
The Government does not believe that a special. ised international<br />
exposition would be appropriate for the Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
An outlay in excess of $ 200m zat present prices would be<br />
required * to stage such an exposition successfully. Such an<br />
expenditure for a single, fixed event would be both inappropriate<br />
and inconsistent with the need for the Government to support<br />
national and international events which would reach people<br />
across the nation.<br />
The Government believes that in addition to providing for a<br />
celebration of Australia, by Austral. ians, for Australians, it<br />
will be possible for us to involve those countries with which<br />
Australia has close ties, through migration, trade,<br />
cultural links and so on, and which would want to make their<br />
distinctive contribution to this Australian celebration.<br />
Several kinds of international involvement in the Bicentennial<br />
would be desirable. In some areas, such as major sporting<br />
events, international participation is obviously essential.<br />
More broadly, it would be desirable for leading world figures<br />
to visit' Australia, and for tours by international orchestras,<br />
dance companies, and so on to be organised. It may be possible<br />
to develop a programme whereby some countries which wish to mark<br />
their recognition of the Bicentenary could contribute a permanent<br />
and useful memorial. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
The maximium involvement of Australians should be sought<br />
by celebrating achievements in a large number of areas of<br />
Australian life. The areas to be celebrated will include:<br />
political democracy<br />
private enterprise<br />
trade unionism<br />
eduational, intellectual and technical achievements<br />
the multicultural society<br />
the contribution of Aboriginals<br />
artistic and cultural achievements<br />
military achievement<br />
sporting achievement<br />
interest in the Australian environment<br />
Australia's international contribution<br />
Consideration will be given to establishing an exciting and<br />
comprehensive exhibition on " The Australian Achievement"<br />
to travel around the nation during 1988, possibly assodiated<br />
with appropriate entertainment and cultural events. Smaller<br />
versions of the main exhibition would be established to<br />
tour country towns.<br />
The ABA has the responsibility to recom-mend a concrete programme<br />
of events and projects to the Government.<br />
It is important that a balance be struck in this programmne<br />
between: celebrations or educational activities designed to<br />
commemorate themes and historical events ( such as<br />
the " Tall Ships" concept, exhibitions and publications)<br />
adding a bicentennial dimension to events which would<br />
occur as a matter of course, or to sponsor unique<br />
events to celebrate the Bicentennial<br />
seeking permanent memorials of the Bicentenary for the<br />
future.<br />
In drawing up a programme of national events and projects,<br />
the ABA will bear in mind<br />
an appropriate balance of entertainment and educative<br />
interest<br />
( b consistency with the-theme of the Bicentenary and as<br />
such association with significant aspects of Australia'a<br />
achievements its history, culture and future; </p>
<p>significance for the community at large; and<br />
accessibil-ity to as-many Australians as possible.<br />
Many of the individual Bicentennial events and projects<br />
will be the responsibility of State and local government<br />
authorities, organisations and individuals in the community<br />
as well as the Commonwealth.<br />
Ministers will be examining whether events within the scope<br />
of their portfolios might be programmed to fall within<br />
the Bicentennial activities.<br />
The ABA will, be the co-ordinating focus for planning the<br />
activities. It will be important for it to ensure that the<br />
diverse range of individual projects, and activities would<br />
be co-ordinated within the overall framework of celebrating<br />
200 years of Australian achievement. The ABA will also<br />
implement those elements of the national programme for<br />
which the Government feels it should be directly responsible.<br />
The ABA has a further responsibility to act as a cataly~ ft,<br />
as a clearing house for ideas and a source of advice to<br />
the community generally. It should draw to the attention<br />
of the principal institutions of Australian life possibilities<br />
for activities which could contribute to the overall national<br />
programme. The ABA's activities willobviously need to be<br />
informed by a recognition that the success of the Bicentennial<br />
celebration will depend on a high level of private community<br />
enthusiasm and involvement which will be largely self-financing.<br />
So far as the national programme is concerned, there is<br />
room for a variety of funding approaches. In some cases<br />
events may be funded solely by the Commonwealth. In others,<br />
there could be Commonwealth assistance additional to other<br />
sources of funding. And there would also be a number of<br />
natLional events which would be entirely self-financing.<br />
Events and projects need to be looked at on a case-by--case<br />
basis. I am sure that with the involvement of all Australians,<br />
supported by Governments in the way I have outlined, the<br />
Bicentenary will be an outstanding success, a great mark<br />
of Australian achievement. 000---</p>
