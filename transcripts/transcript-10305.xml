16 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WITH ANNA REYNOLDS, RADIO 4 QR<br />
E REYNOLDS:<br />
Mr Howard good morning and thank you very much for coming in.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's very nice to be here Anna.<br />
REYNOLDS:<br />
Welcome to Queensland.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's always a pleasure to be here in Queensland.<br />
REYNOLDS:<br />
In Rob Borbidge territory. He was sitting in that chair last week, had some pretty<br />
harsh words to say about you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think they'd have been too harsh. We get on pretty well. He's got a job to do<br />
for Queensland and he does it very well. We have a very good working relationship. I<br />
appreciated the very courageous support his Government gave me last year on gun<br />
control legislation. I know that wasn't easy for some of his party members and I am<br />
very conscious of that but he took a broad, national view which befits a person who I<br />
think has a very balanced and mature view of important issues. </p>
<p>REYNOLDS: He wants the political payback from you now though.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think he would put it in those terms<br />
REYNOLDS: That's what it is though, isn't it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And I don't think it should be. He wants what I want and that is a workable solution<br />
that respects native title but delivers certainty to farmers. They're the goals I've set<br />
myself I want a workable solution. I don't want a solution that produces endless<br />
layers of additional litigation. I do respect native title but you've got to understand<br />
that the Wik decision turned on its head the expectations of Australian farmers and the<br />
common belief of everybody, Paul Keating said pastoral leases had extinguished native<br />
title. It was acknowledged by Aboriginal leaders. The farmers believed it. They were<br />
led to believe that by the National Farmers Federation in 1993 so the starting point of<br />
understanding what is a fair outcome is to appreciate the extent to which the Wik<br />
decision defied the expectations of most sections of the Australian community and we<br />
have to understand that you need a workable solution, one that respects native title. I<br />
don't want to throw the Mabo decision out. I want to try and accommodate the<br />
interests of the Aboriginal community but I also want a decision that delivers security<br />
for farmers. It's very hard..<br />
REYNOLDS: I'm just wondering how you are, are you a magician? Are you going to pull this out of<br />
the air magically?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it's one of those things where everybody should avoid the cheap shot. It's not<br />
easy and it's very easy for people who don't have the responsibility of trying to get<br />
everybody together to say, it's taking too long. I mean, I notice with respect a couple<br />
of my State Premier colleagues sort of saying, it's all taking too long. I just say to<br />
them, this is not something for cheap rhetoric. It's a question of sitting down and<br />
understanding that in order to reach a fair accommodation time is required. I hope we<br />
can.. REYNOLDS: What is the time table? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well as soon as I can but surely the right decision is more important than whether it's<br />
today or tomorrow or next week. I mean, this obsession with whether a particular<br />
time table has been reached is really trivialising it. It's not really helping. People have<br />
got to understand that this particular issue poses one of the great threats to the<br />
instability of our land management system that we've had since European settlement in<br />
this country and it can't be lightly dealt with and the debate shouldn't be coloured with<br />
facetious references to racism or things of that kind. We will not have a racist<br />
outcome, we will have a fair outcome.<br />
REYNOLDS: Well in terms of some of the alternatives, codification has been mentioned. Can you<br />
just sort of flesh out some of the possibilities?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well everybody has a different view. What I am trying to do is to get the parties to<br />
accept a proposal that preserves the fabric intact of the Mabo decision, recognises the<br />
instability created by the Wik decision and tries to address the impact of that instability<br />
so far as the pastoralists and the farmers are concerned.<br />
REYNOLDS: So that's not recognising the outcome of the Wik decision? That's not entrenching<br />
native title?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the problem with the Wik decision is it destroyed everybody's understanding of<br />
where they stood but I am going to try and get a fair, a workable outcome and one that<br />
is in all of the circumstances fair to everybody. Now I don't think I've got it at the<br />
moment and I will be the first to acknowledge that it's very difficult and I don't expect<br />
people to sort of have endless patience on it either but I do say to people, this is not an<br />
issue for easy, throwaway lines and it's not an issue for extravagant language.<br />
REYNOLDS: You said just a moment ago you haven't got it at the moment. How confident are you<br />
you will be...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't know. I will be talking to the Aboriginal leaders again on Friday in<br />
Canberra. I will be talking again to the Western Australian Premier on Friday. I will<br />
probably talk by phone to Mr Borbidge. He's in Japan I think at the present time. I<br />
will probably talk to him by phone today and I will talk to any other Premier. Look, I </p>
<p>understand the Queensland Premier's concern about this. The area of Australia<br />
potentially claimable, I use the words potentially claimable post Wik is something like<br />
78%. Of course that's the vacant Crown land plus pastoral leaseholds. Now that is a<br />
breathtaking figure and people have to understand that and when they're addressing it<br />
you can't look at it in terms at sort of some emotional, rhetorical responses.<br />
REYNOLDS: All right. I'd like to move onto another issue now the Senator Mal Colston affair.<br />
Do you like him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't know him very well and it's irrelevant whether I like him or I dislike him.<br />
The little contact I've had with him and can I say, I've probably only had three or four<br />
conversations with him in my life and I've certainly not had any conversations with him<br />
in the last six or nine months. I've, I don't have a strong view either way. I've no<br />
reason to personally dislike him but look, that's not the issue. The issue is that until<br />
January of this year I was not aware personally, I had no recollection until January of<br />
this year of any allegations about him having rorted his travel allowance. Now that<br />
makes me very different from Mr Beazley. I just want to make this point, that Mr<br />
Beazley and Mr Evans knew 13 years ago that there were allegations about him rorting<br />
travel allowances. I knew in January of this year and it's a very big difference. Mr<br />
Beazley is running around at the moment saying that in 1983 he behaved no differently<br />
than Kevin Newman in the Fraser Government had behaved in 1982. What Kevin<br />
Newman according to the files did, I didn't know about it at the time, because I<br />
wouldn't of necessity be involved, what he did, he wanted to send it off to the police<br />
then and he was advised by his Department there was insufficient justification for doing<br />
so. He then wrote off to the Acting Attorney General. He behaved impeccably,<br />
Beazley and Evans decided to reject legal advice to send it to the police so therefore<br />
they have no credibility at all in attacking us.<br />
When we found out about it I said that anybody accused of doing these things should<br />
be treated in the same way as another citizen. They shouldn't be given an unfair trial<br />
but equally they should face the full rigour of the law and we have now sent the thing<br />
off to the Australian Federal Police. We are doing the correct thing and I think this<br />
attempt by Mr Beazley to say, you know, really both of us 1 3 or 14 years ago did<br />
things badly. I didn't know anything about his behaviour 13 or 14 years ago. It was in<br />
January to my recollection that I first heard of any allegations and of course they are<br />
the allegations which are now the subject of investigation by the Federal Police.<br />
REYNOLDS: We are getting a lot of feedback from people saying that he really should resign as<br />
Deputy President. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Now I said that last week and I have also said that, and let me repeat it again, that if<br />
Senator Colston has not resigned as Deputy President by the time the Parliament meets<br />
again then our numbers are there to vote him out. I said that last week. There should<br />
be no doubt, I noticed one of our papers this morning, the Sydney Morning Herald had<br />
this peculiar editorial suggesting that I still hadn't made it clear where we stood on the<br />
question of his resignation.<br />
REYNOLDS: All right. Just in relation to the Senate Privileges Committee, why shouldn't they have<br />
a look at it'? Wouldn't that be reasonable in the circumstances?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Senator Hill's view on that as Leader of the Government in the Senate, I think it has<br />
some substance, is that you've got a police investigation going on at the present time.<br />
To use the old saying, it's a bit like having a dog and barking, but can I just say one<br />
thing further, we discussed this matter yesterday in Brisbane at our Cabinet meeting at<br />
very great lengths and I'm making it clear this morning that in all of the circumstances<br />
if Senator Colston remains a member of the Senate we will not in future accept his<br />
vote. REYNOLDS: Is that right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We won't. We have decided that in the future, if he remains a Member, if he purports<br />
to vote with us we will arrange for one of our Senators to absent himself or herself<br />
from the division and we've taken that decision because we think that is the right<br />
response in all of the circumstances. The Senate has no power to expel a Senator and<br />
frankly I don't think either house of Parliament should have the power to expel<br />
somebody. In the whole history of federation, to my understanding only one person<br />
has ever been expelled and that was in 1920. A Labor Member for Kalgoorlie was<br />
expelled at the height of the Anglo Irish argument over Irish home rule and there were<br />
great overtones of sectarianism at the time of that and ever since then, people have<br />
shied away from the notion that Parliament should be able to expel its own members<br />
and in fact in 1987 the former Government put forward a bill to take the power of<br />
expulsion away from the Senate so the question of whether he stays in the Senate or<br />
not is ultimately a matter for him and the operation of the law but for so long as stays<br />
there and until this matter is resolved we won't accept his vote in the future.<br />
REYNOLDS: So from when the Senate sits again.. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
From when the Senate sits I give notice that we will not accept his vote and the way<br />
that we will not accept his vote is that we will arrange that if he does decide to support<br />
the Government on an issue, we will arrange for one of our number to drop out of the<br />
division so that his vote is not in effect counted. Now...<br />
REYNOLDS: And is this recognition of the really serious damage this is doing your Government in<br />
the electorate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a recognition in the mind of the Government that it's the right thing to do to assert<br />
standards and to assert the perception of the importance of standards. Now I still<br />
believe that like any other citizen he is entitled to his day in court. I don't know the full<br />
ramifications of all of the allegations. I only know what is on the public record and<br />
however strongly people may feel about him, my responsibility is to support the rule of<br />
law and to say that Mal Colston, like any other citizen, is entitled to a day in court.<br />
He's entitled to a fair trial, all the other generic descriptions we use to describe our<br />
system of the presumption of innocence. Now the presumption of innocence...<br />
REYNOLDS: So he's innocent until proven guilty but you won't accept his vote?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we are entitled to do that. I mean, that's not making a judgement about him. It's<br />
making, it's making...<br />
REYNOLDS:<br />
What is it saying about him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it is saying that in the circumstances and until these allegations are resolved, we<br />
don't think it is appropriate to accept his vote. Now what the Labor Party does, the<br />
Labor Party really should adopt the same attitude but let me make it clear, our<br />
declaration is not conditional on the Labor Party, ours is unilateral, it is not<br />
conditional. I mean, I can't believe that the Labor Party will accept his vote. I assume<br />
of course that if Senator Colston had still been a member of the Labor Party and these<br />
allegations had come up but after what I've heard from Senator Ray and Mr Beazley<br />
and Mr Evans they would of course have adopted the same approach that I am<br />
announcing this morning but I don't really care what they do. For the Government's<br />
point of view when the Senate sits, we won't accept his vote. </p>
<p>REYNOLDS: What do you expect him to do?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know. I mean, I really don't know.<br />
REYNOLDS: You haven't talked to him on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I haven't and that is a matter for him. I have no idea what he is going to do.<br />
REYNOLDS: What do you think of his behaviour over the years?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, as I say, to the best of my recollection, the first I knew about these allegations<br />
was in January and...<br />
REYNOLDS: But you've been reading the papers like everybody else. You've heard the stories<br />
about what has been coming up.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look, the allegations, I mean, if the allegations are true then it's very, very poor<br />
behaviour, obviously, to say the least. But I am quite serious in saying that everybody<br />
in our system is entitled to a presumption of innocence and when a Prime Minister gets<br />
to a situation of accepting somebody a being guilty until he or she is proven guilty then<br />
I think you are behaving in an irresponsible fashion. Now what we have done has been<br />
measured, responsible, correct. What I am announcing this morning is a very, very<br />
cle ar message to the people of Australia that until this matter is cleared up we are not<br />
going to accept his vote. Now he may choose to do what he will. That's his right.<br />
REYNOLDS: Is there much point him staying in the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is a matter for him to decide. I mean, a lot of people would think not but that is<br />
entirely a matter for him at the end of the day but I am making it clear that until the </p>
<p>matter is resolved then we won't accept his vote and I have explained how we will do<br />
it. Now I would imagine that he would behave in the same, I imagine the Labor Party<br />
would reciprocate but that's a matter for the Labor Party.<br />
REYNOLDS: We'd better take some calls now. I mean I've got lots more questions for you but<br />
people are interested, really interested in having a chat so if you could put those<br />
headphones on, Liz, good morning.<br />
CALLER:<br />
Welcome Mr Howard to Queensland.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hello Liz.<br />
CALLER: You've answered some of my questions in your discussion there. I think we should<br />
believe in the presumption of innocence until proven guilty too. But I'm quite curious<br />
with this Colston affair how far back we're going to look at these travel rorts and<br />
given Mr Colston's alleged previous misdemeanour in this matter that you're looking<br />
back at that, are you also going to look back at our previous Prime Minister's history<br />
and why action wasn't taken against him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, my view would be that if any substantial evidence is distinct from insubstantial<br />
allegation were presented in writing to anybody it would be investigated. I don't have<br />
any particular desire to persecute my predecessor. I think the Australian people did a<br />
good job on him 14 months ago. And I'm not particularly into witch hunts because he<br />
was a former Labor Prime Minister. But we're all in the same boat. If anybody's got<br />
any evidence as distinct from scuttlebutt about anybody, well, they're entitled to bring<br />
it forward to the authorities.<br />
REYNOLDS: Alan, good morning.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Mr Howard.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning. </p>
<p>CALLER: Welcome to Brisbane.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you.<br />
CALLER: Mr Howard, I'm not racist or radical. I hold conservative views. But for many years<br />
I've been concerned with the state of Aboriginals in the Kimberleys and outback<br />
Queensland and through the Territory. Years ago I used to work around those areas<br />
and I you know and what I want to draw attention to firstly is the fact that we've<br />
spent billions of dollars over the last I mean, I hear the figure $ 13 billion over the last<br />
13 years bandied around quite frequently. I have no way of checking if it's true or not<br />
and REYNOLDS:<br />
What's your question Alan?<br />
CALLER: ( inaudible) lost lots of money and it's never got to a source, you know, where it was<br />
needed to be spent. But my question is really about Pauline Hanson. And, you know,<br />
we've got to admit she's got a lot of courage and she's drawing attention to a problem<br />
that does exist and about which very little has been done for a long, long time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What's your question though?<br />
CALLER: I really want to know why is she been pilloried by Labor, Aborigines, various<br />
politicians, press and the media people? The Mayor of Brisbane this morning called<br />
her an evil woman.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I saw that outburst by the Mayor of Brisbane. I've got to say that is one of the<br />
most unintelligent, uninformed comments I've heard in politics for quite a while. To<br />
liken Pauline Hanson to Adolf Hitler is to betray an absolutely abysmal understanding<br />
of history. It is also that kind of extreme comment which diminishes the quality of<br />
objective criticism of what she has done and what she stands for. I mean, one way to<br />
sort of lose an argument with somebody is to go over the top. And I think the Mayor<br />
of Brisbane went right over the top and in the process has actually done the cause of<br />
legitimate dissent from what the Member for Oxley is putting forward a great deal of </p>
<p>damage. I mean, my view about the Member for Oxley is that there has been a massive<br />
over preoccupation with her by the press, I'm sorry to say, more heavily in some areas<br />
of the press than others. But I won't be any more detailed than that this morning. And<br />
I just think I mean, I've come back from China recently and the issue was certainly<br />
not on top of mind over there. I think this whole business of preoccupation of some<br />
sections of the Australian media was ridiculous. There was a four paragraph report<br />
sourced from AAP on page 7 of the Str-aits Times in Singapore and that was the basis<br />
of four or five questions at a press conference by the Australian media. Now, I really<br />
think the whole thing has got out of proportion.<br />
REYNOLDS:<br />
Well you can say that but that doesn't take account of the talkback we're getting. I<br />
mean, we get lots of calls about... ( inaudible)...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I know you get a lot, I know you get a lot of the calls but...<br />
REYNOLDS: ( inaudible) and people are interested and people are...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look, I'm happy to talk about the issues that are involved. And I've said before<br />
that the Australian community has gone through an enormous amount of change and<br />
there's been a lot of strain put on people and put on rural people as a result of that<br />
change over the last few years. And to some extent it is easy to tap discontent, and if<br />
you use fairly simplistic language. Now, as in every, all things, there are some things<br />
that everybody says at various stages that I might agree with. I mean, obviously we<br />
can't have unlimited immigration to Australia. Obviously we need to respect the<br />
traditions and the cultures of this country but we also need to be a very tolerant<br />
country. And one of the great things about Australia is that we are tolerant. And one<br />
of the things that I resent about the tide of political correctness of recent years is that it<br />
has endeavoured to paint Australians as a bigoted, racist, intolerant group of people<br />
when plainly we are not.<br />
REYNOLDS: Do you think Pauline Hanson's a racist?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I wouldn't use that expression, no. I think the expression racist is used altogether too<br />
freely in this country. All together too freely. Oh look, I think her criticisms last year<br />
in two particular respects were quite inaccurate. I mean, the Aboriginal community<br />
remains, as a group, the most underprivileged in Australia. And it Is as the gentlemen,<br />
Alan, just said, a scandal that we have spent large amounts of money over the years </p>
<p>and the standard of Aboriginal health has not risen. Now, it's a very difficult issue and<br />
will take...<br />
REYNOLDS: So we should still maintain special funding to Aboriginal groups?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course you should maintain some special funding but you have a right to<br />
redirect it towards health, education and housing. And you have a right to assert that<br />
throwing money after a problem is not the only response. And you have a right to<br />
point out, without being criticised as a racist, you have a right to point out that there<br />
are attitudinal reasons and within both the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities<br />
as to why some of these difficulties continue.<br />
REYNOLDS: Okay. We should move on to a couple of other calls now. Henry, good morning. Yes<br />
Henry. Yes you're on.<br />
CALLER: Oh, I beg your pardon, an aircraft was just flying over. Good morning Mr Prime<br />
Minister. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Henry.<br />
CALLER: I have a few little questions for you John. Why have you got into the pensioners?<br />
PRIME MhIISTER:<br />
Why have a I got into the pensioners?<br />
CALLER: You cut off the home equity loan and all those<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I haven't got into the pensioners at all. That is I mean, we give good things, for<br />
example, for... </p>
<p>CALLER: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
self funded retirees and we delivered in full, on time in relation to our commitment to<br />
them. I haven't got into the pensioners at all.<br />
CALLER:<br />
My sister in Rockhampton, 82, and I had to go down and get a home equity loan from<br />
her... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A home equity loan?<br />
CALLER: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But is that something the Government provides?<br />
CALLER: Yes it is. It would help you. It was done through a State Bank down there.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The State Bank.<br />
CALLER: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look, if you'd like to speak to my... write to me about that, I will investigate it.<br />
But I'm puzzled at your allegation.<br />
CALLER: Look, as soon as you got into power, elected in March, and at June, the 28th of June<br />
last year it was just taken off. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'd like to investigate it. I don't recall the decision that I took that affected your<br />
sister. But I will be very happy to investigate it. I can't imagine I'd have done that.<br />
CALLER: Well that's what happened...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's just not out of character.<br />
REYNOLDS: All right Henry, the Prime Minister's agreed to take that one up for you. Thank you.<br />
Joining us next is Tina, good morning.<br />
CALLER:<br />
What do you think of the social countries where the government takes the guns, the<br />
land and they abolish freedom and implement total control?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm against it. I'm completely against it.<br />
CALLER: Right. What do you have to say to Australians, the vast minority, who know that only<br />
the worst governments take the guns off the people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well if you're talking about the laws that I was responsible for last year, and I think<br />
you may be, then I don't agree with you. I think what I did last year expanded<br />
peoples' freedom because it meant that a large section of the population felt freer to go<br />
about their daily lives without the threat of being the subject of unwanted violence with<br />
automatic and semi-automatic weapons. See, when people talk about freedom they<br />
forget that one of the strongest freedoms, the greatest freedoms you can have is<br />
freedom from fear. And I think in a peaceful democratic society the right to walk<br />
around on a pleasant Sunday afternoon, the right to go about your daily lives, the right<br />
to go out at night without fear of violence, is one of the most precious things that can<br />
be given by any government and any steps taken by any government to improve the<br />
physical safety and security of citizens is something that I very strongly support. </p>
<p>REYNOLDS: Grahame, good morning.<br />
CALLER: Oh, good morning John.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning.<br />
CALLER: I recently had to have a hernia operation for which I had to wait six months. During<br />
this time I talked with other people on the waiting lists, some serious and some not so<br />
serious. Now, it seems to me that during this time there are people who are waiting<br />
and the impression I have is that there are more people who had serious problems,<br />
dying and incapacitated, every month than were killed or injured at the problems we<br />
had in Tasmania. Now the reason I could not afford attention sooner is because I was<br />
involved in a fraud. Now this fraud occurred in New South Wales. But I approached<br />
the New South Wales Fraud Squad and also the Australian Securities Commission in<br />
New South Wales...<br />
REYNOLDS: Hang on a tick Grahame, let's cut to the question here.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What's the question?<br />
CALLER: The question is regarding Mal Colston etc. You can involve the police to investigate<br />
this matter but for a private citizen to have something investigated of a very serious<br />
nature like a million dollars or $ 200 000, you can't get a response.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Have you spoken to your local member of Parliament about this? I think you should.<br />
I think you ought to talk both to your local State and Federal member of Parliament<br />
about it and if there's substance in it I'm sure those members will pursue on your<br />
behalf. REYNOLDS: All right. Thank you for that. Joining us next is Ted, good morning. </p>
<p>CALLER: Good morning Anna. Thank you for your time Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Ted.<br />
CALLER: I believe our Premier, Rob Borbidge, is jumping on the Hanson, One Nation,<br />
bandwagon and I think..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't... I1th ink that's grossly unfair to say that.<br />
CALLER: Well I justify that statement by saying that the National Party President ( sic) in the last<br />
couple of days, Ken Crooke, said as much by saying that their policies were similar and<br />
he.. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look I look, I remember Rob Borbidge actually making quite a strong statement<br />
about this issue last year. And I think it's quite-and all of my dealings with Rob<br />
Borbidge suggests that he's got, of course, intelligently conservative values on lots of<br />
issues as I hope I have. But he's a very tolerant person and I think you're trying to<br />
make a bit of a political point..<br />
REYNOLDS: All right, thanks for that Ted. Well there's still people waiting.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't mind.<br />
REYNOLDS: Are you right to take a couple more?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah, unless my minders tell me. </p>
<p>REYNOLDS: They're getting a bit restless.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they can they'll have to wait. I've got to go and launch the Green Corps. The<br />
Green Corps I mean, there are projects in that for Queensland so I don't want to keep<br />
it waiting too long. But if you've got a couple more question I'll be happy...<br />
REYNOLDS: All right, okay. Neville, good morning.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Mr Howard. I commend you Prime Minister on your stand for decency<br />
and the concern for the families of Australia. But may I say that my question<br />
( inaudible) around the concern that I and my wife and many of my friends have, and<br />
we're grandparents, about a discussion paper which just recently we've been aware of<br />
that's come from the Federal Attorney-General's office. One other thing Mr Howard,<br />
that proposal of sexual activity be recognised, authorised, made lawful between people<br />
who are as young as 10 years of age and decriminalising the offence of incest. It goes<br />
further. But Mr Howard, are you aware of this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm aware of debate about the attempts to have a uniform age of consent and that<br />
involves bringing in to line the age of consent involving homosexual and heterosexual<br />
activity. I have to say that I myself am not in favour of lowering the age of consent<br />
from any of the existing levels. If there's a bit of disuniformity well, so be it. I'm not<br />
in favour of lowering the age of consent. I haven't heard it suggested that incest be<br />
decriminalised. That's a new you're the first person that's ever mentioned... I'm not<br />
saying I mean, I recognise that you're strongly against it and I respect your view on<br />
that fully and I might say I agree with it very strongly. But I'm not aware of that. I'll<br />
check it out.<br />
REYNOLDS: All right. Jim, unemployment. Very quickly.<br />
CALLER: Mr Howard I'm in a position of work where I come across a great cross section of the<br />
community from CEOs, as you call them, to cleaners. And the overriding message that<br />
I'm getting is that everyone, almost ( inaudible) are worried about their job, their<br />
current position. First question is, do you think that's a reasonable response from<br />
them considering what's happening with, you know, companies shedding workers and,<br />
you know, thousands going from here and thousands going from there? That's the </p>
<p>first question. The other question is, do you really think that changing the status of the<br />
unfair dismissal laws and also the situation with collective bargaining and things, do<br />
you really think that's having an improvement in our society because the word that I<br />
get is unbelievably in the other direction?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if I can take those in reverse. I do believe that the Workplace Relations Act,<br />
which is the, you call, collective bargaining it's not quite that, but anyway that's wh * at<br />
you have in mind and the unfair dismissal changes are good changes. The old unfair<br />
dismissal law that we're trying to get rid of completely and in order to rid it, rid<br />
Queensland of it in full, we need the help of the Queensland government. And I hope<br />
that they will come into line with what we've proposed federally. I've spoken to the<br />
Minister about it. I hope he will. But the problem with the old law was that it actually<br />
frightened a lot of small firms out of taking on new staff. They felt that if they had got<br />
somebody who was no good they couldn't get rid of them. And, I mean, you've got to<br />
be realistic about this. If you're running a small business and you've got one disruptive<br />
employee that person can wreck the operation of your business and if you can't get rid<br />
of them then the whole thing can grind to a halt. And I have seen this happen. I mean,<br />
it's all very well to talk about the brutal boss but you've also got to recognise that<br />
there can be a maverick, disruptive employee. And people in that situation running a<br />
small business, you can't afford to settle out of court an unfair dismissal claim because<br />
it might the whole of your year's profits. So I think that is a good change. I<br />
understand that some people feel a degree of uncertainty and I understand that. And I<br />
think the causes of it will diminish over time because the general economic outlook is<br />
very good. We are growing quite strongly. Business investment is good. Inflation is<br />
low. Interest rates have come down. The trade account is a little better. So when you<br />
add all of those things together some of that uncertainty and insecurity will disappear.<br />
But I do understand it and I'm not dismissive of some of the concerns that you've<br />
expressed. REYNOLDS: Jim thank you for your call. Mr Howard thank you very much for coming in. Good<br />
luck with the launch of the Green Corp. And will you come back next time you're in<br />
town? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'd be delighted to.<br />
REYNOLDS: Thank you very much, Prime Minister John Howard. </p>
