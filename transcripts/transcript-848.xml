FOR PRESS P. M. No. 88/ 1063<br />
JUBILEE OF ANZAC<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister,-the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menizies<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided to mark<br />
the Jubilee of the landing at Gallipoli on April 25th, 1915,<br />
by the inauguration of a ceremonial way leading from a point<br />
near the shores of Lake Burley Griffin up to the Australian<br />
War Memorial in Canberra.<br />
" I believe all Australians and certainly the<br />
ex-service organizations in each State will wish to emphasise<br />
this outstanding event in our history," said Sir Robert,<br />
" but I am sure the Australian people would wish the Commonwealth<br />
Government to make a special gesture worthy of the<br />
occasion. The Returned Servicemen's League had suggested<br />
that Anzac Parade should be developed for this purpose, and<br />
the Government had come to the conclusion that this was a<br />
highly suitable idea."<br />
The Prime Minister said that in the long-term<br />
planning of Canberra~ an opportunity had been provided for<br />
the development at the right time of a coremonialvay of<br />
high quality. The Government believes it is now appropriate<br />
to go forward with the construction of this feature, which<br />
will provide the setting for important processions, remembrance<br />
marches and other ceremonies which from time to time will be<br />
associated with facets of Australian history, and particularly<br />
our military history.<br />
Planning for the ceremonial way will call for<br />
the substantial re-development of the existing landscape, With<br />
provision for Australian trees of selected species, with some<br />
representative flora from New Zealand, The ceremonial way<br />
will be paved and can be ornarmented subsequently by statuary<br />
and other sculptural works. Tie total landscape will form<br />
part of the design of the central axis arourdwhich the central<br />
areas of the nationa,. l capital have been planned, and will<br />
finally establish the character of these areas. The monumental<br />
way would stand and be developed over generations as a memorial<br />
of enduring quality. It is proposed that all development works establishing<br />
the character of this ceremonial way will have been completed<br />
by the 50th Anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli in April,<br />
1965. CANBERRA, 1st November, 1963. </p>
