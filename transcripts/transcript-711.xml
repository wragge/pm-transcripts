OPENING OF DOMINICAN SISTERS TRAINING COLLEGE<br />
AT WATSON, CANBERRA, A. C. T. ON SUNDAY,<br />
24+ TH MARCH, 1963.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman, Your Grace, My Lord Bishops, Mother Philomena,<br />
Your Excellencies and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
The other day I was opening something in Canberra<br />
and I forgot to open it. ( Lau ghter' The following day my wife<br />
went down to a country town in Victoria in which she was born;<br />
she took advantage of this by saying, " I won't follow the evil<br />
example of my husband. I declare this whatever it was) open,"<br />
and so till be prudent. I have great pleasure in declaring this<br />
Training College open. ( Applause)<br />
It is indeed a very happy event. There have been<br />
references in the world of late to various ecumenical movements.<br />
What could be more ecumenical than to have a Presbyterian Prime<br />
Minister opening this Teachers' Training College ( Laughter) and<br />
feeling very honoured to be allowed to do it.<br />
The Archbishop who began life by being a scholar, and<br />
has ended up by being a considerable builder, occasionally comes<br />
to sec me. He is always charming; we are on the best of terms<br />
and when he has left, I find myself almost invariably conducting<br />
a violent alterca!, ion with the Treasury ( Laughter) ( Applause).<br />
But it wouldn't be for me to say to him he being a great scholar<br />
and profoundly interested in the problems of education in Australiathat<br />
there are perhaps three aspects of this matter, two of which<br />
are very well known and are considerably well understood and the<br />
third of which is occasionally overlooked,<br />
First of all, if you are going to have a great<br />
expansion of educational facilities in the country you must have<br />
buildings. We are in a splendid one today. Buildings bricks<br />
and mortar, as they used to say. And then you must have equipmentnot<br />
easy to come by, increasingly more expensive particularly on<br />
the scientific side. And, of course, to have both of those you<br />
must have money. Qu~ ite a few people, when they have covere. those<br />
three items, think they have dealt with the problem and yet they<br />
are not the most difficult of the problems, though they are not<br />
easy. They are not easy because none of these things is in<br />
illimitable supply; but with a struggle with some sacrifice,<br />
with some enthusiasm1 with some joint eflort yes, money can be<br />
found, but the remaining constituent is not so easily found:<br />
trained and devoted and competent teachers. You may have all the<br />
money and all the bricks and mortar in the world and provide, as<br />
you think facilities for more and more thousands of people but<br />
all you will do will be to conduct education on a declining level<br />
of standards unless you meet this paramount requirement of people<br />
who are teachers and I use that word in the broadest sense.<br />
And what is a good teacher?<br />
A good teacher must have, of course, skill and<br />
skill will be acquired by study. " Jo have long since got past the<br />
time I hope, when a university professor or a university lecturer<br />
might be found using the notes he prepared twenty yoars before;<br />
and yet I'va known that in my own time. There is to be a constant<br />
study, a constant improvement of knowledge if skill is to be<br />
equal to the task. There must also be and this is sometimes 9 as ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
overlooked a groat capacity to expound, to impart, the<br />
teaching faculty sometimes denied to the greatest of scholars;<br />
the capacity for conveying to students, to pupils, what it is<br />
the teacher desires them to understand and to remember. But<br />
above all these things again, there must be a sense of vocation.<br />
Teaching is not just a job. Any teacher who said, " Well, this<br />
is a job and V1ll do it; I'll observe the rules and no more,"<br />
would be a poor teacher. The sense of vocation and this,<br />
Your Grace, is so admirably illustrated by so many I see here<br />
today this sense of vocation is, I believe, of supreme<br />
importance. I can hardly imagine any civil occupation, if<br />
I may use a vory rough division, so important as the work of<br />
teaching. This is a tremendous responsibility, a great<br />
challenge, a wonderful chance to make a powerful contribution<br />
to the fuure of the country; and when, as in the case of<br />
so many of you, the civil merges with the religious so that<br />
it gets the background of profound religious belief and you<br />
pursue the vocation of teaching, thon I believe we have<br />
something very remarkable which I, for one, hope will never<br />
disappear from Australia. ( Applause)<br />
Another thing I should perhaps say to you is<br />
this. This college is being opened in the national capital;<br />
the national capital of a nation in which the national feeling<br />
has yet to reach its complete flowering; of a nation in<br />
which even now too much we are inclined to be parochial, local<br />
in our views and in our attitudes. One of the proofs to the<br />
world of the fall national growth of Australia is being now<br />
built around us a national capital which is, in physical<br />
terms, going ahead by leaps and bounds. I never cease to be<br />
astonished, day by day, at the signs of growth all around<br />
me, But not a national capital destined, as so many are,<br />
to be a centre of commerce, a centre of activities of the<br />
ordinary mercantile sort, although they will come more and<br />
more, but a capital increasingly designed to be a centre of<br />
education, a centre of theaffairs of the spirit, a place in<br />
which great authorities in the various churches will be found,<br />
in which a great university will become greater and greater,<br />
a capital in which, as time goes on schools will grow in<br />
a setting of beauty and although ther e is not much at the<br />
moment in the vicinity of the Lnke, it is going to be an<br />
enormous centre of beauty by the time we are a few years older.<br />
In a setting of beauty, this capital will develop<br />
as something quite unlike any other city of its kind in<br />
Australia and will therefore draw men's minds and eyes to it;<br />
it will increasingly remind the people of Australia that they<br />
are a nation first and foremost and that this capital, the<br />
centre of government, a centre of religion, a centre of<br />
education, a centre of all kinds of things that cater for<br />
the higher reaches of the human mind, is to be looked at and<br />
admired and regarded as setting an example to the whole of the<br />
people of Australia, Now, it is because I believe that that<br />
it has been my pleasure to lend considerable support to the<br />
National Capital Development Commission under the brilliant<br />
leadership of Mr. Overall ( Applause). It is for that reason<br />
that my colleagues and I have for years past, realised that<br />
a rapidly-growing capital proauces uncommon problems and that<br />
just as they have produced unconrion problems for the State<br />
so they have produced uncommon problems for the Church, as<br />
the Archbishop knows he has already indicated that he hasn't </p>
<p>3-<br />
finished with mc ( Laughter) and I have never believed for one<br />
moment that he had. But it is for that roason setting aside<br />
the unhappy controversies that occur here and 1here, that we,<br />
in this place, have a responsibility in such a rapidly-growing<br />
community to help the work of education in all its fields in<br />
this Territory ( Applause) and it has been a groat privilege<br />
to do it, Now I want to say no more~ thnn that, Sir. I have<br />
given you, in a very imperfect way, some of my reaso) ns for<br />
having a genuine pleasure in being here this afternoon. It<br />
is a really great occasion, a splendid occasion and whatever<br />
branchi of the Christian Church we may belong to, we must all<br />
thank God that the work of the Church goes on and that it will<br />
provide what to me is the essential and inevitable background<br />
of a civilised instructional and educational course. So I<br />
say I am glad lobe here. I have declared this College open<br />
with great satisfaction. I wish you all well. I thank you<br />
for all the work you have done in the past and in anticipation,<br />
I thank you for all the work you are going to do in the<br />
future. </p>
