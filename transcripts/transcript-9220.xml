TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE COMMUNITY OF SUNRAYSIA, MILDURA SHIRE<br />
COUNCIL CHAMBERS, FRIDAY, 6 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Shire President, Councillors Elizabeth Maffei and distinguished members of<br />
the Shire Council, could I also acknowledge the Mayor and distinguished<br />
members of the City Council, distinguished Parliamentary colleagues and<br />
guests, ladies and gentlemen, one and all. It is a great pleasure to be here<br />
and Mr Fitzpatrick, before I go on, as President of the Murray-Darling<br />
Commission. It is a very great pleasure for me to be in his company here<br />
today too.<br />
I have had a most enjoyable morning and one knows about areas like the<br />
Sunraysia, you learn about them at school, I did where I went to school and<br />
the great irrigation areas of Australia because they are and were so much<br />
part of the ethos of rural Australia, particularly in the post-war years and in<br />
the case of Mildura, Mildura was even moving as an irrigation area before the<br />
nation federated.<br />
There is a great sense of tradition as Mr Fitzpatrick said, of heritage about<br />
much of the area of the Murray-Darling catchment and for these particular<br />
irrigation areas. I think that one of the things that we are finding with the<br />
changed Australia, the new Australia, the open externally orientated Australia<br />
is that the things which we did in the past for our domestic consumption<br />
where we set up farm models and scales on European models for domestic<br />
demand, these things are changing and the regions of Australia have an<br />
opportunity now to participate in the new Austraifii economy, the more<br />
competitive, faster growing externally oriented one which opens up the<br />
prospects for a greater involvement by the people of regions and a greater<br />
sharing in the prosperity of the nation than that which they formerly would<br />
have been able to enjoy. </p>
<p>Part of the ' Working Nation' statement of a day ago was about giving regions<br />
a greater role in Australia, in the nation, in the governments of Australia and<br />
we've, in the reports which we did commission, principally that by Bill Kelty<br />
and his task force, the very extensive McKinsey research study and the<br />
Industry Commission Report all reveal one thing and that is that regions that<br />
know what they are doing, that have a sense of strategy about them, that<br />
have a sense of cohesion between municipal government, between<br />
employers, employees, trade unions, and other community bodies; generally<br />
have a higher economic performance than those areas that don't have that<br />
sort of coalescence of view or sense of leadership.<br />
We thought one of the sensible things to do is to give regions a chance to be<br />
able to resource some of the things that they might do in mapping their own<br />
strategies. Give them a chance to see what they can do for themselves<br />
because whenever regions are given a chance to do something for<br />
themselves they always do better than something which drifts in from outside.<br />
That's not to say that outside, that is the footloose industries from time to time<br />
don't or wont' change an area, it happens, but by and large most of the<br />
change comes internally. We want to see that those things could work.<br />
So, in here we have got support for regional economic development<br />
organisations. We've got funding there to resource them, to see if they can<br />
refine th eir strategies and plans; we've got to change the tax treatment of<br />
some instruments such as infrastructure bonds, which could be important in<br />
some vital, if you look at an irrigation area a vital piece of public community<br />
infrastructure, which can be provided privately if the tax system is set up<br />
properly; in pool development funds where one, for instance, might see the<br />
joint ownership of particular resources or even farms or production facilities<br />
and where those people, groups, companies or bodies need more capital<br />
through pool development funds they might have a chance now of raising it<br />
with a much more advantageous tax treatment.<br />
There are a couple of important instruments, we think, there. Like all of these<br />
things one has to refine them. We've had a couple of goes at infrastructure<br />
bonds, but now we have got a 33 per cent tax rebate in there which will affect<br />
beneficially, say, super funds which are very low taxed and therefore a tax<br />
deduction doesn't mean anything to them, but a re-batie does. So, some of<br />
these things are a case of seeing what the market will'do with them, but<br />
anyway the chances are'there and we're listening to see what the reactions<br />
will be. We do think they will help in regions.<br />
The other thing is we've got a capital works program there for particular<br />
public works, community works which can be of special value to regions and<br />
it is from that pool that we will be funding some of these salinity control works<br />
which I have the pleasure of being involved with later on this afternoon, but<br />
more particularly, that being part of the general salinity control problem. In<br />
this case, in the Murray-Darling catchment system.<br />
There are two approaches there is the generic approach to regions and<br />
there is a specific approach to particular works. Where we think a region has </p>
<p>in a mature way or matured their plans so that some Commonwealth and in<br />
this case, State funding can go together to do something sensible because<br />
you know it is going to be money well spent.<br />
One of the most impressive things we have seen in the last six or seven<br />
years is the collaborative work between the Commonwealth and the States in<br />
the Murray-Darling area and let me pay a tribute to the people in the<br />
Commission who have worked these plans up and produced a sense of cooperation<br />
and collaboration so that we are now making substantial strides in<br />
dealing with salinity problems and looking at the future of the Murray-Darling<br />
in the long term Australia's greatest river system and it's one which we must<br />
nurture. We have a much greater appreciation of the environment. We would now<br />
shake our heads in horror at the clear felling of trees which has gone on this<br />
country really since European settlement and which has had now such a<br />
deleterious impact upon the landscape and upon, particularly, things like<br />
erosion and salinity et cetera. And approaching it in a co-operative,<br />
collaborative way is the only way because this system covers the various<br />
states Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and you<br />
need therefore a council, you need to think in national terms and you need to<br />
work with communities co-operatively and bring them along and let them see<br />
the point and purpose of it all.<br />
This is, in fact, what has happened and a lot of progress has been made;<br />
much is yet to be done, but one thing is very clear: once people get to know<br />
about things they make the changes very quickly and at Mr Well's farm this<br />
morning I was just interested to learn some of the finer points about drip<br />
irrigation versus the sprays and that versus the gravitational irrigation and the<br />
quality it brings to the grapes and the diminished demands for water and the<br />
improved therefore salinity problem. All these things, no one group or<br />
individual can change these problems, it has to be a community thing. This is<br />
why, I think, with the Commonwealth involved with the States in the larger<br />
scheme of things like rural adjustment, the case of Victoria Farm-smart, all of<br />
these programs, Landcare, all these things help to make Australia better and<br />
more productive.<br />
With all these export markets opening up to us with tremendous demands for<br />
horticultural products in this part of Australia and the tremendous demand in<br />
Europe and in Asia for the products of this country particularly in agriculture<br />
which we produce we have, I think, a great opportunity. So, sustainable<br />
development is a very important phrase for our country from here on in. I was<br />
very impressed with the advocacy of this in the Sunraysia by Mr Hewitt<br />
amongst others, over a long period of time and we've picked those themes up<br />
in the various task force reports and I'm very impressed indeed, with the<br />
general sense of community and notion of common problems that I'm seeing.<br />
Thank you very much for doing me the honour of meeting me here today. I<br />
thank the Shire President for hosting this lunch and for the opportunity to look<br />
around the region and see what is capable of being done. I hope that with </p>
<p>the ' Working Nation' statement the more generic things on regional<br />
development and the specific thing here in the Sunraysia on this scheme of<br />
works for salinity control, we can just move the agenda of that commercial,<br />
community and environmental agenda just on that much further so that<br />
Australia is going to be a stronger and better place and the regions of<br />
Australia will have a greater role.<br />
Let me conclude on this point. Unemployment is a big problem here, it is in<br />
many regional areas. It will be a test of a country's capacity to do things<br />
innovatively and maturely to see how they can work. We will be intensively<br />
case managing every young person under 18 years of age who is<br />
unemployed from here on. That is, anyone who has left school, is<br />
unemployed, they will have someone who is personally dealing with them and<br />
managing them, understanding them, their aspirations, their educational<br />
attainments, their aptitudes and trying to find things to do. Where work is<br />
limited in regional areas we have got a thing called the New Opportunities<br />
Programs where we are seeking community type works which we may be<br />
able to fund through the labour market programs and it will be, I think, a<br />
challenge for local government and other community bodies to come up with<br />
some of those things. Beyond that, in the greater scheme of things, the<br />
notion is going to be on education and training regarding the years 15 to 19<br />
as a period of vocational preparation. We don't want kids dropping out of<br />
school only then to be picked up and then brought back in someway into<br />
TAFE and other things, but to keep them there and then, of course,<br />
intensively case managing those people who have been unemployed for<br />
twelve months or more.<br />
There is a great challenge there in that agenda, but at least a day ago we<br />
started moving on it decisively and, I think, we are doing things which<br />
Australia may again be doing some novel things that other comparable<br />
economies and societies are not doing in respect of employment.<br />
Let me conclude again by thanking you for coming for the very warm<br />
welcome and I look forward to meeting you all. Thank you.<br />
