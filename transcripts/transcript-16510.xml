    <content><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, more than 1,000 Australians gathered in Canberra to be part of the Australia 2020 Summit  -  an important event in the Rudd Government's first year in office.</p>
<p>The Summit participants came from across the Australian community to help shape a vision for the nation's future and to explore new ideas and ways to meet the major challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p>Many others joined in the conversation through local Summits across Australia, a Youth Summit, more than 500 School Summits, and we also received 8,800 submissions.</p>
<p>The Summit generated 962 ideas during an extraordinarily lively, engaged and incisive conversation.</p>
<p>The Government has already acted on many of these ideas, including:</p>
<p>     * Commencing a major review of Australia's Future Tax System;</p>
<p>     * Implementing a broad program of reform of Commonwealth cooperation with the States and Territories;</p>
<p>     * Releasing our Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme; and</p>
<p>     * Releasing a major new White Paper on Homelessness.</p>
<p>Tonight, the Government is releasing its response to all 962 ideas.</p>
<p>Not only did the Summit support, influence or cause the Government to re-evaluate a range of existing priorities and commitments, it also proposed a number of practical new ideas.</p>
<p>Tonight, the Australian Government can announce that it will immediately begin work on nine specific ideas from the Summit:</p>
<p>     * A Deployable Civilian Capacity to respond to emergencies in our region;</p>
<p>     * First steps towards an Indigenous Cultural Education and Knowledge Centre;</p>
<p>     * Mentoring in the Workplace to facilitate the passing of knowledge between skilled mature age Australians and business and the community (Golden Gurus);</p>
<p>     * $50 million for research towards the development of a bionic eye;</p>
<p>     * A Prime Minister's Australia Asia Endeavour Awards Scheme to support scholarships for students in Australia and Asia and deepen cultural understanding;</p>
<p>     * A dedicated ABC Children's Channel;</p>
<p>     * A Business and School Connections Roundtable to enhance opportunities for business and schools to partner together to improve educational outcomes;</p>
<p>     * A Skills for the Carbon Challenge initiative to equip workers and businesses with skills for sustainability; and</p>
<p>     * A Vocational Education Broadband Network to build a single post-secondary high speed broadband network, connecting the Australian training system to a similar network to that currently serving universities.</p>
<p>These initiatives reflect the range, strength and quality of ideas emerging from the Summit.</p>
<p>Other ideas will be studied in ongoing policy processes, while some ideas are better taken forward by other groups.</p>
<p>The 2020 process was just the beginning.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to an open style of government that engages the community and welcomes new ideas as we work together to address the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>The Government is undertaking Community Cabinets across Australia and is developing a wide range of community engagement strategies to ensure it remains in contact with the community and continues to be open to new ideas and different points of view.</p>
<p>The Australia 2020 Summit - Government Response is available on the Australia 2020 website.</p>
