ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The decision to proceed with the development of the Rundle<br />
shale oil deposit is welcome news for all Australians.<br />
Esso's participation with Southern Pacific Petroleum and<br />
Central Pacific Minerals to develop Rundle ' s massive<br />
reserves of shale oil signals the start of what may well<br />
become one of Australia's greatest industries. It also<br />
further enhances the energy-riches of this country and<br />
highlights our unlimited potential as we proceed into<br />
the 1980s and beyond.<br />
Of particular interest is the role played by the Commonwealth's<br />
oil pricing policies in making the Rundle development<br />
possible. The Government's policy of import parity pricing for crude<br />
oil has three main objectives: to encourage oil exploration;<br />
to conserve our scarce liquid fuels; and to enhance the<br />
viability of alternative energy sources.<br />
We are already seeing the success of these policies. Spending<br />
on oil exploration and development has risen dramatically from<br />
the depressed levels of the mid 70s and further Bass Strait<br />
reserves have been proved. ' Increased efforts are evident in<br />
conserving our scarce liquid fuels and there is a concerted<br />
movement away from oil to alternative fuels such as natural<br />
gas and electricity.<br />
If we had not adopted a realistic pricing policy for crude oil<br />
and instead allowed oil to be sold at an artificially low price,,<br />
the plans for the development of the Rundle shale oil deposits<br />
could not have proceeded as they have. The policy of setting<br />
market prices for crude oil has provided the certainty necessary<br />
that this massive resource project would be viable.<br />
I have said before that the choice we face-is between paying<br />
realistic prices for oil now, or paying far higher prices for<br />
insecure imported crude in the future. The development of Rundle<br />
to its full potential will reduce significantly our dependence<br />
on imported crude. / 2<br />

Beyond energy policy the Government's general economic<br />
policies have also been important. Our policies here have<br />
created the climate in which once again investors, including<br />
those from overseas, can plan with confidence and are<br />
prepared to outlay the massive amounts of risk capital necessary<br />
for our vast resource projects.<br />
The potential magnitude of the Rundle project is difficult<br />
to comprehend. Even in the pilot stage investment of some<br />
hundreds of millions of dollars will be involved and many<br />
jobs will be created. If the pilot plant is successful the<br />
joint venturers plan to expand output to around 200,000 barrels<br />
of oil per day. This phase will require several billion dollars.<br />
Production from Rundle will be particularly important on two<br />
counts. Firstly, it will coincide with the presently anticipated<br />
run-down of Bass Strait output from the mid 1980s and thus enhance<br />
the security of Australia's supplies of liquid fuels. It has<br />
become clear that world oil markets will remain uncertain in the<br />
future and that imported fuels will become increasingly scarce.<br />
The Government has given a very high priority to the development<br />
of indigenous sources of liquid fuels and it is pleasing to note<br />
the success of these policies in this particular area.<br />
The second important aspect of Rundle is that it is likely to<br />
act as a catalyst for the exploitation of other deposits of shale<br />
oil in Australia. Potentially, the shale oil industry could be<br />
one of the largest and most important in Australia.<br />
Some concern has been expressed about the magnitude of the<br />
Rundle project and its possible effect on the environment.<br />
As I said on Thursday, the project will need to satisfy<br />
Commonwealth and Queensland Government requirements in a number<br />
of areas, one of which is environmental considerations.<br />
The companies have already done some work in this area and I<br />
anticipate that satisfactory arrangements will be able to be<br />
worked out that will protect the environment.<br />
In closing, I would like to return to my earlier theme about the<br />
fundamental importance of the Government's oil pricing policies.<br />
Unrealistically low prices for oil mean that as a nation we<br />
would squander the scarce reserves of oil and ignore the needs<br />
of future generations. Our pricing policies not only preserve<br />
existing supplies of liquid fuels for our children but are also,<br />
as evidenced by Rundle, bringing forward projects to increase<br />
these future supplies of liquid fuels. Only in this way can we<br />
guarantee the future strength of Australia and ensure that the<br />
very high standard of living currently enjoyed in Australia<br />
is shared by future generations. 000---</p>
