PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
COAPANY DIRECTORS' ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA<br />
( QUEENSLAND DIVISION)<br />
BRISBANE 25 AUGUST 1966<br />
ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO TO THE DAY I ADDRESSED ANOTHER<br />
DISTINGUISHED BUSINESS A. UDIENCE HERE IN BRISBANE. ON THAT<br />
OCCASION 1 CONCLUDED WHAT WAS A PRE-BUDGET SPEECH BY<br />
REVEALING THE STRATEGIC THINK( ING BEHIND OUR FIRST BUDGET.<br />
AS I EXPLAINED IT THEN: " WE HAVE NOT REGARDED OUR TASK AS<br />
BEING MERLLY TO DRAW UP AN ANNUAL BUDGET AND THEN TO PRESENT<br />
THAT BUDGET AS THE BE-ALL AND END-ALL OF ECONOMIC POLICY."<br />
" WHAT WIE HAVE DONE AND IT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN AUSTRALIA<br />
IS TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED BASIS FOR<br />
CONSISTENT, LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PLANNING."<br />
TODAY, I WOULD LIKE TO REVEAL SOME OF THE STRATEGIC THINKING<br />
BEHIND THIS, OUR FOURTH BUDGET, AND THE CRITICAL ROLE THE<br />
EARLY COMMITM4ENT OF MY GOVERNI4ENT TO LONG-TERM ECONOMIC<br />
RESTRUCTURING HAS PLAYED IN EQUIPPING US TO TACKLE THE<br />
CHALLENGE OF OUR CURRENT EXTERNALLY IMPOSED NATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES.<br />
LET ME PUT IT DIRECTLY AND PRECISELY AUSTRALIA IS NOW<br />
BETTER ABLE TO DEAL WITH OUR PRESENT STRAITENED TRADING<br />
CONDITIONS BECAUSE WE WERE SO EARLY COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING<br />
AND IMPLEMENTING ECONOMIC REFORMS TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY<br />
BETTER EQUIPPED TO COMPETE ON WORLD MARKETS. IF IT HAD NOT<br />
BEEN FOR THIS FORETHOUGHT AUSTRALIA WOULD NOW BE FACING A<br />
VERY REAL PROSPECT OF A PROLONGED AND DEEP ECONOMIC<br />
RECESSION. INSTEAD, WE ARE IN A POSITION TO FACE UP TO<br />
THESE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES WITH CONFIDENCE.<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TRADING NATION WHOSE FORTUNES<br />
HAVE BEEN LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE HEALTH OF THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY.<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RICH RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS IN LAND,<br />
MINERALS AND ENERGY HAS BEEN THE BASIS FOR OUR EXPORTS AND A<br />
DRIVING FORCE IN THE GROWTH OF OUR ECONOMY AND OF THE<br />
NATION. </p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY OUR RESOURCE-BASED EXPORTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN<br />
PRONE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND, MTORE<br />
IMPORTANTLY, SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE LONG TERM DECLINE IN THE<br />
VALUE OF COM4MODITIES RELATIVE TO PROCESSED GOODS AND<br />
SERVICES.<br />
THIS DECLINE IN OUR TERMS OF TRADE HAS ACCELERATED<br />
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MIONTHS. ESPECIALLY IN<br />
RECENT MIONTHS WE HAVE BEEN HIT BY THE CORRUPT TRADING<br />
PRACTICES OF THE EEC AND THE US.<br />
THE COST TO AUSTRALIA OF THESE CHANGES IN WORLD PRICES IS<br />
CURRENTLY RUNNING AT ABOUT $ 6 BILLION PER ANNUM.<br />
WE HAVE NC CHOICE BUT TO ADAPT TO THIS DECLINE.<br />
BUT WE DO HAVE A CHOICE ABOUT HOW WE ADAPT.<br />
WE COULD PRETEND THAT NOTHING HAD CHANGED AND ATTEMPT TO<br />
MAINTAIN LIVING STANDARDS.<br />
THE RESULT OF TAKING THAT COURSE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MlASSIVE<br />
BOUT OF INFLATION AND CURRENCY INSTAB'LITY WHICH WOULD BE<br />
BROUGHT TO AN END BY AN EQUALLY MASSIVE ECONOMIC RECESSION<br />
AND AN ASSOCIATED REDUCTION IN LIVING STANDARDS.<br />
OR WE CAN LIAXE THE HOST OF THE CURRENT SITUATION:<br />
BY TARING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES BEING OFFERED<br />
TO AUSY. i.' ALIAN PRODUCERS BY THE ENHANCED COMPETITIVENESS<br />
RESULTTNG FROM THE FALL IN THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR;<br />
BY BEGINNING TO REDUCE THE DEPENDENCE OF THE ECONOMY ON<br />
OUR TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF EXPORT INCOME; AND<br />
BY CREATING THE CONDITIONS TO UNDERWRITE SUSTAINED<br />
GROWTH WELL INTO THE FUTURE.<br />
WHILE I HAVE PAINTED THE ALTERNATIVES RATHER STARKLY THEY<br />
NEVERTHELESS REPRESENT THE CHOICE CURRENTLY FACING<br />
AUSTRALIA. I BELIEVE TRAT, GIVEN PROPER LEADERSHIP, AUSTRALIANS WILL<br />
OPT FOR THZ COURSE THAT TURNS CURRENT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS INTO<br />
SOLUTIONS AND BUILDS ON THE LONG-TERM ECONOMIC REFORM TO<br />
WHICH I HAVC REFERRED.<br />
THE GOVERN; IENT HAS SET ITS ECONOMIC STRATEGY ACCORDINGLY.<br />
LET ME OUTLINE THE KEY ASPECTS OF OUR INTEGRATED APPROACH TO<br />
ECONOMIC MIANAGEMENT.<br />
IN ESSENCE, IS AN APPROACH WHICH COMBINES RESPONSIBLE<br />
FISCAL POLICY WITH REALISTIC WAGES, MONETARY AND INDUSTRY<br />
POLICY. THE BUDGET THAT THE TREASURER INTRODUCED LAST WEEK WILL<br />
FACILITATE THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE ECONOMY TO THESE NEW,<br />
TOUGHER TRADING CONDITIONS. </p>
<p>IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RESTRAINT IN SPENDING HAS BEEN<br />
ESSENT" AL TO ALIGN OUR LIVING STANDARDS MORE CLOSELY WITH<br />
OUR CAPACITY TO PRODUCE. THE PUBLIC SECTOR CANNOT BE EXE1MPT<br />
FROM THIS RESTRAINT. ACCORDINGLY, THIS BUDGET INCORPORATES<br />
CUTS ACROSS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF PROGRAMS.<br />
WE HAVE CUT EXPENDITURE BY NEARLY $ 3 BILLION AND HAVE COME<br />
IN WITH A DEFICIT OF $ 3.5 BILLION. COMPARE THAT WITH THE<br />
$ 9.6 BILLION HANDED OVER TO US BY MR HOWARD.<br />
OUTLAYS GROWTH IN REAL TERMS WILL BE ZERO. THIS HAS BEEN<br />
ACHIEVED ONLY TWICE BEFORE IN 30 YEARS.<br />
THE LOW BUDGET DEFICIT MEANS THAT THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
GOVERNMENT'S CALL ON SAVINGS HAS BEEN REDUCED, THEREBY<br />
REDUCING PRESSURES ON FINANCIAL MARKETS.<br />
THE GROSS PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING REQUIREMENT AS A SHARE OF<br />
GDP IS EXPECTED TO FALL FROM 6.0 PER CENT TO 4.4 PER CENT,<br />
COMPARED WITH A PEAK OF 8.1 PER CENT IN 1983-84.<br />
THIS FALL IN PUBLIC BORROWING WILL PROVIDE SCOPE FOR<br />
INTEREST RATES TO DECLINE. OF COURSE THE TIMING OF THOSE<br />
FALLS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD<br />
FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ON CONFIDENCE. THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT<br />
CONTROL THESE FORCES. HOWEVER IT CAN AND HAS PUT IN<br />
PLACE POLICIES WHICH MAXIMIZE OUR CHANCES FOR SUCCESS.<br />
SOME CRITICISM OF THE BUDGET HAS BEEN MADE BECAUSE OF THE<br />
RESTRAINT IMPOSED ON PARTICULAR ITEMS OF EXPENDITURE,<br />
ESPECIALLY IN. THE HEALTH AND WELFARE AREAS.<br />
THE ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LET<br />
ARBITRARY ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS FORCED ON US BY A RECESSION<br />
DICTAT2E WHERE THE REDUCTION IN LIVING STANDARDS WOULD BE<br />
CONCENTRATED. INEVITABLY, THE HURT WOULD HAVE FALLEN MOST HEAVILY ON THE<br />
DISADVANTAGED, PARTICULARLY THE UNEMPLOYED.<br />
INSTEAD THIS BUDGET SPREADS THAT ADJUSTMENT FAIRLY ACROSS<br />
THE COMMUNITY.<br />
WHILE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS WERE MADE IN THE AREAS OF<br />
EDUCATION, HEALTH, SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE AND HOUSING<br />
AND COMMUNITY AMENITIES THESE PROGRAMS WILL ACTUALLY<br />
INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF TOTAL OUTLAYS FROM 46.4 PER CENT TO<br />
46.7 PER CENT.<br />
THE BUDGET ALSO EMBODIES SEVERE RESTRAINT ON PAYMENTS TO THE<br />
STATES. THESE WILL DECLINE BY 1.6 PER CENT IN REAL TERMS.<br />
IT IS MYi HOPE THAT, IN FRAMING THEIR BUDGETS, THE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING YOUR OWN, WILL EXERCISE THE SAME<br />
DEGREE OF RESTRAINT ON SPENDING AND RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO<br />
FINANCE HIGHER SPENDING THROUGH SHARPLY HIGHER TAXES AND<br />
CHARGES. </p>
<p>TAX REFORM REMAINS CENTRAL. TO THIS GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA.<br />
PERSONAL TAX CUTS WILL BE DELIVERED ON 1 DECEMBER, WITH A<br />
FINAL TRANCHE ON 1 JULY 1987. OUR COMMITMENT TO THIS SECOND<br />
TRAHiCHE IS TO BE REFLECTED IN LEGISLATION, TO BE INTRODUCED<br />
FOR PASSAGE THIS SESSION.<br />
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TAX<br />
PACKAGE BE APPRECIATED. IT CERTAINLY IS A MAJOR STEP<br />
TOWARDS AN EQUITABLE TAX SYSTEM. BUT, EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY,<br />
IT ALSO INCORPORATES SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THE CRIPPLING<br />
MARGIN~ AL TAX RATES WHICH MR HOWARD BEQUEATHED US.<br />
WE WILL BY JULY OF NEXT YEAR HAVE BROUGHT THE 60 CENT RATE<br />
DOWN TO 49 CENTS AND THE 46 CENT RATE DOWN TO 40. THE COST<br />
OF THESE CONCESSIONS IS $ 1.4 BILLION THIS YEAR AND<br />
BILLION IN 1987-88 BENEFITS WHICH DWARF OTHER REVENUE<br />
MEASURES. EVEN AFTER ALLOWING FOR THE HIGHER MEDICARE LEVY,<br />
ORDINARY WAGE EARNERS WILL RECEIVE A TAX CUT FROM 1 DECEMBER<br />
OF ABOUT $ 6 PER WEEK.<br />
LOOKING A LITTLE FURTHER AHEAD, THE PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE AN<br />
IMPUTATION SYSTEM WHICH WILL ELIM4INATE THE SO-CALLED DOUBLE<br />
TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS SHOULD ENCOURAGE A STRONGER, HEALTHIER<br />
INTEREST IN THE EQUITIES MARKET ENABLING THE MORE<br />
ENTLRPRISING COMPANIES TO RAISE GREATER QUANTITIES OF RISK<br />
CAPITAL. TAKEN AS A WHOLE, THESE MEASURES PROVIDE REAL INCENTIVE,<br />
INCENTIVE TO INVEST, TO WORK HARDER AND TO TAKE UP THE<br />
CHALLENGE OF MEETING THE COMPETITION AT HOME AND ABROAD.<br />
THE BUDGET ALSO SETS OUT OUR APPROACH TO THE GROWTH IN WAGES<br />
OVER THE COMiING YEAR.<br />
ON OCCASIONS I HEAR CRITICISM OF OUR WAGES POLICY.<br />
OCCI. SIONALLY SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE THAT AUSTRALIA SHOULD<br />
ADOPT THE PRACTICES OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED<br />
KINGDOM TO GET EVEN MORE MODERATE WAGES OUTCOMES.<br />
THE RESULTS, UNDER CUR POLICY, COMPARE MORE THAN FAVOURABLY<br />
WITH THESE COUNTRIES. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AUSTRALIA<br />
HAS EXPERIENCED A REAL WAGE DECLINE OF 5 PER CENT. BY<br />
CONTRAST OVER THE SAME PERIOD, THE US HAD A FALL OF JUST ONE<br />
PER CENT AND THE UK A RISE OF 10 PER CENT.<br />
WE HAVE SAID THAT A RESPONSE TO CURRENT ECONOMI4C CONDITIONS<br />
REQUIRES FURTHER RESTRAINT IN WAGE GROWTH TO ENSURE THAT THE<br />
GAINS IN COMPETITIVENESS CAUSED BY THE DEPRECIATION ARE NOT<br />
DISSIPATED IN WAGE AND PRICE INFLATION.<br />
A FURTHER 2 PER CEN4T DISCOUNT AT THE NEXT NATIONAL WAGE CASE<br />
WILL SEE WAGES GROWTH IN 1986-87 OF A LITTLE OVER 6 PER CENT<br />
ABOUT THE SAME AS IN 1985-86 AND ONLY A LITTLE HIGHER THAN<br />
OUR TRADING PARTNERS.<br />
SO, EVEN THOUGH OUR DOMESTIC PRICES MAY RISE IN 1986-87 AT A<br />
FASTER RATE THAN THOSE OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS, THIS WILL<br />
LARGELY REFLECT HIGHER IMPORT PRICES FACING CONSUMERS. OUR<br />
RELATIVE COST STRUCTURE WILL CHANGE ONLY SLIGHTLY. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, OUR COMPETITIVENESS WILL BE VERY MUCH BETTER THAN<br />
THE AVERAGE IN 1985-86. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE FALL IN THE<br />
EXCHANGE RATE WHICH HAS ALREADY OCCURRED.<br />
BEYOND 1986-87 WE HAVE ALSO SAID THAT, IF REQUIRED BY<br />
ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
CONSIDER FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO WAGES AT THE FOLLOWING WAGE<br />
CASE.<br />
OUR DETERMINATION IS TO PRESERVE THE COMPETITIVE BENEFITS<br />
PROVIDED BY THE DEPRECIATION.<br />
OUR RECORD TO DATE IN THIS AREA IS THE PROOF OF THIS<br />
DETERMINATION. LET M4E REmIND YOU THAT IN THE PAST THREE YEARS REAL UNIT<br />
LABOUR COSTS HAVE FALLEN BY OVER 7 PER CENT. THE STEPS WE<br />
PROPOSE WILL RESULT IN A FURTHER FALL OF 1 PER CENT IN<br />
1986--87, PRODUCING A TOTAL OF OVER 8 PER CENT IN 4 YEARS.<br />
THIS IS A RESULT WHICH FEW INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES CAN BOAST IN<br />
THEIR FNTIRE ECONOMIC HISTORY. THIS GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING<br />
TO SEE THAT GAIN ERODED.<br />
I WOULD LIKE NOW TO PLACE THESE RECENT POLICIES IN THE<br />
BROADER CONTEXT OF OUR INDUSTRY POLICY, WHICH IS ANOTHER<br />
EXA14PLC OF OUR COMMITMENT TO LONG-TERM ECONOMIC POLICY.<br />
IN DOING SO I DO NOT WANT TO REFER SOLELY TO MANUFACTURING<br />
INDUSTRlY. THE SERVICES SECTOR WILL ALSO PLAY AN IMPORTANT<br />
PART IN THE FUTURE GROWTH OF OUR ECONOMY. TOURISM IS BUT<br />
ONE EXXIPLE, TO WHICH I SHALL RETURN SHORTLY.<br />
FACED WITH THE ADVERSE OUTLOOK FOR AGRICULTURAL AND MINERAL<br />
EXPORTS, WE MUST ASK WHAT ROLE IS THERE FOR OUR<br />
MANUFAC-TURING AND SERVICES SECTORS?<br />
ONE OF THE GREAT TRAGEDIES OF AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC HISTORY<br />
HAS BEEN THE DEMISE OF OUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR.<br />
MANUFACTURING WAS TEETERING ON THE BRINK BY THE LATE 1970S.<br />
THE PROTECTIONIST POLICIES OF A SUCCESSION OF SO-CALLED FREE<br />
ENTERPRISE COALITION GOVERNMENTS SAW TO THAT.<br />
MANUFACTURING WAS DEALT A HEAVY BLOW IN THE EARLY 19805,<br />
BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF OUR PREDECESSORS IN OVERSEEING<br />
A WAGES EXPLOSION, INDUSTRIAL WARFARE AND ECONOMIC<br />
RECESSION. EVER SINCE THEN, MY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN<br />
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES TO REVIVE AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING.<br />
THESE POLICIES ARE BASED ON SOUND BUDGETARY, 1MONETARY AND<br />
WAGES POLICIES. BUT THEY EXTEND TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC<br />
RESTRUCTURING PLANS FOR THE STEEL, CAR AND HEAVY ENGINEERING<br />
INDUSTRIES, SUPPORT FOR R&amp; D AND A RANGE OF OTHER MEASURES.<br />
A GRAP'HIC ILLUSTRATION OF THE EFFECT OF THESE POLICIES IS<br />
THAT INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING IN 1985-86 GREW By 40 PER<br />
CENT Im 1985-86 A SUBSTANTIAL REAL INCREASE EVEN AFTER<br />
ALLOWING FOR THE CONSIDERABLE PRICE INCREASES FOR IMPORTED<br />
CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. </p>
<p>HOWEVER DEPRECIATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR HAS PROVIDED A<br />
MAJOR ADDITIONAL FILIP. SINCE EARLY 1985, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
DOLLAR HAS DEPRECIATED AROUND 25 PER CENT AGAINST THE US<br />
DOLLAR, 40 PER CENT AGAINST THE TRADE WEIGHTED INDEX AND A<br />
MASSIVE 50 PER CENT AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN.<br />
COUPLED W'ITH THE WAGE RESTRAINT I HAVE REFERRED TO, THIS HAS<br />
BESTOWED UPON AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY A LEVEL OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETLTIVENESS UNKNOWN FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS.<br />
AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY IS NOW ON4 THE THRESHOLD OF A NEW ERA.<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, SEVERAL COMPANIES HAVE BROKEN INTO THE<br />
DIFFICULT JAPANESE MARKET.<br />
OTHER CON4PANIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ENTERED WORLD MARKEtS FOR<br />
MEDICAL SUPPLIES, INCLUDING HIGH TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS.<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES ARE ALSO SUCCEEDING INTERNATIONALLY<br />
WITH INNOVATIVE AUTOMOBILE COMPONENTS AND NEW MANUFACTURING<br />
PROCESSES, SUCH AS RAPID DRY PAINTING.<br />
IN THE SERVICES SECTOR, NEW HOTEL ACCOM1MODATION AND<br />
ENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES ATTEST TO THE GROWTH IN TOURISM.<br />
QUEENSLA" ND, WITH ITS UNIQUE SCENERY AND RECREATION<br />
FACILI. TIES, AND THE HOSPITALITY OF ITS PEOPLE, IS<br />
PARTICULARLY WELL ENDOWED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH IN<br />
INTERN~ ATIONAL TOURISM! TO AUSTRALIA.<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON QUEENSLAND FOR A MAJOR<br />
SHARE OF EXPORT EARNINGS WHETHER THE EMPHASIS IS ON RAW<br />
MATERIALS, AS IS NOW THE CASE, OR ON INTERNATIONAL TOURISM<br />
AND LOCAL MANUFACTURES, AS WILL INCREASINGLY BE THE CASE fN<br />
THE FUTURE.<br />
OUR COMPLREHENSIVE WORK ON LONG-TERM RESTRUCTURING AND THE<br />
HARMONISATION OF INDUSTRY POLICY WITH OUR SHORT-TERM<br />
ECONOMIC POLICIES IS PAYING DIVIDENDS. I ASK YOU TO COMPARE<br />
THIS WITH THE PATHETIC ATTEMPTS OF THE OPPOSITION TO DEVELOP<br />
A CREDIBLE ECONOMIC STRATEGY.<br />
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION HAD THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HIS ALTER1NATIVE VISION. IT WAS A<br />
TRULY REMARKABLE DOCUMENT, A COLLECTOR'S ITEM IN TERMS OF<br />
ECONOIU-1C UNREALITY AND NAIVETY.<br />
FOR ALL OF THE RHETORIC AND CHEST BEATING ABOUT CUTTING<br />
GOVERNMENT SPENDING, THE DOCUMENT WAS DISTINGUISHED BY THE<br />
VIRTUAL ABSENCE OF SPECIFICS AND COSTINGS. INSTEAD WE WERE<br />
GIVEN ONLY A GRAB BAG OF VAGUE PROMISES. THE CHALLENGE TO<br />
COME UIP WITH DETAILS WAS BEYOND MR HOWARD. HIS HYPOCRISY IS<br />
EXPOSED IN FAILING TO MEET THE TESTS HE W1OULD IMPOSE ON<br />
OTHERS, AND I REFER HERE TO HIS CELEBRATED INJUNCTION TO HIS<br />
THEN LEADER IN 1984 TO FACE UP TO THlE COSTINGS ISSUE.<br />
AS MR HOWARD'S MEMORANDUMl TO HIS THEN LEADER SAID: " SUCH AN<br />
APPROACH IS NOT ONLY CREDIBLE. IT IS ALSO ECONOMICALLY<br />
HONEST". HE HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO MEET HIS OWN STANDARDS OF<br />
ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY AND HONESTY. </p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
I RAVE ENDEAVOURED TO SHOW THAT WE HAVE APPLIED<br />
FUNDAMENTALLY CORRECT POLICIES FOR AUSTRALIA FROM THE START<br />
OF OUR TERM. THIS BUDGET, CERTAINLY OUR MOST DIFFICULT, IS<br />
PART OF A CONTINUING PROCESS OF ADDRESSING THE REAL<br />
CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE NATION.<br />
I HAVE DELIBERATELY DEALT ONLY BRIEFLY WITH THE ALTERNATIVE<br />
NOW OFFERED BY AN OPPOSITION WHOSE POLICIES AND PHILOSOPHY<br />
PREVAILED ALMOST WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FOR THREE POST-WAR<br />
DECADES.<br />
THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA WILL, OF COURSE, MAKE THEIR OWN<br />
JUDGEMENT. THEY WILL JUDGE THE RESPECTIVE RECORDS, COMPARE<br />
THE PERFORMANCE, CONTRAST THE ACHIEVEMENTS, AND DETERMINE<br />
WHOM THEY CAN TRUST.<br />
BUT LET M4E CONCLUDE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BY MAKING THIS<br />
POINT. THE GLIB CLAIM IS SOMETIMES MADE TO THE EFFECT THAT<br />
WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, EXPECT TO BE TAKEN ON TRUST. THE TRUTH<br />
IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE, WE EXPECT NOTHING BEYOND THE TRUST WE<br />
EARN BY OUR PERFORMLANCE.<br />
BEYOND POLICIES AND ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT, THERE IS THE MATTER<br />
OF OUR GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.<br />
I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY POST-WAR AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS HAD<br />
A FAIRER CLAIM TO PLAIN DEALING WITH THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMMUNITY. I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY GOVERNMENT HAS MADE GREATER<br />
EFFORTS TO TAKE THE COMMUNITY INTO ITS CONFIDENCE, AND TO<br />
EXPLAIN THE REALITIES. IT HAS BEEN A COURSE OF CONDUCT WE<br />
HAVE FOLLOWED CONSISTENTLY SINCE MARCH 1983. IN SHORT, WE<br />
HAVE NEVER SOUGHT JUST TO BE TAKEN ON TRUST. BUT,<br />
EMPHATICALLY, WE RAVE SOUGHT TO EARN THAT TRUST.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY-DEMONSTRATED BEYOND DOUBT ITS<br />
CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO SUCH AN APPROACH IN THE COMMON EFFORT<br />
TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AFTER MARCH 1983. IT WAS A<br />
MAGNIFICENT EFFORT AND A MAGNIFICENT ACHIEVEMENT.<br />
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE 1986-87 BUDGET PROVIDES THE BASIS<br />
FOR A SIN~ ILAR RESPONSE AND THE SAME KIND OF COMMON EFFORT,<br />
FROM A GOVERNM4ENT PROVIDING FIRM LEADERSHIP, AND A COMMUNITY<br />
FULLY AWARE OF THE GRAVITY OF THE PROBLEMS, BUT SHARING A<br />
COMMON DETERMINATION TO OVERCOME THEM. </p>
