I<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, HYATT HOTEL, CANBERRA<br />
4 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you pleased with the pilots' outcome?<br />
PM: Just let's understand what has happened. The pilots<br />
have reiterated in their press statement that they are not<br />
going to operate within the guidelines. They have issued a<br />
log of claims. They have no employees in the airlines now.<br />
The matter is before the Commission and it will be precisely<br />
for the Commission to determine whether in its judgement, in<br />
these circumstances where the Pilots' Federation is still<br />
saying that they will not be bound by the guidelines,<br />
whether there is any place for the Federation. So in that<br />
sense their statement has only confirmed what their position<br />
has been from the beginning, that is their repudiation of<br />
the guidelines. In those circumstances obviously what will<br />
continue to happen is that the airlines will continue to<br />
build up their capacity to gradually build up the proportion<br />
of normal operations. That will go on and full operations<br />
will be restored. As I say, it will be a matter for the<br />
Commission as to whether there is any place for the<br />
Federation in it. I would presume and I of course don't<br />
speak for, I can't and wouldn't presume to speak for the<br />
Commission but obviously the Commission is not going to<br />
see a place for the Federation if the Federation continues<br />
to say that it is not bound by the guidelines. Now those<br />
are the simple facts.<br />
ends </p>
