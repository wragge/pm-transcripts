PRNME MNITER<br />
FOR PRESS13 JAN4UARY 1982<br />
RESIGNATION OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
Her Majesty's announcement of the<br />
resignation of Sir Zelman Cowen as Governor-General<br />
of Australia marks the end of a very distinguished<br />
term of service by a most distinguished man in this<br />
high office. On behalf of the Government, I place on<br />
record our deep appreciation of Sir Zelman's service<br />
to his country and our deep respect for the outstanding<br />
way in which he has carried out his duties.<br />
Sir Zelman will be relinquishing his<br />
appointment after more than four and a half years in<br />
office. He steps down with the good wishes of all sectors<br />
of the community and our earnest hope that he and<br />
Lady Cowen will continue to enjoy health and happiness<br />
in years ahead. The Australian people extend every good wish<br />
to Sir Zelman and Lady Cowen in their retirement.<br />
Canberra </p>
