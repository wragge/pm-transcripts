PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP ON DEPARTURE FOR NOUMEA AND SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC FORUM, RAAF BASE FAIRBAIRN, 27 JULY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you concerned about the<br />
possibility of a special executive on the Telecom issue?<br />
PM: There's a meeting of the executive coming up some<br />
time in September anyway. I don't think there's any<br />
special one likely to emerge.<br />
JOURNALIST: Premier Cain says he would decision on<br />
telecommunications should be dropped until that September<br />
meeting, do you think there's a chance that would happen?<br />
PM: We'll make the decisions that we think are<br />
appropriate. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, does the latest balance of<br />
payments figure concern you? It was worse than expected.<br />
PM: It was at the upper end of the expectations of the<br />
market, but if you have a look at it, it's quite clear<br />
that the policies of the Government are working in that<br />
the lower level of demand is bringing a lower level of<br />
imports. If you look at the June quarter, seasonally<br />
adjusted and, I hate the phrase, endogenous imports,<br />
which are the ones that we are really talking about,<br />
those seasonally adjusted imports are down 10 percent on<br />
the March quarter. So the policy is working. If you<br />
look at the current account deficit, it's now, in this<br />
quarter, running at $ 18 and a half billion against the<br />
$ 22 and a half billion of the September quarter of last<br />
year. So the policies are clearly working.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think people can expect interest rate<br />
falls after the Budget?<br />
PM: I'm not making any comment about interest rates.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how important are<br />
environmental issues at this year's Forum?<br />
PM: They will have a considerable significance. I think<br />
the Forum will review with a great deal of pleasure the<br />
significant advance that's been made in the area of<br />
banning of driftnet fishing following the Tarawa </p>
<p>Declaration that we were involved in this time 12 months<br />
ago and I think we're all entitled to take a great deal<br />
of pleasure from that. There are other issues that will<br />
be on the agenda which have environmental implications.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr Greiner's visit to China<br />
are you happy with that, do you endorse it?<br />
PM: I haven't given any consideration to it at this<br />
stage. JOURNALIST: Is the row over the telecommunication<br />
industry damaging the Government<br />
PM: No, if you look back over seven years you'll see<br />
points at which there have been arguments about this area<br />
of policy and that area of policy, but we, we usually<br />
have sufficient good sense to be able to work these<br />
things through and I'm sure we'll be able to do it again.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it possible that there can be a<br />
compromise between the Beazleys<br />
PM: I'm not going to the specifics of it. I've made it<br />
quite clear that, as far as this issue is concerned, I'll<br />
discuss that within the Party.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect this matter to be decided next<br />
Friday? PM: Well, we'll see.<br />
ends </p>
