PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESENTATION OF THE IBM ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM<br />
AWARD TO THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE<br />
TOWNSVILLE, WEDNESDAY, 20 JULY 1994<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is extremely gratifying to be able<br />
to announce an IBM Corporation Environmental Research<br />
Program award to the Australian Institute of Marine<br />
Science. I have just had the pleasure of launching the Great Barrier<br />
Reef Strategic Plan, a milestone towards the ecologically<br />
sustainable management of a world treasure. This is<br />
becoming a very satisfactory and environmentally friendly<br />
day for me.<br />
The Institute has every right to feel a little bit pleased with<br />
itself about receiving this award. IBM is a corporation that<br />
sets and expects the highest standards. IBM also<br />
possesses and values highly its reputation as a good<br />
corporate citizen. Its very generous sponsorship, through<br />
the IBM International Foundation, of programs such as the<br />
one which has produced this award amply illustrates that.<br />
IBM has offered the Institute assistance in the form of<br />
funding and computer techn0ology to the value of $ AUS1.4<br />
millibn. Now, they used to let me deal with large sums<br />
when I was Treasurer, and I can tell you that is a very<br />
generous figure. The award is one of only four granted<br />
worldwide, so is not only generous and practical but also<br />
very good for the Institute's reputation.<br />
I understand that the project outlined in the successful<br />
proposal submitted by Dr Eric Wolanski will significantly<br />
boost the research work being done at the Institute. Dr<br />
Wolanski's proposes to undertake multi-disciplinary </p>
<p>research to model oceanographic, environmental and<br />
fisheries problems on coral reefs and mangroves. The<br />
project will produce new conceptual tools to assist<br />
managers in their understanding of these threatened<br />
marine environments for conservation and sustainable<br />
management. Information from this project will be passed on to<br />
collaborating universities, and marine modellers from a<br />
number of developing countries will be trained. The<br />
project will greatly facilitate communication between<br />
scientists and environmental and resource managers both<br />
here working on the Great Barrier Reef and in South East<br />
Asia. The benefits of this award are not restricted to the<br />
Institute alone.<br />
I believe IBM is to be commended on its corporate<br />
responsibility and foresight and I am pleased to extend my<br />
government's warmest thanks to the corporation for its<br />
generosity. The Australian Institute of Marine Science, ( or AIMS for<br />
short) makes a very important contribution to the national<br />
environmental research effort. Like the IBM Corporation,<br />
the Institute enjoys a high international profile for<br />
professionalism and excellence. It is acknowledged as<br />
Australia's foremost research body in tropical marine<br />
science, and is the world leader in areas including coastal<br />
dynamics and the oceanography of coral reefs and<br />
mangroves. It has a proud record of achievement in a number of<br />
diverse and complex areas.<br />
The Institute, with Commonwealth support, has also<br />
recently begun a research program in a part of northwestern<br />
Australia containing not only the nation's most<br />
intense marine industrial activity, such as gas and oil<br />
production, but also some of our most spectacular and<br />
fragile ecosystems. The research focuses on the key<br />
marine science issues relating to sustainable management<br />
and regional development.<br />
The importance of the Institute's work is acknowledged in<br />
the most sincere way in the 1994/ 95 Federal Budget.<br />
AIMS was included in an increase in base level funding for<br />
three major Commonwealth research agencies by $ 34<br />
million over three years. </p>
<p>The Institute is also a major partner in two Cooperative<br />
Research Centres, or CRCs: the CRC for aquaculture and<br />
the CRC for ecologically sustainable development of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef. Both play crucial roles in formulating<br />
ecologically sustainable development and management<br />
strategies for their particular areas of concern.<br />
I mentioned earlier the scope for regional cooperation that<br />
the successful AIMS project proposal offers, and this is an<br />
area where the Institute already plays a part through its<br />
membership of the International Tropical Marine Resource<br />
Centre, or INTROMARC.<br />
INTROMARC is currently providing training in the<br />
ecologically sustainable management of tropical marine<br />
ecosystems to countries including Malaysia, Vietnam,<br />
Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.<br />
The Commonwealth Government places a great emphasis<br />
on environmental management and cooperation in our<br />
international region, reflected in our involvement with<br />
International Environmental Cooperation mechanisms.<br />
Memorandums of Understanding on environmental<br />
cooperation have been, or are being, concluded with<br />
regional neighbours including Indonesia, Singapore and<br />
Brunei. We play a role already in several regional cooperative<br />
bodies, and look forward to co-operating with<br />
ASEAN in their new projects. As well, we are members of<br />
APEC, whose March meeting of Environment Ministers in<br />
Vancouver resulted in an environmental vision statement<br />
and a framework of principles for integrating economy and<br />
environment in APEC.<br />
Let me again thank the IBM Corporation and congratulate<br />
all those involved in the successful project from AIMS. I<br />
wish both organisations every success with their future<br />
endeavours. They have given much to the world already,<br />
and show every sign of giving much more in an area where<br />
it is certainly needed and where an island nation like<br />
Australia should hardly be afraid to take the lead. </p>
