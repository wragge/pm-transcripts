ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister,<br />
The Rt. lion. Malcolm Fraser, M. P.<br />
I wish to announce measures being taken to effect<br />
a major re-shaping of elements of the central Commonwealth<br />
departmental machinery.<br />
The changes are essentially designed to provide for<br />
more effective management of the business of Government, and<br />
to strengthen the Government's decision making processes.<br />
Particular emphasis is being laid on improving capacity to<br />
service the Government's requirements for forward planning,<br />
priority setting and the strategic planning of Government<br />
initiatives. Given the complexity of modern democratic government,<br />
and the comparatively short term which Commonwealth governments<br />
are allowed between elections, it is crucial that there should<br />
be more orderly and effective scheduling of Government business<br />
through the various stages of research, objective setting and<br />
policy formulation, program design and the evaluation of<br />
program effectiveness. The new arrangements involve separation of the<br />
financial management and control activities of the existing<br />
Department of the Treasury from its role in broad economic<br />
policy analysis and advice to Government. For the future,<br />
the financial management and control functions will be<br />
performed by a newly created Department of Finance. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The new departmental arrangements are designed to<br />
help make more manageable the heavy work load of economic and<br />
financial expenditure management which necessarily falls to<br />
the Treasurer and senior officials. In addition, it will be<br />
possibl under the new arrangements for more concentrated<br />
attention to be given at the departmental level to the functions<br />
of financial budget management and the development of forward<br />
estimating, as well as to the analysis of economic issues and<br />
the formulation of economic strategy proposals for consideration<br />
C by Government. Outline statements of the functions approved for<br />
the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance<br />
are available. I ask leave to incorporate them in Hansard.<br />
As a result of a decision by the Cabinet this afternoon,<br />
C Sir Frederick Wheeler is to be recommended for appointment<br />
as Secretary to the Department of the Treasury. Mr R. W. Cole,<br />
presently the Australian Statistician, is to be recommended for<br />
C appointment as Secretary to the Department of Finance.<br />
The President of the Executive Council has indicated<br />
his agreement to the announcement of these recommendations.<br />
My colleague, the Treasurer, will have Ministerial<br />
responsibility for the new Department of Finance. As Treasurer,<br />
he will also retain responsibility for the Department of the<br />
Treasury. This will help ensure proper co-ordination of the<br />
activities of both Departments. The Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs will be an additional Minister Assisting the Treasurer.<br />
Formal action will be taken to give effect to<br />
these changes within a short period. </p>
<p>3.<br />
In association with these changed administrative<br />
arrangements, there will be a strengthening of the existing<br />
resources available in the Department of Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet for the evaluation of the effectiveness of<br />
Government programs. Regular evaluations will be undertaken<br />
of major sectors of Government services. Where appropriate<br />
these evaluations will be followed by detailed reviews<br />
and the development of modified or new programs.<br />
The Government has also taken steps to develop<br />
further already established capacity within the Department<br />
of Prime Minister and Cabinet to advise the Government on<br />
forward programming, priority setting and the strategic<br />
planning of Government initiatives.<br />
The intensified policy and program assessments which<br />
will thus be possible will be closely associated with<br />
accelerated development of the forward estimates system.<br />
The closest co-ordination will be maintained between relevant<br />
areas of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet<br />
and the Departments of the Treasury and Finance.<br />
The Government is convinced that the new arrangements<br />
will assist it materially in dealing effectively with the<br />
major issues which currently face the nation. .4 </p>
<p>Careful consideration has been givcnto the<br />
recommendations of the Royal Commisiion on Australian<br />
Government Administration headed by Dr Coombs, to the<br />
work of consultants which reported to the Royal Commission<br />
on relevant aspects and in particular to the report of<br />
the Royal Commission's Task Force on Economic Policy.<br />
In deciding the nature of the new arrangements, the<br />
Government has been aware of the differing expert views<br />
which found expression through the Royal Commission regarding<br />
the appropriate central administrative machinery which should<br />
be developed. The Government's decisions also reflect the outcome<br />
of its consideration of the reports of the Administrative<br />
Review Committee, which emphasised the importance of<br />
improved financial and program planning and control. The<br />
range of approaches to improving the organisation of the<br />
Government's administrative resources which these various<br />
reports have canvassed has been of great value in helping<br />
to stimulate and clarify thinking in this respect. </p>
