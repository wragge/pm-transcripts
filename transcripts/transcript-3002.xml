PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
TUESDAY, 11 SEPTEMBER 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: First I'll give you some of the decisions that<br />
Cabinet ~ nade yesterday afternoon:<br />
AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY: Cabinet decided to set up an<br />
A. C. T. Schools Authority and approved the construction of a<br />
96-bed nursing home in the A. C. T.<br />
HUMAN RIGHTS: Cabinet authorised legislation to ratify the<br />
International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights.<br />
HEALTH: Cabinet approved a three-year program of planning and<br />
research for health services. In the three years from 1973/ 74<br />
to 1975/ 76, the Australian Government will make grants up to<br />
$ 500,000 a year on a $ 2 for $ 1 basis with the States to develop<br />
State health planning agencies; grants up to $ 300,000 a year<br />
on a $ 1 for $ 1 basis to universities for independent research<br />
and evaluation of health care systems; and grants up to $ 200,000<br />
a year to universities-and other organisations for studies<br />
directed by the National Hospitals and Health Services Commission.<br />
In addition, the Australian Government will assist national,<br />
State and regional health assemblies with expenditure up to<br />
$ 25,000 a year.<br />
Cabinet approved legislation to enable the Minister for<br />
Social Security to direct medical and hospital benefit<br />
organisations on the use of their reserves.<br />
REHABILITATION: Cabinet agreed to the establishment of a<br />
Regional Rehabilitation Centre in Townsville.<br />
MEAT: As already announced by the Treasurer, Cabinet has<br />
~ decided to withdraw export incentives for meat. In addition, in<br />
order to recoup the cost of the Government's contribution to<br />
the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, Cabinet<br />
has agreed that the proposed export charge on beef and veal be<br />
increased from 1 cent a lb. to 1.6 cents a lb., with provision<br />
for exemption or partial exemption from the charge to be made<br />
by regulation in cases of hardship.<br />
WHEAT: Cabinet considered a joint submission by the Minister<br />
for Primary Industry and Minister for Overseas Trade on credit<br />
sales for wheat. We agreed in principle to credit terms up to<br />
12 months for developing countries. The difficulty in this year<br />
is, as you know, that we could sell all our wheat for cash. This,<br />
however, would disappoint, in fact it would break faith with a<br />
great number of developing countries which have been accustomed<br />
to receiving wheat on credit and some of them need wheat very<br />
badly this year because of local conditions, and we didn't want<br />
to leave them in the lurch just because they had to get credit,<br />
as they always have whereas other countries, this year, were<br />
prepared to buy for cash. It was agreed that the Government may<br />
extend such terms in exceptional cases and would, in such cases, </p>
<p>bear the additional cost to the wheat industry. Cabinet agreed<br />
to establish a committee, representing the Departments of<br />
Primary Industry, Overseas Trade, Foreign Affairs and the Treasury,<br />
to recommend on the quantity and terms of payment for wheat to<br />
be offered by the Australian Wheat Board to developing countries.<br />
Then there are a few matters on foreign affairs. At my<br />
last Press Conference I told you that I would be making an<br />
official visit to Japan during the last week of October. Today<br />
I would like to announce that my visit to China which I<br />
foreshadowed earlier this year will take place from 31 October<br />
to 3 November, i. e. directly following the visit to Japan.<br />
This will be the first official visit to China by an Australian<br />
Prime Minister although, of course, it will be my second visit,<br />
the first being in the company of many of you, the second also<br />
I hope, in the same company. We shall be accompanied by Mr Crean,<br />
Dr Patterson and Mr Connor. I see the visit as providing a<br />
valuable opportunity to exchange views with the Chinese leadership<br />
not only on a wide range of international issues but also on the<br />
development of our bilateral relationship since the Government<br />
recognised the People's Republic last December. I expect with<br />
the participation of the ministerial colleagues I have just<br />
mentioned, we should be able to broaden the exchanges and focus<br />
on specific areas of mutual interest. While we are generally happy<br />
with the progress made in our relations with China so far, we<br />
hope the visit will give fresh impetus for the development of a<br />
wider and more balanced relationship with China in the future.<br />
The Middle East. Recent developments in the Middle East<br />
have focused international attention on world oil production<br />
and the likelihood of adequate supplies continuing to be available<br />
to importing countries through the next decade or longer. In<br />
this context, I wish to announce that the Government is sending<br />
Mr Ian Haig, a fluent Arabic linguist who was until recently<br />
Australian Trade Commissioner in Beirut, on a special mission to<br />
a number of countries in the Middle East area. Mr Haig will be<br />
in the area from approximately the end of September until the<br />
middle of November. During that time he will study aspects of<br />
the oil industry in the countries he will be visiting together<br />
with the relationship existing between Australia and those<br />
countries and possible ways of broadening those relationships in<br />
the future. In a separate press release which I issued today, I<br />
announced our participation in the next meeting of the Ministerial<br />
Conference for the Economic Development of South-East Asia which<br />
is to take place in Tokyo on 12th and 13th October. Senator<br />
Willesee will represent Australia at this conference. I refer<br />
to this development here because I want to emphasise our strong<br />
and continuing interest in and readiness to assist the efforts<br />
of our nearest neighbours to promote economic growth and to<br />
raise the living standards of their peoples. That Australia has<br />
been invited to join in the work of the ministerial conference<br />
highlights the interest and shows also, I believe, that our<br />
neighbours recognise and appreicate it. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I don't know whether you have already heard, but in<br />
case you haven't, I could let you know that the total ban on<br />
French mail has been lifted. I received a telegram from the<br />
Amalgamated Postal Workers' Union in these terms:<br />
" Federal Executive of Amalgamated Postal Workers'<br />
Union of Australia unanimously resolved today<br />
to lift communications bans on metropolitan France"<br />
I have acknowledged that telegram.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, how do you reconcile the Government's decision<br />
to increase interest rates to a record level with Labor's long<br />
established policy of low interest rates colloquially called<br />
" cheap money" and economic policy often repeated and enunciated<br />
by your Treasurer, and does the decision on interest rates mean<br />
that the economic policy or policies of your Government are the<br />
prerogative of a small coterie of ministers and not for the<br />
whole of the Cabinet to decide?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You all know how much this goes against<br />
Mr Crean ' s grain to have to increase interest rates. It is,<br />
however, a course to which we have to resort because other forms<br />
of controlling or rationing money are not within our hands.<br />
When you mention a small coterie I suppose you are referring to<br />
the fact that that revaluation was decided on Sunday by the<br />
Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister, as<br />
the revaluation of last December was decided by them. Now we<br />
certainly accept responsibility for this. The interest rate<br />
matter is not solely a matter for those three, and it is, of<br />
course, very largely, mainly, a matter for the banking system.<br />
Parliament can override the banks proposals in this regard.<br />
QUESTION: Who made the decision on interest rates?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The decision on interest rates through the<br />
banking system is, of course, made by the banking system. The<br />
only matter that was discussed in this regard was that the<br />
Reserve Bank advised strongly that it should go into the<br />
business of selling bonds, and we concurred in that course.<br />
Interest rates in public loans are decided by the Loan Council<br />
on which, of course, the States have a say as well as the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
QUESTION: Is it not the case, however, that the Government put<br />
their views to the Reserve Bank that the Government believed<br />
that interest rates should be increased and not the other way<br />
round as you seem to have just put it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. This matter was raised by the Reserve Bank<br />
and the Treasury. I won't however say any more about how these<br />
matters are determined. Of course we take responsibility for<br />
revaluation. We also, as I announced, quite frankly state that<br />
we concur in the policy that the Reserve Bank proposes to take as<br />
regards the selling of bonds. But it was on a simultaneous,<br />
urgent, insistent advice of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
QUESTION: In point of fact you haven't told us that the banks<br />
were going to increase bank interest rates. It wasn't in your<br />
statement. PRIME MINISTER: No I'm going on speculation. You are quite<br />
right. QUESTION: Can you tell us when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What?<br />
QUESTION: When bank interest rates are going to be increased?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This was not discussed but the banks always<br />
announce that.<br />
QUESTION: But you did say that the Reserve Bank had advised<br />
you that this should happen that bank interest rates should<br />
be increased?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This was about the selling of bonds. That is<br />
the only thing in the statement about and it is from that<br />
that all the speculation flows concerning interest rates.<br />
QUESTION: But you, yourself, mentioned bank interest rates?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, in answer to Mr Power. He raised this<br />
matteir, and it has been raised in the House.<br />
QUESTION: Bank interest rates will increase?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would expect so.<br />
QUESTION: Do you know when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: You aJlso said that you didn't have<br />
PRIME MINISTER: But quite frankly you know that if I did know<br />
I wouldn't say don't you?<br />
COMMENT: Well it strikes mec that it could be said actually.<br />
You say there are no other ways of rationing within your hands.<br />
Does this mean that there is going to he raitioning through the<br />
bank system as well as through the interest rates?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, of course, any increase in interest rates<br />
is done with tile objective of encouraging e. xpenditure in some<br />
directions and discouraging it in others. of course interest<br />
rates are a form of rationing.<br />
QUESTION: I would like to say how interesting I have found this<br />
conference. 1 think Parliament ought to be equally interested.<br />
Are you going to stop this practice of explaining things to the<br />
press before you explain it to the House and do you remember how<br />
critical you used to be of other Prime Ministers when they were<br />
doing exactly what you are doing now? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't think any Prime Minister certainly not<br />
in recent times has given Press Conferences as regularly and<br />
freely as the present Prime Minister. If members of the<br />
Parliament, of the House of Representatives on either side, were<br />
to ask me questions such as I have been asked now I would answer<br />
them as I have answered them now. I have foreborne to ask<br />
members of the Government parties or to suggest to members of<br />
the Government parties that they should ask questions like this.<br />
This is a very obvious device to which anybody in my position<br />
can resort. There has been a great deal of speculation in<br />
the papers as to matters that come before Cabinet and as to<br />
matters which have been determined by Cabinet. If any member of<br />
parliament were to ask questions within the terms of the<br />
Standing Orders on any of these subjects of course I would answer<br />
the question. But I would venture to suggest that if I were to<br />
make a statement on all these matters, as I have just now, and<br />
before questions in the House, I would be constantly interrupted.<br />
And then, of course, I would have members of the Liberal Party and<br />
the Country Party wanting leave to comment on them. Question<br />
Time is three quarters of an hour every morning. Never less than<br />
three quarters of an hour, and any member of parliament can ask<br />
any of these questions and he will get an answer.<br />
QUESTION: In a recent television interview you told a British<br />
television interviewer that you admired most, of the world leaders,<br />
Willy Brandt.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Would you now follow Brandt's example in expressing<br />
your concern either publicly or to the Soviet authorities of<br />
the Soviet Government's treatment of their intellectuals in<br />
particular Dr Sharkarov and Alexander Solzenhitzen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wasn't proposing and, despite your invitation,<br />
I don't think it is likely that I will protest to the Soviet<br />
Union about these matters but nevertheless I can say here what<br />
I think must be in the minds of you all. It is one of the constant<br />
disappointments in the Soviet system that like successive<br />
Russian governments for the last couple of hundred years, they so<br />
penalise their intellectuals. There is a premium put on<br />
conformity and it is one of the ugly features of Soviet life.<br />
I would have hoped that it was diminishing. I regret to say that<br />
there have been so many recent incidents where this penalising<br />
has come to public knowledge.<br />
QUESTION: Do you intend to hold a judicial inquiry into the<br />
security services of Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr MacCallum was going to ask me that question.<br />
COMMENT: No, it's not true, I have another one on the security<br />
services of Australia. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I think it is very likely that I shall ask a<br />
judge to hold an inquiry into our security services. When I do,<br />
I will announce the terms and announce the name of the judge.<br />
One of the reasons for doing so, of course, will be so that<br />
interested persons or organisations can let him have their views.<br />
It would not, however, be an inquiry which, because of the nature<br />
of the matter, be held in public. Nor would I believe it is<br />
a matter upon which the report would be published.<br />
QUESTION: The judge'. s name has been mentioned though Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no doubt. I saw one judge mentioned.<br />
I have never mentioned it to him, nor has he volunteered.<br />
QUESTION: Why is it necessary to hold an inquiry into Australia's<br />
security service?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No comment.<br />
QUESTION: Can I ask you about the security services in New<br />
Guinea. Mr Somare, the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea,<br />
said yesterday that he felt Papua New Guinea could handle its<br />
own security and intelligence services, and he went out of his<br />
way to link the two together several times at his press club<br />
lunch security and intelligence. Can I ask you what is the<br />
status of the Australian intelligence service in New Guinea;<br />
is it linked to ASIO; is Mr Somare's Government aware of<br />
everything that it is doing; and will the Australian Government<br />
in view of the fairly broad hint that Mr Somare gave yesterday,<br />
withdraw its own security and intelligence services, particularly<br />
its intelligence services, when self-government comes on<br />
1 December. And can I also explain that I am informally dressed<br />
at your invitation because of the lights of the foreign television<br />
crews. PRIME MINISTER: We are gradually deteriorating at this conference.<br />
The first question referred to a British television interviewer.<br />
The next reference was by one of you who, at an earlier conference,<br />
had referred to him as a Pommy journalist, and now I have a<br />
reference to a foreign television station. I would like the<br />
loyal viewers of this session to realise that you are referring<br />
to the BBC. I can say no more I will say no more about this<br />
matter. I would say to the BBC itself, I would say to<br />
Mr David Frost himself what I will say to you. On this matter<br />
I can and will say no more that any activities of this nature<br />
which Australia carries on in Papua New Guinea are carried on with<br />
the knowledge and approbation of the Government of Papua New Guinea.<br />
Mr Somare and I did not discuss this matter. He stayed with me<br />
last night. He had dinner at the Lodge and stayed the night.<br />
QUESTION: Since we last met the Senate has rejected one of<br />
your bills of substance the Electoral Bill. Do you intend to<br />
now seek a double dissolution? </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't even answer that question in the<br />
House of Representatives at this stage.<br />
QUESTION: Do you regard your announcement that the Government<br />
intends to site its second international airport at Gaiston as<br />
irreversible? PRIME MINISTER: No. I think it is a very strong probability.<br />
I don't know how much more you want me to say on this subject at<br />
this stage. The irreversible political fact is that no Australian<br />
Government will increase the operation at Mascot. The former<br />
Government realised that, the present Government realises this.<br />
The people within the area of Mascot or Towra Point or<br />
Wattamolla will not tolerate an increase in aircraft movements<br />
in that area. Everybody knows it. Now it is completely unreal<br />
to suggest that what would be the cheapest proposal, that is<br />
double the facilities at Mascot can ever come into effect. In<br />
those circumstances, as I told you a fortnight ago at this press<br />
conference, the closest feasible site is at Gaiston and it has<br />
the great advantage that fewer people would be affected who are<br />
already there and fewer people in any proposed development of<br />
the area would be affected than at any other site. There are<br />
two other features that should be acknowledged. Sydney does need<br />
better airport facilities than it has at the moment. Secondly,<br />
most of the people who use air facilities live on the north side<br />
of the harbour. In fact, Galston would suit them more than it<br />
would suit most people who use air traffic.<br />
QUESTION: Do you expect the economic measures you announced on<br />
Sunday to lead to some unemployment if they are to be successful<br />
against inflation? If so, what level of unemployment would you<br />
allow before reversing it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't expect that there will be any<br />
unemployment from the measurus that we announced on Sunday night.<br />
The adjustment measures which we devised after the revaluation<br />
before Christmas are available to meet any consequences of the<br />
revaluation which we announced on Sunday.<br />
QUESTION: I was thinking more of the interest rates. Will they<br />
lead to a cutback on demand?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They will 1 ad to sonic cutback on demand, but<br />
this will be healthy beca-s tlore was ani extraordinary increase<br />
in the money suppl*, y lin Lic fiiiancia1 yt~ ar an increase of<br />
26 per cent in the amount of money during 1972/ 73. most of that<br />
increase, of course, taking placce while Mr Snedden was Treasurer<br />
and before Mir Crean became TreasLurer. TLhis was obviously an<br />
increase which could not be a', lowed to co) ntinue you couldn't<br />
continue increasing the supply of money at that rate. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
QUESTION: Have you any comment at all upon the Australian High<br />
Court's decision on the Rhodesian Centre, and is this one<br />
instance where you are sorry you turned thumbs down on the<br />
Privy Council affair?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I don't believe that appeals should be taken<br />
from Australian judges to British judges. The High Court's<br />
decision points out that, as the law stands at the moment, the<br />
Postmaster-General was not entitled to take the steps he took in<br />
respect to the Rhodesian Information Service. We considered this<br />
this morning in one of the Cabinet committees and I expect that<br />
there will be a submission by the Postmaster-General as to<br />
possible amendments of the law. It is important in our view<br />
that we should carry out Australia's international obligations.<br />
QUESTION: The advice from the Reserve Bank and the Treasury<br />
on controlling the money supply did it contain any other advice?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can't go into matters such as this. I am sure<br />
you will understand.<br />
QUESTION: On the Rhodesia question. Have you decided not to<br />
introduce legislation using the external affairs power to back<br />
up the sanctions against Rhodesia, and do you intend simply to<br />
work on the postal power.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would think that we can also use the external<br />
affairs power. That would be the justification for amending the<br />
Posts and Telegraphs legislation. I wouldn't like to have any<br />
restriction on mails or telecommunications except in the very<br />
special circumstances which international organisations have<br />
applied to the situation in Rhodesia and which they may well, in<br />
the coming years, apply to other countries in Southern Africa.<br />
As I read the judgement I have had to read it pretty quickly<br />
I would believe that the external affairs power would justify<br />
legislation. Of course, as you suggest, it would be justified<br />
under the Posts and Telegraphs legislation anyhow, but we would<br />
be doing it not as a special bill just dealing with Rhodesia<br />
but just as an aspect to amendments to the Posts and Telegraphs<br />
legislation which are always taking place. We may the<br />
submission is not there yet of course make this amendment in<br />
the course of other amendments to the main Posts and Telegraphs<br />
Act. QUESTION: On the question of interest rates again. In February<br />
the Government required borrowers from overseas to deposit<br />
per cent in the Reserve Bank without interest. Since then,<br />
interest rates have shifted up and they will now presumably<br />
shoot up rather sharply. If Australia becomes again attractive<br />
to overseas lenders, would you be prepared in principle to vary<br />
this deposit which is now 25 per cent. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is no proposal before us, and I am not<br />
proposing to initiate any proposal to vary the 25 per cent.<br />
Australia is very attractive to lenders and traders. We have<br />
got to face the fact that we are still having a very great inflow<br />
of overseas funds, and it is the duty of all countries to try<br />
to see that their trade remains in balance this way. A country<br />
is irresponsible if it is always trading at a deficit or always<br />
trading at a surplus. One ought to try, particularly if you<br />
are a big trading country as we are, to have a balance.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us formally why the decision has been<br />
taken to control health fund reserves. Has the Government had<br />
advice from the Attorney-General's Department that it now lacks<br />
any power to control reserves?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't got any papers here with me on this.<br />
You ought to ask Mr Bill Hayden any further details on this.<br />
QUESTION: At the last Ministerial meeting between Japan and<br />
Australia I think the Japanese were keen for Australia to enter<br />
a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. I think, in the meantime,<br />
some months ago you initiated an inquiry into this. Can you<br />
say what your approach would be on this question at your talks<br />
in Tokyo?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm myself very much attracted to such a treaty.<br />
The traditional name for it is a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce<br />
and Navigation. I am not wedded to any particular form of words<br />
in its title. I do believe, however, that it would be<br />
appropriate for Japan and Australia in a formal context to<br />
acknowledge the very great interdependence they have on each<br />
other. Japan should be certain that she will always have a<br />
secure access to Australia's resources. She is deficient in<br />
those resources. Australia has by comparable standards a<br />
plenitude of such resources. We must never get back to the<br />
situation that was produced about 1940 when Japan was denied<br />
access to markets and resources. It is important that Japan<br />
should always be sure that she gets such resources. And this would<br />
apply not only to mineral resources but also to primary resoures.<br />
One only has to see the distress caused in Japan by America's<br />
sudden cutting off of the soya bean. By the same token, Australia<br />
should be assured that as Japan's prosperity continues she may<br />
well be the most prosperous country in the world per head of<br />
population in the next couple of decades that our prosperity<br />
rises with hers. There are very few countries in the world apart<br />
from adjacent countries, whose prosperity is so interdependent<br />
as that of Australia and Japan. We ought to acknowledge that<br />
position much more frankly and formally than we have. I believe<br />
a treaty would be an appropriate way to do it. </p>
<p>QUESTION: In view of the cheapening of Australian shares on<br />
overseas markets, is there any prospect of the Government using<br />
its considerable reserves to buy back portions of selected<br />
industries or key industries which at the moment are relatively<br />
cheap on overseas markets?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This has been formally discussed among people<br />
whom I meet. There is no formal paper being discussed on it at<br />
the moment. I don't in any way disparage the idea.<br />
QUESTION: Do you have any information on the progress of the<br />
current series of French tests in the Pacific. Do you know, for<br />
instance, if they are within one or two tests of finishing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no more information on this.<br />
QUESTION: I am not sure that I understood your answer to<br />
Mr Barron, but it might have been my fault. I think that when<br />
you reduced tariff rates you said in your statement that those<br />
who lost their jobs because of the Government's action would<br />
receive payment from the Government at the rate of their average<br />
weekly earnings over the previous six months. Do you have in<br />
mind a similar scheme for people who lose their jobs because<br />
of the new interest rate policy and, if not, don't you think<br />
there is a rather large anomaly involved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no further reduction in tariff<br />
rates. Accordingly, the measure which was taken following the<br />
reduction in tariffs by 25 per cent across the board doesn't<br />
arise. The adjustment assistance which was made available<br />
after the 7 per cent revaluation last December is available<br />
following last Sunday's 5 per cent revaluation.<br />
QUESTION: If I could try to clarify my question. What is the<br />
difference between a man who loses his job because the Government<br />
cuts tariffs and a man who loses his job because the Government<br />
and/ or its bank raises interest rates?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe people will lose their jobs<br />
in the circumstances that you mention. </p>
