COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY ( Q2 3MAY; 1~ 96<br />
E3IeRAJ<br />
The -Rt Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
REFERENDUM<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 18 May 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister&gt;--by leave-I move:<br />
That this House, having studied the arguments<br />
set out in the official No case, reaffirms its view<br />
that it is in the interest of good parliamentary<br />
government in Australia to remove the need now<br />
existing under the Commonwealth Constitution to<br />
increase the number of senators whenever the<br />
number of members in the House of Representatives<br />
is increased, and to impose the limit proposed<br />
on the extent to which the House of Representatives<br />
can be. increased.<br />
I have taken this opportunity to propose this<br />
motion because, although this House previously<br />
assented unanimously to the legislation<br />
that enables us to introduce referendum<br />
proposals and to present them to the people<br />
and . this was followed by the support of an<br />
overwhelming majority of the Senate, since<br />
then the official Yes case and the official No<br />
case have been published. Tonight it is my<br />
purpose to refer briefly to the elements in<br />
the case that we put before the Parliament<br />
when the proposal to break -the nexus between<br />
the House of Representatives and the<br />
Senate was ' adopted, and* at the same time<br />
to make some examination of the principal<br />
arguments that have been advanced in the<br />
official No case.<br />
Honourable members will recall that the<br />
first of the principal purposes of this refer-<br />
7060/ 67 endum proposal is to remove the need to<br />
increase the number of senators whenever<br />
the number of -members of the House of<br />
Representatives is increased. This is what we<br />
term familiarly as the nexus between the<br />
House of Representatives and the Senate<br />
under the Constitution as at present worded.<br />
The second purpose is to impose a limit,<br />
which is put before the people for the first<br />
time, on the extent to which membership of<br />
the House of Representatives can be increased.<br />
It is too seldom realised that as the<br />
Constitution stands, the Parliament has<br />
unlimited powers to increase the size of the<br />
House of Representatives whenever it so<br />
wishes, provided at the same time it increases<br />
the size of the Senate. I have heard this<br />
referendum described by its critics as a<br />
proposal to increase the size of the Parliament.<br />
We do not need a constitutional<br />
change to do that. We need a constitutional<br />
change for this reason: If at any time the<br />
size of the Parliament is increased, we must<br />
accompany an increase in the House of<br />
Representatives with an increase of as nearly<br />
as practicable half that number in the Senate.<br />
I remind the House that section 24 of the<br />
Commonwealth Constitution provides:<br />
The House of Representatives shall be composed<br />
of members directly chosen by the people<br />
of the Commonwealth, and the number of such </p>
<p>members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice<br />
the number of senators.<br />
In the official case for the Yes proposal<br />
the Leader of the Australian Labor Party,<br />
the Leader of the Australian Country Party<br />
and I have joined as spokesmen for -our<br />
respective parties. We have put the case<br />
in favour of an affirmative vote. We have<br />
put the view that the Senate consisting of.<br />
sixty senators-ten from each of the six<br />
States-needs no increase at this time.<br />
Membership of the ' House of Representatives<br />
is based on populatioh growth. We<br />
have been going through a period of rapid<br />
and continuing population growth, and<br />
this situation faces us as far ahead as we<br />
can see. The House last dealt with the size<br />
of the Parliament in 1949. If this Parliament<br />
runs its full course twenty years will<br />
have elapsed by the time we , reach the' next<br />
general election. In 1949 each member of<br />
the House of Representatives represented<br />
on an average 66,000 people. Today the<br />
average is 94,000 people,: and by 1969<br />
the figure will be well over 97,000.<br />
There are some people-this appears<br />
to include those who have presented the<br />
official No case-who take the view that<br />
there should never be any increase in the<br />
size of the Parliament. This is. the logical<br />
conclusion to be drawn from the argument<br />
advanced in the No case. It does not seem<br />
to matter that since membership was ' last<br />
increased the population will have risen -by<br />
1969 from eight million to twelve million.<br />
What does a-mere 50% increase in population<br />
matter? What does ' a mere increase<br />
in the complexity of the business of government<br />
matter? What does a mere<br />
increase in the variety and number of<br />
subjects that this Parliament ' is called upon<br />
to deal with matter? Even in, the eyes<br />
of those who have joined together in<br />
presenting the official No case there must<br />
be some point at which they recognise that<br />
the ' increase in population ' has brought<br />
about some need for an increase in the<br />
size of the House of Representatives.<br />
However,' while the: nexus remains the<br />
change can be accomplished only if at the<br />
same time we increase the number of<br />
members' in the Senate to' half the extent<br />
of the increase in the number of members<br />
in the House of Representatives.<br />
We have proposed that the -number ot<br />
electorates in each State should be determined by dividing the population of the<br />
State by not less than 85,000. This does not<br />
mean that automatically there would be<br />
an increase in membership for each 85,000<br />
people, but it does set a minimum. For<br />
the first time in the history of this country<br />
a limit would be imposed upon the extent<br />
to which the numerical strength of the<br />
. Parliament could be increased. We as<br />
members of the Parliament are willing to<br />
accept that limitation because we want<br />
the public to be assured that we are not<br />
seeking any. inordinate increase in numbers.<br />
All we want to ensure is a Parliament that<br />
effectively represents the interests of the<br />
people whom we represent in this place.<br />
Of course, there is a different way of going<br />
about it. It so happens that we as members<br />
of the National Parliament represent on an<br />
average more electors than does a member<br />
of the House of Commons in the Parliament<br />
at Westminster. Yet I have not heard<br />
the people of Britain complain that they<br />
are over-governed, that they have too many<br />
parliamentarians. They value the services<br />
they receive from their members. Theirs<br />
is a strong democracy.<br />
As I said, we could go about parliamentary<br />
representation in another way, as<br />
is done in the United States of America.<br />
There a member of parliament represents<br />
far more people than each of us does or<br />
would propose. However, to carry out his<br />
duties a member of Congress or a member<br />
of the United States Senate needs a very<br />
large official staff. Thus the people are<br />
served largely by officials. I do not think the<br />
Australian people or the people of the<br />
United Kingdom want that sort of representation.<br />
They have become accustomed to<br />
being able to go to their own parliamentary<br />
representative and have him look after their<br />
interests-not have them looked after by a<br />
first secretary, a second secretary or a third<br />
secretary as part of a large staff as has been<br />
found necessary in the case of a Federal<br />
member in the United States so that he may<br />
provide some representation for his constituents.<br />
I doubt whether there is very much<br />
economic difference between the systems<br />
that operate, in the United States and<br />
Australia. .1 repeat that this is the. first attempt to<br />
write a specific check into the Constitution;<br />
the first attempt to limit the rate of growth<br />
of the House of Representatives. With today's<br />
population a quota of 85,000 would </p>
<p>give a' membership in the House of Representatives<br />
of 136, an ' increase of thirteen<br />
seats throughout . the whole of Australia.<br />
The Senate would be left unchanged at sixty.<br />
This would m: ean' that each seat in the<br />
House would represent 85,000 people compared<br />
with the figure of 66,000 when the<br />
Parliament was last increased in 1948<br />
coming up to the election of 1949. Unless<br />
this nexus is. removed . any, increase in the<br />
House of Representatives must be accompanied,<br />
by an. increase in the size of the<br />
Senate on a two to one basis. By this proposal<br />
that we put forward to break the nexus<br />
there is no question, as I shall establish,<br />
of eroding the proper role or powers of the<br />
Senate or of preventing its future enlargement<br />
if the Parliament so decides. The prevailing<br />
view is that the Senate of sixty can<br />
discharge : effectively its role as a house of<br />
review and as custodian of the rights of the<br />
smaller States.<br />
have': mentioned the United States of<br />
America.' It" has just on eighteen times our<br />
population. and has' a Senate of just on 100<br />
membies cormpared with our Senate at ' present'of<br />
sixty. Yet'the Senate in-the United<br />
Statis enjoys a ' prestige and ' an ' authority<br />
which'I think would be envied by any upper<br />
chamber in any part. of the world. So the<br />
effectiveness of the Senate does not depend<br />
on . numbeis. Its powers are defined and<br />
establisfhd' in the Coinmonwealth Constitution.<br />
Other -countries with a two house<br />
system operate successfully without the need<br />
for a nexus between the two houses. I have<br />
done some research on this matter and apart<br />
from Australia there is only ' one country<br />
which I have been able to discover-it is<br />
Norway-with anything approaching such a<br />
nexus. The' proposal is designed to allow<br />
th'esmallest increase in the House of Representatives<br />
which we believe to be consistent<br />
with effective representation without the<br />
necessity-at the same time to make adjustments<br />
in the size' of the Senate.<br />
I do not'want to spend a great deal of<br />
time on: the positive side of our argument<br />
because this '. was covered quite . adequately<br />
in the second reading'debate when the proposal<br />
was originally, before us. It is all on<br />
the record. I have made my statements on<br />
the matter on television and over the radio,<br />
as have the Leider of the'Opposition ( Mr<br />
Whitlam) and the Acting Leader of the<br />
Australian Country Party ( Mr Anthony), who have joined in the support'of the case<br />
which is now being presented to the people.<br />
But it does become necessary to make some<br />
analysis of the ' officialcase presented for<br />
the No argument. The case has'been presenited,<br />
as I understand it, by the two members<br />
in the Senate of the Australian Democratic<br />
Labor Party, ' assisted by a Liberal<br />
Party senator, Senator Wright, and certain<br />
others of the small gr. ou who voted against<br />
this proposal in the Senate.<br />
Stokes-They. are. all senators.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-Yes, the only<br />
people who have joined in resisting the Yes<br />
case-in the official case anyhow-are senators<br />
and : they are a very small minority of<br />
the total membership of the Senate. The<br />
votiig ' in the Senate on the proposal was<br />
forty-five in favour of . what we are now<br />
advocating and seven against.<br />
, I. find the No case saddening. It is quite<br />
disheartening in a way. to find in these days<br />
that men who represent the people in the<br />
Senate-they are . a small minority of the<br />
total membership of the Senate-can resort<br />
to. these fusty,! old-fashioned appeals to prejudice,<br />
picking up the sort of cliches that<br />
have. been bandied around by critics outside<br />
the Parliament and with which we have had<br />
to' cope from time to time. I will refer<br />
further to that matter later. To me it is a<br />
sad thing that there is still a body. of men<br />
to be found in the other chamber who cannot<br />
make ' an objective, dispassionate ' and<br />
logical appeal to the people on the strength<br />
of the argument they can present but instead<br />
must resort to prejudice-to actual dishonesty<br />
in at least one instance, as I shall<br />
demonstrate-and -to : misleading . argument<br />
in. order to try to frighten people by the<br />
bogies they create or the picture they conjure<br />
up of.' the dreadful -things which; this<br />
wicked House of Representatives, chosen by<br />
the people, will:: do . to the people of<br />
Australia.. Let me go into that niatter in a little more<br />
detail. The case for No reads:<br />
Vote NO because:<br />
We do'not need more parliamentarians.<br />
Australia is already over-governed.<br />
SA Yes vote would be a vote against the<br />
interests of the States, particularly the small<br />
States, and country districts.<br />
Honourable members will note the appeal<br />
there to people in. the smaller States. The<br />
supporters of the No case direct a sectional </p>
<p>appeal to country interests. Let us see how<br />
these arguments stand. up to the most superficial<br />
analysis, and I would hope that my<br />
analysis could go a good deal deeper than<br />
that but it does not have to go very deep<br />
in order to explode the arguments for the<br />
No ' case. First I deal with the proposition<br />
that we do not need more parliamentarians,<br />
stated ' quite absolutely without any reference<br />
to this. point of time or any other<br />
point, of time. The same argument. could<br />
be applied with as much logic when the<br />
population of Australia is 20 million, not<br />
building up to 20 million at the 11.5<br />
million stage as we are now. If that is the<br />
strength of -the argument it can apply at<br />
any time. When is the time that you need<br />
more parliamentarians? This Parliament has<br />
not shown itself over eager to increase its<br />
size during the period of our federation.<br />
In fact, since 1901 when the federation<br />
was formed there has been only one substantial<br />
increase in the size of this Parliament.<br />
The House of Representatives numbered<br />
seventy-five when the Parliament was<br />
first constituted. The number had actually<br />
declined to seventy-four when in 1948 the<br />
Government of the day decided that it had<br />
become necessary, for a variety of causes,<br />
to increase the size of the Parliament. There<br />
was a substantial increase in the numbers<br />
in the House of Representatives to 121.<br />
Thswas done because the House had not<br />
been touched for forty-seven years.<br />
If this Parliament runs its normal<br />
course, by the time of the next election<br />
twenty years will have elapsed since the<br />
Parliament. was last increased, and our<br />
population will have increased by almost<br />
We are not proposing a major increase.<br />
We have set a limit on the increase<br />
we can achieve. We say that there must<br />
bme emnobt efre.. wI esr trtehsas n th8a5t,, 0 0b0e cpaeursseo nisf fwoer reeaacdh<br />
the No case we get a picture of this Parliament<br />
increasing step by step every few<br />
years. It is no ' t in the nature of the animal<br />
for that to happen, as we know. It -is very<br />
rare to find all parties in ' the Parliament<br />
supporting a proposal, as -they have on this<br />
occasion. * It is' rare to find a government<br />
and an* opposition saying at the same time:<br />
This is what we should do in relation to<br />
the Parliament'. It is even rare to find a<br />
situation in which a redistribution of electorates,<br />
despite the fact that some may have become disproportionately large in relation<br />
to others, should be carried out. They<br />
should be carried out. There has not been,<br />
on an average, a redistribution every six<br />
years in the life of the federation. Usually,<br />
changes have merely been in the boundaries.<br />
Only on one occasion, as I have mentioned,<br />
has there been a significant change in the<br />
number of members.<br />
I said that I would demonstrate that<br />
there is at least one quite dishonest statement<br />
in this document. It is to be found on<br />
the first page of -the No case. It is this:<br />
In this referendum the Government wants you<br />
to remove this safeguard-<br />
That is, the nexusfrom<br />
the Constitution. If you do that, you will<br />
be destroying the only braking device against<br />
unnecessary increases in the size of the National<br />
Parliament. How can men of honesty say that, when<br />
all honourable members know that part of<br />
our proposal is the provision that we cannot<br />
increase the number of members beyond<br />
the point where -there are fewer than 85,000<br />
persons in each electorate. This just baffles<br />
me. Either those who prepared this case<br />
have not understood the proposal or this<br />
is an entirely dishonest presentation of the<br />
facts. There is a braking device against unnecessary<br />
increases and that braking device<br />
is the size of the Australian population.<br />
The No case goes, on to state:<br />
Moreover, if you vote NO and retain t" i nexus<br />
provision, you will preserve the position and<br />
power of the Senate and will prevent the Senate<br />
from being weakened.<br />
This is a picture conjured up to frighten<br />
people into believing that this upper chamber<br />
is to be weakened and shorn of its<br />
authority. Will anybody who reads this<br />
document pause to ask: If this statement<br />
is correct why is it that forty-five out of<br />
fifty-two of these senators whose powers<br />
are going to be weakened have joined in<br />
supporting the Yes case? I hope that in<br />
a democratic system majorities still count<br />
for something, and when they are overwhelming<br />
majorities I hope that they will<br />
have some persuasive effect. I have no need<br />
to labour the point, Mr Acting Speaker. If<br />
the Senate were in serious danger of having<br />
its power or. authority weakened by this<br />
proposal, would the overwhelming majority<br />
of senators have joined in supporting it? </p>
<p>I come now to the next argument in the<br />
No case. It states:<br />
Always think . of the Senate as the States<br />
Assembly, which was its name in the draft Constitution.<br />
It is your House, designed to protect<br />
the interests of your State. Thus any attack on<br />
the Senate is an attack on the protection of the<br />
interests of your State in the Federal Parliament.<br />
The first comment I make on thai statement<br />
is that all honourable members in<br />
this. place, with the. exception of my friends<br />
the honourable member for the Australian<br />
Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) and the<br />
honourable member for the Northern Territory<br />
( Mr Calder), are representatives from<br />
individual States of the Commonwealth. If<br />
this proposal were an attack upon the<br />
position of the States would we have had<br />
a unanimous vote in this House by people<br />
who are elected from States, who are<br />
representatives of States, and who are<br />
accountable to electorates in those States?<br />
The question has only to be put against<br />
the facts for the answer to -be automatically<br />
supplied. I can go further: The Senate has<br />
always been regarded as an additional safeguard<br />
for the States-as a custodian of<br />
State rights. If the interests of the States<br />
were threatened by our proposal would we<br />
have had forty-five out of fifty-two senators,<br />
elected as representatives of those States and<br />
charged with the role-as they see it-of<br />
safeguarding the interests of the . States,<br />
joining in this proposal with us?<br />
The next point refers to the' interests of<br />
country districts: Here again the bogy has<br />
been conjured up: ' Don't vote Yes because<br />
if you do terrible things will be done to<br />
the country electorates'.. In each of the<br />
three parties constituting this. House we<br />
have representatives of country electorates.<br />
Some are in' the Country,, Party-as' the<br />
name implies. The Labor Party. -certainly<br />
can claim to have representatives from<br />
rural electorates. And of course'. there are<br />
many in the Liberal Party. Do those representatives<br />
of rural electorates consider that<br />
rural interests are being threatened by this<br />
proposal? If they do, it is very odd . that they<br />
should have joined in a unanimous vote on<br />
this matter in this chamber. Again, this<br />
argument ' just does not stand up to<br />
examination. In the time available . to me I cannot go<br />
through all the arguments set out in this<br />
document. I do not avoid any. of the . difficult<br />
arguments. I ' have referred to what the authors of the document have set out as<br />
being the central propositions favouring<br />
a No vote.. However, I would like to refer<br />
honourable members to the passage appearing<br />
on the second page-of the No case.<br />
There the authors have set out what they<br />
consider . the growth in numbers will be<br />
in steps over a period of years. I have<br />
already pointed out that this is not the<br />
way that this system works-as the history<br />
of our federation has demonstrated. It is<br />
rare for the Parliament to increase ' its size.<br />
1 repeat that it has been done but once<br />
in the history of our federation. I cannot<br />
see-and I am a fairly seasoned politician<br />
in this place-the Parliament, or for that<br />
matter governments, coming along very<br />
frequently with endeavours to increase-the<br />
size of the Parliament-not when we consider<br />
all the discomfort involved in the<br />
procedure of redistribution of electorates<br />
and all the other implications of that process.<br />
Let me just mention one of the more<br />
important implications. Inside this chamber<br />
there is a check-an inbuilt safeguard.<br />
Three parties are represented. Each of those<br />
parties, understandably and very properly,<br />
watches . closely the movements, in the<br />
numbers of electors and the size of electorates.<br />
If any of the three parties, came to<br />
the conclusion that what was being proposed<br />
was. unfair or unreasonable, the parliamentary:<br />
action which it could take, either<br />
here or in what is, now almost chronically<br />
an evenly divided Senate, could have the<br />
effect of checking the process in the lower<br />
house. Let me give an illustration; We are<br />
a coalition Government. If we brought'forward<br />
proposals for ' an increase in the. size<br />
of Parliament ' which our colleagues in the<br />
Country Party felt would work ' seriously<br />
to their detriment, they would not join with<br />
us in such a decision. Nor would we be<br />
able to' give. effect to that proposal without<br />
their support. On the other hand, if what we<br />
proposed seemed unreasonable to the'meinm-<br />
6ers of whichever party happened to be<br />
in opposition at the time, they could, with<br />
the numbers that they could reasonably<br />
count upon in the Senate, make the proposal<br />
extremely difficult of achievement,<br />
not merely, by their voting strength but by<br />
the campaign they could wage in the electorates<br />
throughout the country. Quite apart<br />
from anything that the Constitution provides,<br />
there is, as any politician in-this place </p>
<p>would' know; -an inbuilt check and a safeguard<br />
against arbitrary, unreasonable<br />
increases by either side: of-politics.<br />
Someminor arguments have been introduced<br />
into the No case and I even regret<br />
hlaving to make. reference, ( o them becaiuse<br />
they are in a sense petty, and almost' perile<br />
in what they convey to; the piblic. However,<br />
. these arguments are, put with: some<br />
strength and . emphasis in . the, concluding<br />
passages of the No . case. Honourable<br />
members will find0 there a re'frence--1<br />
deplore that it should have come from a<br />
member of either House of the Parliament<br />
-to increases, in parliamentar salaries and<br />
the cost of government which allegedly will<br />
flow.. ifthe nexus, is broken. On the last page<br />
of, the., No case honourable members will<br />
find it stated. that the last: increase in the<br />
numbers of members of Parliament resulted<br />
in. fewer. sitting days and that members' pay<br />
increased from $ 3,000 to $ 7,000 a year.<br />
Then there appear,' in capitals, the words:<br />
' What next?' Does anybody seriously argue<br />
th'at' the duties : and-responsibilities of-a<br />
memrber of this'House have decreased since<br />
1949, ' that being' the ' last time ' when there<br />
was avote-on: the increase in the size of<br />
the Parliament? : Certainly no member<br />
present would accept that as a statement of<br />
fact. We all know the : increase -in the<br />
number and complexity of'matters with<br />
which we,' as members of the. Parliament,<br />
have: been called upon to deal.<br />
Let us take the salary aspect. Why do<br />
those . who . support the No case not. say<br />
honestly in this ' document that the period<br />
to which' they ' are referring is between<br />
1947, when the pay of a member of Parliament<br />
was fixed'at $ 3,000, and 1967, when<br />
it siands at $ 7,000? ' Why do they not go<br />
onh'to say that' over that period, there have<br />
been' quite' substantial increases in the basic<br />
wage? [ Extension ' of time granted.] I thank<br />
the House for its indulgence. These facts are<br />
certainly relevant ' to the argument and are<br />
of general' interest to honourable members.<br />
The increase in the salary of a'member of<br />
Parliament over the period' from 1947 to<br />
1967 has been 133%.' Over the same period<br />
the -basic wage hais been increased by<br />
201%, that is, from $ 10.90 to $ 32.80. But<br />
what is more' significant-we are " dealing<br />
now with : the : community as a wholeis<br />
the mihovement in the average weekly<br />
wage. Betwe'n 1947 and 1967 the increase in average weekly wages was of the order<br />
of 285%. This Parliament has not been<br />
greedy. I shall not labour the point. Whatever<br />
cheap advantage those who joined in<br />
the No " case seek to ' gain from this point,<br />
I. say that it'is not substantiated by the<br />
facts. . Mr Whitlam-The cost of this House is<br />
30c per head . of population.<br />
SMr HAROLD HOLT-I ' will come to<br />
that. ' Those-who have put-forward the No<br />
case' begin their great peroration by saying:<br />
' Vote no-we do not need more parliamentarians'.<br />
We say that at the present time<br />
we ' do not need more senators. An overwhelming<br />
majority of senators-forty-five<br />
to seven-join with us -in saying that. They<br />
continue: ' Vote no-protect the small<br />
States and country districts'. I-have already<br />
referred to that argument, and I hope that<br />
I have demolished it. They also say: ' Vote<br />
no-prevent unnecessary increases in the<br />
size : of the House of Representatives'. In<br />
principle at leastfwe can agree with them<br />
here. We do hot want unnecessary increases<br />
in the'; size of the House of Representatives.<br />
and we have taken the responsibility of proposing;<br />
for the first time, a limit,. not previously<br />
imposed"' by the Constitution, upon<br />
the size ' to which the House of Representatives<br />
may grow. Their final adjuration is:<br />
' Vote'no-prevent unnecessary increases in<br />
the cost of. government.' This terrible<br />
burden of. the cost of government! Let me<br />
give the. House the relevant figure.<br />
' The total cost of the House of Representatives.<br />
and. the. Senate works out at<br />
approximately .40c per head of population<br />
or, in the old currency with . which some of<br />
us are more familiar, .4s. a year. That is a<br />
shade . more . than the . price of a packet of<br />
cigarettes., That . figure works out at less<br />
than a quarter of Ic for each member of<br />
Parliament:, a year. I know that there are<br />
some cynics: in . the ' community who say<br />
that honourable members are not worth<br />
much. more than that. They can have that<br />
opinion' of us, but they can scarcely argue<br />
that. it is aheavy financial burden upon<br />
them. If. we . were to increase the size of<br />
the Parliament by thirteen . or fourteen<br />
members two years from now-<br />
Mr. Irwin-The cost would go up by one<br />
fag. Mr HAROLD HOLT-I hope that honourable<br />
members-would not go up in smoke. </p>
<p>The additional cost would only be of the<br />
order of 3c or 4c per head of population.<br />
Perhaps we have dealt somewhat flippantly<br />
with some of these arguments. Frankly, if<br />
they are examined carefully it is difficult to<br />
understand how a serious-minded body of<br />
men could argue them seriously. I say that<br />
it is not their purpose to do so. Their<br />
purpose is to create an atmosphere of<br />
prejudice and fear and to play up bogies<br />
which will frighten people into casting a<br />
No vote, because history has shown that the<br />
Australian electorate tends to say no when<br />
it is in the slightest doubt as to what should<br />
be done about a proposed change in the<br />
Constitution. I come to my final point. I have faith in<br />
the good sense and the' maturity of the<br />
Australian electorate. I am sure that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Country Party and the Acting Leader of<br />
the Country Party, who is with us tonight,<br />
think the same. I believe that we have an<br />
electorate which has increasingly demonstrated<br />
itself to have become much more<br />
mature on political issues. I believe the<br />
people will dismiss as a lot of fustian the<br />
sort of argument, based on prejudice and<br />
fear, with which their intelligences have<br />
been insulted by those who have put forward<br />
the No case. We on the Yes side have not<br />
tried to put forward a glamour case. We<br />
put calmly, temperately, moderately and<br />
logically the case that we see for a commonsense<br />
and practical parliamentary reform.<br />
Because I believe that the Australian electorate<br />
is sufficiently mature to weigh these<br />
considerations, I am confident of the outcome<br />
when the referendum vote is taken<br />
on this nexus proposal.<br />
