PRESS STATEMENT NO. 234<br />
24 April 1974<br />
REPORT OF THE COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO THE POST OFFICE AND<br />
APPOINTMENT OF A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO THE PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the Commission of<br />
Inquiry into the Australian Post Office had tendered its report<br />
to His Excellency the Governor-General last Friday. The<br />
Commission was appointed in February 1973 to report on what<br />
Changes should be made in the organisation, administration and<br />
operations of postal and telecommunications services.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the Government had accepted the Commission's<br />
recommendation that the Post Office should be independent of the<br />
control of the Public Service Board and that separate statutory<br />
corporations should be established to administer the postal and<br />
telecommunications services. Each corporation would have<br />
responsibility for organisation, staff, pay and the conditions<br />
of its employees. The Government had also accepted the<br />
recommeicle. tion of the majority of the Royal Commissioners that<br />
the new telecommunication corporation should incorporate the<br />
Overseas Telecommunication Commission.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the recommendation for separation of the<br />
Post Office from the Public Service Board confirmed the view<br />
of the Auttralian Labor Party. Mr. Whitlam recalled his<br />
statement in his 1972 policy speech: " Australia's largest<br />
employer the Post Office will be severed from the control<br />
of the Public Service Board."<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the report had been sent to the Government<br />
Printer and would be published as soon as possible. It was a<br />
document of some 600 pages, in two volumes. Mr. Whitlam said<br />
he wished to express to the Chairman of the Commission, Sir James<br />
Vernon, and his fellow Commissioners, Mr. B. J. Callinan,<br />
and Mr. J. J. Kennedy, the Government's<br />
appreciation of their work in undertaking this wideranging and<br />
important inquiry and carrying it through so expeditiously. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Prime Minister said that with the completion of the<br />
Post Office Inquiry, the Government was now ready to proceed<br />
with the proposal it had announced last December to establish<br />
a Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Public Service.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Public Service Commission of<br />
Inquiry would be commissioned immediately after the elections.<br />
He proposed that Dr H. C. Coombs should be Chairman of the<br />
Commission. Dr Coombs had indicated his readiness to undertake<br />
this task. Mr Whitlam said that there had not been a comprehensive<br />
inquiry into the Australian Public Service since 1920. There<br />
had been recent inquiries into the British Public Service by<br />
the Fulton Committee in 1968 and the Canadian Public Service<br />
by the Glassco Commission in 1962. Mr Whitlam said he had<br />
been informed that a Commission of Inquiry would be welcomed<br />
by all the Australian Public Service staff associations and<br />
trade unions. He had also been informed by the Public Service<br />
Board that it would welcome a Commission of Inquiry.<br />
Mr Whitlam reiterated the view expressed in his Garran<br />
Oration in November 1973 that the Australian Public Service<br />
commanded universal respect for its professionalism and<br />
impartiality. The Government's decision to establish this new<br />
Commission of Inquiry was evidence of its desire to continue<br />
the process of modernising the national public administration<br />
already begun with the reallocation of administrative functions<br />
and the variety of other initiatives taken by the Australian<br />
Government during the past 17 months. Work was continuing on<br />
the proposals for reorganisation of the Departments of Supply<br />
and Customs and Excise.<br />
