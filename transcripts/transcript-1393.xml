PRESS, RADIO AND TV INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT AT MASCOT<br />
AIRPORT, SYDNEY. ON HIS RETURN FROM THE<br />
PRIME MINISTERS' CONFERENCE. LONDON 19TH SEPTEM3ER. 1966<br />
Well, gentlemen, as you will have gathered from my comments<br />
in London, the conference I have just attended was a very remarkable<br />
one. I don't expect ever to attend another like it and certainly<br />
I have never attended one like it before. M11r. Wilson, when he was<br />
commenting on the conference said that it had come through the flames<br />
and -there had been a testing of the Commonwealth Association, but it<br />
had come through successfully, and I think that is a comment which<br />
can be made although it leaves many question marks about the future<br />
of Commonwealth Conferences in the years ahead.<br />
I think that we all felt that the solution which emerged<br />
after six iays of di.-1-ussion on Rhodesia was not entirely satisfactory<br />
to anybody, but it represented the highest common denominator<br />
of agreement which could be achieved, and the c,; mmunique put out<br />
on this subject indicated that there ., ere still some important<br />
differences of view amorgt members of the Commonwealth some feeling<br />
that force was the answer; others joining with Great Britain in<br />
believing that there should be an opportunity given to the Smith<br />
regime in Rhodesia to come to constructive and positive negotiation<br />
with the United Kingdom Government which would ensure that eventually<br />
majority rule would prevail in that country. The main points of<br />
difference here were that the Afro-Asian-Caribbean group, which<br />
developed the habit of meeting as a caucus in the course of the<br />
conference, wished to ensure that there was no grant of independence<br />
without majority rule ' being a condition of it. The United Kingdom,<br />
on the other hand was prepared to ne-gotiate on the basis that<br />
provide4 there was a guarantee of majority rule, there could be a<br />
gradual evolution to this result.<br />
The position now is that in the absence of some successful<br />
outcome from negotiations, there is likely to lae a move to the<br />
United Nations for selective sanctions, but Australia is in the<br />
position to determine its own course as these developments become<br />
known. The Rhodesian matter was of such burning interest to<br />
many of the heads of delegations that it occupied six of the eight<br />
days, and at one point, I felt it necessary to remind the conference<br />
that we had spent six days of our eight on the affairs of this<br />
particular country, and that nine-tenths of humankind who were much </p>
<p>-2<br />
affected by-ether aspects of our agenda had not been under<br />
discussion at all.<br />
We did turn, as a result of the move I made at that time to<br />
prevent further adjournment, to a consideration of the world<br />
political situation, but unfortunately the discussion of w,-, hat were,<br />
for us, tremendously important matters Viet Nam being perhaps the<br />
most important in Australian eyes this discussion was of a rather<br />
disjointed and perfunctory character because there would be adjournments<br />
while we had aspects of the Rhodesian matter draft<br />
communiques and matters of procedure broight back under our notice.<br />
Much the same applied in the case of the talk on the world<br />
economic situation. I was given the task of leading the discussion<br />
on this subject matter. It contained some elemonts of very great<br />
importance, not only to Australia, but to the world generally,<br />
including the pressing matter of international monetary liquidity.<br />
It remains a fact that reserves the world's reserves are not<br />
growing in proportion to world trade. Gold production, except in<br />
South Africa, is declining in the free world, and we are seeing<br />
symptoms of shortages of liquidity in various developments vfhch<br />
are now coming under notice. The fact that money is so scarce, that<br />
it is costing so much, that interest rates are becoming so high, the<br />
actions of the United Kingdom and the United States in restricting<br />
the movements of capital out of their countries by investors into<br />
other parts of the world, these are all symptomatic of a growing<br />
problem of international monetary liquidity.<br />
It has been relieved to a temporary degree by the swap<br />
arrangement which was entered into recently by the United Kingdom,<br />
but the problem remains.<br />
Now, there were a variety of other matters at the conference<br />
which did, I think, reflect a more hopeful aspect of this Commonwealth<br />
Association. There was remarkably little controversy on<br />
a number of matters of a fruitful kind, and these are reflected in<br />
the communique which was published at the end of the conference.<br />
This augurs quite well for the future in that there were so many<br />
matters on which a positive, constructive co-operation was manifest.<br />
But what marred the conference was the evidence of racial associations<br />
through this caucus system which, I believe, prevented a fair and<br />
objective study of the subject under review and could be quite<br />
4angerous and certainly distur-bing to many members of the Commonwealth<br />
if this were to become the practice at future conferences.<br />
The disproportionate time devoted to one subject matter was again<br />
a weakness. When all these things are taken together, the fact remains<br />
9 / 3 </p>
<p>-53-<br />
that the heads oS daeiegations of 22 countries in a multi-racial<br />
association, representative of all the principal racial groups,<br />
and a vast degree of different attitudes, habits of life, history,<br />
tradition, matters of that sort, were able to come together and<br />
reach an agreed document in respect of a most complex and explosive<br />
issue. It was a conference in which you had all the elements<br />
drama, tension, humour, frustration, exasperation and a variety of<br />
other factors, but out of it camne agreed communiques, first on the<br />
controversial issue of Rhodesia itself and the second covering a<br />
wide variety of matters dealt with at the conference.<br />
And so some will be able to claim with justification<br />
that the Commonwealth has come throug~ h a testing period with the<br />
prospect of going on to better wiork in the future. Others will<br />
argue that the price paid in the adoption of these undesirable<br />
techniques in the emergence on such a scale of racial attitudes, that<br />
these things are both harmful to the future of Commonwealth<br />
collaboration and create dangers of their own and perhaps arguaments<br />
of their owin for the future.<br />
In my judgment, we will need more than one conference<br />
before wve can come to a final judgment as to wihether this is a<br />
continuing contribution to the well-being of mankind. But my own<br />
tentative conclusion is that this does remain the best hope for<br />
mankind of a multi-racial association for construotive purposes,<br />
and like the United Nations itself, because the aspiration that<br />
it embodies is one of the highest that man could hold, we can't<br />
discard lightly the desirability of maintaining it in the future. </p>
