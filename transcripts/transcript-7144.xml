TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS, MOORABBIN -MELBOURNE,<br />
SUNDAY 29 MARCH 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what is the likelihood now of an early<br />
election following the Coalition decision to stay together?<br />
PM: I haven't got anything to add to what I said before<br />
about that. I have said all along my preference is that we<br />
go full term. I will have a look at the situation but I<br />
believe the Parliament will go the full term.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the fact that the Coalition has<br />
stayed together changes matters at all?<br />
PM: Stayed together? Haven't you read the weekend news?<br />
They are in total disarray. The most remarkable thing in<br />
Australian politics has happened this weekend. Remember what<br />
the story of the conservatives in the past has been that<br />
the Parliamentary Labor Party is not independent, it is<br />
controlled by faceless men outside. We have now got the<br />
position where the National Party is not only controlled by<br />
the people outside -they are telling it what it will do and<br />
when it will do it. But they have gone one step further now,<br />
they have put it my hands. They have left it to Bob Hawke<br />
to determine the future policy position of the National<br />
Party. They will withdraw from the Coalition when Bob Hawke<br />
makes up his mind about an early election. Now isn't that<br />
something? JOURNALIST: So Mr Hawke are you saying that May 9 won't be<br />
an early election?<br />
PM: I have never said it would be, so why should I say it is<br />
not. That is marvellous. Someone else creates a proposition<br />
and says it is going to be on May 9. And now I have got to<br />
say that what someone else has said is not going to happen.<br />
You will have to do better than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you say that it won't happen on May 9?<br />
PM: I never said it would happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: There has been a lot of speculation.<br />
PM: If I spent my time denying or indulging in comments upon<br />
the speculations of others I would never be able to get on<br />
with the business of running the country. And that is what<br />
we are doing. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Can you end speculationi that there will be an<br />
early election?<br />
PM: I can't stop people speculating. They have spent the<br />
whole weekend there at the Nationals' conference speculating<br />
and, as I say, putting the future of their party in my hands.<br />
I think that is fantastic. Feav" it to Bob~ Hawke to decide<br />
when the Nationals will pull out of the Coalition. Isn'* t<br />
that something? Marvellous.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about talk of the Party booking the Opera<br />
House? PM: I must say that came as a surprise to me. T honestly<br />
didn't know that they had done it. Butsil I suppose that<br />
is a conscientious secrotary looking after all possibilities.<br />
I didn't know it had been done.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think of Joh's push naow?<br />
PM: Joh's push, how do you spell that or<br />
p-u-s-h?<br />
JOURNALIST: P-u-s-h.<br />
PM: I think it is still there. And Mr Sinclair thinks it is<br />
still there. Did you look at Ian Sinclair and Ralph Hunt on<br />
the television while Joh was speaking. When Joh stood up and<br />
said " I bring you good news", he announced to the National<br />
Party, with his hands like the messiah, " I bring you good<br />
news, the Coalition is finished". And did you look at Mr<br />
Sinclair. Marvellous. They are a happy little bunch of<br />
pilgrims, aren't they?<br />
JOURNALIST: So has this weekend been a time to weigh pros<br />
and cons of an early election?<br />
PM: No. I went to the football and saw the Swans have a<br />
magnificent victory. I was doing things other than thinking<br />
about politics. Did you see them? Marvellous victory.<br />
JOURNALIST: So do you still hope to be the Prime Minister to<br />
take Australia into its bicentennial year?<br />
PM: Yes, I will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke. I understand there is a Government<br />
meeting in Canberra today finalising details of the<br />
mini-budget. Can you say what areas<br />
PM: That is absolutely wrong. Finalising the details?<br />
There is a meeting of the ERC, but that would be going on at<br />
any rate. They are meeting, they will be meeting for days<br />
and days. And I noticed amongst this early talk of<br />
speculation that I had summoned a full meeting of the<br />
Ministry to discuss the early election. That meeting of the<br />
Ministry was called some time ago and for other matters. And<br />
I saw one fervid piece of speculation that I had told them<br />
all to turn up in dark suits to look serious and responsible.<br />
if I had told them all to turn up in dark suits you know what </p>
<p>Bill would do my mate Bill Hayden. He would deliberately<br />
come along in that beautiful yellow checked suit of his.<br />
People are letting their imaginations run a bit wild. It is<br />
a normal meeting to call the full Ministry together to<br />
consider other matters. I don't think they will all be in<br />
dark suits. Some of them might even come in open-necked<br />
shirts. ENDS _ I </p>
