* PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DEUVERr*<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF COLIN LANCELEY EXHIBITION, SHERMAN GALLERIES,<br />
SYDNEY, FRIDAY, 27 AUGUST 1993<br />
Colin and Kay Lanceley, Gene Sherman and William Wright, ladies and<br />
gentlemen I'm very pleased to be here this evening to open this exhibition of Colin<br />
Lanceley's recent work.<br />
I wanted to make time for this event among the post-Budget feeding frenzy<br />
because I like Colin Lanceley's vision and ideas. I also like his paintings.<br />
I mean, how could you not like someone who says that great art looks as if it was<br />
breathed onto the surface by angels?<br />
It's always tempting for politicians to try and draw analogies between what they<br />
do and what is done by the people we talk about in our speeches. Real people<br />
like painters, and opera singers.<br />
Some of you may remember a previous instance when I did this, and the<br />
interesting events that followed.<br />
So rather tonight I'll content myself with saying, quite seriously, that I think I<br />
know what Colin means when he says that in trying to come to terms with<br />
Australia, you've got to try and put it together in some meaningful way, so that if<br />
it's real it will live in the imagination afterwards.<br />
I have to say that I find the way he puts it irresistible: he says, " Ve need to<br />
develop a profound understanding of our place and to shape it with what is our<br />
finest sensibility. I think we've got to create the kind of place where we get<br />
echoes all the time, and resonances. In a soulless environment where we<br />
aren't able to have those resonances our culture won't develop, and we'll<br />
become a satellite."<br />
Dare I say it-sonds-a-bit like-Manring Ctark. whose great achievement was to<br />
imagine Australia what it was and what it might become. And he did it so well<br />
he helped us all do it.<br />
It is not Manning Clark's politics which some conservative Australians object too.<br />
His politics were hardly radical. And it's not the way he wrote history the way is<br />
always open to anyone who wants to write it better.<br />

What they fear is his imagination, and imagination like a sense of humour is a<br />
terrible threat to people without one. When it is coupled with a massive<br />
achievement and imagination becomes a source of envy as well as fear.<br />
Which is why I suppose Manning Clark will always be under attack: Why the<br />
arts will always be a bitchy place: And why the conservative parties in Australia<br />
will never support the arts as the arts should be supported.<br />
The Australia that Colin Lanceley returned to after eighteen years away was very<br />
different from the Australia that he left in the 1960s.<br />
I know that in those days many creative people felt the need to leave what they<br />
considered to be a stultifyingly conformist society.<br />
It was an era when the arts were treated by politicians if they considered them<br />
at all as at best a subject of bemnusement, and at worst a matter for suspicion<br />
and hostility.<br />
I know too that the situation has changed from those days, but not changed<br />
enough.<br />

ey -And we'll get there, with help from people like Colin Lanceley.<br />
.) le -As I've said before, my view of the arts is a simple one. I believe that when the<br />
arts flourish we flourish with them.<br />
They are a measure of our identity and our guiding force. In an ever changing<br />
multicultural Australia, the arts are out there at the front, leading and defining.<br />
The arts project to the world the truth about Australia in a way that no-one or<br />
3t if nothing else can.<br />
They show, as I'm sure Colin would agree, that we are a people able to imagine<br />
what we might be.<br />
ur Able to imagine our future in the region and the world.<br />
A creative people, able to make things which the world wants.<br />
And a people prepared to lead rather than willing to follow.<br />
el I know that most Australians are enormously proud of our artistic achievements.<br />
Too often I think we project ourselves as a pretty unsophisticated bunch without<br />
too. much care for the life of the mind.<br />
ly is Yet the achievements are there daily in writing, painting, dance, film, music,<br />
theatre. And I have no doubt that Australians are very proud of their artistic<br />
achievements. 1339 </p>
<p>It is my belief that we should be doing more for our artists, and for those who will And<br />
follow them. imm<br />
And we intend to.<br />
That's why we are working towards putting into place a national cultural strategy. RPereaf<br />
Bob McMullan, as some of you may be aware, is currently engaged in a wide Bec<br />
consultation process around Australia. In fact, today he has been here in doin<br />
Sydney at an Evatt Foundation forum on cultural policy in Australia appropriately expt<br />
entitled, " From Fossils to Films". supr<br />
Which gives you an idea of the size of the task. And'<br />

Government in relation to our cultural life and heritage. From this the Allo<br />
Government intends to develop a cultural map to guide us into the next century. thin<br />
It's an ambitious enterprise, and one that hasn't been attempted before. And itsper<br />
will be of great benefit to us all. The<br />
But we haven't just pulled up the drawbridge while we wait for this to happen. Nothat<br />
In the Budget last week we delivered a 12 per cent increase in arts funding. to a<br />
It's perhaps hard to believe, but some people have viewed this with alarm. You<br />
One commentator in the Sunday papers last weekend suggested that " thethan<br />
electorate can look forward to an explosion of Balmain basket weaving" which So i<br />
to say the least, showed scant regard for intellectual copyright. abot<br />
I don't subscribe to this notion that, unlike every other human activity from I wo:<br />

confuses excellence in the arts with exclusivity in the arts.<br />
I believe that the approach we developed in the Budget was a sound one. One wIt'istht<br />
which was economically responsible, practical and efficient in its delivery.<br />
An approach which not only provided direct Government assistance for artists. Colir<br />

habit of providing patronage at least not on the broad and imaginative scale And<br />
that it is done in many other countries.<br />
Artists should be rewarded in ways that are commensurate with the rewards they LaaMdLi<br />
bring Australia. I look forward to the day when more Austraiian companies come<br />
to the realisation that by helping Australian artists they are uitimnately helping Thar<br />
themselves. 1340 </p>
<p>4<br />
And I hope this day comes soon, because the arts are in need of more<br />
immediate assistance than the Government is able to provide. Furthermore I<br />
suspect that this will always be the case.<br />
Real artists, I'm inclined to think, don't choose to be artists. As Colin says in the<br />
Preface from which I've already quoted, painting is compulsive.<br />
Because they reward artists of excellence like Colin who really shouldn't be<br />
doing anything else and give them the kind of mid-career support they need to<br />
expand their horizons and go on to better things, I've always been a strong<br />
supporter of the Australia Council's Creative Fellowships.<br />
And that's the other reason that I was delighted to come and open this exhibition<br />
today. It's a tangible expression of the results of the Creative Fellowship<br />
scheme. All of these works were created while Colin has been on his fellowship, and I<br />
think that no-one could deny that this has been Commonwealth money well<br />
spent. The more observant among you will have noticed that this is the first reference<br />
that I have made tonight to the works that actually comprise the exhibition.<br />
Now it's no secret, I'm sure, that hitherto my attention has been primarily directed<br />
to a different school from that of the Australian Modernists.<br />
You will also probably not be astounded to hear that I have a somewhat less<br />
than nodding acquaintance with the Annandale Imitation Realists.<br />
So in these circumstances you will undoubtedly all be relieved that I am not<br />
about to embark on a detailed critique of the exhibition.<br />
I would however, make the observation, that even with a limited understanding<br />
there is a real spirit in these works that no one can fail to appreciate, and there<br />
is a real feel of Australianness about them.<br />
It's hard to put my finger on why this is so, but I suspect that it has a lot to do<br />
with the colours.<br />
Colin Lanceley clearly is a great colourist.<br />
As Robert Hughes says, his paintings " record a rapturous sensitivity of response<br />
to the light of high summer, to the weird buzz in the bush... There are no artists<br />
of Lanceley's generation to whom the diction of colour seems to come so<br />
naturally." And none whose work I would think it a greater privilege to open.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a sincere pleasure to open this exhibition. I hope that<br />
a multitude of people have the opportunity to see it.<br />
Thank you. 13411 </p>
