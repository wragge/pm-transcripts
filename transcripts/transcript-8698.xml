    <content><![CDATA[<p>RIME MINISTER<br />TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIMIE MNISTE~ R,[' HE HON PJ KEATING NIP,<br />NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS FORUM, Q&amp; A SESSION,<br />RAMADA RENAISSANCE HOTEL, SYDNEY, 19 ocToIIER 1992<br />E OE PROOF COPY<br />0: Industrial relations and cntcrprise agrcmlents; regulation of business at national,<br />state and local level.<br />PM: I'll just take up your first point about allowing employees to negotiate. Three<br />weeks ago I was in Japan and went to the Toyota plant where they produce in one<br />factory 300,000 vehicles a year and every day, every niorniing the plant manager<br />and the sub-plants managers meet with their employees to discuss thc days work,<br />the week's work, to see how the business operates. The emphasis is on common<br />goals and harmony and being part of the one thing which I think is part of the<br />success of the productivity of those particular plants and the innovation in the way<br />in which thcy produce things, because a lot of the innovations conie from the<br />ernployccs. Nowhere in that Structure do you see any sense of fracture, where one<br />employee on the line is negotiating with the company different to the one next<br />door to him or her. They negotiate as a group and therefore they take group<br />responsibility and pressure within the group produces an emphasis on cooperation<br />and working together and getting a better result. I think that is what I'd<br />say about the so called notion, it sounds well and good to say Ict all employees<br />negotiate, hut we and the organised workforce know that when one employee is<br />forced to negotiate by his or her self with a company, be it small or large, their<br />ncgotiating position is vcry weak. And whereas if they are allowed to negotiate as<br />a group, their negotiation position is better. The sign of the maturity of our<br />workforce is that when the wage share in the economy had to decline in the 1980S<br />in favour of profits for higher investment and employment, it did doclinc. And<br />that the whole emphasis on training, enterprise bargaining and productivity, a large<br />part of the impetus for that has comec from the trade unions themselves.<br />No system is perfect and there will always be problems within any set of<br />arrangements, particularly one built on the multiplicity of craft structures which<br />welye had in Australia, which we inherited from Britain so long ago. But it seems<br />to mc that all the flexibility which companies today wish to enjoy in industrial</p>
<p>organisation, be it in terms of rates of pay, or penalty rates or hours worked during<br />a day or week are now, by virtuc of all the agreements we've constructed in the last<br />six to twelve months, capable of being resolved in favour of higher productivity<br />and lower costs, and 1 don't see that co-operation being sustainable in a process<br />where awards expire and where you see a fracturing amongst employees. All the<br />flexibility which is required now in industry can come undcr S. 137 agreements<br />and the like, the only flexibility that there isn't in there is flexibility downwards.<br />There's flexibility up, flexibility laterally, flexibility diagonally, but there's no<br />flexibility down) the system is not geared to cut remuneration and, in the end, all<br />of this talk about dealing with employees, letting people speak for themselves, is<br />really about cutting their pay. That's what it will be seen to be and the bonhomie<br />will cease the moment the activity starts, and the moment that happens thc great<br />leap forward to be. made in productive co-operation and emphasis on productivity<br />and training and lower costs and sharing the benefits of bctter product, higher<br />product will evaporate. That's why the Liberal Party is quite wrong about this; Mr<br />Howard is going to announce a policy along these lines tomorrow they are quite<br />wrong about this, and it's we who have had to take Australia from the industrial<br />museum of the late 1970s and early 1990s with 300 unions, a craft structure of<br />organisation, and evolve it in a revolutionary way to a modern system which is<br />more enterprise specific, more industry specific. and where you are getting<br />without any loss of time with industrial disputation, without major mayhem along<br />the way a very large and important cultural change. And I say it's happened<br />because a Labor Government and the tr-dc union,; have qat down with business<br />and decided to make the country better and stronger by adopting a co-operative<br />effort. Going back to that ' them and us', managers versus employees, pushing<br />peoplc onto common law contracts and asking some poor l ittle character on<br />$ 16,000 a year to go and represent himself with a OC in the Supreme Court, is not<br />going to help anybody. The Liberal Party have already ignited a wage fire oncc or<br />twice in 1979-80 with wages growth of 16 per cent. We've got now average<br />weekly earning growth of three. John Howard is desperate to return to the scene of<br />the crime and get out and do it twice. We say ' pigs' to that and it's a rotten policy.<br />On the question of regulation, could I just say this: I share your view and the view<br />of everyone around here that regulation, that the Federal system of six States and<br />the Commonwealth and Territories has been a problem for the national co-<br />. ordination of business regulation -and by moving to a system of uniform standards,<br />and now having a structure under the Council Of Australian Governments; where<br />we have a meeting with the states which is not a financial meeting but a meeting<br />about issues and the micro-economy such as this, that we can resolve some of<br />these issues and already some have been resolved and we'llI he able to do more. So<br />rather than giving you a commitment, that yes we'll have it on the next meeting<br />agenda, I'm certainly quite happy to give you a commitment that we will keep this<br />matter very much under review, it's very much under notice, and wherever we can<br />advance the notion of a national basis of regulation, wherever we can remove the<br />multiplicity of a State base of regulation, we'll do it and do it with might and main,<br />because it is through no fault of anybody, just a nation of seven different</p>
<p>governments over the years, working on all these various issues has produced a<br />desperate result which is no good to any of us. We are very aware of it will<br />continue to keep our eye firmly fixed on improving the situation.<br />Q: GST and Wholesale Sales Tax.<br />PM: Well could I say that I think the wholesale sales tax is being very<br />substantially maligned. It is not a perfect tax, but again it has a lot of<br />benefits, one is it adds 20,000 taxingpoints not 700,000 taxing points. One<br />is that you can have dissipate rates of tax, so you can tax things lightly if<br />you wish or heavily if you wish. You have a discretion, luxuries are taxed<br />heavily, other items are taxed more lightly. It raises $ 9 billion and therefore<br />has nothing like the sort of macro economic influences that a tax that raises<br />$ 27 billion has. But let me just go and tell you, you mightn't get this<br />numbers in the public debate, but let me tell you because they are correct,<br />but this is how the GST breaks down. The GST raises $ 27 billion, it costs<br />$ 9 billion to abolish the wholesale sales tax, that leaves $ 18 billion. It costs<br />$ 7 billion to remove pay-roll tax, that leaves $ 11 billion. It costs $ 6 million<br />to diminish the tax on excise, that leaves $ 5 billion, and the package for<br />compensation of social security beneficiaries, it wouldn't need to be<br />compensated without the GST, it costs $ 4 billion. So there is $ 1 billion left<br />for the tax payers, $ 1 billion, and the tax cuts are going to cost John Hewson<br />$ 13 billion, of which he has $ 1 billion from the GST to pay for it. Now he<br />has got to pay that $ 13 billion, which of course is nothing like<br />compensation, even if it were paid, from a package which the Department of<br />Finance says is $ 6 billion short of its savings, but even if it were intact it<br />requires a $ 10 to $ 12 billion cut in Government spending, and where is that<br />going to be cut obviously in education, social security and the like? So, the<br />social upheaval which would follow that kind of change is going to be quite<br />profound. So, that's why nobody is going to be paying $ 27 billion and<br />getting back less then full compensation and not making wage claims. So if<br />you believe that you don't think the inflationary effects are there, I can only<br />say to you that the Liberal parties modeller, Dr Murphy, in the wages up<br />case, that is, in the flow on to wages thinks inflation would be 10 per cent<br />and the Treasury thinks it would be 12. Well even if you put a discount<br />through those numbers, even if you called it eight, I mean the vandalism of<br />taking Australian inflation from 2 per cent to 8 per cent is profound, to<br />what, get a tax switch from income to expenditure? And of course in that<br />services will be taxed and a lot of the expansion of small business in a<br />service sector of the economy, which is now not taxed. So it will be taxed<br />and the one great employing possibility we have, where we have got very<br />high levels of labour, is in tourism because you can't get a machine to make<br />it better, or a machine to clean up the bathroom, or a machine to serve a<br />meal, and that industry which has been growing inordinately strongly over<br />the ' 80s and will continue in the ' 90s, will carry a 15 per cent flat tax upon<br />its whole service base. So, I think the GST is an entirely dud idea, as I said<br />it is a tenth order issue in an economy where we are seeing a fast cultural<br />change to an export basis where we are now exporting nearly 23 per cent of<br />everything we produce, nearly a quarter of all we produce, where we have<br />seen a huge shift in exports, where we have seen now a large shift in<br />productivity and now much more innovative things happening in other<br />enterprise agreements, a whole cooperative basis of organisation occurring,<br />it is just not worth it to put that a risk i. my view for a tax on expenditure</p>
<p>verses a tax on income when the income tax now working very tightly. We<br />have got now one of the most tight, direct tax systems in the world by virtue<br />of the changes in the 1980' s' and I don't think it is worth the risk. On the<br />qucstion of-sales tax and remittances, again, this is an issue in tax design<br />and costs, and I suppose every Government would like to say, wve will see<br />nobody out of pocket before remittances, but I think this is again just simply<br />whether or not we can afford it, and whenever it has been proposed to us to<br />change the timings or remittances we have not been ablc to do that. 1 think<br />this matter came tip at our last round, hut for the same reason we wercn't<br />able to do anything for you.<br />Q: Impediments to small business; payments of Provisional Tax<br />PM; Well, Paul, on the last element of the question first, I wouldn't wat to<br />commit the Government to an inquiry on the matter but I am quite happy to<br />look at the issue. We have asked the industry Commission, under a number<br />of references, to look at impediments to certain sectors of activity in the<br />economy, and if you think that something caii be &amp; ained by an examination<br />of impediments to small business employ mcnt activity then we can certainly<br />consider looking at that, how best it ought to he looked and who by is<br />another issue, but we have the Industry Commission for such kinds of<br />references and it might he that it is something wc can think about. Anyway<br />I am certainly prepared to talk to you about it, and to David of course.<br />On the other question, look, this is a vexed question, I don't know whether I<br />can be profouind about it, Paul, that is in relation to provisional tax payers<br />and comnpanies, there is always this question about incorporation and the<br />costs and benefits, there were always substantial costs for being<br />incorprated until we introduced dividend imputation, because if you were a<br />single tax payer you were taxed once, if you were a single enterprise you<br />were taxed once, if you were a partnership you were taxed once, if you were<br />a trust you were taxed once, but if you were a company you taxed twice, and<br />I never saw the sense of that and we took that away in 1986, so that now<br />whenever cornp any tax is paid there is virtually a tax credit there against<br />personal tax. so, trying to get an equation between the tax treatment of<br />those incorporated and those not has always been difficult to do, you have<br />got two yard sticks in this, the individuals pay PAYE as you earn taxation,<br />whethcr they earn their income, those who are provisionally taxed enjoy at<br />least some concessions against the~ PAYE tax-. payer, whereas the company<br />pays later and enjoys, in your terms,' a $ r eater concession against those who<br />are uncorporated Again, thcse are timing in revenue questions involved,<br />we can always make this position more concessionary, I don't think I can be<br />any more enlightening for you then I was with the previous question, I just<br />don't know to what extent we are able to change the tax timing of<br />provisional tax payments so as to produce a ef-oser relativity to those who<br />ae incoprated on the tax payments treatment, those who are incorporated,<br />David menioned to me about these closed corp oration issue, which may<br />provide some opportunity, that is a structure which provides some<br />opportunity for a better equation, between those categories of individuals<br />and companies, I am not sure about that because I don't know enough about<br />it. But I am happy to look at that for David.<br />ENDS</p>
