    <content><![CDATA[<p>I totally reject the NSW Premier's transparent attempt today to offload any blame for rising crime and heroin abuse in NSW onto the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Budget cuts have not restricted the capacity of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to fight the drug problem.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of Federal law enforcement agencies is increasingly being enhanced by the Federal Government's policy that agencies adopt a more co-operative and strategic focus in the management of law enforcement resources.</p>
<p>In particular, AFP and the Australian Customs Service, in 1997 alone, have seized 51 kilograms of cocaine, 220 kilograms of heroin, and 55 kilograms of amphetamines.</p>
<p>The AFP has arrested and charged over 140 people with more than 240 drug related offences during 1997.</p>
<p>Mr Carr's claims completely distort the reality of modern policing where Australia's Federal forces co-operate with international authorities to effect drug detection and seizures around the globe.</p>
<p>The national problem of illicit drugs is currently under review by a Federal Task force which is examining both supply and demand issues and is due to report soon.</p>
<p>The Australian Customs Service has reshaped its drug intelligence capability and is now working more closely and productively with other Commonwealth and State agencies.</p>
<p>More than $26 million was allocated in the 1996-97 Budget to purchase the latest in detection technology in the fight against drugs .</p>
<p>Instead of seeking to make cheap political points, the NSW Premier should co-operate with the Federal Government in seeking solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>23 September 1997</p>
