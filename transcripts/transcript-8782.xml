TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, WEST TORRENS COUNCIL HALL, ADELAIDE<br />
22 DECEMIBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I might just say a few things first and just get things started. I noticed the<br />
Coalition's Fightback, or ' crawiback', policy is starting to unravel and most<br />
particularly with the Opposition spokesman on communications, Mr Warwick<br />
Smith, saying that timed calls are an option. He is not used to precise political<br />
speak, MT Smith, so he has for the Liberal Party uncharacteristic candour<br />
indicated that with a private owner of Telecom, that John Hewson would very<br />
quickly be ablc to establish what is, in all practical terms, a telephone tax just<br />
as he ceascd to tax all other things, goods and services as well. And I notice<br />
thc Liberals arc now saying oh well, no, this is not what we have in mind<br />
but one Telecom is in thc hands of a private owner, it is a matter of what they<br />
have in mind. And there is no way private owners are going to be paying<br />
billion for Telecom to have it commercially constrained in a way where it can't<br />
secure what they would think are appropriate tariffs for its services. And most<br />
privatcly operated telephonc companics in the world charge for timed calls.<br />
They charge by the second. And this would happen with a privatiscd Telecom<br />
as well. But in the unravelling, there are quite a lot of people who come out<br />
now saying that a lcading stockbroking firm has told the Opposition it can't<br />
possibly raise $ 20 billion it nccds to fund its package. Telccom, ffhcrc is no one<br />
in their financial markets bar a few people with a Liberal Party ticket burning<br />
in their pocket who believes that a float of $ 20 billion is possiblc. Which<br />
mcans that the basic key funding point, the key underlying funding of Dr<br />
Hewson's package is starting to evaporate.<br />
As well as that, there has been a number of attacks upon Fighitback Mark 11.<br />
Mr Ian Baldock, the Exccutivc Director of the Queensland Retail Tradcrs and<br />
Shopkeepers Association, asked this morning, he said, how arc small<br />
businesses, supermarkets, corner stores going to differentiate between food<br />
which is GST exempt and that which carries the GST? Remember this, with<br />
the consumption tax, there are 750,000 taxing points only one-tenith of that<br />
with a wholesale sales tax, less than about 40,000. 40,000 with a wholesale<br />
sales tax, 750,000 taxing points with the OST, and that will mean every small<br />
business in the country. And every small retail business will then have to<br />
distinguish betwecn basic food and all other items. So that it is not even a </p>

2<br />
simple system to oper~ ate, and the retail traders today are saying it will be an<br />
administrative nightmare for every corner store, supermarket which becomes a<br />
tax point for Dr Hewson. And then we have got the Building Owners and<br />
Managers Association ( BOMA) a very powerful business lobby in this country<br />
asking correctly why is the construction industry being dealt out of the game<br />
by Dr Hewson? Fightback Mark 11, they say, will mean net increases in costs<br />
bctween 4 and 10 per cent plus the one-off inflationary impact to major<br />
building and construction. And hie has told thcm basically to go jump. In State<br />
services, we had the Queensland Treasurer today saying Fightback equals<br />
cutbacks, and he is dead right. Let me say here, that States like South Australia<br />
will lose hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of jobs under<br />
Fightback. Because he has cuts for the Statcs, very large cuts in government<br />
spending for the States. Now in South Australia, a large part of the South<br />
Australian economy runs on government funding, government expenditure,<br />
govermecnt programs. And when you have got a government in Canberra,<br />
wants to bc a goverment in Canberra, saying that they think we ought to have<br />
a smaller public sector, there ought to be cuts in payments to the States, this<br />
will react on South Australia. But of course, the part of their policy which is<br />
going to react on South Australia more is zero tariffs. As I said yesterday, zero<br />
tariffs in political terms to the Liberal Party mcans zero Adelaide. They would<br />
start carving into the basic fabric of Australian manufacturing industry in South<br />
Australia with a policy which is ideologically driven for which thcy did not<br />
vary one jot in Fightback Mark Il.<br />
So let me conclude on these points. Fightback Mark 11 is funded by the<br />
improbable sale of $ 20 billion of assets, Telecom, to the Australian financial<br />
markets. T7hey can't digest it, therefore the funding package is unreal. The<br />
capital raisings of this year werc $ 12 billion with the private sector. Dr I-cwson<br />
says he wants to induce a private sector investment recovery, but he wants to<br />
crowd out private sector recovery by raising over two years, $ 20 billion for<br />
Telecom, for one public instrumentality alone. In other words, at $ 10 billion<br />
each for two years, he will take up prctty well all of the funding the Australian<br />
capital markets can provide. And becausc that is improbable and unlikely, his<br />
whole funding package falls down and this is where the scrutiny of the package<br />
needs to be focussed. On thc fact that he reserves the right, unlike the<br />
Goverrnent, to introduce unfunded packages, packages which are improbable<br />
and unreal and irresponsible, and it is all to be regarded as sort of slick political<br />
trickery. The fact of thc matter is the markets would kick any govcrnmnent to<br />
pieces trying to fund a package of this size. The alternative would be to drop all<br />
the promises, or alternatively to blow the budget dcficit out. Now these are the<br />
options which we have in the sort of one and a half week revamp of Fightback<br />
which we have seen from Dr Hcwson. His package is unravelling. The markets<br />
say it can't be funded. The Building and Owner Managers Assosiation saying,<br />
What's Wrong with the construction Industry, it is a major generator of jobs, why<br />
do that? Warwick Smith, the Communications spokesman, is saying that timed<br />
telephone calls are an option. The Shopkeepers Association are saying the GST<br />
will be too complex to manage. All in all you can see thc weight is now coming<br />
back on Dr Hcwson's Proposal, as it should because Australia needs a<br />
consumption tax like it needs a hole in the head. And trying to fund these<br />
proposals with an improbable sale of $ 20 billion of public assets will only lead<br />

to the destruction of fiscal policy which has taken this Government ten years to<br />
put into place.<br />
I Mr Keating, couldn't there be offsets for timed telephone calls?<br />
PM: Look, if you sell Teleconm to private owners, they are going to make the<br />
business run commcrcially. And nobody is going to buy the thing on the basis<br />
that suburban or city calls or country long distance calls are not appropriately<br />
priced and charged. Now the whole idea of the cross subsidies that's inherent<br />
in the currcnt Telecom structure will go out the window. It will be just a*<br />
business. And the Liberals know that, and that's why I think Mr Smith today<br />
dropped his guard and said yes, it is an option. well of course it is an option.<br />
J: How much do you think Teleconm is worth?<br />
PM: Well we are not selling it. We constructed a competitive model. We had<br />
Telecom which absorbed OTC and we have given OPTUS a competitor of a<br />
mode of companics of international competency the right to run a trunk<br />
network in opposition to Telecom and to run an international network as well.<br />
in othcr words, wc have a cornpctitivc model in place. mean, Tclecom works<br />
for Australia, what is the point of selling it? So the Labor Party is not<br />
interestcd in selling Telecom.<br />
J: But giving their estimate, what do you think in dollar terms?<br />
PM: We have not done a close estimate of the value of Telecom. The simple point<br />
Is, the Australian financial market was flat out digesting the Wcstpac float and<br />
even that couldn't be placed, that was sitting in the hands of the underwriters,<br />
CS First Boston, for months. It was only when Packer came along that Some of<br />
that stock was actually moved out of the underwriters' hands. The underwriters<br />
couldn't place it. And that is why Woolworths pulled out because the market is<br />
getting choked with issues as we are rebalancing thc debt to equity ratios in this<br />
country, as wc arc displacing debt for equity. Now to come along with a<br />
choker like $ 10 billion a year and say, look hang on all get out the road here<br />
comes the government here is a $ 10 billion a year float for Telecom. They will<br />
be told by every underwriter in Australia, this can't bc done. So the whole<br />
basis of thc funding falls to bits. I said these things last Friday, you know,<br />
some sections of the media regard that as just political comment. The fact is,<br />
go and ask underwriters of substance what they think about floats of<br />
billion a year.<br />
J: Won't the question of timed locail calls, won't people accept Warwick Smith's<br />
assurance that there won't be forced timied local calls?<br />
P M. His assurance can't miea n anything. It might mean something while Telecom is<br />
owned by the Govcrnment. But it can mean nothing whci Telecom is owned<br />
by a private owner. I mean, is any private owner going to bid $ 20 billion for<br />
Telecom and have its hands tied about its charging regime? Of course not, its<br />
rubbish. </p>

J: Prime Miiaiter, how difficult is it going to be to sell your cnvironment package<br />
if you have only got lukc warm response from the environment movement?<br />
PM: The environment movemcnt is basically not interested in ' brown' isues. They<br />
arc not interested in dirty water. They are not interested in salinity. They are<br />
not interested in soil degrcdation. They are interested in trees. The Wilderness<br />
Society is interested in trccs._ The ACF is interested in trees. But thc rest of the<br />
community is interested in the range of issucs. The environment lobbies have<br />
110 moal lien over the environment. This issue belongs to the nation, it<br />
belongs to the government, to the nation. We don't have to have the<br />
approbation of these groups because thcy arc not listened to much anymore.<br />
Bob Brown and people like that say the same thing no matter what a<br />
government does. This is a major program to restore the health of one of the<br />
primary river systems in Australia, the Murray Darling, on which the city of<br />
Adelaide depends for its water amongst many other users to deal with the cold<br />
question of dry land salinity and salt moving through the whole catchment<br />
area, taking phosphorus out of the water. These are important national issues.<br />
But the greens say, well unless you arc rcscrv-ing another stand of trees it<br />
doesn't matter. So all of thesc issues, feral animals the destruction which is<br />
done to the Australian fauna by cats and pigs, particularly to flora by feral pigs,<br />
is profound. It can't be handled on a State by State basis, it is a national<br />
problcm, we are dealing with that. We are dealing with one of thc great<br />
heritage areas of the world, Kakadu, which is now being threatencd Mimosa<br />
pigra. We have a study going on for thc last large great area of thc East coast<br />
of Australia still in virgin state, Shoalwater Bay. Now that is why the<br />
Government's record on the cnvironment, and its initiatives on the<br />
environment, frankly take weight in precedcnce over the claims of<br />
environmental groups.<br />
J: Does that mean you won't be depending on their Preferences at the next Federal<br />
election?<br />
PM: flow can they vote for the Liberal Party? The Liberal Party would mine the<br />
Botanic Gardens in Adelaide here. The problem in Australia is, a lot of the<br />
grccnics would like a rainforest in Pitt Street in Sydney and down Rundle Mall<br />
in Adelaide while the Liberal Party would go and mine the Botanic Gardens in<br />
Adelaidc and Hyde Park in Sydney. Those extremes nobody wants. It is a<br />
sensible majority of people who want a good result on the environincnt think<br />
that inatters. So whcrc are the greenies going to go, are they going to go and<br />
vote ( or the Liberal Party? Are they really going to go and votc for this crowd<br />
who want to get back into uranium enrichment, who want to open up more<br />
uranium mnines, who want to basically let the economic imperative be the sole<br />
Imperative? I mean this is a good Statement and the public will recognise it is<br />
a good Statement and the great pity is that people in the ACF and others don't<br />
have the courage ard the leadership to say what they say to us privately about<br />
it. I mean the trouble with the green groups now arc they are all watching each<br />
other to say thcy say the samne thing. No one will be radical, no one will jump<br />
out of the pack and say where they think the agenda ought to go or what they<br />
should believe, We don't havc any leaders in the environment movement<br />

anymore. Wc have just got people who arc basically matching press release for<br />
press release, and this is a grcat problem.<br />
J: Will the Fcdcral Government provide the $ 23 million called on by the State<br />
Government here in South Australia for rural relief?<br />
PM: There are long standing arrangements. Thierc are standing permanent<br />
arrangements for drought and flood relief betwveen the Commonwealth and the<br />
Statcs and they are there bccausc we have lots of droughts and lots of floods<br />
and this is a real problem for the South Australian community and fortunately<br />
those arrangements are in placc for the Commonwealth and the States to deal<br />
with it and then beyond a certain levcl of costs the Commonwealth takes 100U<br />
per cent responsibility for it.<br />
J So that request went there yesterday, did you see that coming through?<br />
PM: Well they were not requests, it has to be a declaration about the flood, But<br />
once it is declared, it is just a mechanical set of arrangements in place.<br />
