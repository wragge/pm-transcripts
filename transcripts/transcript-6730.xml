J!, AUS R LIA IPRIME<br />
MINISTER<br />
PRIM'E MINISTER ON l1A 13UT' 1' IKSE ZKY 20 September 1985e11<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
BUTTROSE: Everyone in Australia knows that reform of the tax<br />
system was necessary. And the previous Governments have ducked<br />
and dodged the issue for years. So, no-one in Australia<br />
can deny that the tax system needed reform and I believe the<br />
Government is to be congratulated for having the guts to bring<br />
about the reforms. The Prime Minister has been giving interviews<br />
almost non-stop since Treasurer Keating delivered the tax<br />
reforms to the Parliament. He even survived interviews with<br />
the brothers Willesee on their respective current affairs showsno<br />
mean feat. This morning the Prime Minister will be happy<br />
to answer your calls on this program and I have the Prime<br />
Minister on the line now. Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning, Ita, how are you.<br />
BUTTROSE: Well thank you. How are you, a little more to the<br />
point, you've been a busy mnan. You've been giving interviews<br />
all over Australia I wondered what the reaction is to the<br />
Government's new tax reform.<br />
PM: Generally favourable Ita. It's as to be expected, there's<br />
some Indication of a little bit of a whinge here and there, but<br />
overall favourable.<br />
BUTTROSE: On television last night a small whinge -you seemed<br />
a little touchy on the issue of capital gains tax. During the<br />
1983 election campaign, as you explained, you said that you said<br />
there would be no capital gains tax In the life of that Parliament<br />
and you did, indeed, keep that promise. Then last year during<br />
the election campaign you said there would be a review of the<br />
tax system and you didn't rule out a capital gains tax. So you<br />
certainly haven't misled, the people. However, it did appear that<br />
you are somewhat sensitive to some criticisms of that tax.<br />
PM;. I wasn't sensitive to criticism I was just a bit annoyed<br />
at the silliness of my old mate, Mike, who at the end accepted that<br />
held got it a bit cocked up and we went on. I mean it was quite<br />
clear that he was not misrepresenting, I don't put it that waybut<br />
he was saying something that was relevant if I'd brought in<br />
the capital gains tax in the first Government by showing the ' 83<br />
clip. But as I pointed out to him, there had been an election in </p>
<p>HAWKE cont.: between in ' 84 when I said it's now on the table.<br />
But I think if I can go to the question about capital gains, Ita,<br />
the important point is this that I think we've met the<br />
understandable concerns of a number of people. The family home<br />
is not in, it doesn't apply to existing assets and it's only<br />
for real gains and importantly deeming at death is out. SoV<br />
there's no death duty element of it.. Now I think that people<br />
understand that it's necessary to have a capital gains tax<br />
provision there to stop tax avoidance. That's why it's there<br />
and I think the great majority of people will say well that's<br />
a sensible thing to do.<br />
BUTTROSE: I can't help but think Prime Minister that a capital<br />
gains tax, however equitable it may be, being introduced is a<br />
deterrent to entrepreneurs and small businesses. Now in America<br />
there are moves afoot to completely wipe out capital gains tax,<br />
And I'm wondering about the young man who's going to leave<br />
school next year and he's an entrepreneur and we don't. bave<br />
many of them in Australia, not as many as we should have, he's V<br />
an entrepreneur and how will he find, how will he be encouraged<br />
to go out into the community buy, sell, buy, sell. I do think<br />
capital gains is a deterrent in that sense.<br />
PM: Well I must say I disagree, Ita. That would be-the case<br />
if you were just imposing a tax on the nominal gains, so you<br />
didn't take account of inflation, but this will be a modest<br />
impact. But the important thing you've got to look at If you<br />
talk about the impact upon the economy is that what was happening<br />
in this country to a very large extent was that because there<br />
was not tax on capital gains people were distorting their<br />
patterns of investment and instead of putting it into areas which<br />
were producing income which would be subject to tax they were<br />
diverting investment into areas which would show capital<br />
appreciation upon which there was no tax. So that it was a<br />
very integral part of the whole avoidance industry and it<br />
diverted economic resources in quite uneconomic ways. Now to<br />
stop that is important. It's going to create an environment in<br />
which the young man that you're talking about is going to be<br />
much more likely to be able to be operating in a prosperous<br />
and growing economy.<br />
BUTTROSE: We've got some calls come up now for you Prime Minister.<br />
I wonder if we might take some. Our first caller is-Jack.<br />
Good morning Jim.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Ita.. Good morning Mr Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good morning Jim.<br />
CALLER: Sir, I'd like to ask you one question and I. tbink you're<br />
on the right track now after a long time. But unfair taxes as<br />
far as the. PAYE people we re being taxed unmercifully on their<br />
wages and it virtually was a setback for the country because it<br />
gives people no incentive for productivity. Everybody I've spoken<br />
to in the working class, they more or less say well we're be Ing<br />
blitzed with taxes, what's the point of getting involved in it<br />
t fl . l </p>
<p>CALLER cont.: as far as productivity Is concerned, when otber<br />
people in the lurks and perks department get away with<br />
everything. I mean as far as business lunches are concerned<br />
they can sit down and drink the best wine and eat the best food.<br />
BUTTROSE: Not any more.<br />
PM: Well you're quite right Jim and you're right on the button.<br />
We recognise that it was a disincentive to honest blokes like<br />
yourself who are out there working when the marginal tax rates<br />
were so high and you were getting more than half of every extra<br />
dollar you worked for taken out by the'tax man and so that's<br />
why these rates have been we're bringing them down very<br />
significantly now. And again you're right on the button. One<br />
of the ways in which we're going to be able to afford to bring<br />
these rates down is to cut out the lurks and perks tbat you were<br />
paying for out of your tax for other people. People were just<br />
having their free lunch on you, on the taxpayer.<br />
CALLER: While we're sitting back at lunch time eating a sandwich<br />
and having a cup of tea.<br />
PM: That's right Jim. And so what we've said, well, is -if I<br />
can use an Australianism you know, bugger that type of thing,<br />
because why should some people be able to just have their high<br />
class entertainment on the Jims and Jacks of this world who've<br />
got to pay their and in the process have to pay too much tax.<br />
So we're bringing in a great deal of revenue by closing of f all<br />
those lurks and perks and applying that revenue to reducing your<br />
tax rates.<br />
BUTTROSE: Prime Minister on that question of no more free<br />
lunches for business deductions, the restauranteurs trade and<br />
in particular their spokesman, Oliver Shaw, was saying last night<br />
that it will be very detrimental to the restaurant business.<br />
because there'll be a drop-down one presumes in the people going<br />
to lunch because they can no longer claim it as a deduction,<br />
that restaurants will suffer and that there will be unemployment in<br />
this field. Obviously that would concern yo u, but what reassurance<br />
can you give to these people.<br />
PM: It does concern you, but you've got to in accepting the<br />
responsibility for Government, you've got to look at the overallwelfare.<br />
And what your last caller, Jim, said was right. There<br />
is no justification for a situation in which tbe ordinary working<br />
men and women of this country and those dependent upon them are<br />
paying for free lunches of others. Now if in the process that<br />
means some slight diminution in employment in the restaurant<br />
industry, well I believe that the whole of Australia will say<br />
well, that's the price that will have to be paid. I % e other<br />
point is, of course, that with the change in the taxation structure<br />
there'll bo more money -in the hands of a range of people vi-diznry<br />
wage and salary earners -more in the hands of those who were<br />
adversely affected by the poverty traps at the 16wer end, and<br />
the fact that there's going to be more money in their hands-they're<br />
going to have more disposable income will mean that they will*<br />
spend money on a range of goods. So overall, taking the economy<br />
as a whole, the employment effects will be beneficial. </p>
<p>BUTTROSE: What sort of reaction, sir, do You think you'll get<br />
if you walk into Edna's Table today.<br />
PM: because there are tax perks in existence and that's<br />
artifically elevated a particular area of employment in<br />
restaurants, we don't do anything to introduce tax jlustice<br />
because we might effect that area.<br />
SUTTROSE: Prime Minster we lost you for a minute there, I just<br />
asked you what sort of reaction would you expect to get if you<br />
walked into Edna's Table today. r<br />
PM: Oh, I don't know, you know I'm not scared of things Ita.<br />
I'll walk in anywhere and if people want to have a rational<br />
discussion with me I'll have it.<br />
BUT'TROSE: Great. Betty, good morning to you.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning Betty.<br />
CALLER: What I'm ringing about -I have a house on the market<br />
for $ 130,000 and what I want to do, I wanted to sell it and go<br />
into a cheaper area to be with my daughter. Now when I sell it,<br />
I want to pay about $ 80,000 or $ 90,000 for another one and the<br />
rest of the money I was going to buy a new car and refurniah the<br />
other house. Now how would I go as far as the selling out of here<br />
and going into this other area would I be taxed on that extra<br />
money that I'm going to get by buying..<br />
PM: No. The single important point you've got to understand<br />
Betty is that when you sell this existing asset you've got, it<br />
will attract no capital gains tax at all. On that existing house<br />
you can sell it no capital gains tax.<br />
CALLER: Now how about, though, say it's in bank for two or three<br />
months until I buy the other house and I only pay out say<br />
$ 80,000 for another one, that extra money that I was going to buy<br />
tbe car with and do things in the other bouse. Will-that attract<br />
a capital gains tax.<br />
PM: That proceeds that, you get from the sale of this house attracts<br />
no gains at all, and you go into another house.. YoUr residence at<br />
any stage, not only your existing one, but at no stage will your<br />
house attract any capital gains tax, Betty, nor your motor car.<br />
BUT17RQSE: Alright Betty, so you can sell your house and be happy<br />
and not worry. Right, the Prime Minister has answered that question<br />
for you and we'll take another. Good morning, Harry.<br />
CALLER: Hello It&amp;. Good morning Mr Prime Minister.<br />
PM: G'day Harry.<br />
CALLER: I think you're a great Aussie, mate.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Harry. </p>
<p>CALLER: Now listens I want to get rid of this big brother attitude to F<br />
to the ID card. Now we know the multi-national companies, they<br />
have records on our jail rec * ord, our credit ratings, whether we<br />
are compo. kings, or our or union bashers. Now tbe Government<br />
is drowning In numbers and signatures why not one number for the<br />
lot like for tax, medical and the social service. And why aren't<br />
these social services fingerprinted.<br />
PU4: Well just taking your last point first, harry, I think once<br />
you get Into fingerprints you're getting into a very broadly<br />
unacceptable area. But with the Australia Card that we'll be<br />
bringing in, that will stop fraud in the social welfare area. s<br />
It's amazing to me Harry to find some people objecting to these<br />
cards when In fact the absence of them is allowing a whole lot<br />
of people who are really bludging on the system to get welfare<br />
payments one time, two times, three times, four times over.<br />
Now that will stop that system. Now as far as the card is<br />
concerned, Harry, it will be used in regard to employment so<br />
people can't cheat there under false circumstances, In regard<br />
to certain financial transactions which involve tax and in regard<br />
to the welfare area. Now it will be limiuted to those things and<br />
I think you're right in what I think you're saying-and that is<br />
that If you do it for these legitimate and obviously proper<br />
purposes, there's no-one can complain. We don't want to have<br />
a great proliferation of cards, this is not going to do it.<br />
But what it's going to mean according to our calculations,<br />
Harry, is that once it's fully in operation It will mean over<br />
half a billion dollart8 will be saved so that ordinary taxpayers<br />
won't have that extra burden imposed upon them. The cheats will<br />
be stopped from getting away with over halt a billion dollars<br />
of ordinary taxpayers' money and I think that's what people want<br />
to see.<br />
BUTTROSE: Prime Minister, if I could just cut across there, a lot<br />
of people don't understand, and I must confess I'm one of them,<br />
don't understand the Government's decision not to put photographs<br />
on the ID cards. ton't you think that they will not be as<br />
effective as they might be if the photograph is not to be included.<br />
PM: Look the advice we have, Ita, is that they won't be as<br />
effective without the photographs. But this is an area in which<br />
we tried to take account of as broad a range of views as we can.<br />
There's no doubt that there's some feeling in the community against<br />
these things, so we've taken this step. I think It's one of those<br />
things Ita, that once it's in and people understand the importance<br />
of it, the effectiveness and the fairness of it, the community<br />
may come to see that that next step is one to go to.'<br />
BUTTROSE: Are you saying then that you think there may be a change,<br />
perhaps between now and when the 1D cards are introduced.<br />
to get the card in and if the community gets used to It<br />
and comes to see that it may be even more effective with a photo,<br />
well then that. could come. But there'll be a very, very<br />
substantial saving to the community through this step alone.<br />
BUTTROSE; Betty, good morning. </p>
<p>CALLER: Hello Mr Hawke.<br />
PM** Good morning Betty.<br />
CALLER: I'm a Labor and I always will be. Why I-Im ringing you<br />
is this two things. Firstly, I'm on an invalid pension, my<br />
father died, and I've lived in a Housing Commission unit for<br />
the last five years, a single unit. I also receive $ 10,000 from<br />
my father's estate he died in. April. When I rang the social<br />
security in regard to this, they said my pension would be cut<br />
out $ 10. Also, then I rang the Housing Commission, they * said<br />
my rent would be put up. That is the first thingI wanted to ask<br />
you. I have reared four children etc. etc. I have nothing else<br />
in the bank.<br />
PH: Well Betty all I can say to you with certainty without knowing<br />
all your details, and I'll come to that in a minute,, as far as<br />
the tax package is concerned that was announced yesterday, the<br />
benefits there are substantial for pensioners. I1 don't know<br />
all your circumstances, but these things are significant for<br />
people who are dt~ pendvfit vil pt-nrii004 Or LhatL isUrL ur b*, nefit.<br />
Firstly, the area that will be freed of the income test will be<br />
Increased by $ 10 a week for single pensioners so that that<br />
adverse impact , which will mean in fact that people can get up<br />
to an additional $ 5.00 a week, that will go to about 450,000.<br />
XIM not sure whether you come into that category. I can't tell<br />
from what you're saying. In regard to rent assistance, that<br />
separate Income test on rent assistance will be abolished so<br />
that's going to provide relief to about 700,000 pensioners.<br />
You may come in there. And thirdly, I didn't get the age of<br />
your children..<br />
' BUTTROSE: 21 to 31, four children.<br />
PM: ' What I want to say to you Is that I always make the point,<br />
Ita and Betty, when I get a question like this on a program the<br />
listener can never give all the details so that I'm able to give<br />
an answer which I know will be accurate. So, Betty, if you<br />
would like to and Ita, I know you'd co-operate, if you would<br />
send to me care of Ita's program the full details of your case,,<br />
I'll give you a guarantee that I will have them examined to see<br />
whether there's any way In which you are not getting all the<br />
benefits to which you're entitled or if you're being penaliaed<br />
in any improper way.<br />
BUTTROSE: Prime Minister a change for a moment -off the question<br />
of tax. The very vexed question of the almost half a million<br />
payout to the former head of the Australian Bicentennial Authority,<br />
Dr David Armstrong -now obviously I've followed your remarks<br />
in the Parliament and I'm familiar with the case. But * even if we<br />
were going to err on the side of generosity, It Is indeed a very<br />
generous payout. You're waiting for another reply from Mr Reid<br />
on this matter and I understand that a previous employee of the<br />
Bicentennial Authority has now consulted his solicitors to see<br />
whether he should be entitled to a similar type of payout. Are<br />
you happy that the Bicentennial Authority is being run, in the<br />
way-that it should be.<br />
PH: Well your last point goes right to the heart of it. The<br />
Bicentennial Authority operates and is run under a legislation<br />
that we inherited from the previous Government. They set'it up<br />
A ,2t C~$ LY. ' 17 </p>
<p>PM cont...: as a separate company so that the' Overnment and the<br />
Parliament have got no Involvement in its running or any direct<br />
oversight of It.<br />
BUTrWuSE: Aren't you able to change that.<br />
PM: Well, you see Ita, it's a good question. When we came to office<br />
we made a deliberate decision. It's not the sort of way we would<br />
have liked to have set it up. But what we thought was this<br />
we didn't want to have a political argument and look as though<br />
we were getting into a partisan sort of position about the<br />
important issue of the bicentennial. So we made a deliberate<br />
decision to say alright, we didn't set up this legislation.<br />
We didn't appoint the people who are there. But let's try and<br />
make it work, not have a political fight about It. And so we'veA<br />
tried to make it work. And increasingly there's been criticisms<br />
about some of the things that have been happening. And so we've<br />
been trying.-to deal with them in a way which is not going to<br />
make this a political football. Now unfortunately*. that attitude<br />
is bein g frustrated to some extent. Now we'll have to seriously<br />
look at the question I guess, and particularly I mean I do have to<br />
wait until I get the further replies from Mr Reid and I don't want<br />
to in any sense prejudge, I'm not trying to do tbat it's just<br />
Improper to make any comment until we get those replies but<br />
depending upon the sort of thing that develops out of those<br />
replies, we may have to look at whether there needs to be a<br />
situation where the Government and the Parliamenit do have a greater<br />
degree of involvement.<br />
BUTTROSE: Well there's been a massive amount of overseas trips, q<br />
there's been, I think the sales spending so far by the Bicentennial<br />
Authority is $ 45 million, coupled up with a half a million dollar<br />
payout to Dr Armstrong. I now realise that by seeking my career<br />
in private enterprise I've definitely done the wrong thing.<br />
I should have taken a bureaucratic job. And then we had the<br />
resignation of Ranald Mc~ onald. Now perhaps you and Ranald<br />
McDonal d have had policies that have not always agreed. But I<br />
think in terms of being a businessman whose views are respected,<br />
It is a most unusual step for somebody like Ranald'to resign from<br />
the Bicentennial Authority, because he's not satisfied with the<br />
way that it's being run. And to me that means alarm bells of<br />
a tall order.<br />
PM: Well Ita. it's precisely because there are some alarm bells<br />
ringing, including Ranald McDonald, and there ar~ e other<br />
criticisms, that I had discussions with Mr Reid and it included<br />
the matter of the Chief Executive. 1 mean I haven-It ignored those<br />
and I've tried to this point to operate within the-structure<br />
that's been imposed upon us by our predecessors. I'm aware<br />
of those concerns and I've asked that certain consideration<br />
be given to some of the points you make about the number of<br />
overseas trips and so on. But you're in this position where<br />
you have no authority over the running of the blessed thing.<br />
I mean you talk about bureaucrats. Essentially what they've done,<br />
what our predecessors have done, is to set this up as a separate<br />
company, and that's what it's done. It's a separate company, it has<br />
articles and memorandums of association.<br />
BUTTROSE: Even for a separate company, it's a big payout.<br />
Anyway I know you've got the cat by the tail, so to speak sir, so </p>
<p>BUTTROSE cont...; I know something else will happen. l'm<br />
just fascinated and intrigued by the various things that have<br />
been occurring. You also have time restriction on you this<br />
morning. Would you have time for one more call.<br />
For you, Ita, I would, yes.<br />
BUTTROSE: Thank you. Les, you're the lucky person. Good morning.<br />
CALLER: Good morning sir.<br />
PM: Good morning Les.<br />
CALLER: This is away from the tax question. What it's about is<br />
a national program about the unemployment. The benefits that<br />
are paid out and are not been utilised, it's wasted money paid<br />
out, not in the sense of a waste of helping families, but it's<br />
wasted in helping the country. Surely there could be a State by<br />
State scheme introduced where there's some return, some work<br />
return, some projects for States..<br />
PM: Yeah Les, it's a very good point you raised and In some<br />
sense that concept is already being utilised. We've got the<br />
CEP scheme which involves that sort of idea where people -are in<br />
fact doing community work it's called the Community Employment<br />
Program where in return for help and training they are doing<br />
projects of community benefit which wouldn't otherwise be undertaken.<br />
And in the new overall project for youth that we announced at the<br />
time of the Budget, there will be further attention given by<br />
us and particularly by the Minister assiting me, Mr Dawkins, to<br />
see how we can look further at schemes which will Involve people<br />
who are getting the unemployment benefit being involved in actually<br />
undertaking useful work in the community which wouldn't on normal<br />
commercial terms be undertaken. So,. Les, I can say to you that<br />
your concept makes a lot of sense. Some of the things that were<br />
doing already embody it and there will be ways in which we'll move<br />
gradually to widen that idea.<br />
BUTTROSE;.. Prime Minister I was most genuine when I said I think<br />
the Government is to be congratulated to have the guts to tackle<br />
tax reform, dodged and not addressed by the previous Governments.<br />
And I wondered now that the Government has its splendid reforming<br />
image, I wondered if your next reform might be the Government<br />
sector, because the Government sector as a whole chews up about<br />
of our GNP, that's our gross national product.* And I wondered<br />
if perhaps this might be the next reform issue that the Government<br />
will address itself to.<br />
PM: Well what you'll appreciate, Ita, is that we've already<br />
acted in that area. In these three Budgets that we've been<br />
involved with-now we have very, very substantially reduced the<br />
levels of growth that have been taking place, so much so that<br />
we've now reduced the deficit by several billions of dollars<br />
and got it down to about half the proportion of the gross domestic<br />
product it bad before. And-I mean that's been recognised by<br />
the financial commentators more in this period to really<br />
effectively cut down in this area than has' been done before.<br />
Bu~ t more importantly into the future by imposing this constraint<br />
of the trilogy upon us, we've made sure that having given these<br />
great tax deductions we're not going to be able to finance<br />
-Vk'IjY ME.~ rI; -3 </p>
<p>PM cont...: additional expenditures by allowing the deficit to<br />
go up. We're stopped from doing that.<br />
BUTTROSE: Thank you very much sir for joining us this morning.<br />
PM; Ita thank you very much indeed and your listeners.<br />
