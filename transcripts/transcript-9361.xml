    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased to announce that the Taoiseach, Mr Albert Reynolds, will be visiting<br />Australia from 17-25 Septcniber as a guest of the Australian Government.</p>
<p>I am delighted that, following my own visit to Ireland in September 1993,<br />Prime Minister Reynolds has been able to accept my invitation to come here. He will<br />bc in Canberra from 20-22 September and he will also visit Perth, Melbourne and<br />Sydney. Australia's relations with Ireland are close, friendly arnd longstanding. The Irish<br />community in Australia has played an important role in the development of Australia's<br />history and its culture. Bilateral cultural links are strong and tourism flows in both<br />directions have increased in recent years. I look forward to discussing both bilateral<br />and international issues with Prime Minister Reynolds and to hearing his views on the<br />Northern Ireland peace process, in which he has been closely involved.</p>
<p>Mr Reynolds will be accompanied by his wife, Mrs Kathleen Reynolds.<br />CANBERRA 16 September 1994</p>
