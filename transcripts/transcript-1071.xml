OPENING OF THE HEAD OFFICE OF TE NATIONAL MUTUAL<br />
LIFE ASSOCIATION, COLLINS STRELT, MELJOURNE. JST MARCH.. 1965<br />
Speech by the Pri Me zl<br />
Sir Robert It gives me very great pleasure indeed to be here<br />
and to be here under the chairmanship of such an old and valued<br />
friend as yourself. I was provided with these brochures myself and,<br />
unlike most of you, I read them closely. ( Laughter)<br />
Otherwise I would, this afternoon be entirely bereft of<br />
facts. But it was in August of 1 g 69 that this Society began,<br />
the first mutual life assurance society in Victoria, and it<br />
was established at the corner, so I'm given to believe, of<br />
Collins and Market Street better known later on as the corner<br />
of the old destern Market and I'm bound to admit and I<br />
have to be very careful about what I admit I'm bound to<br />
admit that these things have changed.<br />
I look across the road and expect vainly to see<br />
Scotts Hotel where I will have all you Sassenachs know, they<br />
made the best haggis in the world. ( Laughter) Instead of<br />
that there is a rather melancholy sort of......( Laughter)<br />
not at all reminiscent of the old roistering days. And as<br />
I came in this afternoon I sniffed to see vihether some of<br />
the lovely rich odours of the old wine cellars might have<br />
survived but nothing survives the modern builder. Gone are<br />
the wine cellars; gone is all the mess that used to be down<br />
below in the Western Markets and up comes a magnificent<br />
building. And, really, one can't complain because whatever<br />
else might have been said about the old Western Market, I<br />
don't think it added very much to the beauty of Melbourne<br />
although it was situated in one of the most historic localities<br />
in this city. And so here we are watching change, development,<br />
particularly this end of Melbourne a beautiful development<br />
in what in spite of the critics, I will always maintain is<br />
a beautiful city and will continue to be one so long as the<br />
architects permit it to be. ( Laughter)<br />
Now, Sir, the growth since 1869, the growth<br />
beginning before that in Sydney, the growth in life assurance<br />
has been one of the most remarkable features of modern life.<br />
In the last ten years, the total assets of life companies in<br />
Australia has increased two and a half times over in ten years.<br />
Personal savings you will forgive me, won't you, for a few<br />
of these figures but I got them from the Treasury and I must<br />
use them personal savings through iremiums on life policies<br />
and so on represent twenty-five per cent. of the total personal<br />
savings of the people of Australia, and ten years ago, they<br />
represented fifteen percent. This is a phenomenal growth and<br />
I will say a fewr words in a moment to indicate w1V I think<br />
it is not only phenomenal but valuable beyond words. The<br />
excess of premiums over claims and expenses, so I'm told now,<br />
runs at the rate of about Å“ 100M per annum. </p>
<p>2<br />
Now, I must say I'm a great believer in life assurance.<br />
It is the only form of saving that was ever effective with me<br />
( Laughter) because it was compulsory. You know, you had to say<br />
to yourself, " WJell 11whatever happens I must keep up my life<br />
assurance premiums and so we do, then with the good management<br />
of those responsible for looking after our little savings, they<br />
begin to increase, They have bonus additions. You find yourself<br />
sitting down and saying, " W'hat am I insured for now?" and although<br />
it is not enough, itis a lot more than occasionally I've been<br />
expecting to know. Compulsory saving is a wonderful exercise<br />
in self-discipline anid that's tremendously important, 1@ dies<br />
and gentlemen, in a country which needs more and more capital<br />
if its growth over the next ten years is to match the growth<br />
that I've hinted at over the last ten.<br />
There's a chronic problem all Prime Ministers have<br />
to encounter it, all Treasurers have to encounter it, a chronic<br />
problem of reconciling growth with monetary stability; growth<br />
without an undue flusii of inflation; growth under circumistances<br />
which will encourage people to save knowing that their sc-! vings<br />
will not be eroded, and at the same time enables the country<br />
to press on with all the development that it needs with a rising<br />
population and rising responsibilities in the world. This is<br />
a chronic problem, and, Sir, all I want to say is that it is<br />
one towiards the solution of which I believe that the great life<br />
offices are making a contribution, a remarkable contribution, and<br />
I think they are making their contribution I don't want to be<br />
tedious about this matter I think they are making it in three<br />
ways. Somebody told me only the other day that as I made<br />
three points, I must be a Presbyterian. I pleaded guilty.<br />
( Laughter) In the first place, I think that the great life<br />
offices are doing thiis by encouraging savings for long-term<br />
purposes. They also encourage a consciousness of the dangers<br />
of inflation. There are some people who believe in inflation.<br />
There are some people who have a vested interest in inflation.<br />
There are some who hear about it as a wrord without completely<br />
understanding what it may mean, but in the long run, we can't<br />
afford to have the value of savings cut away by serious<br />
depreciation in the purchasing power of money. And with all<br />
the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of policyholders<br />
we have in Australia, we have a great body of people<br />
who understand this matter and w. 1hose vested interest, if they<br />
heve one is a vested interest in favour of monetary stability.<br />
That, I t~ hink, has been a very great contribution to tie solution<br />
of this problem. Then in the second place, as Sir Robert indicoted<br />
very briefly, by their investment policies they encourage and<br />
help private and national investment and growth. It is not so<br />
many years now since I appeared in a case in court it can't<br />
bo more than fifteen or twenty to appear for the National<br />
Ilutual for a modest fee ( Laughter), to get approval under a<br />
new statute which had come into existence for an alteration in<br />
their Memorandum of Association in order that they might widen<br />
the field of their investment. This is going back some time.<br />
And wo all know! today, don't we how varied the field<br />
of investment is primary industry, seconlary industry,<br />
developmental schemes, housing a great range of investment,<br />
some in the public sector because public demands for investable </p>
<p>-3<br />
funds are great and growing; some in the private sector an<br />
immense variety, a variety of investments which I imagine the<br />
founder of this society would have regarded as lax and dargerous<br />
in 1869, and in effect have been tremendous. The effects have<br />
been that the funds brought in from policy-holders have served<br />
as a fertilising force all round Australia, and have I think, 1<br />
made a tremendous contribution both to private investment,<br />
private success and to public investment and to national growth.<br />
Then there is a third aspect of the Societyls which<br />
I hope I might be allowed to mention. They are strong. You<br />
take this one we are particularly concerned with today. The<br />
mere quotation of figures that Sir Robert has given us indicates<br />
its tremendous strength and solidity. And because the life<br />
offices have exhibited strength and solidity, they have encouraged<br />
in all of our minds the feeling of confidence in the future.<br />
There is nothing that engenders confidence half so much as<br />
strength solidity, security. Nothing that destroys confidence<br />
so quickly as a feeling that the building is shaking and may<br />
collapse. And the strength of the life offices today, their<br />
solidity, their absolutely invulnerable solvency, this has been<br />
a powerful contributor to confidence, and that is a very very<br />
great factor which perhaps deserves another minute or tw-o before<br />
I conclude, It is a very great factor because if capital and<br />
enterprise and people are to be attracted to Australia, then<br />
they must have confidence in us. This is something that we<br />
need to have in our mainds much more than we do. The inflow of<br />
people, the inflow of money, the inflow of skills and enterprise,<br />
these are not accidental. They wouldntt happen if we were<br />
a community without confidence in ourselves, if we were a<br />
community that gave every symptom of being a shaky community,<br />
insecure, not trusting ourselves and therefore not to be trusted.<br />
These great movements will not happen if we lack confidence in<br />
ourselves and that is why the contribution of the life offices<br />
to the building up of confidence in the way that I have described<br />
is Itts an invisible item, if you like, Itts an<br />
invisible item but a very real one, a very great factor in the<br />
development of our country.<br />
And therefore, Sir, to conclude, I just want to say<br />
this, in declaring this centre open, I just want to say that<br />
wre are celebrating for the reasons that I mentioned, a mutuality<br />
of interests in the service of the nation and therefore the<br />
name National ivutual, embracing as it does both of those ideas,<br />
is a very happy one and well befits a very happy occasion.<br />
I have great pleasure in declaring the centre open. </p>
