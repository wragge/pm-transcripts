<p>The Prime Minister today offered the sincere condolencesÂ of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to Mrs JillÂ Neilson following the death yesterday of her husband, theÂ former Premier of Tasmania, the Hon Bill Neilson AC.</p>
<p>Mr Hawke said that the late Bill Neilson in hisÂ parliamentary role as the Member for Franklin betweenÂ 1946 and 1980 and as a Minister in a number of portfoliosÂ had given distinguished service to the people of TasmaniaÂ and the nation.</p>
<p>Affectionately known as ' the singing premier' BillÂ Neilson was highly respected within the Australian LaborÂ Party for his courage, his generosity of spirit and hisÂ relentless pursuit of Labor's ideals.</p>
<p>A State Funeral will be held early next week at which theÂ Federal Government will be represented at MinisterialÂ level.</p>
