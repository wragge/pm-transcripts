    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>10 November 1989</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister today offered the sincere condolences of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to Mrs Jill Neilson following the death yesterday of her husband, the former Premier of Tasmania, the Hon Bill Neilson AC.</p>
<p>Mr Hawke said that the late Bill Neilson in his parliamentary role as the Member for Franklin between 1946 and 1980 and as a Minister in a number of portfolios had given distinguished service to the people of Tasmania and the nation.</p>
<p>Affectionately known as ' the singing premier' Bill Neilson was highly respected within the Australian Labor Party for his courage, his generosity of spirit and his relentless pursuit of Labor's ideals.</p>
<p>A State Funeral will be held early next week at which the Federal Government will be represented at Ministerial level.</p>
