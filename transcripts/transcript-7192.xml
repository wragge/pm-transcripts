PROME R tOt9STER<br />
FOR MEDIA 30 JUNE 1987<br />
During my visit to China in February 1984 1 outlined the<br />
basic elemonts of an initiative to engage Australian and<br />
Chinese fi. emsm ore closely in the massive expansion of the<br />
Chinese irc and steel making industry which is currently<br />
underway.<br />
Among otheT things that led in August 1984 to an agreement<br />
to undertake a feasibility study into a joint venture mine<br />
at Mt Channaro<br />
I am happy to be able to announce today that almost three<br />
years of patient investigation and negotiation have now<br />
borne fruit.<br />
As I speakt our Ambassador, Dr Garnaut, and senior Chinese<br />
officials led by the Minister for Metallurgical Industries,<br />
Mr Qi Yuanjing, and the Vice Chairman of the State Planning<br />
Commission, Liu Suinian, are witnessing in Beijing the<br />
initialling of a joint venture agreement between the China<br />
Metallurgical import and Export Corporation ( CMIXEC) ( the<br />
trading am of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry) and<br />
Channar Hfning Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of<br />
Hamersley Iron. Hammersley's equity will be 60 per cent,<br />
with the remainder held by the Chinese partner.<br />
The agreement will lead to a substantial investment<br />
( initially about $ 250m) to develop a new ore body of some<br />
200 million tonnes in the Pilbara region.<br />
The new mine will produce high grade ore for export, which<br />
will be wholly taken by CMIEC for use in China. When fully<br />
operational some 10 million tonnes per annum will be shipped<br />
to China, valued at about $ 200m a year at current prices.<br />
Channar ore will be blended with iron ore from existing<br />
Hamersley operations to provide ore similar to current<br />
production. Maximum use will be made of the existing Hamersley<br />
infrastructure.<br />
An important element of the agreement has been undertakings<br />
given by Hamersley to guarantee performance and continuity<br />
of supply. </p>
<p>This will be the first joint venture investment in an iron<br />
ore mine by the Chinese.<br />
It represents a major show of confidence by the Chinese in<br />
the Australian iron ore industry.<br />
it will lead to the opening of a new mine with an assured<br />
market in an otherwise highly uncertain world trading<br />
environment. It provides Australia with a unique opportunity to build<br />
upon the already good relations with China in the area of<br />
iron and otoel cooperation to participate in the burgeoning<br />
growth of China's iron and steel industry.<br />
China is seeking to raise its current output of steel from<br />
56 million tonnes in 1986 to over 90 million tonnes by the<br />
year 2000. China's involvement with the Channar przoject<br />
will help to open the door for other mineG and other<br />
producers to export.<br />
This new joint venture arrangenent is yet another indication<br />
of the benefits which can be had by Australia from seeking<br />
to exploit wiore fully the geographic and competitive<br />
advantages which we have in this region.<br />
Arrangements of this kind with Chinese enterprises are most<br />
readily made under the auspices of an appropriate government<br />
to governmont relationship.<br />
Today's in-' tialling represents the culmination of 3 years<br />
work by our two governments and, particularly, by the<br />
parties principal.<br />
I wish to record my personal thanks to Premier Zhao Ziyang<br />
for his efforts in taking forward the commitments which we<br />
made to the iron and steel initiative in 1984 and which we<br />
renewed in M'ay last year.<br />
I also wish to congratulate Hamersley iron for their,<br />
perseverance and wish them every success. </p>
