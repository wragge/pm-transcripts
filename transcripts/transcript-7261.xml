    <content><![CDATA[<p>11 DECEMBER 1987</p>
<p>Lawrie Sawle, the National Chairman of Selectors, and I have chosen the following team to represent the Prime Minister's XI against New Zealand at Manuka Oval on 23 December 1987:</p>
<p>Allan Border ( Queensland) ( Captain)<br />Peter Capes ( western Australia)<br />Tony Dodemaide ( Victoria)<br />Denis Hickey ( Victoria)<br />David Hookes ( South Australia)<br />Greg Irvine ( Australian Capital Territory)<br />Geoff marsh ( Western Australia)<br />Tom Moody ( Western Australia)<br />Richard Soule ( Tasmania) ( Wicket-keeper)<br />Mark Taylor ( New South Wales)<br />Mark Waugh ( New South Wales)<br />12th Man: Steven Frost ( Australian Capital Territory)</p>
<p>I believe that this team will provide tough competition for the Kiwis. It has a good balance of experience and youth, and I am very pleased that this year the ACT, which has a strong and very keen cricket competition, will also be represented in the XI.</p>
<p>I am sure that Canberra'ls cricket lovers will once again enjoy an entertaining match, which will no doub't be played in that spirit of commitment and good sportsmanship, which marks trans-Tasman competition.</p>
<p>( NOTE: Tickets for the match are on sale at all branches of the Canberra Building Society). </p>
