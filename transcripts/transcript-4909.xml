UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL DELIVERED. F78/ 251<br />
PRIMEUSTRMINIA T<br />
FOR PRESS 3 DECEMBER 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Since coming to office, your Government has followed policies<br />
consistently designed to sustain economic growth and thus<br />
provide emoloyment opportunities.<br />
There is no easy way. We have not been seduced by demands for<br />
politically expedient, short-term palliatives. Such policies<br />
would do no more than fuel the fires of inflation without<br />
curing the Problem.<br />
Our policies are long-term ones that will put Australian<br />
industry and commerce once more back on a sound base, and<br />
from that base will come a resurgence of job opportunities.<br />
It won't happen overnight, but already there are encouraging<br />
signs: inflation is down substantially, interest rates are<br />
coming down, investment is picking up, order books are filling<br />
up, and once more some major Australian companies are gearing<br />
up their export divisions.<br />
Despite the progress we have made there is still much to be<br />
done. The Government is not sitting idly by waiting for a<br />
magic solution. Over the past few days we have taken major<br />
new steps to up-date our policies, to meet the changing needs<br />
of our timze.<br />
The creation of the new Commonwealth Department of Employment<br />
and Youth Affairs is a posi tive example of the great importance<br />
your Government places on giving attention to employment,<br />
particularly employment opportunities for young people.<br />
More recently, we have taken initiatives to underline the<br />
GovernmentC's determination to gain every possible benefit<br />
from technical innovation, both here and overseas, and acquire<br />
a better understanding of the labour market.<br />
Your Government has decided to set up a Committee of Inquiry<br />
to examine, report and make recommendations on the process<br />
of technological change in Australian industry. The Union<br />
Movement will have representation on the Inquiry. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Much work in the field of technological change the so-called<br />
' computer revolution' has been pioneered by the Depart-ment<br />
of Productivity, established by the Government just on two<br />
years ago. However, the new Inqh~ iry will place emphasis on<br />
maxi-mising the economic and social benefits of the technological<br />
revolution and minimising any adverse consequences.<br />
The second initiative will involve the Government in joining<br />
with industry and the unions in a wide ranging study of labour<br />
market problems posed by such things as penalty rates, weekend<br />
and part-time work, juniors, job-sharing and trade skills.<br />
This Tnauiry, agreed to by the National Labour Consultative<br />
Corp. mittee, will be headed by the Chairman of the State Electricity<br />
Commission of Victoria, Mr Trethowan.<br />
Both -moves demonstrate the Government's real concern for problems<br />
forced on an established workforce by a changing technology.<br />
But this is not a job for the Commonwealth, industry unions.<br />
The States too have an important role to play. I have therefore<br />
written to the Premiers, asking them to co-operate in a review<br />
of all areas of State responsibility which may contribute to<br />
unemployment or which may reveal scope for encouraging employment.<br />
It may well be that some State legislative or institutional<br />
arrangements are having an adverse effect on employment. For<br />
example, there are inconsistencies between States in such matters<br />
as standards and regulations. This is particularly true in the<br />
construction industry, where undoubtedly it has an adverse<br />
effect on employment opportunities.<br />
There is also no doubt that some State taxes and charges provide<br />
a financial burden on industry and discourage increased job<br />
opportunities. In the same general area, employment conditions<br />
which result in increased costs for industry, such as high<br />
standards of long service leave, also restrict employment<br />
opportunities. I have asked the State Premiers to give serious consideration.<br />
to these questions, and I believe that considerable benefits<br />
for employment could flow fram such an examination. </p>
