TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, DARLING HARBOUR EXHIBITION<br />
CENTRE, SYDNEY 2 MAY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can you clear up once and<br />
for all whether the consumption tax is on the<br />
Government' s agenda?<br />
PM: You'll get a very clear statement of the<br />
Government's position on this from the Treasurer early<br />
next week which will make it abundantly clear that what<br />
we said in the election campaign we meant. And that is<br />
that we will not be introducing a broad-based consumption<br />
tax. JOURNALIST: In the term of this Government Prime<br />
Minister? PM: Certainly we will not be introducing it in the term<br />
of this Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has it disturbed you that the debate has<br />
been thrown wide open again by one of your Ministers?<br />
PM: No. You ought to know me by now. You've witnessed<br />
me as Prime Minister for seven years. I don't get the<br />
same amount of consternation in my mind as you in the<br />
media get from your own headlines. I mean someone makes<br />
an offhand comment, what do we see boom, boom, boom,<br />
headlines all over the place. Now you get the collective<br />
media knickers knotted. I don't...<br />
JOURNALIST: On State finances, Nick Greiner has baulked<br />
at the fact that NSW is going to get $ 100 million less.<br />
What's your reaction to that?<br />
PM: Again, I don't get terribly upset when I see a<br />
newspaper headline that a Premier expresses concern that<br />
he might, as a result of an independent commission, get<br />
some redistribution of available resources away from him<br />
to other States. He wouldn't be doing his job if he<br />
didn't express his concern. But these things have their<br />
own processes. We get the report from the Grants<br />
Commission and we consider it and then decisions are<br />
taken at the Premiers' Conference and Loans Council<br />
Meeting. Those processes will just go ahead normally. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: government actually going to ask you<br />
for more money to pay teachers wages.<br />
PM: nothing new. I mean we've been in Federation<br />
now for nearly 90 years, and throughout Federation the<br />
States have been asking the Commonwealth for more money.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just back to the environment for a moment<br />
Prime Minister. You've said quite a bit about timber<br />
this morning and sustainable development. The submission<br />
on imported rainforest timber that's now on the Cabinet<br />
agenda, do you have a position on that that you're<br />
prepared to state at the moment?<br />
PM: I tend not to I mean there are exceptions but I<br />
tend not to state my position in advance of Cabinet<br />
considerations. Generally speaking that's a wise course<br />
of action. But I can make the general comment that we<br />
have indicated our concern as an Australian Government<br />
for the preservation of world rainforest resources.<br />
We've made financial grants in respect of Brazil and we<br />
have made available to Malaysia the services of<br />
Australian rainforest experts to help to advise Malaysia<br />
in policies for the preservation of their rainforests.<br />
So we have an international concern and we will look at<br />
this report and make what we think is the appropriate<br />
decision. JOURNALIST: Yet Australia's still importing quite a bit<br />
of PM: Yes, of course. That's why we've got a report isn't<br />
it? JOURNALIST: Are you considering tax concessions for<br />
producers of environment friendly goods?<br />
PM: Not only considering it, we've done it. We've made<br />
tax concessions in respect of recycled paper for<br />
instance. JOURNALIST: Would there be tax penalties against carbon<br />
producers, greenhouse<br />
PM: The consideration of how we deal with the greenhouse<br />
effect is an ongoing matter and we certainly won't be<br />
rushing in to an ad hoc decision of that sort. But we<br />
will be, as we are in so many other environmental<br />
matters, taking a world lead, I believe, in decisions to<br />
ensure that we at least meet, or more than meet, the sort<br />
of international environment expectations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Peter Cook says that a consumption tax is<br />
unnecessary. Does the Government rule a consumption tax<br />
out? PM: Just listen to the answer I've given already would<br />
you please. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The coal industry has expressed concerns<br />
about the environmental push for limiting emissions of<br />
carbon dioxide. Does the resource sector have a primary<br />
worry here in Australia?<br />
PM: Well naturally the coal industry is going to have<br />
some concern I guess about the increasing global worry<br />
about the level of emissions. And naturally if you were<br />
in the coal industry you'd be looking at what that meant<br />
for your industry. It's not surprising.<br />
JOURNALIST: Professor Geoffrey Blainey says it's going<br />
to damage our export industry.<br />
PM: I take very little notice of Professor Geoffrey<br />
Blainey on any matter whatsoever.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you say that you've already<br />
answered the consumption tax question. I wasn't here.<br />
question on the consumption tax?<br />
PM: Alright, well I'll take account of the fact that you<br />
weren't here. I've indicated that we said in the<br />
election campaign that this Government would not be<br />
introducing a consumption tax. That is our position.<br />
I've had a discussion with the Treasurer and we've agreed<br />
that he'll be making a very definitive statement in a<br />
speech on this I would think early next week.<br />
JOURNALIST: It must worry you that it's a question that<br />
won't go away though.<br />
PM: Do I look terribly worried? I mean obviously you<br />
weren't here a moment ago. So let me repeat what I said.<br />
The media has the capacity to get their if I can use<br />
the phrase their knickers in a collective knot because<br />
some fellow makes some passing observations. we get<br />
headlines Government crisis. I Just ask you to have a<br />
look at me. Do I look very crisis-ridden or torn about<br />
this issue? I mean, you've really got to understand<br />
politics. Politics are not made by your headlines, as<br />
much as you might like to think they are. They're not.<br />
JOURNALIST: ACTU trying to pave the way though, well<br />
it appears that they're trying to pave the way.<br />
PM: Well it may appear to you, but I suggest that you do<br />
another analysis. The ACTU is not trying to pave the<br />
way. I'm just fascinated by the observation. I'd like<br />
to know what you rest that on.<br />
JOURNALIST: did say the Government was considering<br />
it. PM: Senator Cook didn't say the Government was<br />
considering it. I saw the program and said that<br />
people were talking about it, but </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: He said it would be considered.<br />
PM: Well, I've told you it would be considered. It will<br />
be considered in a statement by the Treasurer early next<br />
week in which it will be made quite clear what the result<br />
of the consideration is. No change in the position of<br />
the Government. I mean when you have people getting up<br />
here, there and everywhere saying consumption tax,<br />
consumption tax, I mean we don't block our ears and say<br />
we haven't heard them say that. We say oh well, people<br />
are talking about a consumption tax. The Treasurer and I<br />
have had a discussion about it, together with some of our<br />
other Ministers I might say, and I reaffirm what I said<br />
during the election campaign, and this is the last time<br />
I'm going to say it because it really is getting boring<br />
for me even if it's not for you. There will not be a<br />
consumption tax imposed by this Government. And the<br />
Treasurer will be spelling out very clearly the reasons<br />
why next week. Now, end of discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Brigadier Garland of the RSL has made a<br />
remark this morning which you no doubt saw. Is it<br />
embarrassing for the Japanese Defence Minister?<br />
PM: I think it must be embarrassing for the RSL.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you understand why somebody like the<br />
Brigadier might make a remark like that?<br />
PM: I have a lot of challenges in my life as Prime<br />
Minister. To fathom the mind of Brigadier Garland is not<br />
one that I intend to add to my challenges.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it more of an embarrassment to the RSL<br />
than the Japanese Defence Minister?<br />
PM: I wouldn't have thought that the Japanese Defence<br />
Minister should be embarrassed by the observations of<br />
Brigadier Garland.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you got any plans to go to Nyngan or<br />
Dubbo? PM: No. The people of Nyngan had conveyed to them, and<br />
in the flood areas, had conveyed to them by Paul Keating<br />
in his capacity as Acting Prime Minister while I was at<br />
Gallipoli, my deep concern. I've expressed those and<br />
we're going to be taking the actions, the financial<br />
actions that are necessary to ensure that we do as much<br />
as we can in cooperation with the State Government in<br />
this matter. I don't think at this stage a visit by me<br />
is necessary. They know, through the visit of the Acting<br />
Prime Minister and my own statements before I left, and<br />
the actions that we will be taking, the depth of our<br />
concern for it. I don't think a visit is necessary.<br />
ends </p>
