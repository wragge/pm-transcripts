 I have written to a number of industry associations and companies inviting<br />
   them to support in a philanthropic way the reconstruction of East Timor.</p>
<p>  The task of reconstruction will be significant and will require a concerted<br />
   effort in a number of areas. The Federal Government has already provided<br />
   $14million for humanitarian relief in East and West Timor since August.<br />
   As a nation with a strong diversified economy, Australian companies are<br />
   also well placed to play a role.</p>
<p>  While there will be commercial opportunities for Australian companies participating<br />
   in the UN funded reconstruction effort, Australian companies also have a<br />
   proud history of business philanthropy.</p>
<p>  It is part of the Australian ethos to reach out with a helping hand to those<br />
   in need. I am confident that a number of Australian companies will seek<br />
   to help the people of East Timor with donations of goods and services.</p>
<p>  To its great credit, the timber industry has already started to organise<br />
   for products to go to East Timor to help with the pressing task of building<br />
   reconstruction.</p>
<p>  It is important that appropriate goods are delivered where they are needed<br />
   most. Through AusAID, the Government will work with companies wishing to<br />
   donate goods and services to achieve the best outcomes.</p>
<p>  I urge Australian companies to support this very worthy cause.</p>
