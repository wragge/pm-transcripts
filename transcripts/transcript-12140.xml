    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Queensland Premier's claim that the Federal Government wishes to<br />
unilaterally increase the rate of the GST is totally false. </p>
<p>The rate of the GST is set in concrete at 10 percent under a Coalition Government. We will not increase it. </p>
<p>It could be increased by a future Labor Government needing the extra money to finance the GST rollback promised by Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>No doubt the Labor governed states would happily oblige a future Labor prime minister in his desire to increase the GST.</p>
<p>The Private Member's Bill to which the Queensland Premier has referred is precisely that - a Private Member's Bill. It has not been endorsed as government policy.</p>
<p>The Federal Government remains fully committed to the inter-governmental agreement signed by me and the premiers. It will not be breached by us. Mr Beattie knows that. His statement today is nothing more than a Ryan by-election stunt.</p>
<p>It remains the case that states other than Queensland can provide petrol price relief. This can be achieved without any breach of the inter-governmental agreement. </p>
