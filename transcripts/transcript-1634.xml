Title :" ALFRED DEAKIN.-HIS LIFE AND OUR TIMES"<br />
" The Liberal Tradition in Australia"<br />
INAUGURAL LECTURE DELIVERED BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. HAROLD<br />
HOLT, CH, MP, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF<br />
MELBOUR NE 31ST JULY, 1967<br />
When Alfred Deakin died, the Commonwealth of Australia was<br />
not quite twenty years old. It was peopled, in Deakin's phrase, by a little<br />
more than " five million Australian Britons" and had just emerged in the flush<br />
of victory from the horror of World War 1. Six States, six former colonies,<br />
united in a Federation by constitutional processes, had been fused by the<br />
searing process of war and were beginning to reach out again in the forward<br />
march as a nation. Deakin had watched the nation's ordeal from the wings. It<br />
was the evening of his brilliant career, for his memory was failing in those<br />
years and his intellectual powers were almost spent. Yet he saw the nation<br />
he had done so much to create, and in whose service he had exhausted his<br />
strength, face its first great test and emerge triumphant, with honours<br />
written large on the banners of its short history. This was one measure of<br />
his labours, and those of his fellow-founding fathers. He, and they, had<br />
built well. What Alfred Deakin achieved in Victorian politics, in the union<br />
of the States and in the first thirteen years of Commonwealth are well recorded.<br />
The honour board is bright with his achievements, and in a nation not given<br />
to loving, or even liking, its great men, his name Is revered and remembered.<br />
He was a Liberal, with a little and a capital and it is of the man and<br />
his work, and how, in the perspective of history, we see him against the<br />
events of our time, that I speak to you tonight.<br />
There was an age of Deakin and it embraced many things. The<br />
spotlight fell first on Federation, and Protection as a policy for the nation.<br />
These were our beginnings as a nation. Many laboured in those vineyards at<br />
the beginning of the century and the credit must be shared. But Deakin was<br />
the architect, the leader, the advocate three times Prime Minister in the<br />
first thirteen years of Federation. His was the mind and his was the heart<br />
that gave the new nation a course to steer.<br />
We knowa good deal about him for he wrote as fluently as he<br />
spoke and his letters and papers are voluminous. They are, however,<br />
fragments of a whole, for in the six years that were left to him when he took<br />
his leave of politics his wearied mind was not able to finish its task of giving<br />
us his complete, personal story. His own book, now published as " The<br />
Federal Story, is only part of the record.<br />
He was born in Fitzroy in 1856, the only son of English migrants<br />
who had made a honeymoon voyage to Australia and landed first in Adelaide,<br />
where a daughter, Sarah, was born. Then the lure of gold brought the / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
family to Victoria. Young Deakin had the great boon of a happy home. He<br />
was not born to riches, and had no castles to defend in later life. Nor was<br />
he born to poverty. There was no bitterness in his heart.<br />
His father made a modest living in the coaching business<br />
between Melbourne and Bendigo, and with Cobb and Co. Alfred had a good<br />
education, first at a small mixed school ( mainly for girls) in South Yarra and<br />
later at Melbourne Grammar School where it is fair to assume he learnt the<br />
art of eloquent speaking from the talented Dr Bromby, a Cambridge man who<br />
was then headmaster. Deakin was a voracious reader. He devoured books<br />
and poetry of every kind with a fever that consumed most of his leisure hours.<br />
Some biographers have been tempted to give him a dual<br />
personality#. a lively, larking schoolboy, casual with his studies and a<br />
dreamer, a visionary beyond his years. I don't think he was two people.<br />
We all have our dreams, but it so happened that Deakin made many of his<br />
come true. He was, in my judgment, a normal, intelligent schoolboy,<br />
showing early signs of scholarship and the questioning of an alert mind on<br />
matters of religion, philosophy and the social problems of the day. His<br />
Christian faith was real from an early age but was never neatly packaged and<br />
his mind wandered in lively interest through spiritualism and along nonconformist<br />
ways. He was a liberal but, in the tune and temper of the times,<br />
he was also a radical.<br />
He came to politics at the age of twenty-two. Behind him was the<br />
law he had had a few briefs as a barrister, some teaching, including a<br />
period voluntarily given to night classes for the street urchins who excited<br />
his interest and compassion, and experience in journalism as a political<br />
writer for " The Age". He won the seat of West Bourke in Victoria in 1879<br />
and resigned on his first day in Parliament at the conclusion of his speech<br />
moving the Address -in-Reply because of an irregularity in the poll caused by<br />
a shortage of ballot papers.<br />
" If I am the representative of the majority of electors of West<br />
Bourke, I will be returned again. If I am not their representative, I have no<br />
right here. He was returned again and for twenty years was a State Member<br />
and a Minister for seven of those years.<br />
In those turbulent days when the life of the colony was raw and<br />
privilege rated high, the Liberal spoke for most of the people against the<br />
entrenched representatives of the aristocracy of wealth and prcperty. There<br />
was a force and a fever about Deakin, the State politician who, though always<br />
a Liberal, began as a free-trader and was converted by David Syme, the<br />
proprietor of " The Age", to be a foremost advocate of Protect ion. He<br />
injected the basic elements of long-lastingiberalism into Victorian politics<br />
and is remembered, not only for what he did to bring Vi ctoria to the<br />
Federation but for his irrigation policies and factory legislation.<br />
His writing was his highroad to politics and in politics he found<br />
his life's work. The British historian F. S. Oliver has aptly described<br />
politics as " the endless adventure of governing men". Deakin was quick to<br />
catch the tide. For him it was a vocation as well as a great adventure.<br />
He was, like Sir Robert Walpole in another century, a<br />
conspicuous example of the man who came at the right time. W alpole, you<br />
will recall, fathered the system of Cabinet Government in the British<br />
Parliament. Deakin was the right man fcr the infant Federation and showed<br />
his superb skill by achieving so much, despite the fact that he headed a<br />
minority party In government during his three terms as Prime Minister. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
He did, in his time, what Walpole did in another way in the eighteenth<br />
century, an immemorial service to democracy by advancing the purpose<br />
and authority of the Parliamentary system.<br />
It was Walpole who governed Britain for a record term of<br />
twenty years as chief minister and gave the House of Commons so much<br />
of the strength once held exclusively by the Crown. It was Deakin who, on<br />
the Australian scene, focussed the thinking of the States and State-minded<br />
people on the institution of the Federal Parliament and on the national issues<br />
that flowed through its corridors. The strength of the Australian<br />
Constitution was there but it needed the eloquence and steadfastness of<br />
Deakin to make it manifest and make a people one.<br />
I find much in common between Walpole and Deakin though<br />
the differences were there too. On V1 alpole I quote from Oliver<br />
" He is the archetype of the normal politician who forces his way<br />
into the highest positions. Hfe had a strong, clear, practical<br />
judgment. He was valiant and steadfast. His crowning merit was<br />
faithfulness to the King he served and his country. Neither fears<br />
nor temptations could ever shake his fidelity.<br />
Deakin was out of the same mould nearly two hundred years<br />
later. Oliver goes on<br />
" At the same time it would be senseless to deny that he ( Walpole)<br />
was a self -seeker, an opportunist, a man without any tincture<br />
of book-learning or philosophy."<br />
Deakin was none of these. His scholarship was plain for all<br />
to see and hear. He took nothing personal from politics and he commanded<br />
respect on both sides of the House.<br />
For all his magnificence as a speaker he seldom tipped his<br />
shafts with venom. He was not ' vindictive. I think the sharpest tongue he<br />
turned on a fellow member was when he once described the late W. M. Hughes<br />
as " behaving like an ill-bred urchin whom one sees dragged from a tart<br />
shop, kicking and screaming as he goes. It was a rare excursion and was not<br />
his usual form. He later apologised for it.<br />
The art of politics has not changed all that much since Walpole's<br />
day or from Deakin's day. But the practice of politics has, and of course<br />
the issues and causes have. The British blend of representative with party<br />
government, from its beginnings, left a politician no choice but to usel~<br />
best endeavours to defeat his opponents and, while that habit is still with us<br />
today, we do it in a rather more sophisticated way. What we are concerned<br />
with are the principles that guide us in power and which govern our conduct<br />
in opposition. This is where we recognise the constancy of Liberalism. It<br />
is a philosophy, with a translation in practical terms into a party platform,<br />
and always matching the contemporary scene.<br />
Gladstone asked and answered the question: " What do I<br />
understand by Liberal principles? I understand in the main, THIS, by<br />
Liberal principles: the principle of trust in the people, only relieved by<br />
prudence. BUT, by the principles of thieir opponents I understand mistrust<br />
ofth pople, only relieved by fear<br />
am talking to an audience largely composed of Liberals </p>
<p>-4<br />
tonight and it is worthwhile us all remembering that the Liberal idea is<br />
permanent, though the forms of expression are shaped to the times in which<br />
we live. We are in the words of our own party platform, " dedicated to<br />
political liberty and the freedom and dignity of man<br />
Deakin wrote " we are liberal always, radical often and<br />
never reactionary". There has inevitably to be change in emphasis according<br />
to the needs of the times. There are today issues of great importance to the<br />
nation which occupy the attention of politicians but they are not of a nature that<br />
attracts radicals or do they call for radical thinking in the terms of those early<br />
years of Federation. There have been changes in our party and in the opposition<br />
forces, and in the Parliament itself. New systems and methods of communication<br />
between the politician and the public have changed our habits and the tasks<br />
which fall on Ministers andi back-benchers alike. But the old values remain.<br />
It is because of the very fact of our pledge to political liberty and indiv.' fAival<br />
freedom that we can absorb change and maintain our identity. Some comparisons<br />
are appropriate. Deakin stood for a two-party system in Parliament, but he<br />
never secured it in his own right. So he sought it, first by negotiation, and then<br />
by fusion. From the outset of Federation he also recognised that the Senate<br />
would be a party house and not a States' House, though it came into being to<br />
satisfy the anxieties of the States who had taken a half -century or more to come<br />
to the point of Commonwealth. Things, then, really haven't changed all that<br />
much. Let me recall the procession of events and the course the<br />
Liberals followed in those early years which eventually gave us the Liberal<br />
party as we know it today. In 1901 the non-Labor parties were largely identified by:<br />
their attitudes to the national issue of Protection as a fiscal policy for the nation.<br />
There were the Liberal Protectionists under Barton and Deakin, and the Free-<br />
Traders under Reid. The Labor Party held the balance of power in the first<br />
Parliament, but it gave sufficient support for the Liberals to govern, with<br />
Reid and his supporters making up the official opposition.<br />
Then, in 1909, with Protection a settled policy for the<br />
nation, the non-Labor forces of Deakin and Reid came together officially as<br />
one party called the Liberal or Fusion party. In 1916, when the Labor<br />
Government split on the issue of conscription, the late W. M. Hughes and others<br />
who supported conscription, were expelled from the party and after attempting<br />
to maintain a shaky Government with the Parliamentary support of the Liberals<br />
for a few weeks they merged officially with the Liberals to form the<br />
Nationalist party. So briefly there was a clear-cut two party system, but in<br />
1919 the Country Party was formed and that party has retained its identity<br />
to this day. The Nationalists were reorganised in 1931 into the<br />
United Australia Party under the late J. A. Lyons, who like Hughes, was a<br />
Labor man who had broken with his party and the Scullin Government, in this<br />
instance, on matters of economic policy during the depression. The U. A. P.<br />
was with us till 1944. That was the year of the re-birth of the Liberal party,<br />
the year when the Liberal Party re-established itself -An name and policy under </p>
<p>the leadership of Sir Robert Menzies. Its policy was broadened to meet the<br />
needs of modern Australia and ; n response to the urge for reform and<br />
rejuvenation from those who had become increasingly dissatisfied with the<br />
limited horizons of the U. A. P. It was closer to the Deakin concept of a<br />
party with a wide appeal, not limited by any of the divisions by wh! ich society<br />
tends to stratify itself.<br />
Deakin was a Prime Minister of minority governments there<br />
were mostly " three, and sometimes four, elevens" in the House of<br />
Representatives. But his skill as a negotiator, his affability, his patience<br />
and the constructive nature of his policies enabled him to secure support,<br />
substantially on his terms, to carry out effective and progressive government.<br />
This gave us a permanent tariff policy, imperial preference, a defence<br />
policy, a Federal legal system, an arbitration system, a basic wage and<br />
age and invalid pensions.<br />
In the Parliament today we have three parties in the House of<br />
Representatives, and we are getting things done because of the way in<br />
which, by our coalition with the Count ry Party, we are able to operate a<br />
two-party system in terms of work and practical politics. The present<br />
coalition has shown durability in the seventeen years of government since<br />
its formation in 1940, although we have competed for votes and although the<br />
role of the Country Party has been affected by the national need to promote<br />
manufacturing industry and as urban growth outruns rural growth.<br />
In the Senate, as you know, we are a long way from effective<br />
two-party government having four parties and two independents or again<br />
in terms of practical politics, three parties when we count the coalition as<br />
one. There is no doubt that the advent of the Democratic Labor Party, as<br />
yet another group, disillusioned in recent times, as others were in the past,<br />
with Labor policy, has influenced attitudes in the electorates -and in the<br />
Parliament, where the party is represented only in the Senate.<br />
There has been little change In the principles the Liberal Party<br />
applies to the conduct of its business and this if I may seem to speak in an<br />
apparent contradiction is why we have been able to adjust smoothly to changes<br />
in the political, economic and social worlds around us.<br />
The party constitution says " Once an endorsed candidate is<br />
elected by the people as a Member of Parliament he represents the whole of<br />
the people in his electorate and is not subject to any directions from the<br />
party's organisation. When he becomes a Member of the Parliamentary<br />
Liberal Party he, with his colleagues, is expected to implement the party's<br />
platform, but is favoured with complete freedom of action without any attempt<br />
to coerce hiim This stands in remarkable contrast to the highly regimented,<br />
sternly disciplined org-anisation of the Labor Party, where policy-makers<br />
outside Parliament dictate what the elected representatives should do and,<br />
furthermore, exclude parliamentary leaders from a vote on policy-making<br />
decisions. In the Liberal formation, the party has policies through which<br />
it expresses its Liberal philosophy. It recommends sometimes strongly<br />
and advises the parliamentary party, but final decisions are in the hands of<br />
the elected members, with Cabinet giving the lead.<br />
To give an example of the freedoms the Liberal Party allows.<br />
In the Parliament, while Senators meet with members of the House of<br />
Representatives i n joint Party meetings, the Senators also hold their own<br />
party meeting to determine their approach to issues in the Senate. And<br />
again, of course, the same individual freedoms apply. Labor, on the other / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
hand, has a single Parliamentary Caucus which determines the actions of<br />
both parties and all their members, In both Houses.<br />
The Liberal Party has its rules, its platform, and a<br />
wide-ranging organisation. You might call it a loosely-knit co-operative,<br />
inside as well as outside the party room and Parliament. There was a<br />
signal demonstration of the liberality of the system recently during the<br />
discussion and debate on the " Voyager" disaster. This was a grave matter,<br />
raised by a Liberal back-bencher and taken freely through the party room and<br />
the Parliament, although the Government had long ago reached a considered<br />
judgment on the issues that were then re-opened.<br />
And while 1 am on this point I would remind you that,<br />
despite criticism of the growth of Cabinet power and its apparent domination<br />
of Parliament, here was an example that the end authority remains with<br />
Parliament in all matters. It is true, however, that the increasing pace of<br />
government, and the number and range of matters that now have to be dealt<br />
with, require positive leadership from the Cabinet and also decisions by the<br />
Cabinet which, in Deakin's day, would have been the subject of long and<br />
exhaustive debate in the Parliament.<br />
The individual parliamentarian has a duty to represent<br />
his electorate, to watch the interests of its people and be responsive to their<br />
needs. He can do that most effectively when his representation fits into the<br />
pattern of stat and national policy. He must, figuratively, lift his sights<br />
from the parish pump to the Snowy Mountains.<br />
There is, to my mind, as clear an obligation on the<br />
Cabinet, as there is on the individual member, to take the responsibility of<br />
leading in matters where new ground has to be broken or where action has to<br />
be taken that has not been the subject of a mandate from the electorate. A<br />
government, in simple terms, is elected first of all to govern and the<br />
greater Information available, by virtue of their office, to those charged with<br />
this task should encourage them to be bold, imaginative and forward-looking.<br />
This is vital for a Federal Government today which has<br />
to give leadership in significant fields not strictly within the constitutional<br />
division of its powers. There is an old judgment, and a true one, that power<br />
tends to move to the centre. Certainly, political responsibility has flowed<br />
that way, although the Federal Parliament is not much larger or its powers<br />
substantially greater. In the first Parliament there were 75 members in the<br />
House of Rperesentatives. There has only been one major increase to 122<br />
in 1949 and a recent submission to referendum for another was rejected by<br />
a large majority. Yet to the business of Federal Government and Parliament<br />
now come the needs of near twelve million people and a weight of extra<br />
responsibilities which include national development, immigration, social<br />
services, education, health, aborigines, civil aviation and tourism.<br />
To deal with the work~ the Ministry has trebled in size<br />
in the last fifty years. Deakin's last Ministry in 1909 was nine strong, with<br />
one Minister without portfolio. Today the Ministry has twenty-six members,<br />
of whom twelve are senior ministers making up the Cabinet.<br />
You might like to have some Budget comparisons not the<br />
one just coming up, for that is the business of my colleague, the Treasurer<br />
but the one produced by the first Deakin Ministry in 1905-6 and the one we<br />
brought down in Canberra last year. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Deakin's first Government raised $ 24 million, spent $ 9 million<br />
and gave $ 15 million back to the States.-<br />
Receipts towards our last Budget were 400 million, of<br />
which me spent 600 million and gave 800 million back to the States.<br />
! n Deakin's Budget, the States got 62 per cent of total receipts, . last year<br />
they got 34 per cent giving substantial evidence of how the responsibilities<br />
and commitments of the Federal Government have grown.<br />
Defence has become a major itern in our Budget nowadays.<br />
In 1938-39, the last year of peace before World War 11, the Federal Budget<br />
was creeping up towards its first Å 100 million figure ($ 200 million) and the<br />
defence provision was 800, 000.<br />
The total Budget topped; 10O million in 1939/ 40 and included<br />
a provision of Å 12 million for defence and war, which in the event grew to<br />
million in the first year of the war. In our last Budget, the defence<br />
provision reached the record level of 000 million.<br />
In brief, spending on defence 30 years ago tock<br />
around 8 per cent of the Budget. ( In Deakin's day it was much the same).<br />
Today defence is taking close on 20 per cent of the Budget.<br />
The first basic, or minimum, wage in 1907 was four dollars<br />
twenty cents a week. Today the minimum wage is thirty-seven dollars<br />
forty-five cents a week.<br />
There are new issues to face today, totally different from the<br />
battle-cry of the Deakin age, and in a different nation and society. We have<br />
absorbed into the British stock from which we sprang, people of forty or<br />
more different nationalities. We are an affluent society, we have full<br />
employment, a total wage system and a prescribed working week.<br />
The Labor Party today has not the industrial issues to support<br />
that it had in other years and in seeking new footholds of power it is, of<br />
necessity, moving towards the centre. The pull of Labor to the left has<br />
lost its momentum and the party is now seeking to invade ground firmly<br />
held by the Liberals, while at the same time being reluctant to jettison its<br />
doctrinaire attachment to socialism, a borrowed philosophy that has not<br />
had any significant revision since 1921 despite all that has happened in<br />
the forty-six years since then!<br />
The issues bef ore us are those of national growth, the welfare<br />
of our people, national security and our place in the international community.<br />
We are deeply committed to the orderly and energetic development of the<br />
rich treasures of this continent, a better education for our young people,<br />
improved health for the population, security for the aged and infirm, the<br />
advance of our technological skills, aid for the under-developed nations,<br />
a strong defence system, fulfilment of our obligations under treaties and<br />
the continuing encouragement of a special relationship with Asia.<br />
These things carry us forward, and others drop away into<br />
the mists. The imperialism of Deakin's time has gone and the " White<br />
Australia" cry from his first platforms does not have the same relevance,<br />
and happily the term is no longer used by us. It is true that we have an<br />
immigration policy with restrictive aspects as do all countries in one form<br />
or another, but it is humanely shaped,<br />
it takes special note of our geographical position in Asia and it has recently / S </p>
<p>8-<br />
been liberalised. Today we have just on 40, 000 people of non-European<br />
origin living in Australia, of whom almost half are now Australian citizens<br />
by bi rth or naturalisation. We are proud of our British heritage, and proud to share it with<br />
these new Australians. While some of the old forms have disappeared, ties<br />
of kinship remain and the traditional institutions of Britain are mirrored in<br />
much of our life today. We have added to this special relationship with<br />
Britain a complementary friendship with America, which too has drawn heavily<br />
on British stock and institutions in the beginnings of its growth to be a mighty<br />
pow'er. Liberalism is not static it belongs to the old world and the<br />
new. In all the movements that have taken place it has been flexible,<br />
pragmatic if you like, and yet it has never lost sight of fundamental<br />
principles. I said earlier that the art of politics had not changed but that the<br />
practice had. One biographer has ifiiminded me that Deakin was the only<br />
Prime Minister of Australia to be summonsed for riding a bicycle on a<br />
footpath. I confess tkat, as Treasurer, I was fined for speeding on the road<br />
from Portsea. Mention of. this makes a point that the pace of politics is faster<br />
today. It is also tougher and more demanding althougH we have new services<br />
at our command. The stresses that took their toll of Deakin have been<br />
replaced by new stresses and no parliamentarian can insulate himself from<br />
them. We live in a jet age and we move into the supersonic age of<br />
flight In three or four years' time. We live in a space age and, when the<br />
orbiting satellites of the two most powerful nations on earth wink overhead<br />
in the night sky as they pass in their endless orbits, few of us spare them a<br />
glance. We live in an age of instantaneous communications and of the<br />
exposure by television of public figures to audiences of millions in almost<br />
every corner of the globe at any one moment in time. We have a new intimacy<br />
with the world. The death of Julius Caesar took two years to become known<br />
throughout the Roman Empire. Today we can speak by telephone to the South<br />
Pole, we can see the shape of the earth on which we live photographed from<br />
outer space. We can see pictures transmitted from the cratered surface of<br />
the moon. In Canada recently when I attended Australia's Day at EXPO 67 in<br />
Montreal I was able to read a facsimile of that day's front page of " The Sun"<br />
newspaper, published here in Melbourne.<br />
These are some of the fascinations of our day and age, but with<br />
their excitements come new pressures on public men. Today a Prime Minister<br />
goes round the world, not " trailing clouds of glory", but trailing a comet's<br />
tail of cablegrams which lengthens as he goes and which keeps him posted with<br />
going ou at home and jui abx eirywhe -else. He flies the jet streams at<br />
33, 000 feet and six hundred miles an hour and can girdle the globe in fifty<br />
hours. He sleeps, if he is lucky, in catnaps. Mostly he is at work on<br />
his papers in flight and at most stopovers he has to face tlepress, radio<br />
and television. He is expected to know what happened at Khatmandu that<br />
very day and " Would he like to comment on what the Leader of the<br />
Opposition said last night". The critics are unforgiving if a loose phrase by<br />
a tired traveller can be taken the wrong way. </p>
<p>-9<br />
He has dinner when he should be having breakfast, and<br />
lunch, perhaps, in a no-man's-land of time above the clouds. He breaks<br />
every known rule for good digestion. It used not to be like that. It took fifty<br />
days to London In a ten-thousand-tonner at the turn of the century and a<br />
travelling pprllamentarian had time to rest, to study his subject, prepare his<br />
brief and be on his mettle for his first engagements. He also had the perfect<br />
excuse, if affairs of state abroad could best be handled by diplomatic absence,<br />
of pleading he couldn't spare the time that would be taken in travelling. Now<br />
it is a case of " Come over for a day or two.<br />
In my foreign journeys, I have travelled many routes,<br />
across the Pacific, through Asia, across the Atlantic, over the Polar ice-cap.<br />
You measure your journey in hours, not weeks, and drive yourself just a<br />
little dizzy by keeping up with the clock changes, especially when you find<br />
yourself flying forward into yesterday! On my last journey I had two Sundays<br />
going over and lost a Wednesday out of my life on the homeward run.<br />
At the beginning of Federation there was really only one<br />
popular route for parliamentarians bound overseas to London and back by<br />
sea. Yet I note from the record that at one Imperial Conference Deakin<br />
attended he was in London for six weeks and ave-Zaged only four hours' sleep<br />
a night. So the pressures obviously were there though the forms were<br />
different. The practice of politics at home was also different. There<br />
was a sharper awareness among the voting public, they had things on their<br />
mind and they wanted something done about them. The class divisions were<br />
clear-cut and there were great causes around every corner. Apart from<br />
organised meetings and street corner addresses, the press was the only<br />
means of political communication. And the press of the day had " fire in its<br />
belly". Newspapers took up opposite positions and saw little compromise.<br />
" The Age" stood for protection and tariffs, " The Argus" stood for free trade.<br />
Political speeches were reported at length and the<br />
reporter, a fast, skilled and knowledgeable fellow, happily inserted his<br />
comments, according to the policy of his paper.<br />
A two-hour election speech of those days would rate ten<br />
minutes on radio or five on TV today. It would rate half an hour on the<br />
platform and half a column of main points in a daily paper. Speeches in the<br />
Parliament of the new Federation were packed with immense detail. Many<br />
ran longer than two hours and on one occasion Deakin spoke for three and one<br />
quarter hours. I shudder to think what would happen to the business of the<br />
House if Members claimed so much of their parliamentary colleagues' time<br />
today. When Deakin made his first election policy speech as<br />
Prime Minister at Ballarat it got six columns of solid type in the daily press.<br />
And the type was smaller and the columns wider than they are today.<br />
I liked the warm and friendly touch of one report of<br />
Deakin's first Eastern States election campaign. He went by train to Sydney<br />
and by carriage to the City Hall, where the " Town Clerk formally welcomed<br />
him over a glass of wine, the Lord Mayor being absent in Melbourne for the<br />
Cup. i Today news reporting of politics is not interlarded with<br />
opinion and it is good that this is so. The opinion is supplied by editorials<br />
and identified commentators. The cover is not as extensive, though major </p>
<p>q 10<br />
policy speeches and Budgets always get extended space. There is no<br />
violent collisbn of newspaper policies as there was in the wilder, colonial<br />
days. The general habit of the press, while broadly liberal or conservative<br />
in its inclinations, is to keep its columns open to other opinions and the<br />
presentation of policies opposed to its own. The press treatment of<br />
politicians is much more an exercise in personal journalism and human<br />
interest than it used to be.<br />
Throughout his Federal political career, even as Prime<br />
Minister, Deakin wrote anonymously for the London " Morning Post" and<br />
for all his familiarity with the press, he remained sensitive to the<br />
harsh light it shed on men in the posts of political power. In his " Federal<br />
Story" he says<br />
" Public life in Australia is impaired by the almost entire absence<br />
of respect for the privacies of official life and for the persons<br />
of those in power. The passion for equality which sways the<br />
multitude contains a spice of envy which encourages the belittling<br />
of even those whom they are delighting to honour. The crowd<br />
always retains to itself the privilege of chastising its gods in<br />
time of adversity while worshipping the m in days of prosperity."<br />
Now it chastises them, even in, aiys of prosperity:<br />
I like Oliver's comments. He says that a politician's critics<br />
claim that " A politician lacks natural intelligence as well as education;<br />
he has no foresight, no constancy of purpose beyond the pursuit<br />
of his own advantage M oralists, idealists, humanitarians<br />
are equally severe. They are shocked by his unveracity, by<br />
the deadness of his soul to all the higher emotions.. he is never<br />
more than a lip-servant of sacred causes and then only when they<br />
happen to be in fashion.<br />
" Soldiers, sailors and country gentlemen are convinced that no-one<br />
who talks so much, and obviously knows so little, about the<br />
conduct of war and the management of land can possibly understand<br />
any department whatsoever of public affairs.<br />
" The great army of company directors, and others of a certain age<br />
whom newspapers describe as ' captains of industry' condemn<br />
him for his lack of practical ability, initiative, push and go; they<br />
suspect him of being a lazy fellow who likes to draw a salary for<br />
doing next to nothing.<br />
" Jingoes denounce him as a traitor if he is not forever plucking<br />
foreign nations by the beard.... pacifists consider him to be the<br />
chief cause of war<br />
" The magnates of the popular press, secure behind their private<br />
telephone entanglements, sneer at his want of courage; and the<br />
man-of -the -world most ingenuous of dotterels takes up the<br />
same tale from his club arm-chair<br />
" What humbug, it is, for the most part, and what a welter should<br />
we be in, if the politicians, taking these lectures to heart, were<br />
to hand over the management of public affairs to their critics"' </p>
<p>11<br />
Ours is a grudging democracy which holds politicians<br />
in low esteem. In the United Kingdom, with its long political tradition,<br />
there is more respect for the office-holder, and he is more likely to be<br />
judged on his merits. In America, the political leader is built into something<br />
larger than life-size and there is disenchantment when it becomes obvious<br />
that the leader cannot live comfortably In the rarefied atmosphere that has<br />
been created for him. In Australia there is a comparative apathy towards<br />
political issues. For example, you do not see the same surge, the same<br />
vitality of political interest in student bodies that you get in other countries.<br />
This, I believe, is because we have moved along ordered lines under the<br />
Constitution, and because we have become an aiflucnt society, with a clear<br />
course ahead of us, comfortably situated in a congenial Pacific environment.<br />
Most contemplate the dangers of our geographical location as casually as<br />
they accept the promise and opportunity opening before us. There are real<br />
dangers in this if we let complacency over-ride the satisfactions of a job<br />
well done. I find great encouragement in the type of young men and<br />
women who are now being attracted to the Liberal Party. There is no " fiery<br />
cross of Federation" ( as Deakin put it) for them to hold aloft and make the<br />
sky bright with its blazing, but they have a challenge to take up. I have<br />
mentioned it earlier and I repeat it now<br />
It is concerned directly with the continuity of good and<br />
responsible government.<br />
II t i s concerned wi th tie growth df Australia and the<br />
development of our new external relationships.<br />
* It is concerned with the preservation of free enterprise<br />
and political liberty.<br />
It is concerned with Australia today, strong and free,<br />
going forward across new horizons.<br />
Our critics have said " Where are the great memorials<br />
to all the years of Liberal rule?" My answer simply is that the nation itself,<br />
and the shape it is in, is the finest memorial of all. The orderly but rapid<br />
national progress in qn environment of political, social and economic<br />
stability; the preservation of liberty, personal freedom and incentive for the<br />
individual; the continui-ty of em, 51lyment, improvement in living standards and<br />
social welfare, the growth in international influence these are some of the<br />
more notable achievements consistently sustained in the years of post-war<br />
Liberal leadership. Australians would do well to recognise the good fortune<br />
we enjoy in a world where so much wretchedness, turbulence and insecurity<br />
persist. We do not wish to be remembered by solitary spectaculars,<br />
but by what we have done to ensure the happiness, prosperity and security<br />
of the people of Australia and to be respected abroad for our policies and<br />
achievements. There are new excitements around us and adventures<br />
to share. The skills of new Australians have been joined to our own. Things<br />
are happening in the cities and on the plains, along the valleys and over the / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
mountains. From the gold and the wool and the wheat of Deakin's day, we<br />
have spread our energies and our initiatives very widely indeed.<br />
We can make most things that others can make; we<br />
have found oil and we are taking gas from the sea. The immensity of our<br />
recently discovered mineral resources and the rapid start with their<br />
development is helping to shape a new order of growth.<br />
We can travel through the old kingdoms and former<br />
colonies of Asia and we number among them more friends than most European<br />
nations can count. This is the wider world in which we have to live now, and<br />
we take our place in it with confidence, secure in the knowledge that the<br />
Federation, the Commonwealth of Australia that Deakin did so much to<br />
establish, has strength and that its people are proud of their great inheritance.<br />
There is one final matter I want to put before you<br />
because it will be of critical importance to all of us in the years ahead. I<br />
refer to defence and the British Government's historic decision to make a<br />
total military withdrawal from the mainland of ' South-East Asia by the<br />
We are facing fundamental changes in our defence<br />
strategy and in our foreign policy. For some time now we have had under<br />
active examination the alternatives for Australia in the event that Britain<br />
should decide upon the course its Government has now declared. In o~ ur<br />
planning we take account of the interests and capabilities of our friends in<br />
this area and elsewhere. It is appropriate to remind you that our defence and<br />
our security are covered by two parallel defence lines in the Pacific and<br />
South-East Asia. The first line is one of friendships, trade and aid<br />
over the whole area. Our trade has increased by loseon f pr cenwflth<br />
Asia in recent years but much of it has been with Japan. We must diversify<br />
this effort so that we can help the economy of Asian nations to become viable<br />
and so assist them to develop their own defences.<br />
We are giving 0. 7 per cent, of our national income to<br />
external aid and in this we rank second in percentage terms after France,<br />
among the aid-giving nations of the world. At this time, the average level<br />
of world aid for the needy nations is declining and nations like America and<br />
Britain are reducing the relative percentage they give. Australia on the other<br />
hand is still increasing her level of aid.<br />
Already we are associated with every established<br />
international aid-giving organisation of any substance and we are giving our<br />
aid without strings. Our traffic in friendship is also increasing. As your<br />
Prime Minister, I have been to Asia three times in 20 months and my Ministers<br />
have been in the aggregate many more times than that. A cultural exchange<br />
programme with South-East Asia in due course will, also, I hope add to<br />
goodwill and understanding. All these things are elements in the first line of<br />
defence. The second line of defence is one covered by treaties / 13 </p>
<p>13-<br />
with friendly powers and includes currently a military capability in South-<br />
East Asia. We have been associated with Britain for many years past in the<br />
Commonwealth area of Malaysia and Singapore. Yet this is not the only<br />
forward post we are manning or where our only interests lie and I need not<br />
tell you how vital it is to us that the cause for which we are fighting in support<br />
of the United States and other allies in Vietnam should be sustained until an<br />
honourable peace is won. It would be wrong for me at this stage to attempt<br />
to indicate to you what the new shape of our military defence line will be,<br />
but I want to say this. The two defence lines that we have are of vital<br />
importance to us. Their strength is a responsibility that a Government has<br />
to assume for the people who have placed it in power. It is a responsibility<br />
falling sqtnrely on a sovereign, independent nation<br />
In the first days of Federation, Alfred Deakin fought<br />
stoutly for an Australian Navy. He urged the formation of a permanent<br />
Australian military force and for compulsory national service to support<br />
those forces. He foresaw the tasks that one day must come to a young nation<br />
in the Pacific and Asian areas. We face them now. There is no turning<br />
aside from our geography nor must there be any turning aside from what we<br />
Liberals conceive to be Australia's national destiny. </p>
