STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ON PUBLIC SERVICE REFORMS<br />
SEPTEMBER 1986<br />
Today I wish to announce a range of decisions taken by the<br />
Government to give'effect to our commitment to improve the<br />
efficiency of the public sector.<br />
These decisions are an essential part of the restructuring<br />
of the Australian economy which has been made necessary by<br />
the decline of international commodity prices and their<br />
consequent effects on our economic circumstances. That<br />
restructuring must involve all sectors of the Australian<br />
economy including the public sector.<br />
No modern economy trading in world markets can survive<br />
without a strong integrated Public Service, capable of<br />
assisting and facilitating industries to achieve national<br />
economic objectives. The Australian Public Service must be<br />
able to take its place in the rebuilding of our<br />
manufacturing and industrial sectors required by Australia's<br />
present economic and social circumstances and our national<br />
aspirations.<br />
A vital ingredient of this process is that Public Service<br />
management must also improve. I have spent a good deal of<br />
time in recent months, not infrequently in blunt terms,<br />
exhorting Australia's private sector managers to improve, to<br />
do better. Government expects the same of its own managers..<br />
The Public Service has, in many ways, reflected the easy<br />
going ' she'll-be-right-mate', management and work style of<br />
the lucky Australia of the 60s and 70s. we can afford this<br />
no longer.<br />
Through its 1984 reforms, the Government has provided<br />
considerable flexibility, independence and professional<br />
opportunities to its senior management. It now expects to<br />
receive a return on that investment. It expects the powers<br />
given to departmental Secretaries in respect of<br />
non-performing staff to be used. It expects its most senior<br />
management to take a tough, hard nosed look-at performance<br />
at all levels of the Public Service. It looks to senior<br />
management to take tough decisions about public servants who<br />
are not performing.<br />
Yesterday the Government started a process between employers<br />
and unions in the private sector to examine management<br />
practices and work practices which are constraining<br />
Australia's competitiveness. That process, which is now<br />
underway in the private sector, must be matched in the<br />
public sectcr.<br />
It is a simple fact that, in common with many other<br />
industries, the Public Service has traditionally enjoyed<br />
work practices that the country can no longer afford.<br />
Whilst Government has taken some positive steps already,<br />
much more is required to be done. </p>
<p>I would ash public servants particularly to understand this.<br />
The Government is keenly aware of the cynicism which exists<br />
within and without the Public Service about this sort of<br />
exercise. The Public Service has been subjected,<br />
particularly by our predecessors, to a series of exercises<br />
aimed at cheap political advantage by maligning public<br />
servants, which has generated a good deal of uncertainty and<br />
hardship, and some animus, but which has achieved nothing.<br />
I would ask that such cynicism be put aside. This is not a<br />
Public Service bashing exercise. It is not a negative<br />
exercise. It is about making a good Public Service even<br />
better. And that is about building a better Australia.<br />
Those who work for Government must in turn make Government<br />
work as efficiently as possible for Australia.<br />
many employment groups around the country are making choices<br />
between traditional practices and future economic<br />
prosperity. Neatly all are choosing the latter and those<br />
who argue -or the former do so at great personal cost.<br />
Those who work for Government now face the same choice; I<br />
have faith they will have the wisdom to make the same<br />
positive aecision.<br />
Madam Speaker<br />
The Government has decided:<br />
First, to establish an efficiency scrutiny unit, to be<br />
headed by a senior private sector representative to<br />
underta~ ce an extensive program of scrutiny of public<br />
sector operations.<br />
Secon: S, departments and agencies will, in future be<br />
required to cut their administrative expenses each year<br />
for on-going activities and, Madam Speaker, they will be<br />
required to declare the savings so that the Government<br />
of the day can decide how they can best be utilised.<br />
Third, there will be major changes in the arrangements<br />
for the redeployment or retrenchment of inefficient and<br />
surplus staff. Special protection will be retained<br />
against political victimisation. But inefficient public<br />
servants will be treated the same way as are inefficient<br />
workers in the private sector. In short, public<br />
servan~ s are no longer immune from dismissal.<br />
Fourth, the Government will proceed within a few months<br />
to simp~ lify and integrate the complex job classification<br />
distinctions which currently exist in the Public Service<br />
office structure. New technology has made these<br />
distinctions obsolete. The review might well become the<br />
largest single restructuring of occupations in the<br />
Public Service ever undertaken.<br />
Fifth, there will be a number of management changes<br />
designed to make public service personnel management<br />
more e~ ficient and effective. </p>
<p>Sixth, flextime will be reviewed, with the objective of<br />
eliminating abuses but maintaining the advantages of the<br />
system for both departments and employees.<br />
These changes mean that Government will be making less<br />
demand on the public purse, which in turn means that the<br />
taxpayers will be saving more. At a time when the<br />
Government is being called upon to perform greater services<br />
for some sections of the community this means, simply, doing<br />
more with less. it means that those working in Government<br />
now face the same challenge as their colleagues in the<br />
private sector : working harder, working smarter, and giving<br />
greater value for money.<br />
I now turn to explain the changes in detail.<br />
EFFICIENCY SCRUTINY UNIT<br />
The Department of' Finance and the Public Service Board<br />
already administer a number of programs designed to bring<br />
about improvements in the management of all Departments and<br />
agencies. But the Gcv~ rnment sees value in a further initiative to<br />
encourage improvements in the management and administrative<br />
procedures in much of the public sector. It will do this by<br />
establishing an Efficiency Scrutiny Unit, similar to that<br />
which has eXisted in the United Kingdom since 1979 initially<br />
headed by Sir Derek Rayner. The key elements of its<br />
operations will be as follows:<br />
A small unit of up to seven people will be established<br />
under a senior private sector representative to oversee<br />
an extensive program to scrutinise selected areas of<br />
public sector administration. There may be additional<br />
private sector members of the Unit, and the remainder<br />
will be drawn from within existing Public Service<br />
resources. The Unit will operate for a finite period of<br />
three y'ears;<br />
The Head of the unit will report directly to me and,.<br />
through Lie, to the Expenditure Review Committee of<br />
Cabinet, The Unit will have responsibility, in<br />
consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies,<br />
for advising us on the terms of reference and<br />
methodolcgy for the scrutinies, for monitoring their<br />
conduct, and for advising on subsequent recommendations<br />
and their implementation;<br />
The scrutinies will be carried out by staff of the<br />
relevant Departments and agencies, and their ministers<br />
will be involved at all stages of the process. The<br />
scrutinies will be co-operative ventures. The detailed<br />
procedures, and an initial program, will be settled in<br />
consultations between Ministers, senior* Department<br />
officials and the Unit. I expect the Unit to be fully<br />
operational by early 1987; </p>
<p>Each scrutiny will take place over a maximum of around<br />
three months and action to implement their findings will<br />
be expected to be completed within 12 months or in many<br />
cases less;<br />
In order to provide an incentive for Departments and<br />
agencies to co-operate fully in the scrutinies, they<br />
will he entitled to retain 25 per cent of the savings<br />
achieved for staff development, acquisition of improved<br />
technology and other means of further enhancing<br />
efficiency and improving productivity.<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit<br />
will be hoaded by Mr David Block, A. O. who has had a wealth<br />
of experience in the financial sector. Mr Block is<br />
currently a strategic adviser to Coopers and Lybrand, is a<br />
member of the Board of CSR and Chairman or Director of a<br />
number of other public companies. He is the Chairman of the<br />
Sydney Opera House Trust and a fellow of the University of<br />
Sydney, and was formerly a member of the Mathews Committee<br />
of Inquiry into Inflation and Taxation.<br />
we would expect the greater efficiency achieved by this<br />
innovation t1o be reflected in savings to the taxpayer.<br />
Indeed in the case of the United Kingdom Scrutiny Program,<br />
it is now estimated that over a seven year period aggregate<br />
savings of approximately 900 million pounds have been<br />
achieved, with annual running costs in the civil service now<br />
some 300 nillion pounds ( or 2.3 per. cent) less than they<br />
otherwise would have been.<br />
Above all, the decision to establish the Efficiency Scrutiny<br />
Unit is a recognition that the present economic climate<br />
requires the public sector to review systematically and in a<br />
quite func~ aLental way, its management and administrative<br />
procedures, having regard to best private sector practice.<br />
OTHER MEASURES TO ENHANCE FINANCIAL EFFICIENCY<br />
In addition to the establishment of the Efficiency Scrutiny<br />
Unit, the Gcvernment is also to adopt a range of other<br />
measures to enhance efficiency, building upon previous<br />
initiatives in the Financial Management Improvement Program,<br />
Program Budcgeting and the Performance Management Review<br />
Programs. First; to encourage more economical and efficient use ' of<br />
funds provided to them, Departments and agencies will be<br />
permitted, in effect, to carry over unused administrative<br />
funds from one year to the next, subject to a limit on the<br />
amount of carryover. This will remove the incentive to try<br />
to spend all remaining funds at the end of each financial<br />
year, and should result in a more rational and efficient<br />
allocation of resources. Departments and agencies also will<br />
be given greater freedom to move funds between their<br />
Salaries and Administrative Expenses votes, where this would<br />
lead to greater efficiency. </p>
<p>Second, a series of studies is underway to determine the<br />
scope for extending user-charging between Departments, as an<br />
incentive to greater economy in the use Of goods and<br />
services.<br />
Third, the Government will in future require efficiency<br />
improvements to be reflected substantially in reduced<br />
demands on taxpayers' resources. In the past, resources<br />
freed by improvements in efficiency have usually been<br />
retained by Departments and agencies to improve the quality<br />
of services, to provide new services, or to improve working<br />
conditions. The Government of the day has not always been<br />
in a position to consider the most appropriate use of the<br />
funds. In future the Government will specify how these<br />
freed resources are to be used.<br />
As part of this process, Departments and agencies will be<br />
required to achieve real reductions in the running costs of<br />
on-going activities something like the payment of an<br />
efficiency dividend of which the Australian taxpayer will be<br />
the ultimate recipient. They will be required to reduce the<br />
real level of resources directed to administer existing<br />
activities by an average 1 per cent each year over the next<br />
three years, starting in 1987-88.<br />
The Governmeont expects the scrutiny process will be a<br />
considerablo aid to departmental managers in achieving the<br />
dividend required, and in identifying opportunities for<br />
greater efficiency in terms of their own priorities.<br />
The " effici-ency dividend" requirement reflects the<br />
Government's view that the benefits of previous measures to<br />
improve efficiency and productivity can and should lead to<br />
lower costs.<br />
Particularly in the improved managerial environment being<br />
developed, all government agencies should be able to make<br />
continuing efficiency gains by improving their<br />
administrative procedures, making better use of improvements<br />
in technoloC~ y and in the use of human resources.<br />
Account wfll. continue to be taken of changing resource<br />
requirements resulting from changed workloads and functions.<br />
As well, n~ ajor investments in new technology will be<br />
required to achieve improvements in efficiency over and<br />
above the " efficiency dividend".<br />
THE SIZE 0? THE PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
As an initial step in reaping the benefits of past<br />
efficiency improvements, the Government has also acted in<br />
this year's Budget. to realise a general saving of 0.5 per<br />
cent in average staffing levels of departments and agencies.<br />
As already announced in the Budget, as a result of these<br />
processes and some specific staffing decisions, average<br />
staffing levels for 1986-87 will rise by only 0.3 per cent<br />
above the average level for 1985-86, excluding the effects </p>
<p>of the Census and the additional component for youth<br />
trainees. This outcome will continue the moderation of the<br />
growth in staff numbers which has already been reduced<br />
steadily from about 4.5 per cent in 1983-84 to 1.2 per cent<br />
in 1985-86. During the course of 1986-87 there will be a<br />
resultant decline of some 2,000 in the number of public<br />
servants. As Departments and agencies submit staffing plans which<br />
indicate how this reduction is to be achieved, the staffing<br />
freeze announced on 30 June is being progressively lifted.<br />
Agencies, other than those few approved for growth, have<br />
been informed that their plans should generally assume a<br />
further one per cent reduction in staffing in 1987-88.<br />
It is not correct, as some critics have suggested, that<br />
Australia has a special problem in relation to the numbers<br />
of its public servants. The latest ABS statistics indicate<br />
that employment in general government activities as a<br />
proportion of total employment in Australia is about the<br />
OECD average. The Australian Public Service constitutes<br />
only about 15 per cent of general Commonwealth, State and<br />
Local Govornment employment. Nevertheless, it is essential<br />
that its numbers be held to the minimum required to carry<br />
out Government programs efficiently and equitably.<br />
The measurces which I have outlined represent a series of<br />
initiatives for on-going improvements in efficiency. They<br />
are intended to slow down and then reverse the previously<br />
inexorable growth in the resources used in public<br />
administration. CHANGES IN DEALING WITH INEFFICIENT AND SURPLUS STAFF<br />
The Government has decided to make important changes to<br />
personnel aianagement practices to ensure that public sector<br />
managers are not unnecessarily constrained, while ensuring<br />
proper protection for staff against unfair treatment.<br />
Public servants have the right to be protected against<br />
arbitrary or unfair dismissal. But they do not have the<br />
right to continued employment where there is no real wor~ k<br />
for them to do, or where they are not performing<br />
satisfactorily. The exist,' ng arrangements for redeploying and retiring staff<br />
for whom there is insufficient work, or who are working well<br />
below standard, are complex, slow and ineffective.<br />
This state of affairs is unacceptable to the Government.<br />
The measures being announced today will rationalise<br />
significantly these arrangements. </p>
<p>Legislative Changes<br />
The CE( RR) Act has not provided a satisfactory basis for<br />
the redeployment and retirement of staff. It is<br />
unnecessarily complex; it does not provide for<br />
voluntary retrenchment; it provides too many stages of<br />
appeal; its potential for providing a Commonwealth<br />
employment wide redeployment system has not been<br />
realised; it requires redeployment to be considered in<br />
cases where this is manifestly inappropriate, as in some<br />
inefficiency cases.<br />
There is no good reason for matters of redundancy,<br />
ineffliciency and invalidity to be dealt with in<br />
legislation separate from that covering other aspects of<br />
personnel management. we will, therefore, repeal the<br />
CE( RR) Act. Streamlined provisions for redeployment and<br />
retirement will be included in the Public Service Act,<br />
and we will pursue discussions with the public service<br />
union~ s on complementary changes in industrial awards.<br />
The Public Service Act will be amended to give the<br />
Public Service Board a general power to transfer staff<br />
withih the Public Service in the interests of the<br />
efficient management of the Service. The Board will<br />
also have power to transfer staff automatically to<br />
another Commonwealth body where there is an agreed<br />
transfer of functions from the Public Service to that<br />
body.<br />
( ii) Inefficient Staff<br />
The present processes for dealing with inefficient staff<br />
are cum,-bersome and lengthy, and they discourage Public<br />
Service managers from acting other than in the most<br />
blatant cases. These processes are to be revised so<br />
that, viiile the employee is protected both from<br />
arbitrary and politically-motivated dismissal, it will<br />
be possible for management to move quickly to remove an<br />
inefficient employee.<br />
The Secretary of a Department will be able to retire<br />
staff from the Service when, after they have been warned<br />
and given an opportunity to improve their performance,<br />
the Secretary is satisfied that they have remained<br />
ineff-' ient. This will be done after the possibilities<br />
o~ f tronsfer to another job, or of reduction in status,<br />
have been considered. The various appeal processes that<br />
are now available have been consolidated into a single<br />
appeal right, which will protect staff against<br />
victimisation. It is essential in the public sector to protect staff<br />
against loss of jobs on political grounds if a<br />
non-partisan Public Service is to be maintained, and<br />
thus it is essential to maintain a formal appeal<br />
mechanism. Apart from this, processes to deal with<br />
inefficiency will be comparable to the normal personnel<br />
practices pursued by better-managed large employers in<br />
the private sector. </p>
<p>managers will also have greater powers to defer the<br />
payments of annual increments to staff not performing<br />
satisfactorily, and discipline practices will also be<br />
streamlined. Details will be provided when the<br />
legislation is introduced.<br />
( iii) Surplus Staff<br />
When Public Service units or functions are abolished or<br />
reduced in size, this may result in a situation where<br />
there are surplus staff for whom no new placements are<br />
readily available. The present arrangements for<br />
redeploying or retiring such staff are extremely<br />
lengthy. They contain a number of appeal points, and<br />
they may result in long periods when staff are<br />
underemployed. Existing awards provide for a union veto<br />
on " fast track" voluntary retirements.<br />
while many * of these arrangements were introduced to<br />
protect staff from arbitrary dismissal, the Government<br />
believes that adequate protection can still be provided,<br />
while greatly streamlining and simplifying these<br />
procpsses, and reducing the cost to the taxpayer.<br />
where a staff surplus is likely to arise, discussions<br />
will be held between the relevant Department Secretary<br />
and union representatives. After considering possible<br />
redeployment to other positions at the same level, staff<br />
with poor redeployment prospec * ts will be offered, with<br />
Public Service Board approval, a lump sum termination<br />
benefit ( similar to that recently paid to Department of<br />
Defence personnel in defence factories) if they agree to<br />
voluntary retrenchment. Thus it is expected that<br />
redundancy situations can be resolved within about two<br />
months, as compared with a year or more under the<br />
present procedures.<br />
Effor-ts will continue to be made to place any surplus<br />
staff who do not opt for voluntary retrenchment, but<br />
their period of entitlement to income maintenance<br />
( either six or twelve months) will begin from the date<br />
of the voluntary offer. Staff leaving the Public<br />
Service during this period will no longer be entitled,<br />
as at present, to such income maintenance. Where<br />
efforts to redeploy surplus staff at the same level are<br />
unsuccessful, they will be redeployed to a lower level<br />
or retrenched. Unlike the present system of multiple<br />
appeals, this will be the only point at which ani appeal<br />
can be lodged on the grounds that the decision was<br />
unreasonable.<br />
( iv) Invalidity<br />
The Government is concerned about the incidence of<br />
invalidity retirement under the Commonwealth<br />
Superannuation Scheme. The processes applying to<br />
invalidity retirement need to ensure that hardships are<br />
not created for incapacitated staff, who have urgent </p>
<p>need for income support. But they should at the same<br />
time encourage the development of good occupational<br />
health practices, which could avert some of the<br />
invalidity retirements that now occur, and discourage<br />
both management and staff from accepting too readily an<br />
invalidity retirement rather than continued employment.<br />
on 17 April this year the Minister for Finance<br />
foreshadowed the adoption of a number of measures<br />
desi gned to contain the rate of invalidity retirements<br />
and related costs to the Commonwealth. The Government<br />
has decided to introduce a number of these measures.<br />
Secretaries of Departments, with the Public Service<br />
Board, will retain powers to retire staff on invalidity<br />
grounds and Secretaries will also have the power to<br />
transfer them to other duties, including at a lower<br />
classification. The Board may also use its powers to<br />
transfer such staff to another Department. Furthermore,<br />
in future, invalidity pensioners under the Commonwealth<br />
Superannuation Scheme are to be required to report any<br />
employment, and pensions will be adjusted where annual<br />
earnings exceed limits to be prescribed. The extensive<br />
procoesses related to invalidity retirement will also be<br />
simplified.<br />
Provisions for invalidity retirement for Statutory<br />
Authorities will be considered for amendment to make<br />
them consistent with Public Service Act provisions. In<br />
the rtian time, Ministers will require authorities within<br />
their oortfolio responsibilitibs to take rigorous steps<br />
to contain invalidity retirements.<br />
OTHER CEHAWGES IN PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT<br />
Promo -ions<br />
Promotions in the Public Service are based on merit, and<br />
there is no longer any reference to seniority in the<br />
Public Service Act. The promotions system is designed<br />
to select the best person for a vacancy, and to ensure<br />
that decisions made are patently fair.<br />
It is important that merit and fairness remain paramount<br />
consicicrations but, within these parameters, the<br />
Governent has decided that the promotion and associated<br />
appea. systems are unnecessarily lengthy, costly and<br />
rest:. Ictive.<br />
The Government has decided that measures must be taken<br />
to reduce the costs and time involved in awarding<br />
promotions. In the 1984 reforms selection criteria were<br />
altered, and promotion appeals were abolished for the<br />
Senior Executive Service on the grounds that these were<br />
managerial positions where a right of appeal was<br />
consfidered inappropriate. Appeals will now be abolished<br />
against promotions to positions above<br />
Cler4 ' cal/ Administrative Class 8 ( and equivalent grades<br />
in other occupations). The Government considers that </p>
<p>these positions are also largely managerial and thus<br />
appeal rights are also inappropriate. This fits in with<br />
current practices such as the overtime barrier which<br />
distinguish these positions from lower level positions.<br />
Instead there will be access to a grievance review under<br />
the Merit Protection and Review Agency, which will have<br />
the powier to recommend the annulment of the promotion by<br />
the Secretary if it finds that proper procedures have<br />
not been followed, or the decision has been<br />
discriminatory or one of patronage. The relevant<br />
provisions defining these circumstances will be<br />
strengthened. For grades below this level appeals processes will be<br />
significantly streamlined. Promotion Appeal Committees<br />
will be able to disregard frivolous or vexatious<br />
appeals, to undertake a level of enquiry appropriate to<br />
each case and to require parties to submit documentation<br />
by a specifipd time. The appeal period will be reduced,<br />
and the right of appeal will be limited to those who had<br />
originally applied for the job. Currently the appeal<br />
system acts more as a dual selection system with appeals<br />
availsible to all lower ranked officers whether or not<br />
they applied for the position involved.<br />
Greater use, at first for a trial period of twelve<br />
months, will be made of Joint Selection Committees<br />
chaired by nominees of the Merit Protection and Review<br />
Agency for bulk promotions. Th ' ere will be no appeals<br />
against promotions where decisions are unanimous and<br />
where the Secretary accepts the advice of these<br />
committees. The definition of efficiency in the Public Service Act<br />
will be broadened to allow managers to take into account<br />
the potential of staff for future development, and their<br />
capability to perform a variety of jobs at the same<br />
level when deciding on promotions. This will enable<br />
more realistic promotion decisions, and greater<br />
management flexibility in the deployment of staff.<br />
Other elements of the selection process will also be<br />
streamlined, and selection decisions will be excluded<br />
from the requirement to formally state reasons under<br />
section 1.3 of the Administrative Decisions ( judicial<br />
Review) Act.<br />
At the request of the Government, the Chairman of the<br />
Public Service Board has written to all Secretaries of<br />
Departments and Heads of Statutory Authorities<br />
indicating the Government's grave concern at the<br />
inefficiencies resulting from delays currently occurring<br />
in the appointment process, and that Departments and<br />
agencies are expected to improve significantly their<br />
performance in this area, to reduce within six months<br />
the average time for appointments by half. </p>
<p>( ii) Higher Duties<br />
The Government recognises that Departments and agencies<br />
need to fill positions on a temporary basis. But it<br />
believes that many of the current provisions for<br />
selecting and paying staff to perform higher duties are<br />
unwarranted, unnecessarily complex, and costly.<br />
Selection procedures for temporary higher duties will be<br />
simplified by allowing Departments to select the most<br />
suitable officer available, having regard to operational<br />
requirements. Appeals against such selections will be<br />
abolished, unless the period of acting extends beyond<br />
three months. Departments and agencies will be required<br />
to keep long-term acting arrangements to a minimum, and<br />
this will be closely monitored.<br />
Existing remuneration provisions for temporary<br />
performance have encouraged staff to expect additional<br />
paymeont fore performance of any higher functions beyond<br />
their normal duties. Higher duties allowance is too<br />
often paid automatically where the payment is not<br />
justified. The Government will, therefore, examine<br />
opti"' Ons for limiting the incidence and extent of payment<br />
of higher duties allowance, including possible financial<br />
disciplines which would encourage departments to limit<br />
the extent of payments of higher duties allowances.<br />
( iii) Delegation of Central Personnel Functions<br />
The Public Service Board has delegated progressively<br />
many of its powers and functions to Departments.<br />
However, in response to the Government's commitment to<br />
achieve a more streamlined Public Service, the Board<br />
will now initiate further delegation of its activities,<br />
particularly in areas of personnel management and<br />
employment conditions. Clear guidance will be given to<br />
Departments and agencies to encourage efficiency and<br />
desirable personnel and management practices.<br />
The Government believes it should continue to set<br />
examples in areas of equality of opportunity in<br />
employment and participation in decision-making<br />
pract4 ' ces. Experience shows that effective equal<br />
employment opportunity legislation, particularly at an<br />
early stage, needs effective monitoring, but this can be<br />
, done without generating excessive paperwork. Changes<br />
will be made to reporting requirements for both<br />
industrial democracy and equal employment opportunity<br />
proqrvms. The obligations on those Departments<br />
performing well are reduced, while monitoring will<br />
concentrate on Departments which are not adequately<br />
fulfilling their statutory obligations. The Board will<br />
retain responsibility for ensuring that all Departments<br />
fulfil these obligations.<br />
( iv) Jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commi ss ion </p>
<p>The Government does not propose to limit the<br />
jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
commission in relation to public sector employees. It<br />
believes, however, that areas of personnel management<br />
decision making which are already governed by a code of<br />
personnel practice legislated by Parliament, and overall<br />
resource allocation for Government employment subject to<br />
Budget decisions, should not be the subject of detailed<br />
consideration in awards of the Commission. It will,<br />
should the need arise, argue this view vigorously before<br />
the Commission.<br />
Flextime<br />
The Public Service Board will conduct a review of<br />
flextime. The review, which the Government hopes to<br />
conduct with the full participation of the ACTU, will be<br />
charged with eliminating abuses, while maintaining as<br />
far as possible the advantages of the system to both<br />
Departments' and staff.<br />
IMPLEMENTATION<br />
Many of the measures I have referred to will require<br />
legislation, and others will require detailed guidelines and<br />
procedures. In those cases requiring only administrative<br />
action, I have asked the Public Service Board to proceed as<br />
a matter of urgency.<br />
APPLICATION TO STATUTORY BODIES<br />
These changes to staffing processes apply only to staff<br />
employed under the Public Service Act. Those statutory<br />
bodies not staffed under the Public Service Act will be<br />
given separate consideration, reflecting the diverse<br />
circumstances in which they operate.<br />
I have now written to all Ministers asking them to undertake<br />
consultations with relevant Statutory Authorities. We will<br />
be looking to making early progress towards achieving<br />
reforms to staffing processes similar to those covered in<br />
this statement. These reviews will also encompass work<br />
practices wihich stand in the way of greater efficiency.<br />
REVIEW OF CHANGES<br />
The Government will review the various changes within<br />
personnel management practices in twelve months, and make<br />
any further adjustments that are necessary in the light of<br />
experience with the new provisions.<br />
The Government has consulted as fully as possible with the<br />
public sector unions in the development of the initiatives<br />
announced today, and will continue to do so in the<br />
implementation phase, on the basis that the participation of<br />
the unions continues to be constructive. The Government is<br />
aware that not all of what it has decided has met with union<br />
agreement or consent. It expects the unions and their </p>
<p>members to join with the Government in its determination to<br />
make the reforms effective and enduring in their impact, for<br />
the greater good of this country.<br />
CONCLUSION The changes that I have announced today will lead to a<br />
leaner, more efficient public sector. The changes in the<br />
administration of the tenure provisions, and other changes<br />
in personnel practices, constitute a major and radical<br />
overhaul of the personnel management system of the Public<br />
Service of the sort that previous Governments have not been<br />
prepared to undertake. Some of the benefits to the taxpayer<br />
will be immediate, in terms of the reduction in the size of<br />
the Public Service and savings in administrative costs.<br />
Others will be achieved in the medium-term, as the<br />
" efficiency dividend" requirement and the work of the<br />
Efficiency Scrutiny Unit take effect, as well as the<br />
service-wide reforms to which I have just referred.<br />
I am confident that public sector employees will accept<br />
that, at a time when all sections of the Australian<br />
community are being asked to make adjustments to a harsher<br />
economi. c environment, the way in which they function should<br />
have maximum regard for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.<br />
For its part, the Government is firmly committed to such an<br />
outcome. Printed by C. J. Ttiomrs-.. % Co-mmonwealth Government Printer. Ca nberra </p>
