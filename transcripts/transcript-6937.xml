41 ) AUS RLIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
TENTH ANNIVERSARY DINNER<br />
MAY 1986<br />
I AM DELIGHTED, AT LAST, TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADD,<br />
IN PERSON, MY TRIBUTE TO NEVILLE WRAN, HIS GOVERNMENT AND<br />
THE NEW SOUTH WALES BRANCH OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, AS<br />
WE CELEBRATE THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
ELECTION ON 1 MAY 1976.<br />
I SAY ' AT LAST', BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO BE PRESENT ON THE<br />
EARLIER OCCASIONS AT WHICH SO MANY, NOT ONLY FRIENDS AND<br />
SUPPORTERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, BUT CITIZENS FROM<br />
ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, JOINED IN THE CELEBRATION OF<br />
A TRULY HISTORIC EVENT AND REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT.<br />
AND WHILE I CERTAINLY REGRET THAT OTHER OFFICIAL COMMITMENTS<br />
PREVENTED ME FROM BEING PRESENT ON THOSE GREAT OCCASIONS,<br />
THERE IS HOWEVER, AN ADDED SIGNIFICANCE TO THIS PARTICULAR<br />
OCCASION TONIGHT.<br />
FIRSTLY, IT BECOMES EVEN MORE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO SPEAK IN<br />
TERMS OF THE NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PAST TEN YEARS IN<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES ITS IMPORTANCE FOR THE LABOR PARTY<br />
THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE WHOLE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA AND FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
AND ABOVE ALL, ONE MONTH INTO THE SECOND DECADE OF THE WRAN<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT, WE CAN LOOK AHEAD AND IN CELEBRATING THE<br />
LAST TEN YEARS, THINK AHEAD FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS.<br />
AND I SAY WITHOUT HESITATION THAT IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF<br />
THE EXPERIENCE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST TEN YEARS, HERE<br />
IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AND FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS OF A GREAT<br />
NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP, THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT<br />
TEN YEARS WITH CONFIDENCE CONFIDENCE THAT WHAT WE HAVE<br />
BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE TOGETHER IN THOSE YEARS HAS LAID STRONG<br />
AND ENDURING FOUNDATIONS FOR WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE,<br />
TOGETHER, FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEW SOUTH WALES AND FOR THE<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA IN THE YEARS AHEAD.<br />
TO MEASURE PROPERLY THE NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WRAN<br />
ACHIEVEMENT, YOU ONLY HAVE TO RECALL THE DATE, THE TIME, OF<br />
THAT ELECTION TEN YEARS AGO THE FIRST OF MAY 1976. </p>
<p>IT WAS OF COURSE LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER THE GREAT<br />
TRAGEDY AND GREAT CATASTROPHE OF 1975.<br />
I WONDER HOW MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM REALLY BELIEVED THAT IT<br />
WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ELECT A LABOR GOVERNMENT ANYWHERE IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, MUCH LESS IN ITS MOST POPULOUS STATE, IN THE<br />
ATMOSPHERE AND MOOD OF THOSE TIMES?<br />
YET IT HAPPENED; AND THE REST IS HISTORY.<br />
AND IT HAPPENED, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, BECAUSE OF THE<br />
FAITH, PURPOSE, DEDICATION AND DETERMINATION OF ONE MANNEVILLE<br />
WRAN.<br />
AND IT WAS ONE OF THAT HANDFUL OF EVENTS IN RECENT TIMES,<br />
THAT CAN BE TRULY SAID TO HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN HISTORY.<br />
AND ITS CHIEF EFFECT, BEYOND ITS IMPACT IN NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
ITSELF, WAS TO GALVANIZE AND REVITALISE THE LABOR PARTY<br />
THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
IN THESE DAYS OF OUR ELECTORAL ASCENDANCY, IT IS DIFFICULT<br />
TO RECALL THE DESPAIR AND FRUSTRATION OF EARLY 1976.<br />
AS NATIONAL PRESIDENT, I CAN REMEMBER IT ONLY TOO WELL.<br />
BUT IT WENT DEEPER THAN DESPAIR ABOUT OUR GRIM ELECTORAL<br />
PROSPECTS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE EVENTS WHICH LED TO THE<br />
DISMISSAL OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT AND THE ELECTORAL<br />
AVALANCHE THAT FOLLOWED, THERE WAS IN MANY SECTIONS OF THE<br />
LABOR MOVEMENT A LOSS OF FAITH IN THE SYSTEM OF<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY ITSELF.<br />
MORE THAN ANY OTHER EVENT, THE WRAN VICTORY OF 1 MAY 1976<br />
STOPPED THE HAEMORRHAGING OF SUPPORT FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY<br />
SYSTEM AND THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCESSES AND LABOR'S ROLE<br />
WITHIN THAT SYSTEM.<br />
MORE THAN ANY OTHER EVENT, IT RESTORED OUR FAITH, NOT ONLY<br />
IN THAT SYSTEM BUT OUR FAITH IN OURSELVES AND IN OUR<br />
CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WITHIN THE<br />
SYSTEM OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.<br />
AND FOR THAT, EVERY LABOR GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS BEEN ELECTED<br />
IN AUSTRALIA SINCE 1976, INCLUDING MY OWN INDEED,<br />
ESPECIALLY MY OWN IS DIRECTLY AND DEEPLY IN NEVILLE WRAN'S<br />
DEBT. BUT OF COURSE, AN ELECTORAL VICTORY, OF ITSELF, WOULD HAVE<br />
MEANT LITTLE OR NOTHING, IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOLLOWED UP BY<br />
SUBSTANTIAL ACHIEVEMENT.<br />
AND THE NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WRAN GOVERNMENT LIES IN<br />
BOTH THE STYLE AND THE SUBSTANCE OF ITS ACHIEVEMENT, AND THE<br />
PATTERN IT SET FOR LABOR GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>THERE WqERE TWO KEY ASPECTS OF THE WRAN GOVERNMENT'S<br />
APPROACH, WHICH FIRMLY ESTABLISHED A MODEL FOR REFORM LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENTS THROUGHT AUSTRALIA.<br />
FIRST, THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MISTAKES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE<br />
PAST NOT IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE GREAT REFORMS WHICH THE<br />
WHITLAM GOVERNMENT SET OUT TO ACHIEVE AND DID IN FACT<br />
ACHIEVE TO A REMARKABLE AND ENDURING EXTENT BUT MISTAKES<br />
IN THE METHODS AND PACE OF REFORM.<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT IN NEW SOUTH WALES DEMONSTRATED TO ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS THAT LABOR WAS CAPABLE OF LEARNING FROM ITS<br />
MISTAKES. SECONDLY, THEY DEMONSTRATED THAT, GIVEN THE RIGHT APPROACH,<br />
REFORM COULD BE ACHIEVED EVEN IN THE FACE OF A HOSTILE<br />
POLITICAL CLIMATE AND AN UNFAVOURABLE ECONOMIC CLIMATE.<br />
IT IS TOO EASILY FORGOTTEN THAT THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS OF THE<br />
WRAN GOVERNMENT COINCIDED WITH THE YEARS OF THE FRASER<br />
GOVERNMENT, CULMINATING IN THE WORST ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL<br />
CRISIS IN AUSTRALIA FOR FIFTY YEARS.<br />
AND THE BASIS OF THE APPROACH TO REFORM IN NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
WAS ALWAYS CO-OPERATION AND IN PARTICULAR, CO-OPERATION<br />
BETWEEN BUSINESS, UNIONS AND GOVERNMENT.<br />
THE PRESENCE HERE TONIGHT OF SO M4ANY LEADERS OF THE BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITY, AND THE CONTINUING SUPPORT THIS GOVERNMENT<br />
RECEIVES FROM BUSINESS, IS ITSELF EVIDENCE OF THE SUCCESS OF<br />
THAT APPROACH.<br />
BUT IN MORE SUBSTANTIAL TERMS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SYDNEY<br />
AS THE FINANCIAL CENTRE OF AUSTRALIA, THE REJUVENATION OF<br />
THE HUNTER VALLEY AND THE ILLAWARRA AND THE STRONG GROWTH OF<br />
THE INDUSTRIAL BASE OF NEW SOUTH WALES, ALL REPRESENT THE<br />
FRUITS OF THE EMPHASIS ON CO-OPERATION RATHER THAN<br />
CONFRONTATION. IT WAS A MATTER OF GENUINE NATIONAL IMPORTANCE AND NATIONAL<br />
BENEFIT THAT WHEN, AFTER MARCH 1983, WE WERE ABLE TO SET THE<br />
NATIONAL AGENDA FOR NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, NATIONAL<br />
CO-OPERATION AND NATIONAL RECOVERY, THE APPROACH HAD BEEN<br />
TRIED AND HAD SUCCEEDED IN THE LARGEST STATE.<br />
AND THE NATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PAST THREE YEARS ABOVE<br />
ALL THE CREATION OF 670,000 NEW JOBS COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN<br />
ACHIEVED WITHOUT NEW SOUTH WALES, WITHOUT A LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
OF NEW SOUTH WALES.<br />
I NEED ONLY INSTANCE THE CONTRAST OF THE ONE MAINLAND STATE<br />
IN WHICH THE POLITICS OF CONFRONTATION STILL PERSIST. IT'S<br />
NO COINCIDENCE THAT QUEENSLAND, UNDER THE PRESENT<br />
DISPENSATION, HAS BEEN UNABLE TO SHARE FULLY IN THE FRUITS<br />
OF NATIONAL RECOVERY AND HAS FALLEN BEHIND THE REST OF<br />
AUSTRALIA IN ALMOST ALL THE MAIN INDICATORS OF ECONOMIC AND<br />
SOCIAL ADVANCE. </p>
<p>I NEED ONLY BMiEFLY INDICATE THE MAIN AREAS OF REFORM<br />
ACHIEVED BY THE WRAN GOVERNMENT A GREAT DEAL OF IT THROUGH<br />
PIONEERING LEGISLATION WHICH LEADS THE AUSTRALIAN STATES.<br />
THE COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THE STATE'S FINANCIAL<br />
ADMINISTRATION, LEADING MALCOLM FRASER HIMSELF TO<br />
CONCEDE THAT NEW SOUTH WALES WAS THE BEST MANAGED STATE<br />
IN AUSTRALIA;<br />
THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM;<br />
THE SWEEPING ELECTORAL REFORMS, ABOVE ALL, THE BRINGING<br />
OF DEMOCRACY TO THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR THE FIRST<br />
TIME IN ITS LONG HISTORY;<br />
THE REVITALISATION OF SYDNEY FINANCIAL, PHYSICAL,<br />
CULTURAL, AND MOST OF ALL, AS A PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK<br />
FOR ALL TO ENJOY;<br />
PIONEERING ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS AND THE CREATION OF<br />
A GENUINE MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITY;<br />
AUSTRALIA'S MOST ADVANCED CONSUMER PROTECTION<br />
LEGISLATION; COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE PROTECTION<br />
PROGRAMS THE THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN THE AREA OF<br />
NATIONAL PARKS, THE PROTECTION OF THE STATE'S<br />
RAINFORESTS AND COASTLINE;<br />
AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, THE PROGRAMS FOR THE WELFARE<br />
OF THE PEOPLE THE STATUS OF WOMEN, THE PROTECTION OF<br />
CHILDREN, CARE FOR THE AGED, SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE<br />
YOUNG UNEMPLOYED.<br />
IN SHORT, THE WRAN LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES WITH A DECADE OF CONTINUOUS, COMPREHENSIVE AND<br />
CONSISTENT REFORM UNEQUALLED, FOR DURATION AND DEPTH, BY ANY<br />
STATE IN OUR FEDERAL HISTORY.<br />
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO BEAR IN MIND NEVER MORE SO THAN<br />
TODAY, IN 1986 THAT THE BASIS OF THIS PROGRAM OF LABOR<br />
REFORM HAS, AT ALL TIMES, BEEN SOUND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT<br />
AS I HAVE SAID, THE KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHICH EXTRACTED EVEN<br />
MALCOLM FRASER'S GRUDGING ADMIRATION.<br />
AND FROM THIS DECADE OF ACHIEVEMENT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF<br />
STEADY, CONSISTENT REFORM AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF WIDELY<br />
FLUCTUATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST<br />
SEVEN YEARS CARRIES IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR ALL AUSTRALIA<br />
TODAY.<br />
AND THE CHIEF LESSON IS THAT WORTHWHILE AND ENDURING<br />
PROGRESS AND REFORM WILL ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY GOVERNMENTS, IN<br />
CO-OPERATION WITH ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, WHO HAVE<br />
THE WISDOM AND THE COURAGE TO FACE UP TO THE ECONOMIC AND<br />
POLITICAL REALITIES NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL REALITIES<br />
OF THE TIME. </p>
<p>THIS SENSE OF REALITY ITS ABILITY TO FACE UP TO THE<br />
PROBLEMS AS THEY EXIST HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF THE WRAN<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT.<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE KEY TO ITS SUCCESS AS A GENUINE REFORM<br />
GOVERNMENT.<br />
AND IT IS A TRIBUTE TO THE COMMONSENSE OF THE PEOPLE OF NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES THAT IT HAS ALSO BEEN THE KEY TO THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S REMARKABLE ELECTORAL SUCCESS.<br />
AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THE YEARS<br />
AHEAD. NOW OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS A PRICE TO BE PAID FOR SUCCESS<br />
OF THE MAGNITUDE ACHIEVED BY NEVILLE WRAN AND HIS TEAM.<br />
THERE IS A POLITICAL PRICE. THERE IS A PERSONAL PRICE.<br />
IN NEVILLE'S CASE, I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL<br />
LEADER HAS BEEN CALLED UPON TO PAY A HIGHER PERSONAL PRICE,<br />
IN TERMS OF SCRUTINY AND OF OBLOQUY.<br />
BUT NO-ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS ANYTHING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, AND PARTICULARLY LABOR'S ROLE IN THE HISTORY OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, WILL BE SURPRISED OR MYSTIFIED BY THIS PROCESS.<br />
IT IS THE OLDEST STORY IN OUR POLITICAL HISTORY THE DOUBLE<br />
STANDARD AGAINST LABOR, WITH THE ULTIMATE AIM OF DENIAL OF<br />
LABOR'S LEGITIMACY.<br />
WE HAVE SEEN IT AGAIN AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY.<br />
WE SEE IT AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND I HAVE TO SAY IN A<br />
QUITE SHAMEFUL AND SHAMELESS FORM IN SOME OF THE<br />
POSTURINGS FROM THE PRESENT OPPOSITION AND EVEN FROM SOME<br />
PEOPLE WHO SHOULD, AND I BELIEVE DO, KNOW BETTER ABOUT<br />
TAXATION REFORM.<br />
AND NEVILLE HAS BEEN JUDGED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY THAT DOUBLE<br />
STANDARD. INDEED, UNIQUELY, HE SUBMITTED HIMSELF TO THAT<br />
JUDGEMENT. HIS INTEGRITY HAS BEEN TESTED AND RETESTED AND YOUR<br />
PRESENCE HERE TONIGHT IS ITSELF THE TANGIBLE TESTIMONY THAT<br />
HE HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND WANTING.<br />
IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER AND IN HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT, HE HAS<br />
DEMONSTRATED TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE THAT BRAND OF COURAGE<br />
DESCRIBED BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY AS ' GRACE UNDER PRESSURE'.<br />
AND THAT HAS BEEN AN ENDURING SOURCE, NOT ONLY OF HIS OWN<br />
STRENGTH, BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH HE LEADS.<br />
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT TO ADD MY<br />
TRIBUTE AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR INDEBTEDNESS.<br />
ONE OF THE MESSAGES NEVILLE RECEIVED ON 1 MAY WAS ONE WHICH<br />
RAN " IF A WEEK IN POLITICS IS LIKE A YEAR ANYWHERE ELSE,<br />
THANK YOU FOR 520 GREAT YEARS". </p>
<p>6.<br />
AND TEN YEARS IS A LIFE-TIME IN MODERN GOVERNMENT.<br />
BUT NOT THE LEAST REMARKABLE ATTRIBUTES OF THE WRAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THAT ITS VIGOUR AND DRIVE HAS NOT BEEN<br />
DISSIPATED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE YEARS.<br />
EVEN THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD NOT AN UNDULY SYCOPHANTIC<br />
SOURCE ACKNOWLEDGES THIS IN AN EDITORIAL LAST MONTH.<br />
IT SAID " AFTER 10 YEARS MOST GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE A TERMINAL<br />
CASE, BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE WRAN GOVERNMENT".<br />
YOUR GOVERNMENT, NEVILLE, HAS NOT ONLY PROVIDED NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES WITH UNPRECEDENTED STABILITY OVER A DECADE, BUT A<br />
CAPACITY FOR SELF-RENEWAL AND REJUVENATION.<br />
AND WHEN WE LOOK AROUND THE LABOR GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT<br />
AUSTRALIA, IN THE FOUR STATES AND THE NATIONAL CAPITAL, YOU<br />
HAVE TO BE STRUCK BY AN EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON.<br />
AND IT THIS. IN THE SPACE OF A MERE DECADE, A WHOLE NEW<br />
GENERATION OF LABOR PARLIAMENTARIANS HAS COME FORWARD TO<br />
LEAD LABOR GOVERNMENTS, A NEW GENERATION OF LABOR MEN AND<br />
WOMEN WHO, COLLECTIVELY AND IN THEIR SEPARATE<br />
ADMINISTRATIONS, IN SYDNEY, IN MELBOURNE, IN ADELAIDE, IN<br />
PERTH AND IN CANBERRA, FORM THE MOST TALENTED, THE MOST<br />
VIGOROUS AND MOST COMPETENT POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THIS NATION<br />
HAS EVER HAD.<br />
THE ELECTION AND THE EXAMPLE OF THE WRAN GOVERNMENT WAS<br />
A CATALYST IN HELPING BRING THIS NEW GENERATION FORWARD INTO<br />
THE SERVICE OF OUR PARTY AND OUR NATION.<br />
THAT IS AS STRONG A REASON AS ANY FOR CELEBRATING THIS TENTH<br />
ANNIVERSARY. IN TIMES LIKE THESE, THE DECISIONS WE MUST MAKE, AS<br />
GOVERNMENTS AND AS A COMMUNITY, ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT,<br />
REQUIRING ALL OUR SKILL, DETERMINATION, DEDICATION, AND<br />
FORESIGHT. WE MUST MUSTER AND MARSHAL ALL OUR COMBINED<br />
TALENTS AND RESOURCES.<br />
I REPEAT, THE TEN YEARS SINCE NEVILLE WRAN'S ELECTION HAVE<br />
PRODUCED, IN OUR LABOR GOVERNMENTS, THE MOST TALENTED AND<br />
DEDICATED LEADERSHIP IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY.<br />
AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE FACT IN AUSTRALIAN<br />
POLITICAL LIFE TODAY A FACT OF MONUMENTAL IMPORTANCE FOR<br />
OUR FUTURE FOR THE FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA UNDER LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN THE YEARS AHEAD. </p>
