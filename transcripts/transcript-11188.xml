    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: East Timor</p>
<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  Ladies and Gentlemen, I've called this brief news conference because I want</p>
<p>   to place on record my total rejection of the reckless statement made this</p>
<p>   morning by the former prime minister about my role in relation to the events</p>
<p>   that have unfolded in East Timor. I wouldn't normally do this but the statement</p>
<p>   was so reckless. It was not only wrong, completely wrong, but it was also</p>
<p>   in complete contradiction of something Mr Keating had said only a few weeks</p>
<p>   ago quoted in an article by Ian Henderson in The Australian, he said,</p>
<p>   and I quote "responsibility for what has happened in East Timor in</p>
<p>   recent days rests unambiguously with the perpetrators of the violence, those</p>
<p>   who are supporting them and those who should be exercising responsibility."</p>
<p>   And that was the 11th of September of this year. And what he</p>
<p>   said this morning on Radio National was, of course, in complete contradiction</p>
<p>   of that.</p>
<p>  But worse still the statement is recklessly indifferent to the national</p>
<p>   interest because it is the kind of statement that will be used by our critics</p>
<p>   overseas to justify inaccurate, untrue and unfair criticism of what Australia</p>
<p>   has done. And it will be seen by some in the community as being capable</p>
<p>   of undermining what I have regarded as bipartisan support for the deployment</p>
<p>   of the INTERFET forces within the Australian community. Now, I think it</p>
<p>   was not only an untrue statement but it was reckless and, most important,</p>
<p>   it was recklessly indifferent to the national interest. Leave aside the</p>
<p>   political differences between us. When a former Prime Minister says that</p>
<p>   a letter written by his successor began the chain of events that led to</p>
<p>   the tragedy which has unfolded in East Timor it's a pretty extraordinary</p>
<p>   statement and it deserves a formal rebuke which it is now getting. And it</p>
<p>   deserves to be seen for what it is, as something more importantly than it</p>
<p>   misrepresenting my position, important though that is and wrong though that</p>
<p>   claim may be, it is quite indifferent to the Australian national interest.</p>
<p>   And I would have hoped that Mr Beazley would have emphatically repudiated</p>
<p>   it but I'll put that aside. The important thing is that it be seen for what</p>
<p>   it is, an inaccurate statement, a completely inaccurate statement - one</p>
<p>   at odds with what he said only a few weeks ago but worst of all indifferent</p>
<p>   to the national interest.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible].that there should be no criticism at a time like this and if</p>
<p>   that isn't your view, what kind of criticism is legitimate?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I deal with facts, Karen. And what he said this morning was, in plain</p>
<p>   black and white, my letter to Habibie really caused all the trouble. Well,</p>
<p>   that is wrong, wrong, wrong. It couldn't be more inaccurate and the whole</p>
<p>   world knows that. But worse than it being an inaccurate depiction of my</p>
<p>   actions it's hurtful to the national interest and I'm far more concerned</p>
<p>   about that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, how delicate is the bilateral relationship with Indonesia</p>
<p>   and how important is it now for the Government to rebuild or to reshape</p>
<p>   the way the Australian Government's performance has been viewed in Indonesia</p>
<p>   and perhaps by some other near neighbours?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the bilateral relationship is under strain. We all know that. And</p>
<p>   it was inevitable that it would come under strain once events unfolded as</p>
<p>   they did in East Timor and because Australia correctly took a lead in promoting</p>
<p>   the establishment of a multinational force. Now, that was inevitable and</p>
<p>   unavoidable and we have to live with a period of difficulty in the relationship.</p>
<p>   It's important that that period of difficulty be managed with sensitivity,</p>
<p>   consistent with maintaining support for the stance that we have taken. I</p>
<p>   want a good relationship with Indonesia. Every time I get the opportunity</p>
<p>   to do so I repeat that and I do that quite deliberately because I think</p>
<p>   it is important. And although I have my differences with some of the stances</p>
<p>   that have been taken in the past and some of the stances that are being</p>
<p>   taken now by some, including some of you on this issue, I do agree, I think,</p>
<p>   with everybody and we all agree that a good relationship between the two</p>
<p>   countries consistent with it being on a basis of mutual respect is desirable.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Is that harder today than it was three days ago?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't know. That's very hard to judge. All I know is it hard. Just</p>
<p>   whether it's harder now or a bit less harder, that's very hard to make a</p>
<p>   judgement.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Have you received any advice that Mr Keating's comments have been used or</p>
<p>   are going to be used against..?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I haven't received any advice, no, to that effect - it's a judgement I make.</p>
<p>   Now what I said Dennis was that they could be used. I mean if you've got</p>
<p>   the former Prime Minister saying it was really my successor's letter to</p>
<p>   Dr Habibie that caused a lot of the trouble, then I'd be amazed if some</p>
<p>   people didn't try and use that against us.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [inaudible] he understands the sensitivities. Why is he doing it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well you should ask him that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  ..(inaudible)..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I don't think I would be regarded as the world's greatest authority</p>
<p>   on why he does things.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Did the National Security Committee today take any decision on what Australia</p>
<p>   might do to advance the move towards phase three, or any decision on a possible</p>
<p>   visit to East Timor by Mr Moore?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well let me without..as I don't normally do - go into the details of what</p>
<p>   was discussed at those gatherings. There are no plans for any visits at</p>
<p>   present. I was asked that question this morning on television and that remains</p>
<p>   the position. So far as phase three is concerned it's always been part of</p>
<p>   what we are doing to move to phase three. That's always been the intention,</p>
<p>   and I think it's fair to say that in all the discussions that we have on</p>
<p>   the issue that is something that is there. But of course we are still in</p>
<p>   the peace enforcement phase and phase three is something that comes when</p>
<p>   you are closer to the peacekeeping part of the operation.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, can you give us any indication of a time scale by when you'd</p>
<p>   expect to move into the blue helmet phase?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No it's too early Peter. When I can I'll try and do so, but it is a little</p>
<p>   too early. We naturally don't want it to be any.the period to be any longer</p>
<p>   than necessary. But I don't want in saying that to be construed of saying</p>
<p>   that we're anxious to get the current phase over as quickly as possible</p>
<p>   in the sense that, you know, we would take any short cuts. I mean there</p>
<p>   is a certain amount of time involved in the current phase. There has to</p>
<p>   be time allowed for that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Beazley's released a statement some time ago saying that you had misrepresented</p>
<p>   him this morning by suggesting that his commitment to the troops wasn't</p>
<p>   what you believed it to be. Have you seen that statement?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well look I have seen that statement, and I've had a look at the transcript</p>
<p>   of my interview and I think Mr Beazley's done me an injustice. I think I</p>
<p>   said on a couple of occasions during that interview that in response to</p>
<p>   questions suggesting that he was being critical of the deployment or being</p>
<p>   critical of the Government's policy to deploy, I said I was not taking that</p>
<p>   view. I was taking the charitable view that he wasn't, even though he was</p>
<p>   being critical. I said, as best I can remember it, what I said during the</p>
<p>   interview was that although he's not criticising the deployment he's searching</p>
<p>   around to make a political criticism or to score a political hit on me.</p>
<p>   And I think...I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  For domestic purposes one assumes.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well they're your words.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [inaudible] amplify it by holding this press conference?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well you know, you are damned if you do. And I thought about that. I spent</p>
<p>   some time talking to some of my advisers about that. I know there's a danger.</p>
<p>   The other problem is that if you don't formally reject something like this</p>
<p>   in a way that everybody can run it unambiguously, then you know as well</p>
<p>   as I do that something can go into the folklore. And to me it is such a</p>
<p>   recklessly untrue statement that I would not be doing the Government, doing</p>
<p>   the right thing by the Government nor the community if I didn't take the</p>
<p>   opportunity of rejecting it. I mean the point is he went much further this</p>
<p>   morning than he did yesterday. I mean yesterday he didn't actually blame</p>
<p>   me for what has happened. But this morning he did. Now..I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  How much of an influence do you believe your letter to Mr Habibie was in</p>
<p>   subsequent events?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I believe that my letter had a very positive and beneficial influence</p>
<p>   because it brought about a change of heart. It helped bring about a change</p>
<p>   of heart. I don't want to overemphasise it. I mean some people have written</p>
<p>   that it represented the catalyst. On other occasions some of my critics</p>
<p>   have been wanting to dismiss the importance of its impact.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, should the Falantil forces be obliged to lay down their arms.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I don't want to answer that yes or no. What I do want to say is that</p>
<p>   the mandate of INTERFET is to enforce peace and security and to enforce</p>
<p>   it in an even-handed fashion. The question of how Falantil is treated on</p>
<p>   the ground is really something to be dealt with and answered for on the</p>
<p>   ground by those who are on the ground.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  How can you say [inaudible] not in the national interest at a time like</p>
<p>   this, couldn't you say that about all criticism of the Government .</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, no, I don't. I didn't.I haven't said that Mr Beazley's unreasonable</p>
<p>   claim that I shouldn't, in effect, that I shouldn't go out and explain the</p>
<p>   reasons for what the Government's doing. I don't say that that is against</p>
<p>   the national interest I just say that it's wrong. I think it's a question</p>
<p>   of looking at the quality of what's said. But if.I repeat that if you having</p>
<p>   been a Prime Minister of this country say that the action of your successor</p>
<p>   is the principal cause, or a principal cause, of all the tragedy that's</p>
<p>   unfolded, and being a successor if you don't analyse that and correct it</p>
<p>   I think you are failing in your job. And, I mean, I think it was.it really</p>
<p>   went way beyond what was said yesterday. I mean, what was said yesterday</p>
<p>   was, in my view, quite inaccurate. His claim that I was trying to score</p>
<p>   domestic political points on this issue of course that was totally inaccurate.</p>
<p>   But it was what I regarded as a although inaccurate political criticism</p>
<p>   an in the groove, sort of, political criticism. But this is a quantum shift.</p>
<p>   I mean, Mr Beazley this morning was even in a general attitude of being</p>
<p>   reluctant to distance himself from Mr Keating, Mr Beazley at least this</p>
<p>   morning said that he didn't hold me responsible for any of the violence</p>
<p>   or death that had occurred in East Timor. Now, he only said that because</p>
<p>   even he must have realised how outrageous was Mr Keating's claim.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, what state would you say in your view is the bipartisan nature</p>
<p>   of support for the Australian commitment now following this.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  As far as I am concerned I have operated from the very beginning on the</p>
<p>   basis that the troop deployment has bipartisan support. I have operated</p>
<p>   on that basis and I have indicated that. I think what Mr Beazley tried to</p>
<p>   do yesterday and is continuing to do, he's trying simultaneously to support</p>
<p>   the bipartisan, support in a bipartisan way the deployment but inflict political</p>
<p>   damage on me. Now, I mean, that's what he's endeavouring to do. Now, it's</p>
<p>   up to him to answer for that but his statements have been of bipartisan</p>
<p>   support. There was a resolution carried by the Parliament.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  How personally have you taken Mr Keating's comments at..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Personally I am not offended by them because I expect personal attacks from</p>
<p>   Mr Keating, I mean, I am used to it. It's part of the game. But, I mean,</p>
<p>   I really do believe that to say that your successor's letter was really</p>
<p>   the principal cause of everything that had happened and the character of</p>
<p>   the interview, for me to have allowed that to go by, as some might imply,</p>
<p>   is absurd. I mean, you can't allow an allegation like that to stand unrebuked</p>
<p>   and it is a statement, in my view, that is not helpful of the national interests.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, does it make it harder for Australia to put more pressure</p>
<p>   on Indonesia or on the Indonesian military to curb any actions that would</p>
<p>   in some way slow down.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, let me put it..let me answer the question this way, Catherine, it's</p>
<p>   really tied up with Dennis' earlier question. We all know that there were</p>
<p>   many people in Indonesia who were opposed to what Dr Habibie did in relation</p>
<p>   to the ballot. Now, I would think many of those people would pick up.could</p>
<p>   pick Mr Keating's statement and say 'here you are'. It could be used. Now,</p>
<p>   okay, you might say that's part and parcel of political exchange inside</p>
<p>   a country but these things are.I mean, what Prime Ministers and ex-Prime</p>
<p>   Ministers and senior Ministers and Opposition Leaders say are picked up</p>
<p>   and commented upon and they are used. And when something is so demonstrably</p>
<p>   inaccurate and is capable not only because of that inaccuracy but because</p>
<p>   of the very nature of the comment, capable of being used to our disadvantage</p>
<p>   I think I am entitled to say that it's a comment that is unhelpful in the</p>
<p>   national interests.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, how do you characterise Mr Keating's complete speech on Sunday.where</p>
<p>   he ticked off.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I am not going to comment on that. I will leave that to the commentators</p>
<p>   and as you know I am not a commentator.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  But his remarks about Mr Packer in particular?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I am not going to get into the role of a commentator.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you think Mr Keating's comments might make it difficult for Australia's</p>
<p>   leadership of a multi-national force in East Timor? Does that relationship</p>
<p>   between Australia and other governments [inaudible]..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't.I haven't seen it in that light. I haven't seen any evidence</p>
<p>   yet. That's not a view that I have really turned my mind to. I hope it doesn't.</p>
<p>   I am not at this stage making that claim because I haven't seen any evidence</p>
<p>   that that is likely to happen. But I do stand by the claims I made in relation</p>
<p>   to the comment.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, should home owners be concerned or fearful if interest rates</p>
<p>   were to rise at any point in the future?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You know I never comment about the future level of interest rates.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Rates go up and down [inaudible]. Is that a national crisis or any concern</p>
<p>   or..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I'll see you all later.</p>
