    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australian Governments will invest $1.6 billion in Indigenous health to help close the appalling gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people within a generation.</p>
<p>This funding, including an $800 million Commonwealth commitment, will deliver more health professionals to Indigenous communities, expand health services, and help tackle key risk factors like smoking.</p>
<p>This investment will target chronic disease, the single largest contributor to the current life expectancy gap.</p>
<p>Chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer account for about two thirds of premature deaths among Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Around $470 million will be provided to improve chronic disease management, including:</p>
<p>     * Incentives and support for general practice to manage the coordination of care of Indigenous patients</p>
<p>     * Additional support for Indigenous patients with chronic diseases to access specialist and allied health care services</p>
<p>     * The expansion of the Medical Specialists Outreach Assistance Program to increase access to specialist and allied health services in rural and remote areas</p>
<p>     * Supporting patients with chronic disease to better self-manage their conditions</p>
<p>$171 million will be provided to increase the capacity of the frontline primary care workforce to care for Indigenous Australians with chronic diseases, including:</p>
<p>     * 160 new Indigenous Outreach Worker positions (including on the job training and support) to help Indigenous people access the health care services they need</p>
<p>     * 75 extra health professionals and practice managers in Indigenous health services</p>
<p>     * 38 new GP registrar training places in Indigenous health services</p>
<p>     * Expanded nurse scholarship and clinical placements</p>
<p>The package also includes $161 million to tackle the key risk factors for chronic diseases in the Indigenous community, like smoking.</p>
<p>Both mainstream and Indigenous community controlled primary health care services will be eligible for the additional funding and support.</p>
<p>States and Territories have agreed to contribute an additional $772 million to provide additional resources for tackling smoking, expanding allied health and other State Government-funded services provided to Indigenous people, and introducing strategies to improve care provided to Indigenous people in public hospitals.</p>
