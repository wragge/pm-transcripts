PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT THE ASHES DINNER<br />
MELBOURNE, 27 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
I am delighted to have been asked to join with members of<br />
the Australian Cricket Board and other distinguished guests<br />
who have gathered here this evening to pay tribute to one of<br />
Australia's most successful cricket teams ever to tour<br />
England. I<br />
Your magnificent performances in England brought an extra<br />
inner warmth to the hearts of your fellow Australians during<br />
the winter which has just passed and made us all very proud<br />
of you. At the outset I want to express my congratulations<br />
to the Australian Cricket Board, to Malcolm Gray and David<br />
Richards, for giving us the opportunity tonight in Melbourne<br />
to pay tribute to you. Sydney will honour you tomorrow.<br />
But before I pay my own tribute, I want to pick a couple of<br />
political bones with the team. I've been asked by Paul<br />
Keating to point out to you blokes that your efforts in<br />
England have probably ruined the Government's economic<br />
policy for good and all.<br />
Here we are, doing our best to raise productivity and<br />
develop an export culture in the consciousness of<br />
Australians. How could we possibly succeed when, to judge from the slack,<br />
sports-mad mob who work in my office, for three months the<br />
work-force shambled into work late, pale, drawn and red-eyed<br />
and then, instead of taking an aspirin and getting on with<br />
it, spent the rest of the day rabbiting on about Boonie's<br />
catch at short-leg off Alan Lamb, or Deano's six over<br />
long-on, or the one Merv ripped through Robin Smith?<br />
The other thing we are trying to do is to cool the economy<br />
so we can lower interest rates. And what are you fellows<br />
doing about that? I am reliably informed that your<br />
performances have got sales of cricket gear booming again.<br />
Kids are rushing out all ' over the country to buy bats, to<br />
emulate Mark Taylor's cover drive, and six-stitchers that<br />
will move away in the air and nip back like Terry<br />
Alderman's. You've got the economic planners in despair. 2049<br />

<p>I had the great pleasure of seeing the team play at Lord's<br />
on the second day of the Second Test and, later that day,<br />
attended Doug McClelland's memorable reception at Australia<br />
House, where the Australians and a good number of English<br />
players were also present.<br />
I recall that Allan was a little worried that evening.<br />
Chasing about 280 by the Pains, Australia had faltered a<br />
little after a good start and was 6 for 270. A great deal<br />
would depend on how Steve Waugh and the tail batted the next<br />
day. On that day, our RAAF plane flew out of London for<br />
Washington at 11, just as play was beginning. Over the last<br />
few weeks, the RAAF has given thousands of Australians<br />
reason to be grateful for their dedication and skill. I can<br />
tell you that on that Saturday in June they made about<br />
Australians the Prime Minister, his staff, his officials,<br />
and a group of journalists truly thankful for the<br />
regularity, and the content, of their mid-Atlantic sports<br />
results service from the cockpit.<br />
The mood on board charged from anxiety, to hope, to<br />
disbelief and, finally to sheer delight as we learned that<br />
Merv Hughes had got 30 against the new ball disbelief<br />
indeedi that Trevor Hohns had chipped in with a useful<br />
that Geoff Lawson had played the innings of his life for<br />
and, finally, that Steve Waugh was unbeaten for another<br />
Bradman-like 150-plus.<br />
My other great memory of that Test comes from Washington on<br />
the last day. The critical final couple of hours play were<br />
taking place in London as I was preparing for my formal<br />
talks with the President and his Administration.<br />
I hope nobody tells George Bush but one of the more<br />
ingenious members of my staff had worked out that you could<br />
ring the Telecom cricket score service in Sydney from the<br />
telephones in the limousines provided to us by the US<br />
Government. I went into the Oval office to meet the<br />
President, privy to the very disturbing information that we<br />
were 4 for 67, chasing about 120 to win.<br />
I would not of course wish to suggest that either I or my<br />
delegation would let our minds be distracted from important<br />
talks with our American friends by concerns over the fate of<br />
a mere cricket match. But Secretary of State Baker and his<br />
officials are probably still puzzled why at a particular<br />
point of the discussion about the US Farm Bill, the<br />
Australian delegates grinned, punched the air and muttered<br />
things like " You little beauty!" I can tell them now that<br />
word had come through that Boon and Waugh had just got the<br />
runs.<br />
2050 </p>
<p>The team never looked back from that wonderful start, went<br />
on to win the series 4-0, and, but for the weather, would<br />
almost certainly have won 6-0. In doing so, they achieved a<br />
feat last performed by Bill Woodfull's team in 1934, and<br />
only on one other occasion again by Woodfull in 1930, and<br />
on behalf of everyone here, may I say how marvellous it is<br />
to see members of the 1934 team among us tonight.<br />
A measure of the 1989 team's success can be gauged by the<br />
fact that the commentators continually reached for their<br />
history books to determine which record had just been broken<br />
and what the next one could be. Allan and his players did so<br />
well that Jack Pollard has put back the launch of the final<br />
volume of his definitive " History of Australian Cricket" so<br />
that their remarkable feats can be included.<br />
Their individual performances will stand comparison with<br />
anyone's well, nearly anyone's. Don Bradman put England to<br />
the sword in 1930 to the tune of 974 runs at an average of<br />
139. It would of course be sacrilege for any subsequent<br />
Australian player to aspiri to surpass this record but, for<br />
a while, mark Taylor gave the aggregate a shake and Steve<br />
Waugh fell just short of the Don's average. As Phil Derriman<br />
has pointed out in today's press, Waugh got his runs a shade<br />
faster than Bradman in 1930.<br />
The top six Mark Taylor, Geoff Marsh, David Boon, Allan<br />
Border, Dean Jones and Steve Waugh performed with superb<br />
consistency and, equally importantly, provided bright and<br />
aggressive batting throughout the series.<br />
We saw the astonishing effort of Taylor and Marsh breaking<br />
the opening partnership record for Australia-England Tests<br />
of the legendary Jack Hobbs and Wilfred Rhodes, which had<br />
stood since 1912.<br />
The bowlers were also superb. Terry Alderman's second haul<br />
of over 40 wickets in an Ashes series was a truly wonderful<br />
effort. It had to be, to win the Man of the Series award<br />
against all those high-scoring batsmen.<br />
It was very good to see Geoff Lawson back in top form,<br />
bowling with fire and cunning. Merv Hughes took important<br />
wickets when they were needed. I got a lot of pleasure in<br />
seeing Trevor Hohns show that there is a role for good<br />
leg-spin bowling even in England.<br />
Ian Healy played his part by hanging on to every chance<br />
which came his way and, most importantly, the fielding and<br />
catching of Border's team were in the best tradition of<br />
Australian cricket.<br />
It was obviously important that the other touring players-<br />
Greg Campbell, Tim May, Tom Moody, Carl Rackeman, Mike<br />
Veletta and Tim Zoehrer performed well throughout and,<br />
however frustrating it must have been to watch the Tests<br />
from the rooms, still contributed by their support and<br />
competitiveness to the outstanding success of the tour. 20,51 </p>
<p>I also want to pay tribute to Bob Simpson and Lawrie Sawle<br />
for their work in preparing the team for performance on the<br />
field and keeping them such a happy and united bunch off it.<br />
Which brings me to Allan Border.<br />
Over the past decade, Allan has established himself as one<br />
of our greatest ever Test batsmen, whose best performances<br />
have been put in when the going was tough.<br />
The Australian captaincy came to him when the team was in<br />
crisis. Times have often been difficult since.<br />
But, whether the team was on top or struggling, Allan has<br />
consistently performed with outstanding dedication and<br />
professionalism as a player, and his demeanour has at all<br />
times been one of courage, honesty and good sportsmanship.<br />
These qualities have won him respect around the world.<br />
The delight that all Australians felt when the Ashes were<br />
won was enhanced by the knowledge that, of all the<br />
Australian cricketers to whom this supreme honour could have<br />
fallen, none has more richly deserved it than Allan Border.<br />
Allan's leadership on this tour was outstanding, whether in<br />
the aggressive innings he played on the first day at<br />
Headingley, which set the tone for the series, the assured<br />
and purposeful manner in which he handled his bowlers and<br />
set his fields, or in the delighted but modest way he<br />
accepted victory, remembering to say a kind word for that<br />
fine cricketer, David Gower.<br />
we wish you all the best, Allan, as you take this great side<br />
on to new challenges Pakistan in Australia this summer, in<br />
what should be an exciting series and, before too long, the<br />
West Indies I know from a recent discussion with Michael<br />
Manley, Prime Minister of Jamaica, that the team's<br />
performances have made a profound impression in the<br />
Caribbean. And, at a personal level there is the target of<br />
Sunil Gavaskar's 10,000 Test runs.<br />
But whatever the future may bring, I am sure that you will<br />
treasure 1989 as the climax of a great career.<br />
And I am delighted to inform those present that the<br />
Governor-General is announcing to ' night that Her Majesty the<br />
Queen has awarded Allan the Order of Australia. I am sure<br />
that all Australians will congratulate you on this richly<br />
deserved recognition of your services to Australian cricket.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to propose a<br />
toast to Allan Border and his great 1989 Ashes team.<br />
