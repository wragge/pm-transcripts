AUSTRALIA'S GIFT PORTRAIT OF THE QUEEN<br />
To mark the occasion of the Queen's Silver Jubilee -the twentyfifth<br />
anniversary of her becoming Head of the Commonwealth as<br />
well as of the beginning of her reign the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser, today ( 7 June<br />
1977) presented a portrait of The Queen to the Commonwealth<br />
Secretariat.<br />
The portrait, painted by the Australian artist, Mr. Paul<br />
Fitzgerald, will be hung at Marlborough House, the headquarters<br />
of the Commonwealth Secretariat.<br />
The Queen is wearing a sapphire and diamond tiara, a necklace,<br />
and a bracelet. The necklace was a wedding present to The Queen<br />
from her parents, the late King George VI and Queen Elizabeth,<br />
the Queen Mother.<br />
The Queen wore the tiara for the first time in 1964. She is<br />
portrayed wearing a dress of chiffon, printed in pink, mauve,<br />
orange and yellow, with the soft cowl neckline and long floating<br />
sleeves. The artist has depicted The Queen in front of an imaginary picture<br />
of the Earl Marshal's proclamation of her accession to the Throne,<br />
being read by the Garter King of Arms, from the balcony in Friary<br />
Court, St. James's Palace. This is one of four places from which<br />
the heralds traditionally proclaim the accession of a new sovereign.<br />
This event took place on 8 February 1952, two days after the death<br />
of King George VI, and the day after The Queen's return from Kenya,<br />
where she had learned of the death of her father.<br />
The depiction of this scene recalls that the picture has been<br />
painted to mark Her Majesty's Silver Jubilee. </p>
