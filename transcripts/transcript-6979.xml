    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />FOR MEDIA 27 JULY 1986<br />As a further step in the Government's efforts to prevent the<br />extension of the Export Enhancement Program to the Soviet<br />Union and China, I have decided that an all party delegation<br />should travel to the United States this week to put<br />Australia' 3 concerns personally to members of the Congress.<br />The delegation will seek to persuade key Congressmen of the<br />devastating consequences for Australia, and especially for<br />Australian rural producers, of extending the EEP to the<br />Soviet Union and China.<br />The delegation will be headed by the Minister for Primary<br />Industry, M~ r Kerin. It will also include the Chairman of<br />the Caucus Committee on Rural Affairs, Mr Barry Cunningham,<br />who also heads my Country Task Force. The other three<br />members of the delegation will be nominated by their<br />respective parties.<br />I have tociay informed the opposition spokesman on Primary<br />Industry, M~ r Hunt, of my decision. The Australian Democrats<br />spokesman in this area, Senator Macklin, has also been<br />informed. I expect the delegation to leave for the U. S. about the<br />middle of this week. Although there appears to be no<br />definite time scale for the final passage of the relevant<br />legislation, the Congress is unlikely to have completed its<br />consideration of the proposed extension at least until the<br />following week.<br />The proposed extension of the EEP has precipitated this<br />decision to send a joint delegation, a concept which I had<br />been discuscing with Mr Dawkins and Mr Kerin and for which I<br />had received strong indications of support from Mr Hunt.<br />Today's decision follows a series of measures I have taken<br />over the last few days in an attempt to prevent the<br />extension of the EEP. Last Thursday night, I telephoned<br />U. S. Secretary of State Shultz to discuss our concerns with<br />him. On Friday, I spoke with Canadian Prime minister<br />Mulroney, and I wrote to Argentine President Alfonsin,<br />suggesting that similar representations be made by them to<br />the U. S. Administration. On Friday night, I spoke by<br />telephone with Senator Richard Lugar, Chairman of the U. S.<br />Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the<br />Senator Agriculture Committee.<br />I also sent on Friday messages to Congressional leaders<br />explaining the potential impact of the proposed legislation<br />on Australia.</p>
