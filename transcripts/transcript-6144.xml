PRIME -MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 June 1983<br />
The Administrative Arrangements are to be altered to give the<br />
Treasurer responsibility for the Australian Taxation office.<br />
This change will mean that both taxation administration and policy<br />
will revert -to being under one Minister.<br />
At present, taxation administration is the responsibility of<br />
the minister for Finance, and taxation policy is the<br />
responsibility of the Treasurer.<br />
Mr Dawkins is to become the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister<br />
for Public Service Matters.<br />
At the next Caucus meeting I will be proposing that the Cabinet<br />
be expanded to 14 to include Mr Dawkins.<br />
Mr Willis will continue his responsibilities in the industrial<br />
relations area as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for<br />
Public Service Industrial Matters. </p>
