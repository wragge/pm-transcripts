F 77/ 144<br />
FOR PRESS 8 JULY 1977<br />
STEEL EXPORTS TO THE E. E. C.<br />
The Prime Minister was asked today to comment on the decision<br />
by the Commissioners of the European Economic Community to<br />
withdraw their request to Australia to impose a voluntary<br />
cut in Australian steel exports to Common Market countries.<br />
In response to these requests he said:<br />
" I welcome the decision by the Common Market<br />
Commissioners not to press their formal request<br />
for restraint on Australia's steel exports.<br />
This will be very important for the maintenance<br />
of existing jobs in Newcastle, Woollongong and<br />
Whyalla." </p>
