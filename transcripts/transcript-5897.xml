AS DELIVERED<br />
AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 27 AUGUST 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO-NSW STATE COUNCIL<br />
The Liberal Party has en enormous responsibility to Australia.<br />
It is the only nationwide Party which is concerned to represent<br />
all Australians no matter where they are, where they live,<br />
or what they do. The strength and the experience of the Liberal<br />
Party over the decade has meant an enormous amount to this country<br />
and to the living standards of Australian families. The growth<br />
in living standards, the growth in the standards of our homes<br />
and what is in those homes has come about through the Liberal<br />
years, throhgh the policies that we have create , d which has.<br />
enabled the talent, the initiative of individual Australians<br />
to be unleashed so they can build a better and a greater<br />
continent. The importance of the NSW division to the Liberal Party to the<br />
Federal Government in Canberra, to the strength of that<br />
Government, to the strenigth of the private members is enormous<br />
indeed. There had been problems since the loss of Goverbment<br />
in this state, I know, but in recent months and the last year<br />
or two this division has made enormous strides. I would like<br />
to thank all of those that worked so hard in. the last two. months<br />
to overcome one or two financial problems to get all that<br />
behind and to enable the division to prepare for further<br />
victories in the Federal sphere and to get rid of the worst<br />
State Government that NSW has experienced.<br />
A remarkable change has occurred because if I had made<br />
that last comment three or four years ago, you I suspect<br />
would have said, " Why am I being nasty to poor Neville Wran, isn't<br />
he rather nice, doesn't he look good on television". Well<br />
I think it is demonstrated that we need a little bit more<br />
than looking good on television or being rather nice when<br />
he is met in terms of government because he has done damage<br />
to Australia and he has done great damage to this State. When<br />
a Liberal Government returns to NSW it will take a long while<br />
to put it right.<br />
It is no secret that we live in a difficult world. The price<br />
of our export commodities has fallen very significantly over<br />
the last 18 months. In six of the seven major world economies<br />
there have been reductions in industrial prod * uction through<br />
the last year. World trade is down, world trade is down compared<br />
to earlier occasions. We need to remember that a growing world<br />
trade is vital to a country like Australia because so much </p>
<p>P NSW STATE, COUNCIL 2-<br />
depends upon our capacity to sell to the markets of the world.<br />
About 30% of our gross national product is dependent upon<br />
trade and so what happens overseas is of enormous consequence<br />
to us. But because we do live in a difficult world, having<br />
a Liberal government is all the more important than it has<br />
ever been.<br />
The world recession has been worse I think than anyone<br />
expected. There have been one or two optimistic signs<br />
in the United States over recent weeks, but people have predicted<br />
a world upturn so often in the last two to three years that<br />
I am not going to join their ranks. When it actually happens,<br />
that will be good enough. We need to understand at the moment<br />
that in the United States their steel and motor industries<br />
are opreating at half capacity, but unemployment in the advanced<br />
industrial countries totals over 30 million. To indicate the<br />
extent of this problem, if I had asked or any of you had asked<br />
one of the world leaders ten or twelve years ago to what levels<br />
do you think unemployment might rise in the United States or<br />
in Europe? Will it ever get to 30 million? They would have<br />
had an answer, no that is not possible because we know how<br />
to run our countries better than that and we will take the<br />
necessary remedial action. I sometimes wonder how high<br />
unemployment is going to get in Europe. It is nearly 14% in<br />
Britain, it is 10% in the United States, it is about 12% in<br />
France before they will start to do some of the things which<br />
are necessary to get world trade moving again. The fact is<br />
that there is a problem of very significant proportions and it<br />
affects us greatly.<br />
It is not only a question of what has happened in the wider<br />
world. Because of the recession overseas, they over the last<br />
18 months have been achieving wage settlements of 5% or 6% and<br />
in Australia last year 15 to 20% and shorter hours on top of<br />
that. So we damaged Australian competitiveness by trying to<br />
pay ourselves more and work less at the very time when we should<br />
have been doing the reverse.<br />
In this total situation we obviously had a very difficult<br />
Budget to frame. It would have been possible to have a hair<br />
shirt approach for some purist economists and end up with an<br />
overall Budget surplus of about $ 1500 million, but it would have<br />
been a very harsh Budget and it would not have taken account. of<br />
the needs of Australians in 1982-83. The Government in framing<br />
a Budget has got to look not only at the questions of economic<br />
responsibility, as we : always will, but we also have to look<br />
at the needs of Australians and Australian families and do what<br />
we can to lighten hardship and difficulty when that . is -present<br />
within this Australian nation.<br />
I believe that the Budget comes out with the right balance<br />
between economic responsibility and providing help where help<br />
is needed, in maintaining responsible management. We have<br />
a domestic surplus of $ 200 million, an overall Budget deficit<br />
of about 1% and I think if the United States had an overall<br />
Budget deficit of 1% instead of something very, very much higher<br />
than that, I would then say the world would be coming out of<br />
its economic problems. I think many other observers around<br />
the world would be saying the same thing. Being able to / 3 </p>
<p>PV NSW STATE COUNCIL-3<br />
maintain budget deficits as low as we have and as a consquence<br />
to maintain unemployment at significantly lower levels than<br />
many countries overseas is one of the achievements of the present<br />
Government. It is worth having a look for a moment at what Mr Hayden said<br />
in response to John Howard's Budget speech. I ought to congratulate<br />
the Melbourne Age on having_-an entirely disspassionate editorial<br />
on the consequences. If there had been an early election call<br />
I wonder if they would have had the same disspassionate editorial.<br />
Mr Hayden said he was prepared to have a Budget deficit of about<br />
$ 31 million, that he thought he had $ 1.7 billion to play with,<br />
that he promised, as one would expect, increased spending of<br />
many different kinds in many different ways. He also promised<br />
what he called genuine and effective tax cuts, but the equation<br />
that he put down just does not balance because if you try and<br />
put the figures on it, he had a billion dollars on a job creation<br />
program, much more on capital housing and capital works and<br />
in the end he would have had enough left for tax cuts to<br />
take a further quarter cent off the basic standard tax<br />
rate or maybe make a few dollars difference to the lower<br />
threshhold. Then he would have had a deficit of $ 4 billion<br />
or $ 5 billion. That is about where Bill Hayden went out when he<br />
had a deficit of about to 5% of GDP and that is what<br />
he proposes now.<br />
Mr Hawke was more honest because last Sunday he praised all those<br />
countries with high deficits and made it quite plain that he<br />
thought it was reasonable to do the same thing. That would<br />
be the Labor Party all over again. It is not only the Liberal<br />
Party that needs to remember this. We need to remind businesses<br />
and people and individuals that in their free-spending, they are<br />
squandering of resources the earnings of the Australian people.<br />
We must make sure that the Australian people never forget that that<br />
is the basic characteristic of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
There are many aspects of the Budget which we in the Liberal<br />
Pary need to sell and sell and sell again. because I think very<br />
often over recent years we have done some things which have<br />
been reasonable, and maybe good, but quite often people don't<br />
understand what we have in fact done. When there is a Budget<br />
it has many advantages to many different groups throughout<br />
Australia, that it is encumbent on me and John Carrick and<br />
John Holkiard and my colleagues here, but also on all of us<br />
to see that we understand what is in the Budget so that it can<br />
be sold to people who so directly involved in the fortunes<br />
of the Liberal Party and of the Government. The tax cuts<br />
this year total about $ 1 billion; there is significant<br />
support for homebuyers and a rebate on interest; there is<br />
significant more housing funds; the family allowances forthe<br />
first two children have been increased by 50% bringing over the<br />
last two Budgets the total increase of 50% for all children.<br />
The buying power of somebody on a bit less than average<br />
weekly earnings, a single income family with two children is<br />
about $ 17 to $ 18 a week better off. / 4<br />
3 </p>
<p>NSW STATE COUNCIL 4<br />
There is a v ery interesting and a very useful newsletter put'<br />
out by Eric Risstrom and everyone knows of his independence.<br />
I thought there was a beautiful sentence at the Financial Review Budget<br />
lunch last week when I spoke about the Budget. In asking a<br />
question Eric Risstron prefaced it by saying, " I just want to<br />
say it is a damn good Budget". From Eric Risstron I thought<br />
that was high praise indeed. His newsletter confirms the<br />
figures that were in the Budget, that we have put out about<br />
the increased buying power available to Australian families<br />
and he refutes totally the Hayden mythology that families<br />
are not $ 17 or $ 18 better, they are only $ 2 or $ 3 a week better off.<br />
It is not only in that area that we have shown concern. Student<br />
allowances are up very considerably. The secondary allowance,<br />
to try and encourage low income families to keep the their<br />
kids in the last two years of secondary schooling or to persuade<br />
them to go on to some other form of training is up by 44%. There<br />
are more funds for technical and further education, more funds<br />
for School to Work Transition Programs to help young Australians<br />
in a difficult period, very much larger funds in the programs<br />
under Ian Macphee's Control to assist in the training and<br />
placement of significantly more people through this coming year.<br />
It will assist something like a quarter of a million people<br />
through the year.<br />
One of-the things that we need to watch are the statements<br />
of our opponents who-* show no regard for the truth whatever<br />
and if I could just offer a suggestion, the ones who say they<br />
are always honest, always speak the truth, they are the ones<br />
to watch all the more closely because an honest man never needed<br />
to profess his honesty or to claim it, he took it for granted and<br />
so did his audience. Mr Hawke said that the training programs<br />
represent a 38% decrease in real expenditures at a time<br />
when there is a 50% increase in the problem. He said a 38%<br />
decrease. I had my Department do me a note on these<br />
particular matters and my Department pointed out that there is<br />
a 48% increase in real terms. Mr Hawke if he had done any<br />
sums at all, would have known that full well. That shows<br />
the measure of our concern in this particular area.<br />
There are significant improvements for pensioners and for<br />
pensioners with some income of their own, t~ he new tax rebate<br />
to lighten the burden especially on pensioner groups. For<br />
business, a little more than $ 1 billion is provided for industry assisttance<br />
for the first time in Australia. What we have done ' is build<br />
on the package of 19 July, when instead of having equipment<br />
depreciated over the life of plant which might be 10, 15 or<br />
years, it will be depreciated over 3 or 5 years, giving<br />
Australian industry a much better opportunity to compete<br />
on fair and equal terms with their counterparts in other<br />
countries.. There are special advantages in this Budget for smaller businesses<br />
and there is the housing tax relief, personal-tax cuts and<br />
the significant stimulus for public works will also affect<br />
businesses benefitially in a very real way. The retention </p>
<p>NSW STATE COUNCIL 5<br />
allowance which all small businesses will understand has been<br />
extended by a further 10% meeting an election commitment from<br />
the last election to 80%. That again, provides about $ 30 million<br />
extra over the course of a full year.<br />
But in addition to these measures, which you in a sense might<br />
regard as routine, or routine adjustments, important even though<br />
they are, there are some initiatives contained within this<br />
Budget which look very much to the future. There are some<br />
initiatives which are visionary in terms of establishing<br />
a fair and equal Australia and in building this nation for the<br />
future. This Government introduced the system of family<br />
allowances , much fairer for low income families than the sytesm<br />
that has prevailed before, and we have built on that. We have<br />
introduced a family income supplement to support especially<br />
the lowest working income families throughout Australia. We<br />
had had a situation for quite some time where people on<br />
welfareland supported totally on welfare, with a wife and two<br />
kids for example, would be better off than some working families<br />
in the lowest paid jobs. Through the new system that is<br />
being introduced by the Government, recommended by Fred Chaney,<br />
the family income supplement, we will be able to say to all<br />
Australians, " If you are working even in the lowest paid jobs,<br />
you will be better off than on welfare" and I think it is<br />
very important to be able to say that.<br />
The Australian Bicentennary Road Development Program which will<br />
cost about $ 2 2 billion over six years, financed by a cent on<br />
diesel and a cent on petrol this year and 2 thereafter, will<br />
establish a much better, road network, much better national<br />
highways, arterial roads. It will be of assistance to<br />
local governments, they will have additional funds to spend<br />
and significant funds will also be available for urban arterial<br />
roads and public transport. It will establish fairer competition<br />
between transport and railways. It gives us something to look<br />
forward* to, something that we can watch as the road networks<br />
grow and improve leading to much better communications, lower<br />
transport costs, and we all hope, much less road accidents.<br />
The decision to change the tax laws to encourage employee share<br />
participation schemes is something which we of our philosophy<br />
I am sure would want to support strongly. The dividend tax<br />
relief, so thaL there won't be double taxation of dividends for<br />
small investors, will also complement that particular reform.<br />
In addition to that we are pressing on with measures of tax<br />
avoidance and tax evasion and as a mark of the success that<br />
the Government, John Howard in particular, has had in this<br />
area, two things ought to be noted. For the first time in<br />
many, many years the Tax Commissioner feels it is unnecessary<br />
to depreciate the revenue estimates on account of tax evasion.<br />
That is a significant measure of the success of the, policies<br />
we have in place. In addition to that, about $ 800 million<br />
in additional revenue will be coming in this year, and a fair<br />
amount next year, as a result of measures which we either have<br />
in place or will be put into place. That again is a measure<br />
of the success of the Government in these areas. </p>
<p>NSW STATE COUNCIL 6-<br />
It ought to be noted that in real terms total tax is only<br />
increasing by about or $ 80 to $ 90 million and if it was not<br />
for the additional collection as a result of the tax avoidance<br />
measures, there would in fact be a real reduction in taxation<br />
revenue through 1982-83. That again indicates the extent<br />
the tax reforms and tax changes in the income area that are<br />
being introduced.<br />
We should never forget that tax evasion had its genesis under<br />
Labor. Frank Crean as a Labor Treasurer pointed to the current<br />
scheme and said what it was doing and how bad it was, but then<br />
neither he nor Jim Cairns nor the present Leader of the Opposition<br />
did anything about it when they had the opportunity through<br />
three somewhat awkward and difficult years of government. It was<br />
the encouragement given to the promoters and all the rest as<br />
a result of their failure to act that began the industry and<br />
led to the situation that we have had to grapple with ever<br />
since. John Howard has done more in this particular area than<br />
all the other Treasurers in the whole history of Australia<br />
and deserves the fullest and most total support for what he<br />
is doing.<br />
I am glad to be able to say that the Federal Executive of the<br />
Liberal Party with all the state presidents today, unanimously<br />
supported a very strongly worded press statement giving the<br />
fullest possible support to the policies, the intentions, the<br />
objectives, the deterniination of the Government. That was a<br />
unanimous decision and I hope that put some particular views<br />
to rest.<br />
The Costigan Royal Commission, we should not forget, was appointed<br />
by the Federal Government and an earlier Liberal Government<br />
in Victoria. As a result of that Royal Commission, we over<br />
recent days, have announced the most vigorous, far sighted and<br />
I am sure they will be effective measures against tax evasion<br />
and tax avoidance. A special prosecutor is going to be<br />
established in relation to bottom of the harbour schemes,<br />
examination of the Crown Solicitor's Office by the Law Council<br />
of NSW and a number of other matters. We are pursuing our<br />
, responsibility with very great and extensive vigour.<br />
There is another aspect of these reports which the press has<br />
largely ignored. Maybe they are suggesting that those aspects<br />
are not important, that they do not merit attention. I would<br />
like to read one or two things which Mr Costigan has to say<br />
about the Painters and Dockers' Union. -" In Victoria the Union<br />
is under the control of hardened criminals. There has been<br />
some 15 murders that took place between ' 70 and ' 79. The two<br />
worst years were 1971 when three murders took place and 1979<br />
when four took place. Federal Secretary Gordon told the<br />
Sweeney Royal Commission we catch and kill our own." I think<br />
that is a sentence which is difficult for Australians to comprehend.<br />
It is the kind of statement that you might have thought was<br />
believable in relation to the mafia in what used to happen<br />
in Chicago in the 1920s. and'we have hadthe view that kind of<br />
thing does not happen in Australia, but the cold blooded meaning<br />
P~ </p>
<p>NSW STATE COUNCIL -7-<br />
of the words, "' we catch and kill our own", is the philosophy<br />
of that union as Mr Costigan so aptly described. Their answer<br />
he says to any interference with their activities is not to use<br />
the processes of the law, but rather threats, violence and<br />
intimidation. He says no community can tolerate a group within<br />
it that regards the taking of a man's life as permissible<br />
provided he belongs to that group." He goes on, " in this way<br />
the Painters and Dockers have assumed for themselves a position<br />
outside the law and have maintained that position by violence."<br />
That in summary is the kind of conclusion that Mr Costigan<br />
comes to. It indicates the nature of criminality within that<br />
union and that is a grave and serious challenge for the<br />
Victorian police. It is a grave and serious challenge for the<br />
Victorian Government. I suggested to Mr Cain that he should<br />
pursue those matters with the same vigour as we are considering<br />
in relation to tax avoidance and tax evasion and I would like<br />
to see some evidence that he is prepared to do so.<br />
I think it is worth noting that the Painters and Dockers'<br />
Union in three or four states and certainly in Victoria is<br />
affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. That means<br />
representatives of that union go along to the state conference<br />
and participate in the making of Labor policy. That means that<br />
union has a direct impact through the state conference, on their<br />
state executive and through them on their Federal policies.<br />
Senator Georges confessed that he was a member of that<br />
particular union. I can only say that if there were a body<br />
with that kind of record affiliated with any part of the Liberal<br />
Party, I woul dhave asked, requested, demanded that the<br />
affiliation be cancelled forthwith on the basis of the kind of<br />
evidence has put forward. I wonder if the Australian Labor<br />
Party will have, the same concern for its affiliates as indeed<br />
it ought to have.<br />
I think it is worthwhile perhaps saying something for a moment<br />
about the Liberal Party because a lot has been written in the<br />
press about what people said in Western Australia. However<br />
much John Howard or I or other members of the Government might<br />
condemn tax evasion and tax avoidance, I think it is a great<br />
pity that there is anyone, and I do not know if there is, if<br />
there is anyone with any connection with this Party that has<br />
any relationship with those particular practices because this<br />
is a Party that governs for average Australians. It is not<br />
a Party that governs for those with large fortunes. Those<br />
who practice bottom of the harbour schemes, tax evasion of a<br />
kind that has come to notice in recent years corrupts this<br />
society even more than the unions such as the Builders<br />
Labourers' Federation with their activities because they<br />
destroy the faith of average Australians in the system of which<br />
they are a part. They'destroy the faith of average Australians<br />
in the sense of fairness and justice in the country which they<br />
love and hold dear. We are the custodians of that faith. We<br />
in the Liberal Party are the custodians of that justice and we<br />
have to see that there is justice and fairness for ail Australians<br />
and we also have to see that people who have profited by the </p>
<p>-NSW STATE COUNCIL-8<br />
illicit and proper practice of these schemes, pay the taxes<br />
that are due to the Commonwealth. I said that at a Financial<br />
Review lunch and I think there was far, far more support<br />
than not last Friday. The people who have benefited from<br />
bottom of the harbour schemes are in fact in receipt of<br />
stolen funds. Maybe you want to say stolen from the generality<br />
of taxpayers or stolen from the Commonwealth makes not much<br />
difference. That happens to be the fact of the matter and<br />
we in the Liberal Party need to have a very clear view<br />
of what it is all about and the damage that that does in the<br />
basis of this society.<br />
I have not any doubt that in future years, the Liberal Party<br />
in terms of keeping with its basic philosophies, in terms<br />
of governing as it will always claim and &amp; s it always has in<br />
the widest interest of the great body of Australians wherever<br />
they may be, will be judged by the effectiveness with which<br />
we grapple, deal with and eradicate this particular problem<br />
from the body of Australian society.<br />
If the present Budget is to be remembered for any particular<br />
thing, one could have said for support for families, for its<br />
tax cuts, for its innovations in welfare, but if it is to be<br />
remembered for any particular thing, I would like to suggest<br />
that there is one other that is more important. I believe<br />
the Budget establishes, the basis for working to together, for<br />
Australians recognisin~ g that there are basic and severe<br />
problems within this society, but if we in the Federal Government<br />
are going to say it is all Mr Wran's fault, or it is all Mr Cain's<br />
fault, or all the unions' fault, then you leave divisions within<br />
the society and make it harder for Australians to work together<br />
and the real point of the present situation is that unless we<br />
do work together, states and Commonwealth, unions and management<br />
then we won't overcome the difficulties we face, there will<br />
be more problems, greater hardship and more unemployed.<br />
I believe one of the great wishes, yearnings through the body<br />
politic at the present time is to see people in position of<br />
authority whether it is in government or in unions or in management<br />
exhibiting not only a desire but a capacity to work together<br />
in the interests of all Australianc.<br />
I think you would have seen some of the statements by Mr Dolan<br />
in relation to the Budget, and I don't want to encroach into<br />
Ian Macphee' s area, except to make just one point. The newspapers<br />
all picked up the critical things he had to say about the Budget<br />
and they are affiliated with the Labor Party. I suppose they had<br />
to say some critical things. But in that critical statement there<br />
was still one sentence of great significance and tax cuts<br />
and the social welfare changes announced in the Budget create<br />
the conditions for wage restraint in 1982-83. That was the<br />
kind of statement that we wanted to hear and sometimes it is<br />
necessary to cut through the froth and the bubble to try and<br />
get down to the substance of what is happening. I believe<br />
that Ian will be able to achieve wage restraint with the<br />
relationships he has established and with the basis of the<br />
Budget to work upon. but certainly it is going be vastly<br />
important to Australia and for the success of this country in<br />
the coming period to achieve that. 8 </p>
<p>NSW STATE COUNCIL<br />
I believe that it is only the Liberal Party that can establish<br />
the circumstances in which all Australians can work together<br />
and again, that emphasises the responsibility we have to all<br />
Australians. The Liberal responsibility to NSW and to<br />
Australia is great indeed. Together we can build a better,<br />
a greater and a more just society. Working together we can<br />
build a better life for all Australians and working toqether<br />
we can, in what later might appear to be a relatively short<br />
time or perhaps a bad dream for a few months or a year or so,<br />
get through this difficult period ahead of us much, much<br />
better than under any other circumstances.<br />
I would like to thank you all for being here tonight, but in<br />
particular I would like to thank you all for the magnificent<br />
support that you have given the Federal Government over the<br />
years and for the magnificent team that you have sent to join<br />
in the Federal Government in Canberra. 9 </p>
