ANSWERS 13Y THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, TO QUESTIONS AT A CHAMBER OF COMMERCE<br />
LUN CHEON<br />
Launceston, 6th July. 1961<br />
Could I ask the Prime Minister: If the Governw nt is opposed<br />
to direct import control what steps will be used to curb the import of<br />
non-essentials and thus maintain a favourable balance of payments?<br />
Mr. Menzies: Mr. Chiairman this is a pretty comprehensive question, and<br />
perhaps letsme in for a rather longer answer than you might want.<br />
I first of all want to remind you that the quantitative<br />
control of imports, such as by import licensing, is available to<br />
Australia only to protect our balance of payments. We are a nation and<br />
we are parties to international contracts; and we cannot face GATT,<br />
we cannot face the International Monetary Fund, we cannot face any of<br />
these bodies to which we are contractually engaged if we use<br />
quantitative restrictions on imports except to protect the balance of<br />
payments, to protect our overseas reserves.<br />
And that, of course, is one of the dominating reasons why,<br />
at a time when our overseas reserves were high and healthy, we did not<br />
feel able to continue import licensing and said that we must revert to<br />
the traditional and proper practice of tariffs to protect Australian<br />
industry. Now what happened last year was this: that the volune of<br />
imports continued at a very high level. Whenever we are well off in<br />
Australia and if I may recall you to these happy events we have been<br />
pretty well off haven't we, as a Nation? it reflects itself in the<br />
buying of imports. Under those circumstances we had to decide whether<br />
we were to deal with that problem, the problem of our overseas balances<br />
by quantitatively restricting imports once more, or by pursuing<br />
internal financial policies which would tend to reduce the demand for<br />
imports. The first was really not lawfully available to us; the<br />
second was. Now I have heard it said by a lot of people, quite a few<br />
people, that if we wanted to do the right thing we would restore import<br />
licensing, this vague, administrative pmtective policy, this<br />
protection of Australian manufacturing industry at the whim of a<br />
Minister, or an official. de could do that, it was said, and, at the<br />
same time, loosen out on what I believe is known affectionately as<br />
" the credit squeeze". The answer to that, quite simply, is you can't<br />
do both. I want to-' have it plainly understood that confronted by a<br />
boom in 1960 we had two weapons that we could employ one was to<br />
increase the supply of goods to match the enormous purchasing power.<br />
The other one was to back up the action of the central bank, the<br />
Reserve Bank, in maintaining a control a close control, of the Banking<br />
policy of the Banks. And we tried both. If we hadn't got rid of<br />
import licensing I just want to tell you that credit restriction in<br />
Australia would have needed to be much more severe than it was.<br />
If you have two weapons to use in a fight against inflation,<br />
and you abandon one, then of course, obviously, you must use the other<br />
one more. We decided to use both; and to use both with discretion.<br />
And, I think, both with some success. -Oecause in point of fact, Sir, </p>
<p>what has happened about imports?. The domestic policies have not been,<br />
you know, half as severe as people think the total of bank advances<br />
today is higher than it was a year ago so don't let's exaggerate<br />
these matters by some particular, personal experience. Imports<br />
maintained themselves at a very high level in January, fell away a<br />
little in February, fell avay a little not too much, not enough<br />
perhaps, in March imports in May and June have come down from what?<br />
from a little over Å lO00m. in January to Å 78m. in May, to Å. 74mn. I read<br />
in the newspapers this morning, in June. The result of that is that<br />
our overseas balances, our overseas reserves, are immeasurably more<br />
healthy at the end of June than we ever expected them to be in<br />
November of last year. So that for better or for worse, for richer<br />
or for poorer, the policies, the domestic policies that have been<br />
employed, have corrected the balance of payments problem.<br />
I don't need to say to any banker here today, or to any<br />
business man here today, that the state of our balances overseas has<br />
the most direct impact on the liquidity of the banking structure in<br />
Australia. All you need to do is to have your overseas balances come<br />
down Å lO0m. a year, Å-150m. a year, and the Head Office of the Bank will<br />
very soon be telling its Branches that " to protect our liquidity in<br />
this state of affairs we must begin to call in overdrafts, we must begin<br />
to be a little careful about making new advances".* These are, after<br />
all, elementary considerations. And I am, myself, very satisfied about<br />
the fact that in the last two months of this financial year results<br />
have been achieved from this unpopular policy they tell me results<br />
have been achieved which I am bound to tell you are better than I<br />
myself hoped for. Of course the effect of that is that so long as we<br />
behave sensibly, so long as we pursue moderate policies not terribly<br />
severe policies, but moderate policies over the last 12 months I<br />
would hope that in the next 12 months we would have no problem on our<br />
overseas balances at all. That is one big factor in the economic<br />
position which, under no circumstances, would be disposed of.<br />
As for the re: st, well, we will see how it goes. I am not<br />
going to tell any of you, because it wouldn't be true that we are<br />
proposing to re-introduce import licensing; we're not, we're not. I<br />
have never believed that import licensing ought to be a second line of<br />
protection and I may look any manufacturer in Australia in the eye and<br />
remind him that at least six times a year, for years and years, I have<br />
publicly stated " This is not a line of protection; this is introduced<br />
to protect our balances of payments and it is not to be regarded by<br />
any industry as a sort of second protective tariff". And if people<br />
don't believe you, well, that's jus'L too bad. It has been said time<br />
after time, " I~ f you want good Government, if you want honest<br />
administration" and of course you do " if you want Australian<br />
manufacturing industry, which has achieved such magnificent results in<br />
Australia over these years, to be healthy, to look forward and grow in<br />
a state of health then let it depend on a protective tariff arrived at<br />
through the proper machinery and don't let it depend on the goodwill of<br />
a few politicians, or of a few civil servants".<br />
Question: Mr. Chairman I would like to ask the Prime Minister, leaving<br />
the domestic scene for the moment, to say something to us about the<br />
implications to the West of the possible signing of a Peace Treaty<br />
between Khrushchev and E~ ast Germany?<br />
Mr. Menzies: Well, Sir, this is a very interesting question to me<br />
because how long ago was it? about 9 months ago, 8 months ago, I<br />
had a long private discussion with Khrushchev in New York. This was one<br />
of the things we talked about. I wouldn't have you believe that<br />
Khrushchev is not incapable of bluff he's the greatest master of it<br />
in the modern world he's got a nice earthy sense of humour, rather<br />
eaflant . n~ </p>
<p>farm-yard sense of humour, if you simple Launcestonians understand, and<br />
his favourite threat even then was " Well you know unless you are<br />
prepared to abandon this position that you have about Berlin'I'm going<br />
to sign a Treaty, a Peace Treaty, with East Germany; and I11ll invite<br />
a" ltlh att hme eapneso polef wchoou rsfeo, u gPhrte saigdaeinnts, t Gtehratm anwye wiinl lt heb e lagteet twianrg" . a n Sion viIt astaiiodn,<br />
for Australia to attend?" He said, " Yes, that's quite right, quite<br />
right". -And I said " The idea will be to have a Treaty with East<br />
Germany, and the making of a Treaty with East Germany will mean the<br />
permanent recognition of the division of Germany, the partition of<br />
Germany?" Yes, that's the position.<br />
Now this is going to give rise to the most tremendous problems,<br />
It is very hard for us to know what the Russian mind is: I've seen Old<br />
you know, with the shoe off, beating on the desk with his shoe,<br />
AUI this rather silly propaganda, which is designed to affect weakminded<br />
people -and, therefore, I am happy to say, has no effect<br />
whatever on us -all this kind of guff goes on. But I think that down<br />
underneath it all the Russians are afraid of a unified Germany. And<br />
of course we are pretty broad-minded people ourselves we forget and<br />
we forgive but it is still true that twice in this century a powerful<br />
Germany has set the world at war. Therefore one can understand this<br />
feeling: they are afraid of a unified Germany.<br />
The whole difficulty about it is that they prefer a disunited<br />
Germany at the risk of a world war, to a united Germany with peace.<br />
And that doesn't make much sense to me; nor indeetohrpolei<br />
a position of leadership in the Western worldi. et te epei<br />
Khrushchev, of course, when the time comes, will put this<br />
thing very pleasantly. He will say, " Now we want Berlin to be a free<br />
city. We are not claiming territorial rights over it. We want it to<br />
be a free city. But there are to be no troops of Western communities<br />
ensconsed in W4est Berlin. And we will make a 29aty with East Germany".<br />
And of course a Treaty with East Germany, from the Soviet point of<br />
view, will be like a Treaty with Poland: it willfinally incorporate<br />
East Germany into the Soviet zone. And the result of that, even in<br />
the balance in Europe, would be tremendous. But in the short run, I<br />
want to remind you that it is only a few years ago that the Berlin<br />
airlift incident occurred. I was in Berlin at that time and I saw it<br />
going on an airlift by which the Western world challenged the Soviet<br />
Union and succeeded by feeding and supplying WJest Berlin by air<br />
over this forbidden zone. I think that Berlin is no longer to be<br />
regarded just as a city, just as an ancient capital of Germany, or the<br />
not so ancient, perhaps, but at any rate the capital of Germany; Berlin<br />
has become a symbol. If Berlin passes into the hands of the Communist<br />
group then this is their crowning triumph in Europe. And these people,<br />
when they have a crowning triumph, don't stop there; they decide to<br />
look for the next one. This is another great victory in the cold war<br />
cold war meaning 4 war in which you get all you can without actually<br />
discharging nuclear weapons.<br />
In Great Britain I think that that is understood. I am<br />
perfectly certain that in America It is well understood. There have<br />
been such tremendous achievements of friendship between De Gaulle and<br />
Adenauer, as I know as a result of discussions, myself, with each of<br />
them, that France itself feels that Berlin is a symbol. And I think<br />
we Just have to keep our fingers crossed, because I think that K. will<br />
bluff and bluff and bluff up to the very point at which he feels<br />
convinced that this means a nuclear war. I don't think he wants a<br />
nuclear war. But if he finds that bluff pays off and that people will<br />
retreat, he may ultimately become so excited by his own advance that he<br />
takes the risk. If we reach New Year's Day 1962 with no explosion,<br />
great or small, over Berlin, I will be among the happiest people here<br />
present. </p>
<p>Question: I would like to ask the Prime Minister what his opinion is of<br />
the possibility of Great Britain joining the European Common Market and<br />
the effect that that would have on the sale of our primary products in<br />
Great Britain?<br />
Mr. denzies: Well, Mr. Chairman, you must not tempt me too much on this<br />
matter. When I leave here later this afternoon and go back to<br />
Melbourne this Is a problem I am discussing with Mr. McEwen tonight,<br />
and with Mr. Duncan Sandys tomorrow, and the following day. And of<br />
course it is g tremendous problem, tremendous. It has political<br />
implications, and it has economic implications, particularly for our own<br />
primary industries; and even more for the primary industries of New<br />
Zealand. For two years every time I have seen U. K. representatives<br />
I have said, " WJe must be consulted before you take any steps". And<br />
that has been long since agreed to. So the principle of consultation<br />
has been established very plainly over the last two years, but so far<br />
we haven't had any consultation. But consultation begins tomorrow<br />
afternoon if I see the distance. ' Whether it will be consultation in<br />
the real sense of getting down to brass tacks or not, I don't know,<br />
But just so that you will see the general picture, here it is.<br />
It may be that the United Kingdom should have joined the<br />
Common Market before it began you know that is a bit Irish, but still<br />
you know what I mean. When the six powers were negotiating the-. Treaty'<br />
of Rome it may be that the Unitd Kingdom should have looked forward and<br />
said, " Now we must be in this on the ground floor so that as one of the<br />
original founders we can negotiate to protect the Commonwealth<br />
interests". I think there is an awful lot to be said for that view.<br />
But still that is water under the bridge. The fact is that they didn't.<br />
the &amp; ropean Common Market has been established.<br />
You all of course know, broadly, what it means: here you have<br />
six powers each of them with varying industrial experiences. First,<br />
West Germany, thanks to the German genius for work, tremendously<br />
flourishing, France rather in the doldrums, Italy a bit each way; and<br />
then, as a result of this organisation with free access to the raw<br />
maturials of each other, with a free movement of labour from one area<br />
to another, with, at the end of 12 years of which three have now gone,<br />
or four have now gone, a' cominon barrier in customs against the rest of<br />
the world, this to produce a community of people rather larger than the<br />
United States of America. Wdith all these internal advantages, it is<br />
a tremendous thing. The effect, so far, on the strength of the<br />
European economy has been enormous. And it will grow, and grow.<br />
And so Great Britain comes along now, rather at a<br />
disadvantage, with Europe saying, "' Well if you care to join, all right;<br />
but of course you sign on the dotted line". And if Great Britain says,<br />
" Well we can't sign on the dotted line, we have enormous obligations<br />
and advantages out of the Commonwealth structure. We have<br />
preferences in Australia which are even more valuable to us than the<br />
Australian preferenges into the United Kingdom". Because that is true.<br />
But from our point of view what a calamitous state of affairs it would<br />
be if the goods that we now sell into the United Kingdom, duty free,<br />
had to be submitted to the Common External Customs barrier of the<br />
European Common Market. So you might be paying 15 or 20% duty on<br />
wheat, to take a simple example, into Great Britain.<br />
And this, of course, is a tremendous problem. Can they go<br />
into the Exropean Common Market without sacrificing Commonwealth<br />
interests? Can they go into the &amp; iropean Common Market on terms which<br />
the dther six countries don't accord to any other of their members? I<br />
Would have thought it was rather improbable. </p>
<p>That is why, in the economic field, I regard these<br />
discussions, which will open with a few " sighting" shots in my office<br />
tomorrow afternoon, economically, as perhaps the most important<br />
discussions we have ever had; certainly the most important in my,<br />
political lifetime. So that is one aspect of it. And I assure you<br />
we are not going to surrender at the first blast, or the second, or the<br />
third. I know what the interests of my own country are, and they wiii<br />
be pursued and defended. I have the great advantage of knowing the<br />
people with whom I am conducting the battle.<br />
But there is a second aspect of this matter and I would like<br />
you all to have it in mind; and that is the political aspect. This<br />
Commonwealth of ours has suffered a few changes, hasn't it, in modern<br />
times? I used to be regarded by people under the influence of a good<br />
dinner as a great Commonwealth man. I've got to a stage when I wouldn't<br />
be dogmatic about anything connected with the Commonwealth. I think we<br />
made an awful blunder at London by butting in on the domestic affairs<br />
of a Commonwealth country, a step from which there can be no retreat.<br />
But now, what are we looking at?<br />
The object of the Treaty of Rome is not only economic, but<br />
political: to strengthen the political unity of Western Europe. Now<br />
that is a very fine thing. President Kennedy has undoubtedly been<br />
pressing this for political reasons: he wants to have Great Britain in<br />
the European community politically, so as to exercise judgment and<br />
wisdom and authority, and to maittain that community with an outwardlooking<br />
eye, instead of being too domestic. There is no doubt about<br />
what is in his mind on this matter. At any rate I know what is in his<br />
mind on this matter.<br />
But you know in the old Commonwealth if I may speak with a<br />
certain amount of nostalgia one discussed matters with Great Britain,<br />
these were family matters, you talked to Great Britain not to Great<br />
Britain plus X Y Z, but to Great Britain. We knew their mind; they<br />
knew our mind. We sat around with the other members of the family and<br />
we might agree, or we might disagree; but we all knew in what capacity<br />
we were talking to each other. But if the European Common Market is<br />
to produce its political fruit, then the political fruit must be<br />
political unity in Western Europe.<br />
Unity is an ambiguous word. Italy, and I think Adenauer in<br />
Germany, think of it in'terms of an integration of the Western European<br />
world one great new Western European community. But Charles De Gaulle*<br />
who is, of course, a great nationalist doesn't think of it in those<br />
terms; he won't have integration. 3ut he does believe in<br />
Confederation that an independent France and an independent Germany,<br />
and an independent Great Britain will all be bound together in a sort<br />
of Confederacy of States for the peace of the world.<br />
Now gentlemen I am not pre-judging this matter. It may be a<br />
very good thing. It may be that we are living in a twilight world, and<br />
that this will be the new dawn. I don't know, I'm not automatically<br />
against it. All I am saying to you is that when Great Britaih becomes<br />
not Great Britain, a single home nation of the British Commonwealth, but<br />
a member of a group of European nations with obligations to all the<br />
other members of the group, then the character of the British Commonwealth<br />
will have sustained its final change. </p>
