FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 6 SEPTEMBER 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
( The weekly Prime Ministerial electorate talk is today given<br />
by the Treasurer, Mr John Howard.)<br />
Today I would like to . say something about the subject of<br />
resource development. This has been very much in the news over<br />
the past week or two and the debate we have had is very welcome:<br />
because it enables all of us to see the issue in proper<br />
perspective. I think the Acting Prime Minister, Doug Anthony, put his<br />
finger very much on the point when he said that we neither have<br />
a boom or a mirage so far as our resource development is<br />
concerned. There can be no doubt that resource development<br />
in Australia is proceeding at a very, very rapid rate and very<br />
strongly. There can be no argument that our reserves of energy,<br />
in partic-ular, are very keenly sought and any examination of<br />
what has happened to the patterns of investment in this country<br />
over the last few years will indicate the enormous amount of<br />
money which has gone into resource development. In the last<br />
financial year alone, there was a rise of no less than 21% in<br />
real terms in the total volume of business investment in Australia<br />
and that was the sharpest rise in this country for more than<br />
years. Not all of that investment went into the resources<br />
area, but a very major part of it did and that figure alone<br />
illustrates both the willingness and the capacity of people<br />
both here and abroad to invest in the resource future of this<br />
country. But these developments do not mean that across the whole sectrum<br />
of the resource industries is the development proceeding at*<br />
the same pace and with the same degree of strength, nor do<br />
these developrments deny the fact that even in an era of strong<br />
resource growth there will be periods during which Particular<br />
minerals will not be in heavy demand, and p eriods during which<br />
individual comdpanies will exnperience slack activity and lessened<br />
demand for particular minerals. In other words a period of<br />
strong resource growth does not mean that every company will a: lways<br />
produce strong results, nor that every mineral will always be in<br />
constantly heavy demand. It is important, therefore, that we<br />
preserve a sense of balance and ' nersnective about the nature<br />
of resource development in this country. There can be no<br />
doubt about its strength, but equally, there will be occasions<br />
when uneven patterns emerge. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
The question inevitably arises in such a consideration, as to<br />
what is the proper role of the Government. I believe the<br />
proper role of the Government is to create the right economic<br />
climate for the sensible and responsible development of our<br />
mineral resources. We do this by creating an anti-inflationary<br />
climate and there can be no doubt that this Government has laboured<br />
very hard to bring down this country's rate of inflation, to<br />
produce a reduced domestic cost structure, and to make Australian<br />
industry as competitive as possible abroad.. More particularly,<br />
we have followed a foreign investment policy which has made it<br />
attractive for foreigners to invest in this country, whilst at<br />
the same time showing a determination to preserve for Australians<br />
a proper share of the development of our natural resources.<br />
. Achieving this balance has not always been easy, but there can.<br />
be no doubt about the resolve of the Fraser Government to<br />
continue with a foreign investment policy which maximises the<br />
advantages of foreign investment, whilst at the same time<br />
making absolutely certain that Austral. ians have a proper<br />
share of the domestic action, so far as the ownership of our<br />
resources is concerned.<br />
The Government's policy of pricing our fuel at the world level<br />
is another exampleof following the right policy at the right<br />
time which has had a significant effect on the investment<br />
climate and also upon the development of our resources. There<br />
can be no doubt that this particular policy of the Government<br />
has encouraged investment not only in further oil exploration in<br />
Australia, but also in the development of alternative energy<br />
sources. Without this policy that particular investment<br />
would not have occurred, and is thus a prime example of<br />
Government policy improving the investment climate and making<br />
it more attractive from a business point of view to sensibly<br />
exploit the natural resources that this country has.<br />
These thoughts all add up to one thing, that it is the role of<br />
the Government to create the right overall economic climate.<br />
It is then the role of private enterprise and commerce in<br />
Australia to make the necessary investment and entrepreneurial<br />
decisions. Creating the right climate and maintaining it does<br />
not mean that all of the rules of the game are going to remain<br />
immutable for all time. Governments must have the right, on<br />
occasions, and according to changed circumstances, to vary some of the<br />
rules which affect business operations in this country.<br />
