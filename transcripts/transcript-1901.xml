EXPO 70 L<br />
ANNOUNCEMVEi-4T BY' TEE PRIME MI1NL* STER,<br />
MjR1 N GORTON, OF DESiGN FOR AUSTRALLIN<br />
PAVILION AT OSAKA JULY 1968<br />
Admiral Morrison, Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
This is an opportunity which I am glad to take to announce<br />
the selection of the design for the Australian pavilion for EXPO 70. You<br />
can see it, and I hope you will agree with me that it is an imaginative and<br />
eye-catching concept and one which I think will do us credit in Osaka.<br />
This design was chosen because it-was considered that it<br />
had those qualities of originality and aesthetic appeal which are most<br />
likely to capture the imaginations of those citizens who go through this<br />
exhibition in Japan. I don't propose to dwell at any length on its interesting<br />
features because these will be described to you later by those who know<br />
them in -much more detail and who are able to give a much better detailed<br />
description both of the building and of the tube in which the exhibition itself<br />
is to be laid out. It is not surprising, but it is worth mentioning that the design<br />
of the building, coming from the Department of Works, was due to the work<br />
of the same architect who designed our building in Montreal a highl y<br />
successful building in that exhibition.<br />
Nor is it surprising that the layout of the exhibition itself,<br />
as distinct from the building, has as its architect I expect that is the<br />
word.... designer, whatever it might the man responsible is again<br />
Robin Boyd who was responsible for the interior layout of the building<br />
designed by Mr Maccormickc for Montreal.<br />
I think the displays and I think you will agree when you hear a bout<br />
, them. to be shown in this building, will be just as exciting as the<br />
building is itself, and will be just as imaginative.<br />
International expositions such as this bring together from all<br />
parts of the world the most adva-aced innovations in design, architectq~ re,<br />
in display of exhibits and in film techniques. To make an impact in this<br />
kind of exposition, we have to be contemporary and we hrne to be imaginative.<br />
I hope that as you learn more about the way in which the design is to be<br />
laid out and as you examine the building, you will agree that we are being<br />
contemporary and we are being imaginative in this instance.<br />
I think all I wish to say in addition to that are some words on<br />
the scale of our participation, as a nation, in this exposition. The<br />
budget for this exhibit will be something of the order of $ 6 million ( Australian).<br />
But we see this as well worth expending at a time when we are having closer<br />
and closer contact with Japan in trade and indeed in many other ways. We<br />
feel that the millions of people in Japan who will, we confidently expect, go<br />
through this building, examine the exhibits and form an impression of our / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
nation from which the exhibits came and in which the building was designed,<br />
will go away with. a better understanding of our nation-and will go away with<br />
a feeling, perhaps developed above that high level at which it at present<br />
stands. This, I think, is full justification for us, a growing nation,<br />
and a nation to grow yet more, to take part in this international exposition<br />
on the scale on which we propose and with the building you see before you<br />
and with the exhibits that will be described to you. </p>
