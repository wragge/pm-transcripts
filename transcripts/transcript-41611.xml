    <content><![CDATA[<p>Critical design work on the Turnbull Government’s Future Submarine Program will move to South Australia from 2022, fuelling more local jobs and investment.</p>
<p>The 12 new submarines will be constructed in Adelaide, utilising a national supply chain and ensuring this $50 billion initiative is completed with Australian expertise.</p>
<p>The project will deliver the best submarines to the Royal Australian Navy, and create almost 3000 jobs directly and throughout the supply chain.</p>
<p>Now the Turnbull Government is also confirming that the detailed design work will move from France to Australia in 2022.</p>
<p>Currently, initial design work is taking place in Adelaide and Cherbourg, France.</p>
<p>Up to 270 Australian jobs will be created in the detailed design and production planning activities.</p>
<p>This announcement coincides with the visit to Australia by the French President, Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>The engagement of France’s Naval Group represents the enormous opportunity being delivered through Australia’s strategic partnership with France.</p>
<p>Naval Group’s commitment to building Australia’s sovereign defence industry capability is reinforced by the decision to migrate detailed design of the Future Submarine to Australia.</p>
<p>Preparations will involve a range of training activities for Australians to ensure they achieve the necessary qualifications and develop the essential skills to undertake both detailed design and production planning.</p>
<p>Undertaking the detailed design and production planning locally will ensure our sovereignty goals are met, in a smooth transition to construction of the submarines in Adelaide.</p>
<p>During detailed design the Future Submarines will be developed and planned to a high level of precision using advanced computer-aided software, which includes the layout of all systems in each compartment of the submarine.</p>
<p>At the same time, the schedule for the construction of the submarine will be planned in detail, guiding shipyard workers on each stage of the build.</p>
<p>More than 600 Australian companies have so far registered interest with Naval Group to be part of the Program.</p>
