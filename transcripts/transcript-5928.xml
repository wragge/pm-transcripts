Fl. PRIME MINISTER]<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDANY, OCTOBER 4 1982<br />
COMONWLTn RECEPTION, BRTSBANg<br />
I am very happy for all Australians to welcome all OLUr<br />
guests to Australia. The Games have grown enormovsly since<br />
they were first held in Australia, in Sydney, in 1938.<br />
Then there were only 15 nations and I think 500 athletea<br />
came across by ship. In Perth in 1962, there were 35 nations<br />
and 1,000 athletes. Now there are 45 nations and ove-r 2,000<br />
athletes.<br />
The Ommnes have grow,. n a8 the Commonwealth has gr'own. The opening<br />
-ceremony I believe says something about Aust-ralia. hope it<br />
says eomething about Australia. to all Australians as well as to<br />
our guests. ' The fact that so many different cultural groups,<br />
people from countries or different countries of 6rigin took<br />
part in that opening ceremony says something about the lnodezn<br />
Australia which 4. s so different from the Australia of years<br />
ago.. Pp-rhaos not all oux visitors and our guests know that mny<br />
of those different groups, caime to JAustralia for ons very<br />
simple reason, th-ey wanted to come to a countryr ir which .: they<br />
could be free, and thiey cam. e to Australia.<br />
The Cozmonwaalth stands for values that are of great importance,<br />
t-hat help to advance those values. The Comonwealth Gaines<br />
also advancea those values and in doing so the Cowmonwealth<br />
is strengthened--and the Commonwealth Games are strengthened.<br />
I think we have had -people who hav; e predicted doom and disaster<br />
in past years about Commonwealth Heads of ozvernments fieetings<br />
They have eaid they will not get through the agenda, they will<br />
blow up, they will fall apart. There were even people saying<br />
there would not be a Commonwealth Games, but mostly in the<br />
newspapers and not anywhere else.<br />
I would like to thank you all for coming to demonstrate if nothing<br />
else that oiAr newspapers are not always right. But really, I<br />
know fthere are a great many people who have warked to make<br />
these Games a succezs. I know there are many people who have<br />
worked to avert the dangers and difficulties and the sensitivities<br />
that could have upset the holding of these Games.<br />
I thin) k it may be invidious to mention any particular participating<br />
teamo or any particular participating country, but I am going<br />
to run the zisk of mentioning one country because I think one<br />
country,.,'* athletio and cultuiral team that is here epitomises<br />
so muchi of -what the Commonwealth stands for, and<br />
I believe it stands for something of very great value. Ii<br />
would like to welcome, and I hope you would all join me in<br />
welcoming our visitors from Zimbabwe-. Tha preserna of our </p>

our guests from Zimbabwe demonstrates that the Co-ononwealth<br />
not only can. be, but has been when put to the test, thoroughly<br />
successful in what it sought to do, and that it can contribute<br />
to finding peaceful solutions and that it is releveant to the<br />
modern world and can contribute to the solutions of some of<br />
the problerms of the modern world.<br />
I would like to thank all of those who made the Games possible.<br />
I am glad to see that they meet difficulties about their<br />
constitution, which I am told are going to be solved easily<br />
in a day or so. I know a great deal of work is going into<br />
that. That again is a practical example of the ComTmonwealth<br />
working to find the solutions because its members have<br />
wanted to find the solutions ones; that would work.<br />
I would like to wish all good fortune to competitors who<br />
still have to run their race. I hope you won't nind if<br />
I am mildly pro-Australian where Australians are competing,<br />
but if there are no Australians in a particular race or<br />
contest, I am prepared to be totally impartial as I am<br />
in my politics, Thank you all for coming and I hope you<br />
will join with me in giving a warm welcome to the Duke<br />
of Edinburgh who is amongst us at the present time. </p>
