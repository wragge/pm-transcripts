PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE DEATH OF BRETT WHITELEY<br />
I was saddened today to learn of the death of the great<br />
Australian artist Brett Whiteley.<br />
Brett Whiteley was probably Australia's most significant<br />
contemporary artist. I had a high personal regard for him<br />
and for his work. His immense contribution to our<br />
nation's art and culture will be remembered.<br />
CANBERRA 16 June 1992 </p>
