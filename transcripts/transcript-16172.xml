    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, HE Mr Nguyen Tan Dung, will visit Canberra and Melbourne from 12  -  14 October.</p>
<p>This year marks the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and Vietnam in February 1973.</p>
<p>Australia and Vietnam enjoy a strong relationship and we cooperate on many important regional and international challenges, including anti-people smuggling and human trafficking measures.</p>
<p>Vietnam is one of Australia's most dynamic trading partners in South-east Asia.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade has grown an average of 20 per cent per year over the last five years to reach $6.9 billion in 2007-08.</p>
<p>Australia is Vietnam's 16th largest investor and the Vietnamese economy holds many opportunities for Australian business.</p>
<p>Australia is a leading education destination for Vietnamese students with almost 13,000 Vietnamese enrolments in Australia.</p>
<p>Australia is also very active in delivering education and training in Vietnam, with around 10,000 Vietnamese students studying for an Australian qualification in-country.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister Dung ways in which we can further strengthen the cooperation between our countries. </p>
