    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Ten years ago last Tuesday, my friend Bob Carr opened the Visy plant at Tumut.</p>
<p>It was Visy's first big venture into clean energy based on the sustainable re-use of manufacturing by-products.</p>
<p>Today we welcome the second.</p>
<p>Across that decade, Visy's commitment has remained unchanged.</p>
<p>What has changed, however, is the absence of a great Australia, Richard Pratt, and today we remember him with affection and respect.</p>
<p>There is much of Richard's spirit in this plant.</p>
<p>His sense of the future.</p>
<p>His sense of uniting environmental imperatives with commercial opportunities.</p>
<p>His sense of his family and his company as good corporate citizens.</p>
<p>And all those things remain true today.</p>
<p>Friends, I often speak of a clean energy future and I know it can sound like an abstraction sometimes.</p>
<p>But I would simply say to the critics and the sceptics: Come to Coolaroo and see for yourselves.</p>
<p>This is what the clean energy future looks like.</p>
<p>The intelligent application of technology to the challenges facing our planet.</p>
<p>Achieved in a way that fosters investment, profits and jobs.</p>
<p>That's why I say I'm an optimist about our nation's ability to embrace a clean energy future.</p>
<p>Because the signs are here already.</p>
<p>At Coolaroo and Tumut.</p>
<p>At the geothermal facility I saw in the streets of suburban Brunswick.</p>
<p>The new solar energy facility in Newcastle.</p>
<p>The wind farm that Crown Prince Frederick inspected yesterday at Macarthur  -  the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The new gas-fired power stations set to go up in Queensland.</p>
<p>All of these projects are a down-payment on the clean energy future we can build together as a nation.</p>
<p>Yes today projects like Coolaroo are the exception.</p>
<p>In a clean energy future, they will become the norm.</p>
<p>They will be places of opportunity for Australians.</p>
<p>Our tradies and engineers will find work on such projects.</p>
<p>Our kids will learn about them at uni and TAFE.</p>
<p>Our whole economy will be re-tooled as we see $100 billion invested in clean energy over the next 40 years.</p>
<p>I'm hugely optimistic about that future.</p>
<p>It means innovation.</p>
<p>It means investment</p>
<p>It means jobs  -  high skill, high wage jobs for our regions as well as our cities.</p>
<p>Above all, it means keeping our planet safe and clean for our grandchildren and their grandchildren.</p>
<p>With the carbon price, we're embarking on a great journey together as a nation.</p>
<p>A transformational journey.</p>
<p>A reform as big as any we've seen in the postwar era.</p>
<p>Such decisions are never easy at the time.</p>
<p>But who would have it any other way?</p>
<p>Who want anything less than a government taking the big decisions for a nation's future ensuring we land on the right side of history.</p>
<p>That's what we've done.</p>
<p>Now that the work of legislation is complete, the work of our business sector begins.</p>
<p>Because it is your ingenuity that will make our carbon future a reality.</p>
<p>That's why we chose a market mechanism.</p>
<p>And indeed only yesterday the OECD released a new report which is the latest piece of expert advice calling for action to reduce carbon pollution to avoid dangerous climate change.</p>
<p>Importantly the OECD confirms that putting a price on carbon is the most effective policy because it creates dynamic incentives for investment in cleaner technologies and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The âhidden hand' of the market made us prosperous in the three centuries since the Industrial Revolution began.</p>
<p>The same âhidden hand' will help us overcome the unintended consequences of the Industrial Revolution that take the form of climate change.</p>
<p>Firms like Visy are already on the way.</p>
<p>Others will come to learn that acting on carbon is not a drawback but an opportunity.</p>
<p>I'm confident about this because we are a creative and adaptable nation.</p>
<p>Australians can do great things.</p>
<p>We've done them before  -  we can do them again.</p>
<p>This facility is proof.</p>
<p>I welcome it.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing more of the same across our great nation.</p>
<p>And I take pride in declaring the Visy clean energy plant officially open. </p>
