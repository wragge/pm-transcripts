FOR PRESS P. M. No. 31/ 1961<br />
P, 2MvIERS I CONFAIIRENCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister; tb. I_ eer1t Menzies<br />
Arrangements have been made with the State Premiers<br />
for a Premiers' Conference to be held in Canberra on 22nd<br />
and 23rd April.<br />
Ihen the present arrangements for Commonwealth<br />
financial assistance to the States were worked out in 1959,<br />
it was generally accepted that, unless there were some major<br />
change in circumstances, those arrangements would carry on<br />
for six years. That period will come to an end with this<br />
financial year and the forthcoming Conference between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States will consider arrangements for<br />
the ensuing period.<br />
This is a large and complex subject and it will be<br />
necessary to go into its various aspects thoroughly in the<br />
light of past experience and future prospects. The purpose<br />
of this meeting is to discuss the matter generally so that<br />
the main issues may be identified and to enable State or<br />
Commonwealth representatives to bring forward for consideration<br />
any proposals for changes in the current arrangements.<br />
A further meeting to settle new arrangements in detail will,<br />
I expect, be necessary later, and this is likely to take<br />
place early in June.<br />
CANBERRiA, 11th March, 1965. </p>
