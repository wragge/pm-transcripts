AUSTRALIA CLUB,. LONDON<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
28TH JUNE, 1965<br />
On the whole I think that what I ought to do is to say<br />
" thank you", to say that I concur with all the bits that didn't<br />
relate to me and to sit down, because I am here in a glittering<br />
company. Hlere is Lord Baillieu, very modest about himself, one<br />
of the great Australians of my lifetime. I see sitting along<br />
here, with characteristic modesty, Alec Douglas-Home. I have<br />
no bias about him at all. All I do is to say that I have<br />
said and I repeat, that I think hie's the greatest man in the<br />
Kingaom and, what is more, a rather tolerant man, because some<br />
of you will recall sitting at an Australia Club Dinner in another<br />
setting when he made a speech about me and I made a speech about<br />
him, and he thought fit on that occasion to make a certain amount<br />
of play about my name remember? Some of you will. He had<br />
discovered that my proper name was " Mingies" and this, of course,<br />
is quite right. I very well remember many years ago being at a big<br />
dinner in London and the gentleman with the red coat, who had<br />
a fine Home Counties accent for public production, vwith a good<br />
Scots burr on his tongue in private, nipped across to me just<br />
before I was to speak and he said " Excuse me, Sir, but am I to<br />
announce you as Menzies or by your proper name?". W~ ord of this<br />
must have reached Alec because on that occasion he made a little<br />
play about the name, and I recalled it with my usual courtesy,<br />
and said that after all we all have a lot to learn and when I<br />
get back home and I am invited by the vicar to go to the concert<br />
of the year, I will expect him to say " And now Miss Flora Smith<br />
will sing for us ' Hume Sweet Huniel". This put a very great<br />
strain on our friendship because three days later he said for<br />
me, " You know, you've made life very troublesome for me. I can't<br />
go to the House of Lords now without being confronted by ' Hume<br />
Sweet Hume'. And I claim some credit, therefore, for the fact<br />
that some time afterwards he left the House of Lords and became<br />
the Prime Minister of this country.<br />
As for Peter Carrington, well he's in the House of Lords.<br />
Hefs the leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords and he's<br />
4. eveloped a line of eloquence which I didn't suspect when he was<br />
in Australia. I remember that after he became the High Commissioner,<br />
I was up at his house for dinner, and after we had<br />
absorbed some frugal provisions and pre-prandial drinks we walked<br />
into the dining-room and on the right as we walked in there was<br />
a portrait of the La~ y Car ing ton with one " Ir" and I said to<br />
him with my usual blushing modesty: " How do you explain this?<br />
Is this a legitimate ancestress of yours~ because you have two<br />
1jr's" He said: " You needn't worry, th name is Smith".<br />
Sdon't need to tell him that he has a great and affectionate<br />
place in the Australian mind.<br />
I'm glad that he referred to Lord Slim and Lord De L'Isle<br />
because I imagine, though I'm constantly being asked questions<br />
about it by the Press, that it's not the easiest business in the<br />
world to be a Governor-General. I've always thought it a<br />
revolting job. You have to be nice to everybody you have to<br />
make a speech but you have t6-Ntake great care that~ it doesn't cut<br />
across the policy of the Goverrimnt, and this I think is a<br />
painful task. o eo o / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I must say that Lord Slim sol~ ved this problem very<br />
easily. He made his own speeches and apologised to me afterwards,<br />
Although Lord De LtIsle, that gallant and distinguished man who<br />
has just ceased to be our Governor-General, didn't quite go so<br />
far as that, I thought he went as near as a man could possibly go,<br />
and I'm delighted that they are both here.<br />
I think it would be a mistake if I didn't say to you that<br />
on all of these occasions I'm delighted to see Lord Bruce. I can<br />
remember him at a time when I was so nervous about even speaking<br />
to him that I found it difficult to speak at all. He's been here<br />
a long time and there are foolish people, I suppose, somewhere in<br />
Australia who still manage to think of him as rather more English<br />
than Australian. I want to take the opportunity of saying in his<br />
presence that so far as I'm concerned, I regard him as one of<br />
the greatest f'rime Ministers that my country has ever had, and<br />
when he ceased to be Prime Minister of Australia, he served<br />
Australia with vigour with force, in this country for years and<br />
years. The name of tanley Melbourne Bruce will never lack a<br />
place, and a high place, in the history of Australia.<br />
Now that we have observed the ol~ d Chinese practice of<br />
meeting each other and exchanging confidence, I wonder if I might<br />
say something to you on my own account because in the last ten<br />
days I've been attending that joyous, jocund thing known as the<br />
Prime Ministerst Conference.<br />
I can remember the time when there were a few of us, and<br />
we sat at the table and there it was, and at the end of a day or<br />
two, we finished our discussion but this year because of the<br />
advance of independence and sell'-government, there were 21 of<br />
us you are only entertaining one Prime Minister, one out of<br />
21 and as each Prime Minister is allowed to have three acolytes<br />
sitting with him, that's a total of 84+ and then there are other<br />
necessary people connected with the Secretariat and so on so that<br />
we sit in Marlborough House with 100 people in the room.<br />
I don't know how you chaps feel but I find it very<br />
difficult to conduct an intimate discussion in the presence of<br />
100 people. This problem is solved by some who give their<br />
speeches to the Press it's a very private meeting you understand,<br />
but in some strange way a number of speeches reach the Press,<br />
sometimes before they are delivered. Therefore, some of the old<br />
intimacy has disappeared and yet it is essential that in a Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference we should endeavour to get to the point<br />
and to register with each other some views about some of the<br />
great problems of the world.<br />
' dell, on this occasion we of course had something to<br />
say about South Vietnam and I want to say something about it to<br />
you myself, because as it turned out we had no time to discuss<br />
the merits of the South Vietnam position. W'e were concerned to<br />
discuss whether we ought, as a Commonwealth to appoint a mission<br />
to go around to the contending parties and lind out whether there<br />
might be some basis for a conference which might lead to peace.<br />
Now that's a modest ambition but still we all thought it was<br />
one worth trying to give effect to but at no time did we discuss<br />
the merits of this matter.<br />
Now, on my way here, I came through the United States of<br />
America where the merits about South Vietnam are hotly contested. 0 1e93 </p>
<p>-3<br />
I come from my own country where the merits are hotly contested.<br />
I come here where I have no doubt, though I wouldn't be dogmatic,<br />
tile merits are hohy contested. But you are not to suppose that<br />
the Prime Ministers' Conference sat in judgment on these matters<br />
or formed an opinion on the merits, but as I happen to have strong<br />
opinions on the merits, I wonder if you would allow me to give<br />
some expression to them here.<br />
Now start with Australia. I don't thing logically that's<br />
the right order but tonight let's start with Australia. We have<br />
the strongest views on this matter, Wde are committed in our public<br />
views and we are committed by a thousand fighting men and a number<br />
of Air Force people in South Vietnam. Now why are we committed?<br />
The answer is one that deserves a little thought.<br />
Unless you are completely theoretical, unless you become<br />
bemused by academic considerations, you must understand that in the<br />
long run the future of freedom depends on defending freedom where<br />
it's attacked. And in South-East Asia we have this position.<br />
We had all the troubles about Vietnam, North Vietnam, South Vietnam,<br />
we had a borderline drawn, we had a demilitarised zone a little on<br />
each side of it, we had undertakings that nobody would cross that<br />
frontier in order to attack on the other wide, and before we were<br />
very much older, the Government of North Vietnam which if I may<br />
say so I think is not unrelated to the Government of k~ king,<br />
found It desirable to incite in South Vietnam the activities of<br />
what we call the Viet Cong rebels armed from the north, not<br />
armed by themselves because they have no resources from which to<br />
arm themselves, but armed from the north, supplied from the north,,<br />
And they began to conduct with all the advantages of a guerrilla<br />
outfit, to attack South Vietnam and the government of South<br />
Vietnam, and, of course, at this time with the monsoons blowing<br />
from north-east and from the north-west, they are able to pursue<br />
their attacks under cover of the cloud and the rain and with all<br />
the elements of surprise.<br />
Now it's perfectly clear to me, and I hope it is to you,<br />
that if this were allowed to go on uninterrupted, the effect would<br />
be that South\ Vietnam would become a communist country just as<br />
North Vietnam is, and if it did, then what would become of Thailand?<br />
What would happen in Laos? What would happen on the flanks of<br />
Malaysia to which not only Australia is committed by her arms but<br />
Great Britain in a very large measure? What would become of these<br />
c2ountries? Theso are practical consideration;;. And because we<br />
realise that the abandonment of South Vietnam in that sense, and<br />
because the Americans realise that the abandonment of South Vietnam<br />
in that sense would mean that the communist tide would sweep right<br />
down to the Timor Sea, we thought we ware not without interest in<br />
it. It's not funny to have a country, a great country as<br />
Peter Carrington has described it, a country with great energy<br />
and great achievement and great hope and a great sense of<br />
independent freedom it's not funny to have it exposed over a<br />
few miles of water to a victorious, onward movement of the<br />
communists, These are the simple facts and the Americans looked<br />
at in the same way. So, you know, I ge~ a little worried about<br />
the misunderstandings that exist between this country and the<br />
United States of America.<br />
There are misunderstandings. There's a bit of a<br />
disposition here to criticise the United States of America. There<br />
always has been in smaller countries a disposition to criticise<br />
great countries. Loet me remind you as I have reminded the<br />
0 a0&amp; 0 a0 0/ 1+ </p>
<p>Congress of the United States and the present President's allies<br />
in the White House that in the nineteenth century which we look<br />
back uponapart from one or two incidents, as a century of<br />
industrial progress and peace and happiness, Great Britain wa$<br />
the great power of the world. How many friends did she have?<br />
How deeply was she loved on the continent of Europe? You've<br />
only to put your mind back to realise that great power which<br />
involves great responsibility has never in our lifetime or our<br />
recorded history involved great popularity.<br />
There's so much nonsense talked about popularity. In<br />
the long run people don't vote for popularity, they vote for<br />
quality and strength and purpose, and in the whole of the nineteenth<br />
century, Great Britain was in that position, and the remarkable<br />
thing in this century is that after the first fifteen or sixteen<br />
years of it, the United States has found itself the greatest<br />
physical power in the world, and I am happy to say has shown a<br />
great willingness to accept the responsibilities ol~ that power.<br />
Let nobody speak cheaply about them. Everybody here<br />
knows my view I am as British as a man could be. Nothing that<br />
I say detracts one whit from my feeling about this country and<br />
its people and its history and its destiny. But don't let us<br />
overlook the fact that in this century the United States, having<br />
come to immense power, having enormous resources, might have been<br />
tempted to say, " Very well, we can live in our own country. We<br />
are st rong we have our resources. Why should we worry about<br />
other people?" 1<br />
And the glorious truth has been that they have not taken<br />
that view. The glorious truth is that, just as Great Britain<br />
did in the nineteenth century, so in ths century they have<br />
accepted the responsibilities of power, and we do ourselves no<br />
good if we fail to realise that profound truth, indeed that most<br />
encouraging truth, most encouraging for all of us.<br />
Now in South Vietnam anyone could say in a cynical<br />
way " Of course Australia would want to take a hand in South<br />
Vietnam because South Vietnam is on the outer perimeter of<br />
Australian defence." 1 I accept that comment. But why are the<br />
Americans there? Now this is a question that all these university<br />
lecturers ought to ask themselves. Why are the Americans there?<br />
I put this question in rather a rhetorical fashion at<br />
a meeting in the Sydney Town Hall. You know what we politicians<br />
are like, we like to put out a rhetorical question, saying to<br />
ourselves, " I hope no-one answers that". I said, " Why are the<br />
Americans there?" and there was, as usual a character up in the<br />
gallery who said, " For profit" and I had to point out that it was<br />
a strange and new definition of profit to be in a country that<br />
cost you millions and from which you got nothing. I couldn't allow<br />
it to be resolved on a commercial basis.<br />
Whiy are they there? Do you know that this is one of<br />
the wonderful things about our time that this country whose<br />
friendship with Great Britain whose friendship with the rest of<br />
us is vital to the future of the world, this country is in South<br />
Vietnam not because South Vietnam as South Vietnam means much to<br />
it but because it believes, as I believe, that freedom, liberty,<br />
call it what you like, is neither divisible nor expendable, but<br />
wherever it's attacked there is the frontier and you either<br />
defend it on that frontier or you engage in the worst kind of<br />
appeasement. Appeasement from weakness was understandable, * a 0 0 1 </p>
<p>appeasement from strength is unpardonable**<br />
It's not so many years ago that the best kind of<br />
American opinion was: Never put troops onto the Asian mainland.<br />
Strategically it's wrong. Tactically it would be disastrous.<br />
But they put them there and they're putting more there and<br />
then having put their troops in and we having agreed that we<br />
would put troops of ours in, somebody pops up at the Prime<br />
Miites Conference and says: " I appeal to the Prime Minister<br />
of Australia to withdraw his battalions"* In other words, " I<br />
invite him to perform the most shameful act in Australian history.,"<br />
And, " I think we all ought to invite the United States not to<br />
bomb north of the border."<br />
Not to bomb? To concede to the enemy all the rights<br />
of uninhibited supply down the route which keeps putting in<br />
material, trained men, and all the time to think: " You stop<br />
doing that and you Australians walk out on them" and this will<br />
be a contribution to pea cet<br />
Look, gentlemen, we're at war. Don't let's make any<br />
mistake about it Welve got into the habit now of using that<br />
strange vocabulary you're not at war until something else<br />
has happened -but there's a war going on in South Vietnam.<br />
Night after night under cover of the clouds and the rain, the<br />
Viet Cong are coming in blasting villages and cutting the<br />
throats of innocent citizens, and the forces opposed to them<br />
are counter-attacking them. If this isn't war what is it?<br />
But if it is a war, then who are we to say to the<br />
United States, the most formidable factor in the defence of<br />
South Vietnam, who are we to say to them: " You are not to<br />
attack the enemy's lines of communication, you are to allow him<br />
to have it all for free, and you must remain on a rather doubtful,<br />
difficult defensive". e<br />
Gentlemen, these problems which, as I say, we didn't<br />
discuss ontthoirmerits in the Prime Ministers' Conference, are<br />
the greatest problems you and I have had to think about, whether<br />
we've thought about them or not in the last four or five years.<br />
This is a tremendous issue.<br />
If the United States of America paid attention to the<br />
theoretical people and said; " Yes, you've persuaded us. W'e'll<br />
leave," and if we said: " All right, we'll leave too" and we<br />
leave South Vietnam to its own resources, what do you suppose<br />
will happen? I had a correspondence in Australia with some extraoprdinarily<br />
learned gentlemen who were bishops and they wrote letters<br />
to me about this matter and I wrote a couple back, and th&amp;~ y<br />
didn't seem to me to understand the truth of the issue at alL-.<br />
You can't solve this by sitting back and saying: " We all hope<br />
for peace," because that's what the communists are always saying.<br />
There hasn't been a peace rally in my own country for years that<br />
has not been organised by the communists, and when they establish<br />
a set of cut-throats in groups running into many thousands in<br />
South Vietnam and they are called the Viet Cong by us, it turns<br />
out that by the communists they are known as the National<br />
Liberation Front. But this is the technique.<br />
If we succumb to that and keep out and if we all keep<br />
out including the United States, South Vietnam will be in the<br />
hanas of North Vietnam before we are very much older. And if<br />
e o e e e e / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
it is, theni what the bishops were saying to me about free elections<br />
will prove to be the sorry nonsense that it was. You can't have<br />
a free election in North Vietnam. It's a communist state.<br />
Any of you ever hear of a free election in a communist state?<br />
OfP course not. How can you have a free election when you're<br />
being bemused and battered all the time by guerrillas, by rioters,<br />
by people who come in under cover of the rain and the cloud ' and<br />
murder your citizens. I've been through a few noisy election<br />
campaigns in Australia, but never through one conducted on that<br />
principle. We must get out of this habit of thinking that because<br />
you, and therefore we, are on one side of the Atlantic and the<br />
Americans are on the other, that there is some difference,<br />
Fundamentally there can't be any difference, Fundamentally, the<br />
future of the world for the next ten years will depend on how<br />
far we understand them and they understand us, how far we are on<br />
the same lines of communication, how far we share their information,<br />
how far we share their plans and their objectives, because<br />
unless we do, then we'll reach a state of affairs in which too<br />
many people here in Great Britain will think it is not their<br />
business the Americans are in that and some people in<br />
Australia not too many while I'm alive, will be saying that we<br />
should Jaave it to the Americans.<br />
You can't leave the peace of the world to the greatest<br />
power in the world unless you are prepared to abandon your own<br />
share of responsibility. We're all in this together, It is<br />
just because to me, venerable as I am, but still in a sense, as<br />
you might say, a modern Prime Minister, it's just because to me<br />
the greatest events in the last twenty years in world history have<br />
been the events associated with the outlook of the United States<br />
of America, with the willingness of their people to come in and do<br />
what they can, with the willingness of their Presidents one after<br />
the other to come in and give leadership and accept responsibility.<br />
This is a tremendous event in modern history. All I can say is<br />
that I hope without becoming blind people, without abandoning<br />
our rights to criticise our rights to suggest, that we will always<br />
do that. I do hope that we won't fall into the fatal error of<br />
thinking that all this tremendous emergence of American<br />
responsibility is merely some form of imperialism, I hope you<br />
will always remember that this has nothing to do with imperialism,<br />
This is counter-imperialism. I'm sick and tired of hearing these<br />
words about imperialism and neo-colonialism. They rattle round<br />
the room at any conference we have.<br />
The fact is that the new imperialism will be resisted<br />
and defeated and kept only if all of us on both sides of the<br />
Atlantic, and on my side of the Pacific realise that, in the<br />
words of William Pitt spoken a century and a half earlier about<br />
different circumstances: " We are one people", and itts because<br />
we are one people that what has been going on in South Vietnam<br />
on the merits has had support not only of the United States but<br />
of my own fair country. </p>
