<p>JONES:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is on the line. Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I just say to you that even broadcasters get depressed.</p>
<p> I feel very depressed today. I've argued and cajoled, and tried</p>
<p> to persuade you about a national disaster fund. Here we are yet again,</p>
<p> there are people in appalling plights, can there be anything more</p>
<p> important for your initiative or John Fahey's today than the</p>
<p> concern of these people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, there isn't but can I say a couple of things about that.</p>
<p> Firstly, any person who is insured is entitled to get full recovery</p>
<p> on their insurance policy. There can't be any argument that this</p>
<p> was a storm. In the past insurance companies have said well, this</p>
<p> is flood damage and it's not fully covered.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>PM, I am sorry to interrupt you but that isn't the point, that</p>
<p> is not the point. They know that. What is the point at the moment</p>
<p> is....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, I am sorry....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No, let me just tell you the problem...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But, Alan, please, I mean, you asked me a question and I....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>You are talking something that they all know, John, fair dinkum.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am sorry, could I just go on to say...I mean, I know you</p>
<p> say the answer is to have a national disaster fund....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But you won't even consider it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but we effectively have one at the moment.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Oh....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am sorry...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No, you're kidding me, John. I can't believe you go to Western</p>
<p> Australia and you say you don't need a national disaster fund</p>
<p> and when you go to Western Australia your existing structures are</p>
<p> so inadequate that you say, well, we've got to give them $10</p>
<p> million, we've got to give them....If the fund and the processes</p>
<p> were okay you wouldn't have to give them $10 million they would</p>
<p> be adequate to cope.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In every major disaster of this kind when there has been a demonstrated</p>
<p> need over and above, and I am quite certain that there are demonstrated</p>
<p> needs over and above what is covered by the existing arrangements,</p>
<p> they'll be discussed by me with the New South Wales Premier.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you understand, I am sorry, I mean, do you understand</p>
<p> that the SES have 5,500 calls that they cannot currently service of</p>
<p> people whose homes can not be lived in at this moment. And they are</p>
<p> asking the Prime Minister of this country to, for God's sake,</p>
<p> recognise this is a problem and can you get the army or someone in?</p>
<p> Can you get tarpaulins available, can you recruit tradesmen, can you</p>
<p> provide money from a fund which will actually get this work done so</p>
<p> that the rain isn't falling in homes which are already flooded?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, I understand very, very strongly and very, very deeply how you</p>
<p> feel and you are right to be concerned about the people of Sydney</p>
<p> as I am. It is easy to say that when you have something like this</p>
<p> that strains services to the maximum and, in fact, it's easy</p>
<p> and appropriate to say, well there should be more of them. And I can</p>
<p> assure you and I can assure your listeners that if there is a need</p>
<p> for more of those services over and above what are now available which</p>
<p> is demonstrated out of this well I will talk to the New South Wales</p>
<p> Premier about providing those. But I have to say in defence of what</p>
<p> you have just said, defence of myself and defence of the Federal Government</p>
<p> and indeed of State governments, that there are extensive arrangements</p>
<p> available already, they do come into operation. I think the State</p>
<p> Emergency Services have responded magnificently and in this disaster....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Subsidised by employers.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Subsidised by employers.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Well, part of the Australian spirit, Alan, is to help each other</p>
<p> when they're in need and that involves....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, that's what I am asking you to do now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are arrangements. The arrangements that operate now will</p>
<p> involve the expenditure, potentially, of millions of dollars of money....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>PM, if they worked why would you have to give $10 million in Western</p>
<p> Australia? If they were working....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hang on, Alan, what happened in Western Australia could well happen</p>
<p> in New South Wales...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>It's happened here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, please, let me....look, I know you feel strongly about</p>
<p> this....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I really feel quite depressed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know that but I think it's also fair that you let me finish.</p>
<p> In Western Australia, in Katherine, in a number of other places where</p>
<p> the ordinary standing arrangements for the provision of...the Commonwealth</p>
<p> supplements the cash grants given by State governments to people who</p>
<p> because of the disaster need money. Now, that is how the arrangement</p>
<p> works. The State provides a certain amount, once it goes beyond a</p>
<p> certain level the Commonwealth then comes in and subsidises the State.</p>
<p> So all of those people who are in an immediate cash need as a result</p>
<p> of this disaster can go along and ask for that. We also have ex-gratia</p>
<p> arrangements available and if the New South Wales Government believes</p>
<p> that the existing arrangements are not working they can talk to Mr</p>
<p> Fahey, they can talk to me and make sure that those are also available.</p>
<p> In addition to that, if there is a clear demonstration, as there was</p>
<p> in Exmouth, that as a result of the disaster businesses are being</p>
<p> destroyed quite separately from homes, and I'll come to homes</p>
<p> in a moment, then that fund was essentially made available for emergency</p>
<p> relief for the small businesses to get the town going again.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But you can understand that it's more...I am sorry, I mean,</p>
<p> I find it hard, I don't want to say that you don't understand</p>
<p> but look, there's a street in Kensington, the whole street is</p>
<p> done over. Now, these people firstly have got to do the most basic</p>
<p> thing and that is find someone who can take their call and answer</p>
<p> their problem. The windows are smashed, the house all blown in. 176,</p>
<p> all the windows smashed, ceiling and floor damage. 117, water leaking</p>
<p> down all the walls, it poured at half past one last night. We are</p>
<p> asking a system to be in place where these people aren't asked</p>
<p> to make phone calls where people arrive in their droves by a national</p>
<p> plan and fix these people up. They are pensioners, they are poor people,</p>
<p> they are people on shift work, they have got wages and salaries, they</p>
<p> can't afford to pay any kind of money to get someone there at</p>
<p> the moment because a workman is going to say, can you pay. They don't</p>
<p> have $250 spare. What do they do, will the Prime Minister tell me</p>
<p> what they do.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if they don't have cash available for their immediate needs</p>
<p> the existing arrangements involve them getting that and if the State</p>
<p> doesn't have enough money to support all of that...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>How do they make contact? How do they know who to ring?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Alan, nobody, let's face it, you have an emergency number.</p>
<p> I mean, be fair. The State emergency services all around this country</p>
<p> work extremely well and it doesn't automatically follow that</p>
<p> something run from Canberra is going to be more efficient than something</p>
<p> run from Sydney.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Where's the Army, someone said where's the Army, they've</p>
<p> got tarpaulins?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Army is always called in and is always available if asked.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>By whom?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That has to be asked by the State authorities because they have the</p>
<p> police. The New South Wales Government  and look, I'm not</p>
<p> sort of pointing the finger at them, they've done a very good</p>
<p> job  the New South Wales Government is responsible for the emergency</p>
<p> services and the police and they are the first points of contact.</p>
<p> And if they need help they would automatically go to the Army. They</p>
<p> don't have to ring me. They don't have to ring the Defence</p>
<p> Minister. They have standing arrangements. The Army was automatically</p>
<p> called in to Katherine. The defence forces were involved in Exmouth</p>
<p> in Western Australia. When I went to Exmouth in Western Australia</p>
<p> I came across ADF personnel. They didn't have to ask my permission</p>
<p> to go there. There's a standing arrangement. You talk as though</p>
<p> these things don't happen.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>They're not happening. John, this occurred on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, maybe you should be...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>You're the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm telling you what the arrangement is and if that hasn't</p>
<p> happened then that is something that ought to be...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>PM, this occurred on Wednesday night, it is now Friday and SES, who</p>
<p> are phenomenal, won't come anywhere near solving this by the</p>
<p> weekend. There are people who could be your mother or your brother</p>
<p> without a roof over their head and they don't even have a car</p>
<p> to get from A to B because they can't get the work done. They're</p>
<p> requiring an operation bigger than any of the component parts to be</p>
<p> able to address the problem immediately.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Alan, can I tell you, you are  it did happen on Wednesday</p>
<p> night. Under the standing arrangements that exist, if the response</p>
<p> of the Defence Force to a request from the SES or the New South Wales</p>
<p> Police had not been adequate I would have heard about it. Mr Carr</p>
<p> would have got in touch with me. You are the first person who has</p>
<p> suggested to me or implied to me that the SES has not had the co-operation</p>
<p> from the defence forces to which they are entitled. As a result of</p>
<p> this phone call I will now get in touch with Mr Carr. I'll get</p>
<p> in touch with the Defence Minister and I'll find out whether</p>
<p> any request was made and what happened to that request. But I will</p>
<p> be very surprised, given the past attitude of the Australian Defence</p>
<p> Forces, that if they had been asked to help that they wouldn't</p>
<p> have immediately gone in there and help. They don't need my...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, if they don't help in this disaster when will they help?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I'm saying to you is people don't go and  I mean,</p>
<p> there is an arrangement, if they were asked they would have gone.</p>
<p> You are implying that in some way they have to ask me.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No I'm not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They don't have to ask me. I mean, I could be anywhere. You have</p>
<p> a standing arrangement. They don't have to go through the Prime</p>
<p> Minister. They ring up the relevant contact person in the Defence</p>
<p> Force and say we need help. Now, that happened in Katherine and it</p>
<p> happened in Exmouth and I assume that in the case of the Sydney storm</p>
<p> it would have happened it they had have needed it. Now, Alan, as a</p>
<p> result of your call I will now, I'll get in touch with Mr Carr</p>
<p> and I'll get in touch with the Defence Minister and I'll</p>
<p> find out whether any request was made. But I want your listeners to</p>
<p> understand that in circumstances like this the Army and the Navy and</p>
<p> the Air Force, in an emergency situation, are always available to</p>
<p> help if they are asked and if they are called upon because the local</p>
<p> State services can't handle the problem. Now, that has always</p>
<p> been the case and I don't want anybody to think for a moment</p>
<p> that we just let the State emergency services think we leave them</p>
<p> alone. We don't. We are always ready to supplement and all they</p>
<p> have to do is ring up.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>That's right but there are people out there who don't have</p>
<p> insurance, and they should have and so on but they mightn't be</p>
<p> able to afford, but they are Australians and they are part of our</p>
<p> world. And today they are left without any means, most probably, to</p>
<p> be able to repair their house or repair their car. It's most</p>
<p> probably a little butter box of a thing which is 15 or 18 years old.</p>
<p> And I'm saying that surely to God there has to be a better mechanism</p>
<p> in place than all these fragmented responses. But you say, you say</p>
<p> it's terrific but I don't see evidence of it being terrific.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, I don't think when something like this happens anything</p>
<p> is terrific because you never expect something like this and it was</p>
<p> absolutely ferocious and the way in which it devastated parts of Sydney</p>
<p> must have been absolutely terrifying for the people concerned.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Will you have a chance to drive out and have a look at it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I will. I will try and do that today. Yes, I will. Unfortunately</p>
<p> I couldn't do it yesterday because I had a long-standing commitment</p>
<p> to go to Newcastle.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>PM, they're relying on you. I want you to understand that. The</p>
<p> desperate people that have rung me this morning  many calls</p>
<p> I couldn't put to air  are relying on you. That's</p>
<p> all I can say. I can't put it any higher than that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I want them to understand that I am concerned about their plight.</p>
<p> And if there are areas of additional help over and above the arrangements</p>
<p> that already exist then that help will be made available. And could</p>
<p> I stress again what I started to say at the beginning and that is</p>
<p> that the insurance arrangements, surely there could be no argument</p>
<p> from any insurance company who has a policy covering people against</p>
<p> storm damage that that person should be able to recover in full to</p>
<p> the extent of that policy. Because this is not a flood, it was a storm.</p>
<p> Anybody who argues that there's not a liability under a storm</p>
<p> damage provision in an insurance policy in relation to this is...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I don't think that's happening though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I just wanted to add my weight...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yeah, well it's not happening.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...and suggest that it was happening.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>As for other areas of unmet need, of course, as we have in other disasters,</p>
<p> we've been willing to look. I have to say at this stage I've</p>
<p> not had any request from Mr Carr. I mean, in Western Australia what</p>
<p> happened was that the Western Australian Premier rang me and said,</p>
<p> look, this and this and this is the problem, we're covering it</p>
<p> up to here but we need your help over here. Now, I haven't had</p>
<p> that call from Mr Carr. Obviously if Mr Carr believes that there is</p>
<p> a need over and above he'll talk to me. Now, I'm not being</p>
<p> critical of him because I think the New South Wales Government has</p>
<p> responded appropriately. I think the SES and the police have done</p>
<p> terrific. I'm not interested in any point scoring politically</p>
<p> on something like this. They're trying hard, I know that, and</p>
<p> the emergency services are always stretched. I mean, the nature of</p>
<p> an emergency is that when it happens everybody is stretched to the</p>
<p> limit. You can never have an emergency response or a national disaster</p>
<p> response that means you have people to spare even in the greatest</p>
<p> emergency. No nation can afford to have that and no citizenry would</p>
<p> want a country to have that kind of arrangement. They want an arrangement</p>
<p> which is flexible and strong when it's needed. Now, of course</p>
<p> out of every disaster you examine whether changes and improvements</p>
<p> can be made but no government can guarantee against the terrifying</p>
<p> and the devastating aftermath of an unexpected freak storm. You can</p>
<p> provide help but you can't guarantee that everything is going</p>
<p> to be fixed in 24 hours.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sorry, I'd like to be able to do that but I can't.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay, well I thank you for your time and for your consideration.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
