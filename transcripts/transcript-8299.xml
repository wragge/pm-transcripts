PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 23 MAY 1991<br />
I am very saddened to learn of the death of Manning Clark.<br />
A great Australian, Manning Clark's contribution to the<br />
knowledge and understanding by Australians of their own<br />
country and themselves will stand as a lasting monument to<br />
his intellect, scholarship and dedication.<br />
His " A History of Australia" will remain for many years as<br />
an invaluable reference point for all Australians who seek<br />
to learn about the forces, struggles and events which have<br />
shaped the Australia of the 1990s and beyond.<br />
I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife Dymphnat and his<br />
family. </p>
