FOR PRESS 28 AUGUST 1977<br />
REPORT TO THE NATION<br />
In 1975, the Labor Government established the Ranger Uranium<br />
Environmental Inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Fox.<br />
That Inquiry has since reported. The reports have become known<br />
as the Fox Reports.<br />
After the Inquiry had been established, the Labor Government also<br />
signed and tabled in the Parliament a Memorandum of Understanding<br />
with the companies involved with the Ranger Mine, committing the<br />
Government of the day to joint development with those companies.<br />
My Government has examined all these matters and the Fox Reports<br />
very fully and very carefully. It has come to its decisions about<br />
the mining and export of uranium with four major concerns in mind.<br />
First, the need to help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.<br />
Second, the need to supply uranium to a world that is short of<br />
energy. Third, the need for a guarantee that the interests of<br />
the aboriginal people are protected. And fourth, the need to make<br />
absolutely sure that uranium development does not harm the<br />
environment. Let me talk about these concerns for a while. First, the need<br />
to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.<br />
The Fox Report regarded this as the most important hazard<br />
associated with the nuclear power industry the nuclear power<br />
industry for peaceful purposes.<br />
My Government supports that view, and that is why last May I<br />
announced the most stringent set of safeguards yet adopted by<br />
any country.<br />
If we are exporting uranium, we will be able to argue with effect<br />
around the world, in the councils of the world, to make sure that<br />
supplier countries maintain strict safeguards. We will be able<br />
to act to make sure the international arrangements in relation to<br />
safeguards are adhered to that they are improved as time passes.<br />
We will be able to act forcefully in these matters, and advance<br />
the cause of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. / But<br />
P77/ 187 </p>
<p>-2<br />
But if we just leave Australia's uranium in the ground if we<br />
opt out of the world in relation to these matters Australia<br />
will not be able to act with any effect, with any force, in<br />
matters which are important to all of us and to our children.<br />
There are other matters associated with the proliferation of<br />
nuclear weapons, with the nuclear power industry the problem<br />
of waste which I know concerns you. It concerned the Fox Report,<br />
and it concerns my Government.<br />
Let me emphasise as forcefully as I can that here the scientific<br />
knowledge does exist. The technology does exist. The scientific<br />
knowledge and technology have been applied to the problem of waste.<br />
The technolocry is known. It has worked on a trial basis, and plans<br />
are now under way to adopt it on a much larger scale.<br />
We are not talking about some scientist's theory that has not been<br />
applied, that might have doubts about it. The scientific knowledre<br />
does exist. It is now going to be applied on a large scale.<br />
I know people are concerned about the future generations in<br />
Australia, about their children. We are concerned about that.<br />
I have four children. Many of my Ministers have children. We<br />
would not be taking any decisions that put at risk your childrens<br />
future, or our childrens future.<br />
There is one other matter reprocessing. Under the Australian<br />
safeguards policy,.-any-country that purchases Australian uranium<br />
would not be permitted to reprocess without the consent of the<br />
Australian Government. There is a very clear re-tson for this.<br />
One of the products of reprocessing is pl~ utonium. That can be<br />
used in a reactor for peaceful purposes, for energy purposes;<br />
but also, as many of you would know, it could also be used for<br />
military technology.<br />
Reprocessing, we believe, takes countries too close to military<br />
technology at this stage. That is why reprocessing would not be<br />
allowed under our safeguards policy without the prior consent of<br />
the Australian Government.<br />
Let me come now to the second of our major concerns -the need to<br />
supply uranium to a world that is short of energy.<br />
I think it is sometimes difficult for Australians to understand<br />
that many countries in Europe and in the developing world are<br />
very short of energy, short of natural resources.<br />
I think it is difficult for us to understand this because we<br />
have massive reserves of coal, significant reserves of natural<br />
gas, reserves of oil, uranium, and many other minerals. Australia<br />
is very well endowed with natural resources.<br />
There are many countries around the world, the developed world<br />
and developing, that have to rely entirely on the energies and<br />
capacities of their own people, and that do not have the samne<br />
resources as Australia. / That </p>
<p>-3-<br />
That does create international obligations of a country, such<br />
as Australia, to make sure that others do not go short of the<br />
materials that Australia can supply.<br />
Sir Macfarlane Burnett a few days ago said " I believe the<br />
majority of thoughtful people accept the inevitability for<br />
at least an interim period of large-scale use of nuclear<br />
energy in most parts of the world. Things being as they are,<br />
nuclear power generators will be needed for the next twenty<br />
or fifty years in most of the developed countries."<br />
We have the energy which is necessary for other countries to<br />
maintain jobs for their own people, to heat their homes in the<br />
winter, to maintain their standard of living. If we refuse to<br />
supply energy, that would be very serious indeed.<br />
These are matters that my Government has had to take into<br />
account in the uranium decisions. Therefore, subject to the<br />
safeguards policy, we believe that we have an international<br />
obligation to supply energy in an energ~ y-short world.<br />
The third concern is the need for a guarantee that interests of<br />
the aboriginal people are protected.<br />
Even though my Government believes that it is important for<br />
Australia's voice to be raised in international forums to<br />
prevent the-spread of-nuclear weapons, and even though we<br />
believe it important that Australia should supply energy in<br />
an energy-short world, we would not have made the decision to<br />
mine and export uranium were it not possible to protect fully<br />
the interests of the aboriginal people.<br />
We have accepted all the recommendations of the Fox Report in<br />
this matter.<br />
Aboriginal people will be able to earn and live on their<br />
traditional land. They will be consulted in the developments<br />
that take place. They will be able to influence those developments,<br />
and substantial sums from royalties will be devoted to<br />
the welfare of the aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.<br />
The fourth concern involves the need to make absolutely sure<br />
that uranium mining does not harm the environment.<br />
In the Alligator Rivers Region we have one of the most important,<br />
and, in many senses, one of the most fragile, environments<br />
anywhere,' in the world. It is important to Australia, and it<br />
is important, environmentally, to everyone.<br />
There will be a National Park, one of the largest and most<br />
significant in the world. There will be a plan of management<br />
that will arrange a very strict control. Until the whole Park<br />
is proclaimed, other areas will be under control under strict<br />
supervision. / There </p>
<p>-4-<br />
There will be a code for mining that will make sure that<br />
mining operations are again under very stringent control indeed.<br />
I emphasise the decision my Government has made concerning the<br />
mining and export of uranium has been taken with the highest<br />
sense of moral responsibility to all Australians and to the<br />
wider world community; a sense of responsibility to provide<br />
energy in an energy-short world; but in particular a sense of<br />
responsibility to make sure that Australia's voice can be used<br />
with effect to prevent nuclear proliferation. </p>
