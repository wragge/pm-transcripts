PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ALP DINNER<br />
SYDNEY 22 AUGUST 1989<br />
One week ago, Paul Keating brought down this Government's<br />
seventh budget.<br />
It was a budget designed to advance Labor's long-term vision<br />
of a more prosperous and fair Australia.<br />
There can hardly have been a Budget as well received across<br />
the community as this one has been.<br />
That's not surprising: with its massive $ 9 billion surplus<br />
a complete turnaround from the prospective $ 9 billion<br />
deficit we inherited when we came to office its increased<br />
assistance for pensioners and other needy groups, its<br />
comprehensive approach to savings through superannuation,<br />
its renewed focus on micro-economic reform through the<br />
creation of the Industry Commission, it's a budget that was<br />
bound to be well received by anyone who has Australia's best<br />
interests at heart.<br />
It's a Budget that demonstrates again that Labor has the<br />
strategy for long-term economic growth and sustainable<br />
prosperity. By contrast, the last seven days have been a nightmare for<br />
Andrew Peacock and the opposition.<br />
First, on Budget night, there was John Hewson's predictions<br />
that the Budget was a) an early election budget, b) would<br />
bring on a recession and c) would be greeted adversely by<br />
the markets.<br />
These self-serving predictions are not being, and will not<br />
be, borne out by events and they have been quietly dropped<br />
from the opposition's lexicon.<br />
Also taking a very low profile is Andrew Peacock's proposal<br />
about inflation adjustment of interest.<br />
This proposal earned one sentence in Andrew Peacock's Budget<br />
reply last Thursday. </p>
<p>Paul Keating and I have explained the technical reasons why<br />
such a proposal would be a disaster for Australia but Brian<br />
Loton of BHP said it all when he said that if you want to<br />
see indexation at work, go to Brazil.<br />
Another highlight of the Budget reply was Peacock's apparent<br />
heat-of-the-moment decision to drop two words from his<br />
prepared speech.<br />
Instead of repeating his carefully vague promise that the<br />
Opposition would " work to ensure that" the top tax rate for<br />
individuals is not higher than the company tax rate, what he<br />
actually said in Parliament it's recorded in Hansard was<br />
" 1we will ensure" that change is made.<br />
As Paul Keating pointed out, by dropping those two words,<br />
Andrew Peacock has wittingly or unwittingly made a fresh<br />
commitment costing some $ 1.7 billion dollars, aimed<br />
specifically at the most privileged members of the<br />
community. Then on Friday was the surprise departure from Peacock's<br />
office of his senior staffer who had engineered the mock<br />
election campaign a departure which followed reports of<br />
tensions between Peacock's office and Hewson's and which has<br />
not, I understand, left John Howard entirely heartbroken.<br />
Finally over the weekend, we saw Ian Sinclair himself like<br />
Banquo's Ghost, shaking his gory locks in the general<br />
direction of young Charles Blunt, who at least for the time<br />
being has taken his place as Leader of the National Party.<br />
Sinclair is rarely right, but he was spot on when he said<br />
that the Opposition is not ready or fit to govern.<br />
It was, truly, a miserable week for the opposition, and one<br />
that eloquently put paid to Andrew's ambitions to be thought<br />
of not as Leader of the-Opposition but as leader of the<br />
alternative government.<br />
God help us if that mob formed the Government of Australial<br />
I don't want to spend too long raking over the coals of the<br />
Peacock Budget reply. There's not much there to look at.<br />
But I do want to draw attention to one aspect of his speech<br />
that has come under renewed focus since he delivered it:<br />
his industrial relations policy.<br />
Like all Liberal policy, it is long on rhetoric and short on<br />
detail. But he has said enough to give us the general idea:<br />
the general idea being that he wants to turn the clock back<br />
and give Australia a repeat dose of what it got in 1982.<br />
It is a massive irony that Liberals should be talking about,<br />
as they put it, " updating" the industrial relations system. </p>
<p>It is an irony because under the Accord that has existed<br />
between the Federal Labor Government and the trade union<br />
movement since 1983 Australia has enjoyed an era of<br />
industrial relations progress and harmony that is<br />
unparalleled in our experience.<br />
Let me list the achievements:<br />
1.5 million new jobs;<br />
a rate of employment growth more than twice as<br />
fast as the rest of the world and five times<br />
as fast as the last Liberal Government;<br />
this has been built on real wage restraint<br />
exercised by the Australian workforce. But<br />
our rapid employment growth and targeted<br />
social security increases has actually meant<br />
Australia's real disposable per capita income<br />
has increased by some 8 per cent.<br />
increased international competitiveness for the<br />
Australian economy<br />
a 59 per cent reduction in industrial disputes<br />
a new era of workplace reforms, encompassing the<br />
truly historic changes represented by the process<br />
of award restructuring which will deliver real and<br />
lasting productivity improvements for the benefit<br />
of all Australians<br />
a stable framework within which strategies for the<br />
improvement of living standards can be dealt with<br />
in totality instead of the law of the jungle where the<br />
stronger uhions get big wage increases and the<br />
weaker get left behind, centralised wage<br />
fixing produces fairer overall wages outcomes;<br />
especially when, as happened this year, wage<br />
restraint is achieved as a trade-off with<br />
substantial tax cuts and social justice<br />
improvements under the Accord processes, paying wage<br />
increases in the form of superannuation, or<br />
linking wage increases with improvements in<br />
productivity, yields real benefit to<br />
individuals and to the economy.<br />
The effect of all this is that where, in the past, the<br />
overheating of the Australian economy led to wage break-outs<br />
that broke the back of the economy and hurt everyone, this<br />
time we are containing wage increases so that the increased<br />
economic activity produces new investment, not<br />
self-defeating inflationary wage rises. </p>
<p>How appropriate it is for a Labor Party so proud of its<br />
historic links with the trade union movement, that the<br />
Accord has been at the heart of all the achievements of this<br />
Labor Government.<br />
And how predictable it is that the opposition should be<br />
seeking to undo this central achievement.<br />
Listening to Andrew Peacock the other night was like going<br />
into a time warp.<br />
It proved the Liberals have learned nothing from their time<br />
in opposition.<br />
I said in Perth recently that, more deeply than anything<br />
else, the Liberals resent the fact that this Government has<br />
built a stable, constructive relationship with the trade<br />
union movement through the Accord.<br />
They resent it they abhor it because it represents an<br />
achievement that is utterly beyond their grasp, and a view<br />
of society that is utterly outside the scope of their<br />
blinkered reliance on confrontation and division.<br />
In an era when centralised wage fixation has been absolutely<br />
critical to the overall improvement in the Australian<br />
economy, they want to get rid of the Accord, and get rid of<br />
the principle that sectoral claims should be assessed in the<br />
broader context of what's good for the nation.<br />
Andrew Peacock talks in code words: " flexibility", " special<br />
circumstances", " the minimum of outside interference"<br />
If you decode his industrial relations policy, what you get<br />
is a simple message about wage increases. The message is:<br />
let them rip!<br />
If you want an example 6f what that policy means in practice<br />
you have to look no further than the mayhem being caused by<br />
the pilots with their completely irresponsible claims for a<br />
per cent increase.<br />
The pilots have graphically demonstrated what Andrew Peacock<br />
means by free bargaining between employee and employer.<br />
It has worked well enough for them in the past.<br />
But things are different now.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have spoken firstly about these important economic<br />
matters. Now I want to go onto another issue that has<br />
rightly been placed high on the national and global agenda.<br />
I refer, of course, to the environment. </p>
<p>For some time now a debate has been going on about the<br />
ranking that should be given to the economy vis-a-vis the<br />
environment in the setting of government priorities. I<br />
note, for instance, that Andrew Peacock has pledged economy<br />
before ecology.<br />
I have always considered this to be spurious debate. The<br />
reality is that we can only have economically sustainable<br />
development if that development is environmentally<br />
sustainable.<br />
My Environment Statement, launched last month, formally<br />
embraced the concept of ecologically sustainable development<br />
though in Government we have consistently practised it,<br />
with our spectacular record of job creation coupled with our<br />
decisions on the Franklin Dam, Kakadu, the Daintree, the<br />
Lemonthyme and Southern Forests and the Wesley Vale pulp<br />
mill, to name just a few.<br />
I need not repeat here the many new undertakings given by my<br />
Government in the Environment Statement. They are well<br />
known and have been well received for what they are an<br />
integrated set of commitments which provide further impetus<br />
to the Government's program for protecting and repairing the<br />
environment. I intend to issue a progress report on the Environment<br />
Statement in a few months from now, by which time I expect<br />
most of the new programs announced in the Statement to be<br />
well and truly up and running or at least the preparatory<br />
work to be completed.<br />
But in the short time since the launch of the Environment<br />
Statement there have been some significant new developments<br />
that I want to report to you.<br />
The first is the contemptuous statement of the NSW Natural<br />
Resources Minister, Mr eausley, on 27 July that when the<br />
present studies into the South East Forest National Estate<br />
area are completed " it will re-grow." Asked whether this<br />
meant those forests would be logged, Mr Causley replied<br />
" Yes".<br />
This is nothing less than a blatant breach of faith by the<br />
Government in the process that had been painstakingly<br />
negotiated by my minister for Resources, Peter Cook. By<br />
indicating that the South East National Estate Forests will<br />
be logged regardless of the findings of the agreed<br />
biological studies and the studies into prudent and feasible<br />
alternatives, the NSW Liberal/ National Party Government is<br />
demonstrating yet again its disdain for environmental<br />
concerns in this State.<br />
And I can tell you, we won't cop it.<br />
I </p>
<p>If the State Government doesn't co-operate fully in the<br />
biological studies and in a full examination of alternatives<br />
to logging the South East National Estate Forests, my<br />
Government will bring down the full weight of its<br />
constitutional powers including the corporations power<br />
to achieve a solution.<br />
And we will not allow the legitimate interests of workers in<br />
the region to be jeopardised by a confrontationist State<br />
Government a Government which seems more intent on using<br />
workers as pawns in a political power play than in looking<br />
after their long-term interests. My Government is committe~ d<br />
to providing a sustainable future for those workers and<br />
their families, one based on environmentally sound and<br />
efficient forest management.<br />
That same urge to develop at any cost is evident in the<br />
Liberal/ National Party drive to put a high-rise development<br />
on just about every bit of coastline in this State. The<br />
newly-established Resource Assessment Commission will be<br />
inquiring into coastal development in this country. With<br />
the benefit of its reports, the Federal Labor Government<br />
will be trying to put some sanity back into decision-making<br />
processes on the use of Australia's coastline. I have<br />
already indicated publicly that my Government would use its<br />
powers, including the corporations power, to influence<br />
coastal development in this country and I reaffirm that<br />
commitment tonight.<br />
The behaviour of the Liberal/ National Party Government in<br />
this State raises the whole issue of constitutional powers.<br />
Andrew Peacock has indicated time and again that a Federal<br />
Coalition Government would not override the States. The<br />
best a Federal Liberal/ National Party Government could do on<br />
the environment therefore is the worst any State could do<br />
and given the performance of this State Government, that's<br />
pretty awful.<br />
My Government will not abrogate its environmental<br />
responsibilities to the Greiners, to the Aherns we have<br />
overridden the States before and we will do it again as<br />
necessary. The Federal Opposition won't support us on a referendum for<br />
increased Commonwealth powers on the environment. They<br />
won't override the States. Their latest environment policy<br />
millennium Milestones II ( sounds like the remake of a bad<br />
movie) says that they'd deal with the pressing<br />
environmental problems confronting this country by holding a<br />
national doorknock to raise funds. That's the extent of<br />
their commitment to the environment a national doorknockl </p>
<p>only Labor Governments Federal and State have the<br />
interest, the competence and the will required to protect<br />
the environment. In Canberra we demonstrate our commitment<br />
virtually on a daily basis. Just last Friday I concluded a<br />
very important agreement with French Prime Minister Rocard<br />
for Australia and France to promote amongst other Antarctic<br />
Treaty countries the establishment of Antarctica as a<br />
wilderness reserve, free from mining. We will not relent in<br />
our determination to protect Antarctica, the world's last<br />
great wilderness.<br />
A further matter which my Government has viewed with grave<br />
concern is the slaughter of the African elephant by poachers<br />
involved in illegal ivory trade. In my Environment<br />
Statement I announced that the Australian Government would<br />
be seeking an international prohibition on trade in ivory,<br />
except antique ivory, at the next meeting of the<br />
international convention on trade in endangered species, in<br />
October. Three weeks ago I wrote to President Moi of<br />
Kenya to convey my Government's appreciation of his action<br />
in destroying a very valuable collection of illegally<br />
obtained ivory tusks.<br />
And tonight I announce in support of those countries, such<br />
as Kenya, which are trying to protect the African elephant,<br />
that my Government is ( with the exception of antique<br />
products) banning the importation of ivory into Australia.<br />
In Bob Carr, Graham Richardson and myself you have people<br />
dedicated to the protection of the environment. The<br />
Australian Labor Party expects nothing less. The Liberal<br />
and National Parties expect nothing at all and get it. The<br />
contrast with Labor could not be starker; the environmental<br />
consequences of a Federal Liberal/ National Party Government<br />
could not be more devastating.<br />
Labor's economic and environmental policies will see us<br />
returned at the next Federal election and we look forward to<br />
working with our State Labor colleagues here in New South<br />
Wales upon their return to government to boost the NSW<br />
economy and restore and protect the natural heritage of this<br />
great State.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I said at the outset of my comments tonight that we have now<br />
brought down seven budgets.<br />
In 1982, the then Treasurer John Howard brought down the<br />
Liberals, seventh Budget.<br />
It was their last.<br />
But our seventh Budget won't be our last.<br />
It was their last because it was a Budget that looked only<br />
to the next election, and that failed to grasp the long-term<br />
issues facing the economy. </p>
<p>S. V<br />
8.<br />
Ours won't be our last because we are looking beyond the<br />
election, and settting in place the elements of our<br />
continuing strategy for our next term of office and, if<br />
you like, beyond.<br />
I want to reaffirm tonight as I have throughout the past<br />
week our utmost commitment to continue, with energy and<br />
determination, the great task of reform on which we have<br />
embarked. That is a task whose successful completion will, I believe,<br />
be Labor's best guarantee of continued electoral success<br />
into the 1990s and Australia's best guarantee of greater<br />
prosperity and fairness. </p>
