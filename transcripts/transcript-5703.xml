PRIME MINISTER<br />
POE MDIA TUJBSDAY, DBC* EMBF. R 1 1981<br />
This is an important occasion for our nation becatise the<br />
purchas8e of--+/-iA-14-Hornets is the largest peacetime<br />
defence project in Australia's history.<br />
it is a project which will involve close co-operation among<br />
several partner-%* and I welcome not only the representatives<br />
of the U. S. Governmvent, the McDonnell Douglas Aircraft<br />
Corporation and General FSlectric but also the representatives<br />
of a number ot-A-u-sralian firms and trade unions because<br />
PAustralian industry will be vitally involved with the whole<br />
0 project. The Hornets will constitute Australia's new tactical<br />
~ fighter force, and their purchase comes at a time when all<br />
of us are concerned about trends in world events, and about<br />
how to respond to them.<br />
thiS~ context I welcome the opportunity to say something<br />
about Australia's relationship with the United States.<br />
Auetiralia and the United States have long been involved in<br />
0-operation across a wide range of common concerns. Ile are<br />
*&amp; Ni~ ar ). inds of society.-so it is not surprising that we<br />
7oftenind_. Qrzt1ixzon the same side, making sitnilar-_<br />
judgements and reaching similar conclusions. In the-field<br />
ofdefence inl particular we have man concerns in conmmon,<br />
and there are many strands within our relationship.<br />
Let mre say at the outset that Australia is pleased Indeed that<br />
Presiaent Reagan has embar) ked on the process of rebuilding<br />
M; S ezI. bb. se-a strong United States is vital to the<br />
security of the f ree world. Wems ee e his fact be<br />
obscured because it can be obscured b~ y people who too easily<br />
~ v allow the enemies of democracy to Tnasguerade as it5 defenders.<br />
I must say that I take no pleasure or comf~ ort from the<br />
critiim hc are sometimes levelled at United States<br />
c -hss<br />
policy in this area, for peace' can best be purstied from a<br />
position of streingth, 2neditcnbseo eipesuorls ued<br />
from a position of strength. Any failure to recognise this<br />

.4 r. * The Boviet -Union exploited detente and the S. A. L. T. process<br />
on W7ich -ft was based to increase both the numbers and<br />
capabilities of its own military forces both nuclear andconventional.<br />
The growth of Soviet military power over recent<br />
years gives cause for great concern, and cannot but reflect<br />
longer term Intentions. The Soviets have taken<br />
advantage of western restraint and have developed a capability<br />
ofpraj ctiq-their military power not only In Europe but<br />
in other regions as well.<br />
Against the background of these moves by the Soviet Union,<br />
-the pursuit of peace and stability required a fresh approach<br />
and the policies developed by the Reagan administration leave<br />
no room for doubt, either that there is a fresh approach, or<br />
about-the alt-556f th~ t_ approach.<br />
Two weeks ago President Reagan made a major statement in<br />
which he issued an invitation to all. nations to join in-the<br />
quest for peace, security and freedom. This' statement is a<br />
clear and unequivocal response to the growing instability and<br />
insecurity whichi hs.. marked-he early years of thip decade.<br />
President Reagan's programme is as bold as it is comprehensive!<br />
b-" ause, he has not started f rom any misconception about the<br />
-r lative strengths of the East and the West, This riewJ<br />
programme is high statesmanship, and Australfa welcomes it,<br />
-but the international environment certainly gives no basis<br />
f orocomplacency. There is a wide range -of contingencies<br />
in which Australia could find itself in the. years qhead<br />
and because of this, we need a defence policy and &amp;,,, defene<br />
capability which is both comprehensive and effective.<br />
On* ilnplicatioi of this is that Australia's deferce policy<br />
must be onte of sel * f-reliance. F'or. a country with a = rall.<br />
pulation,. a large land mass, an even larger teritrialsa#~<br />
extended lines of international communication arid a<br />
developed industrial base self-reliance means a defence<br />
capability based . on high technology rather than simple numbers.<br />
The implicati~ ons of this are far reaching, especially in the<br />
Context of our capabilities in the air.<br />
In making the decision about the tacotical figjhte-r-Forzce7__ tii<br />
Govern z had to consider which aircraft would best zueet<br />
our strategic requirements witth maximum flexibility, adaptabi: lity<br />
and aVailability. At the same time, the Government had to<br />
consider which aircraft could carry the YR. AX through to the<br />
next century, while having at the sane time the capacoity to<br />
be adapted-to tech-nological change. .9<br />

There is no doubt that the Hornet is an outstanding aircraft,<br />
it combines a multi-role performance with formidable capabilities.<br />
It is a reliable and safe aircraft, we can expect it to have<br />
a long life, and it has been designed from the outset for<br />
ease of maintenance. It is well suited to our operating,<br />
deployment and maintenance requirements, and it also has the<br />
flexibility to accept improved weapons in future years.<br />
The Hornet uses technology and manufacturing processes new to<br />
Australia and the project will be introducing some of these<br />
processes into Australian industry. This Government has a<br />
longstanding policy that Australian industry should have the<br />
capacity to provide support for our defence force, This is<br />
obviously part of self reliance. We have therefore developed<br />
an industry programme in connection with the Hornet project,<br />
which will involve introducing new skills in many areas,<br />
and which will give Australia capacities which will be<br />
crucial to the continuing support of the aircraft.<br />
The success of this programme will make considerable demands<br />
on Australian industry, on both management and the workforce.<br />
I am confident, however, as others are, that the required<br />
levels and standards of production will be achieved,<br />
because this project means a great deal to the future of<br />
Australia. There is no doubt that in developing the Hornet, McDonnell<br />
Douglas and General Electric have produced an aeroplane which<br />
will provide a boost to Australia's defence capability in<br />
general and a powerful addition to the RAAF, and we look<br />
ahead to the delivery of the Hornets to the RAAF through the<br />
1980s. o0o---</p>
