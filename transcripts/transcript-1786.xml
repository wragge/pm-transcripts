BACKGROUND BRIEFING GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON,<br />
FOR HEADS OF BUREAUX IN THE PRESS<br />
GALLERY, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA 26 FEBRUARY 1968<br />
PRIME MINISTER : I think you have all had the list, gentlemen, under embargo.<br />
All I propose to do now in relation to this is to give non -attributable<br />
background so that you can write intelligently about this or anything<br />
you want to say about it. So I will answer any queries you have arising<br />
from it, and if I think there are some points which might be covered<br />
that you haven't asked, I'll mention those. But this is for backgroun d.<br />
It is not attributable.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I notice Mr Philip Lynch's name appears in<br />
the list. He is one of the newest of newcomers to the House. I was<br />
just wondering what special abilities he had that came to your eye?<br />
PM: Well, he is a comparatively young man, but not too young,<br />
and I think he has had a long association with business and staffing<br />
problems. and is a Member of the Association of Directors, or whatever<br />
it is, and a fairly long commercial experience of manpower management<br />
and work in business of various kinds. Also I have heard him make what<br />
seemed to me to be one or two good workmanlike speeches, and I<br />
thought I would like to give him a trial.<br />
Q. Could you tell us, Sir, what has happened to your ideas of<br />
amalgamating certain Departments and streamliring varbus Administrative<br />
functions?<br />
PM: Yes I can. We have been examining very carefully you<br />
are thinking of Social Services -Welfare proposition? we have been<br />
examining very carefully what is involved in what we were initially<br />
thinking of doing, and that is get the benefits side of Health moved across<br />
to Social Services. But there are very great difficulties indeed, there is<br />
no question of that, in moving the benefits of Health across to Social<br />
Services, and it looks almost certain that it would lead to a considerable<br />
duplication of public servants. For one thing, you can mesh in things<br />
like computers throwing up facts of doctors who prescribe a lot more<br />
than they should or make a lot more visits than you can ask them questions,<br />
but there has always been a requirement that judgments on these should<br />
be made by people who are qualified medical people in the Health Department.<br />
All right, you could move all those across, but at some policy-making<br />
levels further up, it looked as if you would have to duplicate them quite<br />
a bit. Then there are problems of what happens to something before it<br />
becomes a benefit. A pharmaceutical benefit is something which costs<br />
an awful lot of money by the time it becomes a benefit but an awful lot<br />
of stuff has gone beforehand before it is declared to be something which<br />
is a benefit. So there were some pretty considerable initial difficulties </p>
<p>PM ( Contd.) there which may possibly, on some more detailed examination be able to<br />
be overcome but which are there now. So I have left Health as it is and I<br />
wanted somebody to really dig in to the Social Services side and come LP<br />
with some ideas on the application of Social Services to try and get away<br />
I don't know if one can from 75 cents or a dollar all round sort of thing.<br />
I will be telling both those Ministers that they will have to work togethersubmissions<br />
from one will need to be examined by the other to see if<br />
there were things they wished to say about it before it came to Cabinet.<br />
What one has in mind is a kind of Commi&amp; W,, Cabinet Ministers<br />
concerned with Social Services who would7 or much more closely than<br />
they do at present so that we can get some kind of integration in this<br />
where it is at all possible.<br />
There is an alternative which no doubt might have occurred to<br />
some of you and that would have been to have the one Minister in charge<br />
of both Health and Social Services, but again, at this stage, the work load<br />
on one Minister in charge of those two Departments, both of which involve<br />
pretty detailed administratioq affd seermto me at this stage to be a bit too<br />
heavy for one man.<br />
Q. You say " at this stage", Sir, does this mean it will be re-examined?<br />
PM: I don't want to give the impression that this will be re-examined<br />
and therefore people are expecting something to happen from it. But clearly<br />
there is a need to get the Social Service things which touch a number of<br />
Departments more closely together. We examined a Ministry of Welfare.<br />
You know, all the others leading up to it. But at this time, again, that<br />
looks like a new Ministry, and more public servants. I would like to have<br />
a year or so just to see exactly how that sort of thing could be done. The<br />
end result what we are aiming for is there but there all sort of problems....<br />
Q. . I notice Mr Barnes is now Minister for External Territories.<br />
Can you explain that in relation to Interior and Northern Territory?<br />
PM: Yes. This is all non -attributable and for background.<br />
I feel that the problems at present in Papua and New Guinea in particular<br />
and in the Northern Territory are problems which are different in kind.<br />
I feel that the end goal, the final conclusion for Papua and New Guinea<br />
is likely to be different from the final conclusion for the Northern<br />
Territory. The N orthern Territory, without question, must be heading<br />
sometime in the future I don't know when towards statehood. There is<br />
no question that it is an integral part of Australia and must be an integral<br />
part of Australia just as much as Queensland is or Western Australia is.<br />
This is by no means necessary in the case of Papua and New Guinea.<br />
It seems likely to me that the development there and I put no time limit<br />
on it would be more towards a kind of self-government, and then at some<br />
time. in the future if that self -governing country wished to enter into some<br />
kind of arrangement with the Australian Government on the basis of self<br />
governent, not on the basis of being told by Australia that it is the sort<br />
of thing it should enter into, then that would take place between the<br />
Governments existing at that time. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Q. This is just a hurrying up of that emphasis, Sir getting<br />
towards selfl-government?<br />
PM: No, it's not, but it is an indication that the two will probably.<br />
be going on different courses.<br />
Q So that the Northern Territory now goes to Interior?<br />
PM: Yes, and we will be continuing to carry out Public Service Board<br />
investigations and discussions with the Administrator up there for some<br />
aspects which in the past in the Northern Territory have been the<br />
responsibility of the Department of Territories but-which might not<br />
necessarily be transferred to the Department of the Interior.<br />
Q. You are thinking of Northern Dev elopment?<br />
PM: Yes, that kInd of thing but national kind of development as<br />
distinct from state kind of development.<br />
Q. Will this mean more public servants, Sir?<br />
PM: I don't think so.<br />
Q. Aboriginal Affairs. Has that become a separate Department?<br />
PM: No. It is going to remain you know there is an Office of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs at the moment. That office will remain with the<br />
Prime Minister's Department:. There won't be set up a Permanent Head<br />
and that sort of thing. But Mr Wentworth will be Minister in Charge<br />
of Aboriginal Welfare and Development in the same way as I was<br />
Minister in Charge of Education and Science when that remained with the<br />
Prime Minister's Department.<br />
Q. Does this mean, Mr Prime Minister, that Mr Wentworth will<br />
work very closely under your eye I mean with Aboriginal Affairs?<br />
PM: Yes, but I would expect to leave most of it to him, except some<br />
really significant policy.<br />
It hesc ubelt ed hat oin a<br />
Ihta s beVe~ aed raxx~ moia sd= big change. in the Head of your<br />
Department, Sir, is that correct?<br />
PM: No. It is not. We are ex amining the work load in the Prime<br />
Minister's Department, whether there should at some stage be a Cabinet<br />
Secretariat as well as the Department, which again, would mean more<br />
public servants, but there is no hurry about that.<br />
Q. Sir, are there going to be any changes in the PM's Department<br />
you mentioned Aboriginal Affairs but is there anything like cultural<br />
affairs or anything like this going into another Department?<br />
PM: I expect they will. You can get a list of those probably from<br />
somebody outside. But there is a thing called the International Radiation<br />
Advisory Committee or something of the kind and that will go to Education and<br />
Science. Therest the Commonwealth Liaison Office which is still there on the<br />
1/ 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
PM ( Contd) paper. It is to do with Australia's liaison with countries of the British<br />
Commonwealth in education. That is already being done by Education.<br />
It will be just wiped-off the paper. Aboriginal Affairs will remain but<br />
will have a Minister in Charge of it. The smaller things I want to get<br />
other people looking after.<br />
Q. What about responsibility for High Commissioner posts<br />
abroad? It is that going to remain technically vested in your Department<br />
or be moved to External Affairs?<br />
PM: Well, I think Australia House is the only one in our Department.<br />
j The other High Commissioner posts abroad they come under External<br />
Affairs now.<br />
Q. I thought they were technicafly under your Department?<br />
PM: Wall, you have thrown me a bit, but I would be surprised. I<br />
think it is only the UK that is still under PM's, and it will stay there.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, who is going to be the Deputy Leader of the<br />
Government in the Senate?<br />
PM: Well, we went on for a long time there without a Deputy<br />
Leader.,<br />
Q. When Senator Anderson is absent, who would be the replacement?<br />
PM: I imagine the next most senior, probably, but this is different<br />
from at this stage designating a Deputy Leader.<br />
Q. You are deliberately not designating one?<br />
PM : No. Not at the moment.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, do you expect this Ministry to last for a<br />
very long period or are you envisaging further changes in the next twelve<br />
months or two years?<br />
PM: -I think it likely that it would continue, up until the next election<br />
anyway. Education in the ACT is to become the responsibility of the<br />
Department of Education, and elements of education in the Northern<br />
Territory are to become the responsili lity of the Education Department.<br />
The Northern Territory is pretty mixed up you know there are mission<br />
schools, aboriginal schools and schools which are part-aboriginal and<br />
part-white and they are run in different ways, but elements of that.<br />
Q. You would take it right out of Interior?<br />
PM: We would take them both out.<br />
Q. It is all the ones that Interior are doing not the ANU?<br />
PM: No. It is the Education ones that Interior is now doing in the<br />
ACT. </p>
<p>Q. This wouldn't involve any alterations in the present arrangements<br />
with New South Wales?<br />
PM: No. It doesn't involve any alteration at all. At the present<br />
moment people are supplied by the Department of New South Wales through<br />
the Department of the Interbr and this could happen through the nex<br />
Department. I think if one wanted to have pilot experiments and that kind<br />
of thing run, it would enable that to happen more easily. And of course the<br />
Department of Education deals with all the other State Governments put<br />
it that way and it seems reasonable that it might deal with it here.<br />
We would probably need to talk to the Council here you know, the local<br />
Council. They might want to have an Education Department officer with<br />
them because at the moment they have an Interior Department man with<br />
them to answer all their questions and give them information, and we<br />
wouldn't want to cut them out in any way from that.<br />
Q. Are you planning a Cabinet, Sir, between now and the meeting<br />
of the House?<br />
PM: Yes. We will have the ordinary Ministry meeting after the<br />
swearing-in, but we will be going on to Cabinet on Wednesday afternoon<br />
and Thursday.<br />
Q. Prime Mlinister, could you tell us what prompted you to promote<br />
Senator Wright to the Ministry? After his record of debating against the<br />
Government?<br />
PM: Well, I wanted to get some significant debating strength on the<br />
front benches of the Senate. I wanted to get legal capacity to present<br />
a legal case and to tear a legal case to pieces on the front benches of the<br />
Senate. We haven't got forceful people there but looking around for<br />
reinforcing a forceful sort of a person, he seemed to fit the bill. And<br />
I think that is the answer. You want somebody there who can fi ght and<br />
who knows t-he law and can cope with legal arguments, and so many of the<br />
discussions in the Senate do turn around legal interpretations and whether<br />
something is against the law of 1863 or something you know, that kind of<br />
thing.<br />
Q. The fact that you have to look around and find somebody 63 years<br />
old to promote to the front bench for the first time in his career seems<br />
to underline the dearth of talent in the Senate, especially on this legalistic<br />
side.<br />
PMVL Well, I don't know of any other lawyers in the Senate on our side.<br />
I can't think of one offhand at the moment. In the next Senate there will be.<br />
Two new ones.<br />
Q. Laught was one.<br />
PM. Keith Laught. Yes, that's right.<br />
Q. Do you think he will rock the boat any more now Senator Wright?<br />
PM: No. </p>
<p>j 6.<br />
Q. Will this be a part of your ruling off the ledger, Sir?<br />
PM: Oh, I hadn ' t thought of it in that way. I think if any of you<br />
had been sitting around and thinking of how you could increase the<br />
debating strength of the front bench you would have come to the same<br />
conclusion, a lot of you.<br />
Q. How do you feel about leaving South Australia and Tasmania<br />
out of the Cabinet? This doesn't concern you?<br />
PM: South Australia hasn't been in the Cabinet for a long, long,<br />
time.<br />
Q. No, but Tasmania was.<br />
PM: Tasmania isn't in the Cabinet, but it is in the Ministry now.<br />
I ' m not leaving South Australia out... . It. hasn't been in.<br />
Q. You don't really feel, apparently, that the Cabinet should reflect<br />
a Federal body, all States should be rep . resented?<br />
PM: I think if that is possible to attain, within the framework of the<br />
other requirements, that would be something to aim for, but I don't think<br />
it is an overriding necessity that this should happen. In the past if<br />
something t hat concerns South Australia has been the subject of<br />
discussion, then Jim Forbes has always said, " I would like to come along<br />
and speak on this, "' and without question, he always has. And, similarly,<br />
that would apply in the case of Tasmania. They get the submissions, they<br />
know what is being talked about.<br />
Q. Will Senator McKellar be in this Health group who have to<br />
exchange submissions for Cabinet?<br />
PM: Yes, I would want him to be, yes.<br />
Q. When will the swearing-in of the new Ministry be, Sir?<br />
PM: Wednesday.<br />
Q. At what time?<br />
PM: Midday.<br />
Q. Sir, to come back to the Northern Territory. I take it that<br />
Interior wouldn't handle the general development I am not talking about<br />
civic development, but the general development. Is this more likely<br />
to be handled by Mr Fairbairn's Department? Is that what you had in<br />
mind?<br />
PM: Yes. This is the objective that one has in mind. There are<br />
different kinds of development and it is not going to be easy to draw a<br />
precise line, but clearly there are some schemes where development<br />
I </p>
<p>PM ( Contd.) taking place say in Queensland would affect development taking place in the<br />
Northern Territory. Now at the present moment in that kind of development,<br />
the Minister for National Development has got to make arrangements with<br />
the Government of Queensland and then make arrangements with the<br />
Department of Territories. That kind of thing. Now this would be an endeavour<br />
to see that the Commonwealth Department who had this overall dey elopment<br />
responsibility would just. have to make arrangements with the one, alority.<br />
Q. Shipping and Transport have gone up into Cabinet, Sir. Does this<br />
presage any development of their activities, Sir in the international sphere?<br />
PM: No, but I felt this that the present Minister for Social Services is<br />
extraordinarily competent. He also had a great deal of work to do as the<br />
Minister assisting the Minister dssisting the Minister for Trade and<br />
Industry which took up a lot of his time, and he went abroad and so on, and<br />
I felt this Department was so significant, it really ought to have a full-time<br />
Minister, a Minister looking after it, and so Mr Sinclair ceased to be the<br />
Minister for Social Services and we had a full-time Minister instead.<br />
Q. ' Mr Prime Minister, you have dropped Mr Howson and Mr Chipp.<br />
Rightly or wrongly, people are going to get the impression Mr Howson<br />
has been dropped for his role in the VIP affair. Could you tell us what<br />
motivated in dropping these two?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think that I could or should embark on saying anything<br />
about people who are not in individuals who are not in or individuals who<br />
are in. I think that would be a bad thing for me to do. I selected the people<br />
I thought could do the job.<br />
Q. You said, Sir, that you thought this could stay there until the<br />
next election? Is this quite irrevocab le you will not want to change?<br />
PM: Oh, no. No, no. It is not irrevocable at all, but I think the<br />
implication of the question was I going to turn this over in a few months'<br />
time sort of thing. It is not that.<br />
Q. You mean there won't be a ruthless change, a great blitz before<br />
the election.?<br />
PM: No. I don't see that happening. I just don't see it.<br />
Q. You said there was no hurry about the changes in the Prime<br />
Minister's Department. Can you give us an outline of your thinking of what<br />
you are after with the policy secretariat? / 8 </p>
<p>PM : Well, there has been a very heavy work load on the Head of the<br />
Prime Minister's Department because at the same time he has been the<br />
Secretary to Cabinet. There has been, and are, an awful lot of Cabinet<br />
Meetings, and they go on late, and he has to sit in the room all the time;<br />
he has to prepare for them before~ hand. He has to spend a day afterwards<br />
looking after them. This really leaves with the other you know, with<br />
the policy things that keep coming in to the Prime Minister's Department<br />
a nd they tend to be growing this has, and I think has for some time led<br />
to a sort of feeling that it was not efficient for one man to try and do both.<br />
Q. So you are looking at splitting the functions?<br />
PM: Yes That's right.<br />
Q. You say there is no hurry, so I take it that at the moment MW<br />
Hewitt stays in the Universities Commission?<br />
PM: I just Said there was no hurry, didn't I?<br />
Q. Do yc -Envisage having a full-time Secretary to Cabinet?<br />
PM: I would think this seems to be the kind of thing that is developing,<br />
yes; preparing submissions, indicating to me because they keep coming in<br />
which ones seem suitable for a Cabinet Committee to deal with because I<br />
would I am gding to try I don't know if it is possible but I am going to<br />
try to use Cabinet Committees a lot more instead of full Cabinets because<br />
we were spending a really terrific lot of time, we have been for years, and<br />
it has been growing the amount of time one spends. It may well be possible<br />
that some of that load can be removed by the use of Cabinet Committees.<br />
This is the sort of thing that a Cabinet Secretariat would look into, and it<br />
would serve us, and it would suggest how these things could be done<br />
record the sitting, record the decisions, follow up the decisions after they<br />
are made with the various Departments, this kind of thing.<br />
Q. Would this also mean that junior Ministers might be appointed to<br />
some of these Cabinet Committees? You mentioned difficulties with the<br />
States. Might the same thing also happen where specific s~ bhisiom from<br />
them to Cabinet might mean they would be on a Committee of Cabinet?<br />
So in effect there is a breaking down of a strict 12-man Cabinet?<br />
PM: Well, it would depend. What is in my mind is that Cabinet deals<br />
with the higher policy matters, and a number of things aren't such as<br />
whether you build a building'here or whether you build a building there or<br />
matters of that kind. There are quite a lot of those. As it is now, there<br />
are Committees on which junior Ministers sit the General Administrative<br />
Committee, for example. On this there is a mixture of Cabinet Ministers<br />
and junior Ministers. The Legislation Cominittee is a :. mixture of junior<br />
and senior. That kind of thing might be able to be ex'ended, or we get<br />
something of the Social Services sort of Committee Zh the Ministers<br />
concerned with myself for a nominee, and we go through it. After that it is<br />
possible it might go to a full Cabinet, but that confines discussion for a start. </p>
<p>Q. on the machinery of this, Sir, does this mean the Permanent<br />
H-ead of the Department the way you are thinking atr the moment<br />
wouldn't be Secretary to Cabinet and wouldn't attend Cabinet meetings,<br />
but you* would have a separate Cabinet Secretariat<br />
PM: Well, these are the things we are working out. We are<br />
discussing them at the moment. There are problems. arising....<br />
Q. Sir, is there any particular reason for switching tourism to<br />
go with the Work portfolio?<br />
PM: No, but I thought Senator Wright does come from a State in.<br />
which tourism bulks very largely. Of course it does in Queensland too,<br />
but Tasmania..<br />
Q. Mr Bury seems to have dropped down he's No. 9.<br />
PM: Well he was No. 10 or No. 11 before.<br />
Q. Sir, could you tell us about the " Voyager" report. IHas Cabinet<br />
had a look at it yet or will it look at it this week? Will it look at<br />
Captain Robertson's position<br />
PM: We must discuss it this week. Yes.<br />
Q. Will the question of the payment of compensation to Captain<br />
Robertson be considered by Cabinet? should<br />
PM: I think the report will go to Cabinet and we WM wait until<br />
Cabinet has considered<br />
Q. Can we have that bit on the record, Sir?<br />
PM: What?<br />
Q. That it will go up to Cabinet?<br />
PM:. Yes.<br />
Q. This is on Wednesday afternoon?<br />
PM: Yes, or Thursday.<br />
Q. When is the debate likely to be in the House, Sir? There will<br />
be a debate?<br />
PM: Oh, we will table the report in the House. I hadn't thought<br />
whether we would initiate a debate or we would leave it to the Opposition<br />
to initiate a debate on it. were<br />
Q. At the same time as you me looking at the possibility of<br />
amalgamating the Health group of Departments, did you look at the<br />
Defence group? / 1l </p>
<p>PM: No, I didn't. I know a lot of people think they should be<br />
amalgamated. I have heard it argued " Look at what Mr McNamara<br />
couild do over in the United States as a strong Secretary of Defence" but<br />
I think we have got to remember that they also have a Secretary of the<br />
Navy and a Secretary of the Army and a Secretary of the Air Force under<br />
Mr McNamara as a strong Secretary of Defence It is the same set-up.<br />
People point to is as if it were a different one.<br />
Q. What is the chance of integration as in Canada, Sir?<br />
PM: In Canada they have had integration. Well some people like<br />
it and some people don't. In England, they set up the Defence thing<br />
this is not attributable; entirely off the record it seems to have<br />
resulted mostly in a very considerable increase in the number of civilian<br />
public servants and very little else.<br />
The course it seems to me one follows here becan~<br />
if there is just one Minister for Defence,. I think an awful lot o~ le sMR<br />
are not going to be made by Ministers, they are going to be made by<br />
civil servants. They must be. Nobody would be capable of doing otherwise.<br />
But there are things through the three Services which can be integrated. with<br />
advantage. Mddical services is one that springs to mind. Certain, but<br />
not all, methods of supply; intelligence. There are a number of things<br />
which have grown up separately in Departments which could be integrated,<br />
but I am not enamoured of the idea of wiping out Service Ministers. I know<br />
there are an awful lot of them there, but there is an awful lot of money<br />
bei ng spent too. And it is being spent in a way involving constant decisions.<br />
Social Services, for example, spends a great deal of money, but by and<br />
large it is according to the book, with a discretion not necessarily to go<br />
along with the book. You know pension rates are set, and whether a<br />
chap is competent or not to get it is set. It is more of a mo uting thing.<br />
So there it is. No, I didn't look closely at that.<br />
Q. So as long as you are Prime Minister, then Sir<br />
PM: Oh, come off it. I was asked did I look at it, and I didn't it.<br />
I have expressed a sort of approach to it but I am not to be regarded as<br />
saying as long as I am Prime Minister something is immutable....<br />
Q. You gave a pretty good argument why they should stay as they are.<br />
PM: Well, somebody might come up with a better argument as to why<br />
they shouldn't. I can't fore see that.<br />
Q. Did you have a look at self-government for the Post Office, Sir?<br />
PM! Well that's not down here anywhere.. I think no comment on<br />
that one.<br />
Q. Sir, could yoL~ ust clarify one thing more in relation to the<br />
" Voyager". Cabinet on Thursday will look at the report or will look at the<br />
report in relation to any injustice that may have been done to Captain<br />
Robertson? </p>
<p>PM: At this stage, I am just saying that the report is here. I haven't<br />
discussed it, any aspect of it with my colleagues at all, but it will be<br />
before us and the whole report will be discussed. I can't say anything<br />
even non-attributable or off the record which would tend to bind somebody<br />
when I haven't spoken to them.<br />
Q. Coming back to the new Army Minister, Sir, you don't feel that<br />
the Army fighting in Viet Nam requires a more experienced Minister<br />
than a total newcomer?<br />
PM: Well, that is something that was in my own mind, or that I have<br />
turned over in my own mind. But I think a Minister in regard to any<br />
sort of military operations . depends on hislaffi res, and the military<br />
advisers are there. I have considered it but I can ' t see any way in<br />
which the effectiveness or effic iency of the Army would be hurt by this.<br />
Q. Sir, will Mr Howson and Mr Chipp go to the back benches?<br />
Are they going to resign either one of them, or anything like this?<br />
PM: They will be private Members of Parliament.<br />
Q. There is no suggestion of, oxerseas diplomatic appointments?<br />
PM: Not now<br />
( Interjection Not in the near future!)<br />
PM: No'<br />
Q. One name not on the list is Mr Erwin's. Anything contemplated<br />
at all for him?<br />
PM: He's the Chief Whip.<br />
Q. Will there be a Whip appointed in the Senate?<br />
PM: The Whip is always elected in the Senate.<br />
MR EGGLETON Except for that one small point made, everything was not<br />
for attribution today.<br />
Q. We Cl quote the PM as saing Cabinet will discuss the " Voyager"<br />
report andill not anticipate wherher. the question of compensation for<br />
Captain Robertson will arise?<br />
MR EGGLETON. Yes.<br />
