 DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE OFFICE OF   NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS</p>
<p>Mr Kim Jones AM concludes his five year term as Director General of ONA on 14 December.  I wish to record my appreciation for the outstanding contribution that Mr Jones has made over a public service career that spans 42 years in Australia and abroad.</p>
<p>As Director General, Mr Jones has led ONA through an intense and challenging period for the intelligence community and Australian foreign policy.  ONA's impressive performance on crucial issues such as the independence of East Timor, the war on terrorism and, most recently, Iraq are a testament to Mr Jones's leadership and professionalism.  Throughout this period the Australian government and people have been well served by a talented and hard working intelligence community.</p>
<p>I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Jones's substantial contribution to Australian diplomacy and foreign policy prior to his appointment to ONA.  His previous positions include Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ambassador to France, three postings to Japan, Acting Deputy Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and head of DFAT's Disarmament, Security and Nuclear Division.</p>
<p>Mr Jones declined an offer to extend his term as Director General of ONA.  I wish him all the best in his well earned retirement.</p>
<p>I will make an announcement on Mr Jones's replacement in the near future after the formal processes have been concluded.  In the meantime the Deputy Director General, Mr John Eyers, will act in the position.</p>
