ENTRY OF FURTHER GROUP OF VIETNAMESE REFUGEES<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that Australia<br />
had agreed to resettle approximately 300 more refugees<br />
from Vietnam. The refugees will be flown by chartered Qantas 747<br />
jet to Brisbane on Saturday morning, 9 August, where they<br />
are due at 11.00 a. m.<br />
They will be resettled in Brisbane, where Queensland<br />
authorities have assured support and assistance.<br />
At present about two-thirds of the refugees are on<br />
St Jphn's Island in Singapore harbour, with the remainder<br />
on Perhentian Island off the East coast of Malaysia.<br />
In June Australia selected 200 refugees who have been<br />
settled in East Hills, Sydney,<br />
Mr Whitlam said that as part of its commitment to<br />
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees program<br />
Australia had now taken refugees from Hong Kong,<br />
Singapore and Malaysia.<br />
In each case, Mr Whitla-m said, Australia had. selected<br />
refugees who were least likely to be selected for entry to<br />
other countries and those who appeared most in need of the<br />
humanitarian assistance which entry to Australia would provide.<br />
Most of the refugees have no recognised skills or<br />
qualifications and under normal migration criteria would not be<br />
eligible for entry to Australia. They would need extensive<br />
long-term assistance from the Australian Government and the<br />
community, Mr Whitlam said.<br />
He recalled his announcement of 23 July of a long-term<br />
study of the Vietnamese refugees and the problems which they<br />
encounter and said that he hoped this study would identify<br />
early any problems which refugees were facing and the means of<br />
resolving them. ./ 2 </p>

Mr Whitlam said the refugees ranged in age from<br />
infants to an 81 year old woman, and included a Cistercian<br />
Monk, a former interpreter for an Australian civil<br />
affairs unit stationed in Phuoc Tuy Province, a number<br />
of single parent families and a number of adolescents who<br />
had become separated from their parents.<br />
He emphasised that in their immediate resettlement all<br />
the refugees would be provided with the maximum assistance<br />
available through agencies of the Australian Government<br />
for housing, welfare, language training and employment.<br />
Mr Whitlam expressed his gratitude for assistance<br />
provided to the Australian Immigration selection team by the<br />
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the<br />
Governments of Singapore and Malaysia.<br />
