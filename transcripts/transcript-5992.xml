FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 20 JANUARY 1983<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF: COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE FOR MOLASSES<br />
SHIPMENT TO BUNDABERG<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the Government had<br />
agreed to a request by Queensland that State expenditure on<br />
transporting by sea a bulk shipment of molasses from far<br />
north Queensland to Bundaberg be considered as eligible for<br />
Commonwealth assistance under the Natural Disaster Relief<br />
Arrangements. This is a -special measure in recognition of the<br />
severity of the drought.<br />
The molasses is to be used for stock fodder in drought affected<br />
areas. Current usage for this purpose is high and existing<br />
supplies at Bundaberg are expected to be exhausted by early<br />
February.<br />
The cost to the State of transporting 10,000 tonnes by ship,<br />
which is the most cost effective means, is estimated to be<br />
$ 268,000. This will be eligible for Commonwealth assistance<br />
on a $ 3 to $ 1 basi5 under the arrangements. Similar assistance<br />
was provided to Queensland in 1980.<br />
This is a further example of the Commonwealth's willingness<br />
to co-operate with the State Governments in providing<br />
measures of real assistance to the nation's hard pressed<br />
primary producers. </p>
