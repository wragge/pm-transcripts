FOR PRESS 12 JUNE 1976<br />
JOINT PRESS STATEMENT GOVERNMENT/ UNION TALKS<br />
Representatives of the Government and the ACTU and other<br />
peak national Trade Union Councils met in Canberra over<br />
the last two days.<br />
The meetings were chaired throughout by the Prime Minister.<br />
The Trade Union representatives were led by the President<br />
of the ACTU, Mr Hawke.<br />
A full list of those attending is attached.<br />
The discussions were wide-ranging, frank and cordial.<br />
A very constructive outcome was a decision to continue<br />
discussions at officer level between the Government and the<br />
peak councils.<br />
It is expected these discussions will be on a continuing basis.<br />
They will cover a number of areas, including:-<br />
an on-going exchange of information on the economic<br />
situation;<br />
manpower policies;<br />
shipbuilding; aboriginal welfare and employment. , a . t4_ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
In addition, discussions will also be taking place on<br />
certain technical matters relating to Medibank and possible<br />
appropriate.-modifications to the opetatiol of the Prices<br />
Justification Tribunal.<br />
A number of these discussions will commence next week'.<br />
Both sides recognised the value of the discussions over the<br />
past two days and agreed that it would.. be desirable to have<br />
similar discussions on policy issues of mutual concern<br />
from time to time.<br />
The Economy<br />
The discussions traversed the present state of the economy,<br />
the Government's overall strategies and its assessment of the<br />
future.<br />
There was common concern about the present problems of the<br />
economy and agreement on the fund~ amental objectives to be sought.<br />
These included the reduction of inflation, the resumption of<br />
economic growth and a return to full employment.<br />
Both sides recognised that under the present extraordinary<br />
economic conditions, there is an inter-relationship between inflation<br />
and the level of unemployment. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The Union representatives sought from the Government a detailed<br />
exposition of its strategies, including their economic and<br />
social implications.<br />
The Government spelt out its strategies for policies to restore<br />
economic prosperity and the analysis of economic developments<br />
on which it is based. In doing so it emphasised that its<br />
policies should not be viewed piecemeal but seen as an<br />
integrated whole.<br />
It believes that the slump in activity and employment, which<br />
accompanied the exceptionally high rate of inflation in<br />
1974-75, has been halted and a tentative recovery begun.<br />
It sees 1976-77 as a year of moderate growth in activity and<br />
employment. Taking the more optimistic side of possibilities,<br />
this employment growth may be sufficient to lead to a gradual<br />
reduction in the number of unemployed.<br />
However, in the Government's view that prognosis could well<br />
prove optimistic unless there is further progress in curbing<br />
inflation and inflationary expectations. It is essentially<br />
because of the continuing inflationary environment that no<br />
marked early decline in unemployment can be categorically<br />
predicted at this time. </p>
<p>4<br />
In the* Government's view, any recovery which takes place<br />
without the clear prospect of continuing reduction in the<br />
rate of inflation from its present double-digit level is<br />
likely to be weak and short lived.<br />
While the unions agreed that there were some signs supporting<br />
the Government's view about the recovery of the economy,<br />
they were less confident of this taking place.<br />
The union representatives sought detailed elaboration of the<br />
Government's outlook for the economy. They were particularly<br />
concerned with prospects for employment and real household<br />
disposable incomes.<br />
There were differences of view about the most effective ways<br />
of achieving the commonly shared objectives. The unions<br />
questioned some elements of the Government's approach and put<br />
forward various suggestions by way of alternatives.<br />
Both the ACTU and the Government . agreed on the importance of<br />
reducing unemployment.<br />
The Trade Union movement drew attention to the need for<br />
maintaining real disposable income standards and achieving an<br />
increase in these standards as soon as possible. </p>
<p>It agreed with the Government that increases in real disposable<br />
income throughout the community are related to growth in<br />
productivity and in real output.<br />
The Government for its part noted that this was a question<br />
not only of real award wages but also of cash benefits such as<br />
family allowances, the burden of personal taxation and of<br />
the rate of economic recovery affecting employment and overtime<br />
earnings. The Government was impressed by the views put by the Trade Union<br />
movement concerning a general reduction in taxation whether<br />
direct or indirect.<br />
The Government drew attention to its recent policies covering<br />
income tax indexation and family allowances. These reflect a<br />
significant reduction and redistribution of taxation in areas of need<br />
Further, the Government noted that many sections believe they are<br />
deserving of tax relief. The Government will give full weight to<br />
the views expressed by the Trade Union movement concerning further<br />
relief for individuals as and when economic circumstances permit.<br />
The Government remains committed to policies that will lighten<br />
the general burden of taxation and, in this, its objectives accord<br />
with the views expressed by the President of the ACTU.<br />
The Union representatives acknowledged the relevance of the<br />
magnitude of wage claims in the present circumstances to the processes<br />
of economic recovery, , including the achievement of full employment<br />
and a reduction in inflation. </p>
<p>MANPOWER POLICIES<br />
The unions raised questions relating to the administration<br />
of unemployment benefit, job creation schemes, NEAT and<br />
NAAS; as well as the evolution of effective long-term<br />
manpower policies.<br />
The Government accepted the unions$ views that these should<br />
not be areas of political controversy that immediate<br />
issues should be pursue d with officials of the Department of<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations, and that they should<br />
work out an appropriate framework for wider and regular<br />
discussions involving other Departments.<br />
SHIPBUILDING The meeting discussed the grave situation in the shipbuilding<br />
industry particularly at Newcastle and Whyalla. The<br />
continued existence of the industry is endangered by low,<br />
producti vity and intense competition from imports.<br />
The cost of the existing subsidy is already high.<br />
In J975/ 76 it will exceed $ 42m. and a much higher<br />
subsidy will be needed if orders are to be obtained.<br />
Both short and long term aspects of the problem were discussed<br />
including the need to consider it in the context of the total<br />
transport industry. Establishment of a national shipbuilding<br />
body was considered and it was agreed that the Department<br />
of Industry and Commerce and other Departments would hold<br />
further discussions next week, first with managemecnt and then </p>
<p>7.<br />
with shipbuilding unions.<br />
MEDIBANK The Government.-explained the background to its decirions<br />
aimed at ensuring universal coverage for health care, of<br />
placing a direct responsibility for health costs on<br />
individuals according to their capacity to pay and of<br />
widening the choice of individuals.<br />
The unions made it clear that they had been strongly opposed<br />
to the Government's original proposals. Although the<br />
changes subsequently announced represented a very<br />
substantial improvement, there were still aspects on which<br />
they sought further clarification. These included the basis<br />
on which Medibank ( Private Insurance) would compete with<br />
-private health funds-and the level of. the. levy..<br />
Again, arrangements were made for discussions next week aimed<br />
at further clarification of the technical issues involved.<br />
The Government indicated that it would shortly be issuing<br />
explanatory literature on the options open to individuals<br />
so that they would be able to make appropriate choices.<br />
The Government indicated that insofar as these changes<br />
resulted in increases in~ the Consumer Price Index, then, for<br />
the purpose of adjustment to award wages for movements in<br />
the Consumer Price Index *= der the wage indexation principles,<br />
the Commonwealth would not be arguing that the index should be </p>
<p>" discounted" for these particular increases.<br />
PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNhAL<br />
The unions pressed strongly for the maintenance of the<br />
Prices Justification Tribunal, at the same time<br />
recognising that there was scope for some changes in the<br />
existing machinery.<br />
The Government indicated that it was disposed to the<br />
continuation of the Prices Justification Tribunal in an<br />
appropriately modified form. It note d, however, that it<br />
would wish to wait till after its discussions with the<br />
employers on 2 July before reaching a final view.<br />
Meanwhile, arrangements were made for further technical<br />
level discussions between the Government and the unions on<br />
this matter.<br />
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION<br />
The unions, while conceding that the legislation on postal<br />
ballots was an improvement on the Government's original<br />
proposals, reiterated in the strongest terms their basic<br />
opposition to the legislation and urged that it should not<br />
be proclaimed.<br />
The Government, while maintaining its view that it wished to<br />
give every member of a union and employer organisation<br />
adequate opportunity to c:.: zcse those who should be responsible<br />
for conductof the affairs Of the organisation, noted the unions' view. </p>
