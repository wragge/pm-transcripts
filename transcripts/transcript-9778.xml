TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MURRAY NICOLL, -DRIVE TIME", ABC RADIO SAN<br />
ADELAIDE E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
MN: Prime Minister, Paul Keating.<br />
PM. How are you Murray?<br />
MN: I'm well, thank you. You're back in the ciV now after being on the<br />
Peninsula?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MN: What did you say to the people of the Eyre Peninsula, and perhaps<br />
more Importantly, what did they say to you?<br />
PM: Well, the point of going was to talk about the sus~ tinability of<br />
agriculture, and we have been now looking at regions of Australia<br />
there is ai strategy we have in South West Queensland, one in NSW<br />
and now the Eyre Peninsula in* South Australia, to look at support<br />
from the FederarGovernment, to look at ways of in which farms can<br />
be improved, to underline the importance of whole of farm<br />
management. What that means is drawing the farm so that on the<br />
good soils you grow certain crops, not all the soils will be uniform, the<br />
place won't be able to stand uniform stocking rates, in other words,<br />
getting a plan for the farm, and getting a plan for the region. And you<br />
might remember a year ago, in November last year, Bob Collins and I<br />
announced the Drought Package for the drought affected farms, and<br />
we also introduced Bonds Firm Bonds to smooth income out, and<br />
concessions for water and fodder. Well, during that time we started<br />
then putting a line under this question of sustainability in agriculture,<br />
and from that day to this, we have been on that subject, and today I<br />
received a report from the Land Management Task Force on this very<br />
subject. And, of course, we are seeing this-put Into place here in a<br />
regional way on the Eyre Peninsula. </p>
<p>TEL: 3. Ot. 2<br />
MN: Traditionally, of course, Liberal strongholds out in the bush we have<br />
not seen much Labor action out in the country before now...<br />
PMV: We have held Grey for 10 years, until we lost it last.<br />
MN: Yeah you reckon you can get it back this time, right?<br />
PM; Well, it's a margin of a couple of percent... . but look, I mean, I heard<br />
your introduction about the election and the rest, but I have been<br />
going around rural Australia now for a couple of years about this<br />
same subject. I was in Orange 2 weeks ago, I was in Roma about a<br />
month before that, in Wlnton in Queensland a month eore that.<br />
And I think with the droug~-t ' having come through, with all of the<br />
devastation it left in its wake, we have got to draw some lessons from<br />
it, and keep the momentum going towards sustainable agriculture, so<br />
that we are not seeing people walk off arms because they become<br />
marginal because they are not properly managed. I think this is the<br />
time to actually drive that lesson home.<br />
MN. Meantime, you are getting a bit of a jump on the Opposition Leader,<br />
John Howard?<br />
PM: Well, we are interested in Australian farms, and the family farm we<br />
did as no Federal Government has ever done we suspended the<br />
Farm Assets Test for those areas which were affected by drought,<br />
Whfich means that now 11,000 farm families are getting income<br />
support, so we are doing these very solid and tangible things. The<br />
Farm Bonds are, I think, a great breakthrough, and I have always<br />
held the view that the family farm is the backbone of Australian<br />
agriculture that we will get the... . no one will care for agricultural land<br />
if the family walk off the farms. So, we need to keep our productivity<br />
up, and the quality of the land the whole Landcare movement is<br />
coming from the family farming community, and I think we the<br />
Federal Government, certainly this Labor Government wants to<br />
keep that going.<br />
MN: Did you get any reaction from out on the land at the French nqpcleqr<br />
,--tests? I mean, you have been dealing with people who's livelihood is<br />
the land, and vice versa the land is their life and this is what it is all<br />
about the environment and the nuclear tests in the Pacific, and the<br />
ap'iazing second test a huge explosion on another Atoll did you get<br />
any reaction from the people put on the land about that?<br />
PM: No, I didn't today, but I have it, of course, in many other places, and I<br />
can only agree with the sentIments I think you are expressing there<br />
implicitly, Murray. That is, this is a very foolish thing for the French<br />
Government to do. The interests of France, and every developed<br />
country, and all those people who cherish liberty, should be to<br />
dimlnlsh the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The sin that France is 015 P0,~' </p>

committing is to say to the would-be proliferators this is the lraqs,<br />
Irans, the Pakistans and countries like that, who, we're told, are<br />
developing a nuclear capability to say to them as a sort of<br />
developed democracy, well, that's okay you can go and let your<br />
bombs off, and do as we're doing. I mean, that I think, is the principal<br />
point of objection, let alone the lack of regard for the people of the<br />
Pacific whose wishes they have simply just ignored.<br />
MN: What about the suggestion and it's come from many quarters of this<br />
country that we should say to the French Ambassador in Canberra<br />
it's time you got on your bike, and that, in fact, all other countries<br />
around the world should do the same thing. How would you feel<br />
about that?<br />
PMV: Well, it's a matter of whether you do better engaging these societies<br />
and governments, than not engaging them.<br />
MVN: And that is the reason our Ambassador is still in Paris?<br />
PMV: Yes. I think we have been more effective in engaging them, As you<br />
may know, I wrote an article for LeMonde, I did one also for<br />
Liberation, and these had some Influence in-the French debate, and<br />
in'the German debate. And I think this debate in Germany is starting<br />
now to run against the French President and he may deign to, you<br />
know, take a view askance at Australia's view, but certainly not<br />
German public opinion. But he doesn't need to go further than his<br />
own country now, the overwhelming number of people in France<br />
now dis-favour this policy, and wish he would desist. It's all about, of<br />
course, the Second World War it's all about saying it will never<br />
happen again. Well, they already have a stock of nuclear weapons in<br />
their inventory. The issue for France, I think, is to engage the rest of<br />
the world not to sit back with a sort of a you know, a nuclear weapon<br />
under its arm, but rather to deal with the real problems and that's t<br />
way I think France will find that it doesn't face any sort of problems<br />
that it faced in 1940.<br />
MVN:-So the French Ambassador will stay In Canberra?<br />
PM: Well, I think if we say to him go, what we are saying is that we don't<br />
want a dialogue with France, we don't want to talk to them, we don't<br />
want to have a communication with them, That seems to me to be a<br />
pretty strange policy when you object to what they are doing.<br />
MN. Can we go any further than we have already gone is there anything<br />
else we can do?<br />
PM: Well, we have got the Foreign Minister at the moment at the United<br />
Nations getting a resolution together against France. We have,<br />
today at the Pacific Forum, broken off their dialogue partner status<br />
this is the dialogue partner status that France enjoys with the </p>
<p>TEL: 3 ct. 1: 4 NO.<br />
4<br />
countries of the Pacific Forum, which is the Pacific Island countries,<br />
including Australia and, as you know, our protests against France<br />
has been our strongest protest ever against a democratic state.<br />
MN:-John Howard today has said that the Coalition is seriously<br />
considering releasing more of their policies in the lead-up to the<br />
election, and we're moving onto the fact that you are doing a lot of<br />
moving around the country at the moment, and so are a lot of others<br />
in this pre-election campaign they're calling it a scare campaign, of<br />
course, that you are Involved in. Have you seen Mr Howard's 12<br />
point minimum standard through industrial relations?<br />
PM: No, I haven't. You might remember Murray you need a bit of a<br />
memory with John Howard but you remember before the last*<br />
election, he had an Industrial Relations Bill he was going to table?<br />
And he was going to table it up until the last week of the campaign...<br />
MN: Well, they did run into some other problems during the campaign.<br />
PM; I know but he never tabled it. He had a Bill ready, he said the IR<br />
Bill, the Industrial Relations Bill but we never saw it. Now, if he had<br />
it ready for March 1993, he certainly had it ready in these last couple<br />
of.. because he was then the Industrial Relations spokesman. He is<br />
now the Leader of the Opposition with essentially the same view, and<br />
what we are saying to him is I mean, he wants to cut the wages of<br />
people in the bottom deciles of income. He calls it labour market<br />
flexibility it's basically wage cuts. People would lose penalty rates,<br />
overtime rates, holiday leave loadings without compensation in their<br />
wages. And what I have said today and yesterday was if Andrew<br />
Robb their Federal Director who was on the Sunday program on<br />
Sunday saying we have got 98% of our policies prepared why are<br />
they keeping them from the Australian public? I mean, they are not<br />
keeping them from me I only get 1 vote in the election, It's the<br />
community of Australia who are entitled to know where the major<br />
Parties would lead them.<br />
MN: But it is a valid answer, when we are not officially in an election mode<br />
it is a valid answer to say well, last time we laid it all out on the<br />
table, it got up and hit us between the eyes?<br />
P M: It got up and hit them between the eyes because it was no good,<br />
Murray. It's not valid for any Party to hide its policies. The Federal<br />
Government is out there with a balanced Budget with a Budget in<br />
surplus we say how we are doing it, we have got all the measures<br />
down there in the Budget. I mean, when I announced -with the<br />
ACTU the Accord, we had to say how it would work, how it endorsed<br />
the 2-3% inflation rate. When I lay down the structure for the<br />
Republic, I said we are going to move to an Australian republic, and<br />
here is the model. There's no trickiness on our part. This tricky view<br />
this sort of sneaky view that you have policies, but you think they 015P. U' </p>
<p>TEL: 3 . Oct .95 5 N o. 015 P. 0 51 0<br />
are too crook to show the public because they won't like them, and<br />
you can slip them past them in the last 10 days of the poll, is, I think,<br />
high dishonesty in politics.<br />
MN: But realistically, nobody comes up with policies they are fully<br />
convinced that the public won't like?<br />
PM: Well, if you have got policies that you are convinced that the public<br />
won't like, why would you want to be Prime Minister of Australia? I<br />
mean, Kf you think your policies are going to be anathema to the<br />
community, then you ought to be out of the business. I mean, these<br />
people are saying here's Andrew Robb brazen as they come, out<br />
there on the Sunday program saying we have got our policies 98%<br />
prepared. Well, why won't you show the Australian public, Mr Robb<br />
and Mr Howard? [ And they will reply] " because I don't think they will<br />
like them".<br />
MN: The standard question that you are getting at the moment as you<br />
move around the election. Ralph Willis, the Treasurer, was on this<br />
radio station not so many weeks ago saying that the election will be<br />
held in the first quarter of next year does that still hold?<br />
PM: Well, the Treasurer doesn't speak on these matters. These matters<br />
have always been left to the Prime Minister, and every Australian<br />
Prime Minister has the discretion in this. But, I have made clear right<br />
through when I have been asked this and remember this, first of all<br />
John Hewson started talking about an early election 15 months ago,<br />
then Alexander Downer said we were going to have an early election,<br />
then John Howard said we would have an early election, and all the<br />
pundits when the Budget came out they said " oh, surplus Budget<br />
clearing the decks for an election". Well of course, it was all untrue.<br />
I have said right from the start that I think the public believe that<br />
Parliament when they elect a Government they should be able to<br />
draw the maximum advantage from the Government's work over the<br />
course of the Parliament, and that having early elections is too tricky,<br />
and not to be considered. That's always been my view,<br />
MVN: And that still holds -we won't be going to the polls before Christmas?<br />
P M: I'm not. . the chance of us going to the polls before Christmas is very,<br />
very slender Indeed. But I am not saying definitely to you or to any<br />
other commentator to give away a Prime Minster's right which every<br />
Australian Prime Minister has enjoyed.<br />
MN: So that's an almost definite?<br />
PM: No you'll get no more from me than that. I'm not here to make<br />
headlines for you.<br />
MN: It's an almost definite it's a definite should be that way? </p>
<p>TEL: 3 . Oct .95 5: 21 N0.015 P. 06' 0E<br />
6<br />
PM: Wts a definite that the public want value from the Parliament, and they<br />
don't like politicians being tricky, purling erections at times to suit<br />
themselves.<br />
M N. And the Prime Minister would never go to an election until he thought<br />
he could win it?<br />
PM: Well, the Prime Minister will have to go to an election within 3 years<br />
of the last Parliament sitting. It's just a matter of the Constitution.<br />
MN: Okay. Now, you're about to head off in fact, I think I have held you<br />
up, I think. What are you doing in town tonight?<br />
PM: Well, I'm opening the restoration of the Palm House in the Gardens.<br />
MN: Oh, yes.<br />
PM: We gave $ 1 million to it, under the, 0, Oe-J~ on program, which I<br />
introduced, as you know, for these public works back in 1992. Now,<br />
my last visit to Adelaide was on the One Nation train which brought<br />
the standard gauge railways for the first time from Melbourne to<br />
Adelaide. Arnd we also had one there for heritage buildings the<br />
restoration of heritage buildings and this is a classic heritage<br />
building. Now, the Premier is down here tonight, and the Premier<br />
knows this you don't get to get your name on a plaque unless you<br />
put some money in. Now so far, we haven't got any money out of<br />
him. So, all the garden types down there who support this garden,<br />
should say to him now listen Dean, if you want your name on the<br />
maker's label here, you had better get your cheque book out.<br />
MN: Well, if you find out a way to get a buck out of Premier Dean Brown,<br />
let me know will you there's a lot of people wTho would join the<br />
queue?<br />
PM: Well, he always comes around asking me.<br />
MN: Maybe he thinks you have got a Santa wallet?<br />
PM; He puts on a sad face, and he thinks I'm a sucker for a sort of sad<br />
look.<br />
MN: Okay. Thank you I would like to talk to you next time you're in town.<br />
PM: Thanks Murray.<br />
ends. </p>
