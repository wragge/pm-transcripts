    <content><![CDATA[<p>11 NovemberÂ 1993</p>
<p>We do not know this Australian's name and we never will. We do not know his rank or his battalion. We do not know where he was born, or precisely how and when he died.Â We do not know there in Australia he had made his home or when he left it for the battlefield of Europe. We do not know his age or his circumstances whether he was from the city or the bush; what occupation he left to become a soldier; what religion, ifÂ he had a religion; if he was married or single. We do not know who this AustralianÂ was.</p>
<p>Yet he has always been among those we have honoured. We know that he was one ofÂ the 45,000 Australians who died on the Western Front. One of the 416,000Â Australians who volunteered for service in the First World War. One of the 324,000Â Australians who served overseas in that war, and one of the 60,000 Australians whoÂ died on foreign soil. One of the 100,000 Australians who have died in wars thisÂ century.</p>
<p>He is all of them. And he is one of us.</p>
<p>This Australia and the Australia he knew are like foreign countries. The tide of eventsÂ since he died has been so dramatic, so vast and all-consuming, a world has beenÂ created beyond the reach of his imagination.</p>
<p>He may have been one of those who believed the Great War would be an adventureÂ too grand to miss. He may have felt that he would never live down the shame of notÂ going. But the chances are that he went for no other reason than that he believed itÂ was his duty the duty he owed his country and his King.</p>
<p>Because the Great War was a mad, brutal, awful struggle distinguished more oftenÂ than not by military and political incompetence; because the waste of human life wasÂ so terrible that some said victory was scarcely discernible from defeat; and because theÂ war which was supposed to end all wars in fact sowed the seeds of a second, evenÂ more terrible, war we might think that this Unknown Soldier died in vain.Â </p>
<p>But in honouring our war dead as we always have, we declare that this is not true.</p>
<p>For out of the war came a lesson which transcended the horror and tragedy and theÂ inexcusable folly.</p>
<p>It was a lesson about ordinary people and the lesson was that they were not ordinary.</p>
<p>On all sides they were the heroes of that war: not the generals and the politicians, butÂ the soldiers and sailors and nurses those who taught us to endure hardship, showÂ courage, to be bold as well as resilient, to believe in ourselves, to stick together.</p>
<p>The Unknown Australian Soldier we inter today was one of those who by his deedsÂ proved that real nobility and grandeur belongs not to empires and nations but to theÂ people on whom they, in the last resort, always depend.</p>
<p>That is surely at the heart of the Anzac story, the Australian legend which emergedÂ from the war. It is a legend not of sweeping military victories so much as triumphsÂ against the odds, of courage and ingenuity in adversity. It is a legend of free andÂ independent spirits whose discipline derived less from military formalities andÂ customs than from the bonds of mateship and the demands of necessity.</p>
<p>It is a democratic tradition, the tradition in which Australians have gone to war everÂ since. The Unknown Australian is not interred here to glorify war over peace; or to assert aÂ soldier's character above a civilian's; or one race or one nation or one religion above Â another; or men above women; or the war in which he fought and died above anyÂ other war; or of one generation above any that has or will come later.</p>
<p>The Unknown soldier honours the memory of all those men and women who laidÂ down their lives for Australia.</p>
<p>His tomb is a reminder of what we have lost in war and what we have gained.</p>
<p>We have lost more than 100,000 lives, and with them all their love of this country andÂ all their hope and energy.</p>
<p>We have gained a legend: a story of bravery and sacrifice and with it a deeper faith inÂ ourselves and our democracy, and a deeper understanding of what it means to beÂ Australian.</p>
<p>It is not too much to hope, therefore, that this Unknown Australian soldier mightÂ continue to serve his country he might enshrine a nation's love of peace and remindÂ us that in the sacrifice of the men and women whose names are recorded here there isÂ faith enough for all of us.</p>
