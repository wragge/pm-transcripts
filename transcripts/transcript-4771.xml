J*, AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 8 August 1978<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY<br />
MATTERS IN RELATION TO ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION<br />
QUEENSLAND 1977<br />
The Report of the Royal Comrmission is being sent to all<br />
members of the Parliament today,<br />
At the first opportunity the Report will be tabled<br />
in Parliament.<br />
I have taken the course of releasing the Report before the<br />
Parliament meets because it is important that the public<br />
have an awareness of the facts.<br />
Following allegations made both inside and outside the<br />
Parliament concerning the Queensland redistribution of<br />
electoral boundaries, it was determined on 18 January<br />
that the matter should be referred for investigation and<br />
report by the Law Officers, the Attorney-General,<br />
Senator Durack, and the Solicitor-General, Mr. Byers.<br />
The Law Officers' Report was submitted in February. On<br />
7 April further allegations were made in the Parliament.<br />
The Law Officers' Report was tabled and the new allegations<br />
were referred to the Attorney-General and the<br />
Solicitor-General.<br />
On 23 April, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General<br />
further reported " Whilst it is our view that the form any<br />
investigation should assume is a matter for the Government<br />
to determine, we consider that a judicial inquiry would<br />
be preferable."<br />
The Law officers' recommendation was considered by Senior<br />
Ministers and as a result the Royal Commission was established<br />
on 24 April.<br />
The terms of reference of the Royal Commission were related<br />
to the allegations that had been made concerning the<br />
Queensland redistribution and to the possible involvement<br />
of the Honourable Eric Robinson. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
At a later stage, allegations were made concerning statements<br />
made by Mr. Robinson on uranium mining. Consequently, Cabinet<br />
on 10 May decided that the terms of reference of the Royal<br />
commission should be widened so that this matter also could<br />
be considered by the Royal Commission of Mr. Justice<br />
McGregor. At this time the Government indicated to the<br />
Royal Commission through the Attorney-General that they<br />
would be willing to further extend the terms of reference<br />
if necessary.<br />
On 30 May there was a further extension of the terms of<br />
reference of the Royal Commission. The Commissioner, under<br />
his extended terms of reference, was empowered to find<br />
whether anyone had sought illegally or improperly, to<br />
influence the Commissioners. This extension was also the<br />
result of a Cabinet decision-after full discussion<br />
amongst Ministers.<br />
The Royal Commission exonerated the Hon. Eric Robinson<br />
of allegations concerning the Queensland re-distribution<br />
His Honour said that:<br />
" no breach of a law of the Commonwealth, or<br />
impropriety occurred in the course of the<br />
Re-distribution in 1977 of the State of Queensland<br />
into Electoral Divisions for the election of<br />
Members of the House of Representatives<br />
including the change of the name of a proposed<br />
Division from " Gold Coast" to " McPherson"<br />
by reason of<br />
anything said or action taken by or on<br />
behalf of the Honourable Eric Robinson;<br />
any action taken by the Distribution<br />
Commissioners or any of them as a result<br />
of anything said or action taken ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
( Contd) by or on behalf of the<br />
Honourable Eric Robinson; or<br />
any communication by the<br />
Distribution Commissioners to<br />
the Honourable ERic Robinson".<br />
On the issue of allegations about statements made by<br />
Mr Robinson on uranium, the Commissioner reported:-<br />
" On 26 July 1977 at B,-audesert in<br />
the State of Queensland the Honourable<br />
Eric Robinson made a statement<br />
concerning the likely decisions of the<br />
Commonwealth Government in relation to<br />
the mining of uranium in Australia to<br />
the following effect<br />
" The Government will be making a<br />
decision about mining and export of<br />
uranium early in the Budget session<br />
which commences in-about three weeks<br />
time. If the Government is satisfied<br />
that all interests requiring protection<br />
can be protected I would expect the<br />
Government to authorise mining and export<br />
of uranium."<br />
This was an innocuous statement to which no criticism can<br />
be attached. I have written to Mr Robinson today, asking<br />
him to resume hi-s portfolio as minister for Finance.<br />
In his Report, the Royal Commissioner also considered the<br />
actions of another 1b( inister, Senator the Right Honourable<br />
R. G. Withers in respect of the naming of the electorate<br />
of McPherson. He found that the Minister had done nothing<br />
illegal, but he did find, in the words of the Report:<br />
" The action of Senator the<br />
Right Honourable R. G. Withers.<br />
constitutes impropriety within<br />
the meaning of the Letters Patent<br />
dated 30 May 1978. Senator Withers<br />
used his position to further a<br />
political purpose by an approach<br />
( not open to members of the public)<br />
to the Distribution Commissioners...."<br />
' Wnilst Senator Withers did not seek<br />
to influence, or influence, the<br />
Commissioners in any way about how<br />
they should perform their duties of<br />
distribution of the electoral<br />
divisions in Queensland, he did seek<br />
to influence them and he did in fact<br />
influence them through an intermediary<br />
as to something which they proposed to<br />
say in their Report, that is to say,<br />
the names which they tentatively attached<br />
to two Electoral Divisions. What he did,<br />
having regard to the purpose with which<br />
he did it, in my judgement constitutes<br />
impropriety". </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Senior Ministers considered carefully what should be<br />
done in the light of this finding. We had no doubt<br />
that our first and foremost responsibility was the<br />
maintenance of the high standards of propriety set<br />
and maintained by this Government.<br />
We were of the view that Mr. Justice McGregor's Report<br />
had to be accepted and accepting it had inevitable<br />
consequences in respect of the f inding of impropriety.<br />
The community rightly demand a high standard from the<br />
Ministers of the Government. The judgements on Ministers<br />
are more exacting and sometimes more harsh than the<br />
judgements which might be passed on those outside<br />
sphere of public life. If these high standards Were not<br />
upheld, the people's confidence in Government a<br />
confidence which is fundamental to Australian democracy<br />
would be undermined.<br />
The Government has an obligation to uphold them even<br />
though the cost can be and is in this instance, a high<br />
one. Senator Withers has been an energetic and able Minister<br />
and his services have been of immense value to the<br />
Government. It is with great regret that I have recommended<br />
to His Excellency, the Governor-General, that he should<br />
determine Senator Withers' appointment as Minister for<br />
Administrative Services.<br />
Senator Carrick has been appointed Vice-President of the<br />
Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the<br />
Senate. The Attorney-General, Senator Durack, has been<br />
appointed Minister for Administrative Services, and<br />
Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate.<br />
