    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The loss of those fire-fighters really shook you up a bit, didn't</p>
<p>   it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I have always felt that when a violent, untimely death...it's</p>
<p>   always sad, but when it happens to people who have put their lives</p>
<p>   on the line voluntarily for others there's a special heart-breaking</p>
<p>   factor, there's a special poignancy about it and I think all</p>
<p>   Australians feel that. And as I said yesterday, things associated</p>
<p>   with bushfires and the terror that they invoke is very deeply embedded</p>
<p>   in the Australian psyche and it has a particular sadness for me.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes it does. Is there anything the Federal Government can do? I</p>
<p>   see talk of a memorial to volunteers in Canberra or help for the</p>
<p>   families. What sort of things are you pursuing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're obviously willing, as a Federal Government, to do whatever</p>
<p>   we reasonably can in relation to the families affected by this tragedy.</p>
<p>   The question of having some kind of memorial for people who have</p>
<p>   lost their lives in this kind of voluntary service has been made.</p>
<p>   It was, in fact, made yesterday by Mr Beazley. I'm having a</p>
<p>   look at that. Clearly it's a nice idea. Of course, the most</p>
<p>   important thing is to ensure that every practical measure is taken</p>
<p>   to minimise the possibility of this kind of tragedy occurring in</p>
<p>   the future. Now, I'm not being critical in saying that, I'm</p>
<p>   just making an obvious comment and investigations are going on and</p>
<p>   I'm not going to pass any comment about what happened. It's</p>
<p>   a terribly dangerous business. And that, of course, is the point</p>
<p>   I made yesterday, that when people risk their lives in a purely</p>
<p>   voluntary capacity it's a big thing they do and it's the</p>
<p>   ultimate thing anybody can do for his or her community and that's</p>
<p>   why I thought it was a particularly sad event.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah, as I say, they really need to get the message too. On the</p>
<p>   edge of the summer this is going to really kick them in the guts.</p>
<p>   On the edge of a big summer the people are with them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they are and I just say as best I can to them, we owe you</p>
<p>   an enormous debt of gratitude. It is very risky. It's only</p>
<p>   the beginning of summer and it is just such a heart-rending event.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Also very disturbing, these letter bombs, particularly as they're</p>
<p>   targeting, well, they're targeting people who work for you,</p>
<p>   work for us, tax officials.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I</p>
<p>   suppose, is a modern day reality in every society. We've been</p>
<p>   refreshingly or relatively freer of it than most other societies</p>
<p>   and I hope that continues to be the case but unhinged human nature</p>
<p>   can become a very lethal weapon if it's, you know, is triggered</p>
<p>   off by particular events.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I suppose it means we're stuck with higher levels of security</p>
<p>   really, doesn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm afraid we are. It can be a nuisance but it's a price</p>
<p>   everybody should feel is worth paying because it can minimise the</p>
<p>   impact of this kind of behaviour. It can save lives, it can prevent</p>
<p>   serious injury and we have been remarkably free of this kind of</p>
<p>   thing. We've had our huge tragedies and mass murders we're</p>
<p>   all very conscious of but we have been fairly free of this kind</p>
<p>   of thing and I only hope it continues.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the banks, now they're delaying, most of them,</p>
<p>   well, they all are at this stage, not passing on that cut in official</p>
<p>   interest rates until next year. Some of them, it's reported,</p>
<p>   can make $250 million out of that. What's your reaction Â</p>
<p>   they should do it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't, I'm not sure that those figures would</p>
<p>   be completely accurate but it does indicate a point that I made</p>
<p>   last week and that is that we still need more competition in the</p>
<p>   banking system. I made that in the context of responding to questions</p>
<p>   about possible mergers of the four big banks. We have got more competition</p>
<p>   now than we had a few years ago, particularly in home lending and</p>
<p>   small business lending, and that's due to the entry of new</p>
<p>   players like Aussie Home Loans. We need still more competition,</p>
<p>   particularly in the small business area. But the good news about</p>
<p>   interest rates is that they are lower now than they've been</p>
<p>   for 30 years.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I can't understand. I talked to Aussie Home Loans, well, ten</p>
<p>   minutes after the announcement they'd decided their interest</p>
<p>   rates was coming down and was coming down from the next day. Now,</p>
<p>   I don't want to talk up Aussie Home Loans but why can they</p>
<p>   do it and the banks can't?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't really answer that question except to make the</p>
<p>   point that if people are unhappy with that Â and I can understand</p>
<p>   why they might be Â then that's all the more reason why</p>
<p>   we should push hard to have more competition.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>When you say more competition, you'd like to see more banks.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not saying whether or not a group of people should</p>
<p>   form a bank except to state the obvious and that is that if people</p>
<p>   want to get together and form a bank, providing they comply with</p>
<p>   the law and the prudential requirements and they safeguard the assets</p>
<p>   of their depositors, then good on them, we believe in that. I don't</p>
<p>   think we're going to see all that many more major banks. I</p>
<p>   don't think that's likely to happen. But what we've</p>
<p>   seen over the last few years is a dissolving of the divisions between</p>
<p>   banks and non-bank financial institutions. And we now have, really,</p>
<p>   the emergence of a generic group of organisations that provide a</p>
<p>   variety of financial services, some of them traditional banking</p>
<p>   services, others, all sorts of other non-traditional but nonetheless</p>
<p>   important financial services.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So you think these community banks are a good idea, if you win</p>
<p>   the war?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if they work...I mean, look, I'm for competition</p>
<p>   and I don't think it's the role of the Prime Minister</p>
<p>   to say who should or should not start a business in this country</p>
<p>   or who should or should not stay in business. And no government,</p>
<p>   no Prime Minister, can guarantee that everybody in business is going</p>
<p>   to remain there and make a profit and I can't ordain who ought</p>
<p>   to go into business. Our job is to establish a proper regulatory</p>
<p>   and prudential framework so that if people do establish the business</p>
<p>   of banking, those who deposit their funds with those institutions</p>
<p>   are well looked after. But it is obviously an expensive business</p>
<p>   and I do understand that maintaining an extensive branch network</p>
<p>   throughout a very vast country such as Australia is a very, very</p>
<p>   big undertaking. And many people go into the financial...offering</p>
<p>   financial services do want to pick the eyes out of those financial</p>
<p>   services to have the high volume, low concentration, as far as assets</p>
<p>   are concerned, activities but not undertake the economic responsibility</p>
<p>   of having an extensive branch network in a big country.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>There is an argument, though, is there, the banks have been a bit</p>
<p>   greedy? I mean, the profits are high and good on them, they're</p>
<p>   entitled to have high profits, but at the same time the fees are</p>
<p>   bordering on the unreasonable now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's a lot of anger about many of the fees and this</p>
<p>   is really why, I say again, the more competition we can have the</p>
<p>   better. And there's no doubt that home loan interest rates,</p>
<p>   in particular, are lower now because of competition. They would</p>
<p>   not be as low as they are now had it not been for the competition</p>
<p>   of entrants like Aussie Home Loans.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So how do we get other banking fees down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you continue to maintain the line in favour of more and more</p>
<p>   competition and that's one of the reasons why the Government</p>
<p>   is not budging on its attitude towards bank mergers.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You've firmed up on that, if anything, haven't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we were never going soft on it. People, for reasons I don't</p>
<p>   quite understand, chose to misread some remarks I made a little</p>
<p>   over a week ago when I spoke to the National Farmers' Federation.</p>
<p>   Our position has been, all along, that we would only agree to bank</p>
<p>   mergers if we were satisfied that there was a much higher level</p>
<p>   of competition than was obtaining about 18 months ago. Now, there</p>
<p>   has been some improvement over that period but there's still</p>
<p>   a long way to go.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think the banks are greedy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think they're very profitable and they're very</p>
<p>   successful and that is a good thing. Successful banks mean that</p>
<p>   you've got a stable banking system. And one of the things that</p>
<p>   has to be said about what's happened in the Asian Pacific region</p>
<p>   over the last two or three years is that bank failure or the failure</p>
<p>   of the prudential and regulatory systems of those countries is one</p>
<p>   of the reasons why they've been plunged into economic chaos.</p>
<p>   And one of the reasons why Australia has done a lot better than</p>
<p>   other countries is that we have a stable, well regulated, well run</p>
<p>   secure banking system. Now, that doesn't mean to say that I</p>
<p>   am happy with everything the banks have done and I can understand</p>
<p>   the anger of a lot of people about bank charges.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. We'll take a call, Christine, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello, Prime Minister Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Fine thank you, how are you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am very well thank you.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>That's good. I just wanted to say to you that everyone at</p>
<p>   the moment seems to be very unhappy with the banking system. My</p>
<p>   father has recently given up his job and he is a professional to</p>
<p>   go into small business and they got three months behind on their</p>
<p>   mortgage and when they asked for an extension the bank said: oh</p>
<p>   no, because you didn't fall into the hard case criteria. I</p>
<p>   was wondering if you could, you know, give me any comments on that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately I get a lot of those stories. Now, I don't</p>
<p>   know all of the circumstances in relation to your father and in</p>
<p>   fairness to the bank I am not going to sit in judgement without</p>
<p>   knowing all of those circumstances on what happened. But I do have</p>
<p>   to say as a Member of Parliament over the years I did receive, particularly</p>
<p>   during the recession of a few years ago, I did hear a lot of stories</p>
<p>   of how small business people somehow or other didn't seem to</p>
<p>   get the same treatment that larger customers got in relation to</p>
<p>   indulgence and extensions and so on. Now, this is an area where</p>
<p>   I have said often in discussion with senior banking people in this</p>
<p>   country, there's still work to be done whether it be in relation</p>
<p>   to changing practices or their whole public presentation of their</p>
<p>   treatment of small business. There still remains a view amongst</p>
<p>   a large number of men and women in the small business community</p>
<p>   in Australia that banks don't treat them as well as they might.</p>
<p>   Now, in some cases that is an unfair judgement. I know lots of people</p>
<p>   who have been kept alive by banks. On the other hand, I hear a lot</p>
<p>   of complaints. Now, as I say, I don't know enough about your</p>
<p>   dad's particular circumstances to sit in judgement but I am</p>
<p>   not surprised because the story you tell me is one that I do hear</p>
<p>   from time to time.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you Christine. We'll take a quick break and come back</p>
<p>   with more from the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[Commercial Break]</p>
<p>Paul, would you go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes. Good morning Mr Howard and Neil.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Paul.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd just like to ask you, you were saying that you would</p>
<p>   like to help the CFA volunteers. Why doesn't the Government</p>
<p>   purchase these fire bombers and have, say the insurance companies</p>
<p>   sponsor it because it'd save them a lot of payouts on home</p>
<p>   losses and such?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you talking about the aircraft Paul?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know enough about the science, if I can put</p>
<p>   it that way, and it is a science of fire-fighting to say off-hand</p>
<p>   whether they would be suitable for the sort of fires we have in</p>
<p>   Australia. Let me simply take that on board and reflect on it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We've certainly used them here a couple of times. </p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Kevin, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh good morning Neil. Thank you Mr Howard for the opportunity.</p>
<p>   In relation to the fire-fighters, I have been fire-fighting for</p>
<p>   20 years as a volunteer and I use the term loosely because we are</p>
<p>   professionally trained in what we do. On the thing of a memorial,</p>
<p>   the thing that strikes me after all the Ash Wednesday fires and</p>
<p>   everything else is that the biggest problem we seem to have is the</p>
<p>   cost of fire-fighting turn out gear and what have you. And I am</p>
<p>   just wondering whether federally it could be subsidised to bring</p>
<p>   the cost down so that our equipment and gear can be purchased at</p>
<p>   a realistic and cheaper price. It's getting to the stage where</p>
<p>   it becomes prohibitive to try and keep the gear in a relative cost</p>
<p>   free environment.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I wonder, Kevin, do you know if....do you pay tax on that gear?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>No, it's not, it's tax free, it's just it's</p>
<p>   still....the cost of keeping gear up-to-date and the high tech</p>
<p>   materials that are used these days are just, you know, almost off</p>
<p>   the planet. And for the CFA and other organisations, I mean, it's</p>
<p>   just so very expensive to give people proper protection and it's</p>
<p>   got to be budgeted for of course. Budgets are there and that's</p>
<p>   realistic and it's got to be realistically money that's</p>
<p>   spent.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, well what do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I guess that is something that I could discuss with the Victorian</p>
<p>   Government. I mean, I am not trying to evade the question but you'll</p>
<p>   appreciate that there are certain divisions of responsibility between</p>
<p>   federal and State government and naturally at a time like this people</p>
<p>   are anxious to help and be positive. On the other hand, there are</p>
<p>   some things that Federal Government should do and other things that</p>
<p>   State governments should do. And perhaps the best way I can, against</p>
<p>   that background, respond to Kevin, is it, is to have a talk with</p>
<p>   Mr Kennett.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. Thanks Kevin, thank you for calling. Mr Howard, the GST,</p>
<p>   speaking of Mr Kennett he said he was going to write you a letter</p>
<p>   about concerns he had. Has he done that yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but there are really no big rounds for concern because in a</p>
<p>   letter I wrote to Mr Kennett I anticipated the very thing that he</p>
<p>   was going to raise, that he raised. I indicated that because the</p>
<p>   final details of the agreement were still being...the formal</p>
<p>   details of the agreement in principle between the Federal Government</p>
<p>   and the States were still being settled, we couldn't go further</p>
<p>   than make the reference we did to that lock-in device in the first</p>
<p>   batch of legislation but there be specific reference to it in the</p>
<p>   second batch of legislation which is going to be introduced next</p>
<p>   year.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will that specific reference include a naming of the rate? Will</p>
<p>   it be set at 10% in the legislation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah. At the moment...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look it's going to be set. We're not going to muck around</p>
<p>   on this.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, but I wasn't sure whether it would be named actually at</p>
<p>   10%....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>.....[inaudible] legislation or whether it's a matter of</p>
<p>   [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh no no. You name it. You have to, otherwise you can't lawfully</p>
<p>   impose it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And that isn't done yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The lock in device, I mean the rate's been set but the lock</p>
<p>   in device has been referred to in a preamble of the legislation</p>
<p>   and then the next batch of legislation will actually describe you</p>
<p>   the 10% can't be increased without the consent of the States.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. Well business seems to be reacting to it as well, claiming</p>
<p>   that compliance costs will be higher than expected. Have they got</p>
<p>   a case?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we don't believe so Neil. It's inevitable that there'll</p>
<p>   be some news coverage of reaction to the detail of such a big package.</p>
<p>   We've had estimates done of compliance costs and we obviously</p>
<p>   hear what people have got to put to us, and any fine tuning that's</p>
<p>   needed to avoid unnecessary compliance costs we're obviously</p>
<p>   receptive to. I mean I want to make it very clear that our determination</p>
<p>   to get this package through intact does not mean that if somebody</p>
<p>   comes along with a sensible suggestion in relation to administration</p>
<p>   or compliance which doesn't alter the thrust of the legislation</p>
<p>   but is going to result in the thing working more efficiently and</p>
<p>   more effectively in a less costlier way we'd obviously agree</p>
<p>   to that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What are your estimates of the compliance costs?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't have a figure in my head overall but there's</p>
<p>   obviously some compliance costs but there's also a lot of savings</p>
<p>   involved in the process. A lot of businesses, for example, they</p>
<p>   may have to, for the first time, remit indirect tax collected but</p>
<p>   they also get enormous cash flow benefits because if they collect</p>
<p>   the tax and they're on a three monthly remittance arrangement,</p>
<p>   which every business under $20 million a year turnover will be entitled</p>
<p>   to be, then they get the use of that money interest free for an</p>
<p>   average of 66 days. And that is an enormous cash flow benefit to</p>
<p>   businesses.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You're talking about what degree of change there'd be</p>
<p>   in the legislation. Is there any change possible or likely out of</p>
<p>   the Senate inquiry or does it basically just go through a process</p>
<p>   and nothing changes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the problem with the Senate inquiry is that the Labor Party</p>
<p>   has said no matter what comes out of the inquiry it's going</p>
<p>   to vote our legislation down. It's now into this business of</p>
<p>   saying: well it might vote for some things but not vote for others.</p>
<p>   The problem with that, that opportunistic approach, is that it's</p>
<p>   an integrated package and the idea that you can put and take is</p>
<p>   ridiculous. I mean you can't have many of the benefits on the</p>
<p>   income tax and family benefits side unless you have the goods and</p>
<p>   services tax. You can't have the cash flow benefits I mentioned</p>
<p>   a moment ago, for business, without having a goods and services</p>
<p>   tax. So this idea that the Labor Party now appears to be groping</p>
<p>   with to sort of give the impression that it's not just an automatically</p>
<p>   negative opposition that some how or rather you can put and take.</p>
<p>   That's not on. This is not something you can really put and</p>
<p>   take on. It's an integrated package. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it possible that you could become sufficiently frustrated by</p>
<p>   this approach that we could have a double dissolution around this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I've just been through an election. Give us a break.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I know [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You don't want another election let me say.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No we don't. You know, I think if we're still going around</p>
<p>   in circles in the middle of next year you might be tempted.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Neil, that really is in the hands of the Labor Party and the</p>
<p>   Democrats in the Senate. I mean I have to say again, we had an election.</p>
<p>   I mean you and I, and Mr Beazley spent hour after hour almost it</p>
<p>   seems over a long period of time debating the merits of this thing.</p>
<p>   Then every Australian cast a vote and here we are exactly two months</p>
