    <content><![CDATA[<p>We invite Australians around the nation to participate wholeheartedly in next year's celebrations of the Centenary of Federation.      </p>
<p>In Canberra tomorrow we will join together formally to launch the Centenary Year and its national calendar of events.</p>
<p>Australia has come a long way since 1901, when the Federation Fathers laid the foundations for the birth of the Commonwealth of Australia. Six colonies uniting in Federation was a momentous step achieved by peaceful, democratic means.</p>
<p>In the past hundred years, Australia has established itself as one of the world's most successful and enduring democracies.</p>
<p>The Centenary is an opportunity to add further momentum to the Olympic spirit, and to reinforce the sense of pride, achievement and unity so enthusiastically embraced in Sydney.</p>
<p>As part of tomorrow's launch, the National Council for the Centenary of Federation will release a program highlighting the main activities of the Centenary Year.</p>
<p>Events and celebrations will be held around the nation throughout 2001. The National Council has devised a program to reach Australians everywhere, and to encourage them to reflect on the past, take pride in the present and look to the future with confidence.</p>
<p>It is to be an inclusive year. It will involve people from all cultures and all sections of our community and acknowledge the contributions over a century of people, both known and nameless.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that as well as remembering our history, we should be using this significant anniversary to look to the future.</p>
<p>We commend the National Council's central theme for the year, "Australia: It's what we make it".</p>
<p>The commitment, courage and vision that founded the Federation will be essential in steering the nation's course for the future.</p>
<p>Let us all take pride in our Centenary.</p>
