I </p>

I-t viil be seen t hat certain very important changes have<br />
been made. In order to secure more concentration of discussion and<br />
expedition of decision on policy'matters, the size of the Cabinet is<br />
being reduced to 12. I have decided to adopt something like the<br />
United Kingdom system of having-a Cabinet which includes certain<br />
Ministers and of having other Ministers, not in Cabinet, who will be<br />
responsible for the administration of their ow'n departments. Minis<br />
not in Cabinet will be invited to attend and to participate whenever<br />
matters affecting their own department are under Cabinet consideratic<br />
I will also have the right to invite to a Cabinet discussion any<br />
non-Ci-inet Minister who has ' special knowledge or experience on the<br />
partic-lar matter under consideration.<br />
In order to render this new system fully effective, I<br />
will invite Parliament to alter the Ministers of State ict to provide<br />
for t:: c additional ministers. Mr. Cramer and Mr. Roberton will,<br />
therefore, not be sworn as Ministers until the statutory amendment<br />
has been made. The practice of having , a Defence Preparations Committee<br />
will be continued. On this Committee there will continue to be<br />
present ( interalia) the three Service Ministers and the three<br />
Chiefs of Staff. The principal departmental re-organisation is to be found<br />
in the creation, for urgent and obvious purposes, of a new Department<br />
of Trade which will not only embrace the trade aspects of the present<br />
Department of Commerce and Agriculture, including the work of the<br />
statotory marketing boards for certain primary industries, but will<br />
also be equipped, to ensure that. bo. th inward and outward trade are<br />
dealt with comprehensively. The new department will take over from<br />
Trade and Customs the administration of the Tariff Board and the<br />
Central Import Licensing Committee. The normal administration of<br />
import licensing',. subject to the rules laid down in the new departmen<br />
will rem'ain with Customs.<br />
The Dep. artment of Trade and Customs will become the<br />
Department of Customs and Excise, a title which will more accurately<br />
describe its functions under the new organisation.<br />
In order that the. Department of Trade may not, under thesej<br />
circumstances, be overloaded and so that it may direct its major<br />
attention to the stimulation of trade, a new Department of Primary<br />
Industry is being created. It will, subject to the activities of<br />
the Department of Trcde in respect of mcrketing boards, deal with the<br />
Commonwealth'd activities in relation to primary industries,<br />
including sugar, cotton and wine, which have hitherto been in the<br />
Department of Trade and Customs. It will also embrace such matters<br />
as the tractor bounty and the sulphur bounty, fisheries and whaling.<br />
It will have transferred to it from. the Department of the Interior,<br />
war service land settlement. There will be some other re-allocations<br />
of function as between departments, details of which will be announce<br />
shortly. These changes necessarily involve an additional Minister.<br />
I have also thought it undesirable that any one minister should<br />
administer two Service departments, since the interests of these<br />
departments are not always identical. To do this, requires another<br />
additional minister. These considerations hove led to the conclusion<br />
that, while it would be completely unvrkable to have a single Cabinet<br />
of 22 Ministers, there is no reason vihy there should not be two<br />
additional ministers outside of the Cabinet, particularly as the<br />
Cabinet proper is being reduced to 12, and should certainly be no<br />
larger if the greatest possible efficiency is to be achieved.<br />
I sincerely regret'the loss of good colleagues who have fin<br />
records of public service, but I have felt that the circumstances of<br />
today require very wide reconstruction, the introduction of relatively<br />
new Members of Parliament who can contribute fresh experience and / 1 </p>
