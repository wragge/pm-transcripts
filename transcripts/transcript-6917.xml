SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE THIRD CHINA-AUSTRALIA SENIOR EXECUTIVE FORUM<br />
BEIJING 20 MAY 1986<br />
PREMIER ZHAO<br />
DISTINGUISHED PARTICIPANTS<br />
THIS THIRD MEETING OF THE CHINA-AUSTRALIA SENIOR EXECUTIVE<br />
FORUM IS A FURTHER INDICATION OF THE'GROWING STRENGTH OF THE<br />
COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THE<br />
FORUM WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESS<br />
CONTACT, FOR EXCHANGING INFORMATION ON HOW BUSINESS IS DONE<br />
IN BOTH COUNTRIES, AND FOR EXPLORING COMMERCIAL JOINT VENTURE<br />
PROSPECTS IN CHINA AND AUSTRALIA. YOUR SUCCESS IN THESE<br />
ENDEAVOURS WILL BRING OUR NATIONS CLOSER TOGETHER AND WILL<br />
STRENGTHEN THE FRIENDSHIP THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BETWEEN US.<br />
I FULLY ENDORSE AND APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS, AND I WISH YOU<br />
EVERY SUCCESS.<br />
MUCH HAS ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED IN ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN<br />
OUR TWO COUNTRIES AND I WILL BE REVIEWING THIS IN MY REMARKS,<br />
NATURALLY, WHEN THE PROSPECTS ARE SO EXCITING AND THE REWARDS,<br />
BOTH COMMERCIAL AND SOCIAL, SO PROMISING, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE<br />
IMPATIENCE.<br />
HOWEVER, I BELIEVE IT HAS TO BE REMEMBERED AT ALL TIMES THAT<br />
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD IS A STRUCTURE THAT WILL ENDURE<br />
AND PROSPER INTO THE 21ST CENTURY AND BEYOND. . GOVERNMENT AND<br />
BUSINESS NEED TO BRING TO THIS TASK A LONG VIEW AND A<br />
PREPAREDNESS TO LOOK FURTHER THAN NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR<br />
FOR RESULTS. </p>
<p>OCCASIONALLY, WE WILL BE FRUSTRATED, SOMETIMES BECAUSE<br />
RESULTS ARE SLOW IN COMING AND SOMETIMES BECAUSE IT IS JUST<br />
NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES TO REACH EARLY<br />
AGREEMENT ON SOME PROJECTS.<br />
WE ARE INVOLVED IN A COMPLEX LEARNING PROCESS IN ECONOMIC<br />
RELATIONSHIPS AND IT WILL TAKE US TIME TO ACHIEVE ALL THE<br />
POTENTIAL. I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL SUCCEED<br />
IN THE END, NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS WHICH HAVE BEEN<br />
MADE AND ARE BEING MADE BY REPRESENTATIVES OF COMMERCIAL<br />
INSTITUTIONS OF BOTH OUR COUNTRIES.<br />
THE FRUSTRATIONS I HAVE REFERRED TO IN NO WAY DIMINISH THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE ARE DOING, THE ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH<br />
WE APPROACH THE TASK OR THE PROSPECT OF A VERY LONG, MUTUALLY<br />
BENEFICIAL AND FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP AT ALL LEVELS POLITICAL,<br />
SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND COMMERCIAL.<br />
BOTH OUR ECONOMIES HAVE GROWN STRONGLY IN RECENT YEARS.<br />
PREMIER ZHAO ZIYANG'S IMPORTANT STATEMENT TO THE NATIONAL<br />
PEOPLE'S CONGRESS EARLIER THIS YEAR DESCRIBED THOROUGHLY<br />
CHINA'S PROGRESS. ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CHINA HAS BEEN<br />
EXCEPTIONALLY RAPID IN THE PERIOD OF THE SIXTH FIVE YEAR PLAN,<br />
REACHING ABOUT 12 PER CENT PER ANNUM OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.<br />
IN 1985 ALONE, INVESTMENT ROSE BY A STAGGERING 54 PER CENT AND<br />
INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT BY 18 PER CENT, AUSTRALIA'S GROWTH OVER THE<br />
LAST THREE YEARS HAS AVERAGED ABOUT 5 PER CENT PER ANNUM,<br />
MAKING AUSTRALIA ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING OF THE WESTERN<br />
INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES.<br />
THESE ARE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS. THEY ARE A TESTIMONY TO<br />
THE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMIC POLICIES OF OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS.<br />
BUT IN PURSUING OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES WE BOTH HAVE ENCOUNTERED<br />
BOTTLENECKS IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. </p>
<p>CHINA'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN STRETCHED<br />
TO THE LIMIT, CONSTRAINING BOTH THE PACE AND BREADTH OF<br />
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.<br />
CHINA'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS HAS ALSO EXERTED A RESTRAINING<br />
INFLUENCE.<br />
THE INVESTMENT BOOM IN CHINA HAS CALLED FORTH MASSIVE<br />
INCREASES IN IMPORTS OF FINISHED IRON AND STEEL, TOGETHER<br />
WITH OTHER IMPORTED INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS. CHINA'S RAPID<br />
GROWTH IN CONSUMER DEMAND HAS PLACED FURTHER STRAINS ON ITS<br />
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS. HIGH CONSUMER DEMAND ALSO HAS CONTRIBUTED<br />
TO A 9 PER CENT INCREASE IN THE RETAIL PRICE INDEX IN 1985,<br />
COMPARED WITH ABOUT 2 PER CENT THE PREVIOUS YEAR,<br />
AUSTRALIA, TOO, HAS FACED IMBALANCES IN ITS EXTERNAL ACCOUNTS<br />
WHICH ARE PLACING LIMITS ON SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN DOMESTIC<br />
DEMAND, AT LEAST FOR A TIME,<br />
THE LARGEST PART OF AUSTRALIA'S DIFFICULTY WAS THE MANIFEST<br />
UNCOMPETITIVENESS OF IMPORTANT AREAS OF OUR ECONOMY IN THE<br />
PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DEPRECIATION OF OUR CURRENCY IN 1985.<br />
RESTORATION OF OUR COMPETITIVENESS OVER THE PAST YEAR HAS<br />
UNLEASHED POWERFUL FORCES TO REDRESS THOSE IMBALANCES,<br />
HOWEVER, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED A FURTHER DIFFICULTY STEMMING<br />
FROM A SHARP DETERIORATION IN THE PRICES WHICH WE RECEIVE<br />
FOR OUR EXPORTS COMPARED TO WHAT WE PAY FOR IMPORTS, THIS<br />
IS A REFLECTION OF THE POOR PRICES AVAILABLE FOR MANY<br />
COMMODITIES ON WORLD MARKETS AND HAS BEEN EXACERBATED<br />
RECENTLY BY THE FALL IN CRUDE OIL PRICES. </p>
<p>OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMIC POLICY STANCE HAS NEEDED TO ADJUST TO<br />
FACILITATE AN IMPROVEMENT IN OUR CURRENT ACCOUNT POSITION.<br />
AFTER A PERIOD IN 1985 WHEN DEMAND WAS GROWING AT AN ANNUAL<br />
RATE OF SEVEN PER CENT, AUSTRALIA IS NOW MAKING THE TRANSITION<br />
TO A GROWTH RATE WHICH IS STILL H. IGH BY MOST STANDARDS, BUT<br />
MORE COMPATIBLE WITH SUSTAINED GROWTH, As PART OF THIS<br />
TRANSITION WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO EASE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES<br />
AND TO SECURE THE MAXIMUM FEASIBLE SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN<br />
OUR -COMPETITIVENESS,<br />
OUR EMPHASIS IS TO PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE MACRO-ECONOMIC<br />
ENVIRONMENT AND OTHERWISE TO SUPPORT OUR COMPETITIVENESS IN<br />
OPEN WORLD TRADE BY POLICIES TO CONTAIN THE GROWTH OF OUR<br />
DOMESTIC COSTS AND TO MAXIMISE PRODUCTIVITY. WE ESCHEW POLICY<br />
ALTERNATIVES WHICH WOULD PLACE ADDITIONAL ARTIFICIAL RESTRAINTS<br />
ON THE GROWTH OF TRADE.<br />
A SIMILAR TRANSITION IS TAKING PLACE IN CHINA. MEASURES<br />
ADOPTED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SINCE MID-1985 ARE<br />
BEGINNING TO LOWER OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TO EASE THE<br />
STRAINS ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND ON PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN KEY<br />
SECTORS. BUT CONSTRAINTS ON GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE<br />
IMPOSED IN THE NEAR FUTURE BY CHINA's BALANCE OF PAYMENTS<br />
DIFFICULTIES. THE PROSPECTS OF A SUBSTANTIAL OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN CHINA's<br />
EXPORTS HAVE ALSO BEEN DAMAGED BY THE OIL PRICE DROP, WHICH<br />
AFFECTS ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF CHINA'-S EXPORTS;' BY CONTINUED<br />
SLUGGISHNESS IN WORLD DEMAND FOR COMMODITIES AND POOR PRICES;.<br />
AN D BY SIGNS OF GROWING PROTECTIONISM AGAINST CHINA's TEXTILE,<br />
CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS.<br />
IT WAS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS<br />
OF THE SIXTH FIVE YEAR PLAN, AND THE BOTTLENECKS ENCOUNTERED<br />
ALONG THE WAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN, THAT THE SEVENTH<br />
FIVE YEAR PLAN WAS DEVELOPED. </p>
<p>THE SEVENTH PLAN, UNVEILED BY PREMIER ZHAO IN MARCH, IS ONE<br />
OF CONSOLIDATION ON THE SUCCESSES TO DATE AND OF THE<br />
CONTINUATION OF STRONG, BUT MORE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
IN THE ORDER OF 7 TO 8 PER CENT PER ANNUM, OVER THE LIFE<br />
OF THE PLAN GNP IS PROJECTED TO RISE BY 44 PER CENT, INVESTMENT<br />
BY 70 PER CENT AND IMPORTS BY 40 PER CENT,<br />
THERE IS CONCERN IN THE PLAN TO PROMOTE EXPORT GROWTH SO AS<br />
TO HELP EASE THE CONSTRAINTS ON PROGRESS IMPOSED BY THE<br />
PRESENT IMBALANCE IN CHINA'S EXTERNAL ACCOUNTS. UPGRADING<br />
CHINA'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS A MAJOR PRIORITY IN THE<br />
SEVENTH PLAN, TOGETHER WITH INCREASED DOMESTIC SUPPLY OF RAW<br />
MATERIALS ESPECIALLY IRON AND STEEL, THE PLAN ENVISAGES<br />
AN INCREASE OF AT LEAST 10 MILLION TONNES IN DOMESTIC OUTPUT<br />
OF STEEL PRODUCTS BY 1990, FROM THE 46,6 MILLION TONNES<br />
PRODUCED IN 1985. AUSTRALIA IS WELL PLACED TO SHARE IN THE<br />
ASSOCIATED GROWTH IN CHINESE DEMAND FOR STEEL-MAKING INPUTS.<br />
THE PLAN REQUIRES A SUBSTANTIAL BOOST IN CHINA'S DOMESTIC<br />
ENERGY SUPPLIES. AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORM ARE TO BE<br />
UNDERPINNED BY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCESSIBILITY AND QUALITY<br />
OF EDUCATION, TOGETHER WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE AND<br />
TECHNOLOGY IN CHINA,<br />
SIMILARLY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICY APPROACH<br />
WILL CONTINUE TO BE GROWTH-ORIENTED.<br />
THE STABLE MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS BEEN CREATED<br />
IN AUSTRALIA HAS ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING<br />
GROWTH-PROMOTING STRUCTURAL REFORMS. THESE REFORMS ARE<br />
DESIGNED TO TURN THE ORIENTATION OF BUSINESS IN AUSTRALIA<br />
AWAY FROM RELIANCE ON A SMALL, PROTECTED DOMESTIC MARKET AND<br />
TOWARDS THE MUCH LARGER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. </p>
<p>As ONE ELEMENT OF OUR APPROACH THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED<br />
PROGRAMS FOR GRADUALLY REDUCING PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRY, CONCENTRATING ESPECIALLY ON THE STEEL, MOTOR<br />
VEHICLES AND TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR INDUSTRIES.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE LIBERALISED OUR FINANCIAL MARKETS<br />
IN ORDER TO FACILITATE INVESTMENT AND TO HELP ENSURE THAT<br />
RESOURCES ARE CHANNELLED INTO THEIR MOST PRODUCTIVE USES.<br />
WE HAVE BEGUN TO REDUCE BUSINESS REGULATION, WE HAVE REMOVED<br />
THE EXPORT CONTROLS ON SOME PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND WE HAVE<br />
SIMPLIFIED AND RATIONALISED THE ADMINISTRATION OF SOME OF<br />
OUR FOREIGN INVESTME-NT GUIDELINES<br />
THE EMPHASIS OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL<br />
REFORM THROUGH GROWTH HAS PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
COOPERATION BETWEEN US IN TRADE AND INVESTMENT. SINCE 1983,<br />
TRADE BETWEEN CHINA AND AUSTRALIA NOT ONLY HAS GROWN STRONGLY,<br />
THERE HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING DIVERSIFICATION IN THE PRODUCTS<br />
BEING TRADED, AUSTRALIA NOW IS EXPORTING TO CHINA SIGNIFICANT<br />
AMOUNTS OF IRON AR4D STEEL AND RELATED RAW MATERIALS ( A$ 337M<br />
IN 1985, TREBLE THE AMOUNT IN 1983), NON-FERROUS METALS<br />
( A$ 145M IN 1985 COMPARED WITH JUST A$ 35m IN 1983) j AND WOOL,<br />
( A$ 282M IN 1985, ALMOST 2 TIMES THE 1983 LEVEL), TOGETHER<br />
WITH A GROWING RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES EMBODYING<br />
SPECIALIST TECHNOLOGY.<br />
CHINA's EXPORTS To AUSTRALIA ARE-MORE MODEST, BUT THERE ARE<br />
SIGNS OF AN INCREASINGLY VARIED RANGE OF MANUFACTURED CHINESE<br />
PRODUCTS GAINING A FOOTHOLD IN AUSTRALIAN MARKETS,. OUR TWO-.*<br />
WAY TRADE IS BEING FACILITATED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CLOSER<br />
FINANCIAL LINKS: THE BANK OF CHINA HAS NOW A BRANCH IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, AND A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN BANK OFFICES HAVE BEEN.<br />
SET UP IN CHINA, </p>
<p>COOPERATION BETWEEN CHINA AND AUSTRALIA ON THE INVESTMENT<br />
FRONT HAS BEEN GATHERING MOMENTUM WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT<br />
OF JOINT VENTURES IN CHINA IN SUCH DIVERSE INDUSTRIES AS<br />
WHITEGOODS, FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT, FOOD PROCESSING, SOAP<br />
MANUFACTURE, PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS AND OF COURSE, TEXTILES.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A RECIPROCAL INTEREST BY CHINA IN JOINT<br />
VENTURES IN AUSTRALIA, MOST NOTABLY IN NATURAL RESOURCE<br />
BASED INDUSTRIES. AND I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THE INCREASING<br />
CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND TOURISM BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
WITHIN OUR GENERAL EMPHASIS ON OPEN TRADING RELATIONSHIPS,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING THE<br />
BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA HAS A PARTICULAR<br />
FOCUS IN THE CHINA ACTION PLAN. THE PLAN SEEKS TO ENSURE<br />
THAT GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE TO<br />
FACILITATE TRADE AND INVESTMENT BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES;<br />
TO UNDERTAKE SPECIFIC MARKETING ACTIVITIES IN TARGETED<br />
PROVINCES AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN CHINA; AND TO ASSIST<br />
CHINA IN UNDERSTANDING AND WORKING THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET.<br />
THE FOUR SECTORAL INITIATIVES UNDER THE CHINA ACTION PLAN<br />
IN IRON AND STEEL, NON-FERROUS METALS, WOOL AND TRANSPORT<br />
HAVE PROVIDED THE BASIS FOR INCREASED TRADE, INVESTMENT<br />
AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CHINA AND AUSTRALIA.<br />
I HAVE MENTIONED ALREADY SOME OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE<br />
CHINA ACTION PLAN IN RELATION TO TRADE AND INVESTMENT.<br />
TECHNICAL COOPERATION ALSO HAS BEEN PROCEEDING WELL. THIS<br />
COOPERATION HAS BEEN AIMED AT PROVIDING NECESSARY EXPERTISE,<br />
WHERE REQUIRED, AND AT HELPING TO IDENTIFY EMERGING AREAS<br />
OF ECONOMIC COMPLEMENTARITY BETWEEN OUR TWO ECONOMIES. </p>
<p>THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF MISSIONS OR TECHNICAL EXCHANGES<br />
UNDER EACH OF THE SECTORAL INITIATIVES. To QUOTE BUT A FEW<br />
EXAMPLES: THE JOINT WORKING GROUP ESTABLISHED UNDER THE<br />
NON-FERROUS METALS INITIATIVE HAS PROPOSED AN EXCHANGE OF<br />
TECHNICAL MISSIONS STARTING WITH AN AUSTRALIAN MISSION TO<br />
CHINA NEXT MONTH; THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A SERIES OF TECHNICAL<br />
ASSESSMENT MISSIONS UNDER THE WOOL INITIATIVE THE MOST<br />
RECENT BEING THE JOINT TECHNICAL WORKSHOP HERE IN BEIJING<br />
IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR; AND AUSTRALIA HAS CONTRIBUTED BOTH<br />
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE FIRST STAGE<br />
FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR XIAMEN PORT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER<br />
COOPERATION OF THIS KIND,<br />
THE REFORMS WHICH HAVE BEEN SET IN TRAIN IN CHINA AND<br />
AUSTRALIA, AND THOSE ENVISAGED UNDER CHINA'S SEVENTH FIVE<br />
YEAR PLAN AND UNDER my GOVERNMENT'S INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING<br />
POLICIESi AUGUR WELL FOR OUR FUTURE TRADE AND INVESTMENT<br />
RELATIONSHIPS. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY<br />
AND ENDORSES THE SUGGESTION MADE By GENERAL-SECRETARY<br />
Hu YAOBANGJ, IN RECENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
PREMIER, JOHN BANNON, TO DOUBLE THE VOLUME OF SINo-AUSTRALIAN<br />
TRADE IN THE PERIOD OF THE SEVENTH FIVE YEAR PLAN.<br />
CHINA IS IN A GOOD POSITION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPECTED<br />
GROWTH IN TRADE INTO AUSTRALIA OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.<br />
THOUGH BOTH AUSTRALIA AND CHINA ACCEPT THAT. T. HERE IS LITTLE<br />
POINT IN SEEKING TO ACHIEVE ABSOLUTE BALANCE IN OUR BILATERAL<br />
TRADE, OF COURSE, WORK IS IN HAND TO HELP IDENTIFY PRODUCTS.<br />
SUITABLE FOR CHINA TO EXPORT TO THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET,<br />
TEXTILES, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR ARE OBVIOUS CANDIDATES.<br />
FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR INDUSTRIES WILL OCCUR OVER<br />
THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS A RESULT OF MECHANISMS ALREADY IN PLACE,<br />
WHEREBY MARKET GROWTH IS ALLOCATED TO IMPORTS. BEYOND 1988<br />
A NEW SECTORAL PLAN FOR THESE INDUSTRIES WILL OPERATE, AND THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED THAT THIS PLAN WILL INVOLVE FURTHER<br />
REDUCTIONS IN PROTECTION. </p>
<p>MODERNISATION OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES<br />
FOR THE EXPORT OF NEW PRODUCTS SUCH AS ELECTRONIC GOODS, OF<br />
WHICH AUSTRALIA IS A LARGE IMPORTER.<br />
THE SECTORAL PLAN IN PLACE FOR AUSTRALIA'S STEEL INDUSTRY* WILL<br />
EXPIRE IN 1988. IT HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL TO DATE IN<br />
ENHANCING THE PRODUCTIVITY AND INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY. THE GOVERNMENT<br />
WANTS TO SEE THIS COMPETITIVENESS MAINTAINED AND IMPROVED<br />
BEYOND 1938. WE WILL WANT TO SEE THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY<br />
BECOMING MORE EXPORT ORIENTED,, AND WE WILL BE AIMING TO PUT<br />
IN PLACE POLICIES WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT<br />
OF THAT OBJECTIVE.<br />
THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF AREAS IN WHICH THE CHINAAUSTRALIA<br />
BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP COULD BE STRENGTHENED<br />
IN THE COMING YEARS.<br />
CHINA* AND AUSTRALIA NEED ALSO TO WORK TOGETHER IN ADDRESSING<br />
COMMON PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD TRADING ENVIRONMENT. BOTH OUR<br />
COUNTRIES ARE NET ENERGY EXPORTERS AND WILL HAVE TO ADJUST<br />
TO LOWER WORLD OIL PRICES, IF THESE ARE SUSTAINED. THERE HAS<br />
BEEN AN ALARMING GROWTH IN PROTECTIONISM AROUND THE WORLD.<br />
AUSTRALIA, CHINA AND OTHER LIKE-MINDED COUNTRIES SHOULD WORK<br />
TOGETHER IN SECURING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF<br />
THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TRADE AND TARIFFS. AUSTRALIA SUPPORTS<br />
CHINA'S INTEREST IN-GATT MEMBERSHIP AND IS PLEASED TO PROVID E,<br />
UNDER A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SIGNED DURING THIS VISIT,<br />
A. CONSULTANT TO FACILITATE THIS IMPORTANT STEP. WE LOOK<br />
FORWARD TO JOINING WITH CHINA IN CONSTRUCTIVE PARTICIPATION<br />
IN A NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.<br />
THE AIM OF OUR Two GOVERNMENTS IS TO PROVIDE A STABLE AND<br />
SECURE FRAMEWORK OF LAW, POLICY AND PRINCIPLE WITHIN WHICH<br />
ENTERPRISES FROM CHINA AND AUSTRALIA CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE<br />
OF THE SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT<br />
BOTH WAYS, TO OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT. </p>
<p>THE TASK CHINA HAS SET ITSELF IS A HUGE ONE, MR PREMIER,<br />
WE IN AUSTRALIA WANT TO BE AS FULLY ASSOCIATED AS<br />
POSSIBLE WITH YOU IN THIS EXCITING ENDEAVOUR WHICH I<br />
SAY AGAIN IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY FOR<br />
CHINA ITSELF BUT FOR THE REGION AND THE REST OF THE WORLD,<br />
THERE WILL BE MANY FRUSTRATIONS AND TEMPORARY SETBACKS<br />
ALONG THE WAY, AUSTRALIA AND CHINA MUST NOT BE DETERRED<br />
FROM OUR SHARED GOALS BY SUCH TEMPORARY FRUSTRATIONS<br />
AND SETBACKS.<br />
FOR ITS PART, AUSTRALIA, A FIRM FRIEND OF CHINA IN THE<br />
WESTERN PACIFIC REGION, WILL BE WORKING WITH CHINA<br />
BOTH THROUGH TIMES OF DIFFICULTY AND WHEN THE STRATEGY<br />
OF REFORM IN OUR COUNTRIES IS REAPING ITS FULL REWARD, </p>
