NQ DATE<br />
M/ 91 4 June 1973<br />
WORLD ENVIRONT-11ENT DAY<br />
The following is the text of a statement to mark the<br />
first World Environment Day ( tomorrow, 5 June 1973) by the Prime<br />
Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, and sent<br />
to the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program:-<br />
" The annual celebration of a World Environment Day is an<br />
occasion to take stock of the effectiveness of the policies and<br />
programs instituted by the United N-ations and governments for the<br />
protection and improvement of the human environment.<br />
In associating Australia with the celebration of the first<br />
World Environment Day, one year after the Stockholm Conference on the<br />
Human Environment, I conf* my Government's support for the<br />
principles and declarafion of Stockholm and Australia's intention<br />
to " oursue international and dome-tic nolicies which are in full<br />
harmony with the results and achievements of the Stockholm Conference.<br />
My Government, conscious of the need for the Australian<br />
people to be protected against major hazards to the environment,<br />
has created three new Departments Environment and Conservation,<br />
Tourism and Recreation, and Urban and Regional Development, which, ./ 2 </p>
<p>in co-operation with other Australian Government agencies and the<br />
authorities in the Australian States, are working towards ensuring<br />
that Australians will continue to enjoy the nation's natural and<br />
cultural heritage. We have established a Task Force on the National Estate.<br />
The Task Force will advise the Australian Government on additional<br />
measures and policies for the preservation and enhancement of<br />
features such as historic buildings and towns, urban parks and<br />
scenic reserves and areas along the coastline. The Australian<br />
Parliament has established a Committee on the Environment and<br />
Conservation. We are developing an environmental impact statement<br />
procedure, the objective of which is to ensure that full account<br />
is taken of the environmental impact of all proposed devc-onrments.<br />
We expect that the implementation of this policy will be a most<br />
significant innovation in the orocess of government in Australia.<br />
The peoule of Australia and the Pacific area are currently<br />
faced by a serious threat to their environment from nuclear weaoons<br />
testing in the atmosohere. Principle 26 of the Stockholm Conference<br />
declared that ' man and his environment must be spared the effects<br />
of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction'.<br />
The Australian Government strongly endorses this princinle and our<br />
policy is directed towards ensuring th&amp; t present and succeeding<br />
generations will be spared the harmful consequences of contamination<br />
of the environment resulting from nuclar weapons testing. o../ 3 </p>
<p>Australia intends to play a positive and constructive role<br />
in the work of the Governing Council for Environmental Programs in<br />
keeping with the Council's responsibility as the major forum for<br />
continuing international discussion of environmental problems.<br />
It is of particular importance that priority attention be<br />
given to the conservation of wildlife which is so essential inter<br />
alia for the preservation of the ecological balance.<br />
Australia welcomes the drawing up of the Convention on<br />
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna<br />
and we have also recently announced that we intend to join the<br />
International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural<br />
Resources. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia,<br />
I wish the United Nations every succeeds in its efforts to develop<br />
effective practical measures of international co-operation for the<br />
preservation and enhancement of the environment." </p>
