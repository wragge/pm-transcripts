PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 23 February 1985<br />
The Prime Minister today announced he had accepted an<br />
invitation from the Rt Hon Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister<br />
of Canada, to address the Canadian National Economic<br />
Conference. The invitation is to deliver the keynote address on the first<br />
day of the Conference, which is to be held in Ottawa from<br />
March 22-23.<br />
Mr Hawke said he was delighted to be able to accept the<br />
invitation, which represents an international recognitjion of<br />
the considerable national economic achievements to whch all<br />
Australians had contributed in the past two years.<br />
" The invi tation, coming from Canada, one of the seven World<br />
Economic Summit nations, is a gratifying tribute to the<br />
success Australia has had in-turning our own economic<br />
performance around.<br />
" As well as an oppourtunity to share our experience with a longstanding<br />
friend, the invitation will provide another chance<br />
to put our economic achievements and potential into sharper<br />
focus before the international community.<br />
" This can only enhance our reputation and hopefully lead to<br />
greater interest in trade with, and investment in, Australia.<br />
The invitation will also provide an occasion to report on<br />
Australia's progress on the long-term restructuring of our<br />
economy designed to improve our international competitiveness.<br />
" The business and trade union leaders in Australia can properly<br />
regard this invitation as one which recognises their<br />
significant and unselfish contributions to Australia's<br />
economic recovery.<br />
" All Australians should feel honoured that when Canada sought<br />
a contribution from another country it turned first to Australia.<br />
" Canada and Australia have a history of strong and close<br />
economic, cultural and political ties.<br />
" Our economies are both large, and resource rich, and are in<br />
the consolidation phase of economic recovery. / 2<br />

" Both governmnents seek to promote durable economic recovery<br />
and thus recognise the need to improve the competitiveness<br />
of domestic producers and encourage investment.<br />
" Our two governments, moreover, particularly share a common<br />
determination to improve the co-operation between business,<br />
labour and other participants in the economy.<br />
" Clearly, Australia has been benefitted from this approach.<br />
" At the same time, it should be acknowledged that the<br />
policy is not risk-free.<br />
" The Conference will-bring together approximately 120<br />
representatives of Canadian business, l* abour, community<br />
groups and other interests with members of the Canadian<br />
A Federal Government.<br />
" Plenary sessions will be chaired by Prime Minister Mulroney."<br />
