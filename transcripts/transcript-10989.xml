  SUBJECTS: Republic referendum, Constitutional preamble.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  On the line Prime Minister John Howard. Prime Minister, good afternoon,</p>
<p>   thanks for your time.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Pleasure Mike.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  Mr Beazley says if a "yes" vote is successful Saturday and he's</p>
<p>   elected to Government two years from now he'll offer Australians a direct</p>
<p>   election model. Do you believe that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I don't. I don't believe it for a number of reasons, the most important</p>
<p>   is that he himself doesn't believe in a direct election.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  So why is he saying this then?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think he is saying it because the people who want a "yes"</p>
<p>   vote on Saturday are desperate to get as many people who support a direct</p>
<p>   election for the presidency to vote yes on Saturday. But once this particular</p>
<p>   republican model were to get up if it were to get up, and I hope it doesn't,</p>
<p>   but if it were to get up then there's no chance in my view that the supporters</p>
<p>   of the republic in both parties would then favour yet another ballot to</p>
<p>   allow for a direct election of the president. Because most of the people,</p>
<p>   like Mr Beazley and Mr Costello and many others who are in favour of the</p>
<p>   republican model on offer on Saturday are not in favour of a directly elected</p>
<p>   presidency. Because Mr Beazley himself at the Constitutional Convention</p>
<p>   supported essentially the model that is being put on Saturday. See people</p>
<p>   have got to be consistent otherwise you confuse people. I have been consistent,</p>
<p>   people may disagree with me, but I have always argued that we should stick</p>
<p>   with our present Constitution because it's safe and reliable and we know</p>
<p>   it works. And I'll cop the criticism for that position but at least people</p>
<p>   know where I stand. Now, Mr Beazley has said, yes, he wants a republic but</p>
<p>   he believes in the model being put up on Saturday but then if he.if that's</p>
<p>   successful he'll put it up again to test whether it's a directly elected</p>
<p>   presidency. Now, that's all about conning those people into voting for it</p>
<p>   and I think they'll see through that anyway. That's my view.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  I spoke to Meg Lees earlier today about the preamble. Now, Meg Lees and</p>
<p>   Aden Ridgeway are still strong supporters of the preamble that you created</p>
<p>   with Les Murray. The Labor Party at one stage were supporting it but now</p>
<p>   they're backing away from it, the theory being that it will fail and they</p>
<p>   don't want to be standing anywhere near it when it does.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that's not very principled if that is the case.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  Well that may be so. It's not very principled but that does seem like a</p>
<p>   likely scenario though doesn't it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't know. I don't take anything for granted in either proposal.</p>
<p>   I mean, my position is that I would like to see the republic defeated but</p>
<p>   I would like to see the preamble succeed. The great advantage of the preamble,</p>
<p>   and bear in mind all your listeners, a preamble is just a simple statement</p>
<p>   of basic values and beliefs. It doesn't have any legally binding effect</p>
<p>   and it talks about things like recognising the place of the aborigines as</p>
<p>   the first people of the nation. It talks about the sacrifice of people in</p>
<p>   war about the common values that bind us together as Australians. And one</p>
<p>   of my reasons for proposing the preamble was that here was an opportunity</p>
<p>   for people who have different views on the republic to come together to</p>
<p>   support something that is aspirational. You mention Senator Ridgeway and</p>
<p>   Senator Lees. They are both supporters of the republic. I am not. Yet the</p>
<p>   three of us together will support the preamble. And I think it will be a</p>
<p>   fine thing if we went to the celebration of the centenary of our nation</p>
<p>   with a statement of the aspirational values of the Australian community.</p>
<p>   And there's nothing in the preamble that should offend anybody. Sure, there</p>
<p>   is a reference to God. Now, there are some in the community who are offended</p>
<p>   by that but I think the great majority of Australians are perfectly happy</p>
<p>   to have it there. And then.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  May I say so just on that point that one of the objections is not so much</p>
<p>   based on whether or not you believe in God but because there should be a</p>
<p>   strong divide between church and state in this country.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, but that would be valid if this were to be used in the interpretation</p>
<p>   of the Constitution.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  So you don't think it will have any legal effect, that's the bottom line?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  There's a clause going into the Constitution saying that so there's no possibility</p>
<p>   at all that it can be used in the interpretation of the Constitution. But</p>
<p>   even so a mere statement that you have hope in God or trust in God is hardly</p>
<p>   likely to affect the interpretation of the Constitution. The notion of a</p>
<p>   separation of church and state is that we don't have an established religion</p>
<p>   in this country and we have never had that and there's always been a clear</p>
<p>   division between the church and state in that sense. And there are no restrictions</p>
<p>   put on people according to their religious belief, I mean, positions in</p>
<p>   the Australian community.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  On the subject of restrictions, you say whatever the outcome of Saturday's</p>
<p>   referendum it won't cause endless division within Liberal ranks. Clearly,</p>
<p>   there's quite a lot of passion, at least for some people associated with</p>
<p>   Saturday' referendum, it's unlikely that the disagreement that certain members</p>
<p>   of your party have are going to just disappear overnight. What will you</p>
<p>   be expecting of them?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't expect them to change their minds on the issue. That's unrealistic.</p>
<p>   But I do expect that I am sure this is what will occur, that once the referendum</p>
<p>   is over then there will no longer be a free vote on the issue. If people</p>
<p>   favour something well they'll argue for that in the Cabinet, if they are</p>
<p>   a Minister, or they'll argue for it in the party room if they are not a</p>
<p>   Minister and when the Government's policy is determined then everybody will</p>
<p>   be advised to support it. But there's nothing strange about that, that's</p>
<p>   how a party normally operates. I am not suggesting that somebody who has</p>
<p>   gone out and argued passionately for a particular position on the republic</p>
<p>   should then on Sunday because of a particular result say: well, I no longer</p>
<p>   believe that. I mean, you can't ask people. But what you can ask them, and</p>
<p>   I will ask them and I know they will, is to accept that the people have</p>
<p>   spoken.</p>
<p>  Now, whatever the result is, if it's a "yes" vote on Saturday</p>
<p>   even though I have campaigned against it I will say: well, I accept it because</p>
<p>   the people have spoken. And I have always said that I would transmit this</p>
<p>   issue to the Australian people. I will then as Prime Minister get on with</p>
<p>   implementing the verdict of the Australian people. So let there be no doubt</p>
<p>   that we will bow to the wishes of the people because they are our masters</p>
<p>   on this issue and whatever decision they take we are obliged to implement</p>
<p>   it. Now, if it's a "no" vote I have said before, and I'll repeat</p>
<p>   it, that I don't expect the issue will come back in a hurry. And I would</p>
<p>   expect that, however, that, and I am sure this is what will happen that</p>
<p>   people within the Liberal Party will put any point of view they want to</p>
<p>   inside the party in the forums of the party but we will have a united Government</p>
<p>   position as from Sunday. And everybody senior in the party accepts that.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  Finally, Prime Minister, would you like to make a prediction as to what</p>
<p>   the result will be on Saturday?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No. I do not predict what the result it. This is a very unusual, it's very</p>
<p>   interesting, it's a very different ballot. It's not like a normal political</p>
<p>   contest. I know people in the Liberal Party who share my philosophy who</p>
<p>   disagree with me on this and I know Labor voters who agree with me on it.</p>
<p>   So I find it very hard to predict. I do hope, however, going back to the</p>
<p>   preamble that people support the preamble because the preamble is something</p>
<p>   that can unite us all. It's a simple statement of common Australian values</p>
<p>   and I think it's a wonderful opportunity for republicans and anti-republicans</p>
<p>   alike to come together and support the preamble. But as to a prediction</p>
<p>   I am not going to do that because I really don't know what's going to happen.</p>
<p>   I hope the republic is defeated. I see no purpose in changing a system that</p>
<p>   has given us such stability for 100 years. I see no merit in that at all</p>
<p>   but I don't know what the outcome will be.</p>
<p>  JEFFRIES:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, thanks for your comments on the programme today.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You are very welcome.</p>
