    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Mr Mayor, for your very warm words of welcome;</p>
<p> to Warren Truss, David MacGibbon, Ian Macdonald, Mr Kingston, other</p>
<p> distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is my first visit, as the Mayor said, to Maryborough as Prime</p>
<p> Minister. Not my first visit to Maryborough but certainly the first</p>
<p> as Prime Minister. I'm in this area for a day and a half or a</p>
<p> little less than a day and a half - it seems a lot longer because</p>
<p> I've been to a lot of functions - and it's an exercise in</p>
<p> talking, in listening, in exchanging ideas, of getting some advice,</p>
<p> of receiving some criticism. In other words, it's an exercise</p>
<p> in accountable democracy.</p>
<p>I've said at the other gatherings I've addressed that I</p>
<p> personally enjoy public gatherings. I still believe they are the best</p>
<p> form of political dialogue that you can have in our community.</p>
<p>I won't beat about the bush. I'll acknowledge that for some</p>
<p> time there have been significant concerns in regional Australia. There</p>
<p> are many people who feel economically vulnerable and insecure because</p>
<p> of economic and social change. I also know that the level of unemployment</p>
<p> in this area, in the Wide Bay electorate which Warren represents,</p>
<p> is very high indeed, particularly youth unemployment.</p>
<p>Some of this has come about as a result of the impact of particular</p>
<p> decisions. A lot of it has come about as a consequence of fundamental</p>
<p> economic change. What I believe all people in political life should</p>
<p> do, whether they are in the Government or they're not in the</p>
<p> Government - and there's an equal obligation on all of us. There</p>
<p> is no such thing as a non-participating politician. We're all</p>
<p> on the same field and we're all playing according to the same</p>
<p> rules. And we all have responsibilities to address issues, to analyse</p>
<p> the reasons why problems have arisen and to try and put forward solutions.</p>
<p> We also have an obligation to be candid enough, when people speak</p>
<p> to us, not to pretend that there's an instant, immediate solution</p>
<p> when clearly there isn't. And I learnt very early in my political</p>
<p> life that there's no point in kidding people. There's no</p>
<p> point in going to some remote part of Australia and promising the</p>
<p> earth and saying that if only you were given the chance, you could</p>
<p> solve the problem, and then scuttling back to Canberra and writing</p>
<p> somebody a letter saying: well, I've had a look at it and unfortunately</p>
<p> I can't do that. There are people I've met over the last</p>
<p> few hours who I have said: look, I don't have any ready answer</p>
<p> to your particular problem. But there are others where I believe that</p>
<p> we can help.</p>
<p>Much of Australia's economic foundation, despite the difficulties</p>
<p> of people in many areas of our country, is very sound. I hope I can</p>
<p> say to you that, in terms of our inflation rate, our interest rate</p>
<p> structure, our budget position, our level of investment and despite</p>
<p> the difficulties of the Asian economic downturn, the Australian economy</p>
<p> overall is in quite good health. But, in a sense, that only makes</p>
<p> the difficulty of isolated, vulnerable communities even more acute</p>
<p> because you find it difficult to understand how it is, that if the</p>
<p> overall shape of the Australian economy is sound, why is it that you</p>
<p> will have, in particular areas of the country, why you will have difficulty.</p>
<p> And that, of course, is something that I'm very conscious of.</p>
<p>Now, what the Government has endeavoured to do over the last two and</p>
<p> a quarter years is to strengthen those foundations. And I say very</p>
<p> proudly, in defence of the Government's record, that we have</p>
<p> been able to get our interest rates to a level that they haven't</p>
<p> been at for 30 years. Not all of you will have got the benefit of</p>
<p> that. Some of you will have. And I say to you that if we hadn't</p>
<p> have got those interest rates down there would have been a lot more</p>
<p> small businesses going to the wall and a lot more people out of work</p>
<p> and a lot more difficulty and a lot more dislocation. And you can't</p>
<p> separate the reduction that we've achieved in interest rates</p>
<p> from some of the difficult decisions we've taken on the budget</p>
<p> front. Because you can't run a huge budget deficit. You can't</p>
<p> print money to finance a budget deficit. That's highly irresponsible</p>
<p> and highly inflationary and undermines the confidence of people in</p>
<p> their savings and the economic stability of the nation. Nobody can</p>
<p> do that with any sense of responsibility. So you have to see the link</p>
<p> between the decisions we've taken, some of which you haven't</p>
<p> liked, over the last two and a quarter years and the benefits that</p>
<p> we have derived from those decisions. And the same applies to further</p>
<p> change.</p>
<p>One of the paradoxes of Australia's position at the moment is</p>
<p> that some people are simultaneously unhappy, and I understand why,</p>
<p> with the pace of change but also they're unhappy that some things</p>
<p> they would like to see changed are not being changed quickly enough.</p>
<p> I mean one of my frustrations as Prime Minister, over the last two</p>
<p> and a quarter years, has been that the Government has not had the</p>
<p> numbers in the Senate to put through legislation that it regards as</p>
<p> important and the Australian people in March of 1996 regarded as important.</p>
<p> We're still, for example, discussing the issue of amending the</p>
<p> Native Title Act two and a quarter years after the election.</p>
<p> And the reason for that is that we haven't been able to get it</p>
<p> through the Labor Party and the Democrats and others in the Senate.</p>
<p> It took us much longer than we would have liked to have got other</p>
<p> necessary legislation through. But I have to live with that because</p>
<p> that was the verdict of the Australian people under our political</p>
<p> system. And no politician has a right to say to the electorate: well,</p>
<p> you were wrong - so far as the outcome of an election is concerned.</p>
<p> The obligation is that if you think the electorate's wrong is</p>
<p> to persuade them next time they vote, to vote in a different direction.</p>
<p> You have to accept the umpire's verdict.</p>
<p>And over the last two and a quarter years we have worked very hard</p>
<p> to stabilise and strengthen the fundamentals of our economy. And there</p>
<p> are other things we need to do in that area. And one of them is that</p>
<p> we do need to change our taxation system. Now, I know there are a</p>
<p> few people outside who disagree with that. I know the Labor Party</p>
<p> disagrees with changing our tax system. I know that other political</p>
<p> parties on the horizon are against changing our taxation system. Well,</p>
<p> I disagree with them because I think the present system's very</p>
<p> unfair. The present system does place a very heavy burden on our exporters</p>
<p> because the exporters bear input taxation which would not be there</p>
<p> if you had a different taxation system and it makes them less competitive</p>
<p> with other countries. The present taxation system's very lop-sided.</p>
<p> You don't pay any wholesale sales tax on a lot of items and you</p>
<p> pay very high rates on others. The present taxation system does contain</p>
<p> a lot of areas where, if you earn a bit more, you go on to a sharply</p>
<p> higher taxation level. And the present taxation system contains a</p>
<p> lot of disincentives for extra effort.</p>
<p>We think it's important for Australia's economic future</p>
<p> that it be changed. We're not interested in changing it just</p>
<p> for its own sake. We think it's good for Australia to change</p>
<p> it and that's why we're pressing ahead with that reform.</p>
<p> And I can assure you that when the details are released, which will</p>
<p> be soon, you will see that we are protecting the low income earners</p>
<p> in the Australian community. I do not intend, as Prime Minister, to</p>
<p> preside over a tax reform plan that will hurt the poor or the vulnerable.</p>
<p> But I do want to preside over a taxation plan that will deliver much</p>
<p> greater incentive to ordinary wage and salary earners and also a system</p>
<p> that will make it harder for people to cheat and also a system that</p>
<p> ensures that everybody makes their fair contribution.</p>
<p>I know that there's a lot of concern in a number of rural industries.</p>
<p> I've received a lot of representations from people representing</p>
<p> the pork industry in recent weeks. We gave a $10 million package late</p>
<p> in 1997 to help reconstruction of that industry. And after my meeting</p>
<p> with representatives of the industry at Toowoomba a few weeks ago</p>
<p> we agreed to a number of other plans that involved a further contribution</p>
<p> of between $9 million and $11 million.</p>
<p>Now, I've had some views put to me today, they were put to me</p>
<p> last night as well, to the effect that there needs to be a further</p>
<p> addressing of that issue. Some things we can do and some things we</p>
<p> can't do. Not speaking specifically of the pork industry but</p>
<p> speaking generally of how we react to industries that are in difficulty</p>
<p> in this country, there's one thing we mustn't do and that</p>
<p> is that we must never turn our back on world markets. And there is</p>
<p> no section of the Australian community that should be more conscious</p>
<p> of that than people who live in regional Australia.</p>
<p>I've just been to Walkers. Now, that magnificent company employs</p>
<p> 600 Australians here in Maryborough and it is a living example of</p>
<p> the critical importance of not turning our back on the world. Because</p>
<p> many of those carriages are sold to Asian countries. I was told about</p>
<p> the hoax they have to get a contract to sell into Hong Kong. I was</p>
<p> shown the cars that are going to be sold into Malaysia in time for</p>
<p> the Commonwealth Games. Now, that was a living example, a perfect</p>
<p> example, of how important it is to maintain those trading links with</p>
<p> the world. It was also living proof of the wisdom of our Government's</p>
<p> decision to give some help to some of the ailing Asian economies last</p>
<p> year. I know that was criticised. Some of our political opponents</p>
<p> criticised it and said we shouldn't have done it. The reason</p>
<p> we did it was because it was good for Australia. Because if you have</p>
<p> a weak, collapsing Malaysian economy or a weak, collapsing economy</p>
<p> in any part of the world that buys from us, they can't buy from</p>
<p> us any more. And to let economies go down the drain through some sort</p>
<p> of misplaced xenophobic view of the world is to cut off one's</p>
<p> nose to spite the face. We send 34 per cent of our total exports as</p>
<p> a country to Japan and Korea alone. Those two countries alone take</p>
<p> 34 per cent of Australia's exports. And if we don't nurture</p>
<p> those links and we don't make certain that those links are preserved</p>
<p> then we could lose them. And if we take arbitrary, foolish trade action</p>
<p> in relation to imports coming into Australia, then other countries</p>
<p> are going to retaliate and take action against our exports. And that</p>
<p> is a view that is very, very well understood by such bodies as the</p>
<p> representatives of the sugar industry and the representatives of the</p>
<p> beef industry.</p>
<p>Now, I just mention that to make the point that the answer to our</p>
<p> problems is not to turn inwards, is not to say: well, stop the world,</p>
<p> I want to get off. You can't do that. The world won't allow</p>
<p> you to do it and Australia last of all countries and regional Australia</p>
<p> which is really the backbone of our primary production exporting potential.</p>
<p> It is the last part of Australia that should adopt that kind of attitude.</p>
<p> Because so much of what we send abroad comes from rural and regional</p>
<p> Australia. And I know the pain and the frustration, I understand the</p>
<p> pain and frustration of farmers. Australia has the most efficient</p>
<p> farmers in the world and all the while those farmers are fighting</p>
<p> corrupt world markets. But the way to fight corrupt world markets</p>
<p> is to keep trying to prize them open. It is not to say to other countries</p>
<p> that we no longer want your imports because if you say we no longer</p>
<p> want your imports they will say we no longer want your exports and</p>
<p> we end up being a very, very big loser, as a consequence of that.</p>
<p>We are going through a time of transition. And it is very important</p>
<p> at a time like this that we try and get a balance between preserving</p>
<p> what is good about our past, but also recognising that we have to</p>
<p> make changes if we are to secure our future. And there is much about</p>
<p> Australia's past of which I am, and I know everybody in this</p>
<p> hall today is very proud, the fact that we have the most authentic</p>
<p> participatory democracy in the world. There aren't many countries</p>
<p> in the world where you can have this sort of activity. You get a few</p>
<p> heckles, you get a few boos, you get a few placards. That's fair</p>
<p> enough, that's part of the process. It goes with the territory</p>
<p> as the saying is. But at least we can do it. And we can do it in a</p>
<p> frank, equal way and that's very much part of Australia's</p>
<p> egalitarian past. And I want to hang on to that. I don't want</p>
<p> any of that changed. If anything, we need to reclaim a bit more of</p>
<p> that because it's one of the things that we do very well and</p>
<p> this method of political exchange is infinitely better than the rather</p>
<p> more antiseptic methods that we find increasingly we use.</p>
<p>There are other things about our past that we need to hang on to and</p>
<p> we should never change things just for the sake of changing. As you</p>
<p> know I've been, all my political life, a very strong supporter</p>
<p> of the Australian flag. Now I'm a supporter of the Australian</p>
<p> flag because I think it represents our history and our being and I</p>
<p> see absolutely no reason to change it and that's why the Government</p>
<p> when it came into office passed the amendment to the Flag Act so it</p>
<p> couldn't be changed without every Australian having a say at</p>
<p> a referendum. And if they want to change it in the future through</p>
<p> that process, well that's fair enough.</p>
<p>But those sorts of things you should preserve and value and you should</p>
<p> never denigrate or be ashamed of. But equally there are other things</p>
<p> that do have to change because the world in which we live is now different.</p>
<p> We've tried to change our industrial relations system. We set</p>
<p> out to make changes on the Australian waterfront. We were criticised.</p>
<p> Not everything we wanted to achieve was achieved. But I can say an</p>
<p> enormous amount was. And people who once again who live in rural Australia</p>
<p> will know the benefits of a more efficient waterfront. And many of</p>
<p> you will know the pain and anguish of your produce being held up on</p>
<p> the wharves and after you've worked your butt off through a difficult</p>
<p> season to see it held up at the wharves is just adding insult to injury</p>
<p> and pain. We set out to do that and that has to change. We can't</p>
<p> live with an industrial relations system that was developed before</p>
<p> World War I.</p>
<p>And so it is that we are living in a world where, whether we like</p>
<p> it or not, what we do is judged by investors in other parts of the</p>
<p> world and we have to ensure that this country is always receptive</p>
<p> to overseas investment. I know that some of you think that foreign</p>
<p> investment, that some of it is a waste of time. Could I say to you</p>
<p> that no country that has developed a standard of living that Australia</p>
<p> has developed with a population of 18 million can sustain that standard</p>
<p> of living without having a large amount of foreign investment. Because</p>
<p> we don't generate enough savings of our own to do all the things</p>
<p> we want to do. So you have essentially a choice. You either accept</p>
<p> a lower standard of living because you don't have enough savings</p>
<p> to produce the investment for that standard of living. Or you take</p>
<p> the savings of foreigners. You borrow from overseas. You take their</p>
<p> investment. And walk down the main street of any city or town in Australia</p>
<p> and you will see some evidence where foreign companies have invested</p>
<p> in this place, and have employed Australians. You see names like Toyota</p>
<p> and Ford.</p>
<p>You think, as I mentioned this morning, of the birth of the motor</p>
<p> manufacturing industry in Australia, where legend has it that Ben</p>
<p> Chifley went around Australian companies and said: "Would you</p>
<p> start a motor manufacturing industry in Australia?" And they</p>
<p> said: no we won't. So he invited General Motors and Ford, Chrysler</p>
<p> to come into this country.</p>
<p>And if you look at the history of the United States the railroads</p>
<p> there were built in the 19th Century essentially with British and</p>
<p> German capital. And if you look at the history of any country that</p>
<p> has developed the way that Australia has. Now you need rules, you</p>
<p> need requirements, once again as I mentioned this morning at Hervey</p>
<p> Bay I can remember almost twenty years ago when I was Treasurer having</p>
<p> some arguments with a well known former premier of Queensland about</p>
<p> the level of Australian equity in some coal mines in Queensland. And</p>
<p> I took the view that if you could get 50 per cent Australian equity</p>
<p> you should. Our foreign investment is always operated on that basis</p>
<p> that if the Australian equity is there, it ought to be injected. But</p>
<p> there are many cases there's no Australian equity available so</p>
<p> you've got a choice between taking the investment and the jobs</p>
<p> that come with it, or once again cutting off the nose to spite the</p>
<p> face.</p>
<p>Now, I mention these things, ladies and gentlemen, because they're</p>
<p> issues that are being debated now in a way that perhaps they haven't</p>
<p> been debated before. And I think it's very important that when</p>
<p> propositioned to put forward that sound all right on the surface that</p>
<p> they be questioned and challenged. And the value of what is now being</p>
<p> done be preserved. That doesn't mean to say that everything that</p>
<p> is now happening is correct. That doesn't mean to say that you</p>
<p> can't make changes. It doesn't mean to say that in the process</p>
<p> of my going around our country and listening to the views of people</p>
<p> there aren't insights and attitudes that shouldn't be taken</p>
<p> account of and I certainly do. Politics, successful state-craft is</p>
<p> very much a process of keeping your own goals and moving towards them</p>
<p> but understanding that you need to take people with you. And also</p>
<p> accepting as you go on that journey that from time to time you'll</p>
<p> get things wrong and you need to alter them. And I've never been</p>
<p> reluctant in my political career to admit error. I've never been</p>
<p> reluctant in my political career to acknowledge that it isn't</p>
<p> possible to do something different. But I've also been very determined</p>
<p> in my political career to hang on to those things that I think are</p>
<p> important. Those values that I regard as important and to maintain</p>
<p> the momentum towards policy reform that I regard as important.</p>
<p>A number of people have spoken to me this morning about the importance</p>
<p> of small business in Maryborough. They've spoken to me about</p>
<p> the despair in relation to the young people in this community. There</p>
<p> was one single thing I wished one could do overnight but I can't.</p>
<p> And nobody can. And that is to remove the blithe of youth unemployment.</p>
<p> You can patiently work at it. You can produce, as we have, a new apprenticeship</p>
<p> and training system that has produced 200,000 traineeships and apprenticeships</p>
<p> over the last 2 years. You can make other changes to the climate</p>
<p> to small business. Changes to capital gains tax. Changes to provisional</p>
<p> tax. Reductions in interest rates, all of which make circumstances</p>
<p> a little more congenial for small business. You can try and further</p>
<p> reform the unfair dismissal laws, which I know have discouraged many</p>
<p> small business men and women around Australia from employing people.</p>
<p> And unfortunately our changes in that department are held up in the</p>
<p> Senate by the opposition parties and it's one of the pieces of</p>
<p> legislation that I have felt an immense frustration about over the</p>
<p> last two and a quarter years.</p>
<p>We can improve the operation of our labour placement system. And we've</p>
<p> introduced a new system called the job network in that department.</p>
<p> But ladies and gentlemen, I don't pretend that I've come</p>
<p> here today with every solution to every problem that you have. I don't</p>
<p> think that will ever be possible. I acknowledge the fact that people</p>
<p> feel a sense of detachment from what they see as some elements of</p>
<p> mainstream politics in Australia. And when that happens I think people</p>
<p> who are part of that mainstream have got to examine why and where</p>
<p> they see the concerns of people justified you respond and where they</p>
<p> are not you put your own case with increased vigour and increased</p>
<p> determination and that is what I have been doing over the last few</p>
<p> days and what I intend to do over the weeks and months ahead. I think</p>
<p> people do feel a sense of, I think anger at the confrontational style</p>
<p> of some of Australian politics. I don't know that they're</p>
<p> always impressed every night when they turn on their television with</p>
<p> point scoring arguments. I think they would rather see something different.</p>
<p> I think that is a message I have got very directly and very loudly</p>
<p> from the Australian community.</p>
<p>Now I can assure you, despite what you see on your televisions, that</p>
<p> there is a lot of legislation that goes through Parliament in a very</p>
<p> uneventful way. And in lightness, in harmony and sweetness. It's</p>
<p> true. No. No, there are many other things where that happens. But</p>
<p> that's not terribly good copy. I mean when everybody says: hey</p>
<p> that's not very exciting television, but if you have a little</p>
<p> bit of a verbal exchange it is. But the point I simply make is that</p>
<p> sometimes the perception of that can be very negative. And perception</p>
<p> is very important. It's very important to the way people form</p>
<p> their views.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say just two other things</p>
<p> I wouldn't want to let the opportunity go by without very, very</p>
<p> warmly commending to you the tremendous job that the your local Member,</p>
<p> Warren Truss, does as the Federal Member for Wide Bay. Warren is one</p>
<p> of my Minister's. He's done a very, very energetic job as</p>
<p> a Minister, and a very, very enthusiastic job as a representative</p>
<p> of the Wide Bay electorate. And he has been somebody who's been</p>
<p> very vocal in the Party Room in relation to many of the issues that</p>
<p> effect rural and regional Australia. And I am very delighted also</p>
<p> to have on the stage my two Liberal Party Senate colleagues from Queensland</p>
<p> of Ian Macdonald and David MacGibbon.</p>
<p>Finally, friends can I just say again how valuable I find this kind</p>
<p> of encounter. It's an opportunity for you to say what you think.</p>
<p> I've enjoyed moving around talking to people in the last two</p>
<p> meetings doing that and generally exchanging views.</p>
<p>I think every issue affecting Australia's future should be debated</p>
<p> fully and should be debated intelligently and people who seek to represent</p>
<p> their constituents in parliament, all of us, no matter what interest</p>
<p> we represent should be fully accountable for what we say. There's</p>
<p> no such thing, as I said earlier, as a non-political politician. Everybody</p>
<p> is a player upon the political stage who seeks to represent the people</p>
<p> of Australia in the parliaments of Australia. And all of those players</p>
<p> are accountable to the same rules. They must explain, they must defend,</p>
<p> they must advocate, they must justify. Where they deceive and mislead</p>
<p> they should be identified and criticised and where they disappoint</p>
<p> expectations they should enjoy and expect to receive the same judgement.</p>
<p>I always live by that rule myself. I've always tried to be accountable</p>
<p> and I've always accepted the verdict of the people. And I do</p>
<p> thank all of you for coming along today. I've enjoyed very much</p>
<p> meeting you. I wish the city of Maryborough a great success in the</p>
<p> future of its delightful community. I must say it's a stunning</p>
<p> Queensland winter day and I'm told that the weather here over</p>
<p> the past few days has been approaching that of the Federal Capital,</p>
<p> which is quite unusual for Queensland even in the middle of winter.</p>
<p> But it's been very great, it's been very nice being amongst</p>
<p> you and I wish you all well. Thank you very much.</p>
