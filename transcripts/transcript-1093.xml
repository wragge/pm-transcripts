ANNUAL MEETING OF CONVOCATION OF UNIVERSITY OF<br />
1" iELIBOURNE MELBOURNE 9TH APRIL, 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies,<br />
Mr. Warden, Mr. Chancellor and Ladies and Gentlemen t<br />
I have one or two grievances that I will expose to<br />
you in a moment but before I do i want to tell you that I have had<br />
two singularly happy experiences here on this platform tonight.<br />
The first was that the Registrar, the successor of the famous<br />
J* P* Bainbridge who was Registrar in my time, held up a massive<br />
minute book, leaned as he might be entitled to lean in a university<br />
with an engineering school ( LaugZhter) on this thing, and it<br />
colla psed. I am really here under false colours, under a complete<br />
misapprehension. I had a letter from the Judge some time ago, no<br />
doubt written with his usual lucidity, but I thought all I was<br />
being asked to do was to come here to the annual meeting of<br />
Convocation which in my time was made up of about twenty-five<br />
people and to have a few reminiscent remarks to make you know,<br />
of a civil kind but I had no idea that this old friend of mine<br />
was a sadist un il three days ago I discovered and the print<br />
was put in front of me that I was to come here and make what I<br />
believe is loosely described nowadays as an oration the address<br />
and I even saw the subject for the first time ( Laughter) : The<br />
Commonwealth and University 3iucation.<br />
Now, really, I am old and experienced but for a<br />
long time now I have confined myself to doing one o1l these<br />
formidable jobs a year. I once fell in for two. They take a long<br />
time. For weeks and weeks and weeks you put in a few hours each<br />
weekend because you are supposed to produce something wortchy of<br />
the occasion, And I woke up to it ( I won't blame anybody else<br />
three days ago, and naturally for the next two days, I had Cabinet<br />
sitting until after midnight, and so whatever rough ideas I have<br />
assembled have been assembled not with the midnight oil but with<br />
post-midnight oil over a period of two days instead of two months.<br />
And therefore you will understand my position. I have had no time<br />
to prepare myself properly. I prayed for laryngitis ( Laughter)<br />
but although the prayers of a righteous man avail mucli my prayers<br />
were not answered. My prayers failed so all I could do was to<br />
say, " Well, I will do my best" and I took a vow and the vow was:<br />
Never again. So I warn all of you. There are no new pronouncements<br />
to be made by me tonight. There is no controversy to<br />
conduct. There are no new statistics, you will be glad to know<br />
because the statistics of the university's growth and problems In<br />
the last few years are now all too well known. And, of course,<br />
on top of that I speak witha little hesitation, Mr, E! arden,<br />
because in my own city I have recently been described as a<br />
Johnny-come-lately in the educational field ( Laughter) and<br />
therefore, of course, I must speak with immense reserve in<br />
preserving my amateur status.<br />
Now, Sir, therefore what I have to say to you will<br />
be discursive, it will be occasional. It wontt I confess be<br />
thoroughly or properly thought out and above ail things, f say<br />
to those of you who are academically disposed, it will be unfit<br />
for academic consumption. 0* .00 ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Now the Commonwealth has, in my own time, as the Judge<br />
has reminded you, entered into the universities field in a great<br />
and growing way, not, may I repeat, because of constitutional<br />
responsibility but because the considerable financial power of the<br />
Commonwealth has been allied to an acute consciousness on our part<br />
of the need to save the universities from retrogression and perhaps<br />
disaster. This is worth remembering.<br />
The first grant ever made as a grant to the States for<br />
universities was made in my own time in, I think, 1950 or 1951 and<br />
it was a very modest amount of money, something a little over Li1M.<br />
and that was done and then we established the Mlurray Committee<br />
later on and when the Murray Committee's report came in, recommending<br />
an enormous increase in Commonwealth subventions, we accepted<br />
ito I confess that I engaged in a certain amount of low cunning.<br />
I circulated the report the night before the Cabinet Meeting and<br />
kept the Cabinet sitting all morning, afternoon and night so that<br />
we might end up with a complete acceptance of the recommendations<br />
and we accepted them, and that of course, as you have been reminded,<br />
led on to the universities commission, the problem of the teaching<br />
hospitals, the Martin Committee on Tertiary Education. This has<br />
been the most astonishing development, though I say it mysel f, and it<br />
has all been based on the proposition that what I agree is t e<br />
considerable constitutional and practical financial powrer of the<br />
Commonwealth has been allied to a genuine consciousness of the<br />
needs of the universities.<br />
Now I said " considerable financial power%. May I emphasise<br />
to you this does not mean inexhaustible financial resources. If I<br />
have one complaint that I can make about my academic friends, it is<br />
that some of themnrot all of them but some of them, appear to think<br />
that there is no limit to what can be produced financially. I've<br />
even known one or two like that at Canberra, The skY is the limit,<br />
they think. The sky isn't the limit. Considerable financial power<br />
doesn't mean inexhaustible financial resources and that is not to<br />
be forgotten. May I remind you admitting as I do that; with<br />
uniform tax, with the ultimate control of the Commonwealth over the<br />
borrowing programmes, we have vis-a-vis the States very great and<br />
perhaps commanding financial powers that the task of a Commonwealth<br />
Government in economic and financial policy is to preserve<br />
a good economic climate in which. growth can proceed from a stable<br />
foundation within the limits of its constitutional authority and<br />
this, of course, presents classical problems.<br />
There are those who may be heard to say, Ililell, why worry<br />
about inflation? Itts only growth that counts. But wise men want<br />
to have stability and growth. They realise that the stability of<br />
the currency to the extent that it isn't affected by authg'rities<br />
beyond the control of Parliament or by the terms of international<br />
trade, which we don't control, or by seasonal conditions at home<br />
which we don't control, is much affected by monetary control through<br />
the banking structure and through the Commonwealth Budget',<br />
Now, Sir, in a Commonwealth Budget let's have a look<br />
at it on the expenditure side. Nobody need suppose that I am going<br />
to expose the grisly secrets of the next Commonwealth Budget<br />
because I don't know them so I have no temptation to disclose them,<br />
We haven't got within months of that yet. But on the expenditure<br />
side let's face up to it we have an enormously increased defence<br />
expenditure enormously increased. We have incessant demands for<br />
social benelits. We have great cash outlays on developmental<br />
projects in Australia and we have increased outgoings to make up<br />
the shortfall in loan raisings when the loan market weakens. Could I<br />
elaborate one or two of these dreary-sounding items because they<br />
are important? e / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Developmental projects. You will always find, and<br />
perhaps you will within the membership of Convocation somebody<br />
who will dispose of the whole problem by saying, " Jiell, of course,<br />
the Commonwealth ought to conduct the whole of the works programme<br />
out of loan money." Oh, how much I agree, if he could produce the<br />
loan money. These theoretical approaches are not worth much.<br />
Why is it that a Commonwealth Government, mine or any<br />
other finds itself finding capital works provision out of revenue,<br />
out ol the taxpayer? Not because it wants to but because in spite<br />
of the enormous expansion of the loan market over recent years, it<br />
just can't produce the amount of money that is needed, and we In<br />
the Commonwealth have for years sought to solve this problem by<br />
saying that when we had a loan programme and we raised loans on<br />
the market, the States would receive the whole of the proceeds we<br />
would take none for Commonwealth works, and that is why we spend<br />
Commonwealth revenue on Commonwealth works,<br />
And in the second place, of course, we said and I<br />
think very properly, though without obligation if there is a<br />
shortfall on the loan market, if we have approved of a loan works<br />
programme for the States of œ C240M. and the loan market produces<br />
œ 080M, we accept the responsibility for finding the balance out<br />
of the Budget. Now these are very important matters, and if the loan<br />
market weakens, it follows that there is a greater burden on the<br />
Commonwealth Budget. These things have to be borne in mind when<br />
you are confronting the problem of education, because after all<br />
this may sound heretical there must be reasonable limits to<br />
taxation, because if taxation is carried too far, it can inhibit<br />
investment and growth. and above all that we know, in the brbad,<br />
all of us, instructed or uninstructed by the critics, that in a<br />
time of boom when there is overfull employment when there are<br />
all these things, a surplus Budget may very well be called for as<br />
a controlling factor, and in a time of recession, a deficit<br />
Budget with its injection of credit into the system may very well<br />
be called for.<br />
Now, Sir, I am sorry to be so tiresome on this matter,<br />
but all these things have to be watched. They all have a bearing<br />
on university programmes which, I repeat, can't be unlimited if<br />
every other factor is under observation and control. Therefore<br />
looking back on it, I am really delighted to think how, with all<br />
these principles in mind we have been able to find increasing<br />
millions and scores of millions for university activity, But I<br />
do beg of those who think that there is no financial consideration<br />
tq be allowed into academic studies to bear in mind some of these<br />
elementary truths about public finance,<br />
Now, Sir, as I have just said, the recognition of this<br />
truth hasn't so far involved any substantial modification of our<br />
siqpport for university projects, but it would be an error to<br />
suppose that demand can always be satisfied. This is something<br />
that I do want you to have in your minds.<br />
Nowv of * course so far I have been ta~ Jng a bout finance<br />
but there are other elements no less important perhaps in the<br />
long university view much more important, and they are these.<br />
First of all, to preserve and improve the essential<br />
nature of a university. This needs to be thought about much more<br />
than it is by some people who have the advantage of not being </p>
<p>0 0 </p>
<p>Johnny-come-latelies. The essential nature of a university to<br />
maintain and improve the standards of teaching, of research and<br />
of intellectual leadership these are the things for which a great<br />
university like our own stands and must stand.<br />
Now, Sir, what is the essential nature of a university?<br />
Well, in the first place, if I may repeat a truism, we must aim at<br />
some balance between the natural science and the humanities. I<br />
repeat that. It needs to be repeated quite a lot. We have had an<br />
awful lot of science in this century a tremendous amount of<br />
technology in this century. The only way in which the world has<br />
failed in this century is by man's inhumanity to man and therefore<br />
the humanities which give breadth of outlook, a wisdom of judgment,<br />
are of the mos supreme importance. There it is the balance.<br />
In the second place, Sir, I think that the essential<br />
nature of a university involves a high standard of attainment<br />
leading to a widespread recognition of the degrees that the<br />
university awards, a high standard of attainment, You might fill<br />
Australia with a hundred universities, but if their standards were<br />
low, their degrees iwould fall into contempt. It is vital to me<br />
and to you in this university, that the degrees of the Melbourne<br />
university should continue to rate high all around the world, and<br />
that means a high standard of attainment.<br />
We must have post-graduate and research work on a scale<br />
which will improve the peaks of attainment. I don't talk about the<br />
ordinary average level, but every university, every seat of learning<br />
that has distinction has achieved it not infrequently by having<br />
men of immense distinction, women of immense distinction in the<br />
various faculties. These are the peaks. We are not to produce a<br />
flat graph, are we? We are to produce one interrupted by peaks of<br />
distinction. We must have work of that kind which excites the<br />
minds of undergraduates, It is not a matter of Just going<br />
through as a matter of routine, " Well I have to read this and I<br />
have to read that. If I can get 5O-odd per cent., Itm through." 1<br />
This is terrible. The best kind of undergraduate ought to be a<br />
man or woman whose mind is excited, and it will be excited if the<br />
student is working under or in direct or remote contact with people<br />
of an immense standard in the post-graduate and research field,<br />
And, of course, on top of that, a university must serve<br />
to generate much-needed teachers to satisfy the future demands of<br />
the students who are to come. Now this is not so much a definition<br />
of the essential nature of a university. I don't profess that it<br />
is at all exhaustive, but what I have mentioned refers to those<br />
matters which achieved will make a great university and which not<br />
achieved will make a poor one.<br />
I think, Sir, that it is unwise for these reasons to<br />
treat as universities institutions which fall short of these<br />
requirements. That is why we have, as a government, in the light<br />
of the Martin Report offered to support institutes of colleges<br />
up. to a tertiary diploma standard. It is just because we believe<br />
that you can't lower the standards, that you can't have things passing<br />
as universities which are not universities according to the defined<br />
structure that we ought to move carefully in this field.<br />
Encouragingly, the more tertiary education we have in<br />
the country the better, but it doesn't need, of necessity to be<br />
university education in the sense in which we understand It.<br />
It's a great pity for people to think there is no middle course<br />
that it is either a university or it's nothing. There is plenty<br />
of room as the Martin Committee pointed out, to have tertiary<br />
institutions which will give most valuable instruction in the<br />
tertiary field but which will not be universities. .1. </p>
<p>r<br />
Now, Sir Leslie Martin, in this last report a very<br />
long, carefully considered, valuable report, with some aspects<br />
of' which we haventt found ourselves able to agree has had<br />
much to say of supreme value in this field, and having erposed<br />
the problem more or less as I tried to expose it to you myself,<br />
the Report says " To assist in this development, it is suggested<br />
that each State Government should establish an<br />
Institute of Colleges."<br />
and then later on " The function.... should to consider<br />
general plans for the expansion of technical and other<br />
tertiary noa-unjyersitXy education...."~<br />
and then later on it says, looking forward very appropriately-<br />
" At some appropriate time in the fut ure, the<br />
Institute might arrange for more advanced training<br />
leading to degrees such as Bachelor of Technology..."<br />
" The Committee's proposals envisage a greater<br />
diversity of tertiary education in Australia but any<br />
hope of achieving this diversity would be nullified if<br />
Colleges attempted to transform themselves into<br />
Universities, The responsibilities of Colleges to the<br />
community are of a different kind."<br />
Now that is worth thinking about. It is very easy for<br />
somebody who is a little parti pris on some matter to say, " Oh,<br />
yes, but there is such-and-such a technical school and it does<br />
very good work." Of course it does. The R. M. I. T. does splendid<br />
work and has tertiary elements in its courses, I don't deny<br />
its I admire it. But the thing that is brought to our notice<br />
here is that a university is one thing. It has some essential<br />
structure which we are not to forget. And that a non-university<br />
which may still be in the tertiary field can be an entirely<br />
different thing. And the Committee, I thought with great wisdom,<br />
promoted ways and means by which somebody having done some course,<br />
a diploma course in one of these colleges in the institutes of<br />
colleges, might pass from there to a university in orde4' to take<br />
a higher course and take a degree.<br />
Now, we are not going to settle this problem in a few<br />
minutes. All I am asking you to do is to think about it, and I<br />
start my thinking with two premises one, I want to see an<br />
enormous extension in this country of genuine post-secondary<br />
education. I will define tertiary education in that sense<br />
genuine post-secondary education leading to higher skills of the<br />
kind that people need both in industry and in business and in<br />
other aspects of life, and I don't want to see the great name,<br />
university, pulled do'wm, I donft want to see its standards low~ ered,<br />
I don't want to see bodies or institutions called universities<br />
which are not according to the structure that I have described.<br />
And believe me, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a matter of<br />
intellectual snobbery. We have lived too long for that kind of<br />
nonsense, There can be no room for intellectual snobbery. There<br />
can be room only for a high intellectual standard which ought to<br />
be maintained. And that brings me to the last thing I wanted to say to<br />
you and that is that the greatest problem of the lot today is the<br />
problem of standards, maintaining the standards, not letting them </p>
<p>6-<br />
slip away, not letting them be swept away in the flood of numbers,<br />
These are hard words I know in some sense, but standards are all,<br />
If in fifty years' time the standard is no higher than it is now,<br />
then it will be worthless, Standards ought to rise and rise all<br />
the time. I had something to say about this when I was invited by<br />
the University of New South Wales to do the Wallace ! Jurth Memorial<br />
Lecture. Do you mind if I quote you a few lines of what I then<br />
said? I had longer to consider them than I have had this time.<br />
I quoted first of all the Robbins Report in England which said<br />
this " Throughout our Report we have assumed as an<br />
axiom that courses of higher education should be available<br />
for all those who are qualified by ability and attainment<br />
to pursue them and who wish to do so. What type of<br />
education they should get and in what kind of institution<br />
are questions we consider later on; and the criterion by<br />
which capacity is to be judged is clearly a question on<br />
which there may be a variety of opinions. But, on the<br />
general principle as we have stated it, we hope there will<br />
be little dispute."<br />
That's, what the Robbins Committee had to say. And then when I was<br />
discutsing thiis in the U-urth Lecture, I went on to say this and<br />
again I trespass on your patience<br />
" Far too many people in our country when they<br />
urge the creation of a new university, seem ? o think of<br />
it in terms of financial provision by governments, and the<br />
bricks and mortar of practical construction, Yet the fact<br />
is that the value of a university depends primarily upon<br />
the standard of its research and its teaching. In short,<br />
the greatest problem about the expansion of universities,<br />
or the creation of a new one, is that of securing a highlyqualified<br />
staff. Any man who has any share of responsibility<br />
for the general national balance and prosperity cannot<br />
fail to be conscious of such problems as the pressure of<br />
numbers on financial resources, the pressure of numbers and<br />
demand on physical resources, because these things form<br />
part of the economic problems of the nation. They have to<br />
be considered. They can produce some limitation upon the<br />
financial provision by governments. But, in the ultimate,<br />
the capacity to establish new universities or to expand<br />
old ones is primarily to be judged by reference to the<br />
maintenance of the quality of research and teaching and<br />
the value of the degrees to be awarded.<br />
" Greshamts Law, if I may say so, applies to<br />
universities and their degrees just as much as it did and<br />
does to money, In short, we have occurring under our eyes<br />
a tremendous explosion in the number of those who seek<br />
tertiary education. Our task is to see that they get it<br />
without lowering the standards.<br />
" Unless we can, by one means or another,<br />
encourage and produce an increasing percentage of<br />
university students who aim at higher degrees and<br />
research work, then we will do a gross disservice to<br />
university education by concentrating our minds<br />
exclusively on numbers and on money." G. a/ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Now these were my views, and as I stated them I don't<br />
alter them but I was interested recently to read the journal of<br />
the Royal Society of Arts, an eminently respectable body in<br />
London of which, for some reason quite obscure to me, I am<br />
Fellow. Sir John Lockwood of the University of London was speaking<br />
on tertiary education in the Cantor Lectures. Now I will quote<br />
a little of him, if you don't mind<br />
" I want first of all to discuss one of the<br />
major issues which is being faced by many countries<br />
of the world. Social theory in most places insists on<br />
the essential importance of equal educational opportunity<br />
for all young people. The consequential logic of such<br />
theory seems then to require that consumer demadai s the<br />
basis of educational provision, For entry to higher<br />
education, tHis principle would appear to mean that anyone<br />
who has satisfactorily completed a particular period of<br />
secondar education should have the right of access to<br />
some form of higher education.<br />
American State Universities have largely<br />
followed this principle, and in areas where the American<br />
practice has been developed, for example in the<br />
Philippines<br />
( I speak subject to the distinguished representative here from<br />
Mindanao) " admissions and policies of universities are much the<br />
same. The effect on a unlversity of indiscriminate<br />
expansion to satisfy demand is incalculable. Educational<br />
inflation may be socially desirable as a theoretical<br />
proposition but it has an insidious capacitvto do damage<br />
to the currency value of education."<br />
Now I quote that. it's worth thinking about. Without adopting<br />
it all, it is very well worth thinking about. And he went on<br />
to say, a few minutes later in his lecture<br />
" To the economist......'"<br />
Well, I don't venture to speak for economists. They speak for<br />
themselves with an infinite variety of tongues, but<br />
" To the economist, a full ' open-door' policy<br />
to meet ' consumer demand' is well-nigh stupid folly.<br />
It is the very negation of wise and constructlve planning.<br />
It takes no real account of the needs of the economy.<br />
It is based on the self-interest of the consumer, and,<br />
if uncontrolled, leads to an output of graduates who may<br />
not find employment within their own speciallst competence.<br />
India was an unfortunate example of this situation."<br />
And I should add to that without adopting all those<br />
words that it is fascinating to read of what has been going on<br />
in the African countries about universities, about the conferences<br />
they have had and about the way in which they are trying to<br />
channel university education in such a way as to serve the<br />
overall interests of the nation. Very interesting; very<br />
difficult; much too complex to be gone into tonight.<br />
The Chairman of the meeting at which Sir John Lockwood<br />
made this speech was Mr. Walter James, who is the Editor of the<br />
" Times" Education Supplement, and he said something quite<br />
provocative and worth thinking about. He said </p>
<p>-8<br />
" There is one point I shiould like to put to<br />
him ( that is, the speaker) about the relation between<br />
a rapidly-expanding university system and schools in<br />
the developed countries. ( A good deal has been said about<br />
the under-developed countries.) Does he think that you<br />
can expand the universities rapidly without bringing<br />
a certain diminution of standards in the schools? I<br />
have heard from a number of English people who have gone<br />
to America the assertion that the sort of people we<br />
should find teaching in sixth form in this country are,<br />
in general, not teaching in American schools at all,<br />
but in American universities."<br />
Now this may be an exaggerated statement I don't know but<br />
it does serve as do the last two citations that I made, to<br />
bring back into our minds the kind of problem that we have.<br />
Not a problem to be ignored, not a problem to be dismissed by<br />
being told that you are old-fashioned or something of the<br />
kind I'm not a bit old-fashioned on this business. My life<br />
has devoted itself for years to the development of education<br />
in this country. Nothing old-fashioned about it, It's mostly<br />
been brand new. But I think we would do badly by getting<br />
into our minds the idea that all you want is a lot of money<br />
and all you want is a lot of builder's labourers and building<br />
material and you can create a university. We must get that<br />
out of our minds, You could have the finest buildings in the world<br />
with all the greatest facilities in the world and have a thirdrate<br />
university. You could have the most shocking buildings<br />
and a great university. It depends entirely on the people<br />
inside and how they look at it and the people who teach and<br />
the people who investigate and the people who work, and the<br />
great object of modern statesmanship is to reconcile the two<br />
things to have the best people, the keenest people? the<br />
most enthusiastic people doing research, doing teaching, 7<br />
giv-ing leadership to their students, have them all in tha<br />
sense and combine with them buildings in which they will be<br />
proud to work and live and surroundings which will give them<br />
happy memories in future years.<br />
