28 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MIKE CARTLON RADIO 2BL<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
CARLTON: A year ago this Sunday, March the second, John Howard was celebrating his rise to<br />
the Prime Ministership and Australia's first Coalition Government since 1983. So a<br />
year on for and against, how has he done and what more is there to do. The Prime<br />
Minister joins me across the table here this afternoon. Good afternoon.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good afternoon, Mike, very nice to be with you.<br />
CARLTON: Thank you. Are you comfortable and relaxed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes.<br />
CARLTON: It's your phrase. Is Australia more comfortable and relaxed under a year of your<br />
Government and if so discuss?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I believe it is. I don't think there is the level of personal vitriol in politics that<br />
there was before. There's a more civil interchange between the Prime Minister and the<br />
Leader of the Opposition than you used to obtain before. </p>
<p>CARLTON: But that's you two, are the rest of us relaxed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think that tends to have an influence. Look, not everybody is happy, not<br />
everybody agrees with what I've done. But I do think we have taken some of the<br />
spleen out of public debate.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Was that important to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes it was important to me because I thought the Australian community had got well<br />
and truly fed up with the ritualistic eye-gouging of politics and it did want, as part of<br />
the change that's only one of the elements, did want a rather more civil exchange and<br />
they did really want a situation where every so often the Government and the<br />
Opposition might actually agree. I mean, I acknowledge the fact that the other day<br />
Kim Beazley said he wholeheartedly agreed with our policy on immunisation and I<br />
thank him for that. And I have tried in different ways to do that in relation to the<br />
Labor Party to include them and him in the processes and not this, sort of, winner<br />
takes all attitude. Now we still have huge differences and I have no starry-eyed view<br />
that the Labor Party is going to rise in unison and cheer what I've done.<br />
CARLTON: No they're not.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They're not, of course. But I do believe that a bit more civility helps. We are seen as<br />
being less influenced by minority groups and that is what the public wanted. It was<br />
one of the reasons for the support we won in many parts of the country. So I think the<br />
answer is yes, but I will have my detractors and dissenters.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
No, surely not.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Indeed. </p>
<p>CARLTON: Indeed. All right. You pride yourself that you're an ordinary man. Some people<br />
criticise you for it, but you pride yourself in that, that you are in touch with ordinary<br />
Australians. I mean, are they in touch with you what are their concerns now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they still feel a sense of insecurity. Their lives have changed dramatically. They<br />
worry about a friture for their families, they worry about the basic important things like<br />
paying their mortgage, their children getting jobs, their children doing well at school,<br />
there being good education options.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
But they don't care who's on the CASA Board for instance.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No they don't really, no. No they don't care all that much about that, no, no, no. The<br />
people who follow those things are the people who follow politics intensely and you've<br />
always got to separate what the public sees as Canberra games from things that really<br />
concern them. The most important thing the Government did last week, by far, and<br />
the thing that the community out there was most interested in was our decision on<br />
immunisation. That was far more important than many of the things that perhaps got<br />
more air play and more the preoccupation of Canberra watchers but the Australian<br />
public was more interested in immunisation.<br />
CARLTON: Right, yeah. Right in this first year you've got some big ticket achievements. Gun<br />
control, of course, industrial relations reform, the partial sale of Telstra. I'd like to<br />
take some broad headings if I can though.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Sure.<br />
CARLTON: The economy, in better shape than you expected or had a right to expect?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The economy, I said months ago after I became Prime Minister, I said the economy<br />
was more than good in parts we inherited, it had pretty strong growth, it had very<br />
high unemployment and we had a big balance of payments problem. But the economy<br />
now is stronger than what it was, in many respects, a year ago. Now I'm not claiming<br />
all of the credit for that. I don't think any government can claim all of the credit for </p>
<p>good things in the economy any more than it can be blamed for everything that goes<br />
wrong. But it is fundamentally sound, it's growing quite strongly and the omens this<br />
year for the economy are a lot better than they were six months ago. Now there's still<br />
a lot of pain in the small business community and I understand that.<br />
CARLTON: Do you, because they're very critical of you. Just the other day and that yellow<br />
pages... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm not surprised at that because a lot of people in the small business community are<br />
still doing it hard. They haven't got the benefit of the interest rate falls quite as rapidly<br />
as they might have.<br />
CARLTON: So you haven't done much for them so far have you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well a lot of the things that we have done for them are only now beginning to take<br />
effect. The industrial relations laws, the removal of the unfair dismissal laws they are<br />
only just now coming into operation. A big part of it only starts on the 12th of March.<br />
So I say to them I understand your concerns, I know why you are still unhappy, you've<br />
reason to be unhappy but please be a little patient...<br />
CARLTON:<br />
" Trust me": he cried.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, be patient and allow what we're doing to take effect. I mean, the first of July<br />
will see this very big change to the capital gains tax law that help people who sell their<br />
businesses invest in other businesses up to $ 5 million without paying capital gains tax.<br />
Now that is a huge taxation incentive. That doesn't start until the first of July so we<br />
do need more time for those things to take effect.<br />
CARLTON: Okay. The critical problem you face is unemployment, particularly youth<br />
unemployment, you'll be judged on that at the election won't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's up to the Australian people to decide what they judge us on... </p>
<p>CARLTON: But they will, you know they will.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
but it is very important and we are trying to tackle it in a whole variety of ways. The<br />
industrial relations laws will help again, but they only started, in part on the first of<br />
January, and in full on the 12th of March. We have to say give a bit more time for<br />
those changes to work.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Right. Labor had its big programmes, spent billions which basically had the effect of<br />
removing the unemployed from one column of statistics to another. But you've done<br />
no better have you? The statistics are the same, the unemployed are still there.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we've only been in office for a year...<br />
CARLTON: That's a third of your time in Government.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they had 13 years, we've had one. I think it is a bit rich when you've been in<br />
power for 13 years and you took unemployment to 11% and you left the next crowd<br />
with eight and a half to say how outrageous after eleven and a half months that you<br />
haven't fixed the problem. I mean, it will take time. I'm not going to set some kind of<br />
particular target by a particular year. I promise the public that we're devoting all of<br />
our energies, we're trying a whole lot of strategies to tackle the problem of<br />
unemployment. We have an employment committee of Cabinet that meets on a regular<br />
basis. It meets just as regularly as the full Cabinet. And we've got a whole lot of<br />
different approaches and ideas. Helping small business will help. The ' work for the<br />
dole' proposal will help. There are some other strategies which we'll looking at in the<br />
next few weeks that will help. But it will take time.<br />
CARLTON: Will you get it down by the next election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm aiming to get it down as soon as possible without any particular reference to<br />
the next election. I mean I want to get it down. </p>
<p>CARLTON: It would be nice though, wouldn't it, two years?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course it would be nice but it would be nice for the people who are out work if<br />
we could get it down irrespective of any election date.<br />
CARLTON: What about youth unemployment? You've got this ' work for the dole' scheme which<br />
might at best raise morale.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think it's quite important. The, I guess, the self esteem part of youth<br />
unemployment is quite important.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
We have the highest youth suicide rate in the world...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We do. I went to a seminar on that this morning...<br />
CARLTON: And that's a terrible state...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is a terrible state of affairs and it's something that's got to be tackled in a bipartisan<br />
fashion. And I don't blame the policies of the Labor Party any more than they can<br />
blame us. Some of it's due to the effect of family breakdowns, unemployment. Some<br />
of it is due to people just feeling unwanted and left out of society. It's particularly high<br />
in rural and regional areas of Australia. But it is an absolute blight on a country which<br />
in so many other ways holds its head up as being a pretty successful happy society.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
And it suggests we're not all that comfortable and relaxed doesn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, a lot of people who feel like taking their lives are obviously not, and, of course<br />
not, and I don't pretend everybody and I think I acknowledge that. </p>
<p>CARLTON: I want to jump from the economy a bit but just a little on the budget. Cabinet got back<br />
to work after Christmas to find the Treasury got its figures dramatically wrong yet<br />
again. You've got another black hole of what, $ 3 billion, $ 5 billion, it changes every<br />
day. Is there going to be another big round of spending cuts?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There will be further spending cuts...<br />
CARLTON: Big round?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
but nothing like last year.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Nothing like last year.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, but there will be some spending cuts.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Has Treasury let you down? Are you getting good advice from them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I was very disappointed at the company tax error.<br />
CARLTON: That was the Taxation Office, wasn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That was the Taxation Office. A combination of the Taxation Office and the Treasury.<br />
It was an error of $ 1.6 billion in $ 130 billion.<br />
CARLTON: It's not bad... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm putting...<br />
CARLTON: If you were running a business you'd be broke, wouldn't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I beg your pardon?<br />
CARLTON: If you were running a business like that you'd be broke in the end.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but, well as I'm not... I1c an't defend it but I think it has to be said on their behalf<br />
that it was an estimating error. It's not as if they added something up wrongly. I<br />
mean, what you're expected to do with these things is to calculate on the basis of what<br />
happened last year, how much tax companies are going to pay next year.<br />
CARLTON: Right. It's given you a black hole though.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course it has. It's made our task harder and it's made me crankier. It's just as<br />
well I had a good holiday...<br />
CARLTON: Were you firm? Were you ( inaudible)...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Stop asking me so many Sir Humphrey questions.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
That's all right. Where's the fat to be cut? Are you going to deliver Keating's tax<br />
cuts, the $ 4.5 billion superannuation incentive?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm conscious of what's been said about that but I can't really say any more on<br />
that than what Peter... </p>
<p>CARLTON:<br />
Peter Costello's not very keen on it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I can't say any more than what he's said. Obviously we have to find our<br />
resources from somewhere. We want to try and do it in an equitable way. We're not<br />
incidentally planning to take any more, as a newspaper report said this morning from<br />
the ABC.<br />
CARLTON: I'm delighted to hear that and as you can see the smiles of delight on the<br />
faces...( inaudible) Not another dollar?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There's a figure in this triennium of $ 55 million...<br />
CARLTON:<br />
And that's it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And that's it.<br />
CARLTON: For three years, you won't touch another cent on...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is the commitment.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
The last commitment was you'd maintain funding at existing levels and you whipped<br />
million out...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You've seen the whites of my eyes.<br />
CARLTON: Is this a core commitment? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you've heard what I've said.<br />
CARLTON: Okay. Health, can we look at health?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. CARLTON: The States are screaming for more money. Australians are walking about of private<br />
health insurance and the AMA today said they're right to do so.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I thought that was a very irresponsible selfish statement. Right at the moment the<br />
AMA is cranky with the insurance funds because they don't like some of the policies of<br />
the private health insurance funds. But for the Vice President of the AMA to make<br />
that kind of statement, which I hope incidentally is not adopted by AMA policy, is<br />
quite unhelpful. Private health insurance is under a lot of strain because something<br />
should have been done years ago to keep people in private health insurance. Graham<br />
Richardson, three or four years ago, said that if private health insurance fell below<br />
about 40% of the population you'd begin to have a sort of a critical mass problem. It's<br />
now down to 34%. Our private health tax rebate start in July. They should have been<br />
introduced some years ago.<br />
CARLTON: Jeff Kennett says it's money down the drain.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah well I don't agree with Kennett on that. In September of last year he said it was<br />
the greatest thing since slice bread. I think...<br />
CARLTON: But you are getting to this crisis point, aren't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think the health situation... I1 wouldn't use the word crisis. That's sort of an<br />
alarmist way of approaching it. But it is a difficult policy area. There's a load on<br />
public hospitals because people are dropping out of private insurance and it's very,<br />
very important that we find ways of keeping them in... </p>
<p>CARLTON: But basically the AMA's right. The sums don't add up. You only now getting any<br />
benefit from health insurance if you're elderly or chronically ill. For a young healthy<br />
family it doesn't compute.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's less attractive but everybody at some stage hopes to be old and if you are...<br />
CARLTON: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well let me..<br />
CARLTON: Expect, expect to be old.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They expect to be old, they don't want to be old, they expect to be old. They hope to<br />
live long enough to be old and the idea that you can just sort of cream it off when you<br />
need it is one of the reasons why we have a problem. And you do have to get, as part<br />
of any health insurance system that works, you do have to get young healthy people<br />
into it. Now, there are shortcomings, but the more people who drop out, the more<br />
shortcomings are created.<br />
CARLTON: And that's a problem for government.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Of course it's a problem and we'll be addressing it. We've got a Productivity<br />
Commission file a report coming very soon I think. It may be arriving in the next few<br />
days. We have to address that and make some decisions and make some<br />
announcements. But I don't pretend that it is easy but I don't think the AMA's<br />
contribution is very far sighted. I'm disappointed and I hope it's not adopted as AMA<br />
policy. CARLTON: Okay. Can you rule out any changes to Medicare in the coming budget? That was a<br />
core promise. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we certainly won't be changing the fabric of Medicare. I mean, everybody has a<br />
different view about what it represents. But the universal availability and funded by,<br />
certain services funded by, in part, by a levy, that's not going to be changed, no.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
No, okay. Aborigines and the Wik decision you've been in a long round of talks<br />
about that. I gather no decision has been taken.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I've got a lot more talks yet and I've said that I'll take a decision if there is an<br />
agreed outcome, I'll take that to the Cabinet by Easter. If there's no agreed outcome<br />
from the discussions then we'll have to decide. I certainly will have to be putting some<br />
proposals to the Cabinet. I'm taking a deep personal interest in this.<br />
CARLTON: You'll have to put proposals to the National Party won't you? ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I put proposals to Tim Fischer and his colleagues all the time. Tim's aware of the<br />
negotiating stance that I'm taking. Tim's handling his own position in relation to this<br />
very well and he has my total support. It's a difficult issue for rural people who are<br />
understandably disappointed with the High Court's decision in the Wik case and we<br />
have to try and find whether there is an agreed outcome that everybody can feel<br />
comfortable with and I'm trying very hard to do that. I have talked with the<br />
Aboriginal leaders and I'm talking to them again and I'll keep talking to everybody to<br />
see if we can get an agreed outcome that's fair to everybody but also delivers an<br />
amount of certainty. I mean that Century Zinc project in Queensland I had in last<br />
week six Aboriginal elders coming down pleading with me in my office in Canberra to<br />
change the Native Title Act so the project could go ahead. I mean they are absolutely<br />
furious, angry. Their descriptions of what they described as the " minority malcontents"<br />
in the Aboriginal community who are holding up the project and are going to deliver<br />
jobs opportunity and hope to their children and there were six of them in my office<br />
saying you've got to get rid of the present Native Title, you've got to give us a fair go,<br />
we are going to sue the Native Title Act, they were really worked up. It was a very<br />
interesting window onto the conflicting opinion. Not everybody should imagine for<br />
moment Mike that all of the Aboriginal community supports the present Native Title<br />
regime. It really doesn't.<br />
CARLTON: It's an amazing situation though isn't it, when the Chief Justice accuses the Deputy<br />
Prime Minister of damaging the court, undermining its integrity, attacking the court for<br />
short term political gain. Have you asked Tim Fischer to tone it down? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Tim and I talked about that. The dispute between him and the Chief Justice arose<br />
out of a comment that Tim made giving the impression that he was criticising the court<br />
for being too slow to deliver the Wik decision. Now, they've had an exchange of<br />
correspondence. It's interesting that in the letter that was published in the Herald this<br />
morning, the Chief Justice didn't dispute the right of people to criticise court decisions.<br />
What he expressed concern about was any suggestion that there was a reflection on the<br />
integrity of the court or the application of the judges to their job. Now, let me make it<br />
clear we have a long history of judicial integrity in this country and I support very<br />
strongly the role of the High Court within our present system.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Do you repudiate what Tim Fischer has been saying about the High Court?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I certainly don't repudiate his criticism of the Wik decision.<br />
CARLTON: What.. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, anybody has got a right to criticise an individual court decision. You don't have<br />
well, you shouldn't criticise the integrity of judges and I don't...<br />
CARLTON: But Tim Fischer did....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No no no...<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Well that's what... well, the Chief Justice got that impression.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't think what Tim said amounted to a criticism of the integrity of the court.<br />
Let me make it clear as Prime Minister. I have total confidence in the integrity of the<br />
members of the High Court. </p>
<p>CARLTON: Individually and together?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, in their integrity absolutely and I think they are applying themselves to their task.<br />
That doesn't mean to say both as a citizen and as Prime Minister I agree with all of<br />
their decisions. I was disappointed in the decision of the High Court in the Wik case.<br />
It would have been much better in my view if the court had decided the other way.<br />
Instead of it being 4-3 the way they decided, if it had been 4-3 in the other direction....<br />
but well...<br />
CARLTON: Umpires decision.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I accept that they've given a decision but they must accept, and the community<br />
must accept that Parliament has a right to alter the law as interpreted by that decision.<br />
CARLTON: It just seems there's an attack on the court largely coming from the National Party, not<br />
just Tim Fischer; Rob Borbidge was at it again today. I mean he'd virtually like to see<br />
him put up against a wall and shot...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't know about that...<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Does this undermine the public respect...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look it is very important that the role of the court be respected and upheld and I am a<br />
traditional defender of the role of the courts in our system of Government. One of the<br />
problems Mike is that the perception has developed that some judges believe it is their<br />
role to give the Parliament a hurry on and do things that they think the parliament<br />
should have done.<br />
CARLTON: Do you share that perception? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Do I share that... I think that in some areas, let me put it this way, I can understand<br />
why some people have developed that perception.<br />
CARLTON: Oh that's a weaselly answer....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No no well let me be even more specific. Let me be I mean, the former chief justice<br />
made a speech at the end of last year in which he basically expressed the view that it<br />
wasn't a bad idea if the court hopped in and did things that Parliament found it difficult<br />
to do. Now that is not the role of the court. That's the role of the Parliament. If<br />
people don't like what the Parliament is doing they throw us out. You don't throw<br />
judges out. Part of a judicial system is that judges are there, they can't be removed<br />
unless for proven misconduct or corruption until they reach the statutory retiring age.<br />
Now, I am totally against any change to that system. I'm against any change in the<br />
method of appointment of High Court judges. They will continue to be appointed by<br />
the Government of the day.<br />
CARLTON: None of this State consultation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We'll talk to the States, we've been doing that for 20 years, but they won't have a veto<br />
and any suggestion that we go down the American path of having Senate hearings or<br />
having elections I am totally and utterly opposed to that. I think it would destroy a<br />
very important part of our system of Government.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Would you like Tim to tone it down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't think Tim ever overdoes it. I think he is a fantastic deputy and a fantastic<br />
bloke. CARLTON:<br />
All right. Some quick ones if we could. The Republic. You've said this is a low<br />
priority issue Why are you smiling? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I just knew you'd get to it!<br />
CARLTON: You've said this is a low priority issue for you and most Australians, but if this<br />
constitutional convention comes out decisively in favour of a Republic, would you then<br />
see it as your role to pursue it vigorously as a leader?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I would not in any way stand in the way of people expressing their views<br />
strongly if that ultimately leads to a republic well, so be it, I will accept that. I've<br />
made that very clear all along. I am not going to try and ram my view on this down<br />
the throats of the Australian people but I have to be honest and say what my view is,<br />
everybody knows, they knew that before the election, I said I'd have a convention, I'm<br />
going to have it. I'll obviously listen very carefully to what comes out of that and I'll<br />
be guided by what comes out of it or doesn't come out of it or..<br />
CARLTON: The suggestion is you'd like nothing to come out of it, to end in total confusion...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I am not going to act in anyway to torpedo it. I'm not going to do that, but let's<br />
see what happens.<br />
CARLTON: Very quickly on the constitution. Have you, now that you've actually been in the<br />
Prime Ministership for a year, are you attracted now to the idea of a four year term for<br />
the Government.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I always have been. Yes. That will be one of the subjects that will be on the agenda at<br />
the Constitutional Convention.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Would you... we've already had a referenda on it. Would you be prepared to bowl up<br />
another one at any stage?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if I knew the Labor Party would support it. </p>
<p>CARLTON: Well they ought to, they did last time. But Oppositions don't like it nearly as<br />
Governments.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'd have supported it. I told Bob Hawke in 1988 that if he went for 4 and 8 8<br />
for the Senate and 4 for the Reps we'd support it. He said, oh no, we're not going to<br />
support 8 years for the Senate so he then campaigned on 4 and 4. In other words he's<br />
cutting the and you'll never get something through that reduces the role of the<br />
Senate because the smaller States understandably will always oppose that.<br />
CARLTON: All right. I've got about 30 more questions to put to you and I've only got three<br />
minutes to do it. Would you be dismayed if Kerry Packer were to own Fairfax?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't want to approach media policy in mogul specific terms if I can put it that way<br />
but if you are asking me am I in favour of relaxing the cross media rules...<br />
CARLTON: I'm not asking you that...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I know you are not asking me that but look I don't have a paranoia about Kerry<br />
Packer, no. I don't have a paranoia about Kerry Packer. I think in shaping media<br />
policy we've got to decide whether between one of three alternatives I suppose. You<br />
could leave everything as it is with the instability that that produces. You have a much<br />
higher level of foreign ownership or perhaps in some areas you might in the eyes of<br />
some have a much higher level of concentration or perhaps the fourth alternative is<br />
some kind of mix of those three. We'll look at the cross media rules. I mean, Packer<br />
has a his whole family and his business has a very strong background. He is as far as<br />
a you might put a wholly Australian based operation, he's the one sort of..<br />
CARLTON: Well up to a point.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, well, he's got interests overseas but nobody can deny that he's a media he's a<br />
private media organisation that has a strong Australian base. </p>
<p>CARLTON: There's three other questions I'd like to throw at you. Which one would you like?<br />
The Senator Colston question, the Pauline Hanson...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't mind.... I don't mind staying a bit longer.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
I'm tempted, we could roll a tape. Shouldn't you have been tougher on Pauline<br />
Hanson? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't think so.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
Didn't that do a lot of damage?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't, in fact we had some figures in Parliament last week that showed that the<br />
number of people from Asia wanting to come here as students and as visitors had<br />
continued to rise quite sharply. I think I did handle it correctly. I was writing<br />
criticising sections of media for getting more worked up about it than the community<br />
was. CARLTON: All right. One last question. Are you liking the job?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I am.<br />
CARLTON: Have you got another election in you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Several.<br />
CARLTON: Several. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Several. CARLTON: Well several, let's say two elections, that will take you through to 2002. Do you still<br />
see yourself there then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would expect so, yes.<br />
CARLTON: Three terms as Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I say, you know, ten years perhaps but seriously I will continue to do the job while I do<br />
it well, while I'm healthy and so far I think I'm satisfying those two criteria but<br />
ultimately my colleagues and the public will decide that. I mean, the public might<br />
decide at the next election...<br />
CARLTON:<br />
They might.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They could well. They could say we'll get rid of him.<br />
CARLTON: Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pleasure. </p>
