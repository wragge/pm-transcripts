    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, ladies and gentlemen since we last met I've had some further</p>
<p> bi-lateral discussions. I had a meeting with the President of China,</p>
<p> Jiang Zemin, and also a meeting with the Prime Minister of Singapore,</p>
<p> Goh Chok Tong. Both of those meetings were very productive.</p>
<p>I renewed my invitation for President Jiang Zemin to visit Australia</p>
<p> and from his response I'm hopeful that he will visit Australia</p>
<p> around the time of the APEC meeting next year. Which as you know is</p>
<p> to be held in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that the bi-lateral relationship between China</p>
<p> and Australia is very good. It has steadily improved over the last</p>
<p> two years. I reminded the President of our meeting in similar circumstances</p>
<p> in the surrounds of the APEC meeting in Manila in 1996 and that commenced</p>
<p> a process of improving the relationship between the two countries</p>
<p> which has continued. And I'm very happy to say that I regard</p>
<p> the improvement in that relationship and the way in which it has broadened</p>
<p> and been put on a very pragmatic, sensible basis, has a very significant</p>
<p> foreign policy achievement during the time that I've been in</p>
<p> government, because it is a very important relationship. We do have</p>
<p> differences, we don't pretend that there aren't differences,</p>
<p> we don't play act about it being a special relationship or a</p>
<p> unique relationship. We simply treat it in a very pragmatic fashion</p>
<p> and to the benefit of both countries we do have a lot in common. We</p>
<p> have a lot of dissimilarities; obviously. But it's a very good</p>
<p> relationship.</p>
<p>Of course the relationship between Australia and Singapore is very</p>
<p> close and it's always valuable to renew my association with Goh</p>
<p> Chok Tong. We have a lot in common in our attitude towards trade issues</p>
<p> and also of course regional issues and it was an opportunity to exchange</p>
<p> opinions on the situation in Indonesia which is of great importance</p>
<p> to both of us in different ways, but nonetheless of great importance</p>
<p> to both of us. So I'm very pleased to report that both of those</p>
<p> meetings went extremely well from our point of view and I can report</p>
<p> the very positive state of the bi-lateral relationship in each case.</p>
<p>I don't have an enormous amount of time the Canadian Prime Minister</p>
<p> and I and our wives are having dinner together tonight, but if there</p>
<p> are any questions you wanted to ask me I'll try and respond.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(Inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well both of them want the momentum to be maintained. They don't</p>
<p> regard the second best outcome in relation to the voluntary sectoral</p>
<p> liberalisation as being the sort of end of all that is good and it's</p>
<p> really a question of putting it in context and going on to other things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How confident are you Prime Minister based on these talks that when</p>
<p> the leaders get together they can actually produce something very</p>
<p> substantial in terms of addressing the financial crisis?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm encouraged Paul. I don't want to put it any more strongly</p>
<p> than that because there are different interests and different pressures</p>
<p> coming to bear and of course, a number of the countries that will</p>
<p> be represented by their leaders at this meeting would argue that they</p>
<p> have already undertaken very significant reform measures. A country</p>
<p> like Thailand would argue that it's already accepted an enormous</p>
<p> amount of discipline. Kim Dae-Jung would argue that his country has</p>
<p> already undertaken major reform and it's true. In both the cases</p>
<p> I've mentioned, Thailand and Korea, they've already gone</p>
<p> a long way down the path and they've taken some very severe medicine,</p>
<p> and they are to be congratulated for that. So that's one of the</p>
<p> things you've got to bear in mind. Some people will say well</p>
<p> look we're quite happy to look at further changes, and further</p>
<p> reforms, but please understand we've submitted ourselves to an</p>
<p> IMF discipline and we are complying with the request of the IMF. So</p>
<p> I'm cautiously optimistic. I don't want to put it any more</p>
<p> strongly than that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With APEC ... what would you expect to emerge on the question of</p>
<p> re growth of the region........(inaudible)...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, well different countries will give different reports. I mean</p>
<p> in my discussion with Dr Mahathir today for example, he was predicting</p>
<p> that Malaysia would enjoy growth of 1 per cent next year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you discuss any concerns about the situation in Indonesia with</p>
<p> President Habibie tomorrow?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't want to foreshadow in advance the detail of what</p>
<p> I'll discuss with him but obviously it's not realistic for</p>
<p> the Prime Minister of Australia and the President of Indonesia to</p>
<p> have a meeting at this time without the domestic situation in Indonesia</p>
<p> being discussed. Of course, we'll discuss it. I am sympathetic</p>
<p> to Indonesia's difficulties and Australians should be sympathetic</p>
<p> to Indonesia's difficulty. That country is going through an enormous</p>
<p> social and political transformation. There's no doubt about that.</p>
<p> There are forces that work there which will not be changed and the</p>
<p> country is going through a very big transformation and it's very</p>
<p> difficult and without in any way walking away from things that we</p>
<p> regard as important we should be understanding of that and we should</p>
<p> be sympathetic to the Government of Indonesia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister will you be inviting President Habibie to visit Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I will.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>His predecessor felt that the Timor issue was one that would make</p>
<p> it very difficult. Do you share any concerns that you invite President</p>
<p> Habibie along the same lines?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there was never a concern on the Australian part. As far as</p>
<p> Australia was concerned the former President Soeharto was always welcome.</p>
<p> It was a reluctance on his part to come because of perceptions about</p>
<p> demonstrations within Australia. And our position would be the same.</p>
<p> We support the right of people to lawfully register their point of</p>
<p> view and lawfully demonstrate in accordance with proper courteous</p>
<p> practice and it's not a phenomenon that it unknown in our country</p>
<p> Paul, as you know. Even in election campaigns.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are they any ...(inaudible)... that President Habibie maybe</p>
<p> get a little more confident about visiting Australia than his predecessor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've not discussed it with him Jim. Tomorrow will be my</p>
<p> first meeting with him in his capacity as President. I have met him</p>
<p> on a number of other occasions, but this will be our first head of</p>
<p> government encounter, so I don't know.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you believe that Indonesia's interest is moving fast enough</p>
<p> to address the economic situation in its country. Will you be asking</p>
<p> President Habibie to make more room to do so?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I certainly won't be, in my discussions with the President,</p>
<p> I won't be uncomprehending of the enormous strain that's</p>
<p> being imposed on Indonesian society by the economic adjustment it</p>
<p> has to make. I mean you're talking about a country where tens</p>
<p> of millions of people have now been plunged into absolute poverty</p>
<p> and we have to have an understanding of that and we have to be very</p>
<p> careful that we don't sound so out of touch with the reality</p>
<p> of life in Indonesia for the average person, that we are not taken</p>
<p> any notice of it. It's always important in these situations to</p>
<p> sure sound consistent and firm, if I can use that word, but equally</p>
<p> you've got to sound in touch and understanding and comprehending</p>
<p> and a country with a high living standard such as Australia loses</p>
<p> its capacity to influence if it behaves in a way which shows an insensitivity</p>
<p> to the problems.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Back on China. Do you detect that there's an increasing role</p>
<p> from China or increasing influence from China within the APEC forum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thought China would have an increasing role for a long time. But</p>
<p> I don't want to overestimate it. I mean China is still very strongly</p>
<p> committed to liberalisation and opening up its economy. Jiang Zemin</p>
<p> told me today that China remained very committed to an open attitude</p>
<p> to foreign investment and would maintain its process of economic liberalisation,</p>
<p> so inevitably China will become more and more important as time goes</p>
<p> by, but of course, it is coming off a low growth base. It's coming</p>
<p> off a low level of economic activity and although the growth is in</p>
<p> nominal terms very high, it is still in GDP terms a long way behind</p>
<p> many other countries, but it is a very big country and it's potential</p>
<p> is unlimited.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you discussed with the Singapore Prime Minister recent financial</p>
<p> tensions in Malaysia and also Malaysia's (inaudible) five power</p>
<p> defence agreement and do you see the future of that five power defence</p>
<p> agreement...particular lame duck out of .....(inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it's not a lame duck and something I mentioned at the press</p>
<p> conference earlier today was that one of the very positive things</p>
<p> to come out of my discussion with Dr Mahathir is that he reaffirmed</p>
<p> his commitment to the fire power defence agreement. I touched briefly,</p>
<p> or the tensions between the two countries were touched upon briefly</p>
<p> in both the bi-lateral discussions I had. I got the impression that</p>
<p> neither leader saw the problems as being insurmountable and the Prime</p>
<p> Minister of Singapore made it clear to me that he would not allow</p>
<p> those tensions to get in the way of the working through of the five</p>
<p> power defence agreement. I actually came away from my discussion with</p>
<p> both of them with very positive words from each on the future of that</p>
<p> agreement.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard when you were speaking today at the Business Summit you</p>
<p> said it was important, very important for people to explain the benefits</p>
<p> to people of trade liberalisation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that something that you had at the back of your mind recent experience</p>
<p> in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'd always have at the back of mind experiences in Australia</p>
<p> in relation to political explanations. Indeed, it's in front</p>
<p> of my mind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard do you have any fresh ideas about how to make trade liberalisations</p>
<p> benefits real .... It's very hard to explain.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think you need anecdotes, you need stories, examples of how things</p>
<p> have been achieved, that's what you need and I think we, all</p>
<p> of us, as political leaders need to remind ourselves that you have</p>
<p> to provide real live flesh and blood examples of how market access</p>
<p> has been achieved and it's always so much easier to dramatise</p>
<p> a closure because of import penetration. It's often harder to</p>
<p> talk about a new market found because of trade liberalisations.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's been the reaction to reform assistance package you announced</p>
<p> today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>With those of whom I've discussed are very positive. The Chinese</p>
<p> President liked it. The Singaporean Prime Minister liked it and I</p>
<p> indicated the broad outlines of it to Dr Mahathir and it had a good</p>
<p> reaction amongst the business people to whom I spoke and I'll</p>
<p> of course talk about it later again tomorrow.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What assurances have you got from China in relation to economic growth</p>
<p> and currency?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It would be wrong to say that the word assurance was given in relation</p>
<p> to the currency, but there was obvious pleasure taken in the fact</p>
<p> that they held the line on the currency and the very distinct impression</p>
<p> I got was that there was not going to be any change in that respect.</p>
<p> Economic growth? There were no figures mentioned Paul, but except</p>
<p> in what had been achieved up to date but the tenor of the discussion</p>
<p> was that they remain very strongly committed to economic growth.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Aside from reaching (inaudible) is there an outcome that you regard</p>
<p> more important than any other at the Summit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is a very important goal. I think it's always dangerous</p>
<p> with these things to have a hierarchy of goals because then people</p>
<p> start looking at things.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
