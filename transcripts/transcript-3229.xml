PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 243<br />
April 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S LETTER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
ORGANISATIONS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced tonight<br />
that he had written to the Town Clerks and members of each<br />
local government body in Australia about the forthcoming<br />
referendum on local government.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that it was important that each<br />
local government organisation knew the real facts about<br />
the referendum which would be put to the people on May 18.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that if the referendum was carried the<br />
Australian Government would be able to make funds available<br />
directly to local government both by way of grants and by<br />
loans at lower interest rates, so that urban and rural councils<br />
and other local government bodies could be freed from the<br />
financial straightjacket of the past.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that he had urged each local<br />
government body to give support in theirarea for a YES<br />
vote on May 18. He said he had also forwarded to each<br />
local government body copies of his many speeches on local<br />
government and its financial relations with the national<br />
Government. CANBERRA. A. C. T. Fr </p>
