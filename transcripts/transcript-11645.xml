    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Celia Larkin, John Anderson the Deputy Prime</p>
<p> Minister, Kim Beazley, Leader of the Opposition, my ministerial and parliamentary</p>
<p> colleagues, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I recall during the last federal election campaign that the guns of political</p>
<p> battle were put aside and the campaign suspended for a very distinguished</p>
<p> visitor to Canberra the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese. And I observed</p>
<p> to her at the time that only the President of Ireland could suspend an</p>
<p> Australian election campaign and live to tell the tale. But, of course,</p>
<p> as something of the character and the verve of Australian politics has</p>
<p> been influenced, I suspect, by that great tributary to Australian culture</p>
<p> that the Irish represent that any acquaintance with the President of Ireland</p>
<p> during an election campaign appears very natural indeed.</p>
<p>Bertie Ahern, you are so welcome here tonight. It is the easiest thing</p>
<p> in the world for an Australian Prime Minister to welcome to our country</p>
<p> the leader of Ireland. It is inaccurate to say that the Irish have made</p>
<p> a great contribution to Australia. The truth is that the Australian identity</p>
<p> is inextricably Irish to a very large extent. The influence of Ireland,</p>
<p> the influence of Irish culture and the influence of Irish ways, the influence</p>
<p> of the character of Irish people has been with us from the time of European</p>
<p> settlement in this country.</p>
<p>And the story of Australia of the last 200 odd years described, I think,</p>
<p> very well by Patrick O'Farrell in his landmark study of the impact</p>
<p> of the Irish on Australia when he spoke of how it was in many respects</p>
<p> a struggle between the English majority and the Irish minority but a struggle</p>
<p> which despite its elements of great discord and its elements of discrimination</p>
<p> and so forth and things that all of us have thankfully put years and years</p>
<p> behind us, it was nonetheless a struggle that in its outworking was extremely</p>
<p> productive. Because in many ways it represented a debate about the kind</p>
<p> of nation we wanted to build and the kind of society we wanted to create.</p>
<p>You have come to us, Taoiseach, having visited your forces in East Timor.</p>
<p> And I want to thank you and your country and your Government very warmly</p>
<p> for the support you gave to the Interfet force. East Timor is a long way</p>
<p> from Ireland and we like to think that in part your contribution was a</p>
<p> demonstration of the affectionate bonds that exist between your country</p>
<p> and ours. But importantly, it illustrated the common values that we hold</p>
<p> and the common commitment we have to the cause of justice and fair dealing</p>
<p> between people.</p>
<p>I have spoken a few moments about the historic and the sentimental character</p>
<p> of the relationship between Australia and the Republic of Ireland. Perhaps</p>
<p> before I conclude I might briefly return to that aspect of the relationship.</p>
<p> But the relationship today is very much, of course, also the relationship</p>
<p> between two modern industrialised nations. Ireland has enjoyed remarkable</p>
<p> economic progress over the last 10 to 20 years. You have achieved significant</p>
<p> reductions in your unemployment levels. You have embarked upon, as you</p>
<p> described to me this morning, very courageous taxation reform, something</p>
<p> that always draws a bit of interest and an interjection from the Treasurer.</p>
<p> But what we have witnessed in Ireland over the last decade and a half</p>
<p> has been very much the transformation of your economy.</p>
<p>You have reversed the decades-long exodus of your young people and many</p>
<p> Irish leaders today rejoice in the return of so many of the young people</p>
<p> of their homeland to the Republic of Ireland. You are an active member</p>
<p> and I think a very productive member of the European Union. Of course</p>
<p> the Australian Government from time to time has the odd difference of</p>
<p> opinion with the European Union regarding matters relating to trade and</p>
<p> I think both of us reminded ourselves in our discussions this morning</p>
<p> of the tremendous importance of trade and the tremendous importance of</p>
<p> breathing new life into the cause of greater liberalisation of world trade.</p>
<p>All of us have watched, Taoiseach, the steps towards achieving a lasting</p>
<p> peace in Northern Ireland. I think all Australians look to the day when</p>
<p> the bitterest of opponents in the Northern Ireland dispute are perpetually</p>
<p> sidelined and the decent men and women of both sides of that long divide</p>
<p> dominate the political processes of Northern Ireland. And I think particularly</p>
<p> of men of the ilk of John Hume and David Trimble, the joint winners of</p>
<p> the Nobel Peace prize. Because the tragedy of the long years of death</p>
<p> and destruction in Northern Ireland I know weighs very heavily upon both</p>
<p> the British and the Irish governments and I want to pay tribute to the</p>
<p> efforts of successive Irish leaders as well as the efforts of successive</p>
<p> prime ministers of the United Kingdom to try and bring about an honourable</p>
<p> settlement. The setback recently is of course a disappointment. As I said</p>
<p> at the press conference this morning our view, and I know it is very much</p>
<p> the view of the Irish Government, is that adherence to the principles</p>
<p> of the Good Friday agreement constitutes the proper basis of achieving</p>
<p> a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is a very happy occasion tonight. It's</p>
<p> an occasion when all of us feel very much at ease with our heritage, very</p>
<p> much at ease with the history of relations between Australia and the Republic</p>
<p> of Ireland. I suppose Australia is in many respects the most spectacular</p>
<p> component of the Irish diaspora. Something in the order of 35 per cent</p>
<p> of Australians trace their heritage in some way or another to different</p>
<p> parts of Ireland. And I, of course, am no exception. My maternal great</p>
<p> grandmother was born in Westmeath in what is now the Republic of Ireland</p>
<p> and my paternal great grandfather just to even it up was born in Portadown</p>
<p> in County Armagh in the North of Ireland. And it is not, of course, in</p>
<p> any way unusual to the experience of Australians to count that Irish heritage</p>
<p> as a very important part of the make up of this country.</p>
<p>Ireland and the Irish have played an incredibly important role in the</p>
<p> development of the spirit and the character of this country. To the Irish</p>
<p> influence we owe much of the larrikin element of our temperament which</p>
<p> we hold so dear. Our capacity to relate in an open warm hearted fashion</p>
<p> with each other has also been greatly conditioned by our Irish heritage.</p>
<p>One of the, I think, great achievements of the building of the Australian</p>
<p> nation is that we have in so many ways been able to take from the different</p>
<p> parts of our heritage those things which are positive and those things</p>
<p> which we wish to preserve for the future while rejecting those elements</p>
<p> of our heritage that are negative and counterproductive. And so it has</p>
<p> been that while we have retained much of the instinct for, I think, civil</p>
<p> processes in our Government despite our robust political system, and the</p>
<p> great inheritance of the rule of law from the United Kingdom we have rejected</p>
<p> the class consciousness of so much of Europe. And so it has been in relation</p>
<p> to our Irish heritage. We have taken so many of the wonderful, open warm-hearted</p>
<p> bits of it and we have moulded them in the Australian environment and</p>
<p> in the process it has made a massive contribution to the building of what</p>
<p> we all know to be the modern Australian nation and what we all know to</p>
<p> be the Australian character and the modern Australian man or woman.</p>
<p>Can I say to you, Bertie, and to Celia, I hope you have a very pleasant</p>
<p> time in Australia. I know that you have met many of your fellow countrymen</p>
<p> and women. I know that you have been received very warmly. And can I say</p>
<p> on behalf of all of my parliamentary colleagues and all of those gathered</p>
<p> here this evening that it will always be a very special occasion to have</p>
<p> the leader of the Irish people amongst us. We will always be ready to</p>
<p> acknowledge the bonds between our two countries, we'll always be</p>
<p> ready to acknowledge the debt we owe to the Irish heritage in Australia.</p>
<p> And I invite in that spirit the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley,</p>
<p> to second my remarks.</p>
