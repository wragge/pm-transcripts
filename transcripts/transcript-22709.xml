    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the government has proclaimed the Australian Defence Force Ensign as an official flag of Australia.  This proclamation was made under the Flags Act 1953.  The proclamation does not alter the pre-eminent status of the Australian national flag.</p>
<p>The Australian Defence Force Ensign was created by the Defence Force in 1969 to identify Australian military formations serving in Vietnam containing more than one of the three services.  The Ensignâ€™s use has grown since that time with the greater cooperation of the three arms of the Defence Force in joint operations.  The Ensign has not, until now, been accorded formal status as an official flag of Australia. </p>
<p>The ensigns of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force with their proud histories will continue in use and represent their respective services.  The role of the Australian Army as protector of the Australian national flag continues unchanged. </p>
