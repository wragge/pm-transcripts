FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 96/ 1966<br />
CONFERENCE OF HEADS OF 7XOVLRNJWMENT ON VIET NAM<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mvr. Harold Holt<br />
The Australian Th'vernment warmly commends the<br />
proposal put forward by President Mvarcos of the Philippines, in<br />
consultation with the President of Korea and the Prime Minister<br />
of Thailand. It appreciates the offer by President Marcos to<br />
make arrangements for the conference to be held in the Philippines.<br />
Since this is a conference of Heads of Government<br />
whose forces are joined in resisting Communist aggression in<br />
South Viet Nam, there will naturally be an assessment of the<br />
military situation. But also the Australian J'overnment sees the<br />
conference as one which will look towards the attainment of a<br />
just and enduring peace, and towards the further development of<br />
programmes of civil aid and economic reconstruction in South Viet<br />
Nam, and in the area generally, which would buttress freedom and<br />
progress. With each of these aspects coming uinder discussion,<br />
the Australian .3overnment sees great merit and promise in the<br />
proposal. I will be attending the conference and I am looking<br />
forward to joining in consultations with the Heads of allied<br />
Governments. CANBERRA, 27th September, 1966. </p>
