    <subjects>Changes to Government Whips,  Australians facing execution in Indonesia.</subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve made a very strong commitment for a deeper and stronger engagement with the backbench of our Party and that’s why I’ve chosen to renew the Whips team.</p>
<p>Obviously, I have nothing but the deepest respect for Philip Ruddock who has been a mighty servant of our country and our Parliament and I’m looking forward to Philip continuing to serve the Parliament and the Government in the days and weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia and my plea, even at this late stage, is for Indonesia to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the life of their citizens on death row overseas.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Is the sacking of Mr Ruddock an act of retribution, Prime Minister?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>No, not at all. Philip Ruddock is a friend, Philip Ruddock is a colleague and Philip Ruddock was a supporter, but what I am determined to do is have a deeper and stronger engagement with the backbench in the weeks and months ahead, and that means it was very important to renew and refresh the Whips team. But, I have nothing but respect, friendship and admiration for Philip who has been a great servant of our country and our Party for more than 40 years.</p>
