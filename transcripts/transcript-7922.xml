TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SHELL AUSTRALIA<br />
HEADQUARTERS, MELBOURNE 23 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: I'll just make a few comments and then be<br />
available for a few questions for a while. I want to<br />
suggest that the pattern of this campaign has become very<br />
clear now. You have Andrew Peacock running around this<br />
country prepared to make every sort of promise,<br />
commitments which are unfunded, a $ 6 billion credibility<br />
gap which means a blowout or the budget deficit, which<br />
associated with their refusal to name any wages target<br />
and therefore acknowledging that under their policies<br />
you'd also have a wages explosion, means only one thing<br />
rise in interest rates and collapse of the economy. What<br />
you see is Dr Hewson and Mr Stone being sent scurrying<br />
around after this profligate leader havinq to tidy up or<br />
attempt to tidy up that gross irresponsibility. Now this<br />
is a recipe for disaster. It is inevitable, as any<br />
economic analyist will tell you, that if you have a<br />
fiscal blowout, $ 6 billion hole adding to your<br />
debt-wages explosion, there is only one outcome a<br />
collapsed economy after a massive rise in interest rates.<br />
Against that and this is what this campaign is about<br />
choice between irresponsibility on the side of Mr Peacock<br />
and the conservatives or the responsibility that you've<br />
seen already in this campaign. That is a clear statement<br />
on behalf of the Government by the Treasurer of the<br />
savings that we will make to fund any promises that we<br />
make in this campaign. There are a range of choices that<br />
are going to emerge in the campaign. The choice of<br />
environmental responsibility on our part or environmental<br />
vandalism on the part of the opposition. In the area of<br />
the economy gross irresponsibility. A $ 6 billion<br />
credibility gap, fiscal blowout, wages blowout. On ouir<br />
side responsibility. Those things now are becoming<br />
clearer with every passing day.<br />
JOURNALIST! After the wages-tax deal this week, Mr<br />
Keating lot of business people are acting by Liberal<br />
Party Do you approve of that?<br />
PH: That's been true for a very long time. Ian Spicer,<br />
now don't, I mean I don't want to get into a personality<br />
clash with Ian. But Ian Spicer has never attempted, and<br />
this is to his credit, Ian Spicer has never attempted to<br />
hide his political identification with the Liberal Party.<br />
See, what happened in the last few weeks? Just lookc at </p>
<p>2<br />
page it. They came out in an unprompted, spontaneous way when<br />
they heard what the Liberals were saying about the wages<br />
policy and blew it out of the water. As well they should<br />
if they had any interest at all for their members.<br />
Because the Liberal's wages policy meant that large and<br />
small business in this country were going to be faced<br />
with a rerun of the beginning of the ' 80o. I mean this<br />
election campaign is about the future. That's what it's<br />
about as far as I'm concerned. The only relevance to the<br />
past wherever I'll be referring to it is as a lesson for<br />
the future and if my opponents are promising a repetition<br />
of the past. And of course the immediate reaction of<br />
business to what Chaney and the others were saying in<br />
regard to their wages policy was to throw their hands up<br />
in horror. But what happened? Immediately you had<br />
private phone calls between Chaney's office and Spicer<br />
saying look, there's an election coming on, we can't have<br />
this sort of apparent difference, and they tried to sort<br />
it out. But the fact is that as far as the actual<br />
policies are concerned of the Liberals and National<br />
I Party, business knows that it's a recipe for disaster.<br />
It must be a disaster if you're going to have $ 6 billion<br />
unfunded commitments and a wages explosion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Hr Hawks, what sort of week do you think<br />
you've had<br />
PH: I'm happy enough with the week. I believe that the<br />
only thing that's been talked about is that there was a<br />
sea of microphones incident on Monday in Sydney and a<br />
placard waver in Canberra on the same day. Now if people<br />
want to, as I've said before, make something out of that<br />
and think there's any significance, well that suits me<br />
fine, whetner it's commentators or Mr Peacock. We've had<br />
a week in which I've talked about positive issues for the<br />
future. Look at what's been done. We've dealt with the<br />
issue of microeconotmic reform. Now you'll recall,<br />
p Hbeeaetnh etrh, e cirfy , y out hel osockr ebaamc k ofo vetrh e prceovnisoeursv amtoinvtehss?, what's<br />
Hicroeconomic reform. You're not hearing much about it<br />
now are you, from them. It's not surprising. Because I<br />
have nailed them. Yesterday I said 77 days ago I issued<br />
you a challenge on microeconomice reform. Did it at the<br />
Press Club 77 days ago. I said you produce any evidence<br />
where in your 30 years out of the last 33 when you were<br />
establishing the practices, the institutions, that<br />
attitudes of this country, you produce me any evidence at<br />
all where in that period you came within a bull's roar of<br />
matching our record in microeconomic reform. They have<br />
tailed that challenge. Yesterday I set out the pattern<br />
of microeconomic reform for the fourth term in detail and<br />
challenged them there to begin to match it. They won't.<br />
They can't. They have no record. They have no policy<br />
and they have no commitment. All they do is to talk<br />
about productivity but they do nothing about it. Today<br />
again, what have we been on about? We've had the classic<br />
illustration of the difference between us and the<br />
conservatives. Today I was able to launch these booklets </p>
<p>page On Equal opportunity in Employment for Women. If you're<br />
going to talk about microeconomic reform I suggest it's<br />
very difficult to find anything more fundamental to<br />
economic reform than whether in your economy you create a<br />
situation where you're going to be able to tap into fifty<br />
percent of the population. That is, women. Can you<br />
think of anything more fundamental than making sure that<br />
you overcome the neglect of thirty years of conservatism<br />
which treated women as a sort of unfor-tunate appendage in<br />
the economic process. Y'know, if you're a woman and<br />
you've struggled through all of the restrictions, the<br />
prejudices, the barriers and make it, well OK, we'll<br />
accept that. But never in thirty years of conservatism<br />
will do anything to make sure for this country'that you<br />
tap that resource fifty percent of the population.<br />
Today, in this week of the campaign, I was able to show<br />
that it was this government, starting with its<br />
affirmative legislation, Affirmative Action legislation<br />
in 1984, which is acknowledged by everyone in the<br />
community, including the Business council and the<br />
confederation of Australian industry, as the the<br />
government which has released that fifty percent of our<br />
population. So that we're removing the barriers so that<br />
Australian enterprise, large and small, in the private<br />
sector and the public sector, is going to be able to tap<br />
in to women as well as to men. And the whole range of<br />
changes that we've made to make sure that that is an idea<br />
which becomes action. And we only haven't put in<br />
legisl. ation, not only have put in legislation, but we've<br />
made the associated changes a trebling by ' 92 of child<br />
care places. And so what have you seen? You've seen, in<br />
this period of seven years, the increase from 44 percent<br />
to 52 percent in the participation rate of women and into<br />
1.6 million new jobs we've created, 92 percent of them in<br />
the private sector, the majority of those jobs have gone<br />
to women. Now what more fundamental microeconomic reform<br />
could you make than that? And where can our conservative<br />
opponents start to talk about it? You'll have Hr Peacock<br />
S cwraenddiebriilnigt ya roguanpd antdh e tcaoluknitnrgy awboiutth hpirso duscitxi vbiitlyl, i onb utd ohlalvaer<br />
done nothing to tackle these fundamental issues. So my<br />
answer to your question is in this first week, there are<br />
the fundamentals. You couldn't have a greater difference<br />
emerged in the first week of the campaign. Hr Peacock<br />
with his unfunded promises, $ 6 billion hole. We've had a<br />
week in which the Treasurer, on behalf of the Government,<br />
has put down a detailed statement which shows that every<br />
promise that we make in this campaign will be fully<br />
funded. we have a wages outcome fixed for the next<br />
financial year. Our opponents, tagged by you people,<br />
asked what's your wages outcome a deafening silence.<br />
So at the end of the first week, Hawke and his colleagues<br />
dealt with the fundamental issues of macroeconomic<br />
policy, microeconomic reform, equal opportunity and what<br />
have you had in this week from Mr Peacock and our Liberal<br />
and National Party opposition on any of these fundamental<br />
issues? on macroeconomic policy, a $ 6 billion hole,<br />
wages explosion, microeconomic reform nothing, afld of </p>
<p>, page<br />
course$ in the area of equal opportunity they ought to<br />
collectively hang their heads in shame. If you were a<br />
woman in Australia, how would you like to have your<br />
future prospects depend upon a government which was made<br />
up of National Party people? You know how the National<br />
Party are committed to the interests of women. I won't<br />
use the phrase that's come from National Party leaders<br />
about where the place or women is. But you know what<br />
their record is and that fifty percent of the Australian<br />
population ought to be terribly apprehensive about any<br />
government in which the National Party has a significant<br />
part.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your assessment of the<br />
damage to Labor's campaign here in Victoria of the bad<br />
debt figures Tricontinental Bank?<br />
PXt: I haven't seen the statement that's been released.<br />
I saw some banner headline which talked about $ 795<br />
4j million I think. I'm not going to make any comment until<br />
I've seen the details and lot me say what I've said<br />
before. I really have, to a very large extent, covered<br />
this issue before by saying that I believe it's an insult<br />
to the intelligence of Victorian voters if you believe<br />
that any concern they may have about the Victorian State<br />
Government will be translated by them into saying they<br />
will punish themselves by voting against Federal Labor.<br />
Because what this election is about for Mr and Ms<br />
Victoria as it is for Mr and me Australia generally is<br />
about the issues I've just been talking about in this<br />
press conference. It is about are you going to have,<br />
when you're talking about losses and debt, are you going<br />
to have at the Federal level economic policies which<br />
don't run up your debt. Because under our opponents<br />
policy an increase, a running up of debt of $ 6 billion,<br />
where my Government's been paying offt debt. The<br />
Australian Government now owes no international debt. We<br />
are an international creditor. No Australian family can<br />
perceive of itself or being in debt on account of my<br />
Government because we have transformed the debt of our<br />
predecessors into a substantial surplus. So that's the<br />
sort of issue, do they want to run, if debt is in their<br />
mind, do they want to vote for a coalition which is going<br />
to increase Australia's debt or for a government which<br />
diminishes Australia's debt. Do they want in this<br />
election to have the continuation of Medicare or the<br />
chaos and destruction of Medicare promised by our<br />
opponents. In this election, do they want to vote for a<br />
government which has a magnificent record in protecting<br />
the environment, or do they want to vote federally for<br />
our opponents who would have dammed the Franklin, logged<br />
the Daintree, mined Kakadu and destroyed the forests of<br />
Tasmania. Those are the issues for the electors of<br />
Victoria. In this election it is a question of choice<br />
which is going to determine the welfare of the people of<br />
Victoria and the people of Australia. Predictable<br />
macroeconomic policies, a continuation of microeconomic<br />
reform, a running down of debt as we've done or an </p>
<p>, page increase in debt from their $ 6 billion hole, protection<br />
of the environment or destruction of the environment.<br />
These are the choices and I don't believe Mr and Ms<br />
Victoria, when they go into the ballot box, are going to<br />
say all those things don't matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, were you surprised that Mr<br />
Peacock's acceptance of your offer-to look at the NCA<br />
material P14: No, no..<br />
JOURNALIST: and have there been any formal<br />
arrangements made for him to look at that material?<br />
PK: I've asked that they be made. I wasn't surprised.<br />
but it just seemed to me that he must have. They've<br />
politicised the issue. They made the unfounded<br />
accusations against the Government in general and against<br />
O Lionel Bowen in particular. So I nailed them. I said<br />
look, you're making these accusations, have a look at the<br />
material. if there's any material, have a look at it.<br />
And he should look at it.<br />
JOURNALIST: How important is the..<br />
PM: And as I say, I understand that the arrangements<br />
have been made. I certainly asked that the Attorney-<br />
General's office facilitate this process.<br />
JOURNALIST: How important is the debate on Sunday in the<br />
scheme of the campaign? And what are you going to ask Mr<br />
Peacock? PM: Well, I know your last question isn't serious<br />
because you wouldn't expect me to tell you what I'm going<br />
to ask him. There's got to be a bit of an element of<br />
surprise. I know you've got to write a Sunday column<br />
Peter, but leave me something mate, leave me something.<br />
Let me say this obviously the debate has a<br />
significance. It would be silly for me to say it doesn't<br />
have any significance of course it does. But, as I've<br />
said, I also make the point that there's a sort of<br />
symmetry almost about the public life period of Mr<br />
Peacock and myself. We've both been in public life for<br />
about thirty years and I think that the Australian people<br />
are going to make a judgement on the 24th of March<br />
between Hr Peacock and myself on the basis of their<br />
perceptions of us in public life for thirty years. I<br />
trust and believe that the perception they have of<br />
myself, vis-a-vis Mr Peacock now, will be enhanced as a<br />
result of Sunday but I think that general perception is<br />
going to be there and it's going to be important. Let me<br />
also say that while this election is about leadership to<br />
some extent, obviously it is also about your team. And<br />
let it not be forgotten that this is another area of<br />
choice. on the one hand, a Labor Government lead by the<br />
man who is the undisputed leader, who has the undisputed </p>
<p>' page confidence and support of his party and all of it, and<br />
with a united team and on the other, a man who is not<br />
liked, if I could put it in moderate terms, by a great<br />
number of his own party. A disunited, hatred-ridden<br />
policy-less coalition of the Liberal and National Party.<br />
It's not just about the Liberals. They are asking the<br />
people of Australia to form a government of which the<br />
National Party. Those arm the issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when you say that the general<br />
perception of Mr Peacock will be in enhanced, what do you<br />
think that general perception is?<br />
PH: I said I think the perceptions will be enhanced of<br />
both of us. Look, I think you will find if you look at<br />
all the transcripts Dennis that I haven't got into<br />
personal, personality attacks on the Leader of the<br />
Opposition. Others do that in the media and in his own<br />
party, I mean the worst things that are said about Mr<br />
Peacock are basically said by his own people. I remind<br />
you of what Mr Howard said last year, and reported<br />
widely. He said there is and can be no trust between Mr<br />
Peacock and myself. Now they were Mr Howard's words no<br />
trust between us. And that's indicative if you like of<br />
the problem. They can never provide stable government<br />
while that party has got Mr Peacock and Hr Howard in it.<br />
There are two senior people with Mr Howard saying I've<br />
got to be honest, he said, there is and can be no trust<br />
between us. NOW, so I say, the things that are to be<br />
said about Mr Peacock are said and arm felt more deeply<br />
by his own people in his own party in his own coalition.<br />
I don't want to go into it now. I simply say I think I<br />
have a record of strong leadership, united party and Mr<br />
Peacock hasn't got that record of strength. You can look<br />
at it issue after issue and I guess the most obvious one<br />
is this Andrew's Army that I have to walk through in<br />
every public gathering I'm going to now. It's not<br />
surprising that the pilots, who wanted to wreck this<br />
economy, are turning up as Andrew's Army asking for a<br />
0 vote for Mr Peacock. very simple, because Mr Peacock<br />
didn't have the strength to take a tough decision. When<br />
questioned at your infamous press conference about his<br />
industrial relations policy, and will any of you ever<br />
forget that? I'm told it's etched indelibly in the<br />
memory of all of you. Aat that press confrece and an<br />
associated one, he said it's not for government to get<br />
involved government shouldn't have a role in settling<br />
these disputes, it's for the parties. In other words,<br />
let the pilots use their strength, get their thirty<br />
percent. in these issues there comes a time when<br />
leadership requires a capacity to make tough decisions.<br />
It wasn't pleasant for me but I knew that I would be<br />
derelict to my duty to the Australian economy and the<br />
Australian people if I didn't after pleading with them<br />
to stay in the system then say right, if you're not<br />
going to do that, then we have to resist you. Now, the<br />
result as I say day after day, Andrew's Army out there. </p>
<p>7<br />
% page<br />
it's not surprising, they would be silly not to because<br />
he supported them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Hr Keating calls him a souffle.<br />
PH: No I don't really want to get into descriptions<br />
about him. I'll go to the issues and I'll talk about<br />
that one I just have. That's not an opinion, that's a<br />
f act. And there is not one commentator in Australia who<br />
doesn't recognise that it we'd given into the pilots, as<br />
Xr Peacock would have, that the Australian economy was<br />
ruined everyone knows that. There come issues when<br />
you've got to have strength and make the tough decisions.<br />
We've done it. OK last one and that's..<br />
JOURNALIST: Given your strong on equal opportunity<br />
at work, why has it we haven't had a woman in Cabinet for<br />
two years, and if you win a fourth term will you look at<br />
some more women in the Ministry?<br />
S PH: The question portrays, with respect, either a<br />
lack of understanding or refusal to acknowledge the<br />
processes. You say will I put someone in. You ought to<br />
know, you've been around long enough to know, that I<br />
don't make the appointments.<br />
JOURNALIST: You had some influence on Margaret Reynolds?<br />
PM: To the extent that I had any marginal influence, I<br />
mean I to the extent I had any marginal<br />
influence, it was along the line you're asking. But in<br />
the end the composition of the ministry is determined by<br />
the Caucus. Let me say I don't have to apologise for my<br />
Party in terms of their commitment to the numbers of<br />
women in the Parliament. We are increasingly having more<br />
women in the Parliament and that's a good thing. I hope<br />
that in the election for the fourth Hawke Ministry that<br />

JOURNALIST: On the Marlin matter, Mr Bowen did an<br />
interview last night on television which seemed to cast<br />
some doubt on whether he approved of the idea of showing<br />
confidential documents to Mr Peacock. Have you talked<br />
about that with him? Secondly, senator Richard Alston<br />
claims that you must have known about this matter back in<br />
December when Bowen went through the processes of..<br />
PH4: Let me go to the second part first then obviously it<br />
is covered by it. I said we don't discuss these matters,<br />
I made it before, we neither confirm nor deny these<br />
matters and you don't expect me to do that, On the third<br />
part of your question, there was of course discussion<br />
with Mr Bowan before I made the offer yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: What documents have you asked to be made<br />
available? Are they actual NCA.. </p>

PM: You're not really serious about that question. I<br />
have said that I neither confirm nor deny. So I've said<br />
if he wants to look and see if there are docum~ ents then<br />
do it. OK.<br />
