I am pleased to announce that the President of Portugal, His Excellency Mr Jorge Sampaio, will visit Australia from 20 to 26 May, travelling to Darwin, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.<br />
Portuguese explorers were amongst the first European visitors to Australian shores.  More recently Australia enjoys a warm, expanding and contemporary relationship with Portugal.  Our collaboration has provided essential support for East Timor';s successful transition to independence.  East Timor remains an important element of our shared and growing interests.  President Sampaio';s visit to Australia and my opportunity to meet with Portuguese Prime Minister Durao Barroso in Dili during East Timor';s independence celebrations, underscore this joint commitment to East Timor and to broader bilateral collaboration.<br />
Portugal and Australia have much to offer each other and I welcome President Sampaio';s visit to Australia.  Mr Anderson, as Acting Prime Minister, will meet President Sampaio in Canberra.  I look forward to meeting the President in Sydney on 25 May on my return from China.</p>
