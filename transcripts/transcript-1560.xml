FOR PRESS: -4R P. M. No. 44 -/ 1967<br />
STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE MEETING BETWEEN<br />
AUSTRALIAN MINISTERSQ AND THE MALAYSIAN<br />
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak,<br />
who 4s visiting Australia as a guest of the Australian Government, today<br />
attended a meeting of the Foreign Aff airs and Defence ' Committee of Cabinet.<br />
The meeting followed a Ministerial luncheon hosted by the Australian Prime<br />
Minister, Mr. Harold Holt.<br />
The discussions reflected the wide range of common interests<br />
and the close association which have developed between Australia and Malaysia<br />
over a number of years. The two countries enjoy mutual co-operation a<br />
sense of warm friendship and understanding. and a deep respect for each<br />
other ' s achievements and progress.<br />
Tun Razak said he was glad on this visit to express in person<br />
the appreciation of the Malaysian Government and people for the contribution<br />
which Australia had made with the other Commonwealth partners, Britain<br />
and New Zealand, to Malaysia's security. He said that the continuing<br />
presence of Australian. British and New Zealand forces. under arrangements<br />
which had the full consent and co-operation of his Government. remained a<br />
valuable factor in the stability of the region. At the same time, it was<br />
Malaysia's intention to continue to strengthen its own national capacity for<br />
defence. The substantial programme of Australia's defence aid had been of<br />
great value in the expansion of Malaysia's defence forces.<br />
Australian Ministers informed Tun Razak that they believed<br />
that the provision of defence aid in the form of giving equipment for<br />
Malaysia's newly-formed military units. the temporary secondment of<br />
Australian personnel, and the training of Malaysian personnel in Australia<br />
was a particularly valuable form of co-operation 4n the security field.<br />
They welcomed the considerable progress which Malaysia had already<br />
achieved in building its own defence capacity.<br />
An agreement was reached in the discussion that an Australian<br />
technical mission should visit Malaysia in the near future to examine<br />
Malaysia's future requirements. Australian Ministers gave an assurance to<br />
Tun Razak that they were aware of Malaysia' s need for continuing assistance<br />
in this field and, within the limits imposed by competing demands on resources,<br />
would extend the defence aid programme until the end of 19701, the termination<br />
date for Malaysia's present expansion programme.<br />
Tun Razak referred to the great difficulties created for<br />
Malaysia by the low prices for rubber and also to their large requirements<br />
for external finance to implement the first Malaysia Plan for social and<br />
economic development. He expressed appreciation of the developmental<br />
aid already given by Australia and hoped that this could be continued and if<br />
possible expanded in the future. </p>
<p>r 7 The discussion noted that the increasing and widening<br />
contacts between the two countries extended into many fields, including<br />
growing trade and business connections and tourism. Ministers noted that<br />
there were at the present moment in Australia some '~ CColomboP lan<br />
students from Malaysia studying in Australia as well as several thousands<br />
of private students. These, with the many thousands of Malaysian students<br />
who had received training and education in Australia over the years, added<br />
an important chapter of their own to the story of the relations between the<br />
two countries. The discussions included a general review of pdlitical and<br />
strategical developments in South East Asia. Tun Razak x~ viewed the<br />
progress that had been made in restoring Malays ian/ Indones ian relations<br />
and the possibilities of a wider framework for co-operation. Malaysia and<br />
Australia are both members of two new organizations in the region. the<br />
Asian and Pacfic Council ( ASPAC) and the Asian Development Bank and there<br />
was a useful exchange of views on developments in these organizations.<br />
With respect to Viet Nam. it was agreed that South Viet Nam<br />
had the right to maintain its independence and to self -detex. mination and to<br />
invite its allies to assist in its defence. Tun PRazak pointed out that because<br />
of her own inteznal security problems, Malaysia could not help with troops.<br />
Hcwever, Malaysia had extended support to South Viet Nam in other ways and<br />
in particular provided training of officers in development and administration.<br />
Tun Razak drew attention to the white papers issued by the Malaysian<br />
Government which described the close relationship between communist<br />
activity Jin Sarawak and West Malaysia and similar activity in South Viet<br />
Nam and North East Thailand. It was agreed that there was a need for<br />
constant vigilance if the stability of the region was to be preserved and if<br />
the countries of the region were to be able to press on with the great tasks<br />
of national construction with better and widening opportunities for their<br />
peoples. CANBERRA, 13th April, 1967. </p>
