Jj4AUS-. 1lA! I( A j4 PRESS STATEMENT NO. 132<br />
24 SEPTEMBER 1973<br />
FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs said today that the Australian Government had<br />
formally and officially informed the Registrar of the<br />
International Court of the nuclear tests conducted by<br />
France at Mvururoa Atoll in July and August and had<br />
pointed out that, in the view of the Australian<br />
Government, this constituted a breach of the interim<br />
measures order made by the Court on 22 June.<br />
Mr Whitlam. said that although he still hoped<br />
that the French Government would make a formal<br />
announcement that its test series had ended, he<br />
understood that this was not the intention of the<br />
French Government. Hie was, however, prepared to<br />
assume that the lifting of restrictions as from<br />
September indicated that the current series of<br />
tests had in fact concluded..<br />
The Prime Minister said that he accordingly hoped<br />
that this would lead to the lifting of the constraints<br />
that had been imposed by Australian trade unions on<br />
commercial and economic relations between Australia<br />
and France. Mr Whitlam emphasised that the Australian Government's<br />
firm position was one of continuing opposition to the<br />
conducting of atmospheric nuclear testing. The<br />
Australian Government had all along made this plain to<br />
the French Government and would continue to do so.<br />
