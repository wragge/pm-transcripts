AU8~ L<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 7 MARCH 1986<br />
The following is an extract of the statement delivered<br />
to the Australian Permanent Representative at the United<br />
Nations, Geneva, H. E. Mr. R. H. Robertson, to the United<br />
Nations Commission on Human Rights, 5 December 1986.<br />
" Human rights violations in Eastern Europe are of<br />
great concern to the Australian Government and<br />
people. A number of minority and ethnic groups,<br />
notably those in the Baltic area of the Soviet Union,<br />
have been subjected to repressive measures for the<br />
non-violent expression of their cultural and<br />
religious convictions. The Australian Government<br />
believes firmly that the basic right of freedom of<br />
expression should be available to all peoples.<br />
Similar principles are at issue in relation to the<br />
Jews in the Soviet Union who are denied the right to<br />
emigrate to Israel. We have noted with satisfaction<br />
the release of Anatoly Shcharansky, but consider that<br />
this should not distract attention from the need for<br />
the Soviet authorities to adopt a more flexible and<br />
humane approach to Soviet Jews wishing to emigrate, a<br />
fundamental right of all citizens.<br />
We also cannot overlook the systematic harassment in<br />
Eastern Europe of certain groups whose views differ<br />
from those of the authorities. Charter 77 of<br />
Czechoslovakia and similar groups in the Soviet Union<br />
whose stated aim is to monitor violations of the<br />
Helsinki Accord in their own countries are cases in<br />
point, as too are academics and trade unionists in<br />
Poland.<br />
The continuing violations of human rights in<br />
Afghanistan which have resulted from the efforts of<br />
the Soviet Union and the present Afghan Government to<br />
subjugate that country's people are of great concern<br />
to this delegation. The description of the human<br />
rights situation in that country contained in the<br />
interim report of the Special Rapporteur prepared forthe<br />
40th session of the General Assembly, is deeply<br />
disturbing. It is regrettable that the Afghan </p>
<p>authorities have so far refused to cooperate with the<br />
Special Rapporteur in his work. We find particularly<br />
disquieting reliable reports we have received of<br />
cases of torture and imprisonment for lengthy periods<br />
of alleged political opponents of the incumbent<br />
regime. We note and share the Special Rapporteur's<br />
conviction that the prolonged nature of the conflict<br />
increases the seriousness of the gross and systematic<br />
violations of human rights in Afghanistan." </p>
