<p>In Kuala Lumpur the Prime Minister spoke to Graeme Dobell about</p>
<p>   how the Asian crisis has given APEC a reality check.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's the inevitable impact particularly on the less</p>
<p>   developed members of the Asian economic downturn. The remarkable</p>
<p>   thing is that APEC has come through that period as strong as it</p>
<p>   has. And when you reflect on it, that there haven't been greater</p>
<p>   checks on APEC's progress and that there still remains, even</p>
<p>   in countries like Korea, for example, that have had to undertake</p>
<p>   enormous adjustment, there's still tremendous commitment, a</p>
<p>   quite sort of unconditional commitment to the goals of APEC.</p>
<p>DOBELL:</p>
<p>How hard a debate was it about the role that APEC should take in</p>
<p>   terms of debating the new financial architectures that the world</p>
<p>   is thinking about? Dr Mahathir, of course, has been talking about</p>
<p>   the need to have some controls on financial flows and APEC really</p>
<p>   was talking more about monitoring and transparency. How hard a debate</p>
<p>   was that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it wasn't really a hard debate because the overwhelming</p>
<p>   view is that you should monitor and promote greater transparency.</p>
<p>   There isn't a strong view that we should reintroduce controls.</p>
<p>   There isn't an argument for going back to something akin to</p>
<p>   Bretton Woods. I mean, those days are gone. Globalisation is a permanent</p>
<p>   part of the scene now. And Australia has benefited enormously, speaking</p>
<p>   from our point of view, from a flexible exchange rate. I mean, one</p>
<p>   of the reasons that we've been able to diversify our trade</p>
<p>   into North America and Europe is that we have got a flexible exchange</p>
<p>   rate. If we hadn't have had a flexible exchange rate that trade</p>
<p>   variation would have been a lot harder.</p>
<p>DOBELL:</p>
<p>In terms of what APEC should be doing to help rebuild, if the Asian</p>
<p>   crisis is perhaps bottoming, not necessarily turning around, what</p>
<p>   does APEC contribute?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well APEC contributes in a practical way. The Australian proposal</p>
<p>   to help countries like Thailand and Vietnam write basic laws in</p>
<p>   relation to things like bankruptcy and to improve the quality of</p>
<p>   their financial and their economic governance, they're the</p>
<p>   sort of things that we can do. And we in Australia, in particular,</p>
<p>   can do better than most because we have a prudential banking system,</p>
<p>   we have a very sound legal system, we're politically and economically</p>
<p>   stable and we're trusted and we have a lot of expertise to</p>
<p>   offer and all of those things are important. And they're the</p>
<p>   sort of practical level things that we can do.</p>
<p>DOBELL:</p>
<p>And, finally, do you think that Vice President Gore wandered into</p>
<p>   his own recalcitrant row with Malaysia because he was talking to</p>
<p>   an American domestic audience rather than addressing a set of Asian</p>
<p>   issues?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you'd have to ask Vice President Gore that. I will speak</p>
<p>   for Australia. Australia made its position known about Dr Anwar</p>
<p>   and expressed concern about what was happening to Dr Anwar before</p>
<p>   any country in the world, not just in the region. I think I was</p>
<p>   saying things about that before anybody else, certainly anybody</p>
<p>   else in the region. We haven't wavered from that. But the Australian</p>
<p>   way is to talk to Dr Mahathir, to say to his face that we have concerns,</p>
<p>   to listen to his response and to indicate by doing it that way that</p>
<p>   we place considerable store on the relationship between the two</p>
<p>   countries, not the relationship between me and Dr Mahathir Â</p>
<p>   leave personalities out of it. There's an Australian national</p>
<p>   interest in having a good relationship between Australia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>   Now, 150,000 Malaysians were educated in Australia. We sell a lot</p>
<p>   to the country. We've had a long historical association. Now,</p>
<p>   I think I got the balance right. Nobody in the region, least of</p>
<p>   all Dr Mahathir, is in any doubt as to what I think and the concerns</p>
<p>   I have because I told him and I told him in the Australian way and</p>
<p>   that is to his face.</p>
