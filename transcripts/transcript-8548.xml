ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
TO THE HONG KONG AUSTRALIA BUSINESS ASSOCIATION<br />
SYDNEY, 18 JUNE 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I'm pleased to have the opportunity to address the Hong<br />
Kong Australia Business Association.<br />
As this country increasingly looks toward Asia for its<br />
future we will need organisations like this one.<br />
We'll need you to promote business.<br />
We'll need you to establish the networks of<br />
communication, trade and investment essential to our<br />
integration with the region.<br />
We will also need you to promote the id~ a of Australia<br />
engaged in Asia.<br />
And it's not jiz= a in Asia that we need to promote it.<br />
We need to promote the idea he=: because Australians,<br />
by and large, have yet to fully grasp the dimensions of<br />
our opportunity in Asia, or the imperatives which<br />
accompany that opportunity.<br />
We simply haet seize the time in Asia and, quite<br />
simply, we can.<br />
But it is one of the lessons of the success of the Asian<br />
Tiqers indeed it is a lesson to be learned from<br />
successful countries around the world that there has to<br />
be a conscious, concerted, national effort.<br />
The nation has to know what the goals are, what the<br />
rewards will be, and what is required.<br />
Your example will help in that educationnl process. </p>
<p>And I hope you will take every opportunity to<br />
proselytise. Asia is where our future substantially lies, but we won'It<br />
secure the future without effort.<br />
We can't assume that our presence on the margins of the<br />
most rapidly growing economies of the world is an<br />
historical accident to replace that other one, called the<br />
British Empire Asia will not serve as a substitute for<br />
the imperial security blanket.<br />
It is not like a reef of gold or a mountain of iron ore<br />
which needs only to be mined. It's not just a matter of<br />
sending in a railway line and some earth-moving<br />
equipment.<br />
We won'It wake up one morning and f ind ourselves riding on<br />
Asia's back as we used to ride on the sheep's.<br />
It will require, as I said, a conscious national ef fort.<br />
We will have to adjust our thinking and increase the rate<br />
of our work.<br />
We'll have to think of ways into these markets, which<br />
means being clever as perhaps never before, bold as never<br />
before, tenacious as never before.<br />
At this stage we are not doing badly.<br />
If our economy is not yet so international and open as<br />
Hong Kong's, it is much more so than it was a decade ago.<br />
We have radically opened it up in the 1980s.<br />
If we are not yet as competitive and dynamic as the<br />
Tigers, the floating of the dollar, reduced protection,<br />
wide ranging micro-economic reforms, the transformation<br />
of our industrial relations system and a responsible<br />
fiscal policy have given us a chance to play in the same<br />
league. We now export more than twice the volume of goods we did<br />
at the beginning of the eighties.<br />
And the composition of those goods has shifted markedly<br />
to manufactures and services.<br />
It can also be said that if our economic imperatives are<br />
still imperfectly or inadequately understood, they are<br />
much better understood than they used to be.<br />
I think perhaps the economic education of Australia has<br />
been one of the more remarkable developments of the last<br />
decade. </p>
<p>In 1992 Australians know that we cannot prosper by a<br />
policy of exporting commodities and maintaining<br />
inefficient industries for a small domestic market behind<br />
a tariff wall.<br />
They know the realities including, in principle, the<br />
reality of Asia.<br />
What they need, I think, is the confidence and your<br />
association can be an important supplier of that.<br />
These have been hard times revolutions of the kind we<br />
have been going through are bound to be.<br />
But the reward will be contributing to and sharing in the<br />
prosperity of Asia where in the last year the Newly<br />
Industrialising Economies grew by 7.1 per cent, compared<br />
with the OECD average of 1.1%<br />
The reward is nothing less than the maintenance of our<br />
standard of living and our way of life.<br />
The reward is the future of Australia.<br />
And there are reasons for confidence.<br />
Already nearly 55% of our exports go to the Asian region.<br />
We are in a position of considerable strength.<br />
Our GNP is equal to the combined GNP of all the ASEAN<br />
countries. We have a skilled, well educated and flexible work force.<br />
We have a high degree of political and economic<br />
stability. We have things which the region wants like raw<br />
materials, but also technologies and manufactures, skills<br />
and services, and space.<br />
Our trade with Hong Kong is a good measure of how well we<br />
are doing.<br />
Our bilateral trade with Hong Kong has grown three-fold<br />
in the past decade and Kong Kong is now our seventh<br />
largest export market.<br />
Hong Kong has become an important investor here.<br />
Last year it was our second largest source of migrants.<br />
As the centre of the " Greater China" growth triangle,<br />
Hong Kong now offers Austral-an buis-i ies-a new frontier<br />
of opportunity.<br />
There have been significant recent changes in the region. </p>
<p>4<br />
As wages have increased in Hong Kong and Taiwan,<br />
manufacturing has shifted to the coastal provinces of<br />
China especially the Guangdong and Fujian provinces.<br />
I'm sure you are familiar with most of the facts and<br />
figures, but they are worth recording in an Australian<br />
context. They speak eloquently of the challenge which we<br />
face. Up to three million workers in Guandong province are<br />
employed in factories owned by Hong Kong manufacturers.<br />
With the aid of Taiwan's and Hong Kong's capital,<br />
technology, management and marketing skills, Guangdong<br />
has built a dynamic economy with real GNP growing by<br />
12.40 per year from 1980.<br />
Hong Kong, of course, is a gateway to China, its 1.1<br />
billion people, and its increasingly vibrant private<br />
sector.<br />
China is now Australia's ninth largest export market.<br />
Hong Kong's growing role as a financial and services<br />
capital for China represents major opportunities for us.<br />
Again, there are reasons for confidence:<br />
in the example, for instance, of AOTC which has been<br />
granted one of the licenses to operate a second<br />
generation mobile telephone network in Hong Kong.<br />
-Or in the new airport and port development there,<br />
where Leighton Industry is tendering.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen-<br />
What is presently happening in Hong Kong and China is<br />
happening in other parts of Asia, and the opportunities<br />
for Australia are replicated throughout the region.<br />
Intra-regional foreign investment has rapidly increased.<br />
The NIEs are now important foreign investors in their own<br />
right. Intra-regional foreign trade has expanded.<br />
Major developments are underway or being planned to<br />
improve the infrastructures.<br />
Economic growth in Asia is increasingly being driven by<br />
demand within the region itself.<br />
That is why, as everyone here knows, we mnust become a<br />
part of it. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that this dynamic progress in Asia will<br />
continue into the next decade.<br />
But there a= a uncertainties.<br />
The greatest of them continues to be the risk of a<br />
breakdown in the Uruguay roundj of the GATT.<br />
A breakdown in the Uruguay Round has the potential to<br />
create regional trading blocs in North America and<br />
Europe. We face the prospect of revisiting a world with<br />
a fortress mentality. I<br />
Hong Kong and the other Asian economies have shown the<br />
benefits of a free trade policy.<br />
We in Australia share their beliefs, and we have a common<br />
interest in voicing these beliefs in international<br />
forums. It is not only because of enlightened self-interest, but<br />
also because we share a common conviction that<br />
unrestricted bilateral trade is the best way to foster<br />
economic development in the developing countries.<br />
The APEC process is one forum where we can pursue these<br />
goals. We should remember what the reality of APEC is:<br />
over the past twenty years the share, of our total<br />
exports to APEC countries rose from 54 per cent to<br />
73 per cent.<br />
in the same period the EC's share fell from 21 per<br />
cent to 12 per cent which, as from last year, is<br />
less than the volume of our trade with the ASEAN<br />
countries alone.<br />
in fact our trade with ASEAN is now greater than our<br />
trade with the United States.<br />
APEC has become the major regional economic and trade<br />
forum and it will became an increasingly important<br />
instrument for promoting regional trade liberalisation.<br />
That is why I have proposed a process for periodic APEC<br />
Heads of Government meetings.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
As part of the continuing process of internationalising<br />
the Australian economy an essential undertaking if we<br />
are to succeed in Asia in the One Nation statement I<br />
announced that we would issue more foreign bank licenses,<br />
and allow foreign banks to operate as branches for<br />
wholesale banking and acquire smaller banks. </p>
<p>By these measures we intend to more closely integrate<br />
Australia with the Asia Pacific economies by taking on an<br />
increasingly substantial role as a regional financial<br />
centre. In One Nation I also announced that we would allow the<br />
taxable income derived from pure off-shore banking<br />
transactions by an authorised off-shore banking unit in<br />
Australia to be taxed at the reduced rate of 10 per cent.<br />
The Government realises that if it wants to facilitate<br />
the development of the industry in Australia it must<br />
broadly match the concessions in other major centres.<br />
Our concession will be generous. For example, it will<br />
apply to the profits from trading with non-residents in a<br />
large range of financial instruments ( including foreign<br />
currency) and to the fee income received from credit<br />
support activities.<br />
We intend to introduce the legislation next week. I<br />
think you will see then that the Government has provided<br />
tax measures conducive to the development of a viable<br />
off-shore banking centre, while taking measures necessary<br />
to protect the domestic revenue base.<br />
These initiatives, I believe, recognise the unique<br />
character of off-shore banking as a highly specialised<br />
activity distinct from the core business of the banking<br />
sector. They number among the fundamentals we have to get right.<br />
They demonstrate our commitment to the long term.<br />
Hong Kong, of course, has been enormously successful in<br />
establishing itself as an off-shore banking centre.<br />
Our stable economic and political system, our location in<br />
the right time zone, our skills, our increasingly close<br />
links with the region, and our competitive taxation<br />
arrangements mean that we have the potential to make a<br />
success of the same business.<br />
I think it is appropriate also to note that the<br />
Government will continue to support the high degree of<br />
autonomy promised in Sino-British Joint Declaration for<br />
this autonomy is the key to maintaining stability,<br />
prosperity and human rights in Hong Kong after 1997.<br />
Australia and Hong Kong have initialled an agreement<br />
which will protect Australian investments in Hong Kong<br />
until at least 2007.<br />
China will formally approve this agreement before it is<br />
signed. Ladies and gentlemen </p>
<p>The Government recognises the important role played by<br />
small and medium sized businesses, and we have<br />
implemented a number of reforms and programs designed to<br />
address the structural impediments which face them.<br />
Our aim is to promote the creation and growth of<br />
competitive enterprises by removing regulatory and other<br />
impediments and providing appropriate assistance at<br />
critical stages.<br />
The reforms, which address priority issues such as<br />
taxation, export development, access to finance, and<br />
business skills and enterprise development will help<br />
small business to take advantage of new opportunities as<br />
the economy recovers.<br />
We have recently taken a number of other steps to promote<br />
our economic integration with the region.<br />
The National Trade Strategy which the Government launched<br />
last November established an integrated and consistent<br />
framework in which to pursue trade and investment in East<br />
Asia. Austrade's overseas resources have been re-allocated to<br />
reflect the high priority we place on supporting<br />
Australian business in the region.<br />
In One Nation we announced a further increase in their<br />
funding. In February the Government issued a follow-up to the<br />
Garnaut Report which seeks to anticipate future<br />
developments in South-east Asia and so prepare us to take<br />
advantage of the opportunities they present.<br />
We are undertaking in consultation with the private<br />
sector and state governments a major study of trade and<br />
investment in Asia.<br />
It also serves our economic purposes that an increasing<br />
number of Australian students are studying Asian<br />
languages at secondary and tertiary level.<br />
There are now 34 centres or institutes of Asian studies<br />
at Australian universities, and there is a growing number<br />
of educational exchange programs between Australian and<br />
Asian universities.<br />
Our schools are changing the curriculum to reflect<br />
changes in the community, the evolving requirements of<br />
government and business, and the ground-swell of interest<br />
in the societies of the region. </p>
<p>8<br />
All these things bear testament to our commitmentthough<br />
they do not, as a few critics have suggested,<br />
reflect any willingness on our part to compromise our<br />
social and political values.<br />
As I said in a speech in Sydney early in April, and as I<br />
re-iterated while in Indonesia, our traditions of<br />
democracy, our notions of social justice and personal<br />
liberty are not negotiable.<br />
Indeed, the more confident we are of what we stand for,<br />
the better we will do in Asia and, I believe, the rest<br />
of the world.<br />
To be ambivalent about identity will only weaken us.<br />
Part of that identity these days comprises our nondiscriminatory<br />
immigration policy and the principles of<br />
cultural tolerance enshrined in multicultural social<br />
policies. This of course is a significant change: not so long ago<br />
we were known in the world for discrimination and<br />
intolerance, particularly towards Asia.<br />
The change we have made, which now sees us known in Asia<br />
for our openness, seems to me a proof of our ability to<br />
make the other necessary adjustments.<br />
Because the nation's future quite literally depends on<br />
it, few things press so urgently on the Australian<br />
Government as the need to create the right environment<br />
for Australian trade and investment in Asia.<br />
But the Government's capacities stop short of meeting the<br />
ultimate challenge.<br />
That responsibility falls to business itself.<br />
Australian business ii making considerable progress, and<br />
it's really not for me to tell those who are making it<br />
what else they might do.<br />
But it does seem to me that our cultural diversity equips<br />
us extraordinarily well, and we can probably turn it to<br />
greater account than we are presently doing.<br />
our Asian migrant community, through small business<br />
networks, is making considerable progress in opening up<br />
new avenues of trade and consolidating commercial links<br />
with all parts of the Asia-Pacific.<br />
Personal familiarity with the linguistic, cultural,<br />
religious, geographic and national differences of these<br />
markets constitutes a genuine advantage for the<br />
Australian economy. </p>
<p>It follows that Australian firms might do well to draw<br />
upon the wealth of language and cultural skills in their<br />
own workforces not just in Asia, of course, but in<br />
Europe and the Middle East.<br />
I think it will become very clear in the next few years<br />
that there is a greater reward to be reaped from our<br />
immigration and multicultural policies than we have<br />
hitherto imagined.<br />
And I think it will be all the greater if we recognise<br />
and ensure that nothing in those policies compromises<br />
our identity or our loyalty to this place.<br />
As we become more Asian in our economic and geopolitical<br />
orientation we will do well to become more undividedly<br />
Australian in our thinking and in the image we project<br />
abroad. That, I believe, will herald not a more parochial<br />
Australia but a more sophisticated one a more confident<br />
and a more successful one.<br />
So, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Hong Kong<br />
Australia Business Association for the initiative they<br />
have shown and for the vanguard role they are playing in<br />
Asia, not only on behalf of their members, but on behalf<br />
of Australia.<br />
And I thank them for inviting me here today. </p>
