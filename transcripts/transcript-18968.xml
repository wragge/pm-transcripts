<p>Australia grieves with America today following the mass shooting of primary school children and teachers in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Like President Obama and his fellow Americans, our hearts too are broken.</p>
<p>We share America's shock at this senseless and incomprehensible act of evil.</p>
<p>As parents and grandparents, as brothers and sisters, as friends of the American people, we mourn the loss of children, aged only five to ten years, whose futures lay before them.</p>
<p>We mourn the loss of brave teachers who sought only to lead their students into that future but were brutally murdered in a place of refuge and learning.</p>
<p>Our thoughts today are with the people of America.</p>
<p>We hold in our hearts the families who have lost loved children and who face grief beyond measure. We think of the families of the teachers.</p>
<p>And we hope for the recovery of those injured in body and spirit.</p>
