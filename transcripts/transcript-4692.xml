PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT Embargo 6pm. EST1<br />
Interview with Richard Thwaite, Tokyo ABC<br />
21 April 1978<br />
QUESTION: Mr Fraser, what do you hope will be Japan's response<br />
to the propositions you are putting to them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think I'm looking for a response in<br />
terms of having hard, practical and firm results coming out<br />
of these discussions. They are against the background of<br />
the broad international situation, ' and also having in mind<br />
very much the major international trade discussions taking<br />
place this year that are involving the developed world and<br />
developing countries, and against our view that there needs<br />
to be success at these talks. We run the risk otherwise of<br />
ending up the year with developed countries fighting amongst<br />
themselves for a greater share of existing markets, a good<br />
deal of disillusion between the developing and developed<br />
countries. The great problem that we all face is how to<br />
expand market opportunities in trade without unleasing renewed.<br />
inflationary pressures. The purpose is to explore every<br />
possible avenue of achieving that.<br />
QUESTION: Are you making specific suggestions yourself on<br />
how that can be done?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm certainly making suggestions about the<br />
trade negotiations taking place, and I think one of the most<br />
important things is to make sure that agriculture remains a<br />
constructive part of those discussions. When these discussions<br />
have taken place in the past, it has generally ended up by the<br />
major industrial nations deciding " agriculture is too hard, so<br />
we' 11 just make some arrangements, some adjustments, which<br />
will help trade in manufactures." If that happens this time<br />
it's not really going to do anything to promote an expansion<br />
of world trade. You've only got to take account of the fact<br />
that with agriculture and commodities excluded, you've got<br />
to exclude the internal EEC trade, because that's not affected<br />
by these matters. The proposals on industrial goods affect<br />
less than 20% of world trade, and then the proposals themselves<br />
are very modest, and they'd end up by being about a half percent<br />
tariff reduction a year over 8 years starting from 1980.<br />
Now I don't believe anyone can really think that that of itself<br />
is going to do much to expand markets and hence to expand<br />
world trade.<br />
QUESTION: The Japanese themselves are very sensitive on the<br />
question of agricultural trade. Have you had any-response<br />
from them at all specifically on agriculture?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we haven't been talking about bilateral<br />
issues. I have a very strong view that Japan believes that<br />
agriculture must be part of the total negotiations', just as<br />
industrial goods should be. But I think in the past the main<br />
stumbling block for that has been European policies.<br />
QUESTION: What kind of market expansion are you really looking for?<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well you're looking for the circumstance in<br />
which markets can expand so that there is work for our<br />
factories, for our mines, for the products of our farms,<br />
and unless that happens there is going to be continuing<br />
high unemployment in many many countries. We're not looking<br />
at this just from the national Australian point of view,<br />
although obviously if you get an expansion of market<br />
opportunities Australia will benefit, all countries will<br />
benefit. And if you don't get that you are left with the<br />
position in which we're arguing about the cut up of existing<br />
markets and that can advantage one country for a time over<br />
another, but it's not going to solve the economic problems<br />
that we all face at the moment. </p>
