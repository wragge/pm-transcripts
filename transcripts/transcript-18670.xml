Australia and Indonesia today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the transfer of four Australian Defence Force C-130 Hercules aircraft to Indonesia.</p>
<p>The signing follows the Prime Minister's offer in November of last year to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to transfer up to four aircraft to Indonesia.</p>
<p>Australia is very pleased to make this contribution to Indonesia's airlift capability, which will support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.</p>
<p>The C-130 heavy lift transport aircraft will contribute to Indonesia's capacity to respond to natural disasters and humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>Indonesia will fund all refurbishment and ongoing maintenance costs associated with the aircraft.</p>
<p>The signing ceremony took place shortly after President Yudhoyono's arrival at the Royal Australian Air Force Base Darwin today for the second Australia-Indonesia Annual Leaders' Meeting.</p>
<p>Minister for Defence Stephen Smith and his Indonesian counterpart, H.E. Dr Purnomo Yusgiantoro observed the signing of the MoU by Chief of the Australian Defence Force General David Hurley and Secretary General of the Indonesian Ministry of Defence Air Marshal Eris Herryanto.</p>
<p>The C-130H gifting reflects the strength of the bilateral Australia-Indonesia relationship and close ties between the Australian and Indonesian Defence forces.</p>
<p>Minister Purnomo and Minister Smith also held bilateral talks at Headquarters Northern Command, located at Larrakeyah Army Base in Darwin.</p>
<p>The discussions focused on bilateral defence engagement and the critical role Indonesia and Australia play together in contributing to regional security and addressing global challenges, including through the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting-Plus.</p>
<p>Australia and Indonesia are also working to bolster coordination on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief through the East Asia Summit framework. </p>
