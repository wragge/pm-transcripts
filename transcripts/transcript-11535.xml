<p>E&amp;OE......................</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh a little bit but I've had a busy day. I've seen both the British Prime Minister and the Chancellor. And I've just been to a dinner attended by the head of just about every major bank in much of Europe and people who are intensely interested in Australia's economic future and very keen to invest in our country and very grateful of the opportunity to talk not only to me but also to four of the state premiers. We are all over there together as ambassadors for Australia. Political differences were put to one side. We were all out there promoting Australia.</p>
<p>And what's very important about this week is the opportunity it affords to me in particular to talk about the investment opportunities in Australia. And you've got to remember that the British invest more in Australia than any other country except the United States. So it's a very important week in that sense as well as of course the historic significance.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right, you're going to be in the House of Commons today I heard at Question Time. It is this day, July 5 is it not, 100 years ago that the federation bill passed through the House of Lords?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's correct, yes and that's why it's being celebrated and why there is a special thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey. It's why there's a special banquet out on by the City of London. The British have gone to a great deal of effort to honour Australia Week, an enormous amount of effort.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Are the Londoners and the Poms are aware that it's Australia week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well a lot of the ones I meet are. I mean there's 11 million of them, I don't speak to all of them. I mean the reality is that the Government and a lot of people are certainly aware of it, have certainly gone to great trouble. But we're taking every opportunity we can to promote Australia. You should never take traditional associations for granted. We've not only, there's a great Arthur Boyd exhibition at Australia House. We've got a very heavy emphasis on the Australian cultural achievement and all of these things are very distinctive and identifiable to the British. They know the special character of Australia's cultural contribution and I think an occasion like this is an opportunity to mix the advocacy of one's relevance in the modern financial world as well as emphasising some of the history.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>It is valid to argue isn't it that Australians know more about Phar Lap than they do about Parkes, Deakin and Barton?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's probably right for a lot of Australians but I suppose it's probably right also to say that a lot of Americans know more about Babe Ruth than they do about Thomas Jefferson. I don't think we should assume that we are Robinson Crusoe when it comes to that. So, but I think we are getting more interested in our history. People are a lot more inquiring I find. I mean look at the young who gathered on Gallipoli.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes we're getting a lot better.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In their thousands.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do you think sometimes we're growing older without growing up? I mean there seems to be though a certain pettiness at work in relation to this trip. For example, a 17 year old girl is today or tomorrow is going to play in the semi final of Wimbledon. I think it would be fantastic for a girl from the western suburbs if her Prime Minister was there watching her perform. Two great Australians are going to perform in quarter finals today. It's coincidence I know but most probably you won't be there because you fear vilification if you go.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as it happens I've got a huge number of business engagements tomorrow but I've been asked this question and I don't rule out the possibility if the opportunity permits itself, and I agree with you that people should get encouragement from their elected leaders. And it is coincidence and if I do find that I can go, well, I will think it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>A quick one before I let you go to bed. On a different issue- there has been a lot of talk that you would face pressure in London from international newsagencies over restrictions on their Olympic coverage. Has that matter been raised with you yet or is it to be raised with you by Foreign Minister, Robin Cook?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it was raised with me briefly tonight by the head of Reuters who incidentally was one of the many significant business figures who came the dinner I addressed. And he has had a discussion with Bob Carr about it because of the SOCOG connection. And I said we're happy to talk about it. This is a decision that's been made in relation to the administration of the Games with SOCOG. It's not something on which I was consulted of course. But I said that he should pursue it with SOCOG. He said that the Premier had indicated that he'd talk to SOCOG about it. And if it's raised with me well that will be the sort of response I give.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>You are aware of the problem, I'm sure?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm aware of the fact that the international press think they're being discriminated against.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes, that's right. That they've not paid for exclusive rights and non-rights holders.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand the point but I also got to understand that there were some combination of administrative reasons why SOCOG wanted to do it this way. I will certainly facilitate discussion between SOCOG and the international newsagencies with a view to seeing if the thing can't be ironed out. But in the end SOCOG has got to make the decision. Although naturally it's been raised with me because it effects Australia internationally and the Foreign Secretary may or may not raise with me but in any event it's been raised by the head of Reuters, one of the news people effected.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right and just before you go. July 5 is the day. Now what is specifically set aside for celebration on July 5?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're asking me in relation to the centenary of federation?</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes, in relation to this particular day, July 5. Is there some special status about those celebrations? Is there something special that you'll be involved in as a result of that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll be involved in a number of things. I mean tomorrow I've got a whole series of things. I've got to, there's the, I'm actually meeting the Leader of the Opposition, William Hague tomorrow. That's not in honour of the 5th of July. I'm certainly going to the House of Commons. I'm certainly going to the Cenotaph in Whitehall and then I'll be going along with all the former Prime Ministers to a banquet in the Guild Hall. So it's going to be quite an extensive evening, quite an extensive day.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Good on you. Go and have a sleep. Good to talk to you. Prime Minister John Howard. There we are.</p>
