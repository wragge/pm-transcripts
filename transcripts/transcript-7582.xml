PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, CABOOLATURE TAVERN, CABOOLTURE<br />
27 APRIL 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can you tell us the results of<br />
your trade talks with Vice-President Quayle yesterday?<br />
PM: The Vice-President is now very well acquainted with<br />
the facts of the adverse impact upon Australia of the<br />
operation of the Export Enhancement Program. I think<br />
he had the belief until he'd spoken to me that the Export<br />
Enhancement Program was not adversely affecting Australia,<br />
that is was something not targetted at us but particularly<br />
at the Europeans. I repeated to him what I'd had cause<br />
to say before and that is if a bullet hits you in the<br />
head it hurts just as much if it was not aimed at you<br />
as if it was aimed. I was able to give him the statistics<br />
of the very adverse impact on our wheat trade of the<br />
operation of the Export Enhancement Program. If you<br />
look at seven countries, export markets that we have<br />
which are EEP targetted, and those seven countries are<br />
China, the Soviet Union, Egypt, Iraq, Mexico, Sri Lanka<br />
and Yemen. Those seven countries have been targetted<br />
by the EEP and in those seven we've suffered a very significant<br />
loss of our exports. In the case of two of them, in<br />
maJor areas, in the Soviet Union a 91% reduction in our<br />
exports in the period of the REM and in the case of China<br />
a 21% reduction in our exports. Now those sort of things<br />
are not figments of imagination, they are cold, hard<br />
and brutally hurtful economic statistics which have adversely<br />
affected our farmers, our wheat farmers. I have given<br />
those to Mlr Quayle, now he knows them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the Vice-President give you any assurances<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: He said well look I'm very interested in what you've<br />
told me. taking it on, board and I think now that<br />
we'll have a voice over there which is much better acquainted<br />
than it was before with the adverse impact upon this<br />
country, an ally of the United States. than that important<br />
individual was before. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you think talking on that issue may<br />
have won you a new trade aly in Mr Quayle?<br />
PM: in terms of the negotiations that are going on under<br />
the Uraguay Round I think we have a position as a result<br />
of Australia's leadership of the Cairns Group that the<br />
United States is going to be joining with us in the processes<br />
which are calculated to bring about a reduction through<br />
time of the subsidies and support systems which have<br />
corrupted the international system. So I think we're<br />
going to get that support but what we want to see is,<br />
consistent with that action and argument which they will<br />
produce in the international area, a consistency in what<br />
they do in their own farm bill and in associated budget<br />
pueasures. We will continue to put to them the need to<br />
ao that.<br />
0 JOURNALIST: raised with Vice-President Quayle and<br />
raised? PM: of course that came up and the basic point of course<br />
was that there was recommitment by myself on behalf of<br />
Australia to ANZUS and whatever New Zealand may or may<br />
not do following from that speech of Mr Lange's in the<br />
United State. 1 our mutual comitment, that is of the United<br />
States and Australia to the Treaty remains undiminshed.<br />
One doesn't know as a matter of fact if anything additionally<br />
will flow from Mr Lance's speech. I mean I'm not here<br />
to intervene in New Zealand politics but one would have<br />
to say there is a great degree of uncertainty as to whether<br />
after the speech anything else happens.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you considering an election before January<br />
of next year?<br />
PM: That's off the agenda, that's been settled.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any suggestion that you could act<br />
as a broker between the US and New. Zealand on this question<br />
of ANZUS?<br />
PM: No, I've made it clear from the time that New Zealand<br />
made the decision it did to exclude United States' vessels<br />
that we disagreed with their position. New Zealand has<br />
no doubt as to what our positionli. We've continued to<br />
have bilateral defence exercises and relationships with<br />
New Zealand, we'll continue to do that. So really nothings<br />
been changed by the speech. It seems to be sitting out<br />
there in a rather aberrant fashion. The speech had some<br />
interesting thing. In it but no certainty that it means<br />
anything in a sense of any additional action. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: you stole the seat of Fisher in the<br />
last election from the Opposition<br />
PM: Stole?<br />
JOURNALIST: Now you've goL IL, -can you keep it?<br />
PM: How do you moan ' stoie') How do you steal a seat?<br />
JOURNALIST: Most people would suggest that this should<br />
be a National Party seat, it traditionally has been.<br />
you've got it now. Can you keep it?<br />
PM: It's not good looking at electoral politics in Queensland<br />
in terms of history and in terms of previous predominance<br />
of the National Party. The National Party is going to<br />
be battling to survive anywhere. They are very very<br />
much a diminished force. We had the good fortune in<br />
Fisher of two things, a Government and a Prime Minister<br />
with a very good record and secondly an outstanding candidate<br />
in Michael Lavarch. Now, you talk about the next election.<br />
You'll still have the outstanding Government and Prime<br />
Minister, an even better record, but you'll have not<br />
a new candid-ate, Michael Lavarch, but a man who will<br />
have been a Member for one full ter%~ and who in that<br />
period has proved himself an outs tarngly good and effective<br />
Member. So as far as Fisher is concerned, bye bye Nat.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Button said today that he believes<br />
that the Government is walking a tightrope in regards<br />
to interest rates and the deficit. Do you agree with<br />
that? PM! There's nothing new about that being said, whether<br />
it's by John or by anyone else. I mpan it's been said<br />
many times by me anck by others, you're Walking thiat line<br />
in which you have to have a level of interest rates,<br />
a tightness of monet. ary policy calculated to gradually<br />
bring down the high level of activity which is bringing<br />
in an unsustainably high level of Imports, but not to<br />
do that for such a period or with such intensity that<br />
you move back towards a recessionary situation. So there's<br />
nothing new in what John said. This is a question of<br />
considered, calculated and tough policy management and<br />
we've shown ourselves capable of doinig that in the past<br />
and we'll continue to.<br />
JOURNALIST: if an clecLion was held now that you'd<br />
lose and if there's an election to be held some time<br />
In the near future you'll have to come from behind. </p>
<p>PM: I don't accept your interpretation of it. I haven't<br />
heard what he said and so I'm not going on any second<br />
hand reports. But to talk about an election now is so<br />
hypothetical as to be ridiculous.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree though you'll have to come<br />
from behind?<br />
PN: We would win an election at the present time on<br />
the most recent polls.<br />
JOURNALIST: Dick Woolcott has found overwhalming support<br />
tar your proposal for ~. tuuamk1181t agi. 5nal deal. Do<br />
you see the ministers of the relevant countries meeting<br />
later this year?<br />
PM: On all the evidence that's available to me from<br />
the reports from Mr Woolcott which have been coming back<br />
regularly, it is the case that there is very considerable<br />
support for my initiative and it does look as though<br />
we will be able to have a ministerial meeting before<br />
the end of this year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hiawke, are you concerned th~ at a Power's<br />
trophy you're presenting this weekend is going to infuriate<br />
liquor trade unions in Queensland and also flies in the<br />
face of State ALP resolutions?<br />
PM: i've seen some reference to that but I thought the<br />
best comment that was made was by someone who said that<br />
if I presented the Elders Cup it didn't mean that I'd<br />
embrace John Elliott.<br />
ends </p>
