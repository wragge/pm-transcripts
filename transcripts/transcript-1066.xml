FOR PRESS P. JM. No 21/ 1965<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
I have written to the Premiers proposing a<br />
meeting for the purpose of reviewing the financial assistance<br />
grants to the States. The present arrangements were worked<br />
out in 1959 between the Commonwealth and the States, and<br />
were given effect on the understanding that they would carry<br />
on for a period of six years. This period terminates on<br />
June. Ordinarily I would wish to have the replies<br />
of the Premiers before I mention dates publicly. But<br />
since some details of my proposals for a conference have<br />
become known, I feel that I should confirm that the<br />
particular dates I have suggested to the Premiers are 22nd<br />
and 23rd April.<br />
CANEPdRA, 23rd February, 1965. </p>
