FOR EDIA9 JULY 1985<br />
Australia's delegation to the World Conference marking the<br />
end of the United Nations Decade for Women left for Nairobi today.<br />
I wish the delegation well for this important conference being<br />
held to review and appraise achievements for women since<br />
1975 and to lay the foundations for strategies to raise<br />
women's status during the rest of this century.<br />
The delegation is lead by Senator Patricia Giles who<br />
has been active in women's affairs for many years and has<br />
played a prominent role in the preparatory meetings for<br />
the Conference. Senator Giles is also Convenor of the<br />
Caucus Status of Women Committee. The other members of<br />
the delegation have been chosen to provide a range of<br />
backgrounds and skills. I am confident they will make the<br />
best possible contribution to the work of the Conference,<br />
particularly in our aim of achieving consensus on the major<br />
Conference document, " Forward Looking Strategies for the<br />
Advancement of Women". This document will form an<br />
important basis to develop further our policies for the status<br />
of women in Australia.<br />
In addition to Senator Giles, the members of the delegation<br />
are Dr Helen Ware, ( Deputy Leader) Acting Assistant Secretary<br />
Office of the Status of Women, Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet;<br />

widely distributed after the Conference is concluded. </p>
