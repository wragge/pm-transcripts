PRIME MINISTER's SPEECH AT SAN NICOLA BALL, PERTH<br />
19 APRIL, 1975<br />
Thank you very much indeed for the very kind words that<br />
you have used about me and my wife. It is a very great<br />
pleasure again to be guests of the Association of San Nicola<br />
at the Annual Ball.<br />
The last time I was your guest was three years ago and on<br />
that occasion I remember undertaking that if I was translated<br />
from Leader of the Opposition to Prime Minister, I would see<br />
that people who had migrated to Australia, were placed in<br />
as good a position as people who-had always lived in Australia.<br />
In particular,' I remember promising that if anybody in<br />
Australia had-an age, or an invalid or a widow's pension,<br />
then he or she would be able to continue to receive that<br />
pension wherever he or she went to live in the world.<br />
That is, you wouldn't lose the pension if. you left the<br />
country. You earned it, you received it.<br />
Now I realise that it will be a long, long time before any<br />
of you are interested in pensions. But, nevertheless, it<br />
was something that we were able to carry out.<br />
There were some other things we wanted to do for migrants.<br />
We were not satisfied that the interest, the respondibility<br />
of the Federal Government for migrants, ceased when they<br />
arrived in Australia. We wanted to see that when people<br />
came to Australia, they would be happy to remain here, they<br />
would be happy to become citizens and they themselves would<br />
prove the Very best advocates for other people to come to<br />
Australia. We didn't think it was good enough for the<br />
Government always to be looking for migrants. The best<br />
people to persuade migrants to come to Australia, were<br />
people who themselves had migrated to Australia and had<br />
found it a good place to live.<br />
It has given my colleagues and me, the very greatest<br />
satisfaction that the number of people being naturalised<br />
in Australia, is almost double what it was three years ago<br />
and the number of people leaving Australia, is only half<br />
as many as it was three years ago.<br />
To give you an indication in this city of what we have<br />
tried to do. Quite early in the peace, in February, 1973,<br />
we established a migrant education centre in Wapet House,<br />
in St. Georges Terrace. This was to make it easy for people </p>
<p>to learn English if they wanted to. There are other things<br />
which are being done to see that people at work, or women<br />
at home, are able to learn English easily.<br />
To take something more recently In March last year, we<br />
established in Perth the telephone interpreter service,<br />
which means that anybody who is not familiar with English,<br />
is able to ring up the telephone interpreter service and<br />
seek advice about his problems. The Department of Social<br />
Security in Perth now has people, welfare officers, on its<br />
staff, who can speak Italian. Of course, there are others<br />
who can speak other languages as well. I emphasise Italians<br />
because they are the people who have come to Australia in<br />
greatest numbers after the British and the Irish. Of all<br />
the people who have come to settle in Australia, the British<br />
are the most numerous, the Irish are the next, and the Italians<br />
are third.<br />
The last census in June, 1971, showed that at that time,<br />
there were 289,000 people living in Australia who had been<br />
born in Italy.. Moreover, there have been 160,000 Italian<br />
citizens who have been naturalised as Australians in Australia<br />
so far. It is a remarkable record. The number of people who<br />
have come here and the number of people, who coming here,<br />
have decided to become Australians.<br />
In Western Australia, in particular, Italians came earliest<br />
arnidg hti n frthoem tghree atbeesgti nnniunmgbe rosfu . E urTohepreea n wesreet, t leofm encto urisne , A usIttraalliiaan. s<br />
There was-an Italian in the First Fleet that Captain Phillip<br />
took to Sydney, and there some in the Gold Rush, of course,<br />
later on in Victoria and New South Wales. But until abouta<br />
or 40 years ago, the greatest percentage of Italia-lis in<br />
any of the States was in Perth, Western Australia. Most<br />
in Perth, but of course, there were gold miners and there<br />
were timber getters and so on in the country as well. There<br />
is no doubt that Italians have felt that Australia is one of<br />
the most attractive countries to go. There are very few<br />
countries in the world to which Italians have gone in such<br />
miurbers. I believe it is true to say, there is no country.<br />
in the world where Italians have felt so much at home and<br />
have been so successful.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, we want you to be happy here. We<br />
want you to be the great advocates * for other people to come<br />
to Australia, because people are happiest in Australia, if<br />
they already have friends and relatives who are happily<br />
established here. </p>
<p>S 3.<br />
We have made it easier to become citizens. The same conditions<br />
apply to people from all parts of the world who want to be<br />
citizens. There are the same qualifications, the same period,<br />
three years required, and we have made all the conditions easier.<br />
Some of the things which used to be done to discriminate against<br />
migrants, have been abolished. It used to be possible, for<br />
instance, for anybody who had fallen foul of the law, to be<br />
deported if he was a migrant. That is no longer possible.<br />
There are no double penalties. There is no discrimination.<br />
We have set up in each State, committees, task forces, to make<br />
sure that there is no discrimination against any migrants, any<br />
particular community within the whole community. In this State,<br />
that task force is chaired by my colleague, Mr. Jo Berenson,<br />
the M. P. for Perth.<br />
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a very great<br />
pleasure once again to be your guest. I am happy to be able<br />
to come to you and say that I carried out the promises that<br />
I made the last time I was your guest. </p>
