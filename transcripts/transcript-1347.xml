PRIAE MINISTER'S VISIT TO U. S. AND U. K.<br />
Speech given by the Prime Minister, ] Er. Harold<br />
Holt, to the American-Australian Association<br />
at the River Club. New York. July, 1966.<br />
Thank you very much, MTr. President He nmanson, and<br />
greetings again Governor Dewey, other distinguished guests and<br />
gentlemen. I don't suppose there are many places around the world<br />
where an Australian public figure can feel more at home than he<br />
does when he comes into this room. You have reminded me that I have<br />
had not only many free meals here Randal, but very pleasant ones<br />
and to come back to you after a number of years in which I have<br />
been Finance Iiiin ister of the Commonwealth and be able to say to<br />
you, despite all, that they elected the old so-and-so unanimously<br />
Prime Minister of Australia is a matter of great satisfaction to<br />
me. Randal, your presence in this chair is a further<br />
reflection of the warm-heartedness and friendship for Australia<br />
of the American people. are out-nmbered, iaagine to the<br />
order of at least seven, if not 10 to one, in this company today<br />
by citizens of the United States. But that did not prevent them<br />
recognising the wonderful work you have done in support of that<br />
great man who laid so much of the basis of the co-operation<br />
which has come to Australia from this organisation Floyd Blair.<br />
They did not hesitate to look to you for the succession<br />
when Floyd passed on and I refeat here publicly the<br />
congratulations which I sent you privately at the time and I say<br />
what a gracious gesture it was on the part of those whose<br />
numbers were justified in maintaining an American in the chair,<br />
that they recognised your own devotion to the purpose vhich this<br />
organisation can so usefully serve.<br />
Now you are all busy men and you don't want to hear a<br />
lot of introductory comment from me but I shall tell you what I<br />
have in mind to do in the time at our disposal. I gather it is<br />
a little more elastic than usual because you are all expected to<br />
be on holiday in any event. It is not only flattering to find<br />
you coming along in such good number but reflective of the<br />
growing sobriety , temperance and tolerance of the peo," le of this<br />
great democracy that so many of you are here in good shape and<br />
apparently having come through the July 4 week-end almost<br />
unscarred. But we couldn't help in the date arrangement because<br />
i was heimed in by the opening of SEATO last Monday ( June 27)<br />
and I have to be back in Australia for Btdget discussions which<br />
we will be having in our Cabinet in lit u.Ã± e riore than a week's<br />
time, with London ahead of LIe in between. It is rather<br />
reflective of the shrinking world in which we live. </p>
<p>Earlier in the year, I relmemaber having answered<br />
questions in the House of Representatives up to 11.15 one<br />
m-rorning and the next morning I was talking to our troops in<br />
Saigon. It is actually a shorter distance fromi Darwin to Saigon<br />
than it is from Brisbane to Perth. Your Dean Rusk was out with<br />
us at the SEATO Conference. The next time I looked him up he<br />
was talking to somae group, I think, in Korea. Anyhow he was<br />
around that area of the world and although on the map there seem<br />
to be great distances between us, we are all these days<br />
remarkably close to each other. But even so, it is useful to<br />
hbave the word from those who have come froma the sp. ot.<br />
I am not going to talk a lot about Australia because you<br />
have had in recent times two people who have, I am sure, spoken<br />
in quite enthusiastic order of my country. Sir Henry Bolte, the<br />
Premiier of Victoria, is always capable of stating with enthusiasm<br />
the prospects for his own State and indeed for the nation as a<br />
whole. Ie have a fellow who has succeeded quite remarkably in<br />
represtnting three countries at oncewith the same devotion. That<br />
is a chap named Clark who speaks with the same enthusiasm for the<br />
United States, for Australia and for Texas, all of whom he<br />
represents very ably indeed. So you don't want too much about<br />
Australia but let me just say these few things quickly in passing.<br />
vve have just had the first Y. ajor drought for just on 210<br />
years, People had al~ iost begun to forget what occurred when you<br />
had a drought. In other areas it is som~ ething of a rarity in<br />
these more recent years but this one was a quite serious drought,<br />
particularly in New South * iales and Victoria. On our latest<br />
assessment the sheep population had fallen from 170 million to<br />
157 million in the whole of Australia a drop of about 8 per<br />
cent which means that New South qales caught it a good deal<br />
harder than that. The cattle population of that State, which is<br />
not one of the great cattle areas of Australia, dropped by just<br />
on 25 per cent.<br />
Now~ that all sounds pretty serious but the matter<br />
worth recording for you is that we have just closed our 1965-66<br />
fiscal year and I think our export receipts are within a<br />
" Coo-eel' on just the wrong side. But they are very close to<br />
being on the right side of the record export receipts that wie<br />
have ever gained. That was in a quite fabulous year, 1963/ 64-,<br />
when everything seemed to go right. If we can just about touch<br />
that figure in a drought-affected year, vith rural income down<br />
very considerably, that demonstrates how the diversification<br />
of the Australian economy has taken a lot of the fluctuation out<br />
of our eco-iomic affai-rs.<br />
e hardly felt these fluctuations, employment remained<br />
high all the time, there was a little dampening of customer<br />
demand, particularly whore, say, farrm equipment wvas to be s. old<br />
and that radiated out to the consumer area generaliy. Right<br />
through it all, erpl%. yment was sustained at what you would<br />
regard, I' m sure, as an over-full employment level, -,,* hich has<br />
become pretty well standard with us in good times something<br />
just over one per cent of registrations of the work force. </p>
<p>The other thing that was interesting out of it was the<br />
balance of payments. Ve had thought when we brought the Badget<br />
down last year th., at they would show a substantial reduction by<br />
the end. of the fiscal year. Some commentators put the figure as<br />
. high as about dollars Australian 400 million but we thought in<br />
the Treasury it could be up to dollars Australian 200 million.<br />
The result, thanks to a strongly sustained capital inflow, plus<br />
this good export experience and some drop in the level of iriports,<br />
is that we have b. en able to keep our reserves just about where<br />
they were 12 months ago, and that means in a very co-fortable<br />
position for us.<br />
Now the drought has left open the opportunity for a much<br />
larger aereaWfor wheat this year. The land is rested and the<br />
farmer looking for a quick cash crop in order to retrieve some of<br />
his losses is turning to wheat for which there is a very strong<br />
demand around the world, The acrcagunder wheat is expected to<br />
rise from 16.9 to about 20.7 million acres.<br />
Now I don't want to say anything very much more about<br />
the Australian situation other than perhaps a word on capital<br />
inflow. Some of you may have been concerned about this when<br />
restraints were recommended in the United States and more<br />
recently when a programme of monetary restraint was indicated by<br />
the Govermnent of the United Kingdom. I have always held the<br />
view myself that, provided the bait is strong enough or<br />
attractive enough, the capital will come to the bait. There are<br />
so many of you in this room that will know from the activities<br />
of your ovn organisations that the bait is still a very<br />
attractive one.<br />
Capital inflow has, in point of fact, been at a record<br />
level through the 12 months just under review. It is continuing<br />
quite strongly and indeed as some of these project3 have come<br />
into fruition and as the quite exciting story that will be told<br />
of them around the world iakes itself more widely known, I<br />
believe that this capital investment will tend to increase<br />
rather than diminish.<br />
The reflection of that which may interest you is to be<br />
found in the Inigration inquiries we are receiving. ue nevcr<br />
looked to this country because it is a very prosperous country<br />
and opportunities abound here, but we are now receiving thruugh<br />
our New York ofrice and through our San Francisco office,<br />
immigration inquiries at the rate of 1000 a week each in those<br />
two offices. Quite considerably in excess of what we have known<br />
previously. Nsw I don't want anyone to interpret this as an<br />
indictment of the Admbinistration. I assure you it is nothing of<br />
the sort. It is reflective of this growring appreciation t1--at<br />
here, in this vast continent the size of your own if you put<br />
Alaska temporarily to one side, in this vast continent , dith just<br />
under 12 million people and with so much developing and<br />
happening of proiis3 for the future there is an exciting<br />
opportunity for the kind of frontier experience, of getting in<br />
on the ground floor of national development that you have known<br />
through so much of your history. " e welcaTme this development.<br />
Indeed, when I get backI'll be asked what our Administrative<br />
arrangements are. I know it must be straining the present<br />
resources of the two Consulates-(. eneral and, once the inquiries<br />
begin, we certainly don't want to lose the interest of those </p>
<p>who have been attracted by this possibility. I can't imagine,<br />
other than our ovwn people from the British Isles, any people<br />
that would miore readily and agreeably fit into the Australian<br />
scene than the enterprising migrant from this country.<br />
Now we haven't been relying entirely on your capital<br />
inflow because 90 per cent of fixed capital investment has come<br />
from our ovn resources. We vithold 28 per cent of our gross<br />
national product from current consumption for fixed capital<br />
investment that is only surpassed by Japan. Your ov.' n figaiis,<br />
I think, 17 per cent and the United Kingdom about 15 per cent.<br />
So we are doing something for ourselves but the remaining 10 per<br />
cent is quite critical because it is in that area that you get<br />
the large projects, the new developments, new skills, new<br />
enterprises and we welcome that flow continuing.<br />
However, that is not what I came here principally to<br />
talk about to you today because we share the concern and the<br />
sense of importance that so many thoughtful people in this country<br />
have about the situation in Viet Nam.<br />
This importance and public interest is reflected in the<br />
amount of attention given to it by all the news media and public<br />
discussions. Because of the nature of medern reporting and the<br />
episodic narrative account of day-to-day developments the<br />
resulting picture in South Viet Nam is, I believe, incomplete ard<br />
indeed misleading. I had the first experience of spending soime<br />
time there just a few months ago, and w,, hat I found on arrival was<br />
so different from what I had imagined in my ovwn mind from what I<br />
had been reading day to day, that a misleading impression must<br />
be held in the minds of a great many people and where discussion<br />
is critical of the administration policy.<br />
These days it is very much easier for public figures, and<br />
I don't say this disparagingly, I'm one myself, to get the public<br />
attention by criticism than by commendation. Good news is no<br />
news, in the minds of sa. e of those who are looking to attract<br />
a public interest.<br />
The result is that very few people, even if they know<br />
a good deal about the griamer side of the war in Viet Nam, have<br />
any awareness firstly of the positive, constructive and helpful<br />
things that are going on there affecting the general comrkunity<br />
and far less of the amazing developments which have been<br />
occurring in the surrounding area of South-East Asia under the<br />
shield and security of the American presence in South Viet Nam.<br />
But that is a story chich I've been trying to speak of<br />
since I came here to the United States. It wasn't that I had<br />
in mind to talk about principally when I came, but encountering<br />
this atmosphere this apparent unawareness of what your ijresence<br />
in South East Asia has meant to people like ourselves who live<br />
in that area I felt it was time that somebody had something<br />
to say about it and it is very hard to get something recorded<br />
about it. If I were wanting to get some notice taken of me in sonm<br />
sectins of the press of this country, I'd buy a six-feet pieoe<br />
of canvas or calico and print somethirg abusive about your more<br />
prominent people and go and hold it somewhere. Now that would<br />
almost assure me of front page presentation in the most august<br />
journals of this democracy. </p>
<p>I saw a picture the other day, a front page picture<br />
of Dean Rusk addressing the National Press Club in Canberra and<br />
behind were a little band, I think of six or eight young<br />
people from the Australian National University. I had seen them<br />
around quite a bit. I think they were there when Hubert Humphcry<br />
came: They were there at the time when Sir Robert 1ivenzies opened<br />
the National Library and I was there to help him along, and there<br />
they were standing in the background with this same little banner.<br />
And if they were to conduct a public hall meeting with<br />
the views they were wanting to express on the banners, they<br />
would ' t fill th1e 0INst couple of rows, but they will got more<br />
notice taken of them by some sections of the press than by a<br />
spokesman for your country or far mine when we choose to discuss<br />
t ese matters quite soberly. So let's get a more balanced view,<br />
not merely of what is happening day by day but of the total<br />
situation there.<br />
I've read the criticism as a public man I'm not<br />
unaccustomed nor resentful of criticism but I find no<br />
alternative prograe presented to that which has coravended itself<br />
to three successive Presidents in your country and to two<br />
successive Prime Ministers in mine and one of those Prime<br />
Ministers a man who had been there for 16 years and knew<br />
something of what the world was about.<br />
I don't know how far in this company, gentlemen, it is<br />
necessary to talk about the situation there. Surely amongst<br />
the intelligent people I see around me, one doesn't have to argue<br />
the case about hether this is a civil war or whether this forms<br />
part of an organised coLmviunist penetration. The story that the<br />
Ky government can't run the place properly, and that South Viet<br />
Nam can't look after itself, completely overlooks the fact that<br />
for six years after Geneva there was very good progress made in<br />
that country, of a positive kind, and it was only when the<br />
national product had increased about 20 per cent while North<br />
Viet Najiis had fallen 10 per cent that you found this switch in<br />
tactics and the present campaign of aggression, subversion and<br />
infiltration developing from the north.<br />
Now these things are surely clearly perceived by people<br />
today. Surely it is equally well perceived that unless there is<br />
a substanital force, whether it be the United States in company<br />
with allies, or a grouping, as I believe it should be, of those<br />
powers that you in unparalleled generosity helped to place on<br />
their feet in Europe after their period of trial had passed<br />
whichever way it is handled, qite clearly, unless there is that<br />
strength in Asia, then you can hand Asia over to the Chinese<br />
communists and proceed to deal with a very much smaller and<br />
narrower world of the future.<br />
But who in his senses would turn his back on half of<br />
mankind 1 billion people East of Suez with their population<br />
growing, not only assisted by their natural fertility but by the<br />
fact that their public health measures are now keeping alive many<br />
people who would have died either from famine or disease at<br />
earlier points of time. Ve can't ignore, no matter how<br />
indifferent we may choose to be, the fact thait there is going<br />
to be a population explosion there. That there is likely<br />
to ue doubling of that 1-2-billion by the end of this century and,<br />
if we are wise, we will try to help the people of the area<br />
through their problems. will try to help them take advantage<br />
of what modern technology can accomplish. </p>
<p>I can say as one coming fro,] the area that they are<br />
anxious to do more for thermselves. How much do you read about<br />
it? 4-dho knows of the recent developments in relation to the<br />
Asian Development Bank for example a billion dollars becoming<br />
available for assistance through the area with this country<br />
putting up a couple of hundred million dollars, Japan a couple<br />
of hundred million, even my small country 85 million dollars<br />
towards that fund.<br />
Who hears about the meeting of ASPAC? The meeting of<br />
ASPAC at Seoul a few weeks ago was no doubt briefly reported but<br />
the significance of this gathorig of nine Asian countries was<br />
riot brought out. Yet most of the countries represented at Seoul<br />
not so very long ago were engaged, as we were, with Japan in<br />
conflict. This conflict threatened to destroy my own country and<br />
theirs. Our trade with Japan today is four and a half times what<br />
it was in the early 1950' s. Now you may turn to the project of<br />
the .' ekong Valley, the Indus wiaters Projects, the positive<br />
programme which the military forces in each of these countries<br />
and in South Viet Nam in particular include now as part of their<br />
regular progrmi.; es of civic action, of rural development, of<br />
village security and village development these are now accepted<br />
as Dart of the necessary programmes of military forces in every<br />
part of this area.<br />
Would we have had the quite dramatic re-orientation of<br />
Indonesian policy if there had not been the growing realisation<br />
around Asia that the United States was firly resolved to stay<br />
there in Asia, resist comm-unist aggression where it found it,<br />
and assist the countries of the area to live co-operatively and<br />
with growing prosperity and security in the years ahead?<br />
, e have seen oountrics like Thailand emerge and prove<br />
most helpful in the recent negotiations with Indonesia.<br />
I know that you feel very lonely in this country at times,<br />
particularly as criticisms are spread from one area or another,<br />
but there are 34 countries giving aid in one form or another in<br />
South Viet Nan. Some are giving military aid, others material<br />
aid. I would hope that in Europe there would be a more faithful<br />
recognition of what is being done out there.<br />
I read a fine speech by former Premier Spaak the other<br />
day in which he paid his own tribute to A ierican presence there<br />
and chided his fellow Europeans that they were not doing more<br />
to help. Now I just want to add one thought or series of<br />
thoughts before I conclude what I have to cay. This relates<br />
to the search for peace. I believe that there is nobody more<br />
genuinely dedicated to the search for peace than the President<br />
of this country. I have talked with him, I have read his<br />
statements and I have heard what he has to say. There is no<br />
doubt in my mind that he is genuinely dedicated to peace, just<br />
as he is completely firm in his resolution that he is not going<br />
to turn his back on Asia and leave the chaos, the destruction<br />
which would flow from victory for Chinese coi. imunism there. </p>
<p>a* 7.<br />
Australia, on my own public statements and those of<br />
my colleagues, firmly supports American policy in South Viet<br />
Nam and recognises the contribution America is making to the<br />
stability and security, strength and progress in South East<br />
Asia generally. -e believe with your Administration that the<br />
search for peace must be genuine, persistent and imaginative.<br />
The world cannot go on indefinitely with those in<br />
opposing camps regarding it as made up of goodies and baddies,<br />
the description reversing according to which side you appen to<br />
be looking, All countries contain intelligent :: on and women<br />
capable of a realistic assessment of their own national<br />
situation and, indeed, of an international situation.<br />
The leaders of the communist world must be increasingly<br />
aware tma days that the hope for world wide response to<br />
communist propaganda and methods has failed to materialise.<br />
Indeed the past year has seen much significant movement in the<br />
other direction. Free world corrmunities do not aggressively<br />
impose their ways of life and forms of government upon others<br />
but I tink we need to give more attention to ways and means by<br />
which both the Iron and Bamboo Curt. airscan be made a little more<br />
penetrable and the interiors a little more accommodating.<br />
I am encouraged to come to this view because surely it<br />
is galling to the leadership both in Russia and China, having<br />
made sufficient technological progress to put man and satellites<br />
into space with impressive accuracy and, in the case of China,<br />
to develop a bomb and be able to make MIG aircraft, to find<br />
that the masses both in Russia and in China are still seriously<br />
short of many things, including the foodstuffs that they require.<br />
It .: ould certainly be a boon to them if more of their<br />
industrial cevelopment could be directed to peaceful purposes<br />
and I certainly believe it would be a boon to mankind if this<br />
would also happen in the freedo. u-loving countries of the world.<br />
It always rather saddens . ie that, wvhenever there is a<br />
serious discussion about ;-eace prospects, the stock exchange of<br />
New York seems to take that amiss or in an unkindly fashion.<br />
Down go the stock exchange values. This does not read too well<br />
around the rest of the world. Surel y it is possiJle for<br />
programmes to be available so that and I'm sure a great deal<br />
of planning and thinking has been done on this by your own<br />
Administration as peace prospects emerge ( as we would hope<br />
they would at a not too distant point of time) we do have in all<br />
our democratic countries the programmes for an era of peace that<br />
will carry our people further along the road to the security a. r<br />
wellbeing to , which we all aspire. that<br />
There are personal contacts at various levels/ can help<br />
towards a better understanding of seemingly hostile viewpoints<br />
and aspirations. Trade is, of course, one of the major methods.<br />
I know this is a controversial subject but there is normally a<br />
mutuality of interests and of benefits from trade transactions.<br />
Personal contacts are established on a basis of friendly exchanges<br />
or co-operation. 1e have traded freely with Russia and China<br />
in respect of wheat and wool and we do not see that this is more<br />
inconsistent than the line we took with Indonesia when we had<br />
troops in Borneo meeting the confrontation challenge. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Ve were looking to the point of time, which we believed to be<br />
not too far removed, when enough sanity would be restored to<br />
Indonesian Counsels to have them wishing to co-operative with the<br />
countries which could mean so nuch to their o n future and in an<br />
area of the world of great consequence to us.<br />
Tourism facilities for visits by journalists,<br />
eicouragement of visits by cultural and scientific groups these<br />
are minor ways to break the ice but there are a variety of other<br />
ways in which tho ice can be thawed unless vie are completely<br />
barren of hopc or imagination. I do not think any of us can<br />
afford to becoAe. so rigidly imbedded in an attitude that there<br />
they are and here we are and never the twain shall meet.<br />
I amL sure it would be tiv-ely for China to review where<br />
its current policies may lead. I say this because at this point<br />
of time we are on the threshold I believe of a new Asia growing<br />
in co-operation as it copes with this population explosion and<br />
China standing at a crossroad between a friendly and mutual<br />
beneficial associj. tion or a lonely path of persistent and<br />
hardening hostility.<br />
When I go to London I shall be expressing something of<br />
the concern I felt in Australia, lest there be a reduction of<br />
British interests in that area of the world. We are not looking<br />
for massive British forces there but we are looking for a<br />
continuing interest in the problei: ms of an area which, I thinl,<br />
not only forms part of one of the major upheavals in human<br />
history but an area, and with a body of people, that is shaping<br />
a new world order the limits of which can only be imagined.<br />
Modern technologies and a growing degree of co-operation can<br />
transform for hundreds of millions of people a future which, at<br />
the moment, is compounded of famine, of illiteracy, of poverty<br />
and of despair. So we have a prospect which your o-wn President sees<br />
quite clearly. e have welcomed his imaginative ap~ roach and<br />
I do not say that only of your own President it is the<br />
attitude of men of goodwill on both sides of politics in this<br />
country. There has been nothing in hiunan history to match the<br />
unparalleled generosity and vision which brought one of the<br />
turning points of history in the Marshall Plan for Amlerica to<br />
the world. I believe that your intervention in South Korea was<br />
another of the turning points in history. You have been<br />
following this up with enlightened policies in Asia or South-<br />
East Asia of which my o-n is one wvhich reoognise this, which<br />
are appreciative of it, which fecl grateful to the United States<br />
for what it has done and are determined to co-operate with it<br />
resolutely in resisting aggression, but helpfully and in a spirit<br />
of comradeship in the great constructive tasks which lie ahead<br />
for us all. </p>
