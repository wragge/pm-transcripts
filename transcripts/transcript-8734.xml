SPEECH BY THE PRXIME MINISTER, THE HON KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF ADVANCE AUSTRALIA FAIR, MELBOURNE CONCERT HALL<br />
18 NOVEMBER 199S,<br />
it's my great pleasure to be here tonight to enjoy this<br />
concert and, particularly, to take part in the launch of<br />
8 new arrangement of the AustralianNationalAnthem..<br />
I understand this is a curtain raiser for Australian<br />
Music Day celebrations on 28 November, and that over<br />
1,000 events promoting Australian music and artists have<br />
been arranged by Ausmusic for the month of November.<br />
The adoption of Advance Australia Fair marked a change,<br />
not just in the song we sang, but in the way we thought<br />
about ourselves.<br />
It has to be said that some people are more equipped for<br />
change than others.<br />
It's unfortunate when sometimes those who lack the<br />
imagination for it hold the others back.<br />
Too often in our history Australians have been held back<br />
and the changes that have been made in the last decade<br />
are proof of that.<br />
We have taken on more change in the last decade than<br />
perhaps we did in the previous forty.<br />
we do things very differently.<br />
We are more open to the world than we have ever been,<br />
more a part of it, more a player in its affairs.<br />
We are much more a part of our region.<br />
We are much more open and phobia-free.<br />
But we are no less Australian for the change.<br />
Notwithstanding~ the permanent barrage of American popularculture<br />
that we endure along with most other countries in<br />
the world, we have kept our best traditions. </p>
<p>ILL; iC.. 140V~ j If U2% Z., 1 U&amp; 4'<br />
2<br />
In fact I think we have etched them deeper.<br />
And we should continue to.<br />
When the idea of a distinctively Australian National<br />
Anthem was raised in the seventies, the people who<br />
instinctively shy away from change, Cried anarchy and<br />
treason, and sacrilege and blasphemy, and how dare you<br />
cause offence to our past and our cultural superiors.<br />
But those who welcome change when change is due<br />
persisted, and in due course they won bipartisan support,<br />
and now even if a lot of people still don't know the<br />
words we stand for our own national anthem and we are<br />
moved by it.<br />
The words go like this I learnt them a long while ago<br />
in a moment you will hear them recited much more<br />
tunefully. Now it's true that some of the words are a bit old<br />
fashioned.-and so are some of the sentiments.<br />
They come from an age when Australians felt that the<br />
richness and immensity of the land, combined with their<br />
love of it, guaranteed them a golden future.<br />
They are pre-industrial lyrics, and pre-multicultural.<br />
The second and fourth verses are so anglophile and<br />
Victorian they're almost pre-Australian.<br />
But the words of most national anthems are old fashioned,<br />
the British and the French Included.<br />
Both of those prattle on about scheming enemies and<br />
hateful tyrants plotting the overthrow of virtue.<br />
If nothing else Advance Australia Fair is more hopeful<br />
and less paranoid.<br />
It is my duty tonight to thank all those people who have<br />
taken Advance Australia Fair into the realms of a more<br />
modern world, and into, perhaps, the grandeur a national<br />
anthem deserves.<br />
In particular I want to congratulate Ausmusic and Lachian<br />
Wilson. I heard some of Lachlan's music at the recent laying of<br />
the wreath ceremony for Vietnam veterans, and I<br />
understand that that music was actually composed while he<br />
was on active service. </p>
<p>I also know that he is an old rock musician and that he<br />
was drawn to this project by a desire to make such an<br />
important expression of our national life more<br />
contemporary and more widely appreciated. And more<br />
easily played and sung.<br />
I thank Lachlan for his stirling efforts, and also<br />
Ausmusic for its initiative and follow through and<br />
among the latter I have to single out the irrepressible,<br />
inescapable and undeniable Executive Director, Pete<br />
Steedman. it's a great thing to have the new arrangement an even<br />
better one to have it published and recorded on CD and<br />
sent around our schools and other institutions, so that<br />
all Australians may come to know and take pride in the<br />
Australian National Anthem.<br />
So on behalf of everyone here I thank them all.<br />
As we go into the nineties and the next century we will<br />
need a bold and unmistakeable identity.<br />
we will do best if we have no doubt about who we are, and<br />
if we leave the world in no doubt.<br />
A re-vitalised and popularised anthem will help.<br />
There are a lot of Australians, I know, who retain some<br />
doubts about Advance Australia Fair.<br />
I'm not one of those. it touches a patriotic chord in me,<br />
as I think it does in most Australians. It is<br />
unmistakeably our anthem.<br />
I share with many Australians a sentimental attachment to<br />
Waltzing Matilda.<br />
But it is hard to sing solemnly about a jumbuk.<br />
if Advance Australia Fair is our National Anthem,<br />
Waltzing Matilda Is our national song and I think we<br />
should make it clear that it 1ia our national Song.<br />
There is nothing unusual in this. The United States has<br />
the Star Spangled Banner as its anthem, and God Bless<br />
America and America the Beautiful as its national songs.<br />
God Save the Queen is the British anthem, but Rule<br />
Britannlia and Land Of Hope and Glory, among others, are<br />
equally well known and inspire no less popular sentiment.<br />
So to those who say Waltzing Matilda is the definitive<br />
Australian song, I would say there is no reason why it<br />
shouldn't remain so.<br />
And no reason why it should not sung and played more<br />
often on public occasions. </p>
<p>4<br />
We can have both the formal anthem, and the popular<br />
song.<br />
And if those who have done such great works with the<br />
anthem feel there is something to be gained from doing<br />
much the same with waltzing Matilda, I'm sure all<br />
Australians would be delighted if they took on the task.<br />
Let me thank Ausmusic and Lachlan Wilson once again and<br />
all the performers the Australian Girls Choir, the<br />
Melbourne Youth Music Council and the Percy Grainger<br />
Youth Orchestra.<br />
We look forward to hearing the new improved Advance<br />
Australia Fair.<br />
And we look forward to singing it.<br />
Thank you. </p>
