    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />
Thank you Prime Minister  Thongloun for your warm and generous welcome.</p>
<p>I’ve just come from the G20  Summit in Hangzhou to join you in Vientiane to discuss a range of economic and  security issues of common interest.</p>
<p>
It is fitting that leaders from  11 individual yet inter-connected countries meet here today.</p>
<p>
The traditional Laos story of  the great gourd from heaven says that all people came from the same place. The  Lao people have handed this story down from generation to generation, and it  shows how every tribe is as worthy of honour and as significant as all the  others, because we're all brothers and sisters and come from the same place.</p>
<p>
This reflects both the  diversity of ASEAN that is its key strength and the proudly multicultural  nature of modern Australia.</p>
<p>
South-East Asia and its people  are part of the fabric that shapes and defines the Australian community and our  national identity. Over 1.3 million people who call Australia home were either  born in an ASEAN country or claim ASEAN ancestry. They have helped build our  nation and are a valued and respected part of the Australian family.  </p>
<p>
And so it is therefore only  natural that as ASEAN’s longest-standing dialogue partner, with our  relationship now in its 42nd year, Australia is deeply invested in ASEAN’s success.</p>
<p>
Today’s summit – the first  since we declared our Strategic Partnership – is an opportunity to pave the way  for our future cooperation.  </p>
<p>
Australia and ASEAN are close  partners by geography and by choice.</p>
<p>
Australia is committed to  remain a steadfast partner.  A partner for all seasons and far into the  future.  This commitment has been enduring and it has been bipartisan. </p>
<p>
Governments and leaders tend to  measure the value of relationships between countries in economic terms. But the  benefits of close personal links between ASEAN and Australian communities can’t  be measured by economic growth figures alone.</p>
<p>
Australia’s New Colombo Plan  was expanded to all ASEAN countries last year to make sure the next generation  of Australian and ASEAN scholars, leaders and entrepreneurs understand one  another.</p>
<p>
By the end of 2016, 10,000  young Australians will have studied, lived and worked in the Indo-Pacific  region under this plan, with half of those in ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>
Australia welcomed for its part  92,000 students from ASEAN countries last year, each of whom will develop  life-long connections to Australia.</p>
<p>
Australia and ASEAN’s future  security and prosperity will depend heavily on the region remaining peaceful,  secure and stable.</p>
<p>
And I note that where  territorial disputes exist, such as in the South China Sea, differences should  be settled peacefully in accordance with international law and until they are  we urge all sides to act with restraint and avoid any steps which will create  or add to tensions. </p>
<p>
That is why today, I will focus  on two themes at the heart of our common interests. The first is an  opportunity, our economic partnership. The second is a common challenge that  demands a united response, terrorism.    </p>
<p>
Both are central to our  Strategic Partnership. Both go to the heart of our national and collective  well-being, security and prosperity.  </p>
<p>
Prime Minister, the global  economy isn’t the predictable creature it was or at least we thought it was a  decade ago.  The Global Financial Crisis drove this point home loud and  clear.</p>
<p>
If we are to sustain prosperity  and continue to lift our people’s living standards, we must open new markets  and further reduce the restrictions that hinder the flow of our people, goods  and knowledge.   We must be innovative in the way we do business.</p>
<p>
Our private sectors – already  tightly enmeshed – have much to gain from each other and more engagement. We  have to resist the call of protectionism as we discussed in Hangzhou.  Protectionism is not a ladder to escape the slow-growth trap but rather a  shovel to dig it deeper and make the problems more retractable. </p>
<p>
Turning to the challenge of  terrorism. We are committed to working in partnership to strengthen regional  cooperation, in particular through the East Asia Summit, but also through the  ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus. </p>
<p>
And we recognise that the  threat of terrorism is a thoroughly transnational and global one. </p>
<p>
That is why I welcome the  adoption of the renewed ASEAN-Australia Declaration for Cooperation to Combat  International Terrorism today. </p>
<p>
Since our first declaration in  2004, the nature of terrorism in our region and globally has shifted  dramatically - not least in terms of online propaganda and encryption of over  the top messaging. Most of the commonly used online platforms and applications  did not exist at all twelve years ago.</p>
<p>
We know that ISIL wants to  expand its presence in South-East Asia, and this is of concern to us all. </p>
<p>
The latest ISIL propaganda is  further evidence that as it faces increased pressure in Syria and Iraq they  will attempt to seed fear and division in our communities.</p>
<p>
Our updated joint declaration  is a significant signal of collective political will to share our expertise and  stay ahead of this evolving threat.</p>
<p>
I look forward to discussing  with you my proposal for a special ASEAN-Australia Leaders’ Summit in 2018 –  bringing leaders of all South-East Asian nations to Australia together for the  first time.</p>
<p>
In keeping with the two themes  of today’s ASEAN-Australia Summit, a special summit in Australia would deepen  our economic partnership through closer links between ASEAN and Australian  businesses and the private sector, and bolster our strategic partnership.</p>
<p>
We are proud to be ASEAN’s Strategic  Partner; a substantial economic partner; an advocate of a peaceful, rules-based  neighbourhood; and a highly engaged participant in ASEAN-led regional  architecture.   </p>
<p>
I thank you for your invitation  to meet with you all today and I look forward to our targeted and practical  discussions of mutual interest to our countries. </p>
<p>
Thank you.</p>
<p>
