PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, LE SURF HOTEL, NOUMEA<br />
28 JULY 1990<br />
V OE PROOF ONLY<br />
Pm: Perhaps if I could just make a brief statement and<br />
then be available for your questions.<br />
I've had the opportunity last night and this morning to<br />
have extensive discussions with a range of<br />
representatives here in New Caledonia and I want, at the<br />
outset, to express my gratitude f or the opportunity<br />
that's been given and the frankness of the views that<br />
have been put to me. I must say that I've come away from<br />
those discussions with a great sense of confidence about<br />
the future of New Caledonia.<br />
The discussions I've had have been with the Minister,<br />
Monsieur Le Pensec, with Mr Jacques Le Lafleur and Mr<br />
Simon Loueckhote, with Mr Paul Neaoutyine and with Mr<br />
Leopold Joredie and Mr Richard Kalci. As you will see<br />
from that that covers the range of those involved as well<br />
as, of course, with the Mayor of Noumea. So I have<br />
spoken with the representatives of the French Government<br />
of RPCR and of the FLNKS.<br />
From these discussions I find a deep sense of commitment<br />
on the part of all those involved to making sure that the<br />
processes provided by the Mat ignon Accord are<br />
constructive and that they should lead to a situation<br />
where there is a maximisation of the chances of a<br />
peaceful resolution of the conflict which prior to 1988<br />
had racked this country.<br />
Most particularly there is an understanding of the need<br />
to ensure the maximum training of the Kanak population to<br />
ensure that they have an increased capacity to assume<br />
positions of responsibility in this country in the ranges<br />
of areas administrative, professional, technical.<br />
Australia has been pleased to offer its cooperation in<br />
this process and it is a matter of pride for us that we<br />
have now a number of people from New Caledonia undergoing<br />
training programs in Australia and I took this<br />
opportunity of reassuring all people with whom I spoke of<br />
the continuing commitment of Australia to assist in these<br />
processes. </p>
<p>2<br />
I also indicated in these discussions the commitment of<br />
Australia to increasing the relationships between our two<br />
countries and I believe as a result of my visit that we<br />
will see a significant improvement in this respect.<br />
. JL WM alow J= preaaod by the v-mninlent of all those to<br />
whom I spoke to not only improve the relationship with'<br />
Australia but also importantly to see New Caledonia<br />
playing an important role in this region.<br />
I repeat again in conclusion of these opening remarks the,<br />
great pleasure that I've had in the warmth of the<br />
wulcome, tho conatructivp nature Qf the discussions that<br />
I've been able to have with this great cross-section ot<br />
representatives of the New Caledonian community and to<br />
* 2cpreoo once again th commitment of Australia to playing<br />
a constructive part in the processes that are underway Iii<br />
this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you touched on it in your opening<br />
etatement. Row important is it to you as Australian<br />
Prime JNinister that the whole independence confliuL, iLr<br />
whatever you like to call it, is resolved peacefully and<br />
in the best way possible?<br />
PM: It's fundamentally important for two reasons.<br />
Firstly of course for the welfare of the people of New<br />
Caledonia. Really the people of New Caledonia by now as<br />
we go into 1990 have the opportunity of seeing two<br />
alternative avenues of resolution of conflict being<br />
followed. That is the pre-Matignon Accord which was<br />
characterised by conflict, bloodshed, death on the one<br />
hand, against that process which has been followed since<br />
1988 in which there has now been created a process<br />
whereby the fundamentals of creating the new relationship<br />
are being followed. These fundamentals have been<br />
reflected in these ways. The creation of a new<br />
administrative political structure. Secondly, the<br />
commitment to the rapid training of a large number of<br />
Kanakcs who are going to be able to take their place in<br />
New Caledonia. And thirdly, the creation of a better<br />
balance in the capacity to participate in the political,<br />
administrative and economic life of this country. Under<br />
this process there is, it seems-to me, a growing<br />
% xAmituent on the part ri? all those concerned to see a<br />
peaceful evolution to the point where in 1998 the<br />
decision in regard to the determination of the future of<br />
this country can be made. Now-having said that and<br />
having said that they are able themselves to see the<br />
rolative hpnpf its of this new process, I am under no<br />
illusion that there is an identity of view about Lhu end<br />
of that process. I understand that the RPCR adhere to<br />
their view about the future status of this country just<br />
as much as I understand that the FLNKS see the Matignon<br />
Accords as a process and a means to the end of achieving<br />
independence. It is my hope and of course let me preface<br />
what I have to say by the observation that the decisions<br />
to be made are for the people of New Caledonia and not </p>
<p>f or Australia or for anyone else. Making that preface I<br />
express the hope that in the eight years that remain<br />
before 1998 that the experience of working together<br />
politically, and in a sense perhaps even more importantly<br />
economically, may lead to the possibility of the<br />
emergenCA Of some consensus by 1998 as to the most<br />
appropriate decision to be made at the time. But<br />
clearly, if I could summarise that answer, the people of<br />
this country, as I say, have now had the opportunity of<br />
RAeing the alternative method of process that is strife<br />
and conflict, or cooperarion. As~ a i's aura they<br />
understand that overwhelmingly the latter is the way to<br />
go. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did any of the parties you met<br />
with today ask Australia to play a specific role in<br />
helping to solve the problems here?<br />
PM4: No. I think there's a very very mature<br />
uiideisanding betw. e,, us that is between the two<br />
Governments, and between ourselves and the RYCH, anSI<br />
between ourselves and the FLNKS. Let me preface what<br />
will be a much briefer answer not that I if I could<br />
talk for three hours and she'd get it all. I want to<br />
nI~ kA it Quite clear the profound respect that I and my<br />
Government have f or the GovernmenL uf Franceo and the way<br />
Lawy have handled * theRP things. I think we all owe a<br />
great debt of gratitude to the imagination and the<br />
commitment of resources and time and energy that the<br />
Government of France has made. We have a relationship<br />
with them which I think is ideal in that we have made the<br />
offer to assist in any way that we can. We think most<br />
particularly the way in which we can help is by the offer<br />
of training opportunities in Australia. That has been<br />
welcomed and I have said that if there is any more that<br />
they think that we can do then we are prepared to do<br />
that. They have welcomed it. As far as the two major<br />
groupings are concerned, I think they also understand a)<br />
the commituwzat of mycolf and my ; overnment to assist in<br />
the process in any way that they think that we can and<br />
if, as a result of my visit and discussions, they come to<br />
the conclusion that there are some other ways in which we<br />
can be of assistance, well we stand ready to do that.<br />
But we understand that these things must be worked out<br />
within this country. If there are other things like<br />
training that we can do well then we stand ready to help.<br />
But they haven't asked specifically for any other forms<br />
of assistance. one matter that did arise I might say,<br />
that was raised by representatives of the FLNKS, was the<br />
question uC Lhe recognition h~ rP of Qualifications in<br />
Australia. So I raised that issue afterwards with tfle<br />
Minister and it is agreed that this is something that<br />
must be looked at. Because there is not going to be much<br />
point if we use a great deal of resources for training<br />
and as a result of that some of the qualifications in<br />
Australia that result from that training are not here<br />
recognised. So there is an agreement now that we will<br />
study that matter and try and resolve that issue. </p>
<p>4<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, many of the Pacific Island<br />
nations appear likely at the Forum to oppose the<br />
incineration of chemical weapons at Johnston Island.<br />
Will Australia try and persuade them of the American view<br />
that this is safe and<br />
PM: I don't want to pre-empt by anything I say here the<br />
discussions I have with my colleagues at the Forum. I<br />
don't tnink Lhat would hnt appropriate. But I don't want<br />
to avoid your question entirely. I mean wu have had, nir<br />
scientif ic experts have a very careful and detailed<br />
examination mado-of thi~ s issue. I understand the concern<br />
of some of the Pacific island countries that I understand<br />
will be expressed at the Forum. I think as a result of<br />
the discussions that we will be able to have there that<br />
we may be able to reach a consensus. I hope so. But<br />
other than that I don't want to pre-empt the discussion I<br />
have there. It would not be, it wouldn't be courteous to<br />
my colleagues at the Forum.<br />
JC3UXdNiLIST,. Mr Hawke, did you urge tho RP~ fl to wend a<br />
representative to the South Paciric Po~ tum?<br />
PM: What I said there was this, That I believed that<br />
first of all as the constitution of the Forum stands that<br />
there was no provision really for observer status. But<br />
having said that, I made the point that I thought it<br />
would useful if my fellow leaders at the Forum had the<br />
opportunity of discussion with-leaders from here about<br />
developments in New Caledonia. So that I had the view<br />
that just as it would be useful for representatives for<br />
the FLNKS to be there and perhaps over a meal to meet<br />
with the leaders, so I thought it would abe useful if<br />
representatives of the RPca were to do that. Let me add'<br />
to that that I understand that no specific invitation has<br />
been issued to either the FLNKS or the RPCR. It is a<br />
matter for decision by the Minister whether they are<br />
there at the time of the Forum. I merely expressed the<br />
belief that if they are there then the Forum would take<br />
the opportunity in the sort of context that I referred to<br />
to have discussions with them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, two questions.<br />
PM: Two, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sarah Walls.<br />
PM: What?<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you after my name? The question, given<br />
. that<br />
PH4: Sorry, I thought you were nominating a subject and I<br />
was lost. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: I was just wondering, given that you haven't<br />
met the man who succeeded Mr Tjibaou as leader of New<br />
Caledonia's largest pro-independence party, Mr Francois<br />
BurcIC and given that members of the FLNKS seem to have<br />
stayed away from social functions during this visit, I<br />
wonder whether you consider it a complete success from<br />
Australia's point of view? That's the first question.<br />
The second question io that lact night in y'tr qp~ n you<br />
praised the Matignon Accords as a process for a peaceful<br />
transition to genuine self-determination and viable longterm<br />
provisional status. Mr Le Pensec said in his speech<br />
that the aspirations that each of the communities should<br />
be reconciled, had to be reconciled through the<br />
recognition of equal dignity, irreducible identity and<br />
their right to social access to social and economic<br />
responsibilities. Itm wondering whether you feel that<br />
Australia and France have the same view of what the<br />
outcome of the Matignon Accords will be?<br />
PM: Well as to the first question, I have met with all<br />
those with whom arrangements have been made for me to<br />
meet. I don't know the background to the organisation<br />
but I must say in regard to those with whom I have met<br />
who seem to me to have the capacity to speak for their<br />
respective constituencies, that I've found that most<br />
useful. As to the second question, I believe that the<br />
position of France and Australia is that the process is<br />
to provide a period up to 1998 when essential problems<br />
connected with the development of New Caledonia can be<br />
addressed so that when the tine comes in 1998 for the<br />
decision to be taken that the country is going to be in<br />
the best possible condition to make that decision work.<br />
I'think that both as I said in my speech today at<br />
lunchtime I said it is not for Australia to say what<br />
the outcome of the decision in 1998 will be. It's not<br />
for Australia to say. That is a matter for the people of<br />
New Caledonia to make that decision. T believe that that.<br />
view that I expressed on behalf of Australia is the view<br />
of the French Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: So it doesn't disturb you that you haven't<br />
met Mr Burok and that the FLNKS appears to have<br />
stayed away?<br />
PM: Well, you have a look at me. I don't appear<br />
disturbed I hope, because I can assure you that I'm not<br />
disturbed. I operate on the basis that I try and meet<br />
with as many people who can, but overwhelmingly operate<br />
on the basis I meet with those who want to meet with me.<br />
TL': s zauL vcz. y wim.-tivy and pursue in lifo coma othor<br />
philosophy. I've been very satisfied with the<br />
dioounnione I have had with the pionplip whn hAuVA wantpd to<br />
meet with me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Back to Johnston Island for the moment<br />
Johnston Atoll can you briefly summarise what the<br />
scientific report says? </p>
<p>3TLL. r-Irlem<br />
PH4 I could but I won't for the reasons I put before.<br />
It's most appropriate that I talk about those matters in<br />
the first instann Wit MY I-leafyt1d at the Forum.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you'll be no doubt seeing<br />
Ratu Mara tomorrow at the Retreat in Vila. will you be<br />
personally expressing to him Australia's unhappiness with<br />
the new constitution's lack of with the precondition<br />
that should be acceptable for main group<br />
PH: I've got essentially the same answer as I've just<br />
given. I have views asbout the constiuton ' 11 be<br />
conveying those to Ratu Mara. But I don't think it's<br />
courteous that I do that in advance of meeting him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you raise the question of French nuclear<br />
testing today? If so. with who? Do you ever get the<br />
feeling that you're wasting your time with<br />
PH: I raised it last night at the first opportunity<br />
publicly. I made the point clear. I've done it before<br />
With my fripir mirchel Rocard, the Primo minictor and I<br />
did it last night. There's no point in doing it again.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you made the point yesterday<br />
that Australia would like greater access for Australian<br />
goods in New Caledonia and you referred to artificial<br />
barriers against Australian access to the markets. Have<br />
you been given any indi%:; Luaam LheaL UlaaL'z the likely<br />
outcome<br />
PM: I've raised that matter and in terms that would be<br />
very well Understood by my dear friends in the Australian<br />
press contingent, I said that when I came back from the<br />
function last night and my colleagues came up to the room<br />
with me, I said have a beer. They opened the fridge and<br />
they got out a Fosters can. But this was a can of<br />
Fosters which had come from London. I said to Monsiour<br />
Le Perisec, I said you were a professor of economics, I<br />
was a tutor of economics, I said as fellow economists we<br />
must know that it is uneconomic to consume Posters beer<br />
in New Caledonia via London. That it is much more<br />
economic that you import the stuff I believe it's still<br />
very good directly from Australia. And not only the<br />
beer but the wine and dairy products. So I made the<br />
point in a rational sense as one economist to another and<br />
I think the point was well received. I hope that it will<br />
be followed up.<br />
PM: And may I just say finally before I go, in case I am<br />
misrepresented as having come here as an agent of John<br />
Elliott-INTERPRETER: PM: In case I am represented as coming here as an agent<br />
of John Elliott, that what I say of Fosters is true of<br />
XXXX or whatever. </p>
<p>7<br />
PM: there are in Australia some association that has<br />
given some militant active help to the FLANKS in the<br />
previous year. What position of your Government<br />
towards P! I'm not sure of the organisation I'm not aware<br />
of what organisations you refer to but let me make this<br />
quite definite point. As far as my Government is<br />
concerned, the processes which should be followed in this<br />
country are the peaceful processes of negotiation and of<br />
political and economic co-operation. As far as we are<br />
concerned, any organisation which was seeking in any way<br />
to subvert those processes would receive the most severe<br />
condemnation as far as the Government was concerned.<br />
