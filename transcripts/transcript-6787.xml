SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL TOURISM AWARDS<br />
MELBOURNE 19 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE TONIGHT FOR THE<br />
PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL TOURISM AWARDS.<br />
LAST YEAR'S AWARDS, THE INAUGURAL PRESENTATION, WERE MOST<br />
SUCCESSFUL AND IN THIS REGARD I SHOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE<br />
MR BROWN ON HIS INITIATIVE IN INSTITUTING SUCH A NOTEWORTHY<br />
SCHEME. THESE AWARDS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AS NOT ONLY DO THEY<br />
RECOGNISE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY AND<br />
HIGHLIGHT ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF<br />
AUSTRALIA BUT THEY ALSO INCREASE AWARENESS IN THE COMMUNITY<br />
OF THE INDUSTRY ITSELF.<br />
THROUGH THIS INCREASED AWARENESS THE INDUSTRY WILL MORE<br />
SUCCESSFULLY GROW AND DEVELOP.<br />
I BELIEVE THAT THIS GOVERNMENT, MORE THAN ANY OTHER, HAS<br />
RECOGNISED THE CONTRIBUTION THAT A VIABLE TOURIST INDUSTRY<br />
CAN MAKE TO THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE<br />
PROMOTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SECTOR AND THESE AWARDS<br />
ARE INDICATIVE OF THIS COMMITMENT.<br />
WE HAVE DONE MUCH TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST THE GROWTH OF THE<br />
TOURISM INDUSTRY. FIRSTLY, WE HAVE ENSURED THAT THE<br />
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH BUSINESS OPERATES IS CONDUCIVE<br />
TO ENTERPRISE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. SECONDLY, IN.<br />
RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY WE<br />
HAVE PUT INTO PLACE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES SPECIFICALLY TO<br />
HELP THE INDUSTRY DEVELOP FURTHER.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE RECOGNISED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION'S IMPORTANCE TO THE INDUSTRY.<br />
SINCE COMING TO OFFICE WE HAVE INCREASED THE TOURIST<br />
COMMISSION BUDGET BY SOME 160% TO THE POINT WHERE THE<br />
ALLOCATION FOR 1985-86 IS $ 26 MILLION WHICH WILL ENABLE IT<br />
TO CONTINUE ITS PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
TOURIST INDUSTRY. </p>
<p>RECENTLY THE AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION MOUNTED THE MOST<br />
SUCCESSFUL AND HIGHLY ACCLAIMED CAMPAIGN PROMOTING OUR GREAT1.<br />
COUNTRY IN THE UNITED STATES. THE HERO OF THE<br />
ADVERTISEMENTS IN THAT CAMPAIGN WAS NONE OTHER THAN PAUL<br />
HOGAN WHO GENEROUSLY PROVIDED HIS SERVICES FREE FOR THE<br />
BENEFIT OF ALL AUSTRALIANS. PAUL, IN ASSOCIATION WITH OUR<br />
TOURIST COMMISSION HAS GIVEN AUSTRALIA A NEW IDENTITY,<br />
CREDIBILITY AND LEGITIMACY AS A TOURIST DESTINATION IN THE<br />
UNITED STATES.<br />
WE ARE CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE INDUSTRY. OF<br />
BENEFIT TO MANY IN THE INDUSTRY WILL BE THE NEW TOURISM<br />
OVERSEAS PROMOTION. SCHEME ( TOPS) WHICH WILL ASSIST THE<br />
INDUSTRY IN THE EFFICIENT, CO-ORDINATED AND COST-EFFECTIVE<br />
PROMOTION OF AUSTRALIA AS AN ATTRACTIVE TOURIST DESTINATION.<br />
THE TOP SCHEME REPLACES THE FORMER ARRANGEMENTS UNDER THE<br />
EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT G,: RANTS SCHEME AND WILL TAKE INTO<br />
ACCOUNT THE DIVERSE AND UNIQUE NATURE OF TOURISM.<br />
AND OUR POLICIES ARE WORKING. IN 1984 SHORT TERM VISITOR<br />
ARRIVALS EXCEEDED ONE MILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME AND 1984<br />
RECEIPTS FROM INTERNATIONAL VISITORS WERE AROUND $ 1.35<br />
BILLION. FURTHERMORE, EMPLOYMENT WAS ESTIMATED AT AROUND<br />
380,000 IN SEPTEMBER 1985. OBVIOUSLY TOURISM MAKES A<br />
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
IT IS UP TO THE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TO TAKE<br />
ADVANTAGE OF A FAVOURABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE<br />
SPECIFIC INCENTIVES AFFORDED TO THEM BY THE FEDERAL I.<br />
GOVERNMENT. GOOD MANAGEMENT AND ENTREPRENEURIAL FLAIR ARE<br />
PREREQUISITES FOR A SUCCESSFUL TOURISM INDUSTRY. THESE<br />
AWARDS RECOGNISE THESE ATTRIBUTES AND I HOPE THAT THEY<br />
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO THE TOURISM INDUSTRY.<br />
I CONGRATULATE AWARD RECIPIENTS WHOLE-HEARTEDLY FOR THEIR<br />
EXCELLENT ACHIEVEMENTS AND TRUST THAT OTHERS IN THIS FINTE<br />
INDUSTRY FOLLOW THEIR EXAM4PLE.<br />
IT IS NOW MY PLEASURE TO ANNOUNCE AND TO PRESENT THE AWARD<br />
FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS </p>
