    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today an Australian Government contribution of $25 million towards the establishment of a United States Studies Centre at a prestigious Australian university. This is a joint initiative with the American Australian Association.</p>
<p>The Centre will deepen the appreciation and understanding of the United States' culture, political climate and government and strengthen the relationships between both countries. It will offer a range of postgraduate research studies, facilitate professional academic exchange, undertake research and produce scholarly articles and reports.</p>
<p>The establishment of such a prestigious and important organisation is timely given the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the E-3 visa allowing for greater development of people-to-people links. The establishment of the Centre also further supports the Australian Government's objective of increasing diversity within the current higher education sector.</p>
<p>By working in collaboration with existing institutions, the United States Studies Centre will be well placed to complement and provide leadership on current Australian-United States educational endeavours. The Centre will increase the awareness of the study of American politics and government, promote collaborative research between institutions in Australia and the United States and operate as a think-tank for the Australia-America relationship.</p>
<p>The Australian Government's contribution will be subject to sufficient funds being provided by the private sector and/or the state or territory in which the Centre is located. The Australian Government will work with the American Australian Association to select the most appropriate location for the Centre.</p>
<p>I welcome this important partnership and look forward to establishment of the Centre.  </p>
