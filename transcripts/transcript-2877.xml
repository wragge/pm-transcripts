AID TO FIJI<br />
Australia is to give Fiji two large mobile rock<br />
crushing plants, costing a total of $ 190,000.<br />
Announcing this today, the Special Minister of<br />
State and Minister assisting the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, Senator Willesee, said that the rock crushers<br />
are required by the Ministry of Communications, Works and<br />
Tourism which is responsible for the construction and<br />
maintenance of major roads throughout the islands.<br />
With Fiji placing increasing emphasis on construction<br />
of roads and airfields on outlying islands where roads<br />
surfacing material is not available in natural form, the<br />
shortage of rock crushers is becoming critical and the supply<br />
of two mobile rock crushers by Australia will help overcome<br />
this situation. </p>
