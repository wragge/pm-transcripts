PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 27 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
We are in the last days of a very important election compaign.<br />
I want to talk to you tonight about some issues that<br />
are tundamin. nal" to the choicQ to be made on March 5. The impact<br />
of the drought, the severe world recession and irresponsible<br />
wage demands have made recent years difficult, yet your Government<br />
has responded with strength and determination.<br />
We have a record of positive achievement across every front.<br />
We have achieved new strengths in our alliauces and our<br />
position in the world. We have achieved reforms by cutting<br />
taxes, substantially increasing family allowances and<br />
providing significant rebates on home loan repayments. Recently<br />
we have embarked upon two major projects a Bicentennial Roads<br />
Programme and a National Water Resources Programme, part of our<br />
vision of achievement for Australia.<br />
A recent achievement has been to put in. place the wages<br />
pause. Our arguments persuaded all eight Governments to support<br />
it. Only Federal Labor and their ACTU masters opposed this<br />
programme, which will lead not only to economic recovery but also<br />
free $ 300 million to provide jobs for young Australians, the<br />
: older unemployed and welfare housing.<br />
We are it Government not only of achievement but of. promise.<br />
We have promised a new deal for young Australians, with jobs<br />
especially in conservation projects. Lower tax rates, more<br />
finance and help with advanced technology promise a bright<br />
future for small business, new child care programmes and<br />
expansion in pensioner health benefits promise more security for<br />
families.<br />
We promise major reforms in industrial relations. Secret<br />
ballots and reforms to strikes in essential services,<br />
promise security and sanity, especially compared with Labor's<br />
pledges of more power tothe unions. My Government has a record<br />
of achievement a commitment to the future based upon this. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
in difficult times Australians have always been prepared to f ace<br />
up to-making touqh and difficult decisions. Tlwy 1I. now there<br />
a'rf ho quick. and easy solu'tions...<br />
We know we cannot overcomae this<br />
problem by a simple, crude policy of spend, spend, spend. Yet<br />
that is precisely what Labor is determined to do.<br />
In order to get that money they will have to compete with you<br />
for funds. The money you need to build or buy your own home,<br />
to develop youir small business and increase employment would go<br />
instead to Labor. The money which our dyrnanic industries<br />
need to expand, to compete, to create Jobs -it would go instead<br />
Labor.<br />
In addition % to depriving you of funds,<br />
in order to find 4,000 million dollars more than is already being<br />
spent, Labor policies will mean much higher interest rates on<br />
what money is left higher interest rates on your home loan,<br />
higher interest rates which will prevent industry from growing<br />
and employing more people, higher interest rates which will hurt<br />
all Australians.<br />
We will not let that happen. Wle will r~ ake sure that money is available<br />
not for big-spending governments, but for big-thinking Australian.<br />
The disaster of Labor's policies is so much worse when you look<br />
at Labor's deal with the unions. Most Australians agree that<br />
the unions already have too much power. For selfish and often<br />
irresponsible ends unions continually disrupt the lives of decent<br />
Australians paralysing transport systems, drying up petrol<br />
supplies, costing you money, costing Australia jobs.<br />
Yet on March 5 the former head of the A. C. T. U. is asking you<br />
to vote for more union power. The so-called prices and incomes<br />
deal dictated by the unions and accepted by the Labor Party must<br />
be exposed. This shameful deal gives the unions a power of veto<br />
over the policies of a Labor Government. Labor Government<br />
policies must be agreed to by the unions that's what the deal<br />
Bays. It means Labor would provide policies to suit the unions<br />
regardless of what's best for you. This deal commits<br />
Labor, in their own words, to being " accommodating and supportive"<br />
of the unions. That means no less than a Labor Government<br />
accommodating agreeing to union demands and being supportive<br />
of the unions even when they ought to be supportive of you, the<br />
people of Australia who are the constant victims of union militancy. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
This deal provides a blueprint for socialist control of Australia.<br />
Every business big or small is to be regulated. They say<br />
" comprehensive" and " closely monitored" interventionist policies<br />
are necessary to achieve " a transition of thq economy into a<br />
planned framework".<br />
The lives and inco: esin t. eir wojds of shopeep'ers, self<br />
employed biilders and tradesmen are to be contxol Lied...<br />
Government and unions unde4 this deal will even be given the right<br />
to set profit levels. As if this were not enough, the deal gives<br />
unions this same right of veto over policies for your health<br />
care, over your children's education, over pensions and<br />
superannuation and over immigration, which was a particular<br />
target of the last Labor government.<br />
But most despicable of all, this deal leaves no room for you to<br />
really influence your own future. It is an exclusive deal<br />
between Labor and militant unions, a deal in which you have no<br />
say.<br />
My government will never permit this to happen. We propose to<br />
bring the militant unions back under the control of the law,<br />
responsible to their own members and to the people all the<br />
people of Australia.<br />
On March 5 youwillhave a choice you can elect the men and women<br />
who will actually govern Australia, or you can elect a party which<br />
will be the instrument of militant unions. Australians don't<br />
want union dominance and socialist control. They want the<br />
freedom to work, to strive, to succeed, to prosper, to be<br />
rewarded for effort. We will provide a government which values<br />
those endeavours and which seeks to promote the talents of a<br />
great people in a free society.<br />
