ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THIE HON. R. J. L. HAWKE, AC, MP.,<br />
BUSLNESSPERSONS LUNCH<br />
PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL HOTEL<br />
CAIRNS, 11 AUGUST 1983<br />
I AM DELIGHTED TO BE BACK IN CAIRNS ENJOYING YOUR<br />
SPLENDID HOSPITALITY ONCE AGAINMY<br />
LAST VISIT TO CAIRNS WAS IN FEBRUARY JUST PRIOR TO THE<br />
LAST FEDERAL ELECTION.<br />
ISPOKE THEN ABOUT THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS FACING NORTH<br />
QUEENSLAND AND OF THE POLICIES WE IN THE LABOR PARTY<br />
PROPOSED TO INTRODUCE IF ELECTED TO GOVERNMENT.<br />
IT IS APPROPRIATE THEREFORE THAT I REPORT BACK TO YOU AND<br />
THE PEOPLE OF NORTH QUEENSLAND ON PROGRESS TO DATE AND OUR<br />
PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.<br />
DURING MY VISIT TO CAIRNS IN FEBRUARY I SPOKE OF WHAT HAS<br />
BEEN TERMED THE TYRANNY OF DISTANCE<br />
I POINTED TO THE GREAT PROBLEMS THIS POSED FOR NORTH<br />
QUEENSLAND AND THE CONSEQUENT NEED TO GIVE TO HIGHEST<br />
PRIORITY TO COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT-</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO PROCEED WITH THE NATIONAL<br />
COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEM -THE AUSSAr PROJECT -WILL<br />
BE TREMENDOUSLY VALUABLE TO PEOPLE IN REMOTE AREAS-<br />
1-T WILL BRING ABC RADIO AND IT WILL BRING TV TO THOUSANDS OF NORTH<br />
QUJEENSLAND PEOPLE WHO AT PRESENT RECEIVE NO SERVICETHE<br />
SATELLITE SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS CAN BE<br />
CONNECTED TO THE AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE NETWORK.<br />
As WELL, THE SATELLITE IS LIKELY TO BE USED FOR EDUCAT ION<br />
SERVICES TO REMOTE AND UNDERSERVED AREASTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION ON THE SATELLITE TAKEN, I MIGHT<br />
SAY, IN THE FACE OF STRONG OPPOSITION FROM SOME TRADE UNIONS<br />
CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES OUR COMMITMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
THE NATION AND TO THE WELFARE OF PEOPLE IN REMOTE AREAS.<br />
ANO0THER PROPOSAL THAT HAS FOR A LONG TI" ME BEEN WIDELY<br />
SUPPORTED IS TO SET UP A SECOND ABC REGIONAL RADIO NETWORK.<br />
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT SEEN FIT TO GO AHEAD WITH THE<br />
PROPOSAL, DESPITE ITS CLEAR BENEFITS To NORTH QUEENSLAND AND<br />
OTHER REMOTE AREAS. THAT WILL NOW CHANGETHE<br />
FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A<br />
SECOND REGIONAL RADIO NETWORK FOR THE ABC-</p>
<p>WE WILL MAKE AN IMMEDIATE START BY PROVIDING FUNDS IN THE<br />
1933-84 BUDGET TO GET THE PROJECT OFF THE GROUNDWE<br />
ANTICIPATE THE FIRST STATIONS OF THE NETWORK WILL BE<br />
COMPLETED BY 1985.<br />
M1ANY NORTH QUEENSLANDERS AND OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE<br />
FRUSTRATION INHERENT IN A SOLE ABC RADIO SERVICE WHOSE<br />
PROGRAM SCHEDULES MUST SERVE A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERESTS<br />
SUCH AS CATERING FOR RURAL AND URBAN LISTENERS,<br />
SCHOOLCHILDREN AND THE GROWING DAYTIME AUDIENCE.<br />
WHEN THE SECOND REGIONAL NETWORK COMMENCES TRANSMISSIONS IT<br />
WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR THE ABC TO OFFER A MUCH WIDER CHOICE OF<br />
PROGRAMMING TO ALL ITS LISTENERS IN THE NORTH AND ELSEWHERETHE<br />
NETWORK WILL CONSIST OF MORE THAN 40O REGIONALLY-LOCATED<br />
STUDIOS, OF WHICH ONE QUARTER WILL BE NEWLY-ESTABLISHED.<br />
THiIS WILL ALLOW THE ABC TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS WITH A GREATER<br />
AMOUNT OF LOCAL MATERIAL OF INCREASED RELEVANCE TO THE<br />
REGIONS SERVEDWE<br />
ESTIMATE THAT AS MANY As 4-MILLION AUSTRALIANS WHO ARE<br />
NOW ONLY RECEIVING ONE ABC RADIO PROGRAM WILL BENEFIT FROM<br />
THE SECOND NETWORK. </p>
<p>4.<br />
THE DOMESTIC SATELLITE WILL BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE THIS ABC<br />
SERV ICE.-<br />
A NUMBER OF ASPECTS SUCH AS LOCATION OF STUDIOS AND<br />
FREQUENCY ALLOCATION NEED SOME FURTHER STUDYTHE<br />
MINISTER FOR COMMUINICATIONS WILL BE ESTABLISHING A TASK<br />
FORCE TO EXAMINE THESE MATTERS AND PREPARE A PUBLIC<br />
STATEMENT ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SECOND REGIONAL<br />
RADIO NETWOR.<br />
OUR DECISION TO ESTABLISH THE SECOND REGIONAL RADIO NETWORK<br />
WILL REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN ADDITIONAL<br />
BROADCASTING SERVICES IN NORTH QUEENSLAND AND WILL MORE THAN<br />
MEET OUR PROMISE TO PROVIDE $ 250,000 FOR UPGRADING SERVICES<br />
IN THIS REGION.<br />
I NOW TURN TO ANOTHER COMMUNICATION PROBLEM FACED BY A GREAT<br />
MANY PEOPLE IN NORTH QUEENSLAND AND ELSEWHERE WHO RECEIVE<br />
ABC TELEVISION BUT WHO ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE COMMERCIAL<br />
TELEVISIONTHEY HAVE A SPECIAL DIFFICULTY IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE<br />
RIGHTS TO PROGRAMS OF SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE ARE HELD BY<br />
COMMERCIAL STATI ONS AND NOT THE ABC.<br />
A RECENT CASE IN POINT IS THE REPLAY OF NSW RUGBY LEAGUE IN<br />
QUEENSLAND-</p>
<p>WHEREAS THE ABC USED TO TELEVISE THE LEAGUE, THOSE RIGHTS<br />
ARE NOW HELD BY THE QUEENSLAND COMMERCIAL TELEVISION<br />
STATIONSTHIS HAS MEANT THAT THOSE PEOPLE IN QUEENSLAND IN AREAS<br />
WHERE THERE IS NO LOCAL COMMERCIAL TELEVISION STATION HAVE<br />
BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE LEAGUETHE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED STRONG REPRESENTATIONS FROM<br />
KEITH WRIGHT AS WELL AS UNHAPPY QUEENSLAND RUGBY LEAGUE<br />
FANS THE DIX COMMITTEE OF REVIEW INTO THE ABC RECOMMENDED THAT<br />
SPECIAL ATTENTION BE GIVEN TO THIS PROBLEM.<br />
THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED CONSIDERATION OF A TELEVISION<br />
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED DIFFERENT PROGRAM MATERIAL<br />
TO BE INCLUDED IN NATIONAL TELEVISION SCHEDULES INTENDED FOR<br />
AUDIENCES WHERE ABC TELEVISION PROVIDED THE ONLY TELEVISION<br />
SE RV ICE.<br />
THE DIX COMMITTEE ENVISAGED THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW THE ABC,<br />
IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHER BROADCASTING INDUSTRY OPERATORS,<br />
TO CONSIDER SEPARATE PROGRAMMING FOR THESE AREAS. THIS<br />
SEPARATE PROGRAMMING WOULD BE BASED ON:<br />
FIRST, POPULAR APPEAL MATERIAL OF QUALITY SUCH AS<br />
AUSTRALIAN FEATURE FILMS AND OVERSEAS FEATURE<br />
PRODUCTIONS; </p>
<p>SECOND, MATERIAL OF WIDE OR "/ NATIONAL INTEREST I<br />
SUCH AS SOME SPORTING EVENTS OVER WHICH COMMERCIAL<br />
OPERATORS POSSESSED EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS;<br />
THIRD, MAINSTREAM TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS OF THE<br />
MULTICULTURAL TELEVISION SERVICE.<br />
THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE,<br />
HOWEVER, WITH THE CO-OPERATION OF ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED,<br />
I BELIEVE THAT THE Dix COMMITTEE PROPOSAL PRESENTS A<br />
POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.<br />
ACCORDINGLY, I HAVE ASKED THE MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,<br />
MICHAEL DUFFY, TO TAKE UP THE PROPOSAL WITH THE NEW CHAIRMAN<br />
OF THE AuSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION, MR KEN MYER.<br />
SHOULD THIS SOLUTION PROVE FEASIBLE IT WILL ALLOW A MUCH<br />
BROADER RANGE OF PROGRAMMING TO PEOPLE IN QUEENSLAND AND<br />
ELSEWHERE WHO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THE ABC TELEVISION SERVICE.<br />
ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE " TYRANNY OF DISTANCE" IS TRANSPORT.<br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPRECIATES THE JUSTIFIED CONCERN OF<br />
NORTH QUEENSLANDERS ABOUT THE STATE OF THEIR ROADS. WE<br />
ARE SQUARELY ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM.<br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE TOTAL ROAD FUNDING TO<br />
QUEENSLAND IN 1983-84 By 40 PER CENT TO $ 253 MILLION. </p>
<p>As WELL AS ADDRESSING AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM AREAJTHIS WILL<br />
PROVIDE OVER 12,000 JOBS BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY,<br />
WE REGARD THE BRUCE HIGHWAY AS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR<br />
THE ALLOCATION OF NATIONAL ROAD FUNDS WITHIN QUEENSLAND.<br />
WE ARE ACCELERATING ITS UPGRADING TO BRING IT UP TO AN<br />
ACCEPTABLE NATIONAL STANDARD AND ELIMINATE FLOOD-PRONE<br />
SECTIONS.<br />
ABOUT $ 65 MILLION,. AN ALL-TIME RECORD, WILL BE SPENT IN<br />
1983-84.<br />
ANOTHER MAJOR CONCERN OF NORTH QUEENSLANDERS LOCAL ROADS<br />
IS ALSO A PRIORITY AREA.<br />
LOCAL ROADS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE 40 PER CENT BOOST IN TOTAL<br />
ROAD FUNDING FOR QUEENSLAND, TO WHICH I HAVE JUST REFERRED.<br />
IN ADDITION WE ARE PROVIDING QUEENSLAND WITH $ 12.14 MILLION<br />
IN 1983-84 FOR JOBS ON LOCAL ROADS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF<br />
OUR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM.<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH QUEENSLAND DEPENDS ENORMOUSLY ON<br />
ITS GREAT PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br />
THE SUGAR INDUSTRY HAS FACED HUGE PROBLEMS IN RECENT YEARS<br />
WITH THE SLUMP IN WORLD SUGAR PRICES COMING ON TOP OF OTHER<br />
MAJOR PROBLEMS. </p>
<p>ONE OF THE FIRST ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS TO<br />
CHANNEL $ 10 MILLION INTO THE QUEENSLAND SUGAR INDUSTRY<br />
rltOUGH THE RURAL ADJUSTMENT SCHEME.<br />
THESE FUNDS ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF CARRY-ON<br />
LOANS AND WILL UNQUESTIONABLY KEEP MANY GROWERS IN THE<br />
INDUSTRY WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN FORCED OUT.<br />
OUR NEW FIVE-YEAR STABILISATION PLAN FOR THi-TOBACCO<br />
INDUSTRY WILL ALLOW GROWERS TO LOOK TO THE FJTURE WITH<br />
CONF I DENCE<br />
WE ARE NOW FINALISING PLANS FOR REORGANIZING TIE MEAT<br />
INDUSTRY ORGANISATIONS.<br />
THESE PLANS WILL ENABLE PRODUCERS AND PROCESSORS TO HAVE A<br />
GREATER CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE POLICY MAKING WITHII. THEIR<br />
INDUSTRY.<br />
THE FISHING INDUSTRY WILL BENEFIT FROM A NEW ORGANIZATION<br />
THE FISHING INDUSTRY CONSULTATIVE PANEL WHICH WE<br />
ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE INDUSTRY-WIDE ADVICE TO<br />
GOVERNMENTTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES THE CONCERN OF NORTH<br />
QUEENSLANDERS FOR THE STATE OF OUR DEFENCE PRE! AREDNESS AND<br />
THE ADEQUACY OF OUR COASTAL SURVEILLANCE. </p>
<p>THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE DEFENCE<br />
SPENDING IN REAL TERMS IN THE COMING BUDGET..<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO CONDUCTING A FULL SCALE REVIEW OF<br />
OUR COASTAL SURVEILLANCE ARRANGEMENTS, HEADED UP BY MY<br />
COLLEAGUE, Kim BEAZLEY.<br />
BUT I KNOW THERE IS A MATTER OF IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO CAIRNS<br />
THE QUESTION OF FUTURE ORDERS OF PATROL BOATS AT NORTH<br />
QUEENSLAND ENGINEERS AND AGENTS.<br />
THIS MATTER IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING THE URGENT CONSIDERATION<br />
OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ADVICE WE HAVE RECEIVED<br />
FROM OUR DEFENCE AUTHORITIES THAT THEY CLASSIFY FURTHER F-CLASS<br />
PATROL BOATS AS A LOW PRIORITY.<br />
BECAUSE OF THIS, I AM NOT ABLE TO INDICATE AT THIS POINT<br />
PRECISELY WHAT THE POSITION WILL BE.<br />
BUT I CAN SAY THIS.<br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS IN NO DOUBT AND HAS BEEN LEFT IN<br />
NO DOUBT OF THE IMMENSE CONCERN IN CAIRNS THAT FURTHER<br />
ORDERS BE PLACED WITH NQ[ A AND SOON.<br />
I CAN ALSO SAY THAT THE DEFENCE MINISTER, GORDON SCHOLES,<br />
HAS FORESHADOWED A HIGH PRIORITY PROGRAM FOR ABOUT FIVE<br />
PATROL BOATS FOR SOUTH-WEST PACIFIC ISLAND STATES.<br />
SUBJECT TO PROGRESS WITH NEGOTIATIONS A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT IS<br />
EXPECTED IN LATE AUGUST, DURING THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM MEETING. </p>
<p>NQEA WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE A STRONG TENDERER, ON THE<br />
BASIS OF THEIR EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE ON FREEMANTLE-CLASS<br />
PATROL BOATS FOR THE NAVY AND THEIR HIGH LEVELS OF EFFICIENCY.<br />
THE FUTURE VIABILITY OF NQEA IS A HIGH PRIORITY WITH ME<br />
AND my GOVERNMENT AND WE WILL BE PURSUING THIS AND OTHER<br />
AVENUES TO ENSURE THAT VIABILITY.<br />
A MATTER I KNOW IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO SO MANY IN THIS<br />
AUDIENCE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOURIST INDUSTRY.<br />
THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE WHOLE OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
IT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE FUTURE PROSPERITY OF NORTH QUEENSLAND,<br />
INDEED NORTH QUEENSLAND HAS VAST POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP A<br />
TOURIST INDUSTRY OF WORLD RENOWN.<br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE ITS FULL BACKING TO THE<br />
EFFORTS OF NORTH QUEENSLAND TO DEVELOP YOUR TOURIST INDUSTRY.<br />
YESTERDAY I ANNOUNCED A DECISION THAT WILL GREATLY ASSIST<br />
THE TOURIST INDUSTRY IN NORTH QUEENSLAND A SPECIAL GRANT<br />
OF APPROXIMATELY $ 1 MILLION THIS FINANCIAL YEAR TO SUBSIDISE<br />
THE DIESEL FUEL COSTS To BARRIER REEF ISLAND RESORTS.<br />
THIS EFFECTIV/ ELY MEETS ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WE MADE TO<br />
NORTH QUEENSLAND TO EXEMPT THE GREAT BARRIER REEF ISLAND<br />
RESORTS FROM THE DIESEL EXCISE IMPOSED BY THE PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>11.<br />
THE TOURIST INDUSTRY IN NORTH QUEENSLAND WILL ALSO BENEFIT<br />
FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL BOOST IN FUNDING WE WILL PROVIDE THIS<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR TO THE AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,<br />
THIS WILL ENABLE THE COMMISSION TO STEP UP ITS ACTIVITIES TO<br />
PROMOTE INBOUND TOURISM TO AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT SEES THE PROVISION OF MORE LOW-COST<br />
ACCOMMODATION AS A MEANS-OF ENCOURAGING MORE AUSTRALIANS TO<br />
SEE AUSTRALIA PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNABLE<br />
TO AFFORD A HOLIDAY,<br />
WE PLAN TO UNDERTAKE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IN CONSULTATION<br />
WITH THE STATES AND RELEVANT AGENCIES TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM<br />
WHERE A DEMONSTRATED NEED EXISTS,<br />
As AN INITIAL STEP, STATE TOURISM AUTHORITIES HAVE PROVIDED<br />
INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT STATE OF LOW-COST ACCOMMODATION,<br />
ANOTHER OF OUR NORTH QUEENSLAND COMMITMENTS ON TOURISM WAS<br />
TO NEGOTIATE WITH TRANSPORT OPERATORS FOR 30 DAY FIXED FARE<br />
AIR TRAVEL AND ALL INCLUSIVE AIR-RAIL-COACH TICKETS TO<br />
ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE TO NORTH QUEENSLAND, </p>
<p>12.<br />
MY COLLEAGUE) JOHN BROWN, MINISTER FOR SPORT, RECREATION AND<br />
TOURISM, HAS SET IN TRAIN THESE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE<br />
AIRLINES ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS W', IL. L NEED TO FOLLOW WITH RAIL AND<br />
COACH OPERATORS.<br />
AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE TOURIST INDUSTRY AS WELL<br />
AS TO THE BOAT CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN QUEENSLAND HAS BEEN<br />
THE IM-POSITION BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT OF A 20 PER CENT<br />
SALES TAX ON TOURIST VESSELS.<br />
THIS TAX HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SERIOUS ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES<br />
EXPERIENCED BY BOTH THESE INDUSTRIES IN RECENT TIMES.<br />
TO ALLEVIATE THESE PRESSURES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
DECIDED TO REINSTATE THE EXEMPTION FROM SALES TAX FOR<br />
CERTAIN TOURIST BOATS.<br />
THE EXEMPTION WILL EXTEND TO THOSE VESSELS WHICH ARE<br />
LICENCED TO CARRY NOT LESS THAN 12 PASSENGERS AND WHICH<br />
ARE USED PRINCIPALLY BY THE OWNER IN CARRYING ON A BUSINESS<br />
OF PROVIDING REGULAR, SCHEDULED SIGHT SEEING TOURS FOR<br />
PAYING PASSENGERS, </p>
<p>13.<br />
To MAXIMISE ITS BENEFITS, THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE EXEMPTION<br />
WILL BE BACKDATED TO 19 AUGUST 1981, WHICH IS THE DATE SUCH<br />
VESSELS FIRST BECAME TAXABLE.<br />
THE EXEMPTION IS NOT TO APPLY TO VESSELS CHARTERED OR HIRED<br />
FOR PURPOSES OF PLEASURE, SPORT OR RECREATION.<br />
THIS DECISION WILL PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL BOOST NOT ONLY<br />
TO THE TOURIST INDUSTRY BUT ALSO TO THE SMALL SHIPS<br />
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.<br />
THIS INDUSTRY WILL AGAIN BE ABLE TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO THE QUEENSLAND ECONOMY.<br />
THE INDUSTRY HAS DEVELOPED OVER MANY YEARS IN QUEENSLAND AND<br />
CARRIES WITH IT UNIQUE SKILLS WqHICH HAVE BEEN<br />
UNDER THREAT.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION REFLECTS OUR COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING<br />
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WORKFORCE SKILLS IN THE IMPORTANT<br />
REGIONAL CENTRES OF AUSTRALIA AS WELL AS TO ENCOURAGING THE<br />
TOURIST INDUSTRY TO ACHIEVE ITS FULL POTENTIAL.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THE ACUTE SHORTAGE OF OFFICE ACCOMMODATION<br />
IN NORTH QUEENSLAND.<br />
THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER FACILITIES,<br />
ESPECIALLY FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMIENTS WHICH MAKE<br />
USE OF SHOP FRONT ACCOMMODATION FOR EXAMPLE SOCIAL SECURITY,<br />
IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS AND OTHERS. </p>
<p>1N.<br />
ACCORDINGLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TO EMBARK ON A MAJOR<br />
NATION-WIDE OFFICE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM.<br />
THSWILL PARTICULARLY BENEFIT NORTH QUEENSLAND. CAIRNS<br />
IS ON THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR THIS NEW OFFICE CONSTRUCTION<br />
ALONG WITH ROCKHAMPTON, MACKAY AND THURSDAY ISLAND.<br />
k1. COlL LEAGUE, JOHN BROWN, THE MINISTER FOR ADMINISTRATIVE<br />
SERVICES) WILL ANNOUNCE DETAILS SHORTLY AND WE W/ ILL BE<br />
ADVERTISING SOON FOR SUBMISSIONS OF INTEREST FROM<br />
DEVELOPERS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL UNDERTAKE THIS NEW PROGRAM OF<br />
OFFICE CONSTRUCTION BY USING LEASE PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR A NEW AND INNOVATIVE FORM OF<br />
CO-OPERATION WITH BUSINESS,<br />
WE INTEND TO ENTER INTO FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH PRIVATE<br />
SECTOR INTERESTS WHEREBY THE COSTS OF CONSTRUCTION WILL BE<br />
RECOUPED BY DEVELOPERS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OVER A FIXED<br />
PERIOD AT THE END OF WHICH OWNERSHIP OF THE OFFICE BUILDINGS<br />
WOULD BE VESTED IN THE COMMONWEALTH.<br />
EIGHTY-THREE PER CENT OF COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT ACCOMMODATION<br />
IS LEASED PROBABLY THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ANY<br />
COMPARABLE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD,<br />
OUR OFFICE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM WILL HELP CORRECT THAT<br />
IMBALANCE. </p>
<p>IT WILL STIMULATE * rHE BUILDING INDUSTRY IN REGIONAL AREAS<br />
AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE FROM COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENTS<br />
TO THEIR CLIENTS,<br />
THIS NEW PROGRAM OF OFFICE CONSTRUCTION, USING BOTH<br />
BUDGET-FUNDED AND PRIVATE SECTOR-FUNDED ARRANGEMENTS,<br />
REPRESENTS A WELCOME RESUMPTION OF COMMONWEALTH ACTIVITY itl<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OWN OFFICE SPACE.<br />
EXPENDITURE ON THE PROGRAM WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET<br />
BY RENTAL SAVINGS, AND IN DUE COURSE), BY THE DISPOSAL OF<br />
SURPLUS GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS,<br />
THE BENEFITS TO CITIES LIKE CAIRNS ARE CLEAR BETTER<br />
GOVERNMENT SERVICE, MORE CONSTRUCTION AND MORE JOBS,<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NORTH QUEENSLAND HAS THEE POTENTIAL TO<br />
TAKE THE LEAD IN THE ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE TASK WE FACE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT POTENTIAL IS REALISED,<br />
WE NEED A NEW AUSTRALIA ONE THAT IS HEALTHIER, STRONGER<br />
AND MORE SECURE.<br />
ONE THAT FULLY EMBRACES THE GREAT CHALLENGE OF THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NATIONAL RESOURCES.<br />
AND I BELIEVE THAT NEW AUSTRALIA OF THE FUTURE CAN BE FOUND<br />
HERE IN NORTH QUEENSLAND. </p>
