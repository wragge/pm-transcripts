    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of all Australians, Margie and I extend to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge congratulations on the birth of a daughter.</p>
<p>The birth of a baby is a great moment for any family and Australia shares this young familyâs joy.</p>
<p>We wish the young Princess, a long and happy life.</p>
<p>I am sure that the Princess and her older brother, Prince George, will in time develop a deep familiarity and love of Australia â feelings the rest of their family already share.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Australia sends its best wishes to the Duke and Duchess during this special time in their lives.</p>
