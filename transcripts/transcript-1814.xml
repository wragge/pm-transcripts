NEW ZEALAND VISIT<br />
WELLINGTON 16 APR 1968<br />
JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY NEW ZEALAND<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOLYOAKE AND AUSTR-LIAN<br />
PRIME MINISTER GORTON 28 MAiRCH 1968<br />
The Prime Ministers of A ustralia and New Zealand greatly<br />
welcomed the opportunity provided by Mr Gorton's goodwill visit to New<br />
Zealand to discuss a wide range of subjects, expecially those which<br />
affect relations between the two countries.<br />
Mr Holyoake and his colleagues expressed their<br />
appreciation that it should have been to New Zealand that Mr Gorton<br />
paid his first visit outside Australia as Prime Minister. Both Prime<br />
Ministers noted with satisfaction that the visit reflects the very close<br />
ties between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
The talks have also been most timely in view of the<br />
forthcoming meetings at Wellington in connection with SEATO, kANZUS<br />
and the Viet Nam war.<br />
This meeting took place against a background of increasing<br />
consultation and co-operation between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
Not only do the two countries continue to work together<br />
within alliances and groupings such as ANZUS, SEATO, tsia and the<br />
Pacific Council ( ASPAC) and the Commonwealth, and in international<br />
forums such as the United Nations, but the essence of their relationship<br />
is-to be found in the close contacts between them which are constantly<br />
maintained at many levels.<br />
The Prime Ministers viewed with satisfaction the trend<br />
greatly strengthened since the visit to New Zealand last year by the late<br />
Mr Holt for more frequent consultation between the two Governments,<br />
and agreed they would do all that was necessary to ensure that these<br />
exchanges will continue and increase.<br />
The discussions were informal, their chief purpose being<br />
to acquaint the Prime Minister more fully with each other's thinking.<br />
They covered not only developments in relations between the two countries<br />
but international questions, especinlly the two countries' policies in<br />
South-East Asia and the Pacific and their attitudes to tnterna. tional trade.<br />
The Prime Ministers sgreed that while the aggression in<br />
Viet Nnm continues, the two countries will maintain their military support<br />
to the Republic of Viet Nam and its Allies. At the same time, they will<br />
endeavour to assist the search for peaceful solution. Both countries<br />
accept the need to continue civil aid to assist the social and economic<br />
reconstruction of that country.<br />
The acceleration of the withdrawal of British Forces from<br />
South E. st Asia is of deep concern to both countries and has prompted<br />
both Governments to reassess, in consultation with their Allies in the / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
region, the role Australia and New Zealand are best fitted to play.<br />
With regard to the situation-n South-East Asia<br />
generally, the Prime Ministers were particularly heartened by the<br />
disposition of many of the States in this region to work together for<br />
peace and prosperity. Through ASPkIC, the Colombo Plan, the<br />
Economic Commission for Asia and the Far-East ( ECAFE), and the<br />
Asian Development Bank-to which Australia and New Zealand belong,<br />
both countries demonstrate their sense of continuing Involvement In the<br />
progress and stability of the arec.<br />
The Prime Ministers welcomed the recent formqtion<br />
of the Association of .0outh-East Asian Nations ( ASEA~ N)-and the development<br />
of a closer working relationship between Indonesia and its<br />
neighbours. The Prime Ministers also -discussed their continuing<br />
Interest in the iff airs of the-South Pacific, an area with which Australia<br />
and New Zealaind have intimate ties and in whose development both<br />
countries are closely involved,<br />
Both countries have ak common concern in the stability<br />
of international commodity-trade, and in this field they tr,' ditionslly<br />
adopt q co-operative approach. The Prime Ministers noted that world<br />
markets for dairy products were under intensive pressure because-of<br />
subsidised competition, and agreed that an international solution was<br />
urgently needed. An attempt to achieve an interim solution w~' s at<br />
present-being made in the GATT. Both Governments are striving to<br />
ensure a successful outcome to these negotiations.<br />
Matters relevant to the Free Trade Agreement<br />
between r-, ustralia and New Zealand will be the subject of further<br />
discussions between Mr Mc-7wen and Mr Marshall next week. The<br />
Prime Ministers agreed on the importance of doing everything possible<br />
to ensure the success of the agreement and that it was a key factor in<br />
the healthy development of both economies.<br />
The discussions between the Prime Ministers, which<br />
took place in -g most friendly atmosphere, have-given them both valuable<br />
Insights into the respective policies of Australia and New Zealand over<br />
a wide range of subjects. They look forward to further meetings and intend<br />
that contacts kt all levels between Australia and New Zealand should<br />
increase. </p>
