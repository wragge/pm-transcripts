PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
WELCOME TO HIS EXCELLENCY DR CENSU TABONE PRESIDENT OF<br />
MALTA, CANBERRA 16 JUNE 1993<br />
President Tabone<br />
It is my pleasure to welcome you to Australia.<br />
Our two countries are friends of long standing.<br />
It is a unique friendship. It is one built much less on economic or security concerns<br />
than on people.<br />
It is the 56,000 Malta-born Australians and twice that number of Maltese descent<br />
who unite us. I'm told that almost every family in Malta will have some relatives in<br />
Australia. You cannot have stronger links than such human ones as these.<br />
The Maltese have been great contributors in Australia and in those things which<br />
really matter, like politics and sport, the Maltese have been there. And I'm pleased to<br />
say that in politics their preference has generally been for the Labor side.<br />
They have been coming here since 1810, I'm told; and down the years they could be<br />
found not just in the major capital cities but out on the frontier in places like<br />
Innisfail, Mackay and Broken Hill.<br />
So they were among the pioneers of Australia's economic development, and since the<br />
Second World War they have also been pioneers of our social development.<br />
The have played a substantial and creative role in the post-war development of<br />
Australia's cities, and in the emergence of a multicultural society which has been one<br />
of this nation's great achievements.<br />
Of course the bonds between our two countries were strengthened during the Second<br />
World War, when Australians helped defend Malta during three y'ears of continuous<br />
bombing by the Axis powers.<br />
Last year when your government announced the issue of a medal to mark the<br />
anniversary of the award of the George Cross to Malta some 2000 Australians were<br />
eligible and I believe about 1400 have so far received it.<br />
Mr President, Australia and Malta are pursuing similar objectives in different parts of<br />
the world.<br />
For us the development of economic and other linkages with the Asia Pacific region is<br />
the highest priority. 84153 </p>
<p>I know that your Government is keen to improve its institutional links with the<br />
European Community.<br />
But in the past such differences have no more stood in the way of our friendship than<br />
have the thousands of kilometres which separate us; and it will continue far into the<br />
future, I am sure.<br />
With Malta, as with all those countries from whence have come Australia's people,<br />
there is a thread of kinship which is bound to survive our pursuit of different destinies<br />
in our different parts of the. world.<br />
So Mr President, welcome to Australia and please enjoy your stay. I am sure as your<br />
travel around the country you will find among Australians of Maltese origin and<br />
otherwise that the bonds between us arc very warm and very strong.<br />
Thank you<br />
