PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, MANUKA OVAL 2 APRIL 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Are Australian workers entitled to expect tax<br />
cuts and a wage rise from July 1?<br />
PM: The tax cuts will come from July 1 and the specific<br />
timing of the wage cuts is a process of negotiation in the<br />
Commission, as you know.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any time-frame though?<br />
PM: I don't set the time-frame for that, that's negotiated<br />
and settled in the Arbitration Commission. That's well<br />
known, I don't set that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Simon Crean this morning agreed that this<br />
Government is a little bit unpopular. What do you say to<br />
that? PM: The test of the Government's popularity will be at the<br />
election, that's when it matters. There've been some<br />
reasonably bad items of news on the inflation front and the<br />
balance of payments front, interest rates are high. It's<br />
not a classic economic prescription for economic popularity,<br />
for political popularity, but I'm confident about the basic<br />
attitude of the Australian people to this Government, both<br />
now and when the election comes.<br />
