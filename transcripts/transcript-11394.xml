    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much Kevin. To your wife, Margie, to Mr Tom Sweeney, my State</p>
<p>   parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  When you started saying that there were similarities between myself and</p>
<p>   the founder of our Party, whose name has been given to this electorate,</p>
<p>   I allowed my mind to wander for a moment and I thought, well, is he going</p>
<p>   to, sort of, draw some sporting analogies. Because I was sitting next to</p>
<p>   a former Wallaby I thought to myself, well, to use a rugby analogy I think</p>
<p>   the founder would have got into the second row but I am probably 5/8th</p>
<p>   or halfback in terms of physical bulk.</p>
<p>  But, ladies and gentlemen, it's a great pleasure to be with you tonight</p>
<p>   and it's a pleasure to reflect very briefly before I have some other things</p>
<p>   to say about contemporary politics, to reflect very briefly about some of</p>
<p>   the things that were in that quite remarkable video. We were all struck</p>
<p>   by the incredible capacity of Sir Robert with his home movies and that remarkable</p>
<p>   footage of war torn Coventry. I remember when it was shown eight or nine</p>
<p>   years ago how incredibly impressive it was.</p>
<p>  Of course the old gentleman, he was fairly old then, the late Sir John Kramer</p>
<p>   who was Army Minister in the Menzies Government was my predecessor in the</p>
<p>   seat of Bennelong. He held it between 1949 and 1974 when he retired at the</p>
<p>   age of 78 and I took over the seat from him. And he lived to the age of</p>
<p>   97 and he towards the end of his life he wrote a memoir about his own political</p>
<p>   experiences and he invited me to launch it. And I well remember the occasion.</p>
<p>   And I read it in preparation for the launch and there was the odd chapter</p>
<p>   here and there that presented a slightly different version of the foundation</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party than the one that I'd been brought up on. And I said</p>
<p>   to John when I was watching, I said "this is very interesting",</p>
<p>   I said "I thought it occurred in a slightly different fashion but you</p>
<p>   seem to have rearranged it a little bit." And he said "My boy,</p>
<p>   when you reach my age there's nobody left around to contradict you."</p>
<p>   And I was reminded of him. But what was tremendously evocative about what</p>
<p>   he said on that video was the emphasis that he placed on the importance</p>
<p>   of the individual in our Party. And one of the things that we have always</p>
<p>   respected is the fact that as a political movement we do allow our membership</p>
<p>   on some issues to be a lot more pluralistic than do our political opponents.</p>
<p>   And I think that's a good thing.</p>
<p>  And that is why I am not going to, as some of our friends from the media</p>
<p>   might expect, I am not going to say anything tonight about the debate which</p>
<p>   is going to be resolved on the 6th of November in relation to</p>
<p>   our Constitution. Although I will say something in support of a "yes"</p>
<p>   vote for the preamble because we have a Government position on that. But</p>
<p>   in relation to the other issue I respect the fact that we are allowing a</p>
<p>   free vote within the Liberal Party on that issue as we should because of</p>
<p>   the special character of it. And part and parcel of respecting that free</p>
<p>   vote is that I choose not to use Liberal Party forums to put my own personal</p>
<p>   point of view. And it's one of the arrangements that we have entered into</p>
<p>   within our parliamentary party for the conduct of the issue.</p>
<p>  But it is a great pleasure for me to be in Kevin's electorate. And it's</p>
<p>   with great ease and enthusiasm that I commend him to you as a remarkable,</p>
<p>   hardworking, articulate and very effective local member. And I commend him</p>
<p>   to you as a person of great personal integrity and conscience and dedication.</p>
<p>   It is important that we have people in public life who feel very strongly</p>
<p>   about certain issues. You may not agree with them on those issues but it's</p>
<p>   very important that we have people who still believe in causes and issues</p>
<p>   as well as making sure that the continuity of the party's broad philosophy</p>
<p>   is continued.</p>
<p>  We have a remarkable opportunity in the Liberal Party at present at a national</p>
<p>   level to, if we are sensible, to secure more reforms and more beneficial</p>
<p>   changes and to really guide this nation of ours into the 21st</p>
<p>   Century.</p>
<p>  Economically Australia now, in my view, is stronger than it has been at</p>
<p>   any time since World War II. In many respects the economy's strength is</p>
<p>   more broadly based now than what it even was in the halcyon days of the</p>
<p>   Menzies period, strong though the Australian economy was then. Because the</p>
<p>   Australian economy now is a lot less protected. There is less artificiality</p>
<p>   about some of its strength now than was the case 30 years ago. We have fewer</p>
<p>   trade barriers. We have a less regulated economy. We are exporting a greater</p>
<p>   variety of products and services and we have tackled over the last few years</p>
<p>   some of the basic economic weaknesses that we had. And as a consequence</p>
<p>   we have given ourselves the remarkable situation where we have been able</p>
<p>   to stare down the worst economic downturn that the Asian-Pacific region</p>
<p>   has experienced since World War II.</p>
<p>  And if I'd have been talking to you a little over a year ago I would have</p>
<p>   said that although I thought the economy was going well and we had achieved</p>
<p>   a lot I felt that we were going to be in some way affected by the Asian</p>
<p>   economic downturn. And whilst we haven't been completely unscathed by it</p>
<p>   we have really achieved a continuing strength that has surprised the Government</p>
<p>   and it has certainly surprised all of the commentators and it has won us</p>
<p>   a great deal of national economic respect around the world.</p>
<p>  I don't want to bore you with statistics but we do have a rate of growth</p>
<p>   at present which is above the OECD average. We have a still very low level</p>
<p>   of inflation, a bit of a spike today due to the increase in the price of</p>
<p>   petrol as a result of the increase in the world price which has now begun</p>
<p>   to abate. But the underlying rate is still very low indeed. And we are enjoying</p>
<p>   the lowest interest rates for more than 30 years. And we have turned a $10.5</p>
<p>   billion budget deficit into a surplus.</p>
<p>  We have had a few things come along that we didn't expect including, of</p>
<p>   course, the additional defence commitment arising out of our activity in</p>
<p>   East Timor and I'll come to that in a moment. But we do have a great economic</p>
<p>   strength that has won us a lot of respect. And it's not come by accident</p>
<p>   it has come as a result of a lot of hard work in the three and a bit years</p>
<p>   that we have been in office. And you make your own luck in politics as in</p>
<p>   life. And we worked very hard to give Australia that economic strength and</p>
<p>   I hope its paid dividends in terms of better business conditions and a more</p>
<p>   benign and beckoning economic climate.</p>
<p>  So we do have an opportunity in the years ahead to leave a very decent legacy</p>
<p>   for the Australian people of this generation of Australian Liberals. But</p>
<p>   having in that sense, I suppose, tried to draw a bit of an analogy with</p>
<p>   the Menzies years I think I have to say to you that the world in which we</p>
<p>   now live is very different from the world in which Menzies reigned as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister. The political climate is a lot more volatile, it's unpredictable.</p>
<p>   I don't need to remind a Victorian Liberal audience of that. Very unpredictable.</p>
<p>   And the very disappointing and regrettable defeat of the Coalition Government</p>
<p>   here in Victoria is a sharp reminder to all of us of how unpredictable is</p>
<p>   the political world.</p>
<p>  We live in a political world that is less tribal than it used to be. Looking</p>
<p>   at that old footage you were reminded of the old divide that was created</p>
<p>   by the Cold War between the democratic west and the communist east. And</p>
<p>   that defined not only international politics but it also to a large extent</p>
<p>   defined domestic politics. That's gone. As a result you no longer have as</p>
<p>   many rusted on supporters of the two sides.</p>
<p>  I was brought up in politics to believe that 40 per cent of the community</p>
<p>   always voted Labor, 40 per cent always voted Liberal and the rest moved</p>
<p>   around in the middle. I now feel that it's down to 30 per cent voting Labor,</p>
<p>   30 per cent always voting Liberal with 40 per cent moving around in the</p>
<p>   middle. And elections are less predictable. You have to look at each election</p>
<p>   in its own right as a separate entity. You can't assume anything so much</p>
<p>   any more. And that means that electorates have to be constantly understood,</p>
<p>   listened to, sympathised with, interpreted and above all respected.</p>
<p>  Electorates are not automatically dazzled by everything that you regard</p>
<p>   yourself as having achieved. Electorates can appear on occasions to be ungrateful.</p>
<p>   We saw a man on the movie again tonight by the name of Churchill who thought</p>
<p>   he'd done a bit in winning a war and lost an election immediately the war</p>
<p>   was over in 1945. Probably the most spectacular example of the unpredictability</p>
<p>   of politics in the 20th Century.</p>
<p>  The message therefore out of all of that is that you can't as Liberals ever,</p>
<p>   or we can't as Liberals ever take anything for granted. You have to work</p>
<p>   everyday to understand and win the respect and the sympathy and support</p>
<p>   of the electorate. Electorates expect governments to do good things for</p>
<p>   them, that's what they elect them for. You don't get the same measure of</p>
<p>   gratitude for the good things you have done as you do their anger and disappointment</p>
<p>   for the things that you neglect to do and the mistakes that you make.</p>
<p>  I think over the last three and a half years we have given very good Government</p>
<p>   to the Australian people. But we have got to keep on doing that and we have</p>
<p>   got to understand as Liberals that they expect us to keep on doing it.</p>
<p>  Kevin was kind enough to mention my role in relation to what has happened</p>
<p>   in East Timor. That has been a very defining moment for Australia on the</p>
<p>   international stage. The peacekeeping operation that was assembled in East</p>
<p>   Timor was assembled with a speed which surpassed any other peacekeeping</p>
<p>   operation in living memory assembled under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
<p>   And in leading the activity that led to the establishment of that peacekeeping</p>
<p>   operation Australia was taking a very important stand for not only what</p>
<p>   was right but also for what was in Australia's national interest. And the</p>
<p>   skill and the professionalism of the men and women of the Australian Defence</p>
<p>   Force has been quite remarkable and has very understandably won the respect</p>
<p>   and the admiration of our allies and others around the world.</p>
<p>  We have unavoidably entered a difficult phase in our relationship with Indonesia.</p>
<p>   But I believe that that relationship can and will be rebuilt and there are</p>
<p>   already signs to that effect following the election of the new President</p>
<p>   and the new Vice-President of that country. And we should pause for a moment</p>
<p>   and reflect on what an extraordinary transformation has occurred in that</p>
<p>   nation of 211 million people. It is now the third largest democracy in the</p>
<p>   world. And over the last year it has gone through the process of converting</p>
<p>   itself into a democracy, the first democratically elected President in over</p>
<p>   30 years, it has accepted that East Timor is no longer part of the Republic</p>
<p>   of Indonesia. And all of this has occurred in this remarkable country to</p>
<p>   our north.</p>
<p>  Now, we have our differences and clearly the role we played in relation</p>
<p>   to East Timor represented a point of difference and a point of strain. But</p>
<p>   in the long run we have to accept that we are forever together in this part</p>
<p>   of the world and on a basis, a proper basis of mutual respect and understanding</p>
<p>   I am sure that we can rebuild that relationship and it will continue, I</p>
<p>   think, on a more practical, realistic and open and candid basis than perhaps</p>
<p>   has been the situation in the past.</p>
<p>  And it will also be important that the new nation of East Timor be part</p>
<p>   of that association because whatever the difficulties there may have been</p>
<p>   in the past and now and whatever the feelings are between the people of</p>
<p>   East Timor and the people of Indonesia it's very necessary that they also</p>
<p>   recognise that they have a common future together and a common destiny together.</p>
<p>   And the three of us, different sizes, different compositions, different</p>
<p>   cultures, different backgrounds but having in common the fact that we exist</p>
<p>   and will always exist together in this particular part of the world.</p>
<p>  But what Australia was able to do in relation to the events in East Timor</p>
<p>   have been very much to the credit and the reputation of our nation. Not</p>
<p>   something that one talks about in any boastful terms but realistically and</p>
<p>   soberly saying that we are a community that has been willing to take a leadership</p>
<p>   role, a community that has been willing sensibly and carefully to defend</p>
<p>   what is right and what is in our own long-term interests. But also importantly</p>
<p>   a country that had the national political will and the economic capacity</p>
<p>   to do it. Economically strong nations are listened to with greater respect</p>
<p>   than economically weak nations and economically strong nations have a capacity</p>
<p>   to do things that economically weak nations don't have a capacity to do.</p>
<p>   And there's a message in that for all of us coming out of what we have been</p>
<p>   able to achieve in strengthening the Australian economy over the last three</p>
<p>   and half years.</p>
<p>  Now, I mentioned, ladies and gentlemen, that I would have something very</p>
<p>   briefly to say about the second referendum question and that is the writing</p>
<p>   into our Constitution of a new preamble. It hasn't received a great deal</p>
<p>   of attention and it's Government policy to advocate a "yes" vote</p>
<p>   for that particular question. I would like to see that preamble supported.</p>
<p>   I would like to see it go into the Constitution. I think it would be a unifying</p>
<p>   thing for the Australian people if the community, irrespective of the different</p>
<p>   views it may have on the question of whether we change our other Constitutional</p>
<p>   arrangement. I think it would be a very unifying thing if we could put into</p>
<p>   our Constitution a statement of the fundamental beliefs and values of the</p>
<p>   Australian community. And particularly the reference in that preamble to</p>
<p>   the indigenous people would make a valuable contribution to the cause of</p>
<p>   reconciliation within the Australian community.</p>
<p>  We will inevitably continue to have a variety of views about how best to</p>
<p>   assist the indigenous people of the Australian community but it cannot be</p>
<p>   denied that as an identifiable group they remain the most disadvantaged</p>
<p>   within our society. Nor can it be denied that they have a special place</p>
<p>   within the Australian community as the first people of our nation. And it</p>
<p>   would make a marvellous unifying symbolic contribution to their place in</p>
<p>   the Australian community and the celebration of the Centenary of the Federation</p>
<p>   of the Australian Commonwealth if that preamble could be carried and that</p>
<p>   preamble could be inserted into the Australian Constitution.</p>
<p>  So I quite unapologetically at this gathering invite you to give your sympathetic</p>
<p>   support to the cause of an affirmative vote in relation to the preamble.</p>
<p>  And can I finish, ladies and gentlemen, in saying how important it is that</p>
<p>   gatherings like this occur that people gather around to provide significant</p>
<p>   financial and community support for members of Parliament. All of you in</p>
<p>   different ways are identified with the Liberal Party cause at a grass roots</p>
<p>   level here in the electorate of Menzies.</p>
<p>  I often say that everything that I have achieved in public life I owe to</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party. I would never have been a member of Parliament without</p>
<p>   the endorsement of the Liberal Party. I would never have been its Leader</p>
<p>   without its support. I would never have been Prime Minister without the</p>
<p>   support of the Liberal Party. And in the time that I have been Prime Minister</p>
<p>   I have received the most magnificent loyalty from the rank and file members</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party all around Australia whether it's in New South Wales</p>
<p>   or Victoria or Western Australia it's the same.</p>
<p>  Liberals are wonderfully supportive. I want you to know that I value that</p>
<p>   and I understand it. And I respect immensely the contribution that the rank</p>
<p>   and file of the party make to our existence. I came through the party organisation</p>
<p>   myself. I know how important it is to have a strong party organisation.</p>
<p>   A party organisation that supports the parliamentary party and gives it</p>
<p>   public loyalty but a party organisation that also has the capacity on occasions</p>
<p>   to say to the parliamentary party, we think you should do this particular</p>
<p>   thing in a slightly different fashion and to assert its role and its right</p>
<p>   and its prerogative and its authority in relation to those matters that</p>
<p>   properly belong to the party organisation.</p>
<p>  Now, I know that here in Victoria because of the defeat at a State level</p>
<p>   there is a process of stocktaking and introspection and review and assessment</p>
<p>   going on. And that is right and proper. I have always found within the party</p>
<p>   organisation amongst Liberals around Australia that where there is a willingness</p>
<p>   to do that then lessons are learnt, understandings are gained. And here</p>
<p>   in Victoria is no different in a sense from the process of introspection</p>
<p>   at a State level that has been going on in New South Wales since the defeat</p>
<p>   at a State level in New South Wales some months ago.</p>
<p>  We have a big challenge ahead of us over the next two years before the next</p>
<p>   federal election. We can't take that election for granted. I don't. It will</p>
<p>   be a very big challenge. We'll be asking for a third victory in a row. That</p>
<p>   is very achievable but it's not something we can assume is going to happen.</p>
<p>   And given the sort of climate of which I spoke earlier it will be something</p>
<p>   that we, all of us, collectively must ensure is not taken lightly. But if</p>
<p>   we continue to give quality Government to the people of Australia, if we</p>
<p>   continue to demonstrate a capacity to listen to them, to understand that</p>
<p>   there is within rural Australia a very significant feeling of alienation</p>
<p>   and disappointment that sections of our country are falling behind the generic</p>
<p>   plenty and prosperity of other parts of our community then I think we will</p>
<p>   retain and build upon the respect we now have within the Australian community.</p>
<p>  But none of us, and it didn't really need the result in the Victorian election</p>
<p>   although it's driven it home to us, none of us can ignore the fact that</p>
<p>   there are many parts of the Australian community that aren't sharing in</p>
<p>   the national economic well-being. We are doing very well as a nation but</p>
<p>   there are still pockets of Australia that are not sharing in that. And I</p>
<p>   think we all know it's human nature that if you feel that in relative terms</p>
<p>   you are missing out in a big way you feel a lot more keenly than if your</p>
<p>   disadvantage is, relatively speaking, not quite so profound.</p>
<p>  So we do have tremendous challenges in front of us but it's important that</p>
<p>   we remember some of the things that we saw on that video tonight. The emphasis</p>
<p>   on the individual, the emphasis on the family, the emphasis on a sense of</p>
<p>   community and a reminder that the Liberal Party of Australia was built on</p>
<p>   commonsense Australian values. Values that do respect the individual liberty</p>
<p>   that do respect the right of people to work hard and be properly rewarded</p>
<p>   and to keep the fruits of their effort and their commitment and their skill.</p>
<p>  And I think you have in Kevin a marvellous representative of that philosophy</p>
<p>   and that's why I am delighted to be here tonight. Delighted to commend him</p>
<p>   most warmly to you and delighted to congratulate those who put together</p>
<p>   the 200 Club. I wish it well, it'll make a magnificent contribution to the</p>
<p>   Liberal cause here in the nobly named seat of Menzies. Thank you.</p>
