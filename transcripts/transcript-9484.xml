TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO ROCKINGHAM HIGH SCHOOL, PERTH, WA<br />
16 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I'm always delighted to speak to young people particularly at schools but<br />
young people in Australia anywhere, because you often wonder what a Prime<br />
Minister does. Well let me tell you what this Prime Minister does most of the<br />
time, most of the things I am doing are about you, because I have<br />
tremendous faith and great excitement about young Australians. I believe in<br />
them 1 believe in you. And I know if we give you the opportunities, you will<br />
make this a more interesting and exciting country than the rest of us have<br />
made it. So, the greatest thing we can do for you is to give you the cOance to<br />
show what you can do for the rest of us and that means instilling ' in you a<br />
faith in this country, a belief that you have a unique opportunity, and the<br />
enthusiasm to go out and do things that when I was old as you I could only<br />
have dreamt about. In this country we have I think a unique opportunity,<br />
because there is one thing unique about us we are the only people in the<br />
world that have a continent to ourselves. And given the pressures of<br />
population, and the problems of ethnicity, the conflicts and the problems we<br />
have seen over the years, to have a continent to yourself gives you a chance<br />
as a nation to fashion a life and a future that few peoples have ever had. And<br />
we're not just about that continent, and how we develop it with all the<br />
opportunities to have a focus and a conscientious about the environment<br />
which gives us a style of living perhaps in the future unique among nations.<br />
But also, because we're a society with a well-developed set of values we<br />
should be putting a marker in the sand to say that in this continent of ours, we<br />
will be unique, and that we will create a unique social democracy.<br />
Now, you may say " well what does a unique social democracy mean?" What<br />
it means is that we will relate to one another, and have values about one<br />
another, that will lift the quality of this society above most other comparable<br />
societies. That is, we will reject the notion of a dog-eat-dog society, that the<br />
strongest take the best and the Devil takes the hind-most, and that we will<br />
together go forward as a society not with an underclass or sub-groups, but<br />
as one group. In other words, we have a loyalty to Australia, to the notion of<br />
what it has become, and a loyalty to one another. And through that strength<br />
we go on. PM PRESS OFFICEQ00 97<br />

and now with the ASEAN regional forum we are starting to look in strategic<br />
terms at the region. Australia is becoming much more a supplier of defence<br />
material, both in the maritime area with destroyers and frigates and<br />
submarines and as well as that we are working on some quite revolutionary<br />
other products such as over-the-horizon radar and we are also looking at<br />
some of the guided weapons as well.<br />
So, Australia is going to be a more significant force in the defence equipment<br />
area and, I think, this has now been recognised in south-east Asia and what<br />
better way of demonstrating it than to have you here being involved with us.<br />
So, I am absolutely delighted that you are here and that things are working<br />
well and I know how well this transition is taking place and how well you feel<br />
about it.<br />
So, I look forward to this becoming a bigger and better thing between us and<br />
these first tentative steps in your new facilities being here, we can sit back a<br />
bit and watch it grow and see these exercises together and see what we can<br />
do in the future. Defence relationships are always a tremendous friendship<br />
building thing because if the defence forces of various countries feel<br />
confident and relaxed with one another it just means that the whole<br />
background environment is better and so for that reason and no other, I am<br />
glad this is working. But, I appreciated being shown over the FAI Bs. To be<br />
buzzing around in one of those for most of the week probably beats the hell<br />
out of being Prime Minister I don't know although there is always<br />
somebody wanting my job you can never shake them off.<br />
But be that as it may, could I again, thank you very much for the hospitality,<br />
for coming to meet me, I have enjoyed having a chat to you. I'll talk to a few<br />
more of you before I leave and I couldn't think of a nicer way to end a West<br />
Australian visit than to come here. Thank you very much indeed.<br />
