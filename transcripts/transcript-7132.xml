PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 March 1987<br />
The releasu today of the ANOP youth survey shows clearly that<br />
the attitjues and views of young Australians are in line with<br />
my Govern* 0ent's youth strategy.<br />
It is very satisfying that the $ 1 billion invested by my<br />
Government': in our young people over the past two years is<br />
proving to bLe well spent.<br />
The survoe;, carried out by ANOP in October. 1986, was a<br />
continuation of the Government's commitment to consult young<br />
people. The survey highlights substantial support for measures being<br />
taken to increase school retention rates, improve income<br />
support, , u-elop traineeships and provide community work<br />
opportuni: irs tor the unemployed. Young people are placing<br />
more emrphi.,-s on the need for Government policy to be<br />
directed '. o. ards providing better training, education and<br />
other mech:. risms for attaining jobs rather than simply<br />
creating m. They also believe the Government should<br />
provide mury information and advice on these opportunities<br />
through sciciols and local information centres.<br />
To this end, my Government is pleased to announce two<br />
initiativ! s which I believe will enable more young people to<br />
see the pi-rz: onal relevance of the programs and policies<br />
available Lc them under our youth strategy.<br />
Firstly, the Government is setting up a comprehensive school<br />
informatior program to meet the needs of young people still<br />
at school.<br />
This p:) ogrdlii will reinforce for young people the advantages<br />
of completing Year 12 while at the same time ensuring that<br />
they ar jii,, ire of the student allowances available. It will<br />
also enco-: age them to take further education and training<br />
opportunities available if they choose to leave school early.<br />
By the enc' of this year, more than half of Australian<br />
schoolchildren will be staying on to Year 12, compared with<br />
just 36 per cent when we came to office. The school<br />
information program aims to boost school retention rates<br />
further. </p>
<p>Secondly, the Government is increasing to 100 the number of<br />
Youth Access Centres. These are one stop shops where<br />
information about all the Federal Government services for<br />
young people is available. The announced increases will<br />
allow a national network of Youth Access Centres to be<br />
establisher. Details of the two programs are provided in separate press<br />
releases fron the Minister for Education, Senator Ryan, the<br />
Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Willis.<br />
