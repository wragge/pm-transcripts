FOR PRESS 5 APRIL 1978<br />
INQUIRY INTO BEEFMARKETING AND PROCESSING<br />
BY THE PJT<br />
I have written to State Premiers requesting their<br />
co-operation on having relevant state and municipal<br />
abattoirs included in the inquiry to be conducted by<br />
the PJT into charges for beef marketing and processing.<br />
The PJT will examine margins at every stage of beef<br />
marketing and processing including charges by<br />
livestock selling agents, abattoirs and other processors<br />
and prices charged at the wholesale and retail levels.<br />
Details of the inquiry will be announced at a later<br />
date. I believe the outcome of the inquiry could greatly<br />
assist the search for marketing reforms and assist in<br />
restoring viability to the ailing cattle industry. </p>
