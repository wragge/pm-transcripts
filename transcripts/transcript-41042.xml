    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia categorically condemns North Korea’s first launch of an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile. </p>
<p>This is a further dangerous escalation by a reckless regime.</p>
<p>The Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile launch is a dangerous and provocative act that destabilises the region and directly threatens all nations within range of this offensive weapon.</p>
<p>Australia will work with our international partners and allies to demonstrate that a provocation of this kind will bear consequences.</p>
<p>We again urge China to use its considerable leverage to rein in the dangerous behaviour of the North Korean leadership.</p>
<p>The world expects that we live in a rules-based system and this unacceptable missile launch is in breach of numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions.</p>
<p>Australia has agreed to expanded autonomous sanctions against North Korea in response to its persistent threatening behaviour.</p>
<p>These sanctions will target North Korea’s extractive industries and its shipping network.</p>
<p>We will expand the grounds on which the Government can designate individuals and entities for targeted financial sanctions and travel bans.</p>
<p>Australia calls on all countries to implement UN Security Council Resolutions against North Korea as a matter of urgency, including UN Resolution 2356, adopted to on 2 June 2017.</p>
<p>Australia supports defensive measures required to respond to the threat posed by North Korean offensive missiles.  Any escalation of regional tensions is entirely the responsibility of the North Korean regime, which continues to brazenly threaten regional and global peace.</p>
<p>I will raise North Korea’s grave disregard for regional peace at my G20 meetings this week, and urge G20 leaders to take further strong action against North Korea.</p>
