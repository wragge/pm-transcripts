SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM<br />
The following statement was issued in Apia tonight by<br />
the Australian delegation to the South Pacific Forum Meeting:<br />
S" The Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Michael<br />
Somare, denied categorically that he had been involved in any<br />
' horse play' with sailors from HMAS Vampire in Aggie's Hotel<br />
on Monday night. Both Mr Somare and the Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam,<br />
t1 ad been engaged in some light-hearted encounters with crew<br />
members from Vampire and one sailor had mistaken the Chief<br />
Minister's identity. He at once apologised for the mistake.<br />
At no time was Mr Somare man-handled by the sailors<br />
in any way. In fact, Mr Somare, like Mr Whitlam, much enjoyed<br />
his informal encounter with members of HMAS Vampire." </p>
