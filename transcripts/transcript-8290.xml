FOR MEDIA 2 MAY 1991<br />
Last Friday, I released a statement outlining the basis for<br />
a resolution of the impasse reached between unions and<br />
employers on -waterfront industry reforms.<br />
Since then, at my direction, there have been intensive<br />
negotiations by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation<br />
Support, Senator Collins, with unions and employers.<br />
As a result, -the parties have accepted the Government<br />
proposal that this matter should be finalised by:<br />
the employers and the unions implementing an agreement<br />
effective from 16 May 1991 through the life of the In-<br />
Principle Agreement ( IPA); the agreement to be closed<br />
except for any general community wage adjustments, and<br />
productivity-based arrangements mutually agreed in<br />
accordance with enterprise agreements under the IPA.<br />
The partiLes, as indicated below, will jointly seek<br />
endorsement of this agreement by the Australian<br />
Industrial Relations Commission ( AIRC)<br />
As to rates of pay, there shall be the following<br />
adj ustmeunts: the first adjustment to be $ 12 per week from the<br />
first pay period on or after 16 May<br />
an aggregate 6.12% adjustment in three equal<br />
instalments consistent with the agreed<br />
classification structure<br />
Wi the first instalment will be available from 1<br />
July 1991, on an enterprise by enterprise<br />
basis, and be paid only when Enterprise Based<br />
Agreements ( EBA) approved by the Waterfront<br />
Industry Reform Authority ( WIRA) are in place<br />
and employees have been reclassified under<br />
the new structure<br />
( ii) the second and third instalments will be<br />
available from 1 January 1992, and 1 July<br />
1992, provided the EBA is being successfully<br />
implemented and delivering productivity<br />
improvements consistent with that agreement. </p>
<p>Employees accepting the WIRA early retirement/ redundancy<br />
package are not eligible for reclassification as they will<br />
leave the industry once the enterprise agreement has been<br />
implemented. It is agreed that the " no extra claims" concerns have been<br />
met in the terms of this agreement.<br />
The employers and the unions have agreed on the changes in<br />
the rates of pay and the conditions of this agreement<br />
attaching to these changes.<br />
Representatives of the Unions have undertaken to submit this<br />
agreement to their members.<br />
Representatives of the Association of the Employers of<br />
Waterside Labour have undertaken to recommend to their<br />
National Council the acceptance of this agreement. Conaust<br />
has also indicated its support for the agreement.<br />
It is agreed that the parties jointly approach the IRC,<br />
before which this matter is currently being considered by<br />
Commissioner Sweeney and to whom a Report Back is due to be<br />
made next Monday.<br />
It is agreed that the parties will report progress and, in<br />
the event of the agreement between them being ratified, the<br />
parties will jointly approach Commissioner Sweeney to<br />
endorse it.<br />
The parties agree to make this approach to Commissioner<br />
Sweeney on the basis of determining a part-heard matter<br />
under the processes of the binding IPA according to the<br />
principles of the 1988-89 National Wage Case decisions.<br />
The parties agreed:<br />
to negotiate a separate award for Container Depots and<br />
Security Officers<br />
to negotiate a clause on day work provisions and on<br />
overtime and double header provisions, including<br />
uniform Sunday and public holiday rates<br />
that the above and other award conditions be negotiated<br />
between the parties and finalised with the assistance<br />
of the Commission, including through arbitration if<br />
necessary that a suitable timetable be agreed between the parties<br />
and Commissioner Sweeney to give effect to this clause.<br />
All other negotiations covering matters other than wages and<br />
conditions within the IPA should continue under the auspices<br />
of the WIRA. </p>
<p>3.<br />
The employers agree that under this agreement the valuation<br />
of classifications will involve no reduction of pay for any<br />
classification. The parties agree that on this basis they<br />
will enter negotiations to seek agreement on the<br />
classification pay relativities. In the absence of<br />
agreement out of such negotiations, it is agreed that the<br />
matter will be arbitrated by the IRC on the basis of no<br />
reduction in pay for any classification. The parties<br />
reserve their rights at the expiry of this agreement to<br />
argue without prejudice whatever pay rates relativities they<br />
consider appropriate. </p>
