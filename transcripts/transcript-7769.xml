PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES, RADIO 2UE,<br />
9 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JONES: My special guest in the studio, nice and early,<br />
pristine in the white shirt too, the Prime Minister. Good<br />
morning. PM: how are you?<br />
JONES: No, mine's not white.<br />
PM: Isn't it? What colour is it?<br />
JONES: I don't know, but it's not white.<br />
PM: Alright.<br />
JONES: Have you backed a winner in the weekend?<br />
PM: Yes, but backed more losers.<br />
JONES: Well, we better start with the Melbourne Cup tip<br />
before we get any further.<br />
PM: Well, Almaarad's the class horse in the field.<br />
JONES: Almaarad.<br />
PM: But it's too early. I never make my selections for the<br />
Melbourne Cup till a couple of days beforehand, you know<br />
that. JONES: Is that owned by an Egyptian or something?<br />
PM: Now, now, don't be racist.<br />
JONES: I'm not, they just seem to have all the money to get<br />
the best horses. Before we go this morning and get on to<br />
this business, can I just play you a little extract of a<br />
call that we had earlier this morning?<br />
PM: Yes. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JONES: Because a lot of the people are ringing up about<br />
what should be said and this was one piece of advice about<br />
our interview this morning that one of the callers gave<br />
CALLER: What I'd like you to do is, when you do direct the<br />
question to the Prime Minister, would you ask him please not<br />
to give us a bloody history lesson?<br />
JONES: Yes.<br />
CALLER: Every question, you know, a classic, go back a few<br />
months you spoke to him. You said to him ' what are you<br />
going to do about those people that are suffering because of<br />
the pilots' problem'. He turned and give us a history<br />
lesson what he'd done. Your question was ' what are you<br />
going to do?'.<br />
JONES: There you are. So can we keep those guidelines in<br />
place, perhaps?<br />
PM: Sure, sure, sure.<br />
JONES: OK. Just take the pilots' dispute if we might.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JONES: The pilots now having rejected at the beginning the<br />
whole notion of Industrial Relations Commission and six<br />
percent, now seem to have virtually said ' well, if the<br />
Commission will save us, we'll be saved'.<br />
PM: Well, they said it at the beginning, as you say, yes,<br />
the guidelines they knew enough about the guidelines to<br />
say they wouldn't have a bar of them. Now they say ' now<br />
we've found out what the guidelines are, we might be in<br />
there'. The fact is, Alan, that the airlines are just<br />
building up their employees and if the members of the<br />
Federation want to be in that, they can apply to the<br />
airlines to join and there'll be an opportunity for work for<br />
them. Now whether the Commission makes them part of the<br />
award making process is a matter for the Commission, mate.<br />
JONES: Doesn't this mean at the end of the day really, to<br />
look at it realistically, that there are going to be 200<br />
fewer pilots?<br />
PM: Many more less than that, mate.<br />
JONES: Yes.<br />
PM: Many more less than that.<br />
JONES: So this bloke has induced everyone to resign,<br />
they'll have no job to turn to and no redundancy package as<br />
a result of the fact that he asked them to resign? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: You were talking about racing before. I said he's<br />
delivered the greatest trifecta in industrial relations<br />
history. He's cost them their jobs, their seniority and<br />
their redundancies. I don't think there could have been, in<br />
the history of industrial relations in this country, a worse<br />
delivery by a union or employer leadership than is the case<br />
here. JONES: The interesting issue in all of this, of course, is<br />
that you're belted around the head, as are all your<br />
predecessors, because in fact you've not been tough enough<br />
with recalcitrant unions. You've certainly been very tough<br />
and I have supported that stand here. What my callers are<br />
now saying is ' what are you going to do about the waterfront<br />
where it seems that the problem there is completely out of<br />
hand. Are you going to be as tough with the Waterside<br />
Workers' Federation as with the Pilots' Federation?'<br />
PM: well, just let me say three things about that. Without<br />
going into history, let me make this point which you're<br />
aware of, that when we came to office in ' 83 for 31 of the<br />
previous 34 years the other mob had been in office. So we<br />
came into a situation where the culture and the tradition of<br />
the waterfront and everywhere else had been formed under the<br />
conservatives, they've done nothing. What we have done is<br />
to set up this tripartite group. They've given us a report,<br />
the employers, the users<br />
JONES: Which is a disastrous-<br />
PM: Well, at least it's a start and what Willis said in<br />
June is that if they don't face up to the major issues, then<br />
we will be prepared to consider the withdrawal of financial<br />
assistance to the industry on the waterfront and to take<br />
direct action. I think there will be advances out of this.<br />
If they don't do it cooperatively we'll have to look at<br />
doing it more directly.<br />
JONES: See, it seems to me Prime minister, this is much<br />
worse I mean, I've got a table here which you can actually<br />
see but this is much worse than the Pilots' Federation<br />
because here we have average delays per ship coming into<br />
Sydney Harbour of 70.3 hours. one of these vehicles, this<br />
was in August, was delayed by 110 hours, another one by 109,<br />
another one by 131, another one of 84. The cost to this<br />
country is enormous of that, isn't it?<br />
PM: Yes, the inefficiencies of the waterfront are<br />
unacceptably high. That's why we're taking this first step<br />
of trying to get the parties together and say ' now look,<br />
agree on improvements, agree on getting rid of the older<br />
labour, get rid of people who are not the most efficient<br />
you can have there, see if we can get an agreed wage through<br />
between the employers and the trade unions and the<br />
waterfront authorities and if you can't do it that way then </p>
<p>-4-<br />
( PM cont): we will have to act more directly'. But, Alan,<br />
you know that in this area that if you just tried to impose<br />
some solution immediately from above it wouldn't work. So<br />
we're going to try and do it via consultation<br />
JONES: But you have done pilots' dispute and it has<br />
worked. PM: Well, what we've done in the pilots' dispute is to say,<br />
leave it to the employers and those who want to work with<br />
them ( crashing sound and giggles)<br />
JONES: That's part of the world of the media, Prime<br />
Minister. PM: Part of the world of the media. It's just like Bourke<br />
Street on a busy day isn't it?<br />
JONES: Yes it is, it is. But, see, part of this report<br />
that's been brought out talks about a redundancy package of<br />
$ 160,000. Now, there's no way in the world you'd allow that<br />
to proceed, would you?<br />
PM: Well, you've got to get, the heart of the thing is that<br />
what is being said is that the age of workforce is such that<br />
you need to get rid of a lot of these people who are<br />
Now, to get rid of people there you've got to have some<br />
sort of redundancy arrangement to get rid of them. In the<br />
end, the calculations are that you'll get a very significant<br />
improvement in productivity on the waterfront if you get rid<br />
of the older people, bring in newer people and also get the<br />
concept of rather than pooled employment, but of individual<br />
employer/ employee relationship. For God's sake, Alan, give<br />
us credit for being the first Government in 35 years to do<br />
something about it.<br />
JONES: Yes, I think that you've set a precedent for<br />
yourself though haven't you? You've acted responsibly and<br />
tough with a recalcitrant Pilots' Federation. Now this<br />
seems to be the most damaging other issue in relation to the<br />
economy and our export capacity and credibility.<br />
PM: But here I mean, in the case of the pilots, what<br />
we're doing there is to resist a wages claim which, as<br />
you've been good enough to acknowledge right through, would<br />
have busted the economy. It's not a question of wages claim<br />
here, it's a question of practices. Now in the pilots case,<br />
of course, as again you've recognised, as a result of<br />
resisting an unacceptably high wages claim we are getting<br />
tremendous productivity improvements in the airline<br />
operating industry. In this case, there is no suggestion of<br />
unrealistically high wages, it's tackling </p>
<p>JONES: But they're getting $ 800 a week on average for about<br />
27 hours, the waterside workers. $ 800 a week on average for<br />
27 hours?<br />
PM: But, what I'm saying<br />
JONES: That nick off schemes?<br />
PM: Look, what I'm saying in regard to wages system which<br />
operates there and the wages outcome, they have been<br />
negotiated within the system. Now, what hasn't operated in<br />
a way which is useful to the Australian economy is the range<br />
of practices which has produced in Australia an unacceptably<br />
high level of delays and lack of productivity in the<br />
waterfront industry. That's what we've got to deal with,<br />
but there's no suggestion there that the waterfront<br />
employers and the waterfront workers are now trying to break<br />
the wages guideline system. It's a different and more<br />
long-seated problem which has been allowed to grow up in<br />
this country over the whole of the post war period. what<br />
I'm saying is that at least now, give us credit for the fact<br />
that after these 31 years of the other mob making it worse,<br />
and worse, and worse, we're the first Government now to<br />
tackle it. I can assure you that under this Government,<br />
there will be improvements.<br />
JONES: OK, just go back, one final question on the airline<br />
industry. Just some figures we took out here. On September<br />
18, according to my figures, 12,256 passengers flew<br />
domestically in Australia, but of those Ansett and<br />
Australian were only carrying 2,000 passengers. That's<br />
about 16 percent of them. Now you've argued quite<br />
consistently that we're going to get it up to 50, up to<br />
percent, but when are we going to get Ansett and Australian?<br />
I mean many of those were being carried by the RAAF planes,<br />
by foreign carriers, by commuter services, by leased<br />
aircraft PM: That's right.<br />
JONES: When are we going to get it up to Ansett and<br />
Australian being able to take over the role that they had<br />
prior to this dispute?<br />
PM: That will increasingly happen now. We've never put the<br />
figures as other than that. It's a question of saying<br />
something like, it's getting up towards 60 percent now of<br />
the seats available in relation to what seats were available<br />
before. But, of course, you're right in saying that it's<br />
being made up in the components you talk about. Now,<br />
increasingly you will see that changing because what's<br />
happening is that the airlines are getting more and more<br />
applicants. Ansett's made it clear that they've got 1,000<br />
applicants now. That training process will go on, the<br />
recruitment process will go on. So you will see in the </p>
<p>-6-<br />
( PM cont): weeks ahead as their own pilots are being<br />
recuited and trained that the proportion of Ansett and<br />
Australian, of total operating capacity will increase.<br />
JONES: But are we going to be flying in RAAF planes at<br />
Christmas? PM: I doubt it very much.<br />
JONES: So you think we'll be back to capacity? What time<br />
frame do you put on it?<br />
PM: Look, you've known me long enough. If I don't know the<br />
answer, I'm not going to make it up. But it will<br />
increasingly occur now because the pilots are faced with a<br />
situation, the members of the Federation are faced, as they<br />
know with a situation, unless they apply now, Alan, for<br />
their jobs they are going to miss out.<br />
JONES: OK. Well, let's get on to the big issue of the last<br />
couple of days Kakadu. You must surely be aware, as a man<br />
who's got his finger on the pulse and his antenna up, that I<br />
don't think there's one political commentator in the country<br />
who hasn't said that it's an act of political expediency. I<br />
am sure you've read the editorial in the Australian today<br />
which says rarely has the future of so many been compromised<br />
by so few for such an unworthy cause. Could I just put it<br />
to you that we're all in favour of the environment and we<br />
all recognise the virtue of Kakadu National Park. But Sir<br />
Arvi Parbo said the Government's word can no longer be taken<br />
and valued and accepted in the light of what's<br />
PM: OK. Let's get straight into that, eh? Sir Arvi Parbo,<br />
talking about people whose word can't be taken. Let's nail<br />
Sir Arvi straight away because he deliberately went on the<br />
media of Australia and misrepresented, presumably<br />
deliberately, the situation in regard to the communication<br />
between us. So if he's talking about who can be trusted,<br />
let's have it right on the line, Sir Arvi. You have left an<br />
impression that I declined to return your call. The facts<br />
are, which is a pity the media didn't have the decency to<br />
check with my office, is that he rang. Right? One. Two, I<br />
wasn't there in my office. Three, he didn't ask for a call<br />
to be returned, he simply pointed out that there was some<br />
suggestion going around, he understood, that perhaps BHP<br />
wasn't still interested in Coronation Hill and he just<br />
wanted to leave a message with the Prime Minister, which we<br />
knew by writing, that BHP was still interested. No<br />
suggestion or a request for a return call, but this man<br />
talks about whether you can be trusted or not is<br />
deliberately leaving the impression that he asked for a call<br />
to be returned. So let's have Arvi Parbo right on the line </p>
<p>-7-<br />
JONES: But he is the Chairman of BHP<br />
PM: OK<br />
JONES: And you did tell them they could go ahead with the<br />
mine PM: And he is also the person who's bringing into question<br />
whether someone's word can be trusted or not. So, Sir Arvi<br />
Parbo can't be trusted in terms of the relationship between<br />
the Government and BHP. Now, let's get to the question of<br />
Coronation Hill and BHP. Very simple. We said to BHP, go<br />
ahead, do your EIS and they had done that. I was asked<br />
yesterday, you know, almost shouldn't BHP be congratulated<br />
for doing the right thing. BHP were doing no more than<br />
obeying the law of this country.<br />
JONES: No, but you virtually said to Loton, didn't you, to<br />
be fair, you've said to Loton in a letter no worries,<br />
this is going to go ahead, this will be OK, you've got my<br />
word for it, you said that to Loton and you wrote that to<br />
Loton didn't you?<br />
PM: I'll show you exactly what I wrote to Loton so that<br />
there be no gild on the lily. This is what I wrote ' I can<br />
assure you there's been no change in Government policy on<br />
the conservation zone concept or in relation to Coronation<br />
Hill'. Now there hadn't been any change in regard to the<br />
concept, certainly the size. Just let me, so that you know<br />
exactly, this Now, look, because I'll show you, here's<br />
the Cabinet decision.<br />
JONES: Alright.<br />
PM: That letter to Brian Loton was on 9 October 1987<br />
following a Cabinet decision of 4 June 1987. Now let me<br />
show you, you can read this here. The Cabinet noted that<br />
resolution of these issues, that is the final boundaries of<br />
the zone, the final resolution be that it should be based on<br />
the following principles. There will not be any increase in<br />
the overall size of the conservation zone, any change<br />
should, as far as possible, involve an increase in the size<br />
of the South Alligator River catchment area within the park.<br />
That is a reduction in the zone and any change that, as far<br />
as practicable, maximise the area of the park around of<br />
particular environmental importance. Now what I have said<br />
to BHP, no change in the concept or, in relation to<br />
Coronation Hill, and that is right.<br />
JONES: But now Cook was carrying the case in Cabinet wasn't<br />
he for approval of the Coronation Hill mine and retention of<br />
the old exploration zone boundaries? Now, I wasn't in<br />
Canberra, but the argument is that Cook didn't get into the<br />
Cabinet room </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PM: Eh? He was there for the whole of the discussion.<br />
JONES: Are you talking<br />
PM: The whole of the discussion.<br />
JONES: The arguments out of Canberra are that you spent an<br />
hour and a half on the phone to Phillip Toyne<br />
PM: Now, come on, let's no, don't jump from one point<br />
JONES: No, well hang on, no I'm coming to<br />
PM: Inaudible<br />
JONES: I'll come to Cook in a minute.<br />
PM: No you didn't, you started with Cook.<br />
JONES: Righto, we'll go back<br />
PM: And you said he didn't get into the Cabinet room.<br />
JONES: OK.<br />
PM: Wrong. He was in the Cabinet room for the whole of the<br />
discussions. JONES: He was in the Cabinet room. Well, Walsh and Dawkins<br />
and Button and Cook were opposed to the decision weren't<br />
they?<br />
PM: What were the names, which<br />
JONES: Walsh? There's no way Walsh would have supported it<br />
PM: Well, come on give us the names.<br />
JONES: Walsh. Yay or nay? Peter Walsh.<br />
PM: Come on, the rest of them?<br />
JONES: No, what about Walsh. Was he in support of it or<br />
not? PM: I'm not going to tell you<br />
JONES: Dawkins?<br />
PM: I'm not going to tell you who in the<br />
JONES: Button?<br />
PM: who in the Cabinet voted which way or another. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
JONES: Button and Cook.<br />
PM: I'm not going to tell you who voted which way or<br />
another. Firstly, there was no vote.<br />
JONES: But I'm putting it to you that they didn't support<br />
it. PM: I have said, I have said that there were differences of<br />
opinion. of course there were.<br />
JONES: So you adopted a unique strategy here, didn't you?<br />
You put your reputation on the line, you led the debate<br />
PM: I didn't put my reputation on the line, I just put the<br />
arguments there.<br />
JONES: But you've never done that before, have you? You've<br />
never PM: Yes, I have before. Yes, I have before. Look, see<br />
what you've got to remember is that we had discussed it<br />
before, Alan we discussed it before. This wasn't first up.<br />
I'd spent a lot of time dealing with it so I thought well<br />
we're going to have it quite clear, here's the issues, this<br />
is what I think ought to happen, it's not as though this was<br />
the beginning of the discussion.<br />
JONES: Are you worried about the greenies, politically?<br />
PM: No, I'm not worried about them. I mean we've been<br />
doing a bit of light hearted bantering here to some extent.<br />
But there's a very important question you ask here, Alan<br />
about the greenies. I think it's a fact of life, not only<br />
in Australia but around the world, that there is an<br />
increasing realisation about the importance of the<br />
environment. I mean I think this now Alan, you'd agree, it<br />
cuts right across<br />
JONES: We do agree.<br />
PM: Economic groups, aged groups<br />
JONES: I think all Australia agrees with that.<br />
PM: So when we're talking on this issue about whether it's<br />
the greenies or not, it's not the organised green movement<br />
whether it's the Wilderness Society, the Conservation<br />
Foundation we've just got kids, women, old and young<br />
people out there who are fundamentally now concerned about<br />
the obligation we have to protecting the environment now and<br />
into the future. So I think that politics are being shaped<br />
here and around the world by that fact. It's not because<br />
you've got an organised group, I just think people are<br />
saying now that there are things that governments have got </p>
<p>( PM cont) to take into account when they make a decision,<br />
whether it's about a mine or something else, have got to<br />
take these things into account, and I take them into<br />
account. I make no apology for that at all.<br />
PM: And you must as Prime Minister. But let me put another<br />
scenario to you. Out in the western suburbs of Sydney and<br />
the western suburbs of Melbourne and right across Australia,<br />
people on $ 380 a week, if they've got a house could be<br />
paying up to 16, 17 or 18% interest rates.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JONES: Now they are paying those interest rates because<br />
we've got a yawning current account deficit, the only way we<br />
can fund that debt is to get money in from overseas at that<br />
rate. we could reduce that debt by starting that Coronation<br />
Hill mine, we could reduce it earlier that otherwise would<br />
be the case. So put down ruthlessly and bluntly, you have<br />
preferred the greenies to middle Australia on 18%.<br />
PM: Now there's two things to say about that. It's like a<br />
lot of your propositions, you very sensibly, you use the<br />
dramatic illustration to try and draw out an argument.<br />
There are two things that need to be said about it. In<br />
terms of the total picture of Australia's economic<br />
operations as is said of the front page of today's<br />
Financial Review, and no doubt you would've read it this<br />
is absolutely marginal, absolutely marginal in the totality<br />
of things. But the second point I make to you is this and<br />
I'd like your response to it; you will concede that the<br />
logic of what you're saying is that in a situation like this<br />
it's the economic imperative that should always apply. That<br />
means why don't we drill for<br />
JONES: inaudible<br />
PM: We'll you're saying that I have put environmental<br />
considerations ahead of an economic one. OK, why shouldn't<br />
I authorise drilling for oil on the Barrier Reef because<br />
there might be oil there? People wanted to drill for oil<br />
there and according to<br />
JONES: It's not analogous with Kakadu Park.<br />
PM: Why isn't it?<br />
JONES: Well because Collins who knows the thing backwards,<br />
your own Labor Senator up there, knows it backwards and he<br />
said that the people he's spoken to are supportive of it,<br />
it's not in fact desecrating the environment. You've got<br />
people in your own Cabinet saying it and we've got this<br />
yawning current account debt.<br />
PM: We've got a current account<br />
JONES: That's an economic imperative, isn't it? </p>
<p>-11-<br />
PM: We've got a current account debt and let me say that<br />
one of the greatest sources of revenue into the future to<br />
deal with that current account debt is tourism. one of the<br />
great features of Australian tourism is Kakadu. If we were<br />
to do anything, this is a balance of argument about whether<br />
you would damage Kakadu or not, I say you should err on the<br />
side of caution.<br />
JONES: But this isn't Kakadu, PM. This 25 square<br />
kilometres in an outfit which is what, 2000 square<br />
kilometres. PM: You say it's not Kakadu. This is the catchment area<br />
and I think you understand this this is the catchment area<br />
which feeds into Kakadu. what we have done is to put the<br />
overwhelming proportion now of the catchment area, the whole<br />
water system of Kakadu, into a national park.<br />
JONES: inaudible<br />
PM: You are saying that you've got Kakadu here which is all<br />
water and it's fed from here, this isn't in Kakadu. If this<br />
JONES: I know it's in Kakadu but..<br />
PM: If something happens here and the water system going<br />
into there you have buggered for all time<br />
JONES: But see don't you think that you are in fact -not<br />
intentionally, I'm not suggesting this deliberately -but<br />
you are also deceiving the electorates. You see the<br />
perception I can tell you the electorate have out there is<br />
that there's this glorious wasteland which is completely<br />
untouched and we're stopping these terrible despoilers from<br />
BHP from ruining it, when in fact this place, this area what<br />
you've called the conservation zone and now you're calling<br />
the exploration zone, was mined in the ' 50s and ' 60s, it's<br />
got a gigantic hole in it, and Bob Collins has said I mean<br />
do you think he's on the wrong wave length these are his<br />
constituents? He said this is a nonsense. This thing has<br />
got no conservation value at all.<br />
PM: He hasn't said that. Let me make the point to you and<br />
JONES: But it has been mined, hasn't it. It has been<br />
mined, hasn't it? In the ' 50s and<br />
PM: Of course it's been mined in the past. A lot of things<br />
happened in the ' 50s<br />
JONES: It's got a big hole in it. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
PM: It hasn't got a big hole in it. Stop this business of<br />
you know, have you stopped beating your wife because you<br />
know that doesn't work with me. Now just come down a gear,<br />
come down a gear, my friend and just recognise this. A lot<br />
of things happened in the ' 50s and ' 60s, did they not? A<br />
lot of things happened in the ' 50s and ' 60s which if we had<br />
the knowledge that we have now about the environment, we<br />
wouldn't have allowed to happen, right?<br />
JONES: Yes, sure.<br />
PM: OK. Now let's just come back to this point, Alan.<br />
Here's Kakadu up here, your wetlands. This area can be as<br />
unattractive, some of it, as you like. Some of it is very<br />
attractive. Do you realise that just with only 2 or 3<br />
kilometres from one of these mining areas where the shot was<br />
taken in Crocodile Dundee which you'd recall<br />
JONES: Yes I've seen that.<br />
PM: You know the lovely shot. So it's not all what has<br />
been referred to by one of my colleagues as clapped out<br />
buffalo country.<br />
JONES: Gareth Evans, next President of the United Nations.<br />
PM: Sure, sure. Is he next? numbers?<br />
JONES: Him running the United Nations and Malcolm Fraser<br />
running the Commonwealth.<br />
PM: inaudible<br />
JONES: What chances<br />
PM: We'll have a talk about that in a minute. We'll have a<br />
talk about that in a minute. Look, you know that this can<br />
be in itself relatively unattractive but if coming through<br />
here you have the water system which feeds into the wetlands<br />
of the Kakadu Park, it doesn't matter if that is<br />
unattractive as Billy Smith's backside. If in fact the<br />
water system going into the Kakadu is coming through here,<br />
then that's what you've got to take account of.<br />
JONES: Alright. Well let me just put another thing to you.<br />
You've done that for the environmentalists and you believe<br />
that's an issue and you've accommodated it<br />
PM: Now I haven't done it just for the environmentalists,<br />
it's for everyone.<br />
JONES: Right, OK. Now what about middle Australia on 18%?<br />
What can they look forward to between now and the election? </p>
<p>-13-<br />
PM: Well they can look forward to this; you've got tight<br />
fiscal policy, tight wages policy and we'll keep monetary<br />
policy as tight as is necessary until we can see the level<br />
of activity coming down. I still believe that as we get<br />
into next year, Alan we'll have seen the level of activity<br />
coming down and I believe that will allow some easing of<br />
policy then. But I have said and Paul says, we both say we<br />
won't be easing monetary policy until we do see that<br />
actually coming down.<br />
JONES: OK, so you talk about next year. Now does that mean<br />
that an election for this year is out? Can I just put a<br />
scenario to it? It does seem to me doesn't it that if you<br />
were to have an election this year, you'd have to announce<br />
it according to the Electoral Act 33 days back by the<br />
end of October or before the end of October, which is the<br />
end of this month. You're going to be away in part of this<br />
month. Does that logistics remove entirely, whether you'd<br />
like it or not, the prospect of an election this year?<br />
PM: Well, virtually. I mean as you know I've and I think<br />
I've said it to you before Alan, talking on the radio I've<br />
always thought that the election will be in 1990. I mean<br />
I've conceded yesterday that some of my people have been<br />
talking to me about the possibility of this year and I<br />
listen to what people say, it's silly if you've responsible<br />
people around you to say ' I'm not going to listen to you'.<br />
But I've listened to them and I really believe that the<br />
election will be next year.<br />
JONES: Now on that 18%, you last week gave $ 200M to four<br />
banks which on aggregate I think, had profits to June 30 of<br />
about $ 3.9B. What about the building societies? Where do<br />
the hundreds of thousands of people borrowing from building<br />
societies PM: You know the difference there. What was done in regard<br />
to the banks was that we have got what we call non-callable<br />
deposits from them in which there is a penalty interest<br />
rate. Now since the time at which that penalty was fixed,<br />
because of the rise in market rates, the size of the penalty<br />
has increased. So what we essentially did was to bring the<br />
penalty back to what it was at the beginning. And as a<br />
result of doing that, these banks are able to hold mortgage<br />
rates at 17%. Now I don't think anyone can argue that<br />
that's not a sensible thing to do.<br />
JONES: But at $ 3.9B profit the penalty couldn't have been<br />
affecting them too much, could it? </p>
<p>-14-<br />
PM: Oh well now are you introducing the concept now I<br />
mean it's interesting if you are that what you expect of<br />
banks and other sectors of private enterprise is to act in a<br />
way which is non-market oriented and to act<br />
philanthropically? I mean I would be quite prepared to<br />
entertain that discussion with you but what's happenening,<br />
as you know, is that the cost of their funds-<br />
JONES: That's the market orientation-<br />
PM: If we've got-<br />
JONES: You're interfering with the market-<br />
PM: If we've got the new Alan Jones philosophy-<br />
JONES: That's not new. Perfectly consistent. You're<br />
interfering with the market, you're giving them $ 200M of our<br />
money. PM: I'm saying that we are restoring in that market<br />
situation the penalty that we had in the market operation<br />
when we started the non-callable deposits system. We didn't<br />
change that, we restored it to what it was and within that<br />
then the market operates.<br />
JONES: Just one final thing, because we've got to go. A<br />
caller came this morning and of course I have a bit of a<br />
soft spot I'm sure you have for POW's. The caller said<br />
that now that the Government's been so generous to the<br />
airlines, might they consider giving the ex-POW's the three<br />
shillings a day sustenance allowance promised them by<br />
successive governments since the end of the war. Do you<br />
think that people out there feel as though that the dice are<br />
falling equally on those who are in need?<br />
PM: Well I think it's true that people will never and<br />
think that those in need have ever been given enough. All I<br />
can say is that in the last Budget we made additional<br />
arrangements for those in need generally, including people<br />
in the veterans area and the veterans organisations have<br />
been good enough to acknowledge that to us, they have said<br />
that they appreciate what we've done, including in the<br />
prisoner of war area, we've done as much as we think in this<br />
curcumstance you can do but we'll continue to examine<br />
specific proposals that are put up to us by representatives.<br />
JONES: Do you often wonder what star you were born under?<br />
Here you are with a world record, an Australian record<br />
current account, record interest rates, record levels of<br />
inflation and here the polls are saying that you can still<br />
or relative to I mean when Gough Whitlam was running<br />
inflation at 15%, the OECD average was about 11. The OECD<br />
is now about 3 1/ 2 isn't it, 4<br />
PM: 8. </p>
<p>JONES: And you're running at 7.<br />
PM: Now you always like to be<br />
JONES: Absolutely.<br />
PM: You like to put the complete picture.<br />
JONES: I'm offering you a compliment there. I'm just<br />
saying that you still look like winning an election<br />
PM: I could feel that coming so I wasn't going to cut you<br />
off completely. I also wanted you to say complete the<br />
record and I have this record. A rate of employment growth<br />
more than twice as fast as the rest of the world, 5 times<br />
faster than under the Fraser/ Howard/ Peacock government. So<br />
we've got world record growth in that sense and in regard to<br />
environmental matters, the World Heritage bureau is saying<br />
that no government in the world has done more to advance<br />
world heritage values than has this Government. So we've<br />
got the record on employment creation and on environmental<br />
issues. JONES: Good to talk to you, Prime Minister. Time's beaten<br />
us, I'm sorry but thank you for your time, as always.<br />
PM: Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be with you.<br />
