FOR MEDIA21 April 1986<br />
I have today sent the following message to Mr and Mrs Arthur<br />
Taylor parents of Constable Angela Taylor:<br />
On behalf of the Government and people of Australia,<br />
Hazel and I offer you our deepest sympathy on the loss<br />
of your daughter Angela. We all have an abhorrence of<br />
the senseless outrage which has led to your deep<br />
personal tragedy.<br />
Our thoughts are with you and your family.<br />
