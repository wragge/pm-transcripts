AUSTXALIA L<br />

MEDIA 2 AUGUST 1979<br />
ADDRESS AT OPENING SESSION OF CHOGM<br />
This is an historic occasion. It is the first time that a<br />
regular Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting has been held<br />
in Africa. You, Mr. President, have been firm in your resolve<br />
that, whatever the difficulties, this conference should be<br />
held in Zambia a member country which occup es a front line<br />
position in South African affairs, which has suffered greatly<br />
because of the problems of the region, and which has much<br />
to contribute to the resolution of those problems.<br />
Mr. President, I believe you to be right in your conviction<br />
that the logic of the Commonwealth's history and character<br />
required that this conference be held in Southern Africa.<br />
The Commonwealth as it is represented here is the product of<br />
a movement which has swept the world over the last thirty<br />
years, converting colonies into independent countries and<br />
establishing political equality between peoples, irrespective<br />
of race and colour. Mr. President, in terms of that major<br />
transformation in global affairs, there is still unfinished<br />
business to be attended to in Southern Africa and time is<br />
running out. As the process began in the Commonwealth,<br />
as the Co. mmonwealth has both contributed to and reflected<br />
its course, it is appropriate and indeed essential that<br />
we should establish the relevance of this institution by<br />
concerning ourselves with its completion.<br />
The issues involved in Southern Africa, and in particular.<br />
in Zimbabwe, are enormously complex ones. They present<br />
different member States with different problems, both domestic<br />
and international. But I believe that as we deliberate in<br />
this conference we should keep three things firmly in mind.<br />
First, it is vital that we recognise and build on the<br />
substantial areas of agreement which exist among us on this<br />
issue, that we not be dominated by negative aspects. No<br />
one at the meeting beli,. ves that a settlement is compatible<br />
with a constitution l situation in Salisbury, which is tainted<br />
in any way with racialism. We are all in favour of majority<br />
rule true majority rule which takes account of all<br />
the parties concerned and which is reflected<br />
not only in elections but in the underlying structure of<br />
power and authority.<br />
No one wants a solution through slaughter and bloodshed,<br />
both because it will produce untold suffering to innocent<br />
people and because it will breed new hatreds. Everyone wants<br />
to see outside interference in the region diminish, not grow.<br />
No one wants to see the Comm-onwealth damaged. It is imperative<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
that as we enter the thickets of technicalities and controversies,<br />
we do not allow them to obscure these basic points.<br />
Formidable as the differences on some issues are, I believe<br />
that, as far as those of us present at this meeting are<br />
concerned, they are differences about means and timing, not<br />
about ends. We must not allow means to dominate ends.<br />
Mr. President, I would like to elaborate briefly on one of<br />
these elements of agreement. The essential cause of the grave<br />
situation in Southern Africa is racialism, the belief that one<br />
race is superior to another andtherefore enjoys a natural right<br />
to dominate, exploit and discriminate against others. This is a<br />
belief that all here categorically reject. All oppression is<br />
rapugnant, but there is an obscenity about oppression based on no<br />
more than the colour of a person's skin. You Mr. President, were<br />
the guiding hand behind the declaration of Commonwealth principles<br />
made by the Heads of Government Meeting in Singapore in 1971,<br />
when members recognised racial prejudice as a dangerous sickness and<br />
racial discrimination as an unmitigated evil. It is not only<br />
appropriate but imperative that at this time, in this place, we<br />
should solemnly reaffirm our adherence to that declaration.<br />
The second thing we should keep in mind is that, whatever else<br />
it has done and whatever one might think about particular aspects<br />
of it, the. recent election has created conditions for movement.<br />
But in itself, the election settles nothing let<br />
the. rbe no doubt about that. It has however, brought about a<br />
different situation.. It has created ne:' facts and disturbed<br />
a stalemate. There have been significant constitutional changes,<br />
and it clear that before agreement by a number of African<br />
States is achieved, there will have to be further changes.<br />
As to what happens next, that is not in the lap of the gods.<br />
It is, to a very large extent, in our laps. Much depends<br />
on whether we can seize, and seize with determination and vision<br />
the opportunity provided by the comparative fluidity which now<br />
exists, in order to advance towards a settlement. Time is running<br />
. out and we may not have such an opportunity again.<br />
Thirdly, Mr. President, I think it is clear that if a nonviolent<br />
solution to the problem of Zimbabwe is to be found it will<br />
involve flexibility on all sides flexibility not about the<br />
objective of a non-racialist society, but concerning the process<br />
of arriving at that objective and the individual interests of<br />
the principals. Compromise and moderation should be seen not<br />
merely in terms of establishing a bridge between different<br />
positions. They should be seen as positive values in their own<br />
right the essential values both of democratic politics and of<br />
peaceful relationships between S-tates which are simultaneously<br />
sovereign and interdependent. There is an urgent need to rally<br />
and invigorate the forces of moderation and reasonableness in<br />
international affairs. We should advocate and proclaim<br />
moderation not apologetically and out of expediency, but<br />
confidently even passionately as a matter of fundamental<br />
principle. If we do so, the bridges are likely to emerge of their<br />
own accord. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Mr. President and fellow delegates, it is our solemn duty at<br />
this meeting to contribute positively to the search for<br />
comprehensive, equitable and and peaceful solutions to the problems<br />
of this region. At the end of the day it is vital that we will<br />
have reached agreement among ourselves which will enable constructive<br />
negotiation and consultation to proceed.<br />
Mr. President, inevitably the problems of Southern Africa will<br />
occupy the central place in this conference. But there is much<br />
else that is urgent on our agenda.<br />
If a major theme of the last quarter century has been the ending<br />
of colonialism, the remainder of this century is likely to be<br />
increasingly preoccupied with economic problems. We have already<br />
demonstrated the scope for Commonwealth action on economic<br />
matters by the initiative we took on the CoTmmon Eund at the last<br />
. Jads of Government Yeeting. I believe that the Commonwealth<br />
can legitimately claim considerable credit for the fact that<br />
the Common Fund proposal represents one of the few areas in<br />
which real progress has been made since then.<br />
We must view with grave concern assessments that there is<br />
little likelihood of an improvement in the slow growth in<br />
international economic activity and international trade that has<br />
been experienced since 1973.<br />
What these assessments imply is that there has been a serious<br />
deterioration in the prospects for reducing poverty and<br />
raising living standards in developing countries.<br />
I believe that a pre-requisite to remedying this outlook must be<br />
to deal with the dual scourges of inflation and protection.<br />
These are interconnected problems whose solution lies primarily<br />
in the hands of powerful developed states. There is also an urgent<br />
need to ensure that inadequate supplies of oil do not act as a<br />
constraint on economic growth or endanger the inter-dependent<br />
economic system which has the potential to provide great mutual<br />
benefits. The issues are complex and I shall not dwell on them further<br />
now except to say that I believe the time has come for a new<br />
and bold approach to get the world economy moving at a faster<br />
rate and to ensure that all participants have equal opportunities<br />
to share in the benefits.<br />
A strong and determined effort will be needed, involving<br />
attention and consideration by world leaders. If we appeal to the<br />
concept of interdependence, we must mean what we say and all play<br />
a part according to our ability.<br />
Another issue which in one way or another touches most of us<br />
is that of refugees. Mr. President, I know that your country<br />
and many of our other African members have had to cope with this<br />
and with the attendant tragic problem of divided families,<br />
temporary arrangements which tend to become permanent, international<br />
indifference and consequent pressure on all too scarce resources.<br />
The problem is now assuming crisis proportions in our own part<br />
of the world as a result not only of the inevitable disruption<br />
resulting from conflict but of a deliberately pursued policy<br />
,/ 4 </p>
<p>AC--4-<br />
which, again, has a racialist component. We must address ourselves<br />
to it. Humanity requires us to come'to the aid of the victims<br />
of such action. Buthu. anity and realism also demand that the international<br />
community attack the problem at its source, that we mobilise<br />
pressure to end the policies of persecution and expulsion<br />
which result in mass exodus.<br />
I have touched on a number of the central issues confronting<br />
this conference. But in concluding I urge that in dealing with<br />
major global and regional problems, we take care not to neglect<br />
some of the less dramatic ones. In particular, let us bear in<br />
mind the special and often pressing problems faced by small<br />
States, remembering that there is a significant and growing number<br />
of such States among our members.<br />
mr. President, I believe, as I think you do, that this meeting<br />
will be a crucial one for the Commonwealth. Rarely, if ever,<br />
have we gathered to address problems of such magnitude and<br />
urgency. Rarely have we had the eyes of the international<br />
community so firmly on us. And rarely, have we had as great<br />
an opportunity to demonstrate the value of this institution by<br />
making a positive contribution to world order.<br />
If we rise to the occasion, if, under your leadership, we<br />
set aside sectional and short-term considerations and show the<br />
statesmanship, wisdom and resolution which the circumstances<br />
demand, we have it within our means to contribute to peace in<br />
Africa and to establish beyond doubt that the Commonwealth is<br />
going to be a key institution in the last decades of this<br />
century. If we speak to each other and with each other, instead<br />
of at each other or past each other, in a week's time we will<br />
emerge a stronger and more relevant body.<br />
mr. President, let that be our determination.<br />
