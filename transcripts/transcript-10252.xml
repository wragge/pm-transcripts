28 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES RADIO 2UE<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Alan.<br />
JONES: 12 months Sunday, how long does it seem?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
On occasions a lot longer and on occasions only yesterday. But I still find the job, and<br />
I'm sure I'll continue to find the job an immense privilege, very stimulating and<br />
something that I find a great deal of satisfaction in doing.<br />
JONES: Those who see you in operation every day in Canberra say that you are very much<br />
chairman of the board, that the Government runs from your office. Is that an accurate<br />
view? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well in a sense those two statements are contradictory. If the Government runs from<br />
your office you're not quite in the sort of hands off chairman of the board role. It's a<br />
mixture of the two. Look, I am the chairman of the board or the first amongst equals, </p>
<p>however you like to put it, but I take a very keen interest in things that are important.<br />
I try to let Ministers run their own portfolios. When problems emerge it's my<br />
responsibility to get involved and it's also my responsibility to push and be responsible<br />
for the major goals of the Government. So I guess it's a mixture. I think I've got the<br />
mixture about right.<br />
JONES: Is it fair for people to say 12 months out that it's been a year of living cautiously?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Not a year of living it's been a year of living sensibly. I don't think it's a good idea<br />
for any leader to play fast and loose with the security of the Australian people. I don't<br />
believe that leaders should run around calling for change just for the sake of change.<br />
There's been an enormous amount of change in peoples' lives over the last 20 years,<br />
social change, personal change, economic change, political change. And therefore if<br />
you want to change something you've got to be satisfied that what you're changing to<br />
is better and you've got to be satisfied that you take people with you. Now, in areas<br />
where I believe change is necessary, like industrial relations, I've pushed it harder than<br />
anybody in Australian political experience in the last 20 years. I mean, I've led the<br />
debate in this country in other positions for industrial relations changes. In other areas,<br />
as you know, like the constitution, because I'm unconvinced that we're going to be<br />
any better off I'm facilitating the debate and if the Australian people, in the fullness of<br />
time, want change it will be their decision and I will naturally, as I've always said,<br />
accept that decision. But I don't believe that change for its own sake is necessarily a<br />
good thing.<br />
JONES: All right, well having said that people are able to understand the kind of person, if they<br />
didn't already understand, that John Howard is. Just running then off that word<br />
change and your own statement that I'd like to see people comfortable and relaxed I<br />
think you made that statement by the year 2000 I'd like to see an Australian nation<br />
that feels comfortable and relaxed about their history. I'd like to see them comfortable<br />
and relaxed about the present and I'd like to see them comfortable and relaxed about<br />
the future can I ask you, are you comfortable and relaxed, for example, about the<br />
health care system?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I'm not. We'll be dealing with the final report of the Productivity Commission<br />
arising out of the changes in health insurance premiums and other matters. We'll be<br />
dealing with that very soon. There are many aspects of the health system which I'm<br />
not comfortable and relaxed about. There's too much pressure on the public hospitals.<br />
There are too few people in private health insurance. </p>
<p>JONES: Do you understand why?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the major reason there are too few people in private health insurance is that the<br />
previous government, against the advice of one of its own former health ministers,<br />
Graham Richardson, allowed the number of Australians to fall below what you might<br />
call the critical mass point of about 40%. And if tax breaks of the type we are<br />
introducing in July had been introduced five or six years ago as people like Graham<br />
Richardson wanted and Bob Carr now recognises should have occurred then we would<br />
not now have such a heavy drain on the public hospitals.<br />
JONES: But when Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister all those years ago and introduced<br />
this failure which is Medibank-Medicare, which every Prime Minister since including<br />
yourself, with respect, seems to be unprepared to touch, there were over 80% of<br />
people looking after their own health care, took out their own private health insurance<br />
and the premiums were deductible. What's wrong with that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan, the major reason why there has been that big change in relation to private<br />
health insurance is it has become less attractive for people in private health insurance.<br />
JONES: Only because you've stopped allowing people to cover their insurance as a tax<br />
deduction. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the main reason is tax. Well, when we were last in office, with respect, in 1983<br />
when we were voted out there was a tax deduction for health insurance. It was<br />
abolished by the former government...<br />
JONES: But why not reinstate it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's coming back on the 1 st of July.<br />
JONES: What, $ 450? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan, if we hadn't have had such a large deficit we could have afforded more but<br />
we can't frankly afford more. But that is better than having nothing. I mean, there's<br />
not a man or woman listening to your programme who's got private health insurance<br />
who won't welcome that rebate, that $ 450. I mean, it must help.<br />
JONES: Has anyone done any figures for you though? You see, the total health bill at the<br />
moment is about $ 39 billion. If people actually were given a tax deduction for their<br />
health costs and that gap didn't exist there would be an incentive for people to go out<br />
of the taxpayer funded public system into a private health system. Surely you'd save a<br />
massive amount out of that $ 39 billion. In other words, wouldn't the reforms fund<br />
themselves? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
People often, with respect, argue that and it sounds great on the surface but people<br />
don't always behave in that fashion. Different people react differently to incentives<br />
and the margins are often very thin and therefore the incentive is not that great. Many<br />
people feel more comfortable with dare I use that expression again more<br />
comfortable with the public system than a private one and you may find that you have<br />
an enormous tax bill which is not recouped by the switch of people out of the public<br />
system. Alan I understand there are a lot of deficiencies in the health system. It's a<br />
shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States. We are very<br />
conscious of it. I don't dismiss it. We committed ourselves to tax rebates. I believe<br />
they will help. They should have been brought in years ago and if they had have been<br />
we'd probably now have something like 40 to 45% of people in private health<br />
insurance instead of about 34 to 35%. Now, I take on board all of the very legitimate<br />
criticisms that are made about the system. We will be addressing a number of things<br />
other than tax in looking at the private health insurance system and the Government<br />
will be examining that whole area over coming weeks.<br />
JONES: All right. Can I just ask you another question about jobs? There's about one and a<br />
half million people out there unemployed. I mean I know you've been given crook<br />
advice about the budget from bureaucrats who admitted in a Senate Committee<br />
hearing on Wednesday they made 170 mistakes. That mustn't impress you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I wasn't happy, no. No I wasn't and everybody knows that. The one thing that<br />
can be said in their defence is that it's had no actual effect on the budget bottomline<br />
and this is the first time bureaucrats have ever, under any government, put together a<br />
mid-year review in such detail. But that doesn't alter the fact it was a mistake and<br />
those responsible for the area in which it occurred are well aware of how unhappy both<br />
the Treasurer and myself are with that. </p>
<p>JONES: Well you've got one and a half million people unemployed perhaps, does it astound<br />
you as it does every person listening to this programme when I tell them that last year<br />
our beer imports went up 20%, our beef imports up 17%, our wine imports up 2 1%,<br />
our milk and cream imports up 37%, our butter imports up 49%, that we can't actually<br />
compete with concentrate from Brazil? So recently a businessman wrote to me about<br />
a million Valencia orange trees to be destroyed in the MIA because we allow cheap<br />
orange juice from Brazil. What the hell is going on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan what you're saying is that if you introduced import controls you would<br />
bring about a fall in unemployment.<br />
JONES: Yes, I am saying that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
1 think the arguments for that are debateable. In some areas it is true that the pace of<br />
change and the pace of tariff reduction has caused jobs to be lost in other areas<br />
because people who previously invested in those industries that used to have tariff<br />
protection have invested in other areas, jobs have been created. I mean, we are in fact<br />
seeing jobs created, for example, now hand over fist in the tourist industry...<br />
JONES:<br />
That should be as well as, not instead of<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's just to know that if you're an investor and you've got $ 10 million and you<br />
find it more attractive to invest in a protected industry than in an unprotected industry<br />
you're going to invest in the protected industry even though the prospects for job<br />
growth ( inaudible)...<br />
JONES:<br />
Can I just ask you this. You're a parent and you've actually had to feed and clothe<br />
your kids for many years and they're all mad about the Reeboks and the Nikes and all<br />
that sort of stuff, just to take one example. Are you trying to tell me that you couldn't<br />
find an Australian manufacturer that couldn't actually put Nikes or Reeboks on the feet<br />
of your kids for the price that you have to pay when you go into the supermarket store,<br />
$ 135 or whatever? Are you trying to tell me that we couldn't actually produce that<br />
gear for that price? I don't believe that. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well what I'm trying to tell you Alan is that faced with a choice between investing in<br />
something that gives you a 10% return and something that gives you an 8% return,<br />
somebody will always put it in the 10% return. And it's not always the case that the<br />
thing that gives you the best return is the industry that employs the most people.<br />
JONES:<br />
Last time you were Treasurer...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look Alan, I'm not arguing, I'm not arguing with you that it is stupid to reduce<br />
protection without getting something in return from other countries. I mean, we have<br />
a decision to take on the motor vehicle industry for example. Now, we haven't got the<br />
final report of the Productivity Commission and I can't pre-empt what we're going to<br />
say. But I am very well aware of the employment consequences of that decision. I'm<br />
also well aware that the real growth in the motor vehicle industry in Australia lies in<br />
the export market. Because Australia is a small domestic market. The cost of<br />
manufacturing cars is quite high in any part of the world and in order to make dollars<br />
and employ people as well as selling into the domestic market, which is relatively<br />
static, you've got to be able to sell into the world market. So we've always got to<br />
have an eye to the export market if we want big investment and we want jobs in the<br />
industry. So it is not as simple for us to say look, we'll put up the barriers, we'll keep<br />
everything out...<br />
JONES: No, I'm not saying that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm glad because it is a mixture of the two. It is sensible...<br />
JONES: It is, but we're out of kilter. See, I don't know where that kind of argument comes<br />
from because I know the way Prime Ministers function, I worked for one, and they get<br />
all this rubbish put over their desk that bureaucrats write and I wish we'd just get rid of<br />
some of those bureaucrats. See, when you say that to me I then look at the figures in<br />
front of me where our manufacturing trade deficit that is, just to explain to my<br />
listeners, the aggregate of what we manufacture and export to make money and the<br />
aggregate of what we import. Take them away. When you were last Treasurer the<br />
deficit was $ 2 billion. Very tolerable. We could live with it because it was a different<br />
framework in operation there in relation to tariffs and whatever. That deficit is now<br />
billion. Now, we're not fair dinkumn are we? We've dropped the tariff barriers.<br />
We're letting all these imports in. When you do that you're actually exporting jobs. </p>
<p>Someone else overseas has got the jobs, manufacturing stuff that we're letting into the<br />
country. How can we sustain that deficit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Alan, that argument is, like all arguments in this area, it is correct up to a point, just as<br />
the argument in reply I've given you is correct up to a point. It is a question of getting<br />
the right mix. It is not a question of being a slave to ideology or responding to the<br />
latest piece of advice that comes across your desk. You've got to try and get a mix of<br />
the two. It is a fact that in some highly protected industries, despite the highest tariffs<br />
in the country, employment has fallen steadily over the last 20 years. You can't get<br />
away from the fact that people will always invest their money in the industries that will<br />
do the best and if you have industries that are very heavily protected but don't employ<br />
many people, and you will attract investment into them to the detriment of investment<br />
into other industries that might grow more quickly and employ more people. Now<br />
what I am trying to do is to get a correct balance between the two of them.<br />
JONES: You understand the concern though, don't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Alan, I do. I understand, I mean, I have been to South Australia, for example, many<br />
times and talked to people in the motor vehicle industry. I understand these things.<br />
JONES: Right. Well let's just take it a step further. On March 12 you were elected. On July<br />
the official interest rate went from 7.5% to On November 6 it went from 7 to<br />
On December I11 it went from 6.5 to Now Japan is the most successful<br />
economy in the world. They've got unemployment...<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No, I don't entirely agree with that.<br />
JONES: Well it's one of the most..<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think the United States is.<br />
JONES: Okay, well Japan, United States. Japan has an unemployment rate of about 2.5% and<br />
businesses up there pay about 2% for their money. Why when you have presided over </p>
<p>a reduction on those sorts of interest rates, down to an official rate of 6% is business<br />
the only engine that can employ these people that you want employed still paying 13,<br />
14 and<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well I think there are two reasons for that. Firstly, I don't think the banks pass on the<br />
reductions quickly enough. That's the first point I have made and that is a criticism<br />
that the Treasurer and I have repeatedly made and we will continue to make, and<br />
secondly and most importantly, the banks need more competition in the business loans<br />
area. Now you mentioned business loans. Let me compare housing loans. Housing<br />
loans have come down dramatically. You know why they've come down? They've<br />
come down because there's been more competition and that's the reason. The<br />
greatest... JONES: Why wouldn't you think of doing though what the Bank of Japan does? The Bank of<br />
Japan is directed by the Government to funnel money into manufacturing and<br />
agriculture at very significant concessional interest rates..<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well I say on that Alan that the major reasons why Japan has a very low<br />
unemployment rate is that the whole culture of that country is utterly different from<br />
what it is in Australia and no Government can turn the inherent culture of a country..<br />
JONES: No. PRIME MINISTER<br />
You have lifetime...<br />
JONES: But you're talking about..<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
You don't have the same obligations on taxpayers in Australia as they do in Japan to<br />
look after their own. In the whole, people have lifetime employment, your companies<br />
are meant to look after the retired people. Now I mean that might be a good thing but<br />
you're not going to bring about that kind of... </p>
<p>JONES: No but you were just talking before about investment and no business is going to go<br />
out and enthusiastically invest when they are being charged 15% for their money.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I agree with that and that is why we have pushed very hard to have lower interest<br />
rates. It's why we cut the deficit and because if you have a lower deficit, in time you<br />
have lower interest rates but the key to even lower interest rates for small business is<br />
of course a continuation of our policies which push rates down but also the key to it is<br />
to have more competition. Now you've seen it happen in housing, and it's the lowest<br />
housing loans since the late 1960s and that is because of Aussie Home Loans, and<br />
RAMS and all those other small groups that have really...<br />
JONES: Well listen, we've got to go to the news and I just want to give you a chance to say<br />
something. It's 12 months in. There's 12 months in front of you. It's going to be<br />
tough. What do you say to the people listening to you now about what they can<br />
expect from John Howard?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well there will be a continuation of the style of government that I tried to describe in<br />
my opening remarks. We do have challenges but we have a lot of strengths and we<br />
have a lot of opportunities. I am going to keep in touch with the Australian people. I<br />
will never take them for granted. I will always regard the job that I have as an<br />
immense privilege and the most important commitment I made I believe I have<br />
honoured and that is I have stayed true to the essential promises that I took to the<br />
people at the last election, and I promised the Australian people a continuation of an<br />
approach to Government that listens to what they have to say, understands their<br />
problems, on occasions is willing to argue very strongly and very passionately the need<br />
for change and reform but somebody who believes that on the great balance sheet of<br />
the history of this country is a very proud one, and as we look back over our history<br />
we have far more to be proud of than we have to be ashamed of and we should take a<br />
discriminatory approach towards change. We've changed the things that have failed.<br />
We keep the things that have worked.<br />
JONES: Okay, just on that subject, I didn't want to pursue this but you are aware of course that<br />
the Wik decision is, in perspective holding up about $ 9 billion worth of decision<br />
making which is also jobs. When will the nation get an answer from you on Wik?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I expect to be able to make a recommendation to the Cabinet at Easter. I have spent<br />
an enormous amount of personal time over the last few weeks since I came back from </p>
<p>my annual break talking to everybody, to the Aboriginal leaders, to the states, to the<br />
mining and farming leaders. It is very complicated. Everybody at the moment is<br />
approaching it with great goodwill to see if we can get an agreed outcome. If we can't<br />
I will recommend a course of action to the Government because this issue has to be<br />
resolved. The Wik decision did overturn one of the basic principles of what we<br />
thought represented native title.<br />
JONES: It overturned an assurance by the previous Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well it certainly did and it overturned a preamble in the Native Title Act which said<br />
that the grant of a pastoral lease extinguished native title. Now the courts made that<br />
decision. It is the prerogative of the Parliament to change the law as declared by the<br />
courts. I am trying to reach an agreed outcome which will deliver justice and certainty<br />
to everybody. I am concerned about the impact of that decision on the security of<br />
pastoral titles. I am concerned about its impact on resource development. I had a<br />
group of Aboriginal people from the Cape come to see me last week, pleading with me<br />
to change the Native Title Act. They had cut a very, very beneficial deal with the<br />
Queensland Government and the mining company which would have delivered jobs<br />
and benefits and hope to them and to their children and this deal was frustrated by a<br />
minority of who they describe, not me, they describe as malcontents and they were<br />
pleading with me to change the Native Title Act.<br />
Now that, there couldn't be a better demonstration to me as Prime Minister, they were<br />
Aboriginals, they were the Waanyi people and there were six of them. They were<br />
Aboriginal elders. They were respected leaders of their community saying the Native<br />
Title Act is a failure. One of them actually said to me, I am going to file a claim<br />
against the Native Title Act. This has let me down, it's not delivering me anything.<br />
Now that's not John Howard, it's not Tim Fischer, it's leaders of the Aboriginal<br />
community who want to make the process of reconciliation work, who want the<br />
benefits of investment in mining companies, who want the jobs that investment will<br />
generate for their children. They want it, they want a future for their children. They're<br />
not worried about nitpicking and political point scoring. They want a future for their<br />
children and they are being held up by who they describe as the malcontents and...<br />
JONES:<br />
Well just on that, I mean, you mentioned Tim Fischer. He's copped a serve today<br />
from the Chief Justice. Isn't Tim Fischer entitled to criticise a High Court judgement<br />
which puts so much in this country at risk?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Interestingly enough, that was a dispute about the timing of the judgement but<br />
interestingly enough, the Chief Justice in his letter published this morning makes that </p>
<p>very point. There is nothing wrong with criticising judgements. People frequently<br />
criticise the judgements of the courts. You know, obviously the courts have a role and<br />
an authority in our constitutional set up and I think, we have a very, very long history<br />
of great judicial integrity in this country. One of the great strengths Australia has is<br />
that we do have an incorruptible judiciary but that doesn't mean to say that we always<br />
agree with the decisions they take and the point has to be made, Alan, is that the court<br />
declares the law as it is. It is the Parliament's ongoing right to change the law if it<br />
thinks that change is in the interests of the Australian community and that is the<br />
attitude I adopt towards the High Court and it is the attitude I adopt towards the role<br />
of the Parliament.<br />
JONES: All right. Good to talk to you. Have a good Sunday.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Thanks Alan.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, John Howard.<br />
