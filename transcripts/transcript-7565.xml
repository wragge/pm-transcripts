PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HEATHER EWART, ABC AM,<br />
13 APRIL 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
EWART: Mr Hawke, your critics say this statement isn't<br />
about sound economics but about winning the next election.<br />
What do you say to that?<br />
PM: They are wrong. Just let me dispense with this concept<br />
of this being something for an early election. we promised<br />
in the middle of last year that we would be making a<br />
statement in respect of a tax/ wage trade-off to operate from<br />
the middle of 1989. All we're doing is delivering on that<br />
promise and in delivering on that promise Heather we've got<br />
one thing above all else in mind and that is to have a<br />
control of this economy which is going to enable us to<br />
sustain growth and employment and prevent a wages explosion<br />
which would destroy the economy. There is no early election<br />
in the offing, I can assure your listeners of that.<br />
EWART: Is this<br />
PM: I'm sorry, just let me make this point. There's only<br />
one person who introduced the suggestion of an early<br />
election and that was one Johnny Howard. Why? Because he<br />
knew that we were going to be producing, in terms of the<br />
promise we'd made last year to the Australian people, a<br />
package which would knock him for six. So he had to try and<br />
introduce a note of cynicism into it.<br />
EWART: So this statement isn't directed in any sense<br />
towards an early election?<br />
PM: That is correct and obviously by the time we go to the<br />
election, which will be a long time after the present, we<br />
expect that we will be rewarded for the management of the<br />
economy and that a judgement will be made Heather between<br />
our control of the economy and that of our opponents.<br />
EWART: In fact you seemed to suggest in the Parliament<br />
yesterday afternoon that an election could be a year off.<br />
You said, I think to John Howard, you'll get your chance in<br />
12 months or so, and the Finance Minister, Peter Walsh,<br />
seemed to back that up last night. That's your thinking at<br />
the moment is it, no election for 12 months? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: I can't seen an election this year. Certainly I'm not<br />
talking about an election this year. There's got to be a<br />
half Senate election by the middle of next year and I am<br />
just not in an election mode. I've tried to make that<br />
clear. I repeat, we promised this to the Australian people<br />
last year. I said to them and Paul Keating echoed<br />
properly what I had to say we said, if you get a<br />
responsible wages outcome during 1988-89 and we can see that<br />
we can get a responsible wages outcome for 1989-90 then we<br />
will announce in time to take effect from July ' 89, tax<br />
cuts. All we are doing is delivering on that promise I made<br />
to the Australian people.<br />
EWART: So can we just pin that down? No election this<br />
year? PM: I don't think there will be an election this year.<br />
That's right.<br />
EWART: Even with all the early speculation which you say<br />
the Opposition has been reviving, and it certainly has some<br />
troubles of its own<br />
PM: Does it ever.<br />
EWART: It's not tempting in any sense?<br />
PM: No, it's not tempting. What's happening and I'm glad<br />
you introduced the subject but what is well known in<br />
Canberra amongst all who are following politics, we know<br />
that there is a concentrated push on by Mr Peacock and his<br />
supporters, aided and abetted by the President of the party<br />
John Elliott, to dump John Howard. That's not surprising<br />
because our fortunes are somewhat lower because of high<br />
interest rates and I understand that. The vote hasn't gone<br />
to the Libs, it's gone to Democrats and others. They have<br />
made their decision that Howard has to go. That's where the<br />
problems are.<br />
EWART: If that were true, you wouldn't be tempted to go for<br />
an early election?<br />
PM: No, not at all. If the Liberal Party proves the<br />
paucity of its resources by having to resort to the failed<br />
Andrew Peacock, I'll be more than happy to see Andrew there<br />
in the position for a considerable period of time because<br />
the longer he's there you'll have more solidly revealed the<br />
truth of history. That is, he was not adequate before, he's<br />
not adequate now.<br />
EWART: So a scenario like that, if it were to be true,<br />
wouldn't alter your thinking that there'd be no election<br />
this year?<br />
PM: No. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
EWART: Getting back to the statement then, is it more about<br />
sound politics? You and Paul Keating have suggested the<br />
workers and the needy deserve these measures, but did you<br />
fear that you'd asked them perhaps to bear too much economic<br />
restraint, that you were in fact driving away traditional<br />
supporters who just couldn't cop any more?<br />
PM: It's not a question of driving away traditional<br />
supporters. It is the case that we lost some support in our<br />
heartland, I don't deny that, but the situation was that in<br />
the period from 1983 we have had to ask Australians, your<br />
ordinary average listener, we've had to ask them to exercise<br />
restraint. They've been magnificent in doing that and<br />
together we've reaped the benefits. And the benefit, the<br />
outstanding benefit is what we've done in regard to<br />
employment. I can't repeat this too often, and I know that<br />
your listeners are proud of it, as I am, that we've created<br />
together, that is the Government and the people, we've<br />
created 1.3 million new jobs. The relevant statistic about<br />
that is that's four times as fast as under Fraser and<br />
Howard, twice as fast as the rest of the world. Now we've<br />
been able to do that because the people have co-operated,<br />
the trade union movement has co-operated, there've been<br />
reductions in real wages which we've compensated by extra<br />
jobs. It's meant that real household disposable income has<br />
risen while we're in there, but that's happened not because<br />
wages have increased in real terms but because there've been<br />
more people in the households in work and because we've<br />
substantially increased benefits to those most in need. But<br />
the time comes when having a strong economy the economy in<br />
this last year has been growing at over 4% and the employers<br />
of this country are knocking down the door of the ACTU<br />
Heather saying we wan't to give massive wage increases. The<br />
ACTU was saying no, we want to keep the lid on wages. Now<br />
you can't just keep doing that forever and saying no wage<br />
increases. So the trick, the secret, what you have to do is<br />
to accommodate that move for increased wages in a way which<br />
is economically sustainable. So what have we done? We've<br />
given people on average as a result of this package a 12%<br />
wage equivalent increase at a cost to employers of only<br />
Now that means that people are getting the increase<br />
in disposable income which is going to enable them to<br />
improve their standards, but not in a way which is going to<br />
put undue pressure on inflation. In fact, inflation will<br />
track down.<br />
EWART: Well, on that point, Mr Keating has had a lot to say<br />
about tax and wages. He has had less to say about interest<br />
rates and inflation. Do you think the money markets aren't<br />
going to be too pleased about that, and new home buyers?<br />
PM: Let me take the two parts of that question Heather. As<br />
far as what the market reaction is I'm not quite sure. All<br />
I can say is I'm told that the initial reaction was that the<br />
dollar went up a bit so one would tend to think that that's<br />
not an adverse reaction by the market. Now, as far as<br />
interest rates are concerned, let me say quite clearly as I<br />
said in the Parliament, Bob Hawke, like any sensible </p>
<p>PM ( cont): politician, is not going to have interest rates<br />
one percentage point or a fraction of a percentage point<br />
higher for one day longer than is necessary. I mean, I'm<br />
not an idiot. I know that people don't like high interest<br />
rates. But I think people have enough trust in me to say<br />
Hawke and the Government are running a tight monetary policy<br />
now with high interest rates because it's necessary. What<br />
we've got to do is reduce somewhat the level of activity so<br />
that we don't suck in an unsustainably high level of<br />
imports. As soon as the level of activity comes down<br />
somewhat, while still consistent with growth and employment<br />
growth, then monetary policy will be eased. But it would be<br />
a dereliction of duty on my part if I pulled interest rates<br />
down now just like that because people are saying it's<br />
hurting. EWART: Well finally, you say no election this year. So do<br />
you have a date in mind, early next year?<br />
PM: No, I don't have a particular date in mind. But let's<br />
remember this, that the last election was held in July of<br />
1987 which would mean that the judgement, I think, of all<br />
commentators would be that any time, you know, from the<br />
relatively early part of 1990 would be appropriate. What I<br />
want to get across to you is that I am not in an election<br />
mode. I haven't made these decisions with my colleagues on<br />
the basis of an early election. That's not part of it, it<br />
is the delivery of a promise I made to the people of<br />
Australia last year. The election will be held at a time<br />
which will be regarded by all objective commentators as at a<br />
reasonable time. I'm not, in saying that, doing anything<br />
more than any other Prime Minister has said in the whole of<br />
the post-war period. It has been accepted that there is<br />
some degree of latitude in timing but it will not be an<br />
election which will be regarded as an early election.<br />
EWART: Mr Hawke, thank you very much.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Heather.<br />
