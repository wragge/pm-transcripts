J: Mr Keating, the Newspoll today shows that the Labor Party Is closing the<br />
gap. Are you confident that you can pick up saeats like Calare, or hold on<br />
to seats like Cala re?<br />
PM; I think so, We think the feeling In Celare Is pretty good. That people,<br />
I think, are now starting to focus on the election campaign Issues. They<br />
have had a look at the policy speeches, they have had a look at the<br />
leaders, they have seen the debate between John Howard and me, and<br />
they are starting now to make their minds up. And, I think, as they make<br />
their minds up, we are starting to see a shift of opinion.<br />
J Mr Keating, what do you know about the privatisation of the Information<br />
Technology Group within Teistra?<br />
PMV: I don't know much about it at all. But I got a question earlier today about<br />
whether some of these things amount to the de facto privatIsation of<br />
Telstra and, of course, they don't. That Is the same proposition that has<br />
been put to me about Foxtel. I mean Teistra is a telephone company, a<br />
communications company. It is not a news producer, it is not a movie<br />
producer, Atis not an entertainment business, It has to do these things<br />
coflaboratively and this Is the way, I think, the business will grow.<br />
It is one of the reasons why phone companies are now buying Into<br />
entertainment companies and why, for instance, MCA has bought into<br />
British Telecom, which has bought into News Corporation, for the same<br />
reasons that entertnment, news and oommunications are all much part of<br />
the one business now.<br />
J: But is it tnue that you asked for the privatisation of that particular unit to be<br />
put off until after the election? </p>

PM: I don't know anything about it.<br />
J: You didn't speak to the unions about it?<br />
PM: I have not spoken to anyone about ft.<br />
J: You have never heard about that at all?<br />
PM: I have never heard about it.<br />
J: The Coalition Is accusing the Government of politicising the Finance<br />
Department for costing their promises?<br />
PM: Well that is just outrageous. John Howard, In fact, asked us, challenged<br />
Ralph Willis and Kim Beaziey to actually have his policies costed in the<br />
course of this Parliament and when we do it he then cries foul upon his<br />
own invitatlon. And, at any rate, this ought to be a matter of factual<br />
information. What has he got to fear about having the Departments that<br />
he says he wants to operate having them cost his promises? When,<br />
In fact, all Governments have done this right through the period, including<br />
his own back in the 0980s.<br />
J: Can you give the Australian people a guarantee, when the election Is<br />
finished and the books are opened, that the Budget will be in surplus?<br />
PM: Well I have answered that question 20 times.<br />
J: But can you give them a pledge?<br />
PM: I have answered it 20 times. I mean we have put more data out there than<br />
anyone In Australian Federal history. But the key point is that either party<br />
will have to face the starting point. It is a matter of whether we are adding<br />
to the Budget task or subtracting from it.<br />
Labor Is subtracting from the Budget task because we have introduced<br />
measures which have, of course, already been costed by our<br />
Departments, which show that there will be a very big net contribution to<br />
the Budget.<br />
John Howard will have a very big net deficiency and yesterday, when<br />
Ralph Willis and I articulated some commentary on Mr Howard's promises,<br />
what they showed Is that there was a $ 5.8 billion deficiency so far, without<br />
at this point dealing with some of their other things such as Incentives for<br />
savings which we have not yet seen. </p>

P. 2<br />
J: Mr Keating, Mr Howard says he will only have a deficiency if your Budget<br />
surplus doesn't emerge?<br />
PM: Well he knows he is facing like, for Instance, he never even costed his<br />
commitment to give the States a fixed share of income tax, which will cost<br />
about $ 3 billion over three years. That was not even in his coatings.<br />
I mean the Liberals have learned nothing and they have forgotten nothing.<br />
This is just Box Hill 1987 all over again. They think to win an election they<br />
have to win it on the basis of some sort of bribe, rather than on their own<br />
Intrinsic merits or their philosophy and these sorts of bribes are expensive.<br />
And what they would do is derail a Budget process, they would derail a<br />
Budget's figuring.<br />
J: But the Opposition says that they are not going to give the States any<br />
more money, that that is not going to cost anything.<br />
PM: Well why make the promise? What does the promise mean? What does<br />
It mean? If it is not going to cost anything, what does it mean? Of course<br />
It Is going to cost something.<br />
J: Does New South Wales need a third international airport at Parkes?<br />
UPM: We are not talking about a third international airport. I think what is being<br />
viewed here is whether, in time sensitive cargoes, perishable goods, there<br />
Is the capacity to have some substantial, you know using the standard<br />
vehicles for freight, which are basically 747 freighters. An international<br />
airport is a horse of another colour that Is all of the facilities that go with<br />
It. But we are prepared here to look and see whether there is a viable<br />
option of essentially covering the cost of the extension of a strip and some<br />
of the ancillary support facilities you would need for freight and whether<br />
that can be paid for by the generation of the business.<br />
J: coatings [ inaudible]?<br />
PM: There are airports built, I think, In this region. Some of the extensions<br />
have been put down to around $ 20 million In some of the preliminary work<br />
that has been done.<br />
J: Have you broached this with the airlines as to whether they are happy to<br />
move their freight operations to areas like Parkes?<br />
PM: They wouldn't necessarily be airlines either, I mean, I think, you see quite<br />
a lot of charter operations as well as airlines. But if they could get some<br />
business, obviously, they would come here, getting caught in the<br />
congestion In Sydney Is not really, I think, in their best interests. </p>

J, On Sunday, will there be a debate?<br />
PM: Of course there will.<br />
J: Where?<br />
PM: I As we agreed last Sunday week. That was Channel Nine In Sydney next<br />
Sunday night.<br />
J: The same fiormat?<br />
PMV: The same format.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Mr Button said today that whoever wins Government on<br />
March 2nd, is going to have to dishonour some of their election promises<br />
that they can't afford,<br />
PM. No, that is not true of our case. We have got, as I said our spending<br />
commitments are hall the Coslition's and they are funded tWice over and it<br />
is not our claims. 1 mean all of our funding, of course, all of those figures<br />
that we have produced, are produced with Departments they are<br />
Departmental figures. So our commitments are modest compared to the<br />
Opposition's and they are funded twice over. But it Is a very real problemn<br />
for John Howard. I mean the Liberals have made their classic mistake<br />
they think they have got to buy peoples' votes, they have picked the mood<br />
wrong, they now have a set of grab beg promises they can't fund.<br />
J: So why would Mr Button be making that sort of comment?<br />
PMV; John has always been noted for his philosophical approach to public life.<br />
J* On super what is wrong with older workers taking monley [ inaudible)<br />
PM: Lower income workers? I think there is a lot wrong with it. It is,<br />
essentially, playing themn off a break. It Is saying that they can choose to<br />
lose their retirement benefit some choice taking them out of a scheme<br />
that has universality, it busts the principle of universality, it busts the<br />
principle of compulsion and, of course, At removes the obligation of a<br />
Howard Government to pay the tax cuts to match their contributions. All in<br />
all it is a very miserable view and one that, I think, In the senior echelons<br />
of Australian business, would be a very worrying one. And. I think, In the<br />
financial institutions and for anyone who is Interested in seeing a pool of<br />
savings In this country and a set of retirement savings8, to watch the<br />
Coalition willfully dismembering and dismantling a universal<br />
superannuation systemn is, I think, a very silly thing to be doing, </p>

J: Mr Howard appears to have backed away from' his promise of an<br />
underlying surplus in 1996/ 97. Do you still think you can get an underlying<br />
surplus In 1998/ 971<br />
PMV: Well I got asked that question earlier. Mr Howard Is backing away<br />
because he has made oommitments he can't keep. So he " et given a<br />
choice, doesn't he either keep the commitments or back away from the<br />
underlying surplus. So ho has backed away from the underlying surplue<br />
and, I think, economic journalists and those who write about these things<br />
should take note this is the choice he has made.<br />
JSo, yes, you can get an underlyng surplus in 1996/ 97?<br />
PM: I have made It clear before. We have published three years forward<br />
estimates of outlays and receipts, and three years forward estimates of the<br />
Budget balance In surplus.<br />
J: Mr Howard has released his youth policy today and he has taken a<br />
substantial amount of money out of traineeships and put it towardis<br />
apprenticeships saying that that is the only way to create real jobs.<br />
PM: Oh, what would he know. Really, what would he know. I mean when he<br />
left office only three young people In ton completed secondary school<br />
three In ten. Seven In ten were not even there left to complete years I11<br />
and 12. That is John Howard's regard for our young Australians,<br />
We have now got nearly eight in ten, we have just about doubled tertiary<br />
places, and we have already put, now since One Nation S1t6 billion Into<br />
ANTA, Into TAFE, for vocational education. And we have developed a<br />
system of tralneeships for people and you can see those traineeships<br />
today with Mc~ onald,% in Orange, and with Email in Orange. That is the<br />
sort of support. We regard 15 to 19 years of age Is a period of vocational<br />
preparatin and we don't want young people dropping out of school.<br />
If we do, we try and get them back Into school or back into structured<br />
training and a subsidised job place.<br />
So, you know, we have got that comprehension and we have got that very<br />
large commitment. And I might remind people, again, that when we<br />
introduced Working Nation a $ 1.5 blillion program Mr Howard's<br />
predecessor In office, the man who would be his Foreign Minister,<br />
Mr Downer, said it was a waste of money.<br />
J: But that is not real jobs, that is training, that Is not employing people? </p>

a<br />
PRM: No, they are real jobs. Those jobs are one year jobs. it is one year<br />
tratneeship for people...<br />
J: But an apprenticeship Is a real job too, Isn't it?,<br />
PM: Oh, there are apprenticeshipo too. But we have apprenticeships and we<br />
have traineeships.<br />
J: He has offered $ 18 million for youth suicide. What are you offering except<br />
more of the same,<br />
PM: What, more of the same of what?<br />
J: In that area, you haven't exactly been a success.<br />
PM. Well you are a gloomy person, you are. I mean, what, did you take a<br />
gloom tablet this morning?<br />
J: Well Australia does have one of the highest rates of youth sulcide In the<br />
world.<br />
PM: Look, what we are offering Is young Australians a place In the scheme of<br />
arrangements of this country a full place In education, a big Investment<br />
by the nation, a big investment in their secondary education, a big<br />
investment in tertiary education, a big Investment in vocational education,<br />
and support for them In such areas as traineeships, apprenticeship's and<br />
structured training, where they actually walk away with an accreditation.<br />
In other words, we are trying to give young people not just hope, but<br />
prospects and also for those who, for some reason, drop right out of the<br />
system In terms of homelessness, we have got a large package of<br />
funding to support them; and in terms of counselling, we have with the<br />
States a program to deal with some of these problems of moral@ which do<br />
lead to these environments.<br />
J: Are you doing anything specifically to address though the teenage suicide<br />
rate?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, we have..<br />
J: $ 18 million Is quite a lot of money to address to a specific issue?<br />
PM: But this is notsa static picture. We have got programs already out there<br />
and we are already doing those things. The truth is the Liberal Party has<br />
never Invested in our young people never. T Ihey didn't invest In them<br />
when they were in office and what was their attitude at the last eleiOn </p>

put them on $ 3 an hour wages $ 3 an hour, Now, In Western Australia, It<br />
Is $ 3.77. They have taken the laat three years inflation and topped it up to<br />
$ 3.77, 1 mean that Is where they stand.<br />
J: You said in your campaign launch that there would be an unprecedented<br />
effort on Aboriginal health were you to be re-elected. What would that<br />
involve?<br />
PM: Well we have already made very large commitments, we are transferring<br />
funds from ATSIC to the Commonwealth Department of Health and the<br />
Commonwealth Department of Health wil be settig up and managing<br />
direct health programs In Aboriginal communities across the country. We<br />
will be winding that program up over the course of the next three years.<br />
But we will also be looking to tialking with the States about environmental<br />
health In such things as water, sewerage, housing, etc, because this Is not<br />
just a problem of the Incidence of disease. But, rather, as well, is that the<br />
environment in which all of this Is created with over-crowding in housing,<br />
poor sanitation, and that requires a commitment with the States.<br />
This cannot be dome without the States being Involved and that is why<br />
I said the other day at the regional agreement signed in Cape, York in<br />
respect of land that has the prospect of going to a full regional agreement<br />
under ATSIC, which would then have commitments by the State of<br />
Queensland In that case for say roads, housing, sewerage, etc.<br />
