NOTES ITALIAN CLUB s S:<br />
1. Delighted to be here at the Italian Australian Club in<br />
Launceston one of the only Italian Clubs in Australia that.<br />
I haven't visited before.<br />
Only two weeks aco I was at the Apia Club in Sydney<br />
where I always feel at home with President Jim Bayutti, a great<br />
Italian Australian who has done so much for his new country by<br />
continuing to care for his homeland. I mention in passing that<br />
he is on the board of Qantas and is the head of the new ethnic<br />
radio station in Sydney, which is serving the multi-linual<br />
as well as multi-cultural needs of our migrant communities. He<br />
holds these positions. because of his ability and because he<br />
represents the contribution being made by the 25 per cent of<br />
our Australian population who were born in another country<br />
2. But of course here in Tasmania, there is the remarkable<br />
contribution d-? e by Claude Alcorso not only a most successful<br />
textile entrep-zer r, but also a patron of the arts and of<br />
education n : be hoard of the Australian Opera, and last<br />
year appointed to -he Universities Commission.<br />
3. Then there's Sergio Guidicci from Tasmania who ten years<br />
ago was the first migrant from this State and quite possibly<br />
the first from the whole of Australia to win the celebrated<br />
Rhodes Scholarship which had always been regarded as a fairly<br />
Anglo Saxon institution.<br />
4. But your know as well as I that these figureheads are only<br />
the tip of the iceberg that there are Italian Australians,<br />
Australian Italians throughout Australia who have done wonders<br />
for this country, for this State, people who have made excellent<br />
citizens, people who have brought up families in the best blend / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
of Old tradi-bions and loyalties with. new challen,-es and<br />
opportunities.* My Grovernment understands your asipirations fandI applauds<br />
your initiatives. Clubs like -this ane are living examples<br />
of the interdependence of our cultures. ' Whether they are called<br />
Italian Australian or Australian Itlian no longer matters,<br />
although I realise that ther was a time -and not so many<br />
years ag-o w1-en it was considteredl more respectable, safer by<br />
far -to includle Australian somewhere in the title.'. I would 1 lke<br />
to think that vhere it does now appear in relation to ethnic<br />
cl. ubs it is out of a feeling of affection and not of fear.<br />
6. For my part, I feel a great love of Italy, her culture and<br />
her people. Thctl is shared by my wife lNargaret who is in<br />
Mexico at presen-t, in the Auqstralian delegation to a United<br />
Nations Confergenc e on vomen for International W-omen's Year.<br />
Also in is an Italian Australian women from<br />
Melboure, ? zos vlho is on the National Advisory Committee<br />
for Internation_, * 7ozen's Year in Australia. I know my wife<br />
will feel more ' zna tinoe of re(~ ret at missingt out on my visit<br />
here. Cathy * auahter will be able to tell her all about it<br />
on her return. You kno%!, its always struck me that politicians wiv es<br />
and daughters are quite properly choosey about what activities<br />
they will get involved in, and I don't blame them. Bunt there's<br />
never a. n excuse produced when I mention there's a visit to an<br />
Italian Club coming up. 1/ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
7. Talking of excuses, I am reminded of criticism of my visit<br />
to Europe last January. You will recall Liberal and Country<br />
Party criticism of the fact that the Prime Minister of Australia<br />
actually dared to take any time to visit those countries in<br />
Europe that have given us more than a quarter of our entire<br />
population. When I went to Italy for a very brief period,<br />
unfortunately it was the first visit by an Australian Prime<br />
Minister for over 15 years; 15 years during which thousands of<br />
Italians had chosen to take the ' great gamble on building a new<br />
life for themselves in a new Terra Australis. How wrong it<br />
would have been, had I not visited your homeland to gain some<br />
further insight into your birthplace. How wrong I would have<br />
been to let such ill-considered, even prejudiced criticism,<br />
cloud my judgment in that issue.<br />
8. Of course it is proper, of course it is desirable, of course<br />
it matters that the Prime Minister of this country should visit<br />
those European =-untries who have given us so much for so long<br />
their sons aan Their daughters, their labours and fortunately,<br />
their loves.<br />
9. And that brings me to the fact that my Government the<br />
Australian Labor Government cares about what happens to<br />
migrants when they come here, and doesn't just see people like<br />
yourselves as another proposition in the workforce.<br />
Ve realise the communications problems experienced by<br />
newcomers; we recognise how lonely many migrant women feel;<br />
we are aware that many migrants have been exploited because<br />
of language problems in their work situations. We know that<br />
while many migrant children are rightly described as " excellent<br />
achievers", and are highly motivated to do well as school, / 4 </p>
<p>because they ar so encouraged by their parents, others are<br />
not so fortunate, and do iieed special attention.<br />
11 This is one of the thnsI have been talking about<br />
to John Macrostie about while I have been down he71e You kniow<br />
he's a teacher himself, and by all accounts a vezy skiilled,<br />
and imaginativ,; e one. He, li'ke Lance Barnard before him, wouldI<br />
be able to help you with any difficulties your children mignht<br />
experience Zat school. He has worked as a fitter and turner too,<br />
and know,, s what its like to work in a factory, and as a skilled<br />
tradesman he woulId listen -to any problems or idleas you had about<br />
how to imporove -working situations for migrant men and women.<br />
He has already . zai&amp; l that he will listen to and. represent the<br />
9r~~ S o ee: 777one in this electorate as L.-ance Barnard. ( lid<br />
before him. I you all to vote f" or him on " InAurday. </p>
