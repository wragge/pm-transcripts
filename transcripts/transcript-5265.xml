ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Last week in Federal Parliament, by an overwhelming vote,<br />
the House of Representatives condemned the invasion of<br />
Afghanistan by the Soviet Union as a gross violation of the<br />
United Nations charter; as an act of aggression and tyranny,<br />
creating potentially the greatest threat to international peace<br />
-and security since 1945.<br />
It noted that a significant majority of world opinion,<br />
including the Islamic nations, has viewed the invasion with<br />
grave concern and called for the immurediate withdrawal of<br />
Soviet troops from Afghanistan.<br />
More importantly, it resolved that all independently-minded<br />
nations'should take action to register with the Government and<br />
people of the Soviet Union the international abhorrence of<br />
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.<br />
These views of the Australian Parliament reflect the unyielding<br />
belief around the world that action must be taken against the<br />
Soviets to show them that a price must be paid for blatant abuse<br />
of accepted standards of international behaviour.<br />
Australia, like many other nations, has given urgent attention<br />
to measures against the Soviet Union. It is vital that the<br />
Soviet Union should understand clearly the choices that it faces.<br />
There is a need for a clear and unambiguous message that the<br />
free world will not tolerate their behaviour. Paramount<br />
consideration must be given to actions, taken by independentlyminded<br />
countries, which will have the greatest impact on the<br />
Soviet Union.<br />
Following discussions with leaders of the United States, Europe,<br />
and Asia, the Government saw no point in incurring punitive costs<br />
to Australia by action that would have little or no impact<br />
on the Soviet Union.<br />
Our trade policy with the Soviet Union is consistent with that<br />
of the United States and other friendly Western coun ' tries. In<br />
particular, we have agreed not to pick up the shortfall in Soviet<br />
imports of grain brought about by the United States suspension<br />
of additional grain sales. But consistent with the attitude<br />
of major international exporters we have decided that trade<br />
sanctions should only be pursued if they are capable of having a<br />
substantial effect on the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>-2<br />
That-is particularly true of mineral exports. Not only is<br />
the Soviet Union relatively self-sufficient in mineral supplies,<br />
but they also have other sources of supply quite apart from<br />
Australia. It is not possible to have any impact on the<br />
Soviet Union in this area.<br />
The same is true of wool. The Soviet Union is one of the world's<br />
biggest producersof wool and has large stockpiles. Australia<br />
supplies no more than 2 per cent of the Soviet Union's total<br />
fibre requirement. So here again is another area where we are not<br />
capable of taking a stand against the Soviet Union which would<br />
force them to recognise the cost that they must bear for their<br />
unacceptable and aggressive behaviour.<br />
It is now accepted, not only by the Australian Government but<br />
by an increasing number of Governments throughout the world, that<br />
a boycott of the Olympic Gamnes, more than any other sanction,<br />
would bring home to the Soviet Union an understanding of the<br />
international condemnation of what it has done in Afghanistan.<br />
This is not a step to be taken lightly or happily by any<br />
Government, least of all by a country like Australia which has<br />
had a distinguished record in the Olympic Games since their<br />
inception in 1896. I am very much aware of the sacrifices it<br />
would mean for young Australians.<br />
Strong feelings held by my Government about our participation<br />
at the Olympic Games in no way diminish our regard for the<br />
contribution made by Australian athletes to our national<br />
reputation and our international standing. And because these<br />
are highly regarded by all Australians, I have already indicated<br />
that my Government will do all it can to promote and support the<br />
organisation of alternative international sports competitions.<br />
I would hope that at these, opportunity would be given to all<br />
Australian athletes to test their skills and seek international<br />
recognition for their efforts. But we believe t-hat it is wrong<br />
that a country engaged in the invasion, occupation and suppression.<br />
of a people should be regarded as fit to host the Olympic Games.<br />
We believe the Soviet Union's behaviour is clearly in breach of<br />
the Olympic ideals; clearly in defiance of accepted-international<br />
standards by which we all must seek to live if we are to respect<br />
freedom and seek peace. The claim by some that depriving Moscow<br />
of the Games would be letting politics interfere with sport<br />
is foolish and empty.<br />
In the Soviet Union every aspect of life, public and private,<br />
is subordinated to the demands of politics. And in no field<br />
of Soviet life is this principle being applied more intensely or<br />
more comprehensively than in the mounting of the Olympic Games.<br />
An official communist party document circulated last year in the<br />
Soviet Union claims that the holding of the Games in Moscow is<br />
convincing proof of the universal recognition of the historical<br />
importance and correctness of the course of our country's<br />
foreign policy". It goes on to say, and-I quote:' " More than ever<br />
before the Olympic Games have turned into an event of great<br />
social and political signficance." </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The Soviets themselves have spelled out the way in which they<br />
would seek to use sport for their political purposes. Whatever<br />
the intention of the world's athletes, their presence in<br />
Moscow would be used politically by the Soviet Government.<br />
They would be photographed and filmed on television and<br />
discussed on Russian radio as paying homage to the Soviet Union.<br />
I have said before that the Soviet Union and its foreign policy<br />
must not be allowed such a triumph.<br />
The world cannot afford to accept this only months after the<br />
Soviet Union has invaded a small non-aligned country and,<br />
murdered thousands of its people. Indeed, a boycott of the<br />
Games is the only sanction whose effects could not be hidden<br />
from the Russian people.<br />
The Russian people have been told for years now that the<br />
awarding of the Games to Moscow not only represents international<br />
acceptance of the Soviet way of life, but also that it will bring<br />
to Moscow thousands of athletes and tourists from the West to<br />
pay homage to the Soviet Union. That is the way the Soviet<br />
leadership operates. It tells the Russian people only what it<br />
wants them to know.<br />
But a boycott of the Olympic Games and its effects an<br />
Olympic village half empty; an Olympic programme of. events decimated by~<br />
absences; thousands of tourists absent; national flags missing<br />
from the main arena; an opening ceremony and march-past, featuring<br />
few nations, the visual opposite of what the Russian people have<br />
been told to expect all these cannot be hidden from the<br />
Russian people. This is the kind of collective action independent<br />
nations of the world must take to prevent other Afghanistans.<br />
The Australian Government's response to the Soviet invasion has<br />
been measured and realistic. The Government has an uequivocal<br />
obligation to protect the security and well-being of this and<br />
future generations of Australians. -Along with other nations<br />
in the world, we have a clear responsibility to undertake a<br />
greater effort, a greater response even if it does mean a<br />
greater cost, as it will to preserve the independence and<br />
freedom of our people. We have met that challenge and we will meet<br />
any new challenge that might arise. 000---</p>
