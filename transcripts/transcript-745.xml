CIVIC RECEPTION$ CASINO, N. S. W.<br />
MAYf 1963<br />
S'Peech by the Prime Ministers the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert-Menzies<br />
Mr. Mayor Parliamentary Colleagues Mr. President and<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen and Boys and Girls<br />
I don't mind starting by telling you that this<br />
is the biggest Civic Reception I ever had in my life, ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) It is not peculiar simply for that reason because<br />
when I looked at my programme this morning, I found " Civic<br />
Reception. Four gentlemen would speak and the Prime Minister<br />
wil~ l make a brief reply." ( Laughter) Although I have had a<br />
long experience, I was silly enough to believe it ( Laughter)<br />
until I was put on warning, as you have just heard, by the<br />
previous speakers, In fact I might tell you that at all sorts of<br />
civic receptions I am an old hand. You have heard a reference<br />
to my longevity in my present office. I don't like hearing<br />
these references to how long I've been Prime Minister benause<br />
I remember vividly that eighteen years ago I was walking along<br />
a street in Perth and a few bright boys were trundling along<br />
in a car and they saw me walking along the street and you know<br />
what they said to me? " Cheer up, grandpa" ( Laughter) And that<br />
was eighteen years ago. Now, in Melbourne, if they have a<br />
civic reception, you have a hundred carefully-chosen people;<br />
you go into a room, you stand on a little dais and speeches<br />
are made, I regret to say. In Sydney, in my experience, if<br />
they give you a civic reception, you stand near the door with<br />
the Lord Mayor and you shake hands with everybody and there<br />
are no speeches. This, I regard as the most civilised form of<br />
civic reception that I have so far encountered.<br />
One other little preliminary remark I would like<br />
to make and that is that the Mayor was kind enough to produce<br />
a brochure " Message from the Mayor of Casino" I did get<br />
this in Canberra and I studied it and when I had finished<br />
reading it, Mr, Mayor, I wondered what I had done to deserve<br />
the honour of visiting such a remarkable place, ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) " The Hub of the North" " The Crossroads of the<br />
North" I've been acquiring the language and high time<br />
too as somebody said, because although I have flown over<br />
Casino and I have passed through Casino by train in those<br />
happy days when we were allowed to travel by train, I have<br />
never~ in fact, beon inside the town before, and I have been<br />
delighed with what I have seen.<br />
You know, I think ladies and gentlemen, I c-tight<br />
to tell you so that there will be no misunderstanding, that I<br />
wasn't always a city slicker, I was born in the bush myself,<br />
in the wheat country up in the north-west of Victoria, and I<br />
grew up there and I know a little at first hand of the problems<br />
of the man who is on the land growing wheat. I dontt profess<br />
to have anything else but acquired information and knowledge<br />
about other rural industries, But I would like to say this to<br />
you Here I come into a country town, a sizable town what,<br />
8,000 something of that order, in the town itself. It has a<br />
great district around it. It's the centre of four or five<br />
remarkably important primary industries. And yet it, as a townm,<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
and its people as its citizens are producing services for<br />
the man on the land, marketing facilities for the man on the<br />
land, a meatworks, a butter factory, all this kind of thing.<br />
You know, this is worth thinking about. It's commonplace no<br />
doubt, to you, but it is a very important commonplace. it<br />
demonstrates the complete interdependence of the people who<br />
live in cities and towns and the people who carry on their<br />
productive labours on the land itself. Interdependence.<br />
I remember when I was a small boy in the part of<br />
the country in Victoria that I have mentioned, I used to hear<br />
arguments because people will argue wherever they are<br />
and the first political arguments I ever heard about were<br />
between protection and free trade. This would be relatitvely<br />
early in the first decade of this century. If you were a<br />
protectionist you were the enemy of the man on the land and if<br />
you were a free trader you were the enemy of the man in ~ h<br />
city. The arguments went on with immense ferocity and as I<br />
subsequently came to understand, with singularly little<br />
intelligence, I have lived long enough to find how well<br />
understood it is by all the people in the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament and many hundreds of thousands of people outside<br />
of it, how well tnderstood it is that there is an interdependence<br />
between manufacturing industries tertiary industries primary<br />
industries, because unless we all manage to hang together,_ we<br />
will, in the famous words of Lord Melbourne, hang separately.<br />
Let me illustrate this a little. One of the great<br />
problems of government I am not going to make a political<br />
speech, I don't think this is the occasion for it but one<br />
of the great problems that any government in Australia has,<br />
or will have, is to reconcile the vital interests of the<br />
country with the need to expand the population by a large<br />
stream of migration and further, with the development of<br />
secondary industries, to employ an increasing population. Now<br />
this sounds very easy. It is, in fact, the most complex<br />
problem in the world. No government in the world anywhere can<br />
profess to have solved the problem completely. Shortly I<br />
shall find myself talking with the President of the United<br />
States. He wontt have the complete answer to this matte".<br />
I will be talking to the new Prime Minister of Canada, W." o1<br />
is an old friend of mine. He won't have the complete answer<br />
to this matter. This is infinitely ditfi-cult) and above all,<br />
when governments approach these problems, they must not Just<br />
settle down to a dogma in their own mind; they must have<br />
flexible minds, they must be willing to make changes fromi time<br />
to time, so that they may preserve the balance of considerations<br />
that I have referred to.<br />
Now let me pursue that a little further, even though<br />
I am stealing my thunder for tonight. We have, in Australia<br />
and it is common to both parties a policy of large migration<br />
into Australia which this year will mean a total of something<br />
over 125,000 migrants. Add that to our natural increase of<br />
population, and for years and years now the population of our<br />
country has been increasing rather more rapidly than the<br />
population of Japan, It is worth thinking about that, This<br />
has been a tremendous accretion of numbers. You can't bring<br />
people to Australia and dump them down and say, " Well, now,<br />
heaven help you." t The state of the country must be such as<br />
to enable them to engage in gainful employment, in gainful<br />
occupation and establish themselves as citizens in our<br />
community and, for the overwhelming most part, they are very<br />
* a ass </p>
<p>.03<br />
willing to do that and have been very industrious and contributing<br />
people. But YOU can't employ more than a mere fraction<br />
of them on the land because in the great primary industries,<br />
the development of whose production has been I think, quite<br />
outstanding, there has developed particularly in som~ e of the<br />
industries, an increasing mechanisation. The increased outputt<br />
whether it is in beef' or mutton or lamb or whatever it may be,<br />
has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the<br />
number of people working on the farms. You all know this to<br />
be true, and therefore if we are going to hbave employment for<br />
many thousands of migrants each year then we must encourage<br />
the development of secondary industries and service and<br />
transport industries which can provide expanding opportunities<br />
for employment. Nobody really quarrels about that.<br />
One point then arises. I must say to you, quite<br />
frankly, I never permit myself to lose sight of it We are not<br />
to do thse things irresponsibly so that we push up costs and<br />
prices because the man who suffers from increased costs and<br />
prices is the farmer himself and he can't pass them on.,<br />
Somebody else may in a city, somebody else may running a<br />
service of some kind, but the man on the land, controlled as<br />
he is directly or indirectly by the world's markets, must at<br />
all el'fort prevent his costs from rising; have those costs<br />
prevented l'rom rising, where possible, by government action.<br />
Now it is a source of some satisfaction to all of us that in<br />
the last two or three years the costs have not risen I am<br />
taking the broad state of affairs in Australia. But unless<br />
governments continue to be careful, astute to watch this<br />
element, we could easily see costs rising, and rising against<br />
the man on the land. This is one matter which my distinguished<br />
colleague, John McEwen, the Minister for Trade, is discussing<br />
at this very moment in Geneva in the important trade talks<br />
that he has been having.<br />
. Can we by all the efforts in the world persuade<br />
the great industrial countries in the world Great Britain,<br />
the United States Germany and so on can we persuade them<br />
that it is essential from their point of view that the countries<br />
which are large exporters of primary products should have stable<br />
and payable prices for the things they produce? This is not<br />
easy. Great Britain herself has had a policy of cheap food.<br />
One can understand it for she is overwhelmingly an exporter<br />
of manufactured goods. The United States has had extremely<br />
high tariffs, even against wool, as we know in Australia. The<br />
President of the United States, I think has a fresh mind on<br />
this matter. He wants to negotiate with the world and he<br />
has now been given power to do it by his Congress to make<br />
flexible arrangements, to enter into commodity agreements with<br />
the rest of the world. This is what we are fighting for.<br />
Let us have a true sound, international commodity agreement<br />
in relation to mneat or wheat or butter or whatever it may be<br />
sugar, as we go further north and this would do more to<br />
stabilise the costs and profitability of primary industry than<br />
anything else that I can think of. Well, it is a hard job.<br />
My colleague is as capable as any man I know in the world in<br />
arguing that case ( Applause) but I will lay odds that when he<br />
gets back in a fortnight's time, he will be looking pretty drawn<br />
because this is a tough assignment.<br />
I mentioned that to you to illustrate the point<br />
that I was making. It is a good thing to be in a town like<br />
this and to be reminded of the fact that we all depend on each<br />
other, that not one of us in the town or out of it can live<br />
without the other. This is tremendously important and when<br />
you get an illustration of that in some country centre, it is<br />
vivid because it is close to you, 0 0 </p>
<p>You know, ladies and gentlemen, it is a very<br />
interesting thing in the history of Australia, to notice how<br />
many people who have been significant in our public affairs<br />
have come, either from the country itself or country towns,<br />
from areas outside the great metropolis of whatever State it<br />
may be, If I could talk to everybody in Casino and talk to<br />
all the youngsters in Casino, Itd say, ' Dontt be in too much<br />
of a hurry to think that there are hardships in living in a<br />
place like this." l You may ask " Wouldn't it be wonderful to<br />
live in Sydney?" or " Wouldn't It be wonderful to live in<br />
Melbourne?" Forget about it, Some of the men whose names<br />
are household names to us were born in smaller places than<br />
this and lived in smaller places than this, but because they<br />
had fresh minds and imagination and close experience, they<br />
became significant people. I could refer to a dozen people<br />
of moment who came from quite small centres of population.<br />
There is a great privilege in living in a place like this.<br />
A wonderful privilege and I hope that nobody here, particularly<br />
tiue very young, will cease to understand that.<br />
Now, Sir, you have been extraordinarily good to<br />
me. All sorts of very generous remarks have been made I've<br />
even been tempted by you, Mr. Mayor to say something about<br />
New Guinea, Well, if you don't mina, I do an awful lot of<br />
work at the weekends. I have to because I don't get much<br />
chance to do it when the House is sitting. But one job 1was<br />
doing during this weekend was to prepare myself a statement on<br />
the review of Australian defence policy. In the course of<br />
that I will perhaps say a few things that will be of interest<br />
to you. Well, I won't say it until I get up in the House and<br />
deliver it I dontt know when perhaps tomorrow. Depends<br />
on what time I get hack tonight, or Wednesday, or conceivably<br />
Thursday. Nor, Sir, I want to thank all of you who have come<br />
here this afternoon, As I tell you quite seriously, I have<br />
never had a civic reception like this before and if some of<br />
my critics are right in what they say, I'll never have one<br />
again. ( Applause) At any rate, I have had the advantage of<br />
really a quite human audience of men women women have the<br />
divine faculty of not being hostile io you, except at a<br />
political meeting ( Laughter) and children. I hope your<br />
prayers will be with me tonight when I have to address myself<br />
to the meatworks authorities of the State of New South Wales<br />
hardbitten men who will be looking at me expecting a message<br />
and seeking to convert me, if they need Lo. ( Laughter)<br />
I11l conclude by saying this. Flying up today from<br />
Canberra, we came low over Kempsey and circled low 500 or<br />
600 feet ( that mustntt be used against us) over Grafton,<br />
I realise that I did not see these floods at their worst because<br />
it was clear, looking down, from the watermarks and so on that<br />
the floods had subsided perceptibly. But there have been<br />
disastrous floods and they have the habit of occurring with<br />
almost dreadful regularity,<br />
There is no doubt about it that a lot of heads will<br />
have to be put together, not just to consider this matter as<br />
an occasional exercise of some relief of distress, accept the<br />
flood as inevitable; we have to put our heads together to see<br />
how this can be prevented or mitigated on a permanent basis.<br />
( Applause) I won't say any more about that. It is a matter<br />
0 D </p>
<p>that engages the sympathy of all of us, but I know that the<br />
local authorities in assembling their views I understand<br />
that they are going to put it to the State administration<br />
which of course has the primary responsibility on such work,<br />
and if experience counts for anything and I have had a good<br />
deal now I anticipate that at some stage the State will say<br />
something to the Commonwealth. So I will wait until then.<br />
All I say at this time is that this is one of the problems in<br />
Australia which really ought not to be dealt with on a shinplaster<br />
basis, In fact when they tell me to get up and be excited<br />
because another rocket is going around the world or a capsule<br />
or something and that it costs a couple of hundred million<br />
pounds to put it up, I find myself saying in a dull and<br />
unimaginative fashion to myself, " A mere fraction of that<br />
year by year and I can solve most of the developmental problems<br />
of my own country." ( Hear, hear, applause) </p>
