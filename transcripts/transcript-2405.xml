QUESTIONS P1. T TO THE PR V1EM M7 ! NSTER AT TH. E NATIONAL<br />
PRESS ' 1971<br />
Q. Vincent Matthews Me itrne Herald. Mr. Prime Minister, could<br />
you tell us, apar. from th 2 wheit the Government is actually doing<br />
or contemplating oic tc -s: 7o of-the China market is<br />
not lost in the future to Aut~ asc~ otindu~ t-;. i, Iand could you perhaps<br />
elaborate on 24ect Jm~ ;~ cndacshcwe had, particularly<br />
the attitaide of the Democratic-La~ iur Party on the Government's approach to<br />
the China problem?<br />
PM If I can answer the second part of your question first. Naturally as<br />
Members of Parifament, and a mters of a Gcvernment we have to take a total<br />
look at the political picture befoire adi'-cisions aire made. But on our attitude<br />
to trade with Continental China2, ad c-i our attitut'. z to the position of Taiwan<br />
China in the United Nation., i can as~ n~ you thXath; is is a Government decision<br />
and I now reflect Government -, 11* izW hi is deciId in the interests of the<br />
Australian nation, and that pc-tior: vi13 dEpci. t ate our policy in every respect in<br />
the future. As to the first part of your qjuastion I will divide the question if I<br />
can into three different sectikmr.-. kir.-. t of all as to our actual trade with China<br />
itself unless goods come with-in wi-at is called the Strategic Limitation List<br />
or finless it comes within a special list of which we have administered quite<br />
severely in recent years, then our own people are free to go and to return from<br />
China and to trade with them to the maximnum of their capacity. So they can go,<br />
they can trade. I can move a stage further and sa-y that our own people, of course,<br />
have no obstacle placed in their y ii they want to go, and for that matter unless<br />
there are security reasons invoi,. zod, involving the Peking Government itself,<br />
then our citizens are free to r: un. I hope you'll understand the reservation<br />
that I have made about security reasons coming from the Peking Government<br />
itself.<br />
Q. Ted Barker West Australian. Sir there was a certain amount of<br />
concern last year about i . m_; rts of iron and scmp steel to China.<br />
As Foreign Ministcer you' saild a hat you would re-examine the list of<br />
strategic mateiiithat cau, 3. dnrot be iaxxxted. Has there been any change in<br />
policy as a result of that re-. ivv; w have cj aterials such as iron, scrap steel and<br />
zinc been added to the list of prohibited exports"<br />
PM Yes I have. Ever since I made the statement or answered a question<br />
in~ a h thr-o~ s-i'er ne~ View. I've also had it considered by<br />
the Government-and s~ rvf111 bi': 2er the measures that we've taken in<br />
order to ensure greater trade '. Corntnental China.<br />
Q. Brown Brisbene CPr-Mail. Prime Minister you seem to have<br />
left out one current imp " tir~ t c Z South Afri. an sporting tours. What<br />
action do you plan to talKe afgai.. ntst ~. s_'. or-ACTU boycott?<br />
PM Thanks for that buec: oa~ use I've A&amp; re-ndy answered this once in<br />
the House and I reg,.-zr1 it as nJt b -hz CT n h ao<br />
Party that they shouid try and stp sportiimg terns from coming to this country. </p>
<p>We have the Gallup Polls 85 per cent of the Australian people thought they should<br />
come. Now we don't like apartheid and already I have sent a message to the South<br />
African Government, letting the South African Government know what I and my<br />
Government, for that matter, think of their action in stopping two native South<br />
Africans from coming out here with the South African cricket team. But we have<br />
taken this attitude. We believe, and I'm sure most Australians agree with this<br />
point of view, that we must not import our politics Into our sporting or cultural<br />
life. I can explain it to you in this way. What a strange thing it is that an ACTIJ<br />
that is supposed to be looking after industrial relations, should gang up with a group<br />
within the Australian Labor Party and say yes, let politics superimpose itself on<br />
every single aspect of our lives. If you'd like to took at it in a different way in<br />
terms of our cultural relations, we don't agree with the USSR as to what its social<br />
and political system might be. But we don't stop their sporting teams, and the Bolshoi<br />
Ballet from coming here. Even in the case of Continental China, of the Peoples'.<br />
Re public of China, they are now permitting a sporting team of the Unites States one<br />
of their bitterest enemies to go there, indicating that they want a liberalisation so<br />
far as these extra-political activities are concerned. I want to warn you of this<br />
factor. You must now have recollections of the shadows of the twelve faceless<br />
men, when the ACTU, not elected to Parliament by the people, when the Mick<br />
Youngs not elected by the people of Australia to the Parliament are trying to<br />
determine every single aspect of the social and cultural and sporting life of this<br />
community. In my view the Australian people will regard it with resentment, and<br />
I believe that they will treat these sporting teams, if they come, in exactly the<br />
same way as they treated the South African Surf Life Saving Association. They gave<br />
them a marvelous welcome, and I hope they show their strong sporting instincts<br />
and give the cricket team and the football team when it comes, that they give them the<br />
same kind of reception as th ey gave the Surf Life Association members.<br />
Q. John Lombard Mel bourne Sun. Both the Treasury and Mr. Bury say<br />
there will have to be a new Federal Tax. The Treasurer is reported as believing it<br />
oi4ght to be a tax on retail sales. Do you believe a new tax will have to be found to<br />
supplement income tax and what are your views on a retail sales tax?<br />
PM These views have never been communicated to me directly and I have<br />
no paper at all in front of me from ie Treasury or from the Treasurer or from<br />
any other group of officials recommending any new type of tax.<br />
Q. Max Hawkins, Brisbane Telegraph. Mr. Prime Minister on March 21<br />
when you announced your Ministry, you said -you intended to appoint certain<br />
Assistant Ministers or Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. Can you tell us how far<br />
you have got with this proposal?<br />
PM There are two pieces of uncompleted business. One is the appointment<br />
of a Minister to head the new Department of the Vice-President of the Executive<br />
Council that will look after a wide range of environmental and cultural relationships,<br />
and the other is the problem of Assistant Ministers. I have not in the time<br />
available been able to deal with either of these problems because until the last f ew<br />
days I have not had worked out in specific and legal terms what the responsibilities<br />
and the conditions under which the Assistant Ministers can in fact be apppointed, a a / 3 </p>
<p>particularly in order to meet the Constitutional requirement that they cannot accept<br />
an office of profit under the Crown. All the details have now been completed and I<br />
hope as soon as the House rises I will be able to appoint the new Minister as well<br />
as being able to appoint the Assistant Ministers at the same time. I might, if I can<br />
just add this. I might find it desirable some time next week or the week after to<br />
be able to put down a paper in the House explaining the true i1~ ettion so far as it<br />
concerns the Assistant Ministers.<br />
Michael Richardson Melbourne Age. Could you give us an<br />
explanation about why the Chinese bought a large quantity of wheat from Canada<br />
recently. It was noted at the time that the announcement was made shortly after<br />
Canada announced formal diplomatic recognition of Peking.<br />
First I want to remind you of the backgrourd against which this<br />
problem is being considered. I have said that our position cannot under any<br />
circumstances be regarded as a difficult one. But secondly why China chose to<br />
buy not a large quantity of wheat as you have said but a much reduced quantity<br />
of wheat, of high protein wheat from Canada. Thirdly I admit that there was a<br />
strange sort of coincidence between the date on which the wheat was purchased<br />
and the negotiations that were taking place in New York at the United Nations<br />
relating to recognition and the Albanian Vote. But I am not privy to the mind of<br />
the Peking Chinese. I am not privy to the mind of the Canadian Government. In<br />
my conversations with Mitchell Sharp, I came away no better informed than I was<br />
when I first started to speak to him.<br />
Peter Samuel Bulletin. I want to ask two questions. Firstly,<br />
a cultural one, secondly a sporting one. On the cultural one, what are you going to<br />
do about the proposal for a National Art Gallery here in Canberra? There has been<br />
a proposal for a Director of that Gallery and the plans are all prepared for its<br />
construction. Secondly, on the sporting question, the question of the ACTU's<br />
proposed black ban on dealing with the Sac th African cricketers when they come<br />
here, in a previous case where the Government has disapproved of a black ban in<br />
t he case of the black ban on the export of merino rams the Government moved<br />
in and used Service transport to break this black ban. It would seem logical if<br />
you disapproved of this black ban to give consideration to using the Forces at your<br />
command to break this black ban, too. Would you consider doing that?<br />
As to the first question, which is, I must confess, a sensitive and<br />
difficult one, I have appointed Sir Alan Hulme to act as the temporary Minister<br />
in charge of the portfolio of Vice-President of the Executive Council, and he for the<br />
moment has this task of deciding what is to be done. I can't give you any greater<br />
answer than that other than some possible solutions have been put to me but have<br />
not been put in a way that I would be able to make an immediate decision about it.<br />
I am afraid this will have to wait for some time until I get more time to be able<br />
to devote attention to it. As to the second question as to what we will do if the<br />
South African cricketers do come, regrettably in a way, we can't transport them<br />
in the same way as we did the merino sheep: But my very sincere hope is that by<br />
that time the Australian people themselves will let both the ALP and the AC'Tt<br />
know of their revulsion of feeling that these extra-Government organisations shnuld<br />
try and dominate the Australian political scene and should determine what happens<br />
in cultural and social affairs and sprnrting affairs iirthis country. But the true<br />
so. / 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
answer to your question that is the second question is that at the moment it<br />
is too hypothetical. I think it is best if you intend to do something, to reserve<br />
your own opinion as to'what you will do and meet those when they actually have to<br />
be met.<br />
Q. Fingleton Argus Group of South African newspapers. The<br />
trade unions, Mr. Hawke and Mr. Whitlam I don't know whether I have given<br />
the right batting order have threatened a boycott of the South African team.<br />
Can you say, Mr. Prime Minister, whether either the Australian Board of Cricket<br />
Control or the Rugby Union Board has been in touch with you as to your views<br />
whether the tour should be cancelled either tour and if they do, would your<br />
opinion still be the same as you expressed here today that the tours should proceed?<br />
PM I think your batting order was wrong on this issue. I think it was<br />
Young, H-awke and Mr. Whitlam might have been somewhere in the team but I didn't<br />
notice it: As to the second part of your question, the Secretary of the Australian<br />
Cricket Control Board, Alan Barnes, has been in touch with me and I have informed<br />
him that we would offer no objection to the tour and that i t should go on. To the<br />
best of my knowledge, the Australian Rugby Union authorities have not been in<br />
contact with me or with the Department. Nonetheless, I will check on this fact,<br />
Mr. Fingleton, and I will let you know as soon as I can.<br />
Q. Commins, A. B. C. In the context of controlling inflation, you said<br />
amongst the measures to be taken would be to strengthen the Arbitration Commission.<br />
Do you imply by this they are not doing their job now, or in what manner would<br />
you do it? Also, Sir, in the same context, Sir Colin Syme has recommended some<br />
advance in unemployment as a means of controlling inflation and Mr. Hawke has<br />
said he would not have been game to have said', this under Mr. Gorton, but is game to<br />
do so under you.<br />
PM That is Mr. Hawke's opinion, and in public like this I must refrain<br />
from expressing any personal opinions about him. But if I can deal with the opinions<br />
expressed by Sir Colin Syme, 1, for one, do not believe that the creation of<br />
unemployment is the way in which you solve your problems of inflation. Every<br />
country that has tried to create unemployment, or permitted unemployment to develop<br />
has failed miserably and I think it should be known that the one Government that<br />
solved the problem of unemployment before any other was the Government started<br />
by Menzies, continued through Mr. Holt and Mr. Gorton and now led by myself.<br />
With us, full employment is a cardinal act of political faith and we will sustain<br />
it and won't resort to any kind of unemployment in order to achieve our objective.<br />
And I repeat again, I don't think this is a very satisfactory way of handling it.<br />
That, too, might answer Mr. Hawke as to whether or not he thinks there might<br />
be a different approach during the course of the last three ar four weeks. I have<br />
forgotten the first part of your question could you repeat it?<br />
Q.' Sir, it was to control inflation you were aiming to strengthen<br />
the Arbitration Act.... </p>
<p>PM Well, I said we would try. We will be looking to see whether there<br />
are some methods by which we can ensure that the Arbitration Commission itself<br />
does try and control the whole of the structure of the Arbitration Commission, in<br />
order to ensure that the Commissioners fit in with the policy directives or the policy<br />
lines that are determined by the Presidential Members themselves. But this is only<br />
one area that we are looking at. We want to look at the total area to see if we can<br />
make some contribution here to strengthening the forces which will reign back or<br />
break back inflationary tendencies in our community.<br />
Q. Tom Connors Financial Review. How closely does the<br />
Government watch and check the activities of the Australian Wool Commission<br />
which has built up a considerable stockpile of wool without actually checking the<br />
drift in prices, and what form will the proposed review of the Commission's<br />
activities take at the end of this financial year?<br />
PM As to the second part of your question, this is a matter witich is<br />
within the jurisdiction of both Trade and Treasury and they will be advisixg us towards<br />
the end of the season, or at the end of the season, what they think should be done and<br />
will be making their recommendation to the Cabinet. So far as watching the<br />
activities of the Commission, as I understand it, and I am not in the machine for<br />
this myself, but as I understand it and it is agreed to by the Australian Wool<br />
Commission itself that there is regular examination of the activities of the<br />
QCommission and that the Commission regularly reports not only to Primary Industry,<br />
Trade but also to Treasury as well.<br />
Q. Tony Thomas Melbourne Age. It has been mentioned that private<br />
office construction has fallen off lately in view of the economic climate, On the<br />
other hand State and Commonwealth, or rather Government off ice construction is<br />
iiicreasing fairly sharply. How do you regard this?<br />
PM. I didn't phrase it in exactly the same way as you've said. I did<br />
say that because there had been over-building in commercial and industrial<br />
buildings we had been advised by the civil construction people that automatically<br />
there would be a reduction because they wouldn't be able to find rentals for the<br />
space that had been built. I agree with you that it has been difficult to reduce<br />
State expenditure on public works. But what we are doing now and I want to<br />
emnphasise this and I thought I'd emphasised in the body of my speech itself that<br />
qt the time of the next Budget we must ensure that public works expenditure<br />
Commonwealth or States that the rate of increase is reduced to what we could<br />
regard as a satisfactory level. Once you've got committed, as they have got<br />
committed in this present Budget year or the Budget year of the Commonwealth<br />
or the States, it's difficult to stop expenditure. But when we start on the new year<br />
that is the appropriate time when we ensure or do our best to ensure that the<br />
rate of increase in these works and services is reigned in.<br />
Q. Richard Ackland from Maxwell Newton's publications Two<br />
questions Prime Minister in your capacity as a Treasury expert can New Guinea.<br />
pay all the subscription to the Asian Development Bank, and what are the<br />
advantages of New Guinea being a member? And secondly, are you going to<br />
press ahead for an abolition on withholding tax to interest payments overseas<br />
as the previous Prime Minister announced last year? 0 / 6 </p>
<p>PM As to the second one yes. As to the first as Foreign Minister<br />
I did all in my power to ensure that Papua/ New Gu,-nea became a member of<br />
ECAFE, and through becomin. g a memi; er of ECAFE became a member of ECOSOC<br />
and through becoming a merrnmr of ECOSOC wa3s nittled to participate in the<br />
World Bank and the 2DC. Secondly I had -s the fu; l objertive and w, achieved<br />
it of making ? apua/ New Gur. nea a , r. emer of te A-' an Development Bank. We<br />
did this because we tknew thn. r iv didn't marter w'hat . ontrbu: ton was made by<br />
Papua / New Guinea either oEf ts own ~: cdgerncus tfnds or through advances<br />
provided by the Commonwealth tha aitt ist t woi: id get benefits many, many,<br />
many times greater than the contribution :! at it would make the initial contribution<br />
it would make to those funds. If you can l at the participation of the World<br />
Bank in the construction and development projects for Papua/ New Guinea you will<br />
know what I mean. Equally am I certain tat not only so far as expertise, but access<br />
to funds is concerned, the Asian Development Bank will turn out to be a very, very<br />
good investment project.<br />
Q. Hugh Armfield Melbourne Age Bearing in mind how you've<br />
handled relations within the Liberal Party, pensioners, Premiers' Conference<br />
and the Queensland Government since becoming Prime Minister, would you regard<br />
this period as one in which your main role has been that of a peacemaker?<br />
PM I know the word I'd like to use, but as you know in a press<br />
gathering you've only got to use one word in humour and it's likely to be taken<br />
seriously and so I refrain from using the word. I wouldn't like to give it any<br />
conceivable sort of title other than to say that I believe it's been in the best<br />
interests of this country. And I hope that during my term of office as the<br />
Prime Minister, whatever I do is not determined by a title, or by any other<br />
grouping of words or phrases, but is determined in the national interest and the<br />
national interest alone.<br />
Q. Bruce Juddery Canberra Times. I've also got a double-pronged<br />
question, Sir. Last January, your , predecessor said in Singapore that within<br />
the next two years the State Governments must legislate to remove all<br />
discriminatory legislation on the aboriginal question or else the Commonwealth<br />
would do so for them. Since then you've apparently made some progress last<br />
week I think it was in Queensland. Sir are you committed to this undertaking<br />
of your predecessor, and more generally what thoughts do you have on the<br />
progress of aboriginals and the Commonwealth's role in seeking that progress?<br />
Secondly, Sir, you have recently removed the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, the<br />
Office of the Environment, various cultural groups you mention from your own<br />
Department where their presence was an earnest of the Prime Minister's personal<br />
commitment and concern for these issues, to another Department whose Head has<br />
got a fairly grandiloquent title but no particular guarantee of access or influence<br />
within the Government. Are you not concerned that some sections of the community<br />
may think you're playing down these relatively minor in absolute terms<br />
but nevertheless emotionally-charged issues?<br />
PM As to the first question there is a great deal of difficulty about<br />
definition. I sometimes feel that the word " discriminatory" is used too freely,<br />
and that what has to be thought of is some sort of means of protection of<br />
certain sections of the aboriginal community. But to come down to the facts of<br />
life, I did obtain from Mr. Wentworth a note as to 11 different areas where he<br />
felt we should try and come to an accommodation with the Queensland Government. / 7 </p>
<p>I went up and I had the most successful discussions with the Premier, with<br />
Mr. Gordon Chalk the Treasurer, and their officials and with Sir Alan Hulme and my<br />
own officials. On 9 of the 11 points that I put to him, they were all agreed to by the<br />
Queensland Premier, and we will have no difficulty about them whatsoever. On the<br />
other two, I believe protective measures may perhaps be taken. If I can just mention<br />
some of them to you. That is people can freely leave the Reserves. Access to the<br />
Reserves will be under the control of the Aboriginal Councils themselves. There<br />
are really a lot of matters of this kind discrimination and a separate Act of<br />
Parliament relating to the Torres Strait Islanders. The only place where there was<br />
an agreement between us that I can regard as of a protective kind was so far as<br />
alcohol is concerned, and there, the proposition was put to me that each of the<br />
Local Councils should have the right to determine whether or not alcohol should be<br />
permitted on the Reserve itself. In other words, not that it should freely come in<br />
but those elected by the members of the mission or the members of the station<br />
should have the right to determine. I felt this was a wise recommendation and one<br />
I immediately agreed to. The second one that caused a little discussion but again<br />
we came to a sensible solution related to control over property. And here it was<br />
felt that if you immediately gave some aboriginals immediate access to considerable<br />
suims of money, that they could be exploited. And consequently it was felt that the<br />
Aboriginal Council itself should have some power of supervision, and that if there<br />
was extreme difficulty relating to exploitation, then the State ( lovernment<br />
Administration itself should have the power to protect the aborigine. The details of<br />
these last two have not been worked out. But I must confess they seem to me to be<br />
sensible propositions and one that when we look at we can consider the details and<br />
I am fairly certain we can come to a happy conclusion about it. So I don't believe<br />
under these circumstances that legislation is necessary or desirable. Nor do I<br />
tjiink for one moment that my predecessor thought that under all circumstances<br />
legislation would be enforced. What he did say, I believe, was that unless our<br />
requirements are met, then we may be compelled to legislate. As our requirements<br />
have in fact been met or are in the process of being met, then I don't think legislation<br />
i s necessary and that consequently I don't think that there'll be any need for me to<br />
introduce it.<br />
Q. Richard Carleton This Day Tonight. The influence Sir of the DLP over a<br />
number of Government decisions in recent years has been quite evident. Bearing<br />
in mind Senator Gair's attitude towards recognition of mainland China, what attempt<br />
do you make to accommodate him before reaching a final decision on Australia's p<br />
position.<br />
PM I think I've said to you that the immediate problem that we face and one that<br />
ought to be solved before we come to grips with the problem of recognition is<br />
admission or the tretention of the position of Taiwan in the United Nations. As the<br />
first part of the question relating to recognition of Peking China is hypothetical and,<br />
in any event, is something that we'd have to deal with not in the immediate future,<br />
I think being hypothetical it's best to be left exactly where it is.<br />
Q. Alan Fitzgerald. Sir your predecessor suggested that he may enfranchise<br />
18-year-olds in Federal Elections. The States of Western Australia and South<br />
Australia have done so, which if you don't act could perhaps lead to a situation in<br />
the next Federal Election where 18-year-olds in two States of the Commonwealth<br />
were voting, and 18-year-olds in the other four and the Commonwealth Territories<br />
weren't. Have you given this your consideration? / 8 </p>
<p>PM I'm glad that you've given me your opinion of the Constitutional<br />
legal position.' I can assure you that there's a wide divergence of views amongst<br />
all those I've consulted, and I'm not happy about any of their opinions, with the<br />
exception of the former Attorney-General and the Present Attorney-General too.<br />
But what I've decided to do, and I've answered a question on this in the House on<br />
at least. one occasion, was to say that I've given assurances to my Party to the<br />
Liberal-Country Parties that before the Government makes up its mind as to<br />
what it will do, that there is to be full and frank discussion of this in the Party<br />
room. That hasn't happened yet.<br />
Q. Bob Baudino Daily Telegraph. This is a supplementary<br />
question. You referred to the opinions of the former Attorney-General and<br />
the present Attorney-General What were those opinions?<br />
PM I'm not prepared -these are Government documents..... I'm<br />
talking about the Constitutional position and this is the position relating to the<br />
interpretation of the Constitution. I'm not talking about the political aspects<br />
of whether or not it should be done. Frankdy at this moment, as I've said, I<br />
think there are divergences of opinion as to what the position is, both in relation<br />
to the House and of the Senate. As they're government documents I've got no<br />
intention of saying what they are.<br />
Q. Maximillian Walsh Financial Review. In your initial speech,<br />
Sir, you said that Australia would do all it could providing the Republic of China<br />
wants to sustain its position in the General Assembly, to make sure it is<br />
sustained there. Do you think that the Republic of China would be happy to have<br />
to sit in the General Assembly with Mainland China?<br />
PM . I couldn't give the answer to that question, nor does anyone other<br />
than Chiang Kai-shek himself nor is any other person than Chiang Kai-shek able<br />
to give an expression of opinion as to what Taiwan Chinai would want.<br />
Q. Barry Wain from the Australian. Mr. Prime Minister, on<br />
Australia's phased withdrawal from Vietnam, for the next round is it militarily<br />
feasible, for one battalion to be withdrawn or would they have to both come out<br />
together?<br />
PM Once upon a time we had only one battalion there and it seemed<br />
to be feasible then. But I don't want under any circumstances to commit<br />
ourselves to the future. Before any further action is taken and as yet I<br />
haven't asked that action be initiated before any action is initiated, we would<br />
want the comments and the recommendations of the Defence Committee and the<br />
Chiefs of Staff Committee. I repeat I haven't asked them to give me an<br />
opinion yet.<br />
Q. Peter Samuel of the Bulletin The question of the role of our<br />
troops in Malaysia. The former Prime Minister seemed to imply that they were<br />
confined in their defence role to the mainland of Malaysia to what he called<br />
Malaya. Is this still Government policy? .000 ./ 9 </p>
<p>I think it was put a little differently. In fact I am sure it was put<br />
a little differently. The word " Malaya" was used and primarily they are there in<br />
order to provide confidence during the period the Malaysians and the Singaporeanc<br />
are building up their armed forces. But as was made clear both by the former<br />
Minister for Defence and the former Minister for External Affairs, that does not<br />
automatically count out a contribution that we could make if we were asked and if<br />
in our wisdom we thought a contribution should in fact be made<br />
outside the mainland....<br />
Outside the mainland.<br />
Max Hawkins again Prime M. inister. I think when on the day that<br />
you were elected Prime Minister you gave a strong indication that your then<br />
thinking was that the present Parliament would run out its full course. Has anything<br />
happened in the last month or so which might have influenced you to change your<br />
mind and perhaps think of an early election?<br />
So much happens every day that I never make up my mind firmly<br />
about any matter until I'm compelled to do so.<br />
Michael Guy Reuters Economic Services. Mr. Anthony recently<br />
said the attitude to China is governed to a large degree by the attitude of the<br />
United States. To what degree do you regard this as governing Australia's<br />
attitude to the Republic? I think I've expressed my views and I believe Government views<br />
a few moments ago when I said that our actions and our policy decisions will<br />
be ietermined by what I and the Government feels is in the best interests of the<br />
Australian people. Now you would have read in today's paper that President<br />
Nixon has somewhat liberalised the approach of the United States to Continental<br />
China. And he had announced shortly after the Nixon Doctrine that certain changes<br />
that were taking place in American policy. I think I can say that in many respects<br />
we are in advance of them, because as I said a few moments ago, we don't place<br />
any obstacle in the road of our own people going to China in the case of trade we<br />
do not unless the goods come themselves within the strategic limitations, or<br />
limitations that are imposed because of military reasons we permit trade to<br />
take place and we buy goods from China. And our ships freely move into Chinese<br />
ports as well. So that, consequently, I think it is difficult to sustain an argument<br />
that we are dependent upon United States' views. Of course we want to co-operate<br />
with them as closely as we can. They are great, and friendly allies, but under<br />
no circumstances do I think that our policies ought to be dictated by what the<br />
United States does, or what the United States might want.<br />
Michael Richardson Melbourne Age. There is a rising tide<br />
of public concern in Australia about the related matters of environmental<br />
pollution and conservation. Do you regard these matters as serious problems<br />
and do you think the Commonwealth is doing enough to help deal with them? </p>
<p>PM I think I should have answered the question that you asked me a<br />
few moments ago, and thanks for the opportunity of coming back to that part of<br />
his question which I ignored answering. As you know we've already dealt ' with<br />
the question of pollution of the Barrier Reef and the Crown of Thorns Starfish.<br />
You know at the present time there are two committees of the Senate meeting.<br />
I have or Sir Alan Hulme has stated that the Professor who was the Chairman of<br />
the Committee that looked into the Crown of Thorns Starfish has recommended to<br />
me that there should be a general enquiry into pollution of which he would be only<br />
too happy to participate either as a member, or as the chairman. This is a<br />
tremendously important subject and consequently I've placed it, with aboriginals,<br />
as one of the major subjects or jurisdictions that are under the supervision of the<br />
new Minister. I take it extremely seriously. But before we act, I believe we've<br />
got to get the best advice and know exactly where we're going. And I believe that<br />
the report that we received on the Crown of Thorns Starfish indicates quite clearly<br />
that precipitate action can be dangerous. It's best to know the biological and<br />
other reasons before remedial action -is taken. To come back to your question of<br />
aborigines, I can give you an assurance that the Minister who is appointed will be<br />
in the closest contact with me, and I regard it as my personal responsibility<br />
to see that we do everything we can to integrate the Australian aborigine into the<br />
Australian community.<br />
Q. Mr. Fingleton Mr. Prime Minister, should Dr. Patterson go to<br />
Communist China and return with a wheat order, would you see that it was fulfilled?<br />
PM I'm sorry to have to correct you, But I think you know that the<br />
Wheat Board is there as. the Australian Government authority and the representative<br />
Of the Australian wheat-growing interests for the sale of wheat overseas. If he can<br />
go and get a contract where the Australian Wheat Board itself in the last week has<br />
failed, then . his proper course of action is to go to the Chairman of the Wheat Board,<br />
put his proposition there, and see what the price is arid let them make their decision.<br />
I'm one of those who believes that once you've appointed an authority, particularly<br />
one that has been so unbelievably successful in its sale of wheat when other countries<br />
haven't been anywhere near as successful, then you repose you r confidence and<br />
trust in them. I'll leave it to them, because I know they'll do ever so much better<br />
over the long term than Dr. Patterson has any hope of doing.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you spoke in your opening remarks about the<br />
communications gap. I may be inflicted with one myself in as much as in your<br />
opening remarks you deplored the fact that Mr. Hawke and the Leader of the Labour<br />
Association would be leading the delegation to China on this wheat business...<br />
PM Would what...<br />
Q. Would be leading a delegation... would be going to China in a<br />
delegation on these wheat negotiations. You referred to the fact that Mr. Hawke<br />
and the Leader of the Labour Association would be going....<br />
PM Promoted... Promoted. No " promote". Well if I could correct<br />
this then. If I said " going", my pronounciation was no where near as good as I'd<br />
Q. like it to be. I meant promoting it. </p>
