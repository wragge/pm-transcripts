PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 September 1984<br />
After all the extreme assertions and allega~ tions levelled<br />
by Mr Peacock, what emerged yesterday was a statement which:<br />
fails completely to substantiate the grave personal<br />
allegations made against me<br />
is based on misrepresentation and distortion<br />
will be totally unconvincing to the Australian people.<br />
The record is clear. This Government has consistently had, and<br />
continues to have, an absolute commitment to the fight against<br />
organised crime.<br />
Mr Peacock called upon the Government to release the Costigan<br />
report. I have made it clear on a number of occasions, most<br />
recently in the Parliament on 12 September, that the Government<br />
is committed to the earliest possibl. e release of Mr Costigan's<br />
forthcoming report, limited only by Mr Costigan's own<br />
recommendations on confidentiality and the need to ensure that<br />
investigations are not prejudiced. on which point we will also<br />
be guided by those who will have responsibilities in this regard.<br />
The point was clearly made that should the Parliament not be<br />
sitting, the Government will take steps to permit the appropriate<br />
public release of the report. r. </p>
<p>This Government has been concerned to give the greatest possible<br />
support to the Costigan Royal Commission. Early in the life of<br />
this Government, in May 1983, the Government significantly<br />
increased the financial and staffing resources available to<br />
Mr Costigan. The previous Government had provided the Commission<br />
with a staff of approximately 70 people. Under this Government the<br />
number of people employed by the Commission has risen to<br />
approximately 120, so allowing for the recruitment of additional.<br />
professional legal staff, intelligence collators, and research,<br />
records and ADP staff. New and larger prE! mises were provided<br />
for the Commission. What has been done by this Government proves<br />
the falsity of the assertion that we have failed to support<br />
Mr Costigan.<br />
Neither this Government nor its predecessor intended that the<br />
Costigan Royal Commission would continue indefinitely. This<br />
Government reached the view that it should seek to establish<br />
a National Crime Authority structured in a different way to a<br />
Royal Commission but able to take over, on a continuing basis,<br />
those of the Costigan Commission's investigations which bear<br />
on organised crime more generally than just in connection with<br />
the Federated Painters and Dockers Union.<br />
The National Crime Authority will clearly not be the under-powered<br />
body described by Mr Peacock. While it is carrying out<br />
investigations into matters referred to it by the Inter-<br />
Governmental Committee, it will be able to exercise considerable<br />
coercive powers. These powers include the right to summon </p>
<p>witnesses, to require the production of documents, to make<br />
applications for search warrants, -to seize material pursuant<br />
to those search warrants and to seek judicial orders to have<br />
passports delivered to it.<br />
In addition to these considerable coercive powers and this is<br />
where the National Crime Authority differs from the Royal<br />
Commission model there is also provisign for the protection of<br />
fundamental civil liberties and for the active participation of<br />
the States. As Special Prosecutor Redlich noted in his Annual<br />
Report ( p. 48) " The National Crime Authority Act 1984 gives<br />
genuine emphasis to all three considerations. The Authority<br />
has the scope to maintain the initiatives developed by the<br />
Costigan Royal Commission."<br />
Mr Peacock quotes in a most misleading fashion from comments made<br />
by Senator Evans on the role of the States under the previous<br />
Government's National Crime Commission by deleting the very<br />
significant qualification made by Senator Evans that State<br />
co-operation would ultimately need to be forthcoming.<br />
Mr Peacock tries to claim that matters under investigation by<br />
Mr Costigan cannot be transferred directly to the new National<br />
Crime Authority. In fact, all references from the commission have<br />
been made available to the National Crime Authority and is<br />
presently being examined by its members. The Authority will then<br />
make recommendations to the Inter-Governmental Committee about<br />
the references it believes it should receive from the Committee. </p>
<p>4.<br />
This Government has always recognised the need, as the previous,<br />
Government did, for a transition period which would overlap<br />
conclusion of the Costigan Commission and the establishment of<br />
the National Crime Authority. The opposition's actions in<br />
referring the National Crime Authority Bill to a Senate Committee<br />
in November 1983 delayed the establishment of the Authority.<br />
But the Government has always sought to cd-operate with Mr<br />
Costigan to ensure a successful transition.<br />
In this regard, the statement by Mr Peacock that I did not<br />
bother to reply to a particular letter from Mr Costigan is<br />
blatantly and obviously misleading and typical of his selective<br />
and tendentious quoting from tabled correspondence. The copy<br />
of that letter which was tabled in the Parliament carries a<br />
special annotation noting that the Special. Minister of State,<br />
Mr Young met with Mr Costigan one week after Mr Costigan' s<br />
letter was received. At that meeting Mr Young and Mr<br />
Costigan agreed on a transition timetable. After the meeting<br />
a statement agreed between Mr Young and Mr Costigan was<br />
released on the future timetable of the Royal Commission.<br />
Mr Peacock tries to imply that the Government has some political<br />
concern about the effects of Mr Costigan's forthcoming report.<br />
The lessons of history show that Mr Costigan's investigations<br />
uncovered widespread illicit activity by the tax-avoiding<br />
friends of the Liberal Party. These revelations were considerably<br />
embarrassing to the Fraser Government. But this Government has no<br />
reason to believe that the Costigan Commission's investigations<br />
will reflect adversely on it.<br />
1 </p>
<p>Mr Keating has already denied completely allegations that he suggested<br />
to the Cabinet that the Costigan Commission should be prematurely<br />
terminated. The whole suggestion is wrong -it is preposterous.<br />
It is in the same category as the allegation made in the<br />
Parliament by Mr Steele Hall with the support of Mr Peacock<br />
that Mr Barron of my staff had attempted to have suppressed<br />
stories in the Age. This totally untrue and'scurrilous<br />
concoction of these desperate men was destroyed by the editor<br />
of the Age, Mr Burns.<br />
Let me emphasise this particular point. Mr Costigan's correspondence<br />
specifically refers to my suggestion to him that he should<br />
particularly concentrate in the time available to him upon that<br />
aspect of organised crime involving the drugs trade. He<br />
expressed his unqualified agreement for r1 believe he shares<br />
my view that this is an abomination and a threat to the stability<br />
of our society. It is one subject in respect of which I have -to<br />
fight to retain my rationality when contemplating what should be<br />
done to those who endanger the lives, particularly of our young,<br />
by profitting in this trade. I find it impossible to convey<br />
the revulsion I feel at the allegation that I would seek<br />
in any way to inhibit the identification and bringing to<br />
justice of anyone, whatever their station in life, so involved.<br />
Mr Peacock also attempts to blame me for leaked information<br />
such as that which appeared in the National Times last week.<br />
I must agree with Mr Peacock that the publication of this<br />
information was harmful and may well prejudice investigations.<br />
But it is Mr Peacock who has had access to leaked information,<br />
and indeed who has encouraged and incited the leaking of material<br />
by the use he has made of it, who is in a position if he </p>
<p>wishes to remind those responsible of their obligations to protect<br />
confidential information.<br />
The spurious allegations made by Mr p -acock about material not having<br />
been tabled have already been answered, As I said in Parliament<br />
on September 6:<br />
' at is the wish of the Government to sdean effective<br />
transition from the proceedings and processes of the Costigan<br />
Royal Commission to the National Crime Authority. It is clear<br />
that Mr Costigan and the National Crime Authority have a<br />
different view on the adequacy of the transition<br />
arrangements. While Mr Costigan appears to believe<br />
that there will be problems with the transition, the<br />
National Crime Authority has advised that its members<br />
' disagree' unanimously with Mr Costigan's assessment<br />
of the situation. Clearly this is a matter between<br />
Mr Costigan and the National Crime Authority.<br />
I am pleased to say that to assist the House I will<br />
table later this da y the full correspondence from<br />
Mr Costigan and the National Crime Authority on this matter." </p>
<p>I tabled exactly what I undertook to table. Again Mr Peacock<br />
engaged in misrepresentations by suggesting I had not tabled<br />
all correspondence. I dealt with this explicitly in the<br />
Parliament on the 10th September when I said:<br />
" On 7 September the Leader of the Opposition read<br />
out a list giving the dates of other correspondence<br />
between Mr Costigan and me. As he indicated, these<br />
letters were not included among those tabled on<br />
Thursday. A cursory inspection of the dates involved<br />
would have shown that they all dated back to at least<br />
March, and in a number of cases to 1983. These<br />
letters cover a period well before the transition<br />
commenced, and well before the National Crime<br />
Authority had come into existence. Indeed, the date<br />
of the first letter mentioned by Mr Peacock showed it<br />
was written four days after this Government was sworn<br />
into office. I at no stage indicated that I was<br />
purporting to table related correspondence with<br />
Mr Costigan extending back to the commencement of my<br />
Government. Nor was this sought by the Opposition<br />
prior to the tabling. Eut, to make it crystal<br />
clear that this Government has nothing to hide in<br />
this matter, that is what I have just done."<br />
By our-willingness to table material we have clearly shown we<br />
have nothing to hide. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Mr Peacock's comments on the transition show that he fails to<br />
recognise that the Costigan Royal Commission and the National<br />
Crime Authority have independent status based on statute.<br />
When certain problems emerged during the transition period,<br />
the Government made clear its firm wish that the transition<br />
be effective and that the necessary liaison take place for this<br />
to occur. Discussions were held with botWI Mr Justice Stewart </p>
<p>and Mr Costigan. But it would have been wrong and improper<br />
for the Government to seek to intervene and to purport to issue<br />
instructions to these independent bodies. For Mr Peacock to<br />
suggest that this should have been done shows how little he<br />
appreciates the position and nature of either organisation.<br />
On 6 September I met with the Chairman, Mr ' Justice Stewart,<br />
Mr Max Bingham, QC, * and. Mr John Dwyer, QC,* of the National<br />
Crimes Authority, all of whom command the highest possible<br />
respect in the community. It should be noted Mr Bingham and Mr<br />
Dwyer were unanimously endorsed appointments by the Federal<br />
Government, all State Governments and the Northern Territory.<br />
I asked Mr Justice Stewart, with<br />
all his experience in fighting organised crime, whether there<br />
was any further assistance the Authority required from the<br />
Government in its fight against organised crime. He<br />
replied there was not. I asked Mr Justice Stewart whether he<br />
was confident the Authority would be effective in fighting<br />
organised crime. He replied that he was. In my discussions<br />
with the members of the Authority I have emphasised that<br />
the Government expects the Authority to investigate vigorously<br />
all matters of substance concerning organised crime without<br />
fear or favour and let the cards fall as they may. This is<br />
the policy of the National Crimes Authority. By his statement<br />
Mr Peacock has impugned the integrity of its members. </p>
<p>On the subject of the transition, the Authority has indicated<br />
to me that it expects that among the resources it will have<br />
available to it at the termination of the Costigan Commission<br />
will be: Sthe computer data base and system;<br />
the analyses prepared by Commission staff;<br />
Sthe material contained in the Commission's reports;<br />
one of the junior Counsel assisting Mr Costigan;<br />
Sthe team of solicitors who have been engaged in<br />
conducting Mr Costigan's operations;<br />
Saccountants who have been involved in Mr Costigan's<br />
operations; and<br />
analysts, collators and other staff said by Mr Costigan<br />
to have been trained for the Authority.<br />
The Authority's access to these resources is presently limited<br />
by Mr Costigan's proper requirements for writing his report;<br />
but once that task is completed and the Authority has full use<br />
of the transferred staff and materials from Mr Costigan's<br />
Commission the Authority is confident that its work will proceed<br />
satisfactorily.<br />
Mr Peacock makes some statements about The Age tapes. The<br />
Government appointed the Director of Public Prosecutions,<br />
Mr Ian Temby QC, to inquire into this material. It was Mr Temby<br />
who recommended, after he had concluded his inquiries, that the<br />
matter be left as it is until Mr Justice Stewart and the Senate<br />
Committee have completed their relevant inquiries. This </p>
<p>.11.<br />
recommendation has been accepted by the Government. If<br />
Mr Peacock condemns this decision he condemns the<br />
recommendation of the Director of Public Prosecutions.<br />
Mr Peacock's latest statement is the action of a desperate mani.<br />
He has been unable to make any effective criticisms of the<br />
Government's economic policies. He is feduced to mud-slinging<br />
and misrepresentation in a sordid attempt to get political<br />
mileage out of the organised crime issue. The fact is that the<br />
Government's actions in supporting the fight against<br />
organised crime have been responsible and realistic and will<br />
stand up to any fair inspection.<br />
Mr Peacock has made specific, scurrilous allegations against me.<br />
The virtually universal reaction within the community has been<br />
that he has demeaned himself, his office and his Party. The<br />
judgement has been that unless he backs up his allegations wiLth<br />
hard and relevant facts his position will be irretrievable.<br />
This he has totally failed to do. And this has been<br />
inevitable because the allegations are entirely without<br />
substance. </p>
