    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen. I have called this news conference this afternoon</p>
<p> to announce that the Government has decided to provide assistance</p>
<p> to Australian exporters. And therefore to support Australian jobs</p>
<p> in relation to Australia's export trade with Indonesia.</p>
<p>We will provide, on the basis of a case-by-case analysis in relation</p>
<p> to the whole gamut of Australia's export trade with Indonesia,</p>
<p> short-term insurance on a national interest account for Australian</p>
<p> exporters to Indonesia through EFIC.</p>
<p>This plan, which will provide direct support to Australian exporters</p>
<p> and therefore Australian jobs, is in the context of an export trade</p>
<p> that Australia has with Indonesia of over $3 billion a year. It will,</p>
<p> as I mentioned, be on a case-by-case basis of all the alternatives</p>
<p> that were in front of the Government. Doing it on a case-by-case basis</p>
<p> is the best way of ensuring that the support is delivered on a proper</p>
<p> basis to Australian exporters and therefore is of benefit to Australian</p>
<p> employees and to Australian jobs.</p>
<p>I want to stress that it is in the context of a very important trade</p>
<p> that we have with Indonesia. And at a time like this, when our exporters</p>
<p> are facing fierce, even on occasions actively avaricious competition</p>
<p> from United States exporters into Indonesia who are not being shy</p>
<p> in the export methods being employed in order to gain access to the</p>
<p> Indonesian market. It is very important that my Government and that</p>
<p> Australia stands up for the interest of Australian exporters, and</p>
<p> therefore of Australian jobs. And that is the basis upon which the</p>
<p> decision has been taken.</p>
<p>The other matters that I want to mention in the context of Indonesia</p>
<p> and economic developments in Asia generally, are that the Government</p>
<p> is taking a number of other measures to support exporters. And these</p>
<p> include a series of Âexporter summits' to be convened on</p>
<p> a group-by-group basis by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for</p>
<p> Trade, Mr Fischer. And these are all designed to maximise, where appropriate,</p>
<p> cooperation and activity to maximise Australian interests in the various</p>
<p> commodity and other export sectors.</p>
<p>We are going to consult Indonesian officials to finalise these arrangements.</p>
<p> And I would stress that further details about the arrangements concerning</p>
<p> the export insurance and guarantees can be obtained through EFIC.</p>
<p> It is part of the on-going and active response of the Government to</p>
<p> what is occurring, not only in Indonesia but also in the Asian area</p>
<p> generally. The domestic economic measures the Government has taken</p>
<p> has provided us with immense protection against the worst effects</p>
<p> of what has happened in Asia but it is also necessary in the context</p>
<p> of that response for us on a case-by-case basis to look to the needs</p>
<p> of our exporters and of the Australians that they employ.</p>
<p>I will be happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is there any diplomatic or trade measures that Australia</p>
<p> can take to counter what you called the avaricious credit schemes</p>
<p> offered by the United States?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, there are and a number of those are under consideration. I don't</p>
<p> want to overdramatise that but we are concerned that there is evidence</p>
<p> that some United States activity is designed to take advantage of</p>
<p> the situation and I certainly won't be silent, nor will my Government</p>
<p> be silent in saying what needs to be said in order to counteract that</p>
<p> because we are there to defend the interests of Australians and Australians</p>
<p> alone, and it's very necessary against that backdrop and in the</p>
<p> context of our very large trade with Indonesia for us to take the</p>
<p> action that I have announced this morning and that's not of course</p>
<p> the end of the matter. There are other steps that one can take to</p>
<p> express our concerns and they are under consideration.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What funds have you made available?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What funds have you allocated to this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This is going to be done on a case-by-case basis, Paul. We haven't</p>
<p> put a cap on it but obviously, we will look at each individual proposal</p>
<p> and that's the most intelligent way of doing it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what about other nations in the region? Will you be looking</p>
<p> at the same sort of system for other places?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We've already taken action to help our exporters into Korea and</p>
<p> this, in a sense, is in the same genre.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you contacted the Indonesians yourself in relation to this decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that would be done through the normal channels. You should bear</p>
<p> in mind that when Mr Downer was in Jakarta a number of issues were</p>
<p> discussed, and this was one of them but of course this is help for</p>
<p> Australians, and Australian jobs and that is a very, very important</p>
<p> thing to bear in mind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there anything that the Government can do through the WTO?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In relation to what?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>To the US credit scheme.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are gathering material about what is happening. Let me put</p>
<p> it that way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have evidence that Australian jobs have already been lost through</p>
<p> the problems in Indonesia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't have any hard evidence of that but it is at a stage,</p>
<p> Andrew, where we are gathering information and I don't want to</p>
<p> say anything that would preclude a different answer, when we have</p>
<p> gathered that information.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister has the Indonesian Government provided any guarantees?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, they will, a condition of it will be a sovereign guarantee. Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, are you worried about the way the Americans are approaching</p>
<p> this, particularly with farm exports? Mr Anderson said yesterday they</p>
<p> appeared to be offering credit on terms outside IMF arrangements to</p>
<p> get business.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Anything that unfairly prejudices Australian interests or Australian</p>
<p> exporters or Australian jobs worries me and I will, of course, see</p>
<p> that everything that can reasonably be done in that area will be done.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how can you justify allowing a conscience vote on</p>
<p> a matter to do with the structure of government. Is there any precedent</p>
<p> for that, that you are aware of?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think there is any precedent for this whole debate. So</p>
<p> we're writing the rule book afresh, with a clean page. I don't</p>
<p> think there is any precedent you can draw and I think the talk about</p>
<p> precedent, in the context of this debate, is a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But these are highly unusual matters to allow a conscience vote...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have never had a debate like this before. I don't think</p>
<p> this is highly unusual at all. I think it is common sense.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST</p>
<p>Is it likely to happen more often on issues fundamental to government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think we will have another constitutional debate like</p>
<p> this while I am still around. So your successor can ask my successor</p>
<p> in the year 2100 and something-or-other, about it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Which model now, do you think, is likely to succeed, now that we know...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have never disguised my own views about a direct election.</p>
<p> As to what will ultimately get up, I think we will have to wait and</p>
<p> see.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think the McGarvie model is...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I think it is too early. I mean everybody wanted to discuss</p>
<p> this and they wanted to have a free, open debate and I....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did Bill Hayden's intervention today suprise you? He seems now</p>
<p> to think that unless a direct election comes up the people won't</p>
<p> wear it and they have got every right not to.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In his intervention yesterday?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Oh well, no. He called a news conference today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sorry I haven't caught up with that. I have been working for</p>
<p> the Australian people this morning on other matters.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you campaign one way or the other during a referendum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, don't press me on what I am going to do at a referendum</p>
<p> after the next election, when we are only three days into the convention,</p>
<p> which has got another seven or eight days to go. Break it down Dennis.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, do you have any views on Professor Geoffrey Blainey's</p>
<p> attack on Sir William Deane this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't seen the speech.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the retail trade data was released today, did you</p>
<p> get a chance to look at that and what does that mean to the Australian</p>
<p> economy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the economy will survive, survive the figures. I think</p>
<p> you have to look at the totality of the economic statistics. I think</p>
<p> the totality is that we have very strong domestic growth and that</p>
<p> even in the strongest of economic circumstances you will get figures</p>
<p> that are sometimes going this way or sometimes going that way. But,</p>
<p> if you look at the broad sweep - if I can put it that way - of what</p>
<p> has happened to the Australian economy over the last six months, you</p>
<p> see a steady, inexorable strengthening of the foundations of the Australian</p>
<p> economy and an economy that is standing up very well to the turmoil</p>
<p> that is occurring in our part of the world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] falling retail trade indicate that demand isn't as</p>
<p> strong as we thought before?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You know from time immemorial, Treasurers, Prime Ministers, Opposition</p>
<p> Leaders and Shadow spokesmen, when they are sensible, have said that</p>
<p> you shouldn't read too much into one month's figures.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the Hindmarsh Island case is back in the courts tomorrow,</p>
<p> do you regard this as another unnecessary delay in what has already</p>
<p> been a fairly lengthy saga?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it is appropriate for the Prime Minister to talk</p>
<p> about delays and so forth in the context of the hearing by the High</p>
<p> Court. I respect the role of the court in our system and I certainly</p>
<p> don't intend to make any comment. I think it would be quite wrong</p>
<p> of me to make any comment about this issue on the eve of it being</p>
<p> heard by Their Honours.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Ombudsman has released a report very critical</p>
<p> of the process by which the Government was provided modelling on which</p>
<p> it based its position at the Kyoto greenhouse conference. Is it appropriate</p>
<p> for member bodies of ABARE to be charged $50,000 to sit on steering</p>
<p> committees.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm having that report looked at and until I've had an analysis</p>
<p> of it, I'm not going to comment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what's your view of Tony Abbott's change</p>
<p> of heart?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What's my view of Tony Abbott's change of heart? Well, you</p>
<p> should ask Tony Abbott. I thought you people would love the idea of</p>
<p> a free or open vote. I thought that was one of the holy grails of</p>
<p> Australian journalism to see political parties having free and open</p>
<p> votes and consciences blooming and being liberated on a whole miscellany</p>
<p> of things. And here I do it and, what, can't you handle it?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is the Government looking at measures...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the Government looking at measures for other Asian countries like</p>
<p> the assistance...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The answer is that you have to deal on a case-by-case merit of the</p>
<p> situation, merits of the proposition approach. I can't answer</p>
<p> that in any other way because it's not something you can have</p>
<p> a blanket policy for. That is not sensible. We are concerned to protect</p>
<p> and defend the interests of Australian exporters and Australian jobs.</p>
<p> That's our first concern. We also have a sense of understanding</p>
<p> and an empathy with our friends and neighbours in the region who are</p>
<p> suffering a great deal from this economic downturn and we want to</p>
<p> help where we can, consistent with our own interests and with our</p>
<p> capacity. And if you look at what Australia has done over the last</p>
<p> three or four months, Australia has been a splendid regional citizen.</p>
<p> A splendid regional citizen. We've also quite properly looked</p>
<p> to the interests of Australian workers and Australian exporters and</p>
<p> they're the principles that we'll continue to apply to what</p>
<p> we do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Going back to Mr Hayden. His view a few hours ago was that the Convention</p>
<p> is degenerating into a fiasco. How do you see the Convention going</p>
<p> so far?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's been rather good so far and I've enjoyed it.</p>
<p> I thought the gathering on Monday, I thought the social gathering</p>
<p> on Monday night, both were splendid occasions. There was a sense of</p>
<p> cooperation, a sense of commitment to Australia, a desire on the part</p>
<p> of people, no matter what their diversities might be, to work together</p>
<p> for the betterment of our country. I believe people have come together</p>
<p> in a good spirit. And I've found in my own exchanges with people,</p>
<p> even those of the delegates who are the proverbial country mile away</p>
<p> from me on just about every issue, have been very civil.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Not a fiasco then.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you approve of Mr Corrigan's not telling the truth on the</p>
<p> involvement of Patrick and Dubai?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm a Prime Minister. I don't give a running commentary</p>
<p> on every corporate citizen of Australia. But if you want to go ask</p>
<p> Mr Corrigan something about Mr Corrigan, you go ahead and do so.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think it's helpful for the waterfront...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think what is helpful is to remember what is at stake here.</p>
<p> And that is whether we're going to create more jobs and boost</p>
<p> exports by fixing up the waterfront. And everything else, as far as</p>
<p> I'm concerned, is a sideshow and irrelevance. And let me say</p>
<p> again on behalf of my Government, we changed the law to enable people</p>
<p> to provide more competition on the waterfront. We did that deliberately</p>
<p> because we believe it's in the interests of Australian jobs and</p>
<p> Australian exporters. And I will applaud and my Government will support</p>
<p> in the appropriate way anybody who is prepared to provide more competition</p>
<p> on the waterfront, provided at all times people act in accordance</p>
<p> with the law. I mean, that's our position. Everything else is</p>
<p> irrelevant. It's a sideshow. It's of no account. The only</p>
<p> thing that matters is promoting Australian jobs and the Australian</p>
<p> economy by fixing the chronic inefficiency of the Australian waterfront.</p>
<p> And the overwhelming bulk of Australians want that to happen. And</p>
<p> those who stand in the way of progress, those who look back to a bygone</p>
<p> era that is crumbling in front of their eyes are out of touch with</p>
<p> the overwhelming sentiment in the Australian community.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how do you reconcile that with the Government's</p>
<p> strong support for the other three monopolies on the waterfront -</p>
<p> the wheat, barley and sugar marketing monopolies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's a world of difference.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Should Mark Waugh have walked?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Now I will allow an extra question. When you actually look at the</p>
<p> video, the replay, and you look at the rules, I think the decision</p>
<p> taken by the third umpire was right. He clearly was not playing a</p>
<p> stroke. Clearly wasn't. I mean, it did sort of flop and I thought</p>
<p> his explanation was eminently plausible. And if you look at it, he</p>
<p> wasn't playing a shot and the rules are very clear. I can understand,</p>
<p> I suppose, with the excitement and the adrenalin, how the South Africans</p>
<p> reacted and I think they have been splendid sportsmen. They really</p>
<p> have been. They're a terrific group of people and it has been</p>
<p> a great contest. And I hope that the next time Australia meets South</p>
<p> Africa there are five Tests. I want a five Test series between Australia</p>
<p> and South Africa next time around.</p>
<p>So the short answer is, no. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
