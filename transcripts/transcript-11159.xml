<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, could I get a quick word on Sir John Gorton as we</p>
<p> go into this evening?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm delighted that the Liberal Party tonight will honour his</p>
<p> service to the Australian people and to the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What sort of Prime Minister was he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He was a passionately nationalistic Prime Minister. He brought a style</p>
<p> and flair that was different. He was one of the people who earlier</p>
<p> than most understood the power of communication on television. And</p>
<p> he was unconventional in some ways and he's proud of that but</p>
<p> he always had a very clear view as to what the Australian national</p>
<p> interests was and he always put the national interest ahead of provincial</p>
<p> or sectional interest. And there's an instruction in that for</p>
<p> all Australian Prime ministers.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A true Liberal.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Everybody has their own definition of what that is. His view</p>
<p> of liberalism and mine, we converge on some issues and diverge on</p>
<p> others but that's the nature of a broad church. We find that</p>
<p> in any political party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And I suppose, well, you'll welcome him back to the fold after</p>
<p> some years where perhaps he was in some sort of exile anyway.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn't use that word. He's been a great Australian.</p>
<p> He served Australia courageously in war time and paid very dearly</p>
<p> during war. And he is Australia's oldest living ex-Prime Minister</p>
<p> and we're delighted that he's with us tonight and I'm</p>
<p> delighted to, as the 25th Prime Minister of Australia,</p>
<p> to have the opportunity of honouring the 19th Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia, the first Senator to become Prime Minister of Australia</p>
<p> Â it's a long time ago now Â 1968 to 1971. It will</p>
<p> be a very nice thing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And something the Liberal Party would like to do more of, celebrate</p>
<p> its former leaders perhaps, like the Labor Party is legendary for</p>
<p> doing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we're not into copying anything the Labor Party does. We're</p>
<p> doing this because it ought to be done and people want it to happen.</p>
<p> I suggested it to the Party two weeks ago and they took up the suggestion</p>
<p> very enthusiastically and we are very happy that John and Nancy are</p>
<p> with us tonight.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
