ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINI3TER TO THE CITIZENS<br />
CLUB DINNER, SYDNEY, MAY 13, 1971<br />
Tonight I hope you will permit me to speak about where<br />
we are going and what Initiatives we are taking in novel areas of<br />
international affairs that up until a few years ago we had riot been<br />
concerned with. By that I mean our diplomatic international<br />
relationships with Japan and the emerging world powers immediately<br />
to the North. That is with the two Communist countries Soviet<br />
Russia and the People's Republic of China that is Mainland China?<br />
I do this because in each case I want to speak to you<br />
about the dates on which the initiatives were first taken beginning<br />
in April 1970. Before I get into the body of my speech I want too<br />
purely for the purposes of identifying the dates to mention the<br />
dates on which subsequent initiatives were taken.<br />
In May 1970, we were looking at papers, position<br />
papers and documents that were subsequently presented to the<br />
Ministry, relating to a new approach to Japan. In March of this<br />
year, we considered papers relating to China, that is, the<br />
People's Republic of China Mainland China. Every single phrase<br />
that has been used lately, and that I will use tonight, have beer.<br />
taken out of those basic documents.<br />
And finally, we had in April of this year a paper<br />
relating to our relationships with the U. S. S. R.<br />
I mention these dates purely to point out to you that the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs has been doing this work and that<br />
we haven't, as it~ were, been forced by ping pong diplomacy to take<br />
the kind of action recently taken.<br />
I had the great pleasure in every one of these cases to<br />
initiate the yolicies that I will mention to you.<br />
If anything is to be gained or, behalf of the Commonwealth<br />
Government, I car. assure you that each and every one of the<br />
proposals has received the full endorsement of Cabinet, and of the<br />
Ministry. Whilst I am going to speak about, Japan, the U. S. S. R.<br />
and the People's Republic, I don't want you to think that I am<br />
forgetting our great permanent and powerful friends in the United<br />
States, and in the Uniited Kingdom. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The United Kingdom is still using its benign influence<br />
for good in South-East Asi!, and has joined with us in the post<br />
Anglo-Malaysian defence agreements. And the United States,<br />
of course, has been the most powerful influence for good and<br />
for the salvation of the free world since World Wat 11. And it will<br />
still be expected to play this role.<br />
Tonight, I want to speak to you about both our bilateral<br />
and multilateral relationships with the countries I have mentioned.<br />
By bilateral I mean our direct relationships,<br />
diplomatic and other relationships between two countries without the<br />
intervention of thi-rd And by " n ,... ti-lateral" relationships,<br />
I mean those relarionshi=~ between oursel'es and a dozen and one<br />
other countries as, for exa le, in the Un'ited Nations and the<br />
Asian Development Bank anr. similar types of institutions. Over and<br />
over again, you will hear me use the wo.: ds bilateral and<br />
" multilateral" and I make his very brie explanation so that you<br />
won't be kept in the dark about exactly what I mean.<br />
Now I want you, too, to understand that we are a great<br />
trading nation. We are, per head of po:,-' ation, as great as any other<br />
country. But we also have to remember that besides the interest we<br />
have in trade, we have other international relationships as well. We<br />
want to achieve poe-tical s-. ltbility in the area in which we live, to help<br />
others in the ecoc-mic de. rel. opmen: t of thi. r countries and the overriding<br />
objective we have in international affairs that ie to play our<br />
part to the maximum of oUl. capacity to ensure that the people of<br />
the future the young chil'e-n of today and those who will come after<br />
us will have a better opprranity to live under more peaceful conditions<br />
than you and I have beer, able to live ir..<br />
So this, then, is the basis on which I want to speak to you<br />
tonight. May I then turnto Japai. the paper that was presented<br />
in May of last year.<br />
Japan is one of our great trading partners. h fact, in<br />
terms of total trade, it is ahe greatest tr-. ading partner we have. Our<br />
exports to Japan top the liht. She is by far and away the greatest<br />
importer of what we produce. In terms of imports, she runs third<br />
only to the United States, and in terms of total trade she is second<br />
only to the United States.<br />
It was for this reason, more than for any other, that I<br />
started the discussions ir; the Department of External Affairs, ea'rly im May<br />
.1973. I the: n established with the approval of -the then Prime Minister,<br />
r. G3orton, the strongest inter--de'artmental Committee that we could<br />
establish in order-to con sictently look at our policies and to ask ourselves<br />
Can we improve themn' Can we improve them for the. benefit of our own people? </p>
<p>This worked very well, . and you people will kn~ ow that<br />
we have i-ow established rnot only trade, but in other kinds of<br />
relationships, the most close relationships with Japan.<br />
What then of the future?<br />
Let me mention that in teni years' time, Japaii will be<br />
unmistakeably the second most powerful productive country in the<br />
world. And because our two economics are complementary and there<br />
is an enormous degree of complemerntarity between the kinds of<br />
goods they want and we are able to sell to them, arid the kinds of<br />
goods they have and are able to sell to us, that our future trade<br />
relationships with Japan offer enormous opportunities for us.<br />
It is axiomatic that the greater your trade, and the greater the<br />
amount of foreign exchange you can earn, then the greater the<br />
prospects you have got for productivity increases arid also for better<br />
standards of living of our own people.<br />
So we have this complementarity, and as I have said,<br />
as Japan grows, then it is axiomatic that we will grow too.<br />
I also want to mention other factors associated with<br />
this period as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Japan started to change<br />
its low posture to an exercise of a kind of global influence that a<br />
country of its power should start to exercise. At the Djakarta<br />
conferences, Japan for the first time took an initiative in order to<br />
help to try and achieve peace in Cambodia along the lines of the<br />
Geneva Conventions an-d Protocol of 1954.<br />
I believe that Japan is moving definitely, precisely, calmly,<br />
but still with a low posture, to play its part in trying to achievepolitical<br />
stability in South East Asia.<br />
But it is not of Japan that I wanted to speak to you tonight.<br />
It is rather of the U. S. S. R. and of the People's Republic of China and<br />
of China I want to speak at considerable length.<br />
When I speak of these two countries, I want to remind you<br />
of certain assumptions and of certain principles that flow from them.<br />
The first one is that we must recognise that both of these<br />
countries have different political and social systems to ours. Both<br />
of them base their foreign relations on different basic ideologies.<br />
Theirs is a philosophy of centralised government, of a political<br />
system that depends on the Party as the dominant element in<br />
potlcal life the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. They concentrate<br />
on the Party itself. It is the political organisation which determines<br />
not only their internal but their external relationships as well. </p>
<p>A<br />
We, on the other hand, believe in representative<br />
government, We believe that it is the people who are sovereign,<br />
it is they who support a Party, and through the Party determine<br />
who will represent the people in the National Parliament itself.<br />
I want you to understand that whenever we are thinking<br />
of trade between a communist country and ourselves, we must<br />
remember the differences particularly that we have a free press and<br />
freedom of expression, while theirs is controlled and their people<br />
know little or nothing about what the real objectives of the<br />
government might be.<br />
This is tremendously important under present<br />
circumstances, because if I can use Rob Askin's phrase of ping<br />
pong diplomacy, let us remember that we are not going to gain a<br />
great deal out of ping pong diplomacy.<br />
We have to look much further and ask ourselves when we are<br />
engaged in dealings with them What are we likely to gain out of it<br />
in the long term, in the medium term and in the short term as well?<br />
And on every occasion when we are making a decision,<br />
we must, as all businessmen must, prepare a profit and loss account.<br />
Ar. d we must always, when we are adding up the sums, ask<br />
ourselves the single question. When we look at the total final figures<br />
are we sure that they will be in the black and to the advantage of this<br />
country. Having said that, I mertion two other principles associated<br />
with it. I want you to realise that when we are dealing in either<br />
bilateral of multilateral relations with other countries that we must<br />
not think that because they have different political systems to ours<br />
that that fact alone should prevent us from entering into negotiations<br />
with them. That is far from the truth. The mere fact that they happen<br />
to be socialist or communist is not in itself sufficient reason<br />
to prevent us from entering into negotiations with them.<br />
And the second principle that I want you to realise is that<br />
even though you recognise international law, that<br />
recognition does not mean that you approve of the policies of the<br />
government recognised. It merely means that you look at the facts<br />
of life objectively, pragmatically, coolly and calmly and thin ask yourself<br />
the simple question if we take a certain course of action, what<br />
advantage has it for the Australian people and the Australian nation? </p>
<p>This brings me to the text country I want to speak about<br />
at this dinner tonight Soviet Russia.<br />
I don't have to draw distinctions in this case between<br />
multilateral and bilateral negotiations because they are in fact a<br />
member of the United Nations and they have diplomatic relations<br />
with us. They have their Ambassador and Embassy here. We have<br />
our Ambassador and Embassy in Moscow. So I don't want to<br />
speak to youabout that. What I wa-t to speak to you about is this:<br />
The Soviet, has in recent months, been saying they would<br />
like better relationships with us. They have been asking us if we would<br />
give some earnest of our willingness and of our ability to improve our<br />
relationships. To indicate to them in reply * hat we would like. They<br />
would like to be. able to ensLure that they had bdtjter trade opportunities<br />
with us too. In recent weeks we have been able as a government to show<br />
the Government of the U. S. S. R. that we were prepared to make certain<br />
concessions to them as an earnest of our intention. We have decided<br />
and we have communicated this to the Soviet Government the<br />
concessions we are willing to make. We will be delivering an aide<br />
memoire setting out the details. The terms and conditions under which<br />
the concessions will be made will be communicated to them in the next<br />
few days. We have agreed at their request, that we will permit the Soviet<br />
to establish a trade office in New South Wales I mention this<br />
specifically Mr. Askin, not because i am a Sydneian, but because it<br />
happens to be the place chosen by them. Primarily this office will be<br />
for the purpose of commerce and trade, of trying to increase commerce<br />
and trade between the two countries. I hope, looking at the balance sheet<br />
it will be of advantage to us.<br />
Secondly, because Russia has recently joined the Continental<br />
Shipping Conference they asked that they would like the Biltic Shipping<br />
Company to establish an office in Sydney. We think this will give us<br />
access toport to the South of China, but also. Anian Russia and the<br />
opportur. ity tc be able to sell our goods and services there.<br />
Thirdly, they have asked us, if we could agree to visits by<br />
Ministers. That has already occurred.<br />
Their Minister for Agriculture, a member of the Central<br />
Committee of the Communist Party, has visited Australia Sir John<br />
McEwen has visited Russia.<br />
They have also proposed, and we have agreed, that there<br />
shouldi* ae missions, or delegations of Parliamentary Members tc move from<br />
one country to the other. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
This, I believe, shows our good will and the fact that we<br />
want under the conditions that I have mentioned to show an earinest of<br />
our intentions despite the fact that we know they are building up their<br />
forces in the Middle East, beyond what is necessary for perce-keeping<br />
purposes there. They are suspect in some regards, and we are entitled<br />
to be sceptical. Nonetheless they took the initiative and we have<br />
responded. From . now on, at least the ball will be in their court, At<br />
least we can say this that so far as Australia is concerned: They have<br />
indicated clearly to us that their recent decision to purchase millions of<br />
pounds of Australian beef was based on their desire for good relations<br />
with us. That is our position with regard to the U. S. S. R. I now turn<br />
to the part of my speech that I want to emphasise tonight.<br />
I want to emphasise to you that every phrase I use was coined<br />
some time ago and certainly a long time before the ping pong diplomacy<br />
was invented and practised under the skilled guidance of Mr. Chou En-lai.<br />
The China Paper was prepared in February of this year. Let me talk<br />
about the People's Republic of China and let us look at our relations in<br />
both a multilateral and a bilateral way.<br />
In multilateral terms. We believe they are anxious to -become a<br />
member of the United Nations. The suggestion has made from time to<br />
time that China wants to adopt a global approach. They are entitled to do<br />
so as a great power. Consequently, those who have watched the U: nited<br />
Nations have been asking themselves the simple question What do we<br />
think are the prospects of the People's Republic becoming a member of<br />
the United Nations in the course of the next year or two?<br />
I want to say to you clearly a;-d emphatically that there is<br />
little doubt at all, in fact it is almost certain that this year or next year,<br />
Mainland China will become pcrticularly if it makes certain concessions<br />
a member of the United Nations and will hold the permanent seat in<br />
the Security Council that is now held by Taiwan China.<br />
In the face of this inevitability, we will do nothing to obstruct<br />
it. We do so against this background.<br />
The Government in Peking is the defacto government and is<br />
responsible for 700 million people. It controls the land mass of<br />
Mainland China. So too does the Government of Taiwan China excercise<br />
power and control over 141 millior people And over the territory,<br />
that is comprised within the jurisdiction and central writ of the<br />
Government of Taiwan. It is our view, therefore, that as the government<br />
of Taiwan has lived up to the principles of the United Nations we should<br />
assist it to remain a member. We are trying with all the influence we can<br />
to sustain the position of Taiwan, and give it the opportunity to remain<br />
in the United Nations should it, in its own wisdom wish to remain there. </p>
<p>. So that then is roughly our position on a multilateral basis, so far as the<br />
People's Republic of China and the Government of Taiwan are concerned.<br />
I now want to turn to our bilateral relations with Mainland China.<br />
And I want to state our reservations.<br />
I want to express those reservations coolly, and not stridently. When you<br />
are making a diplomatic approach of the kind I will mention the less strident your<br />
approach, the better your prospects of success will probably be.<br />
I don't want you to think that there have been any great changes so far as<br />
Mainland China is concerned. They are masters of tactics. They control the news<br />
media there and they can more or less do what they want to do without great trouble<br />
from the domestic population.<br />
We in all our dealings must remember the domestic population exercises<br />
a powerful influence on what we do. No democratic government ought to get too far out<br />
of line with the trends of thought of the people of their country.<br />
I remind you of an incident that occurred in 1969, not very long before the<br />
last Federal elections. One phrase in a very well-presented and prepared speech<br />
by one of the most cautious diplomats we have in Australia's foreign service a phrase<br />
relating to the presence of the USSR Navy in the Indian Ocean caused a degree of<br />
controversy that every one of us would have preferred to have avoided. In other<br />
words, eight or nine words, caused difficulties and a tremendous amount of public<br />
disapproval. This is why we have moved with a great degree of care. We have not wished<br />
to move in a way that we felt would insult public opinion.<br />
I want you to understand, too, that the People's Republic of China, that is<br />
Mainland China, still proclaims in most of its public statements, and particularly in<br />
its latest May Day addresses, that it believes in revolution and believes in achieving<br />
its purposes by force. It is still bitterly critical of the United States and it uses the<br />
words " All its mad running dogs" that is those who co-operate with the USA in its<br />
desire to sustain the liberal democracies.<br />
In those circumstances, what policies have we adopted? We have decided<br />
that our long-term objective will be, I now use the phrase that was coined in the<br />
documents that I mentioned and was used before by my colleague, Mr. Bury, the<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs or if it wasn't by him, by the Acting Minister on his<br />
behalf. The words used set out our predetermined goal. That we want normal<br />
bilateral relations with the People's Republic of China.<br />
We want those relationships, but we have decided to proceed cautiously.<br />
Because as I have said, we must always be adding up the sums to see that the major<br />
advantages are with this country.<br />
We decided to take the first step towards a diplomatic detente and took<br />
the initiative to open up discussions with them. I used the phrase one day this<br />
week I think on Tuesday that we want a dialogue between the two countries. 0 0 / 8 </p>
<p>Initially we hope that we will be able to move in certain areas I will mention<br />
latdr. Before I mention these areas, I want to dispel certain doubts that have arisen<br />
about our attitude to Mainland China. I think there is so much misunderstanding<br />
about what our present relationships are that I ought to stop the rumours and let you<br />
know the facts so that you will be able to judge what the prospects for the future are.<br />
Our present attitude to Mainland China is pretty clear. There is no<br />
restriction whatsoever on the movement of Australian people to Mainland China,<br />
providing only that they can : get a visa from the Chinese and providing that security<br />
considerations are not involved. In other words, we don't stop our people going<br />
there and we ' don't stop their people coming here. We will give them visas on the<br />
conditions, or subject to the conditions that I have just mentioned.<br />
Secondly, but for several restrictive lists on trade, we do permit trade with<br />
Mainland China. Now at the Canton Fair, we have many, many Australians trying<br />
to fill their order books. And indeed they have met with success in many cases.<br />
Thirdly, our cultural activities. Not so long ago there was an approval for<br />
the Peking Opera Company to come here. Because the only theatre that was available<br />
for them had closed down, they were not able to come.<br />
I want now to illustrate the way misunderstandings are occurring. I want<br />
to mention the facts relating to wheat sales to Mainland China. They are these.<br />
Continental China has had nine good production seasons for wheat. They<br />
don't need to import any other than special varieties to mix with the wheat that they<br />
produce themselves. They have had very good rice production which they normally<br />
sell at a premium in order to buy the blending types of wheat that they need. Rice<br />
is now in abundance. Consequently we did not expect that we would be making large<br />
sales of wheat to them this year. As they have built up the stocks they have, they<br />
need only the blending varieties.<br />
Our position is therefore clear. Until a few weeks ago, our contracts for<br />
the sale of wheat in other countries were far greater than they have * ever been.<br />
We now think that we will have a carryover, which won't be a large one the present<br />
carryover from last year's crop is about 365 million bushels much less than<br />
200 million bushels. I believe it will be substantially lower than that.<br />
In the cour se of the last two or three days, we have negotiated a sale to<br />
the United Arab Republic of something like one million tons.<br />
It is argued that Peking China is playing politics with the purchase of<br />
Australian wheat. Not only do the facts deny it, but it wouldn't be a sensible sort<br />
of politics. Our sales are pretty good and our stocks will be pretty low and of the<br />
kind that we will need in the intermediate period between seasons.<br />
Now we are moving towards a dialogue. Shortly we will be taking the<br />
preliminary steps. We have already taken other action. see / 9 </p>
<p>% The present restrictive lists are now being analysed and liberalised. The<br />
only. restrictions that we will impose on trade and this will be of interest to every<br />
one of you businessmen are those invdving defence interests or where there are<br />
strategic Implications of a kind which our Department of Defence, Foreign Affairs<br />
Department and my own Ministry feel require restrictions.<br />
I want to remind you that China is a great and powerful country and is<br />
starting to indicate that she is interested in becoming a great world power. We feel<br />
that simply because it is Communist there is insufficient reason to prevent us<br />
improving our relations with her. Secondly, we have to recognise that China wants<br />
to exercise a world role and to be able to play a part in the future trend of world<br />
affairs. There is growing evidence that since the Cultural Revolution and the change<br />
in the power structure of the Peking hierarchy, particularly under the Premiership"<br />
of Chou En-Lal that they are searching for the opportunities to do so. It would be<br />
extremely foolish for any of us to think that this trend could be resisted because Mainland<br />
China is strong and determined. This is one of the reasons why we feel that a dialogue<br />
may be important to us.<br />
We want to probe their feelings. What they are thinking about the<br />
Western democracies. In our turn to be able to take some action to influence the<br />
decisions that they might make.<br />
We are now moving along a different track. I have mentioned trade to you.<br />
I now want to mention various other kinds of activities. The issue of visas, the<br />
protection of Australian personnel who are in Mainland China, cultural and other<br />
types of activities, particularly the arts.<br />
Shortly after I announced on Tuesday that we were attempting a dialogue<br />
the irrepressible Dr. Coombs was on the phone and asked me would I give him<br />
authority to negotiate with the Chinese to bring out ballet companies, opera companies<br />
and any other type of artistic team that he felt might be entertaining to the<br />
Australian people.<br />
We will be moving in these and other directions to try and see whether<br />
there is a basis on which we can have a rapport.<br />
And I want to say this clearly. We will be moving cautiously. Every single<br />
step will be weighed up before we take it. Every single step will be included in<br />
the balance sheet that I mentioned.<br />
We don't want to be pushed into taking action because somebody else has<br />
done so. I warn you that recognition or admission will not make a great deal of<br />
difference to Mainland China. Many countries have realised that even though they<br />
have recognised Mailn. China it hasn't meant that they . havj incioascd their trade.<br />
At least in the casc of two ccuntrics there has been a reduction, Th -re 1-wo riot been<br />
an increase in trade. The Chinese Govornmient hais lot th
aren't goad enough and-that political influcncco are not sufficient tc win them the kind<br />
of contracts that they could not win in competitive company. 1 </p>
<p>This is the attitude we'll take. We want to move. But we will only move<br />
if movement will be for the benefit of the Australian people and we do not prejudice<br />
our negotiating strength.<br />
That brings metherefore to the conclusion. In all our international<br />
relationships, we in the Foreign Off ice and in the Government and the Prime<br />
Minister's Department particularly, will be seeking to protect and enhance your<br />
interests as Australians. Not only our vital defence and security interests, but<br />
also our trade and our cultural relations.<br />
One of our objectives will be to provide aid and to participate in the<br />
economic development of the less developed countries of South East Asia.<br />
Everywhere I have gone over the period of the last two years as Foreign<br />
and External Minister, I have been delighted but' surprised to find that there was<br />
so much goodwill for us. In some international conferences, when a stalemate has<br />
occurred, some countries have come to us to find a solutioiu<br />
We are, I believe, a phenomenal country. Our aid programmes the money<br />
that comes out of the pockets ofc the Australian taixpayer are substantial. We are<br />
making a large contribution.<br />
I come back to where I started. Our objective must first of all be to<br />
protect and enhance our vital interests. And I use the phrase again we want political<br />
stability in the Pacific Basin. We also want economic development because we<br />
know it is a two-way traffic. As other countries develop so too will we. Above all<br />
we want peace and we want to make our contribution-to the hopes and aspirations<br />
of these people. If in time we achieve peace in Indo-China, Laos, Cambodia and<br />
South Viet-MNm the kiddies there will be able to look forward to a future just as<br />
bright as ours. </p>
