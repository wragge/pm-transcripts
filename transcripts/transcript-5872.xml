FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 24 JULY 1982<br />
COM~' MONWEALTH GAMES CHEQUE HANDOVER<br />
This is one of those happy functions, and it is the sort of<br />
function that politicians dream about. You have a cheque<br />
in your pocket all morning, &amp; id hope you don't lose it, and<br />
you know you are going to give it away to somebody at lunch<br />
time. It is in a good cause, and the Commonwealth has been supporting<br />
the Commonwealth Games quite strongly, and a few years ago<br />
now, webegana the business of providing additional support<br />
for the Commonwealth Games Federation or the Olympic Games<br />
Federation so that there could be adequate free training for<br />
the teams that were ultimately going to represent Australia.<br />
This was a policy that was introduced to our own athletes,<br />
a greater opportunity to compete on equal terms.<br />
What I am here for today is to hand over the last cheque<br />
to Mr Les Martyn. from the Commonwealth of $ 155,000 as the<br />
final payment of about $ 455,000 for the pre-Games preparation"<br />
and out-fitting of the Australian team.<br />
Overall thE! Commonwealth contribution and of course, the<br />
Queensland contribution has been substantial, very nearly<br />
million. I toured the facilities with the Chairman<br />
of the organising committee, Ned Williams, last week, and<br />
the Games facilities I believe, are going to be as good as<br />
any in the world. They have been constructed with the<br />
highest possible standards, the new swimming pool is a<br />
marvel for people who were used to the swimming pools of<br />
older days. We are looking to see Commonwealth Games'<br />
records broken and there will be over 40 countries represented.<br />
It has all be played on a low-key basis up to this stage,<br />
because there were talks of boycotts and all sorts of things,<br />
which nobody really wanted to hear much about, but that was<br />
resolved in a meeting in May and there will be a tremendous<br />
representation at the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane.<br />
it is also going to be the first significant test of the<br />
AustralianL Institute of Sport Which has been operating now for<br />
the best part of two years,. offering the most modern training<br />
techniques. A combination of that with full knowledge and<br />
experience, again sports medicine, of fering the latest techniLques<br />
to Australian athletes in a significant number of sports<br />
that will be relevant to the competitions in Queensland. ./ 2 V-</p>

Australia probably realised too late that if we<br />
are going to compete in international tournamrents and<br />
international competitions whether it is the Commonwealth<br />
Games or the Olympic Games, or other purely team sports on<br />
a one-sport basis, then we are going to have to offer better<br />
opportunities for training Australian athletes than we<br />
had in earlier times. It was really out of discussions * with<br />
some Australian athletes after the Montreal Games, I said:<br />
" what is wrong, why aren't we doing as well as we have got<br />
used to doing?" Australians had regarded that winning came<br />
naturally to Australians and almost without rival. Then we<br />
find that it is hard to win at Wimbledon or the Davis Cup,<br />
it was hard the win at the Olympic Games, and harder to win<br />
at the Commonwealth Games because other countries have been<br />
giving much greater support and attention to their athletes,<br />
than we have, with the opportunities for training of a most<br />
intensive kind. If we were going to be in the business,<br />
I think all Australians would want to be out -there winning,<br />
out front, so that meant that we had to do more. The<br />
pre-Games preparation at the Australian Institute of Sport<br />
represents two different avenues of attack as far as the<br />
Commonwealth is concerned in co-operation of Australian sports<br />
men and women, to try and do something to get Australians<br />
out front.<br />
We are hoping that the Commonwealth Gamnes in EBrisbane-.<br />
are going to be an Australian first, in more t: han one way,.<br />
The Games are going to be held here and we are workin an. X<br />
hoping, as I am sure our athletes are, to see that we ~ takp<br />
out more gold medals and more victories than the athleves; fany<br />
other country.<br />
I am-sure that it is going to be a great event, and if les Martyn<br />
will come forward I still have -ithe cheque Les,. I didn'It lose<br />
it at the Liberal Party Conference this morning although<br />
they might need it more than you.<br />
Before handing over to Les, I would just like to wish all<br />
good fortune to all those Australian athletes who will be<br />
competing in Brisbane, for those who will be -training,<br />
assisting and helping, to Les Martyn and his cohorts. It<br />
is going to be a great event, I am going to shift the<br />
Commonwealth Government to Brisbane for that particular<br />
week. It is as far as I am concerned, I hope to see a good<br />
deal of it. I believe it will be a happy occasion for<br />
Australia and one of the most significant sporting events<br />
which Australia has managed to mount. </p>
