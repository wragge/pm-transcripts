PRIME MINISTER<br />
16 August 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WINTON, QUEENSLAND<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, as I said when talking to the community groups a few moments<br />
ago, I've come here to better understand the problem that Winton and other parts of<br />
Central Queensland continue to suffer from the drought and other difficulties of rural<br />
Australia. It is important that Australians living in other parts of our country understand<br />
that although the drought has broken in much of eastern Australia there are still some very<br />
badly drought affected areas, particularly here in Queensland, and I've learnt today,<br />
looking at the landscape, the unrelenting character of the drought and its impact on the<br />
landscape I've acquired a better understanding of the sort of environment in which these<br />
very stout hearted people live.<br />
I've tried to listen to what they've put to me. I've tried to explain some of the<br />
Government's attitude, the importance for the long term future of interest rates of a<br />
reduction in the Budget deficit which we will achieve next Tuesday night. The importance<br />
of industrial relations reform to reducing costs once product is out of the farm gate and if<br />
we can get our legislation through on that, and I hope we can, then all of those things are<br />
important. I've reaffirmed the statement already announced, made by Tim Fischer that the Diesel Fuel<br />
Rebate is being retained and that's a very important decision so far as the farm sector and<br />
the mining industry is concerned. I want to thank Joan Sheldon, the Acting Premier of<br />
Queensland, for being here today. My colleague John Anderson and Mr Trevor Perrett,<br />
the Minister for Primary Industries in the Queensland Government. I've come here<br />
specifically in response to an invitation from Rob Borbidge, the Premier of Queensland,<br />
who's currently overseas. I'd be happy to answer any questions. And John Anderson has </p>
<p>a specific announcement that he wants to make for a particular package of measures which<br />
will provide support to the rural community. It's a joint initiative of the Federal and<br />
Queensland Governments. I'll leave that to John to announce. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister there was a report this morning that the Government intends, if you like,<br />
increase the Medicare Levy for people who fail to take out private health insurance over a<br />
certain sum, is that correct?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't respond to each and every piece of Budget speculation. I've seen an<br />
enormous amount over the last few weeks. Some of it's been right, some of it's been<br />
wrong, some of it has been off the planet, but I'm not going to respond specifically.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you are offering a private health insurance..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh we're offering a private health insurance rebate. But you're not..<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hang on, hang on. You're not referring to that. The Government is strongly committed<br />
to a private health insurance rebate. I'm not going to respond to other speculation.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Mr Howard farmers today have voiced their opinions about interest rates. Can you just<br />
repeat to the rest of the country now what you told them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well getting interest rates down can do more in the long term to help rural Australia than<br />
just about anything else. Lower interest rates and industrial relations reform together will<br />
do more to help Australian primary producers than anything else. There can be no doubt.<br />
It's the winning double for the Australian bush. Industrial relations reform and lower<br />
interest rates. If we can get the Budget deficit down in a big way and we will on Tuesday<br />
night then that will make a very big contribution over the medium term to a better interest<br />
rate environment. We've already seen a cut in interest rates over the last few months. In<br />
the housing area the cut has been one percent. In the general area it's likely to be in the<br />
order of half a percent. Now I'm not putting any time horizon on it but obviously if you </p>
<p>have a strong but fair budget, and that's what we will have, that will help the interest rate<br />
climate and that is good news with a capital G, not only for the bush but for the whole of<br />
the country. Lower interest rates is good news for home buyers, it's good news for<br />
farmers, it's good news for small businessmen.<br />
JOURNALIST: the waterfront workers are intending to go on strike on Monday to attend a rally in<br />
Canberra. What does that say about Australia's export performance and industrial<br />
relations system?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well let's wait and see how that materialises. I'm not, sort of, going to give a running<br />
commentary on every thing the ACTU leadership said.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
What does the Budget have for the bush?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A cut in the Budget deficit will lay the foundation for further interest rate cuts and that is<br />
very important for the bush. The reaffirmation of the Diesel Fuel Rebate and there are<br />
some other particular measures which are important to certain areas of the bush which you<br />
can wait for Tuesday night to hear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Diesel Rebate but notwithstanding that last week the Education sector was<br />
disenchanted, this week those involved with Aboriginal Affairs. What assurance can you<br />
give to the rural sector that there won't be something sprung upon them next Tuesday that<br />
will cause misgivings out in the bush?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think there'll be any misgivings in the bush after they hear the Budget on Tuesday<br />
night. We have a very difficult job. We inherited a much bigger deficit than we were told.<br />
We have to cut that, but we're going to cut it in a way that is fair and sensible and respects<br />
the fact that there are certain of the productive sectors of the economy that if you cut them<br />
you cut production and that doesn't help anybody and we've been very careful to craft the<br />
Budget in a way that will achieve savings. They've been spread around fairly. We'll be<br />
honouring the central commitments we took to the Australian people. The family tax<br />
package, the health insurances incentives, the commitments to small business, in a number<br />
of areas there are of great benefit to people on the land. If you have a look at the Budget </p>
<p>on Tuesday night you'll find quite a bit in it. It will be of great benefit, not only in a<br />
preservation sense and in a long term sense but also in a specific sense for the rural<br />
community of Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime inister the people out here are asking for long term low interest loans from the<br />
Government are you going to give due consideration to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I've had a lot of things put to me today and I said that I would consider all of them<br />
and then respond in an orderly way. You can't give a flick response to things that are put.<br />
I'm going to consider them very carefully. The best thing we can do, may I say again on<br />
the interest rate front, is to produce an economic climate that is more likely than any other<br />
to bring down the whole structure of interest rates. You still have high real interest rates<br />
in Australia and it's the great bug bear of primary producers all over this country and if we<br />
can strike a blow towards pushing that structure down then people in the bush will have<br />
reason to believe, as I'm sure most of them do, that we have a better Government in<br />
charge now.<br />
JOURNALIST: they're also asking for the drought assistance scheme to be extended so that it covers<br />
two years after a drought breaks rather than six months as it now stands. That's surely a<br />
worthy request?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think there are a lot of things that have been put today that should be very carefully<br />
considered, but I'm not as a matter of, sort of orderly consideration of things, I'm not<br />
going to give a flick response to something that has just been presented to me. I think that<br />
in a way demeans the quality of the submission and it also demeans the deliberative<br />
processes. We are mindful of the problem of the people who are in drought, we're<br />
mindful of the problem of the people who just come out of drought but don't have any<br />
cash flow. We understand that and we're looking at it and we'll look at the submissions<br />
that have been put today. I want to remind you that as a result of drought relief measures<br />
that are already in operation there have been very large amounts of money made available.<br />
But it's one of those areas that you have to always keep looking at.<br />
SHELDON: Could I say on that, the State Government is working on a package that we'll be taking to<br />
the Federal Government, myself and Mr Borbidge, we'll get an appointment with Mr<br />
Howard about restructuring how we look at our rural debt over a three to five year period </p>
<p>and there'll be a number of propositions put in that. We do need to have something that is<br />
not so short term because a lot of people now have totally run out of any ready cash.<br />
They have to have some help from the Government to be able to get long term loans from<br />
the banks to make them more viable. So we are looking at a range of these initiatives.<br />
We're looking at infrastructure, at crops, at productivity, at how we can restock the land<br />
and I think that we'll be taking that submission to Mr Howard and asking him to give it<br />
critical appraisal and to give us some help.<br />
BENSCHER: I might interrupt there, I might as Mr Anderson the Federal Minister for Primary<br />
Industries just to outline some of the announcement he was going to today.<br />
ANDERSON: All right, well can I just re-emphasise what the Prime Minister has said. You right? Look<br />
I want to begin in a very frank way by reinforcing the importance of what the Prime<br />
Minister has just said. We've just seen a half a per cent cut in interest rates. I can now tell<br />
you that to my great delight it appears that all banks have passed it on and for the rural<br />
sector alone that with our current level of indebtedness is worth around $ 90 million a year.<br />
That will give you a bit of a feel for how important it is to get interest rates down, not just<br />
for drought affected rural Australia, but for the whole of rural Australia. There is nothing<br />
more important than the financial area that the new Government can do. In relation to the<br />
various proposals and submissions that are coming forward I do indicate again that I'm<br />
about to announce a major review of the RAS Scheme and that we will have all of these<br />
submissions put forward in good faith to the very eminent and capable people, including<br />
Queenslanders, who will be overseeing that review process. Having said that could I<br />
indicate that Trevor Perrett and I are announcing here today a package of measures to<br />
which his Government and the Commonwealth Government have each contributed around<br />
$ 2.6 million for regional drought initiatives. There are some 20 of them around<br />
Queensland which we'll enjoy funding. They are community driven and will involve land<br />
care groups at a practical on ground level for their facilitation and implementation, they're<br />
all practical programmes that will help with the recovery process, help with the<br />
environmental aspects of drought recovery as well as the economic aspects. And with that<br />
said I'd just like to say Trevor I think they're very worthwhile. We can give you the full<br />
written details in a moment. It's a total package of a little over $ 5.2 million and will make<br />
a difference. I take the opportunity to remind people who are worried about what we're<br />
going to do in the bush, that we have a historic package for land care, sustainable<br />
agriculture and the environment involving some $ 1 billion in a five year programme. We<br />
desperately need that through the Senate, desperately need to be able to put it in place<br />
because it contains within itself objectives which are critically important to rural Australia<br />
today, rural Australia in the future and all of us who depend on our land to feed, clothe<br />
and house us and our children. So it's very important I think that we get that message<br />
out. This is, if you like, a foretaste of the sort of initiatives we can put in place that will<br />
make a huge difference if we can only have the cooperation of those in the Senate who </p>
<p>purport to be Green and concerned about these things but at the moment seem to have<br />
reservations about, what I regard, is a very sound policy objectives that we've set for<br />
implementing the approach.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Mr Anderson in better times this is good sheep country. Are you prepared to say that<br />
your personal view is on restructuring stock piles in the lead up to the debate before the<br />
round table on August 3 0th?<br />
ANDERSON: Gerry, I'm prepared to say that I actually believe that the wool industry is now pulling<br />
together with a concerted voice in a way that is absolutely tremendous, that I really<br />
welcome and I think they're getting towards something that is very practical and matches<br />
very much with the way that I think we should go.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
But you're not prepared to say what your personal view is?<br />
ANDERSON: I'm indicating that I think we're getting very close to the point where they mesh and I<br />
think that's good news and I really look forward to a resurgent wool industry built on<br />
vision and passion and direction set by the industry itself I really believe that it's an<br />
industry that can best take control of it's own destiny. Our job as a Government is to<br />
provide the frame work that delivers the capability to the industry as quickly as possible<br />
for it to take control of its own affairs.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
What about low interest rates for restocking after this drought?<br />
ANDERSON: Let me make the essential point that I make again. What we've got to do is get interest<br />
rates down for everybody. Now there are interest rate assistance packages already<br />
available and they're not about to be phased out, certainly in the current circumstances<br />
that we're looking here. So those assistance mechanism are now in place and of course in<br />
terms of the submissions coming forward, yes I'll feed them through in good faith to the<br />
rural assistance review community.<br />
PERRETT: </p>
<p>It's absolutely paramount that we do get that recovery after the drought has broken and of<br />
course in the livestock industries it does take so much longer because not only do they<br />
have to borrow to restock from those stock and get them to a saleable stage. So that's<br />
very important and I'm sure that the fact that Mr Anderson and the Prime Minister has<br />
accepted the invitation of the Queensland Government to be with us here today indicates<br />
that they are prepared to do something genuine for us.<br />
ANDERSON: There's another point here that I'd really like to make to all urban Australians. Here we<br />
are in a landscape devastated by drought, but the people here are very concerned to look<br />
after their environment. They understand this land, the know how to de-stock it and how<br />
to look after it so that it will recover in the best possible condition when drought breaking<br />
rains come. I draw from that a conclusion that is very important indeed. We need to keep<br />
these areas profitable so that people can survive here, earn a living here, look after the land<br />
and those who are concerned about the environment I think need to really be encouraged<br />
by the concern that people out here show for the area that they live in and the fragile<br />
natural ecology of the area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Anderson, when you're talking about ( inaudible)...<br />
ANDERSON: No I simply make the point that this is a package of regional initiatives, it pales into<br />
insignificance beside the overall fu~ nding assistance that we're providing. In fact, the new<br />
Government has just found another $ 90 million, as you know, in tough budgetary<br />
circumstances, to continue drought exceptional circumstances and there are in this state<br />
some five or six thousand farm families that are receiving very considerable assistance<br />
indeed. This simply relates to a number of creative and innovative local projects which<br />
will be kicked along assisted at local level by this fu~ nding.<br />
JOURNALIST: And there'll be more good news in the Budget?<br />
ANDERSON: Well I believe that the Budget is a very sound document, yes. But I do say this, that in the<br />
end to really get the good news going for land care and for sustainable agriculture we need<br />
that Teistra package through the Senate.<br />
Ends </p>
