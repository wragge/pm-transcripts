PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
NATIONAL ART GALLERY, MELBOURNE, 11 MARCH 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: It's very obvious that my parliamentary colleague, Dr<br />
Hewson, is exceedingly rattled. Today he has forgotten<br />
where his candidate's factory is, but worse than that,<br />
in his -terms he is now apparently deciding that: all of<br />
the things that we have done, that he has described as<br />
unfunded in the One Nation package of the Government on<br />
the infr-astructure side, may be things he can adopt and<br />
add to. So, the ideological model which he has given<br />
everybody with the Fightback package is now unravelling<br />
with the first sort of pressure in a by-election<br />
campaign. This is faster than even I would have<br />
expected it. That is, that Dr Hewson is now grabbing<br />
for the fiscal lever, whether it be further give-aways<br />
off the Budget or adopting Labor's infrastructure<br />
programs, that is building ring roads around cities<br />
which hEt described a couple of weeks ago as grossly<br />
irresponsible and unfunded. So he doesn't know where<br />
he is standing in Budget terms or in ideological terms<br />
and it just means that the first time someone said to<br />
him look, hang on what's wrong with the ring road<br />
around Melbourne, it means the trucks aren't running<br />
through our suburb, he straight away said maybe I can<br />
give you that, maybe I can do that. It doesn't auger<br />
well for his program, and of course in government what<br />
you see is Just a run-away of our fiscal policy.<br />
J: But he does say that he will be able to fund it fromgrowth<br />
in revenue?<br />
PM: Yes I know, but that's just gibberish because we've got<br />
the growth forecasts there which he says were too<br />
optimistic. And at the same time he adopts our growth<br />
forecasts and then takes the revenue from them. He<br />
doesn't know' what he's doing.<br />
J: But isn't that sort of adoption the great tradition of<br />
Australian politics? </p>
<p>PM: You mean he poses a compliment by adopting our<br />
policies? It's a backhanded compliment. I'd prefer<br />
him now to stick to his last, that is to stick to his<br />
dry, un: imaginative last of Fightback.<br />
J: Prime Minister, will you make a visit to Indonesia a<br />
priority?<br />
PM: Not a priority, but I would like to go there at some<br />
time this year and that's a matter of trying to see<br />
when I can do that.<br />
J: Do you have a date in mind?<br />
PM: Not really, no.<br />
J: Do you also consider going up to Papua New Guinea for<br />
their celebrations on ANZAC Day?<br />
PM: I've been asked and I'm thinking about that now.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the Opposition seems certain you're<br />
going to drop the political ads legislation coming up<br />
to the Wills by-election.<br />
PM: The Government has not made up its mind about this.<br />
What I said was that we needed sometime to see just<br />
what impact this sort of legislation was having on a<br />
number of elections and that's what we're doing.<br />
J: What's your feeling about that ban?<br />
PM: I'll tell you after we've had some time.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is the fact of the matter, according to Mr<br />
Hogg anyway, that just as much money is now being spent<br />
as before?<br />
PM: Mr Hogg is an authority on this matter, I'm not. I'm<br />
not really able to comment about that.<br />
J: Would you be upset if the High Court ruled the<br />
legislation out?<br />
PM: We're always upset if any of our legislation has<br />
unconstitutional features.<br />
J: One of the concerns that emerged in the wake of the<br />
Tasmanian election was that Labor down there lost a<br />
chance to put across a rather complex message through<br />
television advertisements in a way which would have<br />
simplified the issue and made the choice clearer. Is<br />
that sort of concern something that's worrying you know<br />
about the ad legislation? </p>
<p>PM: We're moving into a period where the political contests<br />
maybe fought without the capacity to produce the<br />
arguments, and that needs to be thought about. But by<br />
the same token, the cost of producing the arguments has<br />
become prohibitive for the parties.<br />
J: Would you like to have the opportunity to attack the<br />
GST on radio and television in an election campaign?<br />
PM: I think the'GST is such a stationary target we can<br />
attack it fulsomely, effectively, through the normal<br />
processes of the media.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is there any chance that your consideration<br />
of this topic would create any changes this side of the<br />
by-election?<br />
PM: No, of course not.<br />
J: This side of the next federal election?<br />
PM: That's for us to make a judgement about. We're still<br />
looking at it.<br />
