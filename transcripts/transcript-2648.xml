EMBARGO: 7 TUESDAY. 92<br />
FOR PRESS: PM. No. 7C/ 19) 72.<br />
RETIREMENT OF SIR REGINALD SW1ARTZ<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon<br />
William McMahon, M. P.<br />
I deeplv regret that Sir Reginald Swartz has decided not<br />
to stand at the next elections for understandable personal reasons.<br />
Sir Reginald has given long and dedicated service to<br />
Australia in a number of portfolios. He has a fertile min and is<br />
a master of tactics and has left his mark on each of the portfolios<br />
he has administered. His experience and ability both as Minister<br />
for National Development and Leader of the House will be missed.<br />
He is one of the most popular " embers in the House and<br />
Members of all parties will regret his decision to stand down.<br />
I wish him and Lady Swartz many years of enjoyable<br />
retirement. CANBERRA, 24 July, 1972. .972. </p>
