    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of all Australians, I wish to extend to the American people my deepest condolences for the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and her crew over the skies of Texas on 1 February. Our thoughts today are with the families and loved ones of those who perished.</p>
<p> This is a tragedy that affects us all. Space exploration is a universal endeavour which the United States has taken forward on behalf of all mankind. In this spirit, Columbia provided a platform for vigorous international scientific collaboration on a number of important projects. Columbia was also carrying an experiment designed by Melbourne schoolchildren, the latest chapter in a long Australian involvement in the shuttle programme.</p>
<p>Over the past two years the United States has faced unexpected adversity with a steady determination not to be cowed but to overcome. I have no doubt that America's commitment to the exploration of space and its possibilities for all humanity will not be undone by this setback.</p>
