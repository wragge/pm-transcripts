JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE RT HON JIM DOWGER, PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF NEW ZEALAND<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia, The Hon Bob Hawke, and the.<br />
Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Rt Hon Jim Bolger, today<br />
jointly announced their Governments' agreement to an agenda<br />
for the 1992 review of the CER Agreement.<br />
On 5 July this year the Australian and New Zealand ministers<br />
with responsibility for CER, the Hon heal Blewett and the<br />
Hon Philip Burdon, announced that they would be recommending<br />
to their respective Governments that they address a number<br />
of practical issues with the aim of removing remaining<br />
impediments to bilateral trade and of making it easier to do<br />
business between the two countries.<br />
These included: trans-Tasman shipping; specific taxation<br />
arrangements which may be impeding bilateral trade and<br />
investment; trade in services; further harmonisation of<br />
business laws, standards and customs and quarantine<br />
arrangements; and an examination of the mutual recognition<br />
of professional and other qualifications.<br />
Both Governments have now agreed to these items being on the<br />
review agenda. The review will begin shortly.<br />
