    <content><![CDATA[<p>A SUMMING UP BY THE PRIME MINISTER. MR. HAROLD HOLT</p>
<p>Most of you no doubt have already made up your minds about this election. But, with the campaign nearly at an end, I put quite briefly and simply what I see as the great issues on which your decision and support should be given.</p>
<p>In my Policy Speech I said that how we are to carry forward the<br />development of this continent and how best we can make the nation<br />secure forms the very core of this campaign.<br />As the campaign has proceeded this has emerged, even more<br />strongly. You will not only be electing a Government on November 26.<br />One way or another you will be writing a new chapter in our history.<br />I say this because so much is at stake. This, like the election of<br />1949, is truly a crossroads election. The choice we Australians make<br />will be a critical and decisive choice. There is no common meeting<br />ground between us and the Labor Party on profoundly important matters<br />affecting the safety of this country and its people.<br />Today we have a shield behind which we can press on with the<br />task of building the nation to a bigger future a future with exciting<br />opportunities for yourselves and for your children.<br />Our alliance with the United States is the centre piece of this<br />shield. It strengthens our close defensive association with Great<br />Britain and other allies.</p>
<p>With this shield, it has been, and is, our purpose to keep far from our own shores the sinsiter aggression that has made a battleground of South Vietnam.</p>
<p>That is why I say you will be writing a new chapter of Australian history on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Labor Party would pull down this shield of security. Defence<br />and foreign policies if they can be described as policies announced<br />in the Labor Party's Policy Speech would not only abandon our allies<br />and South Vietnam; they would undermine our whole system of alliances,<br />they would gravely imperil American friendship, they would wreck our<br />home-front plans and our defence arrangements.<br />Our reputation abroad would be damaged, perhaps beyond repair.<br />Indeed, the Labor Party has not only reaffirmed its disastrous<br />isolationism; it would now destroy almost everything we have so<br />painstakingly built up over our years of office.<br />And what would they put in its place? They are hopelessly<br />vague on this and divided in their views. They would leave us with<br />virtually nothing~. Our alliances would lie in ruins our defence<br />arrangements would be gravely weakened. On all that Mr. Calwell has<br />told us, a Labor Government would wait for an aggressor to strike at</p>
<p>-2<br />this country and then-call on Australians to go it alone.<br />To-. propose such a course is an insult to the good sense of<br />the Australian electorate.<br />I now ask you to look closely at the programme outlined in<br />the Labor Party's Policy Speech.<br />In recent months, Mr. Calwell has been very vocal about<br />our external policies. He has said many times that his Party would<br />sink or swim on the question of Vietnam. But when he came to putting<br />all this on the line in a Policy Speech, Vietnam, National Service,<br />defence and foreign policy were brushed off in a few sentences.<br />He persists in declaring that what is happening in South<br />Vietnam is a civil war. There are certainly South Vietnamese amongst<br />the Viet Cong, but he Ignores the fact that the Viet Cong do not control<br />or administer any one of the many cities or towns. By processes of<br />terror, plunder and harassment, they are able to exercise influence<br />over some of the thousands of villages and hamlets. He ignores the<br />participation of some eighty per cent of South Vietnamese voters in<br />the recent election for those who are to draft the creation of a<br />constituent assembly. He ignores the evidence accepted by detached<br />observers from other free countries that it was aggression from North<br />Vietnam directed by the Communist Government of Hanoi under Ho Chi<br />Minh which touched off the current hostilities. He ignores the growing<br />infiltration by regular North Vietnamese forces recently estimated by<br />General Westmoreland to be proceeding at a rate of up to 7,000 a month.<br />He ignores the continuing supply of arms, munitions, food and equipment<br />from the North. He sees no connection between what is happening in<br />South Vietnam and the declared philosophy of Communist expansion<br />through South East Asia and, indeed, Asia generally so clearly and<br />repeatedly expressed by the present Communist leaders of China.<br />To him all this is just a civil war. Three American Presidents<br />and the governments of free countries in South East Asia, including<br />Australia and New Zealand, have taken a very different view of what<br />is occur-ring in South Vietnam. When you turn to his Policy Speech<br />proposals there is the same evident lack of realism. He criticises<br />our Government for spending and I cruote him " Too much money on<br />expensive, sophisticated defence equipment purchased overseas"<br />He clearly has in mind such items as the FlllI Bombers and the guided<br />missile destroyers, purchased from the United States of America. P Orhaps<br />also the submarines purchased from Great Britain. But Australia, wVith<br />comparatively small regular forces, must see that they are thoroughly<br />trained, mobile and as well equipped as we can assure. His policy<br />would not only be ye ry much more costly. It would involve intolerable<br />delays. It would leave our forces inadequately equippad for several<br />years. The effect of Mr. Calwell's proposals for the army need to be<br />clearly understood. He claims there is no difficulty in sprtn<br />conscripts from members of the regular army. This is nonsense' If<br />National Servicemen were withdrawn from integrated units in Vietnam<br />the fighting capability of the task force would be destroyed. If you<br />take a substantial number of men out of a battalion, it would not remain</p>
<p>-3<br />a fighting unit. You can't put two bits of two battalions together and<br />immediately have a fighting unit capable of engaging the enemy. It is<br />necessary for-: the me-n to work together and to exercise together to bring<br />the unit to battle efficiency. Mr. Caiwell's proposal would leave the<br />task force inoperative and ineffective. It could leave it incapable of<br />defending itself within the airea of its responsibility.<br />He has stated his Party's intention of consulting with the<br />United States before bringing out the rest of the force. This could well<br />become a plea for United Stated protection for our force pending full<br />withdrawal. But even on this matter of consultation he is out of sorts<br />with Mr. Whitlam his Deputy Leader.<br />The end of National Service would reduce the regular army<br />strength to something between twenty-four thousand and twenty-five<br />thousand. We would not be able with this number to fulfil our agreements<br />with our allies nor our commitments. Our capacity to contribute<br />towards the security of South East Asia would be graively weakened both<br />in terms of the numbers available for this purpose and our standing with<br />our allies and friends.<br />One effect of the National Service scheme has been to increase<br />the strength of the Citizen Military Forces from tho addition of those<br />young men who have chosen service with the C. M. F. as an alternative<br />to the possibility of call-up into National Service. If the National<br />Service scheme was abandoned then the incentive to join the C. M. F. goes<br />with it. Yet Mr. Calwell is relying on a large militia force to safeguard<br />Australia. He says he will rely entirely upon volunteers.<br />In 1964 the pay and conditions of service of an Australian private<br />were so improved that he is more highly paid in his early years of service<br />than his counterparts in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United<br />States. How is Mr. Calwell going to get volunteers of the numbers and<br />desired standard when our best efforts did not succeed.<br />The Labor Party's policy would destroy the unity and the morale<br />of the army. Australia has great hopes of making a significant place for itself<br />in the future of the free countries of Asia. For us now to run out on our<br />allies in Vietnam would be to destroy, at one stroke, much of the<br />goodwill we now possess. It is doubtful if we would ever regain their<br />trust in us and respect for us.<br />Mr. Caiwell is the first Australian political loader I can recall<br />to advocate desertion of our allies as a national policy. I refuse to<br />believe he will find support in Australia for such a course.<br />When he turned to domestic policy, like a salesman at the Show,<br />the Leader of the Labor Party opened a bag full of promises that were<br />really right out of this world.<br />I am sure all of you who heard him quickly lost count of the<br />millions upon millions of dollar q he proclaimed himself ready to spend.</p>
<p>-4<br />He talked about money as if it were confetti Apparently It didn't<br />cross his minc-thathe was talking to people who have to pay taxes.<br />I am sure that as you listened you began instinctively to estimate<br />what all this was likely to cost you.<br />Your instinct was right. On top of a Budget deficit this year<br />of 270 million dollars, the Labor Party would impose a programme<br />which could cost up to another 1,000 million dollars. What fantasy'.<br />If a Labor Government went about doing what it has promised to do,<br />taxation and charges would go sky-high. Our economic stability<br />would be wrecked.<br />So it is fair to say that the Labor Party offers Australia a<br />destructive deal on the two fronts that are vital to us our foreign<br />relations and our home affairs.<br />If, as I've said, Australia's growth and development, and its<br />security, make up the core of this campaign, the Labor Party has<br />failed the nation. On both counts it must be rejected by responsible<br />opinion. We shall, with your support, put into effect a realistic,<br />forward-looking domestic programme. We have always regarded our<br />broad policies as continuing policies and we have always done more<br />than we have undertaken to do.<br />We shall hold fast to our alliances and our defence arrangements.<br />We shall make stronger the shield of our security. We are determined<br />to pursue with our friends the Goals of Freedom we proclaimed together<br />at the Manila Conference only a few weeks ago.<br />Here are those goals:<br />* To be free from aggression<br />* To conquer hunger, illiteracy and disease<br />To build a region of security, o-rder and<br />progress To seek reconciliation and peace throughout<br />Asia and the Pacific<br />We are determined to grow strong ourselves and we want to see<br />free Asia grow strong also.<br />Here is a partnership in a common de&amp;) nce of freedom. Here is<br />a common aspiration for progress. Here is a prospect for that better<br />world order that lies within man's grasp. The alternative offered to<br />you is isolationism and a walkout on our friends.<br />My Government is accused by the Labor Party Leader of<br />so * uandering the lives of Australia's sons. Who is it would squander<br />them? My answer is it would be the Government which first allowed<br />our alliances to be reduced to pieces of paper by falling to give<br />substance to them: the Government which stood passively by while<br />one after another of our neighbours was conquered by aggressive<br />communism: the Government that would leave us standing alone:<br />the Government which would fail to provide our armed forces with the<br />most effective arms and equipment available in the world today. Such<br />a Government would truly be putting the lives of young Australians<br />at risk and at risk also the way of life and liberties of all<br />Australians.</p>
<p>SurelyAustralia will reject this alternative. As your Prime<br />Minister, I ask you to support my Government and my Party. We offer<br />you strength, unity and purpose. We offer this as opposed to disunity<br />and confusion. Your support for us on Saturday will promote your own<br />well-being, will sustain Australia's national interest and will preserve<br />our high standing throughout the world.</p>
