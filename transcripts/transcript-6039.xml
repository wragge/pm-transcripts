PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 1 MARCH 1983<br />
DR
In recognition of the exceptional severity of the present<br />
drought on farmers throughout Australia, the Commonwealth has,<br />
on the request of Premiers, admitted a number of special<br />
measures normally outside the Natural Disaster Relief<br />
Arrangements to Commonwealth relief subsidies.<br />
Most recently, following a request from the Queensland Premier,<br />
the Commonwealth has agreed to subsidise the cost of<br />
scrub-pushing for farmers in Queensland whose properties have<br />
been declared drought-stricken for two years or more. This<br />
measure is a special measure in place for the duration of this<br />
drought only in recognition of the severity of the circumstances<br />
being faced presently by these farmers.<br />
The impact of the measure will fall principally on isolated<br />
farmers in the far West of Queensland for whom the cost of stock<br />
agistment or hand feeding is unacceptably high. Scrub-pushing<br />
offers the most practicable method of assisting these isolated<br />
farmers to providc feed for drought-starved stock. </p>
