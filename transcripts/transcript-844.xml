TELEVISION INTERVIEW ON ATN-7 BETWEEN THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. SIR ROBERT<br />
MENZIES AND MR. RICHAIRD CROLL, ON SUNDAY,<br />
27TH OCTOBER, 1963<br />
MR. CROLL Sir Robert, coming right down to tin tacks, you are<br />
having an election now, are you not, because you feel you<br />
will win?<br />
SIR ROBERT Well, I hope I'll win. That's not the only reason<br />
for having an election, but it is a very good one,<br />
MR. CROLL You said last week that you thought you might lose<br />
eighteen months ago. Do you feel possibly you might have lost<br />
in a year's time?<br />
SIR ROBERT Well, nobody can look ahead for a year. All sorts<br />
of things can happen in a year with a Government that has a<br />
majority of one,<br />
MR. CROLL Would one of the things that might happen, Sir, in<br />
the year be a credit squeeze?<br />
SIR ROBERT I don't think so. In fact, I'm quite sure it won't.<br />
* MR. CROLL A number of economists and Mr, Calwell as well have<br />
said they feel it will happen, Do you feel that there are<br />
boom conditions at present?<br />
SIR ROBERT No, but I think the conditions are good, that they<br />
are improving. I don't expect them to reach boom conditions<br />
at all. After all, we have all learned a good deal from past<br />
experience.<br />
MR. CROLL This is suppositional, Sir~: If they did, would you<br />
hesitate in putting a credit squeeze on again?<br />
WSIR ROBERT I don't answer hypothetical questions of that kind<br />
because of course, you see, the moment I said " Yes" and I<br />
don't say " Yes It would be said: " There you are". I don't<br />
contemplate that there is any real possibility of anything<br />
that could be called a credit squeeze. It sorry to hear<br />
that Mr. Calwell keeps on repeating this because the right<br />
way to create uncertainty in the country is to make that kind<br />
of statement.<br />
MR. CROLL Now, Sir, idoubtedly the employment position is<br />
much better and the economy is more buoyant. You said last<br />
week this was due to your wise considerations, but do you<br />
feel since it took three years this is likely to have occurred<br />
automa tically?<br />
PRIME MINISTER I dont think so. I think that all policies<br />
take a long time to work out. In fact, you have put your<br />
finger right on the spot. If a Government wants to have<br />
long-term policies and see their working-out for the good<br />
of the country, it must have a proper majority. That's why<br />
I have said so far as I am concerned in this election, I want<br />
a good working majority myself or I want to see the Labour<br />
Party have one. I don't want to see any Government in<br />
Australia moving along carefully on a precipice because that<br />
is inconsistent with long-term planning and long-term policy. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
MR. CROLL Sir, you said that your Government's activities<br />
brought the country back to a state of prosperity that it<br />
now enjoys.<br />
SIR R0OBERT I didn't say that was the only thing.<br />
MR. CROTLL-Would you say that some of these policies, Sir, were<br />
Labour policies that you put into effect?<br />
SIR ROBERT W~ ell, don't ask me to define what is a Labour<br />
policy, because I must tell you, as you know, that the Labour<br />
policy over the last five years has included everything in<br />
heaven or on earth. They've had a go at all things. They've<br />
been on every band wagon and so who am I to say that some<br />
policy of mine isntt some policy that at some time they have<br />
advocated. I wouldntt dream of it. I'm too busy attending<br />
to my owm.<br />
MR. CROLL Becoming more specific, Sir, some of the Labour<br />
policies put forward in the 1961 election.<br />
SIR ROBERT No, I think there has been a great misapprehension<br />
about that, I don't think there is any real comparison, to<br />
say the policies they put forward in 1961 were the policies<br />
we were adopting in 1962. They had a superficial resemblance.<br />
They are quite different in fact,<br />
0 MR. CROLL In February, 1962, you decided on special State<br />
unemployment grants9 housing grants, increased Government<br />
spending, extra endowment tax rebates, motor vehicle sales<br />
tax reductions. Now wouldn't you say, Sir, that they do<br />
follow the 1961 election policies put frward by the Labour<br />
Party?<br />
SIR ROBERT I don't think so. As I tell you, who am I to pick<br />
out from Labour policies what is the policy and what isn't.<br />
Why the other day I think Mr, Calwell was saying very heartily<br />
that the Labour Party would increase the Defence expenditure.<br />
This is marvellous. This has all the charm of novelty. But<br />
I have only to go back to Dr. Evatt to find that he wanted to<br />
reduce the then Defence vote by Å“ C1+ OM. So what?<br />
MR. CROLL But, Sir didn't you say yourself to Mr, Calwell<br />
W the other day " Let's not go back to 1956." 1<br />
SIR ROBERT Did I?<br />
MR. CROLL I believe so. You were reported as saying that,<br />
SIR ROBERT Thatts a different thing. I think he asked me<br />
whether I remembered some particular statement in 1956. 1<br />
dont undertake to remember everything I said.<br />
MR. CROLL Sir, coming to what Mr. Calwell said about Malaysia<br />
in last week's interview on this station. Last Sunday, Mr,<br />
Calwell said he would defend Malaysia under an emergency<br />
situation but in long terms they wanted an agreement, a<br />
treaty. Do you feel that this is unfair?<br />
SIR ROBERT I feel that this is, of course, a complete change<br />
of front on his part.<br />
MR. CROLL But do you feel it is unfair, Sir?<br />
SIR ROBERT No what he's doing there is, in the first place,<br />
lining up for the first time with what I said, that if<br />
Malaysia were attacked so that its independence was threatened,<br />
we would join with Great Britain in defending Malaysia. </p>
<p>-3<br />
SIR ROBERT<br />
( Contd.)<br />
MR. CROLL<br />
treaty arHe didn't say " yes" to that when I made the statement<br />
in the House, I gather from you that he has now said<br />
" Yes" to it. If so, thatts a groat advance in his<br />
thinking. The second thing that he said in the House<br />
that he has now repeated is that he wants a treaty, a<br />
mutual treaty. Now, what does that mean? A treaty<br />
with Malaysia, under which we help Malaysia and<br />
Malaysia helps us, presumably a military alliance,<br />
He knows as well as I do and as well as you do that<br />
Malaysia will not make a military alliance-it<br />
insists upon being an unaligned country, Its attitude<br />
in that respect is just like the attitude of India.<br />
It is no use asking an unaligned country to abandon its<br />
most important national policy just to make a treaty<br />
with us.<br />
On the other hand, Sir, if Malaysia would make a<br />
with you, would you accept it?<br />
SIR ROBERT Yes. I regard that of all the academic questions<br />
I have ever heard, the most acaaemic because Malqsia won't*<br />
MR. CROLL But is there any reason why we should commit troops<br />
to Malaysia if she won't make a treaty with us?<br />
SIR ROBERT Every reason because the existence of Malaysia is,<br />
I think, of very great importance to us. Very great. The<br />
defence of Australia for a start, is not to be conducted on<br />
the Australian coastline, It is very important tltat there<br />
should be a strong, powerful, independent country lying across<br />
that part of the world. Very important.<br />
MR. CROLL So drawing these threads together it means then<br />
that both parties would go to the help of Malaysia in an<br />
emergency-both parties would accept a treaty if it were<br />
offered the only difference being that you feel Malaysia<br />
wouldn't offer a treaty whereas Mr. Oalwell would like to<br />
push for a treaty.<br />
SIR ROBERT Well I am sorry to have to correct a great deal<br />
of that, You tell me now that both parties will go to the<br />
defence of Malaysia that has never been said in the House<br />
either by Mr. Calwell or any of his members. That's point<br />
No. 1.<br />
MR. CROLL Did he not say it in his speech in September, Sir?<br />
SIR ROBERT No he did not. Point No. 2 I say I am not<br />
going to ask Malaysia for a treaty because I am not going to<br />
ask for the impossi~ le. I know a great deal about the Malaysian<br />
policy. I know the views of the Tunkn and I know that it is<br />
just not on, and to say we are prepared to make a treaty when<br />
you can't get one is, I think, misleading. So that our<br />
positions are not identical. Mr. Calwell in the House said,<br />
" The condition of our going to the help of Malaysia is a<br />
treaty." That's a very different matter.<br />
MR. CROLL I thought that Mr. Calwell in the House, Sir, said<br />
that he would go to the help of Malaysia in an emergency<br />
They thought it was a very important thing, However, the~ y had<br />
amended their election platform as it<br />
SIR ROBERT He said this to you last week. He didn't say it<br />
in the House. .11+ </p>
<p>MR* CROLL I was merely thinking of my reading through of his<br />
remarks in the House on that date.<br />
SIR ROBERT I read them through with loving cadre to find out<br />
whether he had ever said that. No.<br />
MR. CROLL Sire passing on to the Naval Communications Base.<br />
Mr. Caiwell said that the Labour Government wants joint<br />
control. Now, would you say this is unfair?<br />
SIR ROBERT I would say that this is wrong. First of all, the<br />
United States of America would not have agreed to establish<br />
this base at its own cost and it is a very very expensive<br />
one, running into scores of millions. The United States would<br />
nthave been prepared to do that if it had if it had been at<br />
the price of joint control; that is to say, not consultationbecause<br />
we have always agreed about that, but a joint control<br />
in the sense that both parties would have to consult each<br />
other before messages should be sent out in time of war.<br />
For all I know, both parties should be able to have a censorship<br />
of the kind of message sent out. Now this, of course,<br />
is unworkable,<br />
MR. CROLL And yet Mr, Calwell says that in his talks in<br />
America, the Defence chiefs are quite willing to renegotiate<br />
the treaty,<br />
SIR ROBERT Well, I understood that he said that. I have no<br />
evidence of it.<br />
MR. CROLL You disbelieve his words, do you?<br />
SIR ROB3ERT Well I do, quite frankly. You first of all, of<br />
course, have to define " Defence chiefs". I've known people<br />
who have had an earnest yarn with a serjeant-major dox-m the<br />
street and who then can. give you the military view. We deal<br />
with the American Administration.<br />
MR. CROLL If the American Administration did grant joint<br />
control, would you accept it?<br />
SIR ROBERT Certainly,<br />
MR. CROLL Then, you feel it would be better for us to have<br />
joint control?<br />
SIR ROBERT No, I do not.<br />
MR. CROLL W-lell,<br />
SIR ROBERT I do not. If they want it, wetll have it, but<br />
what you have got to get into your mind is if that had been<br />
the condition, we wouldn't have this state. Neither would<br />
I offer joint control in their place. They are using this<br />
as a signalling station. They are spending a vast mass of<br />
money on it. They are the people who are the sheet anchor<br />
of our defence in the event of a war, Why should they put<br />
themselves at the mercy of a veto by an Australian Government?<br />
MR. CRL-Why then, Sir, was not all this put in the agreement?<br />
SIR ROBERT All what put in the agreement?<br />
MR. CROLL That they want sole control, 015 </p>
<p>SIR ROBERT But this is in the agreement.<br />
MR. CROLL -~ Sole control?<br />
SIR ROBERT Yes. The whole terms of' the agreement are quite<br />
elaborate.<br />
MR. CROLL The whole terms of' the agreement do they not say<br />
that there is no necessity for sole control. In fact, do they<br />
not say that.....<br />
SIR ROBERT My dear boy, an agreement is not an argument. It<br />
is a document, a legal document, and the agreement excludes<br />
joint control, and there it is. If the Opposition comes in<br />
and wants to renegotiate this contract, very well, it will.<br />
MR. CROLL This is once again a case in which Mr. Calwell was<br />
not telling the truth in a statement in the House?<br />
SIR ROBERT Look I don't use language of' that kind, I am not<br />
here to call anytody a liar, I am just stating what I know<br />
because I deal at the administrative level, not with some<br />
vague person described as a Defence authority or something<br />
O moefn tt haatn d sober t.. n g Tihna tO piposs itthei ond. ifference between being in Govern-<br />
MR. CROLL Your statement is at variance then with Mr, Calwell's?<br />
SIR ROB3ERT Definitely.<br />
MR. CROLL Passing on to defence, Sir and the new bombers<br />
that have just been ordered, why is it that they took so long<br />
when Mr. Osborne, your Air Minister in 1960, said that they<br />
were of immediate importance then?<br />
SIR ROB3ERT Well, could I answer that question by putting<br />
this to you. There is a great argument going on at present<br />
in some quarters that we should hove taken the TSR-2, whereas<br />
we have in fact taken the TFX. If we had dealt with this<br />
matter in 1960, it wouldn't have accelerated the result because<br />
both the TSR-2 and the TFX are still on the drawing board and<br />
0 have been for a considerable period of time, What would we<br />
have got in 1960? You dontt go along and buy aircraft ( I<br />
only wish you could) off the shelf good ones, up-to-date<br />
ones,<br />
MR. CROLL Sir, it has been said that the Canberra has been<br />
obsolete since 194+ 9 Surely we could have got something that<br />
was a little more up to date&amp;<br />
SIR ROBERT I can see you are a great reader of Mr. Calwell<br />
or perhaps of Mr. Whitlam. Let me tell you and tell everybody<br />
else that the Canberra couldn't have been obsolete in 191+ 9<br />
because the Canberra prototype flew for the first time in 1951<br />
and I was in England and they asked me to go out to Biggin Hill<br />
and christen it " Canberra". That was the first Canberra<br />
1951. Now I might think that you are obsolete at the age<br />
of one, but I wouldn't have thought you were obsolete at the<br />
age of minus two or three years.<br />
MR. CROLL Sir, might I make an amendment to that. Firstly,<br />
I have been reading Mr. Colwell because this is a reply to<br />
what Mr. Colwell said last week and secondly that was my<br />
mistake because 194+ 9 should have read 1959 and Mr, Osborne<br />
made his remarks in 1960. e / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
SIR ROBERT Oh but you share the mistake because Mr. Caiwell<br />
himself said tUat the Canberra was obsolete in 194+ 9, If the<br />
position is that he made a trifling error of ten years, well<br />
thatts a great weight off my mind,<br />
MR. CROLL Sir, it doesn't make any difference to the fact<br />
however, that three years have elapsed since it was decides.<br />
that it should be of immediate importance and it is only weeks<br />
before the election before something was done.<br />
SIR ROBERT Wiell, I dontt agree with you that it is three<br />
years since it was decided that it was of immediate importance.<br />
A great discussion has been going on about this and expert<br />
advice has changed from time to time. For a long period of<br />
time we were told that Priority No. 1 should be the fighter<br />
and we now, of course, find ourselves coming into possession<br />
of the Mirage which is the best fighter, by common consent<br />
in the world. Then we began some time ago to investigate Zhe<br />
possibility of an ultimate replacement for the Canberra.<br />
People talk about the Canberra as if it were obsolete. It<br />
isn't. It is in a great deal of use in many countries of<br />
the world but we said, " W4ell, now, we will consider whether<br />
we can get a reconnaissance bomber which will be an effective<br />
modern replacement, supersonic for the Canberra and we sent<br />
a mission around the world monihs ago I announced it months<br />
ago to make an evaluation, and as a matter of fact, I<br />
brought with me this morning, by a piece of intelligent<br />
anticipation*<br />
MR. CROLL Sir I wonder if I might interrupt there because<br />
the programme its nearly over.<br />
SIR ROBERT ie-l l, I won't quote it.<br />
MR. CROLL One fina), question and that is how much will the<br />
new American bomber cost us?<br />
SIR ROBERT The new American bomber will cost very very<br />
considerably less than the TSR-2, on any modified terms<br />
would have cost. The difference I am not at present allowed<br />
to say the precise figure. I'll have to discuss with<br />
Mr. Townliey when he comes back next week, but I can say<br />
this, that the difference between the cost of the one and<br />
the cost of the other so much favours the TFX with its much<br />
bigger orders of course, that they give in America so<br />
much favours It that no government could have accepted the<br />
responsibility of spending the taidpayersl money except in<br />
the purchase of the TFX.<br />
MR. CROLL Thank you very much indeed, Sir Robert Menzies. </p>
