    <content><![CDATA[<p>I can report to you that the Australian economy is stronger than it has been for some time.</p>
<p>Last week’s national accounts showed that our economy grew by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter.</p>
<p>This means that Australia has been growing faster than nearly all of the economies in the developed world.</p>
<p>Exports were up five per cent in the first three months of this year – the best result in 15 years.</p>
<p>Housing construction was up almost five per cent in the quarter and retail sales were up four per cent over the year.</p>
<p>And business confidence is continuing to strengthen.</p>
<p>All of this means jobs – a quarter of a million jobs that have been created since the election – and it shows that the Coalition’s long-term economic plan is working.</p>
<p>As I visited small businesses and communities around our country, I know that Australians are seeing this lift in confidence themselves.</p>
<p>They know – you know – it’s the right time to have a go: to buy new equipment, to invest in a new business, or to expand into new markets.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to deliver the important economic improvements that we need.</p>
<p>In the coming couple of weeks, the Senate should pass our Small Business and Jobs Package as well as other economic reforms.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to implement our plan to create jobs, to support families and to make the economy stronger.</p>
