' s I SPEECH NOTES FOR THE PRIMNE MINISTER.<br />
THE HON,. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
FOR THE GOULBURN COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION<br />
12 SEPTEMBER 1975<br />
1. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO BE INVITED TO ADDRESS THIS<br />
STUDENT BODY AND SEE YOUR NEW COLLEGE. THE COLLEGE WAS<br />
ESTABLISHED IN 1970 AS THE GOULBURN TEACHERS' COLLEGE.<br />
A MONTH AGO ON 8 AUGUST--IT BECAME THE GOULBURN<br />
COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION. IT IS ALREADY PLAYING AN<br />
ACTIVE, LIVELY ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT HAS* ALREADY<br />
MADE ITS MARK AS A VIGOROUS AND EFFICIENT INSTITUTION.<br />
2. NOTHING SO ENRICHES AND INVIGORATES THE<br />
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF A CITY, A TOWN, OR A REGION<br />
AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TERTIARY EDUCATION FACILITIES.<br />
N~ E OF THE STRONGEST FORCES FOR DECENTRALISATION, FOR<br />
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, FOR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT HAS BEEN<br />
THE SPREAD OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO REGIONAL<br />
CENTRES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU LIVE<br />
CLOSE TO A CITY AS LARGE AS CANBERRA. THIS COLLEGE<br />
REINFORCES THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER AND IDENTITY OF<br />
GOULBURN. 3. THE ARGUMENT iS OFTEN HEARD THAT AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT FUNDING OF TERTIARY EDUCATION OR OUR FUNDING<br />
OF ANYTHING, FOR THAT MATTER MEANS SOME KIND OF CENTRALIST<br />
OR BUREAUCRATIC CONTROL. TH~ ERE COULD BE NO BETTER<br />
REPUTATION OF THIS THEORY THAN THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF THIS COLLEGE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I HAVE DRIVEN HERE THIS MORNING FROM CANBERRA IN LESS<br />
THAN AN HOUR. WE ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY CLOSE, BUT NO ONE<br />
SERIOUSLY BELIEVES THAT YOUR PROXIMITY TO CANBERRA, OR<br />
YOUR RELIANCE ON AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FUNDS, LIMITS YOUR<br />
AUTONOMY OR YOUR POWER TO MAKE LOCAL DECISIONS AT THE<br />
LOCAL LEVEL. YET THE IDEA PERSISTS THAT BECAUSE<br />
THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS AND ASSERTS A PROPER<br />
RESPONSIBILITY IN SUCH FIELDS AS EDUCATION, IT IS<br />
. IMPOSING SOME CENTRALIST, BUREAUCRATIC CONTROL.<br />
4, Ã¸ L3ET ME DEVELOP THIS POINT FOR A MOMENT. TTHE<br />
BEST RESPONSE TO THIS TALK ABOUT THE PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE<br />
OF THE CANBERRA CENTRALISTS IS TO LOOK AT THE MAP OF<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES, WE FIND THAT MOST OF THE IMPORTANT<br />
RURAL POPULATION CENTRES, THE BIG COUNTRY TOWNS, ARE<br />
CLOSER TO CANBERRA THAN THEY ARE TO SYDNEY. FOR THE<br />
PEOPLE HERE IN GOULBURN, CANBERRA IS PROBABLY A MORE<br />
NATURAL CAPITALS, A CLOSER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE URBAN<br />
AND ADMINISTRATIVE CENTRE, THAN SYDNEY. APART FROM<br />
WOLLONGONG AND THE NORTHERN CITIES THIS IS TRUE FOR MOST<br />
OF THE POPULATION OF NEW SOUTH WALES. WITHIN 150 MILES OF<br />
CANBERRA WE FIND DOZENS OF CITIES AND TOWNS, LIKE<br />
GOULBURN, CLOSER TO CANBERRA THAN THEY ARE TO SYDNEY. I<br />
LIST THE PRINCIPAL ONES: " COWRA, PARKES, FORBES, WEST WYALONG,<br />
CROOKWELL, YOUNG, GRENFELL, TEMORA, NARRANDERA, JUNEE,<br />
WAGGA, GUNDAGAI, ALBURY, COOMA, QUEANBEYAN, TUMUT, MORUYA,<br />
BEGA. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ARGUE THAT GOULBURN, OR ANY OTHER<br />
PROVINCIAL CENTRE, SHOULD FEEL A CLOSER KINSHIP TO THE<br />
STATE GOVERNMENT THAN IT DOES TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
W4HAT WE ARE SEEKING -IN CITIES AND TOWNS LIKE<br />
YOURS -IS NOT . STATE CENTRALISM OR CANBERRA CENTRALISM BUT<br />
TRUE REGIONALISM. THE PROGRAM UNDERTAKEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS MEANT A GREATER DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT BY<br />
THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS LIKE SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS1<br />
WELFARE AND CITIES THAN HAD HITHERTO BEEN ACCEPTED IN<br />
AUSTRALIA. THE UNDERLYING PH) ILOSOPHY IS THIS: IN MODERN<br />
COMMUNITIES, EVEN THE WEALTHIEST FAMILY CANNOT PROVIDE ITS<br />
MEMBERS' WITH THE BEST EDUCATION, WITH THE BEST MEDICAL<br />
TREATM , NT, THE BEST ENVIRONMENT, UNAIDED BY THE COMMUNITY,<br />
INCREASINGLY, THE BASIC SERVI. CES AND OPPORTUNITIES WHICH<br />
DETERMINE THE REAL STANDARD OF LIFE OF A FAMILY OR AN<br />
INDIVIDUAL CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED BY THE COMMUNITY AND ONLY<br />
TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COMMUNITY IS WILLING TO PROVIDE<br />
THEM. EITHER THE COMMUNITY PROVIDES THEM OR THE Y WILL NOT<br />
BE PROVIDED AT ALL. IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONTEXT, THIS MEANS<br />
THAT-THE COMMUNITY, THROUGH THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, MUST<br />
FINANCE THEM OR THEY WILL NOT BE FINANCED AT ALL. THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED THAT THESE SERVICES<br />
AND OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE PROVIDED AND THAT THEY WILL<br />
BE FINANCED.<br />
6. OUR NATIONAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO<br />
REPLACE THE EXISTING STATE CENTRALISM WITH GENUINE REGIONAL<br />
INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION. THE PROGRAMS PROVIDE FOR,<br />
OR RATHER, POSITIVELY REQUIRE A LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT AND<br />
INITIATIVE BY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY.<br />
WE ARE SEEKING THIS PARTICIPATION PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELDS<br />
OF SOCIAL WELFARE, CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND<br />
THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE CITIES AND TOWNS IN WHICH WE LIVE. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
7, LET ME ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WITH<br />
PARTICULAR REFERENCE To GOULBURN. THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE<br />
PLAN IS A PIONEERING EXPERIMENT IN COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT.<br />
ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE IS TO'SEEK OUT AND MEET AREAS OF<br />
SOCIAL NEED HITHERTO EITHER IGNORED OR UN'IDENTIFIED BY<br />
THE EXISTING WELFARE AGENCIES NATIONAL, STATE, LOCAL OR<br />
VOLUNTARY. ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC IS THAT ITS WORK<br />
IS BASED ON REGIONS, ON REGIONAL COMMUNITIES AND THAT ITS<br />
WORK AND PLANNING IS TO BE DONE BY GENUINELY INDEPENDENT,<br />
GENUINELY , COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS OF CONCERNED CITIZENS WHOKNOW<br />
THE 3EPCIAL NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY OF WHICH THEY ARE<br />
A PART. REGIONAL COUNCILS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET UP IN<br />
THIRTY-SIX REGIONS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, INCLUDING THE<br />
SOUTH EAST REGION OF NEW SOUTH WALES. THE COUNCILS<br />
ACT AS A COMMUNITY FORUM FOR DISCUSSION AND A COMMUNITY<br />
INSTRUMENT FOR ACTION IN IMPROVING EXISTING WELFARE SERVICES<br />
AND PERHAPS MORE. IMPORTANT IN THE LONG RUN, EXPERIMENTING<br />
IN NEW FORMS OF WELFARE.<br />
8. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO ESTABLISH<br />
A CHILDREN'S COMMISSION. AGAIN, WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE<br />
PRINCIPLE OF INVOLVING THE COMMUNITY IN THE PLANNING AND<br />
MANAGEMENT OF PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION. THE<br />
CHILDREN'S COMMISSION WILL PROVIDE HELP FOR A WIDE RANGE<br />
OF IMAGINATIVE AND FLEXIBLE PROGRAMS DEVOTED TO LOOKING<br />
AFTER CHILDREN BEFORE THEY REACH SCHOOL AND CARING FOR<br />
OLDER CHILDREN OUTSIDE SCHOOL HOURS. A NUMBER OF PILOT'<br />
PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY BEING SET UP AND WILL BE FUNDED BY<br />
THE COMMISSION. AMONG THEM IS A COMMUNITY CARE PROJECT<br />
SPONSORED BY THE CHURCHES IN GOULBURNI as a </p>
<p>THE IDEA IS TO MAINTAIN FAMILY GROUPS IN THEIR OWN HOMES<br />
WITH DAY CARE, CRISIS AND EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE PROGRAM<br />
WILL COST AN ESTIMATED $ 60,000 A YEAR AND WILL-COMMENCE<br />
NEXT FEBRUARY WITH A THREE-YEAR FUNDING PROGRAM. THROUGH<br />
THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSION THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS<br />
PROVIDING RECURRENT ASSISTANCE TO THE LADY MCKELL CHILD CARE<br />
CENTRE AT GOULBURN. THE CENTRE HAS RECEIVED OVER $ 27,000<br />
TO DATE. ', THE AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO<br />
IMPROVE THlE QUALITY OF LIFE IN NOMINATED REGIONS THROUGH<br />
PROJECTS DETERMINED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION. A<br />
FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IS THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY<br />
!' PARTICIPATION IN MAKING DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEIR REGION<br />
AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE.<br />
THE AIP HAS BEEN OR EXERCISE IN CO-OPERATIVE<br />
FEDERALISM WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BEING INVOLVED<br />
CLOSELY IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING $ 14.1 MILLION IN 1974-75 FOR AREA<br />
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS. THE SOUTH EAST REGIONAL OF NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES RECEIVED GRANTS TOTALLING $ 750,000 IN 1974--75 AND<br />
WILL RECEIVE A SIMILAR AMOUNT IN 1975-76. THE GOULBURN<br />
CITY COUNCIL RECEIVED $ 8,000 IN 1974-75.<br />
THROUGH THE GRANTS COMMISSION, THE GOULBURN CITY<br />
COUNCIL RECEIVED $ 150,000 LAST FINANCIAL YEAR AND WILL<br />
RECEIVED $ 200,000 THIS FINANCIAL YEAR AN INCREASE OF<br />
33 PER CENT. THESE GRANTS COME WITHOUT STRINGS. THE COUNCIL<br />
IS FREE TO SPEND THEM AS IT WISHES. THEY DO NOT REDUCE<br />
ANY NORMAL INCOME THE COUNCIL MAY RECEIVE FROM TRADITIONAL SOURCES. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
11, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM PROVIDES HEALTH<br />
SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE LIVE OR WORK<br />
AS DISTINCT FROM THOSE AVAILABLE IN HOSPITALS AND<br />
SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS. COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES HELP<br />
PEOPLE MEET THEIR HEALTH AND WELFARE NEEDS AT<br />
CONVENIENT LOCATIONS AND TO RETURN HOME AFTER ATTENDENCES.<br />
THIS LESSENS DEPENDENCE ON INSTITUTIONS AND FREQUENTLY<br />
PRESENTS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOING TO HOSPITAL.<br />
THE GOULBURN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRE IN<br />
MONTAGUE" STREET WAS OPENED IN APRIL LAST YEAR, IT IS<br />
READY TO HELP EVERYONE WITHOUT. RESTRICTION OR COST.<br />
IT COOPERATES WITH, BUT DOESN'T DUPLICATE, OTHER<br />
HEALTH AND WELFARE AGENCIES. IT SEEKS TO INVOLVE<br />
THE PEOPLE-IN MAINTAINING GOOD HEALTH AND HYGIENE,<br />
THE CENTRE COST $ 57,000 LAST YEAR. WE HAVE $ 65 MILLION<br />
IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH AND<br />
MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS.<br />
12. THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS HELPING GOULBURN<br />
AND THIS DISTRICT. UNDER THE NATIONAL SEWERAGE PROGRAM<br />
WE PROVIDED $ 100,000 LAST FINANCIAL YEAR FOR THE<br />
GOULBURN TREATMENT WORKS. THE RED SCHEME, WHICH WE ARE<br />
NOW SCALING DOWN, HAS . HELPED 16 LOCAL PROJECTS. WE<br />
HOPE TO EXTEND THE AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE TO<br />
GOULBURN BY USING THE SERVICES OF A LAWYER FROM CANBERRA,<br />
,/ 7 </p>
<p>13. 1 PASS NOW TO SOME COMMENTS ON EDUCATION<br />
BECAUSE IT IS YOUR CHIEF CONCERN AS STUDENTS AND IN MANY<br />
WAYS IT HAS BEEN OUR CHIEF'CONCERN AS A GOVERNMENT.<br />
SINCE MAY 1973 WE HAVE HAD FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR<br />
THE FUNDING OF ALL COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION AND<br />
TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS, MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE IMPRESSION<br />
THAT THE GOVERNMENT' S REFORMS , IN EDUCATION HAVE BEEN<br />
CONFINED. TO PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ALONE:<br />
THAT IS NJOT SO. IT IS TRUE THAT OUR FIR ST PRIORITY WAS<br />
IN THESE,-AREAS BECAUSE THESE WERE THE AREAS OF GREATEST<br />
NEED. OUR PLANS, HOWEVER, ARE . DIRECTED ACROSS THE<br />
WHOLE SPECTRUM OF EDUCATION. WE REGARD ALL LEVELS<br />
AND SEGMENTS OF EDUCATION AS PARTS OF A CONTINUING<br />
AND ALL-EMBRACING PROCESS. MOREOVER, THERE HAS BEEN NO<br />
SLACKENING IN OUR EFFORTS. WE HAVE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.<br />
OUR BUDGET IS REDUCING THE GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE.<br />
BUT OUR COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION IS UNIMPAIRED AND UNDIMINISHED.<br />
WE ARE KEEPING FAITH WITH THE TEACHERS, THE STUDENTS.-<br />
THE CHILDREN, THE EDUCATORS WHO LOOKED TO THIS GOVERNMENT<br />
FOR GREAT AND PERMANENT REFORMS I-N AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION.<br />
OUR TOTAL OUTLAYS FOR EDUCATION IN THIS BUDGET ARE<br />
$ 1908 MILLION AN INCREASE OF $ 237 MILLION OVER LAST YEAR. </p>
<p>i14, I QUOTE FROM THE TREASURER'S BUDGET SPEECH:<br />
IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF OFFICE OF THIS GOVERNMENT,*<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION ALMOST<br />
DOUBLED. LAST YEAR, IT ALMOST DOUBLED AGAIN,<br />
WE HAVE THEREFORE ALMOST QUADRUPLED EXPENDITURE<br />
ON EDUCATION IN THESE TWO YEARS, AND WE ARE MAINTAINING<br />
IN 1975-76 THE HIGH LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE NOW REACHED.<br />
THIS ADVA~ NCE SINCE 1972-73 REFLECTS OUR DETERMINATION<br />
TO MAKE OOD THE RELATIVE NEGLECT OF EARLIER YEARS.<br />
OUR INITIATIVES INCLUDE PRONOUNCED INCREASES<br />
IN EXPENDITURE ON SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS COLLEGES;<br />
EXPANSION OF TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION; ACCEPTANCE.<br />
QF FULL FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION<br />
THROUGHOUT . AUSTRALIA; ABOLITION OF FEES FOR TERTIARY<br />
AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW<br />
STUDENT ASSISTANCE MEASURES; AND ! NCREASED ACADEMIC SALARIES<br />
ADOPTED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE ACADEMIC SALARIES<br />
TRIBUNAL, WITH EFFECT FROM OCTOBER 1974."<br />
IN OUR APPROACH TO EDUCATION WE ARE TREATING<br />
COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION AND INSTITUTES OF'<br />
TECHNOLOGY IN A MORE ENLIGHTENED WAY RECOGNISING THEIR<br />
UNIQUE AND INDISPENSABLE PLACE IN THE EDUCATIONAL<br />
CONTINUUM AND DISPELLING FOREVER THE IGNORANT IMPRESSION<br />
THAT THEY WERE POOR RELATIONS OF UNIVERSITIES.-a I / 9 </p>
<p>16. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESSENTIAL QUALITY OF A<br />
DYNAMIC AND. DEMOCRATIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS DIVERSITYBUT<br />
A DIVERSITY OF EQUAL AND RELATED PARTS, EVERYONE<br />
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE TO THE FULL IN THE<br />
TYPE OF EDUCATION THAT'SUITS HIM BEST. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY<br />
IN EDUCATION DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE<br />
THE SAME EDUCATION OR THAT EVERYONE SHOULD WANT THE<br />
SAME EDUCATION.' ONE OF OUR MISTAKES IN THE PAST WAS<br />
TO PLACE TOO HIGH A SOCIAL PREMIUM ON CERTAIN KINDS<br />
OF EDUcA-lriON AT THE EXPENSE OF THE COMMUNITY' S NEEDS.<br />
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY MEANS THAT THE SAME STANDARDS OF<br />
EXCELLENCE, OF PROFESSIONAL DEDICATION, OF MATERIAL<br />
ENDOWMENT, OF TEACHING SKILLS SHOULD APPLY IN WHATEVER<br />
INSTITUTION AN INDIVIDUAL CHOOSES. OF COURSE PEOPLE<br />
6HOULD BE FREE TO CHOOSE THE KIND OF EDUCA TION THEY<br />
WANT, BUT THIS CHOICE MUST BE ONE BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND<br />
COURSES; BUT BETWEEN STANDARDS, NOT BETWEEN A GOOD<br />
EDUCATION AND A BAD ONE, AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATION OR A<br />
POOR ONE, A SOCIALLY ESTEEMED EDUCATION OR ONE THAT IS<br />
SOCIALLY DOWNGRADED. THE PURPOSE OF my GOVERNMENT'S<br />
REFORMS HAS BEEN TO ENTRENCH THIS GENIUNE PRINCIPLE OF<br />
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, NOT IN A NARROW FINANCIAL SENSE,<br />
BUT AS A BROAD PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLE BINDING ON US<br />
AND ON ALL FUTURE GOVERNMENTS. / 8.10. </p>
<p>17. OUR OPPONENTS GIVE A SPECIAL, NARROW<br />
DEFINITION TO " EQUAL OPPORTUNITY" EQUAL OPPORTUNITY<br />
-IN EDUCATION FOR THEM MEANS THAT EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR UNIVERSITIES<br />
IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT. OUR OPPONENTS HAVE SAID THAT THE<br />
BUDGET PENALISES THOSE WHO WANT TO PROVIDE A DIFFERENT<br />
KIND OF EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WHAT IN FACT THE<br />
BUDGET DOES IS REMOVE A TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED SUBSIDY FROM<br />
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY FOR A MINORITY WHO ARE WEALTHY ENOUGH)<br />
TO ATTRACT THE SUBSIDY. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US MEANS<br />
JUST THAT: EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO THE BEST SECONDARY<br />
EDUCATION AND THE BEST TERTIARY EDUCATION, WHATEVER HIS<br />
FINANCIAL MEANS. My GOVERNMENT HAS ABOLISHED FEES FOR<br />
TERTIARY EDUCATION OF ALL KINDS AND HAS PROVIDED MUCH*<br />
MORE GENEROUS'STUDENT ALLOWANCES, UNDER A LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY RESTRICTION ON ANYONE SEEKING<br />
TERTIARY. EDUCATION WHOSE ABILITIES EQUIP HIM FOR SUCH A COURSE.<br />
18. IT IS NOT ONLY IN EDUCATION THAT THE WHOLE<br />
PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE<br />
BEHIND ALL my GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMS IS UNDER THREAT.<br />
MEDIBANK IS THREATENED. A FAIR AND EQUITABLE TAX SYSTEM<br />
GIVING REBATES OF EQUAL VALUE TO EVERY TAXPAYER, IS THREATENED.<br />
THE COMMUNITY AID PROGRAMS I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED TO YOU<br />
ARE THREATENED. THE AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE IS THREATENED.<br />
MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL REGIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR<br />
GRANTS TO SPORT, RECREATION, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE<br />
NATIONAL ESTATE, FOR CHILD CARE, FOR A HOST OF PROJECTS ARE<br />
UNDER CHALLENGE IN THE COURTS BY THE ANTI-LABOR STATES.. ./ 11 </p>
<p>11.,<br />
THE STATES CHALLENGED THE REDS SCHEME IN THE COURTS.<br />
WE HAD THE ' FARCIAL SITUATION THE OTHER DAY OF PREMIERS<br />
COMPLAINING AT THE SCALING DOWN OF THE REDS PROGRAM<br />
WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE SOUGHT TO DEMOLISH BY A<br />
COURT CHALLENGE, THEY WANT US TO CONTINUE A SCHEME<br />
WHICH THEY HAVE TRIED TO DESTROY.<br />
19.* AS A GOVERNMENT WE OWE A DEBT TO THE STUDENTS<br />
OF THIS COUNTRY. STUDENTS AND THE LABOR PARTY HAVE LONG<br />
BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, IT WAS<br />
STUDENT CONCERN, STUDENT ACTIVfSM, STUDENT PROTEST, THAT<br />
HELPED DRAMATISE MANY GREAT POLITICAL ISSUES AND BRING<br />
THEM TO PUBLIC ATTENTION. MY. GOVERNMENT'S VICTORIES<br />
IN 1972 AND 19714 WERE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE SUPPORT<br />
OF STUDENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE. WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED<br />
THAT SUPPORT. No GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE FOR THE YOUTH<br />
OF THIS COUNTRY IN GIVING THE VOTE TO 18-YEAR-OLDS,<br />
IN ABOLISHING CONSCRIPTION, IN SUPPORTING THE ARTS, IN<br />
REMOVING ALL FEES FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION, IN UPGRADING<br />
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES OF EVERY KIND. THESE WERE THE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS OF A VIGOROUS GOVERNMENT. A GOVERNMENT OF ACTION<br />
AND IDEALISM. WE NEED THE SAME VIGOUR AND IDEALISM AMONG<br />
STUDENTS OF TODAY8 THE GREAT ISSUES OF CONSCIENCE ARE BY<br />
NO MEANS ALL BEH . IND US. ONE VERY GREAT ISSUE REMAINS:<br />
IT IS NOTHING LESS THAT THE SURVIVAL OF OUR DEMOCRATIC<br />
INSTITUTIONS, THE THREAT TO-THESE INSTITUTIONS FROM CONSTANT<br />
ATTACKS ON CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE AND DEMOCRATIC CONVENTIONS,<br />
THE CONSCIENCE OF AN ALERT STUDENT COMMUNITY MUST RE69L<br />
THESE THREATS TO DEMOCRACY. / 12 </p>
<p>12.<br />
I HOPE STUDENTS EVERYWHERE WILL REMEMBER THEIR GREAT<br />
TRADITIONS OF DISSENT AND JOIN US IN RESISTING THREATS<br />
TO DEMOCRACY FROM WHATEVER SOURCE, IN WHATEVER GUISE,<br />
THEY MIGHT COME. </p>
