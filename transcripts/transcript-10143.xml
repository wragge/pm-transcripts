Fax from PRIME MINISTER<br />
*** Embargoed until gpm*** EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE<br />
I announce tonight the establishment of an Employment Committee of Cabinet.<br />
During the election campaign, I promised to accelerate the rate of real job creation<br />
through improved economic management, measures to encourage small business,<br />
increase national savings and investment, structural reform and other measures. We<br />
are committed to bringing together all the strands of public policy that bear on<br />
employment and unemployment in an integrated whole of government strategy.<br />
The broad mandate of the Employment Committee is to promote policies which will<br />
maximise the rate of Australia's sustainable economic growth, create new employment<br />
opportunities and reduce the level of unemployment that we inherited fromn the<br />
previous government.<br />
It is clear that Labor's approach to economic growth and job creation failed many<br />
Australians. The unemployment rate jumped under Labor and remains too high. My<br />
government is committed to reversing that trend in a sustainable and lasting fashion.<br />
The Employment Committee is to be given responsibility for overseeing and<br />
co-ordinating policies in the areas of employment and unemployment, the labour<br />
market ( including labour market assistance), deregulation and microeconomic reform,<br />
industry and small business, development issues ( including major project facilitation),<br />
industrial relations, disincentives to work education and training strategies, and the<br />
link between trade and domestic economy,<br />
The Government recognises that there is no short-term fix for Australia's<br />
unemployment problem, We are committed to accelerating microeconomic reform to<br />
lift Australia's growth potential and provide new jobs. This needs to be complemented<br />
by active labour market policies and programmes to reintegrate the unemployed into<br />
the jobs market. Faro m22/ 10/ 96 09: 28 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from The establishment of the Employment Committee provides a permanent and continuing<br />
forum for the development and implementation of employment policies and<br />
programmes. The Committee will comprise the Prime Minister ( Chairman), Mr Fischer, Mr Costello,<br />
Mr Reith, Mr Moore, Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp. Other Ministers will be<br />
co-opted for specific items as required.<br />
The Employment Committee subsumes the Economic Committee.<br />
