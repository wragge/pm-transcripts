PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT No. 2coq<br />

AUSTRALIAN GOVERN4MENT TO ASSIST SYDN4EY<br />
THEATRE<br />
The Australian Government will provide financial<br />
assistance to enable the Nimrod Theatre Company to establish<br />
a permanent theatre in Sydney.<br />
The Government has approved a grant of $ 123,64r<br />
to the company to help pay the cost of its new theatre<br />
in Elizabeth Street, Sydney.<br />
The Minister for Tourism and Recreation,<br />
Mr Frank Stewart, has approved the grant after receiving<br />
advice from the Australian Council for the Arts.<br />
The money has been provided under the Capital<br />
Assistance program of the Department of Tourism and<br />
Recreation for recreational projects. The Nimrod Theatre<br />
Company, a non-profit organisation, was formed about<br />
4 years ago to provide alternative theatrical activities<br />
to those provided through established companies.<br />
In 1972 it gained the use, on a<br />
rent-free basis;' of an old salt and tomato sauce factory<br />
in Elizabeth Street, Sydney, to replace its small and<br />
inadequate premises in Darlinghurst. The company has<br />
refurbished the building at a cost of $ 204,000.<br />
It has raised about $ 75,000 towards this by public appeal.<br />
The Government grant will pay the balance owing<br />
for the refurbishing.<br />
The grant represents an expansion of the Government's<br />
capital assistance program for recreational projects as<br />
these have primarily been given in the past for sporting<br />
and similar activities. I<br />
The Nimrod theatre will provide a valuable<br />
recreational facility for people in Sydney, especially<br />
those in the inner suburban area. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The grant will encourage a group of enterprising<br />
theatre people who can be relied upon to provide valuable<br />
community theatre services.<br />
The Nimrod Theatre provides an opportunity for<br />
the Department of Tourism and Recreation to give its<br />
Capital Assistance Program a wider perspective and to<br />
emphasise the importance of all forms of recreation.<br />
The Department of Tourism and Recreation<br />
will continue to co-operate with the Australian Council<br />
for the Arts in providing cultural facilities for all<br />
the Australian people.<br />
The Nimrod Theatre is especially deserving of<br />
assistance as it has pursued an adventurous artistic<br />
policy, both in relation to established works and<br />
experimental the tre.<br />
It has won the respect of the theatrical<br />
profession and rapidly growing support from the public.<br />
The Australian Council for the Arts already<br />
provides aid for the employment of professional theatrical<br />
people for the theatre and for production costs. Its<br />
grant this year has increased from $ 39,000 to $ 75,000.<br />
