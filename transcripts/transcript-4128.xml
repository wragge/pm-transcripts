<p>MONDAY CONFERENCE NO. 184: -1-<br />
( MNONDAY CONFER. NCE THEME)<br />
ANNOUNCER: Tonight on MONDAY CONFERENCE: The First Six Months---with the Prime<br />
Minister, Maloolm Fraser.<br />
. ROBERT Good evening. Welcome to MONDAY COIFERENCE.<br />
IIOQRE: Tonight we're coming to you from Canberra. A week since the Prime Minister's<br />
economic address to the nation; near enough to six months since<br />
he won the last election, and near enough to 13 months since Mr. Fraser<br />
was last our guest on MONDAY CONFERENCE, then as Leader of the Opposition.<br />
With me also are: Allan Barnes, one of Australia's best-known journalists,<br />
Canberra commentator for " The Age" and a veteran of MONDAY CONFERENCE.<br />
And, a new face for us, but the outward appearance of one of the country's<br />
best-known voices: fuw Evans, Anchorman of the ABC's nightly radio public<br />
affairs programme, " PM".<br />
Prime Minister, last week, I suppose, was the most important week in your<br />
first six months, not Just because it was your birthday, but obviously because<br />
of the economic statement. I'd like to take up one small passage<br />
from Mr. Lynch's statement on Thursday night which hasn't been commented<br />
on as much as I would have thought, and he said this, I quote: " Sustained<br />
recovery can hardly come about so long as real wages are maintained at the<br />
inflated level which over the past 3 years they have attained". Now, is<br />
your strategy to reduce real wages, the standard of living of the workers?<br />
RT. HON. It's a question of rates of growth. Over the past three years'there's<br />
FRASER: been a substantial shift in wealth away from profits, away from businesses<br />
into wages and real wages have increased. As a result of that, there's<br />
been less profits and less jobs. Now what we would want to see is the real<br />
incomes of people maintained, but increaoing productivity going more than<br />
its normal proportion, into businesses so that jobs can be created, so that<br />
Australia can start moving forward again with an expanded production base,<br />
with a greater real wealth for everyone.<br />
MOORE: But that's, with respect, Sir, that's not what Mr. Lynch said. He didn't<br />
mean, then, what he said?<br />
FRASER: Oh I think he did mean what he said and I think what I've just said in elaboration<br />
is quite consistent with what he said.<br />
MOORE: Elaboration, not contradiction?<br />
FRASERs Elaboration.<br />
MOORE: Oh, all right, well... </p>
<p>MONDAY COF 11EFJCE NO. 1 34:<br />
EVANS: TRASM. EVANS: FRASER: pass on more in profits to the manufacturers and still allow people to<br />
Iwsintain their real wage that they have at tho ! emont?<br />
Once the productive base of Australia starts -oving, once new investment<br />
starts moving, I believe we can, yes.<br />
But wouldn't it be easier if you could find some formula to decrease the<br />
real wage levels as they exist at the moment? Would that not automatically<br />
put more money into the private sector?<br />
I think one of the problems in this is the confusion of terms. You're<br />
saying decrease real wages, it's really slowed down the rate of growth and<br />
the thrust of all our submissions to the Arbitration Commission have not<br />
been to decrease real wages, but to slow down the rate of growth.<br />
But you want to decrease them below the level at which inflation is running.<br />
I mean that is a decrease. If inflation went up in two quarters<br />
of last... the last quarter of last year, and the first quarter of this<br />
year by you recommended to the Arbitration Commission that wages<br />
should only go up 3.2p. That, presumably, is a decrease in what people<br />
have been paying out in terms of costs.<br />
' Well it depends on a whole lot of things, because the Consumer Price Index<br />
isn't a real measure what it costs people to live, they do change. When<br />
potatoes go up very high people buy less potatoes, if meat goes up people<br />
by less meat and they buy other things, but the basket of goods that goes<br />
' into the Consumer 1rize Index is a fixed basket so in terms of family habits<br />
it's not an accurate zeasure of what happens. But let me stick again on<br />
the first statement 7 made. It's a question of a decrease in the rate of<br />
growth in wages, and...<br />
Isn't that really a decrease in real wage terms?<br />
Oh no, I don't think so at all, because in real wage terms it's a question<br />
of what youcan buy in terms of real goods, and quite obviously, a key to<br />
everything the Government would seek to do, and I think that everything that<br />
people with aspirations for Australia would seek, is to get the basic productive<br />
base of Australiamoving forward. Now after.. . in the 1ast year and a<br />
half, two years, of the previous administration, Gross National Product actually<br />
fell. If Gross National Product is falling, how can you do the things<br />
that we want to do for education, for welfare, and maintain family living<br />
standards. It's just not... the size of the cake in those terms is actually<br />
shrinking, and that's what was happening.<br />
Can I put. a question to you on the whole wage indexation concept as we know<br />
it at the moment, in the light of the economic package that was brought<br />
dowm last week. Can you say one way or the other whether your Government<br />
is pledged, fully committed to full wage indexation to continue, that is to<br />
say a full flo -on of the CPI?<br />
Oh look, we've made it quite plain in a very long submission to the Arbitration<br />
Commission that we want full indexation at the rate of the minimum wage.<br />
EVANS:<br />
FRASERt EVANS: FRASER; </p>
<p>MONDA-C0NFERENCL NO. 18:<br />
IAS SR: now tbere's no secret of that, thnt's been publiz kanowledge lPcr a very<br />
long while. We do not want ' Lull indexation in the sense that you used<br />
it, for all salary levels at tall wages. ' Why should there be full indexation<br />
for somebody on $ 20,000 or ' 00,000 a year? I Just don't think<br />
that's real life if we want to overcome these particular problems, and if.,.<br />
EVANS But you Pre in favour of..<br />
in<br />
FRASER.. and/ ou' particular submission to the Arbitration Commission we put a range<br />
of options, the option we said we preferred was full indexation at the rate<br />
of the minimum wage, now that would be protecting the standard of living<br />
of people that most needed protection, and you might also notioe that in<br />
the package of goods announoqd last week there were some very substantial.<br />
measures designed to help low income people in the Australian community.<br />
BARNZIS: That package of goods, really, was meant as a dealing process, wasn't it,<br />
wasn't that package put together so that you could go to the trade union<br />
movement and say here, we are giving you these things which will benefi~ t<br />
the standard of living of various peoplein exchange will you accept lower<br />
rises in real wages. Is that what you were about?<br />
FRASER-It didn't work out like that because we worked out what we thought we ought<br />
to do and the family allowances element was part of what we believed we<br />
ought -to do...<br />
it is<br />
BARNfES: Yes, but/ part of yc= strategy, isn't it?<br />
FRASER: but having done that, we decided that the total arrangements seemed, to<br />
us anyway, so fair snd so reasonable that we ought to make an approach to<br />
the Australian Council of ' Trade Unions and that was done, but that was decided<br />
after, wgell after, the elements of the package.<br />
BAR~ NES: Did you have any prior arrangement with Mr. Hawke and Mr. Egerton and other<br />
trade union people you've spoken to that if you put together a package of<br />
thiB nature, if you dropped things like the proposal to make compulsory ballots<br />
through the electoral office, if you did these things that they would<br />
use their influence to get a deal from the trade union movement?<br />
FRASER: No, none at all, because I announced the measures in that preview talk to<br />
the nation and at the same time I announced that Mr. Street would be making<br />
approaches for the talks. As a result of that I got a call about 10.50<br />
the next morning from Mr. Hawke.<br />
not<br />
BARNES: Did you/ have any previous signs from them that they'd buy this sort of a<br />
deal, had you had any previous..#<br />
FRASER: No, we haven't dealt that way.. I didn't believe it right to.<br />
MOORE: ' Why did you drop the requirement, then, that the Commonwealth Electoral<br />
Office supervised the elections? What was the quid pro quo back?<br />
FRASER: Mr. Street has explained this very well, and for very good reasons as a result<br />
of the earlier talka with the trade union movement the Gayrnmni+ </p>
<p>MO NDAY CONFERENCE NO. 184: -4-<br />
FRASFr: legislation. Now secret postal ballots will still remain a requirement,<br />
there's no dollb+. nhoi that. If a unliou want3 to coruct, wi1, u1i xjper<br />
regulations, secret postal ballots on its own account, and pay for them<br />
itself, it can, but if they are to be conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral<br />
Office, the Commonwealth will pay for them.<br />
Now there were some I wouldn't want to. go into it in detail, but some<br />
involved conventions with the ILO that also indicated that this would be<br />
a desirable thing to do and we believe we'll achieve the result of secret<br />
bsanots quicker because we think a lot of trade unionists will say to their<br />
leadership, well if the Government's prepared to pay for it just by lotting<br />
the Electoral Office do it, why should we be paying $ 300,000, $ 400,000 for<br />
a ballot.<br />
BXRNES: But it was also part of the deal, you also held it out as an olive branch<br />
towards the unions.<br />
ASER: You might find it very difficult to believe this, but these matters came<br />
to conjunction at the same time, they were not part of an overall deal of<br />
any kind.<br />
AN:@ S: Mr. Street did say in the Parliament, however, that the Government, having<br />
shown thiyfTlexibility" was the term he used, I believe, it was expeoting<br />
that the trade union movement would also show a spirit of co-operation.<br />
FRASERt Lock, we've, right fzs the outset, shown a spirit of co-operation, a<br />
willingness to talk, a willingness to listen to all groups in the Australian<br />
community. It's remarkable how sometimes that can be praised as a<br />
mark of high princi:-e and other times condemned for something less than<br />
that, but, you know, being prepared to listen to people, being prepared to<br />
modify your own views as a result of views they reasonably put, surely only<br />
makes for sensible Government.<br />
MfES: Are you prepared to modify your views on Medibank in response to the union's<br />
complaints about Medibank?<br />
FRASER: Well let's see how that's understood first, because I've never seen more<br />
disjointed and incorrect reports tha there were in today's Press about<br />
one pariicular element of Medibank.<br />
MOORE: Could we just come back to the Union Elections Bill, and as I understand<br />
it now the changed Bill is going to go through Parliament but it' 3 not going<br />
to be proclaimed. Now does the proclamation of that Bill, that Act,<br />
depend in some way on a satisfactory outcome, from your point of view of<br />
the Conference next month with the unions?<br />
FRASER: Oh, loc4 when Mr. Hawke spoke to me, the Government having made the offer<br />
of talks, we started to talk about dates. He's off to the ILO, I'm going<br />
t. Japan and China. * We wanted to get the talks in-between, and he then<br />
said that he would like to be able to put it that we would listen to whatever<br />
views the trade anion movement had concerning that industrial legislation,<br />
and that we would not, therefore, proclaim it until after the talks </p>
<p>14ONDAY COINFEICE NO. 184:<br />
' RASER: faith, if we were perauadad by their views we'd be rrenared to mndify legislation<br />
as had already been the case as a result of the secret ballot discussions<br />
that Mr. Street had held, but we were going to put the legislation<br />
through the Parliament, we would hold up the proclamation. Now I believe<br />
that's fair enough and I believe it's part of the sort of consultative process<br />
that Governments ought to be prepared to undertake with different and<br />
important sections of the Australian comimunity.<br />
EVANS: You obviously place a very high priority, though, on reaching some kind of<br />
way of living with the trade unions and in reaching some arrangement whereby<br />
wagea don't have the same effeot on the economy as you see they had in<br />
the last couple of years, but if you don't have any success with this package,<br />
if the unions don't buy it and Mr. H~ awke is already saying that he<br />
finds it unacceptable, I mean are you... what recourse do you have, are you<br />
going to try and influence the Arbitration Commission to change its guidelines,<br />
are you possibly going to give them parameters in which to pass on<br />
wage increases, what's left to you after that?<br />
FRASER: Well I think you might even have misquoted some of the thl2," ga thit Mr.<br />
Hawke has said about it, but. . about what we've announced, but leave that<br />
aside. If there isn't co-operation in these areas, well that makes the<br />
Government'., job harder, it doesn't mean to say a Government gives up, changes<br />
its course. Between now and the time that talks take place, I would<br />
imagine we'll all be wiser because w~ e'll have the Arbitration Commission's<br />
judgem'ent on the recent case that was before it; we'll have its official<br />
views on the case that the Government had put, and so we'll all be that<br />
much wiser.<br />
BARNES: Do you contemplate reversing your 1973 opposition to Labor's attempt to<br />
get federal control over prices and wages if all these other talks break<br />
down? Is it likely that you would approach the States or have your own<br />
referendum, Mr. Fraser?<br />
FRASER-Well we haven't really considered that, and when you look at the history<br />
of that kind of device in other countries, short of a war time situation,<br />
it's never really worked very well. It's like putting the lid on a pressure<br />
cooker and putting a briok on top of the lid to keep in in place for<br />
a while, but unless you can remove the underlying causes of inflation, and<br />
look I'll agree that people can disagree about what those causes are, but<br />
unless you can remove those basic causes, just putting some arbitrary controls<br />
on the top doesn't really help very much.<br />
BARNES: So you're looking for some sort of a social contract or compact with the<br />
trade unions, a co-operative effort.<br />
FRASER: Well I think that's going back too far to Rousseau to be completely accurate<br />
in a modern sense, but, look, words that can build too much into them,<br />
lead to hopes that can be dashed, I don't think do us any good. We're </p>
<p>MONDAY CONFEP&amp; YCE NO1, 184--6-<br />
FRASER: before the union officials as we can so they'll at least know the factual<br />
basis on which.. azainst which we've made our olinv ' eoisioq, I woul<br />
hope that there'll be some discussions that cn minimise the differences<br />
between the union movement and the Government, but, look, I don't want<br />
to build up expectations and hopes to too great an extent. This is one<br />
of the processes, one of the conferences that the Government ought to be<br />
involved in. We'll certainly be going into it in good faith and hoping<br />
for a useful result because if we can get that, all Australians and all<br />
trade unionists will benefit.<br />
MOOp1: Prime Minister, just on industrial relations, and then perhaps we might<br />
leave it, but have you given up the idea of an Industrial Relations Bureau<br />
which was outlined in the joint parties policy last yeai!.<br />
FRASER: Oh no, work is proceeding on this in the Department and in discussion with<br />
other people.<br />
MOORE: And what is the attitude of the unions towards that? I think they were<br />
rather worried about it, weren't they, originally?<br />
FRASIM: I think that it would take some explaining to the trade linion movement.<br />
I think that it's a very fair proposal, but in the legislative sense, and<br />
we always knew this, it would be difficult, technical and involved, and<br />
with the advice of departments available to us and the Attorney-General's<br />
Department, a great deal of work needs to be done before the Government<br />
is really in a po3ition to talk to other people, other groups, about that<br />
proposal.<br />
BARNES: Can. I just follow " ha% up briefly, with one brief question. Prime ? inister,<br />
during the election campaign you spoke about the need for better<br />
relations between management and labour, I wonder if since being in office<br />
you've come to any firm views as to what Government can do. Last week,<br />
for example, there was an article in The Sydney Morning Herald by-John<br />
Valder, th&amp;" Chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange, saying Government can<br />
help employees get shares in the companies for which they work. Have you<br />
really done any work on this worker control or worker participation in<br />
management?<br />
FRASER: Well, the way you describe John Valder's remarks sounded very much like<br />
the Kelso Plan which has had a lot of publicity in some places, a device<br />
to enable employees to buy shares in their own company.<br />
BARNES: Quite, yes.<br />
FRASER: These devices do depend, I think for their success, on very special tax<br />
incentives to enable the proposition to go forward in an attractive and<br />
reasonable manner. I have in fact got this sort of proposal under examination.<br />
I'm not going to make any prediction about what comes out of<br />
it, but if it's a useful means and a reasonably economical means of diversifying<br />
capital and ownership in Australia, and amongst employees of organisations,<br />
of companies, then it's certainly at least worth examination </p>
<p>MONDAY CONFFUø RENCE NO. 184:<br />
FRASER: because it's, in philosophical terms, it's attractive.<br />
" IF d hjk you.<br />
MOOR,: Prime Minister, one of the slogans that's emerged from the first 6 months<br />
of the Fraser Government, or has become associated with you, is new federalism.<br />
Could I ask you this, in say 18 months from now, just to take a<br />
random figure, not altogether random, how many States, in fact, do you<br />
think will be raising their own income tax?<br />
FRASER: Oh I have no idea at all.<br />
Do you think new federalism, or this aspect of new fedoralism, has baen set<br />
back by the New South Wales election in which Mr. Wran used, rather effectively,<br />
the charge that it would mean double taxation?<br />
FRASer4: Well about a day after that election his Treasurer seemed to cast some<br />
doubts on one of the major pledgea durin the election campaign, so whether<br />
the Treasurer would win or whether Mr. Wran will win, only the future will<br />
unfold.<br />
MOORE: But do you think one of the morals is that the people will vote Rgainst<br />
any State, any State Government which looks as if it's going to introduce<br />
income tax partioularly or even any substantial indirect tax?<br />
FRASEa: I don't really believe that this was a major factor in New South Wales, if<br />
so why wasn't it a major factor in Victoria where Mr. Hamer did very well.<br />
MOORE: ' It wasn't artioulated, as an issue, was it, in Victoria, anywhere near as<br />
much? It didn't emerge maybe it should have, but it didn't.<br />
FRASER: Well it was still there, nobody hid it. On nearly every election platform,<br />
certainly when 1 was present, both the Premier and myself praised<br />
the new federalism ,_ roposals, but what I think you n-eed to understand, and<br />
this is one of the things that I think electors, voters, would want to understand,<br />
is that under the proposals that we're putting forward, whether<br />
it be Local Government or State~ overnments or the Federal Government,<br />
you're going to have a better opportunity to see where your money is actually<br />
going; you're going to have a better oDportunity to see who is responsible<br />
for spending it, and if we've got different spheres of Government<br />
in this country, I think it's terribly important that at each sphere people<br />
spending money should be seen to be responsible for what they do, then you<br />
know who to blame. In the system that's operated for so long in Australia,<br />
whenever a State has not done something it's been able to say, oh,<br />
those wretched people in Canberra have refused to give me the extra money<br />
to build this school or to build this road. Now if you have a different<br />
set of ciroumBtances which enables, if they wished, States to be responsible<br />
for themselves, the response can be, but look, you could do this yourself if<br />
you really placed a sufficiently high priority on it.<br />
You've got a situation at the moment in one State that's quite unable to<br />
blame the Ccmmonwealth for anything that it's not doing because on all the </p>
<p>MONDAY CONFF-RIENCE NO. 184:<br />
F. 1 AS ER est advice available to me it's got a Budget surplus of $ 50 million, and.<br />
if they thJ a k ything wa8 important in Tfneir ovn State at the momen;,<br />
at least, they've got the funds to do it.<br />
MOORE: But in your view, as Prime Minister, in your, as it were philouophioal<br />
view about new federalism, do you think the States should raise their own<br />
income tax, that if they don't that they're ducking the idea of new federalism?<br />
FaASMR: Oh well, look, that depends on the level of their activities, the degree<br />
to which they can achieve economy, out out extravagance, maybe go through<br />
the sort of prooess that we've been going through over the last several<br />
months. Now I know some States will claim they've already done that,<br />
and that it was the Commonwealth house that was lush and extravagantlCut<br />
I do think they need to be responsible, I do believe they need to have<br />
auoess to funds and they've always all argued for that, and having access<br />
to funds then gives them the opportunity to make the decision and I think<br />
that's where it ought to be. They ought to make the decision and cast<br />
their own priorities accordingly.<br />
Haven't you made them make a special decision though, now, and through<br />
this upcoming Premiers Conference, you've unloaded certain things which<br />
have been, under the Labor Government, a Commonwealth contribution, things<br />
like sewerage I'm thinking of very specifically. The Labor Government<br />
said we will give vast amounts or large amounts of money to the States to<br />
help speed up the szwerage programme. The States were doing it very<br />
slowly under their : w'n resources, it was speeded up under Labor, now you've<br />
withdrawn a large proportion of the Commonwealth contribution for sewerage.<br />
FRASER: Oh but not all.<br />
BARNES: No, not all, I said a large proportion of it. If they're going to keep<br />
it up, they then have to put the taxes on or they'll have to go back to<br />
the old system, presumably.<br />
FRASER But that raises another and a much larger question and maybe a much more<br />
important question. There is no way in the world that Australian taxpayers,<br />
whether they're individuals or companies, can afford all the programmes<br />
that have been promised by politioans in recent times, and if there<br />
is to be common sense in the finances of Australia, the taxpayers and electors<br />
of Australia have got to be able to understand that, that politicians<br />
have promised too much, they've promised beyond the capacity of taxpayers<br />
reasonably to afford, and you know, I only hope that we can get to the<br />
stage where people reoognise this and will recognise', romising", in inverted<br />
commas, politicians for what they are because they're not promising anything<br />
of their own, they're promising something that they're going to take<br />
from other people.<br />
BAR10E8: But you'd made promises yourself that there would be no cuts, you said, in </p>
<p>14ONDAY COMFEECE NO. 184:<br />
DARN': S; the essential programmes of education, health, welfare arnd urban improv--<br />
merit. Have you decided that sewerage is non-essential?<br />
FRASER: We are still providing funds in sewerage. You'll remember, though, that<br />
those words were used in the context of the last election campaign, and in<br />
the oontext of what was going to happea immediately thereafter. We were<br />
making it quite plain that contracts, fund~ s committed, would flow through<br />
over the, you know, the financial year that we're still in, and you also,<br />
I think need to know that, -jell you would know, but people outside mightn't,<br />
that even in this forthcoming year, in spite of taking $ 2,600 million load<br />
off the Budget on the expenditure side, there will be real increases in<br />
important areas of ex~ enditure and education, for example, is one of those.<br />
Not as large, 1 know, as some of the experts and many educationists would<br />
want, but still a real increase, and what we've sought to do in this last<br />
operation, pre-eminently, is to proteot programmes that affect the disadvantaged<br />
or the aged and at the same time to protect programmes that are<br />
necessary to provide opportuinity for Auatralians, and if we're going to<br />
do that and bring the total budgeting of the Commonwealth back into some<br />
level o' talanoe, and you know you can't get that balance in one year,<br />
it'll take a while. it vas quite obvious that the large prograames were<br />
ones that were going to have to be reduced, and significantly reduced.<br />
EVANS: If I could just go back to the question of your concept of federalism and<br />
th* e accountability of States to their electors, and indeed to raising the<br />
kind of money that, the7 want to spend if they've put a priority on it, K1.<br />
Wran of course has a roblem of his own in this area in that he has pledged<br />
himself not to iitroduoe personal income tax in New South Wales, now~<br />
whether you think it was wise of him to olose off that option to himself<br />
or not, the chances are and he's indicated this tiie evening so far as I<br />
know that he's feeling that it's a very real possibility that he's going<br />
to have to introduce new indirect taxes in New South Wales to meet the kind<br />
of Budget that he wants to spend. If he does that, these regressive<br />
taxes are going to rind their way back into the CPI and provide new problems<br />
for you. Nlow what's the answer for Mr. Wran if he doesn't feel that<br />
raising personal income tax in New South Wales, for his purposes, is the ansawer?<br />
FRASER: One of the answers for all Governments, and this gets back to the point I<br />
was trying to make earlier, is to make sure that aspirations, expectations,<br />
are limited to resources. Now I know quite well that there can be a legitimnate<br />
argument about the level of'reuources that the Commonwealth spends,<br />
the State spends and Local Government spends, but taken overall in Australia<br />
the expectations of the Australian people have been led to grow far beyond<br />
that which Australian taxpayers of all kinds can afford and therefore all<br />
Governments have a responsibility to bring this back to reality and that's<br />
not to say that Ggvmentsreo cut out essential programmes in terms of,<br />
you lcncw, educaticn,,' oz programmes that affect the disadvantaged, and </p>
<p>MON-DAY CONFL0N1CE NO, 184:<br />
VRAS. SI directed, and we've, in our recent measures, taken one very significant<br />
step in that particular direction, but 3overnments that just go on promising<br />
more and more, at a stage when Australia's real wealth, the size of<br />
the national cake has in fact been diminishing, are deluding not only themselves<br />
but more cruelly and deceptively they're deluding the Australian<br />
people.<br />
EVAANS: So is there any answer to Mr. Wran's attempt, he's indicated he wants to<br />
you Toneyp<br />
try and persuade/ him in doing something about the employment situation in<br />
New South Wales, I mean are you going to be at all responsive to that kind<br />
of proposition if it requires federal money?<br />
FRASE: de're responsive to matters that are of concern in the employment area, but<br />
we've gone past the stage with inflation as it is in Australia, and interest<br />
rates as they always are in a country when inflation is high in which<br />
pump priming from Governments will in fact overcome the problems of unemployment<br />
and that's been shown very plainly in the last couple of years of<br />
the previous administration. Pump-priming, change in techniques, are<br />
fine and necessary when you've got unemployment, low int-rest rates and<br />
virtually no inflation. Under those oirc-asstances pump-priming will<br />
work, but it's been proved n to work.<br />
EVAS You're saying we should reduce the money supply?<br />
FRASER: We~ l again that's . sirg a technical term and I wasn't speaking in technical<br />
terms, but I am 3jing that Governments have got to limit what they<br />
themselves do and got to move resources out into the private sector<br />
which does, after all, provide three out of every four jobs in Australia,<br />
tc get the real productive sector in Australia moving forward, and this is<br />
the rationale behind a number of the measures that the Government has introduced<br />
over its term of office.<br />
F ES: Prime Minieter., you threw me a moment ago when you said.. implied that the<br />
spending things listed in your policy speech last November applied only to<br />
the rest of the financial year. Do we take from that that when you said<br />
for example, quote, " We will maintain present levels of assistance to Aboriginals",<br />
and then last week drastically cut the level of assistance to<br />
Aboriginals, did that promise only apply to the 1975-76 financial year?<br />
FRASER: That policy speech was obviously specifically directed to the ciroumstances<br />
in which it was made, but since then we've found many examples of very real<br />
extravagance in this particular area, especially in the way housing is being<br />
delivered to Aborigines, quite large sums, upwards of $ 700,000 or $ 800,000<br />
being spent in a number of cases, five or six or seven houses oompleted. In<br />
other cases large sums spent and no houses completed. There has been<br />
very large waste in these areas for which I don't blame Aborigines for one<br />
moment, I'm only sad that so much of the funds that have been spent have<br />
been dissipated along the way, but let me also say that the change in the<br />
family allowance arrangements are going to advantage Abc-rigine families en-<br />
-1o-</p>
<p>MONDAY CCGfrRENCE 184: -11-<br />
FRASER: give them some degree of self-esteea because this money goes to them as families<br />
to be spent as they wish, not as some paternal person from a Department<br />
determines, and I believe that this particular measure, for a number<br />
of families in this bracket, might do a very great deal to help. They'll<br />
have resources, and if they've got families of five o-six kida, as quite a<br />
number have, they'll have resources of a kind which is freely available to<br />
them to spend as they wish in a way that they never would have had before,<br />
and that would need to be disouunted against any other decisions that have<br />
been made, but one of the reasons for the decisions in that particular<br />
area is the degree of extravagance and waste that havein fact been uncovered.<br />
BARIES: I suppose I was just getting at the general proposition that voters come<br />
out at election time, they hear a political leader such as yourself make<br />
what appear to be very specific undertakings. Where does it leave the<br />
whole credibility of political.. polioy speeches? I mean, you know,<br />
there are many other things that you've changed. One may say they're<br />
very good things, you know, you've dro-ped your promise to abolish the<br />
Prices Justification Tribunal, people say that's good fle2ib'ility; you've<br />
dropped your fire promise to introduce compulsory Electoral Office ballots,<br />
a<br />
but people may say that's/ very good thing, but it's not whether people<br />
think it's good or bad but how much credibility rests in a policy speech<br />
if you oan suddenly say, well that's non-operative any longer.<br />
FRASER: No, nobody said tha's non-operative any longer, and support for Aborigines<br />
is obviously a very hiapriority for this Government, but it's support of a<br />
kind' that we want tc see goes to Aborigines to help them and if we uncover<br />
waste in a way that indicates that support is not helping Aborigines, is it<br />
our job, our responsibility to the taxpayer to allow that to oontinue because<br />
that wasn't...<br />
BARNES: I'm not gett. ng. at what you've done, Sir, I'm getting at what you said you'd<br />
do. That's what I'm getting at about credibility.<br />
FRASER: But I think you're wanting to have it both ways, and in any case d contend<br />
with you, takin: the totality of the aleasures that we have put, that the<br />
real level of what is being done for Aborigines is probably not going to<br />
be much changed because I place much more reliance, maybe than you do, on<br />
the changed system of family allowances and the independence and self-esteem<br />
that his will allow to people. I think paternalism has gone on too far.<br />
BARNES: I think it's a great reform.<br />
MOORE: I'm sorry, I want to change and move on if we could, now, because time's<br />
beginning to run out. You came to offion in the midst of exceptional<br />
Constitutional circumstances in an election/ which the electorate showed<br />
that it was unusually divided and a large section of the community bitter,<br />
has this mood in the country made life more difficult for you as Prime Minister,<br />
has it inhibited you in any way, are you aware of a substantial </p>
<p>MONDAY CONFERENCE NU. 184: -12-<br />
FRAS2R: No ond T don't ee i. t hn I go to peol wherever tey may be<br />
in different places.<br />
EVANS: But the Governor-General sees it when he goes around. How concerned are<br />
yuu about the demonstrations against the Governor-General, and some of the<br />
speculation that they may reach a kind of crescendo next year when the<br />
Queen comes out to Australia?<br />
that<br />
FRASE1R: Well I think/ if people had indicated the kind of demonstration that vas<br />
given on ANZAC Day in Canberra when there was a record turnup and only one<br />
voice raised in protest, silenced by those round about her, not much publicity<br />
was given to that, and I think in this particular area the media has<br />
given undue prominence to one side of the story.<br />
EVANS: You don't find it possibly embarrassing though if there are such demonstrations<br />
when the Queen is out here in company with the Governor-General, would<br />
that not be embarrassing?<br />
FRASER: But I think that shows a, if I may say it, a slight lack of understanding<br />
of what traditionally occurs when the Queen is present in kuatralia.<br />
. alS: I'm not sure that the circumstances really are particularly traditional so<br />
far as the Governor-General is concerned, whether he was right or wrong is<br />
immaterial to me, but the fact is that there have been demonstrations, and<br />
it seems on the cards that they may increase when the Queen comes out next<br />
year.<br />
FRASER: But why would they? Why would people demonstrate against the Queen?<br />
, r NSt I don't know that the demonstration would be aimed against the Queen.<br />
FRASER: I know, but the point that you're missing, and the point that you're misunderstanding<br />
and which, you know, really I think makes the questions irrel-<br />
Sevant is that when the Queen is present in Australia, except for one or two<br />
occasions, welcoming, departure and this sort of thing, the Governor-General<br />
and the Queen do not appear on the same occasion.<br />
MOORE:; How have the events of November-December last, in praotical terms, have they<br />
had any effect on your relationship with the parliamentary Opposition? Have<br />
they made the working of Parliament more difficult or less pleasant or whatever<br />
the word is, in any way?<br />
FRASER: Oh I don't think so, I think there are some people who are particularly bitter<br />
about those circumstances; I think Mr. Whitlam showed a remarkable<br />
lack of judgement in carrying on a particular view, but Mr. Hawke showed<br />
great common sense in saying, " Let the past be past, the people of Australia<br />
have cast their judgement".<br />
MOORS: Yes. I'd like to spend unless you've got something, Allan, on this...<br />
BARES.: No, no.<br />
MOORE; a short time on two specific aspects of foreign policy. I don't think </p>
<p>MOIzAY CONtEENCE NO. 184: -13-<br />
' OOR there's a lot that we want to tqlk to you about foreign policy. tonight,<br />
but there are a couple of obvious aroas and I think one of them is East<br />
Timor and our relationships with Indonesia. What is now, forgetting<br />
the history, what is now our basic policy objeotive towards ths solution<br />
of. the Timor problem or its effeot on our relationship with Indonesia?<br />
What do we simply want?<br />
FRASER: Well the basic objective in relation to East Timor hasn't varied, it has<br />
been to establish the circumstance where there wasn't any fighting, where<br />
the<br />
/ international Red Cross could get in. where there could be a proper act<br />
of self-determination, and I'd like to add and that hasn't altered, and<br />
Andrew Peacock has spelt that view out, I think, very plainly and very<br />
firmly, and the situation might have been vastly different if a previous<br />
administration hadn't taken, if Mr. Gregory Clark is accurate in his reportings,<br />
a qjuite different view in terms of oertain assurances that were<br />
alleged to have been given.<br />
But let me also say, ) n the broader context of your question, that I think<br />
that we've been able to state the views we have ooncernir) Fast Timor because<br />
of the depth and of the understanding of our relationship with Indonesia<br />
itself and it's because of the strength of that relationship that<br />
it' 3 been possible to express these views and not damage that relationship,<br />
and, you kno--, there are historical analogies, or not analogies but<br />
Sother events in history which support that view because right throughout<br />
the difficult days : f confrontation we had troops on one side, but at the<br />
same time our Anbassador in Indonesia was able to maintain close links,<br />
close communication with Indonesia in a way which was certainly useful to<br />
both countries and useful, I believe, to the final resolution of that particular<br />
issue.<br />
SEVANS: But the vital thing, I was going to say, surely, is just wnat tha't proper<br />
act of free-choice is going to be and how acceptable it's going to be to<br />
the rest of the world and indeed to us.<br />
FARASER: Well, you know, that's right, and that remains to be seen.<br />
MOORE: Is. there the slightest possiblity that there would be a chance for selfdetermination<br />
now, in practical, real terms?<br />
EVANS: Demooratic terms, indeed.<br />
FRASER: There would have been a very much better chance if different actions had<br />
been taken starting about 212 years ago. When administration in Portugal<br />
started to fall apart, that's when action should have been taken, actions<br />
that were not taken.<br />
BARN-ES: Do you think that not only the previous administration but the previous<br />
administration's advisers fell down on the job?<br />
FRASERt: Oh, it's not my job to criticise advisers.<br />
BARNES: Why not? I would have thought a Prime Minister's An+. ifla </p>
<p>, MONDAY CONFERENCE NO 184<br />
PFRAS Fi: Oh no, I don't thirk so, because it's ultimately the : olitican's judgement<br />
wbether they accept that advice or whether they don't accept that<br />
advice. The task of the adviser in the Public Service is to give his<br />
advice honestly and fearlessly, argue for his point of view as hard as he<br />
can until the decision is made. Having got to that point, then io carry<br />
out the decision even if it's contrary to the advice that he was given, and<br />
in all y experience of the Public Service that overwhelmingly is the way<br />
the Public Service behaves.<br />
EVANS: It's only about three weeks now before you leave on your first major overseas<br />
sortie and of course you're going to Peking and to Tokyo. Tokyo, I<br />
think, we mighnt have a fair idea of the sorts of things you'd be interested<br />
in discussing there, but what do you think you might have in common with<br />
TSe-tung if you met him?<br />
FRASER: Well one of the reasons I'm going to China is obviously to learn. I've<br />
never really spent much time in either country, although, obviously contact<br />
with people from Japan has been much more than from China. I've had<br />
a number of conversations with thair Charg6 in Canberra and i think we'll<br />
have wide-ranging discussions over a number of matters that.. trade matters,<br />
attitudes to international relations, attitudes to events in the Indian<br />
Ocean or the Pacific, South-East Asia...<br />
EWANS: I was going to say, you'd have that in common with them at least so far<br />
as the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean is concerned.<br />
FRASER: Oh, well I understand so from statements they've been making, yes.<br />
J^ RNES: In choosing to go o China, before even going to the United States or Britain,<br />
is this Dart of you signalling your criticism of detente, your position,<br />
your hard pcition, your firm position that you don't accept American-<br />
Russian detente? Is this a signal?<br />
. r LASER: I'd like tc,. snswer that in two ways if I could because there's as assumption<br />
about my attitude to detente and I'd just like to ask a question<br />
about it which doesn't need answering. People do need to ask themselves<br />
if the relationship between Russia and America would have been any different<br />
if that term had never been used, if they'd just gone on talking tv<br />
each other, somstimes more effectively and sometimes less effectively. Detente<br />
gave rise to expectations, the use of the term, that were not fulfilled,<br />
have not been fulfilled, and I think President Ford in a recent statement<br />
has recognised that.<br />
But my reason for wanting to go to Japan and China first was a different<br />
one. Traditionally Australian Prime Ministers have gone to Britain or<br />
gone to Washington, but the world changes. We have vastly important relationships<br />
with Japan; officials have agreed the draft of the Treaty,<br />
the friendship between Australia and Japan and I don't believe there'll be<br />
any impediments left to the signature of that when I visit there, and obviously<br />
the future direction of China's policies are of enormous signif-<br />
-14-</p>
<p>(; WrAEYC NIREflCE NG. 0O:-5<br />
Pi11SR: world, and I don't believe anyone ca-n foretell with complete az~ otu-cyv -I<br />
maybe not with any accuracy at all what direction, what future directions<br />
those policies will take. China, in many ways, is the great imponderable,<br />
and to have useful, hopefully oonstruotive relationships with<br />
China is, I thixk, very important indeed. Now to have constructive relationships<br />
with a country doesn't mean to say you need the same philosophical<br />
background; it doe~ sn't mean to say you need the same form or system<br />
of Government. It depends upon your attitude to international relations,<br />
and the way you deal with questions that arise in international relations,<br />
and while obviously China's done things that we don't exactly applasud, she<br />
is still emerging in the great world of the superpowers and nobody really<br />
kLnows quite what direction she's going to go in, and all the more important,<br />
therefore, to talk, to discuss, to exchange ideas. And one last<br />
quiok follow up to that, I felt that when I do oome to go-to America, and<br />
to London which obviously at some stage I will do, I felt it would be much<br />
more useful, in both those places, if I'd been to Japan and China first.<br />
MOORE: Prime Minister, I've got one last small point, well not small point but<br />
much nearer home issue in foreign affairs. In the question of settling<br />
our boundary with Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait business, what<br />
status in these discussions does Mr. Bjelke-Petersen have?<br />
F'RASER: As a person who is concerned for a number of Australians, as the Torres<br />
-Strait Islanders plainly are, and as we intend they shall remain, and since<br />
they are part of his State he has a right to be concerned about that.<br />
F1OORE:. I think my question is how big a right? I mean in the last resort is he<br />
going to be part of the decision or not?<br />
FRASER. Oh I think I've said quite plainly what the matter is. He is concerned<br />
for the status as Australians of a number of people and he's concerned that<br />
that status as Australians, their rights as Australian citizens, will not<br />
be upset. He's concerned that their right to the territory in which<br />
they've lived and hunted and fished, where their culture has developed over<br />
the ages, will not be upset. It's part of the State of Queensland. He<br />
has a right to be concerned about -these things and I would expect any responsible<br />
Premier to be concerned about them, but I also believe that we are<br />
going to come to, and I hope you won't probe me too deeply on the details<br />
of this, but there have been initial discussions in a number of directions,<br />
Andrew Peacock has had one set of talks in Papua New Guinea, there'll be<br />
another set of talks a little lateic; it was discussions with Mr. Petersen,<br />
Mr. Anthony, Mr. Lynch and myself after Mr. Petersen's last visit to Torres<br />
Strait when he was meant to be coming down and talking to us about other<br />
matters, but it was that discussion that cleared the way for talks in a<br />
basis that's understood and that preserves the rights, in the way in which<br />
I've spoken in Parliament, of the Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
EVANS One suggastion that has been put forward, and I just wondered if you'd like </p>
<p>1 1DA J, 1' 0U PR'KE NO. 184: -16-<br />
iWVAN6: still remain Australian, is that under consideratJon?<br />
" R} ASR: Well, look, I'd much sooner not Lalk about details because part of the<br />
detail's something that's misunderstood and misconstrued and then people<br />
get concerned when maybe they have no need to get concerned and it can<br />
also upset negotiations which are going on in two different directions, because<br />
we are also, in our objective, obviously wanting to keep the Torres<br />
Strait Islanders fully informed of our attitudes and of our determination<br />
to Frotect their future and their children's future.<br />
BARNES-Back to very mundane, domestic matters, Prime Minister, as a private citizen,<br />
have you decided if you're going to stay in Medibank?<br />
. RASER: Maybe partly in, partly out, but I haven't looked at it yet..<br />
BARNES: You haven't looked at it?<br />
F2RSER: Mh?<br />
o. ARKS: I'm surprised that you haven't looked at it, the public's worried about<br />
this, I would have thought the Prime Minister could guide them a little.<br />
Well I can, but what I'm saying is I haven't looked at it from my own persona!<br />
point of view. What Medibank will do for people in e income<br />
bracket is to provide the cheapest form of health cover. What it also<br />
does is to make sure that those on lowest incomes don't have to pay any<br />
Fart of the levy because they're below the area where the levy is paid,<br />
and as you go higher up the income scale you either pay more in levy or<br />
then get to the stage when you buy a Medibank package.<br />
Now one of the reasons the Medibank package, buying a Medibank package was<br />
introduced was because we felt it would be unjust if with a 2J% levy people<br />
going way on up the scale were starting to pay $ 600 or $ 700 for something<br />
that obviously wasn't going to cost that much, and seoondly, if everyone was<br />
going to tke. levy, two-income families would be bearing an unduly heavy<br />
burden, and so at the area where you want to put a ceiling, the Medibank<br />
package enables a person to buy a Medibank cover at a ceiling price and it<br />
also enables a two-income family to work out whether they're better off<br />
both paying the 20% levy or whether one of them buys the Medibank package,<br />
and what people need to do is to look to their own circumstances and if<br />
it's a married couple with one income, and then determine . hether they want<br />
just standard ward oover or intermediate cover, and tthen they look at the<br />
options available to them, and they make up their minds to see whether they're<br />
prepared to pay the extra for intermediate or private ward cover. It's<br />
not going to be very complicated for each individual, or for each family unit<br />
It's just<br />
BARITES: / that you haven't worked it out yet.<br />
FRASER: Well I'va been so busy with a few other things that I haven't spoken about<br />
my own particular form of health insurance. </p>
<p>MONDAY CONPERNCE NO. 184:<br />
BARHES: Are you impressed by the critirism of Professor Ronald Henderson. the<br />
head of the Poverty Inquiry who was very influential, I gather, in your<br />
child endowment scheme, are you impressed with his criticism that your<br />
arrangements for Medibank could create what he sees as a divisive situation<br />
in the community, rather like, he said, the old days of education<br />
in which the poor health and the.. poople who are treated as poor in the<br />
Medibank ocheme?<br />
FRASER: No, I don't think it will because the Medibank health cover is going to<br />
provide the best basic cover and it's a question really.. and the medical<br />
side has not altered, or the changes in the medical side I think, for the<br />
purposes of public debate, can largely be put aside, it's a question of<br />
whether somebody wants to...<br />
BAR S: Oh, hospital treatment I think is very much what he's talking about.<br />
FRASMR: insure for intermediate or privato ward treatment, and it was felt that<br />
the arrangements that we've introduced are fair and reasonable. I've already<br />
met some people, well up the income scale, who say that thoy don't<br />
particularly like health funds so they're going to buy hu edibank pa,. kage<br />
and that's what they want, but I also know other people whose family<br />
levy might be $ 150 who will want to pay the $ 150-odd to insure for intermediate<br />
ward treatment...<br />
BARNES: I think that's what he's getting at.<br />
FRASER: and that gives : e the option, the opportunity of doing it.<br />
was<br />
BARNES: I think Professor henderson getting at that very point, that you walk into<br />
a doctor's room and you say I've got to have my tonsil-S. out and he says<br />
are you Medibank or non-Medibank and you say I'm Medibank, he says, sorry,<br />
you go along to the hospital and get treated by whoever you like, I can<br />
only treat you if you're in an intermediate ward and covered by a private<br />
fund. If's" that splitting of the community.<br />
FRASER: Yes, but a person makes that choice for themself...<br />
BARNES: Quite, but I mean it's pretty obvious, isn't it?<br />
MOORE: And it does mean it's no longer universal in that sense.<br />
FRASER: Oh no it doesn't, it is universal, because Medibank covers everyone and<br />
the total arrangments cover everyone. It's universal, it's compulsory,<br />
and there Is no means test. But where I was talking about the element of<br />
choice, somebody reasonably low down on the income scale, has got an element<br />
of choice because of the way in which the levy is structured and the<br />
way in which the additional buying'hospital only' insurance enables him to<br />
upgrade the hospital bed he's in because the other element of this, of<br />
course, is that your own doctor can follow you into that other bed and<br />
which some people will want to do, and Medibank never pretended to allow<br />
your own doctor to follow you into standard Medibank wards.<br />
