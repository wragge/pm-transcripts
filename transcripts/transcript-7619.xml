PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 JUNE 1989<br />
It was with deep regret that I learned of the death of<br />
Malcolm Scott.<br />
Malcolm Scott served as a Senator for Western Australia from<br />
1950-71. He was Minister for Customs and Excise 1968-69 in<br />
the Gorton Government.<br />
In recognition of Malcolm Scott's distinguished contribution<br />
to Australia and as a mark of respect, the Government will<br />
accord him a State Funeral.<br />
The service will be held at the Anglican Church of St<br />
Michael, Mount Pleasant, Perth, on Wednesday 7 June, at<br />
2.00 pm, followed by a burial in the Fremantle Cemetery.<br />
As a further mark of respect, the Australian National Flag<br />
will be flown at half mast in Western Australia and the<br />
Australian Capital Territory on Wednesday, 7 June, the day<br />
of the State Funeral. </p>
