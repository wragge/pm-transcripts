    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I congratulate Japan's new Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</p>
<p>Australia counts Japan among its very best friends. We are democracies that have shared interests in a stable and prosperous Asia-Pacific region. In recent years, Australia and Japan have worked together during the financial crisis and in East Timor for the benefit of the region.</p>
<p>Japan and Australia have very strong economic ties. This country has great interests at stake in Japan's economic future. I welcome Mr Koizumi's proposals for economic reform, while acknowledging the difficult decisions that this course will require.</p>
<p>I wish Mr Koizumi every success as he takes on the ambitious programme of economic and political reform that he has foreshadowed.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will work very closely with Mr Koizumi's administration to deepen the strong cooperation between our two countries.</p>
<p>I will be writing to Mr Koizumi to give him my personal congratulations, and I look forward to meeting him personally in the near future.</p>
<p>I also record my thanks to the outgoing Prime Minister Mr Mori for his contribution to the bilateral relationship.</p>
