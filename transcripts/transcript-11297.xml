    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have accepted an invitation from the New Zealand Prime Minister,</p>
<p> Mrs Shipley, to visit New Zealand from 20 to 22 February. This will</p>
<p> reciprocate her visit to Australia last year shortly after her appointment</p>
<p> as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Few countries in the world share such a broad and enduring partnership</p>
<p> as Australia and New Zealand. The relationship is not just one of</p>
<p> parallel heritages, shared social values and convergent national interests.</p>
<p> It is also one of great personal warmth and affection, with strong</p>
<p> family links.</p>
<p>Aside from developments in Australia and New Zealand and our bilateral</p>
<p> relationship, Mrs Shipley and I will discuss the regional and global</p>
<p> challenges both our countries face. New Zealand's chairing in September</p>
<p> of the APEC leaders meeting will focus Asia-Pacific attention on the</p>
<p> trans-Tasman area and will provide an important opportunity to help</p>
<p> create the right conditions for a return to sustained growth in our</p>
<p> region.</p>
<p>I will hold talks with Mrs Shipley in Queenstown in the South Island</p>
<p> over the weekend and then meet the New Zealand cabinet, the leader</p>
<p> of the New Zealand Opposition and business leaders in Wellington on</p>
<p> Monday 22 February.</p>
<p>My government is committed to a close and productive relationship</p>
<p> with New Zealand.</p>
<p> 4 February 1999</p>
