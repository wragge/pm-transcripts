PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION'S<br />
NEW NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS<br />
CANBERRA 21 OCTOBER 1988<br />
One of the great sources of satisfaction I have had as Prime<br />
Minister for the past five and a half years is the capacity<br />
to oversee a project such as this the creation of these<br />
new national headquarters right through from planning to<br />
bricks and mortar.<br />
on this occasion, that sense of satisfaction and pride is<br />
heightened because this building represents an enduring and<br />
central element of the policies my Government promised to<br />
implement on our election to office in 1983.<br />
I want at the outset to pay tribute to the skill, dedication<br />
and vision of my colleague the Minister for Community<br />
Services and Health, Neal Blewett, who has overseen the<br />
health portfolio for the entire duration of this Government<br />
and indeed who formulated the Labor Party's health policy<br />
when we were in Opposition.<br />
Very few people in the history of the Australian Parliament<br />
can claim the expertise and insight into a major policy area<br />
that Neal Blewett can claim in health policy.<br />
Today's opening ceremony is something in which he would have<br />
enjoyed participating; I know you will sympathise with him,<br />
as I do, in understanding the reasons he is unable to be<br />
here. It's appropriate that our ministerial colleague, Ros Kelly,<br />
is here representing Neal. As the Member for Canberra, Ros<br />
has played a major role in the development of the<br />
Tuggeranong Town Centre a development to which this<br />
building represents a substantial new commitment.<br />
With the re-introduction of Medicare after its short-sighted<br />
termination by the previous Government, we put into place an<br />
absolutely critical part of our social justice strategy.<br />
That strategy is making Australia a fairer society a<br />
society in which the economic resources of the community are<br />
taxed fairly and distributed fairly, and where access to<br />
essential community services is available on equal terms to<br />
all Australians. 2851<br />
I </p>
<p>Just as our economic strategy has been about laying the<br />
groundwork for new prosperity in the community, our social<br />
justice strategy has been about distributing that prosperity<br />
fairly throughout the community.<br />
And just as our economic strategy during this tine of acute<br />
challenge has required us to tighten our belts and make the<br />
sacrifice of restraint, so our social justice strategy has<br />
meant ensuring that those necessary sacrifices have been<br />
shared, fairly, by all sections of the community.<br />
The fruits of this complenentary policy approach have been<br />
abundant including the creation of more than 1.1 million<br />
new jobs; a massive and continuing expansion in child care<br />
places; a steady and continuing improvement in the education<br />
and training opportunities for young people; real increases<br />
in age pensions; the Family Allowance Supplement for low<br />
income families; a massive extension of superannuation<br />
coverage.<br />
Among these many achievements the restoration of Medicare<br />
stands tall. Fairness and universality are the hallmarks of<br />
our social justice strategy; they are unquestionably the<br />
hallmarks of Medicare.<br />
With the re-introduction of Medicare, we brought back under<br />
the health care umbrella some two million Australians who<br />
under the system adopted by our predecessors had no health<br />
insurance. We were able to do this because we were determined Medicare<br />
would be funded fairly by funding it on the basis of a<br />
person's capacity to pay.<br />
In 1983 a family earning just above the Health Care Card<br />
limit had to pay more than seven per cent of its income on<br />
basic health cover, while a family on $ 50,000 a year paid<br />
only 1.4% of its income.<br />
By funding Medicare through an income-related levy, people<br />
contribute to health care in accordance with their capacity<br />
to pay.<br />
Furthermore, low income earners are excluded from paying the<br />
Medicare levy. For example, a married couple with two<br />
children on an income of $ 390 a week is exempt from the<br />
Medicare levy.<br />
Medicare also assists chronically ill people through paying<br />
heavy " gap" expenses which can be incurred by those who are<br />
in frequent need of medical services.<br />
All this of course amounts to a substantial contribution to<br />
the social wage Without Medicare an average family would<br />
need basic private health insurance costing, at 1987-88<br />
prices, $ 21.50 per week more than the $ 5.50 they now<br />
contribute to Medicare.<br />
2852 </p>
<p>3.<br />
At the same time, we have backed ou.' C'ommitme~ nt*. to Medicare<br />
with new support for Australia's hospi-tal* system. in the<br />
August Budget the Commonwealth embarkedo6n-anew five year<br />
program of hospital funding. Totalling $ 3 billion this year<br />
and to be increased by some $ 1.1 billion over-the next five<br />
years, this', program will be devoted*, to providing a more<br />
modern efficient hospital system:<br />
In addition, a new three year $ 175m Hospital. Enhancement<br />
Program starts in conjunction with the States this financial<br />
year. These funds will assist public hospitals to acquire<br />
new equipment so as to provide better services to those who<br />
need them.<br />
11l these initiatives represent the central thrust of the<br />
Government's approach to health policy.<br />
However, there is another side of health policy which is<br />
becoming increasingly important, as pressure builds on the<br />
use of resources within the health system. I refer to the<br />
area of preventative health measures.<br />
Prevention is better than cure yet for too long, too many<br />
Australiansliave undergone the cost and the suffering of<br />
preventable diseases.<br />
In the last Budget we commenced a National Better Health<br />
Program, to be cost-shared with the States and Territories,<br />
which is aimed at demonstrating that good health can be<br />
enhanced by adopting a commonsense attitude to the way we<br />
lead aur lives and especially through attention to<br />
nutrition, preventable cancers and injuries.<br />
It would not be appropriate to conclude even this cursory<br />
survey of health policy without acknowledging the efficiency<br />
and effectiveness of Medicare, Medibank Private and the<br />
Health Insurance Commission.<br />
By continually striving to improve its efficiency the<br />
Commission makes a vital contribution to ensuring all<br />
Australians have access to the best possible health<br />
insurance at the lowest possible cost.<br />
Despite its size, the HIC operates Medicare at a high Level<br />
of efficiency measured both in terms of short turnaround<br />
times in handling Medicare claims and in low administrative<br />
costs. This efficiency is reflected in consumer<br />
satisfaction people know and trust Medicare for its<br />
service and reliability.<br />
Medibank Private, too, can boast a proud record of<br />
efficiency and effectiveness, Starting from nothing on I<br />
October 1976 Medibank Private is now the largest and<br />
arguably the strongest health insurer in the community. it<br />
has achieved remarkable growth rates in membership and has<br />
developed substantial reserves. By March of this year, its<br />
market share for hospital membership was over 26 per cent<br />
and total reserves stood near $ 250m equivalent to more<br />
than five months of contribution income. 2853 </p>
<p>As befits a government business enterprise those reserves<br />
have been devoted to the public good. This has been<br />
achieved, in part, by placing pressure on health insurance<br />
premiums so as to ensure the lowest cost to the public<br />
and, in part, with the construction of these new<br />
headquarters. I would now like to declare the new headquarters for the<br />
Health Insurance Commission open and wish all who will use<br />
it continued success in their operations.<br />
