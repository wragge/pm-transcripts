16 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
LAUNCH OF GREEN CORPS PROJECT<br />
TINCHI TAMBA WET LANDS BRISBANE<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Elizabeth. To Senator Ian Macdonald, to Mr Tony Abbott, Teresa<br />
Gambaro, the member for Petrie; Gary Hardgrave the member for Moreton; the Mayor of<br />
the Shire of Radcliffe, representatives of the Brisbane City Council, other guests, ladies<br />
and gentlemcn. I'm really very pleased indeed to be associated with the formal launch of<br />
the Oreen Corps.<br />
It is appropriate that Tony Abbott is with us this morning because I have to give Tony<br />
some of the credit a couple of years ago way back when we were still in Opposition when<br />
we were talking about ideas and concepts that might fire the enthusiasm of people,<br />
particularly young people about Australia's environmental future. Tony Abbott spent<br />
some time putting ideas to me about the validity of having a Green Corps and I was very<br />
heavily influaenced by those views and it is appropriate is with us and is associated with<br />
the launch. This is yet another element of the Coalition's very strong commitment to<br />
caring for and being concerned about Australia's environment. There used to be a time in<br />
Austlia public life when the environment was regarded as an issue over on the side<br />
when it was only something that a small seemingly preoccupied group of people were<br />
interested in and it wasn't something that touched the everyday lives of people and that is<br />
why so many parts of our heritage fell into disrcpair and into disuse and why we now<br />
look back with some horror at the way in which we allowed environmental arocities to<br />
take place and how we allowed the envionment to be spoilt 16/ 04/ 97 13: 25 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from But in the last ten years all of that has changed. The environment is properly a<br />
mainstream political issue. All generations of Australians are concerned about restoring<br />
our physical environment, refurbishing our built environment and seeing what we can do<br />
to reverse over a longer period of time some the very negative and deleterious trends<br />
which have developed over many many years and are effecting our environment.<br />
And one of the policies of which I am particularly proud within the environmental area of<br />
course is our commitment through the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia to invest<br />
almost $ 1.2 billion into capital projects to restore the environment of Australia-A few<br />
weeks ago I had the opportunity of going to Mildura and of touching the Murray-Darling<br />
basin and cleaning up the Murray Darling basin will be of absolutely inestimable value to<br />
Australia's environment. It is the cradle of about one quarter of the food production of<br />
Australia and the contribution cleaning up the Murray Darling will make to the<br />
environmental future of Australia is immense and the sort of things that we are interested<br />
in in the environment are those practical things and what we have sought to do in relation<br />
to the Green Corps which is currently attracting an investment of $ 42 million from the<br />
Government. What we hope to do in the Green Corps is to many together the idealism in the interests<br />
of young Australians in caring for Australia's environment, provide to them an<br />
opportunity to learn skills about environmental care, provide to them the opportunity of<br />
friendship and association in caring for the environment in a very very healthy<br />
atmosphere, and what the Green Corps does is to marry those enthusiasms with our<br />
concern for the environment And it will provide people with good training, it will<br />
provide them with a useful subsidy at the end of the period of training, a useful subsidy<br />
towards further educational pursuits and it brings together what I might call the volunteer<br />
sector and also the government sector and I am very pleased that one of the features of<br />
this is that when we decided to go down the path of the Green Corps we called for tenders<br />
from the private sector from volunteer organisations. And if my understanding is correct<br />
the headquarters of the organisation which is managing the Green Corps is in fact in<br />
Ballarat in Victoria and I think I visited the headquarters when I was in Ballarat a few<br />
months ago and it won the tender from competition all around Australia. And what is also<br />
very good is that there's a local partnership and I want to thank the Brisbane City Council<br />
for its contribution. What it has done to restore, what it has already done to restore the<br />
Tinchi Tomba wetlands deserves very high praise and I particularly acknowledge in the<br />
presence of representatives of the Brisbane City Council the contribution that the Council<br />
has made to the restoration of the wetlands and also the willingness and the very<br />
enthusiastic way in which the council has gone into partnership with the volunteers for<br />
the environment to run this particular project and as lan Macdonald said, we are<br />
embarked upon a series of projects all around Australia and naturally and quite properly<br />
and there would be plenty of people in the audience who have seen to it that it has<br />
occurred Queensland is getting its fair share of all of those projects. I've never known it<br />
to be otherwise and I always acknowledge the enthusiastic pursuit of Queensland interests<br />
by my Senatorial and House of Representatives colleagues. 16/ 84/ 97 13: 25 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>I Fax from So I do want to say to all of you particularly ithose who are involved in the Green Corps<br />
tha it is one of those things that mixes a bit of idealism with a Practical goal atud a<br />
forward looking~ objective. And that is in a sense the stuff of good government decision<br />
making. You need a bit of idealism. You can't livc by bottom lines an~ d numbers and<br />
statistics alone, you do need sorne idealism and I think manryinig a concern for the<br />
environment with practical training in the outdoors and actually restoring something and<br />
making something look more attractive, more beautiful, it really is marrying together a<br />
number of objectives and I think the Green Corps will attract great interest. Certainly the<br />
early experience is that there are more people at present who want to be in the Green<br />
Corps who can at presenit be accommodated and that is something that will be born in<br />
mind by the government as the weeks and months go by and decisions in the fu. ture have<br />
to be made about the allocation of' resources because this is obviously going to be a very<br />
attractive programme.<br />
And I want to thank the young Australirans who have displayed an interes in it. The<br />
programme as you know is not just available to people who are out of work although it is<br />
obviously somnething of great interest and appeal to people who may be temporarily or<br />
perhaps for a longer period of time have been unemployed. It is open to all young<br />
Australians and both people who've been in the workforce and those who haven't have<br />
flocked to it. And I thank them and I have already met some of them and I hope to have<br />
the opportuity of meeting few more of them. But it is a very strong commitment by the<br />
Coalition Government, a very strong commitment by the Liberal and National parties for<br />
practical solutions to improving Australia's environment, marshalling enthusiam and<br />
idealisra of young Australians, providing them with incentives, practical goals, practical<br />
opportunities to learn AkiCl and the assurance at the cad of the training course of some<br />
assistance. So I want to thank you Ian in particular for the work that you have put into organising<br />
today-I want to thank you for the work that you in conjunctioni with Tony have done in<br />
overseeing and supervising at an administrative and political level the operation of the<br />
Green Corps. I thank all of those who have supported, I thank the department of<br />
Employment and Youth Affains, I also tharA the volunteer organisation whose<br />
representative will speak in a moment and most particularly I thank the participants and I<br />
have very great pleasure in formally declaring launched the Green Corps young<br />
Australians for the environment.<br />
Thank you. Fa rom16/ 04/ 97 13: 25 Pg: 3 </p>
