6 December 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
OFFICIAL OPENING OF AUSTRALIAN CRICKET HALL OF FAME<br />
MELBOURNE CRICKET GROUND<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Tony; to Dr Lill; to Dennis Lillee and Keith Miller; to the<br />
other family members of the other, the other eight members of this unique band of<br />
crioketing brothers; to Tom Reynolds, the Victorian Minister for Sport. And I<br />
acknowledge the presence of three formier Victorian Premiers: Dick Harrer,<br />
Lindsay Thompson and John Cain.<br />
Earlier today I inspected the restorations of St Patrick's Cathedral and I said to the<br />
Archbishop as I was leaving I was going to one of the spiritual centres of<br />
Melbourne, to the true temporal shrine and sporting shrine, not only of Melbourne<br />
but also of Australia.<br />
I think without any doubt the Melbourne Cricket Ground is the greatest sporting<br />
arena in our nation and I think probably without comparison anywhere in the<br />
world. And it's a special privilege for me to be here today. Being Prime Minister<br />
has its ups and downs. Could I say this is really an up. To be here, to be invited to<br />
say a few words, to open this Hall of Fame is for me about the greatest of pleasure<br />
and privilege that I could possibly have.<br />

<p>I am a self-confessed cricket lover. Like so many people of my age, I started at<br />
a time when following cricket, at a time when cricket books weren't quite as<br />
prolific as they are now, and two that I read and read again and thumbed<br />
through repeatedly was that wonderful book written by Johnnie Moyes in the<br />
early 1950s called " A Century of Cricketers", which not only traced the story<br />
of many famous Australian cricketers but also English and a few West Indian,<br />
South African and Indian cricketers as well,<br />
Arnd I was reflecting as I watched those names go up that there's only one of<br />
them, and that's the last one, Dennis Lillee, that was not in that book, and the<br />
other one that influenced in a Journalistic way my love and knowledge of<br />
cricket was one that was jointly authored by Keith Miller and RS. Whidttington<br />
called " Straight Hit" which was essentially about the 1951-52 West Indian tour<br />
of Australia. I have seen four of them of those ten play. I saw Don Bradman<br />
play but once at the Kippax-Oldfield testimonial at the Sydney Cricket Ground<br />
in 194.9. It was his last appearance at the Sydney Cricket Ground, At the age<br />
of 10 1 was taken there by my father on the Sydney Cricket Gifound hill.<br />
I really saw a great deal as a young boy, a great deal of Keith and Ray and I<br />
suppose if I had as a boy growing up following the game if I had two heroes<br />
it was them because their menacing combination, and I don't think there's<br />
anybody in the game we've seen who could turn it around so quickly as Keith<br />
in his capacity to take that sensational catch, that brilliant piecc of fielding, that<br />
marvellous burst of speed and Ray of course was the consummate artisan when<br />
it came that rhythmic approach to the wicket I've never seen anything like it<br />
and it really was for me a tremendous excitement to watch them play in the<br />
early 1950s. Dennis' contribution to cricket in a subsequent generation has<br />
been absolutely massive and he and his colleagues of that era brought new<br />
generations of lovers and followers of the game.<br />
I wouldn't have en vied the challenge of those who had to choose these ten<br />
players. It would have been a formidable task and can I say that I don't think<br />
anybody could argue for a moment with any of the selections that they have<br />
made. -But cricket is a magnificent game. It's more than that. It's a way of life<br />
to manly ofus it is another religion. I don't know a game which keeps people<br />
together in a fraternity quite like cricket does. I watch cricketers of different<br />
generations, and the capacity to, because of you common love of the game, the<br />
capacity to spend time talking to each other. I never saw Bill O'Reilly play but<br />
I did have the privilege of meeting Bill on a number of occasions when we<br />
were watching matches at the cricket ground and the way ixx which the<br />
difference i age and generations and backgrounds were just instantly dissolved<br />
by a common love of the game. 2<br />

<p>I think Australia's sporting achievements are something of which all of us are<br />
incredibly proud. As cricket lovers and cricket followers today, the<br />
contribution that these ten magnificent players and their fellow players of their<br />
respective eras have made to enriching the lives and bringing happiness and<br />
pleasure to so many millions of Australians can never be properly described.<br />
And can I say to all of those who are here today, in the case of Keith and<br />
Dennis as recipients of this rare honour and in relation to the others as close<br />
relatives of the other eight men that have been inducted, can I say on behalf of<br />
a very grateful Australian nation, thank you for what you have done for a<br />
magnificent game. Thank you for what you have done to promote the best<br />
traditions of Australian sportsmanship, and thank you for the joy and pleasure<br />
that you and yours have brought over more than a century to millions of<br />
Australians and to millions of people around the world who love the game of<br />
cricket. Can I say again what a tremendous privilege it is to be here today to honour<br />
this great game and to honour these ten great men, and I have very great<br />
pleasure in declaring the cricketing hall of fame open.<br />
