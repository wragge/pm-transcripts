NEW UiALA'TC TOUR 1967<br />
TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THlE PRIE MINISTER.<br />
MU. HAROLL HOLT~, AT WVELLINGTON, NEVJ ZEALAND 3RD PEBRUARY, 1967<br />
Prime Minister, I woul. like to begin by referring to a<br />
statement you made yesterday and then repeated today. You said<br />
a visit to New Zealand was the first of your priorities for<br />
this New Year. Now, among Australia's foreign policy commitments,<br />
how high does the relationship with New Zealand rank as a<br />
priority?<br />
PM: Very high, because we are linked as partners and allies in such<br />
agreements as ANZUS and SEATO, which bear on the security of<br />
both our countries in this area of the world. We work together<br />
in such schemes as the Colombo Plan. We are in the Asian<br />
and South Pacific Association of Countries, and the Asian<br />
Development Bank. We are working together on the Commission in<br />
the South Pacific. In so m~ any directions we have common interests,<br />
common purposes to serve. At gatherings of Prime Ministers,<br />
Australia and New Zealand usually have rather similar attitudes<br />
in fact, very similar attitudes to the issues which arise there,<br />
so it becomes very desirable that with so much to be served in<br />
common we should work as closely together as we can.<br />
Does this working closely together go as far as seeking the<br />
advice of one country or another before you make a major foreigni<br />
policy decision?<br />
PM: It does on matters which concern us both. We keep in very close<br />
touch with this country.<br />
To perpetuate the following up of these common purposes to which<br />
you refer, do you see any value in setting up some sort of<br />
permanent consultative machinery, like a Secretariat?<br />
PM: There was thought given to that, as you will recall.. Back in<br />
1944 there was a suggestion for a regular process of<br />
consultation. I think, though, that the subsequent developments<br />
have largely nullified the need for this, because we do cone<br />
together for so many of the other purposes that I have mentionedat<br />
various levels of Government, Ministers, Prime Ministers, and<br />
Officials for such matters as those I have mentioned, and I<br />
think what we need is not so much the formal machinery for<br />
consultation but a desire and expression of that desire to be in<br />
closer consultation, regular consultation with each other. I<br />
may say that so far as the Prime Minister and myself are concerned<br />
we met last year on three sets of meetings, and we developed a<br />
process of telephone consultation which I think was useful for<br />
both of us.<br />
This does raise a point, doesn't it the personality issue.<br />
If, for example, you did not get on well with Mjr Holyoake,<br />
cooperation between Australia and New Zealand might not be as<br />
great as would be desirable for both countries, and that is why,<br />
surely, there is one reason for setting up some sort of permanent<br />
machinery so that the consultation is always there and not / 2 </p>
<p>dependent on personalities.<br />
PMll First of all, I think it highly unlikely there would not be a<br />
friendly feeling between the leaders of our two countries and<br />
this is irrespective of politics, I might say. Australians get<br />
on well with New Zealanders, and vice versa. But there would be<br />
consultation of an official kind at the various levels involved<br />
in all these activities Colombo Plan, Development Bank, ASPAC,<br />
and whatever else is in discussion at the time.<br />
In the past and now, of course, as you have just outlined,<br />
Australia and New Zealand have often forged general policies and,<br />
going back to 19) 4g again, for example, in the Canberra Pact there<br />
was a definite attempt then to get a joint policy so that both<br />
countries could hope to exercise some sort of influence on the<br />
great powers. Now, I wonder if you would agree with the argument<br />
that both countries to a certain extent have lost some independence<br />
in foreign policy-making because of their wish to shelter<br />
under the American Nuclear Umbrella?<br />
PM: Well, any less independence now than we used to have in the days<br />
when the Rritish Navy protected us both? I can remember a charge<br />
being levelled against a Government I supported that we were<br />
clinging to the skirts of Domning Street, and now people are<br />
saying that we are going American: as I said the other day at an<br />
Australia Day gathering, we are not going American we are going<br />
Australian. Any country which is not able to protect itself from<br />
its own resources, I suppose, could be said to have sacrificed<br />
some degree of its independence, but isn't that true of every<br />
country which goes into the United Nations? It is influenced<br />
very considerably by the discussions and the decisions which come<br />
iron the United Nations. It is a little old-fashioned now, I<br />
think, to speak in terms or think in teims of complete independence<br />
in what is becoming an increasingly interdependent world.<br />
On the other hand, I am quite certain that both Australia and<br />
New Zealand are able to exert an influence out of all proportion<br />
to our numbers on the great powers, certainly on the United<br />
Kingdom and the United States.<br />
Because they agree with the United States or the United Kingdom<br />
and tend to participate in the policies that both of these powers<br />
are enunciating for example, the presence of Australian and<br />
New Zealand f'orces in Viet Nam?<br />
PlhI: No, I think it is becalise of the special position we occupy in<br />
this region of the world the fact that we can form a bridge<br />
of cooperation and understanding, sometimes in situations where<br />
the great powers cannot. I could illustrate this by our<br />
situation with Cambodia. Wie represent the United States in<br />
Cambodia, and we represent Cambodia in South Viet Nam. Now, no<br />
great power would have been as welcome to Cambodia for this<br />
purpose as we have proved to be. There is a feeling amongst<br />
several of the countries of this region that we do not possess<br />
the legacy of a colonial power past, that each of our countries<br />
is striving to develop resources and thereby set some sort of an<br />
example to others who have their uevelopment ahead of them.<br />
It is known that we are on good terms with such powers as the<br />
United Kingctoim and the United States. All of these things help<br />
to build our influence on the other countries, and that influence<br />
on them makes us a valuable ally for the United States and the<br />
United Kingdom. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Over the last two or three years especially there has been a<br />
marked increase, it seemed to us here, in Australian activity<br />
in Asia, and this too has coincided with greater American<br />
interest in that area, and it would appear at least it has<br />
coincided with a declining British influence in the area. Do<br />
you think these three factors are all intertwined together2<br />
PM: I would not regard our interest as being so much a product of<br />
American interest. I would claim that American interest has<br />
increased in Asia because of the discussions and influences that<br />
we have been able to bring to the United States. I had a very<br />
good illustration of that last year when in the space of a<br />
fortnight I had two visits to Washington, and in between those<br />
visits, I having stressed the value that the other countries on<br />
the periphery of Asia were deriving from the American<br />
participation in Viet Nam, the President invited me back, and<br />
just before I returned he made a very significant speech which<br />
I think took the United States further into Asia than any American<br />
President previously had done, not only in a military sense, but<br />
a virtual assurance that in the positive tasks of peace America<br />
would be giving constructive and substantial assistance.<br />
Finally, Prime M. inister, do you see Australia as taking over the<br />
role in Asia that Britain seems to be abandoning?<br />
PM: I doubt whether Australia has the resources to do this. We are<br />
trying to do a great deal, but after all we are a developing<br />
country ourselves: we are a capital importing country. We see a<br />
growing involvement for ourselves in Asia and would expect to be<br />
making a growing contribution, preferably in circimstances of<br />
peace but if necessary towards the security of the area. But<br />
after all, wie are only a people of less than 12,000,000 at the<br />
present time, and while I said, talking at the lunch at Parliament<br />
House, that because of our productivity we do rate very much<br />
higher than n..-mbers would suggest, still we do not class ourselves<br />
as a major power.<br />
Interviewer Prime Minister, thank you very much. </p>
