SECOND READING SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
( SIR ROBERT MENZIES)<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.<br />
UNIVERSITIES ( FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1963.<br />
Introductory<br />
This Bill and the States Grants ( Universities) Bill,<br />
which will follow immediately, are related and for convenience<br />
and clarity my speech now will refer to both the Universities<br />
( Financial Assistance) Bill and the States Grants ( Universities)<br />
Bill. The report of the Australian Universities Commission<br />
covering the period 1961-66 and the consequent legislation now<br />
introduced into this House are stages in a procedure which has<br />
now become a well-established feature of the relationship<br />
between the Commonwealth Government on the one hand and the<br />
State Governments and State universities on the other.<br />
Honourable members will recall that, having received<br />
the report of the Murray Committee in 1957, Parliament passed<br />
legislation by which grants were made to the States for their<br />
universities in the three years 1958-1960. Similarly, on<br />
receipt of the first report of the Universities Commission in<br />
1960, Parliament agreud to legislation authorizing greatly<br />
increased grants to the States for their universities during<br />
the years 1961-63.<br />
I have now tabled the Universities Commission's<br />
second report and am very pleased to introduce a Bill under<br />
which we will offer financial assistance to the States for<br />
their universities at a higher lovl than ever before.<br />
Though the Commission is now a firmly-established<br />
statutory authority o-the Commonwealth, it is worthwhile<br />
taking a little time to recall the terms of Section 14 of the<br />
Act which set it up. It reads:-<br />
The Commission shall perform its functions with<br />
a view to promoting the balanced development of<br />
universities so that their resources can be used<br />
to the greatest possible advantage of Australia.<br />
2. For the purpose of the performance of its<br />
functions, the Commission shall consult with<br />
universities and with the States upon the matters<br />
on which it is empowered to furnish information<br />
and advice. i'<br />
The Commission's responsibilities, therefore, are<br />
much broader and more significant for educational developments<br />
at the tertiary level than they would be were it merely a body<br />
charged with making financial recommendations in connection<br />
with the universities. From 1959 to 1962, Sir Leslie Martin,<br />
the full-time Chairman of the Co, imission, was assisted by four<br />
part-time Commissioners, but from June of the latter year two<br />
additicnal part-time Commissioners were appointed in recognition<br />
of the Commission's growing responsibilities and fields<br />
of interest. The present membership is </p>
<p>Sir Leslie Martin<br />
Professor N. S. Bayliss<br />
Mr. K. B. Myer<br />
Professor S. Sunderland<br />
Professor A. D. Trendall<br />
Dr. J. Vernon<br />
Sir Kenneth Wills<br />
To all of these gentlemen, we are greatly indebted for a most<br />
valuable report. It follows from what I have said that the report is<br />
not merely a financial document. It has much to say of the<br />
educatienal problems confronting the universities. The<br />
Commission's conclusions on these are such that it attaches<br />
great importance to the outcome of the painstaking inquiry<br />
currently being undertaken into the future pattern of tertiary<br />
education by a committee of the Commission specially appointed<br />
for that purpose in 1961.<br />
Although not a matter covered by the present Bill,<br />
there arc recommendations in the report for development during<br />
the coming triennium at the Australian National University.<br />
As is customary with this institution, which is wholly a<br />
Commonwealth responsibility, decisions are reached during the<br />
annual debates on the Commonwealth budget. Nevertheless, I<br />
may say at this stage that, in general and subject to normal<br />
annual budgetary provision, my Government accepts the<br />
recommendations of the Commission for the Australian National<br />
University. Some Major Features of the Report.<br />
Students It seems to me appropriate that I should refer first<br />
to the students. In general, the Commission finds that the<br />
1964-66 triennium will bring still greater demands on the<br />
universities to provide more places for more students at both<br />
under-graduate and post-graduate levels. In the words of the<br />
report " an increasing proportion of secondary school students<br />
are staying on at school for the final year, and increasing<br />
numbers are going on to enrol at universities." If we consider<br />
the equivalent full-time enrolments at universities, that is<br />
if we make certain allowances for part-time and external<br />
students, the numbers are expected to rise from about 53,000<br />
in 1963 to about 74,000 in 1966. This is an increase of<br />
21,000 equivalent full-time students, or 40%, in three years.<br />
Staff More students require more staff. The Commission<br />
estimates that about 2,000 additional academic staff will be<br />
needed to cope with this increase if the present staff/<br />
student ratio is maintained. For comparison, it should be<br />
noted that between 1960 and 1963, the increase in equivalent<br />
full-time students was 11,000 2nd in equivalent full-time </p>
<p>staff 1,000. Demographic factors are such that some<br />
slackening in the rate of increase in student numbers is<br />
predicted from 1966 onward.<br />
Some Achievements Despite the heavy pressures of student numbers on<br />
them and the difficulties they have met in recruiting<br />
sufficient qualified academic staff, the universities have<br />
been able to achieve much since the first effects of the<br />
Murray Report were felt in 1958. They have greatly improved<br />
their buildings and equipment and have been able to provide<br />
for almost all of the students seeking admission, including<br />
the onrolment of large numbers of overseas students nearly<br />
3,500 in 1962. It will be noted with much satisfaction that<br />
graduation rates are significantly better nowadays than they<br />
were a few years ago. Of those who entered our universities<br />
in 1951, some 57% graduated; of those who entered in 1956,<br />
some 70% graduated. It will be remembered that enrolmonts<br />
have greatly increased over this period. Thus not only is<br />
our output of graduates increasing but the percentage of our<br />
young people who graduate is also rising.<br />
Of great significanco for future leadership in<br />
research and teaching is the fact that there were nearly five<br />
times as many higher degree students in 1962 as there were in<br />
1953; and the universities expect this figure to double again<br />
by 1966.<br />
Matters for Anxiety<br />
Points of considerable anxiety remain. The Commission<br />
has doubts whether the universities will find it practicable<br />
to recruit enough qualified academic staff for the coming<br />
triennium. The imposition of quotas has become a feature of<br />
the universities but the Commission reports that except for<br />
all faculties of medicine, other than that of Queensland,<br />
restrictions on entry have been significant only in the four<br />
universities in Sydney and Melbourne. In consequence, therefore,<br />
the Commission recommends additional grants in the<br />
1964-66 triennium beyond those first contemplated to enable<br />
the University of New South Wales and Monach University to<br />
accept students who might otherwise have to be excluded.<br />
Provision is also recommended for greatly increased medical<br />
training facilities at the University of Melbourne and for<br />
the establishment during the trionnium of a faculty of<br />
medicine at the University of Tasmania.<br />
Research Conscious of the national need for greatly increased<br />
attention to research, particularly in the fields of science<br />
and technology, the Commission has recommended greatly<br />
increased expenditure on research and for the provision of<br />
computing facilities at universities.<br />
Student Residences In order that students living outside the centres in<br />
which universities are situated should have a reasonable<br />
opportunity of taking advantage of the greatly increased </p>
<p>provision for university education, it is essential that<br />
greatly increased provision should be made for student<br />
residences. The Commission has therefore recommended expenditure<br />
for this purpose which should lift the proportion<br />
of the full-time student population in residence from about<br />
14% at the end of 1963 to over 16% at the end of 1966.<br />
Recurrent and Capital Expenditure<br />
As always, of course, the main heads of expenditure<br />
at universities are those for recurrent items, such as<br />
salaries and minor items of equipment and so on, and capital<br />
development. Naturally, with rapidly growing student<br />
numbers and related staff growth, big increases in recurrent<br />
expenditure are inevitable. Further capital expenditure is<br />
also inevitable but it will be noted that if the residential<br />
component is excluded, the cost of buildings recommended by<br />
the Commission for 1964-66 will be not much more thae the<br />
cost of those erected in the present triennium. The House<br />
will be interested to know that the Commission proposes no<br />
change in the relationship between Commonwealth and State<br />
contributions for on the capital side and Å 1 ( Commonwealth)<br />
to Å 1.85 ( State grants plus students' fees) for recurrent<br />
expenditure. Report Necessarily Incomplete<br />
Before giving the House a summary of the financial<br />
implications of the report, I should mention that in two<br />
respects it is incomplete. The introduction of Commonwealth<br />
assistance for teoching hospitals dates only from 1962. Since<br />
the completion of the investigation on which that assistance<br />
was made, the Commission has been fully engaged with its<br />
inquiries into the more firmly established pattern of<br />
assistance and has therefore postponed until next year its<br />
recommendations for assistance to teaching hospitals in the<br />
coming triennium. In the second place, the recommendations<br />
of the Commission are based on Commonwealth support to the<br />
States for recurrent expenditure using the salo scale of<br />
academic salaries as was adopted from December, 1960. This<br />
was based on a standard professorial salary of Å 4250. This<br />
is a matter on which I shall have more to say in a few<br />
minutes. Summary of Financial Recormmndations<br />
Tb sunmarise the financial implications for the<br />
Commonwealth of the Commission's recommendations for assistance<br />
to the States for their universities, I ask honourable<br />
members to note the following figures for 1964-66 and the<br />
comparisons with 1961-63; For general recurrent expenditure:<br />
Å 37.7 m. an increase c'f about Å 12 m. over the provision in<br />
the present trienniu; For buildings and furnishings, other<br />
than student residences; Å 15.7 m. an increase of about<br />
Å 1 For research and computers Å 2.9 m. an increase<br />
of Å 2.4 For building and furnishing halls of residence<br />
and affiliated colleges: Å 3.4 m. an increase of nearly<br />
Å 2 For recurrent expenditure in the halls of residence<br />
and affiliated colleges; Å 700,000 an increase of Å 200,000.<br />
From the figures I have just given, it will be clear<br />
that acceptance of the Commission's present recommendations<br />
would require the Commonwealth to offer to the States over<br />
m. for their universities during the coming triennium. </p>
<p>This is an increase of nearly Å 16 m. over the Commonwealth<br />
money provided during the present trionnium. To attract<br />
this e. ount, the total of State grants and students' fees<br />
in all of the State universities would need to be over<br />
m. an increase of more than Å 25 n. on the corresponding<br />
amount for State grants and students' fees in the present<br />
trionnium. It is worth noting in this context that universities'<br />
income from students' fees over the coming triennium is<br />
expected to be nearly Å 20 m.<br />
Commonwealth Government Decisions on the Universities<br />
Commission's Report.<br />
Subject to certain matters which I shall mention<br />
shortly, the Government accepts the financial recommendations<br />
of the Commission, and the present Bill is intended to give<br />
legal effect to an offer to the States on that basis.<br />
I have written to the Premiers and told them of the<br />
Government's intentions with regard to the Commission's<br />
financial recommendations. It is appropriate that I should<br />
emphasise that it is the State Governments which have the<br />
major responsibility for the development of universities<br />
within their borders. But it is a source of much satisfaction<br />
to all concerned that the State Governments readily accept the<br />
Universities Commission as an exp rt body to which they can<br />
turn for advice on matters affecting university development.<br />
I have already indicated that provision for teaching<br />
hospitals and for increases in academic salaries above the<br />
levels which have been in effect since the end of 1960 will<br />
add to the total Lmounts rccormmnded in the report and adopted<br />
in this Bill. There is in addition the report shortly to be presented<br />
by the Commission's Comnittee on the Future of Tertiary<br />
Education. The Commission attaches great importance to the<br />
outcome of this investigation into the pattcrn of educational<br />
facilities over the whole filld at the tertiary level. The<br />
Government has no doubt that the problems with which the<br />
Committee is concerned and the recommendations which the<br />
Commission will make in consequence are of great significance<br />
for the provisions to be made in the future for universities.<br />
Honourable members will note that the Commission is<br />
recommending a grant of Å 5 m. on a for basis as between<br />
the Commnonwealth and the States, to support special additional<br />
research activities at the post-graduate level. However, the<br />
Cormission has yet to complete its study of the distribution<br />
of these funds and recommends, in the first instance, a<br />
distribution of Å 1 m. in the proportion shown in Table 60 of<br />
the report. The Comr. onwealth is ready to accept the<br />
Commission's proposals for the initial Å 1 n. on the understanding<br />
that the funds shall not be used, in substitution, to<br />
finance research activity already supported from the general<br />
funds of universities or from other sources and shall not be<br />
used in such a way as to compete with the Commonwealth postgraduate<br />
awards or similar schemes for assisting post-graduate<br />
research students. We have postponed a decision on the<br />
balance of the Comission's research proposals until it has </p>
<p>completed its study. . o would hope shortly to take an<br />
opportunity to look at the wholo question of Commonwealth<br />
involveennt in research in Australia.<br />
With regard to the reconmendation for affiliated<br />
colloAs and halls of residonce, we accept that there is a<br />
need for additional student residences and we have no quarrel<br />
with the total scale of assistance suggested in the report in<br />
Table 68. However, we do wish to ensurc that, within this<br />
assistanco, affiliated colleges should have access equally<br />
with halls of residence and on a for basis. Our<br />
acceptance of the total amounts shown at Table 68 is on that<br />
basis and I shall be discussing with the Universities<br />
Cormission the practical consequences of this decision. Our<br />
approach on this matter has been influenced by the considcrations<br />
that affiliated colleges are traditionally a part of the<br />
Australian university systoe, have played an outstanding role<br />
over the years and, for each student in residence, nake a<br />
smaller oemand on the public purse.<br />
The Bill to Amend the Existing States<br />
rants ( Univoruities) Act.<br />
Before leaving the subject of affiliated residential<br />
colleges, I take the opportunity to explain to the House why<br />
the Bill to amend the existing States Grants ( Universities)<br />
Act is necessary. The original Act provided for Commonwealth grants<br />
totalling Å 1 n. for affiliated rcsidential colleges and in<br />
Schedule 4 the amount available for colleges at each of the<br />
universitios concerned was specified. As things turned out,<br />
plans for affilinted colleges at the University of Now South<br />
Wales have cone to ncthing in the present trienniiu. Vio are<br />
thereforo left with the choice of scinll the appropriation<br />
lapse or of making it possible to distribute the Å 150,000<br />
involved, according to the judgment of the Commission, among<br />
other affiliated residential colloges which have the necessary<br />
matching funds at their disposal. Vie h-ve thought it profcrable<br />
to mako the money available and the Bill provides<br />
accordingly. Academic Salarics.<br />
I turn now to the probl; i of acdeoic salarios. As<br />
already pointed out, the recurrent grants reconmonded by the<br />
Commission have boon calculated using a scale of academic<br />
salaries based on a standard profossorial ratu of Å 4,250 p. a.<br />
While noting developnrnts affecting acacdonic salaries, the<br />
Comr. lission is unwilling, in present circumstancoo, to suggest<br />
new salary levels. The Cornr ission takes the view that it<br />
should not be the salary fixing body for the universities of<br />
Australia and the Government agrees with this view.<br />
\ 7 have given careful thought to the matter of<br />
salaries. ' 7J are aware of the increases, and claims for<br />
increascs, in acaeonic salaries which have followed the<br />
decision of the New South Ulos Industrial Corlnission. Even<br />
before this, the univcruitics, through their Staff Associations<br />
and Vico-Chancellors, had rprescnted to us that current<br />
salaries should be roviewed and that for this purpose it was<br />
desirable to have soue mnchinory, on an Australin-wide basis,<br />

Mlain Provision of the Bills<br />
The Univritics ( Finncil Assistance) Bill<br />
The trms are simil. r in moot respects to those of<br />
oxisting-legislation in this ficld. As thsec are fa--iliar to<br />
honourable member, I shanll confine myself to pointing out some<br />
of the more significant changes.<br />
It bins been found posciblo to simplify the legislation<br />
in scom imzportant respects. The m. oot important of these is<br />
in Section 3 and the related First Schedule. The C: LeiSsion<br />
has recommended, the a-bolitiion of the system! of first and scond<br />
level grrmnts for cneral recurrent expniture. This system ims<br />
introduced oririnolly to ensure a inimum level of funds for<br />
State universitie s. ' 2e concur in the Comrision's reco= enddation<br />
for its abolition. Vlith the now lon-estCablishol rolationships<br />
betwcon the Com-. onwealth and Statos in university ma! iLttcrs, we<br />
re confident that the-ned fcr such a scf rua rd no longEr exists.<br />
The reforencec;. -to sa laries in Section 4-rer based on the<br />
figurs usc' by tho Co-' mmission whc-n calculating the levels of<br />
recurrent expnditure,, wichh-the Comonwalth should support in<br />
each yea-r of the tricnniuri. As I hCve alredy indicated, the<br />
Gvorn"' ent h'-s decided to support hig-hcr salary lvels ran d<br />
therfcrc rreator recurront expendliture, but has not rooched<br />
finality on the levels it vill support over the trienniu. It<br />
has not been practicable in the tie vonilcable to r calculate<br />
the figures in the Firt Schoed: ule, nor, in view of the arrangcrients<br />
we haive in m-iind was it thoug,, ht worthwhile to do so -t this<br />
stage. In due course, opproprinte2 oning legislation -ill be<br />
introduced. The most uignificant cha, nge in Section 5 and, the<br />
related Second Schedcule dealing, with g-rants for expenditure on<br />
univorsity building projects etc., is thart for each building<br />
project the Sur.-specified contain on appropriate llowance for<br />
furnishing nd equipping the buildlin. The Commission is givcn<br />
the power to op1) provc the, proprtion spe) cnt on the actual building<br />
and on furnishing andl equippin[ g it. It sjhould olso be noted that<br />
provision for conmputing, fa. cilities appears in the Second<br />
Scheulo. As I ha-; lrerOdy me. ntione, Section 6 ande the Third<br />
Schedule 1oling with special pest-grnouo t rssorch activitis<br />
