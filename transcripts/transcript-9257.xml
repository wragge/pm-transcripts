PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, REGENT HOTEL, MELBOURNE, 15 JUNE 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM; I Well, in the first day of Parliament I said I thought it was a very<br />
disappointing thing that Alexander Downer who said he was going to<br />
make a fresh start, startedhii-s fresh start by flattening the new person<br />
he gave Aboriginal policy to, who dared to say that she would consider<br />
the Liberal party's support for the Government's proposed Aboriginal<br />
Land Fund. And, I would have thought that any Opposition party<br />
looking for a fresh start in society given the obscurantist views which<br />
Dr Hewson held on some of these issues, that Mr Downer would have<br />
taken them up. He didn't. I was interested to see the Anglican church<br />
spokesman today say that they would be critical of an Opposition that<br />
voted against the Land Fund because the point I'd made is " What is<br />
their objection?" it is not a fiscal objection. They know that Aboriginal<br />
people can secure land from Mabo if they have a traditional<br />
connection with the land, but if they have been dispossessed of the<br />
land the only way they can benefit is not by the Mabo Native Title<br />
legislation, but by an acquisition program under the Land Fund. So,<br />
what is the point of objection other than they don't want to give black<br />
people land.<br />
J: Opposition spokesperson Chris Gallus said today that any change<br />
wouldn't come until just before the next federal election.<br />
PMV: Yes, well, I think that is high cynicism for Downer to be around now<br />
saying oh, look, I'm opposed to this, the first thing I did as Opposition<br />
leader was quash the Land Fund, but I might consider it on the day<br />
before the election. We all just should say don't give us that cynical<br />
tripe Alexander, don't give us that.<br />
J: Mr Keating, will there be a loosening up of the community rating at all<br />
in health? </p>
<p>PM: No, I knocked that on the head yesterday, no.<br />
J: Prime Minister, in your speech-inside you said that it was hoped that<br />
by the year 2001, 95 per cent of 19 year olds would have completed<br />
Year 12 or post-school qualification. How many of those do you<br />
expect will have jobs to go to?<br />
PM: Well, I think as the economy what we found in the 1 980s, which is<br />
our last experience of this, if you get strong aggregate employme -nt-.<br />
trained people get jobs. I think the lesson of it is, that we want people<br />
trained and that's why we've invested so much in higher throughput in<br />
education, higher retention rates and a higher transference into tertiary<br />
institutions and now, lately, into TAFE.<br />
J: Can you put a figure on how many..<br />
PM: No, no.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Well, more broadly what I'd like to see is a better understanding of the<br />
Australian constitution, of the elements of our democracy, the ethos of<br />
our democracy,-these are things which, I think, should be well and truly<br />
transmitted in school and we are looking at ways now how we can<br />
improve the understanding of these primary things, these primary<br />
instruments of our Governments.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you said in your speech that you'd like to strengthen the<br />
role of ANTA, how important is that change going to be in achieving<br />
the educational goals you set out today?<br />
PM: I think vocational training has been the Cinderella of Australian<br />
education and the Government has now got very substantially<br />
increased retention rates in secondary school. As I've said, we've<br />
created 17 universities since the middle 1980s, but the weak link in<br />
Australian education is vocational education -and.. training. This we<br />
tried to remedy and it's started to remedy in the One Nation statement<br />
of 1992 where we put together the Australian National T raining.<br />
Authorityand committed over $ 1 billion to growth within the sector.<br />
What we want to see is that sector working more closely with<br />
industries so that the training profile of industry better fits the well,<br />
put it this way, that TAFE's training profile better fits the profile of<br />
industry so that we are getting people trained with accredited<br />
certificates which they can use nationally and which really help<br />
business in their skills formation.<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you concerned about the recent rise in the<br />
Australian dollar and do you believe that it is justified? </p>
<p>PM: I'm not here to comment on the exchange rate. I did get asked do<br />
you work for Knight Ridder or something do you? I get all these<br />
weirdos who work for Knight Ridder ask me at doorstops about the<br />
exchange rates and interest rates.<br />
J: Mr Keating, with this actual group you are thinking of going to teach<br />
students more about should that actually involve an education about<br />
the republic and about the implications<br />
PM: I think, learning about the constitution apprises people of the fact that<br />
we've got a constitution which was designed by the British foreign<br />
office to look over the Australian government's shoulder. I mean, that<br />
will become very obvious when anyone goes through it. Now, the<br />
Statute of Westminster changed a lot of that, but it didn't change a lot<br />
of the thinking about the Australian constitution. I don't think a lot of<br />
people know about it. For instance, the Australian Cabinet is not<br />
mentioned in the Constitution yet, it is the central agency of change in<br />
our democratic structures outside of the Parliament. So, just to know<br />
about those things, I think, is important. This, I think, will lead to<br />
people questioning the structure we have. Now, as you know I'm all<br />
for that. That is, I believe that as I said yesterday, I'm sure Australia<br />
will become a republic, it is only a matter of time, but Alexander<br />
Downer along with Malcolm Fraser, along with Menzies, along with the<br />
others of his ilk believe that the Australian nation remodelling itself,<br />
resetting itself in the Asia-Pacific should have the head of state of<br />
another country as our head of state. As I quoted yesterday the<br />
Economist magazine, just in passing in a line which was in a column<br />
last week it said only colonies borrow the monarchies of other<br />
countries. Now, we are not a colony, but we are still borrowing the<br />
monarchy of another country.<br />
J: What about the flag issue?<br />
PM: I've said heaps about that.<br />
ends </p>
