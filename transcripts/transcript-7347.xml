PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA1 JULY 1988<br />
Today marks the twentieth anniversary of the opening for<br />
signature of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear<br />
Weapons ( NPT).<br />
The NPT is the basis of international efforts to prevent the<br />
spread of nuclear weapons. The Treaty makes a major<br />
contribution to international peace and security and is<br />
generally recognised as the single most effective and widely<br />
adhered to nuclear arms control agreement in existence.<br />
Australia ratified the Treaty on 23 January 1973.<br />
Membership of the Treaty provides reassurance to the<br />
international community and neighbouring states of a<br />
nation's peaceful nuclear intentions and has become the<br />
standard for responsible international nuclear behaviour.<br />
Australia continues to urge universal adherence to the NPT.<br />
it is my hope that the twentieth anniversary of its opening<br />
for signature will act as a spur to those countries which<br />
have yet to commit themseles to the Treaty.<br />
