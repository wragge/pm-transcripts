    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Lois; to Jackie Kelly; Michael Knight,</p>
<p> the Chairman of SOCOG and New South Wales' Minister responsible for</p>
<p> the Games; Peter Bartels, the Chairman of the Australian Sports Commission;</p>
<p> Louise Sauvage and other paralympians, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I'm delighted to be associated with the unveiling of the Paralympian</p>
<p> Torch and to say a few words of very strong support and to express</p>
<p> the very strong commitment of the National Government towards the</p>
<p> Paralympics to be held in October of next year. I do so with a great</p>
<p> sense of pride, of course, as Prime Minister knowing that we have</p>
<p> an absolutely superb team of paralympians in Australia. Their gold</p>
<p> medal tally at Atlanta was second only and our team in Sydney next</p>
<p> year will be the largest and strongest ever.</p>
<p>The Games next year will include 4000 athletes from an anticipated</p>
<p> 125 nations. They will be larger than the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth</p>
<p> Games, the 1998 Soccer World Cup and the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne.</p>
<p>The Government is very strongly committed to the Games and we've already</p>
<p> demonstrated that commitment by contributing a guarantee of up to</p>
<p> $25 million of half the expected operating deficit and providing almost</p>
<p> $5.5 million for the preparation of the Paralympic athletes and meeting</p>
<p> the GST liability on Paralympic ticket sales estimated at $1.6 million.</p>
<p> And I'm also very proud, indeed, to have been invited to officially</p>
<p> open the Games on the 18th of October next year.</p>
<p>I want to join Lois in congratulating the Motor Accident Authority</p>
<p> for becoming the presenting partner of the Sydney 2000 Paralympic</p>
<p> Torch Relay. And I encourage other companies, particularly Olympic</p>
<p> and Paralympic sponsors to also support the torch relay and, for that</p>
<p> matter, the whole of the Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>Lois said earlier that she expected the crowds to be very large and</p>
<p> to cover all age groups of the Australian community. And in that connection</p>
<p> I'm very pleased to announce today that the Government will be providing</p>
<p> special assistance to ensure the attendance of a large number of school</p>
<p> children from all over Australia, from all over Australia, to attend</p>
<p> the Games. It will mean that from all parts of the country, the way</p>
<p> in which the subsidy that we are providing has been organised, it</p>
<p> will be possible for, I think, up to 40,000 school children from different</p>
<p> parts of Australia to benefit from that support. And my colleague,</p>
<p> Jackie Kelly, will be announcing immediately after this launch, will</p>
<p> be announcing particular details of that scheme that I think will</p>
<p> provide the wherewithal for a very, very significant involvement as</p>
<p> spectators of the schools children of Australia. And, importantly,</p>
<p> it will enable all parts of the Australian community to be associated</p>
<p> with this event. Because it is important both in relation to the Paralympics</p>
<p> and also the Olympic Games themselves that they be events that are</p>
<p> owned by and felt a source of pride for all Australians. They may</p>
<p> be held in Sydney but they are Games that belong to the entire Australian</p>
<p> nation and it's therefore very important to all sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community. And I know that people from all around the country will</p>
<p> be very, very heavily involved.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I want to, on behalf of the Federal Government,</p>
<p> to encourage all Australians to very strongly support our Paralympic</p>
<p> team and to support these Games. They will be, as I outlined, a major</p>
<p> sporting event, second only to the Olympic Games in the year 2000.</p>
<p> The size and the scope of them will exceed many major world sporting</p>
<p> events that we've come to accept as a touchstone of size and scope</p>
<p> in recent years. And I want all these weeks in advance, these 65 weeks</p>
<p> in advance, on your behalf to wish the Australian team well, to congratulate</p>
<p> them and remark upon their tremendous success to date. I want to thank</p>
<p> Lois and all of those associated with the organising committee and</p>
<p> the sponsors and to thank Michael Knight and SOCOG for their very</p>
<p> strong support and their very strong involvement. Getting behind the</p>
<p> Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games is very much a united, bipartisan</p>
<p> Australian effort. They are events that will showcase Australia to</p>
<p> the rest of the world. They will not only showcase our athletes, the</p>
<p> two events will also showcase the magnificent lifestyle of the Australian</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>And it's very important as we approach these two events that any differences</p>
<p> or difficulties that may have arisen in the past be put behind us,</p>
<p> be dissolved and put aside in the interests of demonstrating to the</p>
<p> world what a friendly, open and accommodating and, of course, highly</p>
<p> competitive people Australians really are. And we can do that better</p>
<p> than any group of people in the world. We can make these two events</p>
<p> landmarks in the showcasing of our nation to the rest of the world</p>
<p> and it's in that spirit that the Federal Government approaches these</p>
<p> Games. It's in that spirit that all of us are very pleased to be associated.</p>
<p> And so I encourage all Australians to join me at the Games and I now</p>
<p> take pleasure in officially revealing the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Torch.</p>
<p>[BREAK]</p>
<p>I forgot to say something. I don't often forget to say something,</p>
<p> I sometimes say too much. But I did forget to make it very clear in</p>
<p> my speech that the Government has decided to extend the Torch Relay</p>
<p> to all States and Territories. And originally there was some doubt</p>
<p> about that but we've made it clear that it will go to all States and</p>
<p> Territories. And Louise's parents, for example, in Perth will be able</p>
<p> to cheer it on. I apologise - you won't mind the interruption.</p>
