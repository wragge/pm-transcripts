PRIM E MINISTER 16 January 1975<br />

PRESS STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, DR. J. F. CAIRNS<br />
HOBART TRAGEDY<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Dr. Cairns, announced today<br />
that he had sent a message to the Tasmanian Premier, Mr. Reece,<br />
informing him that the Australian Government would reimburse<br />
the State for the full amounts of expenditure incurred by it<br />
and its authorities as a result of the Hobart Bridge disaster.<br />
This had been agreed to by the Cabinet at its meeting in Sydney<br />
today. Dr. Cairns recalled that, immediately on hearing of<br />
the disaster, the Prime Minister had assured Mr. Reece of the<br />
full and ready co-operation of the Australian Government, and<br />
this had been followed up with an offer to provide up to<br />
$ 13 million for reconstruction of the bridge, upgrading the<br />
road through Bridgewater and ferry terminals.<br />
Dr. Cairns said that the Australian Government's<br />
commitment was subject to the various expenditures being<br />
accepted by it as attributable to the bridge collapse, and<br />
reasonable. It was not possible at this stage to estimate the<br />
ultimate level of Australian Government assistance. * In the<br />
event that the State were to make any successful claims on the<br />
A. N. L. and/ or their insurers, the Australian Government's<br />
assistance would be correspondingly reduced.<br />
The Australian Government is preparing legislation -to<br />
authorise the provision of this assistance to the State.<br />
It will be introduced as soon as possible after the Australian<br />
Parliament re-assembles in February.<br />
Dr. Cairns also announced that a Committee of officials<br />
is to be established with the-responsibility for co-ordinating<br />
Australian Government assistance. He had suggested to Mr.<br />
Reece that he might like to consider establishing a similar<br />
body for the State.<br />
" I re-affirm that the Australian Government will do<br />
everything in its power, in co-operation with the State<br />
Government, to ensure that Hobart's immediate problems are<br />
overcome, and the bridge restored, as quickly as possible,"<br />
Dr. Cairns said. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Cabinet resolved that the Minister for Repatriation<br />
and Compensation inquire into the adequacy of compensation<br />
payments for death and personal injury resulting from the<br />
Hobart Bridge disaster.<br />
The Minister would then make recommendations to<br />
Cabinet as to whether an additional compensation would be<br />
paid by the Australian Government.<br />
His recommendations would be in line with the Government's<br />
approach to the aftermath of the Darwin cyclone, its policy<br />
on the provision of compensation for victims of-natural<br />
disasters, and its proposed national compensation scheme.<br />
