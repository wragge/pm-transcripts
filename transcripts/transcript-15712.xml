    <content><![CDATA[<p>I strongly condemn the murder of Benazir Bhutto and of all those killed in this terrible act. </p>
<p>The thoughts of all Australians are with those affected by this terrible attack. </p>
<p>I offer my condolences and best wishes to the people of Pakistan, all of whom will be deeply affected by this attack. </p>
<p>Benazir Bhutto was an historic figure of great influence in modern Pakistan. She had been campaigning resolutely for democracy in that country. </p>
<p>Despite a previous attempt to assassinate her on her return to Pakistan in October and the shocking loss of over a hundred lives in that attempt, Benazir Bhutto refused to bow to intimidation and the continuing threat to her life. </p>
<p>Throughout her life, Benazir Bhutto showed great courage and defiance in her resistance to extremism. </p>
<p>The extremists behind this attack cannot be allowed to succeed. I urge all parties in Pakistan to act with restraint and to work for a return to a peaceful democratic process. </p>
<p>It is my hope that a democratic Pakistan will be Benazir Bhutto's legacy.</p>
