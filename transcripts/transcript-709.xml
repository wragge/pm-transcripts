OPENINUl OF THL T, G. 3ILAItiG, UO0SA1M<br />
PIMCE, CANJOWBAs ON~ 20TH KARCJI9 1963.<br />
Sneech by tMM kELMe = istar. the B1. lion j~ Bober&amp; denzielt<br />
M~ r,. 3rain and Gentlement<br />
For a lone time nov I have regarded Hugh Brain<br />
an a good friend. Whether I can still put him In that<br />
category will depend entirely on the close study that I will<br />
give to the fall text of his speech ( Laughter) when It Is<br />
available to se. Anyhow, I am free to admit that this Is a good<br />
&amp; y for him; it's a good day for Canberra; It's a good day<br />
for life asn ce; it's a jaod day all round. obviously,<br />
has been ctramming ippart of the history of Cnberfra. 1. came<br />
here myself a relatIvely new boy, In 19k* so that you can<br />
realise that having been here$ engiaged very actively in<br />
national political affairs for tventynine years, you will<br />
understand pe-fiectly why so many people refer to me in the<br />
venerable sense. ( Laughter)<br />
At that time, there were a few thousand people<br />
here. There were a few shops. The residential areas were<br />
quite sall; the great development in Canberra. has In fact<br />
occurred since the war. And what a marvellous development<br />
It Is, I know that only twelve years aaio I think I am<br />
right in saying -there hadn't been a new shop, for example,<br />
a new place of business built in Canberra for a long, long<br />
time for obvious reasons. Mow, I find that If I go away<br />
for the wekend, which I do occasionally to visit one of<br />
the miore depnerate capitals like Melbourne or Sydney when<br />
I came back there Is another incipient skyscraper beginnng<br />
to show up on the landscape. The development in this place<br />
has been phenomenal. That is to a very large measure due<br />
to the wisdm of the Government in appointing John Overall<br />
to conduct a Commission and its equal wisdom in giving him<br />
what I might describe, with apologies to the frasurer, as<br />
adequate financial backing. ( Laughter)<br />
And one thing leads to another,, and the result<br />
is we have these peat office buiLdings, we have these groat<br />
establisunents rising up in Canberra, so that more and more<br />
People are begin 4ng to understand that this Is not just<br />
same ftmn little village, tucked away in the country rather<br />
to be resented b7 the existing, States but that It is<br />
Increasingly a national capital arnd viii take Its place In<br />
the life of the nation so that as soon as -we becoame accustomed<br />
to thinking nationally rather than parochiall which Is<br />
very important, it will take its place In the iire of<br />
lustralia just as dashington. does in the Inited States and,<br />
jWeedt just an [ London does in the life of the United<br />
^ Ingdo** And I think that It Is a marvellous thing that<br />
this treat movement in Canberra should have been poWrfully<br />
assisted by Imaginative men of affairs conducting preat<br />
existing institutions. And the T. a, Is one of them,<br />
The T, 0. not only makes its own mark in Canberra, 9 but It<br />
helps to make a mark for Canberra. This is a real contribution<br />
to the history of the capital city of what will be In<br />
due course one of the gmet nations of the world. ( Hear, heAr)<br />
And so this is,, in that sense, an histuric event* </p>
<p>am2<br />
It is also, I imagine, quite historic In the<br />
individual history of the T, G., 9 bemause whenever I have to<br />
perform one of these rather agreeable tasks, somebody is bound<br />
to Send me what they call sm documentation on the matter,<br />
beginning in this ease with the list or the Directors. I read<br />
that list and I recoiled a little because I knew most, if not<br />
all, of them. ( Latighter) I said to myself, W~ elnt eIS Pot<br />
on, Yost that's right." ( Laughter) &amp; t In particular I was<br />
fascinated to get, for the first time, a clear explanation of<br />
how this became t6 be known as the " Temperance and General"<br />
the T. 0, andI found to myintense satisfaction that at the<br />
time i was &amp; oru" the totnl funds vw" roughly a quarter of a<br />
million and that membership was confined to total abstainers,<br />
Well of course, at that time, let me see I iouild be<br />
couple of years old I was a total abstainer; ( Laughter)<br />
therefore well qalified for membershi.. at thena I looked back<br />
at the list of the Board of Directors ( iaughter) and I thought,<br />
" Ha, ha. Changes have cnme about in the world." And so quite<br />
tre at a certain staje In the history of the Society, tAose<br />
who drink fermented mlt or spirituous liquors were admitted<br />
to the benefits of the T. G. Whether that is the cause or<br />
not, I would bae to say, because I don't want to become involved<br />
In more ar uents then I an already involved in but I do notice<br />
that whereas the fumds were a quarter of a million, they are now<br />
to be counted in hundreds of millions. The growth of this Society<br />
has been phenomenal. That I think Is a matter for great satisfao.<br />
tion. The third thing that pleases me is that this is not<br />
the only Society of its ind In Australia, There are others,<br />
same of the great ones exhibiting similar growth in modern times.<br />
That makes one say to oneself, " WJhat is the great advantage of<br />
this?" And, of course, you are quite right 61ir. The great<br />
advantage of this is that as the practice o! l assurance of this<br />
kind grows, so does the stability of the coanity grow, and<br />
I an old.-fashioned enough to believe that the foundation for<br />
future tremendous. national growth Is a good stable foundation,<br />
and the stability of this country, the stability of families,<br />
the stability of Individuals, the stability of governments is<br />
Intimately wrapped up with the widespread a"* e tanoe in Australia<br />
of the practice of life assurance. i don't t nk it exists in<br />
other countries. I don't know, I have no statistics. I have<br />
always had a feeling~ it doesn't exist In amn other countries to<br />
the extent that it does here; because I know,, to take myself as<br />
an exuple, most of us of my generation In the twenties were<br />
taking out some life assurance, as much as we could afford to<br />
take, knowing in the back of our minds that some day that would<br />
give us a feeling of Security and stability that might set us<br />
free for other more enterprising activities in o= m own lives.<br />
Thereftre, I think that this country, this society<br />
of people owes a tremendous debt to the iMa4A~ tiVe people<br />
who, in the last century, set about creating life assurance<br />
practices in Australia. Thei must have been regarded as rather<br />
odd fellows in a Sense adventurers " Well how are you going<br />
to get people to pay you premiums?" " How do you know you will<br />
ever be able to meet the sun assured?" " Until you have developed<br />
a large volume of business how do you suppose you are going to<br />
get the confidence of individuals? w I know this is true,<br />
looking back over the history of life assurance societies. Bat<br />
the people who began them, they had some Imagination, they had<br />
courage and their courage hasa been rewarded in the hands of<br />
their descendants and In the pockets and lives of the people<br />
of Australia* *&amp; ee9/ 3 </p>
