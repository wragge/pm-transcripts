PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
WORLD EXPO 88<br />
BRISBANE 30 APRIL 1988<br />
Your Majesty<br />
Your Royal Highness<br />
Your Excellencies<br />
Mr Premier<br />
Commissioner General Sir Edward Williams<br />
Expo Chairman, Sir Llew Edwards<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
There is no shortage of great events taking place throughout<br />
Australia this year, in celebration of our Bicentenary.<br />
But one of the greatest, one of the most memorable, and one<br />
of the most exciting of them all is about to begin.<br />
For the next 6 months, Bwrisbane is to play host to the<br />
world. 36 countries, 52 governments, 150 companies, and every<br />
Australian state and the two main territories, have come<br />
together in Expo ' 88 to show us their lifestyles, their<br />
cultures and the best of their products.<br />
As such it is a tremendous expression of international<br />
goodwill and an impressive display of the highest<br />
contemporary achievements of the human spirit.<br />
it is a celebration which will attract visitors from around<br />
the world.<br />
As Prime Minister I extend a very warm welcome to all those<br />
who are visiting* Australia for Expo.<br />
I am confident that after seein g what Expo has to offer, and<br />
the rest of Brisbane, and the rest of the country, you will<br />
not be disappointed%<br />
That is because Australians have worked hard to make Expo 88<br />
a success. 006149 </p>
<p>There are too many people thank individually for their<br />
vision and hard work and besides, their best reward will<br />
not be formal expressions of thanks but the enthusiasm with<br />
which their exhibitions are greeted by the millions of<br />
people expected to visit Expo.<br />
It would be wrong however if I failed to mention<br />
specifically the staff of the Expo Authority under the able<br />
leadership of Llew Edwards, and the staff of the<br />
Commissioner General, led by Ned Williams, representing<br />
the Australian Government.<br />
Quite simply without their work there would not be an Expo.<br />
We are all in their debt.<br />
I have referred to Expo as a celebration and it will<br />
certainly be that.<br />
But it will, I hope, be more than that.<br />
For Australians, Expo presents us with a very significant<br />
opportunity to show the world what we are capable of.<br />
We know we can be a source of high quality manufactures and<br />
commodities, a site of new investment, a launching place for<br />
commercial ventures in the Asia-Pacific region, and a<br />
tourist destination of unparalleled excellence.<br />
It's our job here at Expo to show ourselves in this light to<br />
the world.<br />
If Australians grasp this opportunity, the Bicentenary will<br />
become not just a 12-month party but a boost to our economy<br />
the benefits of which will be felt for years to come.<br />
And there is a broader implication still.<br />
Expo is an inspiring example for all of us of what we<br />
collectively are capable as citizens of the world.<br />
It is one of those rare events which prompt us to consider<br />
what efforts individuals and nations might make to foster<br />
the cause of peace, prosperity and constructive cooperation<br />
eve rywhe re.<br />
Long after Expo is finished, if it has advanced that cause,<br />
it will have served a truly invaluable and enduring purpose<br />
for us all. 006150 </p>
