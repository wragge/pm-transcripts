I will visit East Timor on 19-20 May 2002 to attend the East Timor independence celebrations.  This will be followed by a visit to the People';s Republic of China from 21-24 May marking the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.<br />
Australia has played an important role in assisting East Timor on its path to independence.  As well as the independence ceremony, I will attend the first sitting of the East Timor national parliament and the swearing in of the first East Timorese government. I will open the National Exhibition and Community Centre, which is an independence gift from Australia, and participate in ceremonies to establish diplomatic relations with East Timor.  In addition, I expect to be able to sign the Timor Sea Treaty.  In Dili, I will also meet Australian Defence Force personnel serving in the UN peacekeeping operation and visit an Australian aid project at Dili National Hospital.<br />
My visit to China will be my third as Prime Minister, the most recent being last year's APEC leaders meeting in Shanghai.  I look forward to renewing my contact with China';s leaders including President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji.<br />
China is increasingly active as a regional and global player and I will be discussing a range of bilateral, regional and global developments of interest to both our countries.<br />
Australia has a growing, multi-faceted and mutually beneficial relationship with China.  Since 1996 we have established dialogues and agreements on defence, regional security and disarmament, human rights and consular issues.  There are strong people-to-people links.  But the bedrock of our relationship is economic.  China is Australia';s third largest trading partner and fourth largest â and fastest growing â export market.  My visit will explore the opportunities for further developing our relationship, including in the energy sector.  I look forward to meeting business leaders and demonstrating support for Australian interests in China.</p>
