SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P,.<br />
AT KNOX GRAMMAR SCHOOL SPEECH NIGHT<br />
DECEMBER, 1974 UY<br />
IT IS NOT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE AND NOT WITHOUT<br />
A CERTAIN IRONY THAT THE JUBILEE OF KNOX AND THE SECOND<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF THE LABOR GOVERNMENT ARE BEING OBSERVED IN THE<br />
SAME WEEK. I AM PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON IN AUSTRALIA WHO j<br />
HAS ATTENDED BOTH CELEBRATIONS AND DERIVED KEEN PERSONAL<br />
SATISFACTION FROM EACH. I MUST CONFESS THAT THE ATMOSPHERE<br />
IN DIAMOND VALLEY ON MONDAY NIGHT WAS A TRIFLE MORE RAPTUROUS<br />
THAN IT IS IN WAHROONGA, BUT LET ME NOT BE STINTING IN MY<br />
GRATITUDE'. THERE IS NO OTHER FORUM WHERE I CAN ACHIEVE SO<br />
LARGE AND CIVIL AN AUDIENCE ON THE DEEP NORTH SHORE AS I CAN<br />
AT KNOX ON SPEECH . NIGHT. THIS IS EASILY THE BEST MEETING I<br />
HAVE ADDRESSED IN THE ELECTORATE OF BRADFIELD$<br />
IT IS'A VERY GREAT HONOUR AND A VERY GREAT<br />
PLEASURE TO BE BACK AMONG YOU. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE SCHOOL<br />
HAS CHANGED A GOOD DEAL SINCE I WAS HERE. THE BUILDINGS<br />
AND GROUNDS'ARE MORE RESPLENDENT THAN EVER. THE UNIFORM I<br />
AM WEARING TONIGHT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I<br />
REMEMBER. 2/ </p>
<p>KNOX HAS JOINED' THE SELECT BAND OF SCHOOLS WHOSE<br />
SOLD BOYS INCLUDE A PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA. SOME OF<br />
YOU MAY THINK THAT IN AN IDEAL WORLD THAT HONOUR MIGHT HAVE<br />
FALLEN MORE FITTINGLY ON ONE OF THE OTHER OLD BOYS WHO HAVE<br />
MADE THEIR MARK AT KNOX AND THEIR FORTUNES IN POLITICS<br />
IAN SINCLAIR, JOHN FULLER, JiM FORBES. BUT I WAS DETERMINED<br />
THAT NONE OF THEM WOULD BEAT ME TO IT, FOR MANY YEARS I<br />
NURTURED AN OVERWHELMING AMBITION I WAS RESOLVED TO BE<br />
THE FIRST KNOX BOY TO LIVE AT THE LODGE. WHAT BETTER WAY<br />
TO BRING HONOUR TO THE SCHOOL? FIFTY YEARS AGO, , WHEN I CAME<br />
HERE, NO ONE DREAMED I WOULD ONE DAY BE PRIME MINISTER.<br />
IF ANYONE HAD KNOWN I WOULD BE A LABOR PRIME MINISTER THEY<br />
MIGHT NEVER HAD LET ME IN.: LABOR MEN RARELY WENT TO<br />
KNOX THEY. PREFERRED THE SCHOOL. OF HARD KNOX.<br />
I SUPPOSE WHEN I FINALLY MADE IT THERE WERE SOME<br />
MISGIVINGS IN THE A. L. P. AND NOT A FEW MISGIVINGS HERE.<br />
YET LOOKING BACK, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REMARKABLE PARALLELS<br />
' IN OUR FORTUNES AND ACHIEVEMENTS. KNOX AND THE LABOR<br />
PARTY HAVE BOTH TURNED OUT A FAIR QUOTA OF JUDGES, DIPLOMATS,<br />
AND HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS EVEN PRIME MINISTERS. WHEN<br />
A VACANCY OCCURRED ON THE HIGH COURT LAST YEAR IT WAS<br />
OBVIOUS TO ME THAT MR. JUSTICE JACOBS HAD EXACTLY THE RIGHT<br />
BACKGROUND. SOME OF MY AMBASSADORIAL APPOINTMENTS ARE QUITE<br />
WELL KNOWN. PERHAPS I CAN CONFIDE TO THIS AUDIENCE THAT MR.<br />
ROB LAURIE, WHO ACCOMPANIED ME HERE TONIGHT, WILL TAKE UP<br />
A POSTING AS HEAD OF ONE OF OUR ASIAN MISSIONS NEXT YEAR. MR.<br />
LAURIE LEFT KNOX IN 1953. MY PRESS SECRETARY LEFT IN 1951,<br />
I </p>
<p>S T . y<br />
I UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE PAST YEAR KNOX AND THE A, L. P. HAVE<br />
BOTH HAD BUILDING APPEALS, IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF ONE<br />
OR TWO BUSINESSMEN HAD GIVEN SOMETHING TO BOTH OF US. AND OF<br />
COURSE WE HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS TOGETHER FOR EDUCATION.<br />
EDUCATION HAS BEEN OUR COMMON GOAL THOUGH OPINIONS MAY DIFFER<br />
ABOUT OUR RESPECTIVE ACHIEVEMENTS,<br />
DESPITE MY EARLY SCHOOLING AT KNOX I HAVE NEVER<br />
BEEN A SIMPLE PRESBYTERIAN. THE MOST CELEBRATED<br />
PRESBYTERIAN TO HOLD THIS OFFICE ATTENDED A METHODIST SCHOOL<br />
IN MELBOURNE. IT IS STILL GOING STRONG. I BEGAN MY<br />
EDUCATION AT TWO ANGLICAN SCHOOLS IN SYDNEY. THEY HAVE<br />
BOTH CLOSED DOWN. ONE OF THEM WAS MOWBRAY HOUSE. IN THE<br />
LAST TERM OF 1922, I ATTENDED THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND GIRLS'<br />
GRAMMAR SCHOOL AT CHATSWOOD. IT WAS MY FIRST CONTACT WITH<br />
THE " MONSTROUS REGIMEN OF WOMEN" WHOSE INFLUENCE JOHN KNOX<br />
DEPLORED WITH SUCH VEHEMENCE. I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED HOW<br />
KNOX WOULD HAVE FARED IF HE HAD SET ABOUT REFORMING THE A. L. P.<br />
INSTEAD OF THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND. HE WAS'A RATHER<br />
SUBVERSIVE CHARACTER. HE WENT SO FAR AS TO ADVOCATE RESISTANCE<br />
TO THE ESTABLISHED CIVIL ORDER IF NECESSARY BY FORCE.<br />
HE WAS A BEARDED REVOLUTIONARY, GIVEN TO HARANGUING PUBLIC<br />
MEETINGS. HE FELT THOROUGHLY DISAFFECTED WITH THE " SYSTEM".<br />
HE DISPARAGED'THE MONARCHY. IF. HE HAD BEEN ALIVE TODAY HE<br />
WOULD HAVE MARCHED IN MORATORIUMS AND SUPPORTED THE PEACE<br />
MOVEMENT, I DOUBT IF HIS CHILDREN WOULD HAVE GONE TO THIS SCHOOL.<br />
4 </p>
<p>A*. IN THE LITURGY HE DEVISED FOR THE CHURCH ONE IS<br />
STRUCK BY CERTAIN CONTEMPORARY PARALLELS. KNOX BELIEVED<br />
THAT MINISTERS SHOULD BE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE BUT APPOINTED*<br />
BY THEIR MINISTERIAL BRETHREN. THAT IS MORE OR LESS. HOW WE<br />
RUN THE CAUCUS.-HE BELIEVED THAT FINAL AUTHORLTY IN THE<br />
CHURCH SHOULD LIE WITH A GENERAL ASSEMBLY CONTAINING ELDERS<br />
. AND MINISTERS, THAT IS RATHER LIKE OUR FEDERAL CONFERENCE,.."':<br />
SO YOU CAN SEE THE SOURCES OF OUR INSPIRATION. YOU CAN SEE<br />
WHY I'VE COME TO YOUR SPEECH NIGHT. IN THE LABOR PARTY WE.<br />
OWE AS MUCH TO KNOX THE MAN AS WE DO TO KNOX THE SCHOOL. HE'*<br />
ALSO HELb EXEMPLARY VIEWS ON EDUCATION. J. S. MCEWEN, WHO<br />
WROTE A STUDY OF KNox's RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, POINTS OUT THAT<br />
IN THE BOOK OF DISCIPLINE KNOX OUTLINED A MOST ELABORATE'<br />
EDUCATIONAL SCHEME FROM PARISH SCHOOL UP TO UNIVERSITY,<br />
COMPULSORY IN ITS EARLY STAGES FOR ALL AND FREE TO THE POOR$<br />
WITH EQUAL OPPORTUNITY OF ADVANCEMENT FOR THE SON OF' PEASANT<br />
AND OF. PEER." 4, I&amp; THOSE WORDS ARE NOT MINE BUT I SHOULD-BE<br />
QUITE HAPPY TO SEE THEM IN OUR PARTY PLATFORM.<br />
IT IS TYPICAL OF KNOX THAT HE GAVE NO THOUGHT TO<br />
THE DAGHITER. S OF PEASANT OR PEER. IN THESE ENLIGHTENED DAYS<br />
WE PROVIDE GIRLS WITH INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS THAT ARE JUST: AS<br />
EFFICIENT, JUST AS RESPECTED, ' JUST AS WELL ENDOWED AS THOSE<br />
FOR BOYS. IWAS ASTONISHED THE OTHER DAY TO FIND A BOOK<br />
WRITTEN BY THE FORMER HEADMISTRESS OF SUCH A SCHOOL. IT<br />
WOULD BE UNFAIR TO MENTION THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL OR THE<br />
NAME OF THE AUTHOR, BUT THE BOOK WAS CALLED ' INDISCRETIONS<br />
OF A HEADMISTRESS". " I WAS CONNED BY THE TITLE. ,1 </p>
<p>: t<br />
t W-4-MANY PEOPLE BROWSING THROUGH THE PAPERBACKS AT AIRPORT<br />
BOOKSTALLS MUST HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY READ IT.<br />
I DO NOT MEAN TO. DISPARAGE THE BOOK. ITS CONTENTS WERE<br />
PIOUS AND ENTIRELY ADMIRABLE. IT WAS THE TITLE THAT GOT<br />
IF<br />
ME IN. IT OCCURRED TOME THAT/ THE KARMEL REPQRT HAD<br />
BORNE HALF SO SUGGESTIVE A TITLE IT WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED<br />
A MUCH WIDER CIRCULATION, IF NOT A WIDER ACCEPTANCE.<br />
NOW I KNOW THE KARMEL REPORT IS A SORE POINT WITH 4<br />
SOME OF. YOU, BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO TOUCH ON IT BRIEFLY. I<br />
HAVE DONE MY HOMEWORK, AND I NOTICED AN EDITORIAL ON KARMEL<br />
IN THE " KNOX GRAMMARIAN" OF JUNE THIS YEAR. IT WELCOMED<br />
THE REPLACEMENT OF OLD FASHIONED " ROTE LEARNING" BY MODERN<br />
CONCEPTS OF TEACHING. IT DEPLORED THE FACT THAT THIS<br />
TRANSITION WAS PROCEEDING TOO SLOWLY, AND THAT THE NECESSARY<br />
ATMOSPHERE OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE IN THE CLASSROOM WAS<br />
BREAKING DOWN. IT WENT ON TO SAY: " THE BLAME FOR THIS<br />
STAGNATION IN EDUCATION CAN BE GIVEN WHOLLY TO THE POLICY<br />
MAKERS WHO FIND CHANGE INTOLERABLE. THE KARMEL REPORT IS<br />
OF COURSE, THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS. THEY FOUND THAT PRIVATE<br />
SCHOOLS WERE TOO FAR AHEAD OF STATE SCHOOLS IN IDEAS AND<br />
APPLICATIONS. TE WAY THEY STIFLED OR HALTED THESE<br />
' RADICAL' EXPENSIVE IDEAS WAS TO CUT OUT FUNDS TO THESE<br />
SCHOOLS. NOW THEY WANT TO STANDARDIZE EDUCATION ON THE<br />
SAME MEDIOCRE LEVEL." CONCEPTS~ I~~ ~~~ E~ L RDTEFC OFTAHHN, T TI il </p>
<p>I MUST SAY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN<br />
ACCUSED OF FINDING CHANGE INTOLERABLE. As ONE WHO HAD A<br />
LOT TO DO WITH PROFESSOR KARMEL'S APPOINTMENT AND THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION, I CANNOT ALLOW THAT<br />
ACCUSATION TO PASS.:-ONE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE MERITS OF MODERN<br />
EDUCATIONAL THEORY BUT I DON'T THINK ONE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF MONEY TO EDUCATION$. THE SCOTS, TO THEIR GREAT..-.'<br />
CREDIT, HAVE NEVER HAD ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF-'<br />
MONEY. WEALTH DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE FOR A GOOD-SCHOOL<br />
BUT POVERTY ASSUREDLY MAKES FOR A BAD ONE. OUR POLICIES ON<br />
EDUCATION ARE NOT INTENDED TO " STANDARDIZE EDUCATION ON THE<br />
SAME'MEDIOCRE LEVEL". THEY ARE INTENDED TO RAISE ALL<br />
SCHOOLS TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL. I-ACCEPT THAT IT MAY NOTALWAYS<br />
BE POSSIBLE TO DO THIS. I ACCEPT THAT THERE WILL PROBABLY<br />
ALWAYS BE SOME SCHOOLS NOT NECESSARILY PRIVATE SCHOOLS<br />
THAT ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS. No AMOUNT OF PLANNING Oft<br />
FUNDING CAN OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF, SAY, INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT,<br />
DISHARMONY'AMONG STAFF# OR A LACK OF MORALE OR ESPRIT<br />
DE CORPS.<br />
A </p>
<p>THESE THINGS ARE INTANGIBLE AND VERY LARGELY<br />
FORTUITOUS. IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT, HOWEVER, THAT<br />
MATERIAL DEPRIVATION CAN BE OVERCOME WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDS.<br />
IF A SCHOOL IS DISADVANTAGED, IF IT IS POOR, WE CAN HELP<br />
RAISE ITS STANDARDS. BY PROVIDING THE BUILDINGS, THE<br />
EQUIPMENT, THE BOOKS, THE SALARIED STAFF THAT IT NEEDS.<br />
LONG BEFORE WE CAME TO OFFICE IT WAS MANIFESTLY'CLEAR<br />
THAT MANY SCHOOLS LACKED FUNDS FOR BASIC NECESSITIES.<br />
SOME WERE IN GREATER NEED THAN OTHERS. I SHOULD HAVE<br />
THOUGHT IT A VERY SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS PRINCIPLE IT WOULD<br />
NOT BE PUTTING IT TOO HIGHLY TO SAY A CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE<br />
THAT THE MOST DEPRIVED CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST<br />
CALL ON OUR HELP. WE DECIDED THAT THE SCHOOLS MOST IN<br />
NEED SHOULD BENEFIT MOST FROM ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS.<br />
WE DECIDED THAT THESE NEEDS COULD BEST BE ASSESSED BY<br />
AN EXPERT, IMPARTIAL, INDEPENDENT INQUIRY. WE SET UP<br />
THAT INQUIRY. WE MADE PUBLIC ITS REPORT. WE ACTED<br />
ON THAT REPORT. IT WAS NOT JUST A QUESTION OF REDISTRIBUTING<br />
EXISTING FUNDS. IT WAS A MATTER OF CHANNELLING VASTLY<br />
AUGMENTED FUNDS TO THE SCHOOLS THAT NEEDED THEM. THERE<br />
WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION OF LEVELLING DOWN. OUR AIM IS<br />
TO RAISE ALL STANDARDS. WE ARE DETERMINED THAT THE BEST<br />
EDUCATION AVAILABLE ANYWHERE IN AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE<br />
AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE IN AUSTRALIA. / 8<br />
LIIII~ </p>
<p>' 2 AC ~ 4.4<br />
IHAVE NEVER DOUBTED THAT OUR REFORMS IN EDUCATION<br />
HAVE BEEN THE PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENT OF my GOVERNMENT. WE<br />
ARE SPENDING FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS OUR PREDECESSORS ON<br />
EDUCATION.-WE HAVE ASSUMED FULL FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.<br />
FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION, AND HAVE ABOLISHED FEES. FOR THE..<br />
FIRST TIME WE ARE* GIVING ASS ISTANCE TO TEACHERS COLLEGES<br />
AND PRE-SCHOOL TEACHERS'I COLLEGES ON THE SAME BASIS AS<br />
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION: WE ARE<br />
GIVING MUCH MORE GENEROUS ALLOWANCES TO STUDENTS AND<br />
HAVE MORE THAN TREBLED THE NUMBER OF TEACHING SCHOLARSHIPS$..<br />
WE ARE TACKLING THE NEW AREA OF TECHNICAL AND FURTHER,<br />
EDUCATION. ISHOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THE MOST ENDURING<br />
RESULT OF OUR POLICIES ON EDUCATION HAS BEEN TO RAISE<br />
THE COMMUNITY'I S LE VEL OF EXPECTATION. WE HAVE-SET OUR<br />
SIGHTS HIGHER.. TH* E WHOLE DEBATE. ON EDUCATION HAS MOVED<br />
TO A HIGHER PLANE, FREE OF DOGMA1 FREE OF PREJUDICE, FREE<br />
OF SECTARIANISM$ -THERE IS NO LONGER ANY QUESTION ABOUT<br />
THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATION;~<br />
IN THE CASE OF TERTIARY EDUCATION IT IS ACCEPTED<br />
ABSOLUTELY. THERE IS NO LONGER ANY DEBATE ABOUT ' STATE<br />
AID'. THERE'IS NO LONGER ANY ARGUMENT ABOUT THE<br />
SCHOOLS COMMISSION, THE HISTORIC INCREASE IN EDUCATION<br />
EXPENDITURE WAS UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED AND WELCOMED,. EVEN<br />
BY THOSE WHO DISPUTE THE WAY THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN<br />
ALLOCATED. ' A </p>
<p>INITIATED BY^ LABOR OT N 9 I TTHE., V.* ; N,. 57<br />
IT HAS TAKEN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS NEARLY<br />
SIR KEITH MURRAY'S COMMITTEEREPORTED THE NEEDS<br />
100 YEARS TO ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE THAT EDUCATION IS r.<br />
A NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. MORE THAN 30 YEARS HAVE<br />
PASSED SINCE THE FIRST STEPS IN THIS PR WERE SBYTER<br />
INITIATED BY A LABOR GOVERNMENT. IN 1957, WITH THE<br />
UNIVERSITIES OVERLOADED AND E E OINODNE PCEONMDMEONNWTE ALTH<br />
SFUNDS SIR KEITH MURRAY'S COMMITTEE REPORTED ON THE NEEDS<br />
OF UNIVERSITIES AND IN 1959 A NEW UNIVERSITIES COMMISSION<br />
WAS ESTABLISHED BY STATUTE. THEREAFTERI UNIVERSITIES.<br />
BENEFITED FROM SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED FUNDS AND WERE<br />
ON A REGULAR AND RATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF THEIR NEEDS.<br />
WHAT WE ARE NOW DOING FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION<br />
IS PRECISELY WHAT SIR ROBERT MENZIES A GOOD PRESBYTERIAN<br />
DID FOR UNIVERSITIES. IN 1<br />
FIFTY YEARS AGO THE ROLE OF INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS<br />
WAS MUCH MORE DISTINCTIVE THAN IT IS TODAY. WHEN I WAS<br />
AT KNOX IT WAS MORE OR LESS ACCEPTED THAT THE MAJORITY<br />
WHO ENTERED SUCH SCHOOLS WOULD FINISH THEIR SECONDARY<br />
EDUCATION AND, IF POSSIBLE, MATRICULATE. IT WAS UNDERSTOOD<br />
AND NO ONE RESENTED THE FACT THAT SCHOOLS LIKE KNOX<br />
OFFERED THE QUICKEST AND SUREST ACCESS TO THE<br />
PROFESSIONS AND THE HIGHER MANAGERIAL AND EXECUTIVE<br />
OCCUPATIONS THAT WAS A PERFECILY RESPECTABLE AIM<br />
IT IS STILL YOUR AIM BUT IT IS NO LONGER ONE THAT<br />
YOU HOLD EXCLUSIVELY IN 1924,. I CAME TO KNOX,<br />
PER CENT OF ALL CHILDREN IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES WERE AT GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS, </p>
<p>f<br />
4 4J,<br />
, i r..<br />
Z<br />
YET OF ALL THOSE WHO WENT-TO THE LEAVING AND THROUGH<br />
THE LEAVING IN 1924 ONLY 57 PER CENT CAME FROM<br />
GOVERNMENT, SCHOOLS., THE REST WERE EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN<br />
ROMAN CATHOLIC AND. ANGLICAN AND PROTESTANT SCHOOLS. A<br />
I.<br />
* 1*<br />
THE ANGLICAN AND PROTESTANT SCHOOLS PLACED<br />
MUCH GREATER STRESS ON CLASSICAL EDUCATION IN THOSE DAYS.<br />
BACK IN 1924, 126 CHILDREN FROM ANGLICAN AND PROTESTANT<br />
SCHOOLS . PASSED LATIN AT THE LEAVING ALMOST AS MANY AS<br />
PASSED FROM GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS ( 144). YET GOVERNMENT<br />
SCHOOLS HAD 20 TIMES AS MANY CHILDREN AS SCHOOLS LIKE<br />
KNOX. LATIN WAS'MORE POPULAR WITH PRIVATE . CHOOLS.<br />
MORE THAN HALF THE PUPILS AT ANGLICAN AND PROTESTANT<br />
SCHOOLS WHO PASSED THE LEAVING IN 1924 ALSO PASSED IN<br />
LATIN ( 126 OUT OF 210). LAST YEAR MORE THAN 32,000<br />
CHILDREN SAT FOR THE HIGHER SCHOOL CERTIFICATE IN NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES; 446 PASSED IN LATIN.. So ALTHOUGH LATIN IS<br />
STUDIED BY A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE SCHOOL<br />
POPULATION TODAY, WE ARE ACTUALLY PRODUCING MORE LATIN<br />
SCHOLARS. THAT IS SOME CONSOLATION FOR SOMEONE LIKE<br />
MYSELF WITH A CERTAIN PREJUDICE IN FAVOUR OF CLASSICAL<br />
LANGUAGES. I I./ i1 </p>
<p>9-7 YOU MAY SOMETIMES BE TEMPTED TO IMAGINE THAT<br />
my GOVERNMENT IS INDIFFERENT OR EVEN HOSTILE TO INDEPENDENT<br />
SCHOOLS. THAT IS NOT SO. IAGREE THAT WARE MOSTCONCERNED<br />
WITH THE NEEDS OF THE LESS FORTUNATE-SCHOOLS.<br />
BUT IT WOULD BE IRRATIONAL TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS<br />
* CONCERNo URGENT AND VALID AS IT IS, BLINDS US<br />
TO THE QUALITIES OF SCHOOLS SUCH AS YOURS OR MAKES US ANY<br />
LESS MINDFUL OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE EDUCATIONAL<br />
NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. YOU HAVE GREAT TRADITIONS.<br />
YOU HAVE'A GREAT RECORD OF-ACHIEVEMENT. YOU ADHERE'TO<br />
STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE AND A SET OF CORPORATE AND<br />
INDIVIDUAL VALUES THAT ARE WORTH PRESERVING.<br />
BY HARD WORK, BY GREAT EFFORT AND PATIENCE AND MUCH<br />
SACRIFICE YOU HAVE CREATED A SCHOOL OF THE VERY<br />
HIGHEST QUALITY, IN A SETTING OF GREAT BEAUTY. THERE<br />
IS AT KNOX AND SCHOOLS LIKE IT A VERY PALPABLE SPIRIT<br />
OF DEDICATION, OF STRIVING, OF TOTAL COMMITMENT TO<br />
THE WELFARE OF EVERY CHILD. / 12 </p>
<p>-THESE THINGS ARE ENVIABLE. IT WOULD BE ABSURD AND MEANSPIRITED<br />
TO DESPISE THEM. HOPE THEY WILL SERVE AS<br />
EXAMPLES TO THOSE OF US WHO SEEK TO BRING TO ALL<br />
CHILDREN THE BENEFITS OF THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATIONA<br />
PROVIDED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE SURROUNDINGS BY THE BEST<br />
POSSIBLE TEACHERS, AND GUIDED BY THE MOST HUMANE AND<br />
ENLIGHTENED PRINCIPLES OF SCHOLARSHIP AND DISCIPLINE.<br />
ICONGRATULATE ALL THE PRIZEWINNERS TONIGHT. I CONGRATULATE<br />
KNOX, ITS COUNCIL, ITS HEADMASTER, ITS STAFF AND ITS<br />
BOYS 0CM THEIR JUBILEE. I WISH YOU THE VERY BEST OF<br />
GOOD FORYLUNE INh~-9' </p>
