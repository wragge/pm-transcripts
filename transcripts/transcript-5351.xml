CHECi AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
A,, USTRL,,<br />
[ PRIME MINISTER 7/ i<br />
FOR .' EDIA THURSDAY,-MAY 15 1980<br />
The Opening of the Black Mountain<br />
Communications Tower<br />
Th-is occasion formalises another step in the modernisation of<br />
Australia's communications system and the development of Canberra.<br />
Communications are essential to a competitive industrial nation.<br />
But it is equally important to the development and maintenance<br />
of personal and family ties. The word communications implies<br />
technology,* a term which in some quarters has become associated<br />
with the supremacy of machines over people.<br />
In fact, the history of communications in Australia, is the<br />
story of the need for men and women living in remote areas<br />
to make contact with a wider world.<br />
We should not forget that apart from the isolation of a rural<br />
community, our cities are scattered over a continent, and as<br />
a nation many of our people are far distant from the countries<br />
ofE their birth.<br />
So in many ways, good communications mean so much more for our<br />
people. Fortunately for us, times are changed for the<br />
communications industry. Just thirty five years ago the end<br />
of the War the only communications system over vast areas of<br />
Australia's outback was provided by the Royal Flying Doctor<br />
SeBrvice. Here, in pedal wireless, was a very special communications systemperhaps<br />
unique in the world which owed so much to the<br />
inventiveness and perseverance of the Reverend John Flynn.<br />
Flynn understood the vital need for personal contact, and<br />
hoDw essential this was for safety indeed for survival, for<br />
the efficient conduct of business, and perhaps most of all,<br />
for keeping in touch with other Australians.<br />
I was reminded of our early days in comunication a few days<br />
ago in my office when I spoke with the British Prime Minister,<br />
Mrs. Thatcher,-in a telephone and television link-up to<br />
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the radio-telephone link<br />
between Australia and the United Kingdom. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Irn Flynn's day, such a conversation would have been a chancy<br />
business. In those days, before cable and satellite links, we<br />
often used to wait in vain for operator-connected international<br />
calls that never came, and if they did, the crackle and static<br />
stretched patience and hearing.<br />
TPoday, as Margaret Thatcher herself remarked cOuring our<br />
phone conversation, the call sounded as though it came from<br />
a neighbouring London suburb.<br />
This new ease of communication has opened up another world<br />
for Australia,-for government leaders for businessmen and<br />
for families.<br />
For myself, I am made more aware all the time of the<br />
increased importance of telephone communications for<br />
government leaders.<br />
But speaking for a moment as a telephone user and not as<br />
Prime Minister, I do think that in one area of our telephone<br />
service there is room for improvement, and that is in the<br />
pushbutton telephone.<br />
Overseas, for a long while, pushbutton phones have existed<br />
which make the connection as soon as the last button is pushed.<br />
This considerable advance camne to the attention of Telecom,<br />
and eventually after quite a few years pushbutton phones<br />
appeared in Australia.<br />
Aha, I thought, Australia is not so far behind after all.<br />
But I found that while the Australian pushbutton phone<br />
looks like its overseas counterpart, it, in fact, makes<br />
connections no faster than did the old dial telephone.<br />
So what we have is the pushbutton look with the dial technology.<br />
I say to Telecom: It is grand to have the button, but we would<br />
like the speed as well.<br />
But to be fair to Telecom, they are working on the early<br />
introduction of an improved type of pushbutton telephone,<br />
and on a new type of telephone exchange.<br />
When these are in place, I am assured that we shall be as<br />
well and as quickly connected as anywhere.<br />
So, Telecom is keeping us near the forefront of technology.<br />
Hand in hand with the technological progress that has already<br />
taken place has been a massive reduction in the cost of<br />
using telephones. I notice that when I declare the tower open<br />
tonight I am to use the switch that was used by Sir Robert.. Menzies<br />
when he opened the Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne co-axial cablein<br />
1962. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
In those days, the cheapest telephone call between Sydney and<br />
Melbourne was $ 1.20. Today, an economy call, between the two<br />
capitals is little more than $ 1.00 and Telecom aim to improve<br />
that before long.<br />
Equally impressive are the present rates for overseas calls.<br />
In 1930, a three minute call to London cost $ 12.00 equivalent<br />
to one and a half week's pay. By 1945, the cost had been reduced<br />
to $ 6.00 in real terms half a week's pay. Today it costs<br />
$ 5.50 which is-equal to less than one hour's pay.<br />
This progress in telephone comnmunications has transformed<br />
the way of life of individual Australians. In another area<br />
of communications, that of radio and we are on the verge<br />
of a major technological breakthrough as we move towards the<br />
advent of the domestic satellite system.<br />
This system, together with other developments in the<br />
terrestrial network, would set the pattern for bringing the<br />
communications services available to remote areas of this<br />
country progressively into much closer relationship with those<br />
in more densely populated regions.<br />
In this context it is expected that the satellite system would<br />
offer, over time, basic television, radio and telecommunication<br />
services to outback dwellers.<br />
We would all agree that this would be a welcome remedy to<br />
the present communications difficulties suffered by people<br />
in remote areas of Australia. Such developments, now proceeding<br />
apace under Tony Staley's care, will open up a new world to<br />
many thousands of Australians.<br />
The technical advances that have been of such value to<br />
individual Australians have been of similar benefit to<br />
our business community. The kind of facilities-now in usetelex,<br />
mobile telephones, radio paging services, data<br />
communications offer num'erous savings and advantages to<br />
companies.<br />
They add to efficiency, improve competitiveness, reduce error,<br />
and cut costs. In comprehending the size of the cost savings<br />
taking place, telex charges are an excellent example of what<br />
is being achieved.<br />
I am pleased to announced at this function further cuts<br />
to a range of telex charges. Telex charge reductions<br />
of 46% and 20% respectively will apply from July 1 this year<br />
to calls made in the distance categories of 325 645 kilometres<br />
and over 645 kilometres.<br />
After 6 a reduction of 50% will apply in call charges<br />
made in the distance category 325 645 kilometres and cal-ls of over<br />
645 kilometres will be reduced by 20%. For example, a three<br />
minute telex call from klbury-;-odonga to Sydney will reduce<br />
from 75 cents to 40 cents during the day and from 40 cents<br />
to 20 cents at night. These are impressive concessions for<br />
a message of nearly 200 words sent almost instanteously<br />
over such a distance. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
They will represent an estimated annual saving to commerce,<br />
industry and other telex users of over $ 3 million. And they<br />
will apply to almost 2/ 3 of the national telex traffic.<br />
They are part of the continuing reduction, since 1978, in the<br />
great majority of telex chargeL: and total reductions over<br />
some distances have been as high as almost 70%. The<br />
exceptions to this relate to manually operated telex calls<br />
and will apply to only 1 2% of total telex traffic.<br />
At the same time, and as part of the determination to<br />
give people in remote areas access to technology at reasonable<br />
rates, S. T. D. telephone charges have also been reduced.<br />
Daytime Sunday rates have been cut by 20% while evening<br />
calls since November 1978 have been reduced to 40% of the<br />
day rate. For distances between 50 165 kilometres<br />
there have been daytime reductions of between 10 20 per cent<br />
and since may this year, Telecom has created a single zone for<br />
distances between 165 645 kilometres. This has given a<br />
reduction in many long distance S. T. D. calls of over<br />
These reductions are part of the picture of rapid change<br />
in telecommunications, sometimes incomprehensible innovation,<br />
the significance of which escapes those of us who are mere<br />
consumers of the benefits, but poor students of the mechanisms<br />
which provide them.<br />
Needless to say, Black Mountain Tower, when first proposed<br />
was unable to escape the penalties of innovation. And because<br />
of this, its birth has been slow and sometimes difficult.<br />
But the challenge of censure has passed the Black Mountain<br />
Tower and it is now an important part of Canberra.<br />
Built at a cost of $ 15.3 million, it is now included in a<br />
great national communications asset whose value approaches<br />
billion, with an annual investment of around $ 1 billion.<br />
This network will continue to expand and improve to meet<br />
the public's needs. As one measure of this, I point to the<br />
fact that this year half a million new telephone services will<br />
be installed in Australia.<br />
Tonight's gathering acknowledges the widespread benefits that<br />
modern technology properly applied can produce. The<br />
Telecommunications Tower on Black Mountain is an important<br />
development for Canberra; but it is more than that, it is a<br />
significant extension in the overall telecommunications<br />
facilities that we need as Australia gears up for the 1980' s.<br />
I am delighted to be with you tonight. I congratulate<br />
Telecom and all who have been responsible for this project.<br />
Particularly, I congratulate the workmen on the site of'<br />
the tower, who have braved Canberra's own brand of chilly<br />
winter to bring this tower into being.<br />
It is now my pleasant task, to coin a well known phrase<br />
I can't remember who said it to turn on the lights and<br />
declare the Black Mountain Tower open. </p>
