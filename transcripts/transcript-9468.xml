PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MERCER, " TODAY TONIGHT", CHANNEL 7<br />
31 JANUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: First up tonight though it's back to business for the Prime Minister Paul<br />
Keating. Today we find out the economy's boiling over, a tough<br />
Budget is now being predicted. Prime Minister Paul Keating joins me<br />
in the studio. Prime Minister, welcome to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you Neil.<br />
J: What do you most admire about John Howard?<br />
PM: Just the view that if you hang around long enough you might get asked<br />
a second time, that's all. If you're tenacious and you stick there.<br />
When Peacock left somebody said well you know if you leave, you<br />
might leave the job, but Johnny said I've been there that long I don't<br />
care any more.<br />
J: But you would have to admire his resilience, the fact that he has hung<br />
in there.<br />
PM: Yes, I think that's to be admired but I don't admire his lack of policy<br />
ambition or his lack of achievement.<br />
J: He's surely though the most formidable opponent you've had in the last<br />
few years?<br />
PM: That's what they said about John Hewson. That's what they said about<br />
Alexander Downer. Ten months ago it was the dream team, the young<br />
turks, Alex and Peter Costello. See the Liberal Party, this is the<br />
Liberal Party's third choice and you're asking the Australian people to<br />
be their first choice. In other words, when John Hewson lost the<br />
election they had a chance then of making a clean break and saying<br />
well look, John's gone we'd better go to John Howard. No, they said </p>
<p>no we won't do that, we'll go back to John Hewson. When he fell over<br />
they said maybe we should go to John Howard. No, no we won't go to<br />
John Howard, we'll go to Alexander Downer. They've gone to him<br />
because there is no one else.<br />
J: But surely he's a more formidable opponent than Alexander Downer<br />
was?<br />
PM: I just don't accept that...<br />
J: He's a better parliamentary performer?<br />
PM: He is a better parliamentary performer but one of the things I'm very<br />
pleased about Neil in Australia is the Government has at least over a<br />
decade now lifted the policy debate and the policy expectations. The<br />
public want value. They don't want parliamentary hijinks, they want<br />
Government policies. So that's where I think we're strong and he's<br />
weak.<br />
J: You're not the best of mates with him though and I'll just read you a<br />
quote that you said in the 1980s and it was this: I will do everything I<br />
can to crucify him, obliterate him from the leadership. They are very<br />
strong words. Do you still feel that strongly?<br />
PM: But why did I say that? Because he had one of his backbenchers in<br />
one of the most sleazy attacks ever raising personal matters about my<br />
personal life. That's why I said it.<br />
J: Have you forgiven him for that?<br />
PM: Everything has its place. You see, I don't refer at all to the personal<br />
lives of Liberals. Never have and won't do it.<br />
J: Have you forgiven him for that?<br />
PM: Oh it's way back in the dark ages, yes.<br />
J: Will you still crucify him?<br />
PM: I don't think it's fair of you to ask me that question. What I'll do is, look<br />
John Howard has got three policies. One is income splitting for<br />
families, the other is to cut the wages of people under $ 35,000,<br />
average weekly earnings, what he calls labour market reform, and the<br />
other is a sort of corner shopkeeper's crankiness about red tape. You<br />
know, knock over the Government sector. They're his three policies.<br />
Nothing's changed in twenty years.<br />
J: But to be fair to him on income splitting, he said he's now prepared to<br />
be more flexible, the Liberal Party is going to be a broad church. </p>
<p>Surely that makes him a lot more difficult for you to combat than<br />
Alexander Downer who was clearly accident-prone.<br />
PM: Let me make this clear about him. John Howard left an inward-looking,<br />
moribund, low-growth, high unemployment, high inflation economy.<br />
J: And he would say you gave us the recession.<br />
PM: That's what he left us. Ring-fenced by tariffs, a managed exchange<br />
rate, a wage explosion, eleven per cent unemployment and ten per<br />
cent inflation. It took this Government to open Australia up, to do all<br />
those things and knock over the tariff wall, to float the dollar, to open<br />
up the financial markets, to get back to back best practice, to get nine<br />
kids in ten completing secondary school, to give us a future as an<br />
educated country. That's why the Government will always beat a John<br />
Howard Opposition.<br />
J: He also says you're, and this was just recently, a part-time Prime<br />
Minister. That in recent times, you've taken your hands off the wheel.<br />
PM: In the last year I've had Working Nation, the largest package ever for<br />
dealing with retraining and reskilling the labour market and dealing<br />
with the long-term unemployed. The cultural policy, with support for<br />
the arts and multi-media. The Budget of last year. APEC, sewing<br />
Australia up in the Asia-Pacific. The drought policy, develop income<br />
support for farmers. I mean we couldn't have done any more last year.<br />
In fact we did more last year than I think any Government since the<br />
war.<br />
J: Alright Prime Minister, we have to leave it there just for the moment.<br />
We'll be back with more from the Prime Minister right after the break.<br />
Stay with us.<br />
J: Prime Minister, just before the break, we were talking about John<br />
Howard saying, you had taken your hands off the wheel and indicative<br />
of that was the shemozzle over woodchips.<br />
PM: Well woodchips is a complex issue and there are three thousand, I<br />
mean I reject absolutely this hands off the wheel notion, as I said this<br />
was the toughest year and the biggest year last year I think any<br />
Government's had, certainly since the war. But woodchips is a<br />
complex issue. We've got what we call a coupe, 150 metres square.<br />
There's three and a half thousand of them and picking which ones<br />
have got high conservation value and which haven't, is very hard for a<br />
Cabinet.<br />
J: But in terms of a political problem, you said I'm going to lob a grenade<br />
in there you have dropped a grenade on your foot, and you have<br />
alienated both the Greens and the timber workers? </p>
<p>PM: Well that might suggest to people look, what we have got here now<br />
is a decision for the nation. It doesn't suit the timber workers, and it<br />
doesn't suit the Greens but it is right for Australia. What it does is<br />
preserves those high-quality, high-conservation value stands of trees,<br />
which I think it is a crime to see cut some of these stands of old trees<br />
that can be protected and ought to be. What we have done is to set<br />
these aside for examination, to see which are truly in that position.<br />
Now, if before Christmas 200 coupes were set aside, the Greens<br />
would have thought it was a fabulous decision. I have set aside 500,<br />
and because they think they have got the Government under pressure,<br />
they are saying " Oh no, we're not having that", the timber workers are<br />
saying " oh no, this is too much", so maybe it gives the public the<br />
inkling that we have probably got this about right now.<br />
J: Alright Prime Minister, lets move onto the major economic statement<br />
today can you guarantee say to us tonight that in the coming May<br />
Budget, there will be no increase in taxes?<br />
PM: What I can say to you Neil is that this is the fastest growing Western<br />
world economy, with the lowest levels of tax and low inflation. What I<br />
can say to you is we will be keeping that going, and the Budget is<br />
about keeping that going. This Government was hired and rehired in<br />
1983 to produce growth, job security and employment. We have done<br />
that. But we have now got a very strong economy, and basically have<br />
to temper it and that is the job of the Budget.<br />
J: Ralph Willis said today at his press conference, apparently, " there will<br />
be some resort to tax increases". Do you agree with that?<br />
PM: None of us can pre-empt what the Cabinet will do, but<br />
J: But it has to be one or the other?<br />
PM: Well that is what I am trying to say it will come this way it will come<br />
by either some increase in revenue, cuts in Government spending, or<br />
sales in Government assets.<br />
J: Which do you favour?<br />
PM: You'll see. I did, as Treasurer, 9 Budgets and 7 May Statements I did<br />
16 Budgets, virtually, and we'll be doing another one.<br />
J: Can you understand why a lot of people would be apprehensive about<br />
what is happening we saw 3 rises in interest rates, the economy is<br />
supposedly going well as you say why are we seeing the rises in<br />
interest rates, and Government spending about to be cut?<br />
PM: Neil, let's get this on the record 6% growth and 2% inflation in the last<br />
year is the best economic year since the War, fullstop... </p>
<p>J: But you can understand that people are hurting out there?<br />
PM: the interest rates are basically a premium for the security for the<br />
future in other words, how we do we keep this growth and<br />
employment running so that people don't have to worry about their<br />
jobs, where they are seeing unemployment come down, where they<br />
are seeing growth and incomes rise, where they are seeing company<br />
profits and investments rise. The increase in interest rates that we<br />
have seen are basically a premium on that security.<br />
J: Will we see any more increases in interest rates in the near future?<br />
PM: Well, I don't believe that.....<br />
J: They would be appropriate?<br />
PM: I don't believe there is a cause for any adjustment, and that is why the<br />
Treasurer again stressed today that in terms of policy, we will be<br />
looking at the Budget.<br />
J: Okay Prime Minister, we have to wrap up very quickly are you looking<br />
forward to the year?<br />
PM: Absolutely. This is the ultimate high-wire business this is my 26th<br />
year at it there has got to be something about it that keeps me going.<br />
J: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Good luck with the program.<br />
J: Thank you.<br />
