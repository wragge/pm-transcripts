<p>Mr Rudd has now confirmed what many of us knew to be the case. The union bosses will not allow a Rudd Labor government to keep Australian Workplace Agreements in any shape or form.</p>
<p>The opposition leader has categorically ruled them out. Under a Labor government they or anything like them will be gone lock stock and barrel.</p>
<p>This has followed an elaborate pantomime in which Mr Rudd has been the principal villain.</p>
<p>The union bosses forced Kim Beazley, when he was leader, to promise that he would tear up AWAs. Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard duly repeated this pledge.</p>
<p>But when the mining industry, in particular, pointed out how much damage would be done to Australia's booming resources sector by such an approach the opposition leader commenced a pattern of deception.</p>
<p>He pretended to consult. With a serious face he said he would listen to the mining industry, hinting that the anti- AWA policy would be softened at the edges.</p>
<p>It is now clear that this was all a charade, a hoax to encourage the Australian public to believe that Labor supported a more balanced and moderate policy on workplace agreements.</p>
<p>The union bosses brought the curtain down on all of this. They forced Mr Rudd to retreat publicly from any flirtation with moderation.</p>
<p>He has done their bidding and completely scotched any possibility of Labor weakening its hard line opposition to Australian Workplace Agreements.</p>
<p>And this has happened while Labor is still in opposition. It is but a taste of what life would be like under a union dominated Rudd Labor government-egged on by eight state and territory Labor governments.</p>
