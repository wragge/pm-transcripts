    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to welcome His Excellency Dr Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to Australia from 2-5 April.</p>
<p>This visit, the first to Australia by an Afghan President, reflects the strong bond between our two nations.</p>
<p>Afghanistan and Australia share a solid connection which has been forged over more than a century of shared history and contact between our two peoples.</p>
<p>From the early Afghan cameleers in the 1860s, through to the Australian military effort to free Afghanistan of terrorism, the two nations have long maintained a healthy partnership, built on a foundation of mutual respect.</p>
<p>During this visit, discussions will focus on our ongoing security and development cooperation to help Afghanistan in its efforts to become more prosperous, secure and self-reliant.</p>
<p>In particular, we will seek to enhance partnership between our nations in a number of fields including women’s and girls’ empowerment, public sector capacity building and agricultural productivity.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting with President Ghani during this historic visit.</p>
