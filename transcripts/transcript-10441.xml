MEDIA RELEASE<br />
LANCE BARNARD<br />
Lance Barnard was a great citizen of Tasmania and Australia who made a signficant<br />
contribution to Launceston, to the Labor Party, and to the nation.<br />
I always found himn to be a kindly man, and he will have a place in history as a Minister for a<br />
record number of portfolios at the very start of the Whitlam Labo~ r Government in December<br />
1992. 1le went on to give service as Ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland from 1975 to<br />
1978 and hc maintained an active interest in a wide range of matters in his twilight years.<br />
On behalf of the Prime Minister and the Government, I extend sympathy to his wife Jill and<br />
the Barnard family for their loss of a loved one, a man who it was a privilege to know.<br />
