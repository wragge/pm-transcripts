PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT<br />
INTERVIEW WITH'CHANNEL 0, MELBOURNE, AT THE MELBOURNE SHOW.<br />
24 July 1978<br />
QUESTION: Mr Fraser, there has been some suggestion there are<br />
people here from overseas looking to buy rams for export. Are<br />
you worried about any confrontation with the Trade Union<br />
movement over this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that the matter can be handled quietly,<br />
and I also -t-hink it will sort itself out. In one sense it is<br />
not a great matter, but it is important to the people concerned.<br />
I also think it is important from the point of view of upgrading<br />
world wool supplies, because if we accept that all wool available<br />
is good wool I think that helps the industry generally. I would<br />
have to say that the suggestion that people can put an arbitrary<br />
limit on exports, or direct Australia's exports, tell any<br />
particular group of producers that they can't export to certain<br />
countries if you accept any of those propositions, you are<br />
accepting something that is very serious for the future of<br />
Australia, because we are an exporting nation, our capacity to<br />
employ depends upon exports and depends upon access to the world's<br />
market overseas. Against that general background the principle<br />
that Australians exporters, whether they are primiry industries,<br />
secondary industry or miners, ought to be able to send their<br />
products overseas without restriction, is a very important<br />
principle. QUESTION: If the ACTU does seem reluctant to resolve, what would<br />
be the Government's reaction to confrontation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We support the principle that I've just mentioned.<br />
I don't beli-1eve there will be confrontation, I don't really<br />
believe that anyone wants confrontation. I also believe it will<br />
sort itself out adequately, and that if there are some purchasers<br />
from overseas that they will get to the buys without too much<br />
trouble. </p>
