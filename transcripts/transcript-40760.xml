    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Prime Minister of New Zealand: </strong>Can I welcome you Prime Minister, and the economic ministers. We’re very fortunate to be in this part of the world, beside each other and beside the better performing economies in the developed world - particularly the Australian economy, 25 years without a recession. It is a great opportunity today to hear from our four economic ministers here about the different aspects of policy that we’re undergoing to sustain this positive and increasingly [inaudible] economic outlook. So we’re looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>Prime Minister: </strong>Well thank you Bill and thank you for your very warm welcome. After your many years of successful stewardship of New Zealand’s finances and economy, we’re looking forward to hearing from you and your colleagues about how you’ve made such a great success of the New Zealand economy. We’re all committed to free trade and open markets. We know that trade means jobs and we’ve been talking about that earlier and we look forward to continuing to do that. We want to make that close economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand, closer still. It’s a great partnership and on that foundation, we’ve built strong economic growth, more jobs and prosperity for Australians and New Zealanders over many years and many years to come.</p>
