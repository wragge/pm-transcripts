ROYAL VISIT 1974<br />
The following statement has been released from<br />
Buckingham Palace today<br />
" The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh have<br />
accepted invitations from the Governments of New<br />
Zealand and Australia to visit those countries in<br />
the first quarter of 1974.<br />
The Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied by The<br />
Princess Anne, will arrive in New Zealand in time<br />
to open the Commonwealth Games in Christchurch on<br />
24 January 1974.<br />
The Queen will arrive by air in New Zealand on<br />
or about Wednesday 30 January to attend final stages<br />
of the Games and perform the closing ceremony on<br />
Saturday 2 February.<br />
At the conclusion of the Games, Her Majesty and<br />
Their Royal Highnesses will visit some other parts of<br />
New Zealand departing in the Royal Yacht BRITANNIA on<br />
or about 8 February.<br />
Thereafter they will visit Norfolk Island and<br />
Papua New Guinea.<br />
The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will then go<br />
by air to South Australia, Western Australia and the<br />
Northern Territory.<br />
In South Australia their visit will coincide with<br />
the centenary of the University of Adelaide."<br />
My Government and I are delighted that The Queen and<br />
The Duke of Edinburgh have been able to accept an invitation<br />
to re-visit Australia in February/ March next year after the<br />
Commonwealth Games in New Zealand and so soon after their<br />
visit in October for the opening of the Sydney Opera House. </p>
<p>We are also pleased that The Queen and<br />
The Princess Anne will make their first visit to Norfolk<br />
Island the Papua New Guinea.<br />
( The Duke of Edinburgh has previously visited<br />
Papua New Guinea in 1956 and in 1971. He has twice visited<br />
Norfolk Island in 1956 and again in 1968.)<br />
I discussed the prospect of the visit to Papua<br />
New Guinea with Mr. Somare when I was in Port Moresby in<br />
February. He told me that he would be pleased if such a<br />
visit could be made.<br />
Princess Anne however, cannot participate in<br />
the visit to the Australian mainland.<br />
The precise amount of time to be spent in South<br />
Australia and Western Australia has not been determined<br />
though it is unlikely in either instance to exceed three<br />
days. At Darwin The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will<br />
rejoin the Royal Yacht for their departure from Australia.<br />
