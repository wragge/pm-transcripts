VISIT TO THE US AND CANADA<br />
SYDNEY, N. S. W.<br />
ARRIVAL PRESS CCNFERENCE GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON, ON ARRIVAL a:<br />
AT MASCOT AIRPORT6 6APR I L 16<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Good morning, gentlemen. I think I have been<br />
travelling for 26 hours, if my count is right. I will thro~ w this open<br />
to anything you might want to ask me for a few minutes before I go<br />
to get some rest.<br />
Q. What were the results of your talks with<br />
Mr Nixon, Sir?<br />
PM: I think I would put it this way, that the real<br />
value of them, although it wasn't worked out to be that way, was<br />
that they laid the groundwork they were preliminary talks they<br />
laid the grundwork for further pursuit of the subjects in May,<br />
after there has been time for full American consideration of those<br />
subjects. I think their real value lay in opening up all these subjects<br />
so that in May there would be far more detailed consideration and I<br />
think therefore, more valuable talks as a result.<br />
Q. Sir, can you see any changes in American<br />
policy in the Pacific area as a result of Mr Nixon's conversation<br />
with you?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I wouldn't presume to say<br />
that definitely, but I think the new American administration is<br />
re-examining problems in all parts of the world. But I am sure in<br />
my own mind that they are not putting the South-East Asian area<br />
the Pacific area away. They are not saying " Well, this is no<br />
longer important". I am sure they have a full realisation of the<br />
importance to the world of this region as well as the other regions<br />
which they are re-examining generally.<br />
Q. What are the main subjects on which these<br />
investigations will be taking place and which you will be discussing<br />
later with the President?<br />
PM: Well, we will be talking about I will<br />
be talking about the stability and security of the particular region<br />
in which we are closely interested, and of the American attitude<br />
towards that, towards the economic assistance in that area, towards<br />
trade assistance in that area, towards all kinds of assistance in<br />
that area. We will be talking about though not reaching conclusions<br />
on, of course the situation in Vietnam. There will be further<br />
matters to be reported there. Then there are trade matters as well<br />
.2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM ( Contd. which are by no means Insignificant the question of meat exports<br />
and wheat exports and then with Dr Kissinger, or with the<br />
Secretary of Defence or the Secretary of State, there will be a<br />
number of " nuts and bolts" things. These will be not so much<br />
procurement in Australia of buying sugar in order to feed<br />
the troops in Vietnam, but rather manufacturing parts here, . the<br />
cross-fertilisation of military equipment that kind Of " nuts and<br />
bolts" talk.<br />
Q. Did you discuss the Australian wheat freights with<br />
Mr Trudeau?<br />
PM: I did mention that we knew there was alleged to be<br />
a problem. I had rather longer discussions on them with Mr Pepin<br />
who is the Trade Minister and who will be visiting Auatralla quite<br />
shortly. They,. I think, have a view, although I pointed out it<br />
hadn't been demonstrated to us, that while Australia has not got<br />
this price below the IGA minimum for wheat, it is perhaps not<br />
working out its freight rates in accordance with some rather<br />
complicated formula. I don't believe that has been demonstrated<br />
and I said so, but it is the subject of technical discussion at the<br />
present moment, I understand.<br />
Q. Can you see any chnange in the rates?<br />
PM: Well, I can't, as I say, because this is a matter of<br />
technical discusrion in Washington now, I believe, between our own<br />
representatives and others to see whether anything of that kind is<br />
happening. But what is quite certain is that Canada and the United<br />
States have dropped their wheat prices below the IGA minimum and<br />
the United States say they have had to do it because of thi~ s freight<br />
business. Well, this will all be worked out to see whether it is<br />
a matter of fact; whether it~ r isn't so. What is quite clear is that<br />
all three countries must see that th-IGA works, that nobody does<br />
undercut, that it does work because it is to the benefit of all of us<br />
that it should.<br />
Q. Judging from the press conferences that you had in<br />
Canada, they were very concerned by it.<br />
PM: Well, wheat is of immense significance to Canada<br />
and ourselves and indeed to the United States. It is of great<br />
significance to all three countries, and there is an awful lot of<br />
prairie and wheatgrowing land in Canada.<br />
Q. Sir, there were reports that you were discussing<br />
mutual projects recently ; 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
PM: We were-talking, but not talking specifically, on the<br />
approach -wicti. Mr Trudeau had made clear he felt Canada should take<br />
that is looking rather more towards the Pacific countries and,<br />
I take it, South-East Asian countries and Asian countries generally.<br />
There were no mutual projects, but I took the opportunity to say<br />
where we thought things coiuld be done of advantage to the region<br />
generally.<br />
Q. In your talks with Mr Nixoin, and Dr Kissinger, Sir,<br />
did the question of America' k possible change of attitude to Red<br />
China come up for dis cussion and any possible effects it may have<br />
on our own attitude?<br />
PM: No. It didn't come up for discussion at all. It wasn't<br />
raised. Are you basing this on the speech by Senator Kennedy?<br />
Q. No. On the reports that were received back. Is it<br />
likely to come up at the next meeting?<br />
PM: I haven't got it down, and I have had no indications<br />
myself that there is likely to be a discussion.<br />
Q. Did you receive any indication of the progress of peace<br />
talks in Paris?<br />
PM: I had an indicatioin of what was happening in Paris, but<br />
this was in private conversation and I am afraid it must remain<br />
entirely private. I wouldn't make any comments of any kind up tin it.<br />
Q. Sir, what were your impressions of Nixon as a leader?<br />
PM: Well, I think you kn ow because I had an informal<br />
press conference with some of the Australian boys over there.<br />
I believe he will be a great leader of the United States. I liked him<br />
very much as a man, as you know. Sometimes you meet people and<br />
you really do like them. Somctimcs more rarely yuu dislike them.<br />
Very often they are just people. I really did like him as a man and<br />
s0 1 might be a little coloured in my judgment. But I think he s hould<br />
be great because they have terrific problems in so many parts of the<br />
world and in their own country, and they really do seem to be<br />
digging in to try to find out and define the problems and what the<br />
causes of them are, and this must be the first step towards trying<br />
to solve them. I would hate to have the burden of trying to solve<br />
them myself </p>
