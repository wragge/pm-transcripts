] RIME' MINISTER'S BRO;; DCA; T ON CIAUNL., 7 26 OCTOFER 1975<br />
Last week I mentioned to you about the torrent of<br />
telegrams that I'd been receiving protesting against the<br />
Opposition's unprecedented action in delaying the debate<br />
on the Budget Bills. Since then I've attended many public<br />
meetings last Monday in Melbourne's City Square;<br />
on Friday in Sydney's Hyde Park; and just this afternoon<br />
in Melbourne's Town Hall. And on each occasion it's been<br />
remarkablethe sense of outrage that ordinary citizens have<br />
felt at this unprecedented and unprincipled action by the<br />
Liberals and the Country Party.<br />
It was particularly moving in the Melbourne Town<br />
Hall this afternoon because there there were thousands<br />
of migrants people who'd come from countries where,<br />
sometimes, democracy has been destroyed, or where democracy<br />
is weak, or where democracy is under challenge. And they,<br />
more than most Australians, in December 1972, were impressed<br />
by the fact that in Australia, after a vigorous election<br />
campaign, there was a change of Government at the ballot<br />
box one Government was rejected and another one was elected<br />
by peaceful means. They were among the people who were most<br />
outraged, when after 17 months, there had to be another<br />
election in April and May last year. Againthey expected<br />
that the Government would be able to serve a three year term<br />
and now, for a second time, they find this challenge to<br />
Australian democracy, which they had respected. And they<br />
particularly are alert to the stratagems to which conservative<br />
forces will resort in order to look after their vested<br />
interests. And this year there have been three such<br />
examples: first of all, for the first time in 25 years<br />
since there's been proportional voting for the Senate, we<br />
found that two State Premiers replaced Labor senators by<br />
non-Labor senators; now for the first time in 75 years<br />
we find that the Senate is contemplating rejecting the<br />
Budget. Very often in the past the Government of the day<br />
hasn't had a majority in the Senate, and if half the<br />
senators vote against any proposition, if the votes in the<br />
Senate are 50-50) then the proposition is rejected.<br />
Now there have been 139 money Bills over a three-quarters of<br />
a century of our Federation which have been passed by the Senate:<br />
although the Government didn't have a majority in the Senate.<br />
This is the second principle, the second conventionwhich<br />
has been thrown out by the Liberals and Country Party last<br />
year and this year. And the third is that the Governor-General<br />
asks the State Governors to issue writs for the Senate and on<br />
24 previous occasions the Governors have always obeyed the<br />
Governor-General's suggestion. Nowfor the very first time<br />
in 75 years of our national Government the Premiers are<br />
contemplating advising the Governors to rebuff the Governor-General.<br />
Now I point out that the Opposition has not rejected<br />
the Budget this would be too much for many of them.<br />
You might have seen in a program last night, and midday today,<br />
on another television station, where a Liberal senator said<br />
he would never vote against the Budget and he said that there<br />
were many of his colleagues of the same mind. But they're<br />
prepared to vote to delay the Budget they haven't got any / 2 </p>
<p>Budget proposals to put in its stead; Mr Fracer has now<br />
used the great phrase about his own Budget proposals<br />
that they are ' inoperative'. lie says that if there is<br />
to be an election to the House of Representatives, then<br />
they'd pass the Labor Budget but of course he is not<br />
prepared to give the Government, which has a majority<br />
in the whole Parliament and a majority in the HIouse of<br />
Representatives, the opportunity to govern for the three<br />
years for which it was elected. It can continue to pay<br />
the public servants, the soldiers, all the accounts; until<br />
the end of November. We're satisfied that after that)<br />
alternative arrangements can be made. I point out to<br />
you that the Government can get money by borrowing or<br />
from taxes, but the Constitution says no money shall be<br />
drawn from the Treasury except under Appropriation made<br />
by law. Now our opponents are trying to frustrate<br />
the Constitution by refusing to make those Appropriations.<br />
I trust that everybody who is on the Australian<br />
Government's payroll -civilian and military, and people<br />
who rely on the Australian Government to pay for the<br />
services and the supplies they render will be patient and<br />
will except the assurance that they will finally be paid.<br />
The Australian Government will do all it can to mitigate<br />
the hardships that they endure. But we are determined<br />
that the Government which has a majority in the people's<br />
House, the House of Representatives, will not be frustrated<br />
by this unprecedented, unprincipled use of the Senate,<br />
where nobody has a majority, where no Governments can<br />
be formed.. The people are entitled to have the Government<br />
they elected. </p>
