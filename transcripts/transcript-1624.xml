FOR PRESS: 9 JUL LIBRV P. M. No. 72/ 1967<br />
CORIO BY-ELECTION: MR WHITLAM'S CLAIMS<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Mr Whitlam, as Members of the Federal Parliament well know,<br />
has little regard for the truth when it stands in his political path. In his<br />
eagerness to score in Corio, te has again resorted to fabrication. He<br />
alleged last night that, prior to the last Federal Election a " deal" had<br />
been made for Mr Opperman to go to Malta as High Commissioner. Not<br />
only so the allegation runs were Mr Opperman and I party to the<br />
arrangement, but the Government of Malta was also aware of it. In all<br />
these particulars, Mr Whitlam's statements are untrue. On the basis,<br />
however, of this piece of fiction, he makes the accusation that a confidence<br />
trick has been perpetrated on Corio, electors. There was no discussion<br />
between me and anybody else and this includes Mr Opperman and the<br />
Government of Malta until after the results of the general election were<br />
known and I had been able to give thought to the composition of the Cabinet.<br />
A moment'B analysis will show how silly, as well as unfounded,<br />
the allegations are. The Government had a comfortable majority in the<br />
Corio area at the last Senate election, and subsequent public opinion<br />
polling had clearly indicated that we were again set for a good win in that<br />
seat. It would have been much more convenient for the Government to win<br />
the seat, as we would confidently have expected to do, with a new candidate,<br />
than subject ourselves to the inconvenience, effort, expense and hazards<br />
of a by-election. His loose and unsupported charge that my speech to the World<br />
Affairs Council . n Los Angeles, supporting the United States Administration's<br />
bombing of North Vietnam, had embarrassed the Johnson Administration,<br />
Is equally baseless and silly. Apart from my direct contacts with President<br />
Johnson personally, my Government is in constant communication with his<br />
Administration at the diplomatic level. We can claim a deeper insight and<br />
closer knowledge of what that Administration Js thinking than Mr VWhitlam<br />
can possibly possess.<br />
