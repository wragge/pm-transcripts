SPEECH BY THE PRJN'E MINISTER, E. G. WHIT1LJ1, M.<br />
TO THE APEX CONVENT1iOWI ALURY<br />
FRIDAY, 1VLARCH 2 1975<br />
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION A NEW PARTNERSHIP<br />
THE BASIC CONTRACT BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WAS SPELT OUT IN THE POLICY<br />
SPEECH WHICH I DELIVERED ON BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
PARTY FOR THE ELECTIONS OF i972. IN THAT SPEECH I SAID:-<br />
" OUR PROGRAM HAS THREE GREAT AIMS. THEY ARE:<br />
To PROMOTE EQUALITY;<br />
To INVOLVE THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA IN<br />
THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES OF OUR' LAND;<br />
AND TO LIBERATE THE TALENTS AND UPLIFT THE<br />
HORIZONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE".<br />
THE INTERVENING TWO YEARS'AND FOUR MONTHS HAS<br />
BEEN A PERIOD OF VERY GREAT TURBULENCE AND TURMOIL AT HOME<br />
AND AROUND THE WORLD. GOVERNMENTS EVERYWHERE HAVE HAD TO<br />
DEAL WITH PROBLEMS OF RAPID CHANGE NOT EXPERIENCED IN THE<br />
LIFETIME OF THE OLDEST OF US HERE, IN ALL THE MIXED ECOr" OMIES1<br />
THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS UNDERGOING UNEXAMPLED STRESS. IN ALL<br />
THE DEMOCRACIES, THE POLITICAL SYSTEMS ARE UNDER PROFOUND<br />
CHALLENGE. GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESSe ORGANISATIONS, GROUPS,<br />
FAMILIES, INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING CALLED UPON TO ADJUST AND<br />
ADAPT TO CHANGE AT A PACE AND TO A DEGREE SELDOM, IF EVER,<br />
ENCOUNTERED IN H-ISTORY. s12 </p>
<p>IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT MIGHT APPEAR THAT PRINCIPLES<br />
PROCLAIMED FOR THE PURPOSES OF AN ELECTION MORE THAN<br />
TWO YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE LITTLE RELEVANCE TODAY. THERE MAY<br />
BE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE SHEER NUM", BER OF DECISIONS WHICH<br />
HAVE HAD TO BE MADE, THE SPEED WITH WHICH THEY HAVE HAD TO<br />
BE MADE HAVE OBSCURED OR EVEN OVER-RIDDEN BASIC PRINCIPLES,<br />
IDO BELIEVE, HOWEVER. THAT IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE YEARSO<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE SEEN TO HAVE PROMOTED THE<br />
THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES I PUT FORWARD IN 1972,. THE PRINCIPLES<br />
WHICH ARE THE BASIS OF OUR CONTRACT WITH THE PEOPLE, WITH<br />
FIDELITY AND CONSISTENCY.<br />
AT THIS APEX CONVENTION, IT IS THOROUGHLY<br />
APPROPRIATE THAT I SHOULD TRY TO PUT THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE PERSPECTIVE'OF<br />
THE SECOND AIM WHICH I ASSERTED IN 1972 TO INVOLVE THE<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES OF<br />
OUR NATION. IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT I SHOULD DO SO BEFORE AN<br />
AUDIENCE OF APEXIANS, MEMBERS OF THE MOST CONCERNED, THE<br />
MOST INVOLVED OF ALL OUR COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANISATIONS.<br />
IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT I SHOULD DO SO IN THIS CITY, WHERE<br />
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN ONE OF THE HIGHEST TASKS THAT<br />
CIVILISED MAN-CAN UNDERTAKE THE CREATION OF A GREAT CITYWILL<br />
BE CRUCIAL IN DETERMINING THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF A<br />
NOBLE EXPERIMENT. me J3 </p>
<p>3<br />
THE PROGRAI-UNDERTAKEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS MEANT A GREATER DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT BY THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS LIKE SCHOOLS. HOSPITALS, iWELFARE AND<br />
CITIES THAN HAD HITHERTO BEEN ACCEPTED IN AUSTRALIA, THE<br />
UN4DERLYING PHILOSOPHY IS THIS: IN MODERN COMMUNITIES, EVEN<br />
THE WEALTHIEST FAMILY CANNO0T PROVIDE ITS MEMBERS WITH THE<br />
BEST EDUCATION, WITH THE BEST MEDICAL TREATMENT, THE BEST<br />
ENVIRONMENT, UNAIDED BY THE COMMUNITY. INCREASINGLY, THE<br />
BASIC SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES WHICH DETERMINE THE REAL<br />
STANDARD OF LIFE OF A FAMILY OR AN INDIVIDUAL CAN ONLY BE<br />
PROVIDED BY THE COMMUNITY AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH<br />
THE COMMUNITY IS WILLINIG TO PROVIDE THEM. EITHER THE COMMUNITY<br />
PROVIDES THEM OR THEY WILL NOT BE* PROVIDED AT ALL. IN THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN CONT EXT, THIS MEANS THAT THE COMMUNITY, THROUGH<br />
THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, MUST FINANCE THEM OR THEY WILL NOT<br />
BE FINANCED AT ALL. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED<br />
THAT THESE SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE PROVIDED AND<br />
THAT THEY WILL BE FINANCED. AND A NATIONAL FINANCIAL<br />
COMMITMENT MUST INEVITABLY MEAN A NATIONAL INVOLVEMENT.<br />
BOTH BEFORE AND SINCE WE CAME TO OFFICE, THIS<br />
APPROACH THIS NATIONAL INVOLVEMENT HAS BEEN CRITICISED<br />
ON A NUMBER OF GROUNDS, I'D LIKE TO DEAL WITH TWO OF THE<br />
CRITICISMS. ONE IS THE CHARGE OF CENTRALISM. THE OTHER IS<br />
THE FEAR THAT A BLOATED BUREAUCRACY BUREAUCRACIES ARE OF<br />
COURSE ALWAYS BLOATED -THE FEAR THAT UNFEELING PUBLIC<br />
SERVANTS IN CANBERRA -AND PUBLIC SERVANTS IN CANBERRA ARE<br />
ALWAYS UNFEELING WILL DESTROY COMMUNITY INITIATIVE, &amp; a </p>
<p>COMMUNI-TY INVOLVEMENT, EITHER BY MAKING VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS<br />
LIKE APEX REDUNDANT OR BY THROTTLiING THEM WITH RED<br />
TAPE. IMAINTAIN, ON THE CONTRARY, THESE TWO PROPOSITIONS:-<br />
FIRST, THAT OUR NATIONAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMS WILL<br />
REPLACE THE EXISTING STATE CENTRALISM WITH GENUINE REGIONAL<br />
INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION;<br />
AND SECONDLY, THAT THE PROGRAMS PROVIDE FOR, OR<br />
RATHER, POSITIVELY, REQUIRE A LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT AND<br />
INITIATIVE BY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY WHICH<br />
MAKES THE WORK OF VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS LIKE APEX MORE<br />
RELEVANT, MORE REWARDING, MORE EFFECTIVE, MORE EXCITING,<br />
THAN EVER BEFORE. LATER, I SHALL REFER TO SOME SPECIFIC PROGRAMS<br />
IN WELFARE, HEALTH, EDUCATION AND AREA IMPROVEMENT WHERE<br />
WE SEEK AND NEED PARTICIPATION BY AND COOPERATION WITH<br />
COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS, PROGRAMS IN WHICH APEX IS ALREADY<br />
INVOLVED. I SHOULD SAY, HOWEVER, THAT OUR WISH FOR COMMUNITY<br />
INVOLVEMENT IS BEING PUT-INTO EFFECT OVER A VERY WIDE RANGE<br />
OF POLICY MAKING AND DECISION TAKING. a </p>
<p>THE NUMEROUS ROYAL COMMISSIONS, COMMITTEES OF INQUIRY<br />
AND TASK FORCES WE HAVE ESTABLISHED ARE NOT ONLY DESIGNED TO<br />
PROVIDE THE BEST ADVICE FROM THE BEST QUALIFIED MEN AND WOMEN.<br />
THEY HAVE ALSO DEIMONSTRATED OUR INTENTION TO HAVE IFULL PUBLIC<br />
INQUIRY AND FREE PUBLIC DEBATE BEFORE FAR-REACHING DECISIONS<br />
ARE TAKEN. THERE IS NO BETTER ILLUSTRATION THAN THE ROYAL<br />
COMISSION ON AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION ITSELF.<br />
HERE WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE VERY HEART OF THE MATTERTHE<br />
FUNDAMENTAL RELATION4S BETWEEN THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND<br />
THE GENERAL COMMUNITY.<br />
SHORTL&gt; AFTER ITS ESTABLISHMENT, THE COMMISSION<br />
INVITED INTERESTED ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE<br />
WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS TO IT ON MATTERS RELATING TO THE TERMS<br />
OF REFERENCE. THE COMMISSION'WROTE TO MORE THAN 150 GOVERNMENT<br />
AGENCIES AND 500 ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT<br />
AUSTRALIA, BUSINESS GROUPS, CHURCHES, VOLUNTARY SERVICE<br />
ORGANISATIONS, EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE ASSOCIATIONS, AND PROFESSIONAL<br />
AND WELFARE BODIES, TO INFORM THEM OF THE TERMS OF<br />
REFERENCE AND SEEKING THEIR COMMENTS.<br />
W4ITH THE AID OF THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF SOCIAL<br />
SERVICE, H ELP AND ENCOURAGEMENT WAS GIVEN TO LESS ARTICULATE<br />
AND LESS WELL-ORGANISED CITIZENS TO PREPARE SUBMISSIONS. THE<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION's ADVISER ON COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND HIS<br />
STAFF ASSISTED AND SOLICITED MANY SUCH SUBMISSIONS TO<br />
GENERATE AS WIDE A HEARING OF PUBLIC VIEWS AS POSSIBLE. 111/ 6 </p>
<p>AT EACH PLACE WHERE A FORM-' AL HEARING WAS HELD, PUBLIC MEETINGS<br />
WERE ARRANJGED FOR INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANISATIONS TO<br />
PUT FORWARD EITHER ORAL OR WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS, SIX HUNDRED<br />
PEOPLE TOOK PART IN THESE MEETINGS.<br />
THIS HAS BEEN AN EXAMPLE-0F COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION<br />
IN A MATTER OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE AT A LEVEL QUITE NEW<br />
To AUSTRALIA. 14E HAVE ADOPTED THE SAME APPROACH WITH THE WORKING<br />
GROUP ON RURAL POLICY WHICH PRODUCED THE GREEN PAPER ON<br />
RURAL POLICY, WITH THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION, AND<br />
WITH [ NVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT STATEMENTS, I! E HAVE TAKEN THE<br />
VIEW THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BY THE GOVERNED IS A FUNDAMENTAL<br />
CHARACTERISTIC OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, INITIALLY<br />
AND INEVITABLY, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WILL MEAN THAT THE<br />
BEST ORGANISED AND THE MOST ARTICULATE. THE MOST ACTIVE WILL<br />
TEND TO HAVE THE FIRST AND GREATEST SAY. WE DO WISH HOWEVER,<br />
TO* PROVIDE THE MACHINERY A14D TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF PUBLIC<br />
AWARENESS WHICH WILL ENABLE THE WHOLE PUBLIC TO BE INVOLVED<br />
AND INCLUDED IN A GENUINE, MEANINGFUL WAY.<br />
THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND<br />
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT iN DISCUSSING AND FORMING POLICY. W4E<br />
WANT HOWEVER, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT<br />
IN IMPLEMENTING POLICY. WHE WANT COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION<br />
THROUGH COMMUNITY ACTION, LET ME GIVE EXAMPLES OF HOW WE<br />
ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THIS IN THE FIELDS OF SOCIAL WELFARE,<br />
CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION, HEALTH AND THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE<br />
PLACES WE LIVE IN. </p>
<p>THE AUSTRALIAN Ass ISTANCE PLAN<br />
THE AUS T R tL I Ass ISTANCE PLAN IS A PIONEERING<br />
EXPERI'" IENT IN COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE<br />
IS TO SEEK OUT AND MEET AREAS OF SOCIAL N4EED HITHERTO EITHER<br />
IGNORED OR UNIDENTIFIED BY . THE-EXISTING WELFARE AGENCIESNATIONAL,<br />
STATE, LOCAL OR VOLUNTARY. ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC<br />
IS THAT ITS WORK IS BASED ON REGIONS, ON REGIONAL<br />
COMMUNITIES AND THAT ITS WORK AND PLANNING IS TO BE DONE<br />
BY GENUINELY INDEPENDENT, GENUINELY COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS<br />
OF CONCERNED CITIZENS WHO KNOW THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY OF WHICH THEY ARE A PART.<br />
THE 9ASIC PLANNING UNIT IS CALLED THE REGIONAL<br />
COUNCIL FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPM~ ENT. SUCH COUNCILS HAVE ALREADY<br />
BEEN SET UP IN THIRTY-SIX REGIONS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. THE<br />
COUNCILS ACT AS A COMMUNITY FORUM FOR DISCUSSION AND A<br />
COMMUNITY INSTRUMENT FOR ACTION IN IMPROVING EXISTING WELFARE<br />
SERVICES AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LONG RUN, EXPERIMENTING<br />
IN NEW FORMS OF WELFARE. As ITS CONTRIBUTION, THE<br />
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT: . VM AKES SPECIFIC GRANTS TO TH E REGIONAL COUNCILS<br />
TO COVER ADMINISTRATION;<br />
aPROVIDES A ' CAPITATION GRANT'I OF $ 2 FOR EACH<br />
PERSON4 IN THE REGION FOR SMALL SCALE, SHORTTERM<br />
SOCIAL WELFARE PROJECTS;<br />
aAND MAKES A ' COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT' GRANT TO<br />
PAY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS TO STIMULATE<br />
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. </p>
<p>ANJINITIATING .1 GRANT IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST THE FORMATION<br />
OF A COU1NCIL WITH DIVERSE REPRESENTATION FROM COMMUNITY<br />
ORGANISATION. THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONYOU WILl-BL AWARE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GoVER1NMENT<br />
HAS DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A CHILDREN'S COMMISSION, IN THE<br />
OPERATION OF THIS BODY, WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLE<br />
OF INVOLVING THE COMMUNITY AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE IN THE<br />
PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY THE<br />
COMM ISS ION. a THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSION WILL PROVIDE HELP FOR<br />
A WIDE RANGE OF IMAGINATIVE AND FLEXIBLE PROGRAMS DEVOTED<br />
TO LOOKING AFTER CHILDREN BEFORE THEY REACH SCHOOL AGE AND<br />
CARING FOR OLDER CHILDREN OUTSIDE SCHOOL HOURS,<br />
THE DECISION TO SET UP A CHILDREN'S COMMISSION<br />
WAS ITSELF A RESPONSE TO COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIONS FOR<br />
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN PROVIDING CARE FOR CHILDREN. IT<br />
RECOGNISES THAT THE CARE PROVIDED SHOULD NOT BE RIGID OR<br />
HIGHLY INSTITUTIONALISED,~ BUT THAT CHOICES FOR PARENTS AND<br />
THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD BE MAXIMISED: a a / 9 </p>
<p>THE POLICY OF THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSION WHEN IT<br />
1 L LI.; ANND, U TIHF INTlR IMN COMMf. ITTI:! vWlH ICH IS NOW<br />
CARRYING OUT ITS WORKK, I; ONE OF MAIllTAINING THE CLOSEST<br />
POCSS lLE CONTACT WITH THll: COMMUNITY.<br />
THE INTERIM COMMITTEE AND ITS VARIOUS STATE<br />
COMMITTEES HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED A NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR<br />
ASSISTANCE FROM COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS AND WILL BE ENCOURAGING<br />
MORE IN THE COMING FINANCIAL YEAR.<br />
PART OF THE FINANCE TO BE ALLOCATED BY THE<br />
CHILDREN'S COMMISSION WILL GO TO THE STATES FOR SPECIFIC<br />
PURPOSE GRANTS, AND PART OF THE FINANCE WILL GO DIRECT TO<br />
COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS. BUT THE COMMISSION WILL EXPECT<br />
THAT PROGRAMS TO BE SUPPORTED WILL BE THOSE WHICH THE<br />
COMMUNITY HAS SHOWN IT WANTS, NOT JUST THOSE WHICH IT HAS<br />
BEEN TOLD IT WANTS, AND THAT ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE RUNNING<br />
OF THE PROGRAMS WILL ALLOW FOR A GENUINE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. </p>
<p>SCHOOLS COMMIIISSIONJ THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERqNMENT HAS MADE AVAILABLE<br />
7.2 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE 1977-75 TRIENINIUiM TO SUPPORT<br />
INNOVATORY PROJECTS A: iD FIELD-13ASED EXPERIMENTS ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION. THE INNOVATIONS<br />
PROGRAM WAS ESTAB. ILS iHD TO ACCEPT PROPOSALS FROM SCHOOLS,<br />
TEACHERS, PARETNS, OR COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS.<br />
THE INNOVATIONS PROGRAM kRPRIESENTS A MAJOR<br />
EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR EDUCATIONAL<br />
SYSTEM THROUGH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY INITIATIVE<br />
AND THE DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE CENTRE TO<br />
THE REGION. THE GENERAL AIMS OF THE PROGRAM ARE:<br />
To IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SCHOOLING IN AUSTRALIA;<br />
TO ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY;<br />
TO STIMULATE INNOVATION IN SCHOOLS;<br />
To ENHANCE THE CAPACITIES OF ALL THOSE<br />
COMMITTED TO EDUCATION TO GENERATE<br />
THEIR OWN IMPROVEMENTS IN SCHOOLS. ./ 11 </p>

AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOING INTO HOSPITAL.<br />
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN DECISION-MAKING ON THEIR LOCAL<br />
HEALTH SERVICE WILL BE GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES TO INFLUENCE THE<br />
ACCEPTABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES. IT WILL ALSO<br />
PROVIDE A MEANS OF EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY AND CHANGING<br />
CONVENTIONAL EXPECTATIONS. PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE<br />
MANAGEMENT OF THEIR OWN HEALTH SERVICES WILL HAVE A BETTER<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIMITATIONS OF MEDICINE, THE COSTS AND<br />
EFFECTIVENESS OF PARTICULAR SERVICES, AND THE INDIVIDUAL'S<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERSONAL AND FAMILY HEALTH. ./ 12 </p>

THEY PROVIDE SOCIALLY MEANI INGFUL WORK FOR THE IMMEDIAT<br />
VICTIMS OF OUR PRESENT ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND THEY<br />
LEAVE BEHIND SOMETHINIG OF ENDURING WORTH TO THE COMMUNITY.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WELCOMES ANY APPLICATION FROM<br />
APEX CLUBS FOR APPROVAL FOR PROJLCTS WHICH WOULD HAVE A<br />
LASTING BENEFIT FOR THE COMMUNITY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME<br />
GIVING MEN AND WOMEN PRESENTLY UNEMPLOYED SATISFYING,<br />
WORTHWHILE WORK. THE WHOLE THRUST OF ALL THESE PROGRAMS<br />
AND I COULD MENTION MANY MORE IS THAT A GREAT NUMBER OF<br />
CONCERNED AUSTRALIAN MEN AND WOMEN ARE ALREADY INVOLVED<br />
IN COMMUNITY DECISION-MAKING AND COMMUNITY ACTION IN<br />
COOPERATION WITH GOVERNMENT, IN A WAY THAT WAS NEVER<br />
THOUGHT POSSIBLE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. IT IS IMPORTANT<br />
THAT WE AS A GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE MORE AND MORE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS, PARTICULARLY THE<br />
DISADVANTAGED AND THE HANDICAPPED IN OUR MIDST. . ll^ </p>
<p>BUT IT I " s EQUALLY I MPORTANT IN TERMS OF<br />
THE STRENGTH AND VIGOUR OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THAT<br />
THOSE OF US WHO ARiL NOT UNDERIPRIVILEGED, NOT HANDICAPPED,<br />
THOSE OF US WHO BY VIRTUE. OF WEALTH OR HEALTH OR GOOD<br />
FORTUNE CAN SERVE, SHOULD HAVE ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES<br />
TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY, SO WE ARE TRYING IN TRUTH<br />
BOTH TO ENHANCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DISA) VANTAGED AND<br />
IN A JIFFERENT BUT RELATED SENSE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
THE ADVANTAGED OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY,<br />
I SHOULD HOWEVER, ADD A WARNING. ALL THESE<br />
PROGRAMS I HAVE MENTIONED ARE NOVEL FOR AUSTRALIA AND<br />
EXPERIMENTAL IN AUSTRALIA, BECAUSE THEY ARE NEW,<br />
BECAUSE THEY ARE TENTATIVE, THEY LACK THE POLITICAL<br />
CLOUT THAT COMES FROM YEARS AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND<br />
EXPERTISE BECAUSE THEY SEEK OUT NEW AND NEGLECTED<br />
AREAS OF NEED, THEY MAY BE REGARDED AS POLITICALLY<br />
PERIPHERAL. THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE TIME TO BECOME<br />
SACRED COWS. BECAUSE THEY ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE THE<br />
NEEDS OF THE WEAKEST, OF THE LEAST ARTICULATE MEMBERS<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY, THEY MAY BE REGARDED AS POLITICALLY<br />
DISPENSABLE. </p>

7 NATIOHNAL WELFARF PROGRAMS, SiE FJ: THEM INITIATEDI) BY<br />
THE PREVIOUS,. GOVCRNMENT, COULD BE I'iPERILLED. FOR<br />
EXAMPLE, PROGRAMS FOR AGED AND HOMELESS AND HANDICAPPED<br />
AND ABORIGINAL PEOPLE, ISOLATED CHILDREN, HEALTH CENTRES,<br />
LEGAL AID OFFICES, NURSING HOMES AND HOME NURSING,<br />
MEALS ON WHEELS, FLYING DOCTORS AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION.<br />
THE COMMON DISTINGUISHING FACTOR IN ALL THESE PROGRAMS<br />
IS THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO MEET SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE<br />
WEAK AND INARTICULATE SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY THE<br />
OLD THE SICK, MIGRANTS, ABORIGINES, THE VERY YOUNG. IF<br />
THESE GROUPS WERE POLITICALLY POWERFUL, IF THEY COULD<br />
MOUNT EFFECTIVE POLITICAL PRESSURE, THE GOVERNMENTS<br />
WHICH DARED TO PLACE THESE PROGRAM IN JEOPARD'Y WOULD<br />
BE DESTROYED. BUT AS IT IS, THE THING PASSES OFF WITH<br />
SCARCE A MURMUR, </p>
<p>AGAIN, BECiU 3E THESE PROGiRAMS THE ONES I<br />
HAVE NiENTIONED TODAY AS ', W'ELL AS THE ONES THREATENED<br />
BY THE HIGH COURr CHALLEINGE CAN HELP ONLY THE WEAK,<br />
TiiL UNDLI P/ I VI LEGTL THItL INARTI CUL. ATC, THEY WOULD BE<br />
THE FIRST TO GO, TiIl FIR. ST TO BE K'NOCKED OFF IN ANY<br />
FULL SCALE ONSLAUGHT AGAINST PUBLIC SPENDING AND PUBLIC<br />
INIIATIVE. lllE TRAGLDY IS THAT WHATEVER VALUE THESE<br />
PROGRAMS MIGHT HAVE FOR THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF<br />
OUR FELLOW CITIZENS, WHATEVER THE COST IN HUMAN HAPPINESS<br />
AND HUMAN HOPE THEIR ABOLITION MIGHT MEAN, IT WOULD BE<br />
QUITE FEASIBLE POLITICALLY TO DUMP THEM ALL AT ALMOST<br />
NO POLITICAL COST.<br />
THE ONLY PROTECTION IS THE CONSCIENCE AND<br />
THE CONCERN OF THE INTERESTED AND ARTICULATE GROUPS IN<br />
THE COMMUNITY, OF WHICH I FIRMLY BELIEVE APEX IS IN THE<br />
FRONT RANK. IT IS BECAUSE APEX HAS BEEN INVOLVED AND<br />
. WILL BE FURTHER INVOLVED IN THESE SORTS OF COMMUNITY<br />
PROJECTS, IT IS BECAUSE APEXIANS KNOW THEIR VALUE, KNOW<br />
WHAT THEY MEAN TO THOUSANDS OF OUR FELLOW-CITIZENS, THAT<br />
I BELIEVE I CAN COUNT UPON APEX TO PROTECT THEM AS WELL<br />
AS TO PROMOTE THEM. A VOICE MUST BE RAISED ON BEHALF<br />
OF THE VOICELESS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I LOOK TO APEX<br />
TO GIVE IT. s / 17 </p>
