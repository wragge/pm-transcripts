    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to join you this evening as we recognise and promote scientific excellence:</p>
<p>     * excellence in scientific research, and</p>
<p>     * excellence in teaching science and inspiring the next generation of Australian scientists.</p>
<p>Science and innovation underpin the continued improvements in living standards that we in the modern world take for granted.</p>
<p>Scientific discovery and application is the reason why we now live longer and healthier lives, why we can communicate globally at almost zero cost and retrieve information from any part of the world through the internet.</p>
<p>Our lives continue to be transformed by the new frontiers in science.</p>
<p>As our world continues to change rapidly, and the global economy is transformed by the rise of China and India, science is going to become more critically important to our future.</p>
<p>As an economy, Australia can't compete against the large emerging economies on price alone.</p>
<p>We will never have the scale or the low labour costs that will make us cheaper than those nations.</p>
<p>But we can compete through education, innovation and excellence.</p>
<p>That is why science plays such an important role in the Government's vision for Australia's future  -  for a stronger economy, and for competing successfully in the global economy of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Science is also critical to tackling the challenges of the future:</p>
<p>     * putting Australia in front in clean green energy and other climate change technologies;</p>
<p>     * creating the fulfilling, high skill jobs of the future;</p>
<p>     * achieving breakthroughs in medical research that can help the management and cure of chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer and dementia;</p>
<p>     * ensuring a strong future for our rural industries and communities, as they face water shortages yet growing world food demand.</p>
<p>Australia needs a strong base of science teaching and scientific research  -  in our schools, universities, government agencies, and our research organisations.</p>
<p>That means in particular that more must be done to retain our best and brightest scientists and researchers within Australia  -  or giving them good reasons to come home.</p>
<p>Australia has a strong record of scientific achievement.</p>
<p>But we can still do better.</p>
<p>Consider the facts:</p>
<p>     * A decade ago Australia was ranked 16th out of 28 countries for the strength of our research collaboration between industry and universities. The most recent evaluation in 2004 saw Australia's position collapse to being the bottom of the table.</p>
<p>     * Australia has only 8 PhDs per thousand people in the workforce, compared to 11 per thousand in the United States, 20 per thousand in Germany, and 28 per thousand in Switzerland.</p>
<p>I believe we can turn this around.</p>
<p>Not overnight.</p>
<p>Not in one Budget.</p>
<p>Not even in the life of one Parliament.</p>
<p>But with a long term vision for science policy, we can capture the creativity and ingenuity of our people and build a more prosperous future for the country.</p>
<p>Even now, we produce 3 per cent of the world's research papers with just 0.3 per cent of the world's population.</p>
<p>In a world where most scientific discovery and application will occur offshore, it makes sense that a major part of our science strategy is to build stronger ties to the international science community.</p>
<p>That has been a priority for the Government in our first year in office.</p>
<p>Australia has established the Australia-China Joint Coordination Group on Clean Coal Technology.</p>
<p>Australia has become the first associate member of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, a multinational facility dedicated to basic research.</p>
<p>And in August, the New Zealand government agreed to support and campaign for Australia's bid to host the $2 billion square-kilometre array radio telescope.</p>
<p>This iconic project won't just revolutionise our understanding of the universe  -  it would also have a transforming impact on scientific endeavour here in Australia.</p>
<p>Winning this project, which is being jointly developed by researchers in 19 nations, would have an enormously beneficial impact on Australian science.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has committed over $100 million to this initiative.</p>
<p>If Australia is successful, we stand to benefit from a potential multi-billion dollar investment.</p>
<p>This Government believes science has an important role to play in informing the policy making process.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in evidence-based policy.</p>
<p>That includes greater use of scientific evidence in the process of making and evaluating policy.</p>
<p>The Chief Scientist has an important role in providing a scientific input into the policy process, and that is one reason why the Government has upgraded the position of Australia's Chief Scientist to a full-time role.</p>
<p>I am delighted that Professor Penny Sackett, an outstanding astronomer, will shortly commenceher five year appointment to this role as the leader of the nation's scientific community.</p>
<p>Professor Sackett is a strong advocate for the scientific community and she will play a key role in promoting science across the country  -  from classrooms to boardrooms, and across the entire nation.</p>
<p>Professor Sackett's valued advice is complemented by the other members of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, which meets twice per year.</p>
<p>The Council gives me the opportunity to hear from scientists directly, on matters as diverse as the regional impacts of climate change, water supplies in our cities, Indigenous healthcare, and new technologies.</p>
<p>When we met last week, we focused on the future of the National Innovation System.</p>
<p>The Review of the National Innovation System, conducted by Professor Terry Cutler, provides policy recommendations for the Government across science, research and innovation.</p>
<p>The Government is reviewing those recommendations and will be responding to the report with a White Paper on innovation policy in the near future.</p>
<p>The Government has already moved to address the urgent priorities facing the science sector.</p>
<p>The first is in teaching.</p>
<p>Australia needs more people studying maths and science.</p>
<p>We need more of those graduates to go back into our school classrooms and teach the next generation of scientists.</p>
<p>That is why our Government is investing $626 million in financial incentives to do just that.</p>
<p>From 1 January next year, new maths and science students will see their HECS fees slashed from over $7,400 to less than $4,200.</p>
<p>The message that sends to students is simple: “We want you to study maths and science, and we'll back you for making that choice.”</p>
<p>We're also cutting HECS for maths and science graduates who go into related occupations like teaching these subjects in secondary school or becoming primary school teachers.</p>
<p>Because teaching the next generation is a wonderful use of scientific talent.</p>
<p>The Government is also committed to strengthening scientific research.</p>
<p>     * We are investing $209 million to double the number of postgraduate scholarships to higher degree research students.</p>
<p>     * We are investing $326 million to create 1,000 mid-career Future Fellowships.</p>
<p>     * And we are investing $239 million for our new Laureate Fellowships program.</p>
<p>Together, these three initiatives provide a boost across the research spectrum  -  higher degree, mid-career and peak of career researchers.</p>
<p>Tonight is an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of those who have dedicated their lives to scientific endeavour.</p>
<p>The achievements of each of tonight's winners are truly world-class.</p>
<p>There are fewer greater contributions a person can make to our society than dedicating themselves to breakthroughs in human knowledge and to passing scientific understanding on to the next generation.</p>
<p>So tonight, I join you in applauding these achievers for their dedication and excellence.</p>
<p>And I look forward to our nation producing many more such examples of excellence in coming years. </p>
