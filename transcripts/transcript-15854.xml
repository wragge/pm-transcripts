    <content><![CDATA[<p>I begin by congratulating Peking University which this year celebrates its 110th anniversary  -  making this university three years older than the Commonwealth of Australia.</p>
<p>Peking University is the most famous in China.</p>
<p>And it has played an important part in modern Chinese history.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, when China was going through a period of rapid transformation, it was Peking University that led movements for a new era in Chinese educational, cultural and political life.</p>
<p>Peking University was at the centre of the May 4th Movement.</p>
<p>The May 4th era  -  for I realise that it was a transformative decade from 1917 to 1927  -  was one of crucial and lasting importance in the emergence of a modern China.</p>
<p>Many famous figures in this period were active at your university.</p>
<p>One thinks, for example, of Cai Yuanpei, Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, Li Dazhao and Lu Xun.</p>
<p>This year, 2008, is the 90th anniversary of some key events of the May Fourth era:</p>
<p> -  through his essays for the major magazine New Youth the writer and educator Hu Shi successfully advocated the use of modern vernacular Chinese in education and the media.</p>
<p>This helped bring about a major change in the way that the young people of China expressed themselves to their compatriots.</p>
<p>Also the writer Lu Xun published the first, and justifiably famous, story in modern Chinese, Diary of a Madman.</p>
<p>I would also note that Lu Xun's design for the school crest of Peking University is still in use.</p>
<p>Indeed, you, the students of Peking University today, are heirs to a great tradition of intellectual engagement with your country.</p>
<p>Studying China</p>
<p>This is not the first time I have visited Peking University.</p>
<p>But it is the first time I have given a speech here.</p>
<p>It is a great honour for me.</p>
<p>And it is a great honour for me to address the students of this university because you are an important part of China's future.</p>
<p>I first started studying China and the Chinese language in 1976.</p>
<p>It was a different China back then.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai had just died.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong was still alive.</p>
<p>And the Cultural Revolution had not concluded  -  indeed our Chinese language textbooks were still full of class struggle.</p>
<p>Some have asked me why I decided to study Chinese.</p>
<p>I had grown up on a farm in rural Queensland where China seemed very remote.</p>
<p>I remember as a teenager following closely the visit of Australia's Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to China on television in 1973 after the Australia Labor Government recognised China in 1972.</p>
<p>I remember watching the footage of him meeting Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping escorting his party on a tour to the Great Wall.</p>
<p>That visit inspired my interest in this extraordinary country.</p>
<p>When I went to university I knew that I wanted to study China.</p>
<p>I went to the Australian National University in Canberra.</p>
<p>And for the next four years I studied Chinese language, Chinese history and Chinese literature together with Japanese and Korean history as well.</p>
<p>I even studied Chinese calligraphy, but my calligraphy was ugly then  -  and it is even uglier now.</p>
<p>Later I became a diplomat.</p>
<p>Because I was a graduate in Chinese, the then Australian Government decided to send me to Sweden  -  where in those days I could barely find a decent Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>I eventually made it to China in 1984 when I started work at the Australian Embassy.</p>
<p>But I did not remain a diplomat.</p>
<p>I wanted to enter politics.</p>
<p>I was elected to Australia's Parliament in 1998 and after serving in parliament for nine years in opposition, my party won the general election last year and I had the honour of becoming 26th Prime Minister of Australia.</p>
<p>Australia and China</p>
<p>Some people think that Australia and China are new friends.</p>
<p>But in fact our history is already long.</p>
<p>Chinese settlers came to Australia first in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>When gold was discovered in Victoria and Queensland in the 1850s, the first major group of Chinese migrants came to our shores.</p>
<p>We now have over 600,000 people who claim Chinese ancestry.</p>
<p>After English, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) is the most widely spoken language in Australia.</p>
<p>The Chinese community has deep roots in Australia and is an important part of modern Australian society.</p>
<p>It includes people like Dr John Yu, one of Australia's leading surgeons and Australian of the Year in 1996.</p>
<p>And the young mathematician, Terrence Tao, who I met recently.</p>
<p>The flow of people has not all been in one direction.</p>
<p>Some Australians  -  though a smaller number  -  have made China their home.</p>
<p>George Morrison is one such person.</p>
<p>Morrison first came to China in 1894.</p>
<p>He lived here for 20 years.</p>
<p>In Australia, he was known as “Chinese Morrison”.</p>
<p>And here in Beijing, during the Republic of China, Wangfujing, home to George Morrison, was known as “Morrison Street”.</p>
<p>It is easy to see why people become fascinated with China.</p>
<p>China has thousands of years of continuous recorded history, but it is a country of constant change.</p>
<p>When I look at the China of 2008, I see a very different country to the one I studied in the late 1970s and the one I lived in during the mid 1980s.</p>
<p>China and the World</p>
<p>The changes in China since the 1970s have been remarkable.</p>
<p>And the change in China has led to a profound evolution in the relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>China's policy change 30 years ago this year to “reform and open up” was the start of your country's re-connection with the world.</p>
<p>China's companies began trading with others.</p>
<p>China's people began to travel.</p>
<p>China's students began going overseas to study in greater numbers.</p>
<p>The world began to see China, and the people of China began to see the world, in new ways.</p>
<p>This institution, Peking University, through its teaching, research and search for knowledge has also had a profound influence on China's changes.</p>
<p>Its graduates have made a big contribution to your country's engagement with the world.</p>
<p>To many people in China, these changes bring a better and richer life.</p>
<p>People are able to make decisions about where they work, how they live and set their own goals.</p>
<p>They can build their own businesses.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are still many problems in China  -  problems of poverty, problems of uneven development, problems of pollution, problems of broader human rights.</p>
<p>It is also important to recognise that China's change is having a great impact not just on China, but also on the world.</p>
<p>The scale and pace of China's economic development and social transformation is unprecedented in human history.</p>
<p>Never before have so many people been brought into the global economy in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Just look at some of the figures.</p>
<p>China is now the world's third-largest trading nation.</p>
<p>Its exports are growing at over 30 per cent per year.</p>
<p>GDP per capita has nearly doubled in the past five years.</p>
<p>People in Australia and around the world recognise that China's economic development is having a profound global impact.</p>
<p>They understand that China's demand for resources is driving global growth.</p>
<p>But China's growth can also cause anxiety.</p>
<p>Some people are concerned about their jobs moving to China.</p>
<p>When people overseas are faced with big changes and uncertainties like these they get nervous.</p>
<p>We all need to appreciate these anxieties and their origins.</p>
<p>Today I would like to make a suggestion.</p>
<p>I think that you  -  the young people of China, the generation that will see China's full integration into global society, the global economy and the overall global order  -  have an important role to play in the life of the world.</p>
<p>The global community looks forward to China fully participating in all the institutions of the global rules-based order, including in security, in the economy, in human rights, in the environment.</p>
<p>And we look forward to China making active contributions to the enhancement of that order in the future.</p>
<p>It is a necessary task of responsible global citizenship.</p>
<p>It is a big responsibility you have.</p>
<p>You are the product of China today.</p>
<p>And you are the representatives of China's tomorrow.</p>
<p>You will be the ones who define how the world sees China.</p>
<p>“Harmony” was the dream and hope of that great Chinese thinker and activist Kang Youwei.</p>
<p>The Hundred Days reform movement, like Peking University, also marks its 110th anniversary this year.</p>
<p>Kang proposed a utopian world free of political boundaries.</p>
<p>China has variously articulated its approach to development as one of “peaceful rise”, “peaceful development” or more recently that of a “harmonious world”.</p>
<p>In 2005 the then US Deputy Secretary of State Bob Zoellick spoke for his part of his concept that China would and could become a responsible global stakeholder.</p>
<p>As I said last week in a speech to the Brookings Institution in Washington, it is worthwhile thinking about how to encourage a synthesis of these concepts of a “harmonious world” and the “responsible stakeholder”.</p>
<p>The idea of a “harmonious world” depends on China being a participant in the world order and, along with others, acting in accordance with the rules of that order.</p>
<p>Failing this, “harmony” is impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>“Responsible stakeholder” contains the same idea at its core  -  China working to maintain and develop the global and regional rules-based order.</p>
<p>This year, as China hosts the Olympics, the eyes of the world will be on you and the city of Beijing.</p>
<p>It will be a chance for China to engage directly with the world, both on the sports field and on the streets of Beijing.</p>
<p>Some have called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics because of recent problems in Tibet.</p>
<p>As I said in London on Sunday, I do not agree.</p>
<p>I believe the Olympics are important for China's continuing engagement with the world.</p>
<p>Australia like most other countries recognises China's sovereignty over Tibet.</p>
<p>But we also believe it is necessary to recognise there are significant human rights problem in Tibet.</p>
<p>The current situation in Tibet is of concern to Australians.</p>
<p>We recognise the need for all parties to avoid violence and find a solution through dialogue.</p>
<p>As a long-standing friend of China I intend to have a straightforward discussion with China's leaders on this.</p>
<p>We wish to see the year 2008 as one of harmony, and celebration  -  not one of conflict and contention.</p>
<p>Harmony in the Natural Environment</p>
<p>Our shared future is not only one about harmony between nations and peoples.</p>
<p>It is also about harmony with nature  -  the “Unity of Man and Nature”  -  a concept with ancient roots in Chinese thought.</p>
<p>We all share responsibility for the future.</p>
<p>One of the big future challenges for Australia and China is climate change.</p>
<p>Australia is committed to strong action domestically and internationally on climate change.</p>
<p>Because we know that climate change is the great moral, economic and environmental challenge of our time  -  one that all nations have to work together to overcome.</p>
<p>That's why climate change will be an important part of my discussions with the Chinese leadership this week.</p>
<p>It is important that China play an increasingly prominent role on climate change.</p>
<p>An effective global response to climate change will require the active participation of all major emitters.</p>
<p>I also believe it is important for China's own future.</p>
<p>Unless we are successful, China will face increasing pressure on its water supplies, changing rainfall patterns and rising sea levels.</p>
<p>A strong relationship, and a true friendship, are built on the ability to engage in direct, frank and ongoing dialogue about our fundamental interests and future vision.</p>
<p>In the modern, globalised world, we are all connected; connected not only by politics and economics, but also in the air we breathe.</p>
<p>A true friend is one who can be a “zhengyou”, that is a partner who sees beyond immediate benefit to the broader and firm basis for continuing, profound and sincere friendship.</p>
<p>In other words, a true friendship which “offers unflinching advice and counsels restraint” to engage in principled dialogue about matters of contention.</p>
<p>It is the kind of friendship that I know is treasured in China's political tradition.</p>
<p>It is the kind of friendship that I also offer China today.</p>
