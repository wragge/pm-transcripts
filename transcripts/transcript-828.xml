    <content><![CDATA[<p>Once again wo are being asked by theÂ Australian Council of ChurchesÂ to give our financialÂ support to the Christmas BowlÂ of Remembrance</p>
<p>I commendÂ the Appeal which every yearÂ forÂ the past fifteen years has brought help to the needyÂ in a wide variety of ways and in many Â parts of the world.</p>
<p>The hungry, the homeless, the sick haveÂ benefited from a warm charity which ignores nationalÂ boundaries and notes neither colour nor creed.</p>
<p>I feel sure that Australians will respondÂ with their traditional generosity so that this inter-Â Church project may againÂ meet with adequate financesÂ the responsibilities it has undertaken.</p>
<p>14th October, 1963.</p>
