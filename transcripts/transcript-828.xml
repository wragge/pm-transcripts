    <content><![CDATA[<p>Once again wo are being asked by the Australian Council of Churches to give our financial support to the Christmas Bowl of Remembrance</p>
<p>I commend the Appeal which every year for the past fifteen years has brought help to the needy in a wide variety of ways and in many  parts of the world.</p>
<p>The hungry, the homeless, the sick have benefited from a warm charity which ignores national boundaries and notes neither colour nor creed.</p>
<p>I feel sure that Australians will respond with their traditional generosity so that this inter- Church project may again meet with adequate finances the responsibilities it has undertaken.</p>
<p>14th October, 1963.</p>
