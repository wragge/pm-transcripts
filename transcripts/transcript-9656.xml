FAULKNER FOREST POLICY<br />
The Government today agreed to a Commonwealth position on National Reserve<br />
Criteria designed to esiablish a world class forest conservation reserve system.<br />
These criteria fonii the basis for negotiation with the States on Deferred Forest<br />
Assessments ( DFAs), Regional Forest Agreements ( RFAs) and on nationally agreed<br />
criteria for establishing forest conservation reserves.<br />
The National Reserve Criteria is a central plank of the National Forest Policy<br />
Statement and the Commonwealth's commitment to identify and protect key forest<br />
areas in a comprehensive, adequate and representative ( CAR) reserve system.<br />
The Governmenr's decision took into account more than 50 submissions from<br />
stakeholders as well as an extended process of consultation with thle States, interest<br />
groups, scientists and the National Forest Policy Advisory Foruin.<br />
The criteria reaffirmed the position set out in a Commonwealth Discussion Paper<br />
which was released on 3 0 March 1995. In today's decisio the Government has<br />
amplified and clarified some details regarding the application of these criteria.<br />
The Commonwealth's National Reserve Criteria includes:-<br />
a broad benchmark of 15% of the pre-1750 distribution of each forest<br />
community to be protected within conservation reserves<br />
retention in reserves of at least 60% of existing old growth increasing up<br />
to 100% in some cases for rare old growth<br />
protection of 90% or more wherever practicable of high quality wilderness<br />
recognition of the role of " off-reserve management" to conservation<br />
objectives. </p>
<p>Y*<br />
The Chief Biodiversity Officer of the United Nations' primary nature conservation<br />
body International Union for the Conservation of Nature in his review of the criteria,<br />
stated that it is " an excellent set of criteria which reflects extremely vell the current<br />
art and science of reserve protected area sstem design. It draws on the best<br />
available scie ce in Australia and elsewhere and appropriately reflects current<br />
thinking at the internatlonal" level."<br />
Implementation of a CAP, reserve system, appropriate management of commercial<br />
forests, and the forthcoming wood and paper industries strategy will benefit industry<br />
and regional communities through increased certainty.<br />
The Commonwealth is also committed to ensuring that a high value-added wood<br />
products industry can operate on an ecologically sustainable basis outside these areas.<br />
This is being addressed through the Wood and Paper Industries Strategy to be released<br />
in August.<br />
These policy initiatives will ensure that Australia has both a vibrant forest-based<br />
industry as well as a world class forest conservation reserve<br />
It is recognised that the likely impact of the DFA and RFA processes may be the<br />
withdrawal of some native forest resources. The Government has endorsed a set of<br />
guidelines for consultations with affected businesses, workers and communities to<br />
facilitate the transition to a sustainable higher value-added industry based increasingly<br />
on plantation and regrowth resources.<br />
It will not be possible to estimate detailed structural adjustment requirements until at<br />
least the Deferred Forest Assessments have been completed.<br />
Coupe by coupe assessment of forest areas for the 1995 woodchip licence renewal<br />
process has been replaced this year by a regional approach to protect areas of forest<br />
which may be required for the reserve system, pending the completion of RFAs.<br />
