A<br />
CHECK AGAINST DEL1VIRY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />

LIBERAL, PARTY LUNCHE~ ON AT CHAUCR'<br />
-1 4m ( d-ighted to be here today to support Lindsay Thompson<br />
-ina isLiberal Government colleag ues. it is a matter of<br />
fhoeheartedly agree that to anyone:-who has had that experience,<br />
-txistotally inconceivable how anyone would eve Want to vote<br />
Lal~ oror think that Labor should be given a chance to show<br />
-th--iuportaceof this election in Victoria. n-''-ho1hks.<br />
doesn't really matter, or that there really int much of a<br />
daffeirence between the parties, simply doesn't understand what<br />
t all about. And I have got no doubt that as the actual<br />
iele-ctioni day gets closer, as the mnoment comes when people<br />
are. inaking the real choice about how their State is to be<br />
4overned -for the next three years, they will recognise the<br />
poDint that's so obvious to all of us here today, that it<br />
Sreally is absurd to think of going past Lindsay Thompson and<br />
-Y1a -Liberal Government for this State. I<br />
Lindsay has dedicated much of his life to serving the people<br />
VT of Victoria. He has contributed significantly to the<br />
achievements of the Liberal Government. He understands Victoria<br />
need s---of ictorians and his leadership qualities<br />
' of in~ tegrity, honesty and courage are widely recognised.<br />
VMh O can forget the courage of Lindsay Thompson when, at<br />
gtiat personel risk, he placed his life in danger to secuxre<br />
terelease of the Faraday school children and-t1; e-r---yo<br />
teacher from their kidnappers?<br />
Wen people look at the parties and the policies, the choice<br />
izs plain. Before pursuing the Victorian scene further,<br />
I want-to talk about the re _ ality of Labor in ofice a harsh,<br />
reality which Australians nationally and at a state level have<br />
had-to face Whenever and wherever Labor has had the chance<br />
to. sho what it can do, disaster has., been the resUlt;: </p>

' c'TeVictoriane lection on 3 April is very much about these<br />
iss, about Labor's disastrous failures in office. The election<br />
isalso about objectives and achievements, te J1b5raJ. 6b23e cti<br />
t;. bbu ld up Australia, and the solid, documented and uncontestable<br />
achi~ eveznent. of Liberal Government in Victoria.<br />
: ibeals believe that the way ahead for Aus~ tralia 4 bthrough<br />
2' 1" idivdal achievement. Australia grows -and prospers when<br />
gvernments enable people to set their own goals and to<br />
yve for the things they want. As Liberals we offer<br />
' Clear and ' contetMpokary directions that are proven and accepted<br />
th~ e vast majority of Australians. Oxir grea political<br />
Sobligation is to enunciate those directions clearly and<br />
~ 7-Ccof~ n. Our % so'cialist opponents must not be allow. ed to<br />
conceal the irrelevance, personal interference anid constraints<br />
ndvda initiative whi6h are the featares f~ p4<br />
Ssocialism.<br />
-Lib~ erals seek to govern not in t1te interest of special jrivileged<br />
roups but of ' all Australians. Liberals seek to underpin<br />
adilevemernt with the-~ maintenance of a strong economy ased on<br />
pxivate enterprise in which people can choose, as consumers,<br />
aB-buisinessmen,.. as investors large and small, as developers<br />
-of our human, technological and natural resources. Liberals<br />
believe in encouraging excellence across the rancofh-<br />
16e believe in a strong, secure nation, a society which is<br />
cocre~ or the family and cares for the needy and undexr-<br />
2piivileged. We believe in tle-istrength of a diverse, multi-cultural<br />
society of people commitLted to Australia. We believe in<br />
. corscrerving Australia's rich heritage for future generations,<br />
-j: moderate and evolutionary constitutional reform.<br />
ese are the enduring philosophies which lie behind all<br />
LIberal Governments in Australia, They have underpinned<br />
-" the. 4ofsistently successful Liberal Government in Victoria<br />
whf-re-the choice on 3 April is between individual enterprise<br />
aznd Stultifying socialist -control. The record of Liberal<br />
Government is outstanding. Living standards in Austalia and<br />
in Victoria have doubled over the last three decades. Victorians<br />
a have the highest average household income of any state.<br />
They have the highest level ' of home ownershi4 fai~ e<br />
whidh-mfeans. Victoria just about leads the world in home<br />
V17c1tozria has been for many yeara, and remains a fine example<br />
-of.. haqto-develop human and natural resources to -the full.<br />
Coal and oil resources are being utilised effectively. One<br />
Sthird of Australia's manufacturing employment is in Victoria.<br />
A quarter of the. total value of Australia's agriculitural<br />
output is produced here. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
indsay Thompson has shown that he and his team plan to build<br />
. further upon their successful years inGoverrnent. His<br />
! oicy-package aims towards continued economic growth. It<br />
. takes account of people's aspirations and their needs, with<br />
initiatives in such areas as education, transport, health<br />
d* social welfare.<br />
he Cornuonwealth and Victorian governments complement each<br />
other-in their policies and actions. In housing the Commonwealth's<br />
pakageis designed to assist young people to buy their fir~ tf<br />
homeis, and, oncet' they have done so, to help them, in the<br />
ea* lyYow4, to cope with repayments on what is a central feature<br />
la o ' ost Australians' aspirations their own home.<br />
Our dphoces to industrial relations are also complemenitar.-<br />
Weboth' seek to. encourage negotiation and conciliation in the<br />
resolution of disputes. Lindsay Thompson has been at the forefront<br />
:~ K'in. recdent. attempts to achieve joint Commonweal th-state efforts<br />
find solutcom to waterfront and demarcation prblm At<br />
thesame time,* we appreciate the need for firmness to deal<br />
~*. jfr~ siuaiosand circumstances which affect pol hog<br />
S tienmus tral dsrupionand longer term damage to the<br />
he6 ViCICtotian Government legislated to protect the public j<br />
inte'res t. ecaiise those firm and responsible measures were<br />
available in law, the Newport Power Station was built and<br />
Victoria has been spared an electricity disaster JenAV.<br />
iev-Scuth Wales has been experiencing. Because of those<br />
~ laws'-Lindsay Thompson also got work on Loy Yang going again.<br />
Be cause of those laws, he had milk moving agai-n when there<br />
* Was ac rippling transport and waterfront dispute.<br />
' r:. ai ha'ozntted Labor to abolishing those laws. He would<br />
litt protective shield which Lindsay Thompsons Government<br />
r~ sput in place. Mr Cain has not been playing s t aiht.<br />
le ha-s scattered promises over months and months,<br />
ga-thered together and considered carefully, they represent<br />
huge-potential burden for Victorians in both cost and<br />
Minse~ uences. Lindsay Thompson has calculated that the ALP<br />
, proiiisesI would cost an eytra ,0000 million in additional<br />
GverMent expenditure over three years, or a minimum Of<br />
~ iI~~ y 21.009 a week extra for Victorian families.<br />
tl~ Cain would turn back the clock by re-imposing Probate<br />
U : and Labor policy is committed to abolishing per cap-ta<br />
' to noni-Government schools, and giving the Government<br />
' 4 the power to oblige these schools to accept new Governument<br />
-req ~ rements as a condition of receiving any State aid.<br />
And, of course, his promises to repeal the vital industrial<br />
rei~ atdons legislation would lay open Victoria to the kind of<br />
disruption which the wran Governmnt invited ad hsepience<br />
InNew-South Wales. </p>
