<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, are you concerned about the volatility of the dollar?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't talk ever about the level of the dollar. There</p>
<p>   is a challenging international economic environment. That's</p>
<p>   another reason why the Government should be returned whenever the</p>
<p>   election is held because if there's one thing unarguably we</p>
<p>   have, along with a lot of other things, over the Labor Party is</p>
<p>   our management of the economy; how we've turned a deficit of</p>
<p>   $10.5 billion into a surplus in two and a bit years, how we've</p>
<p>   got the lowest interest rates in 30 years. And the volatility of</p>
<p>   the world is a reason why you have to press ahead with the reforms</p>
<p>   that the Government is pursuing, not a reason why you would go slow</p>
<p>   on them.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>You're at least as privy as anybody else to the predictions</p>
<p>   in the market place. You're hearing tonight that the dollar</p>
<p>   could fall to 50 cents or even below 50 cents. Are you saying that</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister, no matter what happens with the dollar, you would</p>
<p>   be constrained even to publicly defend its intrinsic value?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I'm saying, Kerry, is that as Prime Minister I don't</p>
<p>   have the luxury that money market dealers have of talking about</p>
<p>   levels, and I don't intend to do that, I talk about the strength</p>
<p>   of the economy. And I take that position out of a concern for our</p>
<p>   country's future. </p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Okay, you might feel constrained in talking about the dollar but</p>
<p>   nobody else is going to be constrained, particularly if it keeps</p>
<p>   falling and particularly in the heat of an election climate. That</p>
<p>   must represent a potential political nightmare for you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, a country only has one Prime Minister and I have special</p>
<p>   responsibilities.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>And you might not even want to talk about interest rates but there's</p>
<p>   going to be plenty of talk about interest rates and speculation</p>
<p>   about interest rates going up as well if the dollar continues to</p>
<p>   fall.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can talk about the fact that we now have the lowest interest</p>
<p>   rates in 30 years and that the average homebuyer in Australia is</p>
<p>   $300 a month better off as a result of the falls in interest rates</p>
<p>   that have occurred. And one of the reasons for that, one of them,</p>
<p>   is that we've got the budget back into balance and into surplus.</p>
<p>   There are other reasons, but that is one of the very firm reasons</p>
<p>   for a future level of interest rates. What I can say is something</p>
<p>   I've probably said on this programme before, and that is that</p>
<p>   I can guarantee that we'll pursue policies that exert downward</p>
<p>   pressure on interest rates. I can't certify to a particular</p>
<p>   level but I point to our record. In just over two years we have</p>
<p>   presided over the largest falls in interest rates for homebuyers</p>
<p>   and small business that this country has seen for 30 years, and</p>
<p>   that is a very, very, very praiseworthy achievement.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>You know how ruthless the money market is, particularly in such</p>
<p>   a volatile global environment - we're seeing Russia in deep</p>
<p>   trouble now, we're seeing that impacting back on markets all</p>
<p>   over the place. Are you concerned about the constraints on what</p>
<p>   the Reserve Bank can do to protect the dollar during an election</p>
<p>   campaign if convention prevents it putting interest rates up as</p>
<p>   the last line of defence of the dollar?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, I think the Reserve Bank has conducted itself in the national</p>
<p>   interest in the time that I've been in government. I'm</p>
<p>   not suggesting that it didn't before either. But I am confident</p>
<p>   that the Reserve Bank will do the right thing by Australia. It's</p>
<p>   required by the Banking Act to do that and I'm quite sure that</p>
<p>   we will see that occurring. I remain very optimistic about the future</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy. And the very fact that there are challenges</p>
<p>   overseas are all the more reason why we have to press ahead with</p>
<p>   things like taxation reform, because the world environment cries</p>
<p>   aloud for a more competitive, a more forward-looking Australia,</p>
<p>   it doesn't cry aloud for an Australia that turns its back on</p>
<p>   reform and change.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>So, you're saying that the Reserve Bank should feel free to</p>
<p>   do whatever it has to to protect the Australian dollar in the national</p>
<p>   interest whether there's an election campaign...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, what I'm saying, and I'll repeat, is that I am</p>
<p>   certain that the Reserve Bank will do the right thing by Australia.</p>
<p>   I'm not saying anything more or less than that.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Well, can I ask you to clarify whether you believe there should</p>
<p>   be a convention during an election campaign that the Reserve Bank,</p>
<p>   the central bank, does not do anything to interest rates during</p>
<p>   a campaign?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, what I'm prepared to say to you is what I've said</p>
<p>   before and that is that I'm certain that the Reserve Bank will</p>
<p>   do the right thing by Australia.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Economists are starting to paint world growth next year at somewhere</p>
<p>   between zero and two per cent. And a leading Australian economic</p>
<p>   forecaster, ACCESS Economics, says Australian activity may be cut,</p>
<p>   quote: Âto a crawl' by the first half of next year. Does</p>
<p>   that concern you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if it were accurate I would rather it were otherwise. If</p>
<p>   the Government receives advice from the Treasury, from its advisers</p>
<p>   about downward revisions and it's appropriate that that be</p>
<p>   made known, then it will be made known. And I point out to you that</p>
<p>   whenever an election is called there is now a proviso, under our</p>
<p>   Charter of Budget Honesty, for the Secretary of the Treasury to</p>
<p>   publish really a statement of the books so that everybody knows</p>
<p>   where we stand before the election so we won't have a re-run</p>
<p>   of last time.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>So you acknowledge that it is at least a possibility that ACCESS</p>
<p>   might be right and that the Australian economy might slow to crawl</p>
<p>   by early next year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I didn't say that. I haven't acknowledged anything</p>
<p>   of the kind. Of course I acknowledge that from time to time there</p>
<p>   can be variations in growth forecast. The evidence coming to me</p>
<p>   at the moment is definitely not that the Australian economy is likely</p>
<p>   to slow to a crawl. All the anecdotal and other evidence available</p>
<p>   suggests that the Australian economy is still robust. Obviously</p>
<p>   we are affected by the Asian downturn but we have resisted it with</p>
<p>   great resilience and a quite remarkable display for resilience to</p>
<p>   date.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>I'm quoting ACCESS because I imagine you would agree with</p>
<p>   me in terms of independent forecasters. They've got a pretty</p>
<p>   good reputation, in fact, the Liberal Party has seen fit to use</p>
<p>   them in the past. And ACCESS says, quote: Âon balance, Australia</p>
<p>   faces its worst international environment in decades,' and</p>
<p>   many other reputable economists agree, in terms, that we could see</p>
<p>   our economy slow quite markedly next year. What if they're</p>
<p>   right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, I agree that the international environment's tough.</p>
<p>   I do agree with that. That's all the more reason why you should</p>
<p>   be, in Australia, following the policies the Government's following.</p>
<p>   It's all the more reason to be in surplus and not in deficit.</p>
<p>   It's all the more reason to have low interest rates. It's</p>
<p>   all the more reason to face the reality that we need to renovate</p>
<p>   and fundamentally change our taxation system. The taxation system</p>
<p>   acts upon the nation's competitiveness and economic performance.</p>
<p>   And one thing that's been blindingly obvious to every significant</p>
<p>   figure on either side of politics in Australia over the last 20</p>
<p>   years, be it Hawke or Keating or Hewson or Howard or Evans or Beazley</p>
<p>   or anybody you want to name, and that is that our taxation system</p>
<p>   is out of date. It was built in the 1930s when most of our economy</p>
<p>   was manufacturing. And unless we fix the indirect tax system we're</p>
<p>   going to have no resources in the future to fund the sort of welfare</p>
<p>   provision that this country needs. And the international pressure</p>
<p>   makes that all the more necessary rather than less necessary. The</p>
<p>   people who are running around saying because of Asia we should stop</p>
<p>   reforming couldn't be more wrong. It's because of Asia</p>
<p>   that we must continue the process of reform because unless we do</p>
<p>   we will face a far more difficult future.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But if these economists that I'm quoting are right Â</p>
<p>   and we don't know how long the Asian crisis is going to last</p>
<p>   or how far reaching it's going to be Â if they're</p>
<p>   right, won't that cut the surplus that you're counting</p>
<p>   on, at least in part, to deliver your tax cuts in return for a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are confident that the provisions that we've made in the</p>
<p>   tax plan are responsible within our understanding of what the surplus</p>
<p>   is likely to be. It is our view that there will still, on the information</p>
<p>   available to us, be very strong surpluses in the years ahead.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Now, that's on information available to you now in a very</p>
<p>   volatile, global climate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but that's not said glibly...</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>No, but it's volatile, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...and it's also allowing for a margin of further deterioration,</p>
<p>   if I can put it that way. Not that I'm suggesting that there</p>
<p>   will be a further deterioration. I'm simply wanting to make</p>
<p>   the point that we have made very conservative assumptions. The Treasury</p>
<p>   has made the figuring and done the assumptions and they are quite</p>
<p>   conservative and we are confident of surpluses in the years ahead.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But if growth does slow and the surplus is affected, but I'm</p>
<p>   not saying wiped out, but is significantly affected, is there any</p>
<p>   circumstance in which you would be forced to reconsider any of your</p>
<p>   tax cuts or other compensation measures?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, they stand solid, rock solid. I don't believe that</p>
<p>   that circumstance will arise, so the question is purely and entirely</p>
<p>   hypothetical.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Well, we've all got to try and plan our future on the basis</p>
<p>   of that hypothetical question.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can only answer directly to your question. I can only describe</p>
<p>   the circumstance as it is. I can repeat to you that on all of the</p>
<p>   information available to the Government the plan has been very conservatively</p>
<p>   cast. We are the only show in town that's got the guts to tackle</p>
<p>   the need for tax reform. We're not just offering a tax bribe.</p>
<p>   The easy, lazy, conventional thing to do Â offer people a few</p>
<p>   dollars of a tax cut and ignore the need for fundamental reform.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Can you say, for hell or high water, come hell or high water, you'll</p>
<p>   never ever back away from your tax cuts or your compensation package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, I can only repeat to you that it is a solid commitment based</p>
<p>   on all the information available to us, conservatively cast, and</p>
<p>   I believe and the Government believes, utterly deliverable. And</p>
<p>   what makes it deliverable is that we're actually tackling the</p>
<p>   hard bit. We're tackling reform of the indirect tax system.</p>
<p>   The easy thing for me to have done before this election, whenever</p>
<p>   it may be, would have been to say to the Australian people: here's</p>
<p>   a tax handout, here's a personal tax cut, we don't need</p>
<p>   reform, it's too hard to do it because of Asia. Now, that's</p>
<p>   what people have done for the last 20 years with the exception of</p>
<p>   John Hewson in 1993. And I think we're paying, I mean, we have</p>
<p>   paid for it in the past and we will pay for it again. I mean, I'm</p>
<p>   putting a lot on the line on this issue because it's not the</p>
<p>   conventional thing to do. People would say the conventional thing</p>
<p>   is just to offer the goodies without the hard bits and we're</p>
<p>   doing both.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>I imagine you'd acknowledge that people are also putting a</p>
<p>   lot on the line in deciding to support you and take you at your</p>
<p>   word and I was intrigued and interested when you said only last</p>
<p>   weekend that quote: "nobody's got total control over future</p>
<p>   circumstances. You give answers to the best of your belief at the</p>
<p>   time and if circumstances change sometimes you have no alternative</p>
<p>   but to change."</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a generic statement of commonsense. What's</p>
<p>   wrong with that?</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Well it sounds a very honest statement but it does leave the gate</p>
<p>   open.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is an honest statement and it is equally honest of me to</p>
<p>   say that on all of the information available to us, conservatively</p>
<p>   calculated, and a set of assumptions made on our tax policy on an</p>
<p>   equally conservative basis, everything we put down is utterly deliverable.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>That's a very different proposition to what you said three</p>
<p>   or so years ago: there will never ever be a GST. You were content</p>
<p>   then to say I can see into the future. There will never ever be</p>
<p>   a GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>So are you saying that somebody in my position should never have</p>
<p>   a different view on policy?</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Not at all? I'm suggesting that when you said it then....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, you're not comparing like with the like. You're asking</p>
<p>   me whether on all of the information available to me as Prime Minister</p>
<p>   do I believe the tax plan is credible and deliverable. My answer</p>
<p>   to that is yes. If you're saying to me do I now have a different</p>
<p>   position in relation to tax reform then I did three years ago the</p>
<p>   answer is also yes. And I'm putting it out before the Australian</p>
<p>   people in advance of an election. Unlike my predecessor who said</p>
<p>   one thing before the 1993 election, scrambled back into office on</p>
<p>   the basis of it, took away the promised tax cuts and increased every</p>
<p>   tax he could lay his hands on. Now there's a vast difference</p>
<p>   between the bloke who says one thing before an election and does</p>
<p>   another when he gets back, and another bloke who says before the</p>
<p>   election this is what I intend to do if you vote for me.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Well when you say one thing before an election and another thing</p>
<p>   after the election, there are your core promises and your non-core</p>
<p>   promises. You're not totally innocent on that front.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah but look Kerry, we are having a fundamental debate about taxation</p>
<p>   reform and about the credibility of the Labor Party and the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party on tax reform. We are acknowledging the reality that the Australian</p>
<p>   taxation system is rotting. It needs to be fundamentally changed</p>
<p>   and the only way you can do that is to bring in a goods and services</p>
<p>   tax along with a lot of other reforms. Because unless you do that</p>
<p>   we are not going to have enough money into the future to fund welfare</p>
<p>   in this country. I'm amazed that the welfare lobby takes the</p>
<p>   view that a GST is bad. Indeed I would have thought if the welfare</p>
<p>   lobby is interested in a steady stream of revenue into the future,</p>
<p>   particularly at a State level, it would support what we're</p>
<p>   doing. Because you can't go on relying in this country on a</p>
<p>   wholesale tax system that doesn't touch almost two-thirds of</p>
<p>   economic activity in this country. There was a time when that wholesale</p>
<p>   tax system was worthwhile and was relevant to the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   But two-thirds of our economy is now services, yet the Labor Party</p>
<p>   is saying they should remain completely untouched by the indirect</p>
<p>   tax system. And if you gone on doing that future governments will</p>
<p>   have no alternative but to continue to rely on personal income tax</p>
<p>   as a source of revenue and that is going to squeeze the middle to</p>
<p>   a point where people on ordinary earnings are paying the top marginal</p>
<p>   rate of tax.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>And alongside your tax package are you relaxed and comfortable</p>
<p>   about going to this election on your record with unemployment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe our overall economic record is first class. I would like</p>
<p>   unemployment to be lower, of course I would. But we have generated</p>
<p>   300,000 new jobs in the time that we've been in Government.</p>
<p>   We've turned a $10.5 billion deficit into a surplus in just</p>
<p>   two years, a year ahead of prediction. We've got the lowest</p>
<p>   interest rates in 30 years. A very strong level of business investment.</p>
<p>   And as the next necessary step, we alone have the courage and the</p>
<p>   commitment to embrace proper reform. You can't have tax relief</p>
<p>   and tax cuts without lasting tax reform any more. That option has</p>
<p>   gone in this country.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But those...if you win the election and you then get your package</p>
<p>   intact through the Senate. We've then got to wait, we will</p>
<p>   have to wait two years for your tax reform package to be in place</p>
<p>   and then at least three years before it begins to have any effect,</p>
<p>   whatever that will be, on the economy.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it wouldn't be three years. But Kerry we are at least willing</p>
<p>   to undertake the responsibility of fundamental reform. I mean the</p>
<p>   Labor Party knows. Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans in 1985 were Paul</p>
<p>   Keating's strongest supporters of a 12.5% consumption tax and</p>
<p>   they know, and you know, everybody who's followed politics</p>
<p>   in this country in the last twenty years knows that deep down that</p>
<p>   the next great thing to be done to fix the Australian economy is</p>
<p>   to fix the tax system.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But right now we're talking about unemployment. Tomorrow night</p>
<p>   Peter Costello will be on the programme with Kim Beazley to talk</p>
<p>   about Labor's record.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but can I also say to you that one of the advantages of the</p>
<p>   new tax plan is that you will reduce the costs of doing business</p>
<p>   in this country by $10.5 billion a year. And that is....</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But right now unemployment is stuck at almost exactly the same</p>
<p>   level it was at when you came into office. Long term unemployment</p>
<p>   is up and youth unemployment is up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well one of the ways that you could get that down would be to reduce</p>
<p>   the cost of doing business in this country...</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But that's two years away. What are you going to do in the</p>
<p>   first two years?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah but Kerry, if we're talking about comparisons the Labor</p>
<p>   Party had 13 years. They left us with a high unemployment rate.</p>
<p>   Kim Beazley took it to 11.2%. They left us with a tax system which</p>
<p>   is in decay. They left us with a huge deficit. Your complaint apparently</p>
<p>   is that it's not acceptable to tackle the need for tax reform</p>
<p>   because it's going to take two years to do it. </p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>No I haven't said that and I'm not making a complaint.</p>
<p>   I'm asking questions and in particular at the moment I'm</p>
<p>   asking about unemployment. Your tax reforms would begin to be implemented</p>
<p>   in July of the year 2000. Right at this moment unemployment is stuck</p>
<p>   at 8.3%, youth unemployment higher than ever before, and so on.</p>
<p>   So what will you do in the first two years of your next Government</p>
<p>   to get the unemployment rate down? What vision do you have for that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if the Labor Party and the Democrats had passed the unfair</p>
<p>   dismissal law that we put up a year ago I believe that unemployment,</p>
<p>   particularly youth unemployment, would have been lower because the</p>
<p>   strongest complaint that I still get from small business about capacity</p>
<p>   to employ relates to the unfair dismissal laws. And let me remind</p>
<p>   you and the viewers that the Labor Party and the Democrats and the</p>
<p>   Greens have persistently blocked that measure in the Senate and</p>
<p>   we'll put it up again if we win the next election. Now, I'm</p>
<p>   not saying that alone would solve the problem but it does....</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Do you have new measures to tackle unemployment in the next two</p>
<p>   years?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>One new measure is to change the taxation system.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>I'm saying in the next two years because the predictions are</p>
<p>   that growth will slow. If growth slows unemployment will go up.</p>
<p>   What will you do to tackle that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well a lot of things. I mean I would offer in whatever economic</p>
<p>   climate we face a set of policies that will keep interest rates</p>
<p>   low. I mean you talk about levels of unemployment. Levels of unemployment</p>
<p>   are affected by interest rates. They are affected by the overall</p>
<p>   investment climate as well as by the micro-elements of employment</p>
<p>   such as the unfair dismissal laws and the operation of industrial</p>
<p>   relations policy.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>And if the dollar continues to fall interest rates will almost</p>
<p>   certainly go up. That, I'd assume you'd agree, that would</p>
<p>   send a bad message to small and big business in terms of investment</p>
<p>   and in terms of jobs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, you know fr</p>
