TRANSCRIPT OF'SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER AT RECEPTION FOR<br />
JAPANESE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENARY COMMEMORATION COUNCIL<br />
IMPERIAL HOTEL, TOKYO 15 MAY 1986<br />
Mr Saito, distinguished members of the Australian Bicentenary<br />
Commemorative Council, thank you very much for joining me<br />
this evening and making it possible for me to convey to you<br />
personally and on behalf of the Government and people of<br />
Australia our thanks for the efforts that you have made in.<br />
considering Japan's participation in Australia's Bicentenary<br />
celebrations of 1988.<br />
I particularly treasure the time that you are putting into this<br />
effort because I am very much aware of the many demands on<br />
the time of such eminent gentlemen.<br />
For more than half of the two hundred years of European<br />
settlement that is to be celebrated in 1988 Australia has had<br />
contact with Japan but as you all know during the last<br />
years our links have developed spectacularly and despite our<br />
different cultures and languages we have achieved very real<br />
interdependence and a very substantial affinity.<br />
No one, of course, with any certainty can predict the future<br />
but it seems to me that because of the fundamental characteristics<br />
of our two countries, the nature of our economies and the fact<br />
of geography suggests that our interests will be closely<br />
intertwined for very many years to come.<br />
My Government is delighted that you have decided to make a<br />
substantial contribution to Australia's Bicentennial Science<br />
Centre. This project located in the national capital's<br />
parliamentary~ triangle will-provide a very permanent reminder<br />
-of the clo'seness of the relationship between our two countries<br />
as the Australian nation enters its third century and I thinkwe<br />
must all agree that it is fitting that that relationship<br />
should be symbolised by a science and technology centre as<br />
that relationship between us has flowered in the age of<br />
technology. I am very glad to note also that you endorse Japan's<br />
participation in a number of other events and activities<br />
during our Bicentennial year. In particular through the<br />
participation of the Nippon Maru in the tall ships event<br />
which will be a spectacular part of the celebrations early<br />
in the* Bicentennial year. </p>
<p>2<br />
The Prime Minister's very special gift of 300,000 cherry<br />
trees which will be strategically placed around our new<br />
Parliament House and other important parts. And of course<br />
also your participation in Expo ' 88 in Brisbane will enable<br />
very many hundreds of thousands to come to know Japan better<br />
in our Bicentenary year.<br />
May I, in conclusion gentlemen, thank you again most sincerely.<br />
I repeat personally and on behalf of the Government and the<br />
people of Australia and in thanking you also thank the<br />
Japanese private sector for its decision to participate so<br />
substantially in our Bicentennial celebrations particularly<br />
for your contribution to the national science centre. I<br />
express the hope that each one of you will come and personally<br />
inspect that centre after it is completed in 1988 because it<br />
will be one of the permanent centrepieces of reminder to<br />
this and succeeding generations of the importance of the<br />
relationship between our two countries.<br />
Thank you. </p>
