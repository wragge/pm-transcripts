AUSTRALIA-TAPA N RELATIONS<br />
AUSTRALIAN INSTITUJTE OF IN~ TERNATIONAL AFFAIRS<br />
SYDNEY, N. S. W. 12_ JUNE 1971<br />
&amp; ech by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Thank you for asking me to come here today to speak to you<br />
about the relationships between the Japanese and ourselves. As you know, I was not<br />
the Foreign Minister for very many years, but the very first submission that I put<br />
to Cabinet of any consequence was in April of last year when I presented a paper<br />
relating to our future relationships with Japan. At the same time, I received the<br />
approval of the Cabinet to institute what I regard as the highest level Inter-Departmental<br />
Committee, headed by the Permanent Heads of the most important Departments of<br />
State, to keep under continuous review the relationships between Japan and Australia<br />
and, once they felt they had come to concrete recommendations, to be able to present<br />
papers to us. I also want to mention the fact that subsequently the Government<br />
also considered I think in February our relationships with the People's Republic<br />
of China. Subsequently we were able to consider papers relating to a new relationship<br />
with the Soviet and particularly what we could do with the Soviet Far East.<br />
Mr. President, I hope my Department has had the good sense<br />
to send to you a copy of my speech to a meeting of citizens in Sydney a few weeks ago.<br />
Because I am sure it broke niew ground and I am as sure as I can be of this, that it had<br />
to be done because we live in this changing area changing so quickly that we can't<br />
be left behind. And I can more or less paraphrase what you have said. We must be<br />
playing our part to see if we can make our contribution to peace and to the development<br />
of the whole of this area. So I put it to you then that we have been doing a tremendous<br />
amount of thinking. And with the recent reorganisation of the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs and its elevation in stature, and I believe in importance, and I hope that will<br />
continue then I think you will find that continually we will be trying to make our<br />
contribution wherever we can towards the goals that I mentioned to you a few moments<br />
ago. The most important of them at least as far ahead as you and I<br />
can see, will I think, be the two countries you have mentioned, Japan materially, of<br />
course, and I hope politically as well but Indonesia too for many, many reasons<br />
because it is a very vast country and one to which we will pay increasing importance<br />
in the years to come. I mentioned to you the breakthrough we made in the middle of<br />
last year when we decided on a three-year programme of aid something we had never<br />
done before to Indonesia. And we extended our appropriations in a way that we had not<br />
done in the. case of any other country. a 9 / 2 </p>
<p>So I think you can take it, therefore, Mr. President, that we<br />
reflect in the Government t he views that you put a few moments ago of the enormous<br />
importance of Japan, the enormous importance of Indonesia and the importance of<br />
Papua/ New Guinea to us as well.<br />
So, consequently, I now come to this responsibility that has<br />
been given to me today. That is to officially open this Conference, which as I have<br />
said, fundamentally relates to the bilateral relationships between Australia and<br />
Japan in the 1970' s. I think you know, and I can repeat this, that it is of fundamental<br />
importance, not onl y to us, but also to the Pacific theatre and particularly to South-<br />
East Asia, but not exclusively because it is not exclusively a regional subject.<br />
We live in a world of interdependence which involves Europe, America and the African<br />
continent, as well as the great nations of the Asian mainland.<br />
Events in the region have a bearing on changes in the power<br />
structure politics and economics in most other places. But today I want to concern<br />
myself mainly with Japan and Australia, and again I emphasise to you that in the speech<br />
I made at the Citizens' Dinner a few weeks ago, I emphasised that in the immediate<br />
future and as far ahead as we could see, Japan was the country that in material, and<br />
I believe in political terms, can offer the greatest advantages of co-operation between<br />
US. And I believe, too, that when the history of this decade is written,<br />
the changes now occurring in Australian-Japanese relations, and what I hope will<br />
happen in the next 10 years or so, will prove to be one of the most significant developments<br />
of its kind. The War is far behind us, its tragedies and sufferings of the<br />
past, and the impeiatives of the future, are, in fact, here. So we have to look ahead.<br />
We must plan ahead, and we must aspire to a new world of peace and prosperity in Asia<br />
and the Pacific. And I believe that Australia and Japan together in several ways, have<br />
much to do so that they can make a contribution to that goal.<br />
Today we are at the threshold of a new era in our relationships<br />
with Japan. This isn't something that is going to be spelt out with a crop of new<br />
decisions or dramatic changes in the relationships that exist already. But it is<br />
something that will be reflected by an even closer relationship than the one we already<br />
have, and one which will have superimposed on the developing economic connection,<br />
some political overtones stronger than we have heard up until now.<br />
Sometime ago, my Government felt it was time to do a<br />
stocktaking, because the progress of our relationships, along a well-ordered path, had<br />
beentaken up to a point vmh ere this could usefully be done. I n-e ntioned to you a few<br />
moments ago, the formation of the Inter -Departmental Committee and the Report that<br />
is now before the Government for detailed consideration.<br />
There has also been a recent decision to form a consultative<br />
committee on trade, and related matters at Ministerial level between Australia and<br />
Japan. The Deputy Prime Minister, my colleague Mr. Anthony, was able to confirm<br />
this during his recent visit to Tokyo. / 3 </p>
<p>Now I have for long taken the view that the co-ordination of<br />
diplomatic relationships between any two countries ought to be the responsibility of<br />
the-Department of Foreign Affairs. And I can assure you that in trying to work out<br />
sensible and better relationships between the two countries, that with us now, our<br />
Foreign Affairs Department will be taking the leading administrative role, advised where<br />
necessary by the other Departments, in economics and finance by the Treasury, and<br />
trade* by the Department of Trade, education and science by that Ministry, and<br />
correspondingly, too, with the other Departments, such as National Development, or<br />
in national development schemes, by Mr. Swartz, the Minister for National<br />
Development himself. Now these developments alone at Government level will do a lot<br />
to enlarge the framework within which we can plan ahead. I think, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
when we look directly at the bilateral relationships between two countries such as<br />
those between Australia and Japan we must be clear about our motives and our<br />
objectives. It is also wise that we be completely frank about them.<br />
And if I can say this to you about frankness, in the recent<br />
discussions I had with the Japanese Prime Minister and the various many discussion * s I<br />
had with Mr. Aichi, I have found them completely frank, willing to discuss the most<br />
difficult of problems and anxious, I believe, to co-operate with us for the political and<br />
economic betterment of the South-East Asian region.<br />
Now the first motive on our part, naturally enough, as you well<br />
said in your quotation from U Thant and if I can change it a little bit is national<br />
self -interest. This goes for any country anywhere in the world, and I can assure you, it<br />
goes for us just as much as it goes for anyone else.<br />
Our relationship with Japan should continue to assist the broadlybased<br />
development of the Australian economy and help us to maintain an independent<br />
foreign policy. It should also seek to develop our relationships with other friends and<br />
allies, regional neighbours and trading partners. I like to hope that every Australian<br />
businessman, with an eye on exports, will regard himself as some kind of a latter-day<br />
Marco Polo and go out in search of new markets. He will have the Government<br />
supporting him when he does.<br />
And the second objective is that our co-operation with Japan<br />
should be directed more and more to meeting the needs and aspirations of the<br />
developing countries in our region. We have a wonderland of new experience before<br />
us where a " green revolution" is coming to the paddy fields and plantations of<br />
Asian countries. The miracles of modern science and technology are beginning to<br />
touch the lives of millions who, for the first time, can see the prospect of a better<br />
life being added to the old, sustaining forces of their ancient cultures.<br />
We want them, our neighbours to the North, to feel part of a<br />
broader region, secure within it and being able to share in its progress.<br />
And I believe, too, that we have a remarkable opportunity not<br />
only to help, but to be able to draw them together, because in my experience as a<br />
Foreign Minister, whilst I wasn't there for long, at least I visited South-East Asia and<br />
Japan on several occasions. I think you can take it that they trust us. They know we<br />
have no predatory intentions arid I think they recognise, too, that our aid is given<br />
freely and generously. We don't put any bans or ties on it. We don't ask for repayment * ao/ 4 </p>
<p>and what we give we give because we feel we are making a contribution to their development<br />
and at the same time, in a reciprocal way, adding to our own.<br />
And the third objective is that we will be looking to the establishment<br />
of a stable relationship with Japan and among the other three major powers in the<br />
Asian-Pacific area the United States, the USSR and the People's Republic of China.<br />
These considerations will, of course, have to be matched to the<br />
continuing satisfaction of Japan's legitimate economic aspirations.<br />
So, ladies and gentlemen, there you have our motives and our<br />
objectives. They are, I believe, free of enmities, untouched by racism or compromised<br />
by different ideologies. It is time for us in our thinking to move out from the shadow<br />
of the great nuclear deterrents and the " curtains" and " walls" of the past into a more<br />
positive world of progress. And I know in trying to achieve the kind of change we in<br />
the government want to achieve that with you, Mr. President, and with everyone here<br />
today, we will find the most willing companions and accomplices.<br />
Now as to achieving our objectives in our relationships with Japan<br />
we have a solid base to build on. The Trade Agreement or the Agreement on<br />
Commerce, as it is called, of 1957, was a foundation stone of the first importance.<br />
The beginnings were small, but the growith has been rapid.<br />
Japan is now our largest trading partner and Australia is Japan's<br />
second largest trading partner after the United States.<br />
The political relationship has developed more slowly but it is<br />
becoming significant both on a bilateral and on a regional basis. These links have<br />
been supported by business, cultural and scientific exchanges and the encouragement<br />
of tourism between the two countries.<br />
The relationships are plain for everyone to see. I refer to<br />
them because this is our starting point for the developments of this decade.<br />
We also have to remember that there are great differences in<br />
national power, differences in history and social traditions and differences in the<br />
decision-making processes both in Australia and in Japan. To my Japanese friends here,<br />
I can assure them that by now, I have just about learnt how difficult it is for a person<br />
whose mind is cast in a Western mould to be able sometimes to understand quite how<br />
slowly the Japanese work and how frequently a smile doesn't mean " yes" but all too<br />
frequently means " no". Now the remarkable post-war economic growth in Japan has taken<br />
her into the front rank of the industrialised nations. Her gross national product is now<br />
third in the world after the United States and the Soviet Union, and she is emerging<br />
as a major Asian/ Pacific and world power.<br />
You may ask what will this economic strength do to us?<br />
It has already done much, and we expect those benefits to increase<br />
in the future. It is natural that we should because we have the commodities Japan<br />
needs, mostly right in quality and price, and available on a relatively short haul,<br />
while Japan can supply the exports we want and cannot yet make ourselves. </p>
<p>In short, our great natural resources provide Japan with the raw<br />
and processed materials she does not possess and we can get from her the products of<br />
her highly advanced technologies those products we cannot yet provide economically<br />
or in significant quantity to meet the demands of our industrialised society.<br />
As you all know, vwe are twelve and a half million people,, and<br />
the Japanese are over 100 million people. If we look to our relationship as a kind of<br />
partnership, is it lop-sided? I don't believe it is.<br />
Each of us has strengths to share which are not determined<br />
by numbers. I think the relationship can be divided up into three phases.<br />
The first followed the end of the war when Japan became a<br />
substantial buyer of our primary products, mostly wool.<br />
Then came the second phase when we found a fortune-in<br />
minerals. This gave us the boom years of the sixties. Japan took our coal, our iron<br />
ore, our bauxite, and our maganese in addition to our wool, our sugar and our be.-A<br />
Today Japan takes 25 per cent of our total exports over four<br />
times what she did twenty years ago and of this, minerals and metals takes up<br />
54 per cent. Now we are into the third phase. This is where we move on<br />
into a broader economic relationship. This third phase, as we see it, involves a<br />
continuing, and I hope, an enlarging market in Japan for our rural products and our<br />
minerals, the introduction of more joint enterprises, particularly in the minerals<br />
and metals industries, and finally, new outlets for our manufactures.<br />
To date, Japanese investment in Australia has been small. For<br />
the last financial year, it accounted for only about two per cent of total direct<br />
investment in Australia. Now, while I expect this to increase, and no doubt it will be<br />
concentrated in the natural resources area, at this stage it seems unlikely tcb; very<br />
large in relation to the total levels of private overseas investment in this cou:. r.<br />
Now so far, most investment from Japan has conformed with<br />
our preference for foreign investment in the form of equity participation with<br />
Australian enterprises. There is, I am glad to say, plenty of movement at both<br />
Government and business level in this third and latest phase.<br />
There have been annual consultations at official level between<br />
our respective Foreign Ministries since 1967 as well as ad hoc co'nsultations bc,<br />
other Ministries. Frequent consultations at Ministerial level will now take a mn~ are<br />
regular character with the formation of the Consultative Committee to which I have<br />
already referred. At industry level, a Business Co-operation Committee bas<br />
existed for the past nine years and meets regularly. This year tv, inpo~ ec onomic<br />
missions have come to Australia. One was financial and the other was concrnned<br />
with natural resources. */ 6 </p>
<p>I am confident, therefore, that the right climate now exists for<br />
us to go ahead even better than we have done in the past and, I think to do so for the<br />
benefit of both countries. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the consolidation and<br />
development of our bilateral relationship with Japan advantageous to us both in national<br />
terms is also of considerable importance to the economic and political stability of the<br />
region and I believe that together, and with others in the region, we can take a fuller<br />
part in regional affairs in the future.<br />
Because of her economic strength, Japan has a formidable contributic<br />
to make to economic aid in the region.<br />
The Japanese Government last year announced a 1975 target for<br />
foreign aid, both official and private, equal to one per cent of GNP. If this is achieved,<br />
then something like 500 million will be given in that year just about three times<br />
what was given in 1969. Already there has been a 40 per cent rise in Japan's foreign<br />
aid for 19703 over the preceding year.<br />
Now, two-thirds of Japan's total foreign aid contribution goes to<br />
Asia. This makes Japan a force of tremendous importance to the economic fortunes of<br />
the developing countries in the region.<br />
Australia's role in this, compared with Japan's, must necessarily<br />
be small, but it mus t be remembered that we rank very high among the aid-givers in<br />
relative terms and we, too, are committing about one per cent of our gross national<br />
production to developing countries. mainly in Asia and the Pacific and including the<br />
Territory of Papua/ New Guinea.<br />
Might I interpolate this comment to you on, DAC aid, particularly<br />
the kind of aid Australia gives to the Asian countries, because last . year at the DAC<br />
meeting in Tokyo, when we were starting to talk about the figures and I have never<br />
had them analysed as well as I had them analysed by our own people in Japan we found<br />
that when it came to official aid, that is, aid of a kind that is giver, by the Government<br />
rather than private enterprise assistance, that without any doubt at all, we led the<br />
way. Or, if I could put it a little differently, with the exception of France, in connection<br />
with its colonial territories, and Portugal, there is no other country that makes the<br />
same kind of contribution as we do to official aid. And the value of that official aid,<br />
being on a non-repayable basis, and at the request of the country concerned, has the<br />
highest possible quality. So we spectlcally asked that in future whenever the DAC was<br />
considering aid programmes, it had first of all to divide the aid into official and private<br />
aid so that we can come to our own conclusions about the contribution made by the<br />
Australian taxpayer. And secondly, when we were looking at the components of the<br />
official aid, we had to make up our minds as to its quality and, consequently, the debt<br />
repayment problems, and the problems of the recipient countries, whether they<br />
willingly participated, or the ones that were initiated, the kind of aid that they wished<br />
to receive. You will be familiar with the multilateral organisations to which<br />
we belong, and where we sit in Japan's company. / 7 </p>
<p>I refer to ECAFE, ASPAC, the Asian Development Bank, the<br />
Colombo Plan, and the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD to which I<br />
have just referred. WIe also share common membership of aid co-ordinating groups<br />
assisting individual countries in the Asian region.<br />
There are, inevitably, political associations which develop as the<br />
result of increasing regional involvement, and I believe Japan will assume a larger role<br />
in the future. It is true, too, that while we may separate trade and politics,<br />
economic progress cannot take place in a political vacuum.<br />
I think the presence of Japan at last year's conference on<br />
Cambodia at Djakarta was one of the first signs of her growing political influence and<br />
its deployment to the region's advantage.<br />
I see no reason why Australia cannot work usefully with Japan at<br />
the political level as well as the economic level.<br />
And if I can come back: to Djakarta, I do comment very favourably<br />
about the role taken by Mr. Aichi as the representatives of the Japanese Government<br />
and people. And I do comment very favourably about the arduous efforts they made with<br />
the Malaysians and the Indonesians to try and induce other countries to try and restore<br />
the ideals of the Geneva Conference in 1954 and to try and get the various elements to<br />
the conference table to see if we could establish peace in Cambodia.<br />
I now come to the question of Japan's military strength, its defence<br />
capability and how I see it now and in the future.<br />
It was recently announced that Japan's Defence Agency would be<br />
doubling its defence expenditure during the period 1972-1976. The amount to be spent<br />
will still be only about 1 per cent of her gross national product, which is far less than<br />
the percentages committed by other major powers. COurs, by the way is 3. 69 per cent<br />
of GNP. Now these are the facts. For obvious reasons, we dislike any<br />
increases in defence expenditure. Japan has given repeated assurances that she<br />
does not intend to pursue a military role beyond that of self-defence. We fully understand<br />
this attitude. We note that the programme has been public knowledge for a year<br />
and that all expenditure has to be approved by the Diet. In other words, it has a full<br />
exposure to the public, and is dealt with by democratic processes familiar to us.<br />
The programme provides for only small increases in defence<br />
manpower and for moderate increases in equipment. It will aim particularly at<br />
strengthening the air and sea self-defence forces. </p>
<p>Japan's defence role was set out in a White Paper last year. This<br />
showed that while Japan would maintain its security links with the United States, it would<br />
assume, because of its economic strength, greater responsibilities for conventional<br />
defence. It would not possess offensive or nuclear weapons.<br />
And I remind you, too, that Japan is perilously close to Mainland<br />
China. Mainland China is in possession of thermonuclear weapons. Japan has none. I<br />
want you to remember that Japan is in a very vulnerable position and that a few thermonuclear<br />
weapons could, of course, do permnanent harm if they were ever used against<br />
that country. And, of course, we have to remember that Japan would also have<br />
had to-provide for enlarged defence responsibilities when the United States handed over<br />
Okinawa. To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, I believe Australia and Japan<br />
can enlarge the base of their friendship and co-operation to the benefit of both<br />
countries. I believe that together we can do a lot to help stability and<br />
economic progress in the Asian and Pacific region. I believe that what we do together<br />
and what we do within the region will continue tc 11-s based on mutual respect and<br />
trust, and I believe that we can know each other better.<br />
So we want to help, and we want to help with the co-operation of<br />
all Australian people. So for that reason I want to thank you for asking me here tod-ay,<br />
and I want to thank you, too, for coming. Arid having said that, may I now officially<br />
declare this conference open. </p>
