MP, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />CANBERRA<br />NATIONAL RFTIREMENT BENEFITS 19 October 1972<br />I wish to announce to the House the terms of reference for<br />a committee of enquiry into the best way of abolishing the means test<br />over the next three years and -f responsibly financing this significant<br />measure in association with the possible introduction of a national<br />superannuation scheme.<br />The Government's decision to introduce means-test-free<br />pensions for people aged 65 and over represents a major social advance<br />with considerable financial, economic and social implications.<br />We accordingly announced in the 1972-73 Budget speech our<br />decision to appoint a committee of enquiry to examine and report on<br />these matters, including the question of how the proposal for<br />means-test-free pensions could be responsibly financed with particular<br />reference to national superannuation.<br />As announced in the 1972-73 Budget speech, the Government<br />is committed to abolition, within the next three years, of the means<br />test on ae m. nsion eligibility for residentially qualified men and<br />women aged 65 years and over.<br />The Government has also decided that the free-of-means test<br />pension will be subject to tax but, following past practice, provision<br />will be made to exempt or partially relieve from taxation persons in<br />the lower income groups receiving free-of-means test pension.<br />In addition, the Government has determined that eligibility<br />for supplementary assistance and for Commonwealth ancillary pension<br />benefits will be conditional, as now, on satisfaction of the relevant<br />special means test../ 2</p>
<p>The terms of reference of the committee will be<br />" Having in mind the policy of the Government to abolish<br />the means test within the next three years on age pension<br />eligibility for residentially qualified men and women aged<br />years and over, as announced in the 1972 Budget speech,<br />to report on<br />1. Matters involved in the implementation of the<br />abolition of the means test in accordance with the<br />Government's announcement as set out in the Treasurer's<br />1972-73 Budget speech.<br />2. Appropriate ways and means of financing the free-ofmeans<br />test retirement benefits associated with a possible<br />national superannuation scheme, including<br />the type of national superannuation;<br />the persons to be covered;<br />whether the scheme of national superannuation<br />should be voluntary or compulsory.<br />3. The relationship of the new free-of-means test<br />retirement benefits and national superannuation ( if any)<br />to private schemes and to life assurance.<br />4. The method of adjusting the new benefits over time.<br />The taxation treatment of the new benefits.<br />6. Methods of making the administration of the new<br />scheme as simple as possible.<br />7. Any associated matters that the committee considers<br />relevant to the objective of the enquiry."<br />I am glad to be able to announce that the committee of<br />three to enquire into these matters will be under the Chairmanship<br />of Sir Leslie Melville, C. B. E. With him as members of the<br />committee will be MR T. P. Scott and MR J. E. M. Dixon. On behalf of the<br />Government, I express our thanks to these gentlemen for agreeing to<br />undertake this important and substantial task.<br />CANBERRA</p>
