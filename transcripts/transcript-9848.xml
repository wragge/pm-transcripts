PRIME MINISTER 134/ 95<br />
*" EMBARGOED UNTIL 9: 00AM, SUNDAY 19 NOVEMBER 1995'<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S XI<br />
The following team will represent the Prime Minister's XI against the<br />
West Indi~ s at Manuka Oval on 5 December:<br />
Michael Bevan ( NSW) Captain<br />
Mark Harrity ( SA)<br />
Dene Hills ( TAS)<br />
Brad Hogg ( WA)<br />
Dean Jones ( VIC)<br />
Mark Lavender ( WA)<br />
Shane Lee ( NSW)<br />
Carl Rackemann ( QLD)<br />
Wade Seccombe ( QLD) Wicketkeeper<br />
Andrew Symonds ( QLD)<br />
Brad Williams ( VIC)<br />
Brad Haddin ( ACT) Twelfth Man<br />
Current test players were not available for selection because of the timing of<br />
the Third Test versus Pakistan in Sydney. But I believe that the team is a<br />
competitive and attractive one, which includes some of our finest players of the<br />
past decade and a number of big stars of the present and future.<br />
I am delighted that Carl Rackemann will be playing. His selection is a<br />
thoroughly deserved recognition of his outstanding services to Australian and<br />
Queensland cricket.<br />
Dean Jones is an exciting and popular player, who is playing as well as he was<br />
when he appeared in this fixture for the first time more than 10 years ago.<br />
Canberra's cricket fans will again have the chance to admire the great talents<br />
of their favourite son, Michael Bevan. The award of the captaincy to this<br />
exciting young player is an honour to ACT cricket and an indication of<br />
Michael's potential on the national and international scene. </p>

And among those members of the team yet to play test cricket, there are<br />
outstanding players who have every chance to wear the green and gold before<br />
long. It will be a great pleasure to welcome the West Indies team to Canberra once<br />
again. I am sure the match will live up to the fine traditions of this important<br />
event in the local sporting calendar.<br />
