COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
THIRTY-FIVE HOUR WEEK<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 12 September 1972]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)--<br />
I ask for leave to make a statement<br />
about the 35-hour week.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Is leave granted? There<br />
being no objection, leave is granted.<br />
Mr McMAHON-I do so because it is a<br />
matter of national importance about which<br />
the facts should be made clear, and<br />
because the campaign for its widespread<br />
introduction throughout industry threatens<br />
to damage confidence in the economy and<br />
in the Government's programme to secure<br />
full employment, industrial stability, economic<br />
growth and price stability, and a<br />
better quality of life for all people.<br />
The Government is opposed to any<br />
extension of a 35-hour week at this stage<br />
of Australia's development, either on an<br />
industry by industry basis or as a maximum<br />
working week to replace the standard<br />
40-hour week of the past 2 decades<br />
for the whole of the Australian nati onal<br />
work force. The Government has already<br />
demonstrated its opposition by its intervention<br />
in wage cases which include claims<br />
for a reduction in hours to 35 a week, and<br />
by frequent ministerial statements designed<br />
to warn the community of the price it<br />
would have to pay if the Labor Party and<br />
the trade unions had their way. The Gov-<br />
18988172 erment wishes to have this matter freely<br />
debated in this Parliament now so that the<br />
people of Australia will be alert to what is<br />
happening, and so that the reasons for the<br />
Government's attitude are better understood.<br />
At the outset, I want to state that the<br />
Government is not opposed to the concept<br />
of more real leisure for the Australian<br />
working man any more than it is in any<br />
way opposed to the concept of increased<br />
real wages for the work force of this<br />
country. It applauds both concepts, and by<br />
its progressive policies over many years it<br />
has worked steadily to achieve both objectives.<br />
But it also believes that in moving<br />
towards them the gains made must be genuine<br />
and can be supported by the resources<br />
of the country without undue strain on the<br />
economy. If they cannot, there will be an<br />
inevitable wastage of those benefits through<br />
crippling costs, runaway inflation and economic<br />
instability. Then full employment<br />
will be a myth and more leisure a mirage.<br />
This is not the time for a 35-hour week.<br />
I repeat that we are opposed to it at this<br />
stage of the country's development. f stress<br />
that poinit-at this stage of the country's<br />
development. The country cannot afford it<br />
now or in the immediate future. Before I </p>
<p>tell you why, let us look at the facts as<br />
they are known. The present position is<br />
that a 40-hour week is worked generally in<br />
industry throughout Australia although a<br />
shorter working week applies in some areas<br />
of employment. These include some Commonwealth,<br />
State and local government<br />
employees; some white collar workers in<br />
private industry; certain mining industries,<br />
and stevedoring and container depots associated<br />
with the waterfront. However, it is<br />
sufficient for me to say, in this context<br />
that a standard working week of 40 hours<br />
applies widely throughout the country for<br />
most of the work force. And on that standard<br />
the nation's business, industrial and<br />
commercial activity has been based. It<br />
would be folly to upset it now.<br />
As a point of history, the movement<br />
over the last half century or so has been<br />
from 48 hours to 44 hours, and then to 40<br />
hours in 1948 at which point it stahiised<br />
until recently. Obviously, there cannot be a<br />
continuing downward progression in hours<br />
because theoretically we would be moving<br />
towards the absurd position of no work at<br />
all. A whole complex of factors has<br />
dictated the level of the standard working<br />
week over the years but today the overriding<br />
consideration has to be the capacity of<br />
the economy to bear the cost-in truth,<br />
the capacity of the citizen himself to bear<br />
the cost of new concessions. That is the<br />
position we are facing now.<br />
The campaign for a 35-hour week has<br />
been stepped up in the last two or three<br />
years. The Australian Council of Trade<br />
Unions Congress declared for it in 1969<br />
and again in 1971, and the official policy<br />
of the Labor Party lays it down and it was<br />
confirmed at the Launceston Conference of<br />
the ALP last year. Spokesmen for both<br />
organisations have stated the case for it, in<br />
a variety of forms, on many recent<br />
occasions. In some industries trade unions<br />
have succeeded in their claims before the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,<br />
the most recent being in certain container<br />
depot unions. In other industries, claims<br />
have yet to be resolved and strikes, stoppages<br />
and limitations on work have taken<br />
place in an effort to apply duress on government<br />
and employers. The Government<br />
cannot stand aside idly while such a buildup<br />
is taking place, especially when new<br />
pressures on the economy have to be avoided and when there is abundant evidence<br />
from recent polls that a majority, a<br />
sizeable majority of Australians, is opposed<br />
to a 35-hour week at this stage.<br />
I have noted that in recent public statements<br />
Labor Party and union spokesmen<br />
have sought to justify claims for a<br />
working week on the grounds that it would<br />
increase job opportunities, and give more<br />
leisure to the work force as a whole. Both<br />
are assumptions without any basis in fact<br />
and both, in real terms, are far more likely<br />
to be wrong than right. So far as job opportunities<br />
are concerned, a shorter working<br />
week would be more likely to involve overtime<br />
at penalty rates. This would inevitably<br />
mean more wage-cost pressure and more<br />
inflation. Increased leisure, for the minority<br />
who might want it and get it, would mean<br />
a costly personal sacrifice in material benefits.<br />
The simple fact, Mr Speaker, is that<br />
as a nation, we cannot have it all ways.<br />
We cannot expect and get increased social<br />
welfare benefits, reduced taxes and other<br />
concessions-be paid more and then work<br />
less. In the national context, a shorter working<br />
week must be set against the wishes of most<br />
people for improvements in social services,<br />
housing, education, health, and other services<br />
of a practical kind affecting the individual<br />
and the community. The national<br />
acclaim given to last month's Budget which<br />
concentrated on these matters, while the<br />
polls said ' No' to a 35-hour week, shows<br />
where the public preference lies. The cost<br />
of a 35-hour week, whether it comes piecemeal<br />
or as a whole, would be staggering.<br />
It is more than the economy could bear at<br />
this stage as it is emerging from a sluggish<br />
period with inflationary pressures still at<br />
work. Let us look briefly at some of the effects<br />
if a shorter working week was introduced.<br />
The critical factor is the impact on unit<br />
labour costs and prices. What would the<br />
effect of a 35-hour week be to the national<br />
wage bill and to inflation? The increase in<br />
the wage bill would be something of the<br />
order of $ 2,500m to $ 2,600m and, in some<br />
circumstances, could exceed $ 3,000m a year.<br />
Add these figures to the known effect of<br />
recent wage increases on our inflationary<br />
problem and all the danger signals start<br />
flashing. </p>
<p>The ramifications of such a huge increase<br />
in the national wage bill would be felt right<br />
through the economy. The surge in labour<br />
costs would force prices up, compromise<br />
employment prospects in some areas, create<br />
inequalities in income distribution, and add<br />
new burdens to our manufacturing and rural<br />
industries, our transport services and our<br />
trade. My colleagues directly concerned<br />
with various aspects of the economy will<br />
have more to say about all these problems<br />
later. The sum of it all would be a serious<br />
assault on our standard of living. It would<br />
mean a cutback in real purchasing power,<br />
that is, in our capacity to buy material goods<br />
and services. This capacity is, of course,<br />
fundamental to achieving a desired standard<br />
of living.<br />
Honourable members may fairly ask:<br />
' Will not increased productivity help to<br />
absorb the increase in unit labour costs?<br />
Will not the incentive of more leisure improve<br />
work performance?' There is no evidence<br />
at all that it will. It is appropriate<br />
here to look at figures relating<br />
to wage increases and productivity.<br />
In the decade or so prior to 1971,<br />
the trend of average earnings showed<br />
an annual increase of 5.4 per cent.<br />
Productivity, in the same period, showed a<br />
growth rate of 2.6 per cent. But in the<br />
year to the December quarter 1971, average<br />
earnings went up 11.5 per cent, and in the<br />
year to the March quarter 1972, they went<br />
up 9 per cent. That is roughly double the<br />
rate for many years prior to 1971.<br />
Productivity in 1970-71 was down to 1.4<br />
per cent, almost half what it had been for<br />
many preceding years. So what we have<br />
been tackling in the last year has been<br />
an abnormal rise in wages and a downturn<br />
in productivity. Are we going to compound<br />
that problem just at a time when we are<br />
turning the corner and getting the trends<br />
on the right track again? Everything the<br />
Government has done has been directed to<br />
keeping the economy on an even keel and<br />
to getting it moving forward in an orderly<br />
way. A 35-hour week would punch a hole<br />
in our policies at a critical time. There is<br />
little evidence, as I have said, to suggest<br />
that a shorter working week would have any<br />
real influence on productivity. The evidence<br />
in other countries on the effect of reduced<br />
working hours on productivity shows that any gains in productivity from a<br />
week are not likely to offset to any substantial<br />
extent the inevitable decline in output<br />
from the shorter week.<br />
One of the most comprehensive studies<br />
available is that carried out by an American<br />
research scholar, Dr F. J. Poper of New<br />
York University. Dr Poper made a critical<br />
evaluation of the empirical evidence underlying<br />
the relationship between hours of work<br />
and labour productivity. He concluded that<br />
at a level of about a 48-hour week, a 1 per<br />
cent decline in hours tended to be offset<br />
by an 0.33 per cent increase in productivity,<br />
but he also expressed the view that at around<br />
40 hours per week decreases in hours are<br />
not likely to bring significant hourly productivity<br />
gains. There is also evidence that<br />
once the working week is reduced generally<br />
below 40 hours, the factors on which a<br />
campaign for reduced hours was based<br />
ceased to apply. In other words, the pressures<br />
for increased leisure ceased and were<br />
replaced by the financial attraction of taking<br />
a second job.<br />
Mr Speaker, let me summarise briefly<br />
what the effects on the nation would be if<br />
the 35-hour week came about, bringing<br />
with it the extra leisure which its advocates<br />
claim as a primary objective. Presumably<br />
they would set their faces against increased<br />
overtime, and presumably they would expect<br />
industry to engage more labour, irrespective<br />
of its fitness for the work to be done and<br />
whether it was qualified. If this happenedthat<br />
is, a reduction in hours, no overtime,<br />
and more leisure-then there would be a<br />
drop in material standards, no matter what<br />
money there was in the pay-packet. That<br />
money just would not go so far. Prices<br />
would be higher, because labour costs would<br />
be greater, and all sorts of inequalities would<br />
arise. There would be no benefit from increased<br />
leisure for the persons on fixed incomes<br />
and on superannuation. There would<br />
be disturbance in industries, costly readjustments<br />
to make and a general disinclination<br />
to plan for growth and expansion.<br />
It is an act of responsible government to<br />
warn against the dangers of a 35-hour week<br />
at this stage of Australia's development. I<br />
am satisfied that the Australian people are<br />
not ' time-servers', concerned only with the </p>
<p>pursuit of leisure. Nor do they include idleness<br />
in their aspirations for higher standards<br />
of living and a genuine improvement in the<br />
quality of life. They do not want to pursue<br />
a 35-hour week when they know it is only<br />
there to be bought at a price which the<br />
community as a whole has to pay. This is a<br />
time of great opportunity for all Australians<br />
and we should use it well. It is not the way to a better life to sit back and say: ' Let<br />
us do less and ask for more'. Let us be<br />
practical. Let us be realistic. Let us not<br />
put the brake on progress just when we are<br />
moving forward to a period of growth and<br />
increasing prosperity for all people in the<br />
community. I present the following paper:<br />
