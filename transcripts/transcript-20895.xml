    <content><![CDATA[<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what do you make of the moves to ban Waltzing Matilda from the Rugby World Cup matches?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's very silly.  I resent it.  Waltzing Matilda is deeply evocative of Australian culture and how can you justify trying to ban the singing of it and allow other presentations which are evocative of the culture of other countries?  But in any event, I pose the question - how are they going to stop it being sung?  You try and stop 82,000 Australians singing Waltzing Matilda - you'll only make their night.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you'll encourage people to sing the song if it is banned?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course I will.  I think it's ridiculous and I'm sure they'll rethink their decision, if they've made the decision.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The board meets on Monday but they are arguing that they don't think it has much cultural significance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nations determine their culture not other people.  Thank you.</p>
