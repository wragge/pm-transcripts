, AUSTRAL1A~<br />
FOR MEDIA 30 JULY 1985<br />
The Government is disappointed that the proposed rebel<br />
cricket tour of South Africa appears iikely to proceed.<br />
On the other hand, it welcomes the moves which have been<br />
made by the Aus~ ralian Cricket Board in an effort to<br />
deter future rebel tours of South Africa.<br />
On behalf of the Government, I reiterate our repudiation<br />
of apartheid, our support for the Gleneagles Agreement<br />
and our opposition t~ o this proposed tour.<br />
Two important developments have occurred since news of<br />
the proposed tour first emerged. First, the<br />
cancellation of the tour by the All Black Rugby Union<br />
teamn has further isolated South Africa in international<br />
sport. Second, the imposition of the state of emergency'<br />
in South Africa has underlined the racial injustice of<br />
the apartheict system and the repressive ruthlessness of<br />
its practitioners.<br />
The growiny world reaction to the apartheid policies and<br />
practices of South Africa has for instance been<br />
reflected in recent resolutions of the United N'ations<br />
and the United States Senate and House of<br />
Representatives, calling for economic sanctions.<br />
While recognising that it is the individual right of<br />
Australian cricketers to decide whether they will tour<br />
South Africa, I nevertheless ask those who have become<br />
involved to think of the consequences of such a tour for<br />
Australia's and their own reputations, for Australia's<br />
international relations, includiny its international<br />
sporting contacts, and, above all, for the oppressed<br />
non-white people of South Africa.<br />
I express the earnest hope that, having reflected deeply<br />
on the important issues of racial equality and justice<br />
wnich are involved, they will reconsider their<br />
decisions. </p>
