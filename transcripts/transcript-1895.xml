3ARTOJ ELECTORATE DINNER<br />
SANIS SOUCI, N. S. W. 2 JULY 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mvr John Gorton<br />
M r Arthur, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
That was quite a list of qualities you laid down that you hoped<br />
would be possessed by a Prime Minister and I would not pretend to<br />
lay claim to all of them. All I can say is that I would try to do as well<br />
as 1 could to fulfil each one you have mentioned.<br />
When you asked me, Mr Arthur, first to come to this gathering,<br />
I was delighted for two reasons. One was because it would give me an<br />
opportunity, as it has given me, to meet, however fleetingly, so many of<br />
the people in this area, such a cross section of Australians living in your<br />
electorate, and some from adjoining electorates. This in itself is for me<br />
something that I think a Prime Minister should try and do as far as it is<br />
possible. I was glad because this was the electorate which, after a long<br />
perid of aberration before they finally decided, sent you to join us in Canberra.<br />
That meant that we had added to our ranks somebody who was prepared to<br />
work hard indeed one of ' the most energetic characters I have ever met in<br />
my life, who works, as I am sure I don't have to tell you in the electorate<br />
and I think spends more time questioning, cross-questioning, arguing with<br />
Ministers on policy in Canberra than almost any other private Member,<br />
often with great advantage to the nation.<br />
Secondly I was glad because it would give me a chance to meet<br />
some of the people who had sent to us a Member who would help us to<br />
further an attitude to government, an approach to the running of the nation which<br />
over the last twenty years or so has, I think, proved itself to be a proper<br />
approach. Of course, there would in any period of such a time be errors<br />
made, mistakes made, but taking the thing as a whole, it has shown itself<br />
to be an approach which has built a nation, which twenty years ago was small,<br />
to a nation which is now standing on the threshold of real greatness and which<br />
has allowed in that period of time a foundation to be laid on which the great<br />
edifice of a future Australia can be built.<br />
These things do not come about by governments or by politicians.<br />
They come about by the presentation of programmes to Australians and the<br />
acceptance of those programmes by Australians, and the work done by<br />
Australians which enables the programmes themselves to be fulfilled.<br />
We tend too much to underwrite what we have done. We tend too<br />
much to write down ourselves as a country. We must now begin not only<br />
here, not only in New South Wales or in Victoria or in Western Australia,<br />
but throughout the whole of this continent to further the pride of being an<br />
Australian wherever in this continent that Australian may live.<br />
Things are really exciting in this country today. I am going to<br />
weary you a little now, just touching on some of the exciting things which will<br />
affect all of us and our children and our descendants in the future. 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
One company alone, in the Pilbara region in Western Australia<br />
has export contracts for 32 million tons of iron ore of the total value of,<br />
$ 260 million to be coming in to us over the next two years. Another foTF<br />
105 million tons worth $ 800 million. Another for 160 million tons worth<br />
240 million coming in in the period ahead. The port facilities that have<br />
grown as a result of this, the railways that have been built are all exciting<br />
examples of what is happening in this nation of ours. The new town at<br />
Dampier 170 miles of railways new ports the oil being discovered in<br />
Barrow and under the waters of Bass Strait. soon, together with natural<br />
gas, to revolutionise the z~ spccity of Australia to live on its own resources and<br />
' lot be dependent on the world outside. All these are the sinews and I think<br />
they have come about for two reasons.<br />
One is because of the philosophical approach which the Member<br />
you sent to support us agrees with and furthers that is for this kind of<br />
growth to tak!-e place, it is necessary that the fullest support should be given to<br />
iheprivate initiative of Australian citizens and that they should be able to<br />
take risks, lose, but get rewards if they win, and that in such a climate you<br />
can without too much government direction leave to the initiative and good<br />
sense and brains of individual Australians the development df their nation,<br />
I think it has come about too, because this having been demonstrated<br />
to have worked in that way, has led to an investment in this country from<br />
abroad which this year alone was 100, 000 and which enables us to get the<br />
benefit of the quick development which the changing world around us demands<br />
we should achieve because of stability here and because of the climate here<br />
created. Now I said we tend to underwrite ourselves. This does not mean<br />
that there are not many things still requiring to be done. This does not mean<br />
that we can afford complacency. What it does mean is that looking at what<br />
has been achieved, let us look to the future and say, " This is just the<br />
beginning. All the past is really a prelude", which I roughly translate as:<br />
" fYou ain't seen nothing yet". And I do believe that in these years ahead we<br />
will, those of us sitting in this room, look back in ten years' time and say<br />
how much we have grown, how much our material strength has improved, how<br />
much the living conditions of our people have been improved.<br />
But we stand at this point in history in a position we have never<br />
been in before, For 200 years or more, the Royal Navy has protected us<br />
from any assaultf from overseas against our shores, and we, when called<br />
upon, have rallied to the support of the United Kingdom, Great Britain, but<br />
in between times, have had to expend but little thought on our own defence.<br />
Those times have gone. The United Kingdom can no longer provide that shield.<br />
We, ourselves, must take up and are taking up more and more of the burden<br />
which any prudent country must take up to protect itself against threats which<br />
may not as yet be foreseen but which history indicates are always likely to<br />
be present. And in taking up that burden, we have to examine the situation<br />
where the old theories on which our defence was built are no longer valid, and<br />
examine new possibilities and bring forward new programmes.<br />
This is one of the great problems facing us today, and one which<br />
as you know, we are studying, working for, and providing for. But this is<br />
not the only point of change. 1/ 3 </p>

We have to make choices as to what we will do in<br />
the immediate years ahead from the resources available to us how much,<br />
a government must decide, should be provided for defence purposes;<br />
how much, a government must decide, should be provided for increasing<br />
the requirements for universities, for technological colleges, for schools,<br />
for more teachersi how muich should be provided for scientific work further<br />
to develop the capacity of the land to carry more wealth, to produce more<br />
wealth; how much, and this cannot be skipped, must be provided to see that<br />
the aged and the invalidi the needy, the ill amongst us are provided with<br />
sufficient to live on in moderate comfort.<br />
And how much must be left in the hands of the private<br />
citizens so that that further development we need can take place because the<br />
incentive to the private citizen is there. . These are the things on which<br />
we must make choices, These are the things on which governments choose<br />
priorities-, These are the tasks before us. We will let you know relatively<br />
soon what the priorities are for the coming year,<br />
It is possible that what we think is right may by some<br />
be thought wrong, It would be most surprising if that were not so. * But<br />
we will say what we think is right, We will say why we think it is right,<br />
We will keep arguing unless some better arguments, convince us we are<br />
wrong which I think is most unlikely and we will then leave it to the<br />
Australian people to decide whether in fact we wete right or We were wrong<br />
in what we did. But whatever those choices of Priorities we decide may<br />
be, I know from the atmosphere in this Itoomi from the people that I have<br />
met tonight, that what we decide Is only the beginning of achievement, what<br />
we decidewill only make it possible for each individual Australian himself<br />
to contribute to the growth for which we provide the possibilities if we<br />
make the right choices. Never has there been a time in this nation's history<br />
when it has been more necessary for each Australian going about his,<br />
ordinary occasions wherever he : may be to adopt as his motto that saying:<br />
Whatsoever thy right hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might. Because<br />
if that is done, then not only will the individual get satisfaction from what<br />
he is doing in life, and the work he is achieving, but the nation will grow,<br />
he will get a feeling of service, which I am sure our young want more than<br />
anything else, a feeling of giving over and above his own personal requirements.<br />
This is another task, an urgent task of leadership in government to give<br />
to Australians that feeling of participation, that feeling of service, that pride<br />
in achievement which is latent in them and which I believe, stirred properly,<br />
will make us the greatest nation in the world in time, not only in terms of<br />
material strength, not only in terms of opportunities to the individual to<br />
develop himself to the top of his bent, but also in an approach to social<br />
problems which I think we can and will overcome. This is the task before<br />
us as I see it. This is the task I am going to call on you, and others like<br />
you, to carry out. This is the task which, in fact, can only be carried out by<br />
you and us together. I conclude by saying I believe above all there is<br />
amongst the Australian people a will, an ability, a desire and a goodness<br />
which, properly utilised, will make our children proud. I thankc you. </p>
