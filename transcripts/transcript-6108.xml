ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THlE 11ON. R. J. L. HAW1KS, A. C.<br />
TO THE NATIONAL FINALS OF WORK SKILL AUSTRALIA<br />
9 M4AY 1983'<br />
I am delighted to be with you on this great<br />
occasion the national finals of the Work Skill Australia<br />
skills competition. Here today are the cream of Australia's young<br />
tradespeople you have successfully competed in<br />
competitions all over Australia to reach these National<br />
Finals, the first in Australia.<br />
This national program of skill competitions -Work<br />
Skill Australia is a new and exciting landmark in<br />
Australia's trade training.<br />
It began only last year. Yet despite its short<br />
history, it has already had enthusiastic support from<br />
thousands of our young apprentices right around Austr-alia.<br />
These National Finals are a marvellous tribute to<br />
that support. But as well as congratulating you, the competitors,<br />
let me pa y another tribute.<br />
This is to the judges and the professionalshundreds<br />
of you who've worked so tirelessly to make these<br />
Skill Olympics the great success they so clear-ly are.<br />
You all deserve our congratulations.<br />
I'm fortunate to have witnessed a small part of the<br />
development and work that has culminated in these National<br />
Finals. </p>
<p>The task of Work Skill Australia -promoting<br />
enthusiastic highly skilled tradespeople -is as vital as<br />
ever. Our capacity as a nation to lift our standard of<br />
living depends very much on the talent, initiative and<br />
skills of our young tradespeople.<br />
The skills you are demonstrating today are central<br />
to our industrial society.<br />
Those skills are very often hidden in the<br />
factories and the workshops away from the public gaze.<br />
But today they are on display.<br />
Your skills are being recognized in a way they so<br />
thoroughly deserve.<br />
There is one special reason why those skills should<br />
be recognised and fostered.<br />
Unless we can maintain intakes of apprentices at<br />
sufficient levels, we do risk serious shortages of skilled<br />
labour in the years ahead as economic recovery gathers<br />
momentum. The lead time for the training of apprentices is<br />
substantial -4 years in most cases.<br />
Employers, and indeed the whole community, need to<br />
take a long term view to supporting apprentice intakes to<br />
ensure the Australian workforce does have the skill it needs<br />
for the future. </p>
<p>Work Skill Australia was itself a project of the<br />
Evatt Foundation, which I had the privilege of helping set<br />
up. I was also an inaugural member of the Board of Work<br />
Skill Australia in my former capacity as Shadow Minister for<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations.<br />
My colleague, Ralph Willis, as the Minister for<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations, will today join the<br />
Board, so enabling continued involvement by my Government.<br />
The Board of Work Skill Australia has<br />
representatives from unions, employers and government.<br />
It is an example of the kind of cooperation between<br />
these three groups so essential to our nation's progress.<br />
That spirit of cooperation between government,<br />
unions and employers was shown strikingly last month in<br />
Canberra at the National Economic Summit Conference.<br />
The Summit Conference was an overwhelming Success.<br />
It marks a new beginning for Australia, a first<br />
step toward our great goals of national reconciliation,<br />
reconstruction and recovery.<br />
In particular, the Summit focussed on the need for<br />
Australia to respond to the challenges before us in a<br />
cooperative and innovative'manner.<br />
Nowhere is the need to consider new approaches more<br />
evident than in our apprenticeship and training systems'.<br />
Despite our great economic problems, today is a day<br />
of celebration. </p>
<p>Work Skill AuIstralia, by raising the status Of<br />
skill training as a career and promoting higher standards,<br />
is helping to create that long term outlook.<br />
The task of improving our trade training system is<br />
a major challenge for Australia. The main source of our<br />
skilled labour is, of course, apprenticeship training.<br />
The apprenticeship system has served Australia<br />
well. Even so, it has some glaring faults.<br />
One, in particular, is that the opportunities<br />
provided for young women are far too limited.<br />
Of Australia's 140,000 apprentices, only about<br />
per cent are women.<br />
If the traditional female area of hairdressing is<br />
excluded, less than 2 per cent of apprentices are women.<br />
This is just not good enough!<br />
Quite apart from the question of equity and<br />
fairness, it makes no sense for us as a nation to so<br />
blatantly squander the potential of our young women by<br />
largely excluding them from apprenticeship training.<br />
It is incumbent, first of all, on employers to<br />
consider much more closely-the employment of female<br />
apprentices, including in so-called non-traditional trade<br />
areas. It is also appropriate for young women themselves<br />
to consider the possibility of apprenticeships across the<br />
whole gamut of trade areas and for those women who do enter<br />
these fields to be given the full support of their parents,<br />
employers and work colleagues. </p>
<p>Ladies and ge ntlenen, Wnrk Skill ! Australia has made<br />
its mark extremely quickly.<br />
This is shown no better than in thiese N'ational<br />
Finals here today.<br />
These finals are a first for Australia.<br />
And I am able to formally announce that they wi) ll<br />
soon be followed by another first the fielding of the<br />
first Australian team at the International Skill Olympics in<br />
Austria this August.<br />
That team will be represented by some of you here.<br />
I take this opportunity to wish every success to<br />
those of you who will represent Australia at that splendid<br />
International event.<br />
I also invite the Australian team to visit me in<br />
Canberra before the departure for Austria if you can fit<br />
it in. Because of the great importance we attach to Work<br />
Skill Australia, the Federal Government has decided to make<br />
a special grant of $ 100,000 to the project, intended<br />
particularly as a contribution to the Australian team's<br />
participation in Austria.<br />
Looking further ahead, Work Skill Australia has<br />
already obtained the optiofi of holding the 1988<br />
International Skil. Olympics in Australia.<br />
I believe this event would be a tremendous boost to<br />
the recognition of trade training in Australiai as well as a<br />
major event in the nation's Bicentennial Celebrations. </p>
<p>biscussiors are already taking place with the<br />
Bicentennial Authority to develop this proposal further.<br />
; Let us make it our challenge to foster and develop<br />
the skills and talents of our workforce so that by 1988, the<br />
Bicentennial Year, we can show the world we stand among the<br />
very forefront of industrial nations.<br />
I congratulate all of you on the great success of<br />
these first National Work Skill finals and, once again, wish<br />
those of you who will compete in Austria later this year<br />
every success. </p>
