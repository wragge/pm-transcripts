PRIME MINISTER/ MURRAY NICOLL, RADIO 5AN 4 FEBRUARY 1993<br />
S. 0.2 PROOF ONLY<br />
NICOLLt It was a little unexpected your ride into town<br />
today. It presents an intriguing picture really, riding into<br />
town to save the State. Is that what it's like. A State in<br />
distress. PM: We1, I think it's calling it as it is. That is<br />
there's been a big shadow boxing game going on now between the<br />
Govt down here and the State opposition and the residual problems<br />
from the state Bank and its aftermath are such that I know that<br />
the Govt -fSA regardless of what it tries to do has not the<br />
adequacy of resources to meet the problem; that is that the<br />
residual debt which the State is now carrying, having funded over<br />
$ 3BN intoe-State Bank is a burden which is too much to carry<br />
and it will require Commonwealth assistance.<br />
NICOLLs You're sayina only the State Bank can save us,<br />
we're that badly off are we?<br />
PM: Only the Commonwealth.<br />
WICOLLt I'm sorry, only the sale of the State Bank.<br />
PM Oh yes. I think the State Bank should be sold<br />
because the franchise is still one of the best franchises in the<br />
country that is, if the debts are skinned out of it, and you're<br />
uot left with the actual business the franchise it's the<br />
last great franchise left in the country. So, it's definitely<br />
valuable, and worth a lot of money.<br />
NICOLLt Now would you envisage it happening, the same as<br />
in Victoria, a straight sale to the Commonwealth Dank,<br />
PMg well, not to the Commonwealth Bank. In Victoria<br />
there was a procaas where the State Bank of Victoria was offered<br />
to other banks generally to acquire and that process would need<br />
to be followed here. But, the biggest part of the process is<br />
what'S called the due diligence, that is seeing what the<br />
contingent liabilities of the bank are, because nobody is qoing<br />
to -uy a problem, they'll want indemnification or to be certain<br />
that the problem has been cleaned up, that they're buying the<br />
business without all of its former problems. So, it takes time<br />
to do a due diligence, that is a comb through the b6oke to make<br />
judgments about all the contingent liabilities, the value of the<br />
assets, and to arrive at a figure of nett assets and goodwill.<br />
See, there's a goodwill attaches to the business because it has<br />
such a huge support within SA. The franchise carries a lot of </p>
<p>2<br />
goodwill and when that's efttablishAd then that can be offered to<br />
other financial institutions. Now, in Victoria, the American<br />
investment banking firm and advisers Merrill? Lynch handled the<br />
sale and it would require someone of that standing I think<br />
probably to manage a sale process here.<br />
NICOLLs So a parallel with the Victorian setup.<br />
PHI Pretty much so I think, Murray, pretty much so.<br />
And I think if the State does that, gets into a position to gat<br />
it sold, there's then the question of compAnsation for the change<br />
in the tax arrangements. At the moment there's a tax stream that<br />
runs to the State Govt, that would transfer to the Fed Tax<br />
Office. So we can capitalise that income stream and hand it to<br />
the State as compensation. So if you look at the sale of the<br />
bank plus the compensation package, this would meet some<br />
substantial portion of the debt. But even after that there will<br />
be such a refidual that I don't believe that the Sth Australian<br />
people, the Sth Australian Govt's budget, cuts in govt spnding<br />
or prevailing on the community with higher taxes, will meet the<br />
costs. I think the risk is SA is in a debt trap from which it<br />
can't emerge without the assistanceof the CommonwAalth Govt.<br />
NICOLLi Of course the State Bank is not our only problem,<br />
it's only one of a very considerable economic problem that the<br />
State's facing, a narrow bass whic-h is rnally reatricting us.<br />
I'm wondering if we'll ever get out of it.<br />
PM Well, I think again there is a role for the<br />
Commonwealth and there has been already now for ten years of the<br />
Commonwealth Govt saying that it will intervene in the economy to<br />
guarantee that a place like SA, a State like SA, which is<br />
dependent upon a certain range of industries does have support.<br />
And it's things like the submarine program, which the<br />
Commonwealth decided upon some years ago, the Multifunction<br />
Polls, the extension of the narrow to the standard gauge railway<br />
into Melbourne, all of these things and particularly the support<br />
for the car industry, all of these things are necessary things to<br />
give the State of SA the industrial weight and ballast and<br />
breadth it needs. Now, you know, I've made the point today, the<br />
Govt is the only party in Australia that believes the<br />
Commonwealth should intervene and make things happen in a StAte.<br />
My opponent, J~ hn Heweon, doesn't believe that he doesn't<br />
believe in intervening, he doesn't believe in intervention. Nowo<br />
what we're saying is if you take the motor industry for instance,<br />
you ask yourself the essential question, should Australia have a<br />
motor industry. The Govt says yes, the Opposition says, well if<br />
it can survive we'll have one. The Govt says, hang on, that's<br />
not right, it has to survive. So you arrive at a set of<br />
arrangements and tariffs that let's it6ukLve and grow.<br />
NICOLL$ FCall, that's critical in this State. Does that </p>
<p>Mean that you'll extent the same assistance to the motor vehicle<br />
industry that you exteanded to the sugar industry in Queensland.<br />
PH; Wall, the motor vehicle industry-has been subject<br />
to a phase down in tariffs over period 1988 to 1997, weirs now<br />
two-thirds the waythrough it, ( words unclear) the two-thirds the<br />
way through it.<br />
NICOiLL The industry says you can't sustain the risk, not<br />
here. P141 Oh, yes they can, yes they can. They can't<br />
sustain zero, they can't sustain zero which is what John llewson<br />
and Tan McLachlan want to give them, but the end point of the<br />
L~ abor Govt's tariff change is an effective rate of protection of<br />
N~ ow, it's a good compromise between the interests of<br />
consumers and the interests of the industry and its employees<br />
because cars which are now $ 201000, standard saloon care which<br />
are $ 20,000, would have been before these changes, $ 30,000-<br />
fewer people would have bought them and the industry would be so<br />
Much waaker. But at zero, obviously if we take let's say a<br />
Japanese manufacturer who's running 300,000 care on one run in<br />
Japan, they're not going to come to Australia to build a plant<br />
for 30,000 cars with zero protection. Why would they. At zero<br />
protection why would they wear the disabilities of scale and<br />
distance to build 30,000 cars here when they can easily go from<br />
300,000 to 330,000 in Japan.<br />
? 4ICOLLt So how much lower have you got in mind beyond the<br />
Year 2000.<br />
PHI Well, I think the nominal level of it's<br />
effactive and nominal IS. The 35 comes with the export<br />
facilitation progrAms. At thoseo levels I think it's a fair deal<br />
for the motor industry.<br />
NICOLLs Will you hold them at that beyond 2000.<br />
PHI At this gtage I've got no intention of trying to<br />
press them beyond that point. I was part of negotiations with<br />
_ John Button with the various motor industry leaders in 1990 and<br />
' 91 and of course like every industry, Murray, you know, people<br />
make the claims and they press you, a Govt has to work out how<br />
far it can go and how far the claims are real. We think we've<br />
got the right result And I think the fact that the Toyota motor<br />
company decided to build a state of the art plant in Melbourne,<br />
you know, proves the point that is the proof of the pudding in in<br />
the teating. They on the G~ ovt's tariff policy set up a world<br />
state of the art car plant. Btit Bob Johnson from Toyota made<br />
cler tatat zero thoy wouldn't have made that.. investmahi.'<br />
Mitsibushi in SA have mada clear that at zero they won't make the<br />
investment and that.' s why 11--made this clear before to the </p>
<p>people of SA that the Commonwealth Govt, Labor Govt, does believe<br />
in a motor industry# will support it with the appropriate<br />
mechanisms of support and will do the things that have to be done<br />
to give SA an industrial base of some breahth, such an the<br />
submarine program, such as the Co-operative Research Centres,<br />
such as the railway programs etc.<br />
NICOLLs Alice Springs to Darwin railway line, will that<br />
last. PHI Well, that's a commiercial thing, it's not part of<br />
the main frame rail system. If someone comes along with a<br />
positive commercial story to tell on that, then I think that's<br />
diffarent. Blut at this stage no one has emerged. We've had a<br />
couple of JaPanese Corps in the late eighties express some<br />
intareet in it.<br />
NICOLLi They looked pretty responsible.<br />
PHI Yeah, but they dropped away, no one has kept it<br />
up. FICOLLt So a good viable commercial offer on the Darwin to<br />
Alice Springs railway line would not be thrown out, it would be<br />
given consideration. Not out of the question.<br />
PH: it would be examined but we've got to see one yet,<br />
Can I say though, in the One Nation StAtement what I proposed was<br />
that we build a standard gauge from Adelaide to Melbourne. I<br />
think that's far more important to SA, that SA be pulled more<br />
tightly into the eastern States economy. And the thing that does<br />
that is ba Ãµ iCAlly the standard gauge line over to Melbourne which<br />
of course SA has never enjoyed but should have had many years<br />
ago* NICOLL: You're moving around the country at the moment,<br />
you and the Leader of the Opposition and various Cabinet and<br />
Shadow Ministers are all over the country. This Ls obvious<br />
election campaign then and yet we haven't had an election called<br />
yet. Say the word.<br />
PHt Well, everything in due time. Issues have to ba<br />
attended to. Last week we had a Cabinet meeting at tending to a<br />
number of major issues including as you mentioned earlier sugar.<br />
We have considered now, an a group, SA for some time. I met the<br />
SA membors to discuss tha questiofts which were in the Statement<br />
which I made today in The Advertiser.<br />
NICOLLs Is this conditional by the way on the election. I<br />
me~ n,-can you start thea prfo~ tess now thAt needs to be done if . Lynnw<br />
Arnold sayg okay, we' 1l take that. </p>
<p>PHI Oh yes, we're already, we are already discussing<br />
with Lynn Arnold and the Govt the compensatory package for the<br />
sale of ( word unclear) the tax stream, the change in the tax<br />
stream from the State to the Commonwealth Govt. That's already<br />
happening now.<br />
NICOLLs is this a fait accompli. Have you decided, you<br />
and Lynn Arnold, that you will sell the bank.<br />
PM No, I think it is his intention in the right<br />
circumstances to sell the bank. He wants to know where we stand<br />
on a compensation package. We're now negotiating that with him.<br />
NICOLLs So we don't have to wait until after the election<br />
to get the details.<br />
PM: No.<br />
NICOLLt And when are we going to have an election. Is<br />
Parlt going back on the 23rd.<br />
PMS Well, that's the $ 64 question.<br />
NICOLL# As scheduled.<br />
PHI Well, that's what I intend. And we have to call<br />
an election by early April at the latest so it's not that far<br />
away. a<br />
NICOLLI Not far away, with Leo McLeay in the chair.<br />
PM: well, in an election the House of course is<br />
dissolved. NICOLLt I mean on the 23rd, if you go back on the 23rd<br />
with Leo McLeay in the chair, not standing down.<br />
PM: Well, he can't stand down. I mean the Speaker is<br />
elected. The Speaker is elected by the Parlt.<br />
NICOLLt He can stand aside.<br />
PM: Well, it torns out you can't as the law turns Out,<br />
I think he has to either be out of the country or ill. Anyway,<br />
that's not the point,<br />
NICOLLt The Opposition will be all over that like a rash.<br />
PH s Oh well, the Opposttion has got plenty of<br />
problems. We've got plenty of problems ready for them.<br />
NICOLLsI think you've got a few of your own too. </p>
<p>PMe oh yeah, but that's public life.<br />
NICOLLi Bob Mawke is having a bit of a shot at you at the<br />
moment. He says;, he still Says that the ALP was wrong replacing<br />
him with you back in He says if the Fed election was held<br />
today the Coalition would probably win and he also says that the<br />
Australiad people want a change of Govt.<br />
PM: Well, he's entitled to his view. It's a free<br />
country. NICOLLt Your response, is that it.<br />
pMs I couldn't, you know, there's an old saying in<br />
public life, the dogs may bark but the caravan moves on.<br />
NICOLLt Okay. In other words who Cares about what Bob<br />
Hawke thinks.<br />
PMt Well, obviously he cares and good on him.<br />
NICOLLs But you don't.<br />
PM1 N~ ot vary much, no.<br />
N4ICOLL: How much longer are we going to iee this betweenl<br />
you and Mr Hewson. There's a feeling abroad in the country that<br />
we really need leadership right now.<br />
PM: Absolutely. The vory day I'm downi here talking<br />
about the SA budget, the debt profile, the capacity of SA to fund<br />
itself the breath of its industrial base, I've had to Contend<br />
with John Hewson sort of attacking me. Well, you know, I hope<br />
John wakes up to himself and gives it away.<br />
NICOLL: Will you sue him?<br />
VMS: well* let's see what he says about all this. I<br />
mean, he made an intemperate claim it's the same sort of<br />
intemperate claim he made about Bob Carr just before Christmas,<br />
Baying you got to wonder about a follow that doesn't drive a car<br />
and doesn't have children. It's the % Ame sort of intemperate<br />
claim he made about renters he said you can alw. iays tell a<br />
renter's house by the grass growing through the front fence;<br />
they don't look after tha rlace. T mean, it's that sort of<br />
intemperate quality and this was just anothar example of that I<br />
think. NICOLL; Bearing in mind the parlq. g state of SA., let's<br />
come back to that for a moment, and the Fed election, would you<br />
consider making your campaign Apeech, launching the campaign </p>
<p>formally, instead Qf informally which has already be done,<br />
formally launching it from this city perhaps.<br />
PM Well, that's a matter an much for the Fed<br />
orgAnisation of the Party as for me and these are things we have<br />
not yet decided. So, you know, I can't be anymore prescriptive<br />
about that than being able to say as I've just said. But I think<br />
that the important thing is rather than the cosmetics of any of<br />
these thingg, I think this is going to be an important election,<br />
it's going to materially affect the fortunes of SA. Now I think<br />
the people of SA have got to make a very, a reasonably acute<br />
judgement here.<br />
NICOLLt This state and WA are going to considerably affect<br />
the fortunes of the Keating Govt at a Fed election.<br />
PM: Well, they do in every election, they do in every<br />
election. NICOLLi More so this year than perhaps ever before.<br />
PMs Well, I don't know. No, I wouldn't concede that.<br />
But the judg6oment will be which of the two parties is in the<br />
first instance, interested in SA. In the second instance, is<br />
prepared to take a hand in being certain that it doesn't fall<br />
into a debt trap and can fund itself without an inordinate burden<br />
on the community and a big cut in public services. Which party<br />
will intervene in the economy and guarantee that the motor<br />
vehicle industry stays in business and grows. which party will<br />
broaden the industrial base of SA and intervene in it.<br />
NICOLLi Can you giiarantee all of this.<br />
PM; Well, I may, look at our record rather than our<br />
words. Our record is the submarine program, the MFP, the<br />
railways, the Co-operative Research Centres, fiscal equalization<br />
which I supported for 9 years as Treasurer which pays a higher<br />
proportion of the State pool into SA and the smaller states.<br />
NICOLLt Record unemployment.<br />
PM1 Than the bigger states. I'm just talking about<br />
the state itself. Those things we've done and I made the point<br />
today in the speech that sinee 1978 Australian employment has<br />
risen by 28%. But employment in SA has risen by only 15. And if<br />
you look at some states, Queensland, employment has risen by 53%<br />
over the period. SA by 15. WA employment risen by 44% over the<br />
period, SA by<br />
NICOLLt It's all a bit embarrassing isn't it.<br />
PMSWell it means that there's got to be an effort </p>
<p>made on the part of Govts You c~ flt jusit say l. ook we'll leave It<br />
to market forces an John Hewsoft does. if you may that, what will<br />
happen in the industrial base of Sh will shrink further and the<br />
employment base with it. SO, Govts must come out and do things<br />
to maintain the ballast of the state which the Labor Govt has<br />
done over a decade and which we'll continue to do.<br />
NICOLL a So you'll see us right.<br />
PHI. We'll see us right in this respect, we'll<br />
continue with a policy of fiscal Oqualisatiofli that is, rather<br />
than just per capita payments to the States we'll see that this<br />
pool with an inordinate ahare for the smaller states to maintain<br />
services, we'll see SA right in joining with the Arnold Govt to<br />
sea that aome of that debt burdan is spread more widely than the<br />
people of SA, that's the State bank debt burden, and we'll see $ A<br />
right by guaranteeing that we focus on its industrial future<br />
including the motor vehicle and components industry.<br />
NICOLL: Would the same apply to a Liberal Govt. I note<br />
you say specifically the Arnold Govt. If there's a Liberal Govt<br />
after the next State election which is not far away.<br />
PX1 Yes, yes, as far as I'm concerned. I mean, it is<br />
the people of the State that matter, it's a region of Australia<br />
which is important and you know, I Just don't believe that a<br />
conlscientious Govt in Canberra can ignore a problem of these<br />
dimensions. NICOLL: Just finally, let me ask you, probably the mst<br />
difficult question of the lot, and that is look ahead 10 or<br />
years, what's your vision for the country. To it possible for<br />
you and we need this, we really need it desperately, is it<br />
possible for you to tell us what you've got in mind for this<br />
country. How you're going to do it in the next 10 to 15 or<br />
years$ put I think Australia has already crossed the Rubicon.<br />
It's become<br />
NICOLLi We've heard it befnre.<br />
PH4: Oh yes, but look, exports are still going gang<br />
bust. As at two days ago you could isee it again<br />
NICOLLs Imports too.<br />
P1 No, no, look 10 years ago we were exporting only<br />
14% of our national production. That's now 24%. 1 mean it's<br />
been a revolution.' This is a much more productive country. It's<br />
now enmeshed truly with the rest of the world oconomy as it never<br />
was before 1983. Before we floated the dollar, removed exchange </p>
<p>9<br />
controls and lowerod general levels of protection, the Australian<br />
economy was an isolated uncompetitive economy. It's now an<br />
integrate cozmpatitiva economy and what the Govt's done the last<br />
couple of yerand last'year in particular, is much more<br />
successfully integrated Australia into the SE Asian and north<br />
Asian economies. So if you look at the 90' s you'll find that<br />
Australia is well sotup, it's a low inflation economy# it's got a<br />
competitive exchange rate mechanism. It's got a change iii the<br />
productive culture at management and with labor we're a high<br />
productivity country at the moment. we're wall set up to hop<br />
into that growth in the vortex of growth in the Asia Pacific<br />
which will lift income and living standards through the 90' s and<br />
beyond. I mean Australia has made the change. We've got further<br />
to go but we have made the fundamental change which I was talking<br />
about in the early to mid 1980' s and tha Australian people<br />
deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making that change and<br />
being so conscientious about their economic and social<br />
circumstances. NICOLLt It's interesting that you mention Asia because<br />
those countries do have long term plans. Japan for example,<br />
thinks decades ahead. we don't, do we, we think from one<br />
election to the next.<br />
PM: Except, I mean I think we are now by getting the<br />
line straight, that is do we want to be a closed economy shipping<br />
a bit of wheat and wool, no. Are we happy to have only 3 kids in<br />
completing secondary school, no. what have we got now. We'r<br />
not just a closed economy shipping a bit of wheat and wool, we're<br />
an Open economy, where this year for the first year ever<br />
manufactured exports equal rural exports and the fastest growing<br />
component of that is elaborately transformed? manufactures. This<br />
year nearly 8 kids in 10 complete secondary school. Ton years<br />
ago it was 3 in<br />
NICOLLI A lot of them are thef a becausa they can't get<br />
work. P1 Oh no. Well, there ara some thera obviously but<br />
the retention rate has climbed right through the 80' s even when<br />
employment was strong. And we're now concentrating on<br />
Australia's greatest comparative advantage, which is its<br />
education system. Education, research and development, product<br />
innovation, elaborate transformation of products dovetailed into<br />
the Asia Pacific. That's Australia future, not just selling<br />
commodities which is what the Liberal Party locked us into and<br />
where the debt came from. The debt of Australia started in the<br />
late 1960' s and because basically we want through the Rip Van<br />
Winkle years of Menzies and later, but the transformation of<br />
Australia to a modern indtistrial country with a ' productive<br />
culture didn't occur. It waited until 1983 before we started,<br />
but we're well on the way now and I think AustrAlia has made the<br />
fundamental change and will continue to make it &amp; a the 90' B go<br />
one End </p>
