Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
YUGO SLAV IMMIGRANT<br />
ORGAMISATIONS.<br />
MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 27th August 1964.]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister)-by leave--For some time,<br />
there have been references both in the<br />
Parliament and elsewhere to the activities<br />
of certain Yugoslav immigrant organisa-<br />
-ions. The Government is, and over a period<br />
) as been, in possession of considerable<br />
information on these activities. Certain of<br />
this information is embodied in replies which<br />
are being made separately to the series of<br />
questions on the matter which were asked<br />
pthe previous parliamentary session. This<br />
.4pplies to questions asked by the honorable<br />
member for Yarra ( Dr. J. F. Cairns), answers<br />
to which he should get today. However,<br />
I feel I should also take the opportunity to<br />
make some observations to the House about<br />
the Government's general policy in<br />
relation to migrant organisations and about<br />
immigration from Yugoslavia.<br />
In the years since World War II, Australia's<br />
immigration programme has brought<br />
to this country people from all parts of<br />
Europe with a diversity of historical and<br />
cultural backgrounds. Many of these people<br />
were refugees from oppression. Many<br />
derived from happier circumstances. This<br />
flow of new citizens has played an import-<br />
11142/ 64. ant part in building the nation. It is something<br />
which has given us great satisfaction<br />
and we wish to see it continue. However,<br />
it is basic to our immigration policy that all<br />
these new citizens should be integrated as<br />
fully, and as quickly, as possible into Australia's<br />
national life. The people of Australia<br />
endorse this approach and, as part of<br />
its mnigration programme, the Government<br />
has enlisted the help of community and<br />
public bodies throughout the Commonwealth<br />
in the vital work of assimilation.<br />
There has been a very gratifying response<br />
in this regard and on the whole the programme<br />
of integration has met with great<br />
success. The Government is not taking an attitude<br />
against immigrants from particular countries<br />
joining in their own associations. We<br />
do not expect newcomers to turn their backs<br />
on their original heritage. On the contrary,<br />
it is wholly understandable that immigrants<br />
should establish organisations amongst themselves<br />
for a variety of social and cultural<br />
purposes. It rather follows the precedents<br />
of the Irish and Scots in this country. These<br />
organisations, as honorable members will<br />
know, can also be a most valuable means </p>
<p>of assisting migrants to become fully integrated<br />
into the Australian community. I<br />
have no doubt that the great majority of<br />
organisations and societies to which<br />
migrants belong come within the category<br />
to which I have just been referring. However,<br />
the Government looks with disfavour<br />
on any activities of any migrant organisation<br />
which tend to frustrate integration.<br />
The possibility always exists that at some<br />
point, the activities of a particular immigrant<br />
organisation, or the activities of individuals<br />
within that organisation, may transgress<br />
the law. As necessary, investigations<br />
are made, and will be made, into the<br />
activities of various organisations including<br />
some which are not organisations of<br />
migrants alone or even primarily. If, as a<br />
result of these investigations, there is evidence<br />
of illegal activities on the part of an<br />
organisation, or individuals within an<br />
organisation, evidence which would be<br />
receivable in a court of law, then steps<br />
will be taken promptly, as may be appropriate<br />
to the particular case, to appeal to<br />
the law of the State or to invoke the relevant<br />
Commonwealth legislation. I add however,<br />
by way of reminder to the House,<br />
that it is not and never has been the practice<br />
to make details of security investigations<br />
available or public.<br />
I turn now to the matter of immigration<br />
from Yugoslavia. To understand the attitudes<br />
of these migrants it is necessary to<br />
remind ourselves that this part of Europe<br />
has an exceedingly complex and troubled<br />
history. Yugoslavia emerged from the political<br />
settlements of World War I. It brought<br />
together as a union a number of southern<br />
Slav peoples including Serbs, Croats and<br />
Slovenes, under the Serbian King Alexander.<br />
The Serbs obtained their independence from<br />
the Ottoman Empire during the nineteenth<br />
century and were numerically the largest<br />
group in the new State. The Croats had<br />
formerly enjoyed a degree of autonomy<br />
within the Austro-Hungarian empire and<br />
retained a national identity dating back as<br />
early as the ninth century. Deep differences<br />
of religious, cultural and historical kinds<br />
have existed between the groups despite<br />
kindred racial origins.<br />
Within the new State, the Croats sought<br />
a federal concept of government with a<br />
large degree of local autonomy. In 1928, the leader of the Croats, Stjepan Radic of<br />
the Croatian Peasant Party and two of his<br />
colleagues were assassinated in the Parliament<br />
in Belgrade. This precipitated a<br />
profound breach between Serbs and Croats.<br />
The Croats developed strong agitation in<br />
support of independence. Peasant Party<br />
leaders taking their cause to the League of<br />
Nations. Some Croat Parliamentary representatives<br />
were arrested, others, among them<br />
Dr. Ante Pavelic, went into exile.<br />
It was at this time that a revolutionary<br />
movement called Ustashi, meaning " insurgents"<br />
was founded, both in Croatia and-.,<br />
abroad, Pavelic being one of its first leaders<br />
This movement, in common with other<br />
Croat organisations, took as its symbol the<br />
traditional Croatian emblem of a white and<br />
red check shield but associated with this<br />
emblem the letter The traditiona'-<br />
emblem, both with and without the " U'<br />
is to be found in extensive use today by<br />
Croatian migrant groups throughout the<br />
world. It is difficult for people coming to Australia<br />
easily to forget their historical backgrounds.<br />
Since the war a number of organisations<br />
opposed to the present Government<br />
of Yugoslavia have developed throughout<br />
the world amongst refugees and migrants<br />
from that country. It is understandable that<br />
some Yugoslav migrants of Croatian origin<br />
should continue to hope for the estab<br />
lishment of an independent Croatia antL<br />
within a democracy like Australia they have<br />
a right to advocate their views so long as<br />
they do so by legitimate means. I wish to<br />
make it perfectly clear that the vast majority<br />
of the migrants from all parts of Yugoslavi<br />
who have settled in Australia have provecr<br />
to be law abiding, hard working citizens<br />
and a real asset to this country.<br />
Commonwealth and State authorities are<br />
continuing their investigations of Yugoslav<br />
and other organisations. Recently the Acting<br />
Premier of Victoria issued a statement on<br />
police inquiries in that State. He said that<br />
the police had found " that isolated acts<br />
of assault and misbehaviour had occurred<br />
but found no evidence whatever to support<br />
allegations of Ustashi violence towards<br />
individuals of Yugoslav nationality from<br />
which systematic or organised attacks could<br />
be inferred". That I take to mean that<br />
individual attacks have been noted but not </p>
<p>an organised or systematic series of attacks.<br />
Similar allegations made in Cairns also were,<br />
I understand, found by the Queensland<br />
police to be unsubstantiated. The Commonwealth's<br />
own investigations so far have not<br />
produced any evidence which would warrant<br />
legal proceedings.<br />
I wish to make the Government's position<br />
in this regard quite plain, however,<br />
Sir, and that is the real purpose of this<br />
statement, as well as to intimate at the<br />
same time that the particular questions asked in detail have been answered in detail,<br />
though not in this statement. So I make<br />
the Government's position quite clear: This<br />
Government will not interfere with freedom<br />
of opinion. Equally, it will not tolerate any<br />
activities which constitute a breach of the<br />
law. I present the following paper-<br />
Yugoslav Immigrant Organisations-Ministerial<br />
Statement, 27th August 1964-<br />
and move-<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA. </p>
